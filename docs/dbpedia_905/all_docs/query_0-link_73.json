Rezzan Ãnalp\n\n2015-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Winds of war prevailing over Europe at the beginning of the 20th Century tormented the continent by transforming it into a so called âbarrel-of-gunpowderâ and mutual declarations of war thence ensued led to unprecedented series of wars which could not have been avoided by any part of Europe, just like the Ottoman Empireâ¦ Ãanakkale Front was but only one of the innumerable fronts opened in the war. At a meeting held by the War Council, in London, in January 1915, a discussion on waging war against Central Powers was brought up, and consequently a plan of naval attack directed at Ãanakkale Strait was accepted. In view of the British authorities by seizing Gelibolu Peninsula the road to Ä°stanbul would be cleared, and thereby casting Turks out of the war a direct link would have been established. To this end, Entente Powers launched their first attack on the Ãanakkale Strait in November 1914. The bombardment aimed at destroying the coastal fortifications was repeated over and over again and finally on 18 March 1915 a comprehensive attack was launched. Entente Forces not succeeding in crossing the Strait from the sea launched a land warfare by landing forces to various locations as of 25 April 1915 that was to last for eight-and-a-half-months. Failing to achieve their targets the Ententes, in August 1915, attempted an amphibious campaign on the Anafartalar sector through Suvla Bay for the last time. However, to their dismay, they had to evacuate Gelibolu disillusioned. This article thoroughly embraces Ãanakkale Battlesâ military aspects by referring to the anecdotes and striking stories of warring soldiers. Moreover, the brilliant role Mustafa Kemal â first as the 19th Division Commander, then as the Commander of the Anafartalar Group â played in winning battles is put forward.\n\n2D-ACAR spectra of insulating and superconducting Y-123\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSmedskjaer, L.C.; Bansil, A.\n\n1992-09-01\n\nAn overview of the two-dimensional angular correlation (2D-ACAR) positron annihilation results for the three fundamental phases of YBa 2 Cu 3 O x , namely, the normal metal, the superconductor, and the insulator, is presented. In addition to the c-axis projected momentum density, the recent results for the a-axis projection as well as the insulating Y123 are discussed. The experimental results are compared and contrasted with the corresponding band theory predictions as far as possible in order to gain insight into the electronic structure and Fermiology of this archetypal high-T c superconductor\n\nPositron-annihilation 2D-ACAR studies of disordered and defected alloys\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBansil, A.; Prasad, R.; Smedskjaer, L.C.; Benedek, R.; Mijnarends, P.E.\n\n1987-09-01\n\nTheoretical and experimental progess in connection with 2D-ACAR positron annihilation studies of ordered, disordered, and defected alloys is discussed. We present, in particular, some of the recent developments concerning the electronic structure of disordered alloys, and the work in the area of annihilation from positrons trapped at vacancy-type defects in metals and alloys. The electronic structure and properties of a number of compounds are also discussed briefly; we comment specifically on high T/sub c/ ceramic superconductors, Heusler alloys, and transition-metal aluminides. 58 refs., 116 figs\n\na Positron 2D-ACAR Study of the Silicon-Dioxide Interface and the Point Defects in the Semi-Insulating Gallium Arsenide\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPeng, Jianping\n\nThe SiO_2-Si system has been the subject of extensive study for several decades. Particular interest has been paid to the interface between Si single crystal and the amorphous SiO_2 which determines the properties and performances of devices. This is significant because of the importance of Si technology in the semiconductor industry. The development of the high-intensity slow positron beam at Brookhaven National Laboratory make it possible to study this system for the first time using the positron two-dimensional angular correlation of annihilation radiation (2D-ACAR) technique. 2D-ACAR is a well established and is a non-destructive microscopic probe for studying the electronic structure of materials, and for doing the depth-resolved measurements. Some unique information was obtained from the measurements performed on the SiO_2-Si system: Positronium (Ps) atoms formation and trapping in microvoids in both oxide and interface regions; and positron annihilation at vacancy-like defects in the interface region which can be attributed to the famous Pb centers. The discovery of the microvoids in the interface region may have some impact on the fabrication of the next generation electronic devices. Using the conventional 2D-ACAR setup with a ^{22}Na as positron source, we also studied the native arsenic (As) vacancy in the semi -insulating gallium-arsenide (SI-GaAs), coupled with in situ infrared light illumination. The defect spectrum was obtained by comparing the spectrum taken without photo -illumination to the spectrum taken with photo-illumination. The photo-illumination excited electrons from valence band to the defect level so that positrons can become localized in the defects. The two experiments may represent a new direction of the application of positron 2D-ACAR technique on the solid state physics and materials sciences.\n\nPositron annihilation 2D-ACAR study of semi-coherent Li nanoclusters in MgO(1 0 0) and MgO(1 1 0)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFalub, C.V.; Mijnarends, P.E.; Eijt, S.W.H.; Huis, M.A. van; Veen, A. van; Schut, H.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nDepth selective positron annihilation two-dimensional angular correlation of annihilation radiation (2D-ACAR) is used to determine the electronic structure of Li nanoclusters formed by implantation of 10 16 cm -2 6 Li ions (with an energy of 30 keV) in MgO(1 0 0) and (1 1 0) crystals, and subsequently annealed at 950 K.

Data taken with projection along the c axis show a strong C 2v symmetry due to the presence of an incommensurate modulation with wave vector q in the crystal structure, together with considerable fine-structure. It is shown theoretically that the modulation should cause images of the Fermi surface displaced over an integer times q relative to the usual high-momentum components. An analysis of the behaviour of the fine-structure in the 2D-ACAR distribution shows that many peaks change in intensity and width but little in position T is raised from 6 to 92 K.

Poets, in these texts, had satirized various settlement place at imperial geography, generally because of its place name and folk features under cover of rhetoric and argo, reasons such as âdisapprobation, aversion of the folk, disappointment, getting irritate from nature or geographical location, to be dispatched involuntarilyâ. In this study, the city satires that put down on paper by the Divan poets shortly familiarized which we have made firm, and it is focused on the Edirne satire of the XVIII. century poets ArpaemÃ®ni-zÃ¢de Mustafa SamÃ® which put down on paper his negative feelings about the Edirne city, combining by negative features of the winter season. By the expressions in this qasida, the poet revealed intimately that he doesnât like the Edirne and its folk. Likewise, he had indicated the contention among the two capital city of Ottoman Empire which its root reached to conquest years, continued implicitly beginnig of the XVIII. Century.

W. H.; Mijnarends, P. E.; Schut, H.; Gao, Y.; Houtepen, A. J.; Ravelli, L.; Egger, W.; van Huis, M. A.; Bansil, A.\n\n2013-03-01\n\nPositron (e+) annihilation spectroscopy is one of only a few techniques to probe the surfaces of nanoparticles. We investigated thin films of PbSe colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) in the range 2-10 nm as prospective highly efficient absorbers for solar cells. We compare and contrast our findings with previous studies on CdSe NCs. Evidence obtained from our e+ lifetime spectroscopy study using the PLEPS spectrometer shows that 90-95% of the implanted positrons are effectively trapped and confined at the surfaces of these NCs. The remaining 5-10% of the e+ annihilate in the relatively large oleic acid ligands, in fair agreement with the estimated positron stopping power of the PbSe nanoparticle ``core'' relative to the ligand ``shell.'' 2D-ACAR measurements on the same set of films using the low-energy e+ beam POSH showed that the e+ wavefunction at the surfaces of the PbSe NCs is more localized than for the case of CdSe NCs. Comparison with calculated e+ - e- momentum densities indicates a Pb deficiency at the surfaces of the PbSe NCs, which correlates with e+ lifetime and the NCs morphology.

Here, a technique termed the adaptive common average reference (ACAR) is presented as an effective and simple method for removing this noise. The ACAR is based on a combination of the well-known common average reference (CAR) and an adaptive noise canceling (ANC) filter. In a convergent process, the CAR provides a reference to an ANC filter, which in turn provides feedback to enhance the CAR. This method was effective on both simulated and real data, outperforming the standard CAR when the amplitude or polarity of the noise changes across channels. In many cases the ACAR even outperformed independent component analysis (ICA). On 16 channels of simulated data the ACAR was able to attenuate up to approximately 290 dB of noise and could improve signal quality if the original SNR was as high as 5 dB. With an original SNR of 0 dB, the ACAR improved signal quality with only two data channels and performance improved as the number of channels increased. It also performed well under many different conditions for the structure of the noise and signals. Analysis of contaminated electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings further showed the effectiveness of the ACAR.

HOPG showed a marked bimodal ACAR distribution along the c-axis. By irradiation of 1.0 X 10 19 fast neutrons/cm 2 remarkable narrowing in the ACAR curves and disappearance of the bimodal distribution were observed. Lifetime in HOPG increased from 225 psec to 289 psec (positron-lifetime in vacancies and their small clusters) by the irradiation. The irradiation on isotropic graphites and glassy carbons, however, gave slight narrowing in ACAR curves and decrease in lifetimes (360 psec â 300psec). This suggests irradiation-induced vacancy trapping in crystallites. In C 60 /C 70 powder two lifetime components were detected: Ï 1 =177psec, Ï 2 =403psec (I 2 =58%). The former is less than the bulk lifetime of HOPG, while the latter being very close to lifetimes in the isotropic graphites and glassy carbons. This and recent 2D-ACAR study of HOPG surface [15] strongly suggest free and defect surface states around ''soccer ball'' cages\n\nElectron-positron momentium distribution measurements of high-Tc superconductors and related systems\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWachs, A.L.; Turchi, P.E.A.; Howell, R.H.; Jean, Y.C.; Fluss, M.J.; West, R.N.; Kaiser, J.H.; Rayner, S.; Haghighi, H.; Merkle, K.L.; Revcolevshi, A.; Wang, Z.Z.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe authors discuss measurements of the 2D-angular correlation of positron annihilation radiation (ACAR) in La 2 CuO 4 , YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 (YBCO), and NiO.

Systematic literature reviews were performed to identify studies directly comparing SAXA+MET versus ACAR+MET, and to obtain diabetes-related events costs which were modified by hospital surveys. A Cardiff Diabetes Model was used to estimate the long-term economic and health treatment consequences in patients with T2DM. Costs (2014 Chinese yuan) were calculated from the payer's perspective and estimated over a patient's lifetime. SAXA+MET predicted lower incidences of most cardiovascular events, hypoglycemia events and fatal events, and decreased total costs compared with ACAR+MET. For an individual patient, the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained with SAXA+MET was 0.48 more than ACAR+MET at a cost saving of Â¥18,736, which resulted in a cost saving of Â¥38,640 per QALY gained for SAXA+MET versus ACAR+MET. Results were robust across various univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. SAXA+MET is a cost-effective treatment alternative compared with ACAR+MET for patients with T2DM in China, with a little QALYs gain and lower costs. SAXA is an effective, well-tolerated drug with a low incidence of adverse events and ease of administration; it is anticipated to be an effective second-line therapy for T2DM treatment.\n\nWindow least squares method applied to statistical noise smoothing of positron annihilation data\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAdam, G.; Adam, S.; Barbiellini, B.; Hoffmann, L.; Manuel, A.A.; Peter, M.\n\n1993-06-01\n\nThe paper deals with the off-line processing of experimental data obtained by two-dimensional angular correlation of the electron-positron annihilation radiation (2D-ACAR) technique on high-temperature superconductors. A piecewise continuous window least squares (WLS) method devoted to the statistical noise smoothing of 2D-ACAR data, under close control of the crystal reciprocal lattice periodicity, is derived. Reliability evaluation of the constant local weight WLS smoothing formula (CW-WLSF) shows that consistent processing 2D-ACAR data by CW-WLSF is possible. CW-WLSF analysis of 2D-ACAR data collected on untwinned Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7-Î´ single crystals yields significantly improved signature of the Fermi surface ridge at second Umklapp processes and resolves, for the first time, the ridge signature at third Umklapp processes.

The objective of this work was to identify and describe the reproductive behaviour involved in the various phases of its reproductive cycle, such as territorial disputes and its establishment, substrate selection for spawning, courtship and mating, selection of mate and parental care. Twenty males and ten females of the study species were observed in the laboratory, over a period of six consecutive months. Behaviour descriptions resulting from these observations were analysed and the results show that the reproductive males are very agressive in the initial phase of reproduction. Agressiveness is a constant variable in encounters between territorial fishes, and possession of territory is of fundamental importance for reproduction of this species. Males with established territories were those which very successful in atracting the females during courtship. The selection of the females were influenced by the possession of territory, the type of substrate available for spawning and the body size. The fish preferred aquatic plants with broad leaves as an adequate substrate for spawning. It was observed that there was a short-term biparental care, before the eggs hatched, during which period the males played an important role in protecting them. After the eggs hatched, the male continued to protect the hatchling in his mouth, but played a lesser role, possibly to seek other females for mating so as to increase his reproductive output. Selection of a good mate by the female and the high degree of parental care were the factors which influence the reproductive success of the study species.\n\nUsher syndrome associated with Fuchs’ heterochromic uveitis: a case report\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nTuran-Vural, Ece; Turan-Vural,Ece; TORUN ACAR,Banu; TÃÂ¼kenmez,Nejla\n\n2011-01-01\n\nEce Turan-Vural, Banu Torun-Acar, Nejla TÃ¼kenmez, M Ã Âahin Sevim, Bulent Buttanri, Suphi AcarOphthalmology Clinic, Haydarpasa Numune Education and Research Hospital, Istanbul, TurkeyAbstract: We report a case of Usher syndrome in association with unilateral Fuchs' heterochromic uveitis.Keywords: Fuchsâ heterochromic uveitis, Usher syndrome, deafness, blindness\n\nOff-line analysis of positron annihilation spectra. I. Signature of crystal symmetry\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAdam, Gh.; Adam, S.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nWhile the technique of 2-D angular correlation of the electron-positron annihilation radiation (2D-ACAR) yields data in the laboratory frame, consistent off-line data analysis requires their reformulation in the crystal frame. In the case of an n-axis projected 2D-ACAR spectrum (where n denotes a principal crystallographic axis) of a high-T c superconductor, the crystal frame derivation needs enhancement of information on spectrum symmetry. The concept of signature of crystal symmetry (SCS) in a 2D-ACAR histogram discussed in this paper is a basic ingredient to the consistent solution of the problem. The SCS in a row 2D-ACAR histogram is defined as a collection of chi-square sums over M max + 1 sets of sites inside the detector-defined histogram plane. The number M max is fixed by choice of the principal crystallographic axis n-vector and the angular aperture of the setup. The necessity of this concept is discussed in Section 2. The correct understanding of the meaning of the SCS results heavily relies of that of the various sources contributing to the symmetry a 2D-ACAR spectrum. This point is discussed in Section 3. The quantitative definition of the SCS is detailed in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 is devoted to a short consideration of the computation of the SCS numerical values\n\nUsher syndrome associated with Fuchsâ heterochromic uveitis: a case report\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTuran-Vural E\n\n2011-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Ece Turan-Vural, Banu Torun-Acar, Nejla TÃ¼kenmez, M Åahin Sevim, Bulent Buttanri, Suphi AcarOphthalmology Clinic, Haydarpasa Numune Education and Research Hospital, Istanbul, TurkeyAbstract: We report a case of Usher syndrome in association with unilateral Fuchs' heterochromic uveitis.Keywords: Fuchsâ heterochromic uveitis, Usher syndrome, deafness, blindness\n\nCorrection to\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nHakyemez, I N; Erdem, H; Beraud, G\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn the original version of this article, Mustafa Sunbul was not included in the list of authors for this article.

Under TBO, aircraft flight plans are known to computer systems on the ground that aid in scheduling and separation. The Future Air Navigation System (FANS) was developed to support TBO, but relatively few aircraft in the US are FANSequipped. Thus, any near-term implementation must provide TBO procedures for non-FANS aircraft. Previous research has explored controller clearances, but any implementation must also provide procedures for aircraft requests. The work presented here aims to surface issues surrounding TBO communication procedures for non-FANS aircraft and for aircraft requesting deviations around weather. Three types of communication were explored: Voice, FANS, and ACARS,(Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System). ACARS and FANS are datacom systems that differ in that FANS allows uplinked flight plans to be loaded into the Flight Management System (FMS), while ACARS delivers flight plans as text that must be entered manually via the Control Display Unit (CDU). Sixteen pilots (eight two-person flight decks) and four controllers participated in 32 20-minute scenarios that required the flight decks to navigate through convective weather as they approached their top of descents (TODs). Findings: The rate of non-conformance was higher than anticipated, with aircraft off path more than 20% of the time. Controllers did not differentiate between the ACARS and FANS datacom, and were mixed in their preference for Voice vs. datacom (ACARS and FANS). Pilots uniformly preferred Voice to datacom, particularly ACARS. Much of their dislike appears to result from the slow response times in the datacom conditions. As a result, participants frequently resorted to voice communication. These results imply that, before implementing TBO in environments where pilots make weather deviation requests, further research is needed to develop communication\n\nPramana â Journal of Physics | Indian Academy of Sciences\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nHome; Journals; Pramana â Journal of Physics.

HOPG showed marked bimodality along the c-axis and anisotropy in ACAR momentum distribution, which stem from characteristic annihilation between 'interlayer' positrons and Ï-electrons in graphite. ACAR curves of the isotropic graphite and glassy carbons are even narrower than that of HOPG perpendicular to the c-axis. Positron lifetime of 420 and 390 - 480 psec, much longer than that of 221 psec in HOPG, were observed for the isotropic graphite and glassy carbons respectively, which are due to positron trapping in structural voids in them. Positron lifetime and ACAR width (FWHM) can be well correlated to void sizes (1.7 to 5.0 nm) of glassy carbons which have been determined by small angle neutron (SAN) scattering measurements. ACAR curves and positron lifetime of C 60 /C 70 powder agree well with those of glassy carbons. This shows that positron wave functions extend, as in the voids of glassy carbons, much wider than open spaces of the octahedral interstices of the face-centered cubic (FCC) structure of C 60 crystal and strongly suggests positron trapping in the 'soccer ball' vacancy. Possible positron states in the carbon materials are discussed with a simple model of void volume-trapping. Preliminary results on neutron irradiation damage in HOPG are also presented.

Doppler Broadening (DB) measurements reveal no such an effect for Cu(Mn) and Cu(Ni) solid solutions as well as for Ni alloys with 3d, 4d and 5d transition metal solutes (0.1 to 1.5 at.%) i.e. no evidence of e + localization near these impurities is seen. Our results strongly suggest that the ACAR results are due to the metallurgical state of the samples. In contrast, significant DB lineshape parameter variations, observed for our Ni(Zr) alloys, are attributed to positron trapping in and near Ni 5 Zr precipitates. Our DB results for a series of Ni(Au) alloys are understood in terms of a combination of the effect of an overall lattice expansion and a positron preference for clusters of Au atoms. The above comparison between DB and ACAR results is supported by our 'spin polarized' DB results for a (001) Ni single crystal which resemble those obtained by other groups using a 'spin polarized' 2D-ACAR technique.

The paper shows that consistent reformulation of the 2D-ACAR data in the crystal frame can be obtained from the knowledge of the signature of crystal symmetry (SCS) in the data. Derivation of the SCS over variations M-Umklapp areas of the reciprocal lattice from a rigorous definition also results in an improved a posteriori criterion concerning the twinned or untwinned nature of the crystal under investigation. The analysis of a c-projected 2D-ACAR spectrum on Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7-Î´ , accurately establishes the untwinned nature of the used crystals and yields better resolved Fermi surface ridge signatures at 2- and 3- Umklapp processes.

The calculations use the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) band structure formalism. The anisotropic distribution defined by taking cuts through the calculated spectra along different lines in the (p x ,p y ) plane possesses complex structures which arise from both Fermi surface effects and the anisotropy of the smoothly varying underlying background from filled bands; the maximum size of the anisotropy is about 10% of N 2Î³ (0,0). The theoretically predicted N 2Î³ (p x , y ) distribution is compared with the measured 2D-ACAR spectrum. The considerations suggest that in interpreting the 2D-ACAR data on YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 in terms of a band theory LDA picture, a substantial, largely isotropic, background should be subtracted from both the 2D-ACAR's and the associated LCW-folded spectra\n\nMagnetic focusing of an intense slow positron beam for enhanced depth-resolved analysis of thin films and interfaces\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nFalub, C V; Mijnarends, P E; Schut, H; Veen, A V\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThe intense reactor-based slow positron beam (POSH) at the Delft research reactor has been coupled to a Two-Dimensional Angular Correlation of Annihilation Radiation (2D-ACAR) setup. The design is discussed with a new target chamber for the 2D-ACAR setup based on Monte Carlo simulations of the positron trajectories, beam energy distribution and beam transmission in an increasing magnetic field gradient. Numerical simulations and experiment show that when the slow positron beam with a FWHM of 11.6 mm travels in an increasing axial magnetic field created by a strong NdFeB permanent magnet, the intensity loss is negligible above approx 6 keV and a focusing factor of 5 in diameter is achieved. Monte Carlo simulations and Doppler broadening experiments in the target region show that in this configuration the 2D-ACAR setup can be used to perform depth sensitive studies of defects in thin films with a high resolution.

In all cases, the lineshape parameter S from 2D-ACAR spectra were found to vary proportionally with internal surface area. In order to investigate the Bronsted acidity in NaHY zeolite, the lineshape parameter evaluation from 2D-ACAR measurements for varied acidity in NaHY zeolites by ion-exchange and thermal desorption were presented. The result from this investigation has demonstrated that the Bronsted acidity in NaHY zeolite was found to vary linearly with the lineshape parameter of the angular correlation spectrum of the sample. The lineshapes of 2D-ACAR spectra were determined for different base adsorbed HY-zeolite samples under a temperature controlled heating system in order to investigate, in-situ, the acid strength and number of Bronsted acid sites in the sample. Results have shown that the lineshape parameter of the angular correlation spectrum of the sample increases with the strength of adsorbed base and decreases with the number of Bronsted acid sites in the sample. This indicated that the lineshape parameter is sensitive to all of the strengths and concentrations of Bronsted acid sites in the HY-zeolite samples. The result from this study has also demonstrated that the large size base, pyridine, would reduce the possibility of positronium formation in the sample by filling the cage to eliminate the internal surface areas where the positroniums are likely to form. However, the small size base, ammonia, did not show any effect on the internal surface areas. Owing to the fact that this technique monitors only the Bronsted acid sites that situate on the surface which relates to the catalytic activity, there is little ambiguity about the location of the source of information obtained. The findings presented in this dissertation point out the fact that such lineshape\n\nElectronic structure and orientation relationship of Li nanoclusters embedded in MgO studied by depth-selective positron annihilation two-dimensional angular correlation\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFalub, C. V.; Mijnarends, P. E.; Eijt, S. W.; van Huis, M. A.; van Veen, A.; Schut, H.\n\n2002-08-01\n\nQuantum-confined positrons are sensitive probes for determining the electronic structure of nanoclusters embedded in materials. In this work, a depth-selective positron annihilation 2D-ACAR (two-dimensional angular correlation of annihilation radiation) method is used to determine the electronic structure of Li nanoclusters formed by implantation of 1016-cm-2 30-keV 6Li ions in MgO (100) and (110) crystals and by subsequent annealing at 950 K. Owing to the difference between the positron affinities of lithium and MgO, the Li nanoclusters act as quantum dots for positrons. 2D-ACAR distributions for different projections reveal a semicoherent fitting of the embedded metallic Li nanoclusters to the host MgO lattice. Ab initio Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker calculations of the momentum density show that the anisotropies of the experimental distributions are consistent with an fcc crystal structure of the Li nanoclusters. The observed reduction of the width of the experimental 2D-ACAR distribution is attributed to positron trapping in vacancies associated with Li clusters. This work proposes a method for studying the electronic structure of metallic quantum dots embedded in an insulating material.\n\nYerelden Evrensele Ä°ki Yol ArkadaÅÄ±: Cengiz Aytmatov ve KaysÄ±n Kuliyev Two Fellow Travellers From Local To Universal: Chingiz Aitmatov And Kaisyn Kuliyev\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMehmed Said ARBATLI\n\n2013-07-01\n\nFull Text Available While Chingiz Aitmatov almost always reflected Kyrgyz people, their traditions and their lifestyles in his works, he is undisputably a world writer who managed to reach the universal with local materials through his ability to catch the common values, feelings and thoughts of humanity. There seems to be a great similarity between Aitmatov and the Balkar poet Kaisyn Kuliyev, who had a significant role in his making his first public appearance in literature and was accepted as a teacher and was respected as well. Being from a small nation and reflecting its values, Kaisyn Kuliyev attained universal values and achieved great success. His poems were translated into 120 languages. Millions of copies of his books were printed, especially in Soviet Union period. However, although today Aitmatov is well-known by many people, Kuliyev is not recognized enough. The literature on Aitmatov being grand in scope, has barely mentioned the relationship between him and Kaisyn Kuliyev. In fact, Kuliyev was one of the most significant and well-known poets of his period, and it was him who influenced Aitmatov to begin a writing career. In this study of ours, we are going to examine their fellowship extending from the local to the universal and their common points, in addition to the mostly unknown close relationship of these two great artists of Turkic World.

The 2D ACAR technique is insensitive to the electronic mean-free-path and can be applied to pure metals as well as non-dilute alloys and compounds to obtain valuable information on the band structure and Fermi-surface geometry. The apparatus consists of two 30 x 30 cm 2 hybrid (high-density) multi-wire-chamber Î³ detectors at variable distances from 5 to 12 m at opposite sides of a variable temperature cryostat which contains a 6.5 T superconducting magnet. The detectors, the coded centre-of-gravity position read-out method employed, the associated electronics and computer software are described in detail. Operational characteristics and results are presented. A net detection efficiency of 6% and an angular resolution of 0.21 x 0.31 mrad 2 (0.029 x 0.042 a.u. 2 ) are reproducibly obtained. Parameters affecting the performance of the system are discussed. An improvement of the efficiency to over 10% by relatively simple measures is foreseen\n\nSignature of Fermi surface jumps in positron spectroscopy data\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAdam, G.; Adam, S.\n\n1998-12-01\n\nA subtractionless method for solving Fermi surface sheets (FSS), from measured n-axis-projected momentum distribution histograms by two-dimensional angular correlation of the positron-electron annihilation radiation (2D-ACAR) technique, is discussed. The window least squares statistical noise smoothing filter described in Adam et al., NIM A, 337 (1993) 188, is first refined such that the window free radial parameters (WRP) are optimally adapted to the data. In an ideal single crystal, the specific jumps induced in the WRP distribution by the existing Fermi surface jumps yield straightforward information on the resolved FSS. In a real crystal, the smearing of the derived WRP optimal values, which originates from positron annihilations with electrons at crystal imperfections, is ruled out by median smoothing of the obtained distribution, over symmetry defined stars of bins. The analysis of a gigacount 2D-ACAR spectrum, measured on the archetypal high-T c compound Y Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7-Î´ at room temperature, illustrates the method. Both electronic FSS, the ridge along Î Î§ direction and the pillbox centered at the S point of the first Brillouin zone, are resolved.

Furthermore, the Turkish Uthmani Empire replace The Daulah Abbasid with the breadth of his domain. Unfortunately during Uthmani Turkey is not a lot of developments in science are successfully obtained, not as much as during the Abbasid Daula. After the death of Sultan Sulayman al-Qanuni year 974 AH / 1566 AD As a huge kingdom, the Ottoman Turks gradually decline. Substitute Sultan Sulaiman al-Qanuni turned out to be more concerned with themselves, their morale even worse, so inevitably the Ottoman empire in decline. Sometimes the area is reduced due to losing the war, sometimes growing again, then decline again. This lasted until the XXI century. Mustafa Kemal Pasha was a brilliant military cadres in a career. With the concept, he wants to make Turkey a secular state that is no longer an empire. With all the efforts and the movement of his dreams come true.

For many decades, the official nationalist narrative portrayed Gallipoli as a ârehearsalâ for or even as part of the War of Independence (1919-1922.Â The victory was due almost solely to the military genius of Mustafa Kemal. This public memory might have been dominant for decades, but competing versions also developed. This article will largely deal with what can be called the Islamized or âreligionisedâ memory of Gallipoli.Â For some who adhere to this view, Gallipoli is where the âTurkishâ soldier stopped the last Crusaders. For others, their version of the battle does not include Mustafa Kemal. Yet, both sides have something in common as they prepare to celebrate the victory. Both the nationalist and the Islamist memories ignore the possible connections to another event which is remembered on 24 April, the day before the Entente landing in Gallipoli: the order given for the deportation of Anatolian Armenians. The âcelebrationâ for one is likely to overwhelm the remembrance and mourning of the other.\n\nHuman Papilloma Virus and HPV vaccine knowledge among Mustafa Kemal University Medical Students\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRaziye Keskin Kurt\n\n2014-02-01\n\nFull Text Available Background: Human papilloma virus (HPV is regarded as the main cause in the etiology of cervical cancer. The purpose of our study is to assess the knowledge of medical students about HPV vaccine and to evaluate their opinion on this subject. Â Â Material and Method: The study population consisted of 488 medical students. The survey was composed of questions intendedÂ Â to obtain information about transmission route of HPV, types of HPV, role of HPV in cervical cancer, whether HPV is treatable or not, which types of HPV the HPV vaccine prevents, the age groups HPV vaccine is administered, the opinions on HPV vaccine and sufficiency of public health, whether female students have underwent vaccination and if not what their drawbacks are.Â Â Results: Mean age of the students participating in the study was 21Â±4 and 58 % of the patients were female. Out of 448 medical students, 60% of them did not know that HPV was a sexually transmitted disease. Only 55% students knew about the association of HPV with cervical cancer and 52% participants stated that HPV vaccine could not be preventive against cervical cancer. None of female students had been immunized and 67% of female students did not consider getting immunized. Among those who did not consider getting immunized, 70% said they had worries about the safety of the vaccine.Â Conclusion: Our study results revealed that the knowledge of medical students about HPV is satisfactory, however their knowledge about HPV vaccine, immunization status and desire to be immunized were little.\n\nOsmanlÄ±âda Bir Darbe ve Tahlili: GenÃ§ Osman ÃrneÄi A Coup in Ottoman Empire And Its Analysis: GenÃ§ Osman Example\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHasan YAÅAROÄLU\n\n2013-09-01\n\nFull Text Available The New Order (Nizam-Ä± Cedit movements started in period of Selim The third (III. Selim of Otttoman sultans, is an important step taken toward westernization. Some sultans in last period of Ottoman Empire have also strived to take similar steps. There are records of initiation for reform movements even during period of Mustafa The Third (III. Mustafa, father of Selim The Third (III. Selim. When we went back to more in time, The Lale Devri (The Tulip Period emerges. The Tulip Period (Lale Devri despite the term being at the forefront of pleasure and deligth, some steps have been taken at this time in the direction of the westernization/renewal. The period of Sultan Osman The Second (II Osman forms the first steps taken toward renewal. Unfortunately, an uprising movement has ended the mentioned period above. Both this first Ottoman innovation movement and the first Ottoman insurrection that terminated the innovation are of importance in terms of being sample for the next ones. After these events, most of the reform movements, which emerged in the Ottoman Empire, have shared the same fate as GenÃ§ Osman reform movement.Upon his uncle Mustafa The First (I. Mustafa being jailed, GenÃ§ Osman (Young Othman became the Ottoman Sultan, but Othman has soon attracted the wrath of Janissaries and the Ulema due to his tough attitude. This hatred increased in time when Sultan Othman personally assumed the supreme commander in chief of army and decided to go to Mecca for pilgimage and eventually turned into a rebellion. The coup that was started under the leadership of Janissary and Sipahi units, and the rebels, strengthened the next day with the participation of scholars, relied on the Palaceâs door to inform their demands. GenÃ§ Osman (Young Othman initially rejected the demands of the rebels, but he but was unable to sustain his attitude over the time.

In this paper, a three-term conjugate gradient method is proposed for unconstrained optimization which always satisfies sufficient descent direction and namely as Three-Term Rivaie-Mustafa-Ismail-Leong (TTRMIL). Under standard conditions, TTRMIL method is proved to be globally convergent under strong-Wolfe line search. Finally, numerical results are provided for the purpose of comparison.\n\nA Rare Cause of Acute Abdomen: Diagnosis and Management of Adult Colonic Intussusception.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSertkaya, Mehmet; Emre, Arif; Pircanoglu, EyÃ¼p Mehmet; Yazar, Fatih Mehmet; Tepe, Murat; Cengiz, Emrah; Isler, Ali; Vicdan, Halit\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIntussusception in adults is very rarely seen, and this cause acute abdomen. A computed tomography (CT) scan, clinical suspicion, history, and a physical examination are important for the diagnosis. We present two cases of colonic intussusceptions induced by lipoma. The cases had similar locations, diagnoses, and management. Both lipomas were located close to the cecum in the ascending colon, and a right segmental colon resection was performed in both cases. The follow-up of both cases was uneventful. Although benign lesions can cause colonic intussusception, the high incidence of malignancy in colonic lesions should always be considered. Therefore, oncologic surgical procedures should be applied. The definitive diagnosis can be made by histopathology. Sertkaya M, Emre A, Pircanoglu EM, Yazar FM, Tepe M, Cengiz E, Isler A, Vicdan H.

The central question which the authors try to answer concerns the contribution of positron spectroscopy to the knowledge and understanding of the new high temperature superconducting oxides. They find that in these oxides also, partially filled bands exist and they can observe parts of their Fermi surface and measure lifetimes in accordance with band theoretical calculations. There are characteristic differences, however. The intensity of the anisotropy of the ACAR signal is below theoretical expectation and signals depend on sample preparation. Recent studies by the Geneva group have concerned dependence of the signals on impurities, on oxygen content and on the thermal history of preparation. Of particular interest are correlations between the variations of these signals and between the variations of structural and transport properties in these substances. Besides deliberate additions of impurities, the Geneva group also reports progress in the preparations of samples of highest purity (barium zirconate crucibles). The alloy series Pr x Y 1-x Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7-Î´ is of special interest because of exceptional transport properties. The recent positron results on these materials will be presented and commented in the light of theoretical models and in the light of the reported superconductivity of the Pr-compound\n\nAtividade pesqueira dos Ã­ndios Mura no Lago AyapuÃ¡, Baixo Rio Purus, Amazonas, Brasil\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nArtur Bicelli Coimbra, M.Sc.\n\n2017-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The artisanal fisheries has great importance forthe Amazonian indigenous communities, as a form of subsistence, and for the cultural and tradition of these communities.

Tokai Research Establishment\n\n2003-03-01\n\nPositron annihilation experiments on Fe-Cu model dilute alloys of nuclear reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steels have been performed after neutron irradiation in JMTR. Nanovoids whose inner surfaces were covered by Cu atoms were clearly observed. The nanovoids transformed to ultrafine Cu precipitates by dissociating their vacancies after annealing at around 400degC. The nanovoids and the ultrafine Cu precipitates are strongly suggested to be responsible for irradiation-induced embrittlement of RPV steels. Effects of Ni, Mn and P addition on the nanovoid and Cu precipitate formations were also studied. The nanovoid formation was enhanced by Ni and P, but suppressed by Mn. The Cu precipitates after annealing around 400degC were almost free from these doping elements and hence were pure Cu in the chemical composition. Furthermore the Fermi surface of the 'embedded' Cu precipitates with a body centered cubic crystal structure was obtained from two dimensional angular correlation of annihilation radiation (2D-ACAR) in a Fe-Cu single crystal and was agreed well with that from a band structure calculation. Theoretical calculation of positron confinement in Fe-Cu model alloys showed that a positron quantum dot state induced by positron affinity is attained for the embedded precipitates larger than 1 nm. A new position sensitive detector with a function of one dimensional angular correlation of annihilation radiation (1D-ACAR) has been developed that enables high resolution experiments over wide ranges of momentum distribution.
