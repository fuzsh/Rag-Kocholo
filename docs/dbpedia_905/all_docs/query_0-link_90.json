She likes to travel, both for pleasure and business, and can often be found exploring cities and hotspots around the world. Carole has homes in Essex and the Mediterranean, and ‘commutes’ between the two, along with travelling the world on assignments. Turkey, and especially the cultural city of Istanbul, is one of her favourite destinations. Carole is married with stepchildren and enjoys nothing more than family holidays. Acknowledgements\n\nDespite knowing Turkey, its tourist attractions and its lifestyle, undertaking the research for a book such as Turkey With Your Family and ensuring all the information it contains is bang up-to-date is a massive task, especially for a country the size of Turkey. It could so easily have sunk without the unstinting help of so many people. My thanks go to Mark Henshall at John Wiley & Sons for his trust in me to produce a book that will appeal to so many families around the world, and to his colleagues Fiona Quinn and Jill Emeny for their help and support during the project. In Turkey, the help given to me by so many knowledgeable and unflappable people in tourist offices everywhere is so greatly appreciated. There are so many to mention that the acknowledgements section in this book could easily comprise several pages. My special thanks, however, go to Hulya Soylu and Ceyda Sara Pekenc for their passionate approach to helping me with information and advice about their country, to Vedat Aritan and Sirma Kurtogullari Ongen who made my time spent in Istanbul and the surrounding area so very memorable and helpful to the book, to Vildan Özkan in Antalya for his local knowledge of the Aegean and Mediterranean regions, and to Buket Sarioinglu in Izmir, Özlem Dervis and Ti Dogn for their knowledge of the Anatolia region and to Lara Otru for her knowledge of Turkish attractions that would appeal so well to young visitors. Murat Özbayrak and Lucinda Peters have an eye for even the smallest mistake, in Turkish and English respectively, and my most sincere thanks go to them for their spot on proofreading skills, and to making sure the book contains no utterly unhelpful gobbledy-gook. My thanks go to my husband Eddie for his companionship during my research trips, his unending moral support during the preparation\n\nv\n\nof the book and for supplying me with a steady stream of coffee during hours of writing. And finally, my thanks go to you all, the readers of Turkey With Your Family. I hope you enjoy visiting Turkey and experiencing its lifestyle, its awesome history and its many fascinating sights and sounds as much as I do.\n\nAn Additional Note\n\nPlease be advised that travel information is subject to change at any time and this is especially true of prices.

Children are T especially welcomed in Turkey, even admired. A walk through a bazaar urkey has long been a popular holiday destination,\n\nor around an historic site will almost inevitably prompt passers-by to talk to, pick up or maybe stroke the hair of the youngsters in the family. For many of us, this can be more than a tad alarming in these safety-conscious times, but providing the usual precautions are observed and the practice of admiring children acknowledged as being part of the local culture, such over-zealousness by complete strangers shouldn’t spoil a trip. However, with this in mind, there aren’t as many dedicated attractions for children as you would expect, although more and more theme parks, children’s zoos and playgrounds are starting to emerge, especially along the coastlines of the Aegean and the Mediterranean. One of the top theme parks is Miniaturk in Istanbul, where many of Turkey’s most historic sights can be seen in miniature. There are also several aquaparks, such as the sprawling Atlantis Waterpark in Marmaris in the Aegean region, and sealife parks like Dolphinarium at Kemer in the Mediterranean region, where children can swim with dolphins. Many hotels and accommodation complexes have their own theme parks and playgrounds tucked away within their grounds, too, along with a full programme of supervised events. Turkey is a diverse country with high mountains and valleys, coastal regions and inland forests, traditional villages and cosmopolitan cities, such as Ankara and Istanbul. Along the Mediterranean coast holiday hotspots include Antalya, Side, Dalyan and Adana, all bustling resorts, along with the sophisticated Bodrum on the Aegean, which has its own airport and is especially popular with families that like to sail. To the north of the country, the Black Sea has the resorts of Amasra, Trabzon and Sinop, among many others. All have their own characters, and offer much for adults and children of all ages to see and do. Inland, there is the lively city of Ankara and the extraordinary ‘Fairy Chimney’ landscape of Cappadocia. Other family favourites are visiting some of the outstanding historic buildings that Turkey is especially proud of, such as the great Topkapi Palace or the Blue Mosque in Istanbul, and ancient sites like those at Çanakkale, Ephesus, Pergamum, Hierapolis, Safranbolu and Trabzon, or heading off to the coast and spending time on the country’s fine beaches. The beaches on the Mediterranean and Aegean are ideal for young children. There are seemingly endless opportunities to sail and follow nature trails, dinghy sail, ski, whitewater raft, play golf, horse-ride and even dive. In fact, Turkey has some of the best diving waters in the eastern Mediterranean. Families can also enjoy the lively street theatre found in some of the larger towns, along with music and dance festivals often held\n\nTURKEY FAMILY HIGHLIGHTS Istanbul Attending some of the events\n\nthat take place in Istanbul on 23rd April to mark International Children’s Day, a celebration that is recognised by UNICEF.

Among them are donkey rides out in the country, cycling and whitewater rafting, mud baths and thermal springs, aquaparks, dolphin parks where they can swim with dolphins, festivals and beaches and excursions to places like Santa Claus’s birthplace at Myra in the Mediterranean region. You can also go to Pamukkale on the border of the Aegean and the Mediterranean regions to see the Travertine Cascades, and to historic sites throughout the country. With this in mind, you will probably earmark the area you wish to stay and then find out more about the nearby tourist attractions that will appeal to children. The Aegean and Mediterranean regions are very much family-orientated, but there are some wonderful things to see and do with your family in the cities of Istanbul and Ankara. The Marmara region sits around the Sea of Marmara and affords some beautiful beaches, while the Black Sea region has beautiful natural parks and vast areas inland such as Cappadocia.\n\nTHE REGIONS IN BRIEF Istanbul – Chapter 3 Although not the capital of Turkey (that privilege lies with Ankara), Istanbul has been an important city for centuries. When it was known as Constantinople, it was integral to the Byzantine Empire and later became the capital of the Ottoman Empire. Today, it is where Europe meets Asia, and is a lively, cosmopolitan city with many attractions for visitors to see. Among them are the Suleymaniye Mosque, the lavish Dolmabahçe Palace, Topkapi Palace that exhibits emeralds almost the size of a child’s hand, the great Sultan Ahmet Camii (the Blue Mosque) and the Aya\n\nThe Regions in Brief\n\nbut absolutely huge. Much of its tourist industry revolves around holiday complexes that offer famiT lies on-site amenities such as playgrounds, watersports, horse-riding\n\nSofya (Haghia Sophia), which older children will find fascinating. Younger ones may appreciate the Miniaturk Park, the outstanding Toy Museum, the excitement of the Grand Bazaar, the Feshane Children’s Entertainment Park and a cruise along the Bosphorus River far more.\n\nThe Marmara Region – Chapter 4 The region radiates pretty much from Istanbul with lots of towns and cities to see. It surrounds the Sea of Marmara. To the northwest of the sea, the town of Tekirdag is ideal for families who love to spend some time on the beach, along with Edirne, which is often described as a living museum, and the resort of Kirklareli, which all make up the\n\n31\n\n2 Planning a Family Trip to Turkey\n\nTrakya area. All are surrounded by fields of sunflowers – the area is known for them. Along the opposite ‘coastline’ of the sea there’s Çanakkale, forever linked with Homer’s legendary Trojan Horse, along with the towns of Iznik, Bursa, Bilecik in the Sakarya River Valley and Yalova, famed for its natural springs. The Marmara region has some outstanding beaches, along with one of Turkey’s major ski resorts and parklands to explore.\n\nThe Aegean Region – Chapter 5\n\n32\n\nThe Aegean region, with the Mediterranean, is where most holidaymakers from Europe head for if they want beautiful beaches combined with outstanding attractions to see. It has a string of Blue Flag beaches along its coastline, including the protected Iztuzu beach which is a nesting ground for the endangered caretta caretta turtle and the sandy bay of Ölü Deniz, probably the most photographed bay in this part of the world. Its major towns and cities include Ayvalik and Bergama on the southern coast of Edremit Bay, the popular Çe@me, Selçuk, an important religious and tourist town, Izmir and the holiday resorts of Ku@adasi, Bodrum, Marmaris, Altinkum and Dalaman. The region is also home to the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus and King Mausoleus’s Tomb in Bodrum, two of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.\n\nThe Mediterranean Region – Chapter 6 The major towns and cities of Antalya, Alanya, Side, Belek, Kemer and Adana lie in the Mediterranean region of Turkey. The Taurus Mountains, which dominate the area, along with the historical sites of Perge, Kekova Island and Myra, said to be the birthplace of St Nicholas, or Santa Claus, are just waiting to be explored by your little ones. The region, which stretches from the Patara and Fethiye areas right along the southernmost coast to Hatay where it nudges the South East Anatolia region, has numerous activities for children to enjoy, from aquaparks, swimming with dolphins and festivals to sports such as canoeing and sailing.\n\nThe Black Sea Region – Chapter 7 Although one of the largest of the regions in Turkey, the Black Sea area leans more towards natural experiences than theme parks and sports centres. For instance, children can enjoy walks, nature trails and watersports in places such as the Ilgaz National Park near Kastamonu. The region is dotted with mountains, alpine lakes and tiny villages. Characterised by its hazelnut orchards and tea plantations, it runs along the northernmost coast from Akçakoca to the west to the city of Artvin, passing Amasra, Sinop, Rize, Ünye and Ordu along the way. The\n\nAnkara & the Anatolia Region – Chapter 8 Ankara is the capital of Turkey and as such is a lively, cultural and cosmopolitan city. It also has a large population, and because children are so important to the Turkish people, many theme parks and attractions have been specially created for them. The Anatolia region is vast and comprises mainly huge areas of mountains and countryside, dotted by towns and villages. Its most famous region is Cappadocia, where the extraordinary rock formations around the villages of Göreme, Ürgüp and Derinkuyu, known as the ‘Fairy Chimneys’, and its hundreds of underground cities, have secured it a place on the world tourist map.\n\nVISITOR INFORMATION Useful Websites There are a number of websites to help you as you prepare your itinerary.

Intercity buses are generally modern and it is relatively easy to carry a buggy on and off. The main bus companies are: Kâmil Koç, Istanbul b +90 212 658 20 00; 50 00\n\nBursa b +90 242 261\n\nUlusoy, Istanbul b +90 212 471 71 00, www.ulusoy.com.tr Varan, Istanbul b +90 212 251 74 74, www.varan.com.tr\n\nEach town has its own bus station (otogar) where bus companies have their own office, but information can be obtained from the head offices for all routes. Route information and timetables are available from these offices, the tourist information offices or by telephone or Internet. Another popular form of transport in some of the larger towns and cities is the dolmu@. Again, locals use it because it is inexpensive and each one follows specific routes, albeit to a loose timetable. The idea is that if you see one you can hail it and, once aboard, you can ask the driver to stop wherever you wish along his or her route. Dolmu@ buses can be quite small and space is likely to be limited, so if you have buggies and equipment, they won’t be terribly comfortable or convenient. For a little more than double the price you would pay for a bus, you can hail a taxi in most towns and cities. In Istanbul you can’t help but see the bright orange taxis right outside the airport arrivals terminal or the yellow ones that are everywhere in the city. Even city dwellers use the taxis. All the taxis have a meter, so be sure that the driver has switched it on as you begin your journey. If you are planning to travel by taxi beyond the boundaries of a major town or city, it is advisable to agree a rate in advance.\n\nEssentials\n\nand it is compulsory to wear a seatbelt. The highways in Turkey around Istanbul, Ankara and the network around Izmir are to a high standard, but elsewhere, particularly smaller ‘scenic’ routes, the roads can be in a poor state of repair so be on your guard against having an accident. The accident rate in Turkey is considered high compared with other countries. If you are planning to drive while in Turkey, either a hire car or your own, you can do so on a full British or International Driving Licence. Provisional driving licences are not recognised in Turkey. Do not speed while driving and do not drink and drive. There is a 50km per hour speed limit within urban centres and 90km outside urban centres. The police have the power to breathalyse, demand an ‘on the spot’ fine or confiscate your driving licence if you are over the drink limit.\n\nBy Train The rail network is\n\noperated by the Turkish State 35\n\n2 Planning a Family Trip to Turkey\n\nRailway (TCDD. www.tcdd.gov. tr).\n\nAlmost all start and finish at Istanbul, leaving from Haydarpa@a Station (b +90 216 336 04 75) and Sires Station (b +90 212 527 0050) at regular intervals. The trains link Ankara and the main cities in the Black Sea, Marmara and Aegean regions. There are a few express routes, the most notable of which is the Haydarpa@a–Adapazarı service that runs regularly from Istanbul and stops at various stations in the region. In the major cities such as Istanbul there is also a light railway network and trams, which connect the main areas such as Sirkeci Station, right in the heart of the city at Eminönü, the location of the Bosphorus cruise trips, with Taksim Square and Sultanahmet Square. A similar service is operated in Ankara. The southwest of the country is not served by rail because of the mountainous terrain.\n\nEntry Requirements & Customs\n\nmarked ‘Visa’ before you go through Passport Control. You can buy a visa on presentation of your passport. It lasts 90 days and costs £10 sterling, although more if you go to a consulate. Alternatively, you can go to the Turkish Consulate General in London (www.turkishconsulate. org.uk) or Turkish Diplomatic Missions in other countries to obtain one prior to travelling. The visa takes the form of a sticker that is stuck to a page in your passport. If there is more than one person travelling on a passport, such as is often the case with a family, then each person is liable for the fee. The visa is intended for leisure travel only. While travelling in Turkey you should carry your passport as a means of identification, although take care to safeguard it against theft. Turks have compulsory ID cards, which they must carry with them at all times and foreigners are expected to carry ID. A photocopy of your passport is acceptable. Make sure you have at least six months’ validity remaining on your passport before you travel as you could be refused entry otherwise.\n\nPassports & Visas\n\n36\n\nBritish and many other worldwide passport holders will need a visa to enter and subsequently travel around Turkey. It can be obtained on landing at your chosen airport or port of entry. For instance, at Istanbul’s Atatürk Havalimani International Airport (www.ataturkairport.com) simply look out for the kiosks\n\nCustoms – Arriving in Turkey & Going Home\n\nThere are restrictions on what you can bring into Turkey as well as what you can take home with you. Coming in you are permitted to bring no more than 200 cigarettes and 50 cigars, plus 200 grams of tobacco with you,\n\nLocal Laws\n\nTurkey has local laws that should be obeyed. For instance, it is considered an offence to show disrespect to the country, its flag or its currency. You\n\nshould not use metal detectors, remove antiques or antiquities, or take photographs near official or military areas. You should also carry some form of ID with you at all times: a photocopy of each of your family’s passports is acceptable. You or any member of your family should not consume forbidden drugs.\n\nEssentials\n\nalthough you can purchase a further 200 cigarettes, 100 cigars and 500 grams of tobacco in the Turkish Duty Free Shops on arrival. You can also bring two 75cl bottles of wine or spirits, a 120ml bottle of cologne or perfume and restricted amounts of coffee and confectionery (1.5kg coffee and 1kg confectionery). If you are planning to bring valuable items with you, such as expensive jewellery, a large number of electronic items or sports goods, then these should be declared on entry. There is no limit to the amount of foreign and Turkish currency you can bring into Turkey, but you are restricted on the amount you can take out. It must also be proved to have been exchanged legally. Going home you are limited in what you can take back because Turkey is not a member of the EU. If you are planning to purchase expensive items like jewellery or carpets during your stay, you will need to keep the receipt and pay for items using legally exchanged money. You may not under any circumstances take any antiques out of Turkey, or bring or take out any forbidden drugs. It is advisable to carry a note from your doctor if you or any member of your family is travelling with prescribed drugs.\n\nMoney The Turkish Lira\n\nThe currency of Turkey is the new Turkish lira (YTL) and it comes in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 kuru@ and 1 YTL coins, and 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 YTL notes. The current exchange rate is around 2.50 YTL to the pound, and 1.31 YTL to the US dollar, although these, of course, change daily. For currency rates and easy online conversions visit www.xe. com. Conversion rates are published daily in Turkish newspapers and at banks too. In Turkey there are exchange offices in the airports and in the centre of major towns and cities. Some banks and many hotels will change money too. If possible, do check in advance if your notes will be accepted. For example, Scottish notes are not accepted in Turkey. Sterling, dollars and euros definitely are. You can exchange money to take with you before travelling to Turkey, but if you are planning to exchange Turkish liras back into your own currency before departure, you are required to declare this to customs officers. 37\n\n2 Planning a Family Trip to Turkey\n\nCredit & Debit Cards\n\nCredit cards, such as Visa and MasterCard, are generally accepted in the larger town and city shops and restaurants, although cash is more usual in smaller establishments. Always use cash when bartering in a bazaar or visiting remote villages and craft centres. Not only is it unlikely that credit cards will be accepted, but you should also be able to haggle for a better price with cash. Always let your credit card company know you are travelling to Turkey before you go so that they are not alerted to an unusual spending pattern and put a block on the card. Also be sure to have the emergency contact number for your credit and debit cards with you for use in the event of lost or stolen cards. Traveller’s Cheques & ATMs\n\n38\n\nIf you are planning to carry traveller’s cheques with you, perhaps as a back up if you can’t find an ATM, you will find that you can only exchange them in banks or major post offices. You will need some form of identification with you. Most major banks do have ATMs so obtaining cash is relatively straightforward. The machines accept most credit and debit cards and you will have the option to request instructions in English. The airports have banks and ATMs too. If you are planning to venture further afield into rural Turkey be sure to take enough cash with you for any likely expenditure, as it may be\n\ntrickier exchanging money or finding an ATM in smaller towns and villages.\n\nWhen to Go The most popular family holiday destinations are the Aegean and Mediterranean, followed by the Marmara and the Black Sea regions. All have beaches and waters for children to enjoy, but their climates can vary enormously. The south of the country, for instance, will be much warmer throughout the year than the north. The Mediterranean and the south Aegean regions enjoy long, hot summers and mild winters, while the north Aegean and Marmara region have a similar climate, albeit with a slightly shorter summer period. The Black Sea region has warm summers and mild winters with a high level of rainfall that gives it its characteristic green, lush look. Inland, summers can be exceptionally hot, although cooler in mountainous areas. Winters can get bitterly cold, often with high levels of snowfall. Istanbul tends to attract ‘city breakers’ and the climate is usually temperate and pleasant most of the year for sightseeing. Public Holidays\n\nPublic holidays are special events in Turkey and most people will take the day off to be with their family. Some are determined by the government while others are religious. You may find a few supermarkets open in tourist\n\ntake part in exciting races. The event has a festival atmosphere (see p. 122).\n\nNew Year’s Day – 1st January\n\nThe Children’s Summer Festival, held in Feshane\n\nSacrifice Festival – January National Sovereignty and International Children’s Day –\n\n23rd April Atatürk Commemoration and Youths and Sports Festival –\n\n19th May Victory Day – 30th August Republic Day – October Feast of Ramazan – October\n\nSpecial Events\n\nMany special festivities take place around the country that are ideal for children. International Children’s Day is a public holiday. Children are recognised as being the future of the country, a thought that prompted Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the Turkish Republic, to declare 23rd April International Children’s Day. Every year a week-long programme of events such as exhibitions, festivals and ceremonies is held throughout the country. Children even replace high-ranking government officials from the President, Prime Minister and governors downwards for the day. The Bodrum Cup’s International Wooden Yacht Regatta in Bodrum attracts fam-\n\nilies keen to either sail themselves or watch the wooden sailing ships\n\nEssentials\n\nareas, but generally the shops, any service buildings and banks will be closed.\n\nChildren’s Entertainment Park in Istanbul every summer (see p. 61), is another good event. Schools from around the city host festivals and events aimed specifically at children. The Dernek Festivals, another\n\nfavourite family event, take place in various towns and cities, notably Trabzon in the Black Sea region. Families and friends gather for a feast, dancing and lots of traditional music. It is usually held towards the end of July. Visitors, especially those with children, are welcomed at almost any festival or event. The Troy Festival is held every\n\nAugust at Çanakkale in the Marmara region. Schoolchildren release a white dove from a Trojan Horse – a mighty wooden structure that celebrates the battles with the Trojans at Troy (see p. 90).\n\nWhat to Pack Always take plenty of sun cream and hats as the coastal areas and central Anatolia can get extremely hot in the summer months. If staying in the Aegean, Marmara or Mediterranean regions in summertime you will need light cotton clothes for everyone in the family and perhaps a wrap or cardigan for putting over your shoulders in the evening. In\n\n39\n\n2 Planning a Family Trip to Turkey 40\n\nspring and autumn you are likely to need a jumper, and in winter a coat. The other areas can get chilly even in summer so be sure to pack plenty of warmer clothes as well as your beachwear and swimwear. It’s a good idea to pack some sun-resistant beachwear for tiny children too. If you are planning to spend lots of time on the beach think about some sort of protection like a shield, umbrella or a tent. If you’re planning to visit mosques or religious buildings during your stay, remember that it is polite to dress modestly. Women should cover shoulders and arms and not wear short skirts or shorts, and men should wear long trousers and a shirt. The same applies to children. Remember, too, to take party clothes for when you attend some of the festivities and special events. Your youngsters will love the chance to dress up. If you have babies or very young children you will also need to think about things like nappies, baby wipes, nappy cream and special foodstuffs. Most of the major towns and cities have good supermarket facilities so you should be able to find what you need, but take a few things to get you through the first couple of days until you have become orientated. In terms of baby formula food, brands may differ from those your baby is familiar with at home, so it might be a good idea to take some with you. Sterilising bottles shouldn’t be a problem if you are staying in\n\nself-catering holiday accommodation where you can follow the same principles as you would at home, while hotels in Turkey are almost always helpful to anyone with children and will assist if you need their cooperation to boil water or use a microwave. Supermarkets in Turkey don’t always stock baby food in jars, as it is more traditional to prepare such food in the home. For visiting families this can be a problem, but you should find most restaurants and hotels are only too happy to purée food from the menu for you if needed. Other things to think about when packing are reins for strapping toddlers into seats in restaurants, and a buggy for when you are out and about. If you are planning to visit historic sites, or even just explore towns where pavements can be damaged, remember surfaces can be uneven so a sturdy buggy is preferable to a lightweight version. If you are hiring a car, always request a car seat and check that it is suitable for the age of your child and that it is undamaged.\n\nInsurance & Health Travel Insurance\n\nTurkey has few reciprocal agreements with other countries so if you have the unfortunate need for medical treatment while you are in Turkey you will be required to pay for the treatment you receive. For this reason it is essential to have travel and medical insurance. You will need to pay for your\n\nStaying Healthy Inoculations\n\nPrior to travelling to Turkey it is recommended that you have a few basic inoculations, especially if you are planning to venture into rural areas. Be aware that Bird Flu, or Avian Influenza, has been reported in Turkey. The usual inoculations are polio, typhoid, tetanus and diphtheria, and possibly hepatitis A and B, but always take your doctor’s advice, especially if your children are babies or very young. Staying hydrated\n\nAlways drink plenty, especially if you are staying in the Aegean, Mediterranean and inland areas during the hot summer months, as it is easy to get dehydrated. Children always seem to have a preference for fizzy drinks, and although they are good for a\n\ncertain level of rehydrating and maintaining sugar levels, be sure you and your children take in lots of water. If you are unsure on how much water is enough to keep your babies, toddlers or older children hydrated in Turkey’s often extreme temperatures, be sure to take your doctor’s advice before you travel. Although tap water is generally safe to drink because it is chlorinated, you may prefer to drink bottled water. Supermarkets, grocery stores and kiosks all sell bottled water cheaply.\n\nEssentials\n\ntreatment upfront, and claim back your expenses from your insurers. Be sure to keep all receipts and documentation. Make sure when you take out a policy that the insurance covers you for both emergency treatment and repatriation costs, as well as the usual lost baggage and money, and cancellation expenses, although some credit cards will cover these too so, again, it is worth checking before you leave home. Also check that your travel insurance covers you should you need to pull out of a trip before departure, something that can and does happen when travelling with children.\n\nCare with fruit, ice cream & ice\n\nSimilarly, supermarkets sell fruit, which is generally safe to eat because, in all likelihood, it will have been washed in chlorinated water. However, for extra reassurance and to avoid any stomach upsets, always wash it again before you or your children eat it. Consuming ice cubes or ice creams can be a hazard in all very hot countries. Although ice cubes will probably again have been made with chlorinated water, to be extra safe, try making your own using bottled water. Try to avoid ‘homemade’ ice cream – it is probably safest to stay with brands, which are readily available, especially in the tourist areas of the Aegean and the Mediterranean, the Marmara region and Istanbul. Sun protection\n\nAnother hazard is the sun. Always wear plenty of high-factor sun protection cream, and if your children like to swim or go 41\n\n2 Planning a Family Trip to Turkey\n\nin and out of the sea or pools, be sure the cream is waterproof. Reapply often. Mosquito protection\n\nMosquitoes are another hazard. Although unlikely to cause any serious medical problems to anyone other than those allergic to their bites, mosquitoes can be annoying and a repellent should be used. Malaria as a result of experiencing a mosquito bite in Turkey is not regarded a hazard at this time, although of course this can change. The UK Department of Health’s free leaflet Health Advice for Travellers (b 0800 555 7777 or visit www.hpa.org.uk) is a good source of information. Prescribed medication\n\nIf you or anyone in your family takes prescribed medication it is wise to take details of the generic name of the medicine as well as the brand name with you in case the brand isn’t available, plus a copy of the prescription. This is in case you lose or need to replenish the medication while you are away. Be sure to pack your medication in your hand luggage, not only for your flight but in case your baggage goes missing. Staying Safe\n\nYou will find that Turkish people adore children and it is not uncommon for someone to reach out and pat your child’s head. While this can be unnerving, it is unlikely to be a threat. 42\n\nAs with any travel, always be sure your children are in sight at all times, especially if visiting crowded places like bazaars. Hold young children’s hands tightly or keep them in a buggy. If visiting beaches, always be on your guard against the usual dangers such as a toddler wandering to the sea, and if visiting remote areas always have a good supply of drinks and snacks with you, plus a mobile telephone. While incidents of crime are relatively low in Turkey, you should be on your guard. Petty crime has been known to occur in crowded places. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (www.fco. com) also warns that there is a high risk of terrorist activity in Istanbul and the southeast areas of Turkey, but even the Aegean and Mediterranean areas have been targeted in the past. The FCO states, however, that despite around 1.7 million British tourists alone visiting Turkey a year, most visits are trouble-free so there is no need to panic. Foreign Commonwealth Office: You can find plenty of\n\nadvice on the website about safety in each country, what to prepare and also advice on being a responsible tourist. You can also register your trip on the website so that if anything happens while you are away, they can try and locate you.

Rural practices or hospitals may not, however. A list of hospitals in Turkey can be found on the British Consulate website (www.britishembassy.gov.uk). All hospitals will provide emergency dental treatment as well as dealing with medical emergencies. For minor problems, most pharmacies are run by trained pharmacists who can dispense medicines.

Hotels usually offer direct dial telephones in guestrooms, although making calls can be expensive. Check the rates your hotel charges. The booths are often busy and you will need to purchase a phonecard (jetons). They come in denominations of 30, 60, 100, 120 and 180 YTL, and are available from post offices and many kiosks. Main post offices are generally open from Mon–Sat 8.30am– 12.30pm and 1.30pm–5.30pm, Sun 9am–7pm. Smaller post offices will be open on weekdays only. Some smaller post offices in tourist areas will open every day. Post offices are easily identified by their PTT or Turk Telekom signage. As well as telephone cards, among the services offered by post offices are fax, sending and receiving letters and money exchange. 43\n\n2 Planning a Family Trip to Turkey\n\nTo call overseas, first dial 00 for international followed by the country code, followed by the area code and then the private number.\n\nIzmir b 232\n\nRize b 464\n\nKastamonu b 366\n\nSamsun b 362\n\nAustralia b 61\n\nMugla b 252\n\nCanada b 1\n\nOrdu b 452\n\nSinop b 368 Tekirdag b 282 Trabzon b 462 Yalova b 226\n\nIreland b 353\n\nMobile Phones New Zealand b 64 South Africa b 27 UK b 44 USA b 1 International operator b 115 Directory assistance b 118\n\nTo dial Turkey from abroad, the international dialling code is 90. Most phone numbers listed in this guide have the international dialling code for you to dial when using your own mobile phone. If telephoning within Turkey from a Turkish phone, you will need just the area code with a ‘0’ in front and the private number. For example, if dialling Adana locally, dial 0322 and then the private number. The main area codes are: Adana b 322 Aksaray b 382 Amasya b 358 Ankara b 312 Antalya b 242 Artvin b 466 Balikesir b 266 Bursa b 224 44\n\nKirklareli b 288\n\nÇanakkale b 286 Edirne b 284 Fethiye b 252 Giresun b 454 Hatay b 326 Isparta b 246 Istanbul b 212\n\nMobile phones are now widespread in Turkey, with the main operator being Turkcell. If you have international roaming on your mobile phone you should have no problem making and receiving calls and texts. Having a mobile with you is essential if exploring off the beaten track or in one of the large national parks dotted around Turkey with children. You never know when you may need to get help. Always check with your mobile phone provider before you go to ensure you will be able to use it while in Turkey. Telephoning Turkey\n\nIf telephoning Turkey from outside the country you will need to dial 00 for an international connection, followed by 90, the country code, then the area code below and the private number. Internet Access\n\nInternet access and WiFi is largely confined to hotels offering business services and guestroom connection, although more and more Internet cafes are springing up in the major cities and the tourist areas. Charges in the hotels are usually in line with rates charged to use a guestroom\n\ncity centres and tourist attractions, or in natural parks or in ski areas, but also many that are not. By asking you can make an informed decision about what is best for your family and their preferred holiday activities.\n\nACCOMMODATION, EATING OUT & ENTERTAINMENT\n\nEating Out\n\nAccommodation Turkey has accommodation to suit most travellers, from holiday complexes with every amenity for families to campsites and city centre business hotels. Even the latter, however, provide amenities for children. In Turkey children are welcomed more or less everywhere. Typically, hotels and complexes will offer playgrounds and children’s clubs, private aquaparks, swimming pools specifically for children and tiny tots, special menus in their restaurants and safety and security amenities like high chairs, cots, special ch"
