I dedicate this book to the memory of my father, from whom I inherited the joy of imagining, learning and sharing.\n\nPreface Are you aware of the danger? 1\n\nFear is the underlying characteristic of secularism in Turkey. This is the fear of “reactionary Islam” (irtica) or, put differently, the fear of either a creeping or violent radical Islamism. If secularism has been transformed into a discourse which is internalized by large segments of society, this is because of the successful reproduction of this fear. The political and intellectual elite of Turkey have been generating it on the basis of a specific discourse on Islam which polarizes society into opposing groups of “bad Muslims” and “good Muslims” (Mamdani 2004). In public debates, this discourse is being reproduced through a particular use of the past, which fosters a state of permanent battle with and fear of “bad Muslims”. This fear often leads secularist citizens of all professions, including university professors and top judges, to join forces with the top commanders of the army to protect the secular regime by gathering in Anıtkabir, the Mausoleum of the founder of the Republic Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (1881–1938) in Ankara. One of such gatherings was on 18 May 2006. Tens of thousands of people assembled at the Mausoleum on that day – one day after an unprecedented shooting in the Second Department of the Council of State (Danıştay), the country’s highest administrative court.2 The Turkish Daily News reported the gathering at the Mausoleum as follows: Chanting slogans and clapping their hands, some 25,000 people marched to the mausoleum in protest of the attack, which saw a lone gunman burst into a room at the Council of State, killing a senior judge and wounding four others. The demonstrators – from academics to municipal workers, from high school students to doctors – brandished portraits of Atatürk and placed flowers at the mausoleum, a building overlooking Ankara from a hill in the heart of the city. Some kissed the granite stones covering the tomb, while others prayed and wept as elementary school children sang national hymns. “Turkey is secular, it will remain secular”, the crowd shouted, their chants and claps echoing around Anıtkabir.3\n\nxi\n\nxii\n\nISLAM AND SECULARISM IN TURKEY\n\nThe mass protest against the violent attack took a secularist form because the event was reported by the media as a revenge action against the judges of the Council of State who had taken a decision supporting the ban on the use of the Islamic headscarf by state employees. The gunman, a lawyer, had fired at the judges – and had killed one of them – in order to punish them (as he was to say after his arrest) for their confirmation of a ruling that a teacher wearing a headscarf to and from school could not be the director of a stateowned kindergarten. The attack was reported by mainstream newspapers under headings such as “Bullet at Secularism” or referred to as “the September 11 of the Republic.”4 The Islamist newspaper, Anadolu’da Vakit, was accused of identifying targets for the gunman by publishing photos of the judges earlier in February 2006. Islamist intellectuals and journalists, on the other hand, denied these accusations and condemned the attack as a provocation. The incident also led to harsh accusations against Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi), which had earlier criticized the court ruling which upheld the headscarf ban.5 The use of Islamic headscarves in state institutions, as well as universities, had been framed by several court rulings as a statement against the constitutional principle of secularism and hence banned. Erdoğan’s Government, however, rejected the association of the Islamic headscarf with anti-secularism. Hence the mass protests following the attack against the Council of State were also directed against the Government. Since April 2009, the attack at the Council of State has been linked to the so called “Ergenokon” trial, which was launched in 2007, charging more than 200 suspects with forming an illegal organization to provoke a series of events in order to instigate a military coup. The Council of State attack gunman turned out to be in contact with some of the suspects of the Ergenekon trial.6 It is not yet clear whether the attack in 2006 was a radical Islamist action or a provocation intended to create unrest and in this way to pave the way for overthrowing the government. However, it was certainly an event which led to increasing social polarization on the issue of secularism and to an even deeper fear of Islamic fanaticism. At the Mausoleum, the symbolic center of the capital city Ankara, the fear and anger incited by the attack were transformed into an assertion of solidarity and commitment to protect the secular Republic of Atatürk from radical Islam. This spontaneous and emotional manifestation showed that Mustafa Kemal Atatürk continued to be seen as the embodiment of secularism almost seventy years after his death. Indeed, in the context of market-based modernity of the last two decades, “the privatization of the production, circulation, and consumption of Atatürk’s image” (Özyürek 2006: 94) intensified. The emotional and metaphysical aspects of such\n\nPREFACE\n\nxiii\n\nsecularist manifestations, which are centered on the veneration of Atatürk at his Mausoleum, can be seen as an unintended parallel between Islam and republican secularism (Navaro-Yashin 2002: 190–1, 201; van Bruinessen 2005; Tapper and Tapper 1987). As a matter of fact, secularism in Turkey was institutionalized along with the sacralization of state authority in the person of Atatürk and the reproduction of a ritualistic devotion to him. One can even argue, as Rustow did as early as 1957, that the “popular devotion to the charismatic figure of Mustafa Kemal” was to fill “the emotional void left by the surrender of so much of the Muslim heritage” (Rustow 1957: 80–1). Nonetheless, a deeper motivation behind the voluntary and active participation of the masses in the sacralization of the image of Atatürk as the embodiment of the secular regime remains unexplained. This book suggests that this motivation, which was also manifested at the Mausoleum of Atatürk in June 2006, is the fear of Islamic fanaticism. It argues that the stateimposed ideology of Kemalist secularism was gradually transformed into a civil ideology7 as a result of the reproduction and popularization of this fear by the political and intellectual elite. This book is about the reproduction of the fear of Islamic fanaticism, which is crucial for understanding Kemalist secularism. The latter has generated this fear since the early republican period, based on a specific discourse on Islam which opposes the Islam of “bad Muslims” to the Islam of “good Muslims” (Mamdani 2004). The following chapters explore the evolution of this Kemalist discourse on Islam and its attempts to differentiate fanatical Islam of “bad Muslims” from what is idealized as secular, Turkish Islam. This study approaches the analysis of secularism through a focus on its continuous reconstruction in public debates led by political leaders as well as intellectuals. It examines how political and intellectual leaders, the negotiators of the meaning of secularism, shaped secularism during the single-party regime (1923–46) and refashioned it in the first decades of the multi-party period (1946–66). The introductory chapter of the book provides the background to this analysis in outlining the history and particularity of secularism in Turkey. The main body of the book is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on the single-party period and includes two chapters analyzing the Kemalist discourse on Islam. Chapter 1 explores the initial crystallization of the Kemalist discourse on reactionary Islam (irtica). To this end, it examines the “Menemen Incident” of 1930, which was a local Islamic uprising againt the secular government. The exploration of the event shows how the threat of reactionary Islam was exaggerated and used for creating an emotional bond with the secular Republic. The chapter also shows the Kemalist regime’s attempt to mobilize popular support by institutionalizing the\n\nxiv\n\nISLAM AND SECULARISM IN TURKEY\n\ncommemoration of Kubilay, a young officer beheaded by the leaders of the rebellion, as the “Martyr of the Revolution”. Chapter 2 examines the Kemalist discourse on Turkish, or vernacular Islam, and its construction as an antidote to reactionary Islam. It explores this theme in relation to a forgotten reform of the Kemalist Government, which imposed the recitation of the Turkish translation of the call to prayer (ezan) and banned its original Arabic version in 1932. The second part of the book explores secularism in the first two decades of the multi-party period when the Republican People’s Party (Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi) of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was challenged by two right-wing political parties, the Democratic Party (Demokrat Parti) and its successor, the Justice Party (Adalet Partisi). These center-right parties revised Kemalist secularism and adopted an alternative discourse on secularism. In the context of relative democratization of the political sphere after 1946, the official ideology of Kemalist secularism began its true struggle for hegemony at the level of civil society. I contend that a specific politics of memory, conducted through the politically motivated and selective use, sacralization or oblivion of the past, has been a crucial tool in this struggle for hegemony. This politics of memory can be seen as the most important impediment to critical thinking and rational debate on the issue of secularism to this day. Both Kemalist and alternative discourses of secularism were developed during public debates conducted via the printed press. The empirical raw material of the case studies which are presented in each chapter therefore consists of public debates in selected episodes of crisis, as they were reflected in daily newspapers, weekly magazines and journals of the period. Each chapter shows how selected figures and events from the past have been invoked and contested during these public debates on secularism. The common assertion of all chapters is that the Kemalist discourse on Islam remained unchanged in the multi-party period, although actors (alleged “bad” or “good” Muslims) who were made to fill the two moulds of fanatical Islam and Turkish Islam varied in concrete historical settings. Chapter 3 discusses the public debate before and after the first regulation of the Democratic Party government – the removal of the ban on the recital of the Arabic call to prayer. It illustrates how different interpretations of this ban, either as restriction or guarantee of freedom of conscience, were reflections of two competing interpretations of secularism (Kemalist versus alternative). The following chapter focuses on the public debate triggered by the assassination attempt against the liberal, secularist journalist Ahmet Emin Yalman (1888–1972) in 1952. It explores the secularist perception of irtica and points to the politics of memory, constructing a parallel between this incident and earlier violent reactionary events such as the Menemen Incident.\n\nPREFACE\n\nxv\n\nThis chapter illustrates how the fear of violent Islamic reactionism was both responsible for and further stimulated by the emerging civil Kemalist secularism. It shows how the latter was articulated through the ideological wave of anti-communism, depicting reactionary Islam as a destructive tool of expansionist Soviet communism. Chapter 5 is also devoted to the analysis of the Kemalist discourse on reactionary Islam. Its focus is on the Kemalist perception of a creeping threat of Islamic movements gradually and secretly manipulating masses against the secular regime, as manifested in Kemalist intellectuals’ representation of Said Nursî (1873–1960), the founder of one of the largest Islamic movements in the Republican period. The Kemalist demonization of Said Nursî and his followers (Nurcus) was, as shown in this chapter, part of the political propaganda of the Republican People’s Party against the government of the Democratic Party, which accused the latter of undermining secularism by tolerating Nurcus. Lastly, Chapter 6 illustrates how Alevism, a heterodox form of Islam in Turkey, began to be seen as a religion suitable for the secular republic vis-à-vis the Nurcu movement. This last chapter explores the first emergence of the still-effective discourse on Alevis as the guardians of secularism and the carriers of the true Turkish Islam, and hence as an antidote to the perceived threat of Islamic fanaticism in the mid-1960s. In brief, each chapter explores the historical contexts and public debates in which the Kemalist discourse on Islam was produced and reproduced and in this way presents a genealogy of Kemalist secularism. The book is thus written in the hope that it will not only contribute to the study of the evolution of secularism in Turkey but also provide clues to surpassing its fears and formulating a new and more rational discourse of secularism.\n\nxvi\n\nIntroduction The universality of the secularization paradigm and its applicability in nonChristian and non-European societies has been a debated issue. The application of secularization theory in Muslim settings has often been questioned on the basis of assumed contrasts between Christian and Muslim history. The weakness of and resistance to secularism in Muslim societies is explained with the argument that secularization is an alien concept for the Muslim world. What is omitted in such debates is the difference between the concepts of secularization, a sociologial process, and secularism, an ideology. Bernard Lewis, a prominent academic contributor to Orientalist discourse (Said 1978)1 which constructs the identity of “the West” by othering “the East” or “the Islamic world”, expounds this popular argument as follows: The reasons why Muslims developed no secularist movement of their own, and reacted sharply against attempts to introduce one from abroad, will thus be clear from the contrasts between Christian and Muslim history and experience. From the beginning, Christians were taught both by precept and practice to distinguish between God and Caesar and between the different duties owed to each of the two. Muslims received no such instruction. (2002: 103)\n\nLewis’ overgeneralizing and homogenizing discourse neglects the fact that secularization as a sociological process has also affected the Muslim world. Assuming an essential difference between the West and the Islamic world, he reproduces the opposition of secularism versus Islam which dominates the debate on secularism in the Islamic context (Filali-Ansary 1999: 6). Lewis employs this dichotomy in showing “what went wrong” in Islam, as if the latter were a monolithic cultural unit, immune to social change. Such an essentialist perspective is also appropriated by opponents of secularism in Muslim contexts. For instance, ideologues of Islamism marginalize contemporary secularism in such contexts as inauthentic. This Islamist critique, however, reflects an Orientalism in reverse, or Occidentalism, portraying the West as the alien other of an authentic Muslim world.2 The Islamist search for authenticity echoes what Boroujerdi depicts as nativism, describing the call for native or indigenous cultural and 1\n\n2\n\nISLAM AND SECULARISM IN TURKEY\n\nintellectual traditions and for regaining one’s true identity in response to Eurocentrism and colonialism. The depiction of secularism in Muslim-majority societies as an inauthentic, unrooted concept is, however, as baseless as the delineation of secularization as a process unique to the European/Christian context. The Ottoman/Turkish experience proves that the Muslim world was not immune to the forces of modernity and secularization. Moreover, religious vitality confirms the reality of secularization in the Muslim world (and specifically in the Ottoman/Turkish context) rather than demonstrating its absence (AlAzm 2004).3 Besides, the fact that secularism is “imported” from the West – like many other ideologies which have resisted national borders and taken root in settings very different from their original source – does not negate the fact that a secularist intellectual tradition emerged in the Ottoman Empire from the nineteenth century onwards. The Ottoman state promoted an orthodox, Sunni Islam against the Shi‘a branch of Islam, which was adopted by the Safavid dynasty as the state religion of Iran in the sixteenth century, via two institutions: the Caliphate and the ulema (doctors of Islamic law). From the mid-sixteenth century onwards, the Ottoman sultan had not only been the sultan of the Ottoman state but also, at least symbolically, the Caliph of all Muslims. The title of the Caliph was claimed by the Ottoman sultan in 1539, during the reign of Sultan Süleyman (Kanunî, r. 1520–66), when the last Abbasid Caliph elMütevekkil died in Egypt. From then on, the Ottoman sultan began to be referred to as the leader and the protector of the entire Islamic community (Buzpınar 2004: 115–16). Still, the title of the Caliph (Hilâfet-i Kübra) was nothing more than a label to emphasize this self-proclaimed role and a source of legitimacy (İnalcık 1968–70). The Ottoman state also built a religious elite or ulema who, as the learned in Islamic sciences, were vested with the authority to express and apply the Islamic law (şeriat). The ulema functioned as officials, acting as agents of the state in the fields of education and jurisprudence. The Şeyhülislam (Sheikh ul-Islam), the chief religious official and the head of the ulema, was the highest authority in formulating opinions on points concerning the Islamic law (İnalcık 1964: 43–4). In the Ottoman period, the preservation of the state was the most important objective for a group of secular officials who were empiricallyminded, pragmatic bureaucrats. This tradition of realpolitik, along with the so called “Ottoman state tradition”, has often been seen at the root of the dynamics which started off processes of modernization and secularization in the nineteenth century Ottoman Empire (Ibid; Heper 1985; Mardin 1986; Zürcher and van der Linden 2004: 96–7). This state tradition has been referred to by historians as the tradition of din-u-devlet, that is a dual system of political legitimacy in which both Islam and the state were sources of\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nlegislation. İnalcık, for instance, argued that besides the Islamic law (şeriat) there existed a second source of law, namely örf or kanunnânme, which were imperial laws, derived directly from the will of the ruler (İnalcık 1964: 57; İnalcık 2005: 69, 76, 78. See also İnalcık 1975). This örfî law applied to the state elite and to administrative matters (public law, state finances, taxation, etc.) and remained side by side with Islamic law. Hence it was defined by Barkan, another prominent historian, as secular law (layik hukuk) (1975: 53).4 Nonetheless, it is important to emphasize here that even secular laws were justified as being “necessary for the well-being of the Islamic community” (İnalcık 1964: 57). Besides, major secularizing reforms, such as the declaration in 1839 of the imperial edict known as the Hatt-ı Şerif of Gülhane, which guaranteed Ottoman subjects’ life, honor and property regardless of their religion, continued to be framed in an Islamic language. In other words, Islam continued to be the legitimizing framework even for modernizing reforms. The process of secularization in the Ottoman Empire was further developed by the Reform Edict of 1856 (Tanzimat), which stressed the equality of Muslim and non-Muslim subjects of the empire in the fields of public employment, taxation and military service. While the state attempted to define an Ottoman citizenship for all people living in its territories regardless of religion and ethnicity, it also gave rise to an oppositionary intellectual movement which attempted to bridge the gap between modernization and Islam (Gülalp 2002: 24–5). The members of this intellectual movement, i.e. the Young Ottomans, were not against the modernizing reforms of the Tanzimat statesmen, but wanted to legitimize these reforms within an Islamic framework. Their political project was implemented by Sultan Abdülhamid II, who used Islam to legitimize westernist modernization (Ibid.: 26; Deringil 1991). Historiography influenced by the twentieth century modernization paradigm omitted to note that Islam was so embedded in the reform movement of the nineteenth century. The history of Ottoman secularization was depicted in this modernization paradigm as a dialectical process marked by “the struggle of an enlightened elite, which is open to the ideas of the West (the Tanzimat bureaucrats, the Young Ottomans, Young Turks and Kemalists) with representatives of traditional, mostly religious, values” culminating in the secular Republic (Zürcher 1998). Berkes defines the history of Ottoman secularization as the history of the “basic conflict between the forces of change and progress and the forces of tradition [which] … tend to promote the domination of religion and sacred law” (Berkes 1964: 6). This perspective, which is based on the dichotomies of modern-secular-progressive-enlightened versus traditional-religiousbackward-obscurantist, characterizes the work of Niyazi Berkes on secularism in Turkey. This dichotomous approach of the modernization\n\n4\n\nISLAM AND SECULARISM IN TURKEY\n\nparadigm has recently been revised by scholars who pointed out the interrelatedness of Islam and the process of secularization. These scholars focused especially on the era of Sultan Abdulhamid II (1876–1909).5 According to Berkes, the era under Sultan Abdülhamid II, i.e. the Hamidian regime, was an obscurantist period in contrast to the previous Tanzimat reform era (1839–76). The Hamidian regime replaced the Tanzimat doctrine of including all religious communities under Ottoman citizenship and promoted pan-Islamism as a state ideology. It glorified the Arab-Muslim civilization instead of the West, and reinvented the Caliphate as the leader of Muslims worldwide who had suffered because of Western imperialism. Again, according to Berkes, the Hamidian period was a dark era, because of increased oppression and censorship as well as the network of spies employed to suppress the opposition. Recent revisionist historiography of the Hamidian period has corrected this picture by challenging the dichotomy of Islam versus modernity (Deringil 1991; Fortna 2002). Deringil, for instance, showed that Abdülhamid’s pan-Islamic policies were a part of the palace’s search for legitimacy in order to prevent the disintegration of the empire. Fortna in turn explained the increased importance given to Islam in school curriculums during the Hamidian era as a policy which was congruent with accelerated modernization. The use of Islam for strengthening the state was thus not contradictory to modernization and secularization. In fact, an instrumental approach to Islam was made possible by secularization at the conceptual level. It was such a conceptual shift that enabled the perception of Islam as a factor of social cohesion. This view of Islam as social cement was a nineteenth century development which had begun with the Young Ottomans (Mardin 1984). The modernization of Ottoman state institutions and the army in the nineteenth century, which was based on European models, and the consequent institutional secularization – in the fields of law, education and state bureaucracy – meant that the role of the ulema in administration, the judiciary, and the educational system was gradually undermined. Graduates of the secular state-sponsored middle schools of the Tanzimat began to replace the ulema who thus lost their monopoly on interpreting Islam. A new intelligentsia, no longer educated in religious seminaries (medrese), “began to discuss Islam as a fundamental social issue” (Mardin 2005: 151). This development was a crucial aspect of the process of secularization. This new Ottoman intelligentsia, educated in the new westernized schools of the Military Medical Academy, Civil Service Academy and the War Academy, were under the influence of eighteenth century Enlightenment ideas, such as respect for the laws of nature, the liberal and constitutional ideas of nineteenth century Europe, and the Ottoman patriotism of the\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nprevious generation of intellectuals referred to as Young Ottomans, among whom Namık Kemal (1840–88) especially was a source of inspiration. However, the influence of materialist and positivist ideas distinguished this generation from the former. As explained by Mardin: The fundamental substructure of the political thought of such men as Namık Kemal had consisted in the belief of natural law as an emanation of God. Now natural law both in the form of religious law and as a precept of right reason were displaced by the concept of an invariable relation between “things” (1969: 6).\n\nThe materialism of Büchner and the cult of positive sciences (müspet ilim) as preached by Auguste Comte led this generation to put science before divine revelation as the source of knowledge. These ideas were propagated for instance in Beşir Fuad’s (1852–87) periodical Beşer, which popularized the advances made in physiology, and in translations such as Büchner’s Kraft und Stoff, translated by Baha Tevfik (1884–1914). Attempts were also made to reconcile Islam with science. Celal Nuri (İleri, 1881–1938) propagated in his book Tarih-i İstikbal the idea that Islamic tenets amounted to an acceptance of the laws of nature. Similar use of Islamic rhetoric for propagating a scientific worldview was also found in leading members of the Young Turk movement,6 such as Ahmet Rıza and Abdullah Cevdet. Ahmet Rıza (1859–1930), a member of the Ottoman civilian administration exiled to Paris in 1889, became the leader of the Young Turk movement and its political organization, the Committee of Union and Progress (İttihat ve Terakki Cemiyeti), 1895–1908. As a committed positivist, Ahmet Rıza propagated respect for the laws of nature and the cult of positive sciences in his journal Meşveret (Consultation). However, his materialism did not lead him to reject religion; instead he saw religion as a principle of order, as framed by Comte. He acknowledged the importance of Islam as social cement and used Islamic rhetoric as a way to appeal to the Muslim readership. He rejected the view that Islam was intolerant and the cause of the decline of Islamic civilization and instead depicted Islam as a tolerant religion which recognized the need for a national assembly, even claiming that Islam’s weakness was in fact its excessive tolerance (Mardin 1969: 10–11). Ahmet Rıza was not the only Young Turk who tried to reconcile Islam with modern ideas. Other Westernist Young Turks also dreamed of a society in which their version of Islam would help them mould the “new Muslims” (Hanioğlu 1997: 143). In their effort to reach the public, they defined a “true” Islam, compatible with science and materialism, in contrast to the Islam of the “obscurantist imams (prayer leaders) and sheikhs” (Hanioğlu 1995: 200–3; Zürcher 2002). Theirs was an anti-clerical struggle to refashion\n\n6\n\nISLAM AND SECULARISM IN TURKEY\n\nIslam as a private matter and as a rational belief compatible with modernization. According to them, this was the true Islam which was obstructed by intermediaries who were abusing people’s ignorance. Even Abdullah Cevdet (1889–1932), one of the founders of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) in the Royal Medical Academy, a materialist who was a great admirer of Anglo-Saxon culture, advocated that modern and materialist concepts had to be promoted as Islamic concepts, because Muslims would reject any idea coming from the Christian West. In his journal İçtihad, he promoted a scientific religion, free of dogma, myth, supernatural command, rites, and rituals, as well as religion as an individual matter (Hanioğlu 1997: 147–8). Abdullah Cevdet also translated the Dutch scholar Reinhard Dozy’s Essai sur l’histoire de l’Islamisme into Ottoman Turkish; in the preface of the book he depicted Dozy as being “a thousand times more Muslim than vagabond Hamids” because, he argued, “every learned and virtuous person [was] a Muslim”. He supported his argument with the prophet’s saying “Religion is mu‘amala, social relations” and claimed that true Islam could not coexist with ignorance and oppression (Abdullah Cevdet 2002: 172–4).7 Westernist Young Turks such as Ahmet Rıza and Abdullah Cevdet, as well as Ziya Gökalp (1876–1924), the leading ideologue of Turkish nationalism, who pursued the same positivist ideas, believed that a change of social mentality was necessary for progress. For instance, they saw the dominance of superstitious beliefs (hurafe) as the cause of backwardness in Muslim societies. That is why they insisted on the need to reform Islam. In this sense, they shared a disdain for folk religion with reformist Islamists at the time (Mardin 1969: 23 and 1992: 147–8; Arai 1992: 88, 93–4). In their belief in the essentially rational character of Islam, the Young Turks at least partially echoed the ideas of the modernist Islamists of the nineteenth century, such as Muhammad Abduh (1849–1905) and Jalal AlDin Al-Afghani (1838–97). What they had in common was their claim concerning the compatibility of Islam with modernity. The Young Turks assumed an authentic spirit of Islam, which was rational and had to be revived in order to prevent the cultural decay of the Islamic world. Both Abduh and Afghani sought to “unite and strengthen Muslim communities through a reform of Islamic belief and society” (Esposito 1984: 45) by calling for a return to the spirit of early Islam and for a reinterpretation of the Koran and the tradition of the prophet Muhammed in the light of modern times. Yet, unlike these pious modernist Islamists, the Young Turks were materialists who attempted to place an Islamic jacket around scientific notions (Hanioğlu 1997). They were not pious Muslims, but rather, as Mardin puts it, “deists” who could “praise Islam as the most excellent and\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nadvanced of all religions while engaging in positivistic reforms of society” (Mardin 1989: 142). They wanted to use religion as an instrument of social control and cohesion, because Islam for them had an important function as the cement of society, creating a sentiment of solidarity (Mardin 1969: 23). Thus their emphasis on solidarity and their will to unity prevented these positivists from declaring a full-scale war on Islam for the sake of progress. Nevertheless, they nurtured a hostility towards the conservative ulema, because they saw the latter as an obstacle on the way to a scientific and rational Islam. Ziya Gökalp, for instance, incorporated Westernist and reformist ideas into Turkish nationalism in his work Türkçülüğün Esasları (Principles of Turkism, 1924). While modernist Islamists wanted to revitalize the Islamic community by replacing superstition and tradition with the Islam of the prophet’s time, the concern of Turkish nationalism was to vitalize the Turkish nation, not the Islamic community (ümmet) as a whole. In other words, the significant unit for Gökalp (and later nationalists) was the nation and not the ümmet. According to him, the nation would be vitalized only if the “true” Islam could replace superstitious beliefs which, they thought, were caused by external factors, such as the influence of Arab culture or corrupt clergy. Gökalp and Turkish nationalists even published a magazine, İslâm Mecmuası (Islam Magazine) in 1914, in which they tried to prove that nationalism did not contradict Islam and promoted the reform of Islam.8 However, unlike Islamists, these reformists subordinated Islam to national identity by redefining and instrumentalizing it for the sake of nation-building. The Young Turk Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) Government accomplished several reforms of secularization, inspired by the reformist current and following the advice of Ziya Gökalp. For instance, religious courts were brought under the supervision of the Ministry of Justice and were forced to admit the authority of the secular appeals court (mahkeme-i temyiz). Religious seminaries (medreses) were brought under state-control via the Ministry of Education. Moreover, a Council of Sheikhs (Meclis-i Meşayih) was established in order to supervise the Sufi orders and their lodges (Arai 1992: 93–4). The ideas of the Westernist group of Young Turks, and of the nationalists led by Ziya Gökalp, largely shaped the Kemalist approach towards religion. Some members of the Westernist group, such as Kılıçzâde Hakkı (1872– 1960) and Celâl Nuri, became deputies in the Turkish Grand National Assembly in the republican period (Hanioğlu 1997: 147–8). Many of their ideas, which appeared utopian in the 1910s, were implemented as secularist reforms in the following decade. Early articulations of secularism in Turkey were influenced by French thought and imported the term “laïque” – which meant “of the people” or lay members of the church as distinguished from “the clergy”. The first Turkish\n\n8\n\nISLAM AND SECULARISM IN TURKEY\n\nterm used by Gökalp in the 1910s to refer to “laïque” was lâ-dînî, literally meaning nonreligious or secular (dindışı). Because it was understood as meaning atheism by the Sheikh ul-Islam, as well as Islamist intellectuals writing in the magazine Sırat-ı Müstakim (later Sebilürreşad), this word was replaced with the word laik (Adıvar 1947: 277). Since then, this word has been used in Turkey for referring to the doctrine of secularism. While the word laik and laiklik has been used in Turkish-written sources, English-written texts use either “secularism” or “laicism” to refer to Turkish secularism. Berkes argued, for instance, that the concept of “secularism” rather than “laicism” had to be used in understanding the secularization process of Turkey. Laicism, he maintained, referred to the distinction of the laity (the Greek words laos, the people, and laikos, the lay) from the clergy, and hence was a Christian characteristic, where the organization of the church was a major issue, unlike in Islam or Ottoman tradition (Berkes 1964: 3–4). According to a more recent account of secularism in Turkey written by Davison, however, the concept of laicism is more congruent with the specificity of the Turkish experience, which is marked by the control of religion by the state, although “the relations of control were partly understood by actors as relations of separation, in the sense of separating religion from its previous interrelation in certain spheres” (1998: 180). Davison argued that the Turkish experience can be defined not as secularism, which assumes a non-religious, religion–free state, but as laicism, which connotes the transfer of some fields, such as education and governance, to lay control. Laiklik, according to Davison, “did not entail ending state interest in religion”, as it was based on religious policy which reflected a specific interpretation of Islam (Ibid.: 153–4; Davison 2003: 337). Although I follow Davison’s perspective in this book, I do not agree with his insistance on not using the term “secularism”. In this book, I use the latter term for referring to the doctrine that morality, national education, and the state itself should not be based on religious principles,9 a doctrine which can gain specific meanings in different political and historical contexts. As Asad states, laicism is the alternative word for French secularism which “draws on the Jacobin experience, one that authorizes a stronger, more aggressive secularism … than the British equivalent does” (2003: 208). Similarly, the Turkish laiklik has been viewed as a specific version of secularism inspired by the French Jacobin tradition. As a political doctrine which promoted secularization, it ultimately aimed to limit religion to the private sphere by redefining religion as a matter of individual conscience (vicdan), a personal affair (Mardin 1977: 588; Mert 1994: 87; Ayata 1996: 41). In other words, Turkish laiklik is a form of secularism, although it has its own peculiarities. Thus, I prefer to use the more general term of “secularism” over the particularly French concept of “laicism”.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nSecularism has been the central tenet of Kemalism, the official ideology10 of the modernizing political elite in the Republican period.11 The Republic was proclaimed on 29 October 1923, one year after the abolition of the sultanate on 1 November 1922. With this, the earlier subjects of the Ottoman Empire became equal and free citizens of the Turkish Republic, regardless of their religion.12 Ankara, where the Grand National Assembly was held, was chosen as the capital of the new Republic. In contrast to Istanbul, which had been the seat of the Ottoman dynasty and the Caliphate, the new capital symbolized the renaissance of the Turkish nation and the new secular republic (Şenol Cantek 2003). The Kemalist commitment to secularism was officially proclaimed in 1928 with the removal of the second article of the 1924 Constitution, which declared Islam the official religion of the state. Finally, the principle of secularism has been a non-amendable article of the Constitution since February 1937. Mustafa Kemal and the political cadres of the single-party regime, which lasted 1923–40, were heirs to the ideology of the nineteenth and the early twentieth century Ottoman reformers and Westernist Young Turks. Like their predecessors, Kemalists were influenced by the values of the Enlightenment, Comtean positivism and solidarism of Durkheim (Dumont 1984; Zürcher 2002). Kemalists differed, however, in their radical implementation of westernizing and secularizing reforms. They devoted themselves to what they called İnkılâb (Revolution), which implied a “radical change executed with order and method”, aiming at a “complete transformation of society”.13 The Kemalist Revolution included several radical reforms which had both political and cultural implications. Kemalists aimed to form a secular and strong nation-state. They rejected maintaining national unity on the basis of Islamic solidarity, which had secured the alliance of different ethnic groups in Anatolia against the “infidel” occupying powers (Zürcher 1999). Thus, the elimination of Islamic sources of power and legitimacy was seen as essential for strengthening political authority in Ankara. A major institutional step in this secularization process was taken by the enactment of Law No. 431 (Hilafetin İlgasına ve Hanedanı Osmaninin Türkiye Cumhuriyeti Memaliki Haricine Çıkarılmasına Dair Kanun), which abolished the Caliphate on 3 March 1924.14 The same law also abolished the function of Sheikh ul-Islam15 and the Ministries of Religious Affairs (Şeriye) and Pious Foundations (Evkaf). Instead, a Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyânet İşleri Reisliği) was charged with the administration of the mosques (Tarhanlı 1993; Kaya 1998; Kara 2000a; Gözaydın 2006). As Gözaydın states: The new legislation preferred to place the management of religious affairs in the hands of an administrative bureau, not to a ministry in the cabinet. This was a key part of the overall policy of the founding political decision-making\n\n10\n\nISLAM AND SECULARISM IN TURKEY elite of Turkey who wanted to establish a strictly secular state and to transform society into a modern one. They did not want to have a unit within the cabinet dealing with religious affairs. Instead, by assigning religious affairs to an administrative unit, the ruling elite both took religion under their control and at the same time managed to break the potentially sacred significance of the Presidency of Religious Affairs. (2006: 1)\n\nFor Kemalists, secularism did not contradict the continuing control over religion and the existence of a religious apparatus within the state mechanism. Furthermore, the state wanted to curb the power of the ulema by fully secularizing the field of education. The Law of the Unification of Education (Tevhid-i Tedrisat Kanunu), which was enacted on the same day as the law which abolished the Caliphate, closed the religious seminaries and standardized the institutions of education under a secular curriculum. A further major step taken by the single-party government to keep religious activity under control was the outlawing of Sufi orders (tarikat). On 30 September 1925, Law No. 677 dissolved the orders and closed all local and central dervish lodges (tekke ve zaviyeler). This law prohibited the use of mystical names, titles and costumes pertaining to these titles, impounded the assets of the orders, banned their ceremonies and meetings, and provided sentences for those who tried to re-establish them. Besides this, tombs which were the centers of veneration for visitations and pilgrimages were also closed by the same law. The Kemalist Revolution rendered the utopia of the Westernist Young Turks real.16 The process of westernization in all fields of life, such as art, law, education, dress and food habits, which began in the nineteenth century, was accelerated by the Kemalist regime. The changes were so stark that, in the eyes of many pro-regime intellectuals of the time, the Kemalist Revolution was the peak of the process of westernization and represented a real civilizational change. For instance, educational and legal institutions were totally secularized by the Republican state. The standardization of education under a secular curriculum and the abolishment of religious education was followed by radical steps which secularized the law. The secularization in the legal field that had begun in the nineteenth century was completed with the adoption of the Swiss Civil Code and the Italian Penal Code in 1926. With the abolishment of Islamic law and the adoption of the new secular Civil Code (Medenî Kanun), the equality of women in law was recognized. According to Mahmut Esat [Bozkurt] (1892–1943), the Minister of Justice at the time who had studied law in Switzerland, this new civil law would close the doors of old civilization and open those of contemporary civilization (Duben and Behar 1996: 229). In the new civil code, polygamy was banned (although it could be continued in places out of reach of the state),17 women\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\ngained equal rights in inheritance law, could apply for divorce and be a part of public life. Moreover, the Kemalist state undertook even more direct interventions in the everyday life of the people in its attempt to secularize the public sphere and adopt Western civilization. The dress code, which imposed the compulsory use of the western brimmed hat in 1925 and outlawed the fez, the traditional headgear for men, reflected the Kemalist urge to break with the past and to change even the daily habits of people for the sake of westernization.18 The replacement of the Arabic alphabet by the Latin one in 1928 was also a reform which created a symbolic rupture with traditional daily habits. Besides this, the adoption of the European clock and calendar in 1926, of European numerals in 1928, and of European measures and weights in 1931 were other reforms which limited the future generations’ links with the Islamic world and their access to the immediate Ottoman past (Zürcher 1997: 196). The elimination of the influences of Islamic/Arab culture by adopting Europe as a model was the primary goal of Kemalist nationalism. In the words of Falih Rıfkı Atay (1893–1971), the editor of the official newspaper Hâkimiyet-i Milliye (National Sovereignty), “to be Westernized meant at the same time to escape from being Arabicized; it meant being Turkified” (Atay 1980: 446; also quoted in Ahıska 2003: 378, fn. 74). These cultural reforms were intended to make the new Turkish nation a part of the civilized Western world as soon as possible. “Catching the train of civilization” (Ahıska 2003: 354–5) was the main motive of Kemalists, who were positivists believing in the idea of progress. Hence, secularism was understood as the civilizing mission of the Kemalist elite. In other words, the Kemalist elite internalized Eurocentric Orientalist discourse by appropriating its basic assumptions, especially its acceptance of a hierarchical dichotomy between the East and the West and the normative and teleological view of history, in which Western modernity represented the latest and superior stage. While traditional culture was pushed back in time and degraded as the cause of failure vis-à-vis the Western powers, Western civilization was accepted as a “telos”, a stage which the Turkish nation still had to reach. As a result, the new Turkish citizen was also caught between his two selves: the Western/modern self which s/he opted for and the Oriental/traditional self which s/he tried to suppress. The Oriental self, seen through Orientalist eyes, had to be concealed or eradicated in order to be part of the universal civilization equated with the Western one. The inability to replace it with the modern self has been a source of pain for many intellectuals of the period. Here is how one of the staunch Kemalists of the early republican period, Ahmet Ağaoğlu (1869–1939), expressed this pain: Oh, what an endless drama is this incompleteness! It is an internal drama, a spiritual tragedy! I can never feel complete and full. And do you know what a\n\n12\n\nISLAM AND SECULARISM IN TURKEY perdition is this feeling of incompleteness! I like both European music and oriental music. At the same time, I see and feel that I sense neither the former completely and fully like an European does, nor the latter as an Oriental (Ağaoğlu 1940: 90).19\n\nWomen particularly were at the center of such a duality of Oriental and Western identities. Elite women benefited from the new educational and legal reforms of the Republican state, through having equal access to public institutions. These women became the marker of the nation’s modernity. Western-style clothing and accompaniment of men in public arenas of entertainment were seen as the requirements of modernity as well as the proof of their emancipation from tradition. They signified a shift from an Islamic to a secular, modern way of life (Göle 1996: 55–63; Arat 1998: 15). Kemalists, who were inspired by Gökalp’s depiction of feminism in preIslamic Turkish society, saw the emancipation of women as a national mission (Durakbaşa 1998). However, this emancipation, besides being limited to elite women who had access to education, was also short of being a true liberation. Kemalism, through the construction of the image of the new woman, tried to establish a Western style of gender relation in Turkey, while maintaining traditional norms of female modesty (Ibid.: 147–8).20 In the Republican period, Islam no longer served as a legitimating ideology, and its legal, educational, and constitutional status has been radically changed. Still, secularism in the sense of divorcing religion and politics has not occurred in Turkey. Despite its radicalism in secularizing legal, political and cultural fields, the Republican regime did not have a neutral position regarding different Islamic and non-Islamic faiths. The Kemalist state not only wanted to control religion, but also promoted a national and Sunni Islam rendered compatible with the modern nation-state. In this respect, Kemalists were heirs to the Young Turks’ instrumentalist and reformist approach to Islam. They adopted the Young Turks’ dream of a pure, Turkish Islam, which was redefined as a matter of individual conscience (vicdan) and hence made congruous with the westernization project (Davison 1998: 134–88; Parla and Davison 2004: 108). The Directorate of Religious Affairs (DRA) was the main administrative instrument for disseminating this official Islam throughout the country. As an organization under direct supervision of the Prime Minister, it appointed imams, preachers and supervised müftüs, as well as distributing the Friday sermons to the mosques throughout the country. In brief, the aim of secularism was “to remove religion as a rationale from certain spheres of governance without fully separating its institutions and personnel from the state” (Parla and Davison 2004: 104). A total separation between state and religion was impeded primarily by the ideological background of the nationalist movement preceding the\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nfoundation of the Republic. At least to its contemporaries, the nationalist resistance to the occupying powers had been as much a religious movement as a national one (Rustow 1957: 71). As the poem of the national anthem written by Mehmet Âkif (Ersoy) shows, the ideological vocabulary of the resistance movement reflected what could be called a “Muslim nationalism” (Zürcher 1999). Although this Muslim nationalism was suppressed by the secular nationalism of Kemalism after the foundation of the republic, Islam effectively remained an important criterion for affiliation to the nation. Kemalist nationalism, which can be seen as a modernist nationalism having both ethnic and civic characteristics (Akman 2004: 23–51), was based on a vague definition of “Turk”. Acccording to the 1924 Constitution, Turkish citizenship was defined without reference to racial and religious differences (Article 88). Nevertheless, Kemalists imagined “the nation” as “ethnic Turks” who also included Muslim groups such as Kurds, the Laz, and Circassian if they could be Turkified (van Bruinessen 1997; Yıldız 2001). These Muslim groups could, however, be deemed “others” or internal enemies, a threat to unity, if they, like the Kurds, resisted Turkification or emphasized their cultural difference. The Kurdish insurgencies have been seen either as reactionary movements resisting modernization, the expression of economic and social discontent, the action of a radical group, or the outcome of external incitement (Kushner 1997: 224; see also Yeğen 1999). Various Kurdish uprisings in 1925, and the 1930s, resulted in forced migrations of Kurdish groups to the Western parts of the country. Furthermore, non-Muslim minorities such as Greeks, Jews and Armenians too could be perceived as threats to national unity. The proportion of these non-Muslim groups within the population had dropped significantly after World War I, mainly due to the deportation and massacres of Armenians in 1915 and the exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey in 1924.21 These groups have been the only groups in Turkey officially recognized as minorities, because the Treaty of Lausanne, which formed the legal basis for the international recognition of Turkey as an independent state, employed the term minority only in relation to non-Muslim peoples living in Turkey and contained clauses to protect the minorities of the new state.22 The use of religion as the only criterion for the definition of a minority group having linguistic and cultural rights reflected a contradiction with the Kemalist discourse of secularism and a continuity with the Ottoman millet (religious community) system. The experiences of these religious minorities under the Republican regime showed that Turkishness continued to be defined on the basis of Sunni Muslim heritage (Bali 2000; Aktar 2000).23 Likewise, immigration policies of the early Turkish Republic favoring Muslim Turks as opposed to ethnic Turks proved that Turkish citizenship was defined to an important extent on the basis of religion (Kirişçi 2000; Yıldız 2001: 137). In\n\n14\n\nISLAM AND SECULARISM IN TURKEY\n\nother words, the major defining factor of Turkishness in practice was religion, rather than ethnicity.24 The Kemalist state’s control over and instrumentalization of religion did not mean that religion was its primary source of legitimacy. The state rather aimed to determine the limits of the religious sphere as part of its modernizing project of increasing its control over society. The Kemalist elite imagined and promoted a “pure” Islam compatible with reason and away from politics, as reflected clearly in the speeches of Mustafa Kemal, such as the one he gave in İzmir in January 1923: Our religion is a most reasonable and most natural religion, and it is precisely for this reason that it has been the last religion. In order for a religion to be natural, it should conform to reason, technology, science, and logic. Our religion is totally compatible with these. (“İzmir’de Halk ile Konuşma” 1923, in Atatürk [1989: 83–91]; quoted in Parla and Davison 2004: 110)\n\nOr for instance when he explained the rationale for the abolition of the Caliphate in his Speech in 1927: The faith of Islam should be purified and raised from the political situation in which it has been put for centuries. (Atatürk [1962: 684]; quoted in Parla and Davison 2004: 108)\n\nAs shown by Parla and Davison, the “distinction made between ‘pure’ Islam and impure Islam tainted by its entanglement in political affairs” was crucial for Kemalist secularism (Ibid.: 109). The control of Islam also served as a tool of the regime to eliminate political adversaries. The positivist rhetoric of secularism that presented religion as a part of tradition and therefore as an obstacle to progress and modernization was used by the state to eliminate its political opposition, which was often condemned as being anti-revolutionary and reactionary. As Cizre-Sakallıoğlu indicates: The manner in which the state elite employed Islam to fend off opposition – and, in fact, to reinforce the regime – went beyond the meaning of secularism in the West. Rather than being banished from the public political sphere, Islam came to rest at the center stage of politics, and secularism became a politically charged concept. (1996: 236)\n\nThe concept of irtica (reactionary Islam) was crucial in this process of politicization of Islam. As stated in 1923 by Velid Ebu’z-Ziyâ (1884–1945), a journalist who was then slandered as reactionary (mürteci), the term irtica had become a weapon used against opposition in the early Republican period.25\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n15\n\nThe Kemalist attitude towards the opposition in this regard continued the tradition of earlier Ottoman reformers (Zürcher 2001: 209–22; Mert 1998). The term irtica was first used to refer to the March 31 Incident (31 Mart Vak’ası), a mutiny by soldiers which has since been known as an Islamic revolt against the Young Turk government (Akşin 1970; Farhi 1971; Mert 1998; Zürcher 2001). On 13 April 1909 (31 March according to the Ottoman Rumî calendar) soldiers of the First Corps, aided by soldiers of the Light Infantry Battalions of the Third Corps (avcı taburları), revolted and arrested their officers, killing many of them and uttering the cry “We want şeriat!” (Farhi 1971: 275). The rebels, accompanied by the students of religious colleges, wanted the dismissal of the leading statesmen of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), the dismissal of the young officers who had graduated from the Military Academies (mektebli), the reinstatement of those who had risen from the ranks (alaylı) and the full implementation of the şeriat (Ibid.). The uprising lasted until the arrival of a Unionist-controlled task force, called Hareket Ordusu, the Action Amy, made up of a corps from Salonica, which marched on the capital and suppressed the rebellion, executing its leaders and deporting Sultan Abdülhamid II to Salonica. Although the slogan of şeriat was widely used during the revolt, at the time “any kind of a backward move to a Islamic order was hardly one of the possibilities” and religion was just used as a tool for facilitating a mainly military revolt (Akşin 1970: 290–2). Derviş Vahdetî (1870–1909), his Society for Muhammedan Union (İttihad-ı Muhammedî Cemiyeti), and its newspaper Volkan had played an important role in the organization of the uprising. Nevertheless, the revolt was a result of a coalition of opposition forces, largely organized by the opposition party Ahrar (Ibid.), rather than a merely religious uprising.26 Yet, the CUP leadership denounced the rebels as erbab-ı irtica (lords of Islamic reactionism), and from then on the term irtica has become a pejorative epithet used against opposition (2001b: 216–17). “March 31” has since been referred to by the ruling political elite and presented in the official Turkish historiography as an example of Islamic reactionism. The event retained its traumatic effect on most of the leaders of the Republic such as İsmet İnönü (1884–1973), the second President of the Republic after Atatürk. İnönü was to write in his memoirs, published in the weekly magazine Akis as late as 1959, that he always recalled “the catastrophe of March 31” as “the collapse of a big building”, a reaction to the young constitutional regime which created “an ever-lasting atmosphere of insecurity.”27 The feeling of insecurity was crucial here because, in the minds of the Republican leaders, the suppression of the uprising, the dissolution of the Society of Mohammedan Union and the execution of Vahdetî, had only “swept that stratum under the carpet” in İnönü’s words. İrtica (Islamic reactionism) according to them, had not been entirely\n\n16\n\nISLAM AND SECULARISM IN TURKEY\n\ndestroyed and had continued to exist in the guise of various bodies and parties, collaborating with others against the modernizing state (Farhi 1971: 294). Thus, in the early republican era, March 31 was used by the political and intellectual elite as the specter of irtica (reactionary Islam). The memory of the traumatic events of 1909 played an important role in the way the political elite perceived the Kurdish rebellion (Sheikh Said Rebellion) in February 1925. The Sheikh Said Rebellion, which had both a nationalist and religious nature, was constructed by the state’s discourse as the last outbreak of irtica against progress, a tribal issue, a relic of the old order, and as a recurrence of March 31 (Zürcher 2001b: 216–17; Albayrak 1990b: 12; Yeğen 1999: 133). The government charged the rebels with the political use of religion and sacred religious notions (din ve mukaddesat-ı diniye). The opposition, Progressive Republican Party (Terakkiperver Cumhuriyet Fırkası), which was accused of encouraging religious reactionaries, was closed down (Zürcher 2001b: 215). The specter of irtica continued to haunt the Kemalist regime which, after 1925, claimed dictatorial powers and silenced the opposition. Opposition of all sorts, including resistance to the secularizing reforms, was suppressed and depicted as irtica caused by the deep ignorance (koyu cahillik) of the people, which was abused by the defenders of the old order who betrayed the national ideal of modernization.28 As Bozarslan states, Kemalists were no different from other political leaders in the Middle East who tried to tame Islam through nationalizing it and using it as a tool of legitimacy and social control. In this process, they often neglected the fact that the Islamic opposition also was national, unlike the way they wanted to see it. The inescapable result of the state’s attempt to monopolize the field of religion was the perception that Islamic activity independent of the state was a threat (Bozarslan 2000b). While national religion was seen as essential to the development of peace and stability, religious activities in public which were outside of the state’s control were perceived as reactionary movements and relics of the old order opposing the modernizing national state (Ibid.: p. 63). In other words, the state not only needed Islam as a tool for legitimization and enhancing stability, but also reactionary Islam or Islamism (depicted as irtica) as an enemy (Ibid.: p. 66). Secularism in Turkey, with its peculiar characteristics as previously described, was imposed from above by an authoritarian regime. Whether the dominance of this ideology was transformed into hegemony, i.e. an ideological dominance with consent of the masses in the Gramscian sense of the term, is debatable (Gramsci 1971: 12).29 The following pages attempt to depict the political strategies used in Kemalism’s struggle for hegemony instead of judging it in terms of its failure or success in this regard.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n17\n\nKemalism owed its dominance, if not to hegemony, to its success in inculcating in citizens that the values of the secular nation-state were sacred. As Part I demonstrates, the way in which the elite conveyed secularist ideas to the masses was hardly secular. It is not surprising that Kemalism, which had its roots in the earlier realm of religion as do all nationalist ideologies,30 carried ritualistic parallels with religion. In its search for hegemony, Kemalism built myths around historical personalities, events and concepts, reiterating narrative forms of religion. Kemalists adopted the concepts of religion and refashioned them for their secular project. The fact that they adopted the tools – or mythical narratives – also used by religion does not mean that their secularism became a religion or replaced it. As Asad argues, “[m]odern nationalism draws on pre-existing languages and practices. … Yet it does not follow from this that religion forms nationalism” (Asad 2003: 194). A crucial aspect of Kemalism has been the importance given to the concept of a charismatic leader. In the Kemalist discourse, the national past took the form of a myth centered on the figure of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. The latter represented the personification of the Revolution, i.e. the national ideal (mefkûre or ülkü) of westernization/modernization. The nation was defined as “a nation gathered around her Father who represented the crystallization of the Turkish genius” (Köker 1993: 160–1). Having adopted the surname of Atatürk, “the Father Turk”, in 1934, Mustafa Kemal has been at the center of republican iconography (Seufert and Weyland 1994: 80–1; Daldal 1998; Ünder 2001; Navaro-Yashin 2002: 187–203; Zürcher 2005). Atatürk, who was also declared the Eternal Chief (Ebedî Şef), National Chief (Büyük Şef), Commander in Chief (Başkumandan), Teacher in Chief (Başöğretmen), became an icon representing the embodiment of national independence and revolutions. This cult of the leader, with its specific rituals and ceremonies, has been the expression of a “republican metaphysics”, in stark contradiction with the positivist rhetoric of Kemalists (İnsel 2000). The metaphysical characteristic of Kemalism was further enhanced by its narrative of the past. Mythical narratives of the past have been constitutive of the official historiography which aimed to create a new national consciousness based on a new vision of the past and a new rhetoric of change and continuity.31 As Alonso contends, “the hegemony of modern nation-states, and the legitimacy which accrues to the groups and classes that control their apparatuses, are critically constituted by representations of a national past” (Alonso 1988). The Kemalist single-party regime also needed to create a national consciousness on which it could base its legitimacy. To this end, Mustafa Kemal’s own narrative, which was introduced in his Speech (Nutuk) overviewing the years 1919–26, has been the main basis of the official historiography (Zürcher 1984; Adak 2003). Besides, an official\n\n18\n\nISLAM AND SECULARISM IN TURKEY\n\nTurkish history thesis was formed under the supervision of Mustafa Kemal between 1929 and 1937. This official history, which was “scientifically” presented during the Turkish History Congresses in 1932 and 1937 and shaped history education throughout the republican period, emphasized the pre-Ottoman and pre-Islamic past of the Turks going back to the “motherland” of Central Asia (Ersanlı Behar 1996: 89). Besides the Turkish History Foundation, which became the factory of official history, a Turkish Language Institute was set up with the aim of purging the Turkish language of foreign – Arabic and Persian – words. In a nutshell, by founding such institutions, the Kemalist state searched for a nation with its own history, language and culture (Kadıoğlu 1995). The Turkish experience confirms the definition of a nation made by Ernest Renan: “Nations are among other things, communities of shared memory and shared forgetting” (1990: 8–22). In Kemalist historiography, the immediate Ottoman past was depicted as a catastrophic period and a dark age for the nation. The Ottoman dynasty and the Caliphate were portrayed as responsible for the catastrophe at the end of World War I, which was seen as the inevitable result of the failure to catch up with Western civilization, which was based on science and reason. The Ottoman past was also neglected because the old institutions of Islam, such as the traditional ulema, high-ranking religious functionaries, and tarikats were seen as relics of the past and obstacles to progress. This neglect of the Islamic legacy, and the downplaying of the continuity with the Ottoman past, were in fact in line with Republican leaders’ secularization policies, which were aimed at decreasing the role of Islam in public life and realizing the shift from Eastern to Western civilization. The Kemalist regime not only attempted to make the nation forget the imperial symbolism of the recent past, but also tried to construct a historical conscience in order to shape the psychological reflexes of the citizens. This “national pedagogy” was made possible by recalling certain events in such a way as to remind the citizens of the dangers of the past and the future (Açıkel 1996: 134–5). This use of the past has been essential for secularist discourse. This study thus analyzes how the selective use and mythical narration of the past played a role in the mediation of secularism to the masses. This book contends that the key to understanding the dominant secularist discourse in Turkey is the politics of memory, or “mnemonic battles” in the words of Zerubavel.32 Especially in the multi-party period, Kemalist secularism was contested by those who claimed alternative pasts and counter-memories.33 Kemalists thus lost the monopoly over shaping the national memory that they used to have in the single-party period.34\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n19\n\nThe following chapters analyze how the Kemalist memory was recycled, sustained, transformed and challenged during the public debates on secularism in the multi-party period. It was through this politics of memory that secularism was able to uphold its dominance and to struggle for hegemony in the enlarged public sphere of the democratic period. Politicians and intellectuals were crucial actors in this process. Secularism in Turkey has been mediated to the masses via education and the mass media by politicians and intellectuals. It was the ultimate aim of the Kemalist regime to transform secularism from an official doctrine into a worldview internalized by the masses at large. The printed press, as a key mediator between the elite and the masses, provided the political leaders and intellectuals with a platform where they could convey, negotiate and fix the meaning of secularism. Politicians and intellectuals, as the authors of political discourses, attempted to shape public opinion about events and conducted public debates on secularism in the form of editorials and articles published in daily newspapers and periodicals. Especially in the multi-party period, the discourse of Kemalist secularism began to be reproduced by the political and intellectual elite, who represented a greater variety compared to the single-party period. In this period, the pluralization of the political sphere was paralleled by an increased activity in civil society. The community of intellectuals included groups composed of writers, journalists, artists, scholars, students, and members of liberal professions. They intervened in the political debate via the printed press, although they themselves were not professional politicians (Charle 2001: 7627).35 All of these public interventions were made possible by concrete legal measures taken by the state. A critical change in the Press Law, ratified by the Grand National Assembly on 1 June 1946, gave more freedom to journalists. The new law amended the 50th article of the Press Law (Matbuat Kanunu, dated 1931), which gave the government the power to temporarily close daily newspapers and periodicals that opposed the general policies of the country (memleketin genel politikasına dokunacak yayın) (Topuz 1996: 100). For the first time in Turkey’s history, the daily circulation of newspapers reached seventy to eighty thousand for each newspaper (Gevgilili 1983: 220). Elite journalists, as “representatives” of civil society, “competed with political elites in their claims to the true expression of popular aspirations” (Heper and Demirel 1996: 109–23) and were read more widely as levels of literacy increased.36 The proliferated printed media largely supported the new opposition, Democratic Party (Demokrat Parti), which was founded on 7 January 1946 (Topuz 1996: 105). Owing its popularity largely to this support, the Democratic Party, which took power in 1950, paid its debt by issuing the\n\n20\n\nISLAM AND SECULARISM IN TURKEY\n\nPress Law of 15 July 1950. This was a further liberal move which decreased the government’s control over the press (Topuz 1996: 105). The press thus played a crucial role in the enlargement of the public sphere of civil society. This was a sphere where the meanings of religion and secularism were widely debated, especially in the first decades of the multiparty period (Kaçmazoğlu 1988; Sitembölükbaşı 1995; Taşyürek 2001). The explosion of media in this period was marked by the emergence of a new Islamic discourse which, as suggested by Mardin, closed the gap between the elite and the ordinary people (Mardin 2005: 157). A new group of conservative nationalist intellectuals claimed to represent the voice of Muslims and to bring Islam back to the public. These intellectuals took a critical attitude towards the authoritarian regime of the single-party era by conveying an alternative collective memory, that of Muslims repressed by the single-party government. The secularist discourse and its evolution in the first two decades of the multi-party period can be understood in the context of this clash of collective memories, which is explored in Part II. Part I in turn investigates secularism as practiced in the preceding period of the single-party regime.\n\n1 Reactionary Islam: The Menemen Incident (1930) Düştü Kubilay’ın başsız gövdesi Bir zeytin dalı gibi yere. Düştü cebinden bir kitap, açıldı, Göklere.1 Şeyh Mehmet, bir işarettir, bir gölgedir.2\n\n“This is a second Kubilay incident!” These were the words from the speech of the spokesman of the opposition party, who blamed the Government for the allegedly Islamist attack on 17 May 2006 against the Council of State which had upheld the ban on Islamic headscarf for state employees (See Preface).3 In this speech made in the Grand National Assembly on the day after the attack, the murdered judge of the Council of State was likened to Kubilay, a young teacher and reserve officer who had been beheaded by the leader of an Islamic rebellion against the secularist regime in 1930. In the eyes of the speaker, both the victims of 1930 and of 2006 were attacked by the same enemy: irtica or “reactionary Islam”. But what had happened in 1930? Who was Kubilay? How could his memory be evoked even 76 years after his death? Turkish textbooks for secondary schools, covering the history of the modernization of the Turkish Republic in the 1920s and 1930s and teaching the principles of Kemalism, refer to the story of Kubilay under the subtitle of “The Menemen Incident”. The rebellion during which Kubilay was beheaded is framed here as one of the most important “movements of reactionism” or “reactionary uprisings” (irticai hareket or gerici ayaklanma) against the republican regime, and is narrated as follows: Those who were against the Republic wanted to overthrow it and to reestablish the old order. However, they were prevented at their every attempt as 21\n\n22\n\nISLAM AND SECULARISM IN TURKEY the great majority was determined to protect the Republic. The Menemen Incident was one of these attempts. Derviş Mehmed, a person affiliated with the Naqshbandi order, and ignorant people who gathered around him, came to Menemen on December 23, 1930. They began an uprising for the sake of religion. They martyred Kubilay, a teacher and second-lieutenant who tried to stop the uprising, by cutting his head off. Soldiers were sent to the town as soon as the event was heard of. The uprising was appeased. Rebels were caught, tried in military court and punished. (Şenünver et al. 2005: 126)\n\nThis narrative has been adopted also by several, mostly Kemalist, amateur historians and journalists who studied the Menemen Incident.4 In this narrative, which brings the martyrdom of Kubilay into focus, the event is depicted as a conspiracy of the Naqshbandi Sufi order,5 and the fact that the latter was effectively suppressed is emphasized. The Menemen Incident is not a mere “historical event” which is chronicled and recorded; it is a “commemorated event”6 for which annual ceremonies are held in Menemen every year on 23 December. Especially since the early 1990s, this annual commemoration ceremony has been attended by thousands of Kemalist civil activists and transformed into a secularist demonstration. The above narration of the event has been repeated since the 1930s in commemorative statements and ceremonies. The event in this narrative form has functioned as a model illustrating “the perpetual conflict between conservative Islamists and secular Kemalists” (Brockett 1999: 48). Accordingly, the beheaded officer Kubilay, the heroic victim of the incident, has become an icon7 of Kemalist secularism. This chapter aims to elucidate why and how the Menemen Incident has become a commemorated event, unlike others linked to reactionary movements against the early Republican state. The main contention of the chapter is that the icon of Kubilay has been a prominent constituent of the Kemalist memory because the story of beheading revived the fear of reactionary Islam (irtica) and served to create an emotional bond with the secular regime. The Kemalist regime used this event in the service of its fight against irtica as well as for supressing the opposition. The following account of the Menemen Incident will focus on its social and political context, the motivations and actions of the rebels, the state’s use of the event to mobilize citizens and to delegitimize the opposition, and finally the resistance to this mobilization. This account of the rebellion, its context and its aftermath deviates from both Kemalist and Islamist historical accounts of the event centered around their respective victims and heros. It aims to illuminate one of the main moments of the formation of the concept of irtica during the single-party period.\n\nTHE MENEMEN INCIDENT\n\n23\n\nThe single-party regime, opposition and reactionaries The Menemen Incident occurred in December 1930, seven years after the proclamation of the Turkish Republic, which was then ruled by the partygovernment of the Republican People’s Party (RPP), except during short attempts at democracy in November 1924–June 1925 and in August 1930– January 1930. After the outbreak of the Kurdish Rebellion (Sheikh Said Rebellion) of 1925, the single-party regime was consolidated with the proclamation of martial law in the eastern provinces and the adoption of the Law on the Maintenance of Order (Takrir-i Sükûn Kanunu), which remained in force from 3 March 1925 to 4 March 1929 and gave the government dictatorial powers. Besides suppressing the Kurdish rebellion, the Law also silenced all opposition, including the opposition political party (Progressive Republican Party) and the press (Zürcher 1997: 178–80; van Bruinessen 2000: 144). During this period of silenced opposition the Kemalist state implemented radical secularizing reforms, such as the outlawing of the Sufi orders (tarikat), including the Naqshbandi order, which had played an important role in the Kurdish rebellion. The ban on Sufi activity did not result in an armed reaction against the regime, but rather in partially passive resistance or accommodation to the new regime (Küçük 2007). Like the opposition to the abolition of the Caliphate, the potential opposition to the outlawing of Sufi orders was suppressed by the Independence Tribunals (İstiklâl Mahkemeleri), the revolutionary courts, which were founded to implement the High Treason Law (Hıyanet-i Vataniye Kanunu) against the opponents of the nationalist government in Ankara in 1920. Until 1930, the radical westernization program of the Republican People’s Party (RPP) was accompanied by a general lack of civil liberties as well as the party’s widespread corruption at the local level. The Kemalist political elite were not totally unaware of an increasing unpopularity of the regime. For instance, Ahmet Ağaoğlu, who was the editor of Hâkimiyet-i Milliye (the official newspaper) and a university professor, and who supported the stateled westernization program, was among those who were worried by this situation. In a report which he presented to Mustafa Kemal in 1926, he criticized the irresponsible behavior of the RPP leaders and warned the President of the Republic of signs of a decrease in the prestige of the party in the eyes of the common people. Their silence, according to him, did not mean the absence of opposition.8 The latent public discontent with the RPP rule, which was observed by Ağaoğlu as early as 1926, could be expressed for a short period via legal channels in 1930. The removal of the Law on the Maintenance of Order in 1929 had initiated a new atmosphere of tolerance towards the opposition. Three political parties were founded in 1930, the Free Republican Party\n\n24\n\nISLAM AND SECULARISM IN TURKEY\n\n(Serbest Cumhuriyet Fırkası) (FRP) being one of them.9 The FRP was established on 12 August with the encouragement of Mustafa Kemal, under the leadership of Fethi [Okyar] (1880–1943).10 Ahmet Ağaoğlu was also among the founders of this party. The FRP won considerable support shortly after its foundation. Two Istanbul-based daily newspapers, Arif Oruç’s (1895–1950) Yarın (Tomorrow) and Mehmet Zekeriya’s (Sertel, 1890–1980) Son Posta (The Last Mail), began to criticize the government of İsmet [İnönü] and supported the new opposition party. The party was successful, especially in western Anatolia where the export-oriented agricultural region of İzmir and its hinterland had been hit by the Economic Depression of 1929.11 Peasants and merchants in this region, as well as the urban and educated groups who resented the RPP’s authoritarian rule, expressed their discontent via the new party (Emrence 1999 and 2000). The latter followed a strategy of criticizing the RPP’s economic policies and, in the absence of any other channel, attracted all antiregime groups including those who opposed the government’s secularist policies (Sencer 1971: 142). The discontent of the masses and the support they gave to the FRP surfaced, particularly during anti-government demonstrations held in İzmir on the occasion of the visit of the FRP leaders to the city (Weiker 1973: 88–91, 135). The grassroots movement against the government, especially in western Anatolia, alarmed the RPP leadership, who blamed the new party for being used by reactionaries and enemies of the regime.12 Yet, the autobiographical accounts of the two leaders of the FRP, Ahmet Ağaoğlu and Fethi [Okyar], show that at least the leadership of the FRP did not have any intention of appealing to the religious feelings of the masses (Ağaoğlu 1994; Okyar and Seyitdanlıoğlu 1997). After the municipal elections in October 1930, the RPP leaders increased their attacks against the opposition party. Despite the electoral fraud of the RPP bureaucracy, the FRP had won the majority of votes in these local elections in about 40 of the 502 constituencies.13 Most of these were in the provinces of Aydın and İzmir, and among them was the small town of Menemen, situated 30 kilometers away from the city of İzmir, where the notorious uprising would take place in December of the same year. The fact that the reactionary uprising of Menemen occurred in a town where the opposition party had won popular support led the RPP leaders and later commentators to infer that there was a link between the uprising and the FRP. Although the latter was dissolved on 16 November 1930 by its leaders, who were no longer supported by Mustafa Kemal (Emrence 2000; Ağaoğlu 1994: 109–15; Okyar and Seyitdanlıoğlu 1997), the link between the FRP and the Menemen Incident is still stressed by official historiography. History textbooks for Turkish secondary schools categorize the Menemen Incident in a subsection of the part titled “Attempts to initiate the multi-\n\nTHE MENEMEN INCIDENT\n\n25\n\nparty system and reactions against the Revolution” (Şenünver et al. 2005; Su and Duru 1982: 292–6; Kara 1994). The selected “reactionary rebellions”, the Sheikh Said Rebellion of 1925 and the Menemen Incident of 1930, are covered in these textbooks in conjunction with the opposition political parties, the Progressive Republican Party and the FRP. Both rebellions are associated with the formation of these parties, with the implication that their leaders abused the freer atmosphere and Mustafa Kemal’s search for democracy (Ersanlı Behar 1996: 229–30). Kemalist historiography, which is reflected in these textbooks, not only echoes the RPP leaders who felt threatened by the popular support of the FRP in the autumn of 1930, but also legitimizes the continuation of the single-party regime.14 In this discourse, democracy should be delayed in order to protect it from fanatics or enemies of the regime who use religion for political ends. However, there is no proof of a connection between the FRP and the participants of the Menemen uprising. We can only suggest, following Rustow and Weiker, that the rebels might have been inspired by the general expression of social and economic dissatisfaction and the consequent support that the masses extended to the opposition party in their region (Weiker 1973: 138; Rustow 1957: 88). Reactionary rebels: deeds and words The following account of the rebels’ actions is largely based on the speeches they made during court trials held in Menemen.15 The protagonists of the uprising were seven men from Manisa, a city situated 50 kilometers away from Menemen. The leader of the group was Mehmed, who was known as Giritli Mehmed (Mehmed from Crete, implying that he was an immigrant from Crete) and who was also referred to in the press as Derviş Mehmed. He was said to be a disciple of a Naqshbandi sheikh (Sheikh Ahmet Muhtar Efendi from Alaşehir) and the one who introduced other members of the group to this illegal Sufi order. These were mosty illiterate young men from Manisa with names referring to their occupations: Sütçü (milkman) Mehmed, Şamdan Mehmed, Mehmed Emin, Nalıncı (wooden shoe maker) Hasan, Küçük (young) or Giritli (Cretan) Hasan, and Çoban (shepherd) Ramazan.16 This group, which led the Menemen uprising, had been already active in the nearby city of Manisa. There, they had met Derviş Mehmed, who interpreted their dreams and continuously told them to perform the zikir, i.e. to cite the name of God (TBMM 1931: 8–9).17 The group began to grow beards (Ibid.: 11) and met for zikir in the coffeehouse of a certain Çırak (Apprentice) Mustafa. After the coffeehouse was closed down by the government, which had learned of these illegal gatherings, they began to meet in the house of a certain Hüseyin. In these meetings, Derviş Mehmed was said to have indoctrinated them against the government and to have told\n\n26\n\nISLAM AND SECULARISM IN TURKEY\n\nthem that all state officials who let their wives and daughters wear inappropriate clothes were infidels (Ibid.: 9). During one of these meetings, held on 6 December 1930, Derviş Mehmed told the group that they would perform zikir in a cave outside town for 15 days, at the end of which he would receive divine inspiration, as had happened to the prophet. He told them that he would go as far as China and then Europe to call people to religion, and that he would reopen the dervish lodges in the country – which were closed by the state in 1925 (Ibid.: 74). At that stage, he did not mention any plans concerning Menemen. Firstly, Derviş Mehmed, Sütçü Mehmed and Şamdan Mehmed left Manisa (Ibid.: 11). They met with the others in the village of Paşa Köy, where they stayed in the houses of Derviş Mehmed’s mother-in-law and brother-in-law. Here, Derviş Mehmed, who had already armed himself in Manisa, obtained two more weapons. He also took a dog into his company, which he symbolically named Kıtmir, after the Koranic story of Eshab-ı Kehf (those of the cave).18 According to the story, Kıtmir is the name of the dog which accompanied the Eshab-ı Kehf, a group of seven youths who were to be the helpers of the Mehdi.19 Even the number of Derviş Mehmed’s own group, seven, was not arbitrary, showing that he wanted to enact the Koranic story of Eshab-ı Kehf with his disciples. However, the group continued as a group of six, after Ramazan deserted them on the way to the nearby village, Bozalan. In Bozalan, they first stayed in the house of Mustafa, a relative of Sütçü Mehmed, and told the people in the village that they had come to hunt. They moved to a hut that the villagers had built for them in a wood outside the village after about seven to ten days. During their 15-day stay in Bozalan, they spent their time smoking hashish and performing zikir. Here, Derviş Mehmed declared himself the Mehdi and said that his companions were the Eshab-ı Kehf (TBMM 1931: 14). According to Mehmed Emin and Nalıncı Hasan, some villagers believed him, while others did not but did not interfere. According to Goloğlu, a scholar who wrote a book on reactions against the Kemalist reforms during the early republican period, the village of Bozalan was populated with immigrants who came from the Balkans in 1924. Although they were Muslim, they did not have any knowledge of Islam; hence it was easy for Derviş Mehmed to proclaim himself the Mehdi without being challenged (Goloğlu 1972: 303–4). It seems, however, more reasonable to argue that even if the villagers believed in the Mehdi, they did so because of their familiarity with a common Islamic vocabulary rather than their ignorance. A messianic expectation, i.e. the belief in the Mehdi who will come to redeem the world and render it just, as the prophet Muhammed once did, has been part and parcel of both Shiite and Sunni traditions in Islam (Sarıtoprak 2002). The messianic characteristic of the event should, however,\n\nTHE MENEMEN INCIDENT\n\n27\n\nbe considered in the context of people’s social and economic situation in the region at the time. This messianic character of the event needs to be understood in the context of people’s difficult social and economic situation in the region at the time. Hikmet Kıvılcımlı (1902–71), a leading communist thinker who analyzed the rebellion from the perspective of its protagonists, interpreted the villagers’ support for the rebels as resulting from their total lack of allegiance to the Kemalist state (Kıvılcımlı 1980: 226–7). Besides criticizing the Kemalist elite’s inability to see the material conditions that led to the rebellion (Ibid.: 218), he argued that people had not just been deceived by the reactionary sheikhs who claimed that religion was in danger, but in fact needed to be deceived (Ibid.: 233–4) as the only way to express their protest against “the oppression and robbery of the Kemalist bourgeoisie” (Ibid.: 205). Kıvılcımlı’s explanation concerning the motivations of peasants is, however, no more than speculation, albeit a rather convincing one given the economic conditions of the period. Hamit Bozarslan drew attention to Kıvılcımlı’s approach and focused on the event as a “millenarian movement” which can be understood within its religious, economic and political context (Bozarslan 1991: 83).20 The people’s resentment of the state because of their worsened socioeconomic condition, which was also reflected in the results of the local elections, might have provided an atmosphere prone to a rebellion. Furthermore, if some villagers helped – if not recognized – Derviş Mehmed as the Mehdi, it is possible that they at least believed in the need to restore Islam for bettering their situation. The peasants’ support can also be explained by the mere fact that the villages where the rebellious group camped were the villages of their close relatives.21 In any case, the real motive of those who hosted the rebels is difficult to discern. On the whole, however, the details of the rebels’ actions preceding their arrival in Menemen show that they were not simply vicious outcasts who appeared suddenly in Menemen as narrated in the official historiography. Derviş Mehmed’s plan to go to Menemen was made known to the group during their stay in the village of Bozalan. According to the plan, they would stay one night in the house of Saffet Hoca,22 an official preacher in Menemen. From there they would send telegrams to Sheikh Esad in Istanbul and other sheikhs, and after invading Manisa, Ankara and other towns, they would take over the government, restore the Caliphate, reopen the dervish lodges and appoint sheikhs in every town (TBMM 1931: 10). Yet, it is not clear whether the villagers knew of this plan or not, nor is there any proof that Sheikh Esad in Istanbul or Saffet Hoca in Menemen knew about the Mehdi and his Eshab-ı Kehf. The link between the group of Derviş Mehmed and sheikhs in the upper echelons of the Naqshbandi order remains obscure.\n\n28\n\nISLAM AND SECULARISM IN TURKEY\n\nFigure 1.

Neither the court speeches of the three companions of Derviş Mehmed nor the final indictment of the prosecutor include any substantial detail which could explain these points. The group arrived in Menemen on the morning of 23 December. They first stopped at a mosque in the center of the town. After Nalıncı Hasan took the green banner of the mosque, Derviş Mehmed announced to the people there for morning prayer that he was the Mehdi and would restore the religion. He showed them the dog, Kıtmir, as proof, and told them that an army of the Caliphate with seventy thousand soldiers was on its way to the town. Later, Küçük Hasan and Mehdi or Derviş Mehmed began a tour of the town, calling on the locals to join their revolt against the infidel state. While declaring rebellion in the streets of the town, Derviş Mehmed at one point talked to Saffet Hoca, but the latter did not join the rebellious group (Üstün 1990: 13). The rebels came to the square in front of the government office (Hükümet Konağı) and began to perform zikir, together with a crowd of around a hundred people. As the group was reciting zikir in the town square and waiting for more people to join them under the green banner, one gendarme, Ali Efendi, and later the commander of the gendarmerie, Fahri Bey, asked Derviş Mehmed to disperse the crowd. Mehmed repeated that he was the Mehdi (TBMM 1931: 15), that he would declare the şeriat (Islamic law) and that no one could stop him. Gendarmes attempted to disperse the crowd, but they were ineffective, because their weapons were not armed with real bullets (Türkiye Cumhuriyeti’nde Ayaklanmalar 1924–1938, 1972: 363). Unable to stop the rebels, the commander left the square and asked for reinforcements from the military barracks, which was on a hill close to the town center. People in the square began to applaud the Mehdi, who had proved at least for a while that no bullet could kill him. On the request of the commander, a reserve officer, Mustafa Fehmi Kubilay, was put in charge of ending the disturbance. Kubilay arrived at the town square with his squad of ten soldiers (Kan Demir 1931: 33). He tried to intervene alone and unarmed, leaving his soldiers behind. He pulled at Derviş Mehmed’s collar and told him to surrender.23 Mehmed refused, and shot him in the leg. The wounded officer tried to walk away towards a mosque adjacent to the government office, but after a while fell down. Derviş Mehmed found the officer in front of the mosque, cut his head off with a saw, and displayed the head on top of the green banner.24 The crowd watched and even applauded the rebels who continued to perform zikir (TBMM 1931: 15). The terror and shock of the rebels’ act of defiance had a paralyzing effect on the squad and the commander of the gendarmerie who was waiting at the government office. It was only after the arrival of\n\nTHE MENEMEN INCIDENT\n\n31\n\nreinforcements that the uprising could be stopped. During the skirmish, two village guards, Hasan and Şevki, were killed while trying to stop the rebels. Among the rebels, Derviş Mehmed, Sütçü Mehmed and Şamdan Mehmed were shot dead, while Mehmed Emin was wounded. Nalıncı Hasan and Küçük Hasan managed to escape, although they were arrested in Manisa three days later. As will be shown in the following section, official historiography selectively reconstructed the Menemen event, centering it around Kubilay’s death. In order to do so, it omitted and misconstrued historical details, highlighted in my own reconstruction of the event, namely: 1) that the protagonists of the rebellion were not from Menemen but from Manisa; 2) that the whole event in Menemen lasted only a few hours; 3) that the casualties were largely caused by the inefficiency of the security forces; 4) that there is no evidence that Derviş Mehmed planned the rebellion in collaboration with larger Sufi networks. An awareness of these facts sets the stage for a better evaluation of the exaggerated measures taken by the government to restore its authority. Restoration of authority and the specter of irtica The rebellion in Menemen was transformed into a national issue and a tool of official propaganda by the political elite in Ankara. Apparently shaken by the violence of the rebels and the people’s alleged collaboration with them, the government aimed to restore its authority. It was the alleged collaboration of the people that most disturbed the political leadership. On 28 December, Mustafa Kemal’s message to the Chief of the General Staff, Fevzi Çakmak, was published on the front page of the newspapers. The message condemned the townspeople who had applauded the brutality of the reactionaries as disgraceful and continued as follows: The nation will certainly regard this attack against the young and heroic officer, in a region which had the bitter experience of occupation, as a conspiracy against the Republic itself, and will pursue the perpetrators accordingly.25\n\nThe Prime Minister, İsmet [İnönü], also expressed his disappointment, which was caused by the fact that this reactionary movement had taken place not in the eastern regions – as had the Kurdish Rebellion of 1925, the protests against the “Hat Revolutio"
