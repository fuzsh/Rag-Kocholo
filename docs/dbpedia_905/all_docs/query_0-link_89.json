        "text": "BPA Worldwide audits the circulation of primarily business-to-business and consumer magazines. It also provides audit services for newspapers, Web sites, events, email newsletters, digital magazines and other advertiser-supported media produced by its members. comes from the media owners and advertisers.\n\nBPA Worldwide is similar to Audit Bureau of Circulations, providing independent, third-party verified data that media owners provide to media buyers and advertisers.\n\nBPA Worldwide audited data provides media owners, advertisers and advertising agencies with independent assurance that they are reaching the right audiences.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1931, Controlled Circulation Audit Inc opened it's doors in New York, New York. (CCA). Their first audit, Drug Topics, was completed in September of that year.\n\nIn 1946, they became the first firm to equally audit titles that practiced paid circulation, non-paid circulation, or a combination thereof. The first BPA audit to report paid and controlled circulation on single report was released in 1953.\n\nIn 1954, the CCA changed its name to BPA, which at the time stood for Business Publications Audit of Circulation, Inc. It was in this same year that they opened their first satellite office in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nBPA became truly \"worldwide\" in 1970 after completing the audit of Vision - the first European title. In 1976, the Supplementary Audit of product usage and buying influence was introduced. This report allowed publishers to provide advertisers with demographics out what products their readers were currently using, as well as their role in making future purchases.\n\nIn 1980, the first audit of pass-along individuals is conducted for [Architectural Record] . This new report uses surveys to qualified subscribers to determine how many additional individuals also read their copy of the publication.\n\nIn 1985, BPA opened their West Coast office in Los Angeles.\n\nBy 1990, the count of business publication members reached 1,200 members. In 1995, BPA was changed to BPA International with the addition of their first overseas office in London. In 1998, the Canadian Circulations Audit Board (CCAB) merged with BPA International. With the addition of their audited titles, total media owner membership exceeded 2,500 members.\n\nEntering the new century, BPA decided to change the business model they had operated under for the past seventy years and decided that rather than having auditors travel on-site to perform audits at their clients offices, they would have clients ship them \"boxed\" audits of materials required. This change was made possible since the majority of clients records were being stored electronically and through the ease of using the internet to communicate. By 2002, BPA downsized its satellite offices in the US and moved it's headquarters to Shelton, CT. By 2003, more than 70% of all US audits were \"boxed\" and sent to Connecticut.\n\nIn 2004, BPA International changed its name to BPA Worldwide. This coincided with the opening of an office in Bejing, China. In 2006, they expanded their global reach into the Middle East with an office in Dubai Media City.\n\nMembership\n\nBPA Worldwide currently audits more than 2,500 media properties in over 20 countries.
