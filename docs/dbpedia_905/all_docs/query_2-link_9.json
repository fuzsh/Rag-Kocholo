        "text": "Food waste and I have a history.\n\nOne childhood memory, from the family table in Mumbai, still plays on a loop in my mind: “Don’t waste your food,” my mother would admonish daily. “Too many starving children everywhere,” my father would chime in.\n\nDecades later, now living in New York City, I still can’t toss those leftovers. At least not like some of my friends do, with cool nonchalance, or like restaurants and shops regularly do when they’ve prepared too much.\n\nSo, I decided to try Too Good To Go, one of several apps that connect eaters with unsold restaurant food. It claims to have 155,000 businesses, like restaurants and markets, that offer surplus meals, often discounted, to about 85 million users worldwide.\n\nThe goal is to save money, anxiety and some greenhouse gases. Worldwide, discarded food accounts for 8 to 10 percent of planet-warming emissions. That’s because rotting food produces heat-trapping methane gas.\n\nHere’s what I got during my weeklong experiment, all around Manhattan, trying to keep some of those meals out of the bin.\n\nSunday, Jan. 28\n\n• Two one-quart containers of soup: Chicken and rice and a creamy tomato\n\n• Potato chips\n\n• One focaccia sandwich with mozzarella, tomato and sautéed mushrooms\n\n• One croissant"
