        "text": "An appeals court in Oman overturned a decision to close the daily Al Zaman newspaper on Monday, a rights group has said.\n\nAccording to the Gulf Centre for Human Rights, the court also decided to acquit journalist Zaher Al Abri. The newspaper’s deputy editor-in-chief, Youssef Al Haj, received a year-long prison sentence, however, while editor-in-chief Ibrahim Al Maamari received a six-month sentence, the centre said. Both men remain free pending an appeal to Oman’s highest court.\n\nOmani state media did not immediately report on the court’s decision.\n\nThe case against the Arabic language newspaper began in August after it published an article alleging corruption in a court case.\n\n*Associated Press"
