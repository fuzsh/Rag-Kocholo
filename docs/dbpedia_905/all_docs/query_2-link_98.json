        "text": "The United States called Monday for all sides to avoid violence in Bangladesh, where long-ruling prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled following protests.\n\n“We urge all parties to refrain from further violence. Too many lives have been lost over the course of the past several weeks, and we urge calm and restraint in the days ahead,” State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.\n\n“We welcome the announcement of an interim government and urge any transition be conducted in accordance with Bangladesh’s laws,” he said.\n\nMiller said the United States was “deeply saddened about the reports of human rights abuses, casualties and injuries over the weekend and past weeks.”\n\n-AFP\n\nSajeeb Wazed Joy, son of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, said his mother would not make a political comeback as she is “deeply disappointed” by the uprising against her leadership despite her efforts for the betterment of Bangladesh, Dhaka Tribune reported.\n\nJoy, who served as an official adviser to the former prime minister until Monday, said in an interview with a British public service broadcaster’s Newshour program that Sheikh Hasina had been contemplating resignation since Sunday and had left the country for her safety following pressure from her family.\n\n“She has turned Bangladesh around. When she took over power it was considered a failing state. It was a poor country. Until today it was considered one of the rising tigers of Asia,” Joy said, defending his mother’s record in office, Dhaka Tribune reported.\n\n-ANI\n\nBritain on Monday called for “swift action” to restore democracy in Bangladesh even as reports of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina seeking UK asylum emerged from India, where she arrived after fleeing Dhaka amid violent protests.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s official spokesperson told reporters during a briefing at 10 Downing Street that he was “deeply saddened” by the violence in Bangladesh in recent weeks.\n\nIt came as crowds gathered in the heavily British Bangladeshi hub of east London waving the country’s flag in celebration of Hasina’s downfall.\n\n“We hope that swift action is taken to ensure that democracy prevails and accelerate the process towards peace and security for people in Bangladesh,” Starmer’s spokesperson said in response to a question on the situation in Bangladesh.\n\n-PTI\n\nAmid a political turmoil and unrest in Bangladesh, a former Indian high commissioner to Dhaka has cautioned that India will have to be “very vigilant” on the border in the wake of the crisis even as he asserted that New Delhi will be “prepared for all eventualities”.\n\nPankaj Saran, a veteran diplomat and former envoy of India to Bangladesh during whose tenure the historic Land Boundary Agreement (LBA) was ratified by the Indian parliament in 2015, said one cannot say when would things settle down in the neighbouring country.\n\n“We will just have to wait for different political forces to kind of find some equilibrium inside Bangladesh,” he said.\n\n“The last two days saw an escalation in the level of protests. Therefore, some decisions had to be taken about how to go forward in controlling the protests.\n\n“I think, the situation reached a point where it was clear that curfews and other restrictions were not adequate. Police and security forces’ actions were not adequate and the only resort that was left was to bring in the army,” he told PTI.\n\n-PTI\n\nAmid the ongoing crisis in Bangladesh after the resignation of Sheikh Hasina, the Meghalaya Government imposed a night curfew in the State along the Indo-Bangladesh border.\n\nToday, Meghalaya Deputy Chief Minister Prestone Tynsong said that in view of the current situation in Bangladesh, the Meghalaya government had decided to impose night curfew along the Indo-Bangladesh border from tonight.\n\nThe curfew had been imposed from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. on the international border with Bangladesh within 200 meters of the border line inside Indian territory, upon the advice of the Border Security Force (BSF).
