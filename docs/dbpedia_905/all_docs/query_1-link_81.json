        "text": "Photo: AFP\n\nTurkish police have raided the offices of the opposition Zaman newspaper, hours after a court ruling placed it under state control, the BBC reports.\n\nPolice entered the building in Istanbul late on Friday, firing tear gas at protesters who had gathered outside.\n\nZaman is closely linked to the Hizmet movement of influential US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen.\n\nTurkey says Hizmet is a “terrorist” group aiming to overthrow President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government.\n\nMr Gulen was once an ally of Mr Erdogan but the two fell out.\n\nMany Hizmet supporters have been arrested.\n\nThe government in Ankara has come under increasing international criticism over its treatment of journalists."
