The facility inaugurated in 2018 also provides scope for research on the literary works of revolutionary poet Kazi Nazrul Islam.\n\nSources said a screening of the Shyam Benegal-directed biopic on Sheikh Mujibur Rahman -- 'Mujib - The Making of a Nation' -- was scheduled to be screened at the Bangladesh Bhavan this month, which now stands postponed indefinitely owing to the volatile situation in the neighbouring country.\n\nAug 06, 2024 22:05 (IST)\n\n''Regained Freedom'': After Sheikh Hasina's Ouster, Bangladeshis Dream Of Better Future\n\nOne day after the military took control of Bangladesh following the ouster of the prime minister, the parliament in the capital Dhaka was busy with protesters coming to celebrate.\n\nMore than a month of deadly protests in which at least 422 people were killed culminated Monday in the deadliest day of violence and the end of the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina, who fled by helicopter to India.\n\n\"It's the freedom of the young generation,\" said student Parvez Hossain, 30, among the crowds in front of the building, which was empty of lawmakers after parliament was dissolved.

It dismissed the lower court order and directed that 93% of jobs should be open to candidates on merit.\n\nThe court reserved 5% of jobs for family members of independence fighters and 2% for people from so-called backward groups and the disabled.\n\nThe students had stepped up their protest when Hasina refused to meet their demands, citing the court proceedings.\n\nShe called the protesters \"razakar\", an offensive term for those accused of collaborating with Pakistan's army in 1971 to betray the country.\n\nAug 06, 2024 21:02 (IST)\n\n\"19,000 Indians In Bangladesh, Of Which 9,000 Are Students\": S Jaishankar\n\nAmid political unrest in Bangladesh, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday said that there are an estimated 19,000 Indian nationals in the country, of which about 9,000 are students, while giving an assurance that the government is in close contact with the Indian community in Dhaka.\n\nMr Jaishankar informed the Lok Sabha that the bulk of the students returned to India in July.

The United States on Monday praised the role of the military, pointing to reports that it resisted Hasina's calls to continue using force.\n\nThe Bangladesh military has said that it will set up an interim government.\n\nAug 06, 2024 20:59 (IST)\n\nBangladesh Unrest: Border Force Asks Locals To Not Venture Near Border\n\nThe Border Security Force (BSF) has asked locals residing along the 4,096 km-long India-Bangladesh international border to not undertake unnecessary movement in the frontier areas especially during the night in the wake of the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government in Dhaka, officials said on Tuesday.\n\nBSF Director General (Acting) Daljit Singh Chawdhary continued his border tour for the second day as he visited integrated check post (ICP) Petrapole, the largest such facility in South Asia located at a distance of about 80 km from Kolkata, and a \"highly sensitive\" border post of the force in the North 24 Paraganas district along the front.\n\nAug 06, 2024 20:44 (IST)\n\nWhat RSS Leader Said On Safety Of Hindus In Violence-Hit Bangladesh\n\nSenior RSS leader Bhaiyyaji Joshi on Tuesday said the organisation \"is requesting the government\" to ensure safety of the Hindus in neighbouring Bangladesh which is in the midst of political turmoil.\n\nThere have been reports about the minority Hindu community being targeted, said Joshi, a member of the Akhil Bharatiya Executive of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and its former general secretary.\n\nAug 06, 2024 20:41 (IST)\n\nBangladesh Unrest: Border Force Reviews Border Security In Assam\n\nThe BSF has reviewed security along the India-Bangladesh border in Assam following the ongoing turmoil in the neighbouring country, an official said on Tuesday.\n\nHigh alert has been sounded along BSF's Guwahati Frontier of Indo-Bangladesh border with commanders at all levels being asked to maintain utmost vigilance.\n\nIntelligence operations have been intensified to ensure timely detection and neutralisation of any threat, the BSF spokesperson added.\n\nHe said the security situation along the international border under the Guwahati Frontier of BSF has been reviewed \"anticipating various contingencies\".\n\n\"A state of high alert has been declared to address any potential security threat.

Inflation hovers around 10% per year and dollar reserves have shrunk to just three months of import cover.\n\nMultilateral lenders will be closely watching the next steps taken by the government and the military.\n\n\"A military coup, in legal terms, would put at risk fresh external sovereign debt from multilaterals,\" Hasnain Malik of Tellimer said.\n\nAug 06, 2024 19:42 (IST)\n\nBangladesh President Meets Key Coordinators Of Students' Movement\n\nBangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin on Tuesday met with the key coordinators of the anti-discrimination student movement at the Bangabhaban to discuss the current situation and the shape of the interim government, media reports said.\n\nCiting one of the coordinators, Bengali language daily Prothom Alo reported that the meeting started on Tuesday evening.\n\n\"A group of 13 members of the anti-discrimination student movement is holding a meeting with the President and the three armed forces chiefs at Bangabhaban regarding the current situation and the shape of the interim government,\" the paper said.\n\nPresident Shahabuddin earlier in the day dissolved the parliament to make way for the formation of an interim administration.\n\nOfficials said a full-fledged interim government is expected to be announced later Tuesday.\n\nAug 06, 2024 19:40 (IST)\n\nBangladesh Unrest Live\n\nSeveral Indian doctors staying in Bangladesh have chosen to remain in violence-hit Dhaka, performing their duty to save lives, even as worries about their own safety have kept their parents concerned back home.\n\nThere is a scarcity of resources and doctors are overburdened amid an overnight spike in the number of casualties in many Dhaka hospitals, several Indian medical practitioners in Bangladesh said.\n\nTalking to PTI, they said they are drawn by a \"sense of duty\" and have stepped in to help the hospitals deal with the ongoing crisis.\n\nAug 06, 2024 19:33 (IST)\n\nBangladesh Unrest Live\n\nThe Maharashtra government has set up a team of officials to facilitate safe return of about 20 students from the state who are studying in Bangladesh.\n\nA list of these students has been shared with the Ministry of External Affairs, the chief minister's office said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nAbout 20 students from Maharashtra are in the neighbouring country, beset by a political crisis following widespread protests and resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, as per the officials.\n\nAug 06, 2024 19:33 (IST)\n\nBangladesh Unrest Live\n\nBorder Security Force (BSF) on Tuesday said that the curfew along the India-Bangladesh border will be strictly monitored in the wake of the illegal infiltrations following the political turmoil in Bangladesh.\n\nBSF DIG and Spokesperson, South Bengal Frontier, A K Arya, said that meetings were held with villagers at the Uttarpara and Mustafapur Border Outpost to discuss the prevailing situation in Bangladesh after the change of power.\n\nAug 06, 2024 19:32 (IST)\n\nBangladesh Unrest Live\n\nExternal Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told an all-party meeting on Tuesday that Bangladeshi leader Sheikh Hasina, who has arrived in India after quitting as prime minister following extraordinary protests in the neighbouring country against her rule, was in shock at the turn of events, sources said.\n\nThe government is giving her time to recover, before enquiring about her future plans, S Jaishankar said, briefing political leaders in the Parliament House.\n\nThe minister said India has spoken to the Bangladesh Army chief to ensure the safety of more than 10,000 Indian students in that country and also taken up the issue of attacks on Hindu minorities, according to a couple of leaders who attended the meeting.\n\nAug 06, 2024 19:32 (IST)\n\nBangladesh Unrest Live\n\nIn the wake of the civil unrest in Bangladesh, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde on Tuesday spoke to the Ministry of External Affairs for the safe and early return of students from the state stuck there.\n\nShinde's intervention came amid questions being raised about the safety of foreign nationals in the neighbouring country, especially the students stranded in the troubled areas.\n\n\"We give the highest priority to the safety of our students.

As Hon'ble Members are aware, India-Bangladesh relations have been exceptionally close for many decades over many governments. Concern about recent violence and instability there is shared across the political spectrum.\n\n2. Since the election in January 2024, there has been considerable tensions, deep divides and growing polarization in Bangladesh politics. This underlying foundation aggravated a student agitation that started in June this year. There was growing violence, including attacks on public buildings and infrastructure, as well as traffic and rail obstructions. The violence continued through the month of July. Throughout this period, we repeatedly counselled restraint and urged that the situation be defused through dialogue. Similar urgings were made to various political forces with whom we were in touch.\n\n3. Sir, despite a Supreme Court judgement on 21 July, there was no let-up in the public agitation. Various decisions and actions taken thereafter only exacerbated the situation. The agitation at this stage coalesced around a one-point agenda, that is that the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina should step down.\n\n4. On 4th August, events took a very serious turn. Attacks on police, including police stations and government installations, intensified even as overall levels of violence greatly escalated. Properties of individuals associated with the regime were torched across the country. What was particularly worrying was that minorities, their businesses and temples also came under attack at multiple locations. The full extent of this is still not clear.\n\n5. Sir, On 5th August, demonstrators converged in Dhaka despite the curfew. Our understanding is that after a meeting with leaders of the security establishment, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina apparently made the decision to resign. At very short notice, she requested approval to come for the moment to India. We simultaneously received a request for flight clearance from Bangladesh authorities. She arrived yesterday evening in Delhi.\n\n6. The situation in Bangladesh Sir, is still evolving. The Army Chief, General Waker-uz-Zaman, addressed the nation on 5th August. He spoke about assuming responsibility and constituting an interim government.\n\n7. We are in close and continuous touch with the Indian community in Bangladesh through our diplomatic missions. There are an estimated 19,000 Indian nationals there, of which about 9,000 are students. The bulk of the students have already returned to India in the month of July on the advice of the High Commission. In terms of our diplomatic presence, in addition to the High Commission in Dhaka, we have Assistant High Commissions in Chittagong, Rajshahi, Khulna and Sylhet. It is our expectation that the host government will provide the required security protection for these establishments. We look forward to their normal functioning once the situation stabilizes.\n\n8. Chairman Sir, we are also monitoring the situation with regard to the status of minorities. There are reports of initiatives by various groups and organizations to ensure their protection and well-being. We welcome that, but will naturally remain deeply concerned till law and order is visibly restored. Our border guarding forces have also been instructed to be exceptionally alert in view of this complex situation.\n\n9. In the last 24 hours, we have also been in regular touch with the authorities in Dhaka. This is the situation as of now. I seek the understanding and support of the House in regard to sensitive issues regarding an important neighbour on which there has always been strong national consensus.\"\n\nAug 06, 2024 14:33 (IST)\n\nLIVE: S Jaishankar Addresses Parliament Over Bangladesh Turmoil\n\n\"The situation is still evolving in Bangladesh, we are in close touch with the Indian community there,\" said Foreign minister S Jaishankar addressing the Parliament.\n\nAug 06, 2024 13:54 (IST)\n\nSecurity Meet, And A Phone Call: The Hours Before Sheikh Hasina's Escape\n\nSheikh Hasina did not want to resign as Bangladesh Prime Minister and wanted security forces to intensify the crackdown on nationwide protests, but security bosses said the protests cannot be contained by force, according to a report in Prothom Alo.\n\nAug 06, 2024 13:53 (IST)\n\nEx-PM, Nobel Winner, Student Leader: Key Faces In New Bangladesh Government\n\nA new \"interim government\" - to be advised, most likely, by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus - is taking shape in crisis-hit Bangladesh following Sheikh Hasina resigning as Prime Minister.\n\nBangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin gave his assent late Monday for that temporary administration.\n\nAug 06, 2024 11:50 (IST)\n\nSheikh Hasina In India Amid Bangla Turmoil, What S Jaishankar Said On Centre's Plan\n\nAt the all-party meeting on Bangladesh turmoil, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar said they want to give time to Sheikh Hasina - who is currently in Delhi - to let the Centre know about her future course of action, it is learnt.
