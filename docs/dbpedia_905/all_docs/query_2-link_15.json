        "text": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s simmering hostility toward the media boiled over in March, culminating in the takeover of the country’s largest newspaper and its second-largest news agency. The government raided the Cihan news agency on March 7, just days after police took control of the headquarters of Zaman newspaper, forcing their way in while firing tear gas and water cannons to repel protesters. These were only the latest moves in the increasingly authoritarian leader’s media crackdown, but they have left many reeling over the prospect of widespread censorship in a country critical to security.\n\nOn March 30, the OPC is sponsoring a program to analyze the events in Turkey and how journalists can fight back.
