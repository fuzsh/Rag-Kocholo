Let’s eat sweet, talk sweet... This is one of the most frequently used proverbs in Turkey: let’s eat sweet, talk sweet... This is why we always offer our guests candy, in order to open the gate of a sweet conversation. We celebrate friendships reconstituted after a resentment by eating dessert... Name of “Ramadan Feast” when children go knock one door after another to collect candies, turned into “Sugar Feast” and we feel happy to host our guests with dessert on both feasts. The prize of our bets and competition is generally a tray of baklava, and both winner and the defeated get their shares. Nearly every city has its own dessert or even sweet. In a nutshell, Turkey is a “Land of Dessert”... This traditional diversity and rich tastes are now reflected into our product portfolio. Hundreds of different products that are produced untouched by human hands in our modern plants, are exported to nearly 200 countries. Our products sweeten billions of mouths all over the world. It is highly probable to see our industry among the top 10 of the world confectionary export league in 2023, the 100th anniversary of our Republic, which is now on the 16th place. Our producers enter into new markets on one hand, and take firm steps toward becoming a regional power on the other hand. In reaching this goal, our most significant assistant will be “DelightLand” concept that we created focusing on globally-known “Turkish Delight” and its fellow “Turkish Coffee”. France is known with its perfume, Cuba is known with its cigars, now Turkey will be known with its confectionary. Our biggest advantage will be our traditional tastes, product diversity and innovative production power.

Underlining that they were well aware of the importance of an export driven growth model Minister Zeybekci explains that their priority targets at the Ministry were high value added production, increasing export unit price per kg, decreasing the current account deficit and attracting more direct foreign investments. He also draws attention to the potential of the country. There has been painstaking efforts for the creation of a “Brand Turkey” in the past 18 months under the coordination of the Ministry of Economy and Turkish Exporters Union (TEU), and you have made an impressive effort in this pursuit. How do you think brand Turkey will contribute in our exports? “Turkey: Discover the Potential” logo project is a very significant cooperation be- 6 turkishconfectionery.org.tr DISCOVER THE POTENTIAL tween public and private sectors. We have consulted with business representatives, local and foreign members of the academia and branding experts, and organized many seminars and meetings. The outcome of these rigorous efforts has been the logo and the slogan which we launched with a press meeting on September 28, 2014 at the Çırağan Palace with the participation of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. At the moment we are in the process of preparing the legal infrastructure of its use. We will be sharing the developments pertaining to this issue with the public very soon. We will be seeing the effects of such an exemplary branding on our export figures in the long run, as we continue to give the same messages over and over again to our counterparts in our promotional activities abroad. Certainly there had been other similar endeavors of many different institutions and establishments in the past and we are not going to deny their importance and value but some of them focused on only tourism and others were merely some cultural symbols. That being the case we tried to express ourselves with different and sometimes contradicting symbols which could not properly express our economical power, the potential of our people and our hundreds of years old history. And this made it very difficult for us to introduce ourselves to our counterparts in the way we wanted to. Our new logo will avert this confusion and we will be able to promote our country to our counterparts abroad in a more effective way. If you take close look at the new logo you will see the traces of many civilizations that had flourished in Anatolia, the land we live in for centuries. Within this context our new logo represents our history, culture, cornerstones of our civilization and our future vision as a whole. We have received very positive feedback from both national and international circles after the launching which was attended by our President. I have no doubt that we will achieve our goals in a short time with promo- “SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT CAN BE SUPPORTED BY HIGH VALUE ADDED INVESTMENTS RATHER THAN A CONSUMPTION DRIVEN GROWTH MODEL.” tional activities we are going to organize in the near future, using our new logo and slogan. As a person who had been engaged in trade for many years I can confidently assert that unless your customer knows you and your product well and trusts you, you cannot sell anything no matter how good it may be. Therefore if we can effectively and coherently present our history and the values that determine who we are, we can build healthier relationships with buyers. Despite regional differences 2014 had been a difficult year for the global economy. Do you think this unfavorable economic atmosphere that hinders growth will change in 2015? Despite global recession and political turmoil Turkey’s economic performance in 2014 has been very good and we have created a strong image. After FED ended its bond purchasing program, European Central Bank and Bank of Japan began to pursue quite the opposite policy and started buying bonds, counterbalancing the impact of FED’s decision. I believe in 2015 FED will increase interest rates in a gradual manner over a period of time. In this respect FED’s impact on world markets will be limited. Also we believe that European Central Bank’s decision of implementing expansionary policies designed to invigorate the markets will be a positive development for our country. These upcoming expansionary policies in Europe will increase liquidity which will have a reassuring effect on Turkey and other emerging econo- mies. However it is widely believed that because of the expansionary policies of the ECB , the recent sharp decline of euro/dollar parity will become worse and may see a figure around 1.10. If you take into consideration the fact that half of our exports go to the Euro zone, this will be a negative development in terms of our foreign trade. Of course from Turkey’s perspective the most important recent development in global markets is the decline in oil prices. If this low price trend in oil prices continue in 2015, inflation and interest rates in Turkey will fall and we expect this to be a positive contribution in terms of our growth. On the other hand, because of the expected downward trend in the growth rates of large economies such as Russia, Japan or China, global growth expectations had to be revised in the same way. World Bank had to revise its latest growth forecast for 2015 from 3.4% to 3% and the IMF from 3.8% to 3.5%. Therefore other than the decline in oil prices, it would be wrong to expect the current climate in world markets will be in favor of Turkey in 2015. However against all odds we believe Turkey’s growth performance will be much better compared to 2014. How do you think Turkish economy will be effected by global issues like the timing of FED’s interest rate increase, European economies’ poor performance in terms of desired growth rates, stagnation of Japanese economy and the downward trend in China’s growth? When we look at the general trend in global economy we see regional differences. While European and Japanese economies are facing deflation Chinese economy fails to deliver desired macroeconomic targets. On the other hand it would be fair to say that the US economy is recovering faster than expected. Despite this negative outlook, the European Commission foresees that the growth trend in the EU and Euro zone economies will continue in 2015 and 2016 although not very strongly. Within this framework the expected growth 7 DISCOVER THE POTENTIAL rates in 2015 and 2016 respectively will be 1.5% and 2% for Europe and 1.1% and 1.7% for Euro zone. Moreover ECB devised a 500 billion Euro bond purchasing program to combat deflation. When implemented this program may pull the euro/dollar parity to even lower levels. This may have some negative effects on our exports. On the other hand this incentive package will support the growth of EU economies which happen to be our most important trade partners and consequently create an advantage for our exporters. Also thanks to the expansionist policies they are going to implement, there will be some fund flow to our country. As for the US economy, they are extremely successful in terms of employment and growth figures. At the moment their most important issue is the inflation rate which should be a targeted 2% but stands around 1.3%. At the last FED meeting they came up with a new discourse with regard to interest rates increase which underlines patience rather than the previous “reasonable time” expression. However taking into account the global performance of the country we don’t expect this increase to be a dramatic one. We believe the interest rates will be increased gradually, one bit at a time. To my opinion, if they prefer to extend the interest rates increase over time, this will be a moderate policy concerning Turkey. 8 “TODAY OUR COUNTRY IS THE 22ND LARGEST EXPORTER IN THE WORLD WITH APPROXIMATELY 1 PERCENT SHARE IN WORLD GOODS AND SERVICES TRADE. OUR EXPORTS IN 2014 INCREASED BY 3.9 PERCENT COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND REACHED 157.8 BILLION USD WHILE OUR EXPORTIMPORT RATIO STOOD AT 65.1 PERCENT.” Because of the problems in global economy Turkey is expected to close 2014 with an approximate growth rate of 3.3%. Within this context which issues should Turkey pay attention to in order to achieve its 2015 and MTP targets? Although our expectations with regard to global economy was not fully met, 2014 has been a strong year for Turkey both economically and politically. Turkish economy grew by 2.8% in the first 9 months of 2014. In the past 20 quarters Turkey has achieved an average growth rate of 5.6%. The fact that Turkey has managed to continue growing in a time when growth figures of global economy remain low is very significant. We believe the positive economic performance we have achieved so far in 2014 will continue in 2015 too. The existing medium term program (MTP) of 2015 – 2017 foresees a growth rate of 4% for 2015. Our unemployment and inflation figures are expected to be 9.6% and 6.3% respectively. Although the same MTP targets a current account deficit/ GDP ratio of 5.7% for 2014, I believe we might see a lower figure by the end of the year. The 2015 target for the same ratio is 5.4%. On the other hand, during the last meeting Central Bank decided to drop interbank interest rates by 50 base points. However we cannot say that this resolution was satisfactory. Central Bank may have decreased the benchmark interest rate however they have to ensure an adequate decrease in overnight interest and other areas too. A 50 base point decrease cannot be considered a real decrease. Also the viability of domestic demand should not be overlooked. As a matter of fact in an economy where domestic demand is weak, attaining a sustainable and healthy growth performance would be impossible. Hence in order to achieve a better growth rate turkishconfectionery.org.tr DISCOVER THE POTENTIAL in 2015, domestic demand will have to find a strong momentum. Moreover, in order to attain our above mentioned targets and sustainable growth, we need to engage in high value added production, increase export unit price per kg, decrease the current account deficit and attract more direct foreign investments. Our ministry continues to work towards attaining these goals. Food industry constitutes 18-20 percent of the total production and 27-28 percent of total consumption expenses in Turkey. How do you evaluate the significance and contributions of the sector in Turkey’s economy? In recent years food sector gained significant importance in Turkey especially because of their impact on inflation. Due to unfavorable natural phenomena like lack of rain and frost, our agricultural production slowed down to below average levels in 2014. As a result, agriculture, forestry and fishery industries had to downsize by a serious 4.9 percent in the third quarter of 2014. However this year, if nothing out of the ordinary happens in terms of weather or climate, I believe agricultural production will gain momentum. Consequently I expect food sector to shape up again and stop creating pressure on inflation. Of course as it is the case for every other sector, food industry has to adopt a production understanding that is more in favor of efficiency, R&D and innovation. This way the sector will be able to find new markets to export and get better shares of the markets they have already been operating in. In the first 10 months of 2014 Turkey has set a historical record (in exports). Our targeted export volume for 2015 is 173 billion USD. How do you foresee 2015 in terms of Turkey’s exports? 2014 has been a year of continued uncertainty and the effects of the global crisis were still an is- 2014 HAS BEEN A YEAR OF CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY AND THE EFFECTS OF THE GLOBAL CRISIS WERE STILL AN ISSUE. THE FACT THAT TURKISH ECONOMY HAS CARRIED ON THE PATH OF GROWTH AND EXPORT INCREASE IS A SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT.” sue. The fact that Turkish economy has carried on the path of growth and export increase is a significant achievement. The steady economic growth of the past 20 quarters has continued in 2014 and we have achieved 2.8 percent growth rate in the first three quarters of 2014. Today our country is the 22nd largest exporter in the world with approximately 1 percent share in world goods and services trade. Our exports in 2014 increased by 3.9 percent compared to the previous year and reached 157.8 billion USD while our export-import ratio stood at 65.1 percent. Declared growth figures indicate that our exports continue to significantly contribute to growth, in other words export is the driving force behind our growth. 2015 is expected to be another difficult year for world economy. Economic vulnerabilities in developed countries and instability in our important trade and investment partner Europe still continue. We expect the declining trend in oil prices which began last year to continue and consequently oil driven economies like Russia and Iran to be badly effected in terms of growth and exports. As an outcome of a possible tight monetary policy in the US economy, developing countries are expected to experience capital outflows. These factors constitute a risk for our country’s economy. However thanks to decisive macroeconomic policies and reforms Turkish economy has been no longer fragile for quite a while and therefore I believe possible uncertainties and negative developments won’t make an indelible impact on our economy. That being said, our ministry will be taking measures to be on the safe side. In order to achieve our MTP target of 173 billion USD export volume in 2015 and improve our exports both quantitatively and qualitatively we will be decisively implementing our devised policies, especially the Turkish Export Strategy 2023 plan. We are going to compensate the deficit created by countries with declining oil revenues with our market diversification strategy. We will continue supporting our exporters with dynamic, flexible export incentives that are able to fully respond to today’s competitive environment and needs. Turkish Exporters Assembly (TEA) assumes an important role in export development and creates value added for Turkish economy. What would you say about the role and contribution of TEA and similar sector organizations in the development of Turkish economy? There is no doubt that TEA and similar sector organizations are very important actors in the development of their respective sectors in many aspects from production to marketing. Since these institutions know their sectors very well and have direct contact, they are able to identify problems very accurately and they make every effort to resolve these problems by acting as a guide. As the Ministry of Economy we believe developing a powerful dialogue and cooperation with TEA and similar 9 DISCOVER THE POTENTIAL sector organizations will have significant contributions to our economy. Therefore we put private sector right in the center of our policies, strategies, and other sector related activities, and place great importance on our exporters’ opinions as well as resolving the problems they bring forward. Within this framework we expect such institutions to play an active role in building and implementing all of our ministry’s policies and strategies, and especially those related to their respective sectors. Within this context TEA is a significant institution since it plays an active role not only in the preparation process of the 2023 Turkish Export Strategy but also in the activities carried out within the scope of this strategy document to develop a new export understanding based on R&D, innovation, branding and high technology. This institution organizes many important activities including innovation weeks, Brand Turkey events, design competitions and R&D project markets. Having other sector organizations push on their efforts and continue to implement proactive policies with the same decisiveness as TEA is of vital importance in getting one step closer to our 2023 targets together. In order to achieve an average growth rate of 5 percent and more in the long run, in which areas Turkish economy needs to make progress? Turkey takes firm steps towards achieving 2023 targets. It would be fair to say that exports play a crucial role in order to attain our targeted growth rates and other indicators, and more importantly to attain sustainable and high growth rates. We are well aware of the importance of an export driven growth model. Therefore our priority targets at the Ministry include high value added production, increasing export unit price per kg, decreasing the current account deficit and attracting more direct foreign investments. However exports alone will not be sufficient to achieve our 10 “THE PRIVATE SECTOR HAS TO BE AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE 2023 ECONOMIC TARGETS FOR OUR COUNTRY. AS THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE WE DO OUR BEST TO SUPPORT THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND WE ARE DETERMINED TO DO SO IN THE COMING YEARS.” targets. When we take a look at Japan, world’s third largest economy, and EU countries where growth performance is poor we see a deflation problem caused by lack of domestic demand. Therefore viability of domestic demand is as important as exports in terms of growth performance. This doesn’t necessarily mean a consumption based growth model however an economy with a weak domestic demand issue cannot be expected to perform in a healthy manner. On the other hand one of the most important sources of growth is investments. The best way to accomplish sustainable development is to support high value added investments rather than a consumption driven model. The decision of cutting interest rates which was taken at the last Monetary Policy Committee is late and insufficient but nevertheless will have a positive impact on investments. The Ministry will continue to support investors with various incentives. We also need to make progress in structural areas like education, high turkishconfectionery.org.tr DISCOVER THE POTENTIAL value added production and transition to advanced technology. The country as a whole needs to increase both the time allocated to educational activities and the quality of their content. We should be able to develop training programs to train qualified personnel. Similarly we should rapidly incorporate high technology in our production processes. This way we will be able to export higher value added products and attain higher growth rates in the long run. Turkey has set very ambitious targets for 2023. What is the responsibility of private sector in attaining these targets? Which competencies should we develop in order to lend impetus to the realization of these goals? Private sector has to be aware of the importance of the 2023 economic targets for our country in every step they take. As the representatives of the state we do our level best to support the private sector and we are determined to do so in the coming years. In addition, private actors have to improve their own capacities always one step further. That is to say our companies must be more competent, more innovative in all areas of the standard value chain. They need to broaden their horizons in every step of the value chain from the very beginning of the production process to chain of distribution management, product marketing, foreign market penetration and efficient after sales services. Our expectations from private sector is not limited to having them produce their own products under their own trademarks, put them on overseas markets and take the back seat. Our companies must think about how to further diversify their existing product portfolios in line with global consumer and market trends. We should be strong enough to be able to sell diverse product groups to overseas markets and generate more value added. This is the only way our companies and thereby all of us as a country can develop the capacity of “creating a global brand”. “WE ARE EXPECTING TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS IN A SHORT TIME WITH PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES WE ARE GOING TO ORGANIZE IN THE NEAR FUTURE, USING OUR NEW LOGO AND SLOGAN.” Within this framework as the state representatives we have built all the necessary mechanisms to help private companies to improve their competency in the best way and we will continue to do so. We provide support to all our exporters through programs intended for every step of the value chain, particularly with our TURQUALITY support program and we continue to encourage especially innovation, design and branding activities. In return private sector will secure a more sustainable position in global value chains; create global brands to market higher value added goods and services. We also expect our private sector to take greater initiatives and make business with stronger funds. I consider this issue equally important as value added production, brand creation and a sustainable position in global markets. There is no doubt that SMEs play a vital role in the economic cycle and we are pleased to see how they insert themselves among the ever spinning wheels of business world and thrust themselves on. However in the light of our 2023 targets SMEs will have to expand their horizons and push their limits. If state and public sector join forces in order to accomplish our targets set for the centenary anniversary of the republic I believe we can overcome every single obstacle. 11 DISCOVER THE POTENTIAL “WE WILL CONTINUE TO TELL THE POTENTIAL OF TURKEY TO THE WORLD” T urkey has set strong and ambitious targets for 2023. Accordingly, Turkey not only offers the “Turkey, Discover the Potential” brand to the world, but also invites the people to discover potential. Regarding the new Turkey logo, the Chairman of the Turkish Exporters’ Assembly (TIM) Mehmet Büyükekşi says, “The new long along with the brand represents the highly competitive Turkish brands and high value-added products. It aims to develop and reinforce the perception of Turkish goods abroad in the long term by transferring its positive image to each brand and product group to be labeled with this logo.” What does the new Turkey brand and logo tell us? The production quality adventure of Turkish brands that began in the 1980s by taking part in the international competition lasted at a fast pace until today. Thanks to this process, Turkish goods have become more preferable in many sectors of international markets. This perception of Turkish goods is also reinforced by the progress of Turkish brands abroad especially in recent years as well as their important achievement such as stores opened in major shopping centers and market leadership achieved in certain sectors. Therefore, the new Turkey brand and logo will be used primarily by Promotion Groups in all communication activities of the brands with a capacity to represent the perception of value-added products as it aims to create a positive impact in the long-term. This logo along with the brand represents highly competitive Turkish brands and value-added products. It symbolizes 12 WE HAVE UNVEILED A NEW LOGO AS WE BELIEVE THAT SUCCESSFUL EXPORT BRANDS OF TURKEY MUST WORK BASED ON THE QUALITY PERCEIVED BY CONSUMERS RATHER THAN MANUFACTURERS. high-level perception of Turkish goods to be created in the long term by transferring its positive image to each brand and product group to be labeled with this logo. By taking advantage of communication power generated here, it aims to develop the overall perception of Turkish goods in the future as it will be used in the advertising and communications activities carried out abroad by different promotion groups. What should be done to use the Turkey brand and logo in an effective way? We are still working on the legislation related to this issue together with the Ministry of Economy. Some programs will be implemented to support and encourage the use of the logo. From now on we will work more to improve the perception of Turkey through this logo and its slogan rather than the promotion of the logo itself. We will make the use of the Turkey turkishconfectionery.org.tr DISCOVER THE POTENTIAL 07 06 01 05 02 08 03 logo and slogan a common practice in all economic, sportive and cultural activities of Turkey abroad. We will ensure that everyone who sees this slogan and logo in a foreign country understands that the content is about Turkey. Therefore, we will encourage all organizations that want to promote Turkey or its values abroad to use the logo and slogan. At the beginning, we were suffering from lack of harmony in the promotion of Turkey. Now, we aim to create harmony with the logo and slogan. All public institutions have also adopted this approach and continued to work on this issue. Are there any target countries or regions? We are preparing a study that targets the entire world for the perception of Turkey. Of course, some export markets have a priority for us. These markets are also among the target countries identified by the Ministry of Economics. The Ministry of Tourism also has different target countries. Do you have a special strategy or study for the Turkey brand in 2015? We are preparing a comprehensive brand strategy to improve the perception of Turkey. Besides the short-term action plans, we are creating our long-term strategies that will continue by 2023. Initially, we plan to introduce the logo and slogan domestically. We will ensure that our own citizens are acquainted with the brand. Secondly, we will encourage the Turks living abroad, namely the Turkish diaspora, to act effectively. In the final stage, we will tell our story to the world. We will not only tell our own story but also encourage the foreigners working with us to tell Turkey. We believe wholeheartedly that it will contribute to the improvement of the perception of Turkish goods. 04 BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF COMMUNICATION POWER GENERATED HERE, THE LOGO AIMS TO DEVELOP THE PERCEPTION OF TURKISH GOODS IN THE FUTURE AS IT WILL BE USED IN THE ADVERTISING AND COMMUNICATIONS ACTIVITIES CARRIED OUT ABROAD BY DIFFERENT PROMOTION GROUPS. 01 / GROWTH 03 / WORLD 05 / BOTH EASTERN AND WESTERN 07 / TOGETHERNESS 02 / SYNERGY 04 / MEETING 06 / INNOVATION 08 / HARMONY THE LOGO DESIGNED BY SAFFRON BRAND CONSULTANT IS INSPIRED BY CULTURAL PATTERNS USED BY THE TURKS IN RUGS, CARPETS, HANDICRAFTS, AND ARCHITECTURE THROUGHOUT HISTORY.

What have you done in terms of activity under the scope of UR-GE program? UR-GE is a program initiated by the Ministry of Economy within the framework of “the Communiqué No. 2010/8 on International Competitiveness Improvement”. The starting point of UR-GE project can be summarized as encouraging the development of export strategies through plans and programs to be made with a common vision of our firms under coordination of a cooperation agency. In 2014, the Cereals UR-GE Project Group consisting of the companies of sugar and sugar product manufacturers organized trade delegations simultaneously with the exhibitions held in Thailand, the Philippines and Moscow, 100 IN THE COMPETITION AMONG MORE THAN 100 GROUPS, WE ACHIEVED A GREAT SYNERGY BY LETTING FOOD ENGINEERS AND INDUSTRIAL/ PRODUCT DESIGNERS PARTICIPATE UNDER THE SAME CATEGORY. DISCOVER THE POTENTIAL respectively. Thanks to these delegations, the firms had the opportunity to promote their products in new markets and, accordingly, began to export to those countries that the delegations went. Currently, there are two new URGE project which continues under auspices of our Association. You broke new ground in the industry with Turkey’s 1st National Industrial Food Design Competition. What is the purpose of this competition? The first National Industrial Food Design Competition was organized in September 2014 under the sponsorship of Turkish Confectionery Promotion Group. In the competition among more than 100 groups, we achieved a great synergy by letting food engineers and industrial/ product designers participate under the same category. Providing competitive solutions in the export of industrial food products, improving the competitiveness of the industry, creating advantageous opportunities and solutions to the industrial problems, emphasizing the importance of design for the industry, acting as a platform in the emergence of designs with export potential and, most importantly, contributing to the university-industry cooperation by bringing together the food companies of Turkey and young, dynamic designer candidates interested in the industry are some of the main objectives of this competition. 15 Q&A HIDAYET KADIROĞLU: “WE ARE TAKING FIRM STEPS TOWARDS BECOMING A REGIONAL POWER” F ollowing their establishment in 2012 Turkish Confectionary Promotion Group has been working hard to achieve their 2023 target of 10 billion USD export volume. “With 80 percent local raw material production input our sector holds the key to resolving the issue of current deficit” says Hidayet Kadiroğlu, the president of the Turkish Confectionary Promotion Group. How do you position Turkey in the larger picture of world confectionary industry? What are Turkey’s popular products and advantages in the sector? We are in the process of positioning Turkey as a land of sweets and confectionery with a newly coined concept called “DelightLand”. Sugary products category enjoys a significant market appeal in Turkey. This position is getting even stronger thanks to diverse dessert and sweet varieties of traditional cuisines of Turkey, the country’s sugary products production capacity and the aptness and tendency of the business world towards this sector. In addition, the historical recognition, popularity and appreciation of “Turkish Delight” in the world constitutes the base of this market appeal. For that matter, by center-piecing Turkish Delight, the concept of “Delight” proposes a pretty strong argument for sugary products as it is regarded as an overarching concept that reminds of feelings like satisfaction, self indulgence, fun, sparing time 16 “ALMOST ALL OF OUR CITIES AND PROVINCES HAVE THEIR SPECIAL DESSERTS AND EVEN CONFITURES. SUCH DIVERSITY STEMS FROM OUR TRADITIONS AND IT IS REFLECTED IN OUR MODERN PRODUCT PORTFOLIO.” for oneself and relaxation to the consumer. This is a concept intrinsic to the very wording of “Turkish Delight”. To cut a long story short we regard “Delight” as an all encompassing expression for sugary products. With DelightLand concept we want to establish a perception of Turkey as the first place that comes to mind when talking about confectionary in a way that is similar to the relationship between cigars and Cuba. Within this framework product diversity and abundance of flavors are the two most important advantages of Turkey. Almost all of our cities and provinces have their special desserts and even confitures. Such diversity stems from our traditions and it is reflected in our modern product portfolio. Today our industry is active in almost every aspect of confectionary production and markets all over the world. Therefore the market positioning we describe as turkishconfectionery.org.tr 2,7 Q&A “OUR EXPORTS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE PROMOTION GROUP REACHED NEARLY 2.5 BILLION USD IN 2013. WE HAVE MANAGED TO RAISE THIS FIGURE TO 2.7 BILLION BY THE END OF 2014. WE ARE EXPECTING TO GROW 20 PERCENT EVERY YEAR IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE OUR 2023 TARGET OF 10 BILLION USD.” ‘DelightLand’ not only has its roots in the past but also corresponds to today’s reality. While preserving our rich heritage of product diversity, in the forthcoming period we can also focus on alternative products. In recent years we have seen an upwards trend in bakery products while confectionary has already been on the rise. We set an ambitious target for the coming years therefore almost all product categories will have to grow. How was 2014 in terms of sugary products industry? Can you evaluate your 2015 targets? In 2014, the exports of Turkish sugary products sector went to nearly 200 countries most of them being either our neighbors or nearby countries. Thanks to the solid investments we made in the past few years our sector continues to take firm steps towards becoming a regional power. Despite the instabilities and conflicts in the south and the north, our sector has been able to achieve a growth rate that is three times the overall growth “WITH DELIGHTLAND CONCEPT WE WANT TO ESTABLISH A PERCEPTION OF TURKEY AS THE FIRST PLACE THAT COMES TO MIND WHEN TALKING ABOUT CONFECTIONARY.” rate of Turkish economy. Our exports within the framework of the Promotion Group reached nearly 2.5 billion USD in 2013. We have managed to raise this figure to 2.7 billion by the end of 2014. We are expecting to grow 20 percent every year in order to achieve our 2023 target of 10 billion USD. For that matter we will grow by at least 20 percent in 2015. Let me remind you that this rate is the minimum we expect… Depending on the performance of the sector, an even higher growth rate won’t be a surprise for us; we do expect this. Which potential markets do you target? Our priority targets, which are also the main export targets of Turkey in general, are neighboring and nearby coun- 17 Q&A IN ADDITION TO PARTICIPATING IN THE WORLD’S LARGEST TRADE FAIRS LIKE ISM, SIAL AND GULFOOD, WE HAVE RECENTLY EXPANDED TO RELATIVELY NEW MARKETS SUCH AS SOUTH AMERICA. tries. While working on strengthening and establishing our position in these markets we are also pursuing new ones. United States of America, South American countries, Far East and Africa are among our potential priority targets. We have been working on projects pertaining to these markets in recent years. To your opinion, in the coming period which product categories has the potential to grow and to be exported the most? “THE MARKET POSITIONING WE DESCRIBE AS ‘DELIGHTLAND’ NOT ONLY HAS ITS ROOTS IN THE PAST BUT ALSO CORRESPONDS TO TODAY’S REALITY.” Asian countries where the population is relatively young we expect a steady increase in demand. The rising trend will continue in the newly emerging African market. Jelly products will continue to be popular in the Americas and especially in the United States. Can you tell us about the activities of Turkish Confectionary Promotion Group and how it was established? Turkish Confectionary Promotion Cakes, jelly beans, sweet biscuits and chocolates stand out. Different continents and countries will have different demands. Countries with older populations will naturally show little interest in sugary products whereas in 18 turkishconfectionery.org.tr SKY Ocak Reklam yeni olcu.ai Group was established in 2012 with the participation of six Exporter Associations in the sector. Our aim is to introduce Turkish confectionery, chocolate and biscuits industry to world markets in the most effective way and support branding. After completing our infrastructure setup in a very short time we have organized various activities such as international trade fair participations and promotional activities, all designed to achieve our 2023 target of 10 billion USD export volume. In addition to participating in the world’s largest trade fairs like ISM, SIAL and GULFOOD, we have recently expanded to relatively new markets such as South America. We have worked on strengthening the image of “Turkish confectionary” in almost every continent. We will continue our efforts while at the same time updating and improving our methods. However we want to restructure all our activities within the framework of a strategic vision and mission statement. Our first step towards this was the workshop on December 20, 2014 which brought together branding and marketing experts and sector representatives. We are in the process of preparing a strategy document on world-wide promotion efforts based on the outcome of this one-day workshop. We are also planning to share the outcomes with our stakeholders. Our target is very clear: By underlining Turkey as the best source of sugary products Turkish Confectionary Promotion Group aims to raise awareness of Turkish sugary products in strategic markets and ensure their preference especially by activating B2B channels. 1 7.Oca.2015 15:12 Q&A C M Y CM MY CY CMY K Turkey aims to become one of the 10 largest economies in the world by 2023. Can you describe the role Turkish sugary products sector will play in achieving this target? As the confectionary sector we rank 16th in the league of confectionary exporting countries. When we achieve our target of 10 billion USD export volume, Turkey’s ranking in this particular league will consequently improve and we will be among the top 10. This will naturally carry Turkish economy to be- 2,7 WITH A CURRENT EXPORT VOLUME OF 2.7 BILLION USD OUR CONFECTIONARY PRODUCTS ARE ENJOYED BY BILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND THEY APPEAL TO THE PREFERENCES OF THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD. ing one of the 10 largest economies in the world. If every industry does its best to achieve a top 10 position in their own leagues, Turkey will automatically become one of the 10 largest economies. For this reason it may be a good idea to launch a motivation campaign and encourage every sector to push the top 10 barrier by using this as a motivational index. On the other hand, confectionary sector creates value added for all other exporting industries. With a current export volume of 2.7 billion USD our confectionary products and especially Turkish Delight varieties are enjoyed by billions of people and they appeal to the preferences of the people of the world. Therefore the increase in our exports indirectly contributes Turkey’s image and has a positive impact on other sectors too. Finally, with 80 percent local raw material production input our sector holds the key to resolving the issue of current deficit. 19 AGENDA THE SWEETEST CONTEST FOOD ENGINEERS AND INDUSTRIAL DESIGNERS MET UP AT THE CONTEST HELD BY ISTANBUL EXPORTERS’ ASSOCIATIONS.

Visitors were informed about the activities of TCPG and the sector in general. turkishconfectionery.org.tr AGENDA SUGAR BEET AS SOURCE OF SUGAR IN TURKEY Turkey ranks high on the list of sugar beet production in the world. SUGAR BEET IS THE RAW MATERIAL OF THE DELICIOUS DESSERTS SPREADING TO THE WORLD FROM TURKEY, AND IT IS GROWN IN KONYA AND THE SURROUNDING AREA WHERE THE FERTILE PLAINS ARE LOCATED. For centuries, people squeezed the juice from different fruits containing high sugar such as dates, grapes, apples, and pears with the intention of using it as sugar. They sometimes met their sugar needs by boiling the juice they got from these fruits to make thick syrup. This usage became a tradition all over the world by the time they found refined sugar. Although many plants contain sugar or sucrose, there are only two plants containing the required amount of sugar that can be obtained economically: Sugar cane and sugar beet. Sugar, which is one of the mankind’s most important foods for centuries, was produced only from sugar canes until the end of the 18th century. Sugar beet agriculture and sugar production from sugar beets began in the 19th century. Today, cane accounts for 74% of sugar produced; 26% is made from sugar beets. The main reason behind low production rates of sugar beets despite its high sugar content in the roots is that sugar made from sugar beets is more expensive compared to the production from canes. Nevertheless, sugar production from sugar beets has continued in many countries due to economic contribution it provides to the sugar industry as well as other agricultural and social reasons by taking various measures. Importantly, Turkey is one of those countries. Turkey ranks high on the list of sugar beet production in the world. Indeed, this is the secret behind the taste of the world-famous deserts of Turkey where sugar beet is always used as the main ingredient for sugar. Importance of the Use of Sugar Beets In recent years, there is another source of sugar that people have begun to use increasingly: starch-based sugar. It is made from the chemical treatment of the raw materials containing starch, such as corn, wheat, and potato. There are huge discussions on its harmful effects to human health, but the evidence is not yet concrete due to lack of factual findings and research data on that damage. Starch-based sugar that cannot be consumed directly is produced mostly to be used in the sugary product industry. Medical authorities also cannot come to a common conclusion on the fattening effects of products containing starch-based sugar. 25 AGENDA “SAFRANBOLU DELIGHT” IS REGISTERED Certification of geographical indication registration was received for the delight produced in Karabük’s Safranbolu district which is on the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage List. International Trademark and Patent Consultant Huriye Özener said that they had recently received the registration certificate for Safranbolu delight. Stating that they received the geographical indication for the delight with the application to Turkish Patent Institute (TPE), Özener further said: “Safranbolu delight is a product with historical and cultural values. Previously, applications for Gaziantep baklava, Aydın fig, Afyon sausage and Malatya apricot were made to the European Commission. Of these, application for Gaziantep baklava was completed and other applications are currently under review. Necessary works are being performed related to the applications to European Commission. With this certificate, in order to prevent the imitations of Safranbolu delight and to add value to branding procedure, necessary inspections will be carried out in the shortest time.” Emphasizing that the TCPG LANDING IN MIDDLE EAST To sustain its progress of the leadership position in the confectionary export field in Middle East region, TCPG participated in Sweets & Snacks Middle East Fair held in United Arab Emirates, Dubai between 9 and 11 November 2014. 15 thousand pro- TCPG COLORS IN SEOUL Turkish Confectionary Promotion Group was in Seoul, the capital of South Korea, under the scope of its operations being performed to set Turkish confectionary market even closer to South Korean market. Food Week Korea Fair that was held between 12 and 15 November 2014, hosted more than 100 thousand visitors including 141 participating companies from 30 different countries and around one thousand local companies. Turkish Confectionery Promotion Group booth attracted great interest at the fair, and visited by Republic of Turkey Commercial Counsellor several times, who also showed close interest to South Korean visitors. Visitors were provided with detailed information on the Turkish confectionary industry and were handed out catalogues during the fair. Traditional sweets such as delight and baklava were also served to the visitors. 26 fessionals from 90 countries visited the fair that hosted 620 companies from confectionary and pastry industry. In addition to the participation by Turkey with 20 companies under the national participation organization, Northern African countries as well as registration process took longer time due to the detailed study and research, Özener mentioned that Safranbolu delight does not cause burn feeling in the throat thanks to its consistency and appearance, and it also differs from its rivals with its taste and flavor as well as not sticking to teeth and palate. countries such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, India showed great interest to the fair. Demand to dragée and hard candies was at remarkable levels in addition to the interest shown to traditional Turkish sweets such as delight and baklava. RUSSIAN MARKET WAITS FOR TURKISH CONFECTIONERY One of the most important trade fairs of Food and Beverages industry at the region, the 23rd World Food Moscow (WFM) 2014 was organized in Moscow between September 15 and 18, 2014.

Very appealing to Russian taste, this product has been an instant success at the fair while promoting Turkish delicacies in Russia became one of our primary sector targets. turkishconfectionery.org.tr AGENDA YILDIZ HOLDING TOOK OVER BRITISH BISCUIT FIRM UNITED BISCUIT Yıldız Holding took over United Biscuits, one of the biggest biscuit companies of United Kingdom. It is reported that British company which is the owner of McVitie’s, Jaffa Cakes and Penguin brands, was sold for 2 billion pounds (near 3 billion dollars). Yıldız Holding took over United Biscuits, the sixth biggest biscuit producer of the world. After this transaction, it became the third biggest biscuit company of the world. According to the written statement by Yıldız Holding, having incorporated Godiva - one of the important chocolate brands of the world - and DeMet’s - a long-established confectionary company of the USA - into its body, Yıldız Holding took its biggest step towards globalization with United Biscuits. Although the takeover cost was not announced, it is reported that the value of the agreement is about 2 billion pounds. This amount means the biggest takeover by a Turkish company on international scale. HSBC and Ünlü&Co companies mediated Yıldız Holding during the takeover process of United Biscuits which was owned by Blackstone and PAI private equity funds. Deloitte provided financial advisory service, and Linklaters and YükselKarkınKüçük companies provided legal counselling services for Yıldız Holding during this process. Yıldız Holding is planning to implement its independent management model at United Biscuits, which is also Murat Ülker Chairman of the Executive Board implemented in Godiva and has given successful results. Growth in new markets Yıldız Holding will get the opportunity to increase its market share in European countries such as France, Belgium and Netherlands as well as African countries and India, in addition to United Kingdom market where United Biscuits holds the leadership flag. On the other hand, United Biscuits will get the chance to grow in Turkish, Middle Eastern, Northern America, China, Japan and other countries where Yıldız Holding is active. Both companies will also combine their R&D and new product development experience as well as know-how, thereby strengthening their competition advantage. Starting out with Ülker Pötibör in 1944 just four years before United Biscuits, in its 70th year Yıldız Holding became the third biggest biscuit producer of the world with this takeover. Speaking about the takeover, Yıldız Holding Chairman of the Executive Board Murat Ülker said: “Behind this journey that started with producing only 200 kilograms biscuit per year at the workplace in Nohutçu Han, lies the philosophy of my father and uncle: “What underlies the success is working relentlessly, being honest and making highquality production.” This philosophy not only made us the brand of Turkey in 70 years, but it also enabled us to globalize”. Stating that Yıldız Holding is always focused on what it does best, and that they UB rise in the new markets influenced takeover Being 3 times bigger than its closest competitor with a market share over 26 percent in United Kingdom market, United Biscuits have made a significant move in exports and entry into new markets during the recent years. The company that was making only 5 percent of its sales from the markets outside the United Kingdom and Northern Europe five years ago, succeeded to gain 15 percent of its sales revenue from new markets at the end of 2013. Saudi Arabia, India, Nigeria and Australia are among the biggest markets of the company outside the United Kingdom and Northern Europe. Among the foreign markets, Africa, Middle East and China stand out as the regions with the highest growth potential. do not deviate from this strategy in their growth policies, Mr. Ülker further said: “Our main area of activity is food. All of our investments were made in line with being a leader in this field. Godiva and DeMet’s has been the two important investments that we made with the same strategy. United Biscuits was also a good opportunity at this point. So, we wanted to utilize this opportunity. I think that a takeover at that size is not only a gain for Yıldız Holding, but also for our country. Likewise, I believe United Biscuits will also benefit from this shareholder change. Because, Yıldız Holding is at a stronger position in markets where the company is less strong, and we also have the industrial know-how advantage in some products.” 27 CLASSIC ER OF MAST 28 turkishconfectionery.org.tr CLASSIC A DELICACY FIT FOR A SULTAN Turkish TRADITIONAL TURKISH DELIGHT HAS BEEN A FEAST FOR THE PALATE FOR CENTURIES. Delight S ometimes a token of love in a stylish box held between shaky and excited hands when asking for a girl’s hand in marriage and sometimes the reason of the innocent smile of a child who was given Turkish Delight in an embroidered handkerchief on an Eid day… The essential treat of friendly conversations and the perfect partner of coffee, Turkish Delight has been a feast for the palate for three centuries. If you go out and ask anyone on the street what was the most delicious treat made of water, sugar and starch, the answer you will get will be “Turkish Delight” most of the time. Enriched with fruit flavors, spices or nuts, Turkish Delight is one of the oldest sweets in the world. The Turkish word for it is “Lokum”, which was derived from the Arabic expression “rahat-ul hulkum” meaning “relieving the sore throat”. There are many stories about its origins. Literature tells us that the history of Turkish Delight dates back to the Sasanian Empire, one of the most important civilizations in history, which ruled over Persia. Rumor has it that the predecessor of Turkish Delight was an authentic Sasanian treat called “abhisa”. This delicious treat was later called “rahat-ul hulkum” which transformed into “lati lokum” and “rahat lokum” and finally ended up simply as “lokum”. Nevertheless according to many written sources there are enough evidence 29 CLASSIC that Turkish Delight has been produced and consumed in Anatolia since 15th century. According to another story, in 17th century, Ottoman Sultan Abdulhamid I had organized a competition among confectioners to come up with a softer sweet than hard candy. The winning contestant was Ali Muhiddin Hacı Bekir who prepared bite sized soft sweets by mixing water, sugar, corn flour, lemon cream, tartar and rose water, and coated them with icing sugar. He was appointed as the chief confectioner of the palace as the creator of a confiture that eventually enjoyed a unique place in our culinary culture and even left its mark on the traditions of the society. The first people to taste this delicious treat which will have identified with Ottomans and later with Turks, were the members of the Sultan’s court and the privileged. However its reputation has eventually surged beyond the palace walls and spread among the commoners. Although this type of confiture has been known since the 15th century, it took nearly 200 years for larger crowds within the territories of the Ottoman Empire to appreciate its taste. Thanks to its unique taste Turkish Delight continues to be a sensation even in the 21st century. The first mass production of Turkish delight dates back to 1777. For this first batch they used honey, molasses and flour. TURKISH DELIGHT HAS ALSO INSPIRED A NUMBER OF PERFUME BRANDS WHICH CAME UP WITH FRAGRANCES THEY CLAIM TO RESEMBLE TURKISH DELIGHT AND USED IT IN THEIR NAMES. 30 Turkish Delight’s journey to Europe At the beginning this delicious treat was known to and enjoyed by the people of Anatolia only. How it was first introduced to Europe is in fact a very interesting story. A British traveler who was curious about Ottomans and set off to explore the empire realized that people often ate a special kind of sweet after meals and especially after coffee. Curious about its taste, the traveler tried some and fell in love with it. So he brought some back home and introduced it as “Turkish Delight”. This is how the European adventure of Turkish Delight began in 18th century. Earlier varieties of Turkish Delight were made of honey, molasses and flour turkishconfectionery.org.tr CLASSIC however after the Ottomans began using refined sugar and starch in 17th century, not only the ingredients but also the taste of Turkish Delight has changed. Thanks to many unsung confectioners throughout history who wanted to make a difference, today we can enjoy dozens of Turkish Delight varieties including plain, rose, hazelnut, pistachio, walnut, almond, coconut, orange, rose petal, strawberry, lemon, cream, mint, vanilla, saffron and ginger flavors. Along with long established historical confectioners like Hacı Bekir, Hafız Mustafa and Cemilzade hundreds of confectioners make dozens of Turkish Delight varieties in diverse colors and flavors across Turkey and especially in touristic centers like İstanbul, Ankara, İzmir, Afyon, Safranbolu, Konya, Bursa, Balıkesir, Antalya, Denizli and Samsun. How to tell a good quality Turkish Delight? • Good quality Turkish Delight has to retain its initial form. In other words it should not look different from familiar, traditional varieties. • It should retain flexibility • There should be no cracks on the surface • It should look translucent when divided in half • The surface should bounce back when you poke it with your finger • It should feel soft and slippery in the mouth • The icing sugar coating should be dry; in other words a good quality Turkish Delight “should not ingest the icing sugar” as professionals would say. How to keep Turkish Delight fresh Store them away from direct sunlight, humidity or heat. It is recommended not to keep them in a warm place but they should not be stored in the refrigerator also. Room temperature is ideal. Also make sure to keep them away from anything odorous. Turkish Delight hardens in cold temperatures however if you place them in room temperature again it regains its elasticity in no time. 1777 THE FIRST MASS PRODUCTION OF TURKISH DELIGHT DATES BACK TO 1777. FOR THIS FIRST BATCH THEY USED HONEY, MOLASSES AND FLOUR. A ritual classic… It was only natural for a society that came up with the idiom “let’s eat sweet and talk sweet” at one point in time, to incorporate such a unique delicacy in their daily lives and even in their traditions. Having been a palace specialty and appealed to the enjoyment of sultans for centuries, Turkish Delight eventually took its place in our daily rituals sometimes as a companion and sometimes as the headliner. It has been served in special silver or copper containers called “lokumluk” at affiance ceremonies or as a treat to complement a cup of coffee, the essential ingredient of friendly conversations. It has been the reason behind the innocent smile on a child’s face when given a handful of Turkish Delight in an embroidered handkerchief after going from door to door and asking for treats and money on an Eid morning. It has even assumed roles that normally cannot be expected from any sweet treat. For instance during circumcision ceremonies, frightened boys are traditionally given Turkish Delight as a fake anesthetic to distract them. And it has been celebrated in many folk songs including the “Katibim” (My Beloved Clerk): “I found a handkerchief on my way to 31 CLASSIC Üsküdar (Scutari) / I filled the handkerchief with Turkish Delight/ I was looking for my beloved clerk when I found him right beside me…” Turkish Delight for sore throats In the past Turkish Delight was used as a remedy for sore throat, kidney diseases, wounds and boils. Today this practice still continues in some parts of Anatolia. Football’s Turkish Delight: Arda Turan On the course of its long adventure from 17th century to date Turkish Delight has become so popular that people began describing things that they find perfect or likeable with the idiom “just like Turkish Delight”. Having been a popular theme in various art forms, Turkish Delight also found access to the world of sports with a recent UEFA video entitled “Goals in 60 Seconds: Turkish Delight” which features the impressive goals of well known Turkish players like Arda Turan in European cups.

However it was a movie called “The Chronicles of Narnia” that really boosted Turkish Delight sales and popularity in Europe in the recent past. In “The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe” the witch frequently offered Turkish Delight to Edmund in order to win him over. The movie has been such a success that one of Britain’s largest supermarket chains Tesco & Saisbury had witnessed an abrupt 200 percent increase in Turkish Delight sales. This was how Turkish Delight made the headlines in The Independent. In fact the partnership of art and Turkish Delight in Britain has a long history. It was first mentioned in Charles Dickens’ “The Mystery of Edwin Drood” and later found a place for itself many times in British literature. One of the favorite treats of world leaders such as Napoleon and Winston Churchill, Turkish Delight had also been Picasso’s personal remedy to boost concentration. THE PERFECT PARTNER OF TURKISH COFFEE, COLORFUL TURKISH DELIGHT VARIETIES BEGAN THEIR MOUTH WATERING JOURNEY AS A PALACE SPECIALTY.

Same taste, different names The same Turkish Delight which was brought to Europe by a British traveler in 18th century has assumed diverse names around the world over time. It is called “alqum” in Arabic speaking coun- tries such as Libya, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia, “rahat lokum” in Bosnia, “loukoumi” in Greece, “Cyprus delight” in Cyprus, “rahat” in Romania, “Turkish Delight” or “lokum” in the US and North America, and “Manjar Turco”. “Delícia Turca”. HACIBEKIR CONFECTIONARY PARTICIPATED IN VIENNA WORLD FAIR FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1873 AND WAS AWARDED WITH A SILVER MEDAL. HAVING REALIZED HOW WESTERN COUNTRIES MAKE USE OF BRAND NAMES AT THE FAIR, HACIBEKIR LATER BECAME THE FIRST OTTOMAN BRAND. 33 MASTERS OF DELIGHTLAND THE PLACE WHERE THE HISTORY OF TURKISH DELIGHT BEGAN KNOWN AS THE “LIVING MUSEUM” TODAY, HACIBEKIR’S BAHÇEKAPI STORE WELCOMES EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO BREATHE IN THE HISTORICAL FRAGRANCE OF TURKISH DELIGHT AND WITNESS THE UNIQUE AND ADVENTUROUS FLAVORS PRODUCED BY A CENTURIES OLD ARTISAN TRADITION. T he place where Turkish Delight began its journey around the world, the place known as the “living museum” today is Hacıbekir Confectionary’s Bahçekapı Store with a history dating back to 1777. Established by confectioner Hacı Bekir Efendi 238 years ago at 34 the vicinity of the main arteries of trade such as Sultanhamam, Egyptian Market, Fish Market and Tahtakale as well as the Bab-ı Ali, the center of Ottoman bureaucracy , the museum-shop today welcomes Turkish Delight aficionados coming from all over the world. Having successfully created a unique delicacy and a world heritage in a tiny shop Hacıbekir Confectionary transforms artisanship into an art form. Hacıbekir Confectionary Factory Manager Ali Sayver and Chef Seyfi Yılmaz who prepares Turkish Delight varieties for more than 50 years tell us everything about the long journey of Turkish Delight. turkishconfectionery.org.tr MASTERS OF DELIGHTLAND Can you tell us about Turkish Delight and the “Living Museum”? Ali Sayver: This is the place where Turkish Delight, a legendary delicacy recognized in five continents was created. Bekir Efendi came from Kastamonu’s Araç district to İstanbul in 1777 and began making candies and Turkish Delight varieties in this very shop. In those early days Turkish Delight used to be made with honey, molasses, water as binder and flour for texture. After the discovery starch by German scientist Kirchhoff in 1811 flour was replaced with starch and with the coming of European refined sugar cone to the Ottoman Empire, honey and molasses were replaced with sugar grounded in mortars. This was how Turkish Delight, an essential part of confectionary culture which still cannot be imitated came into being. Over the course of time Turkish Delight production has been diversified by adding various flavors like lemon, gum mastic or orange. In addition to being the place where everything began, the “Living Museum” stands out as the birthplace of the trademark Hacıbekir which is among the 100 oldest brands in the world. Our journey began in 1777 and continues for 238 years without interruption. And we have every intention to carry on the same way. A lot of companies in the world produce Turkish Delight varieties. However this specific shop is known as the “Living Museum of Turkish Delight”. Can you tell us why? Ali Sayver: We do what we know the best and refrain from sailing to unchartered territories. I believe this is the main reason behind our success. 238 years… It is easier said than done. This is an extremely rare occasion in the whole world never mind Turkey. We will continue to produce Turkish Delight with the same understanding; we want to be known as the living museum of Turkish Delight with the same principles and understanding, without compromising quality for many years to come. 238 “OUR JOURNEY BEGAN IN 1777 AND CONTINUES FOR 238 YEARS WITHOUT INTERRUPTION. WE HAVE EVERY INTENTION TO CARRY ON THE SAME WAY.” How many Turkish Delight varieties are sold in this shop and which ones are the most popular? Ali Sayver: At the moment we offer 38 different Turkish Delight varieties and more than 15 hard candy flavors to the enjoyment of our customers coming from all over the world including Asia, Europe, America and Australia. In addition to plain, rose, gum mastic, hazelnut, pistachio, walnut, almond, coconut and cream varieties we also offer fruit (cherry, strawberry, orange, apricot, lemon) spice (cinnamon, ginger, cloves) and combined (lemon and rose, lemon and mint, lemon and ginger) flavors. Recent additions to our product range include coffee, mint, date, blueberry, Antep pistachio and pomegranate flavors. We also produce chocolate coated varieties. However the all time favorite has always been the double baked pistachio. On the other hand we are constantly working on how to improve ourselves and widen our product range. Our annual Turkish Delight and candy production amounts up to 400 - 500 tons. Of course this figure varies depending on the season and special occasions. Especially in tourist season our shop is flocked by tourists since Turkish Delight is the number one souvenir to buy from Turkey. Where do your ingredients come from? Ali Sayver: We buy all our ingredients from suppliers in the domestic market. ISO standards requires us to work with suppliers of a certain quality. Therefore we are constantly searching for best alternatives. For example Antep pistachios come from their namesake city Gaziantep because, thanks to the region’s warm climate and fertile soil, the best Antep pistachios with thin skin and rich oil content are grown there. For rose flavored varieties we prefer the rose petals coming from Isparta, a city that meets two thirds of the world’s total annual rose oil demand and considered the motherland of roses. As for sugar, we prefer to work with sugar producers in Konya, a region where the world’s best quality sugar beets grow thanks to its fair climate. Our walnuts come from Central Anatolia since the ecology, climate and terrain in this region is ideal for growing thin shelled walnuts that come 35 MASTERS OF DELIGHTLAND out of the shell in one piece. As for almonds we prefer Southeastern Anatolia region. Which cities are more competitive in terms of Turkish Delight production? Ali Sayver: Istanbul ranks first in terms of the total amount produced and also there are more production facilities than any other city. Safranbolu, Afyon, Konya, İzmir and Bursa also stand out. Why do you think Bahçekapı was preferred as the location of a Turkish Delight shop in the firstplace? Ali Sayver: The most important reason why Hacı Bekir preferred to open his shop in Bahçekapı was its proximity to Bab-ı Ali or the office of the grand vizier (prime minister). Moreover in those days the Grand Bazaar was the heart and soul of the trade between Istanbul and the rest of Anatolia. The fact that Eminönü and Karaköy trade ports were also located nearby and thus it was easier to buy raw materials, had also been decisive. Furthermore, since this area was densely populated 36 “WE ARE THE BEST COMPANION OF PEOPLE IN THEIR HAPPIEST DAYS. THINK ABOUT IT; TURKISH DELIGHT IS THE STAR OF AFFIANCE CEREMONIES, IT IS ALSO THE STAR OF CIRCUMCISION CEREMONIES, WE OFFER TURKISH DELIGHT TO OUR LOVED ONES AT EID VISITS AND IT IS SERVED TOGETHER WITH A CUP OF COFFEE DURING DEEP CONVERSATIONS.” due to all of the above reasons, buyer turnover was very high. This location is also one of the reasons why Turkish Delight could spread across the world since this was and still is an area where people of every race, nationality and faith come for either business or leisure purposes. Those who come here have the chance to taste this delicacy and bring some back home for their loved ones to enjoy. And this contributes in the worldwide popularity of Turkish Delight. This was the case back then and it still is today. Mr. Seyfi, this is your 61st year as a Turkish Delight chef. As a living monument of Turkish Delight history, can you tell us how did you take on this profession and what does it mean for you? Seyfi Yılmaz: I came from Kastamonu to İstanbul in 1944 and began working at Hacıbekir in 1951. I learned how to make Turkish Delight here and I have never thought of taking on another profession. Because we are the best companion of people in their happiest days. Think about it; Turkish Delight is turkishconfectionery.org.tr MASTERS OF DELIGHTLAND little starch as binder. In addition we can use fruit aromas, spices, or hazelnuts, walnuts, almonds, cream and so on for flavor. When I first began this profession technology was not as advanced as today so there were no machines to help us in the preparation process. We needed manpower. We used to mix all the ingredients in large caldrons and stir for long hours over medium heat. This alone was very time and energy consuming. The more the ingredients the longer we had to cook. Since nuts and other additions need more time to cook we had to stir and stir for even longer hours. However mixtures with fruit aromas took a relatively shorter time. Whereas today we use machines to shorten the process. Other than that the taste and texture is exactly the same. The only difference is the use of machines in cooking. the star of affiance ceremonies, it is also the star of circumcision ceremonies, we offer Turkish Delight to our loved ones at Eid visits and it is served together with a cup of coffee during deep conversations. Also Turkish Delight is the first thing tourists think of buying from our country to take home as a gift for their loved ones. In other words Turkish Delight is the favorite treat of our happiest moments. And I am very glad that I’m producing something that witnesses people’s happiness. Who knows in which country, in whose house the Turkish Delight me and my friends make ends up, adding zest to their lives. This alone is a very nice feeling. I am sure such professions can be rarely found around the world and I feel very lucky to be able to produce something that is enjoyed by people and witness their happy days. Can you tell us about the preparation of Turkish Delight? Are there any differences between how it was produced in the past and today? Seyfi Yılmaz: The basic ingredients of Turkish Delight are sugar, water and a Although there are many Turkish Delight producers in the market today, this is the place people call the museum of Turkish Delight. Why? Seyfi Yılmaz: We use the authentic recipe; in other words our basic ingredients never change. And we have never used cheap ingredients. Because we know that you need to use only good quality ingredients to make good quality Turkish Delight. We buy our ingredients from the best local suppliers. Since we are the oldest Turkish Delight producer and our products are high quality people call us the living museum. For us producing bad quality Turkish Delight is an insult to who we are. What are the essentials of a good quality Turkish Delight? Seyfi Yılmaz: The ingredients have a direct impact on the quality of the end product. Sugar and starch should be best quality, they should be cooked at the right temperature for just the right amount of time. Moreover additions like hazelnuts, pistachios, walnuts and almonds should also be of best quality and most important of all the amount of such additional ingredients have a direct effect on whether the end product will be perfect or not. WITNESSING HISTORY… When it was first established, the Living Museum was a tiny candy shop with a single stove at the back. With additions and extensions over time it transformed into the shop you see today which has been the sanctuary of Turkish Delight for 3 centuries. The shop was renovated in 1989 by certified engineer Doğan Şahin who remained faithful to its authentic characteristics. Today the shop is registered and taken under protection by the Cultural and Natural Heritage Protection Board as the country’s oldest confectionary shop. The marble columns at the two sides of the entrance and two bronze collars on each column, and the ironwork “marquise” canopy which stretches out over the shop window were conserved in their original condition. At the rear of the shop, the original stove area and surround used by Haci Bekir was carefully restored, as was the roof chimney pot. In their work on the counter area, shelving and the flower-decorated grille work on the ceiling the restorers remained faithful to the view of the shop in Prezioso’s painting ‘The Confectioner’ and have left us with a three-dimensional representation of this painting. 37 MAP OF DELIGHTLAND Sinop Prenses tatlısı İstanbul Akide Şekeri Kocaeli Pişmaniye Bursa Kestane Şekeri Manisa Mesir Macunu Konya Sugar Beet İzmir Lokma Safranbolu Lokum Aydın Kabak Tatlısı Burdur Ceviz Ezmesi Uşak Kırmızı Helva Isparta Güllü Lokum Eskişehir Met Helvası THE SECRET TREASURE OF TURKISH CONFECTIONERY IS HIDDEN UNDER ITS SOIL!

Or that the cacao was used as a currency in Mayan and Aztec cultures? There are very few nutrients as rich and as interesting as cacao and chocolate. Just like coffee, we inherited the cacao bean from civilizations that were found in Latin America before Christopher Columbus. When Spanish sailor Hernán Cortés exported cacao to Europe for the first time and learnt how to make chocolate drinks, it aroused great interest: divine for some, against religion for others. Invention of the cacao press by Dutch Coenraad Van Houten in 1828 both encouraged the manufacturers in food industry for the prepara- tion of “modern” and solid chocolate, and provided them the necessary equipment. Despite ongoing debates among historians on the first producer of the solid chocolate, English Fry family claims that they marketed the first chocolate bar. Although only elites had consumed chocolate in Europe for many years after the introduction of chocolate into Europe, with the Industrial Revolution chocolate transformed into sensational products all over the world. Cacao and chocolate still continues to give mystery, luxury and pleasure. In fact chocolate plays its role as an essential substance and the superhero of the happiness in special days. Waiting to make someone happy in fancy boxes wrapped with colorful ribbons, this ravishing flavor enshrined itself in everyone’s heart. 1200 – 1500 Cacao is an important part of the Aztec culture used for religious and tranding purposes. 1502 Columbs is the first Explorer to come in contact with cacao in Nicaragua. 250-900 BC Mayan people establish cacao plantations. 1528 Cortes establishes a New World cacao plantation for trading purposes.

Imported from abroad in tablet forms, chocolate became one of the favorite drinks at the palace and around it. Tasted by only very limited groups for longer years just as in Europe, this taste came to be known after being served as hot chocolate at the luxurious hotels and cafés in Pera. 1909 was a historic year for Turkish people, because Nestlé chocolates opened 1534 Jacques Carier lands an Gaspe Bay in Quebbee and claims it for France. 1753 Cocoa is given its official botanical name by Swedish scientist Carl Von Linne. “Theobroma Cacao”. 1732 Table mill for grinding chocolate more affordable and production easier. 1828 Dutchman Coenradd van Houten invents the first chocolate press to extract cocoa butter from chocolate and develops cocoa powder.

It was put up for sale in Turkey. Then, in 1927 the manufacturing section moved into Turkey, and the first chocolate plant of the country was established in Istanbul Feriköy. Starting with 500 kilograms daily production capacity, the plant made Turkish people meet and love the chocolate. After Turkish people met the foreign chocolate, small workshops started to be established in our country. They left their places to plants after 1950. Chocolate became widespread during the Second World War, and turned into an industry branch in the 1980’s; Turkey is now competing with the world in chocolate field. Turkish hazelnut: The best companion of the chocolate Hazelnut, which is known for about five thousand years, provides great benefit to the humanity with its fruit, wood and many more.

Our country is the biggest hazelnut pro- ducer with 75 percent share of the world hazelnut production. It also continues to take the lead in export rates. Turkish hazelnut which is well-known all over the world, is used in delicious products by leading chocolate producers of the world for many years. Large portion of the exported hazelnut - 91 percent - is purchased by European countries and 80 percent of it is used in confectionary and chocolate industry.
