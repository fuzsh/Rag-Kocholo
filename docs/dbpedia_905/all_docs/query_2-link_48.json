        "text": "I have been a correspondent for 18 years. I worked for Turkey's Zaman Daily in Turkey for 15 years, then best selling newspaper in Turkey. I was a political correspondent in Ankara following the prime minister and the government party AKP (Justice and Development Party). The political power AKP, took over and seized Zaman newspaper on 2016, March 4th. Just like other dozens of critical media outlets. But I had to leave my country before that, exactly in November 2015. Because of political pressure and threat against me. I live in Stockholm, as an exile now.\n\nI was born in 1978 in Turkey's Antakya (Antioch). I graduated from Istanbul University, Department of Public Administration in 1999. A few months later, I started to work as a journalist in Zaman Daily Istanbul News Center. I was a correspondent for the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality between 2001-2003. In 2004, I was assigned as a reporter for the Istanbul organisation of AKP and the Istanbul Office of the Prime Minister. As of this date, I have worked on special news files in municipalities, corruption, smuggling, customs and some other areas as well as politics. I switched to editorial department in 2009. I returned to correspondence at the end of 2011 and started working as a policy reporter in capital Ankara. I followed Prime Minister and Headquarters of AKP.\n\nAt the end of 2014, I published my first book titled ‘Yüzde On (Ten Percent- From Fair Order to Monetary Pool Order)’. In 2015, I published my second book '17 December-Zero Point', which I signed with my journalist friend Ufuk Köroğlu. My journalism life which I have been committed with passion were full of opportunities to closely monitor the recent events of recent history, such as Recep Tayyip Erdogan's political ban was lifted, the AKP was to rise to power, the coup plans, the Council of State attack, 2007 Presidential election, April 27 e-memorandum, Republic rallies, the closure case of the AKP, Ergenekon and Balyoz operations, 2010 referendum, The Gezi events. In addition I worked on the anti-corruption probe of 17-25 December, 30 March elections, 2014 Presidential election, June 7 and November 1, 2015 elections and especially July 15 coup attempt.\n\nI live abroad since November 2015. I wrote articles on www.tr724.com from December 2016 to July 2018. Now I'm writing for my own web site www.ahmetdonmez.net and Patreon. I am trying to maintain my accumulations in this field with my writings written in the light of new experiences. I am the father of two beautiful 'human flowers' named Esat Ziya and Ayşe Hafsa."
