        "text": "This live blog has ended\n\nAn interim government headed by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus will take oath in Bangladesh at 8 p.m. on Thursday, Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said at a press conference on Wednesday (August 7, 2024).\n\nThe 84-year-old microfinance pioneer will arrive at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka on an Emirates flight from Dubai on Thursday afternoon, the Yunus Center said in a press release.\n\nAlso Read: Sheikh Hasina’s ouster: Nobel winner Muhammad Yunus ready to lead after Hasina flees\n\nMr. Yunus asked the youth to be calm and get ready to build the country. “I congratulate the brave students who took the lead in making our ‘Second Victory Day’ possible and to the people for giving your total support to them. Let us make the best use of our new victory. Let us not let this slip away because of our mistakes,” he said in the statement.\n\nAlso Read: Analysis: Why Hasina fell\n\nThe Labour Appellate Tribunal on Wednesday overturned a six-month jail sentence awarded to Mr. Yunus in a case filed over alleged violation of the labour law.\n\nThe Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the main Opposition party when former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was in power, held a rally at Naya Paltan in Dhaka, where thousands of people gathered from different parts of the country."
