The workshop of Don Carlos lasts twenty years, from 1866 to 1886, when Verdi (reopens and closes several other workshops (Simon Boccanegra, La forza del destino, Aida, Requiem, Otello, creating a porous work in progress, whose analysis keeps giving us surprises. The libretto by Joseph MÃ©ry et Camille Du Locle, under the supervision of the composer, is a palimpsest where, under the official text referable to the common historical nucleus and its best known literary versions, some hidden or deleted heterogeneous texts appear, in a supranational, multilinguistic, intercultural and intertextual dimension, not always stirring along the road of a locatable derivation, of a voluntary imitation, but sometimes taking the shape of an unpredictable dissemination.\n\nRivas y Verdi: Las trampas de la libertad en La fuerza del sino y La forza del destino\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEgido, Aurora\n\n2012-06-01\n\nFull Text Available A comparative analysis between Duque de RivasâDon Ãlvaro o la fuerza del sino and La forza del destino by Giuseppe Verdi shows, even in their very titles, the close relationship between Spain and Italy since the days of the Golden Age. Both works posit the old theological problem of compatibility between predestination and free will, while adding new social and political insights into social and racial differences and highlighting the narrowness of the code of honour. Otherwise, as far as the admixture of genres or the treatment of costumbrismo and nationalism are concerned, the difference between both works increases in the second version of VerdiÂ´s opera, in which the alteration of the denouement wipes out the tragical dimension of the spanish play.Un anÃ¡lisis comparativo entre Don Ãlvaro o la fuerza del sino del duque de Rivas y La forza del destino de Giuseppe Verdi demuestra, ya desde sus tÃ­tulos, un viaje de y vuelta entre EspaÃ±a e Italia que tiene como fondo la literatura del Siglo de Oro. Ambas obras plantean el viejo problema entre providencia y libertad, aÃ±adiendo nuevos relieves sociales y polÃ­ticos sobre las diferencias de clase y raza que ponen en evidencia las estrecheces del cÃ³digo del honor. Las diferencias entre ambas âmÃ¡s allÃ¡ de la mezcla genÃ©rica, el tratamiento costumbrista y el nacionalismoâ se acentÃºan en la segunda versiÃ³n de la Ã³pera verdiana, que, al cambiar el desenlace, destruyÃ³ el sentido trÃ¡gico del drama espaÃ±ol.\n\nMacbeth by Giuseppe Verdi and the Romantic reception of William Shakespeareâs drama\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlina Borkowska-Rychlewska\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Romantic approach to William Shakespeareâs dramatic works, as well as the notions and questions so vital for the consciousness of the epoch concerning the capacity and function of destiny, unrecognizability of existence, interference of supernatural powers in the world that can be grasped with human mind and common sense, are all intriguingly transparent in Giuseppe Verdiâs Macbeth. The Italian composer, who knew the Romantic reception of Shakespeareâs dramatic plays well (e.g. the Italian translations of the lectures given by August W. Schlegel, embarked upon the issue of the ambiguity of the scene with the witches that appear to Macbeth, posed a question on the cognitive value in the dreamy apparition (in the brilliantly constructed Lady Macbethâs sleepwalking scene, and, finally, emphasized the aspect of hybridity of the world that inseparably combines the grandeur and the grotesque (the point highlighted in Victor Hugoâs considerations on Shakespeare. The two versions of the operatic Macbeth â the one produced in Florence in 1847, the other, 1865 revised version produced for Paris â relate well with the long sequence of changeable conventions in the nineteenth century theatre, taking into consideration its requirements (the need for a spectacular character of staging, the introduction of multiple Ake a Romantic implant in the operetta world of farcical braggadocio dominant on the Parisian stage at the time of the Second Empire, testifies to the enormous influence of the Romantic reception of Shakespeare exerted at the time and defining for a considerable period of time the concept of adaptation of the works of the Stradford master to meet the needs of the operatic stage.\n\nTorinos esitati Arvo PÃ¤rdo uusteost\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\n2006-01-01\n\nTorino olÃ¼mpia kultuuriprogrammi tellitud helilooja Arvo PÃ¤rdi autoriÃµhtust ja uue teose \"La Sindone\" esiettekandest 15. veebr.

For some objects making predictable future close approaches to the Earth, orbital uncertainties may be such that a collision with the Earth cannot be ruled out. Careful and responsible communication between astronomers and the public is required for reporting these predictions and a 0-10 point hazard scale, reported inseparably with the date of close encounter, is recommended as a simple and efficient tool for this purpose. The goal of this scale, endorsed as the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, is to place into context the level of public concern that is warranted for any close encounter event within the next century. Concomitant reporting of the close encounter date further conveys the sense of urgency that is warranted. The Torino Scale value for a close approach event is based upon both collision probability and the estimated kinetic energy (collision consequence), where the scale value can change as probability and energy estimates are refined by further data. On the scale, Category 1 corresponds to collision probabilities that are comparable to the current annual chance for any given size impactor. Categories 8-10 correspond to certain (probability >99%) collisions having increasingly dire consequences. While close approaches falling Category 0 may be no cause for noteworthy public concern, there remains a professional responsibility to further refine orbital parameters for such objects and a figure of merit is suggested for evaluating such objects. Because impact predictions represent a multi-dimensional problem, there is no unique or perfect translation into a one-dimensional system such as the Torino Scale. These limitations are discussed.\n\nUudised : \"Eesti vÃ¤Ã¤rtorelid\" 3. Verdi festival Estonias.

It allows measuring the kinetic energy and velocity of both fission fragments simultaneously. The velocity provides information about the pre-neutron mass of each fission fragment when isotropic prompt-neutron emission from the fragments is assumed. The kinetic energy, in combination with the velocity, provides the post-neutron mass. From the difference between pre- and post-neutron masses, the number of neutrons emitted by each fragment can be determined. Multiplicity as a function of fragment mass and total kinetic energy is one important ingredient, essential for understanding the sharing of excitation energy between fission fragments at scission, and may be used to benchmark nuclear de-excitation models. The VERDI spectrometer design is a compromise between geometrical efficiency and mass resolution. The spectrometer consists of an electron detector located close to the target and two arrays of silicon detectors, each located 50 cm away from the target. In the present configuration pre-neutron and post-neutron mass distributions are in good agreement with reference data were obtained. Our latest measurements performed with spontaneously fissioning 252Cf is presented along with the developed calibration procedure to obtain pulse height defect and plasma delay time corrections.\n\nSelected works of Giuseppe Peano\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nKennedy, Hubert, C\n\n1973-01-01\n\nIn the decade before 1900, the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano was one of the most original and influential pioneers of modern mathematical logic.

O.; Oberstedt, S.; Gamboni, Th.; Geerts, W.; Hambsch, F.-J.; Vidali, M.\n\n2016-05-01\n\nThe VERDI spectrometer (VElocity foR Direct mass Identification) is a two arm time-of-flight spectrometer built at the European Commission Joint Research Centre IRMM. It determines fragment masses and kinetic energy distributions produced in nuclear fission by means of the double velocity and double energy (2v-2E) method. The simultaneous measurement of pre- and post neutron fragment characteristics allows studying the share of excitation energy between the two fragments. In particular, the evolution of fission modes and neutron multiplicity may be studied as a function of the available excitation energy. Both topics are of great importance for the development of models used in the evaluation of nuclear data, and also have important implications for the fundamental understanding of the fission process. The development of VERDI focus on maximum geometrical efficiency while striving for highest possible mass resolution. An innovative transmission start detector, using electrons ejected from the target itself, was developed. Stop signal and kinetic energy of both fragments are provided by two arrays of silicon detectors. The present design provides about 200 times higher geometrical efficiency than that of the famous COSI FAN TUTTE spectrometer [Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research 219 (1984) 569]. We report about a commissioning experiment of the VERDI spectrometer, present first results from a 2v-2E measurement of 252Cf spontaneous fission and discuss the potential of this instrument to contribute to the investigation prompt fission neutron characteristics as a function of fission fragment properties.\n\nResident Perceptions of the 2006 Torino Olympic Games, 2002-2007.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nALESSANDRO CHITO GUALA,\n\n2009-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Previous Olympic Games research has been primarily on economic impacts, tourists, and destination image with most being one-off assessments of the Summer Games. Other than Ritchie's landmark study of the Calgary Winter Olympic Games, relatively few research studies on the Winter Olympic Games have been published, and fewer still concerning resident attitudes throughout the full lifecycle of the event, from bidding, preparation, operation, and legacy stages. Residents are in a unique position to evaluate an event's legacy as taxpayers, daily consumers of infrastructure, and as possible leisure consumers of Olympic sport venues. The purpose of this study was to examine Torino residents' perceptions of their city as host of the 2006 Torino Winter Olympic Games from 2002-2007. Results from telephone interviews with Torino residents (n = 900 interviews per year; N = 5,400 are presented to reflect the attitudes of the population toward the 2006 Winter Olympic Games over time. Residents experienced a \"rollercoaster\" of emotions during the event lifecycle ranging from euphoria once the Games were awarded, to concern over escalating production costs, irritation with inconveniences due to construction, and ultimately pride immediately following the Games. Implications of study findings for event and destination managers are discussed.\n\nA new Volcanic managEment Risk Database desIgn (VERDI): Application to El Hierro Island (Canary Islands)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBartolini, S.; Becerril, L.; MartÃ­, J.\n\n2014-11-01\n\nOne of the most important issues in modern volcanology is the assessment of volcanic risk, which will depend - among other factors - on both the quantity and quality of the available data and an optimum storage mechanism. This will require the design of purpose-built databases that take into account data format and availability and afford easy data storage and sharing, and will provide for a more complete risk assessment that combines different analyses but avoids any duplication of information. Data contained in any such database should facilitate spatial and temporal analysis that will (1) produce probabilistic hazard models for future vent opening, (2) simulate volcanic hazards and (3) assess their socio-economic impact. We describe the design of a new spatial database structure, VERDI (Volcanic managEment Risk Database desIgn), which allows different types of data, including geological, volcanological, meteorological, monitoring and socio-economic information, to be manipulated, organized and managed. The root of the question is to ensure that VERDI will serve as a tool for connecting different kinds of data sources, GIS platforms and modeling applications. We present an overview of the database design, its components and the attributes that play an important role in the database model. The potential of the VERDI structure and the possibilities it offers in regard to data organization are here shown through its application on El Hierro (Canary Islands). The VERDI database will provide scientists and decision makers with a useful tool that will assist to conduct volcanic risk assessment and management.\n\nGiuseppe Pasta (1742-1823): protophysician and pioneer of psychological studies in the medical field.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nClerici, Carlo Alfredo; Veneroni, Laura; Poli, Marco\n\n2009-11-01\n\nGiuseppe Pasta was a pioneer of psychological support in physical disease. Born in Bergamo, Italy, he was a cousin of the physician Andrea Pasta who was a pupil of Giovanni Battista Morgagni. Giuseppe's cultural and clinical resources were the teachings of Francesco Redi's medical school in Tuscany.

La ricerca affronta la possibilitÃ di ricorrere al crowdfunding attraverso il caso studio del progetto di âTorino Esposizioniâ, unâarchitettura del â900, parzialmente utilizzata, in stato di degrado, nonostante sia riconosciuta dalla critica internazionale come unâopera di eccezionale valore. A partire dal Master Plan, messo a punto dal Politecnico di Torino in collaborazione con la CittÃ di Torino, Ã¨ stata simulata lâapplicabilitÃ del crowdfunding attraverso unâindagine che valuta la disponibilitÃ a contribuire da parte dei potenziali fruitori del complesso di âTorino Esposizioniâ e, quindi, a comprendere lâinteresse dei cittadini nei confronti del valore storico del complesso di âTorino Esposizioniâ e del progetto di riuso che dovrebbe valorizzarlo. Gli esiti della ricerca, nellâevidenziare unâinattesa scarsa disponibilitÃ a contribuire al finanziamento collettivo del progetto, hanno messo in evidenza, non solo la scarsa conoscenza del crowdfunding come strumento di finanziamento, ma anche la scarsa consapevolezza del valore storico architettonico del patrimonio moderno della cittÃ di Torino, di cui âTorino Esposizioniâ rappresenta un esempio eccezionale, seppur non lâunico.\n\nProfessor Camillo Negro's Neuropathological Films.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChiÃ², Adriano; Gianetto, Claudia; Dagna, Stella\n\n2016-01-01\n\nCamillo Negro, Professor in Neurology at the University of Torino, was a pioneer of scientific film. From 1906 to 1908, with the help of his assistant Giuseppe Roasenda and in collaboration with Roberto Omegna, one of the most experienced cinematographers in Italy, he filmed some of his patients for scientific and educational purposes. During the war years, he continued his scientific film project at the Military Hospital in Torino, filming shell-shocked soldiers. In autumn 2011, the Museo Nazionale del Cinema, in partnership with the Faculty of Neurosciences of the University of Torino, presented a new critical edition of the neuropathological films directed by Negro. The Museum's collection also includes 16 mm footage probably filmed in 1930 by Doctor Fedele Negro, Camillo's son. One of these films is devoted to celebrating the effects of the so-called \"Bulgarian cure\" on Parkinson's disease.\n\nGiuseppe Moscati (1880-1927): a holistic approach to medicine.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPonti, Giovanni; Tomasi, Aldo\n\n2014-05-01\n\nGiuseppe Moscati was a physician, medical school professor and a pioneer in the field of biochemistry and Italian studies on diabetes.

Three generations of physicians from the Frari family played an important role not only at medical and social scene of Sibenik in the 18th and 19th century, but also in Croatian and Italian medical history. I will try to provide important details on the lives, medical and social work, and publications of 5 members of the family, Giuseppe (Josip), Angelo Antonio (Andeo Antun), Sebastiano (Sebastijan), Michele Carlo (Mihovil), and Aloysius (Luigi) Frari. I would also like to pay a special attention to the works on rabies, written by Giuseppe and Luigi Frari, which are among the earliest and most accurate Croatian works on the subject. To reconstruct the history of the family, I studied the relevant editions about the medical and social history of Sibenik, Dalmatia, Venice, and Croatia, together with the Fraris' publications and reflections.

Pre-neutron fission-fragment masses will be determined by the double time-of-flight (TOF technique. For this purpose an excellent time resolution is required. The time of flight of the fragments will be measured by electrostatic mirrors located near the target and the time signal coming from silicon detectors located at 50 cm on both sides of the target. This configuration, where the stop detector will provide us simultaneously with the kinetic energy of the fragment and timing information, significantly limits energy straggling in comparison to legacy experimental setup where a thin foil was usually used as a stop detector. In order to improve timing resolution, neutron transmutation doped silicon will be used. The high resistivity homogeneity of this material should significantly improve resolution in comparison to standard silicon detectors. Post-neutron fission fragment masses are obtained form the time-of-flight and the energy signal in the silicon detector. As an intermediary step a diamond detector will also be used as start detector located very close to the target. Previous tests have shown that poly-crystalline chemical vapour deposition (pCVD diamonds provides a coincidence time resolution of 150 ps not allowing complete separation between very low-energy fission fragments, alpha particles and noise. New results from using artificial single-crystal diamonds (sCVD show similar time resolution as from pCVD diamonds but also sufficiently good energy resolution.\n\nCommentary: Giuseppe Campani (1635-1715, Rome, Italy): the First Use of a Microscope in Medicine and Surgery.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBrogna, Christian; Millesi, Matthias; Fiengo, Leslie; Richardson, Mark; Bhangoo, Ranjeev; Ashkan, Keyoumars; TÃ¼re, Ugur\n\n2018-02-01\n\nGiuseppe Campani (1635-1715) was a polymath in Rome, Italy, during the Scientific Revolution in the XVIIth century. In particular, he forged the screw barrel microscope and was manufacturing his own lenses for microscopes and telescopes. He mastered the art of lens grinding. Those lenses have been analyzed with modern methods and turned out to be of extremely good quality, shining light on the fact that Giuseppe Campani mastered the theories of optics. Moreover, in a letter that Giuseppe Campani sent to Pope Innocent XI, he clearly described the use of a microscope for the examination of wounds of legs. This letter dates back to 15 August 1686 and is the first evidence of the use of microscopes to analyze wounds, sores, and anatomic specimens in medical and surgical settings. MG Yasargil previously showed the lithography accompanying this letter and was the first to recognize its great importance. We accessed this original letter in the Vatican Library, and for the first time we have translated it from Latin to English in order to unveil its significance in the context of the Scientific Revolution and the history of medicine and surgery.

The research addresses the possibility of using crowdfunding through the case study of the reuse project of Torino Esposizioni, an architectural work from the '900, partially used, in a state of decay, despite being recognized by international critics as a work of exceptional value. After the Master Plan had been developed by the Turin Polytechnic in collaboration with the City of Turin, the applicability of crowdfunding was analyzed by a survey to evaluate the willingness of the potential users to contribute to the Torino Esposizioni reuse project. In addition to this, the interest of citizens in the historical value of the Torino Esposizioni and the reuse project that would enhance it has been understood. The survey results have highlighted unexpected unwillingness to contribute to the collective funding of the project. Furthermore, they have revealed not only the lack of knowledge of crowdfunding as a means of financing, but also the lack of awareness of the value of Turinâs historical and modern architectural heritage, of which Torino Esposizioni is an outstanding example, although not the only one.\n\nGran Torino's Hmong Lead Bee Vang on Film, Race, and Masculinity: Conversations with Louisa Schein\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLouisa Schein\n\n2010-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Bee Vang, of Minneapolis, played the Hmong lead Thao Vang Lor in Clint Eastwood's 2008 Gran Torino. He was sixteen when he shot the film and had no acting training. For 27 days on location in urban Detroit he played before a Hollywood crew opposite an icon of the filmindustry doing multiple takes of each scene and camera angle. The shoot was full of unexpected twists and turns some of which he recounts in these interchanges with Hmong media expert Louisa Schein of the Departments of Anthropology and Women's and Gender Studies at Rutgers University. Over several conversations, condensed here, Vang and Schein talk about Gran Torino, about acting and film critique, about immigrants and stereotypes, about masculinity and sexuality, and about Vang's vision for what needs to change to address problems of race and inequality in and beyond media worlds.\n\nThe Force of Destiny: a parody orchestrated with mastery by NÃ©lida PiÃ±on.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNeiva Kampff Garcia\n\n2009-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The present work is an analytic reading of the novel The Force of Destiny, by NÃ©lida PiÃ±on, which was published in 1978 an has a theme that dialogues with the opera of same title composed in 1861 by Giuseppe Verdi.

Three generations of physicians from the Frari family played an important role not only at medical and social scene of Å ibenik in the 18th and 19th century, but also in Croatian and Italian medical history. I will try to provide important details on the lives, medical and social work, and publications of 5 members of the family, Giuseppe (Josip), Angelo Antonio (AnÄeo Antun), Sebastiano (Sebastijan), Michele Carlo (Mihovil), and Aloysius (Luigi) Frari. I would also like to pay a special attention to the works on rabies, written by Giuseppe and Luigi Frari, which are among the earliest and most accurate Croatian works on the subject. To reconstruct the history of the family, I studied the relevant editions about the medical and social history of Å ibenik, Dalmatia, Venice, and Croatia, together with the Frarisâ publications and reflections. This was the first time Italian and Latin language works by Giuseppe and Luigi Frari on rabies were analyzed. The story on Fraris also documents that medical publishing was a common practice in Dalmatia in the 18th and the 19th century.

A leading figure at American RCA, G.A. Biondo moved to Rome during the 1950s, where he founded RCA Italiana and, a few years later, International Recording, which became one of the main post-production companies in Italy until the 2000s. These operations deeply impacted on the technological and industrial setting of Italian cinema. In this essay we recall G.A. Biondoâs early years in the US and we deal with the chain of events that led to the birth of International Recording.\n\n[Giuseppe Saverio Poli: magnetic therapy in Palermo at the beginning of XIX cent].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMazzola, Roberto\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe article presents a not well known text written by Giuseppe Saverio Poli, one of the most important South italian scientist, living and working between the end of XVIII century and the first years of XIX century. The Breve saggio sulle virtÃ¹ curative della calamita, printed in Palermo in 1811, is a short text devoted to one of the most controversial scientific topic of those years, magnetic therapy.\n\nGiuseppe Sergi, \"champion\" of Darwinism?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVolpone, Alessandro\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe Italian anthropologist, psychologist and evolutionist Giuseppe Sergi (1841-1936) may be regarded in some respects today as an \"atypical\" Darwinist, but, almost paradoxically, he was considered a \"champion\" of Darwinism by colleagues and commentators of his own time. Probably, two aspects of his work are responsible for this apparent anomaly: his faith in the so-called soft inheritance and his claims regarding a theory concerning the polyphyletic origin of human races. The soft inheritance theory, however, was needed by Sergi to support ideas regarding the complexity of inheritance in man, a fact that, in his opinion, could not completely be put down to mechanical laws, and polygeny was useful when trying to rectify the problem concerning the incompleteness of the fossil record. In both cases, it is possible to show that he was involved in supporting Darwinian theory during the most severe crisis of its consensus in Italy and at International level, between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. Finally, the apparent unorthodox features which can be found in Sergi's ideas appear to be, in Kuhnian terms, ad hoc hypotheses put forward by Sergi himself in order to support the paradigm.\n\nPROF.

Clouds in areas dominated by a close sea-ice cover were observed during the research campaign Vertical distribution of ice in Arctic mixed-phase clouds (VERDI, April/May 2012) and the Radiation-Aerosol-Cloud Experiment in the Arctic Circle (RACEPAC, April/May 2014) which both were based in Inuvik, Canada. The aircraft (Polar 5 & 6, Basler BT-67) operated by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, Germany did cover a wide area above the Canadian Beaufort with in total 149 flight hours (62h during VERDI, 87h during RACEPAC). For May/June 2017 a third campaign ACLOUD (Arctic Clouds - Characterization of Ice, aerosol Particles and Energy fluxes) with base in Svalbard is planned within the Transregional Collaborative Research Centre TR 172 ArctiC Amplification: Climate Relevant Atmospheric and SurfaCe Processes, and Feedback Mechanisms (AC)3 to investigate Arctic clouds in the transition zone between open ocean and sea ice. The aim of all campaigns is to combine remote sensing and in-situ cloud, aerosol and trace gas measurements to investigate interactions between radiation, cloud and aerosol particles. While during VERDI remote sensing and in-situ measurements were performed by one aircraft subsequently, for RACEPAC and ACLOUD two identical aircraft are coordinated at different altitudes to horizontally collocate both remote sensing and in-situ measurements. The campaign showed that in this way radiative and microphysical processes in the clouds can by studied more reliably and remote sensing methods can be validated efficiently. Here we will illustrate the scientific strategy of the projects including the progress in instrumentation. Differences in the general synoptic and sea ice situation and related changes in cloud properties at the different locations and seasons will be\n\nIdentity, memory and la diarchia di bronzo Commemorating Vittorio Emanuele II and Giuseppe Garibaldi in post-Risorgimento Venice\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLaura Parker\n\n2011-12-01\n\nFull Text Available IdentitÃ , memoria e la diarchia di bronzo Una commemorazione di Vittorio Emanuele II e Giuseppe Garibaldi nella Venezia postrisorgimentale Â Questo saggio tratta della collocazione di due monumenti nella cittÃ di Venezia, nella seconda metÃ dellâOttocento.

In the focus is the etching Great Bravery of Croatian soldier (Gran prodezza di soldato croatto. The author concludes, interpreting the explanatory text below the etching, that it depicts an event of the so-called Great Turkish War (1683-1699. The depicted hero belonged to the Croatian Regiment commanded by general James Leslie, and the depicted heroic act occurred, in all probability, during the battle of Virovitica in 1684. Also, the author points out to a model for Mitelli's etching as well as to the literary image of the simultaneous decapitation of both a horseman and a horse in the Croatian literature. In the same year, Mitelli also made the portrait of the Zagreb bishop and the politician Martin BorkoviÄ. The existence of both etchings is associated with the Illyrian-Hungarian College in Bologna, governed by the Zagreb cathedral Chapter. L'articolo indaga l'iconografia di due incisioni con soggetto croato realizzate dall'incisore bolognese Giuseppe Maria Mitelli nel 1684. Il focus del saggio Ã¨ l'incisione Gran prodezza di soldato croatto. Interpretando il testo esplicativo sotto l'acquaforte, l'autore ritiene che essa raffiguri un evento della cosiddetta Grande Guerra Turca (1683-1699. L'eroe raffigurato apparteneva al reggimento croato comandato dal generale James Leslie e l'atto eroico raffigurato avvenne, con ogni probabilitÃ , durante la battaglia di Virovitica nel 1684. L'autore individua inoltre un modello per l'incisione di Mitelli e un riferimento a una fonte nella letteratura croata ove compare la decapitazione simultanea di un cavaliere e di un cavallo. Nello stesso anno Mitelli fece anche il ritratto del vescovo di Zagabria e del politico Martin BorkoviÄ. L'esistenza di entrambe le acqueforti Ã¨ associata al Collegio illirico-ungarico di Bologna, governato dal Capitolo della\n\n[An illustrious unknown. Giuseppe Levi among science, anti-fascism and Nobel Prizes].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGrignolio, Andrea; De Sio, Fabio\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe anatomist Giuseppe Levi (1872-1965) is unanimously considered one of the major figures of Italian biomedical sciences in the 20th century. His fame, however, is mainly derived from having nurtured three Nobel Prize winners, namely Salvador E. Luria, Rita Levi Montalcini and Renato Dulbecco. In reappraising Levi's role in the development of Italian science and culture in general, this article aims at questioning both the narrowness of earlier accounts and a certain kind of genealogical approach to the history of scientific disciplines and academic schools. We will here consider Giuseppe Levi as an instance of two major cultural phenomena: the development of experimental biology in Italy and continental Europe and the anti-fascist socialist culture expressed by a part of the Italian intellectuals. In so doing, we will reassess the historical specificity of the scientific maturation of Levi's three famous students, on the one hand, while on the other we will consider in some depth the cultural and moral environment in which Levi thrived and his role as a moral example for his students. Such revision, we will argue, have a direct bearing on more general historiographical issues, namely, the need for a stronger contextualization of the birth and consolidation of research traditions, implying a rejection of simplistic genealogical reconstructions, and the role of academic schools and institutional settings in the definition of novel, multidisciplinary scientific approaches. Finally, the following will highlight the importance of a more careful outlook on the master-pupil relationship in academic context, addressing issues of both continuity and rupture. The article is subdivided in two main sections, the first devoted to Levi as a scientist, the second to his Anti-fascism.\n\nMuusikamaailm : Homme Verdi mÃ¤lestuspÃ¤ev. Placido Domingo juubel.

More than 18,000 specimens have been classified and assigned to 798 taxa (cf. Tab. I. The compositional analyses mainly concern the 672 listed gastropods, most of which were already described in classical monographies. The critical evaluation of the morphological and architectural shell parameters let to a significant reduction of the species that could be realistically maintained in comparison to those cited in literature from the Torino Hills Miocene. Six localities have been analyzed: Valle Ceppi (VC and Val SanfrÃ (VS referred to the middle part of the Burdigalian stage (N7a Biozone, Villa Bertini at the topmost Burdigalian, Villa Allason (VA and Villa Forzano (VF at the early Langhian (N8 Biozone and Monte dei Cappuccini (MC at the late Langhian (N9 Biozone. On the whole, the fossil assemblages show a taxonomic variation of both biochronologic and palaeobiogeographic meaning. Actually, the similarity in specific biodiversity of VC, VS, VB, VA and VS reflects homogeneity among late Burdigalian to early Langhian palaeocommunities. As to MC, its deep difference on VC is correlatable with the eastern closing between the Mediterranean areas and the Tethyan Realm, at the boundary Burdigalian-Langhian, that brought to disjoint evolutions of the Mediterranean and Indo-Pacific palaeocommunities, the former being influenced by oceanic current changes and related climatic variations.Â\n\nLâuso di piattaforme digitali collaborative nella prospettiva di unâamministrazione condivisa.

Tale prospettiva Ã¨ declinata nel progetto pilota MiraMap, a Torino, nella Circoscrizione Mirafiori Sud, di cui Ã¨ responsabile un gruppo di ricerca del Politecnico di Torino. Il progetto implementa e sviluppa una precedente esperienza effettuata nel 2013 (Crowdmapping MirafioriSud, il cui scopo principale era quello di verificare se l'uso delle ICT potesse generare e supportare processi di inclusione sociale. Attraverso la lettura del processo MiraMap, degli obiettivi, della metodologia adottata, delle fasi e delle linee di azione vengono evidenziati ragionamenti di natura interdisciplinare e tecnica relativi a: la strutturazione dei rapporti con le Istituzioni, in particolare la Pubblica Amministrazione, nei processi di pianificazione e gestione dello spazio pubblico; lâinnesco di processi di inclusione, partecipazione e di civic engagement; lâidentificazione degli apporti che tali sperimentazioni possono generare nella costruzione di una rinnovata governance urbana. Il presente contributo delinea infine una possibile metodologia per il monitoraggio e la valutazione di impatto ex post, basata sulla Community Impact Analysis/Evaluation (CIA/CIE, che valuta in modo descrittivo gli impatti â pecuniari e non â originati dal progetto, in rapporto ai diversi soggetti coinvolti. Lâimpiego delle ICT puÃ² favorire processi di trasparenza e rafforzare lâaccountability della PA, a condizione che la tecnologia sia fattore abilitante e non di esclusione. Lâanalisi puntuale del caso fornisce spunti di riflessione in merito a tale approccio innovativo: la relazione cittadino/PA puÃ² contribuire nel medio-lungo termine a veicolare impatti socio-economici positivi sul territorio, rendere il cittadino piÃ¹ informato e coinvolto e lâAmministrazione pi\n\nGiuseppe Sergi. The portrait of a positivist scientist.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCerro, Giovanni\n\n2017-12-30\n\nGiuseppe Sergi (1841-1936) was one of the most important anthropologists and psychologists of the age of positivism and this article focuses on three domains of his scientific research: degeneration, eugenics and race. His concept of degeneration is defined as the development of special forms of human adaptation to the environment. This issue is closely related to his theory of the \"stratification of character\", which had a profound impact on Italian psychiatry and criminal anthropology in the late nineteenth century. Thus, special emphasis is placed on the differences between Sergi and Cesare Lombroso regarding their definitions of criminality and genius. Concerning eugenics, the article analyzes Sergi's key role in the Italian context, discussing his eugenic program based on both repression and education. His remedies against the spread of degeneration included not only radical and repressive measures, but also the improvement of popular education and the living conditions of the working class. In the field of physical anthropology, the article examines Sergi's morphological method of classifying ethnic groups. Although sharply criticized in Italy and abroad, this method had two major effects. First, it led to the definitive split between Sergi and Paolo Mantegazza and to the foundation of the SocietÃ¡ Romana di Antropologia in 1893. Second, it was the starting point for Sergi's theory of Mediterranean \"stock\", which claimed that European populations were of African origin in contrast to contemporary theories of Aryan supremacy. The article ends with a look at the heated debate over Sergi's Mediterraneanism during the period of Fascism.\n\nParticipatory approach, acceptability and transparency of waste management LCAs: case studies of Torino and Cuneo.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBlengini, Gian Andrea; Fantoni, Moris; Busto, Mirko; Genon, Giuseppe; Zanetti, Maria Chiara\n\n2012-09-01\n\nThe paper summarises the main results obtained from two extensive applications of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to the integrated municipal solid waste management systems of Torino and Cuneo Districts in northern Italy. Scenarios with substantial differences in terms of amount of waste, percentage of separate collection and options for the disposal of residual waste are used to discuss the credibility and acceptability of the LCA results, which are adversely affected by the large influence of methodological assumptions and the local socio-economic constraints. The use of site-specific data on full scale waste treatment facilities and the adoption of a participatory approach for the definition of the most sensible LCA assumptions are used to assist local public administrators and stakeholders showing them that LCA can be operational to waste management at local scale.

Historical vignette.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMatis, Georgios K; de A Silva, Danilo O; Chrysou, Olga I; Karanikas, Michail A; Birbilis, Theodossios A\n\n2012-01-01\n\nGiuseppe Gradenigo (1859-1926), a legendary figure of Otology, was born in Venice, Italy. He soon became a pupil to Adam Politzer and Samuel Leopold Schenk in Vienna, demonstrating genuine interest in the embryology, morphology, physiopathology, as well as the clinical manifestations of ear diseases. In this paper, the authors attempt to highlight the major landmarks during Gradenigo's career and outline his contributions to neurosciences, which have been viewed as looking forward to the 20(th) century rather than awkward missteps at the end of the 19(th). Several rare photographs along with many non-English, more than a century old articles have been meticulously selected to enrich this historical journey in time. It was after Gradenigo that the well-known syndrome consisting of diplopia and facial pain due to a middle ear infection was named. However, Gradenigo was much more than a syndrome. Surprisingly, despite the fact that he is considered a pioneer of the Italian Otology of the late 19(th) and early 20(th) century, little is written of his life and his notable achievements in the English literature. Even though his name lives on nowadays only in the eponym \"Gradenigo's syndrome,\" his accomplishments are much wider and cast him among the emblematic figures of science. His inherent tendency for discovering the underlying mechanisms of diseases and his vision of guaranteeing quality of services, professional proficiency, respect, and dedication toward the patients is in fact what constitutes his true legacy to the next generations.\n\nGiuseppe E. Sansone traduttore di lirica romanza medievale. Contributo per una storia della traduzione poetica in Italia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSperanza Cerullo\n\n2013-07-01\n\nFull Text Available La traduzione di poesia medievale in Italia ha avuto notevole sviluppo negli ultimi venti anni, attraverso lâincremento dellâattivitÃ dei traduttori e la promozione di un confronto su questioni di ordine teorico o metodologico, strettamente legate al tema dellâattualizzazione del testo medievale. In questo quadro, il contributo di Giuseppe Sansone ha svolto un ruolo di primo rilievo, attraverso unâattivitÃ ininterrotta che conta la pubblicazione di scritti di indirizzo critico-teorico e di cinque antologie di lirica medievale di diversi ambiti linguistici â occitano, spagnolo, catalano, galego e, in misura minore, francese â, offrendo modelli e appunti di metodo nei quali competenze scientifiche e filologiche si coniugano con una sensibilitÃ estetica dâautore, guidata dallâobiettivo primario di una rifondazione del testo poetico nella sua letterarietÃ , dove la traduzione in versi si propone come testo dotato di una propria autonomia estetica.Over the last twenty years the translation of medieval poetry in Italy has had considerable development due to the increased activity of the translators; besides, a debate on theoretical or methodological issues closely related to the theme of updating medieval texts has been promoted. In this context, the contribution of Giuseppe Sansone and his continuous activity has played a key role: he published critical-theoretical essays and five anthologies of medieval lyrics from different linguistic areas â ProvenÃ§al, Spanish, Catalan, Galician and, to a lesser extent, French â thus offering models and methodological suggestions in which scientific and philological skills combine with aesthetic sensibility, driven from the primary method of re-founding the poetic text in its literary property, in which the verse translation is proposed as a text with its own aesthetic autonomy.\n\nDynamic interactions between musical, cardiovascular, and cerebral rhythms in humans.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBernardi, Luciano; Porta, Cesare; Casucci, Gaia; Balsamo, Rossella; Bernardi, NicolÃ² F; Fogari, Roberto; Sleight, Peter\n\n2009-06-30\n\nReactions to music are considered subjective, but previous studies suggested that cardiorespiratory variables increase with faster tempo independent of individual preference. We tested whether compositions characterized by variable emphasis could produce parallel instantaneous cardiovascular/respiratory responses and whether these changes mirrored music profiles. Twenty-four young healthy subjects, 12 musicians (choristers) and 12 nonmusician control subjects, listened (in random order) to music with vocal (Puccini's \"Turandot\") or orchestral (Beethoven's 9th Symphony adagio) progressive crescendos, more uniform emphasis (Bach cantata), 10-second period (ie, similar to Mayer waves) rhythmic phrases (Giuseppe Verdi's arias \"Va pensiero\" and \"Libiam nei lieti calici\"), or silence while heart rate, respiration, blood pressures, middle cerebral artery flow velocity, and skin vasomotion were recorded.Common responses were recognized by averaging instantaneous cardiorespiratory responses regressed against changes in music profiles and by coherence analysis during rhythmic phrases. Vocal and orchestral crescendos produced significant (P=0.05 or better) correlations between cardiovascular or respiratory signals and music profile, particularly skin vasoconstriction and blood pressures, proportional to crescendo, in contrast to uniform emphasis, which induced skin vasodilation and reduction in blood pressures. Correlations were significant both in individual and group-averaged signals. Phrases at 10-second periods by Verdi entrained the cardiovascular autonomic variables. No qualitative differences in recorded measurements were seen between musicians and nonmusicians. Music emphasis and rhythmic phrases are tracked consistently by physiological variables. Autonomic responses are synchronized with music, which might therefore convey emotions through autonomic arousal during crescendos or rhythmic phrases.\n\nGÃ¥r samfunnet i pluss med plusskunder? : en litteraturstudie av plusskunders samfunnsÃ¸konomiske verdi i Norge, hvilken utvikling man kan forvente i antall plusskunder fremover og betydning for regulering\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nVestby, Line; Dvergsnes, Alexander\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPlusskunder er et relativt nytt fenomen i Norge og en ser allerede i dag vekst i dette segmentet.

Most of this cultural heritage had been lost by the late 18th and the first decades of the 19th century, when the former Venetian Dalmatia was taken over by Austrian administration, followed by the French and then again by the Austrian one. Many churches were closed down, their furnishings were sold away or lost, and the buildings were either repurposed or demolished. One of them had been home to two hitherto unpublished angels-putti located on the top of the inner side of the arch in the sanctuary of Zadarâs church of Our Lady of Health (KaÅ¡tel at the end of Kalelarga (Fig. 1. Both marble statues were obviously adjusted and then placed next to the marble cartouche with a subsequently added inscription from 1938, which tells of a reconstruction of the church during the time it was administered by the Capuchins. The drapery of the right angel-putto bears the initials I. G., which should be interpreted as the signature of the Venetian sculptor Giuseppe Groppelli (Venice, 1675-1735. This master signed his full name as IOSEPH GROPPELLI on the base of a statue of St Chrysogonus, now preserved in the Permanent Exhibition of Religious Art in Zadar (Fig. 2. Same as the signed statue of St Anastasia by master Antonio Corradini (Fig. 3, it used to form part of the main altar in Zadarâs monumental church of St Donatus, desacralized in 1798. Recently, two more angels have been discovered, inserted in the tympanum of the main altar in the church of Madonna of Loreto in Zadarâs district of Arbanasi, the one to the right likewise bearing the initials I. G. (Fig. 4. Undoubtedly, these two artworks were once part of a single composition: the abovementioned former altar in the church of St Donatus, transferred to the cathedral in 1822 and reconstructed to become the new altar in the chapel of St Anastasia\n\nA multi-disciplinary approach to study coastal complex landslides: the case of Torino di Sangro (Central Italy)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSciarra, Marco; Carabba, Luigi; Urbano, Tullio; Calista, Monia\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThis work illustrates the studies carried out on a complex landslide phenomenon between the Sangro and Osento River's mouths, near Torino di Sangro village in Southern Abruzzo Region (Italy). Historical activity of this landslide is well-documented since 1916; the activation/reactivation of the movements caused several interruptions of a national railway and the damage of few houses. The Torino di Sangro case study can be regarded as representative of many large landslides distributed along the central Adriatic coast (e.g., Ancona, Ortona, Vasto and Petacciato Landslides) that affect densely populated urban areas with a large amount of man-made infrastructure. The main controlling factors of these large and deep-seated landslides are still debated. From the geological and geomorphological viewpoint, the central Adriatic coast is characterized by a low-relief landscape (mesa) carved on clay-sandstone-conglomerate bedrock belonging to the Upper Pliocene - Lower Pleistocene marine deposits and locally to the Middle Pleistocene marine to continental transitional deposits. This high coast is widely affected by slope instability (rock falls, rotational, complex and shallow landslides) on both active and inactive sea cliffs, the first being mainly affected by wave-cut erosion and the latter influenced by heavy rainfall and changes of pore pressure. The main landslide has the typical characteristics of a deep-seated gravitation deformation. The landslide study was based on a multidisciplinary approach including: 1) definition and GIS mapping of geology and geomorphology factors (slope, aspect, topographic curvature, bedrock lithology, near-surface deposits, deposit thickness and land use), by means of DTM processing, multi-temporal analysis, and large-scale geomorphological field survey; 2) monitoring system in the landslide; 3) application of empiric models for the analysis of unstable sandstone-conglomerate escarpments; 4) slope stability analysis performed using a\n\nTorino 2006. XX Olympic and IX Paralympic Winter Games: the ENT experience.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSucco, G; Crosetti, E; Mattiazzo, A; Riontino, E; Massazza, G\n\n2008-06-01\n\nA total of 27 competition days, more than 3000 athletes, over 10,000 components of the Olympic family, 3,500 workers, 2,500 volunteers, an overall business of more than 2 billion Euros. These, in a nutshell, are just a few of the data concerning the XX Olympic and the IX Paralympic Winter Games, Torino, Italy, 2006. Such a huge event, obviously required a meticulously organized medical service to cope with the healthcare of the athletes, official workers and the Olympic family, distributed over a geographic area of approximately 80 km in diameter. An ENT service was organized within the medical service, which was divided between 3 Polyclinics, in which 12 ENT Specialists were on duty. The present report gives an account of the final data concerning the service involved, together with a description of the approach used in the actual organization, with a view to providing useful information for colleagues who will be called upon, for a similar service, in future Olympic Winter Games. The ENT healthcare offered was confirmed to be proportional to the requirements, both from a qualitative and quantitative point of view. All the ENT specialists involved, reported having gained an immense store of human experience from having lived the Olympic atmosphere as a volunteer exerting one's own profession. The facilities available in the Polyclinics, which were at a considerable distance from the Hospital, were found to be more than adequate with respect to the pathological conditions and service requested, particularly in 17% of the cases which would otherwise have been sent to a Hospital Outpatient Unit at least 80 km away.\n\nIl progetto âiVincoliâ del Politecnico di Torino.

Tale esperienza parte da una precisa premessa: ogni architettura informativa a servizio di atti e processi della Pubblica Amministrazione viene a configurarsi quale strumento prototipale di supporto alla riforma della stessa PA e alla governance. A fronte di tali ragionamenti, le Pubbliche Amministrazioni al momento attuale si stanno confrontando, da una parte, con i processi e i dibattiti in corso sul trasferimento delle funzioni centrali; dallâaltra, per lâaspetto di innovazione tecnologica con le direttive introdotte a partire dal Codice Unico della Pubblica Amministrazione Digitale. Di fatto, uno dei tasselli per la messa a punto di atti che innestino sinergie tra innovazione, efficienza amministrativa e gestione del territorio per una sua valorizzazione Ã¨ costituito da processi dâimplementazione di architetture informative configurate in SIT.

After a brief introduction of how this dichotomy has become paradigmatic in the western thought, we point out the philosophy of ClÃ©ment Rosset to discuss the central theme of the film: âthere is always something authentic in each copyâ. We argue, finally, that the illusion is not only to transform something into two, but also in the deluded's unwillingness to approve a reality that is impossible to duplicate.\n\nSub anno domini 1465...

Tale raccolta di saggi non solo restituisce le linee, i contenuti e le forme di una produzione critica monumentale ma ben mostra lâimportante ruolo di studioso e di uomo che il Bellini Ã¨ stato capace di esercitare, articolando attorno a sÃ© una nutrita scuola, a partire dalla visione della letteratura come rete di dialogo e di scambio. I diversi temi affrontati dai piÃ¹ di cinquantacinque saggi mostrano la straordinaria capacitÃ del Bellini di tessere una proficua rete di relazioni, di studio e di amicizia, e di promuovere lâispanoamericanismo italiano, sempre attraverso il riconoscimento della letteratura come lezione civile e del buon vivere.\n\n[Prof. Giuseppe Moscati (1880-1927). A special issue on his scientific production].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCascella, Marco\n\n2016-08-01\n\nProfessor Giuseppe Moscati (1880-1927) was canonized by the Catholic Church in 1987. This act recognized the extraordinary qualities of a doctor who, considering his work as a \"sublime mission\", dedicated his life to helping the sick. The fame of the \"Holy doctor\" or \"doctor of the poor\", as people called him, was soon widespread and, immediately after his death, made him the subject of several biographies. These treatises, mainly written by religious hagiographers, have little analyzed Moscati as a doctor and scientist, or, in rare cases, privileged the description of his medical career, touching only marginally salient aspects of his work as a scientist and researcher. The purpose of this paper is to provide an insight into the figure of Moscati as a scientist, contextualizing his research activities in the scientific fields of biochemistry and physiology, which were flourishing in the early twentieth century. By a more careful analysis, his scientific production appears original for the resource-poor context and the innovative research method. The Italian scientist, combining physiological chemistry and biochemistry at the clinic, anticipated the birth of modern branches as the \"Laboratory Medicine\" and the \"Clinical Pathology\". In particular, he carried out studies on diabetes, storage diseases, metabolism, toxicology, pathology, nephrology and occupational diseases. Moreover, he anticipated the concept of modern laboratory in the oncological field as means for the characterization of the \"nature\" of neoplasms and related therapeutic approaches. Therefore, even if Moscati was rarely mentioned by the sources of the history of medicine, it is safe to assume that the fame of the Saint has paradoxically eclipsed that of the scientist, preventing him from receiving the necessary reward.\n\nBiocompatibility, endocytosis, and intracellular trafficking of mesoporous silica and polystyrene nanoparticles in ovarian cancer cells: effects of size and surface charge groups\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEkkapongpisit M\n\n2012-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Maneerat Ekkapongpisit,1 Antonino Giovia,1 Carlo Follo,1 Giuseppe Caputo,2,3 Ciro Isidoro11Laboratory of Molecular Pathology and Nanobioimaging, Department of Health Sciences, UniversitÃ del Piemonte Orientale âA Avogadroâ, Novara, 2Dipartimento di Chimica dellâUniversitÃ di Torino, Torino, 3Cyanine Technology SpA, Torino, ItalyBackground and methods: Nanoparticles engineered to carry both a chemotherapeutic drug and a sensitive imaging probe are valid tools for early detection of cancer cells and to monitor the cytotoxic effects of anticancer treatment simultaneously. Here we report on the effect of size (10â30 nm versus 50 nm, type of material (mesoporous silica versus polystyrene, and surface charge functionalization (none, amine groups, or carboxyl groups on biocompatibility, uptake, compartmentalization, and intracellular retention of fluorescently labeled nanoparticles in cultured human ovarian cancer cells. We also investigated the involvement of caveolae in the mechanism of uptake of nanoparticles.Results: We found that mesoporous silica nanoparticles entered via caveolae-mediated endocytosis and reached the lysosomes; however, while the 50 nm nanoparticles permanently resided within these organelles, the 10 nm nanoparticles soon relocated in the cytoplasm. Naked 10 nm mesoporous silica nanoparticles showed the highest and 50 nm carboxyl-modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles the lowest uptake rates, respectively. Polystyrene nanoparticle uptake also occurred via a caveolae-independent pathway, and was negatively affected by serum. The 30 nm carboxyl-modified polystyrene nanoparticles did not localize in lysosomes and were not toxic, while the 50 nm amine-modified polystyrene nanoparticles accumulated within lysosomes and eventually caused cell death. Ovarian cancer cells expressing caveolin-1 were more likely to endocytose these nanoparticles.Conclusion: These data highlight the importance of considering both the\n\nRendiconti finanziari e struttura di governo del Seminario di Siena in S.

Su premisa bÃ¡sica es la idea que hay muchas correlaciones e interdependencias entre los diferentes aspectos de la cultura de un pueblo, por lo que los cambios en uno de ellos pueden causar cambios en todos los demÃ¡s. Entonces, no se puede pensar la cultura religiosa de una comunidad como distante desde la econÃ³mica y cientÃ­fica, porque cada uno de ellas tiene el ser humano como elemento central y original. Por otra parte, la dimensiÃ³n religiosa es tan penetrante en el alma humana, que se puede considerar como algo que caracteriza una comunidad. En esta perspectiva, es muy importante la misiÃ³n sacerdotal que requiere una formaciÃ³n especÃ­fica que se puede adquirir a travÃ©s de cursos de estudio impartidos en los âseminariosâ. Estas entidades eclesiÃ¡sticas constituyen nuestro objeto de estudio, con especial referencia a lo que, hasta hoy, ha operado en la DiÃ³cesis de Siena.

The use of handheld devices for rapid mapping, both image- and range-based, can help the production of suitable easy-to use and easy-navigable 3D model for documentation projects. These types of reality-based modelling could support, with their tailored integrated geometric and radiometric aspects, valorisation and communication projects including virtual reconstructions, interactive navigation settings, immersive reality for dissemination purposes and evoking past places and atmospheres. The aim of this research is localized within the âTorino 1911â project, led by the University of San Diego (California in cooperation with the PoliTo. The entire project is conceived for multi-scale reconstruction of the real and no longer existing structures in the whole park space of more than 400,000âm2, for a virtual and immersive visualization of the Turin 1911 International âFabulous Expositionâ event, settled in the Valentino Park. Particularly, in the presented research, a 3D metric documentation workflow is proposed and validated in order to integrate the potentialities of LiDAR mapping by handheld SLAM-based device, the ZEB REVO Real Time instrument by GeoSLAM (2017 release, instead of TLS consolidated systems. Starting from these kind of models, the crucial aspects of the trajectories performances in the 3D reconstruction and the radiometric content from imaging approaches are considered, specifically by means of compared use of common DSLR cameras and portable sensors.\n\nHyperfast Numerical Integration of Ocean Surface Wave Dynamics Extensions to Higher Order\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2008-09-30\n\nOsborne Dipartimento di Fisica Generale, UniversitÃ di Torino Via Pietro Giuria 1 10125 Torino, Italy Phone: (+39) 11-670-7451 or (+39) 11-329...Universit?i Torino,Dipartimento di Fisica Generale,Via Pietro Giuria 1,10125 Torino, Italy, , 8.

Otello forms the âthird wayâ of Verdi in which the sung word reaches a summit in doing justice to the written text, anticipating what would later be refined by âverismâ. The struggle between the falsified infidelity and the amorous sentiments of the Moor of Venice provide elements that are summarised in eloquent lyricism and profound musical emotion. Zeffirelliâs Otello is a lofty concatenation of talents that affords the poetic essence and drama of the story a focused significance. Melodic nobility, singing, scenery, complemented by a constant flow of ideas, nuances, effects and hues are all there.\n\nHandbook of graph drawing and visualization\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nTamassia, Roberto\n\n2013-01-01\n\nPlanarity Testing and Embedding Maurizio PatrignaniCrossings and Planarization Christoph Buchheim, Markus Chimani, Carsten Gutwenger, Michael JÃ¼nger, and Petra MutzelSymmetric Graph Drawing Peter Eades and Seok-Hee HongProximity Drawings Giuseppe LiottaTree Drawing Algorithms Adrian RusuPlanar Straight-Line Drawing Algorithms Luca VismaraPlanar Orthogonal and Polyline Drawing Algorithms Christian A.

Yet the quantum description of the gravitational field remains elusive. The year 2005 marks the tenth anniversary of the First Meeting on Constrained Dynamics and Quantum Gravity, held in Dubna (Russia) due to the efforts of Alexandre T. Filippov (JINR, Dubna) and Vittorio de Alfaro (University of Torino, Italy). At the heart of this initiative was the desire for an international forum where the status and perspectives of research in quantum gravity could be discussed from the broader viewpoint of modern gauge field theories. Since the Dubna meeting, an increasing number of scientists has joined this quest. Progress was reported in two other conferences in this series: in Santa Margherita Ligure (Italy) in 1996 and in Villasimius (Sardinia, Italy) in 1999. After a few years of ``working silence'' the time was now mature for a new gathering. The Fourth Meeting on Constrained Dynamics and Quantum Gravity (QG05) was held in Cala Gonone (Sardinia, Italy) from Monday 12th to Friday 16th September 2005. Surrounded by beautiful scenery, 100 scientists from 23 countries working in field theory, general relativity and related areas discussed the latest developments in the quantum treatment of gravitational systems. The QG05 edition covered many of the issues that had been addressed in the previous meetings and new interesting developments in the field, such as brane world models, large extra dimensions, analogue models of gravity, non-commutative techniques etc. The format of the meeting was similar to the previous ones. The programme consisted of invited plenary talks and parallel sessions on cosmology, quantum gravity, strings and phenomenology, gauge theories and quantisation and black holes. A major goal was to bring together senior s"
