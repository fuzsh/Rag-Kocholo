The law which provides that the government should compensate for unjust detentions could then function in the direction of protecting the right to reunion and demonstration, they argue.\n\n1650 detentions in one year\n\nAccording to a recent report by MAZLUMDER since the adoption of the Seventh reform Package on July 30, 2003, 1650 people were detained in a year during meetings and demonstrations.\n\nIn the first seven months of 2004, including those 450 during the July NATO summit in Istanbul, 1200 people were detained, the report says.\n\nAccording to the report, only a few detainees had legal investigation for their cases: ³Although there are legal changes, the enforcement of the law has worsened, and this shows that amendments are not enough to protect personal rights and liberties.²\n\nWays to guarantee the rights\n\nThe right to reunion and demonstration could be protected by legal and administrative sanctions, MAZLUMDER belives. For this reason ³indemnity law that provides compensation to illegally arrested persons,² gains importance, they say.\n\nThe MAZLUMDER report mentions that Seyma Doguncu, who was tried and acquitted by the 2. Uskudar Criminal Court for violating law 2911, won her case for indemnity: ³This law is important for preventing violations of civil rights related to reunion and demonstration.³The law is fine but there are problems with the implementation.²\n\nMAZLUMDER¹s report said, ³Albeit permission is not necessary for enjoying the right to organize reunion and demonstration, this principle is abrogated in application.²\n\nMAZLUMDER, also criticizes a provision of the law that requires ³the mayor to determine the place and the route of reunion and demonstration.²\n\n³The main purpose of reunion and demonstration is to give a message to the public and the determination of its place by the authorities contradicts with the aim of the right, leading to its isolation from the public.²\n\nCitizens are not potential criminals\n\nThe report points to the fact that officials are inclined to interpret the requirement for an advance notice to inform the date and place of the reunion and demonstration as ³an application for taking-giving permission² whereas the purpose is to provide public security for the participants in the event.\n\n³The necessary security measures, contrary to the purpose of the law, are interpreted as seeing the organizers as potential criminals and thus leading to cancellation or postponement of some events.²\n\nMAZLUMDER report, relying on sample cases, displays that difficulties and violations become more frequent in some regions during certain periods in the implementation of the right to reunion and demonstration. (BIA News Center, July 29, 2004)\n\nTOHAV report: There is increase in number of women victims of torture\n\nFoundation for Social and Legal Research (TOHAV) of Turkey has released its report on torture treatments of the year 2003. The report exhibits striking results including increase in number of women victims of torture and that all of illiterate victims also didn't speak Turkish. Ages of the applicants range from 11 to 80. The most common torture methods are; feces in food, electroshocks, hanging from ankles and wrists, Palestinian hanger and sexual assault.\n\nTOHAV have announced its research on \"people exposed to violence by state officers in 2003.\" The report by Torture Rehabilitation Centre (IRM) of TOHAV states 197 victims of torture applied them last year and the total number of victims under rehabilitation reached 314 by that.\n\nAge ranges from 11 to 80\n\nOut of 197 new applicants, the oldest is 80 and the youngest is 11 years old. Majority of the applications are made in June and most of them involve acute complications. The striking point in the report is the radical increase in number of female applicants of torture with a percent of 74. Age average of women applicants is 34,1. Majority of the total applicants are between 20 and 35 ages. 63,9% of them are single, 34,5% are married and 1,5% are widows/widowers.\n\nLevel of education\n\n40.6% are elementary school graduates, 15.7% are high school graduates, 11.6% of illiterate applicants don't speak Turkish and most of the ones tortured for demanding education in mother tongue are women. 43.1 are unemployed and 21.8 of them work in mainly temporary jobs for wages below hunger limit, without insurance, union rights. 87.7% of the total number is unemployed. 90.8 of them have no social insurance and 97.4 of them have low income.\n\nSecurity directorate comes first in torture\n\nThe ones who applied to TOHAV within a week following torture under custody, report they confronted new torture methods such as; isolation from outside stimulants in a cell, deprivation of primary needs, assault, degrading, sexual harassment, being deprived of sleep, pretending execution.\n\n\"134 brought before court in 2003; 117 of them were detained, 95 of them received a sentence and 114 exposed torture treatment under detention. 84.2% of the victims report being tortured at security directorates, 6.5% at police stations, 4% at gendarme headquarters and 5% at the secret Gendarme Intelligence Center (JITEM).\"\n\n5% of torture victims received treatment\n\nGiving information to DIHA about the report, a doctor from Rehabilitation Center of TOHAV, Veysi Ulgen noted psychological methods of torture increased and put their aim to help the victims get rid of psychological and chronic effects of torture and help them regain their health before torture. Claiming that systematic torture was still applied in Turkey, Ulgen said victims of torture didn't only have problems related to health but that they had political, social and judicial problems.\n\n\"We don't know much about other problems of the victims since we deal only with the medical ones. Moreover, this is the number of the ones who could apply to us. There are many others victims of torture on streets. For example, 10 years ago, only 5% of the torture victims applied for aid. Many of them still suffer from its effects\" said Ulgen.\n\nVictims don't trust health institutions\n\nComplaining about the very limited number of institutions to help rehabilitation of torture victims, Ulgen also said many of them didn2t trust in health institutions.\n\n\"Self-hood of people is destructed by torture. We define them as victims. We try to gain their trust. I think have noted success in that to a per cent of 80.\" Ulgen lastly called on all sensitive doctors and psychologists to join institutions helping torture victims as volunteers. (DIHA, July 27, 2004)\n\nWomen Urge for Municipal \"Shelter\"\n\nMembers and leaders of \"Van Women's Association\" petitioned to the remote southeast city of Van Municipality urging that violence against women stopped and a center for shelter and consultation opened.\n\nAccording to international standards, for every 7,500 persons there should exist one women's shelter. This sums up at least to 8,000 shelters for the women of Turkey whereas there exist only 9,\" explain the group of 17 activists.\n\nThe \"association\" points to the fact that women are forced to commit suicide and murdered under accusations of acting against the traditional codes of honor. The group recalled the case of Nemciye Aralin who was burned to death by her husband in Van's Ozalp village last week.\n\nVan Women's Association urge that\n\n* All municipalities in Turkey should open shelters and the municipality of Van should take the necessary steps,\n\n* Precaution should be taken for all shelters that are open and that will be opened,\n\n* Shelters should function along the guidelines of confidentiality and provide security and psychological support,\n\n* Shelters should remain under the supervision of women's organizations who should be endowed with a say in their management. (BIA, July 27, 2004)\n\n116e mort dans les prisons de type F\n\nLe 21 juillet dernier, un prisonnier politique sympathisant du DHKP-C, Salih Sevinel, est décédé à l'hôpital après une longue incarcération en cellule d'isolement dans la prison de type F de Tekirdag.\n\nPourquoi et comment Salih a perdu la vie? Officellement, il est mort de \"crise cardiaque\".\n\nToutefois, un communiqué de presse du DHKP-C du 29 juillet 2004 explique les raisons de cette 116e mort dans les prisons de type F dans son contexte carcéral:\n\n\"Cela explique-t-il quoi que ce soit? Ne va-t-on pas s'interroger sur les raisons de cette attaque cardiaque, lui qui, avant de tomber en captivité était en bonne santé? Il faut qu'une enquête soit menée. Mais cette enquête concernant une personne en pleine forme qui succombe ainsi en captivité nécessite un questionnement non seulement de type médical mais aussi et surtout politique.\n\n\"Quelle est donc cette politique qui détruit le système cérébral, cardiaque et rénal d'un prisonnier?\n\n\"Quelle est donc cette politique qui rend sch izophrénique des personnes sains d'esprit et qui pousse des personnes pétillantes de vie et toujours souriantes au suicide?.. Sans répondre à ces questions, on ne peut trouver la véritable raison du décès de Salih Sevinel.\n\n\"Non, Salih Sevinel n'est pas mort de crise cardiaque. Il a été assassiné. C'est la torture de l'isolement qui a eu raison de lui. C'est ce gouvernement qui persiste à maintenir un régime carcéral inhumain, le véritable assassin de Salih Sevinel.\n\n\"L'isolement est un mode d'extermination qui vise à détruire la santé psychique et physique du détenu. L'isolement, c'est la déshumanisation de l'individu. L'isolement, c'est l'interdiction de défendre ses opinions, mais aussi d'avoir des sentiments, de partager et de cultiver la solidarité.\n\n\"Toute personne qui vit dans ce pays et qui porte le titre d'intellectuel, de journaliste, de démocrate, doit voir ceci: le problème n'est pas un dilemme entre 'dortoirs' ou \"chambres\". Le problème se situe bien au-delà. La chose principale que nous devons remettre en question, c'est le régime d'isolement. Car l'isolement est une synthèse \"moderne\" créée par les Etats-Unis et l'Allemagne impérialistes entre la politique médiévale de l'Inquisition et les pratiques nazies du XXe siècle. Il s'agit d'une attaque contre le genre humain. Il s'agit d'une forme de torture qui a un effet permanent et qui peut durer des dizaines d'années.\n\n\"Pensez à tous ces prisonniers qui se sont suicidés en prison de type F: Volkan Agirman ou encore Ali Sahin, soit disant mort de \"cancer\" et tant d'autres encore... Tous ces décès sont le produit de ce régime carcéral.\n\n\"Ceux qui s'opposent à la torture, qui considèrent que la torture est un 'crime contre l'humanité' doivent une fois pour toute se lever contre cette forme de supplice intensifiée et permanente.\n\n\"116 morts! Se taire face à une telle hécatombe nous fait tous les jours perdre un peu plus notre dignité humaine.\n\n\"Voici les faits tels que son camarade de cellule nous les a relatés. Salih Sevinel aurait souffert d'une crise cardiaque dans l'après-midi du 21 juillet. Instantanément, son camarade de cellule aurait frappé à la porte et aurait crié par la fenêtre pour alerter les gardiens. Les gardiens ont traîné à venir. Ils l'auraient fait marché jusqu'à l'infirmerie alors qu'il venait d'avoir une crise cardiaque... Ils l'ont fait attendre un long moment avant de l'emmener à l'hôpital d'Etat de Tekirdag. Quelques heures plus tard, il perdait la vie.\n\n\"C'est cela, la politique d'isolement. Les individus chargés d'imposer ces conditions de détention sont spécialement formées à ne pas considérer les prisonniers comme des êtres humains. Pour ces gardiens, le prisonnier est un être dont il faut abattre les opinions. Et si le prisonnier insiste à défendre celles-ci, il faut l'abattre physiquement. Tout le fonctionnement de la prison s'articule sur ce principe même da ns les questions qui concernent les premières nécessités comme la nourriture et les vêtements.\n\n\"A ce jour, la politique d'isolement a assassiné 116 personnes. Il s'agit d'un véritable massacre. Entre-temps, Tayyip Erdogan n'a pas hésité à déclarer des mensonges tels que: 'une telle chose n'est pas arrivée sous notre mandat'. Ainsi, la mort de Salih est un décès de plus qui lui éclate à la figure. Combien de temps encore l'AKP va-t-il rejeter la responsabilité des décès en prison de type F?\"\n\nLa Turquie condamnée trois fois par la Cour européenne\n\nLa Cour européenne des droits de l'homme a condamné mardi la Turquie pour avoir poursuivi en justice le traducteur turc d'un rapport de l'organisation américaine de défense des droits de l'Homme Human Rights Watch, et dont tous les exemplaires furent saisis en 1997.\n\nCe rapport, intitulé \"Les transferts d'armes et les violations des lois de guerre en Turquie\", offrait un recueil de témoignages d'anciens militaires ayant participé à des missions dans le sud-est de la Turquie et une analyse de certains faits de violations de droits de l'Homme dans la région.\n\nA la suite de la publication de ce rapport en mai 1996, le traducteur, Ertugrul Kürkçü, et le propriétaire de la maison d'éditions \"Belge\" ayant publié l'ouvrage, furent inculpés pour avoir \"outragé et vilipendé les forces militaires de l'Etat\", rappelle la Cour dans son arrêt.\n\nTous deux furent condamnés à dix mois d'emprisonnement en 1997 par la cour d'assises d'Istanbul qui décida toutefois de convertir la peine de l'éditeur en une amende et de surseoir à l'exécution de celle du M. Kürkçü. Elle ordonna en outre la saisie de tous les exemplaires du rapport.\n\nSaisie par M. Kürkçü, la Cour européenne a estimé que la condamnation du requérant était \"disproportionnée aux buts visés et, dès lors, non +nécessaire dans une société démocratique+\".\n\n\"Il ne s'agit pas d'un discours de haine, ce qui est aux yeux de la Cour l'élément essentiel à prendre en considération\", ajoute la Cour, qui a jugé que la Turquie avait violé l'article 10 (liberté d'expression) de la Convention européenne des droits de l'homme et alloué 3.000 euros pour dommage moral au requérant.\n\nAnkara condamnée également pour des décès suspects et des tortures au Kurdistan\n\nToujours mardi, la Turquie a été condamnée deux fois de plus par la Cour européenne des droits de l'Homme, suite au décès en 1993 d'un militant présumé du PKK, tué par balles au lendemain de son arrestation, et pour des tortures infligées à un autre militant Kurde lors de sa garde à vue.\n\nLe décès, le 23 novembre 1993, de Mehmet Sah Ikincisoy, tué d'une balle dans le dos \"dans des circonstances engageant la responsabilité de la Turquie, sans que rien ne démontre que cette atteinte à la vie ait été rendue nécessaire\", constitue une \"violation du droit à la vie\", ont estimé les juges des droits de l'Homme.\n\nLe père et le frère de la victime, aujourd'hui âgés de 71 et 30 ans, recevront 36.000 euros au total pour dommage moral et 15.000 pour frais et dépens.\n\nLes deux requérants avaient été arrêtés le 22 novembre 1993, en même temps que Mehmet Sah Ikincisoy. Remis en liberté après respectivement trois et onze jours de garde à vue, ils avaient été informés que leur fils et frère avait été tué le 25 novembre lors d'une fusillade avec les forces de l'ordre et qu'il avait déjà été inhumé. Malgré leurs demandes répétées, les requérants n'avaient jamais pu obtenir la restitution du corps de leur parent.\n\nPar ailleurs les juges européens ont également condamné mardi la Turquie pour \"tortures\" dans une autre affaire, concernant un membre présumé du PKK mort en août 1994 pendant sa garde à vue.\n\nSelon la Cour, rien ne permet d'affirmer que le gardé à vue est mort de suites de torture, et non pas en se suicidant par pendaison comme l'affirment les autorités. Toutefois, au vu des traces de coups relevées sur le corps du défunt, la Cour relève que \"l'Etat turc porte la responsabilité des blessures constatées\".\n\nLes quatre membres de la famille qui avaient déposé la requête recevront conjointement 25.000 euros pour dommage moral.

On 17 February, they were sent to the psychologists who asked them \"why they did not stay in a ward for independent political prisoners\" and warned them \"to stand up during counts\".\n\nThe prisoners also told that they had to write petitions for every need, the pills were given one by one; they even could not get the hand crème by the advice of the doctor. They stated that the limitations for clothes was continued, hot water was supplied for a very short time, almost every activity of the prisoners were subjected to disciplinary sentences, the one month sentences given by the execution judgeship was converted to 6 months' ban on receiving visitors and phone calls by the prison administration.\n\nAccording to the minute, the prisoners put that there were convicts who were banned from receiving letters for two months and visitors and phone calls for a year.

They had been sentenced to 11 months and 20 days' imprisonment for torturing under the Article 243 TPC and the sentences had been suspended.\n\nThe decision of quash was given on the grounds that the sentences were not proper and the sentences had to be given 14 times (the number of tortured persons).\n\nThe court approved the acquittal of Sahin Kaplan, who had been identified by victims during a hearing in February 2000 and against whom a case had been launched with an additional indictment.\n\nThe court also quashed the acquittal decisions on Zülfikar Özdemir, Saban Toz, Bülent Duramanoglu and Necip Tükenmez on the grounds of lapse of time. The court ruled that the cases against these defendants had to be dropped without retrial.\n\nSub-plaintiff Keles Öztürk said the followings on the decision: \"Although the court quashed the decision on 6 September the case would be dropped because of lapse of time after 7,5 years of trial. Torture cases are tried to be endured long time to drop them due to lapse of time. This is an example of this attitude. Court of Cassation also has responsibility. The court gave its decision in one and half years after the verdict of Heavy Penal Court. So the case faces the danger of lapse of time.\" (Radikal-TIHV, July 25, 2004)\n\nUn groupe de prisonniers politiques entamera le jeûne de la mort\n\nLe 20 juillet, un prisonnier politique est décédé à cause d'une crise cardiaque dans la prison type-F de Tekirdag.

Associations could engage in international activities like opening branches or representation offices abroad. Foreign associations could work in Turkey with permission by the Ministry of Interior. Internal auditing will be the rule. However if needed the ministry of interior or territorial administration may audit themselves without employing any security forces.
