        "text": "ISTANBUL -- Backed by a court order, Turkish authorities moved Friday to seize Zaman, the country's most widely circulated newspaper, in the latest crackdown by the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on freedom of the press.\n\nThe seizing of the newspaper also highlighted the government's building campaign against those it perceives to be its two greatest enemies: opposition journalists and the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric affiliated with the newspaper who lives in exile in Pennsylvania. Gulen was once an ally of Erdogan's but is now a bitter enemy.\n\nThe European Union is facing increasing pressure to speak out against the erosion of media freedom in Turkey, but few expect it to take a bold stance toward Ankara while trying to assure its help in dealing with the migration crisis.\n\nAs news of the takeover became public Friday afternoon, supporters began gathering in front of the newspaper's offices in Istanbul, and employees locked a door to the building. In a live-stream broadcast on the newspaper's website, supporters were seen chanting, \"Free press cannot be silenced.\" Some carried Turkish flags and banners emblazoned with, \"Do not touch my newspaper.\" Columnists from the paper also were seen addressing the crowd.\n\nFriday night, Turkish police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse the crowd and forcibly enter the building.\n\nSome protesters were seen rubbing their faces with pieces of lemon to mitigate the effects of the tear gas, the private Dogan news agency reported. Some protesters were injured.\n\nThe Saturday edition of the English-language Today's Zaman, published before the forced takeover, printed its entire front page in black with the headline: \"Shameful day for free press in Turkey.\"\n\n\"We are going through the darkest and gloomiest days in terms of freedom of the press, which is a major benchmark for democracy and the rule of law,\" read a statement issued by the editors of Today's Zaman, a sister publication to Zaman. \"Intellectuals, businesspeople, celebrities, civil society organizations, media organizations and journalists are being silenced via threats and blackmail.\"\n\nZaman's seizure was part of an intensified crackdown on Gulen's movement, which the government claims is attempting to topple it. Authorities accuse the movement's followers of infiltrating police and the judiciary and of orchestrating corruption allegations in 2013 that implicated Erdogan's inner circle, as part of their bid to bring down the government.\n\nThe movement also has been branded a terrorist organization although it is not known to have carried out any acts of violence.\n\nPrime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, speaking to Turkish reporters during a visit to Iran, insisted that the appointment of trustee managers was a legal decision, not a political one and denied any government involvement in the move.\n\n\"We did not interfere ... nor would we interfere\" Davutoglu said, adding that he was concerned that the issue would infringe on the \"positive agenda\" of Monday's Turkey-EU summit.\n\nThe move to seize Zaman and put it under the administration of a court-appointed panel of trustees emphasized what critics say is a rapid deterioration of free-speech rights under the Islamist government of Erdogan, who was prime minister for more than a decade before being elected president in 2014.\n\n\"This pattern is appalling, and Turkey is galloping towards an authoritarian regime full speed ahead,\" said Asli Aydintasbas, a prominent journalist who lost her column last year at the daily Milliyet under government pressure. \"Unfortunately, the world, in particular the EU, remains silent. The government here can sense the vulnerability in the West, especially since the beginning of the refugee crisis, and is pushing the boundaries to consolidate its power.\"\n\nRights groups accuse EU nations of keeping mute about deteriorating freedoms and human-rights abuses in Turkey -- including the large civilian death toll during military operations against Kurdish militants -- because of the country's crucial role in curtailing the flow of migrants to Europe.\n\n\"The European Union and the United States, as Turkey's partners and allies, should not trade Turkey's support on migration and Syria for silence over the dismantling of democratic institutions,\" said Daniel Calingaert, executive vice president of the U.S.-based watchdog, Freedom House, following Zaman's takeover.\n\nThe European Federation of Journalists said: \"The European Union cannot remain silent to the political seizure of Zaman newspaper, Today's Zaman daily and Cihan news agency.\"\n\nBut the EU commissioner for enlargement, Johannes Hahn, said on Twitter that he was \"extremely worried\" by the development.\n\n\"Turkey, as a candidate country, needs to respect freedom of the media,\" Hahn said.\n\nEuropean Parliament President Martin Schultz said he intends to raise the issue with Davutoglu in Brussels.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Safak Timur and Tim Arango of The New York Times and by Suzan Fraser of The Associated Press.\n\nA Section on 03/06/2016"
