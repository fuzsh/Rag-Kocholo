        "text": "Riot police have fired rubber bullets and tear gas into crowds of demonstrators protesting against the forced take-over of Turkey's largest-circulation newspaper - described as one of the 'darkest days' in the history of the country's press.\n\nOfficers stormed the headquarters of Zaman daily newspaper last night and enforced the court-ordered seizure of the publication, which is linked to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's top foe, U.S.-based opposition cleric Fethullah Gulen.\n\nThe paper's defiant journalists were able to publish an edition today despite the takeover, as police used rubber bullets, tear has and water cannon to break up some 500 protesters outside their Istanbul offices.\n\n'The Constitution is suspended,' the newspaper said on its front page in large font on a black background.\n\nIt added: 'Yesterday (Friday) marked one of the darkest days in the history of Turkish press.'\n\nToday's edition of English-language Today's Zaman, printed its entire front page in black with the headline: 'Shameful day for free press in Turkey.'\n\nZaman, with an estimated circulation of 650,000, went to print earlier than usual on Friday evening before the police raid and the number of pages was reduced to 16 from 24, one of its journalists said.\n\nDuring Friday's raid, police first cleared protesters, then used bolt-cutters to open the gates before dozens of officers marched in to take over the building and formally place the newspaper under administration.\n\nOnce the building was cleared, court-appointed administrators were bussed inside the complex to begin their work, local media reported.\n\nThe new administrators fired Zaman's editor-in-chief Abdulhamit Bilici today, according to reports.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of the paper's supporters staged a second-day of protests outside the building, now surrounded by police fences.\n\nThey chanted 'free press cannot be silenced' and 'Zaman cannot be silenced' as riot police used shields and tear gas to push the crowd, sending protesters running into side streets for protection.\n\nSome were seen rubbing their faces with pieces of lemon to mitigate the effect of the tear gas, the private Dogan news agency reported. A number of protesters were hurt, the agency added.\n\nSevgi Akarcesme, the editor-in-chief of the paper's English language edition Today's Zaman, said on Twitter today that the internet connection had been cut in the building.\n\n'We are not able to work anymore,' she wrote.\n\nThe late-night seizure raised fresh concerns over declining media freedom in Turkey, a key European Union ally, ahead of a visit by Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu to Brussels on Monday for a crucial summit meeting with EU leaders.\n\nThe raid prompted a worried response from the EU, which urged Ankara to respect media freedom.\n\n'The EU has repeatedly stressed that Turkey, as (an EU) candidate country, needs to respect and promote high democratic standards and practices, including freedom of the media,' the EU's diplomatic service said in a statement.\n\nWashington also urged Turkey to protect freedom of speech, saying the court order was 'the latest in a series of troubling judicial and law enforcement actions taken by the Turkish government targeting media outlets and others critical of it.'\n\nThe Istanbul court's appointment of trustees to manage Zaman and its sister outlets further reduced the number of opposition media organisations in Turkey, which is dominated by pro-government news outlets and where censorship is rife.\n\nIt raised alarm bells over the deterioration of rights conditions in the NATO member nation, which also aspires for EU membership, just days before a March 7 meeting, in which EU leaders will try to convince Turkey to do more to curtail the flow of migrants travelling to Europe.\n\nEmma Sinclair-Webb, senior Turkey researcher for Human Rights Watch, called the court order 'a veiled move by the president to eradicate opposition media and scrutiny of government policies'.\n\nAnkara accuses Gulen of running what it calls the Fethullahci Terror Organisation/Parallel State Structure (FeTO/PDY) and seeking to overthrow the legitimate Turkish authorities.\n\nLocal media said the court order was issued on the grounds that Zaman supported the activities of this 'terror organisation', although it is not known to have carried out any acts of violence.\n\nGulen has been based in the United States since 1999 when he fled charges against him laid by the former secular authorities.\n\nDespite living outside of Turkey, Gulen has built up huge influence in the country through allies in the police and judiciary, media and financial interests and a vast network of private schools.\n\nThere have been numerous legal crackdowns on structures linked to the group and yesterday Turkish police arrested four executives of one of the country's largest conglomerates, accusing them of financing Gulen.\n\nThe daily Cumhuriyet newspaper's editor-in-chief Can Dundar and Ankara bureau chief Erdem Gul were released on an order from Turkey's top court last week after three months in jail on charges of publishing state secrets. But they still face trial on March 25.\n\nThe Zaman seizure is the latest incident to raise concerns about freedom of expression in Turkey under Erdogan's rule.\n\nPrime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, speaking to Turkish reporters during a visit to Iran, insisted that the appointment of trustee managers was a legal decision, not a political one, and denied any government involvement in the move.\n\n'We did not interfere... nor would be interfere' Davutoglu said, adding that he was concerned that the issue would infringe on the 'positive agenda' of Monday's Turkey-EU summit.\n\nThe European Federation of Journalists said: 'The European Union cannot remain silent to the political seizure of Zaman newspaper, Today's Zaman daily and Cihan news agency.'\n\nThe EU commissioner for enlargement, Johannes Hahn, said on Twitter that he was 'extremely worried' by the development."
