        "text": "Turkey has a growing strategic role in its overlapping neighbourhood with the EU. Recent developments in the southern and eastern European neighbourhood have led to a new perception of the European Neighbourhood Policy. Turkey –on the one hand negotiating for EU membership, while, on the other, an important regional player in the common neighbourhood (the Caucasus and Mediterranean)– is increasingly being perceived as a crucial geopolitical partner for the EU. Turkey’s role in relation to the EU’s existing initiatives –such as the Union for the Mediterranean, the Eastern Partnership and the Black Sea Synergy– and its own Caucasus Stability and Cooperation Platform represents a challenge for the future shape of the European neighbourhood. This ARI outlines Turkey&#39;s relevance to a successful outcome of the EU’s initiatives, its role for political stability on the EU’s borders and the possibilities for cooperation or synergies between the Turkish and EU initiatives.\n\nTurkey-EU relations are currently in a state of flux. Turkey and the EU have moved apart in their political aspirations after accession talks faced a stalemate due to the Republic of Cyprus’ EU accession as a divided island. The EU has been shaken to its very core by the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and as a result the enlargement of the EU has dropped down the agenda. In contrast Turkey has become an economic powerhouse in an extremely volatile region. The Turkish government has been following a consistent policy of establishing itself as the leader in its region and as a result a significant part of the Turkish population no longer sees EU accession as the only option to secure long-term economic growth and political stability. The book explores the current challenges as well as opportunities facing the Turkey-EU relations, questioning the existing models in light of recent developments. The book is interdisciplinary in nature bringing together perspectives from the disciplines of international relations, political science and law. The book analyses current shifts in the dynamics of Turkey-EU relations in order to surmise what the future of this relationship might hold. The book focuses on four main themes: the effect of the Cyprus conflict; the potential for a structured Turkey-EU cooperation particularly with regard to the Middle Eastern region in the wake of the Arab Spring; the future of democratic reform in Turkey under fading EU influence; and finally, the changing role of Europe in Turkish political discourse as well as the daily lives of Turkish citizens.\n\nTurkey has aspired to become a member of the EU since 1959 and has managed to accomplish several significant milestones toward that goal. However, the accession talks are progressing rather slowly and Turkey still seems to be far away from full membership. The authors argue that obstacles delaying the process can be summarized into two primary categories: cultural differences, which are often reduced to the notion of religion, and impediments linked to the Cyprus problem. The paper will assert that without a settlement of the problem on the Mediterranean island, Turkey’s membership prospects are likely to remain uncertain. Following this line of reasoning, it will be claimed that a strategic vision of the EU can bring an end to the existing conundrum in the accession talks. Such an active move forward is in the interest of the EU, especially as Turkey becomes a more active player in the arena of international relations. Some indicators show a change in that direction, such as Lady Ashton’s comment in her capacity as High Representative: “We welcome the increasingly important role of Turkey in the region. In this context we will also look at the ways in which the EU and Turkey can enhance cooperation.” The issues that the EU tries to tackle are within the problemsolving vision of Turkey. Therefore it will be argued that if Turkey firmly establishes itself as a major regional player, it would likely play a crucial role in the success of the EU’s foreign policy, if admitted to the EU.\n\nTurkey and the European Union are facing several crises that have turned both into more fragile and unpredictable international actors. This policy paper on Europe and Turkey and the road ahead highlights the salience of thinking afresh about the nature and conduct of the relationship between the European Union and Turkey. Based upon an inductive stock-taking of the current state of the European Union as well as the likely scenario of where it is headed in the near to mid term, this paper points out how the EU’s evolution is likely to impact Turkey and Turkish policy options in a number of geographical and topical areas. At the same time, the paper contemplates the areas in which EU-Turkey relations might improve or might take a further turn for the worse."
