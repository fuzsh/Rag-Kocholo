        "text": "This research, “A Case Study From Turkey On Autism”, mainly focuses on the purpose of enlightening the perception of autism in Turkey. At the core of this research lies a case study from Turkey and a study of organizations and institutions in Turkey related to diagnosis and treatment of autism. Thus, the research on this subject is constituted from three parts: in the first part, what autism is in general, how it was first identified and how it is diagnosed are examined, and the perception of autism in Turkey and the evolution of the approaches to the subject are explained. “Marginality” and “Abnormality” concepts are also briefly presented, and autism in Turkey is discussed using the tools of these theories. In the second part, are the research methods and techniques. In the third part, based on a case study conducted in Turkey, reflections of autism on the culture is studied and presented. Bibliography on the subject, both in Turkish and in various foreign languages, is also included. At the base of the research lies the concept that, although autism is a universal psychic problem, it reflects differently in different cultural and social media, although its reflections may still be similar. As a result, autism is still considered as a developmental disorder whose treatment is yet to be discovered. The main purpose of this research is to enlighten the point reached in the social perception of autism in Turkey, with the help of a contemporary case study."
