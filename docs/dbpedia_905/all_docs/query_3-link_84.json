        "text": "One of the Taliban’s main goals since seizing power in August 2021 has been to transform Afghanistan’s education system.\n\nSince October, that task has fallen to Nida Mohammad Nadim, a hard-line cleric who was appointed as the minister for higher education.\n\nA former governor and military commander, Nadim has vowed to root out all forms of the modern secular education that thrived in Afghanistan after the U.S.-led invasion in 2001 toppled the Taliban’s first regime. He has also voiced his opposition to education for girls and women, calling it un-Islamic and against Afghan values.\n\nHis comments have sparked controversies and fueled speculation that the Taliban is planning to further restrict female education.\n\nThe militants have already banned girls from attending high school and imposed gender segregation and a new dress code at universities. They have also banned women from applying for many university courses.\n\nThe Taliban has also vowed to overhaul the national curriculum and unveiled plans to build a vast network of madrasahs, or religious seminaries, across the country’s 34 provinces.\n\n'Debauchery And Obscenity'\n\nSince his appointment, Nadim has scrapped all of the rules and bylaws of the ministry tasked with regulating and overseeing public universities in Afghanistan. He has also appointed Taliban fighters as officials and teachers at universities, despite their lack of qualifications.\n\nIn a speech on December 4 in the western city of Herat, Nadim said that it would be “disrespectful” for members of the Taliban to take exams to determine their academic qualifications. He insisted that a Taliban fighter’s credentials were based on the “number of bombs” he had detonated.\n\nLast month, Nadim also blasted Amanullah Khan, Afghanistan’s former reformist king who is widely regarded as a national hero for regaining the country’s independence from Britain in the early 20th century and his efforts to modernize Afghanistan.\n\nNadim accused the monarch of “bringing a recipe for debauchery and obscenity from foreign lands” by promoting female education in the 1920s. The Taliban official claimed that “education for women clashed with Islam and Afghan values.”\n\n'A Bad Omen'\n\nObservers said that Nadim’s appointment and rise within the Taliban suggest that the militant group is planning to impose a blanket ban on female education like during its first stint in power from 1996 to 2001.\n\n“His appointment to the higher education ministry is a bad omen,” said a Kabul-based analyst who spoke to RFE/RL on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nNadim was appointed by the Taliban’s supreme leader, Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada, who has the final say under the clerically led system. Observers say that Akhundzada is steering the Taliban in an even more hard-line direction.\n\nThe Kabul-based analyst said Nadim is a member of a council of Taliban clerics who have advised Akhundzada since the group seized power last year.\n\nSami Yousafzai, a veteran Afghan journalist and commentator who has tracked the Taliban since its emergence in the 1990s, said Nadim has endeared himself to Akhundzada by implementing his orders and vision.\n\n“He acts like a good soldier and obeys orders,” Yousafzai said. “He just wants to please the hard-line Taliban leaders pushing for a complete ban on women’s education.”\n\nIn a dramatic, last-minute decision, the Taliban backtracked on its pledge to reopen high schools for girls in Afghanistan in March, highlighting the divisions within the group. Observers said Akhundzada likely made the U-turn to appease Taliban ultraconservatives who are vehemently against any form of female education.\n\n'Fear Of Their Leaders'\n\nNadim, who is believed to be in his 40s, established a madrasah in the southern province of Kandahar after the U.S.-led invasion. He later joined the Taliban and became a member of the group’s military commission in Kandahar.\n\nNadim earned the title Sheikh al-Hadith, a distinction reserved for the most eminent scholars of the Prophet Muhammad's sayings.\n\nObservers have said that Nadim’s religious credentials have endeared him to Akhundzada, who has the same title and is respected among the Taliban as a scholar and jurist.\n\nAfter the Taliban takeover, Nadim was appointed as the governor for the eastern province of Nangarhar. Following a reshuffle in February, he gained the coveted governorship of Kabul Province, which includes the capital.\n\nA source with knowledge of the Taliban’s internal politics told RFE/RL that Nadim has aligned himself with powerful ultraconservative clerics close to Akhundzada. They include Abdul Hakim Haqqani, the Taliban’s chief justice, Mohammad Khalid Haqqani, the head of the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, and Education Minister Habibullah Agha.\n\nThe source said Nadim’s predecessor, Abdul Baqi Haqqani, had enraged ultraconservatives by allowing women to attend university.\n\nThe source said Nadim’s opposition to female education has angered some Taliban pragmatists who fear that the group’s restrictions on girls and women will prevent them from gaining international recognition and assistance.\n\n“But they are unable to open their mouths for fear of their leaders,” the source said.\n\nWelcome to The Azadi Briefing, an RFE/RL newsletter that unpacks the key issues in Afghanistan.

Here's what I've been tracking and what I'm keeping an eye on in the days ahead.\n\nThe Key Issue\n\nAfghans have widely criticized a viral video showing two Iranian police officers brutally restraining an Afghan teenager on a road in the capital, Tehran.\n\nThe victim, Mahdi Musavi, 16, is unconscious and under treatment for injuries he sustained when a police officer kneeled on his neck. At the same time, another plainclothes man held him tightly to the ground.\n\n“I do not wish such a day for my enemies,” said Masuma Mohammadi, his mother. “My son suffers from hearing and speech disorders.”\n\nThe video, which first emerged on August 7, is amplifying Afghan fears that their increasing harassment and abuse in Iran is aimed at expelling the more than 4.3 million Afghan refugees and migrants that the UN estimates are currently living in the country.\n\nDuring the past year, Iran expelled some 500,000 Afghans after its government announced a campaign to force undocumented foreigners to leave the country.\n\nWhy It's Important: Negative sentiments against Afghans have been rising in Iran since the growing influx of mostly impoverished Afghans began after the Taliban returned to power three years ago.\n\nIranian officials have consistently blamed Afghan migrants for crimes, unemployment, and other problems.\n\nDuring the past year, Tehran’s campaign to expel undocumented foreigners appears to have affected the treatment of Afghans, with incidents of police brutality and mob violence against them on the rise.\n\nOn August 7, Iran’s semiofficial Mehr News Agency reported that police arrested 50 Afghans in Tehran’s Shahriar county as part of an “emergency plan to gather undocumented Afghans.”\n\nStatements by Iranian officials indicate that an official drive to create conditions to force impoverished Afghans to leave by the end of the year is in full force.\n\nOn August 6, Majid Shuja, the commander of border forces in Iran’s northeastern Razavi Khorasan Province, said his forces have arrested and deported more than 15,000 Afghans to the neighboring Afghan province of Herat so far this year.\n\nAhmad Moqori, a senior law enforcement official in the northwestern East Azerbaijan Province, said Afghans can no longer live in the region even if they have legal documents allowing them to reside there.\n\nEast Azerbaijan is the latest among the growing number of Iran’s 31 provinces where Afghans can no longer live.\n\nWhat's Next: Afghans are often likely to be victims of mob violence and abuse by Iranian law enforcement.\n\nYet widespread poverty and skyrocketing unemployment in Afghanistan is likely to push large numbers of Afghans to continue to look for work in Iran.\n\nWhat To Keep An Eye On\n\nClimate change has displaced more Afghans during the first six months of this year than all of last year.\n\nMore than 38,000 Afghans were forced to leave their homes by the end of June compared to more than 37,000 in all of 2023.\n\nSave the Children, a nongovernmental organization, said its analysis of the preliminary data collected by the International Displacement Monitoring Center shows that landslides, floods, avalanches, storms, droughts, and extreme temperatures are now the leading causes of why Afghans abandon their homes.\n\nSince 1980, over four decades of war have turned Afghans into one of the largest displaced populations globally. But beginning in 2022, more Afghans are now being displaced by natural disasters caused by climate change.\n\n“Afghanistan also had the highest number of children made homeless by climate disasters of any country in the world as of the end of 2023,” said the briefing.\n\nSome 747,094 Afghan children were displaced by the end of last year.\n\nAfghans are South Asia’s largest long-term displaced group and the second-most displaced globally, slightly behind Syrians.\n\nWhy It's Important: Afghanistan is one of the most vulnerable countries to the ravages of climate change.\n\nBut its cash-strapped Taliban government can do little to adapt and mitigate as international development funding disappears.\n\nThat's all from me for now.\n\nDon't forget to send me any questions, comments, or tips that you have. You can always reach us at azadi.english@rferl.org\n\nUntil next time,\n\nAbubakar Siddique\n\nIf you enjoyed this briefing and don't want to miss the next edition, subscribe here.

While tax collection was initially sporadic and uneven across the country, it has been expanded nationwide.\n\nBut the tax have angered many farmers, who say the militant group has not taken into consideration the losses they have incurred.\n\nAfghanistan has been the scene of a series of deadly natural disasters in recent years, including earthquakes, floods, and a severe drought, that have exacerbated the devastating humanitarian crisis in the country, the world's largest.\n\nTaliban Taxes\n\nThe Taliban has imposed a 10 percent tax on harvests from irrigated land and a 5 percent levy on rainfed crops. It has described the payments as an obligation under Islamic law.\n\nThe Taliban has relied heavily on aggressive taxation to raise revenue. The militants have levied taxes on everything from moving goods on highways to hanging a sign in front of a shop.\n\nBut the Taliban government's lack of transparency and the loss of essential services has led to complaints about what Afghans are getting in return.\n\nThe previous Western-backed Afghan government did not impose Islamic taxes, including \"zakat,\" a 2.5 percent levy on the estimated value of a person's possessions that the Taliban has also collected.\n\nZakat is one of the five pillars of Islam that are considered obligations for all Muslims.\n\nDuring its 19-year insurgency, the Taliban collected ushr and zakat from Afghans living under its rule, including farmers who cultivated opium. Tax collection was a major source of revenue for the militants.\n\n'I Have Nothing'\n\nAwalmir is another Afghan farmer who is critical of the Taliban's aggressive tax collection.\n\nAwalmir, who owns a farm outside of Kabul, says he was forced to give the Taliban around 45 kilograms of wheat from his 450-kilogram harvest this year.\n\n\"They made me pay it despite all the losses I had incurred because of torrential spring rains\" that triggered deadly flash floods in parts of Afghanistan, he told Radio Azadi.\n\nAli Reza, a farmer in the northern Sar-e Pul Province, says the Taliban is levying high taxes on impoverished Afghans without providing any basic services to citizens in return.\n\n\"We want the Taliban government to fix our roads, build health-care clinics, and rebuild schools,\" he told Radio Azadi.\n\nQasim, a subsistence farmer in the northeastern province of Badakhshan, said floods in the spring destroyed some of his crops and he will be unable to pay ushr.\n\n\"I have nothing to give them,\" he said.\n\nThe Taliban's Agriculture Ministry did not respond to Radio Azadi's requests for comment.\n\nMost Islamic countries do not impose compulsory Islamic taxes on their citizens. In some countries, citizens can donate zakat, which is meant for the poor and needy.\n\nCritics of governments' collection of zakat include Islamic scholars and aid workers who say that the practice has failed to alleviate poverty in the Muslim world. They argue that the funds are often wasted and mismanaged.\n\nOne Afghan cleric, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, said the Taliban \"is not even authorized\" to collect Islamic taxes.\n\nUnder Islam, he said, Muslims are encouraged to make donations to the poor in their communities. Governments, he said, have no authority to impose and collect Islamic taxes.\n\nWritten by Abubakar Siddique based on reporting by RFE/RL's Radio Azadi.\n\nWelcome to The Azadi Briefing, an RFE/RL newsletter that unpacks the key issues in Afghanistan.

Here's what I've been tracking and what I'm keeping an eye on in the days ahead.\n\nThe Key Issue\n\nA new report by the United Nations says Afghanistan under Taliban rule is turning into a hub for extremist groups.\n\n“Terrorism emanating from Afghanistan will be a driver of insecurity in the region and further afield,” said the report by the UN Security Council committee that monitors the Islamic State (IS) extremist group and the Al-Qaeda terrorist network.\n\nIssued on July 22, the report details how extremist groups with thousands of fighters endanger the security of Afghanistan’s neighbors and pose a growing threat globally.\n\nThe report identified Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), the Afghanistan branch of IS, as the “most serious threat” in the Central and South Asia region and said the group was “projecting terror beyond Afghanistan.”\n\nThe report said Al-Qaeda was adopting “strategic patience” in Afghanistan. Building ties with the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) extremist group that is waging an insurgency against Islamabad, Al-Qaeda could transform the Pakistani militants into a regional threat, the report warned.\n\n“With Taliban acquiescence, and at times support, TTP has intensified attacks inside Pakistan,” the report said, noting that the Pakistani group is estimated to have around 6,500 fighters.\n\nWhy It's Important: Nearly three years after the Taliban’s return to power, there are increasing fears that Afghanistan is once again turning into the headquarters of global terrorism.\n\nThe Taliban has battled against IS-K and claims to have severely curtailed its operations in Afghanistan. But the Taliban’s alliances and relations with other extremist groups, including the TTP, have allowed militancy to flourish in the region.\n\nFor now, fewer Afghans are dying in terrorist attacks than in recent years, according to a new report by the Institute of Economics and Peace, an Australian think tank. But attacks by Afghanistan-based militant groups abroad are increasing.\n\nExternal attacks by extremist groups based in Afghanistan could provoke retaliation against the Taliban. Islamabad has already carried out air strikes inside Afghanistan in response to TTP attacks.\n\nThe United States says it is working to prevent the reemergence of external terrorism threats from Afghanistan. Vedant Patel, a deputy spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, said on August 1 that Washington is employing international cooperation to ensure that Afghanistan does not become a launching pad for terrorist attacks.\n\nWhat's Next: The Taliban is expected to keep fighting IS-K because of ideological differences.\n\nBut it is unlikely to stop harboring or clamp down on other extremist groups on Afghan soil. That will continue to make Afghanistan a threat to the region and beyond.\n\nWhat To Keep An Eye On\n\nThe Taliban’s unrecognized government on July 30 announced that it was cutting ties with 14 Afghan diplomatic missions abroad and will cease to accept consular documents issued by those missions.\n\nThey include Afghan missions in Australia, Canada, Poland, Greece, London, Belgium, Berlin, Bonn, Switzerland, Austria, France, Italy, Sweden, and Norway.\n\nBut many of those missions have vowed to defy the Taliban and continue their consular and diplomatic services without any interruption.\n\n“Until the Taliban take steps to gain domestic and international legitimacy, their announcements will have no bearing on our work,” Muhibullah Taib, an Afghan diplomat in Switzerland, told RFE/RL’s Radio Azadi.\n\nThe Taliban’s decision is likely to impact hundreds of thousands of Afghans based abroad.\n\n“It will not allow Afghans to travel,” Hamza Khan, an Afghan living in France, told Radio Azadi. “We demand that the Taliban rescind this decision.”\n\nWhy It's Important: Since seizing power, the Taliban has tried to gain control of Afghan diplomatic missions abroad in a bid to boost its legitimacy.\n\nSo far, the Taliban has successfully assumed control of Afghan diplomatic missions in more than a dozen countries in the region.\n\nBut it now appears to be seeking to assert authority over missions in Western nations where Afghan diplomats appointed by the previous government have resisted working with the Taliban.\n\nThat's all from me for now.\n\nDon't forget to send me any questions, comments, or tips that you have.

Tehran is also the biggest trading partner of the cash-strapped and internationally unrecognized Taliban-led government. Kabul is dependent on Iranian ports for most of its imports and exports amid tensions with neighboring Pakistan.\n\nThe Islamic republic is also home to around 4 million Afghan migrants and refugees. The remittances they send back home keep many impoverished families afloat in Afghanistan, which has grappled with an economic crisis since the Taliban takeover in 2021.\n\nGraeme Smith, a senior Afghanistan analyst at the Brussels-based International Crisis Group, said rising tensions in the Middle East \"could have destabilizing consequences for the fragile situation in Afghanistan.\"\n\nSmith said the risk is that a conflict involving Iran will harden the country's borders with Afghanistan, \"making life harder for Afghans.\"\n\nHe said Afghanistan's humanitarian crisis, the largest in the world, could worsen if its borders with Iran are closed.\n\n\"The exit route from that crisis depends on renewed trade across the region,\" he said. \"[But it] requires borders opening to the flow of goods and labor.\"\n\nPakistan Not To Become 'Directly Involved'\n\nHundreds of thousands of Afghans and millions of Pakistanis work as laborers and traders in the oil-rich Arab Gulf countries.\n\nA potential regional war could disrupt the flow of Afghan and Pakistani migrant workers heading to the Gulf. That would deal a major blow to Afghanistan and Pakistan, both of which are both heavily dependent on remittances sent from abroad.\n\nIn Pakistan, some political parties and the media have called for Islamabad to take a more hard-line approach to Israel, which is not formally recognized by the South Asian country.\n\nBut Weinbaum said the \"general feeling among [Pakistani] policymakers is that the country has enough security concerns of its own not to become directly involved.\"\n\nFaced with rising militant attacks in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the southwestern province of Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, Islamabad's choices are limited.\n\n\"There are also worries about an American reaction if Pakistan makes any military commitments [to Iran],\" Weinbaum said.\n\nAfghanistan and Pakistan are home to millions of Shi'ite Muslims. And Iran, a Shi'a-majority country, could look to Shi'ite communities living in its eastern neighbors for recruits in the event of a war.\n\nDuring the Syrian civil war, Iran recruited, trained, and armed thousands of Shi'ite fighters from Afghanistan and Pakistan to fight. Many of those fighters who survived have returned home as the war has died down.\n\nWelcome back to the China In Eurasia briefing, an RFE/RL newsletter tracking China's resurgent influence from Eastern Europe to Central Asia. To subscribe, click here.\n\nI'm RFE/RL correspondent Reid Standish and here's what I'm following right now.\n\nHarvesting Afghanistan's Mineral Wealth\n\nAfter 16 years of delays, Chinese engineers and the Taliban government officially started work at Mes Aynak, a massive project in Afghanistan to mine the world's second-largest deposit of copper, my colleagues at RFE/RL's Radio Azadi reported.\n\nFinding Perspective: At the July 24 event, Taliban officials along with Chinese businessmen and diplomats carried out a ribbon-cutting ceremony as work began on the construction of a road to the mining site.\n\nA $3 billion deal signed in 2008 with the previous Afghan government gave the Chinese state-owned China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC) a 30-year mining concession, but combat between NATO-led troops and Taliban insurgents at the time delayed the project from moving forward.\n\nBut with violence waning since the Taliban's 2021 takeover, the cash-strapped Taliban-installed government is eager to exploit the country's vast and lucrative mineral deposits.\n\nSince it seized power, the Taliban has faced the task of undertaking the reconstruction and development of a country devastated by decades of war. At the same time, officials have also found their economy suffocated by Western sanctions and are dealing with international isolation that has cut them off from receiving financial support.\n\nChina has been an exception for the Taliban government, with Beijing vowing to pursue deeper cooperation shortly after the group took control of Kabul, and Chinese companies have had an eye on exploiting Afghanistan's extensive resource wealth, signing a series of deals to secure the rights to oil and gas fields and rare-earth metal deposits.\n\nWhat Comes Next?: Taliban officials said it would likely be at least two years before the first copper was extracted by MCC.\n\nAccording to a Brookings Institute report, Afghanistan sits on some 2.3 billion metric tons of iron ore and 1.4 million metric tons of rare-earth minerals, and the U.S. Geological Survey has calculated that the country is sitting on $1 trillion in untapped minerals, such as iron, gold, and lithium -- an essential but scarce component in rechargeable batteries and other technologies.\n\nMes Aynak is one of the most attractive offerings for Chinese firms. The deposit is estimated to contain 11.5 million tons of copper ore, which is vital for electronics components and is surging in value due to its use in growing markets related to electric vehicles, renewable energy, and data centers.\n\nWhy It Matters: The ground breaking is a sign that Chinese resource ventures are moving forward in the country after decades of delays, but security concerns are still paramount.\n\nFurther developing the mine and turning a profit from it will require a substantially larger footprint of Chinese workers inside Afghanistan, and there are lingering questions about whether the Taliban can offer protection, especially amid Islamic State-Khorasan’s expanding profile.\n\nChinese workers have increasingly become a target of attacks in the region by various militant groups.\n\nIn neighboring Pakistan, there have been growing attacks on Chinese citizens, including a suicide attack that killed five Chinese engineers in March and a 2021 bombing that killed 13 people, including nine Chinese workers, at a dam project.\n\nIn Afghanistan, at least five Chinese nationals were wounded when gunmen stormed a Kabul hotel popular with Beijing businessmen in 2022.\n\nThree More Stories From Eurasia\n\n1. Kuleba's China Trip\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrapped up a three-day trip to China and Hong Kong, where he met with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi.\n\nHere’s what happened:\n\nThe Details: While meeting with Wang in Guangzhou, Kuleba said that Ukraine remains ready to hold talks with Russia provided Moscow proves it's ready to negotiate in “good faith,” but that Kyiv has yet to see such inclination from the Kremlin.\n\nHe then met with Guangdong Governor Wang Weizhong and regional officials, where he encouraged them “to consider investment and business prospects and humanitarian needs.”\n\n“There is great demand for construction, industrial recovery, renewable energy, and other areas. So now is a good time to deepen trade ties,” Kuleba said.\n\nUkraine’s top diplomat then went to Hong Kong and met with Chief Executive John Lee where he asked him “to take measures to prevent Russia from using Hong Kong to circumvent restrictive measures introduced for Russian aggression against Ukraine.”\n\nThe next day after Wang’s meeting with Kuleba, the Chinese official met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) talks in Laos where they praised their close ties and discussed implementing “a new security architecture” in Eurasia.\n\n2. Hearts, Minds, And Dirty Air\n\nThe massive copper-mining complex in eastern Serbia run by China’s state-owned Zijin Mining Group is facing fresh pushback from nearby residents over pollution concerns, my colleague from RFE/RL’s Balkan Service, Branko Pesic, reports.\n\nWhat You Need To Know: Zijin took over Bor’s massive copper-mining and smelting complex in 2018 and has grappled with concerns about its environmental impact and the health of nearby residents, including fines and a temporary work-stop order.\n\nBut the Chinese mining venture, which has poured billions into the project, has been praised by the Serbian government as a much-needed job creating investment.\n\nEnvironmental groups have accused Serbian authorities of turning a blind eye to pollution and health concerns stemming from the copper mine, which is boosting its output and expanding operations rapidly as value for the metal rises amid increased demand for the role it plays in the global energy transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nBranko spoke with locals and activists who say that pollution, especially from some carcinogenic heavy metals, is getting worse, despite Zijin’s claims. Read his full report here.\n\n3. A China And Russia Flyby Of Alaska\n\nThe United States and Canada scrambled fighter jets on July 24 after two Russian and two Chinese military planes were tracked in international airspace close to Alaska.\n\nWhat It Means: The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said that it “detected, tracked, and intercepted two Russian Tu-95 and two PRC H-6 military aircraft operating in the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ).”\n\nThe “identification zone” is a stretch of international airspace that acts as a buffer zone where U.S. and Canadian national airspace ends. All aircraft entering the ADIZ require identification for national security reasons.\n\nThe presence of the Russian and Chinese planes was not seen as a threat, and intercepts of Russian planes are relatively common in the area.\n\nBut China and Russia together represent a newer development. While the two countries have carried out several joint patrols in the past, this incident was the first one that brought together bombers from both countries in the north Pacific area.\n\nEarlier in July, the Chinese and Russian navies conducted their fourth joint sea patrols in the western and northern Pacific.\n\nAcross The Supercontinent\n\nAnaklia Ruling: In May, the Georgian government awarded a contract to a consortium of Chinese companies to build a new deep-sea port in Anaklia on the country’s Black Sea coast.\n\nBut a previous bid to build the strategic port that was canceled by the government after years of political jostling had spent years waiting for a ruling by an international arbitration court, which ruled on July 29 in Tbilisi’s favor. The move removes a legal obstacle to the project, RFE/RL’s Georgian Service reports.\n\nElection Watch: The U.S. Director of National Intelligence said “foreign actors” are conducting and planning \"influence operations\" targeting the November elections in the United States using increasingly refined tactics “to better hide their hand.”\n\nIl Ripristino: After pulling her country out of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni made her first trip to Beijing, where she met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nThe trip is seen as part of a reset effort by Rome after criticizing the Chinese infrastructure project. During her visit, Meloni called China an \"important interlocutor\" in managing global tensions.\n\nHarris’s Foreign Policy: My colleague Margot Buff and I made a short video looking at what U.S. foreign policy might look like under a Kamala Harris presidency, with a particular focus on Russia and China. Watch it here.\n\nOne Thing To Watch\n\nThe Summer Olympics in Paris kicked off on July 26, and a doping scandal involving Chinese swimmers and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is under way in the background.\n\nThree different incidents have been reported over the last several months in which the Chinese have blamed food contamination for positive drug tests. WADA accepted the results of the Chinese investigations and an independent follow-up was carried out. The doping watchdog organization then kept the matter secret until reporting made the incidents public.\n\nNow, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers has introduced a bill that could cut future U.S. funding for the global sports anti-doping system unless sweeping reforms are made.\n\nThat’s all from me for now. Don’t forget to send me any questions, comments, or tips that you might have.\n\nUntil next time,\n\nReid Standish\n\nIf you enjoyed this briefing and don't want to miss the next edition, subscribe here.

Here's what I've been tracking and what I'm keeping an eye on in the days ahead.\n\nThe Key Issue\n\nAfghan refugees and migrants have complained of rising harassment and abuse in neighboring Iran.\n\nThis week, banners appeared to be hung in a neighborhood in Tehran, the Iranian capital, demanding that Afghans leave. It was unclear if locals or the authorities were behind the move.\n\nIt came after Iranian media reported on July 18 that a local man was allegedly stabbed to death by his Afghan neighbors.\n\nLast week, the homes of several Afghan migrants in the southern city of Khur were reportedly set on fire in apparent retaliation for the killing of an Iranian man, allegedly by an Afghan.\n\nWhy It's Important: Anti-Afghan sentiment in Iran has been on the rise in recent years, especially after a mass influx of refugees and migrants following the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.\n\nTehran has long blamed Afghans for insecurity and unemployment in Iran, and expelled many members of the community.\n\nAn estimated 4.3 million Afghans currently live in Iran, according to the United Nations. More than 1 million have been deported in the past year.\n\nHuman rights groups have also documented a sharp rise in the number of Afghans executed in Iran so far this year.\n\nWhat's Next: As anti-Afghan sentiment rises in Iran, members of the community are likely to be the targets of more discrimination and abuse.\n\nIt is unclear if the ill-treatment of Afghans in Iran will discourage others from moving to the Islamic republic.\n\nHundreds of Afghans are believed to be illegally entering Iran every week to escape Taliban rule and the devastating humanitarian and economic crises in Afghanistan.\n\nWhat To Keep An Eye On\n\nA growing number of Afghans affected by natural disasters are leaving for neighboring countries.\n\nAfghanistan has been the scene of severe droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events in recent years.\n\n\"I was forced to move to Iran after the earthquakes,\" Hassanzada, a resident of the western Afghan city of Herat, told RFE/RL's Radio Azadi.\n\nA series of tremors last year killed at least 1,000 people and affected more than 100,000 in and around Herat.\n\nBut survivors said the lack of aid and financial assistance forced them to leave the country.\n\nWhy It's Important: Afghanistan remains among the world's most vulnerable countries to the effects of global warming and climate change.\n\nIn the latest natural disaster to hit Afghanistan, flash floods in the eastern province of Nangarhar last week killed at least 71 people, according to the UN.\n\nThe Taliban's seizure of power led international donors to immediately cut international development funding. While some foreign aid organizations continue to operate in Afghanistan, many of them have been forced to curb their work as international funding diminishes.\n\nThat's all from me for now.\n\nDon't forget to send me any questions, comments, or tips that you have.

It will be sent to your inbox every Friday.\n\nSuicide bombers and gunmen penetrated a military base in northwestern Pakistan last week, killing eight soldiers.\n\nIt was just the latest in a string of deadly attacks to hit the South Asian country, where militant violence has surged in recent years.\n\nBut what was significant about the July 15 attack in the city of Bannu was the group that claimed responsibility -- Jaish Fursan-e Muhammad (JFM) -- a previously unknown militant outfit.\n\nJFM is among several new militant groups that have announced their arrival on the crowded militant scene in Pakistan in recent months.\n\nBut experts believe the new actors are in fact fronts for existing groups, including the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the most lethal militant organization waging war against Islamabad.\n\nJFM is a believed to be a front for Hafiz Gul Bahadar (HGB), a separate extremist group. The group is named after its leader, a former TTP commander.\n\nTehrik-e Jihad Pakistan (TJP), another militant group that announced its emergence last year, is considered by experts to be a front for the TTP. It marked its arrival with a spectacular attack on a key air base in the eastern province of Punjab in November.\n\nExperts say the fronts have allowed the TTP and HGB -- which are coming under military pressure from Islamabad -- to maintain a position of plausible deniability.\n\n\"All these groups are either part of the TTP or Hafiz Gul Bahadar,\" said Mansur Mehsud, director of the FATA Research Center, an Islamabad-based nonprofit organization. \"This is part of the TTP and HGB's strategy to create confusion.\"\n\n'Using Different Names’\n\nThe TTP and HGB are both believed to be based in Afghanistan, where the Afghan Taliban seized power in 2021.\n\nExperts say the Taliban takeover has emboldened and strengthened Pakistani militants. The withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan has significantly reduced U.S. air strikes in the region, allowing militants to operate more freely.\n\nTTP and HGB fighters have also obtained sophisticated weaponry, including U.S.-made firearms, left behind by international forces.\n\nPakistan has accused the Afghan Taliban of sheltering the TTP, with which it has close ideological and organizational ties.\n\nPakistan has used pressure tactics, observers say, to force the Afghan Taliban to sever ties with the TTP, including by expelling hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees from Pakistan, shutting key border crossings, and blocking Afghan transit goods in recent years.\n\nIslamabad has also conducted deadly cross-border attacks targeting alleged TTP hideouts in eastern Afghanistan.\n\nThe Afghan Taliban has tried to appease Pakistan by relocating TTP fighters away from the border with Pakistan to other areas of Afghanistan and brokering a year of peace talks between the Pakistani militants and Islamabad that broke down. But the Afghan militants have refused to expel the TTP from Afghanistan.\n\nEach major TTP attack inside Pakistan has been followed by Islamabad issuing condemnations and summoning the Afghan Taliban's ambassador in protest.\n\n\"The [Pakistani] Taliban are strong, but also under pressure,\" said Muhammad Amir Rana, an Islamabad-based security and political analyst. \"They are using different names as part of their strategy and also to avoid pressure.\"\n\nMehsud of the FATA Research Center said the \"TTP sometimes deliberately avoids large-scale attacks just to avoid pressure\" from the Afghan Taliban, which he said has tried to convince its Pakistani ally to rein in its attacks.\n\n'Security Situation Is Very Bad'\n\nThe TTP and HGB as well as their affiliates have concentrated most of their attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the northwestern province along the border with Afghanistan that has long been a hotbed of militancy.\n\nSeveral other militant groups that have attracted less headlines have also recently emerged in the region. They include Lashkar-e Khorasan, a militant group believed to be a front for the TTP. The other is the Shaheen Group, which is considered a front for the HGB. Both groups have claimed attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in recent months.\n\nPakistan earlier this year said the military would launch a new offensive to root out militants in the northwest, without offering details.\n\nThe planned military operation has been fiercely opposed by locals in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the scene of numerous offensives that have killed thousands and uprooted millions of civilians in the past.\n\nThousands of people rallied in Bannu on July 19 to call for an end to military operations in the region. The demonstration turned violent and security forces fired on protesters, killing one person. Since then, thousands of people have been participating in a sit-in protest in Bannu.\n\nRana, the Islamabad-based analyst, says Pakistan faces no good choices in its battle to curb the soaring number of militant attacks in the country.\n\nIf it launches a deadly military assault, it will attract the wrath of the public. If it targets alleged TTP strongholds inside Afghanistan, it will further escalate tensions with the Afghan Taliban, he says.\n\n\"The security situation is very bad,\" Rana said. \"This is the peak of it now.\"\n\nChinese engineers and the Taliban government officially started work on a massive project in Afghanistan to mine the world's second-largest deposit of copper.\n\nAt the July 24 event at Mes Aynak, some 40 kilometers southeast of the capital, Kabul, Taliban officials along with Chinese businessmen and diplomats carried out a ribbon-cutting ceremony as work began on the construction of a road to the mining site.\n\nA $3 billion deal signed in 2008 gave the Chinese state-owned China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC) a 30-year mining concession, but combat between NATO-led troops and Taliban insurgents at the time delayed the project from moving forward for 16 years.\n\nWith violence waning since the Taliban's 2021 takeover of power amid the withdrawal of foreign troops, the cash-strapped Taliban-installed government is eager to exploit the country's vast and lucrative mineral deposits.\n\n\"The time wasted in the implementation of the project should be recuperated with speedy work,\" Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs Abdul Ghani Baradar said at the ribbon-cutting event.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:33:49 0:00\n\nTaliban officials said it would likely be at least two years before the first copper was extracted by MCC while Chinese diplomats praised the progress as a sign of warming ties between Beijing and Kabul.\n\n\"The economic and trade relations between the two countries are becoming increasingly close,\" said China's ambassador to Afghanistan, Zhao Xing.\n\nSince it seized power, the Taliban has faced the task of undertaking the reconstruction and development of a country devastated by decades of war.\n\nBut officials have also found their economy suffocated by Western sanctions and dealing with international isolation that has cut them off from receiving financial support.\n\nChina has been an exception for the Taliban government, with Beijing vowing to pursue deeper cooperation shortly after the group took control of Kabul.\n\nBeijing has been particularly focused on exploiting Afghanistan's extensive resource wealth, from oil and gas to rare-earth metals.\n\nMes Aynak remains one of the most attractive offerings for Chinese firms. The deposit is estimated to contain 11.5 million tons of copper ore, which is vital for electronics components and is surging in value due to its use in growing markets related to electric vehicles, renewable energy, and data centers.\n\nAccording to a Brookings Institute report, Afghanistan sits on some 2.3 billion metric tons of iron ore and 1.4 million metric tons of rare-earth minerals, and the U.S. Geological Survey has calculated that the country is sitting on $1 trillion in untapped minerals, such as iron, gold, and lithium -- an essential but scarce component in rechargeable batteries and other technologies.\n\nAmir Mohammad Musazai, a retired professor from the Department of Geology and Mines at Kabul Polytechnic University, told RFE/RL's Radio Azadi that mining Mes Aynak is likely to yield amounts of copper ore worth more than the $3 billion that was signed for the mining rights, given that nearby areas also hold large copper reserves that weren’t factored into the original plans.\n\nWhile the groundbreaking event at Mes Aynak is a sign that Chinese resource ventures are moving forward in the country after decades of delays due to war, security concerns are still a major hurdle holding back more expansive projects, which often rely on Chinese engineers and other staff.\n\nThe July 24 ceremony was closely guarded by dozens of armed men and Taliban officials made assurances that they would protect staff at the mining project.\n\nChinese workers have increasingly become a target of attacks in the region, including a suicide attack that killed five Chinese enginners in Pakistan in March and a 2021 bombing that killed 13 people, including nine Chinese workers, at a dam project in the South Asian country.\n\nIn Afghanistan, at least five Chinese nationals were wounded when gunmen stormed a Kabul hotel popular with Beijing businessmen in 2022.\n\nMaulana Fazlur Rehman, leader of the largest Islamist party in Pakistan, has voiced his opposition to a planned operation by the military to root out militants along the Afghan border.\n\nIn an interview with RFE/RL's Radio Mashaal on July 22, the controversial cleric called for peace talks between Pakistan and Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the most lethal militant group waging war against Islamabad.\n\nThe comments from Rehman, the head of the Jamiat Ulema Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) party, came as militant violence has surged across the predominately Muslim nation of some 240 million people.\n\nA high-profile bomb-and-gun attack on a military base in the northwestern city of Bannu on July 15 killed 10 government security personnel.\n\nBut residents of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the northwestern province that has been the scene of devastating military operations that uprooted millions of people and killed thousands of civilians in the past, have protested against any new military operations in the region.\n\n\"People are not ready to suffer yet again,\" Rehman, who hails from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, told Radio Mashaal. \"We have been through bitter times.\"\n\nThousands of people waving white flags and calling for peace rallied in Bannu on July 19 calling for an end to military operations in the region. The demonstration turned violent and security forces fired on protesters, killing one person.\n\nSince then, thousands of people have been participating in a sit-in protest in Bannu.\n\n\"The voices in Bannu are the voices of all the residents of Pakhtunkhwa,\" Rehman said.\n\nIslamabad earlier this year said the military would launch a new offensive to combat militants along the Afghan border, without offering details.\n\nPakistani military spokesman Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif on July 22 said the planned operation would be a \"comprehensive counter-terrorism campaign\" that would not displace locals.\n\nBut those comments have done little to quell the concerns of protesters and locals who fear for their lives and livelihoods in any new military offensive.\n\nSince 2003, tens of thousands of civilians have been killed in major counterterrorism offensives in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where more than 6 million people have been displaced. The province was a former stronghold of the Afghan Taliban, the Haqqani network, and Al-Qaeda.\n\n\"People are ready to be buried in the ruins of their homes,\" Rehman said. \"But they do not want to be humiliated again.\"\n\nPeace Prospects\n\nThe TTP has intensified its deadly insurgency against Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban seized power in Kabul.\n\nIslamabad has repeatedly accused the Afghan militants of sheltering the TTP, with which it has close ideological and organizational ties. Kabul has rejected the claim, and ties between Pakistan and the Taliban, which have been close allies for decades, have plummeted.\n\nIn January, the 71-year-old Rehman visited Afghanistan to repair ties. During his stay in Kabul, he met with Taliban officials, including its reclusive chief, Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada, and TTP leaders.\n\nIn his interview with Radio Mashaal, Rehman said he presented a plan to resolve the conflict between Islamabad and the TTP with the mediation of the Afghan Taliban.\n\n\"But our [security] establishment and rulers are so incompetent that they didn't accept that solution,\" said Rehman.\n\nRehman said a peace deal was the only way to end the TTP’s 17-year insurgency against Islamabad.\n\nIn 2022, the Afghan Taliban brokered yearlong peace talks between the TTP and Islamabad. But the talks broke down and the TTP resumed its attacks.\n\nRehman has courted controversy for his support of the Afghan Taliban.\n\nA JUI-F-led coalition governed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa between 2002-2007. Critics blame the party for sheltering the Afghan Taliban whose presence in the region led to the emergence of the TTP. Many Afghan Taliban leaders were educated in Islamic seminaries run by JUI-F leaders.\n\nWritten by Abubakar Siddique based on reporting by Tahir Khan of RFE/RL's Radio Mashaal\n\nThe homes of several Afghan migrants in the southern Iranian city of Khur have reportedly been set on fire in apparent retaliation for the killing of an Iranian man allegedly by an Afghan national.\n\nHosna, an Afghan who lives in Khur, told RFE/RL’s Radio Azadi on July 19 that he moved his family from Khur to Shiraz in Fars Province out of fear for their safety.\n\n\"People in the region are very angry and set homes of several Afghans on fire,\" he claimed.\n\nHosna and others who spoke to Radio Azadi attributed the anger to the July 3 killing of a 62-year-old restaurant owner in the town of Khenj by his 17-year-old apprentice. Iranian media have not identified the nationality of the suspected killer, but Hosna said the suspect was an Afghan citizen.\n\n\"The people of the region have sworn not to sell 1 kilogram of meat, or even a piece of bread, to Afghan nationals,\" Hosna said. \"So, many were forced to flee to Shiraz.\"\n\nAnti-Afghan sentiment in Iran has been on the rise in recent years, especially after a mass influx of migrants following the Taliban's return to power in August 2021.\n\nOccasionally, a hashtag that describes the expulsion of Afghan migrants as a \"national demand\" becomes a top trend on X, formerly Twitter, often boosted by anonymous accounts.\n\nLast week, an unsubstantiated claim on social media blamed Afghan migrants for an alleged rise in leprosy cases in Iran.\n\nThe UN’s refugee agency says Iran hosts around 780,000 Afghan refugees, in addition to some 2.6 million undocumented Afghan migrants. But Iran claimed last year that the number of illegal Afghan immigrants was closer to 5 million.\n\nThe authorities have vowed to deport illegal refugees and hundreds of Afghan migrants are sent back to Afghanistan every day. They are also banned from living or working in half of Iran's 31 provinces.\n\nAfghans living in Iran have complained to Radio Azadi about rising harassment, even during deportation.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:04:13 0:00\n\nTehran has for years maintained that it does not receive sufficient financial aid from international organizations to handle the number of refugees on its soil.\n\nAn unsubstantiated claim on social media linking an alleged rise in leprosy cases in Iran to the country’s Afghan community has resulted in renewed calls for the expulsion of Afghan migrants.\n\nIranian media have cited the Health Ministry as reporting nine new cases of leprosy over the past year. The reports said three of those afflicted were Afghans.\n\nThe same day, a freelance Iranian journalist who advocates for the expulsion of Afghan refugees alleged without evidence that “Afghan migrants” were responsible for spreading leprosy in Iran.\n\nHe incorrectly charged that “no cases of leprosy had been seen in Iran in years” -- a claim that is easily debunked by data available on the World Health Organization’s (WHO) website.\n\nOn July 9, another journalist who often writes in support of expelling Afghan migrants went as far as calling the alleged rise in leprosy cases “bioterrorism” and demanded that the incoming government of President-elect Masud Pezeshkian “start deporting Afghans.”\n\n“Afghans are bringing and spreading the leprosy virus,” he wrote without offering evidence, falsely claiming that leprosy, which is caused by bacteria, is a viral disease.\n\nBoth posts on the social media platform X have received nearly half a million views, been shared more than 1,000 times, and liked by over 7,000 accounts.\n\nWhat Does The Data Say?\n\nLeprosy in Iran has never been eliminated, but it has declined sharply since 2005, dropping from 79 to six in 2022, according to WHO data. No certified health authority has ever declared leprosy an epidemic in Iran or Afghanistan.\n\nLeprosy is a chronic bacterial infectious disease that mainly affects the skin and peripheral nerves. It is curable but leaving it untreated may cause permanent disabilities.\n\nThe disease spreads via droplets from the nose and mouth through close and frequent contact with untreated individuals.\n\nRising Anti-Afghan Sentiment\n\nAfghans fleeing the Soviet invasion in the 1980s were welcomed in Iran, thanks in large part to the anti-Soviet views of the recently established Islamic republic. But animosity toward the growing Afghan community has only worsened since.\n\nIn recent years -- especially after an influx of migrants following the Taliban’s return to power in August 2021 -- there have been more frequent displays of anti-Afghan sentiment.\n\nOver the past several months, a Persian hashtag that calls the “expulsion of Afghans” a “national demand” has been trending, often boosted by anonymous accounts.\n\nThe UNHCR, the United Nations’ refugee agency, says Iran hosts 780,000 Afghan refugees, in addition to 2.6 million undocumented Afghan nationals.\n\nBut the authorities in Tehran claimed last year that 5 million Afghans were living in Iran illegally, and vowed to deport them. Afghan migrants were later banned from living or working in half of the country’s 31 provinces.\n\nIn recent months, Afghan migrants in Iran have complained to RFE/RL's Radio Azadi about rising harassment, even during deportation.\n\nIran has long said that it does not receive enough financial assistance from international bodies to deal with the number of refugees on its soil."
