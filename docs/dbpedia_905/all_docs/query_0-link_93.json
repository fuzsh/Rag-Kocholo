Rights Foundation of Turkey Türkiye İnsan Hakları Raporu – 2005 INTRODUCTION On 3 October 2005 the negotiations for full membership of Turkey to the EU started officially. While this mainly political decision put Turkey closer to the EU it also meant that the government of the Turkish Republic met the political Copenhagen criteria with the legal changes and that the situation in Turkey regarding basic rights and freedoms corresponded with the European norms. For the historic year 2005 the Documentation Center and the Treatment Centers of the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey (HRFT) shall tray to evaluate the human rights situation in Turkey. The Right to Life and Personal Security The findings of the Documentation Center show that five people died in custody. Hundreds of people were torture or ill-treated. At least 376 people were killed by means of extra-judicial execution, shootings on disregard of stop warnings, arbitrary fire of the security forces, in prison, as the result of attacks from illegal organizations, political killings or because of mines and bombs. In 2005 a total of 675 people applied to the treatment and rehabilitation centers of the HRFT because of torture. Among the applicants to the centers in Adana, Ankara, Diyarbakır, İstanbul and İzmir there were 13 children. A total of 193 people alleged to have been tortured in 2005. The shortening of the period of detention, an increase in contact to a lawyer are positive developments but not sufficient to eradicate torture. Despite the announcement of the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey government of a \"zero tolerance\" against torture and some legal provisions the tendency that torture does not result in criminal, administrative and practical punishment contributes to the fact that torture continues. For instance: The trial against 16 police charged in connection with the death of a person that had been detained during a raid on the offices of HADEP in Kocaeli on 20 November 1998 and who died because of the torture inflicted on him concluded in 2005. Kocaeli Heavy Penal Court No. 2 acquitted nine police officers and sentenced the other seven to 20 months' imprisonment. On 33 April 2005 İskenderun Heavy Penal Court acquitted three police officers and their chief in connection with torture of two girls who had been detained in March 1999. The court ruled that there was not sufficient evidence for a conviction. Freedom of Thought and Expression Having passed the GNAT on 26 September 2004 and entered into force on 1 June the Turkish Penal Code (Law 5237) was revised on 29 June and 40 Articles were changed. The amendments included the provision of up to three years' imprisonment for oral or written statements in an attempt to influence trials or interrogations. For the offence of \"insult against the basic national interest\" under Article 301 TPC foreigners were added to the list of possible offenders. In the years before Article 312 and 150 of the TPC had been 1 Turkey Human Rights Report – 2005 used in trials against writers, journalists and human rights activists, since 1 June the Article 301, 288 and some other provisions are used to open such trials and in some cases convict the defendants. During a speech of Foreign Minister Abdullah Gül during the debate on the budget on 21 December he stressed again the in Turkey nobody would go to prison for expressing an opinion that did not include violence or an insult and maintained that the freedom of expression was protected. However, the report of the Union of Publishers stated for 2004 and the first half of 2005 a total of 25 publishers had been on trial for 43 books written by 37 different authors. The report stated that eight journalists were still imprisoned. In a positive step Birol Duru, reporter with the news agency DİHA and the HRA member Daimi Açığ who had been imprisoned when they tried to take the picture of a field of cannabis, were released on 29 December to be tried without being remanded. The Documentation Center found out that during December a total of 38 people including two politicians, 20 journalists and editors-in-chief, three human rights defenders, two reporters, two TV directors, one news agency, six publishing houses, one translator and one photographer were tried. In addition, the offices of the daily Özgür Gündem were raided. The Freedom of Association While the court case against the board of the HRFT continued a trial was initiated against the representative in Adana and the physician recording the applications. Between November 2004 and the end of 2005 a total of 55 court cases and six investigations were launched against the branches of the HRA in Malatya, Van, Trabzon, Hatay, Bingöl, Siirt, Urfa, Adıyaman, Batman, Mardin, İstanbul, Diyarbakır, Tarsus and İzmir. Since the branch in Bingöl had been founded in 2001 until July 2005 the prosecutor had investigated in 92 2 Introduction cases and brought charges in 51 of them. In 2005 officials of the HRA continued to receive oral and written death threats. Together with six organizations and individuals we left the Human Rights Advisory Board (HRAB) that had been founded with the aim to share the problems related to human rights with NGOs, to take joint decisions and take legal measures, but never asked for advice or opinions. The public prosecutor indicted the former chair of the HRAB, Prof. Dr. İbrahim Kaboğlu and Prof. Dr. Baskın Oran for the report on minorities they had prepared in October 2004. They were charged under Article 301 new TPC with incitement to separatism and humiliation of the judiciary. Some examples in the area of freedom of expression are: On 27 October the case concerning the closure of the teachers' union Eğitim-Sen was rejected for the third time. The General Assembly of the Judicial Court of Cassation had quashed the earlier decisions stating that it was a Constitutional provision that education could not be held in any other language than Turkish. The Court of Cassation will have to deal with the case once again. In March Abdülmelik Fırat, President of HAKPAR and 12 board members were indicted because they sent invitations to the State President, the Prime Minister and the President of the GNAT in Kurdish and spoke in Kurdish during the General Assembly. The Prisons In 2005 another six prisoners went on death fast. According to the findings of the Documentation Center at least 10 prisoners, three of them political, died in prison because of illness, hanging or burning themselves or being beaten to death by other prisoners. During the year 233 prisoners applied to the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey Turkey Human Rights Report – 2005 HRFT after release. Their applications show the devastating result of isolation in prison. Introduction \"The Right to Freedom of Association\" \"The Prohibition of Torture\" The Şemdinli Incident The events in Şemdinli and Yüksekova district of Hakkari province in November showed once again that the conditions of the state of emergency practically continue in the region. Strong evidence was found that the bombing of the bookshop in Şemdinli was carried out by a form of organization resembling the Susurluk gang. Police officers tried to hinder the prosecutor to collect evidence in shooting at the crowd; two of the three suspects were sergeants of the intelligence of the gendarmerie (JİT or JİTEM) and one was a defector; they had come in a car belong to the gendarmerie; in the car a list of people to be killed was found; all this is evidence for such an organization. The Commander of the Army stated that he knew one of the sergeants personally as a good man. This raises suspicion that they acted within the structure of orders. During protest demonstrations in Yüksekova the police opened fire on the demonstrators and killed four of them. Seven police officers and many demonstrators were injured. Another example for the practical continuation of the state of emergency that prevented the investigation of human rights abuses is the trial of village guards, soldiers and defectors at Hakkari Heavy Penal Court. The Court passed its verdict on 18 November. It sentenced the defector (former PKK member) to 8 years and 4 months' imprisonment and acquitted the other 12 defendants including high-ranking officers. “Active Monitouring for Democracy” Project On 1 January 2005 the Documentation Center of the HRFT started the Active Observing Project for Democracy. The project will last until 30 March 2006 and had three main areas: The aim was to observe human rights violations in these areas and to broaden the capacity on reporting as well as to develop a common language among human rights organizations. The project was jointly conducted with the HRA. Within the projects seminars were held in seven different provinces at different date with NGOs working on human rights in these provinces. During the seminars information was shared on the kind of human rights violations in the three areas and the documentation of abuses. Information on the fight for human rights was also exchanged. General Evaluation It is important to note that worldwide human rights abuses were reported in 2005. The CIA organized flights from countries outside the USA for suspects of terror to be taken to torture chambers and allegations were raised that CIA agents interrogated suspects under torture in Turkey. Members of the security forces violated the right to life by killing civilians during demonstrations. Despite some positive steps against torture under the slogan of the government \"zero tolerance for torture\" there was no serious will (intention) to eradicate torture and deaths under torture continued. The judiciary continued to protect suspects of torture, killings, drug trafficking and gangs founded on State level. Only few trials were initiated and in very few of them sentences were passed, but on the lowest level. Impunity continued as the rule. The field of freedom of expression continued to be a filed of mines. Provisions to persecute opponents and silence them were reproduced, but each change of the TPC was presented as a step towards democracy. We hope that the \"The Right to Freedom of Expression\" Human Rights Foundation of Turkey 3 Turkey Human Rights Report – 2005 trial against Orhan Pamuk has taught a lesson to the officials. In a similar way the freedom of association is under threat. Trade unions, associations, professional organizations, foundations and political parties were subjected to administrative and judicial pressure. Heavy conditions continued in the prisons. Political prisoners were subjected to isolation. The Prime Minister talked about the Kurdish question, but no step was taken towards a solution. Regional measures to fight poverty and unemployment and to compensate the losses of the people were not taken. 4 Introduction The pressure on human rights organizations and activists continued. The civil society was invited to some meetings, but not included in the decision taking process. While the NGOs were left aside the influence of the military on political life was accepted. Despite all these negative facts social dynamics were able to realize reactions and spend efforts for informing and encouraging the government. We hope that the new year will be a year of improvement of human rights, democracy, peace and welfare and that the problems will diminish. YAVUZ ÖNEN President of the HRFT. Human Rights Foundation of Turkey Human Rights Foundation of Turkey The Kurdish Question THE KURDISH QUESTION After the HPG (People's Defense Forces) declared on 1 June 2004 an end to the unilateral ceasefire that had been announced on 1 September 1998 clashes increased. Between 20 August and 3 October the PKK announced a period without actions. Prior to this there was an intense discussion on another ceasefire. In 2005 the discussion of the Kurdish question mainly focused on incidents in Şemdinli, Hakkari and Yüksekova and the prison conditions of Abdullah Öcalan (for the bomb attacks in Şemdinli, Hakkari and Yüksekova see the chapter on Right to Life and for demonstrations in favor of Abdullah Öcalan see the chapter on Freedom of Assembly). Between 28 March and 4 April a congress for the ReStructuring of the PKK was held and the new establishment of the PKK was announced. On 9 April the daily Özgür Politika presented a declaration of Murat Karayılan the spokesperson of the parliament of the PKK on the new perspective. He said that the name PKK did not mean that the organization would turn back to the old days. In the past the PKK had followed a violent course for the creation of an independent State. Although the spirit of being followers of Apo (Abdullah Öcalan) was still the same the aim was no longer a separate State based on a nation, but a democratic nation. Violence was to be used in defense and not as a tool for solution. On 10 April some 200 intellectuals, writers, journalists, artists, academics and representatives of NGOs published a joined declaration expressing their fear of an increasing nationalism and a return to an atmosphere of violence. The declaration was published under the headline of \"We are concerned and warn\" WE ARE CONCERNED AND WARN As Citizens with Signatures below… We see an attempt to hinder democratization, civilization and the peace process in our country and are concerned that there might be a return to an atmosphere of violence and clashes. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE NEW PENAL CODE … restricting freedom of expression THERE IS AN ATTEMPT TO RETURN TO CLASHES … in the hysteria about juveniles ripping the Turkish flag during Nevruz … with a lynch attempt in Trabzon … Turkish and Kurdish nationalism is provoked POLITICS OF PEACE ARE NO CONCESSION … the discussion on the genocide and the rights of minorities increase the fear … the aim should be to reach the level of civilization … we are against discrimination, a mind of prohibition, status quo and clashes.

On 15 June 151 intellectuals published a leaflet calling on the PKK to stop its actions. The leaflet stated inter alias: \"Only in the last month 50 people lost their lives. During the last 15 years about 30,000 human beings lost their lives in what is called a 'lowlevel conflict' or 'dirty war'. We ask the PKK to stop its actions without any pre-condition and call on the government to take the necessary legal steps for everybody to participate in the political life.\" On 19 June Fikret Bila reported in his column in the daily Milliyet on a conversation with Justice Minister Cemil Çiçek who commented on a meeting with ambassadors from EU countries and the leaflet of intellectuals. The Justice Minister said inter alias that it had been difficult to have the world agree that the PKK was a terrorist organization. It had taken another 2 to 3 years to get the acceptance after the PKK changed its name to Kongra-Gel. Cemil Çiçek said further that the leaflet of intellectuals might be useful if it had an effect on the opposite side. The opposite side were the terror groups. The State or the government could not be the contact for such a call. On 22 June a total of 264 Kurdish intellectuals supported the call of Turkish intellectuals with their signatures. Former deputy Tarık Ziya Ekinci spoke on a press conference and said that a general amnesty and developments of the economy and social and cultural affairs was a pre-condition for a solution. The Kurds in Turkey had to freely enjoy their language and culture. On 10 August Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan accepted the intellectuals who had called on the PKK 6 to put down their arms. He said that the Kurdish question just like many other problems should be tackled under the general question of democratization within the constitutional order of principles of the Republic. Regardless of whether one called it the social demands of the citizens of Kurdish origin or the question of the Southeast one should avoid linking this question to terror. On 16 August Saygı Öztürk reported in the daily Hürriyet that following the declaration of the Prime Minister the General Staff had formed a working group to present a report to the National Security Council (NSC). The journalist stated that the report would not speak of the Kurdish question but the problem with terror. The military experts would stress that the main problem of the region was the underdevelopment. An unnamed expert had told the journalist that there were no demands for another state of emergency. In separate news Hürriyet quoted from the report that was presented to the NSC before its meeting on 23 August. The reports stated inter alias that the organization (PKK) was short before dissolving itself. The question of leadership was imminent and Osman Öcalan who had left the organization was like a ricochet. Murat Karayılan, Duran Kalkan and Cemil Bayık were trying to stay at the top of the organization by founding groups to their own ends. Prior to a visit of the Prime Minister to the region Recep Tayyip Erdoğan met 57 mayors from the DEHAP. Speaking on behalf of the mayors, Osman Baydemir, Mayor of Diyarbakır, said that the tension in the region was increasing day by day. The atmosphere Human Rights Foundation of Turkey Turkey Human Rights Report – 2005 of clashes was harmful for the economy as well as the state of law. The mayors presented the following findings for a solution to the Kurdish question: - the Kurdish question cannot be reduced to a problem of underdevelopment, even though the economic problems are important; - in order to establish peace and development a civilian project has to be defined that includes the social, cultural, political, economic and judicial dimensions; - arms have to be silenced in order to develop a democratic discussion, feeling of sympathy and security; - reforms of laws and the Constitution as well as administrative reforms have to be made to continue the process of democratization; - problems of internal displacement, harm to the environment, poverty, unemployment, health and accommodation have to be solved. Positive discrimination is needed for the region; - one should refrain from the state of emergency or changes to the anti-terror law that would take us away from the harmonization with the EU; - the solution will be easier, if local and central administration and the organizations of civilian society (NGOs) work close together. On 19 August Kongra-Gel announced in Belgium that there would be a time without actions between 20 August and 20 September during which militants of the HPG would only defend themselves. The initiative of intellectuals had created a positive atmosphere for a solution and Kongra-Geld wanted to show that the organization was not against the State and carried an understanding of solving the question of democratization in Turkey within its unity. On 20 August Murat Yetkin commented in the daily Radikal on the press conference in Brussels. Belgium had not allowed the President of Kongra-Gel, Zübeyir Aydar (former deputy of the Democracy Party DEP) to appear at the press conference since there was an arrest warrant issued in 2004 against him. Police officers had come to the international press center and informed the journalists that Aydar would be arrested and deported to Switzerland where he had been recognized as a political refugee. On the other hand the Movement for a Democratic Society lead by former deputies of DEP (Leyla Zana and 3 others) had not been able to grasp the message from European countries such as the Netherlands, Germany, the UK and Austria to clearly separate them from the PKK and not be become another front organization such as KADEK or Kongra-Gel. The only positive development was the declaration of about one hundred NGOs in Diyarbakır who declared that they supported the speech of the Prime Minister of 12 Human Rights Foundation of Turkey The Kurdish Question August in saying that the solution of the question was mainly a question of democracy. Later Kongra-Geld extended the period without actions until 3 October when the negotiations between Turkey and the EU were to start. During the 43 days without actions 43 militants were killed according to a later announcement of Kongra-Gel. The Killing of Hikmet Fidan On 17 February Kemal Şahin (code name: Kemale Sor) who had left Kongra-Gel and joined the Patriotic Democratic Party (Partiya Welatparezen Demokraten = PWD) of Osman Öcalan was killed near Süleymaniye (North Iraq). The PWD claimed that HPG militants killed him. On 6 July Hikmet Fidan, former deputy chair of the closed down HADEP, was killed in Diyarbakır. Apparently two people shot him in his neck. First statements claimed that there was no political dimension in the attack. However, the PWD claimed on its website that the PKK had killed Hikmet Fidan. The declaration also attributed the killing of Kemal Şahin and Sipan Rojhilat to the PKK. In November the public prosecutor in Diyarbakır indicted three people in connection with the killing. The indictment stated that Hikmet Fidan had participated in a meeting of the PWD in Northern Iraq and had been given the duty of organizing the PWD in Turkey. Veysi Akgönül and Mustafa Kemal Ok had also been at the meeting in Northern Iraq and had been instructed to found a print office in Diyarbakır in order to finance the organization. Later Veysi Akgönül had been threatened by the PKK and accepted to kill Hikmet Fidan. He had asked Fırat Karahan for help. He had called Hikmet Fidan to meet him, but being too afraid himself the PKK member Serkan Şitilay had carried out the killing. The indictment asked for life imprisonment for Fırat Karahan and a sentence of 10 years' imprisonment for Mustafa Kemal Ok. Veysi Akgönül who had provided information to clarify the crime should not be punished. The file of Serkan Şitilay who had not been captured was separated. On 28 December Diyarbakır Heavy Penal Court No. 4 started to hear the case. Mustafa Kemal Ok testified to the effect that after the killing Eyüp Karageçi (former executive of DEP) had called him and told him to say that the PKK had committed the killing. The defendant Fırat Karahan stated that he had been tortured in custody. The prosecutor Muammer Özcan had threatened him to put him in prison for 36 years, if he did not sign the statement. Therefore, he had used his right to remain silent. The son of Hikmet Fidan, Tarık Fidan, participated as sub-plaintiff. He stated that Mehmet Ören, Murat 7 Turkey Human Rights Report – 2005 Karayılan and Zübeyir Aydar had called his father over the phone and threatened him. Tarık Fidan maintained that Abdullah Öcalan was informed about the killing. In an article in the daily Cumhuriyet of 19 July the journalist Mehmet Faraç raised some questions on killings within the PKK. He pointed at parallels of this killing to the killing of Musa Anter who, too, was called from the hotel his was staying in to a meeting with a person he knew for his contacts to the PKK. The article attributed the following killings to the PKK: Engin Sincer, Halit Sofi, Hayrettin Aydın (treasurer of the PKK), his brother Nurettin Aydın, Mahmut Arda, Sema Yıldız, Aydın Şahin, Sevim Adıbelli, Sedat Bayraktar, Levent Buker, Mustafa Yaygır, Doktor Rodi Demirkapı, Mustafa Günaydın, Murat Bayun, Faruk Bozkurt, Berzan Dürre, Nazime Adtürk, Yücel Zeydan, Mehmet Emin Unay, Rahman Şen, Mamosta Osman (Osman Hoca), Helat Soran, Erdal İlaslan, Salih Tatoğlu, Fatoş Sağlamgöz, Muhammed Aslan, Cemal Polat, Murat Yücel, his lover Filiz Yerlikaya and Hüseyin Morsümbül. The Law to Re-Integration and other Issues On 30 March Interior Minister Abdülkadir Aksu answered a question of Orhan Eraslan, deputy from Niğde on Law 4959 on the Re-Integration into Society. He stated that 4,340 members of illegal organizations had applied to benefit from the law. Among them 2,980 had already been imprisoned. 1,529 prisoners had belonged to separatist organizations; 1,095 belonged to organizations with a religious background and 356 to organizations of the extreme left. In February the public prosecutor in Ankara finished the investigation into the advertisement that had been placed in the International Herald Tribune and Le Monde under the headline of \"What do the Kurds want?\" The prosecutor decided against charges on the grounds that the advertisement signed by 203 people was within the scope of freedom of expression. In February the Ministry for the Interior decided against the application of former PKK executive Şemdin Sakık to benefit from the Repentance Law. The letter to Diyarbakır Heavy Penal Court No. 6 stated that, although Sakık had provided information that helped to crack down on the organization, he had given orders for the killing of hundreds of people. On 20 May 1999 Şemdin Sakık and his brother Arif Sakık had been sentenced to death. After the death penalty was lifted in Turkey the sentence was commuted to aggravated lifer imprisonment. On 22 February Sohbet Şen, İmam Özpolat and Ali Şükran Aktaş were detained when they wanted to meet deputies from the CHP in the GNAT. All three had returned to Turkey in 1999 on the call of Abdullah Öcalan as a \"peace group\" and had been convicted as members of an illegal organization. On 23 February they were remanded on charges of membership of an illegal organization. 8 The Kurdish Question On 11 May Ankara Heavy Penal Court No. 11 started to hear their case. Defense lawyer Hamit Geylani said that articles of newspapers published abroad and letters written to the deputies could not count as evidence. The prosecutor insisted on charges under Article 314 new TPC for membership of an armed organization. In January Nuriye Kesbir, member of PKK/Kongra-Gel, was released in the Netherlands after a court in The Hague had ruled against an extradition to Turkey. In Germany Remzi Kartal, deputy chair of Kongra-Gel was released on 28 February. He had been arrested in Nuremberg on 22 January since a demand for extradition existed for him. In August Diyarbakır Penal Court No. 2 acquitted the lawyer Muharrem Şahin from charges of resisting the police and staging an illegal demonstration. The lawyer had been detained under beatings when he wanted to participate in the autopsy of Engin Sincer, an executive of KADEK who had died under suspicious circumstances on Kandil Mountain on 7 September 2003. The public prosecutor in Bitlis started an investigation against Mehmet Can Demir, chair of DEHAP for the province, because a calendar of the organization for the year 2005 had included Kurdish names. In March the Ministry for the Environment and Woods renamed some animal species, saying foreign scientists opposed to its territorial integrity had chosen their former names with ill intent. A sheep species previously known as Ovis Armeniana was renamed Ovis Orientalis Anatolicus. A species of red fox was renamed as Vulpes Vulpes rather than Vulpes Vulpes Kurdistanica.

The Trial of the Deputies of the Democracy Party On 25 February Ankara Heavy Penal Court No. 11 continued to hear the case of the former deputies from the Democracy Party (DEP), Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, Orhan Doğan and Selim Sadak.

During the hearing of 22 April presiding judge Orhan Karadeniz maintained that the defendants had not made statements for a long time and the proceedings were protracted. Defense lawyer Yusuf Alataş said that the indictment had asked for a conviction of his clients under Article 125 old TPC, but during the new trial the charges had changed to Article 168 old TPC. He demanded that a new indictment should be prepared. The Court decided to hear eight witnesses of the defense, a public witness, Sedat Edip Bucak, former deputy of the DYP and Halit Aslan, a witness of the prosecution.

In March 1994 the joint Commission of Constitution and Justice agreed to lift the immunity of Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, Sırrı Sakık, Ahmet Türk, Orhan Doğan, Selim Sadak and Mahmut Alınak (all deputies for DEP). On 17 March 1994 Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, Sırrı Sakık, Ahmet Türk, Orhan Doğan and Mahmut Alınak were arrested.

The relatives had asked the prosecutor in Kiğı for help and he ordered the exhumation. Tahsin Yıldız, a relative of Hulusi Yıldız said: \"The gendarmerie station is surrounded by barbed wire, but the graveyard is on the other side of the road that passes the station.

He and other lawyers working on the case called for further investigations into these \"disappearances\". Their efforts to draw attention to this case led to it being raised recently at the Human Rights Commission of the Turkish Parliament. On 3 February, the Commander of Gendarmerie Forces in Tunceli province visited the workplace of a relative of Hüseyin Aygün. The Commander told the relative that that Hüseyin Aygün was \"a traitor to the country\" and \"an enemy of the state\". The Commander also claimed that \"soon you’ll see that we have discredited him\". At a meeting with Hüseyin Aygün on 7 February, the Gendarmerie Commander made similar statements, and told the lawyer that: \"…we know you well, you are under every stone, our institution considers you very negatively… your family are good, but why are you like this? Don’t go against us in every incident. OK, you are doing your job but don’t do it any more – just leave it to others\". On 11 February, Hüseyin Aygün was visited by three members of the gendarmerie wearing plain clothes, who told him that the Gendarmerie Commander wished to meet with him again. When Hüseyin Aygün telephoned the Gendarmerie Commander to find out more, the Commander reportedly tried to blackmail him, saying that \"I have in my hands some solid evidence, this time there’s no saving you. However, I’m hesitant as to whether or not I should transfer 11 Turkey Human Rights Report – 2005 The Kurdish Question these files to the Prosecutor… perhaps if you listen to us we can come to some agreement with you.\" Bayram (from the Haruna tribe) and the house of Mayor Resul Sadak (DEHAP). (The text was taken from an Amnesty International report: AI Index: EUR 44/006/2005 of 15 February 2005, full report under: http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR440062 005?open&of=ENG-TUR and update under: http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGEUR440252 005?open&of=ENG-TUR) On 17 May soldiers of the gendarmerie raided Yaprak (Tuti), Zümrüt (Pırpari) and Yünöüce (Melez) villages in Lice district (Diyarbakır) and detained 53 people allegedly in connection with a mine explosion in the region.

The important facts from the judgment as related in the press release of the same day are: The case concerns an application brought by a Turkish national, Abdullah Öcalan, who was born in 1949. He is currently incarcerated in İmralı Prison (Bursa, Turkey). On 9 October 1998 he was expelled from Syria, where he had been living for many years. From there he went to Greece, Russia, Italy and then again Russia and Greece before going to Kenya, where, on the evening of 15 February 1999, in disputed circumstances, he was taken on board an aircraft at Nairobi airport and arrested by Turkish officials. He was then flown to Turkey. On arrival in Turkey, he was taken to İmralı Prison, where he was held in police custody from 16 to 23 February 1999 and questioned by the security forces. He received no legal assistance during that period. His lawyer in Turkey was prevented from traveling to visit him by members of the security forces. 16 other lawyers were also refused permission to visit on 23 February 1999. On 23 February 1999 the applicant appeared before an Ankara State Security Court judge, who ordered him to be placed in pre-trial detention… It was not until the hearing on 4 June 1999 that the State Security Court gave the applicant permission to consult the case file under the supervision of two registrars and authorized his lawyers to provide him with a copy of certain documents. On 29 June 1999 Ankara State Security Court found the applicant guilty of carrying out actions calculated to bring about the separation of a part of Turkish territory and of forming and leading an armed gang to achieve that end. It sentenced him to death, under Article 125 of the Criminal Code. That decision was upheld by the Court of Cassation. Under Law no. 4771, published on 9 August 2002, the Turkish Assembly resolved to abolish the death penalty in peacetime. On 3 October 2002 Ankara State Security Court commuted the applicant’s death sentence to life imprisonment. Decision of the Court Right to have lawfulness of detention decided speedily by a court Human Rights Foundation of Turkey Turkey Human Rights Report – 2005 The Government had raised a preliminary objection that the applicant had failed to exhaust his domestic remedies under this head. However, the Grand Chamber saw no reason to depart from the Chamber’s findings in this respect, notably as to the impossibility for the applicant in the circumstances in which he found himself while in police custody to have effective recourse to the remedy indicated by the Government. Nor could the possibility of obtaining compensation satisfy the requirement of a judicial remedy to determine the lawfulness of detention. The applicant did not therefore have an effective remedy available to him and there had accordingly been a violation of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention. No unlawful deprivation of liberty The Grand Chamber agreed with the Chamber that the applicant’s arrest on 15 February 1999 and his detention had been in accordance with “a procedure prescribed by law” and that there had, therefore, been no violation of Article 5 § 1. Right to be brought promptly before a judge The Grand Chamber found that the total period spent by the applicant in police custody before being brought before a judge came to a minimum of seven days. It could not accept that it was necessary for the applicant to be detained for such a period without being brought before a judge. There had accordingly been a violation of Article 5 § 3. Fair trial Whether Ankara State Security Court was independent and impartial The Grand Chamber noted that the military judge on the bench of Ankara State Security Court which convicted the applicant had been replaced on 23 June 1999. However, the replacement of the military judge before the end of the proceedings could not dispose of the applicant’s reasonably held concern about the trial court’s independence and impartiality. There had been a violation of Article 6 § 1 in this respect. Whether the proceedings before the State Security Court were fair The Grand Chamber agreed with the Chamber’s findings that the applicant’s trial was unfair because: he had no assistance from his lawyers during questioning in police custody; he was unable to communicate with his lawyers out of the hearing of third parties; he was unable to gain direct access to the case file until a very late stage in the proceedings; restrictions were imposed on the number and length of his lawyers’ visits; and his lawyers were not given proper access to the case file until late in the day. The Grand Chamber found that the overall effect of those difficulties taken as a whole had so restricted the rights of the defense that the principle of a fair trial, as set out in Article 6, had been contravened. This amounted Human Rights Foundation of Turkey The Kurdish Question to a violation of Article 6 § 1, taken together with Article 6 § 3 (b) and (c). The Grand Chamber further held that it was unnecessary to examine the other complaints under Article 6 relating to the fairness of the proceedings. Treatment and conditions Conditions of the applicant’s transfer from Kenya to Turkey The Grand Chamber considered that it had not been established ‘beyond all reasonable doubt’ that the applicant’s arrest and the conditions in which he was transferred from Kenya to Turkey exceeded the usual degree of humiliation that was inherent in every arrest and detention or attained the minimum level of severity required for Article 3 to apply. Consequently, there had been no violation of Article 3 on that account. Detention conditions on İmralı While concurring with the Council of Europe’s Committee for the Prevention of Torture’s recommendations that the long-term effects of the applicant’s relative social isolation should be attenuated by giving him access to the same facilities as other high security prisoners in Turkey, such as television and telephone contact with his family, the Grand Chamber agreed with the Chamber that the general conditions in which the applicant was being detained at İmralı Prison had not reached the minimum level of severity required to constitute inhuman or degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3. Consequently, there had been no violation of Article 3 on that account. End of the press statement of the ECoHR. In January the HRA and the lawyers of Abdullah Öcalan separately applied to the Justice Minister to have an independent team of experts examine the health situation of Abdullah Öcalan. At the same time newspapers reported that Öcalan was visited by a psychologist every fortnight. Quoting sources of the Justice Ministry it was also stated that the room Abdullah Öcalan was staying in was well equipped with sufficient light and air and that he had possibilities of cultural and sports activities, benefited from health services and had the right for fresh air, read books and newspapers and listen to the radio. Aysel Tuğluk stated as one of Abdullah Öcalan's lawyers that they did not ask for a psychologist. Their client had complained of problems with breathing and they had asked for experts to examine him on this connection. Justice Minister Cemil Çiçek answered a question tabled by CHP deputy from Antalya, Osman Özcan on whether a ship had been provided for the lawyers of Abdullah Öcalan to visit him on the island. The Minister said that on 23 September 2004 the ship called \"Tuzla\" had been ordered at the disposal of the 17 Turkey Human Rights Report – 2005 lawyers for their visits. The ship had to be repaired to be used under all kinds of weather conditions. On 16 February the lawyers of Abdullah Öcalan declared that they had not been able to meet their client since 19 January. The next visit was only possible on 24 February. During the year many visits of Abdullah Öcalan's lawyers and relatives did not take place either because of bad weather or because of irregularities of the ships. When reports appeared in the press that the prison conditions of Abdullah Öcalan were absolutely comfortable, Bekir Kaya, one of Abdullah Öcalan's lawyers made a declaration and stated: \"Abdullah Öcalan is held in a cell of 13 not 19 square meters. He is allowed one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening to go out for fresh air. It is not true that he is doing sports. He is only walking. We are only allowed to take as much as two newspapers a day with a choice among Milliyet, Hürriyet, Sabah and Radikal. He is allowed only three books at a time. There is no right for open (not supervised) visits and phone calls. Our demand to have a TV was rejected. There is no possibility to provide food, only clothes are allowed. Our client does not benefit from the canteen and shares the same food with the personnel. Compared to the F-type prisons the conditions of our client are worse.\" During a press conference on 26 January the deputy chief of the General Staff, İlker Başbuğ alleged that Abdullah Öcalan was directing the PKK from prison. He complained that no measures were taken against the lawyers. Following this declaration news appeared in the press that investigations had been launched against 25 lawyers on charges of exceeding the limit of defense lawyers and holding press conferences. On 18 February lawyer Okan Yıldız from the Century Law Office stated in the daily Özgür Politika that all lawyers of the office were under prosecution and lawyers who went to visit Abdullah Öcalan just once were subjected to investigations under the assumption that they were members of an illegal organization. The lawyer added: \"After each visit investigations start. These cases restrict our right of defense. The dailies Tercüman and Vatan publish false stories after each visit. We never made any declaration to these papers, but we are held responsible for the false news.\" According to the new code of criminal procedures (TCPC) that entered into force on 1 June 12 lawyers were banned from visiting Abdullah Öcalan for one year. İstanbul Heavy Penal Court No. 9 took the decision on 16 June and stated that in connection with Article 7/2 of the ATL the lawyers Aysel Tuğluk, İrfan Dündar, Ahmet Avşar, Doğan Erbaş, Hatice Korkut, Aydın Oruç, Mahmut Şakar and Türkan Aslan had been banned from acting as defense lawyers of Abdullah Öcalan for one year according to Article 18 The Kurdish Question 151/3 of the TCPC. A similar decision was taken by İstanbul Heavy Penal Court No. 14 on 22 June. The Court banned the lawyers Okan Yıldız, Bekir Kaya, Devrim Barış Baran and Fırat Aydınkaya for one year from acting as defense lawyers of Abdullah Öcalan. On 7 February lawyer İrfan Dündar testified at İstanbul Heavy Penal Court No. 12 on charges of being a member of an illegal organization and having forwarded instructions of his client to the organization. The Court lifted the arrest warrant issued in absentia. After testifying İrfan Dündar said that all lawyers were indicted under the same accusation, but there was no such thing as Öcalan giving directives to them or anybody else, because their talks were always conducted in the presence of officials. On 29 March Diyarbakır Heavy Penal Court No. 4 started to hear the case of İrfan Dündar and Mahmut Şakar, defense lawyers of Abdullah Öcalan, on charges of being members of an illegal organization. The hearing was adjourned under the directive to have the testimony of the defendants been taken in İstanbul On 31 March Ankara Heavy Penal Court No. 11 acquitted İrfan Dündar, Mahmut Şakar and Mehmet Salih Yıldız, Mayor of Yüksekova from charges of supporting an illegal organization with speeches they made on Med TV in 1999.
