LATE ON March 4th, amid a volley of rubber bullets, clouds of tear gas and water cannons, Turkish police stormed the headquarters of Zaman, a daily newspaper, clearing the way for its takeover by a panel of court-appointed trustees. “The constitution has been suspended”, the paper’s front page mournfully proclaimed on Saturday morning. The next day, its first under new management, the cover featured a photo of a smiling Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president; a story about an upcoming Women’s Day reception at his $615m presidential palace; and news of the construction of a new bridge over the Bosporus strait. Overnight, a staunchly critical newspaper with the highest circulation in Turkey appeared to have become a government mouthpiece.
