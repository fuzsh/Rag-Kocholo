        "text": "Members of the Royal Family are spending their first summer break at Balmoral without the Queen as they momentarily pause their public engagements for a few weeks.\n\nBut while King Charles and Queen Camilla plan to spend their summer in Scotland, it is not clear whether one member of the Royal Family will be present as he is currently on holiday on the French Riviera. Prince Michael of Kent, first cousin of Queen Elizabeth and grandson of George V, is spending time with Princess Camilla of Bourbon Two Sicilies and her family in Saint-Tropez.\n\nThe 81-year-old, wearing a lilac shirt and blue shirt, posed with Princess Camilla, 52, for a photo that she shared online with the caption \"Happy moments\". They were joined by Camilla's husband, Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro, at the beachfront gastro bar Le Club 55. Princess Camilla's daughters, Princess Maria Carolina, 20, and Princess Maria Chiara, 18, were also pictured in Saint-Tropez.\n\nPrince Michael was also pictured attending a summer party with Princess Camilla and other guests. He appeared to have attended the party on his own, as his wife, Princess Michael of Kent, or his children, Lady Gabriella Kingston and Lord Frederick Windsor, were not seen in the photos.\n\nPrincess Camilla has good links with the British Royal Family and when the Queen died last year, she paid tribute to the late monarch. She said: \"We have been privileged to meet Her Majesty on a number of occasions and will forever treasure the time that we have spent with her.\"\n\nIt is not clear if Prince Michael will later join royals at Balmoral after returning from Saint-Tropez. Over the coming weeks, King Charles and Camilla are expected to welcome a number of guests at Balmoral Castle, carrying on a tradition that was much-loved by Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales will join the King and Queen with their three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. Other guests expected to travel to Balmoral are Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Zara Tindall.\n\nPrincess Camilla's holiday with her family on the French Riviera comes amid speculation that her daughter Chiara may be dating Prince Christian of Denmark, the eldest son of Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary. The pair were pictured together at the Monaco Grand Prix in May and an insider claimed that Christian reportedly introduced his rumoured girlfriend to his grandmother Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.\n\nAccording to Now To Love, the source said: \"Chiara was presented to Queen Margrethe over the summer and they all took tea together. \"Christian knew they'd hit it off and was thrilled that she invited them to tea. It's an informal stamp of approval for Chiara because Margrethe doesn't take tea with just anyone. However, she does take very seriously her lineage and takes it as her duty to invest time in Christian's happiness and his choice of partner.\"\n\nResponding to the claims, Princess Chiara told the Danish press: \"We have a beautiful friendship and have a lot of fun together.\" Prince Christian has not addressed the rumours publicly."
