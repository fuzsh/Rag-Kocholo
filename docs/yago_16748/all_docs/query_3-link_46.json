        "text": "Maria Sophie (1841-1925), Queen of the Two Sicilies and her husband, King Francis II of the Two Sicilies, took refuge in the coastal fortress of Gaeta.\n\nThey were besieged by Victor Emmanuel II.\n\nMaria Sophie fought tirelessly to keep up the spirits of the defenders.\n\nShe received the nickname of Warrior-Queen.\n\nThe fortress fell. Francis II and Maria Sophie were exiled to Rome.\n\n​\n\nThe duke and duchess of Noto became parents of their 7th child, a daughter named Maria.

I have no idea where they get their information from and I am not able to find anything else online.\n\nTwo Sicilies\n\nAll I could find on the Children of TRH The Duke and Duchess of Noto from Wiki and April 21st as the date\n\nDon Jaime de Borbón-Dos Sicilias, Duque de Capua, 26th of June 1993.\n\nJuan de Borbón-Dos Sicilias, 18th of April 2003.\n\nPablo de Borbón-Dos Sicilias, 26th of June 2004.\n\nPedro de Borbon-Dos Sicilias, 3rd of January 2007.\n\nSofía de Borbon-Dos Sicilias, 12th of November 2008.\n\nBlanche de Borbon-Dos Sicilias,7th of April 2011.\n\nMaria de Borbon-Dos Sicilias, 21st of April 2015.\n\nHRH the Duke of Capua's visit to Naples seem to be a great succes these days.\n\nHe also visited Caserta. Some photos and an article of the visits from Noblesse & Royautes:\n\nhttp://www.noblesseetroyautes.com/w...260_656407251127121_7495118397002598474_n.jpg\n\nhttp://www.noblesseetroyautes.com/w...013_656407361127110_5879534011910975716_n.jpg\n\nhttp://www.noblesseetroyautes.com/w...702_656412997793213_2472840111871455747_n.jpg\n\nhttp://www.noblesseetroyautes.com/w...666_656407621127084_4081136333508092442_n.jpg\n\nLe duc de Capoue en visite à Caserte et Naples\n\nTheir first Child was born before their wedding .\n\nI saw pictures of the actual Duke of Calabria , he looks not healty and all , his mother Duchess Alice is still alive (97).\n\nHe was in a wheelchair recently at an event and looked very frail of late.\n\nNo reaction of the Duke of Castro to this visit of the Duke of Capua to Naples?\n\nDoes the Duke of Castro often comment on the Duke of Capua's visits and engagements? (I'm not being off by the way, just genuinely curious.)"
