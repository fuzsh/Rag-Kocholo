However, some inaccurate information has been disseminated.\"\n\nMaria, 18, said that while the speculation initially amused her, she felt inclined to address the situation once and for all.\n\n\"At first, this situation made me smile; however, over time, this rumor has exceeded the limits of common sense and has spiraled becoming at odds with reality,\" she added. \"I believe it is now time to put an end to this rumor.\"\n\nAnd to her supporters, Maria concluded her message by saying she would keep them updated on her happily ever after."
