        "text": "Do you ever find yourself looking at an aggressively giant hat and thinking to yourself, wow, you know who this would look good on? Literally no one, but maybe Princess Beatrice!, person who loves hats and has the budget to buy as many as she wants due to being truly loaded.\n\nDespite not being a \"working royal,\" Princess Beatrice has a bank account full of twopence, farthings, halfpennies, and other extremely British coins–and her net worth is pretty impressive. Time to go through her income streams (hint: multiple trust funds) to find out how she affords all these freaking hats.\n\nShe Got a Trust Fund When Her Parents Divorced\n\nIf you don't make millions off the end of your parents' marriage, you're simply doing it wrong! Bea and her sister Eugenie got a ton of money during disgraced royal Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson's divorce in the mid-'90s. How, you ask? Basically, the terms of the divorce stipulated a trust be set up for Fergie and her daughters, and they reportedly got £3 million from the British royal family as part of the settlement. £1.4 million of that went into a trust for Beatrice and Eugenie, and Fergie (presumably) kept the rest.\n\nShe Also Has a Trust Fund From Her Great-Grandma\n\nWhat, your great-grandmother didn't leave you a giant sum of money? Me neither, so we can be bitter together. Lucky for Beatrice, her great-grandmother (aka Queen Elizabeth's mom, the Queen Mother) decided to leave her great-grandchildren most of her assets. In 1994, the Queen Mother went ahead and put £19 million (approximately two thirds of her money) into a trust fund for this generation—and guess who got most of it? According to The Guardian, that'd be Prince William and Prince Harry, who split £6 million of the trust at age 21 (Harry got most of it because he doesn't get all the perks that come with being a future king) and get to split another £8 million when they turn 40. Note: Prince William turned 40 this year, so TBD on if he already has his share or if he has to wait for Harry to turn 40 as well.\n\nEither way, that leaves about £5 million for Her Majesty's other grandchildren—though presumably that amount is higher these days. Depending on how these funds were invested, £5 million can do a lot of growing in ~30 years.\n\nShe's Had a Few Actual Jobs\n\nBefore we get to Beatrice's 9 to 5, please be advised that while she is a royal who works, she isn't a \"working royal.\" Meaning that unlike her cousin Prince William, Princess Beatrice doesn't get money from the Sovereign Grant—taxpayer money that covers salaries for royals who do public engagements on behalf of the Queen.\n\nBecause she isn't busy working for the Crown, Beatrice has had time for other full-time jobs over the years, including at Sony Pictures (where her salary was leaked during the Sony hack...interestingly, it was relatively low) and at software company Afiniti, where she worked as Vice President of Strategic Partnerships.\n\nShe Got Caught Up in Some $ Drama With Her Dad\n\nThis whole thing is very complicated, but Prince Andrew was recently accused of fraud by Turkish millionaire Nebahat Evyap Isbilen, and both Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice were named in the case. More details here, but per The Telegraph, Isbilen accused former Goldman Sachs banker Selman Turk of taking £40 million, and allegedly included in that was a £750,000 payment transferred into Prince Andrew's account and described as a wedding gift for Princess Beatrice. Beatrice was unaware of all this, and the money has since been paid back.\n\nSo, What Is Princess Beatrice's Net Worth?"
