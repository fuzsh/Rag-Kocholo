        "text": "Carlos IV (November 11, 1748 – January 20, 1819) was King of Spain and ruler of the Spanish Empire from 1788 to 1808.\n\nEarly life\n\nCarlos IV was the second son of King Carlos III of Spain and his wife, Princess Maria Amalia of Saxony, the daughter of King Augustus III of Poland, (Prince-Elector Friedrich August II of Saxony) and Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria, herself daughter of Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor. Her mother was the first cousin of Empress Maria Theresa.\n\nInfante Carlos was born in Naples (November 11, 1748), while his father was King of Naples and Sicily. His elder brother, Don Felipe, was passed over for both thrones, due to his learning disabilities and epilepsy.\n\nHis father was also Duke of Parma and Piacenza, as Carlo I (1731–1735); King of Naples, as Carlo VII; and King of Sicily, as Carlo III (1735–1759). He was the fourth son of King Felipe V of Spain and the eldest son of Felipe’s second wife, Elisabeth Farnese.\n\nIn Naples and Sicily, Infante Carlos was referred to as the Prince of Taranto. He was called El Cazador (meaning “the Hunter”), due to his preference for sport and hunting, rather than dealing with affairs of the state. Carlos is considered by historian Stanley G. Payne as “good-hearted but weak and simple-minded.”\n\nIn 1762, Princess Maria Luisa of Parma became engaged to her cousin Infante Carlos, Prince of Asturias, later King Carlos IV of Spain. Maria Luisa of Parma the youngest daughter of Philip, Duke of Parma, the fourth son of King Felipe V of Spain, and Princess Louise Élisabeth of France, the eldest daughter of King Louis XV of France and Navarre and his Polish-born wife, Queen Marie Leczinska.\n\nWhen Princess Maria Luisa’s elder sister, Princess Isabella died in 1763, there were suggestions that Princess Maria Luisa marry her sister’s widower, Emperor Joseph II, but the proposal was refused and her engagement to the Infante Carlos, Prince of Asturias was confirmed. The wedding took place on September 4, 1765 in La Granja Palace.\n\nInfante Carlos succeeded to the Spanish throne in 1759 upon the death of his childless half-brother King Fernando VI. As King Carlos III of Spain, he made far-reaching reforms to increase the flow of funds to the crown and defend against foreign incursions on the empire.\n\nIn 1788, King Carlos III of Spain died and his second son, Infante Carlos, succeeded to the throne as King Carlos IV of and ruled for the next two decades. Even though he had a profound belief in the sanctity of the monarchy and kept up the appearance of an absolute, powerful king, Carlos IV never took more than a passive part in his own government.\n\nThe affairs of government were left to his wife, Maria Luisa, and the man he appointed first minister, Manuel de Godoy. Charles occupied himself with hunting in the period that saw the outbreak of the French Revolution, the executions of his Bourbon relative Louis XVI of France and his queen, Archduchess Marie Antoinette of Austria, and the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nRiots, and a popular revolt at the winter palace Aranjuez, in 1808 forced the king to abdicate on March 19, in favor of his son. Infante Fernando, Prince of Asturias, took the throne as King Fernando VII of Spain, but was mistrusted by Napoleon, who had 100,000 soldiers stationed in Spain by that time due to the ongoing War of the Third Coalition.\n\nThe ousted King Carlos IV, having appealed to Napoleon for help in regaining his throne, was summoned before Napoleon in Bayonne, along with his son, in April 1808. Napoleon forced both King Carlos IV and his son, King Fernando VII to abdicate, declared the Bourbon dynasty of Spain deposed, and installed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as King Joseph I of Spain, which began the Peninsular War.\n\nAfter a decade of constant warfare, France and Britain signed the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802, bringing the Revolutionary Wars to an end.\n\nWith Europe at peace and the economy recovering, Bonaparte’s popularity soared to its highest levels under the consulate, both domestically and abroad. In a new plebiscite during the spring of 1802, the French public came out in huge numbers to approve a constitution that made the Consulate permanent, essentially elevating Bonaparte to dictator for life.\n\nDuring the time of the consulate, Napoleon faced several royalist and Jacobin assassination plots, including the Conspiration des poignards (Dagger plot) in October 1800 and the Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise (also known as the Infernal Machine) two months later.\n\nIn January 1804, his police uncovered an assassination plot against him that was ostensibly sponsored by the Bourbon family, the former rulers of France. On the advice of Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, Napoleon ordered the kidnapping of Prince Louis Antoinede Bourbon of France, Duke of Enghien, violating the sovereignty of Baden.\n\nPrince Louis Antoine de Bourbon, Duke of Enghien (August 2, 1772 – March 21, 1804) was a member of the House of Bourbon of France. Napoleon Bonaparte, brought charges against him of aiding Britain and plotting against Napoleon.\n\nPrince Louis Antoine de Bourbon, Duke of Enghien was the only son of Louis Henri de Bourbon and Bathilde d’Orléans. As a member of the reigning House of Bourbon, he was a Prince du Sang (Prince of the Blood).\n\nHis mother’s full name was Louise Marie Thérèse Bathilde d’Orléans; she was the only surviving daughter of Louis Philippe d’Orléans (grandson of the Regent Philippe II Duc d’Orléans) and Louise Henriette de Bourbon. His uncle was the future Philippe Égalité and he was thus a first cousin of the future Louis-Philippe I, King of the French.\n\nHe was also doubly descended from King Louis XIV of France and Navarre through his legitimated daughters, Mademoiselle de Blois and Mademoiselle de Nantes.\n\nPrince Louis Antoine de Bourbon, Duke of Enghien was quickly executed after a secret military trial, even though he had not been involved in the plot. Enghien’s execution infuriated royal courts throughout Europe, becoming one of the contributing political factors for the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nTo expand his power, Napoleon used these assassination plots to justify the creation of an imperial system based on the Roman model. He believed that a Bourbon restoration would be more difficult if his family’s succession was entrenched in the constitution.\n\nLaunching yet another referendum, Napoleon was elected as Emperor of the French by a tally exceeding 99%. As with the Life Consulate two years earlier, this referendum produced heavy participation, bringing out almost 3.6 million voters to the polls.\n\nA keen observer of Bonaparte’s rise to absolute power, Madame de Rémusat, explains that “men worn out by the turmoil of the Revolution […] looked for the domination of an able ruler” and that “people believed quite sincerely that Bonaparte, whether as consul or emperor, would exert his authority and save [them] from the perils of anarchy.”\n\nCoronation\n\nNapoleon’s coronation, at which Pope Pius VII officiated, took place at Notre Dame de Paris, on December 2, 1804. Napoleon wore a golden laurel wreath throughout the proceedings, representing victory, peace and civic virtue. For the coronation, he raised a replica of Charlemagne’s crown over his own head in a symbolic gesture, but did not wear it atop the wreath.\n\nAll present rose spontaneously, the men waving their hats. Joséphine, Napoleon’s wife, knelt in front of him to receive her crown on her head, the event commemorated in the official painting by Jacques-Louis David. Joséphine became only the second queen to be crowned and anointed in French history, other than Marie de’ Medici.\n\nNapoleon was then crowned King of Italy, with the Iron Crown of Lombardy, at the Cathedral of Milan on May 26, 1805. He created eighteen Marshals of the Empire from among his top generals to secure the allegiance of the army on May 18, 1804, the official start of the French Empire.\n\nOne interesting fact about Duke Friedrich II of Württemberg is that he was known for his size, at 2.12 m (6 ft 11 in) and about 200 kg (440 lb).\n\nIn 1800, the French army occupied Württemberg and Duke Friedrich II and Duchess Charlotte of Württemberg fled to Vienna to the court of Holy Roman Emperor Franz II. The following year, Duke Friedrich II concluded a private treaty that ceded Montbéliard to France and brought him Ellwangen in exchange two years later.\n\nIn 1803 came the great Reichsdeputationshauptschluss which was basically a reorganizing of the territories of the Empire through secularization and mediatization. Sometimes referred to in English as the Final Recess or the Imperial Recess of 1803. This resolution was passed by the Reichstag (Imperial Diet) of the Holy Roman Empire on March 24, 1803. It was ratified by Emperor Franz II and became law on April 27th. It proved to be the last significant law enacted by the Empire before its dissolution in 1806.\n\nDuke Friedrich II then assumed the title Prince-Elector of Württemberg on February 25, 1803, and he was the first and only Prince-Elector of Württemberg from 1803 to 1806, before the raising of Württemberg to a kingdom in 1806 with the approval of Emperor Napoleon I.\n\nIn exchange for providing France with a large auxiliary force, Napoleon recognized the Prince-Elector as King Friedrich of Württemberg on December 26, 1805. Princess-Electress Charlotte became Queen of Württemberg when her husband formally ascended the throne on January 1, 1806.\n\nThe newly elevated King of Württemberg’s alliance with France technically made him the enemy of his father-in-law, King George III (now King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain). King George III, incensed by his son-in-law’s assumption of the Royal title and his role as one of Napoleon’s most devoted vassals, accordingly refused to address his daughter as “Queen of Württemberg” in correspondence.\n\nIn 1813, King Friedrich changed sides and went over to the Allies, where his status as the brother-in-law of the Prince Regent (later King George IV) helped his standing. After the fall of Napoleon, he attended the Congress of Vienna where his position as King of Württemberg was confirmed. King Friedrich of Württemberg died childless on October 30, 1816.\n\nHe was succeeded by his eldest son Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Württemberg, (known as “Fritz” until the beginning of his reign) by his first wife, Duchess Augusta of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttle (1764–1788) eldest child of Charles Wilhelm Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttle and Princess Augusta of Great Britain, the elder sister of George III of the United Kingdom. She was named in honour of her mother and grandmother. Augusta was the eldest of seven children, and her younger sister, Princess Caroline, would marry the future George IV of the United Kingdom.\n\nAlthough in King Friedrich’s declining years, he and his son no longer had any political and personal conflicts, Prince Friedrich Wilhelm was eager to display a new era of political change and power. As such, he did away with his first name of Friedrich and chose his second name of Wilhelm as his regnal name. He could have just as easily reigned as King Friedrich II of Württemberg.\n\nDowager Queen\n\nThe Dowager Queen Charlotte of Württemberg continued to live at the Ludwigsburg Palace, near Stuttgart, and received visits from her younger siblings, Prince Edward, the Duke of Kent, Prince Augustus Frederick, the Duke of Sussex, Prince Adolphus Frederick, the Duke of Cambridge, the Landgravine Princess Elizabeth of Hesse-Homburg, and Princess Augusta Sophia. She was a godmother (by proxy) at the christening of her niece, Princess Alexandria Victoria of Kent (the future Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom), in 1819.\n\nIn 1827, Charlotte returned to Britain for the first time since her wedding in 1797. By that time, the sixty year old princess was very heavy and wanted to have surgery for dropsy in England. Steam propulsion had just been introduced on the Rhine, and ensured that the voyage back home would be convenient.\n\nOn May 31 she embarked on the new steamboat Friedrich Wilhelm. After descending the Rhine the steamboat arrived at Bath on the Western Scheldt. Due to her weight, Charlotte had to be lifted aboard Royal Sovereign on a chair that was hoisted. Due to bad weather, Royal Sovereign then had to leave Bath, and anchor near Vlissingen.\n\nOn June 5, Dowager Queen Charlotte was in Greenwich. In London, she resided at St James’s Palace, where she received many visits from her family. Her brother, now King George IV, made a final visit from Windsor Castle on October 6th.\n\nOn Tuesday October 9th, Charlotte left England on board Royal Sovereign, but a storm forced her back into Harwich. On the 14th, Royal Sovereign anchored before Klundert on the Hollands Diep. After spending the night on board, Charlotte embarked on the steamboat Stad Nijmegen.\n\nOn October 19, she arrived in Frankfurt, where she met King Wilhelm I of Württemberg and Queen Pauline of Württemberg and her brother Prince Adolphus Frederick, the Duke of Cambridge.\n\nQueen Pauline of Württemberg was born in Riga, one of the five children of Duke Ludwig of Württemberg and his wife, Princess Henriette of Nassau-Weilburg. Her siblings included Maria Dorothea, Archduchess of Austria; Amelia, Duchess of Saxe-Hildburghausen; Elisabeth Alexandrine, Princess of Baden, and Duke Alexander of Württemberg himself the founder of the Teck branch of the family.\n\nOn October 24th Dowager Queen Charlotte was back at Ludwigsburg Palace. The next year on October 6, 1828 Charlotte died at Ludwigsburg Palace and is buried in its royal vault.\n\nMarriage\n\nIn 1832, King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, brother of Carolina of the Two Sicilies, Duchess of Berry, had proposed to marry his younger brother, Prince Antonio, Count of Lecce who was 16 years old, to Louise Marie Thérèse d’Artois who was then 13. The plans fizzled.\n\nPrince Antonio quickly became known for his restless behavior. By age sixteen in 1832, he was already a consummate womanizer. The marriage negotiation failed as Princess Carolina, the Duchess of Angoulême opposed the union.\n\nPrincess Carolina, the Duchess of Angoulême also discarded the idea of marrying her niece to any Austrian Archduke. She was adamant that Louise Marie Thèrésa should marry a Bourbon. As there were very few princes to choose from, Louise Marie Thèrésa reached twenty-five still unmarried and at an advanced age for a single Princess of her time.\n\nFinally in 1845, Princess Carolina, the Duchess of Angoulême arranged her marriage to Hereditary Prince Charles Louis of Lucca, the future Duke Charles III of Parma.\n\nA few years younger than Louise Marie Thèrésa, Charles Louis used to spend some summers near Froshdorf and they had met when they were still children.\n\nCharles III, Duke of Parma, was born at the Villa delle Pianore near Lucca on 14 January 1823, the only son of Charles Louis, Prince of Lucca, (later Duke of Lucca, and Duke Charles II of Parma) and his wife Princess Maria Teresa of Savoy (daughter of King Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia and his wife, Archduchess Maria Teresa of Austria-Este herself the daughter of the daughter of Archduke Ferdinand Charles of Austria-Este, and Maria Beatrice d’Este, Duchess of Massa.\n\nHe was given the baptismal names Ferdinand Charles Victor Joseph Maria Baldassarre. Until his accession as Duke of Parma in 1849, he was called Ferdinand Charles or Ferdinand. His family called him Danduccio.\n\nAt the death of his grandmother, Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain, Duchess of Lucca, on March 13, 1824, Ferdinand Charles became the Hereditary Prince of Lucca.\n\nHereditary Prince Ferdinand Charles of Lucca, the future Duke Charles III of Parma was a member of the House of Bourbon-Parma, a sub-branch of the House of Bourbon-Spain, itself originally a branch of the House of Bourbon, and thus of the Capetian Dynasty and earlier a descendent of the Robertians.\n\nDuke Charles III’s patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son. It follows the Dukes of Parma as well as the Kings of Spain, France, and Navarre. The line can be traced back more than 1,200 years from Robert of Hesbaye to the present day, through Kings of France & Navarre, Spain and Two-Sicilies, Dukes of Parma and Grand-Dukes of Luxembourg, Princes of Orléans and Emperors of Brazil. It is one of the oldest in Europe.\n\nOn November 10, 1845, at Schloss Frohsdorf in Austria, Louise Marie Thèrésa married Hereditary Prince Ferdinand Charles of Lucca.\n\nThe Duchy of Lucca was incorporated in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and she and her husband became known as Hereditary Prince and Hereditary Princess of Parma.\n\nIn December 1847, at the death of Empress Marie Louise, his father became the reigning Duke Charles II of Parma. His reign in Parma as Duke Charles II was brief. He was ill-received by his new subjects and within a few months he was ousted by a revolution.\n\nEmpress Marie Louise was the eldest child of Franz II, Holy Roman Emperor and Emperor of Austria, and his second wife, Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily. She was also the second wife of was Napoleon Bonaparte , Emperor of the French, and as such was the Empress of the French and Queen of Italy from their marriage on April 1, 1810 until his abdication on April 6, 1814.\n\nIn August 1848 the Austrian army entered Parma, and officially restored Duke Charles II. Ferdinand Charles and his wife Princess Louise Marie Thèrésa and family, however, remained in England, since hostilities continued between the Austrian and Piedmontese armies. For several years Charles II had considered abdicating in favor of Ferdinand Charles, but he delayed in the hope that when he did so things would be more secure for his son.\n\nOn April 9, the regency transformed into a provisional government. Only four months after regaining the throne of his ancestors, Charles II was forced to flee from Italy, finding refuge in the castle of Weistropp in Saxony. On April 19, 1848, Charles abdicated in favor of his son, living in exile in Great Britain.\n\nDuke Charles III owed his throne to the support of Austrian troops. He placed Parma under martial law, inflicted heavy penalties on the members of the late provisional government, closed the university, and instituted a regular policy of persecution. His authoritarian policies made him unpopular.\n\nHis arbitrary decisions destroyed the respect that his subjects had for him and his dynasty and he became unpopular. By 1853 there were rumors of plots to remove him from power.\n\nHis personal life was also in turmoil. He grew apart from his wife, Princess Louise Marie Thèrésa, Duchess of Parma who became exceedingly fat. The Duchess was a sharp-tongued woman who liked having her way through intrigues and the force of her personality.\n\nThe rift between husband and wife grew when Charles III openly began an affair with Countess Emma Guadagni (1829–1866), a sister-in-law of the Austrian general governor of Trento. They met in Florence in February 1852, while Charles III was a guest of Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany.\n\nIn a semi-official visit to Queen Isabella II of Spain in December 1853, Charles III took his mistress with him, bringing about the final breakdown of his marriage. In mid February 1854, Charles III returned to Parma.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm III (August 3, 1770 – June 7, 1840) was King of Prussia from November 16, 1797 until his death in 1840. He was concurrently Prince-Elector of Brandenburg in the Holy Roman Empire until August 6,1806, when the Empire was dissolved. After the end of the Holy Roman Empire the title reverted to Margrave of Brandenburg.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm was born in Potsdam on August 3, 1770 as the son of King Friedrich Wilhelm II of Prussia and Princess Frederica Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt, the daughter of Ludwig IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, and Countess Palatine Caroline of Zweibrücken. She was born in Prenzlau. She was the sister of Grand Duchess Louise of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, as well as Landgrave Ludwig X of Hesse-Darmstad, who later was the first Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm was considered to be a shy and reserved boy, which became noticeable in his particularly reticent conversations, distinguished by the lack of personal pronouns. This manner of speech subsequently came to be considered entirely appropriate for military officers. He was neglected by his father during his childhood and suffered from an inferiority complex his entire life.\n\nOn December 24, 1793, Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm married in the Kronprinzenpalais (Crown Prince’s Palace) in Berlin, to his cousin Princess Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the fourth daughter and sixth child of Duke Charles of Mecklenburg and his wife Princess Friederike of Hesse-Darmstadt. Her father Charles was a brother of Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III of the United Kingdom, and her mother Frederike was a granddaughter of Ludwig VIII, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt.\n\nHer maternal grandmother, Landgravine Marie Louise of Hesse-Darmstadt, and her paternal first-cousin Princess Augusta Sophia of the United Kingdom served as sponsors at her baptism; her second given name came from Princess Augusta Sophia.\n\nAt the time of her birth, Louise’s father was not yet the ruler of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (he would not succeed his brother as Duke until 1794), and consequently she was not born in a court, but rather in a less formal home.\n\nLouise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz bore him ten children. Friedrich Wilhelm lived a civil life with a problem-free marriage, which did not change even when he became King of Prussia in 1797. His wife Louise was particularly loved by the Prussian people, which boosted the popularity of the whole House of Hohenzollern, including the King himself.\n\nReign\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm succeeded to the throne on November 16, 1797 as King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia. He also became, in personal union, the sovereign prince of the Principality of Neuchâtel (1797–1806 and again 1813–1840). At once, the new King showed that he was earnest of his good intentions by cutting down the royal establishment’s expenses, dismissing his father’s ministers, and reforming the most oppressive abuses of the late reign. He had the Hohenzollern determination to retain personal power but not the Hohenzollern genius for using it.\n\nToo distrustful to delegate responsibility to his ministers, he greatly reduced the effectiveness of his reign since he was forced to assume the roles he did not delegate. This is the main factor of his inconsistent rule.\n\nDisgusted with his father’s court (in both political intrigues and sexual affairs), Friedrich Wilhelm III’s first and most successful early endeavor was to restore his dynasty’s moral legitimacy. The eagerness to restore dignity to his family went so far that it nearly caused sculptor Johann Gottfried Schadow to cancel the expensive and lavish Prinzessinnengruppe project, which was commissioned by the previous monarch Friedrich Wilhelm II.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm III ruled Prussia during the difficult times of the Napoleonic Wars. The king reluctantly joined the coalition against Napoleon in the Befreiungskriege. Following Napoleon’s defeat, he took part in the Congress of Vienna, which assembled to settle the political questions arising from the new, post-Napoleonic order in Europe. His primary interests were internal – the reform of Prussia’s Protestant churches. He was determined to unify the Protestant churches to homogenize their liturgy, organization, and architecture.\n\nThe long-term goal was to have fully centralized royal control of all the Protestant churches in the Prussian Union of Churches. The king was said to be extremely shy and indecisive. His wife Queen Louise (1776–1810) was his most important political advisor. She led a mighty group that included Baron vom Stein, Prince von Hardenberg, Gerhard von Scharnhorst, and Count von Gneisenau. They set about reforming Prussia’s administration, churches, finance, and military.\n\nKing Friedrich Wilhelm III was the common ancestor of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia (through his daughter Princess Charlotte, wife of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia) and German Emperor Wilhelm II (through his second son Emperor/King Wilhelm I). He was the dedicatee of Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony in 1824.\n\nIn 1824, after the death of his wife, King Friedrich Wilhelm III remarried (morganatically) Countess Auguste von Harrach, Princess of Liegnitz. They had no children.\n\nDeath\n\nKing Friedrich Wilhelm III died on June 7, 1840 in Berlin, from a fever, survived by his second wife. His eldest son succeeded him as King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia. Friedrich Wilhelm III is buried at the Mausoleum in Schlosspark Charlottenburg, Berlin.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte (August 15, 1769 – May 5, 1821), later known by his regnal name Napoleon I, was a Corsica-born French military commander and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars.\n\nHe was the de facto leader of the French Republic as First Consul from 1799 to 1804, then Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814 and again in 1815. Napoleon’s political and cultural legacy endures to this day, as a highly celebrated and controversial leader. He initiated many liberal reforms that have persisted in society, and is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history. His campaigns are still studied at military academies worldwide. Between three and six million civilians and soldiers died in what became known as the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nWar of the Sixth Coalition\n\nNapoleon assumed command in Germany and inflicted a series of defeats on the Coalition culminating in the Battle of Dresden in August 1813.\n\nDespite these successes, the numbers continued to mount against Napoleon, and the French army was pinned down by a force twice its size and lost at the Battle of Leipzig. This was by far the largest battle of the Napoleonic Wars and cost more than 90,000 casualties in total.\n\nThe Allies offered peace terms in the Frankfurt proposals in November 1813. Napoleon would remain as Emperor of the French, but it would be reduced to its “natural frontiers”. That meant that France could retain control of Belgium, Savoy and the Rhineland (the west bank of the Rhine River), while giving up control of all the rest, including all of Spain and the Netherlands, and most of Italy and Germany.\n\nMetternich told Napoleon these were the best terms the Allies were likely to offer; after further victories, the terms would be harsher and harsher. Metternich’s motivation was to maintain France as a balance against Russian threats while ending the highly destabilizing series of wars.\n\nNapoleon, expecting to win the war, delayed too long and lost this opportunity; by December the Allies had withdrawn the offer. When his back was to the wall in 1814 he tried to reopen peace negotiations on the basis of accepting the Frankfurt proposals.\n\nThe Allies now had new, harsher terms that included the retreat of France to its 1791 boundaries, which meant the loss of Belgium, but Napoleon would remain Emperor. However, he rejected the term. The British wanted Napoleon permanently removed, and they prevailed, though Napoleon adamantly refused.\n\nNapoleon withdrew into France, his army reduced to 70,000 soldiers and little cavalry; he faced more than three times as many Allied troops. Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon’s older brother, abdicated as king of Spain on December 13, 1813 and assumed the title of lieutenant general to save the collapsing empire.\n\nThe French were surrounded: British armies pressed from the south, and other Coalition forces positioned to attack from the German states. By the middle of January 1814, the Coalition had already entered France’s borders and launched a two-pronged attack on Paris, with Prussia entering from the north, and Austria from the East, marching out of the capitulated Swiss confederation.\n\nThe French Empire, however, would not go down so easily. Napoleon launched a series of victories in the Six Days’ Campaign. While they repulsed the coalition forces and delayed the capture of Paris by at least a full month, these were not significant enough to turn the tide.\n\nThe coalitionaries camped on the outskirts of the capital on March 29. A day later, they advanced onto the demoralised soldiers protecting the city. Joseph Bonaparte led a final battle at the gates of Paris. They were greatly outnumbered, as 30,000 French soldiers were pitted against a combined coalition force that was 5 times greater than theirs. They were defeated, and Joseph retreated out of the city.\n\nThe leaders of Paris surrendered to the Coalition on the last day of March 1814. On April 1, Emperor Alexander I of Russia addressed the Sénat conservateur. Long docile to Napoleon, under Talleyrand’s prodding it had turned against him. Emperor Alexander told the Sénat that the Allies were fighting against Napoleon, not France, and they were prepared to offer honourable peace terms if Napoleon were removed from power. The next day, the Sénat passed the Acte de déchéance de l’Empereur (“Emperor’s Demise Act”), which declared Napoleon deposed.\n\nWhen Napoleon proposed the army march on the capital, his senior officers and marshals mutinied. On April 4 led by Ney, the senior officers confronted Napoleon. When Napoleon asserted the army would follow him, Ney replied the army would follow its generals.\n\nWhile the ordinary soldiers and regimental officers wanted to fight on, the senior commanders were unwilling to continue. Without any senior officers or marshals, any prospective invasion of Paris would have been impossible.\n\nBowing to the inevitable, on April 4 Emperor Napoleon abdicated in favour of his son, Napoleon II, Emperor of the French, with his mother Marie Louise as regent. However, the Allies refused to accept this under prodding from Emperor Alexander, who feared that Napoleon might find an excuse to retake the throne. Napoleon was then forced to announce his unconditional abdication only two days later.\n\nCarlos IV (November 11, 1748 – January 20, 1819) was King of Spain and ruler of the Spanish Empire from 1788 to 1808.\n\nInfante Carlos was the second son of King Carlos III of Spain and his wife, Maria Amalia of Saxony. She was born a Princess of Poland and Saxony, daughter of King Augustus III of Poland (Elector Friedrich August II of Saxony) and Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria, the eldest child of Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor and Princess Wilhelmina Amalia of Brunswick-Lüneburg.\n\nInfante Carlos was born in Naples (November 11, 1748), while his father was King Carlo VII of Naples and King Carlo V of Sicily. His elder brother, Infante Felipe, was passed over for both thrones, due to his learning disabilities and epilepsy. In Naples and Sicily, Carlos was referred to as the Prince of Taranto.\n\nCarlos married his first cousin Princess Maria Louisa of Bourbon-Parma, She was the youngest daughter of Filippo, Duke of Parma, the fourth son of King Felipe V of Spain, and Princess Louise Élisabeth of France, the eldest daughter of King Louis XV of France and Navarre and Marie Leszczyńska of Poland.\n\nBorn in Parma, she was christened Luisa María Teresa Ana after her maternal grandparents and her mother’s favourite sister Anne Henriette of France, but is known to history by the short Spanish form of this name: María Luisa, while Luisa was the name she used in private.\n\nMaría Luisa’s mother tried to engage her with Louis, Duke of Burgundy, heir to the French throne. However, the young duke died in 1761. In 1762, Maria Luisa instead became engaged to her cousin Carlos, Prince of Asturias. When her elder sister Isabella died in 1763, there were suggestions that Maria Luisa marry her sister’s widower, Emperor Joseph II, but the proposal was refused and her engagement to Carlos, Prince of Asturias was confirmed.\n\nMaría Luisa was notoriously reputed to have had many love affairs. The most infamous of them was with the Prime Minister Manuel de Godoy, whom contemporary gossip singled out in particular as a long-time lover; in 1784 a member of the guard, he was promoted through several ranks when Carlos and Maria Luisa succeeded to the throne, and was appointed prime minister in 1792. Godoy was also rumored to be the natural father of several of her children.\n\nIn 1788, Carlos III died and Carlos IV succeeded to the throne and ruled for the next two decades. Even though he had a profound belief in the sanctity of the monarchy and kept up the appearance of an absolute, powerful king, Carlos never took more than a passive part in his own government.\n\nThe affairs of the government were left to his wife, Maria Luisa, and the first minister, Manuel de Godoy who was appointed by King Carlos IV himself. King Carlos IV occupied himself with hunting in the period that saw the outbreak of the French Revolution, the executions of his Bourbon relative King Louis XVI of France and his queen, Marie Antoinette, and the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte. Ideas of the Age of Enlightenment had come to Spain with the accession of the first Spanish Bourbon, Felipe V.\n\nSpain’s economic problems were of long standing, but deteriorated further when Spain was ensnared in wars that its ally France pursued. Financial needs drove his domestic and foreign policy. Godoy’s economic policies increased discontent with King Carlos IV’s regime.\n\nThe Economic troubles, the rumors about a sexual relationship between the Queen and Godoy, and the King’s ineptitude, caused the monarchy to decline in prestige among the population. Anxious to take over from his father, and jealous of the prime minister, Infante Fernando, Prince Asturias attempted to overthrow the King in an aborted coup in 1807. He was successful in 1808, forcing his father’s abdication following the Tumult of Aranjuez.\n\nRiots, and a popular revolt at the winter palace Aranjuez, in 1808 forced the king to abdicate on March 19, in favor of his son. Infante Fernando took the throne as King Fernando VII, but was mistrusted by Napoleon, who had 100,000 soldiers stationed in Spain by that time due to the ongoing War of the Third Coalition.\n\nThe ousted King, having appealed to Napoleon for help in regaining his throne, was summoned before Napoleon in Bayonne, along with his son, in April 1808. Napoleon forced both Carlos IV and his son Fernando VII to abdicate, declared the Bourbon dynasty of Spain deposed, and installed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as King José I of Spain, which began the Peninsular War.\n\nFollowing Napoleon’s deposing of the Bourbon dynasty, the ex-King, his wife, and former Prime Minister Godoy were held captive in France first at the château de Compiègne and three years in Marseille (where a neighborhood was named after him).\n\nAfter the collapse of the regime installed by Napoleon, King Fernando VII was restored to the throne. The former King Carlos IV drifted about Europe until 1812, when he finally settled in Rome, in the Palazzo Barberini. His wife died on January 2, 1819, followed shortly by Carlos, who died on January 20 of the same year.\n\nArchduchess Maria Ludovika of Austria-Este (December 14, 1787 – April 7, 1816), also known as Maria Ludovika of Modena, was Empress of Austria as the third wife of Emperor Franz I from their marriage on January 6, 1808 until her death in 1816.\n\nEarly life\n\nArchduchess Maria Ludovika was born in Monza on December 14, 1787, the daughter of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este (1754–1806) and his wife, Maria Beatrice Ricciarda d’Este (1750–1829). She was a member of the House of Austria-Este, a branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine.\n\nHer father, Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este, was a son of Holy Roman Emperor Franz I and Maria Theresa of Austria Queen of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia, Archduchess of Austria. He was the founder of the House of Austria-Este and Governor of the Duchy of Milan between 1765 and 1796. He was also designated as the heir to the Duchy of Modena and Reggio, but he never reigned, owing to the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nArchduchess Maria Ludovika and her family fled from Italy to Austria when Northern Italy was conquered by Napoleon in 1796. This caused her hostility for Napoleon. In Austria, the Emperor fell in love with her during his visits to her mother. Maria Ludovika was educated by the Countess Almesloë, whom was sent by Maria Ludovika’s grandmother Maria Theresa.\n\nMarriage\n\nOn January 6, 1808 she married her first cousin Franz I, Emperor of Austria, King of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia.They had no children. She is not to be confused with Archduchess Marie-Louise of Austria, Duchess of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla, (1791 – 1847) the eldest child of Franz II, Holy Roman Emperor and Emperor of Austria, and his second wife, Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily. Archduchess Marie-Louise was Napoleon’s second wife and as such Empress of the French and Queen of Italy from their marriage on April 1, 1810 until his abdication on April 6, 1814.\n\nEmpress Maria Ludovika, as leader of the war party in Austria, was a great enemy of the French Emperor Napoleon I of France and therefore also in opposition to the Austrian foreign minister Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich.\n\nThe French had protested against the marriage because of her political views. She had considerable influence on her husband, and her talent at ruling marvelled many officials, including the Prussian minister who considered her the ruling genius at court.\n\nAs Empress, Maria Ludovika was also immensely popular with her subjects who hailed her a second Maria Theresa. Together with her brother-in-law Archduke Johann, she made the war effort popular.\n\nDuring her coronation in Pressburg, she impressed the Hungarians so much that they declared large financial and military support for the monarchy if needed. But the Emperor hesitated and Archduke Charles, who had extensive control over military matters, advised caution. Only the effects of the Spanish revolt in 1808 allowed the war party to prevail.\n\nMetternich showed her private correspondence with her relatives to her husband, the Emperor Franz I, in the hope that it would discredit her. She was conservative in her views, suspicious of peasant revolts, but also patriotic towards her adopted land, and genuinely disturbed by atrocities that Napoleon’s armies created in Spain.\n\nThe Empress supported the war against Napoleonic France in 1808. From this year, her health deteriorated. She was opposed to the marriage between Napoleon and her step-daughter Archduchess Marie Louise in 1809. In 1812, she was a reluctant guest at the assembly of German monarchs gathered by Napoleon to celebrate his war against Russia.\n\nDeath\n\nShe was the hostess of the Congress of Vienna in 1815. When Napoleon was finally defeated she traveled at the end of the year in 1815 to her home country, North Italy, but died of tuberculosis in Verona on April 7, 1816. She was only 28 years old. She is buried in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna.\n\nFive months later on October 29, 1816, Emperor Franz I of Austria married his fourth wife, Princess Caroline Augusta of Bavaria (1792 – 1873). She was the penultimate child and third daughter of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and Princess Augusta Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt. She was firstly married to Crown Prince Wilhelm of Württemberg (King Wilhelm I) in 1808, but they divorced 1814.\n\nFrom the Emperor’s Desk: In this examination of King Carl XIV-III Johan of Sweden and Norway I will cover his marriage and election to the Swedish throne.\n\nIncidentally, when I began studying royalty I was interested in knowing if the Britis Crown had been passed down in the same family or did they ever bring in a family that was totally unrelated by Blood to previous monarchs. Although this is not Britain, for life of the future King of Sweden demonstrates such a case.\n\nCarl XIV-III Johan (January 26, 1763 – March 8, 1844) was King of Sweden and Norway from 1818 until his death in 1844. Before his reign he was a Marshal of France during the Napoleonic Wars and participated in several battles. In modern Norwegian lists of kings he is called Carl III Johan. He was the first monarch of the Bernadotte dynasty.\n\nJean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte was born on 26 January 26, 1763 in Pau, the capital of the province of Béarn in the southwestern part of the Kingdom of France. He was the son of Jean Henri Bernadotte (1711–1780), prosecutor at Pau, and his wife, Jeanne de Saint-Jean (1728–1809).\n\nThe family name was originally du Poey (or de Pouey), but was changed to Bernadotte—a surname of an ancestress at the beginning of the 17th century. He was the youngest of five siblings, two of whom died in childhood. Soon after his birth, Baptiste was added to his name, to distinguish him from his elder brother Jean Évangeliste. Bernadotte himself added Jules to his first names as a tribute to the French Empire under Napoleon I.\n\nBernadotte joined the French Royal Army in 1780. Following the outbreak of the French Revolution, he exhibited great military talent, rapidly rising through the ranks, and was made a brigadier general by 1794. He served with distinction in Italy and Germany, and was briefly Minister of War.\n\nHis relationship with Napoleon was turbulent; nevertheless, Napoleon named him a Marshal of the Empire on the proclamation of the French Empire. Bernadotte played a significant role in the French victory at Austerlitz, and was made Prince of Pontecorvo as a reward.\n\nMarriage\n\nDésirée Clary was born in Marseille, France, the daughter of François Clary (February 24, 1725 – January 20, 1794), a wealthy silk manufacturer and merchant, by his second wife Françoise Rose Somis (1737 – 1815).\n\nClary had a sister and brother to whom she remained very close all her life. Her sister, Julie Clary, married Joseph Bonaparte, and later became Queen of Naples and Spain. Her brother, Nicholas Joseph Clary, was created Count Clary. He married Anne Jeanne Rouyer, by whom he had a daughter named Zénaïde Françoise Clary (1812 – 1884). Zénaïde would marry Napoléon Alexandre Berthier, the son of Marshal Louis Alexandre Berthier, and have several children, among them the first wife of Joachim, 4th Prince Murat.\n\nShe received a proposal from General Junot, but turned it down because it was given through Marmont. Clary eventually met her future spouse, Jean Baptiste Jules Bernadotte, another French general and politician. They were married in a secular ceremony at Sceaux on August 17, 1798. In the marriage contract, Clary was given economic independence. On July 4, 1799, she gave birth to their only child, a son, Oscar.\n\nIn 1810 Bernadotte was about to enter his new post as governor of Rome when he was unexpectedly elected the heir-presumptive to King Carl XIII-II of Sweden and Norway. The problem of Carl’s successor had been acute almost from the time he had ascended the throne a year earlier.\n\nThe King was 61 years old and in poor health. He was also childless; Queen Elizabeth Charlotte had given birth to two children who had died in infancy, and there was no prospect of her bearing another child.\n\nQueen Elizabeth Charlotte was daughter of Duke Friedrich August I of Holstein-Gottorp and Princess Ulrike Friederike of Hesse-Cassel.\n\nSoon after his coronation, the king had adopted a Danish prince Carl August, (originally Prince Christian August of Denmark).\n\nPrince Christian August was the son of Friedrich Christian I, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (1721–1794) and Princess Charlotte of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Plön (1744–1770).\n\nHe was a younger brother of Friedrich Christian II, Duke of Augustenborg, brother-in-law of Princess Louise Auguste of Denmark “daughter” of King Christian VII of Denmark and Caroline Matilda of Great Britain and an uncle of Caroline Amalie of Augustenburg, Queen Consort of Denmark as the wife of Christian VIII and Christian August, Duke of Augustenborg. He did not marry.\n\nDespite the fact that Napoleon favored his ally Danish King Frederik VI, Danish Prince Frederick Christian initially had the most support to become Swedish Crown Prince as well.\n\nAs Crown Prince of Sweden, Prince Christian August changed his name to Carl August. Honors were lavished upon him on his arrival, he was for example made an honorary member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on April 18, 1810, and was the first person to enjoy this status in that academy.\n\nHowever, he did not live long enough to make a historical impact in Sweden. He suddenly died on 28 May 28, 1810, when he fell off his horse during a military practice in Kvidinge. His autopsy confirmed that he had died of a stroke, but at the same time rumours went that he had been poisoned by Gustavians.\n\nSpecifically, the Marshal of the Realm Count Axel von Fersen was openly accused of having killed Crown Prince Carl August, and was lynched on June 20, 1810 during the funeral procession of Carl August. Carl August was buried in Riddarholmen Church, the burial church of Swedish monarchs.\n\nThe political situation internally and externally for Sweden meant that selecting a foreign king was an attractive option. Sweden wanted to strengthen its relationship with Napoleon for militaristic reasons so sought to select a king who would be able to attract Napoleon’s support.\n\nThe Swedish court initially sounded out the emperor for his preferences on candidates for crown prince, whereupon Napoleon made it clear he preferred his adopted stepson Eugène de Beauharnais, or one of his nephews or brothers.\n\nThe Swedish envoys did not accept Eugène as a candidate. Baron Lagerbielke, the Swedish envoy in Paris, reported to Stockholm that Eugène was “gentle and good,” “but he does not seem to be a man of strong character; and, although he had had great opportunities, he does not appear to have developed any distinguishing talents.”\n\nAlso, Eugène, serving as viceroy in Italy, did not wish to convert to Lutheranism, a prerequisite for accepting the Swedish offer. Moreover, none of Napoleon’s brothers were interested in going to Sweden and his nephews were too young, as the Swedes did not want the hazards of minority rule in the event King Carl XIII died prematurely.\n\nThe matter was decided by an obscure Swedish courtier, Baron Karl Otto Mörner (nephew of Count Gustav Mörner, the commander of the Swedish force captured by Bernadotte at Lübeck), who, entirely on his own initiative, offered the succession to the Swedish crown to Bernadotte.\n\nBernadotte communicated Mörner’s offer to Napoleon who at first treated the situation as an absurdity, but later came around to the idea and supported Bernadotte’s candidacy both financially and diplomatically.\n\nAlthough the Swedish government, amazed at Mörner’s effrontery, at once placed him under arrest on his return to Sweden, the candidature of Bernadotte gradually gained favour and on August 21, 1810 he was elected by the Riksdag of the Estates in Örebro to be the new crown prince, and was subsequently made Generalissimus of the Swedish Armed Forces by the King.\n\nSeveral factors benefitted Bernadotte’s election. Being foreign was, although problematic, also to his favour due to geopolitical factors and the internal situation at the time. One benefit was his (presumed) close ties to French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, with whom a relationship would provide military backing as the intention at the time was to reacquire Finland.\n\nThe current King, Carl XIII, viewed Napoleon in a more positive way than the deposed King, Gustaf IV Adolph had, who had held him in very ill regard. Another point in favour was that a large part of the Swedish Army, anticipating conflict with Russia, were in favour of electing a soldier.\n\nAlso, Bernadotte was personally popular, owing to the kindness he had shown to the Swedish prisoners in Lübeck and his reputation as the well-liked governor of the Hanseatic Cities from 1807 to 1809; as many Swedish merchants had operated under his auspices.\n\nFinally, Bernadotte had no qualms about converting to Lutheranism, recalling the conversion of King Henri IV for the benefit of France with whom he felt a kinship with as both hailed from Pau, nor converting his son Oscar (though his wife Désirée never did renounce Catholicism).\n\nBefore freeing Bernadotte from his allegiance to France, Napoleon asked him to agree never to take up arms against France. Bernadotte refused to make any such agreement, upon the ground that his obligations to Sweden would not allow it; Napoleon exclaimed “Go, and let our destinies be accomplished” and signed the act of emancipation unconditionally.\n\nOn November 2, 1810 Bernadotte made his solemn entry into Stockholm, and on November 5, he received the homage of the Riksdag of the Estates, and he was adopted by King Carl XIII under the name of “Carl Johan.”\n\nAt the same time, he converted from Roman Catholicism to the Lutheranism of the Swedish court; Swedish law required the monarch to be Lutheran.\n\nsoon after his arrival becoming de facto head of state for most of his time as Crown Prince. In 1813, following the sudden unprovoked French invasion of Swedish Pomerania, Crown Prince Carl Johan was instrumental in the creation of the Sixth Coalition by allying with Emperor Alexander I of Russia and using Swedish diplomacy to bring warring Russia and Britain together in alliance. He then authored the Trachenberg Plan, the war-winning Allied campaign plan, and commanded the Allied Army of the North that defeated two concerted French attempts to capture Berlin and made the decisive attack on the last day of the catastrophic French defeat at Leipzig.\n\nAfter the War of the Sixth Coalition, Crown Prince Carl Johan forced King Frederik VI of Denmark to cede Norway to Sweden, leading to the Swedish–Norwegian War of 1814 where Norway was defeated after a single summer’s conflict. This put Norway into a union with Sweden, which lasted for almost a century before its peaceful 1905 dissolution. The Swedish–Norwegian war is credited as Sweden’s last direct conflict and war.\n\nUpon the death of King Carl XIII-II in 1818, Crown Prince Carl Johan ascended to the thrones as King Carl XIII-II Johan of Sweden and Norway. He presided over a period of peace and prosperity, and reigned until his death in 1844.\n\nFrom the Emperor’s Desk: In addressing the death of Amélie of Leuchtenberg I will focus on the arrangement of her marriage to Emperor Pedro of Brazil.\n\nAmélie of Leuchtenberg (July 31, 1812 – January 26, 1873) was Empress of Brazil as the wife of Pedro I of Brazil. Amélie was the fourth child of General Eugène de Beauharnais, Duke of Leuchtenberg and his wife Princess Augusta of Bavaria.\n\nHer father was the son of Joséphine de Beauharnais and her first husband, Viscount Alexandre de Beauharnais. When Joséphine remarried, to Napoleon Bonaparte, Eugène was adopted by the latter and made viceroy of the Kingdom of Italy.\n\nAmélie’s mother was the daughter of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and his first consort, Princess Augusta Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt.\n\nAmong Amélie’s siblings were Josephine of Leuchtenberg, Queen Consort of King Oscar I of Sweden, and Auguste de Beauharnais, 2nd Duke of Leuchtenberg, prince consort of Queen Maria II of Portugal (stepdaughter of Amélie). French Emperor Napoleon III was Amélie’s first cousin.\n\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1814, Eugène de Beauharnais, having been granted the title Duke of Leuchtenberg by his father-in-law, settled in Munich. The possibility occurred to Amélie’s mother, Augusta, of marrying Amélie to the Emperor of Brazil, to guarantee the pretensions of the House of Leuchtenberg to royal status.\n\nMarriage\n\nAfter the death of his first wife, the Austrian Archduchess Maria Leopoldina, in December 1826, Emperor Pedro I of Brazil (former King Pedro IV of Portugal) sent the Marquis of Barbacena to Europe to find him a second wife.\n\nEmperor Pedro ‘s Archduchess Maria Leopoldina of Austria was the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Franz II, and his second wife, Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily. Among her many siblings were Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria and Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma, the wife of Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nMarquis of Barbacena’s task was not easy; several factors complicated the search. First, Emperor Pedro had stipulated four conditions: a good family background, beauty, virtue and culture. Conversely, the Emperor of Brazil did not have a particularly good image in Europe: his relationship with the Marchioness of Santos was notorious, and few eligible princesses were expected to be eager to leave the courts of Europe to marry a widower who had a tarnished reputation as a husband, becoming step-mother to his five children.\n\nTo make matters worse, the former father-in-law of Emperor Dom Pedro, Holy Roman Emperor Franz II had a low opinion of his son-in-law’s political views, and apparently acted to prevent a new marriage to ensure that his grandchildren would inherit the throne of Brazil if they survived infancy.\n\nAfter refusals by eight princesses turned the ambassador into an object of scorn in the courts of Europe, the Marquis of Barbacena, in agreement with the Emperor, lowered his requirements, seeking for Dom Pedro a wife merely “good and virtuous.”\n\nAmélie now became a good possibility, but their encounter was brought about not by the Marquis of Barbacena, but by Domingos Borges de Barros, Viscount of Pedra Branca, minister in Paris, to whom she had been pointed out.\n\nShe came from a distinguished and ancient line on her mother’s side, the Wittelsbachs of Bavaria, but her father, an exile who shared in the disgrace of Napoleon Bonaparte’s deposition as Emperor, was not an optimal marital match. However, that was her sole “defect”. The princess was tall, very beautiful, well proportioned, with a delicate face.\n\nShe had blue eyes and brownish-golden hair. António Teles da Silva Caminha e Meneses, Marquis of Resende, sent to verify the beauty of the young lady, praised her highly, saying that she had “a physical air that like that the painter Correggio gave us in his paintings of the Queen of Sheba”. She was also cultured and sensitive.\n\nA contemporary piece in The Times of London affirms that she was one of the best educated and best prepared princesses in the German world.\n\nThe marriage contract was signed on May 29, 1829 in England, and ratified on June 30 in Munich by Amélie’s mother, the Duchess of Leuchtenberg, who had tutored her daughter personally. On July 30 of that year, in Brazil, a treaty of marriage between Pedro I and Amélie of Leuchtenberg was promulgated.\n\nUpon confirming the marriage, Emperor Pedro definitively broke his links to the Marchioness of Santos and, as evidence of his good intentions, instituted the Order of the Rose, with the motto “Amor e Fidelidade” (“Love and Fidelity”).\n\nA proxy marriage ceremony on August 2 in the chapel of the Palais Leuchtenberg in Munich was a simple affair with few in attendance, as Amélie insisted on donating to a Munich orphanage the appreciable amount Dom Pedro had sent for a ceremony with full pomp. Dom Pedro was represented by the Marquis of Barbacena. Amélie was barely seventeen years old; Dom Pedro was thirty."
