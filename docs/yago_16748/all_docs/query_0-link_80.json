He is the son of Prince Charles Napoléon and his first wife Princess Béatrice of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, daughter of the late Prince Ferdinand of Bourbon, Duke of Castro, a claimant to Headship of the former Royal House of the Two Sicilies. His parents divorced on 2 May 1989, a couple of months before Jean-Christophe's 3rd birthday.\n\nJean-Christophe is the great-great-great-grandnephew of Emperor Napoleon I of France (who has no legitimate, direct descendants) through the emperor's younger brother, Jérôme, King of Westphalia. Through his mother he is a descendant of King Louis XV of France and through his great-grandmother princess Clémentine of Belgium he is a descendant of Louis Philippe I, King of the French, who was the last King to rule France, although Emperor Napoleon III would serve as its last monarch.\n\nPrince Napoléon\n\nJean-Christophe's grandfather, Louis, Prince Napoléon, died in 1997, stipulating in his will that he wished his 11-year-old grandson Jean-Christophe to succeed him as Head of the Imperial House of France rather than the boy's father, Charles, who had embraced republican principles and re-married without his father's authorization. Despite the dynastic dispute, Jean-Christophe's father has stated that \"there will never be conflict\" between him and his son over the imperial succession.\n\nEducation and career\n\nJean-Christophe studied at Lycée Saint Dominique, Neuilly from 2001 to 2004 gaining a Baccalauréat with Honours in the sciences and mathematics. From 2004 to 2006 he studied economics and mathematics at the Institut privé de préparation aux études supérieures (IPESUP) in Paris. Jean-Christophe joined the HEC School of Management in Paris in 2006 where he spent five years, graduating with a Master of Science in Management degree.\n\nJean-Christophe currently works in New York City as a Investment Banking Analyst for Morgan Stanley.\n\nJean-Christophe is fluent in French, English and Spanish.\n\nTitles and styles\n\n11 July 1986 – 3 May 1997: His Imperial Highness Prince Jean Christophe Napoléon\n\n3 May 1997 – present: His Imperial Highness the Prince Napoléon"
