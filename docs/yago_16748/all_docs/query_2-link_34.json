        "text": "The Monaco royals graced the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival this week, with Charlotte Casiraghi wowing in a floral Chanel number.\n\nThe model and equestrian, 36, was joined by her husband, Lebanese-French film producer Dimitri Rassam, and her sister-in-law, Beatrice Borromeo, at the glitzy event.\n\nThe trio attended the screening of Johnny Depp's latest film, Jeanne du Barry, on Tuesday.\n\nBeatrice, who is married to Charlotte's brother, Pierre Casiraghi, wowed in a black and gold lace gown from Dior's AW22 Couture Collection.\n\nPierre and Beatrice have two sons, Stefano and Francesco, born in 2017 and 2018 respectively.\n\nCharlotte is the daughter of Princess Caroline of Hanover – Prince Albert of Monaco's older sister – and the late Stefano Casiraghi.\n\nAs well as her four-year-old son, Balthazar, whom she shares with Dimitri, Charlotte also has nine-year-old Raphaël, from her previous relationship with stand-up comedian, Gad Elmaleh.\n\nPrincess Maria Carolina De Bourbon des Deux Siciles and Princess Maria Chiara de Bourbon des Deux Siciles also attended Cannes Film Festival this week.\n\nThe sisters are the daughters of Princess Camilla and Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro, who is one of two claimants to the headship of the former House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies.\n\nIn the past, a number of high-profile royals have attended the glamorous film festival in the French Riviera. Take a look back in the clip below...\n\nDiana, Princess of Wales provided one of the most iconic fashion moments in 1987, when she wowed in a powder-blue Grecian-style gown with a matching scarf by Catherine Walker.\n\nShe accessorised the dress with metallic heels, and aquamarine and diamond chandelier earrings with a matching bracelet.\n\nPrince Albert of Monaco and his wife, Princess Charlene, have also previously graced Cannes Film Festival, putting in an appearance just before their July 2011 wedding.\n\nFormer Olympic swimmer Charlene opted for a dove grey off-the-shoulder Giorgio Armani gown with a glittery belt for the occasion.\n\nSarah, Duchess of York attended a fashion event at Cannes Film Festival with her eldest daughter, Princess Beatrice, in 2017.\n\nPrince Andrew's former wife chose an emerald green floor-length gown and accessorised with a diamond choker for the red carpet event.\n\nMeanwhile, Beatrice opted for a black puff-sleeved top with a deep blue and gold satin midi skirt.\n\nThe pair were also pictured with Queen Rania of Jordan at the event, who looked elegant in an ivory satin dress.\n\nLISTEN: Royal fashion expert Elizabeth Holmes reveals her best dressed of the day - and it's not Kate"
