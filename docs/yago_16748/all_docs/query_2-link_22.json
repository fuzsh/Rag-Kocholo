        "text": "Things are hotting up in royal circles. Prince Christian of Denmark, the eldest son of Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary, is said to have introduced his rumoured girlfriend the Italian Princess Maria Chiara di Borbone-Two Sicilies, to his grandmother Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.\n\nRead More\n\nHow will Prince Christian of Denmark, the dashing future king, celebrate his 18th birthday? With plenty of pomp and ceremony, of course\n\nThere will be military displays and a gala dinner hosted by Queen Margrethe II when Prince Christian of Denmark marks the milestone this October\n\n‘Chiara was presented to Queen Margrethe over the summer and they all took tea together,’ an insider told Woman’s Day. Christian knew they’d hit it off and was thrilled that she invited them to tea. It’s an informal stamp of approval for Chiara because Margrethe doesn’t take tea with just anyone.’ The source added that Queen Margrethe takes particular interest in Christian’s private life as he is second-in-line to the throne after his father. ‘It [is] her duty to invest time in Christian's happiness and his choice of partner.’\n\nPrincess Maria Chiara di Borbone-Two Sicilies is the youngest daughter of Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro, who is the great-great-great-grandson of Francis II, the last King of the Two Sicilies (Sicily and Naples).\n\nThe couple caused a stir when they were photographed together at the Monaco Grand Prix, but Christian and Chiara are long-standing family friends. Indeed, Chiara's father is godfather to Princess Josephine of Denmark, Christian's sister and the youngest of Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary's four children.\n\nRead More\n\nWho is the Duke of Bavaria, the pioneering German prince who could have been a King of England?\n\nFranz, Duke of Bavaria, celebrated his 90th birthday in his beloved hometown of Munich. But who is the respected aristocrat from one of Germany’s oldest families?\n\nPrincess Chiara is said to have been ‘in awe’ of the queen and had spent months ‘practising her curtsey’ ahead of the meeting in June, the source added. Crown Princess Mary is said to be ‘relieved’ that it was such a positive introduction.\n\nPrince Christian of Denmark and Princess Chiara were recently spotted on an escape to St Tropez, weeks after their rendez-vous in Monaco. The future king of Denmark, who turns 18 in October, was spotted cosying up to Chiara, 18, at the Monaco Grand Prix. In a group photo posted on Instagram, the photogenic pair are seen standing next to each other, with Chiara’s hand resting on the prince’s shoulder. Chiara’s sister, 19-year-old Princess Maria Carolina stands front and centre, Dior handbag dangling casually by her side.\n\nAt the time it was reported that Christian wanted a ‘proper girlfriend’ and that Chiara ‘ticks all the right boxes’. ‘Christian is definitely taken with Chiara – it remains to be seen if she feels the same,' a source told Woman's Day at the time. ‘For now, they get along well, both families approve and they have a lot of similar tastes in music, sports and even film.’ The report has not been confirmed by either side.\n\nHappy birthday, Princess Beatrice! Celebrating the Royal Family’s rising style maven\n\nRead More\n\nThe Danish royal family have found themselves making headlines in recent months after Queen Margrethe stripped four of her grandchildren – the sons and daughter of youngest son Prince Joachim – of their royal titles. The rules came into effect in January and affect Prince Christian's four cousins, but not him or the three other children of Frederik and Mary. Prince Joachim later announced he was leaving Europe for the US while Count Nikolia of Monpezat (Prince Christian's cousin) has relocated to Australia for a semester abroad.\n\nEspadrilles are the Kate-approved shoe that are the smart choice for laid-back summer chic\n\nRead More\n\nPrincess Chiara is descended from an Italian noble family who reigned over part of Italy until Italian unification in 1861 and since then, the family has been without a throne. Prince Carlo, or the Duke of Castro, is married to Italian heiress Camilla Crociani. The family live between Monaco, St Tropez, Paris and Rome and are fixtures on the international social circuit. Chiara and her sister often post on social media, documenting glamorous events with European royals, including the Danish Royal Family and Monaco’s Royal Family, the Grimaldis.\n\nSome outlets are even go so far as to suggest an engagement might soon be on the cards for this well-connected couple. While that seems unlikely given their age, it is still a sure sign that things are hotting up for His Royal Highness."
