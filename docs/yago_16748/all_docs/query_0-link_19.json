The only son of Prince Charles Napoléon, son of the Head of the House of Bonaparte, and Princess Béatrice of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, daughter of the Head of the Royal House of the Two Sicilies, Prince Jean-Christophe grew up in France, studying at the Lycée Saint Dominique in Neuilly-sur-Seine from 2001 to 2004, obtaining a baccalauréat with honours in the sciences and mathematics, before studying economics and mathematics at the Institut Privé de Préparation aux Études Supérieures (IPESUP) in Paris rom 2004 to 2006. He matriculated at the HEC School of Management in Paris, graduating in 2011 with an MSc in management, before completing an MBA at Harvard Business School in 2017, and then working as a private equity associate in the London office of the Blackstone Group, as well as working as an investment banking analyst for Morgan Stanley and as a private equity associate for Advent International. Upon the death of his grandfather,Louis, Prince Napoléon in 1997, the then 11-year-old Prince Jean-Christophe succeeded him as Head of the Imperial House of France instead of his father. In 2019, the Prince married Countess Olympia von und zu Arco-Zinneberg, daughter of Archduchess Maria Beatrice of Austria-Este and Count Riprand von und zu Arco-Zinneberg, at the Cathedral Saint Louis des Invalides in Paris and the couple are expecting their first child later this year. Prince Napoléon represents the dynasty’s heritage at public events and ceremonies around the world, taking a major role in the Battle of Waterloo Bicentenary Celebrations in 2015 and the Bicentenary of the Death of Emperor Napoléon earlier this year. We wish HIH a very Happy Birthday and Many Happy Returns!\n\nEmbed from Getty ImagesEmbed from Getty Images"
