        "text": "Naples, January 2014. HE Mr Anthony Bailey, OBE, GCSS, attended the Beatification of the Queen Maria Cristina of the Two Sicilies that took place at the historic Basilica of Santa Chiara in the heart of the Naples, the historic capital city of the former Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Several thousands of people attending this moving event which united for the first time in 50 years the principal branches of the Bourbon Two Sicilies dynasty lead by HRH The Duke of Castro in Italy and HRH The Duke of Calabria in Spain.\n\nQueen Maria Cristina of the Two Sicilies, born in 1812 was the daughter of King Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia and Archduchess Maria Teresa of Austria-Este, Maria Cristina married King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies in 1832. The Queen died aged 24 in 1836 following the birth of their only child who later became the last reigning King of the Two Sicilies, Francis II.\n\nThe Holy Father, Pope Francis who approved the beatification on 2 May 2013, was represented at the mass by HE Angelo Cardinal Amato, Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. HE Crescenzio Cardinal Sepe, Archbishop of Naples was celebrant and HE Renato Raffaele Cardinal Martino, Grand Prior of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of St George was also present.\n\nIn his homily at the Mass of beatification, Cardinal Amato outlined the reasons for the beatification – the Queen’s innocence, modesty, and mortification with respect to food and entertainment, as well as her love for the poor and sick. All Christians, the prelate emphasised, are given opportunities to become holy, whatever their state of life.\n\nFollowing his Sunday Angelus address at the Vatican, Pope Francis described Queen Maria Cristina as a “woman of deep spirituality and great humility. She was able to bear the suffering of her people, becoming a true mother of the poor,” he added. “Her extraordinary example of charity shows that the good life of the Gospel is possible in every environment and social status.”\n\nThe Pontifical event was attended by TRH The Duke and Duchess of Castro, TRH Prince Pedro and Princess Sofia of Bourbon Two Sicilies, Duke and Duchess of Noto, and other senior members of the Bourbon Two Sicilies Family including HRH Princess Ana of Bourbon Two Sicilies, Duchess of Calabria, HRH Prince Jaime of Bourbon Two Sicilies, Duke of Capua, HRH Princess Maria Carolina of Bourbon Two Sicilies, Duchess of Palermo, HRH Princess Maria Chiara of Bourbon Two Sicilies, Duchess of Capri, HRH Princess Beatrice of Bourbon Two Sicilies, TRH Prince and Princess Casimiro of Bourbon Two Sicilies TI & RH Archduke and Archduchess Simeon of Austria, HI & RH Archduke Martin of Austria, HRH Princess Ines de Borbon Dos Sicilias de Carelli Palombi, HRH Prince Luigi Alfonso of Bourbon Two Sicilies and the Rev Alessandro di Borbone-Due Sicilie, HRH Princess Caroline of Bourbon Two Sicilies and HRH Princess Maria Annunziata of Bourbon Two Sicilies.\n\nAmong members of other European Families present were HRH The Duke of Braganza, HRH Princess Clotide Princess of Venice and Piedmont, HRH Princess Maria Gabriella of Savoy, TRH The Duke and Duchess of Aosta, and HRH Prince Serge of Yugoslavia.\n\nMr Bailey and other principal guests also attended a reception held in the cloisters of the Bascilia and the Duke and Duchess of Castro greeted many of their supporters who had gathered at the Basilica for this truly historic day."
