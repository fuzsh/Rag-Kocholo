        "text": "Though she's not a working royal like some of her family, Princess Beatrice nonethless carries out a regular roster of public appearances, often accompanied by her husband, Edoardo \"Edo\" Mapelli Mozzi, who has become a fixture of royal events.\n\nNaturally, Edo was by Beatrice's side to attend the coronation of her uncle, King Charles III, at Westminster Abbey. The couple even had time to share a nice moment with Beatrice's cousin, Prince Harry, who was briefly in the UK to celebrate the occasion.\n\nPrincess Beatrice, Edo, and Prince Harry greet one another at the coronation of King Charles.\n\nWho is Beatrice's husband? Here's everything we know about him.\n\nHe and Princess Beatrice welcomed their first child in 2021.\n\nBeatrice and Edo quickly adapted to life as young parents. They welcomed their first child, Sienna Elizabeth, in September 2021, who is currently 10th in line to the British throne. Buckingham Palace announced the happy news: \"Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice and Mr Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi are delighted to announce the safe arrival of their daughter on Saturday 18th September 2021, at 23.42, at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London.\"\n\nThey married in a private ceremony attended by the Queen.\n\nAfter postponing their royal wedding plans due to the coronavirus outbreak, the couple ultimately wed during summer 2020 in a small private ceremony.\n\nThe wedding took place on July 17, 2020 at the Royal Chapel of All Saints at Royal Lodge, Windsor. Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, Princess Beatrice's grandparents, were there along with \"close family.\" A spokesperson added that the ceremony followed \"all relevant Government Guidelines\" for safety during the pandemic.\n\nThe couple had originally planned to say \"I do\" in the Chapel Royal at St. James's Palace in London and Queen Elizabeth was set to host a private reception afterwards in the gardens of Buckingham Palace.\n\nMozzi has a son named Christopher Woolf, or \"Wolfie.\"\n\nEdo has a son, Wolfie, from a previous relationship—which made Beatrice an instant step-mother. The couple made a sweet mention of Wolfie in the birth announcement of their daughter, noting that \"the couple are looking forward to introducing their daughter to her big brother Christopher Woolf.\"\n\nWolfie made his debut with the royal family in 2022, joining his father and stepmother for the Queen's Platinum Jubilee Pageant, and later spent time with the royals at Christmas.\n\nPrincess Beatrice, Christopher \"Wolfie\" Mapelli Mozzi, Edo Mapelli Mozzi, and Princess Eugenie at the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee pageant.\n\nHe shared a message of condolence after Queen Elizabeth's death.\n\nFollowing the news that the Queen had passed away at the age of 96, he shared a sweet tribute in Her Majesty's honor on Instagram.\n\n\"Incredibly hard to process the last 24 hours. What an incredible woman and extraordinary mark she’s left on the entire world. She was the rock on which modern Britain was built,\" he wrote on a post including photos of the late Queen, including a shot from his own wedding to Princess Beatrice. \"Feeling very lucky that our little ones got to spend wonderful time with her this summer. Rest is Peace Your Majesty. We will miss you so much. Brokenhearted\"\n\nHe proposed to Princess Beatrice in Italy.\n\n\"We are extremely happy to be able to share the news of our recent engagement,\" said the couple in a statement on September 26, 2019. \"We are both so excited to be embarking on this life adventure together and can't wait to be married. We share so many similar interests and values and we know this will stand us in great stead for the years ahead, full of love and happiness.\"\n\nThe couple took their relationship into the spotlight in 2019.\n\nMozzi and Beatrice made their first public appearance at the National Portrait Gallery's 2019 Gala. Not long afterwards, they were spotted holding hands in New York City.\n\nDuring the Bahrain Grand Prix in March 2019, they took things to the next level, with Mozzi accompanying Beatrice on a family trip. Sarah Ferguson was even seen hanging out with the couple. And they then made a joint appearance (pictured below) at Ella Windsor's wedding in May 2019 to Thomas Kingston at St. George's Chapel in Windsor.\n\nPrincess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi with the bride's mother Sarah Ferguson at Ella Windsor's wedding last year in Windsor.\n\nAfter announcing their engagement in 2019, Edo began joining Princess Beatrice at royal events—like the Windsors' annual walk to Christmas Day services on Sandringham Estate. In 2021 and 2022, he has become a staple at Beatrice's side during royal events.\n\nPrincess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi during the charity preview night of \"A Gallop Through History\" at the Royal Windsor Horse Show, May 2022.\n\nPrincess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi hold hands as they attend the \"Together at Christmas\" community carol service at Westminster Abbey on December 8, 2021.\n\nMozzi is a friend of Beatrice's family.\n\nDespite reports in The Sun that Beatrice and Mozzi met in through mutual friends, People revealed that they've been acquaintances for some time.\n\nMozzi's stepfather was Christopher Shale, a British political operative and close friend of previous Prime Minister David Cameron, who died at the Glastonbury music festival in 2011. Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson considered Shale a friend as well, and went to his funeral—as did Beatrice.\n\nPrincess Beatrice and Mozzi were also both in attendance at a 2014 wedding in Puglia, Italy—where Mozzi may or may not have gotten into a little bit of trouble, per the Daily Mail.\n\nSarah Ferguson and Princess Beatrice at Princess Eugenie’s wedding in October.\n\nThrough his father, he has some ties to nobility.\n\nMozzi's father, who was his mother Nikki Shale's first husband, is Count Alessandro Mapelli Mozzi. Not that she traded down when she married Christopher Shale—the house Nikki and Christopher built together had six bedrooms, a gym, and a wine cellar, not to mention the croquet garden and orchard.\n\nNikki was also nominated for an MBE award—a royal honor—by David Cameron in 2016.\n\nEdo Mapelli Mozzi in 2013.\n\nEdo co-founded a charity, which was inspired by his late stepfather's vision.\n\nMozzi is behind Cricket Builds Hope (CBH), an organization that teaches Rwandans how to play cricket. According to its website, \"CBH harnesses the power of sport to promote reconciliation and tackle deep-seated social issues like gender inequality through specially tailored sessions run by CBH’s cricket coaching team.\"\n\nThe charity has its roots in Rwanda Cricket Stadium Foundation, which was founded by Christopher Shale to build the country's first grass cricket ground. Shale dreamed of expanding it into something larger, and after his death in 2011, his friends and family created CBH to do so in his memory.\n\nHe's got plenty of his own wealth.\n\nMozzi founded real estate firm Banda in 2007, and serves as its CEO to this day. The company specializes in finding and developing homes for wealthy clients—he is reportedly a multi-millionaire.\n\nEdo has his own Instagram account, @edomapellimozzi.\n\nEdo is an infrequent poster on Instagram, but he writes in his bio, \"Husband | Dad | Property | Interior Designer | Acquisitions, Design & Development. CEO & Creative Director @banda.property\"\n\nHe has shared some sweet photos of him and Beatrice:"
