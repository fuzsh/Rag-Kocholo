        "text": "Louise Françoise Marie Laure d’Orléans (1882 – 1958) was a Princess of the Two-Sicilies and maternal grandmother of King Juan Carlos I of Spain. Louise was the youngest daughter of Philippe d’Orléans (1838–1894), Count of Paris and claimant to the French throne as “Philippe VII”. Her mother was Princess Marie Isabelle d’Orléans (1848–1919), daughter of Antoine, Duke of Montpensier, and Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain.\n\nOn 16 November 1907, Louise married in Wood Norton, Evesham, Worcestershire, UK, Infante Carlos, Prince of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (1870–1949), and widower of Mercedes, Princess of Asturias, Infanta of Spain. The couple lived in Madrid and had 4 children.\n\nLouise of France Princess of Bourbon, 1906 via\n\nLouise of France Princess of Bourbon by Léopold-Émile Reutlinger, 1906 via\n\nLouise of France Princess of Bourbon by Léopold-Émile Reutlinger, 1906 via\n\nPrincess Marie Bonaparte Princess George of Greece and Denmark (1882-1962) known as Princess George of Greece and Denmark upon her marriage, was a French author and psychoanalyst, closely linked with Sigmund Freud.\n\nHer wealth contributed to the popularity of psychoanalysis, and enabled Freud’s escape from Nazi Germany. Marie Bonaparte was a great-grandniece of Emperor Napoleon I of France. She was the only child of Prince Roland Bonaparte (19 May 1858 – 14 April 1924) and Marie-Félix Blanc (1859–1882).\n\nHer paternal grandfather was Prince Pierre Napoleon Bonaparte, son of Prince Lucien Bonaparte, who was one of Napoleon’s rebellious and disinherited younger brothers. For this reason, despite her title Marie was not a member of the dynastic branch of the Bonapartes who claimed the French imperial throne from exile.\n\nHer maternal grandfather was François Blanc, the principal real-estate developer of Monte Carlo. It was from this side of her family that Marie inherited her great fortune.\n\nMarie Bonaparte via\n\nClara Ward (1873 – 1916) was a wealthy American socialite who married a prince from Belgium. Her main talents were being beautiful by the standards of the time, and being famous. She combined the two by posing on various stages, including at least the Folies Bergère and probably also the Moulin Rouge, while wearing skin-tight costumes.\n\nPostcard of theater star Clara Ward, ca. 1900s via\n\nIn 1885 Princess Beatrice (1857-1944), the fifth daughter and youngest child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, married Prince Henry of Battenberg (1858–1896).\n\nThe marriage took place at Whippingham on the Isle of Wight on 23 July.\n\nThey had 3 sons and 1 daughter. Their daughter was Victoria Eugenie, Queen of Spain. King Felipe VI of Spain is her great-great-grandson.\n\nPrincess Beatrice posing in her wedding dress, 1885 via\n\nPrincess Beatrice posing with prince Henry, 1885 via\n\nPrincess Beatrice posing in her wedding dress, 1885 via\n\nPrincess Beatrice posing in her wedding dress, 1885 via\n\nPrincess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (17 August 1786 – 16 March 1861), later Duchess of Kent and Strathearn, was a German princess and the mother of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1818 she married Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn (1767–1820 ). The couple were married on 29 May at Amorbach and on 11 July at Kew, a joint ceremony at which Edward’s brother, the Duke of Clarence, later King William IV, married Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen.\n\nShortly after the marriages, the Kents moved to Germany, where the cost of living would be cheaper.\n\nSoon after, Victoria became pregnant, and the Duke and Duchess, determined to have their child born in England, raced back, arriving at Dover on 23 April 1819, and moved into Kensington Palace, where she soon gave birth to a daughter, Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent.\n\nPrincess Victoria, Duchess of Kent and Strathearn by Richard James Lane, published by Thomas Boys, after Alfred Edward Chalon lithograph, published 1838 © National Portrait Gallery, London via\n\nPrincess Victoria, Duchess of Kent and Strathearn by Thomas Woolnoth, after George Dawe stipple engraving, published 1820 © National Portrait Gallery, London via\n\nPrincess Victoria, Duchess of Kent and Strathearn by James Bromley, published by Paul and Dominic Colnaghi & Co, after Sir George Hayter mezzotint, published 1835 © National Portrait Gallery, London via\n\nPortrait of Queen Mary (1867–1953) when Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, sitting prior to wedding, 6 July 1893.

Thousands lined the streets to witness the Queen’s younger sister get married. It was the first ever televised wedding, and 20 million viewers tuned in.\n\nPrincess Margaret made the journey from Clarence House to Westminster Abbey in the Glass Coach with the Duke of Edinburgh.\n\nShe dressed in white silk and sported a diamond tiara. Among the 2,000 guests in the church were the King and Queen of Sweden, and the traditional Church of England service was led by the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nAfter the ceremony, the pair travelled to Buckingham Palace where they waved to a delighted crowd.\n\nThe newlyweds boarded the Royal Yacht Britannia on the Thames and set off for a honeymoon in the Caribbean\n\nAnthony Armstrong-Jones (now the Earl of Snowdon) and Princess Margaret had two children, Viscount Linley and Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones. Over time, Lord Snowdon got tired of official engagements, saying “I’m not royal; I’m just married to one.”\n\nThe couple officially separated in March 1976, and divorced two years later (source).\n\nPrincess Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones, May 6, 1960 via\n\nPrincess Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones, May 6, 1960 via\n\nPrincess Margaret, May 6, 1960 via\n\nPrincess Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones, May 6, 1960 via"
