        "text": "HRH Princess Eugenie of York is engaged to be married to her long-time boyfriend, Jack Brooksbank. The proposal comes seven years after they met while skiing in Verbier, a popular Swiss resort among royals.\n\nThe entrepreneurial Brooksbank manages the Mayfair club Mahiki, a nightspot frequented by his friend Prince Harry as well as the York sisters.\n\nBrooksbank has been an entrepreneur since he can remember, stating that he wished to open a chain of businesses and went to the same school as Virgin’s creator Richard Branson.\n\n[See their beautiful engagement photo]\n\nWedding rumors swirled around the pair back in 2016. Now the happy event is official. Eugenie’s parents, the Duke of York and Sarah Ferguson, expressed their happiness over the engagement.\n\nClick here to see a photo of Eugenie’s engagement ring, which is a unique padparadscha gem – a mix of a red and yellow sapphire. The stone is surrounded by diamonds, drawing comparisons to her mother’s engagement ring of a Burmese ruby surrounded by diamonds. Eugenie’s looks more like a little flower on her finger, delicate and sparkling. Lucky girl!\n\nSt. George’s chapel is the place to be, and their wedding will be held here hot on the heels of Eugenie’s cousin Harry, who will be marrying his girlfriend here in May.\n\nEugenie is 8th in line to the throne (until the arrival of her cousin William’s 3rd child, which will then move her to 9th). She is said to have a close relationship to her grandmother, the Queen, as well as a solid, sisterly bond with Princess Beatrice, who is a year and a half older."
