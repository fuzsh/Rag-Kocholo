        "text": "Jean-Christophe, His Imperial Highness the Prince Napoléon\n\nAn heir of the legacy of Napoleon Bonaparte, this investment banker is based in New York and works for Morgan Stanley. He succeeded his grandfather Louis, Prince Napoléon as Head of the Imperial House of France in 1997 due to a dynastic dispute due to his father “embracing republican principles” and remarrying “without his father’s permission”. In an interview, he stated: “I am a man of my time, as is everyone, but also with certain duties that I’ve decided to take up and certainly no extra rights. I am witness to my family’s past and of its role in history, but I am resolute to face the future. The Bonapartes have always been modern men and even avant-gardistes”.\n\nThe Roll Call - DYNASTIES AND GRANDEES\n\n< Categories\n\nThe Steeple Times\n\nWe research and background check our articles.
