Upon the death of his grandfather,Louis, Prince Napoléon in 1997, the then 11-year-old Prince Jean-Christophe succeeded him as Head of the Imperial House of France instead of his father.

Prince Napoléon represents the dynasty’s heritage at public events and ceremonies around the world, taking a major role in the Battle of Waterloo Bicentenary Celebrations in 2015 and the Bicentenary of the Death of Emperor Napoléon earlier this year. We wish HIH a very Happy Birthday and Many Happy Returns!
