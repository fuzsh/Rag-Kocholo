"I Want Candy" is a song sung by Luna, Clyde, and the rest of the Loud Family in A Really Haunted Loud House. It is a rearrangement and cover of the song of the same name, sung while the Louds are giving out candies to all the kids in Royal Woods for redemption from the toothbrush incident.

Lyrics[]

[Louds]

Who wants candy?

Hey!

I want candy

Hey!

Who wants candy?

Hey!

We want candy

Hey!

[Luna]

Candy's so sweet, there's nothing better

Well, we like candy when we share it together

Come on down, it'll all be fine

And we'll have candy all the time

We're a family that's tough but sweet

Uh-huh!

We hang together, we can't be beat

Got everything that you desire

Now let's light up that Halloween fire

Come on!

Trick-or-treating with all our friends

We'll all hang out till the night ends

So the moon is up, we've got a crowd (Ooh!)

Now let's get haunted and...

[Louds and Clyde]

Let's get loud!

[Lucy]

Let's get loud.

[Louds]

Who wants candy? (I want candy)

[Lori]

I literally love candy!

[Everyone]

I want candy!

Who wants candy?

We want candy!

Hey!

We want candy!

Hey! (x5)
