As a teen in the early 80’s when Bow Wow Wow’s cover of the song I Want Candy, came out I thought the song was about candy of the confectionary kind. Not cocaine or sex or your drug of choice. Annabella Lwin, Lead vocalist of Malcolm McLaren’s group, Bow Wow Wow, was in fact a sixteen year old herself. Sometimes I think it would be good to go back to those innocent teenage years, when naivety made the world dream like, anything was possible and if you wanted to find out stuff, you looked it up in a library or in an encyclopaedia and that didn’t guarantee that you would have an answer. The original song by The Strangeloves released in 1965 is apparently about sex because anything carnal couldn’t be mentioned in the sixties.

As an ode to the 80’s go to your local suburban milk bar (if it indeed still exists), grab a bag of mixed lollies or candy of choice and check it out!

The Strangeloves– I Want Candy Lyrics

I know a guy who’s tough but sweet

He’s so fine, he can’t be beat

He’s got everything that I desire

Sets the summer sun on fire

I want candy, I want candy

Go to see him when the sun goes down

Ain’t no finer boy in town

You’re my guy, just what the doctor ordered

So sweet, you make my mouth water

I want candy, I want candy

Candy on the beach, there’s nothing better

But I like candy when it’s wrapped in a sweater

Some day soon I’ll make you mine,

Then I’ll have candy all the time
