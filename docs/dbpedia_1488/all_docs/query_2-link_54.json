        "text": "Post by Sean on\n\nWhat do you think of this song?\n\nThis was 15 year old Mandy Moore's hot debut single \"Candy\", from her album \"So Real\". The song came out at the height of the teen-pop boom after Britney and Christina had made it big. Mandy and Jessica Simpson came out around the same time with their debuts and were considered the 2nd rate Britney and Christina. Still... the 4 of them got a lot of attention for being 'the big four' blonde pop princesses.\n\nI think this song is fantastic - pure pop perfection. I love the bouncy beat, a bit like a Robyn song, only better. Mandy's vocals on this one (and her entire debut) were A LOT different to they are now... she's really matured... she sounded so young and whiney back then. The lyrics has a lot of sexual connotation to them, and the way she pronounced the word \"sweet\" still confuses me! The spoken word bridge is one of my favourite musical moments of all time (yes, I'm serious!) \"You know who you are, your love's as sweet as candy, I'll be forever yours, love always, Mandy\" - she apparently helped out with this bit but I never saw her name credited for it!\n\nThe video was on fire... Mandy with some older guy on a motorbike, Mandy checking out guys in a skating bowl, Mandy and her PYT friends hanging out and getting towed around in a Beetle 'cos they were too young to drive the car. She looks soooo gawky and gangly in this video, but really cute, especially her hair.\n\nThe song was a massive hit in Australia, sitting at #2 for several weeks and ending up as the 11th highest selling single for the year 2000 (it wasn't released here til Jan 2000) outselling everything the other blonde girls put out that year. It also ended up at #1 on my year end chart. It will always bring back great memories and is amongst my favourite pop songs ever. It also goes to show how much Mandy has grown and developed.... and I'm not just talking about hair colour and boobs!!! :)\n\nPost by flarbygarby on\n\nI really liked it at the time it came out. I remember it did a lot of jumping in and out in the Billboards and actually had a long-term haul (don't know if it was the same for Mediabase). Anywho, being a fourteen year old girl with a major crush, I felt compelled to buy her album, and I must say I didn't regret it. She showed a lot of promise in her debut, particularly with Lock Me In Your Heart. It's a shame they released Walk Me Home instead of LMIYH."
