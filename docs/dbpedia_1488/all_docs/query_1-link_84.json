        "text": "Andrea Bocelli\n\nAndrea Angel Bocelli, OMRI, OMDSM is an Italian tenor, singer-songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist. Born with poor eyesight, he became blind at the age of twelve following a football accident.\n\nSince winning the Newcomers section of the Sanremo Music Festival in 1994,(6) Bocelli has recorded fourteen solo studio albums, of both pop and classical music, three greatest hits albums, and nine complete operas, selling over 80 million records worldwide. Thus, he is the biggest-selling artist in the history of classical music and has caused core classical repertoire to \"cross over\" to the top of international pop charts and into previously uncharted territory in popular culture.\n\nWidely regarded as both the most popular Italian and classical singer in the world, Bocelli was made a Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic in 2006, and on March 2, 2010, was honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to Live Theater\n\nAndy Williams\n\nHoward Andrew Williams was an American popular music singer. He recorded 44 albums in his career, 15 of which have been gold-certified(1) and three of which have been platinum-certified. He was also nominated for six Grammy Awards. He hosted The Andy Williams Show, a television variety show, from 1962 to 1971, and numerous TV specials. The Andy Williams Show garnered three Emmy awards. The Moon River Theatre in Branson, Missouri, is named after the song he is most known for singing-Johnny Mercer and Henry Mancini's \"Moon River\". He sold more than 100 million records worldwide, including 10.5 million certified units in the United States.\n\nAvicii\n\nTim Bergling known professionally as Avicii was a Swedish DJ, remixer, and record producer. Bergling was ranked third on DJ Mag in 2012 and and has been nominated twice for a Grammy Award, once for his work on \"Sunshine\" with David Guetta in 201 and once for his song \"Levels\" in 2013. Some of his most famous songs are \"I Could Be the One\" with Nicky Romero, \"Wake Me Up\", \"You Make Me\", \"X You\", \"Hey Brother\", \"Addicted to You\", \"The Days\", \"The Nights\", \"Levels\" and \"Waiting for Love\".\n\nBen E. King\n\nBen E. King, was an American soul and R&B singer and record producer. He was perhaps best known as the singer and co-composer of \"Stand by Me\" - a US Top 10 hit, both in 1961 and later in 1986 (when it was used as the theme to the film of the same name), a number one hit in the UK in 1987, and no. 25 on the RIAA's list of Songs of the Century - and as one of the principal lead singers of the R&B vocal group the Drifters notably singing the lead vocals of one of their biggest global hit singles (and only U.S. #1 hit) \"Save the Last Dance for Me\".\n\nBilly Joel\n\nJoel recorded many popular hit songs and albums from 1973 (beginning with the single \"Piano Man\") to his retirement from recording pop music in 1993. He is one of the very few rock or even pop artists to have Top 10 hits in the '70s, '80s, and '90s. A six-time Grammy Award winner, he has sold in excess of 100 million records worldwide and is the sixth best selling artist in the United States, according to the RIAA. Joel's induction into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame (Class of 1992), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (Class of 1999), and the Long Island Music Hall of Fame (Class of 2006) has further solidified his status as one of America's leading music icons. He has continued to tour occasionally (sometimes with Elton John) in addition to writing and recording classical music.\n\nBob Dylan\n\nBob Dylan is an American singer-songwriter, author and visual artist. Often regarded as one of the greatest songwriters of all time, Dylan has been a major figure in popular culture during a career spanning 60 years. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when songs such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" (1963) and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" (1964) became anthems for the civil rights and anti-war movements. His lyrics during this period incorporated a range of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences, defying pop music conventions and appealing to the burgeoning counterculture.\n\nBobby Darin\n\nBobby Darin was born Walden Robert Cassotto on May 14, 1936. Growing up in a rough section of the Bronx, New York, Bobby barely survived several serious bouts of rheumatic fever that left him with a damaged heart (which undoubtedly contributed to his early death). Bobby's ambition was to become a legend by the time he was 25. Thinking that his damaged heart would eventually kill him, he planned to live life as fully as he could. In 1958, after several forgettable recordings, Bobby came up with his first big hit, \"Splish Splash\", which he claimed took only 12 minutes to write. \"Mack the Knife\", climbed to the top-ten music charts the following year. Bobby moved to Hollywood in 1960, and met and later married his wife Sandra Dee. He was in the process of making a comeback when he died in 1973, at the age of 37, following open-heart surgery.\n\nBryan Adams\n\nBryan Guy Adams, OC OBC is a Canadian singer, songwriter, record producer, guitarist, photographer, philanthropist and activist.\n\nAdams rose to fame in North America with his 1983 album Cuts Like a Knife and turned into a global star with his 1984 album Reckless, which produced some of his best known songs, including \"Run to You\" and \"Summer of '69\". In 1991, he released \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\" from the album Waking Up the Neighbours and the song became a worldwide hit which went to number 1 in many countries, including 16 consecutive weeks in the United Kingdom, a new record. Adams also had the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Heaven\", \"All for Love\" and \"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woma\n\nCharlie Puth\n\nCharles Otto Puth Jr. is an American singer, songwriter, actor and record producer. His initial exposure came through the viral success of his song videos uploaded to YouTube. Puth's debut studio album, Nine Track Mind, was released in January 2016, and was preceded by the singles \"One Call Away\" and \"We Don't Talk Anymore\", which peaked at number 12 and number nine, respectively on the US Billboard Hot 100. In 2017, he released two songs, \"Attention\" and \"How Long\" from his second studio album, Voicenotes, with the former peaking at number five on Billboard Hot 100.\n\nDuke Ellington\n\nBorn 29 April 1899 in Washington DC, composer, bandleader, and pianist Edward Kennedy (\"Duke\") Ellington was recognized in his lifetime as one of the greatest jazz composers and performers. Nicknamed \"Duke\" by a boyhood friend who admired his regal air, the name stuck and became indelibly associated with the finest creations in big band and vocal jazz. A genius for instrumental combinations, improvisation, and jazz arranging brought the world the unique \"Ellington\" sound that found consummate expression in works like \"Mood Indigo,\" \"Sophisticated Lady,\" and the symphonic suites Black, Brown, and Beige (which he subtitled \"a Tone Parallel to the History of the Negro in America\") and Harlem (\"a Tone Parallel to Harlem\").\n\nEd Sheeran\n\nEdward Christopher Sheeran, MBE is an English singer-songwriter, guitarist, and record producer. He was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, and raised in Framlingham, Suffolk. He attended the Academy of Contemporary Music in Guildford, Surrey, as an undergraduate from the age of 18 in 2009. In early 2011, Sheeran independently released the extended play, No. 5 Collaborations Project. After signing with Asylum Records, his debut album, + (read as \"plus\"), was released on 9 September 2011 and has since been certified seven-times platinum in the UK. The album contains the single \"The A Team\", which earned him the Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically. In 2012, Sheeran won the Brit Awards for Best British Male Solo Artist and British Breakthrough Act.\n\nElton John\n\nSir Elton John is one of pop music's great survivors. Born 25 March, 1947, as Reginald Kenneth Dwight, he started to play the piano at the early age of four. At the age of 11, he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music. His first band was called Bluesology. He later auditioned (unsuccessfully) as lead singer for the progressive rock bands King Crimson and Gentle Giant. Dwight teamed up with lyricist Bernie Taupin and changed his name to Elton John (merging the names of saxophonist Elton Dean and Long John Baldry). The duo wrote songs for Lulu and Roger Cook. In the early 1970s, he recorded the concept album \"Tumbleweed Connection.\" He became the most successful pop artist of the 1970s, and he has survived many different pop fads including punk, the New Romantics and Britpop to remain one of Britain's most internationally acclaimed musicians.\n\nElvis Presley\n\nElvis Aaron Presley was born on Tuesday, January 8, 1935 in East Tupelo, Mississippi. In September 1948 when Elvis was 13, he and his parents moved to Memphis, Tennessee. After graduating from Humes High School in Memphis, Elvis took odd jobs working as a movie theater usher and a truck driver for Crown Electric Company. He began singing locally as \"The Hillbilly Cat\", then signed with a local recording company, then in 1955 with RCA. He did much to establish early rock and roll music, bringing black blues singing into the white, teenage mainstream. Teenage girls became hysterical over his blatantly sexual gyrations, particularly the one that got him nicknamed \"Elvis the Pelvis\" (TV cameras were not permitted to film below his waist). At the time of his death, he had sold more than 600-million singles and albums.\n\nEnrique Iglesias\n\nEnrique Miguel Iglesias Preysler (born May 8, 1975), better known as Enrique Iglesias, is a Spanish pop music singer-songwriter. Iglesias started his musical career on Mexican label Fonovisa. This helped turn him into one of the most popular artists in Latin America and in the Hispanic or Latino market in the United States, and the biggest seller of Spanish language albums of that decade. Before the turn of the millennium, he made a crossover into the mainstream English language market, signing a unique multi-album deal with Universal Music Group for an unprecedented US$48,000,000, with Universal Music Latino to release his Spanish albums and Interscope to release English albums. In 2010, he parted with Interscope and signed with another Universal Music Group label, Universal Republic.\n\nEric Clapton\n\nEric Patrick Clapton, CBE, is an English rock and blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter. He is the only three-time inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: once as a solo artist and separately as a member of the Yardbirds and Cream. Clapton has been referred to as one of the most important and influential guitarists of all time. Clapton ranked second in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" and fourth in Gibson's \"Top 50 Guitarists of All Time\" He was also named number five in Time magazine's list of \"The 10 Best Electric Guitar Players\" in 2009.\n\nFrank Sinatra\n\nFrank Sinatra has been called the greatest popular singer of the century. Whether that is true, in a century that also offers us Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald and many others is, of course, a matter of personal emotional choice and, therefore, unknowable. What can be said is that under the intense and fickle scrutiny of the pop marketplace for nearly two-thirds of a century, Sinatra's music was in the air the world breathed and fell out of fashion only long enough for the deserters either to grow up or recognize that what was offered in its place was almost always trash by comparison.\n\nGarth Brooks\n\nTroyal Garth Brooks (born February 7, 1962), best known as Garth Brooks, is an American country music artist who helped make country music a worldwide phenomenon. His eponymous first album was released in 1989 and peaked at #2 in the US country album chart while climbing to #13 on the Billboard 200 pop album chart. Brooks' integration of rock elements into his recordings and live performances has earned him immense popularity. This progressive approach allowed him to dominate the country single and album charts while quickly crossing over into the mainstream pop arena, exposing country music to a larger audience.\n\nJames Taylor\n\nJames Vernon Taylor (born March 12, 1948) is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist born in Lenox, Massachusetts, and raised in Carrboro, North Carolina.(2) He owns a house in the Berkshire County town of Washington, Massachusetts. A five-time Grammy Award winner, Taylor was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2000.\n\nTaylor achieved his major breakthrough in 1970 with the #3 single \"Fire and Rain\" and had his first #1 hit the following year with \"You've Got a Friend\", a recording of Carole King's classic song. His 1976 Greatest Hits album was certified Diamond and has sold 12 million US copies. Following his 1977 album, JT, he has retained a large audience over the decades. His commercial achievements declined slightly until a big resurgence during the late 1990s and 2000s, when some of his best-selling and most-awarded albums (including Hourglass, October Road and Covers) were released.\n\nJoe Cocker\n\nJohn Robert \"Joe\" Cockerwas an English singer and musician. He was known for his gritty voice, spasmodic body movement in performance and definitive versions of popular songs of varying genre.\n\nCocker's cover of the Beatles' \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" reached number one in the UK in 1968. He performed the song live at Woodstock in 1969 and performed the same year at the Isle of Wight Festival, and at the Party at the Palace concert in 2002 for the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. His version also became the theme song for the TV series The Wonder Years. His 1974 cover of \"You Are So Beautiful\" reached number five in the US. Cocker was the recipient of the 1983 Grammy Award for his US number one \"Up Where We Belong\", a duet with Jennifer Warnes.\n\nJohn Denver\n\nJohn Denver, was an American singer-songwriter, record producer, actor, activist, and humanitarian, whose greatest commercial success was as a solo singer. After traveling and living in numerous locations while growing up in his military family, Denver began his music career with folk music groups during the late 1960s. Starting in the 1970s, he was one of the most popular acoustic artists of the decade and one of its best-selling artists. By 1974, he was firmly established as one of America's best-selling performers, and AllMusic has described Denver as \"among the most beloved entertainers of his era\n\nJosh Groban\n\nJoshua Winslow \"Josh\" Groban is an American singer-songwriter, musician, actor, and record producer. His four solo albums have been certified at least multi-platinum, and in 2007, he was charted as the number one best selling artist in the United States with over 21 million records in this country. To date, he has sold over 24 million albums worldwide.\n\nGroban originally studied acting but as his voice changed, it developed into a \"significant instrument\". The event that changed Groban's life was when his vocal coach, Seth Riggs, submitted a tape of Josh singing, \"All I Ask of You\", from The Phantom of the Opera, to Riggs' friend, renowned producer, composer and arranger David Foster. Foster called him to stand in for an ailing Andrea Bocelli to rehearse a duet, \"The Prayer,\" with Celine Dion at the rehearsal for the Grammy Awards in 1998. Groban, being shy, reluctantly agreed. Rosie O'Donnell was so impressed that she immediately invited him to appear on her daytime talk show. He got another big break when Foster asked him to sing at the California Governor's Gray Davis' 1999 inauguration.\n\nJustin Bieber\n\nBorn in Stratford, Ontario in Canada on March 1, 1994, Justin Drew Bieber quickly became the teenage heart throb for 2009. Before he was famous, Justin Bieber enjoyed playing sports - especially hockey because he's from Canada. His parents were young when they had him, and broke up when he was a young child. Many of Justin Bieber's friends growing up didn't even know he could sing - he didn't exactly advertise it.\n\nJustin used to sit outside a theatre in Stratford Ontario, famous for the Shakespeare Festival, and play the guitar and sing for crowds that would gather. He always had either one of his grandparents or mom with him as he was too young to hang out there alone. Bieber had many videos of himself singing at various venues on youtube - his mom videotaped all his performances along the way. When people would call and ask about managing his career, his mom was reluctant because of the horror stories everyone hears about young stars.\n\nJustin was discovered singing on youtube.com by his agent, who quickly arranged for him to fly to Georgia to meet with Usher. Just a short time later, the young star, who has two top tens on youtube, signed with Island Records.\n\nKenny Loggins\n\nKenneth Clark Loggins is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. His early songwriting compositions were recorded with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band in 1970 which led to seven albums, performing as the group Loggins and Messina from 1972 to 1977. As a solo artist, Loggins experienced a string of soundtrack successes, including an Academy Award nomination for \"Footloose\" in 1984. His early soundtrack contributions date back to the film A Star Is Born in 1976, and for much of the 1980s and 1990s, he was known as \"The Soundtrack King\". Finally Home was released in 2013, shortly after Loggins formed the group Blue Sky Riders with Gary Burr and Georgia Middlema\n\nLionel Richie\n\nA founder member of the Commodores, Lionel Richie's debut solo album was a U.S. #3 hit in 1982, and \"Truly,\" a ballad from that album, reached #1, winning him a Grammy. He performed one of his most popular hits, \"All Night Long\" (1983), at the closing ceremony of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games and co-wrote the famine relief song \"We Are the World\" with Michael Jackson in 1993.\n\nA founder member of the Commodores, his debut solo album Lionel Richie (1982) was a US number 3 hit, and 'Truly', a ballad from that album, reached US number 1, winning him a Grammy award.

Armstrong was a charismatic, innovative performer whose musical skills and bright personality transformed jazz from a rough regional dance music into a popular art form. Probably the most famous jazz musician of the 20th century, he first achieved fame as a trumpeter, but towards the end of his career he was best known as a vocalist and was one of the most influential jazz singers.\n\nKnown for his brilliant improvisation techniques both onstage and during recordings, Louis Armstrong became one of the Jazz movement's most important musicians. As his trumpet would cease, his voice would shine. Able to perform and improvise with his voice as much as with his trumpet, he laid the foundation for a long-lasting, ideal and charismatic career.\n\nMichael W. Smith\n\nMichael Whitaker Smith is an American musician, who has charted in both contemporary Christian and mainstream charts.
