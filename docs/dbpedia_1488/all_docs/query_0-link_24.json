        "text": "REG-1-004 Permits\n\n004.01 Every person engaging in business as a retailer in Nebraska must obtain a sales tax permit by submitting a Nebraska Tax Application, Form 20, or register through an alternative method as authorized under the Streamlined Sales Tax Agreement.\n\n004.02 Engaging in business in this state means and includes any of the following:\n\n004.02A Maintaining, occupying, or using permanently or temporarily, directly or indirectly, or through an agent, by whatever name called, an office, place of distribution, sales or sample room or place, warehouse or storage place or other place of business in this state;\n\n004.02B Having any representatives, agents, salesmen, canvassers, or solicitors operating in this state under the authority of the retailer or a subsidiary of the retailer for the purposes of selling, delivering, or taking of orders for any property;\n\n004.02C Deriving receipts from the rental or lease of property in this state;\n\n004.02D Soliciting retail sales of property from residents of this state on a continuous, regular, or systematic basis by means of advertising which is broadcast from or relayed from a transmitter within this state or distributed from a location within this state;\n\n004.02E Soliciting orders from residents of this state for property by mail, if the solicitations are continuous, regular, seasonal, or systematic and if the retailer benefits from any banking, financing, debt collection, or marketing activities occurring in this state or benefits from the location in this state of authorized installation, servicing, or repair facilities;\n\n004.02F Being owned or controlled by the same interests which own or control any retailer engaged in business in the same or similar line of business in this state;\n\n004.02G Maintaining or having a franchisee or licensee operating under the retailer‘s trade name in this state if the franchisee or licensee is required to collect the tax under the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967; or\n\n004.02H Doing any of the above as a retailer of services or on behalf of a retailer of services enumerated as taxable in Reg-1-007, Gross Receipts.\n\n004.03 A separate application for each Nebraska retail location is required unless applying through the Streamlined Sales Tax Agreement.\n\n004.04 Out-of-state retailers who are not engaged in business as specified in 004.02, are not required to obtain a permit. However, as a service to their Nebraska customers, those retailers are encouraged to obtain a license which allows them to collect and remit the tax in the same manner as a retailer who is engaged in business in this state. This will preclude the purchasers from having to accrue and remit their consumer's use tax liability directly to the Department of Revenue.\n\n004.05 Upon examination and approval of the application, the Department of Revenue shall issue to the retailer the appropriate sales tax permit for each Nebraska business location. The permit is permanent, not transferrable, and valid only for the retailer in whose name it is issued and for the conduct of business at the place designated. The permit must be conspicuously displayed at the place of business.\n\n004.05A Retailers moving their locations may file a Nebraska change request to change the location address shown on their permits. New permits with the new address will be issued.\n\n004.06 Retailers who temporarily will not be making any sales, may cancel their permits. When sales are resumed, the permits may be reinstated without any charge.\n\n004.07 Upon violation of any of the sales tax statutes or regulations, the Department of Revenue may revoke or suspend the permit or permits of the violator. The procedures for revocation hearings are contained in Practice and Procedure Reg-33-008.\n\n004.07A Following the revocation of a sales tax permit, the Department of Revenue will consider issuance of another permit only if all tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, have been paid in full, and sufficient security has been posted with the Department to ensure future compliance.\n\n004.07A(1) The amount of the security required before the Department will reissue a sales tax permit will be no greater than three times the estimated average amount payable for the seller's reporting period or five times the estimated average amount payable for the reporting period in the case of persons habitually delinquent.\n\n004.08 Anyone whose permit has been previously suspended or revoked shall pay the Department of Revenue, in addition to the required security specified in Reg-004.07A(1), a fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for the renewal or reissuance of a permit in the event of a first revocation, and fifty dollars ($50.00) for each successive revocation. A new permit will not be issued to the same person until the Department of Revenue is satisfied that such person will comply with the sales and use tax statutes and regulations.\n\n004.09 Anyone who engages in business as a retailer in this state without a permit or permits or after a permit has been suspended, and each officer of any corporation which so engages in business, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Upon conviction thereof, such person and each such officer shall be fined an amount not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) per each day of operation.\n\n(Sections 77-2701.13 and 77-2713(3), R.R.S. 2003, and sections 77-2703(2), 77-2705, 77-27,131, R.S.Supp., 2008. February 22, 2009)\n\nPrint this regulation\n\nREG-005 Retailers and Sellers\n\n005.01 Retailer means any seller and wherever either of these terms is used, it is construed to include the other. Retailer includes:\n\n005.01A Any person engaged in the business of selling, leasing, or renting property or services whenever the receipts are subject to sales tax;\n\n005.01B Any person engaged in the business of making sales at auction of tangible personal property for storage, use, or other consumption, or who is collecting the proceeds of an auction (Reg-1-034 Auction and Consignment Sales);\n\n005.01C Any person who leases or rents tangible personal property to another for storage, use, or other consumption, except film rentals when sales tax is charged on the admission, and interchanged railroad rolling stock (Reg-1-018 Rent or Lease of Tangible Personal Property);\n\n005.01D Any person who is renting or furnishing lodging for periods of less than 30 days, except a facility which is either licensed under the Health Care Facility Licensure Act of the Nebraska Revised Statutes, or operated by an educational institution established or recognized under Chapter 79 or 85 of the Nebraska Revised Statutes, when rooms are regularly used to house students for a consideration for periods in excess of 30 days (Reg-1-046, Hotels, Lodgings, and Accommodations);\n\n005.01E Any person who is furnishing telephone, mobile telecommunications, telegraph, gas, electricity, sewer, or water service (Reg-1-065, Telecommunications Service, and Reg-1-066, Sewer and Water);\n\n005.01F Any person who is furnishing community or county antenna television service or satellite programming service (Reg-1-081, Community or County Antenna Television Service);\n\n005.01G Any person who is charging admissions, except admissions charged by elementary or secondary schools, public or private, or school districts, student organizations, or parent-teacher associations pursuant to an agreement with proper school authorities, or admissions to fund-raising events by ballot question committees, candidate committees, independent committees, and political party committees that are registered with the Political Accountability and Disclosure Commission or are for candidates for federal office (Reg-1-044, Admissions);\n\n005.01H Any person who is renting or otherwise furnishing tangible personal property under an agreement requiring the periodic cleaning or laundering of such tangible personal property (Reg-1-049, Linen and Clothing Suppliers);\n\n005.01I Any person who is selling or otherwise providing warranties, guarantees, service contracts, or maintenance agreements covering taxable property or services (Reg-1-074, Warranties and Guarantees);\n\n005.01J Any person who is selling or otherwise providing computer software or computer software training, when provided by the retailer that sold the software (Reg-1-088 Computer Software);\n\n005.01K Any contractor who has elected to be treated as a retailer, or any contractor who has failed to make an election (Reg-1-017, Contractors);\n\n005.01L Any person who is selling live plants, other than as a part of the transfer of an improvement to real estate or the real estate (Reg-1-017, Contractors);\n\n005.01M Any person who is the promoter, operator, or organizer of a fair, flea market, craft show, or similar event (Reg-1-033, Transient and Itinerant Sellers.)\n\n005.01M(1) Retailer does not include any person making sales at a fair, flea market, craft show, or similar event when the licensed promoter, operator, or organizer has arranged to remit the sales tax on behalf of that person for the show.\n\n005.01N Any person providing any of the following:\n\n005.01N(1) Animal specialty services, except for veterinary services and specialty services performed on livestock (Reg-1-102, Animal Specialty Services);\n\n005.01N(2) Building cleaning services (Reg-1-098, Building Cleaning);\n\n005.01N(3) Digital audio works, digital audiovisual works, digital books, and digital codes;\n\n005.01N(4) Installing and applying tangible personal property where the sale of the property is subject to tax (Reg-1-082, Labor Charges);\n\n005.01N(5) Motor vehicle washing, waxing, towing, and painting services (Reg-1-099, Motor Vehicle Services);\n\n005.01N(6) Pest control services (Reg-1-100, Pest Control Services);\n\n005.01N(7) Recreational vehicle park services (Reg-1-103, Recreational Vehicle Park Services);\n\n005.01N(8) Repairing or maintaining tangible personal property, except motor vehicles, where the sale of the property would be subject to tax (Reg-1-082, Labor Charges);

The distributor must collect and remit tax from representatives on the sales price of each item sold at the tax rate imposed at the delivery location of each sale. When the distributor has entered into this agreement, the individual representatives are not required to hold their own sales tax permits.\n\n005.03 A person does not have to be engaged solely in a retail business in order to be liable for collecting, reporting, and remitting the sales and use tax. Manufacturers, producers, or wholesalers are liable for collection of the tax to the extent that they make sales at retail or have gross receipts which are taxable. Sales are sales for resale only if a resale certificate is received from the purchaser. All other sales are presumed to be taxable.\n\n005.04 Model 1 seller means a seller that has selected a certified service provider as its agent to perform all the seller’s sales and use tax functions, other than the seller’s obligation to remit tax on its own retail purchases.\n\n005.05 Model 2 seller means a seller that has selected a certified automated system to perform part of its sales and use tax functions but retains responsibility for remitting the tax.\n\n005.06 Model 3 seller means a seller that has sales in at least five member states of the Streamlined Sales Tax Agreement, has total annual sales revenue of at least five hundred million dollars, has a proprietary system that calculates the amount of tax due each jurisdiction, and has entered into a performance agreement with the member states that establishes a tax performance standard for the seller.\n\n(Sections 77-2701.16, 77-2701.21, 77-2701.22, 77-2701.23, 77-2701.31, 77-2701.32, and 77-2705, R.R.S 2009. June 6, 2011.)\n\nPrint this regulation\n\nREG-1-006 Retail Sale or Sale at Retail\n\n006.01 Retail sale or sale at retail means any sale, lease, or rental for any purpose other than for resale, sublease, or subrent.\n\n006.01A Gross receipts from sales at retail in this state are taxable except as otherwise provided.\n\n006.01B Retail sale includes the sale or exchange of property or services for property, for money, or for services. Retail sale includes every transaction constituting a sale, whether conditional, installment, credit, or otherwise. In general, retail sale or sale at retail includes all sales of tangible personal property, or of other items the gross receipts of which are taxable. (Reg-1-007, Gross Receipts).\n\n006.02 The test of a sale at retail is whether or not the sale is to a purchaser for use or consumption and not for resale. Services are generally consumed by the purchaser and are only rarely purchased for resale. (See Reg-1-013, Sale for Resale, or Reg-1-023, Ingredient or Component Part).\n\n006.03 The question of who makes the sale is immaterial. The controlling consideration is whether it is a sale to a final consumer or user and not for resale.\n\n006.04 The location of the sale is generally where the purchaser or lessee takes delivery of the property or service.\n\n006.04A The sale occurs in this state even if the buyer intends to take the property or service to another state.\n\n006.04B Freight terms such as FOB shipping point or FOB destination, or declarations of the parties made after the completion of the transaction are not sufficient to show where the sale occurs.\n\n006.05 If the location where the purchaser takes delivery of the property or service cannot be determined, the sale is taxed at the address for the purchaser according to the retailer's records.\n\n006.06 If the retailer's records do not contain an address for the purchaser, an address obtained during the transaction, including from a payment document, may be used.\n\n006.07 If the location of the sale cannot be determined under any of the above, the sale is taxed at the location from which the property was shipped, from which the digital goods or computer software was first available for transmission by the seller, or from which the service was provided.\n\n006.08 The sale of utilities occurs where the meter is located or the connection is furnished.\n\n006.09 A sale of a maintenance agreement with the covered property occurs where the property is delivered, or where the motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, or motorboat is registered.\n\n006.09A A sale of a maintenance agreement separate from the covered property occurs at the location where the property being covered is normally used.\n\n006.10 A sale occurs in another state when the seller is required by the terms of the sale to deliver the property or service to a point outside this state.\n\n006.10A The Department of Revenue will assume that delivery is required when the item is so large or dangerous that it requires special handling, the seller normally provides the special handling, and the seller actually delivers the item in another state.\n\n006.10B Acceptable proof of transportation outside this state is a waybill or bill of lading, an insurance or other receipt issued by the United States Postal Service, or a trip sheet signed by both the seller's delivery agent and the person who received the goods.\n\n006.10C If the property or service is returned to Nebraska after delivery by the seller, it is taxable in Nebraska. The buyer must pay the use tax directly to the Department of Revenue.\n\n006.11 The provisions of this regulation do not apply to motor vehicles, trailers, and semitrailers which are sold, rented, or leased for periods of one year or more; to motorboats which are sold, rented, or leased for periods of one year or more, or to sales of aircraft that do not qualify as transportation equipment as defined in Reg-1-019, Rental or Lease of Vehicles.

November 6, 2010.)\n\nPrint this regulation\n\nREG-1-008 Records\n\n008.01 Retailers are Required to Keep Records. Every retailer is required to keep records necessary to determine the amount of tax due. These records must include the normal books of account ordinarily maintained by the average prudent businessperson engaged in a similar activity, together with all documents supporting entries in the books of account. Schedules and working papers used in preparing tax returns must also be retained.\n\n008.01A Every retailer must keep exempt sale certificates, resale certificates, energy source exemption certificates, or other adequate proof to support a tax exemption for any sales. The retailer must keep all documentation necessary to support deductions from gross receipts on the tax return.\n\n008.01B Model 1, 2, and 3 sellers may maintain records in accordance with the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement.\n\n008.02 The records created at the time of sale may be sales slips, sales invoices, guest checks, tally sheets, itemized lists, or other memoranda. A cash register tape may be acceptable if it preserves sufficient information.\n\n008.02A Property may be described by a symbol if the symbol is representative of a class of merchandise or services which are always taxable or tax exempt. If a retailer sells only tax exempt merchandise in a \"Department P,\" a description of this merchandise as \"Department P\" is sufficient if the retailer uses that symbol consistently to describe the same merchandise.\n\n008.02B However, if a retailer sells several types of merchandise, both taxable and tax exempt, in a single department, his or her records must individually identify the types of merchandise which are tax exempt.\n\n008.03 When Tax is Commingled with Receipts. A retailer who maintains records where the amount of tax collected is commingled with the receipts from the sale may determine taxable receipts in the following manner:\n\n008.03A The receipts from any sales which are specifically exempt or otherwise excluded from sales tax are subtracted from total receipts. The remainder represents the receipts from the taxable sales plus the tax collected, and\n\n008.03B The remainder is divided by one plus the rate of tax in effect.\n\n008.04 Records Required to Determine Use Tax. Every person storing, using, or otherwise consuming property in Nebraska must keep receipts, invoices, and other pertinent records necessary to establish the amount of tax for which the person is liable. Any person having information relating to taxable sales of property in the person's possession or custody, may be required at any time to submit the names and addresses of the purchasers, the sales price of the property, and the date of the sale.\n\n008.05 Right to Examine Records. The Tax Commissioner or any person authorized in writing by the Tax Commissioner may examine the books, papers, records, electronic media, or equipment of any person to ascertain or verify the accuracy of any return filed; or, if no return is filed by the person, to ascertain and determine the amount required to be paid. The right to examine books, papers, records, electronic media, and equipment of any person includes, but is not limited to, the right to request and retain paper or electronic copies of the books, papers, records, and media.\n\n008.06 Administrative Subpoenas. The Tax Commissioner may require persons undergoing an audit, examination, or review to provide records that are necessary to make a proper determination of the person's compliance with, or the amount due under, the laws of this state. If warranted, the Tax Commissioner may issue an administrative subpoena.\n\n008.06A An administrative subpoena must clearly state the scope of the demand for records and any other requirements and state when, where, and how to comply with the administrative subpoena.\n\n008.06B An administrative subpoena may be enforced by the Attorney General, acting on behalf of the Tax Commissioner, in an action filed in the District Court of Lancaster County.\n\n008.07 Records must be retained for a minimum of three years after the return is filed, or while any refund claim or petition for redetermination of a deficiency determination is pending, unless the Nebraska Department of Revenue (Department) authorizes their destruction in writing at an earlier date. However, the Department may issue a deficiency determination within six years after any amount of tax is determined due and payable when a properly completed return has not been filed or the amount of the deficiency exceeds 25% of the amount stated on the return.\n\n008.08 When records are missing, all gross receipts are presumed to be taxable, or the Department may estimate a person's liability for tax based on the best available records. The person required to keep the records has the burden to show that the gross receipts are not taxable or that the estimate is incorrect.\n\n(Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 77-366, 77-375, 77-376, 77-377, 77-2705(7), 77-2709, and 77-2711. June 24, 2017.)\n\nPrint this regulation\n\nREG-1-009 Accounting Methods\n\n009.01 Gross sales must be reported in accordance with the method of accounting regularly employed in keeping the books of the particular taxpayer. Retailers may use either the cash basis, accrual basis, or any other generally recognized accounting basis which correctly reflects the operation of the business. When a basis of accounting has been adopted for reporting sales tax, the retailer may not change that basis of accounting without prior permission from the Department of Revenue.\n\n009.02 Retailers maintaining their regular books and records on the cash basis shall make returns on the basis of cash received during the period, provided this basis clearly reflects the operation of the business.\n\n009.03 Retailers maintaining their regular books and records on the accrual basis, or any other basis of accounting recognized under generally accepted accounting principles, shall make returns on that basis and shall report all sales recorded during the period on the corresponding Nebraska and Local Sales and Use Tax Return, Form 10.\n\n009.04 As is explained in Reg-1-016, Changes in Rate of Tax, the basis on which returns are required to be made shall also serve as the basis for determining the rate at which the tax is to be collected by the retailer from the purchaser.\n\n009.05 Retailers maintaining their books and records on the accrual basis, may elect to defer remittance of sales tax not yet collected on credit, conditional, and installment sales. If such election is made, it shall be pursuant to the following conditions:\n\n009.05A The election must be submitted in writing to the Nebraska Department of Revenue prior to the retailer's change in reporting,\n\n009.05B Such election shall become effective the first day of the month following the month the notice of election is received by the Department; provided, such notice is postmarked no later than the 15th day of the month. Elections postmarked after the 15th day of the month shall become effective the first day of the next succeeding month (i.e., election notice postmarked September 10, effective date of election, October 1; election notice postmarked September 17, effective date of election, November 1.)\n\n009.05C The election will be acknowledged by the Department; such acknowledgment is to be maintained with the retailer's records.\n\n009.05D This option is available only to retailers who finance their own sales or discount them to a qualified subsidiary corporation.\n\n009.05D(1) Retailers who accept bank or similar credit cards or who discount their credit sales to a third party, may not defer the sales tax remittance on these sales. However, retailers who both carry their own credit and discount some credit sales to a third party, may defer the sales tax remittance on that portion of credit sales carried by the retailer.\n\n009.05D(2) Retailers who discount their credit sales to a subsidiary corporation may elect to defer the sales tax until the subsidiary receives payment on the account. If the subsidiary corporation does not obtain a Nebraska sales tax permit, the retailer must obtain a surety bond in favor of the State of Nebraska in an amount not less than two (2) times the amount of sales tax payable on outstanding Nebraska accounts receivable held by the subsidiary as of the end of the prior calendar year. The Nebraska Department of Revenue will provide the necessary information and bond conditions upon written request. Each retailer maintaining a surety bond, shall review the amount of each bond at the close of each calendar year, adjusting same to reflect the minimum bond requirement.\n\n009.05D(3) Failure of the subsidiary to maintain a sales tax permit, or of the retailer to maintain a bond in the required amount shall result in all sales tax not previously remitted on recorded sales becoming due and payable. The tax must be paid by the next required sales tax return filing date.\n\n009.05E Once in effect, this election shall remain in force for a period of not less than one (1) year from the date the election becomes effective.\n\n009.05F Retailers who wish to discontinue remitting under this option and remit sales tax in accordance with paragraph 009.03, are required to notify the Department. Payment of all deferred sales taxes will be remitted on their next required sales tax filing date corresponding to the tax period within which the notice is received by the Department. Should a retailer discontinue business while under this option, all deferred sales taxes must be remitted on its final sales tax return.\n\n009.05G For retailers deferring sales tax remittances, the amount of tax due on a sale is determined by the sales tax rate in effect at the time the sale is recorded.\n\n009.05H Retailers deferring sales tax remittances under this option do not qualify for the bad debt deduction as sales tax is remitted after the receipt of payment.(Reg-1-028, Bad Debts)\n\n(Section 77-2701.10, 77-2703(1), and 77-2708(1)(b)(iv), R.S.Supp., 2008. February 22, 2009.)\n\nPrint this regulation\n\nREG-1-010 the Sales and Use Tax Return\n\nThis regulation has been marked with an asterisk and has been affected by legislation or court cases, and is currently undergoing review. LB 851 (2014) increased the statute of limitations for issuing a deficiency determination to six years if the taxpayer files a false or fraudulent return with the intent to evade the sales or use tax, or omits an amount from the return that is in excess of 25% of the amount of tax. This regulation is currently undergoing review for amendment.\n\n010.01 A retailer must file a return for each reporting period or portion of a reporting period. The return must be filed for every tax reporting period even if there have been no sales.\n\n010.02 The filing frequency is the reporting period assigned by the Nebraska Department of Revenue (Department). Except as provided below, annual returns are required if the retailer's yearly tax liability is less than $900, quarterly returns are required if the yearly tax liability is $900 or more and less than $3,000, and monthly returns are required if the yearly tax liability is $3,000 or more.\n\n010.02A Sellers who are Model 1, 2, or 3 sellers may follow the filing frequency guidelines outlined in the Streamlined Sales Tax Agreement (SSUTA).\n\n010.02B Sellers who are registered under the SSUTA, but do not have a legal requirement to register in the state, and who are not Model 1, 2, or 3 sellers, may follow the filing frequency guidelines outlined in the SSUTA.\n\n010.02C Retailers who have not obtained a permit or been assigned a filing frequency have a monthly filing frequency.\n\n010.02D The Tax Commissioner has discretion to assign an annual return for seasonal retailers, even if the yearly tax liability exceeds the amounts listed in Reg-1-010.02.\n\n010.03 Retailers must report and account for gross receipts.\n\n010.03A The return includes both a sales tax return and a use tax return. Unless there are amounts, words, statements, numbers, zeros, or figures shown on the appropriate lines of a paper Nebraska and Local Sales and Use Tax Return, Form 10, mailing the form to the Department does not constitute the filing of either or both returns.\n\n010.03A(1) If the retailer files a return, the statute of limitations for issuing a deficiency determination is three years after the last day of the month following the reporting period, or three years after the return was filed, whichever is later. If the retailer fails to file a return, the statute of limitations for issuing a deficiency determination is five years after the last day of the month following the reporting period.\n\n010.03A(2) If the retailer does not enter amounts, words, statements, numbers, zeros, or figures on a paper Nebraska and Local Sales and Use Tax Return, Form 10, the statute of limitations for issuing a deficiency determination for that reporting period is extended beyond three years to five years. This extension of the statute of limitations does not apply to returns that are electronically filed.\n\n010.03A(3) Statements by the retailer that no sales were made or no tax is due, or entries made by the Department to the account of the retailer indicating that no tax is due, do not constitute the filing of either or both returns and does not limit the statute of limitations to three years.\n\n010.03B The return must be filed within 20 days following the end of the reporting period. The retailer is entitled to deduct and withhold a collection fee from the amount of sales tax which otherwise would be due. No fee may be deducted for reporting use tax or tax remitted pursuant to a direct payment permit.\n\n010.03C The Tax Commissioner will accept the format for filing and payment methods allowed pursuant to the SSUTA.\n\n010.03D The Tax Commissioner may require some or all taxpayers to file returns and remit payments electronically.\n\n010.04 Unless otherwise provided in the SSUTA, the Tax Commissioner may require that returns be signed by the person required to file the return or by his or her duly authorized agent.\n\n010.05 Returns that are not filed electronically must be properly signed.\n\n010.06 The return and the remittance are considered timely filed if received, delivered, or mailed, postage prepaid, on or before the 20th day of the month following the close of the reporting period. When the last day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or an approved holiday, the return is considered timely filed if received, delivered, or mailed, postage prepaid, on the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or an approved holiday.\n\n010.06A A United States Postal Service postmark is conclusive evidence of the date of mailing for the purpose of timely filing a return.\n\n010.06B A private postage meter date or a date stamped by a private delivery service will be considered the date of mailing if the date of the stamp is no more than four days before the date the return is received by the Department, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, or approved holidays. If the date of the stamp is more than four days before the date the return is received by the Department, the return is considered filed on the date received.\n\n010.06C Failure to file the return or to remit the tax due by the due date will subject the taxpayer to a penalty equal to 10% of the unpaid tax or $25.00, whichever is greater. Interest is imposed at the rate specified in Neb. Rev. Stat. § 45-104.02 from the due date to the date payment is received.\n\n010.07 Remittance must be in the form of a electronic funds transfer, check, credit card, draft, money order, or other payment method as approved by the Tax Commissioner, made payable to the Nebraska Department of Revenue. Cash, post-dated checks, or postage stamps cannot be sent as payment. Cash may be used when payment is made in person at an office of the Department.\n\n010.08 If any understatement on a return is a result of fraud or an intent to evade the sales or use tax, a penalty of 25% of the amount of the understatement or $50, whichever is greater, may be assessed.\n\n010.09 Criminal Penalties.\n\n010.09A Any person required to collect, account for, or pay over any sales or use taxes who willfully fails to collect, truthfully account for, or pay over these taxes is guilty of a Class IV felony.\n\n010.09B Any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade any sales or use taxes is guilty of a Class IV felony.\n\n010.09C Any person who willfully assists in or advises in preparing or filing a false or fraudulent return, is guilty of a Class IV felony, whether or not the falsity or fraud is with the knowledge or consent of the person authorized or required to file the return.\n\n(Neb. Rev. Stat. §§ 77-1784, 77-2705.01, 77-2708(1), 77-2709, 77-2712.05, 77-2713, and 77-27,125, and McDonald's Executive Offices v. Nebraska Department of Revenue, 243 Neb. 82 (1993).

Copies of the bracket schedule established by the Department of Revenue are available upon request.\n\n011.02 The sales or use tax liability may be computed by multiplying the sales price by the applicable tax rate in effect. All persons using machine or computer billing are authorized by the Department of Revenue to use a straight percentage basis of calculating the tax on such billings. If the calculation of the tax results in a fraction of a cent, the tax liability should be carried to the third decimal place and rounded to the nearest whole cent. If the third decimal place is four or less, round down and if the third decimal place is greater than four, round up.\n\n011.03 Although retail sales may be made on which no tax is collected because of the size of the sale, e.g., a 10-cent sale, the receipts from such sales are included in taxable sales on which the retailer must compute and remit the tax.\n\n011.04 When more than one item is purchased, the tax may be computed on the total amount of the combined taxable purchases or on the individual items. However, when the tax is allowed to be included in the amount of the purchase, the tax is computed on each item separately, rather than on the total of all purchases.\n\n(Section 77-3,117, R.R.S. 2003, and section 77-2703(1)(d), R.S.Supp., 2004.

Transactions may be exempt because of:\n\n012.01A The seller (entity-based exemption);\n\n012.01B The item sold (product-based exemption);\n\n012.01C The buyer (entity-based exemption);\n\n012.01D The buyer's intended use of the item (use-based exemption); or\n\n012.01E A combination of two or more of these characteristics.\n\n012.02 There is no single, comprehensive list of transactions, items, entities, and uses that are exempt from sales and use taxes.

The property may be resold either in the form or condition in which it was purchased, or as an ingredient or component part of other property. (Reg-1-023, Component Parts--Manufacturing, Processing, and Fabrication) A sale for resale includes a sale of property to a purchaser for the sole purpose of leasing or renting the property to others, if the lease or rental payments are at a fair market value.\n\n013.01A Fair market value is the price at which property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither having to buy or sell, and both having reasonable knowledge of all the necessary facts.\n\n013.01B A sale for resale does not include the sale of property to a purchaser whose subsequent lease or rental of that property is incidental to the lease or rental of real estate.\n\n013.02 The burden of proving that a sale of property is not a sale at retail is on the retailer (seller) unless the retailer accepts a properly completed resale certificate or obtains the relevant data elements showing that the property is purchased for the purpose of reselling, leasing, or renting in the regular course of the purchaser's business or is to be used as an ingredient or component part of other property to be sold, leased, or rented. The resale certificate is a part of the retailer's records and must be retained in the same manner as other sales tax records.\n\n013.03 A properly completed resale certificate received from the purchaser is proof for the retailer that the sale was for resale.\n\n013.03A To be properly completed, a resale certificate received before, in conjunction with, or within 90 days after the time of the sale must be fully completed as provided in subdivisions 013.03B(1) through 013.03B(4). A resale certificate received within 120 days after a request for substantiation made by the Department of Revenue (Department) must be both fully completed and accepted in good faith to be properly completed.\n\n013.03B To be fully completed, the resale certificate must include all of the following:\n\n013.03B(1) Identification of both the purchaser and the retailer including the type of business engaged in by the purchaser, and the reason for the exemption;\n\n013.03B(2) The sales tax permit number of the purchaser. If the purchaser is licensed as a retailer in Nebraska or another state which requires a permit, the resale certificate must include the sales tax permit number. If the purchaser has no sales tax permit number, the resale certificate must state the reason the purchaser has no sales tax permit number;\n\n013.0B(3) If a paper resale certificate is used, an authorized signature. In other cases, another form of authorization as allowed by the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement (SSUTA); and\n\n013.03B(4) The date of issuance.\n\n013.04 If a purchaser who gives a resale certificate makes any use of the property other than retention, demonstration, or display while holding it for sale, lease, or rental in the regular course of business, this use removes it from the \"sale for resale\" exemption category and the use is taxable to the purchaser at the time the property is first used for a purpose other than resale. Except for a purchaser of aircraft as provided in Reg-1-067, Aircraft and Related Services, the sales price of the property is the measure of the tax base. (See Reg-1-035, Consumption of Untaxed Property)\n\n013.05 The retailer or certified service provider (CSP) holding a properly completed resale certificate is relieved from liability for tax, penalty, and interest. However, retailers or CSPs who fraudulently fail to collect tax or who solicit purchasers to participate in unlawful claims of exemption are liable for the tax not collected, and any penalty and interest.\n\n013.06 A retailer or CSP who has a recurring business relationship with the purchaser is not required to obtain a separate resale certificate for each sale, but may accept a “blanket” resale certificate covering future sales. A recurring business relationship exists when sales occur at least once every 12 months.\n\n013.07 Sales where the retailer is required to make delivery outside of Nebraska need not be supported by resale certificates if the sales are supported by bills of lading, certificates of out-of-state delivery, or other documentation. However, where delivery to the out-of-state purchaser, or an agent of the purchaser, occurs in this state, sales tax must be collected unless the sale is otherwise exempt, in which case the retailer may accept a properly completed resale or exempt sale certificate.\n\n013.08 If a resale certificate or satisfactory evidence of the data elements in support of a claim that a sale is exempt cannot be produced for the Department within the time frames noted below, the retailer making the sale is responsible for the tax on the transaction.\n\n013.08A Retailers or CSPs are relieved from liability for the tax if a properly completed resale certificate is received or if the retailer or CSP otherwise obtains the relevant data elements supporting the exemption, prior to, in conjunction with, or within 90 days after the date of the sale.\n\n013.08B Retailers or CSPs are relieved from liability for the tax if a properly completed resale certificate is accepted in good faith, or if the retailer or CSP otherwise obtains the relevant data elements supporting the exemption, within 120 days after a request for substantiation made by the Department.\n\n013.08C Retailers or CSPs may only accept a fully completed resale certificate under subsection 013.08B of this section with a good faith belief that the purchase is a valid sale for resale to be relieved from liability. If the resale certificate is not received in good faith, the retailer or CSP is liable for the tax not collected, and any penalty and interest.\n\n013.09 Any purchaser, or agent of the purchaser, who issues a resale certificate to the retailer for any purchase taxable under the Nebraska Revenue Act, which is purchased for a use other than resale, lease, or rental in the regular course of the purchaser's business, is subject to a penalty of $100 or ten times the tax, whichever is larger, for each instance of presentation and misuse. With regard to a blanket resale certificate, the penalty applies to each purchase made during the period the blanket certificate is in effect.\n\n013.10 Any purchaser, or agent of the purchaser, who fraudulently signs a resale certificate with intent to avoid payment of the tax may, in addition to the penalty set out in section 013.09, be found guilty of a Class IV misdemeanor.\n\n013.11 The Department will recognize only the Nebraska Resale or Exempt Sale Certificate, Form 13, a previously approved paper or electronic substitute for this Form 13, the Multistate Tax Commission Uniform Sales and Use Tax Certificate, or a certificate of exemption authorized by the SSUTA.\n\n013.12 Retailers must maintain records of resale transactions. The Department may make and retain copies of any resale certificates.\n\n(Sections 77-2701.34, 77-2703(1)(f), 77-2706(1), (2), (3), and (4), 77-2706.01, and 77-2711(4), R.R.S. 2009. November 6, 2010.)\n\nPrint this regulation\n\nREG-1-014 Exempt Sale Certificate\n\n014.01 Certain sales, leases, or rentals, and the storage, use, or other consumption of property (services) are not taxable. Exempt transactions may be divided into four groups. The four groups are transactions that are exempt due to the characteristics of:\n\n014.01A The retailer (seller) (entity-based exemption);\n\n014.01B The property sold (product-based exemption);\n\n014.01C The buyer (entity-based exemption); and\n\n014.01D The buyer's intended use of the item (use-based exemption).\n\nTransactions described in subsections 014.01A and 014.01B do not need to be supported by exempt sale certificates, provided the retailer’s records clearly show the nature of the retailer and the property being sold. A purchaser making a purchase that is exempt because it is an occasional sale is required to obtain an exempt sale certificate or other documentation from the retailer that the sale was exempt.\n\nTransactions described in subsections 014.01C and 014.01D must be supported by exempt sale certificates or other suitable documentation. (See Reg-1-012, Exemptions)\n\n014.02 The burden of proving that any sale of property is not taxable is on the retailer and sufficient records must be kept which reveal the nature of each exempt sale. A retailer must obtain an exempt sale certificate or obtain the relevant data elements from the purchaser in support of the claim that the sale is exempt. The exempt sale certificate is a part of the retailer's records and must be retained in the same manner as other sales tax records.\n\n014.03 Exemption numbers in the form of numbered certificates of exemption are issued by the Nebraska Department of Revenue (Department) and must be provided by nonprofit organizations, public schools, and common or contract carriers when making exempt purchases. (See Reg-1-069, Common and Contract Carrier Vehicles, Reg-1-090, Nonprofit Organizations, and Reg-1-092, Educational Institutions)\n\n014.04 The following organizations are not issued numbered certificates of exemption by the Department: The United States government, its agencies, and corporations wholly owned by the United States government; the state, its agencies, and political subdivisions, other than public schools. Purchases by many Nebraska political subdivisions, all other states, and all political subdivisions of other states are taxable except for purchases of industrial machinery and equipment, including repair parts, where the other state grants a reciprocal exemption for Nebraska or its political subdivisions.\n\n014.05 A properly completed exempt sale certificate received from the purchaser is adequate proof for the retailer that the sale was exempt from the sales and use tax.\n\n014.05A To be properly completed, an exempt sale certificate received before, in conjunction with, or within 90 days after the time of the sale must be fully completed as provided in subdivisions 014.05B(1) through 014.05B(5). An exempt sale certificate received within 120 days after a request for substantiation made by the Department must be both fully completed and accepted in good faith to be properly completed.\n\n014.05B To be fully completed, the exemption certificate must include all of the following:\n\n014.05B(1) Identification of both purchaser and retailer;\n\n014.05B(2) A statement of the basis for exemption, including the type of activity engaged in by the purchaser ;\n\n014.05B(3) A statement that the certificate is for a single purchase or is a blanket certificate covering future sales;\n\n014.05B(4) If a paper certificate is provided, an authorized signature. In other cases, another form of authorization as allowed by the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement (SSUTA); and\n\n014.05B(5) The date of issuance.\n\n014.06 The retailer or certified service provider (CSP) holding a properly completed exempt sale certificate is relieved from liability for tax, penalty, and interest. However, retailers or CSPs who fraudulently fail to collect tax or who solicit purchasers to participate in unlawful claims of exemption are liable for the tax not collected, and any penalty and interest.\n\n014.07 A retailer or CSP who has a recurring business relationship with the same purchaser is not required to obtain a separate exempt sale certificate for each sale but may accept a “blanket” certificate covering future sales. A recurring business relationship exists when sales occur at least once every 12 months.\n\n014.08 If an exempt sale certificate or satisfactory evidence in support of a claim that a sale is exempt cannot be provided to the Department within the time frames noted below, the retailer making the sale is responsible for the tax on the transaction.\n\n014.08A Retailers or CSPs are relieved from liability for tax if a properly completed exemption certificate is received, or if the retailer or CSP otherwise obtains the relevant data elements supporting the exemption, prior to, in conjunction with, or within 90 days after the date of the sale.\n\n014.08B Retailers or CSPs are relieved from liability for the tax if a properly completed exemption certificate is accepted in good faith, or if the retailer or CSP otherwise obtains the relevant data elements supporting the exemption in good faith, within 120 days after a request for substantiation made by the Department.\n\n014.08C Retailers or CSPs may only accept a fully completed exemption certificate under subsection 014.08B of this section with a good faith belief that the purchase is a valid exempt sale to be relieved from liability. If the exemption certificate is not received in good faith, the retailer or CSP is liable for the tax not collected, and any penalty and interest.\n\n014.09 Any purchaser, or agent of the purchaser, who issues an exempt sale certificate to the retailer for any purchase which is not exempt from sales and use tax under the Nebraska Revenue Act, is subject to a penalty of $100 or ten times the tax, whichever is larger, for each instance of presentation and misuse. With regard to a blanket exempt sale certificate, the penalty applies to each purchase made during the period the blanket certificate is in effect.\n\n014.10 Any purchaser, or agent of the purchaser, who fraudulently signs an exempt sale certificate with intent to avoid payment of the tax may, in addition to the penalty set out in section 014.09, be found guilty of a Class IV misdemeanor.\n\n014.11 The Department will recognize only the Nebraska Resale or Exempt Sale Certificate, Form 13, a previously approved paper or electronic substitute, a Nebraska Energy Source Exemption Certificate, Form 13E, a Nebraska Certificate of Exemption for Mobility Enhancing Equipment, Form 13ME, or a certificate of exemption authorized by the SSUTA for all sales except sales to the federal government. Sales to the federal government, or an agency or wholly owned corporation of the federal government, may be supported in either of two ways. First, the exemption may be supported by a regular federal certificate of exemption form. An alternative procedure is maintaining purchase documentation clearly identifying the purchaser as the federal government, or an agency or wholly owned corporation of the federal government. The best documents available are those which show payment was made by a United States Treasury Department warrant. (Reg-1-072, United States Government and Federal Corporations)\n\n014.12 Retailers must maintain records of exempt transactions. The Department may make and retain copies of any exempt sale certificate.\n\n(Sections 77-2703(1)(f), 77-2705(7) and (8), 77-2706, 77-2711(3)(a) and (4), and 77- 2713(5), R.R.S. 2009. November 6, 2010.)\n\nPrint this regulation\n\nREG-1-015 Common and Contract Carriers (Multistate Operations) - Tax Deferral\n\n015.01 Any person, firm, or corporation operating as a common or contract carrier engaged in multistate operations, may apply to the Nebraska Department of Revenue for special permission to defer the incidence of the sales and use tax on certain purchases within or without this state, where the item purchased is first stored here for subsequent use in multistate operations, and at the time of purchase, the final location of the use of the item is unknown. The special permission referred to in this regulation is not related to the common and contract carrier exemption referred to in Reg-1-069, Common and Contract Carrier Vehicles.\n\n015.02 Upon receipt of a request for permission to defer taxes, an investigation will be made to determine whether the applicant maintains satisfactory records to show where the purchased property is actually used. Such request must be written and be accompanied by a $10.00 fee. If a favorable report results from the investigation, the Nebraska Department of Revenue will issue a special permission letter to the respective common or contract carrier. This special permission letter is issued in the form of a certificate of exemption. The common or contract carrier receiving the letter should furnish a copy of the letter to those vendors from whom purchases are made where use is unknown at the time of purchase in order that sales or use tax will be excluded from such purchases. Such letter shall not be used when purchases are made which knowingly have been or will be used or consumed within this state.\n\n015.03 A retailer (seller) repeatedly making the same type of exempt sale to common or contract carriers need not take a separate copy of the special permission letter for each sale but may, at his or her risk, take a blanket certificate covering all future sales. If the Nebraska Department of Revenue determines that any such sale was not exempt, the retailer (seller) shall be liable for the tax, penalty, and interest. If a single special permission letter is taken, identification of the common or contract carrier must appear upon the memoranda created at the time of sale.\n\n015.04 When items that were purchased tax exempt are later used in this state by the common or contract carrier, use tax is due at the applicable rate in effect at the time of use. This liability must be reported on the appropriate return to be filed for the period corresponding to the month of use.\n\n(Section 77-2706(6), R.R.S. 1943.January 24, 1993.)\n\nPrint this regulation\n\nREG-1-016 Changes in the Rate of Tax\n\nThis regulation has been marked with an asterisk and has been affected by legislation or court cases, and is currently undergoing review. Legislation has repealed the special provision for motor vehicle leases contained in Reg-1-016.02A. This regulation is currently undergoing review for amendment (Neb. Rev. Stat. § 77-2703).\n\n016.01 The rate at which the sales and use tax is imposed is subject to change or the base may be altered by legislation which extends the tax to transactions previously not taxed. The purpose of this regulation is to set out the manner in which such occurrences will affect the tax on sales and purchases made where pre-existing contracts or obligations are involved so that retailers and consumers alike can take note of possible increases for which they may become liable.\n\n016.02 For sales, leases, or rentals, the sales tax is imposed and shall be collected and remitted by the retailer at the rate in effect at the time the gross receipts are recorded as sales under the accounting method used by the retailer to maintain his or her books and records. A lease or rental agreement which extends through a tax rate change, will recognize the changed tax rate on payments recorded on or after the rate change. (Reg-1-009, Accounting Methods.)\n\n016.02A For the rental or lease of a motor vehicle, the sales tax is imposed at the rate in effect at the time of the delivery of the motor vehicle regardless of changes in the rate during the term of the lease.\n\n016.03 If the use tax is not required to be remitted at the time of purchase, the applicable use tax rate is that rate in effect at the time of use according to the accounting basis used to maintain the taxpayer's books and records.\n\n016.04 The retailer on a cash basis of accounting will collect and report the tax at the rate in effect at the time he or she receives a payment without regard to whether the payment is in satisfaction of an obligation predating a change in the rate. The retailer using an accrual basis of accounting will collect and report the tax at the rate in effect at the time he or she records the sale.\n\n016.05 Persons providing services covering a period starting before, and ending after, the effective date of a rate change will bill tax as follows: (a) for a rate increase, the change will apply to the first billing period starting on or after the effective date of the change; and (b) for a rate decrease, the change will apply to bills rendered on or after the effective date of the change.\n\n016.06 When construction contractors operating under either Option 2 or Option 3 purchase construction materials to be consumed by them, they are obligated to pay the tax on the same basis as other consumers without regard to whether the purchase of such materials is for use in completion of a construction contract executed prior to a change in the rate. However, when a written contract exists for a fixed-price construction, reconstruction, alteration, or improvement project and the sales tax rate is increased during the term of that fixed-price contract, the contractor may apply for a refund of the increased sales tax; provided, such refund amount exceeds ten dollars ($10.00). The contractor must submit a copy of the contract and any other evidence necessary to establish his or her entitlement to the refund.\n\n016.06A In the event that the sales tax rate is decreased during the term of the fixed-price contract, the contractor shall pay to the Department of Revenue the difference between the decreased tax rate and the tax rate in effect prior to the decrease; provided, the amount of such payment exceeds ten dollars ($10.00). This procedure results in the contractor's final sales tax liability on fixed-price written contracts, to equal the rate in effect at the time the contract was entered into.\n\n016.07 For fixed-price contracts in which the contractor labor is taxable and which were in progress on October 1, 2007, the date on which such contractor labor became exempt, , the taxpayer shall pay to the Department of Revenue the difference between the decreased tax collected and the tax that would have been due on the contractor labor prior to the change; provided, the amount of such payment exceeds ten dollars ($10.00). Failure to make the required payment constitutes a criminal act.\n\n(Section 77-2701.03, R.R.S. 2003, and sections 77-2703(1) and (2), 77-2704.32, and 77-2704.33, R.S.Supp., 2008. February 22, 2009.)\n\nPrint this regulation\n\nREG-1-017 Contractors\n\n017.01 Gross receipts from construction projects or the repair of real estate or fixtures are generally exempt from sales or use tax, except as otherwise stated in this regulation.

There are three options available to the contractor for the taxation of building materials. The choice of an option is made by the Nebraska Department of Labor's online Contractor/Subcontractor Registration Application located at www.dol.nebraska.gov. The contractor/subcontractor registration information, including the contractor option elected, is displayed in the Contractor Registration Database. Before performing any construction work in Nebraska, a contractor must be registered in the Contractor Registration Database.\n\n017.03A The option selected applies to all construction contracts. A contractor may not operate under more than one option at the same time.\n\n017.03B If the registration application is not completed or an election is not made, the contractor will be treated as a retailer under Option 1 for sales and use tax purposes.\n\n017.04 Contractors may change their option using the Department of Labor's website (www.dol.nebraska.gov) for contractor/subcontractor registration. The new contractor option applies to all contracts in progress and also to all new contracts.\n\n017.04A Any contractor who changes from a tax-free inventory (Option 1 or Option 3) to a tax-paid inventory (Option 2) must remit use tax to the Department of Revenue (Department) on all building materials in inventory on the date the change is effective. The contractor must also begin paying sales tax on all purchases as of the date the change is effective. Option 1 contractors must also remit use tax on any building materials on which sales or use tax has not already been paid or collected that has been incorporated into an ongoing project.\n\n017.04B Any contractor who changes from a tax-paid inventory (Option 2) to a tax-free inventory (Option 1 or Option 3) will receive a credit for the sales or use tax previously paid on its building materials in inventory at the time the contractor option change becomes effective. To receive the credit, the contractor must submit a signed statement to the Department that details the amount of credit to which it is entitled. The credit will be placed on the contractor's account and can be used as the building materials that were in inventory are annexed and payments become due to the Department. The contractor is not entitled to a refund of any sales or use tax previously paid on the building materials in inventory.\n\n017.05 Option 1-To be treated as a retailer with a tax exempt inventory.\n\n017.05A Option 1 contractors are retailers of building materials that become annexed.
