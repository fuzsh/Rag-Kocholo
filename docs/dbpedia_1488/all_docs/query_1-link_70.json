        "text": "With Season 26 of The Voice just a few months away, it's the perfect time to turn back the clock and experience a live performance of one of Reba McEntire's most underrated songs, \"The Heart Won't Lie.\"\n\nFor this particular rendition, the defending Voice champion enlisted the help of some of her dearest friends in the country music world, Rascal Flatts. The iconic band's lead singer Gary LeVox took the male vocal lead usually reserved for the original singer in the duet, Vince Gill. The result was pure magic, and in a blink-and-you-missed-it moment, you could even catch Gill himself nearly moved to tears.\n\nThe unreal performance took place at the 2011 ACM Girls Night Out event, and dare we say, McEntire hasn't aged a bit since then.\n\nWatch the nationally televised and unforgettable duet performance here.\n\nThe song's lyrics are classic country, and McEntire and LeVox easily navigate through the heart-wrenching subject matter (it is McEntire's original song, after all). As usual, McEntire's vocals soar.\n\nOur favorite part? A young Carrie Underwood nodding her head along to the song as she watches in awe from the first few rows. 28 years old at the time, Underwood had one of the best seats in the house.\n\nHere's what you should know about \"The Heart Won't Lie\"\n\nOriginally released in 1993 as the second single off McEntire's multi-platinum album It's Your Call, the track made waves in the country music world as a duet alongside Gill.\n\n\"The Heart Won't Lie\" was an unsurprising hit, ascending to the top spot on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart after 20 weeks climbing upward. The now-classic song is one of McEntire's 24 #1 country hits over her illustrious career.\n\nInterestingly enough, in comments made to About.com in 2008, the Voice Season 25 winner revealed that Gill wasn't her first choice of country legend to sing with her on the track's original recording."
