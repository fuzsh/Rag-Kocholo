        "text": "BURNING THE GROUND EXCLUSIVE 1982\n\n“I Want Candy” is a song written and originally recorded by the Strangeloves in 1965 that went to number 11 in the United States. It is a famous example of a song that uses the Bo Diddley beat.\n\nEnglish new wave group Bow Wow Wow released their version as the first and only single from their EP The Last of the Mohicans. For many in America, “I Want Candy” was their first introduction to young lead singer Annabella Lwin and the band. The song barely scraped the Top 50, but became an enduring new wave classic. The song gave its name to the band’s 1982 release, I Want Candy, which was mainly a compilation, but included a couple of new cuts produced by Kenny Laguna (Joan Jett & the Blackhearts).\n\nThe popularity of Bow Wow Wow’s recording, highly associated with 1980s pop music, is partly due to the memorable video that got heavy play in the early days of MTV.\n\nThe Bow Wow Wow recording appeared on two VH1 countdowns:\n\nNo. 86 on VH1’s “100 Greatest Songs of the ’80s”\n\nNo. 8 on VH1’s “100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the ’80s”\n\nThe 12″ single release contains the longer “Remix” version.\n\nSIDE A:\n\nI Want Candy (Remix) 3:33\n\nWritten-By – Berns*, Feldman*, Goldstein*, Gottehrer*\n\nSIDE B:\n\nCowboy 3:32\n\nWritten-By – Barbarossa*, Gorman*, Ashman*, Grillet*, Pietri*\n\nVINYL GRADE:\n\nVinyl: Near Mint\n\nSleeve: Near Mint\n\nU.S. CHART HISTORY:\n\nYear Single Chart Position 1982 I Want Candy U.S. Billboard Hot 100 #62 1982 I Want Candy U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks #22 1982 I Want Candy U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play #36\n\nRELEASE INFORMATION:\n\nLabel: RCA ‎– RCAT 238\n\nFormat: Vinyl, 12″, 45 RPM\n\nCountry: UK\n\nReleased: 1982\n\nGenre: Electronic\n\nStyle: New Wave\n\nCREDITS:\n\nProducer – Kenny Laguna\n\nNOTES:\n\nSide A is a Remix but not listed as such on sleeve or label\n\nFind the 12″ on DISCOGS\n\nEQUIPMENT USED:\n\nTurntable: Pro-Ject Debut Carbon (DC)\n\nCartridge: Ortofon 2M\n\nStylus: Ortofon OM Stylus 30\n\nPlatter: Pro-Ject Acryl-It platter\n\nStabilizer: Pro-Ject Record Puck\n\nPhono Pre-amp: Bellari VP130 Tube Phono Preamp\n\nTube: Tung-Sol 12AX7ECC803-S Gold Electron Tube\n\nSoundcard: ESI Juli@\n\nRecord Cleaning: VPI HW 16.5 Record Cleaning Machine\n\nArtwork Scans: Brother MFC-6490CW Professional Series Scanner\n\nSOFTWARE USED:\n\nRecording/Editing: Adobe Audition 3.0 (Recording)\n\nDown Sampling: iZotope RX Advanced 2\n\nArtwork Editor: Adobe Photoshop CS5\n\nClick Removal: Manual\n\nFLAC/MP3 Conversion: dBpoweramp\n\nM3U Playlist: Playlist Creator"
