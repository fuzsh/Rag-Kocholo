        "text": "The last two decades have seen the emergence of new methods for reporting the implicit attitudes of individuals. These methods are based on the idea that cognitive processes are automatically triggered by the mere mention of the attitude object (). Implicit attitude is generally measured by computerized protocols based on reaction times. This research used three studies to test the paper-and-pencil equivalent of a recent computerized measure of implicit attitude, the SC-IAT-P [Personalized Single Category Implicit Association Test, Bardin, Perrissol, Py, Launay & Escoubès ()].\n\nAmong the various tools for measuring implicit attitude (e.g. IAT Implicit Association Test, ; GNAT, Go/No-Go Association Task, ; EAST, Extrinsic Affective Simon Task, ; SC-IAT, Single Category Implicit Association Test, ; etc.), the IAT is the best documented (). Research using the IAT has been produced in fields as varied as racial prejudice, marketing, addictive behavior or politics (). Based on latency, the IAT is a categorization task of two opposite attitude objects or target concepts (e.g. insects vs. flowers) and two opposite evaluative attributes (e.g. negative vs. positive) performed on computer.\n\nThe participant uses two keys at the ends of the keyboard, one on the left and one on the right. These keys are identical for the whole protocol. The category labels are located on each side of the screen. The items (words or pictures) to categorize appear in the center of the screen. Participants have to press the right key or the left key as quickly as possible according to the instructions of the task to categorize the two attitude objects, evaluative attributes or a combination of these. The IAT involves five measurement stages: Simple categorization of target concepts (stage 1, e.g. Flowers vs. Insects), simple categorization of evaluative attributes (stage 2, e.g. Pleasant words vs. Unpleasant words), combined initial categorization (stage 3, e.g. Flowers + Pleasant words vs. Unpleasant words + Insects), simple categorization reversed (stage 4, the keys to categorize target concepts are reversed) and combined categorization inverted (stage 5, e.g. Insects + Pleasant words vs. Flowers + Unpleasant words). Thus, combined categorizations involve the association of target concepts and attributes on the same key.\n\nThe psychometric properties of the IAT have now been widely studied and the benefits of using this measure are well established. Implicit attitude as measured by the IAT is a good predictor of behavior. This link is particularly strong in the field of politics and for addiction phenomena (). For example, in the field of politics, Arcuri, Castelli, Galdi, Zogmaister and Amodori () showed that the IAT between two Italian leaders [Berlusconi vs. Rutelli (Study 1) and Galan vs. Carraro (Study 2)] was not only predictive of voting intentions of individuals but also of their actual vote a few days later (Study 1). Moreover, even for individuals exhibiting indecision at the time of measurement, the IAT predicted their vote a few days later (Studies 1 and 2). Similarly, in the field of addictions, many studies attest to the predictive scores of IAT on smoking behavior (e.g. ; ). Smokers show a more positive attitude toward smoking than non-smokers.\n\nNevertheless, despite its qualities, the tool has certain limitations. The first more specifically concerns addiction objects. Two other limitations concern its contamination by extrapersonal associations () and its relativity (). Finally, there are material constraints inherent in the use of such measures. Regarding addiction objects, it is necessary to distinguish processes related to the addictive nature of the product from those related to the evaluation of the object of addiction as an ordinary attitude object. Thus, the processes underlying addiction could be expressed more in terms of “wanting” than “liking” (incentive sensitization theory of addiction, ). As part of this framework, Ostafin, Palfai and Weschler () and Palfai and Ostafin () on alcohol, and De Houwer, Custers and De Clercq () on tobacco-smoking, tested an approach/avoid IAT. In this version, the evaluative attributes pleasant/unpleasant were replaced by approach/avoidance attributes (“will”, “close”, “come closer”, “to” vs. “escape”, “far”, “avoid” and “away”). IAT approach/avoid scores differentiated non-smokers from smokers but no better than with a “traditional” IAT (pleasant/unpleasant). For alcohol as an attitude object, Palfai and Ostafin () were able to demonstrate a link between IAT approach/avoid scores and whether or not subjects indulged in binge drinking (i.e. consuming large amounts per session), but not with consumption frequency. Thus, IAT approach/avoid could be used to measure the addictive aspect of a product like alcohol or tobacco. However, the pleasure of consumption would, in turn, be related more to the attitude as measured by more traditional implicit measures (IAT, SC-IAT, etc.).\n\nWith these traditional measures, scores obtained are often negative, independently of the subjects’ smoking or alcohol dependence (). These negative scores could therefore be interpreted as a manifestation of negative attitude toward these objects. They could also refer to the second limitation of IAT. Thus, according to Olson and Fazio (), the test not only measures personal attitude: the valence of the attitude is contaminated by the “general opinion” () to the attitudinal object. For example, the negative score for the tobacco object can be interpreted as reflecting a collectively shared negative evaluation of tobacco. It may also reflect a possible contamination of the personal attitude by this collective evaluation (extrapersonal associations). Olson and Fazio () succeeded in reducing such contamination by using a personalized IAT. With the personalized IAT, the “pleasant” vs. “unpleasant” or “negative” vs. “positive” labels of IAT are replaced by the labels “I like” vs. “I dislike”, which activates a more personal attitude in the participant. Using IAT-P, De Houwer et al. (, Study 2) seek to limit the contamination of the measure by extrapersonal associations. Smokers have positive scores whereas non-smokers have negative scores. This pattern of results led the authors to conclude firstly that smokers have a positive attitude while non-smokers have a negative attitude and, secondly, that IAT-P would measure the sensory aspects of consumption.\n\nThe third limitation concerns the relativity of measurement with IAT. According to Swanson et al. (), the choice of categories for an attitude object which does not have any natural opposite (e.g. tobacco) may have an impact on the scores. Thus, the opposition between the concepts of “smoking” and “stealing” will result in a more favorable assessment of tobacco that an opposition between “smoking” and “candy”. Similarly, when the test measures attitude toward flowers and opposes the target concepts “flowers” and “insects”, a better response time for the combination flowers + pleasant vs. insects + unpleasant does not necessarily express a negative attitude toward insects (). To overcome this limitation, Karpinski and Steinman () propose another variant of the IAT: the Single Category Implicit Association Test (SC-IAT), which measures a single target concept. The SC-IAT is a two-stage measure based on combined categorizations. In the first stage, participants have to categorize a target concept and evaluative positive attributes on one key and the negative evaluative attributes (e.g. pleasant + tobacco vs. unpleasant) on another key. In the second stage, the association is reversed, the participant has to associate the target concept and the negative evaluative attributes on one key and categorize evaluative positive attributes on the other key (e.g. pleasant vs. unpleasant + tobacco). SC-IAT can be used to measure a non-relative attitude, with simple instructions and a shorter administration time.\n\nHowever, the category labels of evaluative attributes can refer more closely to the general opinion than the personal attitude of individuals (“pleasant” vs. “unpleasant” labels). Thus, it is likely that this test is also contaminated by extrapersonal associations. Accordingly, it only overcomes the above-mentioned second limitation of the IAT. Bardin, Launay, Escoubès, Perrissol and Py () and Bardin et al. () have proposed and tested an SC-IAT-P on smoking that draws on both IAT-P and SC-IAT. The test measures the attitude toward a single object and limits extrapersonal contamination. It has the same properties as the SC-IAT while using label categories favoring a more personal measure of attitude (“I like” vs. “I dislike”). In their study, participants performed a computerized version of SC-IAT and SC-IAT-P. Both measures only differ by the labels of evaluative categories of attributes (i.e. “Pleasant” vs. “Unpleasant” and “I like” vs. “I dislike” respectively for the SC-IAT and the SC-IAT-P versions). The internal consistency for the SC-IAT-P was stronger than for the SC-IAT (.70 compared with .46). Moreover, unlike the SC-IAT, the SC-IAT-P differentiated smokers from non-smokers on their score. Finally, the results seemed to suggest a limitation of the contamination of the SC-IAT-P by extrapersonal associations, which probably explains the relatively low correlation between the two tests (.25). Thus, with the SC-IAT, smokers returned negative scores likely related to negative extrapersonal associations (i.e. smoking seriously harms health). However, with the SC-IAT-P, their score was not significantly different from 0 and could be interpreted as the manifestation of an ambivalent attitude to smoking.\n\nThe last limitation concerns the administration of Implicit Association Tests. The tests are traditionally computerized and require strict conditions and the recording of participants’ response times. Such a protocol involves a certain number of constraints: experimentation rooms and computers, substantial time required, protocol portability, recruitment of participants, etc. In order to simplify the use of the IAT, previous researchers have used a “paper-and-pencil” (p&p) version.\n\nThis p&p version of the IAT was used in the evaluation of racial prejudice (), gender stereotypes (), attitudes toward obesity (; ; ) and measuring the attitude to universities or colleges (Lane, Mitchell, & Banaji, 2005). Lemm, Lane, Sattler, Khan and Nosek (), meanwhile, undertook more specific work on the properties of the tool. They tested the type of stimuli (pictures vs. words), using different scores and calculation algorithms.\n\nAccording to Teachman and Brownell () and Sekaquaptewa, Vargas, and Von Hippel (), the p&p version of the IAT is based on the same logic as its computerized equivalent. It therefore probably has the same limitations as the computerized IAT. Saporito, Ryan and Teachman () in their study on the treatment of mental illness point to the relativity of IAT and state that, during the pre-test for their study, the p&p version did not prove effective. They therefore used a variant of BIAT (Brief IAT, ; ) with paper and pencil. Originally, the computerized BIAT simply required the participant to press a key on the keyboard for stimuli relative to a particular attitude (target concept) and pleasant evaluative attributes and press another key for all other items (i.e. another attitude object and the unpleasant evaluative attributes) without specifying to which categories they belong. Subsequently, a second attitude object is associated with pleasant words. The task is therefore identical to that required by the IAT except as regards the instructions, since the attitude objects are never explicitly associated with unpleasant evaluative attributes. Indeed, the IAT highlights the opposition between the concepts and evaluative attributes on each key, while the BIAT focuses on the pleasant words, with the attitude object being opposed to all other categories of items.\n\nAs long as the measurement remains relative (opposition of two target concepts), according to Saporito et al. (), “an explicitly labeled target comparison category is not needed” (p.13). They therefore created a version of the paper and pencil tool with a single target concept whereas originally, the computerized and validated version required the use of two concepts.\n\nThis version has two blocks of measurements, each about the association of the target concept with one of the evaluative attributes (respectable and shameful). Participants are shown all the items before performing the task and then have twenty seconds to complete it. The task consists in circling the words to be categorized according to the instructions, and crossing out the other words. In this respect, the BIAT seems closer to the GNAT (Go/No-Go Association Task, ) than the IAT.\n\nThis test appears to be promising. Nevertheless, it seems to generate a higher number of errors than the p&p IAT. In addition, the authors use the p&p BIAT version referring only to its computerized version and without providing any proof of its relevance in its p&p version. The authors also point out that “the use of the brief IAT employing a single target category is novel and its psychometric properties are not well established. As a result, it may be that the implicit-explicit discrepancy is due in part to the version of the IAT used” (p.17). Finally, while in this case it avoids the problem of the relativity of IAT measurements, it is also likely to be contaminated by extrapersonal associations. Finally, the SC-IAT-P could be an interesting tool for use in a p&p version, as it addresses both the major criticisms of the IAT. A p&p version could therefore provide a quick and easy tool for testing large groups of people simultaneously without the above-mentioned limitations of the p&p versions of the IAT, the IAT-P or BIAT.\n\nIn this context, it was necessary to ensure first that the tool possessed good discriminant and nomological validity and secondly that it could be used on a substantial number of persons simultaneously (e.g. amphitheater). Concerning its nomological validity, to our knowledge, Bardin et al. () and Bardin, Perrissol, Fos, Py, Dagot () are the only authors who have used the computerized SC-IAT-P on tobacco as an object. It therefore seemed appropriate in a first study to use the same object and the same experimental material to compare the results between the SC-IAT-P computer version and its p&p equivalent. This choice meant that it was not necessary to consider the quality of the tool in its computerized version, since it had already been validated. The goal was therefore to verify that the p&p SC-IAT-P measures the same construct as the computerized SC-IAT-P and thus correlates with the latter for the tobacco object. This study was also designed to reveal implicit attitude differences regarding smoking behavior. Such a project can only be undertaken with small numbers of participants simultaneously, given the practical constraints inherent in the computerized SC-IAT-P.\n\nRegarding the ability of the tool to overcome the experimental constraints of its computerized equivalent, it was appropriate to attempt to reproduce in a second study the same pattern of results in terms of discriminant validity in experimental design when asking large numbers of people to take the test simultaneously (i.e. amphitheater). However, smoking behavior is related not only to the attitude of individuals, but also, for smokers, to its addictive nature. A third study was therefore necessary to verify the discriminant validity of the tool on an attitude object unrelated to any addiction, as the addictive nature of the object influences the link between attitude and behavior and for which the implicit and explicit attitudes correlate strongly. In this sense, political attitude could be a relevant object. The third study therefore aimed to differentiate individuals on their implicit attitude score according to their political orientation and voting intention in the context of the 2012 French presidential election.\n\nGeneral discussion\n\nWe made the assumption that adapting the p&p SC-IAT-P would overcome the constraints of the computerized version while preserving its strengths. The protocol is fast and for most participants seems to have a playful side. In the first study, the correlation between the p&p version and the computerized SC-IAT-P confer a certain nomological validity to the measures. In addition, the difference between the results for smokers and non-smokers attests to its discriminant validity. The results of Study 2 confirm its discriminant validity since it is not only able to distinguish smokers from non-smokers but also smokers who have previously attempted to quit smoking from those who have not. The results obtained with the p&p SC-IAT-P in Study 3 in the area of politics also confirm the discriminant validity of the tool. Using this theme overcame the problem of addiction posed by an attitude object such as tobacco. Implicit attitude produces results consistent with the explicit measures of attitude and voting intentions. In addition, the same difference between the results for undecided and decided voters was obtained as that usually found in the literature. These first results support the tool’s validity. However, it should be noted that the three studies have limitations. The first relates to the reduced sample in each of these studies, even if the use of the bootstrap method partially overcomes this limitation. Moreover, as for the p&p IAT, the test design makes it impossible to study its internal consistency. Indeed, when Bardin et al. () studied the reliability of the computerized version of the SC-IAT-P, they followed the recommendations of Karpinski and Steinman () to calculate an adjusted value of r (the Spearman-Brown correction) which, from a conceptual point of view, is the equivalent of Cronbach’s alpha for studying explicit measurement reliability (). This calculation is possible because the number of responses is fixed in the computerized version. In the p&p SC-IAT-P, as in the p&p IAT, the number of responses given by the participant does not reflect a predefined number of items but, among other factors, the ability of the participant to answer quickly. The p&p SC-IAT-P is also designed so that it is not possible to finish it. Thus, Lemm et al. () point out that “Paper IATs also do not allow for trial by trial timing, thus it is not possible to compute split-half or alpha reliability.” (p.22).\n\nFinally, the main limitation concerning the validation of the tool is the impossibility of verifying its test-retest reliability. This should be verified both in the computerized and the p&p versions since, to our knowledge, no study has tested the reliability of the SC-IAT and the SC-IAT-P. The strong correlation between IAT and SC-IAT (r = .78) obtained by Karpinski and Steinman () and the quite similar consistency of the two measures suggest that IAT and SC-IAT could have very similar reliability. Lane et al. () listed the studies in which IAT had undergone testing-retesting and reported that reliability was satisfactory, although the correlations ranged from .25 to .69. Similarly, the test-retest correlation for the p&p IAT verified by Lemm et al. () was .62. Apart from the reliability of SC-IAT and SC-IAT-P in their computerized or p&p versions, questions arise concerning the reliability of all IAT measuring tools and their derivative versions and particularly the origin of the variations found in the literature.\n\nSince the creation of the IAT, interest in implicit attitude measures has grown considerably. Thus, nearly 500 scientific papers containing the words “Implicit Association Test”’ or “IAT” are listed in the databases of psychology articles (PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES). Tests with paper-and-pencil versions, meanwhile, have remained less frequent. According to Mori, Uchida, and Imata (), the relatively low interest could be related to the loss of precision in the paper version inherent in the lower variability of the scores than in the computerized version.\n\nImplicit measures of attitudes are now beginning to be used in classic studies of attitude (e.g., ; ). However, this remains a minority option compared to self-reported measures. Although the protocols have been simplified and expanded since 1998, allowing researchers to choose between different versions, personalized or otherwise, the computerized versions are limited in the ways they can be applied. Therefore, even if the paper versions of these tests are less accurate and need to be improved, they nevertheless open up new perspectives for reducing the effects of social desirability on research into attitude change, or studies concerning the link between attitude and behavior, since they are cheap to run, require very little equipment () and are easy to use. Indeed, since the studies presented in this paper, we have implemented this protocol several times under identical conditions (participants questioned in an amphitheater). The instructions were given by the experimenter orally, without a slideshow. This change does not seem to have caused any more problems in understanding, while producing the same pattern of results ().\n\nFinally, the results obtained in the field of politics concerning indecision suggest avenues for application in other areas such as intentions to quit smoking. Indeed, like Friese et al. () or Arcuri et al. (), our results support the postulate of an implicit attitude that precedes future behavioral intention, even though the individual may not be aware of this intention (Gawronski et al., 2015). Galdi, Gawronski, Arcuri, and Friese () were able to demonstrate that the explicit attitude toward the entry of Turkey into the European Union was only predictive of selective exposure to information on the subject for people who already held a firm opinion. Undecided people, meanwhile, tended to selectively expose consult related information according to their implicit attitude as measured by a SC-IAT. Bardin et al. () showed that the more smokers had a negative implicit attitude (measured by a SC-IAT-P) toward smoking, the more they reported a desire to expose consult related prevention information. Thus, according to Gawronski et al. (2015), implicit measures of undecided correspond to an “embryonic preference” (p.14) not yet acknowledged explicitly, but that would develop due to biased processing of the information in view of this preference.\n\nIt would therefore be interesting to replicate these findings by differentiating three groups of smokers: the “happy smokers” () who are determined not to quit, the undecided wondering about possibly quitting without showing concrete or conscious intention, and those who have decided to stop. The “happy smokers” are individuals in the first stage (precontemplation) of the Transtheoretical Model of Prochaska and DiClemente (). Undecided smokers are more difficult to categorize in one of the stages of this model. Indeed, although the model is widely used in the field of tobacco smoking, one of the main criticisms regarding its implementation concerns the lack of any notion of indecision (). Among the questions asked, smokers must state whether they are considering quitting within 6 months and whether they are planning to quit within 30 days. Thus, a smoker who plans to quit in five months will be at a different stage to one who is thinking of quitting in 7 months (precontemplation vs. contemplation). Similarly, a smoker who is considering quitting after 31 days will be in the contemplation stage while one who plans to do so within 30 days will be in the preparation stage. According to Herzog () and West (), these thresholds are arbitrary. To overcome this limitation, Herzog () tested a modification of these items by adding a response category “do not know/undecided”. The results reveal that 30% and 33.1% of smokers answer that they do not know whether they will quit respectively within 30 days and 6 months. It might be interesting to use this version of the questionnaire to identify decided from undecided people within each stage. Undecided smokers who report a negative implicit attitude toward smoking might expose to smoking prevention information in order to strengthen their “embryonic attitude” more than decided smokers. However, as in the study by Galdi et al. (), the explicit attitude score would not predict this exposure. It is possible that implicit attitude could cause a selective search for information that would act as a future mediator for quitting. Specifically, the selective search for information would cause such subjects to develop an explicit negative attitude to smoking that would lead them to attempt to quit later on. Finally, the implicit attitude measured by a paper-and-pencil or computerized SC-IAT-P could help predict the likelihood that a smoker makes the decision to quit smoking while not even aware of it."
