        "text": "Zach Bryan is calling out anonymous internet trolls — and the social media sites that give them a platform.\n\nOver the weekend, he set his sighs on Prime Time Country Music, a country music news platform that appears to operate primarily on social media. Each week, the platform runs a segment called \"PTCM Shots Fired,\" where they ask their followers to share their country music hot takes.\n\nThe opinions range from funny to serious and often involve making jokes at country stars' expense — as was the case when one social media user anonymously wrote in:\n\n\"Zach Bryan is what happens when you don't discipline your kids.\"\n\nThe site reposted that answer, along with a photo of Bryan's September 2023 arrest, and Bryan didn't take kindly to the sentiment. He shared the post on his Instagram Stories, along with a few choice words for the account who posted it.\n\n\"Why are you calling yourself a country music social site and saying s--t like this on it. As Nashville as it gets,\" Bryan wrote.\n\n\"I pray you pieces of trash that don't even have your name attached to these accounts know how much worse the world is with you in them,\" he went on to say.\n\n\"Don't ever insult my parents, don't ever insult anyone's parents.\"\n\nThe singer concluded his post by hoping he can get the account taken down — or at least talk to his administrators directly.\n\n\"If anyone knows who runs this account please tell me, I'm so tried of this s--t,\" he said.\n\nIt's not the first time Bryan has been the butt end of a joke during Prime Time Country Music's \"Shots Fired\" segment. Last week, another user had a hot take: The baby who went viral for meeting Bryan at his concert was lucky to be wearing headphones, presumably so he didn't have to listen to the music.\n\nBut he's certainly not the only country singer who's getting made fun of during these segments. Another recent \"shots fired\" submission suggests that Old Dominion's Matt Ramsey looks like Adam Sandler, and another says that Billy Strings' concerts smell \"like weed and patchouli.\"\n\nIn the same batch, other users simply submitted their opinions on new country music albums or trends. Ella Langley's recently-released Hungover album received quite a bit of support, and someone else opined that John Moreland is an underrated country artist.\n\nSince responding to the insults against his parents, Bryan has deactivated his Instagram account. He frequently takes social media breaks, so it's unclear if his absence is directly related to the post."
