        "text": "Feed the Animals Studio album by Girl Talk Released June 19, 2008 Genre Mashup, electronic, dance Length 53:53 Label Illegal Art Format CD, LP, digital download Producer Girl Talk Girl Talk chronology\n\n(2006) (2008) (2010)\n\nFeed the Animals is the fourth album by American mashup musician Girl Talk. Illegal Art released the album in digital download format on June 19, 2008 through their website, using a \"pay what you want\" pricing system.[1] The album utilizes 322 different samples, with some minor original instrumentation from Girl Talk himself.[2] It received generally positive reviews from critics, scoring 76/100 on review aggregate website Metacritic.[3]\n\nBackground[]\n\nFollowing in the style of Night Ripper, all of the album's tracks segue into each other; describing this, Girl Talk explained: \"The sound naturally evolved, and eventually, I had enough material to put out full-length album in this style.\"[4] The album was created as one long piece of music and then subsequently broken into individual songs.[5]\n\nRelease[]\n\nFeed the Animals was released digitally by Illegal Art through their website on June 19, 2008.[1] The label implemented \"pay what you want\" pricing system for those purchasing Feed the Animals, which has since been implemented on other Girl Talk albums.[1] Users choosing to pay $0.00 receive the album in individual song files, but must choose from the following options explaining their choice of price beforehand: \"I may donate later\"; \"I can't afford to pay\"; \"I don't really like Girl Talk\"; \"I don't believe in paying for music\"; \"I have already purchased this album\"; \"I don't value music made from sampling\"; \"I am part of the press, radio, or music industry\", or \"other reasons\".[6] Those paying $5 can access FLAC files and a one-file seamless MP3 version of the album; for $10, users can obtain a CD copy.[1]\n\nGirl Talk has stated that the system was implemented to \"make it easier for people to get their hands on the music, which is my number one priority.\"[4] A CD issue was planned for release on September 23, 2008, but manufacturing issues involving their production forced the date to be pushed back to November 11, 2008.[7] Wham City Records was to handle the album's vinyl issue, but a release never sufficed.[6]\n\nIllegal Art reissued the album on vinyl on September 30, 2020.[8]\n\nLeak[]\n\nOn March 19, 2008, a purported leak of Feed the Animals was released to the Internet and spread quickly on torrent networks.[9] The next day, Gillis posted a message on his MySpace account to assure that the version was a fake.[9] The original artist, Speaky, soon apologized, explaining that the leaked album was in fact his album Mashcore Volume 2 and that he had posted the album under its correct name but it was subsequently retagged.[9]\n\nTitle and cover[]\n\nVisual artist Andrew Strasser, who has worked closely with Girl Talk throughout his career, designed the album's cover, which features the initials \"GT\" burning on the front lawn of a suburban house. Strasser also coined the title Feed the Animals, as Girl Talk later explained: \"We noticed that anytime the [tour] inflatables were placed relatively close to the crowd someone would get their hands on it and completely tear it apart or crowd surf it back. Andrew started referring to setting up the visuals as 'feeding the animals.' It went a little bit further and we started referring to the shows from both our standpoint and the fans as feeding the animals. The shows are everyone's time to just get wild and enjoy themselves for that day.\"[10]\n\nCritical reception[]\n\nFeed the Animals received generally positive reviews from critics.[3] Robert Christgau, writing for MSN Music, graded the album \"A\" and wrote: \"...Gregg Gillis has plenty to say about music. What he has to say about life... remains more limited. Nevertheless, sequences here give me hope. In my favorite, Ice Cube's 'AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted' turns into Hot Chocolate's 'Every 1's a Winner'.\"[11] Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V. Club attributed the album's appeal to \"Gillis' sense of sonic proportion\", which \"gives the whole mix a curvaceousness that make even the most unnatural tandems seem perfectly logical.\"[12] Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork rated Feed the Animals 8.0/10 and wrote that \"[It] helps to solidify Gillis' role as the supreme 80s-baby pop synthesizer. And while others have attempted to claw up to his lofty position, no one has managed to match his unique mix of diversity, pace, and open-mindedness\".[13]\n\nIn his Rolling Stone review of the album, Christian Hoard praised the album and noted: \"Rarely is postmodern art such bloody good fun.\"[14] Tim O'Neil of PopMatters was also enthusiastic: \"Feed the Animals is a wonderful achievement, but don't take my pseudo-intellectual pontification as proof of anything, go listen to it yourself. Albums like these are actively changing the way people think about and listen to pop music, and in doing so Girl Talk is contributing to a very long lineage of conceptual innovators stretching back all the way to Thomas Edison, a stream of engineers and musicians dedicated to liberating music from the tyranny of direct representation of physical sounds.\"[15]\n\nAccolades[]\n\nYear-end lists[]\n\nSource List Position Ref.
