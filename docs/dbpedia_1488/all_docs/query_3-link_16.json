        "text": "As a teen in the early 80’s when Bow Wow Wow’s cover of the song I Want Candy, came out I thought the song was about candy of the confectionary kind. Not cocaine or sex or your drug of choice. Annabella Lwin, Lead vocalist of Malcolm McLaren’s group, Bow Wow Wow, was in fact a sixteen year old herself. Sometimes I think it would be good to go back to those innocent teenage years, when naivety made the world dream like, anything was possible and if you wanted to find out stuff, you looked it up in a library or in an encyclopaedia and that didn’t guarantee that you would have an answer. The original song by The Strangeloves released in 1965 is apparently about sex because anything carnal couldn’t be mentioned in the sixties.\n\nAs an ode to the 80’s go to your local suburban milk bar (if it indeed still exists), grab a bag of mixed lollies or candy of choice and check it out!\n\nThe Strangeloves– I Want Candy Lyrics\n\nI know a guy who’s tough but sweet\n\nHe’s so fine, he can’t be beat\n\nHe’s got everything that I desire\n\nSets the summer sun on fire\n\nI want candy, I want candy\n\nGo to see him when the sun goes down\n\nAin’t no finer boy in town\n\nYou’re my guy, just what the doctor ordered\n\nSo sweet, you make my mouth water\n\nI want candy, I want candy\n\nCandy on the beach, there’s nothing better\n\nBut I like candy when it’s wrapped in a sweater\n\nSome day soon I’ll make you mine,\n\nThen I’ll have candy all the time"
