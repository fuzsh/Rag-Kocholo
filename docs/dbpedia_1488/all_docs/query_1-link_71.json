        "text": "Trying to convince many regular rock fans to explore heavy metal can be a challenge; trying to convert them to extreme metal acceptance requires more fortitude. It’s uneasy listening for those who love it.\n\nBritain’s metal vets Cradle of Filth occupy their own special niche in the extreme metal world, and not just for Dani Filth’s signature shrieks and demonic growls. Their malevolent milieu combines symphonic goth, black metal belligerence, classic metal, and dare we say it, some prog, which gives them one of the most distinct metal sounds out there. That and having a female keyboardist and siren singer who adds to the dark drama; the latest being Zoe Marie Federoff.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nCradle of Filth and its perennial leader Dani Filth often thrive on lurid, lascivious, surreal, and sinister imagery. Their music and lyrics draw inspiration from varied sources like classic Gothic and romantic literature, Hammer horror films, and infamous historical figures. The following five Cradle of Filth tracks prove this long-running group not only stands out in their own arena, they have a lot more musicality and poetic lyrics than outsiders might assume. So dive in with delicious, malicious intent and be glad for the madness.\n\n“Nymphetamine Fix” from Nymphetamine (2005)\n\nThis slower track is certainly one of the more “commercial” entries in the Cradle catalog, and it contrasts Dani’s controlled growls with guest singer Liv Kristine’s angelic voice. “Nymphetamine Fix” is also more Goth than extreme, and for listeners who like classic melodic metal it’s a good place to start. The video has the most YouTube views of any Cradle clip—over 80 million.\n\nSix feet deep is the incision\n\nIn my heart, that barless prison\n\nDiscolours all with tunnel vision\n\nSunsetter…\n\nNymphetamine\n\nSick and weak from my condiion\n\nThis lust, this vampyric addiction\n\nTo Her alone in full submission\n\nNone better…\n\nNymphetamine\n\n“The Death of Love” from Godspeed on the Devil’s Thunder (2008)\n\nEven with Dani’s shrieks on this one, the deeply gothic vibe, Carolyn Gretton’s alluring vocals, and the majestic guitar harmonies should make it a compelling listen for newbies. “The Death of Love” runs over seven minutes long but holds your attention. An added bonus in the intro and outro: narration from Doug Bradley, the actor who played Hellraiser’s lead cenobite leader Pinhead. He has appeared on six different Cradle albums. The single/video version of this song is two minutes shorter than the original.\n\n“Forgive Me Father (I Have Sinned)” from Darkly, Darkly Venus Aversa (2010)\n\nThere had been talk of this track being more mainstream because of Dani’s simmering growls and tempered shrieks, but it’s got plenty of thunderous passages and a high-velocity solo from guitarist Paul Allender. It’s definitely one of those headbangers that makes you want to let loose—it runs on devilish musical adrenaline and it’s a blast.\n\n“Pallid Reflection” from The Manticore and Other Horrors (2012)\n\nThis multi-tempo composition focuses on the time-honored horror theme of vampirism, with a lot of memorable melodic guitar and fun wordplay. There’s a bit of neck-snapping freneticism in the middle, but the orchestral keyboards and background choral singing, as found on many other Cradle tracks, imbues it with a larger-than-life feeling.\n\nDream-dappled streams of sunshine / Dread fog shall dissipate / As red skies descend on graveyard floors / Where the dead exhilarate.\n\nMy heart is gone / Taken by a nightmare bourgeois creature / Now you belong / To your sick womanagerie.\n\n“Discourse Between a Man and His Soul” from Existence is Futile (2021)\n\nAnother longer track of more than five minutes, “Discourse” is dripping with Victorian Gothic atmosphere and musical elegance. One might imagine this elegiac song being translated into an orchestral setting and played during that time period. It’s a highlight of the last Cradle album that shows that, 13 albums into their career, they can still surprise us.\n\nNightmares, slink in their dark lairs\n\nThinking of plots where\n\nEverything rings with the sting of depravity\n\nAs thou have seen I have not always danced on the edge of the world\n\nI have oft lost my mind\n\nIn labyrinths, blind\n\nAnd broken my bread with the flies\n\nI just don’t want to die\n\nWithout thee by my side\n\nSated and beautiful\n\nI will struggle with keys at the gate\n\nNever a saint, far from decency’s grace\n\nTrue to my heart\n\nBearing off-the-chart latitudes\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nPhoto by Michael Mullenix/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock"
