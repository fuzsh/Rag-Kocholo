        "text": "‘Candy’ was released as a single in May 2009 before it was released on his second album, ‘Sunny Side Up’. I don’t know many songs by Paolo in all honesty, I know the obvious which is ‘Last Request’ which is a great track, so I don’t want to be reluctant to explore him anymore.\n\nThis track opens with an acoustic guitar, which is then followed by the Scottish vocals. If you have read my reviews on Gerry Cinnamon and Dylan John Thomas, then you’ll know that I love the Scottish accent in songs. The first verse explores the writer being in a bad place and needing somebody to make things better. I applaud the line, “I was perched outside in the pouring rain, trying to make myself a sail”, because of how clever it is and the imagery it creates, where he is trying to pick himself back up.\n\nAs we reach verse two, the drums commence as this song starts to add different flavours. Moving into the chorus, there is a female voice added for backing vocals which compliments Paolos. Lyrically, it suggests that the writer would do anything for this girl he just wants some “candy” in return, which I believe to be some loving.\n\nIn the fourth verse, I admire the line, “Well, I’m some stain there on your bedsheet” because it could have different meanings. An obvious one would be the sexual connotations, but it could also mean that he is always a reminder to her, and he always leaves his mark.\n\nMy favourite line from this song is, “I’m a heartless man at worst babe, and a helpless one at best”."
