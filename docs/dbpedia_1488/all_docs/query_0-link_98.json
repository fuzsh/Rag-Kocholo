        "text": "This took place during the spring of 2020, during the time when the [global health crisis] had just fully hit the USA and the lockdown had officially begun.\n\nI worked at a small shoe store at a strip mall. We sold shoes that were really meant for construction workers, contractors, and factory workers. It was small enough that it could be managed by a single person. One of the nice things about working here when the crisis hit was that corporate took the situation VERY seriously. When the lockdown began, we became a curbside-only store and would only accept purchases either over the phone or online. We would keep the store completely locked twenty-four-seven, only ever unlocking it to hand customers their orders since we now didn’t allow them in the store period.\n\nCorporate also sent us so many giant posters about the crisis, as well as the lockdown mandates and our new rules about how our store would operate. It got to the point where the door in and out was the only thing without a poster on it. You would think it would be obvious to everyone how our store would operate during this time, right?\n\nWrong! Very, very few customers ever actually noticed the informational posters in our store. They just didn’t notice them or didn’t care and would still try to force open our very much locked front door. So many times, I would have to yell through the glass that our store was locked and all purchases had to be made over the phone or on our website. Many of those customers would scream at us or threaten to call corporate, but then, we actually had the ability to refuse service and not bend the rules for the sake of customer service. Again, I loved our corporate for taking the crisis so seriously.\n\nSadly, it all came to a head when I was working solo one day. Things weren’t going too badly, but then, one customer walked up to the door and, like all the others, tried to force it open. I stepped out from the counter and walked over to the door to yell through the glass what the situation was. This is what was spoken word for word since his response shook me to my core.\n\nMe: “Sorry, sir. We don’t allow walk-ins anymore due to the [global health crisis]. Only phone or online orders.”\n\nCustomer: “…what [global health crisis]?”\n\nI kid you not. That deeply troubled me. Like, how did this guy not notice literally everything going on right then? I had to take a moment to regain my senses before I explained our rules to him. The guy said nothing and just walked away."
