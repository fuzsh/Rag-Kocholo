        "text": "Melanie Adele Martinez is an American VMA-nominated singer-songwriter, screenwriter, poet, director, actress, dancer, producer, and photographer of Dominican and Puerto Rican descent. She first auditioned for the American television vocal talent show The Voice and became a member of Team Adam, where her popularity rapidly grew among fans. Within the fifth week, she was eliminated, which subsequently prompted her to work on original material. She is also known for writing songs that discuss social issues.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nMelanie was born in the Astoria neighborhood of Queens, New York, and raised in Baldwin, Long Island, New York. She stated that she \"loved singing since she was really little\" and that she taught herself how to play guitar at age 14 by looking up chord diagrams of songs that she liked and learning chord diagrams so that she could write original songs as well. She credits her love of poetry for leading her into songwriting.\n\nShe began uploading covers of songs such as \"Follow Me\" by Uncle Kracker, \"How to Save a Life\" by The Fray, and \"Not a Second to Waste\" by A Rocket to the Moon onto her YouTube channel in 2009, along with original songs such as \"Go on Away\" and \"Smoke\". The videos were mainly filmed by Melanie on her webcam.\n\nCareer[]\n\n2012: Career beginnings and The Voice[]\n\nMelanie Martinez appeared on season 3 of The Voice. She sang \"Toxic\" by Britney Spears for her Blind Audition and turned three chairs: Adam Levine, Ceelo Green, and Blake Shelton. Melanie chose Adam Levine as her coach and then moved on to the battle rounds. She competed against Caitlin Michele with the song \"Lights\" by Ellie Goulding. Adam chose Melanie, who moved on to the knockout rounds.\n\nDuring the knockout rounds, Melanie was paired with Sam James, and they chose to sing \"Bulletproof\" by La Roux. Again, Adam chose her, who moved on to the live rounds. She chose to sing \"Hit the Road Jack\" by Ray Charles for the first week of the live rounds. The public vote did not save her, but Adam picked her to keep on his team. She went on to the second week of the live rounds, where she sang \"Cough Syrup\" by Young The Giant. This time, the public vote did save her, so she moved on to week three with \"Seven Nation Army\" by The White Stripes. \"Seven Nation Army\" was in the top ten on iTunes, so Martinez got her iTunes votes multiplied by ten. Martinez got to move on to the fourth week of the live rounds, where her song was \"Too Close\" by Alex Clare. Again, the song moved into the top ten on iTunes, so they had her iTunes votes multiplied by ten. Melanie then moved into week 5, which is the top 6.\n\nStarting in week 5, singers of The Voice have to sing two songs, one picked by them and another picked by their coach. For those songs, Melanie picked \"Crazy\" by Gnarls Barkley, and Adam picked \"The Show\" by Lenka for her. Neither of her songs appeared in the top ten on iTunes, resulting in Melanie being eliminated.\n\n2014-15: Dollhouse and American Horror Story[]\n\nAfter being eliminated from the Top 6 on The Voice, Melanie began working independently on original material. Melanie released her single, \"Dollhouse\", on February 9, 2014, along with a music video. Two months later, on April 7, 2014, Melanie announced that she signed on Atlantic Records and that she would release an album and then go on tour. Later, she released her debut extended play (EP) Dollhouse on May 19, 2014, which included the singles Dollhouse and \"Carousel\", which later received a music video in October of that year. \"Dead To Me\" and \"Bittersweet Tragedy\" were also featured on the EP. The EP is mostly about a relationship that doesn't work out, excluding Dollhouse.\n\nWhen the trailer for American Horror Story: Freak Show was released, Melanie's song, \"Carousel\", was featured in it, which helped the song rise in popularity. Melanie released the \"Carousel\" music video on October 15, 2014.\n\n2015-2016: Cry Baby[]\n\nMelanie released her debut album, Cry Baby, on August 14, 2015. It was made available to pre-order on July 24.\n\nThe lead single, \"Pity Party\", was released on June 1, 2015. The second single, \"Soap\", was released on July 10, 2015. The third single, \"Sippy Cup\", was released on July 31, 2015. Cry Baby was released on August 14, 2015, to critical acclaim.[1][2] The album debuted at number 6 on the Billboard 200. She released a special Christmas single, titled \"Gingerbread Man\" on December 23, 2015. Melanie said she planned on making music videos for every song on the standard edition of the album, all of which ended up being released by September 2017.\n\n2016-2019: K-12 album and film[]\n\nMelanie released her sophomore album, K-12, accompanied by a full-length film of the same name, on September 6, 2019. It had previously been made available for pre-order on July 23.\n\nMelanie started recording the album in 2015 and finished in 2017, with producer Michael Keenan confirming that it was completed in January 2018. On April 13 and May 17, 2016, Melanie posted two different photos on Instagram, with lyrics in both captions. These songs, which were later revealed to be \"High School Sweethearts\" and \"Lunchbox Friends\" respectively, were confirmed to be on the album by Melanie herself, although she had stated then that the songs would not be released for a while.\n\nIn an interview in March 2017, Melanie confirmed that she would be working on a film to tell the story of her sophomore album. The film was described as a surrealist dark comedy musical.[3] Melanie worked on the hair, costumes, direction, and editing for the film. The movie was filmed in Europe, beginning in October and ending in December 2018.\n\nOn May 15, 2019, a teaser trailer was released, revealing the album and film's titles to be K-12. Within the next two weeks, she released two more teasers. Alongside the third teaser, she announced that both the album and film would be released on September 6, 2019.[4]\n\nOn June 17, 2019, a preview featuring clips of the movie and a snippet of a new song, later revealed to be \"Nurse's Office\", was premiered at the MTV Movie Awards. She began promoting the album with assignments starting on June 24, 2019. The film's official trailer was released along with the album track-list and pre-order on July 23, 2019. It was also announced that the film would be shown in theaters on September 5, a day prior to the film's official release. Melanie attended the film's premiere in Los Angeles, California, on September 3, 2019.\n\n2020-2022: After School EP, and Billboard nomination[]\n\nIn an interview with V Magazine, Melanie stated that she would release songs that were in-line with K-12, but were \"more personal and more vulnerable\".\n\nWhen the K-12 Tour began, fans began to speculate that Melanie would be releasing a new EP, possibly called After School, because the image displayed on the video screen during \"Fire Drill\" would show a pink composition notebook with the words \"After School\" written on the front.[5]\n\nDuring the concert at O2 City Hall in Newcastle, Melanie announced that Fire Drill would be officially released at some point in 2020. It was later confirmed through Melanie's Instagram story that the song would be a track on her new extended play (EP), After School EP. On February 10, 2020, Melanie released a single from her After School EP titled \"Copy Cat\", featuring American rapper Tierra Whack. On June 26, 2020, Melanie released the second single from the After School EP, titled \"Fire Drill\", four months after its original release date. In October 2020, Melanie was nominated for Top Soundtrack for The Billboard Music Awards for her album and film K-12. This was her first big nomination in the music industry.\n\n2023-present: PORTALS and VMA nomination[]\n\nMelanie released her third studio album, PORTALS on March 31, 2023. The album's release was accompanied by a series of events and promotions, including snippets, egg hatching promotions and live performances of unreleased tracks. The lead single, \"DEATH\", released on March 17, 2023, followed by the second single, \"VOID,\" on March 29, 2023, and the promotional single, \"EVIL\" on November 21, 2023. Melanie promptly released the album's deluxe edition, which featured the much-anticipated track \"MILK OF THE SIREN\". Melanie soon embarked on the PORTALS Tour on May 30, 2023.\n\nOn August 8, 2023, the music video for \"VOID\" was announced as a nominee for the Video Music Awards in the category for Best Visual Effects. It is her first major nomination and it lost to Taylor Swift's \"Anti-Hero\".\n\nIn March 2024, Melanie revealed that she has been in Hawaii writing new music.[6] She later said that she was starting the writing process for her next album, which she says that she will release \"years from now\". She plans to spend the rest of 2024 on The Trilogy Tour.[7]\n\nFanbase names[]\n\nLittle Bows\n\nDuring Melanie's time on Season 3 of The Voice in 2012, she stated that her fans were called \"Little Bows\". She kept that name until she had been on the Dollhouse Tour for around 2 weeks, then switched to \"Cry Baby\" shortly after.\n\nCrybabies/Cry Babies\n\nAround June 2014, Melanie's fans started calling themselves \"Cry Babies\". Melanie has stated that she sees her fans as her friends instead of a fanbase who have a name, but she has accepted the name.[8]\n\nCherubs\n\nFans assumed that Melanie wanted to change the fanbase name to \"Cherubs\" during the K-12 era at some point, since she addressed them like that a few times, although she still mainly called her fans Crybabies.\n\nAngel bbies\n\nDuring the pre-PORTALS era, she addressed her fanbase as \"Angel bbies\", (which can be read as \"Angel Babies\"), on her Instagram occasionally.\n\nEarthlings\n\nAround the release of PORTALS, Melanie addressed her fanbase as \"Earthlings\" on Instagram posts[9]. Also, during the PORTALS Tour, she greeted her fans by calling them Earthlings. It's likely that this is the current fanbase name. As a result, many fans of Melanie have began calling themselves \"Earthlings\" instead of \"Cry Babies\" as of 2024.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nMelanie's earliest memory was her third birthday, when her parents hired a \"sketchy\" Barney for their birthday party. Due to how \"sketchy\" it was, she stated it was her \"worst birthday party ever\". She's been afraid of the dark ever since she was a child. Her hair is naturally brown, and she began experimenting with different colors when she was sixteen, after watching One Hundred and One Dalmatians and going off on her own to dye her hair like Cruella de Vil (despite not being allowed to).[10] Melanie only changes the color of the left side of her hair, always leaving the right side a solid black. Melanie's hair soon started to die, so she had to use wigs for a bit.\n\nMelanie is known for being very shy. She is known to smoke marijuana to calm her nerves and reduce her anxiety before shows, although she has recently stopped smoking. She has also stated that she drinks occasionally.[11] She recently said that she found other alternatives to calm her anxiety.\n\nOn July 21, 2018, Melanie came out as bisexual through her Instagram story.[12] On January 20, 2021, Melanie confirmed that she uses the pronouns she/they.[12]\n\nRelationships[]\n\nKenyon Parks\n\nMelanie's earliest known boyfriend was Kenyon Parks, whom she encountered during her photography studies in 2011. They ended their relationship sometime between 2011 and 2012.\n\nVinnie DiCarlo\n\nIn 2012, Melanie started dating Vinnie DiCarlo. However, near late 2012, they broke up.\n\nJared Dylan\n\nSubsequently. Melanie began dating Jared Dylan. During their time together, Jared wrote \"Wicked Words\" for Melanie to sing. Their relationship lasted until mid-2013. It is confirmed that \"Alphabet Boy\" was inspired by their relationship.\n\nEdwin Zabala\n\nIn late 2013, Melanie entered into a romantic relationship with Edwin Zabala, who also played the role of Cry Baby's older brother in the \"Dollhouse\" music video. Unfortunately, their relationship ended on negative terms, and Edwin has been reported for leaking sexually explicit photos of Melanie to fans on the now-defunct video-chatting platform Omegle in 2014 after they split up.\n\nMiles Nasta\n\nFurthermore, in 2014, Melanie entered a romantic relationship with her drummer, Miles Nasta. Miles actively contributed to the creation of the song \"Half Hearted\" alongside Melanie. They remain close friends to this day.\n\nMichael Keenan\n\nIn 2015, Melanie started dating Michael Keenan, her producer. They eventually broke up around 2017, but they remained close friends and continued to work together for her sophomore album, K-12.\n\nOliver Tree\n\nAfter a long time, in 2019, Melanie revealed that she was dating Oliver Tree. They shared photos together, including a picture of them kissing, indicating their relationship. Melanie also dedicated the song \"High School Sweethearts\" to him on the K-12 Tour. However, in June 2020, rumors spread that they had broken up as they deleted photos and comments, and Melanie unfollowed Oliver on every social media account he had. On May 12, 2021, Melanie mentioned on her Instagram story that they had actually broken up a while ago but remained on good terms.\n\nJustin Greenwood\n\nDuring early 2022, there were rumors among fans that Melanie was dating Justin Greenwood (more commonly known as Verde), who is a singer, photographer, and music producer. The speculation arose from their frequent companionship and the affectionate terms they used for each other. According to Justin, they had been friends since seventh grade, and Melanie claims that he was her first kiss. On March 29, 2022, Melanie confirmed their relationship by posting a video on her Instagram story of them sharing a kiss by her pool.[13] He is still in a relationship with Melanie as of 2024.\n\nTattoos[]\n\nMain article: Melanie Martinez/Tattoos\n\nHair colors[]\n\nMain article: Melanie Martinez/Hair Colors\n\nDiscography[]\n\nMain articles: Discography & Videography\n\nAwards and nominations[]\n\nMain article: Melanie Martinez/Awards and nominations\n\nControversies[]\n\nIn September-October of 2017, Melanie was called out for being accused of sexualizing babies as how she wore \"sexy\" baby clothes during the promotional photoshoot for Cry Baby. She later posted a response through Instagram, writing:\n\nIf you don't like pop surrealism you probably won't like me. If you can't understand that visual art has a deeper meaning and you only look at it for face value you probably won't get my work. If you can't understand that crybaby is a character, that the first record is representative of her childhood, and If you sexualize female pop artists on the daily you'll say I \"sexualize babies.\" If you can't understand why someone would bring up mental health, growing pains from childhood to adolescence , family issues, and other uncomfortable topics we never hear about in pop music, you will probably just throw my music and art away as something that \"glamorizes mental health issues\" even though most of the people that resonate with my work deal with these things on a day to day and someone needs to be there for them. So here I am. If you have issues with my music and art and judge it so harshly to the point of making up your own reason as to what my intentions were when making it, you should just stop watching it. Because quite frankly, you. Just. Don't. Get. It.\n\nMelanie Martinez, via[14]\n\nIn December of 2017, Melanie had been accused of rape by her ex-friend and possible former romantic interest, Timothy Heller.[15] Melanie later dropped a statement through Twitter denying the accusations:\n\nI am horrified and saddened by the statements and story told tonight by Timothy Heller. What she and I shared was a close friendship for a period of time. We came into each other's lives as we were both starting our careers as artists, and we tried to help each other. We both had pain in dealing with our individual demons and the new paths we were forging, but I truly felt we were trying to lift each other up. She never said no to what we chose to do together. And although we parted ways, I am sending her love and light always.\n\nMelanie Martinez\n\nShe then continued to tweet another response, denying the allegations.\n\nI understand how hard it could be to see my side of the story, considering no one with a heart would want to invalidate anyone speaking up about this topic. I want to thank my fans who took the time to research the timeline, analyze past Instagram photos, and question the story being told, which reveal her false statements. I trusted so many people in my life who took advantage of that trust for their own personal gain. Please know that my intentions with everything that I do in my life are always pure and I would never be intimate with someone without their absolute consent.\n\nMelanie Martinez, via[16]\n\nTimothy then proceeded to deny either everything Melanie said.[17] Most fans of Melanie began throwing, burning, and destroying their merch after the allegation blew up. This issue led Melanie to release \"PIGGYBACK\".\n\nAfter Timothy Heller accused Melanie of rape, Madeleine Carina came out with a similar story with less detail, claiming that Melanie had pressured her into having sex. However, Melanie has never publicly addressed the accusation.\n\nIn July 2024, Timothy posted a 6 minute video on Tiktok detailing how she had been harassed and bullied off the internet due to speaking up about the allegations.
