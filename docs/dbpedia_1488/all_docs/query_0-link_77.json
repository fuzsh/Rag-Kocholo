He, she or they are likely included on this list of 50 great songs for a house party, beach party, campfire party or whatever party. Hank Williams Jr. and Jason Aldean? Of course!\n\nShania Twain and Kenny Chesney? You'll find both below and by tapping play on the above playlist. The most contemporary songs come from hitmakers Luke Combs, Kelsea Ballerini and the Cadillac Three while the oldest songs come from artists including Alabama, John Denver and Jimmy Buffett.\n\nCountry music is as essential to your party as cold drinks and good food, so don't mess around with your playlist. These songs offer a set-it-and-forget-it kind of listening experience that will amplify your party while only mildly irritating your Boomer neighbors. If they're cool, they'll come join you and know all the words to \"Family Tradition.\""
