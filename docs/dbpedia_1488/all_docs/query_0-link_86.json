        "text": "Chapter Summary: This chapter focuses on the role of music in early childhood, including the importance of musical experience in early childhood, the musical abilities and enjoyment of infants and children, and the vocal ranges of the young child. It also explores musical activities and repertoires appropriate for young children.\n\nWhat a child has heard in his first six years of life cannot be eradicated later. Thus it is too late to begin teaching at school, because a child stores a mass of musical impressions before school age, and if what is bad predominates, then his fate, as far as music is concerned, has been sealed for a lifetime.\n\n—Zoltán Kodály, Children’s Day Speech, 1951\n\nArts as a Means of Expression for Young Children\n\nHow important are the arts as a mode of expression for children? Children, especially very young children, cannot express themselves fluently either through speech or writing—two modes of communication that adults use almost exclusively. Instead, children express themselves through movement, sound, and art. If they can express themselves through these modes, it is logical that they can learn through them as well.\n\nMany times, however, adults are at a loss to understand or interpret what it is children are saying to us, or to appreciate how profound it might be. Mark E. Turner (2008), building upon the work of Edwin Gordon and Reggio Emilia, thought considerably about children’s representation through the arts. He sought to provide authentic ways for children to express themselves and developed scaffolding to better harness and understand children’s musical development. As Turner states, the idea that the “performing arts” must always be performed onstage to be valid detracts from their use to develop and explore the emotional, cognitive, social development and human potential.\n\nMusic for Young Children\n\nAny of the music methods (e.g., Kodály, Orff) mentioned in Chapter 4 offer sequential learning for children. Kodály in particular spent a great deal of effort on developing beautiful singing voices for young children. Children’s voices, after all, are their first instrument—a child’s first exceptionally pleasant musical experience is likely to be hearing lullabies from a parent or guardian, and then vocally experimenting with his or her own voice. Kodály graded learning in small steps for the very beginner learners, starting with three-note songs (sol, mi, la) and expanding gradually to four, five, and six notes and beyond. For the youngest, songs with three notes are an excellent place to start, because these children will not have much difficulty imitating or matching these pitches and can be successful from the outset.\n\nI. Music for Children Birth to Three Years Old\n\nMusic activity for infants and toddlers engages the child’s aural and physical being. Such age-old activities include tickling, wiggling, bouncing, and finger playing.\n\nAt this level, musical play creates and reinforces the special personal bond between an adult (or older child) and infant, while also introducing music to the child. For newborns and very young children, speaking a rhyme and wiggling toes connects sound to a pleasurable and intimate act, as well as introducing the idea of rhythm and phrasing to newborns and young children.\n\nBelow are a few of the rhymes and songs particularly good for newborns and toddlers. They include some very familiar nursery rhymes and action games appropriate for this age group. Keep in mind that almost any nursery rhyme can be used for these activities, as long as they have a steady beat, which luckily most of them do.\n\nBounces\n\nFor newborns to three-year-olds, having them feel the beat in their bodies, aided by adults, are called “bounces,” based on the experience of bouncing a child up and down on a knee or lap.\n\nBumpity Bump\n\nTommy O’Flynn\n\nTommy O’Flynn and the old grey mare (bounce child on knees)\n\nWent to see the country fair\n\nThe bridge fell down and the bridge fell in (open knees and let child drop a bit)\n\nAnd that was the end of Tommy O’Flynn\n\nWiggles\n\nWiggles are those activities involving the wiggling of fingers or toes. “This Little Piggy Went to Market” is another wiggle with which you may be familiar.\n\nThe first little pig danced a merry, merry jig\n\nThe second little pig ate candy\n\nThe third little pig wore a blue and yellow wig\n\nThe fourth little pig was a dandy\n\nThe fifth little pig never grew to be big\n\nSo they called him Tiny Little Andy\n\nTickles\n\nTickles involve exactly that—tickling the child either all over or just in the stomach, usually ending in lots of giggles!\n\nSlowly, slowly, very slowly up the garden trail (crawl hands up baby starting from feet)\n\nSlowly, slowly, very slowly creeps the garden snail (continue crawling)\n\nQuickly, quickly, very quickly all around the house (tickle all over)\n\nQuickly, quickly, very quickly runs the little mouse (continue tickling)\n\nMy father was a butcher (make chopping motions on child’s body)\n\nMy mother cuts the meat (make cutting motions on child’s body)\n\nAnd I’m a little hot dog\n\nThat runs around the street (tickle all over)\n\nPizza pickle pumpernickel\n\nPizza, pickle, pumpernickel (flash one hand wide, then the other, then roll arms)\n\nMy little one shall have a tickle! (tickle child)\n\nOne for your nose (tickle child’s nose)\n\nAnd one for your toes (tickle child’s toes)\n\nAnd one for your tummy, where the hot dog goes! (tickle child’s tummy)\n\nFinger Play\n\nFinger play songs can also be types of tickles. The most common finger play song is the “Eensy, Weensy Spider.”\n\nEensy Weensy Spider\n\nTapping\n\nFor an infant, the parent would take the child’s foot or hand and tap it to the beat of the music. If the child can tap by him- or herself, that will work also.\n\nCock a Doodle Do\n\nEnglish nursery rhyme, 1765\n\nCock-a-doodle doo (tap one foot)\n\nMy dame has lost her shoe\n\nMy master’s lost his fiddling stick\n\nAnd doesn’t know what to do.\n\nCock-a-doodle doo (tap other foot)\n\nWhat is my dame to do?\n\nTil master finds his fiddling stick\n\nShe’ll dance without a shoe.\n\nCock-a-doodle doo (tap both feet)\n\nMy dame has found her shoe\n\nAnd master’s found his fiddling stick\n\nSing doodle, doodle, doo.\n\nClapping (Nine+ Months)\n\nAs children develop physically, they can clap their hands either together or against those of another. The well-known “Patty Cake” is a good example.\n\nPatty Cake\n\nPatty cake, patty cake, baker’s man\n\nBake me a cake as fast as you can\n\nRoll it and pat it and mark it with a “B”\n\nAnd put it in the oven for baby and me!\n\nHot Cross Buns\n\nHot cross buns\n\nHot cross buns\n\nOne a penny, two a penny\n\nHot cross buns.\n\nPease Porridge Hot\n\nPease porridge hot\n\nPease porridge cold\n\nPease porridge in the pot\n\nNine days old.\n\nResponding to the Beat: Moving to Music\n\nResponding to a musical beat is an innate part of what it means to be human, and even the youngest children can begin to feel music, either by moving to the beat or having an adult help a child move to the beat (Feierabend, 2001).\n\nThe simplest thing to do is to find recordings of quality music and play songs with an even, steady beat and have children move, clap, tap, patsch, hit an instrument, or walk to that beat.\n\nAn extended possibility is to create a story, miming movements that reflect a steady beat while telling a simple narrative. For example, a leader begins by miming actions such as teeth brushing, bouncing a ball, or eating food from a bowl, and the group imitates them. All movements are done to the beat (e.g., teeth brushing, up down up down). At the end of the leader’s turn, the children have to remember the “storyline.”\n\nLullabies\n\nBye Baby Bunting\n\nEnglish lullaby, 1784\n\nAll the Pretty Little Horses\n\nAfrican American lullaby\n\nHush Little Baby, Don’t Say a Word\n\nAmerican lullaby song\n\nII. Music for Children Three to Five Years Old\n\nThree- to five-year-olds are capable of singing more complicated songs, doing more complicated games and rhymes, and, of course, capable of more sophisticated listening. They can also understand some of the basic vocabulary and building blocks of music. It is appropriate to introduce a few concepts when performing songs and games with children, and also to experiment with these concepts, such as changing tempos and dynamics. Some vocabulary to use when pointing out these concept to younger children include:\n\nHigh—Low (pitch)\n\nLoud—Soft (dynamics)\n\nFast—Slow (tempo)\n\nSmooth—Detached (articulation)\n\nDuple—Triple (meter)\n\nSteady Beat (tempo)\n\nTimbre (the quality of sound)\n\nFor slightly older children, Feierabend (2001) identifies activities that help children develop spontaneous music ability and original music thinking under his “Arioso” category, as well as a detailed array of vocal- and motor-based experiences with music.\n\nFeierabend’s music readiness approach in his series First Steps in Music\n\nAn 8-part Music Readiness Curriculum for 3–8 Year Old Children by John Feierabend.

Their most comfortable notes are in the middle between E and F.\n\nThe goal is to have them not sing too far below the staff or too low in their voices, and to not push or strain their voices too far above this range either. Singing should be light, in the child’s head voice, never forced or pushed, and beautiful music-making should be stressed.\n\nInitially, children need to explore their voices to find out what they are capable of, and to start hearing that their voices do indeed have a range to them. It is very good for children to make light, airy, and smooth sounds in their head voice as they find their individual sound.\n\nBegin with some vocal exploration with speech, just getting them to loosen up and find their high, light head voice.\n\nVoice exploration speech exercises\n\n1. I take my voice up high\n\nI take my voice up high (start low, and slide voice up)\n\nI bring my voice down low (Start high, and slide voice down)\n\nI send my voice out into space (Cup hands around mouth and project)\n\nI whisper all around, whisper, whisper (Whisper line and whisper to neighbors)\n\n2. Bow wow\n\nBow wow, says the dog (medium voice)\n\nMeow, meow says the cat (high voice)\n\nGrunt, grunt says the hog (low voice)\n\nSqueak, squeak says the rat (very high)\n\n3. Elevator\n\nHave the children pretend their voice is an elevator sliding up and down between floors. They can accompany their vocal exploration with physical moving up and down as well, or the teacher may want to have a focal object like a puppet moving up and down that they can follow with their voice.\n\nPitch matching songs and games\n\nBegin with simple but interesting songs with small ranges. These songs can be varied and repeated, and help children sing accurately. “Who’s Wearing Blue” is an excellent warm-up or opening activity in a music class. What did the children wear? do? see? There are endless, creative opportunities to ask them about their lives in a few notes.\n\nSol, mi, la songs\n\nWho’s Wearing Blue?\n\nWe are Dancing in the Forest\n\nMi, re, do songs\n\nHot Cross Buns\n\nEnglish traditional street cry, 1733\n\nSimple songs in a limited range\n\nRain, Rain Go Away\n\nTraditional children’s song, 17th century\n\nSnail, Snail\n\nChildren form a single line, holding on the waist of the child in front of them. The child at the front of the line is the snail’s head, who holds up and wiggles both index fingers on the forehead representing the snail’s eyestalks. The line shuffles around the room imitating the slow, fluid motions of a snail.\n\nLittle Sally Water\n\nTraditional American circle game song\n\nSee Saw, Margery Daw\n\nEnglish nursery rhyme, 1765\n\nI Have Lost my Closet Key\n\nAmerican folk song\n\nAccompanying game for “I Have Lost my Closet Key”: Children sit in a circle. One child hides a key in their hand while another child walks around the circle trying to guess who has the key while all sing Verse 1. After finding the key, all sing Verse 2. That person then becomes “it” and another is chosen to hide the key.\n\nAu Clair de la Lune\n\nFrench folk song\n\nRing Around the Rosy\n\nEnglish song attributed to 1665 Black Plague, but sources only go back to 19th century\n\nSally Go Round the Sun\n\nRocky Mountain\n\nAppalachian folk song\n\nNo Bears Out Tonight\n\nOne child is the “bear” who hides while others count one o’ clock to midnight.\n\nChildren search for the bear, then run back to “home” when the bear is found.\n\nThe Mulberry Bush\n\nEnglish nursery rhyme, 1840s\n\nInstrumental Music Activities for Three to Five Years Old\n\nHigh/Low Pitches: You or a child plays a low instrument (drum, bass xylophone, etc.) and children respond by moving in low space. Then try the same for high-pitched instruments (triangle, tambourine, etc.), having them move through high space.\n\nFast/Slow Tempo and Loud/Soft Dynamics Game: Similar to above, play instruments in different tempos and dynamics. Switch and mix them up (fast and loud, soft and slow, fast and soft, slow and loud), and if the child doesn’t switch, he or she is out.\n\nContrasting Timbres: Assign a different movement to different timbres. For example, a wood block corresponds to a hop, a xylophone glissando is a leap, a shaker means to shake. Create an orchestra with half of the class playing and the other half responding. For more advanced children, create a choreographed and composed piece from the game.\n\nMusical Simon Says: Review concepts learned such as loud/soft, high/low, or fast/slow. Simon says yell loud, Simon says whisper, Simon says sing high, Simon says groan low, etc.\n\nRhymes and Games\n\nPoetry and rhymes are among the most basic forms of human expression, and both children and adults use poetry, rhymes, and games to tell stories, remember history, fantasize, dream, and play. For young children, the rhyme is magical as they first encounter the powerful sound of rhyming words. Words create rhythmic patterns that captivate a child’s attention. The natural rhythms inherent in rhyming can become the basis for exploration, improvisation, vocalizations, and instrumental creativity.\n\nRhymes with actions, in particular, are enjoyable to children because children live through all of their senses and their whole body. Adding movement helps reinforce the linguistic content of the rhyme or song. Movement and rhymes build cognitive abilities in terms of sequencing physical and linguistic activity, imitation, and internalization.\n\nAdding Movement to Rhymes\n\nThere are many types of movement to add to rhymes and games. There are narrative movements, which are mimetic actions that help to illustrate certain words and tell the story (e.g., “I’m a Little Teapot”); abstract movements, which do not carry any specific linguistic meaning, such as waving arms or jumping; and rhythmic movements, which can either emphasize the beat of the rhyme or the rhythm of the text, such as clapping or body percussion.\n\nNarrative Movements: It is easy to add narrative movements to most children’s rhymes as these poems often tell some type of story. Consider the rhyme “I’m a Little Ducky.” Adding swimming and flapping motions would be an obvious activity to add. Narrative motions not only bring the story to life, but also significantly help children to remember the words to a rhyme or song.\n\nI’m a little ducky swimming in the water\n\nI’m a little ducky doing what I oughter\n\nTook a bite of a lily pad\n\nFlapped my wings and said, “I’m glad”\n\nI’m a little ducky swimming in the water\n\nFlap, flap, flap\n\nAbstract Motions and Rhythmic Motions: Almost any non-locomotive or even some locomotive motions would work here. Abstract motions can easily be rhythmic as well (e.g., swaying to the beat, nodding the head to the beat, tapping the rhythm of the words or beat, etc.).\n\nWalking to the Beat: While a seemingly simple-sounding exercise, walking to the beat requires a physical awareness and near-constant mental and physical adjustment to the walking stride in order to fit the beat and tempo of the rhyme.\n\nExample: Take any standard, well-known nursery rhyme. Walk to the beat while saying the rhyme. End precisely on the last beat of the rhyme and freeze!\n\nAdvanced: This game can be further developed for older or more advanced children. Once they are walking to a steady beat and stopping precisely on the last beat, have children drop the recitation of the rhyme, and just walk the beat. See if they can all still stop on the last beat! This helps students internalize the beat and phrases of the song.\n\nSteady Beat Games\n\nPass the Beat: Begin with a simple rhyme or song. While sitting in a circle, have students pass a beanbag around the circle on the beat. If the child misses, they are “out” or “in the soup” in the middle of the circle.\n\nBouncing Beat: Another game is to bounce a ball to the beat of a simple song such as “Bounce High.” This is a little more challenging because they have to keep control of their bodies, voices, and a ball.\n\nS, M, L song\n\nBounce High\n\nAction Songs\n\nHead and Shoulders (Key of F)\n\nShoo Fly\n\nAmerican folk song, 1863\n\nDo You Know the Muffin Man?\n\nEnglish folk song, 1820\n\nDid You Ever See a Lassie?\n\nAmerican folk song, late 19th century\n\nGo to Sleep\n\nIf You’re Ready for Music\n\nRhymes\n\nDeedle, Deedle Dumpling\n\nDeedle, deedle dumpling, my son John\n\nWent to bed with his stockings on\n\nOne shoe off and one shoe on\n\nDeedle, deedle dumpling, my son John\n\nOliver Twist\n\nOliver Twist, Twist, Twist\n\nCan’t do this, this, this\n\nTouch his nose, nose, nose\n\nTouch his toes, toes, toes\n\nAnd around he goes, goes, goes\n\nRub, Rub\n\nRub, rub, rub\n\n________’s in the tub\n\nRub her/him dry\n\nHang her high\n\nRub, rub, rub\n\nJingle Jive\n\nJingle, jingle, jingle jive\n\nMove until you count to five\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nOpen Shut Them\n\nThis is an action game song where the lyrics are imitated through movement using simple actions in both hands.\n\nOpen Shut Them\n\nOpen, shut them, Open, shut them, (open and shut both hands)\n\nGive a little clap, clap, clap (clap on each “clap”)\n\nOpen, shut them, Open, shut them, (open and shut both hands)\n\nPut them in you lap, lap, lap (tap open hands on thighs)\n\nCreep them, creep them, creep them, creep them, (crawl hands up to chin)\n\nRight up to your chin, chin, chin (tap on each “chin”)\n\nOpen wide your little mouth (open mouth)\n\nBut do not put them in, in, in (tap on each “chin” again)\n\nIII. Musical Developmental Milestones in Young Children\n\nAlthough we might not have thought of it, children’s linguistic development is related to their musical development. Research shows a direct correlation between the development of children’s speech and their musical/singing ability, with music skills correlating significantly with both phonological awareness and reading development (Anvari et al., 2002).\n\nWhile teachers of preschool children may have a sense of the linguistic milestones for children, they are less aware of the musical milestones. Since music and language development have a high correlation in terms of development, it is helpful to know what activities children are developmentally ready for musically, and when are they ready for them. For example, most four- and even five-year-olds are not yet able to play a steady beat on an instrument. Expecting them to will only frustrate both the children and yourself. The following chart indicates musical developmental ability by age, and will guide you in introducing musical skills and material that children are developmentally ready for.\n\nMusical Abilities by Age.\n\nAge\n\nMusical Behaviors\n\nAppropriate Activities\n\nLimitations\n\n0–1 year old (Infants)\n\nEnjoy hearing:\n\nMelodic contour in voice\n\nBeing sung to\n\nHearing a variety of styles of music\n\nEnjoy:\n\nBeing rocked, patted, and stroked to music\n\nResponding to rhythmic play and body touch songs\n\nBouncing or jumping to music\n\nExperimenting with gestures, clapping, and pointing\n\nPlaying with rattles and bells\n\nCannot use language or sing\n\n1–2 years old (Toddlers)\n\nAre aware of musical sounds\n\nDemand repetition\n\nDelayed response during music time\n\nCreate their own made-up songs\n\nSing simple 1–2 word songs\n\nEnjoy voice inflection games\n\nEnjoy making random sounds on instruments\n\nImprovise their own lyrics to traditional songs\n\nRespond to musical stimuli\n\nPerform rhythmic movement and movement patterns\n\nClap to music, steady beat\n\nMove and respond to signals and sound and silence games\n\nCannot sing “in tune” but can maintain melodic contour\n\nDevelopmental Issues:\n\n“Centering” (pre-operational stage) can fix a child’s attention on one perceptual feature.
