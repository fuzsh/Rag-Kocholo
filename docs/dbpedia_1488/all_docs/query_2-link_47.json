        "text": "Hardcore weirdos Candy have shared “Love Like Snow,” which you can stream below. It’s the second song from their upcoming full-length It’s Inside You.\n\nThe song is melodic and soft for the band, which is interesting, and ties in a lot of electronic and trance elements to create something really cool. From what we can hear, this one could already be a contender for hardcore album of the year, and we’re excited for the full record to drop.\n\nThe track also features vocals for MIRSY, the side project of Marisa Shriar from Fleshwater, and mmph, the alias of producer Sae Heum Han, mixed and co-produced the song. Like much of the record, it isn’t afraid to lean into collaboration.\n\n“Love Like Snow” comes out alongside a cool video by Candy’s Michael Quick. It’s weird and varied and awesome just like the full record, which drops June 7 via Relapse Records. Watch the video below to catch all the subtle and strange nuances present.\n\nIt’s Inside You was produced by Candy’s Michael Quick along with Uniform’s Ben Greenberg and mixed by Kurt Ballou at God City Studios. It’s their most experimental, brutal, and eclectic album yet, so get ready to be wowed. This is gonna be a heavy one.\n\nPre-order It’s Inside You here.\n\nCandy will also be performing two nights with The Dillinger Escape Plan at New York City’s Brooklyn Paramount on June 21 and June 23 . Both shows are now sold out. To those lucky enough to have scored tickets, we’re jealous.\n\n06/21 Brooklyn, NY @ Brooklyn Paramount w/ Car Bomb & Candy\n\n06/23 Brooklyn, NY @ Brooklyn Paramount w/ Deadguy, Candy, Car Bomb & The Callous Daoboys\n\nStay tuned for more info as the album release date approaches."
