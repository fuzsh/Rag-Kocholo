Song Production Information

Originally from The Strangeloves, Bow Wow Wow turned this song into a New-Wave classic in the 80's. We thought it would be irresistible for the DDR dance floor, so we sent it to Pop n' Fresh for an up-to-date make-over. This new version, with a funky electro edge, is absolutely pumpin'!
