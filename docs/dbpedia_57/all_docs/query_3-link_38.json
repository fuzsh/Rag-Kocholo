        "text": "Real time simulation with real objects is an important step in aeroengine FADEC system research. In consideration of the relationship between turbojet control system simulation, test and future application in aircraft, a missile turbojet digital control real time simulation system with real objects based on PC/104 was built. The system outline, hardware layout and adaptive predictive control method were discussed in detail. The result of simulation test shows that the system can not only control engine completely, but also provide a convenient means for FADEC system research.\n\nTiltrotor can flight both airplane mode and helicopter mode by changing the propulsion thrust vector via angle of nacelle. Therefore tiltrotor has performance of vertical and short take-off and land (V/STOL), multi-purpose aircraft with excellent high-speed cruise. However, it is very difficult to design the flight control system for transforming the flight mode because both thrust vector and aerodynamic force are used. First the model of the tiltrotor is given, and then the method of optical control is present to design the flight control system. The power of propeller constant conversion scheme that is supporting the power of the propeller is constant while tiltrotor coverts the flight mode has been interpreted. Finally the flight control system is simulated and the simulation results have been proved that the flight control system is feasible.\n\nTiltrotor can flight both airplane mode and helicopter mode by changing the propulsion thrust vector via angle of nacelle. Therefore tiltrotor has performance of vertical and short take-off and land (V/STOL), multi-purpose aircraft with excellent high-speed cruise. However, it is very difficult to design the flight control system because of the effect of model parameter variation and external disturbances. First the model of the tiltrotor is given, and then the method of sliding mode control is present to design the flight control system. To avoid the chattering phenomenon in sliding mode control, the method of fuzzy sliding mode control is applied, which incorporates sliding mode control with the fuzzy control. Finally the flight control system is simulated and the simulation results show that the flight control system has strong robustness and excellent dynamic characteristics."
