        "text": "A very simple and affective solution to harnesses cutting off the blood supply to your main artery in your legs when you fall. Resulting in loss of consciousness and possible fatality. A strap that enables you to put your feet in and lift your body weight to prevent the blood flow being cut off. A smart and Simone idea.\n\nArresting a fall is only the first step in preventing injury or death. Even if the arrest does not cause injury, a fallen worker can die from suspension trauma (orthostatic shock) if not rescued in time. Too often, a worker is saved by a personal fall arrest system (PFAS), only to succumb to suspension trauma while waiting for rescue. Many safety professionals assume their job is done if they limit total PFAS arresting force to 1,800 pounds and prevent impact injury during a fall. Unfortunately, post-fall suspension trauma and the time needed for rescue are often left out of fall protection plans. For a fallen worker awaiting rescue, suspension trauma can become a life-threatening emergency if not handled properly. Therefore, a fall protection plan should always include a plan for rescue.\n\nWhile your safety harness in combination with required fall protection equipments will protect you from hitting the ground in the case of a fall, it will not protect you from experiencing suspension trauma or orthostatic intolerance if there is inadequate rescue plan in place. Suspension trauma is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when a person is hung in an upright position for a long period of time, usually while wearing a safety harness. This can result in decreased blood circulation and blood pooling in the legs, resulting in a decrease in blood pressure and an inadequate supply of oxygen to the brain. When operating at heights or in situations where suspension may occur, it is critical to be aware of this risk and to take proper safeguards, which will include but not limited to ensuring the harness is equipped with a suspension strap. #suspensionstrap #workingatheight #fall protection #safeguards #bodyharness #knowledge #beaware #"
