        "text": "Introduction: Cholera is an acute gastrointestinal infection caused by Vibrio cholerae, which may lead to severe dehydration and death if not treated. This analysis is aimed at highlighting the magnitude, pattern and trend of cholera outbreaks that occurred in Kaduna State in 2014 Methods: We obtained the 2014 cholera line-list from the Kaduna State Disease Surveillance and Notification officer (DSNO). We described the outbreaks in time, place, and person using Epi-info 7 and Health Mapper. Results: A total of 1468 cases and 54 deaths were recorded, giving a case fatality rate (CFR) of 3.68%. Female cases were 55.08%. The mean age for all cases is 18 years, median age 15 years, with an age range of 0.04 – 90 years. Age specific case fatality rate (ASCFR) is highest among the >60 years. Seven (7) out of the 23 local government areas (LGAs) in Kaduna State reported cholera outbreaks in 2014. Igabi LGA has the highest attack rate (150.46 per 100,000 population) while Chikun LGA has the lowest attack rate (12.22 per 100,000 population). Chikun LGA records the highest CFR (17.54%). Cholera infection spread across LGAs sharing the same borders. The outbreak starts from the first epidemic week of 2014 and lasted over 33 weeks. Conclusion: Our analysis revealed a cholera outbreak that gradually increases in magnitude throughout the first half of 2014, and spread within contiguous LGAs. We recommended the strengthening of the state’s surveillance system and the need for proper training and motivation of front line health workers towards timely detection and response to outbreaks.\n\nBackground: Cholera is an acute gastro-intestinal infection caused by Vibrio cholerae, which may lead to severe dehydration and death if not treated. On August 31, 2015, the Kaduna Ministry of Health received a notification of increase cases of vomiting and diarrhea at Dusten-Abba in Zaria LGA. A response Team was sent to confirm the outbreak, describe the socio-demographic characteristics and identify possible risk factors for the outbreak. Methods: We defined cases according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. We conducted an unmatched case-control study and descriptive study. We retrieved line-listed cases at the ward facility. We interviewed cases at the facility and recruited controls from the community, and administered questionnaires to both cases and controls. We analyzed data using Epi-Info7 and Microsoft Excel 2016. Results: A total of 50 cases were recorded, with a median age of 20yrs and age range of 1 – 50yrs. There were more females (68%) than males. Majority of cases (52%) are under 20yrs, while all cases are below 50yrs. Seven deaths were recorded giving a Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of 14%. The CFR is higher in females (14.7%) than in males (12.5%). Index case was seen on August 29, 2015. The outbreak lasted five days. Last cases seen on September 2, 2015. Highest number of cases seen in a day (23) was on third day of the outbreak. Only two cases (4%) had their samples tested using cholera RDT, and both tested positive Drinking un-boiled water (OR:12.67, 95%CI: 2.33–68.93), regular hand washing (OR: 0.22, 95%CI: 0.06–0.90) and proper waste disposal practices (OR: 0.07, 95%CI: 0.02–0.36) are factors we found to affect cholera infection during the outbreak. Conclusion: Our investigation confirmed a cholera outbreak with a high CFR, especially among females. Poor hygienic practices among the populace seem to be the divers for this outbreak. Key Words: Cholera, Outbreak, Hygienic practices, Kaduna.\n\nVibrio species are waterborne ubiquitous organisms capable of causing diseases in humans and animals and the occurrence of infections caused by pathogenic Vibrio species among humans have increased globally. This reemergence is attributed to environmental impacts such as global warming and pollution. Africa is most vulnerable to waterborne infections caused by these pathogens because of lack of good water stewardship and management. This study was carried out to provide an in-depth inquiry into the occurrence of pathogenic Vibrio species in water sources and wastewater across Africa. In this regard, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted by searching five databases: PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Springer Search and African Journals Online (AJOL). The search yielded 70 articles on pathogenic Vibrio species presence in African aquatic environments that fit our inclusion criteria. Based on the random effects model, the pooled prevalence of pathogenic Vibrio species in various water sources in Africa was 37.6 % (95 % CI: 27.7-48.0). Eighteen countries were represented by the systematically assessed studies and their nationwide prevalence in descending order was: Nigeria (79.82 %), Egypt (47.5 %), Tanzania (45.8 %), Morocco (44.8), South Africa (40.6 %), Uganda (32.1 %), Cameroon (24.5 %), Burkina Faso (18.9 %) and Ghana (5.9 %). Furthermore, 8 pathogenic Vibrio species were identified across water bodies in Africa with the highest detection for V. cholerae (59.5 %), followed by V. parahaemolyticus (10.4 %), V.alginolyticus (9.8 %), V. vulnificus (8.5 %), V. fluvialis (6.6 %), V. mimicus (4.6 %), V. harveyi (0.5 %) and V. metschnikovii (0.1 %). Evidently, pathogenic Vibrio species occurrence in these water sources especially freshwater corroborates the continuous outbreaks observed in Africa. Therefore, there is an urgent need for proactive measures and continuous monitoring of water sources used for various purposes across Africa and proper treatment of wastewater before discharge into water bodies."
