        "text": "Any Bahamian national who feels that his or her data privacy rights have been infringed upon by any data collector or controller may seek redress by contacting the Data Protection Commissioner. The Commissioner seeks to ensure that:\n\nPersonal information that is collected on individuals is managed in a manner that observes fundamental privacy rights.\n\nIndividuals are able to access personal information kept on them.\n\nData is used in a manner that is consistent with the intentions of the data subject.\n\nAny Bahamian may make these complaints.\n\nLodge your complaint with the head of the offending institution (data controller), escalating the issue to the Data Protection Commissioner, only after 21 days have elapsed with no response, or when the response is not satisfactory.\n\nReport the issue to the office of the Data Protection Commissioner. Whilst using the telephone to do so is an option, it is preferred that you fill out the Privacy Complaint Form in its entirety and return to the office of the Data Protection Commissioner at the contact information provided below. Alternatively, you may also write a letter providing the following information:\n\nYour name and contact information.\n\nRelevant dates, location and times.\n\nA description of the issue / incident.\n\nDetails of any telephone conversations and meetings.\n\nCopies of relevant documents.\n\nAny other relevant information.\n\nWritten consent permitting the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner to disclose the details of the complaint to the offending institution.\n\nYou should keep copies of all communiqués between you and the commissioner’s office, as these may need to be used as evidence in the future. Additionally, you are encouraged to follow-up, in writing and or via the telephone as necessary. Should the matter not be satisfactorily resolved, you may wish to seek legal redress from a higher authority.\n\nClick here to view the Complaints Handling Policy Statement & Guidelines.\n\nApplication Form(s)\n\nPrivacy Complaint Form\n\nSupporting Documents\n\nNo supporting documents are required for this service.\n\nTurn-around time\n\nThe Office of the Data Protection Commissioner will issue an acknowledgement to you within 2 working days of receiving your report, whilst the offending institution would be given 21 days from the time that the Data Protection Commissioner contacts it to respond.\n\nThere are no deadlines for this service.\n\nRelated Fee(s)\n\nThere are no fees associated with this service.\n\nFor more information please contact"
