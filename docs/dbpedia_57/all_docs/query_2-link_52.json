Send us your aircheck and a short bio, we will post it here. Thank you for your participation!\n\nAJ [Full name, A.J. Battalio] came to the morning show at KLCK, 98.9, from KBUL, Reno, by way of Lubbock, TX\n\nA.J. Roberts was PD at KHIT/Bremerton, now works at KOMO TV. He is the resident expert on “Super Heroes”\n\nAaron Brown – “Skip” Brown was a newsman at news-talk KTW-AM 1250 when the station was trying to compete against Seattle’s established all-news powerhouse KIRO-AM. (Skip was young; he refused to tell his age. Further, Brown does not list KTW in his work resume. He was born, if you want to know, in 1948.) Prior to joining “KING Newservice” at KING-TV in 1976, Brown also worked at KRAB-FM, producing special programs, including a documentary about life in Washington prisons for NPR. Brown also reported the Washington State Legislature for three months for KTVW Channel 13, (a public television station at the time.) He spent 18 years in Seattle as reporter or anchor for first KING-TV, then KIRO-TV. In 1991 he left Seattle for a job at ABC-TV in New York leading to him anchoring “World News Tonight.” and reporting on “Nightline.” From 2001 to 2005 Brown was anchorman for the cable network CNN where he reinforced his discerning, smiling, sometimes-even-smirking delivery as reporter and anchor. His first “broadcast day” on CNN was September 11, 2001, where he provided coverage of the Twin Towers bombing from a rooftop in lower Manhattan. For his “calming and insightful” coverage he won an Edward R. Murrow Award. Brown also has three Emmys, a DuPont Award, a New York Film Society World Medal and a George Foster Peabody Award. He hosted CNN’s “NewsNight Now with Aaron Brown” but was replaced by Anderson Cooper. He then appeared on several PBS feature reports. He became the inaugural Walter Cronkite Professor of Journalism instructor at Arizona State University in 2009. Lives with wife Charlotte Raynor, former KING 5 reporter, in Arizona.\n\nAaron Levine [Q13 News]\n\nAaron Taylor [KMPS] he works at MusicMaster/A-Ware Software in Mukilteo, WA\n\nAbe Beeson grew up in Western Washington and as a student at Pacific Lutheran University landed a job at KPLU, editing and producing audio for news stories. Up comes a Christmas Day shift no one else wanted it; Beeson thus got his first on-air experience. This led to an overnight shift, then Saturday afternoons, and now, since 1998, Beeson has been the host of “Evening Jazz,” 7 to midnight. He once locked himself out of the station on a particularly cold winter night. (VOS2012) Abe Beeson currently works at 88.5, which now sports call letters KNKX.\n\nAbbi Kaplan – KEZX; KNDD personality\n\nAdam Gehrke – weather@ Q13 and news for Sandusky radio. Adam Gehrke is the Quick Commute Traffic anchor for Q13 FOX News This Morning, weekdays 5-9 am. Adam was honored by Seattle Magazine as “Seattle’s Best Traffic Reporter,” after years of broadcasting traffic updates on countless radio stations around Puget Sound. He expanded his career into TV when he joined Q13 FOX News. That TV career followed his first 10 years of work in radio. Somewhere in the mix of all those stations he worked for, Adam was overheard recording a stock report on a business/talk station and was immediately drafted as a traffic reporter. Adam is a graduate of the University of Puget Sound, with a degree in Communication and a minor in Music. When he isn’t on air broadcasting, Adam is probably working on a stellar new magic trick, recording a new song, practicing Baguazhang in a local park, or taking a power nap.\n\nAdam Gordon was not content to simply announce sports events, he built a career as an executive producer and program creator. He spent 15 years before the microphone and 15 years behind the mike. Gordon attended Washington State University and got his start in broadcasting in 1988 with the Spokane Chiefs. In 1990 he took over as broadcast director for the Tacoma Rockets. From there he worked as broadcaster and producer for the International Hockey League, the Houston Aeros Hockey Club, and the Everett Silvertips of the Western Hockey League. He also had stints in Tokyo television, Certified Public Accountants, Microsoft., the Versus Network, NBC, Root Sports and the Pac12 Network. (CHBCenter, 2014)\n\nAdam Thompson, KING 5 Investigative Photojournalist, died at age 44, June 3, 2022, just two weeks after marrying KING video editor Amber Litz. Thompson had been diagnosed with an extremely aggressive and unpredictable form of brain cancer.\n\nAdrian Ramirez is a street reporter for Q13 KCPQ\n\nAl Clarke worked as an actor at the Cirque Playhouse in March of 1966. It is possible that he was already working in radio at this time or had worked in radio previously Al shows up in the Seattle Times radio listings for the first time on 7/30/1967 at KBLE FM. He is listed at various times as morning man all the way to all nights at the end and was gone from KBLE before 5/3/70 when he is listed in a Victor Stredicke column as a radio personality at KVAC AM in Forks. He shows up as being interviewed on Bill Carters Partyline on the subject of alcoholism. On 12/10/1972 Stredicke says Clarke has a telephone talk show on KURB. By June, 1973 Clarke is advertising for items to stock a non-profit treatment center called “Comprehensive Alcoholism Programs”. In April of 1982, Clarke is working at KMPS as a radio personality and a story in The Seattle Times had details of a fire in the 6 story building on Western Ave. that housed the station. Clarke was quoted as saying “I shut it off the air, then flat took off. It was a dandy”. That was the last listing I could find for Al Clarke.\n\nAl Cummings – living the life in Mexico. Major star at KING AM in the 1950s. Also worked for 1150 KRSC, 770 KXA, KTNT TV 11, 1400 KTNT, 570 KVI, 1150 KAYO, 1300 KOL, 710 KIRO, KYAC 1460 (talk show), KISW FM (talk show)…Al wrote to us in 2011: “How wonderful to bring up the memories of radio in Seattle! I got into radio after WW2 in the Air Force (part of the Army)I did a stint as a night club entertainer acting as a foil for a fantastic mime. We were booked by MCA, which was a small company then. In Baltimore, my partner and I split up and I went to work for WBAL. From there, I went to WWDC in Washington. I did the all night show. One of my listeners was President Truman. After that, I ducked The Capitol and went to several small stations in the East. I saw an ad in BROADCASTING for a morning man in San Francisco. I auditioned and got hired by….Elroy McCaw… Now there is a man who ought to be mentioned in Radio History. He sent me to Seattle to help with a new station there, with the promise that he would later move me to San Francisco. I never went. I fell in love with that overgrown cow town! Oh, I could rattle on!”\n\nAl Monroe [KRKO]\n\nAl Munroe [KITZ]\n\nAl Vanik says: Yes, at one time Al Vanik was both Al Mack and Allen MacKenzie – but I think that was Portland/KISN when I was working for Buzz Barr. At KOL, where I worked for Buzz before he went to KISN, Buzz gave me the name Al Mack. Rhett Hamilton Walker the First was Afternoons as I recall. Yes, .. I was also Gary Mitchell at the BIG 11/K-I-N-Geee ..\n\nNow, there was a name switch when I was working Part Time on two different stations in Seattle. At KUBE, I was Gary Mitchell and when I finished my Sunday shift on KUBE, I’d go over to KVI where I became Al Vanik – with a whole different KVI Style.\n\nNo, I was never “Gary Mack” that is another Guy, and, I’ve heard he’s pretty good! ‘s clearer.\n\nI worked in Radio from 1965 to 1987 – so, that’s actually 22 years, and from 1987 to now, I’ve been doing VO, which is 36 years. (Don’t add `em up – it’s a LONG time).\n\nVO/Voice Acting is NOT Radio, it is definitely NOT Announcing. It is a Totally Different Craft – a whole other Part of you comes to Life. During the 36 years I’ve been working at it, I’ve created all kinds of things for my Customers, from TV to Radio, Conventions, Narrations, anything a Customer wants a Voice Actor to vocally – “Paint a Picture”. I work every day, even when I’m out of the country in Portugal or in another city. I have remote gear to record what my Customers ask me to record.\n\n**I’m here for my Customers – always have been, always will be.** (VANIK-2023)\n\nAl Wallace – Al Wallace came to Seattle for a news job at KING-AM, eventually became the station’s news director. A short time later he transferred to KING-TV, first as beat reporter, but then as evening news anchorman. On screen, Wallace was a “hard news” advocate, but he personally preferred human-interest stories. Through the ’70s he was featured doing short human-interest stories. This led to a high-profile Sunday evening local TV show, “How Come?” in which he explained how things were made, or why they were important. He died in 1983 at age 58. Leukemia.\n\nAl Workman -Al shows up in the Seattle Times radio listings at KBLE on Feb 21, 1965. Al had a country and western band, so he was a natural for KBLE FM’s venture into country music. After going through several jocks at KBLE since Al arrived at KBLE, we find in a Victor Stredicke column on 10/4/1970 that Gary McCartie the morning man and John Todd have left KBLE and Al Workman, program director, now has an air shift from 6 AM to 7:30 PM. It had to be automation or he was one tired dude. The last time Al shows up associated with KBLE FM is in a column by Stredicke on 2/3/1971 listing local radio personality’s set to appear at the next KIRO Variety Club Telethon.\n\nAl Wynn – Manager at KXA, left town and bought part ownership of KODL, The Dalles, OR.\n\nAlan Archer worked at KRKO, Everett, KAYO, KRPM, KQIN KUBE FM and KVI. In Costa Rica under his real name Alan McMullen he began as a disk jockey in San Jose, CR. In 1975 in Costa Rica, Alan worked at Radio Uno. After Seattle, he moved to Olympia and worked at “the South Sound Country” KAYO 99.3, Elma, and Olympia’s “The Eagle” KFMY 97.7 He was news announcer, assistant program director. In 1993 he wrote a weekly column “Computer Talk,” for the Olympia newspaper. He worked for the Department of Social and Health Services. When Alan retired from DSHS in Washington, he moved to Chehalis WA and started working for KITI/Live 95 in September 2017 and is still working then on-air and having fun.\n\nAlan Budwill enjoyed 32 years as co-host of the KPLZ morning show with Kent Phillips. Budwill retired in January 2019.\n\nAlan Mason/Mike Rivers – KGW/Portland, KING-AM Program Director\n\nAlan Prell began in January 2005 as KIRO-AM’s midafternoon replacement for Dave Ross. (Ross was off the air while running for public office.) Prell, a Nebraska native, had previous experience with radio talk shows in Reno, Los Angeles and dating back to 1975, Maryland, where he was replaced by syndicated Rush Limbaugh. Prell was funny but whacked out. A liberal who considered himself “moderate,” he could be sarcastic to callers who did not agree. He wrote an obituary for “Alan Prell Jr. the right-wing talk show host.” When he was fired from KIRO nine months later, he tormented the owner, Entercom Communications Corp. and picketed the station, He was draped in an American flag and “chains of oppression.” He since has written several books, including “The Brothers Prell,” a novel about growing up in Nebraska, and “Ka-Ching, the Repository of Universal Wisdom.” Prell, now living in Virginia, cautions that this book is for “those of you who move your lips while reading.” (VOS2012)\n\nAlan Stuart is perhaps familiar as disk jockey and production director on KZAM, KJZZ, KLSY-AM-FM from 1981 to 1988. He was disk jockey and production aide in 1990 at KJR-AM. In 2007 he started the pirate radio station Spunk FM. A website offers this information: “We have been broadcasting without a license for several years. Recently it has come to our attention that the FCC has been looking for us. “To avoid a fine, and the possibility that we would never be able to get a broadcasting license, we have shut down our FM transmitter. Soon, we will start a fund-raising campaign to raise money for the goal of getting our license, and the other expenses of getting the Spunk FM back on-the-air legally”\n\n—–ADDENDUM— December 6, 2012\n\nAlan Stuart Eskenazy\n\nSeattle, Washington 98109\n\nNOTICE OF UNLICENSED OPERATION\n\nCase Number: EB-FIELDWR-12-00005178\n\nDocument Number: W201332980001\n\nThe Seattle District Office (of the F.C.C.) received information that an unlicensed broadcast radio station on 101.9 MHz was allegedly operating in Seattle, Washington.

Porter and fellow team member Tim Hunter had been paired on KLSY in afternoons in 1987 before forming a morning show with Bruce Murdock in 1989, that ran until 2004. Porter herself understood her ability to connect with people in person or via the airwaves. On her personal website, she wrote that “nothing is more important and personal to me than being in a position to help others. … Radio is the way I’ve found to be present in the moment when people need help. So, I chose radio, or it chose me, I will never know.” After 15 years Murdock left the station. Porter and Hunter had hoped to continue in Seattle radio as a duo. They were not rehired at KLSY. Porter, who lived in Maple Valley, was born and reared in Seaside, Or., where she started working for a local radio station while still in high school. She graduated from the University of Oregon. She worked at two stations in Eugene before moving to Seattle’s KEZX-FM announcing news and traffic reports and sailboarding reports. She died a year after leaving KLSY.

KMGI was Seattle’s first commercial station to occupy the 107.7 frequency. The format at “Magic 108” was a bit more than adult-contemporary. The major competitor on the dial as KLSY, 92.5, and the two stations’ ratings were neck and neck except at night when the dedication show “Lights Out” stomped KMGI. The Magic lasted three years. New owners came in 1991 and the station became KNND. After Seattle, Kelly and Alpha went to “hot hits” KBEQ, Kansas City, then KYUU, also in Kansas.

On the air he used bells and whistles and shouted out three-digit numbers (which seemed to have something to do with sexual conquests). In 1977 Barber left KING-AM — the departure was explained as a medical emergency, but Barber popped up as a utility announcer at KTNQ, Los Angeles. From 1978 through 1981, Barber continued to work in Top 40 and CHR radio at KYTE, Portland, KULF in Houston, and KMGC, Portland.

Alyeska and struck a tree. Funeral services for the 46-year-old broadcasting executive, owner of KHAR AM-FM and TV, will be held at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday at the Anchorage Funeral Chapel. Harpel was the first person in the Anchorage area to suffer fatal injuries in a snowmobile accident. Earlier, two other fatalities had been reported in the state from mishaps occurring on snow machines. An avid snowmobile enthusiast and recognized as one of Alaska’s leading broadcasters, Harpel died seven years and one week after he first put KHAR radio on the air in Anchorage on Jan. 7, 1961. In the intervening years, Harpel built “Heart Radio” into a broadcasting operation that had a great impact on listening habits in the Anchorage area. Starting from a trailer studio on the Seward Highway, Harpel built his station into a leading broadcast operation that saw FM added on Dec. 22,1966, and television added on Channel 13 last Oct. 31. Harpel’s last day of a life that began June 28, 1921, in Clear Lake, S.D., was the outdoors that he loved. Accompanied by Larry Weatherman, public relations and advertising manager for the National Bank of Alaska and one of Harpel’s closest friends, the broadcaster was on a snowmobile outing up the long trail toward Crow Creek mine. “We were almost to the top, up where you can look over and see Whittier,” said Weatherman, “when we decided to come back. The snow really was too deep. “Bill was driving his big racing machine with a new motor, and was running well ahead of me. He would stop, look back, and see that I was all right, and then go on again. Back down the trail was hard packed and rough. He must have hit a bump and sailed. There weren’t any tracks off the trail.” Weatherman passed the point where Harpel’s machine left the trail – without at that time noticing anything amiss. It was later when he doubled back, not finding Harpel ahead, that Weatherman noticed his friend off the trail, the snow mobile smashed. “It was exactly 3:04 p.m. when I found him,” Weatherman said. “It was clear and cold and beautiful at the time. Bill must have plunged off the trail a little before three o’clock. When I got there, there wasn’t anything I could do to revive him.” Harpel’s two sons, Craig, 11-1/2 and Curt, 8, were at the Alyeska Lodge with friends, awaiting their father’s return. Friends drove them back to Anchorage. Harpel competed in last year’s inaugural race and was a leading promoter of the event. He held entry ticket No. 1 in this year’s race. Elmer Brisbois, president of, the Anchorage Motor Mushers Club, sponsor of the race said today the club would retain the. No. 1 spot in the race for Harpel and might retire the number in honor of his memory in future races. Brisbois said the race committee would meet Tuesday night to consider a proposal that the race be named after Harpel. “He had been enthusiastic about snowmobiles from the first day he ever heard of them,” Weatherman said. At the time of his death, Weatherman said, Harpel was not wearing a protective helmet. “We had on face masks and down suits, but no gear to take a blow in case of a serious accident.” Harpel began his radio career in the early 1940s in Anchorage with KFQD.\n\nBill Harvey\n\nBill James\n\nBill Luckhurst- chief engineer, KTAC, 1967 and an instructor at LH Bates Vocational Technical Institute in Tacoma.

Government is there to serve you. “Who would have thought that after 25 years in music-radio that talk would be so much fun?” His secondary passion is repairing and rebuilding antique radios. “There’s something about that tradition and craftsmanship which is very comforting.

Turmoil was to be expected at Channel 13 in the ’60s and ’70s — the station was limited to showing scratchy black-and white movies and was near bankruptcy several times. Corcoran faced the black-and-white camera unflinchingly for two hours or more, with no props, few guests and a lot of opinions. Some of his eventual guests included Ralph Williams, auto salesman, State Senator Martin Durkin and former governor Albert D. Rosellini. “I was assembling a good package of movies,” Corcoran said at the time.. “I just took it easy until my movies could be added to the schedule.” He said he had TV rights to 182 movies. “Counter-programming, that’s what it is,” Corcoran said, “At 9 PM there is a carload of movies, so I’m going to talk. At 11 PM there are news programs galore, so I’m going to show my movies.” He bought airtime and sold commercials for his movies himself. Corcoran frequently hawked items from the B&I, a circus-themed shopping center. Corcoran had earlier been involved in promotions for the B&I, including during the time of Ivan the Gorilla.. Later, Corcoran became a candidate for the state House of Representatives. His Democratic opponent, an incumbent candidate, asked for “equal time” to compensate for Corcoran’s saturation appearances. Corcoran turned the show over to his wife Lee, but instead of following a threat of “appearing as a guest on his wife’s program”, Corcoran purchased a different hour of political time each weekday. New TV station owners ended the program.in 1972. He didn’t go to the Legislature, but he did stay active in South Sound politics, he co-owned a radio station in Pierce County, and then joined the Archdiocese of Seattle as a foundation development officer.

Lee (Bob) Hardwick worked at KVI for 21 straight years, starting as afternoon disk jockey when Gene Autry’s Golden West Broadcasting bought the station in the late 1950′s, and moved the studios to the Tower Building (7th and Olive) Through the 1960′s, 70′s and early 80′s, KVI was the dominant personality station, and morning man Robert E. Lee Hardwick became a true Seattle Legendary Figure, headlining over such talent as Buddy Webber, Jack Morton, Robert O. Smith, Michael O’Shea, Bill Taylor, Jack Spencer, Lou Gillette. Hardwick worked at KVI from 1959 to 1980. (He did transfer briefly to a Los Angeles sister-station KMPC in 1963.) On his KVI morning show, Hardwick would sometimes play only two or three records an hour. The rest of the time was filled with jokes, skits, ad-libbed advertisements and promotions for his latest escapade. In 1965, he piloted a tugboat to British Columbia to haul back Namu, the Killer Whale, for the Seattle Aquarium. He jet-skied 740 miles from Ketchikan to Seattle. In 1978 he was Billboard magazine’s Radio Personality of the Year. In 1989 he swam the Bremerton-Seattle ferry route. That same year, disgruntled with KVI’s decision to abandon music and switch to all-talk, he quit – walking out in the middle of the 8 a.m. newscast. After an unaccounted-for absence, he bounced around, first at a Tacoma station, then he worked mornings at KIXI-AM, Later he popped up at country-music KAYO. Several months passed. One Friday he called in sick and didn’t return. “Seattle radio is a bore and I have been boring right along with it,” he said at the time. His two disappearing acts were not publicity stunts, Hardwick told The Seattle Times, “but an emotional trauma in my life.” Then in 1987 the Seattle native left the medium altogether. He formed a company trying to transmit computer information over standard radio waves. He worked for a time as communication director at Pacific Institute and helped several local drug- and alcohol-rehabilitation centers market their programs. Said Hardwick, when asked once to sum himself up: “I’m a professional smartass. I love to tease people. I love to make people laugh. I’m a communicator.” In 1992 he was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was 61.\n\nBob Hards worked at KXLE-Ellensburg /Now baseball announcer for the Midland, Texas Rockhounds on KFZX 102.1 – Brian Lord, working the email machine, reaching out to the Boss Jocks from wayback. To Bob Hards, the question “I seem to remember you also worked at KTOL for a bit, but was that in sales?” Response: …I did go to KTOL directly from KXLE (John DiMeo hired me at both stations), but it wasn’t sales. I originally did mornings and sports and, later, moved to afternoons and did some PD work (and the sports). It’s far too long a story, but I got a radio job in baseball … almost by accident … in the final days at KTOL. Worked baseball in Bend, Oregon, for two years (1988-89) and Eugene for two (1990-91). Was hired by a team in Midland, Texas, in 1991 and have been here ever since, doing radio and publications…..

Left for Minneapolis in March 1975 for more money.\n\nBob Hovanes (a message from his wife): Tears fell from the sky on a rainy day on August 10, 2019 as my funny friend, partner and husband lost his long battle with lung disease. It was an epic battle for someone who had so much to live for and so many memories to cherish. Bob was born in Auckland, New Zealand to a family that grew to six rambunctious boys. They eventually settled in Seattle, and later moved to Huntsville, AL in 1964 for Boeing’s aerospace program. Bob completed High School and attended Auburn University, then returned to Seattle to attend the University of Washington, where he did on air work at their radio station. Bob became a local celebrity during the ’70 and ’80’s while co-hosting the afternoon, then mornings shows for KISW. After a successful career in video production, Bob moved to Bend, OR to host a local morning show there. In 1992, Bob moved back to Seattle and joined the morning show on KZOK where we began an on-air romance! Bob and I were married in 1999, and were blessed with twins in 2003. While awaiting their arrival, Bob built our dream home in Sammamish, then stayed home with the kids, while building a successful electronics business. Even after being off-air for many years, Bob’s voice or name were often recognized by fans who fondly remembered his time on the radio. Bob was a free spirit who traveled to San Francisco to be a hippy (he says he got there “too late”), hitchhiked across the country (with crazy adventures like being chased by a man with an ax), and was taken in by a family in Alberta to work on their farm after his clunker car broke down (which he sold for $1)! Good-natured fun included hiring an Elvis impersonator for our twins’ 1st birthday party, and wearing his brother-in-law’s shoes home from a party – twice! Bob’s kind spirit, humor, and love of family will be missed by many. Bob was predeceased by his parents John and Cecily, and is survived by wife Bev (me), children Aubrey and Chris, brothers Michael (Shari), Stephen, Peter (Carole), Ken (Cheryl), Bruce, and many nieces and nephews. A private service for Bob was held by family.\n\nBob Hudson – see Emperor Bob Hudson\n\nBob Joy – J Paul Damon/Steve Elliott/Bob Joy\n\nBob Kelly Started out at KEPR-TV Tri-Cities. “I kept going to the radio studio. Radio seemed so spontaneous to me. TV was, If you goofed, tape it again. No second chance in “Live” radio. Got a job at KALE top 40 while going to Columbia Basin CC. Went to Eastern Washington State. Graduated and worked one night at CKOK Penticton BC. (girlfriend lived there). Steve West called from KJRB and gave me a shot. Learned a lot in a short time from West, Charlie Brown, Joe Micheals, and others. Went to afternoons at 1310 KEIN Great Falls Montana. Went to Hollywood to learn how to be entertaining on stage. Learned a lot at the comedy store, and picked up part-time work at KRLA. Wanted to go home to Seattle. The late Roger Dale hired me at KUUU. Started 6-10pm and ended up 2-6 pm drive. SRO bought the station. They brought in Terry McDonald as PD. He brought in the late Kevin O’Brien for evenings. He called me in and asked “Have you every thought of doing country music?”. Why I asked? You have a regional dialect, are you from the south? I said yeh…White Center!! Down the road I went to Roger Dale, and the new KMPS. Worked part-time fill for a long time. Started country disco at the Roosevelt hotel in 1978. Great fun! Had a small syndicated show from there called “Country Disco Dance Party”. It was on the air in British Columbia, Idaho, Montana, and select stations in Washington. Did over 2 years at “The Rosey”. Canadians bought the hotel, and I went back to KMPS. I ended up being the last person to broadcast from the old KOL/KMPS harbor island facility. Never forget yelling at the people to stop banging the walls in before I cracked the “Mic”. Threw the switch around midnight, and off to the Pike Place Market KMPS went. From KMPS to KAYO’s last hurrah at country music. Unbeknownst to me, I was hired to eventually replace the 6-10 pm girl. She did alot of “heart wrenching love stuff” on her phone bits. That was the bosses story. She eventually was out, and I was in at 6-10 pm. The girl was Delilah Rene, now known as Delilah…yes her! We know that worked out pretty well. After 2 years KAYO brass realized the AM/FM combo at KMPS was unbeatable. So on the beach I went. Decided to get out of Dodge. Took afternoon drive/Assistant Promotion director job at WOW Omaha. Any station that upside down spells MOM can’t be bad. Did 2 years under former KMPS 3-7pm’er Chuck Urban. Almost went to WPLO Atlanta, when the late Lee Rogers (Formerly KMPS and others) called from KCBQ San Diego. Wow!! Sunshine, beaches, football, baseball, and hydroplanes. Did midday, and beat the main competition in 2 books. Worked for KKOS-AM (KVSD) doing midday oldies. In 87′ I jumped back to country music at KOWN the KOW. Promotion Director, and pm drive. Great time for 4 years. Got into mobile radio personality (Free money) John Maynard turned me on to that years earlier in Seattle. Fell in love with the car business did that on top of everything else. Lee Rogers called again, so off to KUPL Portland (now the Bull) overnights. Did 9 years there! The best radio experience of my life. Howard Stern went satalite, and CBS had major cutbacks. I got chopped, and walked away from the business. So I thought. Wingnut from the WOLF Seattle called, I did a few shifts, but I was working with Motorsports, and all he had was weekends available. The races are on weekends. That couldn’t work. So I now do motorsports (mostly hydroplanes) marketing and sales. I also have a small limo service in north Seattle. Semi-retired with GREAT memories of all the FUN broadcasting provided me. I always said, “How can you have this much fun, and still get paid!!!!!!!!!”\n\nBob Liddle, joined the KIXI-AM-FM air staff in 1961 and would stay with the station for 45 years. He had a booming doomsday-type news voice. A newsman, midday announcer and sometimes program director, Liddle was selected in the 1970s to team with Dean Smith on “News 90”, one of Seattle’s first all-news morning-drive programs. (During this time KIXI had a taken a CBS News affiliation, but lost it to KIRO-AM, then took on NBC News and had UPI and AP news.)

Just as likely, as Salty Dog Bob Salter, he would qualify as the first rock-and-roll jock in Seattle. Previously Salter was a studied, serious studio announcer who watched the broadcast world change in front of him, but still clinging to his studio piano as he did midday chatter with Dick Stokke. They watched new KJR owner Les Smith sweep away network entertainment like “Duffy’s Tavern” in favor of all-day music from phonograph records. And this was before Pat O’Day! Salter later moved to KVI. His last gig here was at KAYO in 1961. He later worked at Idaho stations.

Truly a Northwest pioneer in the field, he was one of the first African-American on-air personalities and the first with an engineering license. He and Elliot Brown (uncle to Chuck Bolland) also booked talent into a couple of taverns near Ft. Lewis. At that time the black GI’s had very limited places they could go (1950s) off post for social occasions. It was just after Ray Charles moved here from Florida. Acts also included Etta James, The Platters, etc. It wasn’t long and most of those acts were far too expensive for a Lakewood area tavern, but lesser known groups on tour had limited places to play in the Northwest so they could get them very reasonably. Summerise owned a record store in later years, he died in 2010.\n\nBob Summers [Wikstrom] KUUU jock, then years later was KXA Manager, now Soundworks Recording Studios in Redmond\n\nBob Throndsen retired after 34 years at KOMO (May 2012).

The two Utah beginners, Gordon Stephens (Ryan) and Gary Linton (Linton), were first teamed up at KRGO, Salt Lake City, in 1983 — to offer a “transition” from one to the other hosting the morning show. The team-up worked better than anyone expected and they soon jumped to Seattle, bringing along a variety of radio characters including the Rev. Billy Saltine and Benjamin Gaylord Ferry, who played off the natures of Ryan as conciliator, and Linton as a man close-to-outrage. After KAYO, they moved to mornings at KRPM-FM, then moved to a midday shift, At Pat O’Day’s KKMI and KXA they changed the team name to Ryan and Ryan, plunging into the joys and sorrows of automation. Thanks to the machine, Ryan and Ryan presented daily day-long shifts at contemporary-hits KYYX and six-hour weekend shifts at oldies KXA. Back to a real time midday shift at KVI, continuing as Ryan and Ryan, then a surprise shift to afternoon drive in 1989, as management pulled the 14-year afternoon-drive shift away from Jack Morton, moving him to middays. Iin 1991 they were at oldies KBSG. They spent three years at “K-Best” playing musical hits “almost remembered” by another of their characters, Delbert Dumm. Change in owners. Soon it was Bobby-Ryan-only on KRPM-FM. Linton visited stations in Florida and California, but returned to Seattle for some part-time political-talk experience.(See Gary Linton.) After radio, Bobby Ryan reverted to Gordon Stephens, selling real estate in Kent. (VOS2013)\n\nBOBBY SIMON came to work at KJR, 950 –, the first time, in 1964. His full name Robert Theodore Simon was sometimes used, even with a “Chipmunks” background. This first KJR stint was only three months long. (His previous air experience at KAYE, Puyallup, KORD, Pasco, and KXLY, Spokane, was not enough to keep up with high powered KJR jocks including the already legendary Larry Lujack.) Bobby got shifts at KEED, Eugene, then KISN, Portland, and WIFE, Indianapolis. He came back to Seattle for KOL and then bounced back to KJR where “B.S. for the Great Northwest” thrived — until he was pushed out “because Lan Roberts came back.” Into the ’70s “Ma and Pa Simon’s little boy” worked at KTAC, 850, then back to KOL, until he was replaced by an automation machine. Then to KTAC again. He finally achieved morning drive at KZOK-FM, and then KYYX, Seattle, in 1978. He did fill-in work at KNBQ, Tacoma, and KISW, Seattle. He also worked briefly for the Braiker Satellite service. In 1980 he was back at KTAC. Bobby Simon died in a car crash November, 2002. Bobby Simon was 65.\n\nBobby Wooten was disk jockey and program director on “country” KAYO 1150, from 1963 to 1975. He died of cancer Oct. 1 1998 in Arkansas. He was 70.\n\nHere are portions of a Seattle Times obit, by reporter Carole Beers\n\n“Bashful” Bobby Wooten actually was shy, says his wife. But when it came to publicity, he was “as bashful as a tank of barracuda,” said a colleague.\n\nHe had phony on-air feuds with fellow disk jockey Buck Ritchey. Wooten stayed two weeks in a camper suspended 15 feet above the station until listeners guessed what he’d packed along (a U.S. flag). And he lived six months in an apartment on the Space Needle, broadcasting from there.\n\n“Bobby was still getting cards from fans a few years ago,” said Mr. Wooten’s wife of 31 years, Patie Mae Wooten of Carlisle, Ark. And he was still getting royalty checks from “Goin’ Deer Huntin’,” a song he’d recorded. “It was only $5 or $18 a year. But he’d puff up and say, `They’re still likin’ it!’ ”\n\nWooten was twice voted program director of the year by Billboard magazine. He recorded local country artists like Bonnie Guitar on his G.R.C. label.\n\nHe had changed his name from Wootton to Wooten for “for professional reasons,” and although he had a long career as a disk jockey, he was a musician himself. He played guitar, banjo, fiddle and dobro. “Once at a dance they were playing, the drummer never showed,” said his wife. “So Bobby sat down at the drums and did pretty well, too.” The youngest of five children born to a family near Paris, Ark., he left school at age 14 and moved to San Francisco to work in the shipyards.\n\nHe began playing in a Western-swing band that got gigs on the radio. He eventually got up nerve to ask a radio-station manager to hire him as a DJ. When the manager burst out laughing, Wooten found a sponsor who would buy radio time only if Wooten did the show. In 1952 he became a DJ in San Jose. In the late 1950s he had a radio show in Salt Lake City. In 1963 he moved to Seattle as KAYO was changed its format from rock music to country. He welcomed country stars who were to play at Seattle Center, and emceed shows for artists such as Buck Owens, Marty Robbins and Johnny Cash.\n\n“Bashful” Bobby retired in 1975, and returned to Arkansas to raise cattle and chickens. “We had a hard life on that farm,” said his wife, “18 years before we got out. But it gave us experiences we’ll never forget.”\n\nBrad Dolbeer – staying true to the music, Brad was at KINK/Portland.

He remembers “the Great Flood of ’78” when the broadcast booth and radio towers were in a Snohomish County flood plain. “The towers were right outside the station, a two-stick directional array,: he recalls. “The water rose until it soaked the station foundation and was flooding the parking lot. “It was like being on a houseboat in a lake. Water was lapping at Tower No 1. Needless to say, the signal ground plane was completely thrashed.” He stayed on air all night because the next scheduled disk jockey could not get there. In the morning a Search and Rescue crew arrived — “in an aluminum boat during a thunderstorm!” He moved to “solid gold 16” KZAM-AM, firmly adopting the air name Brady Wright moved to KMPS-AM-FM in 1981 After a format-separation, Brady took the FM shift. He jumped to the competing country station KRPM, 106.1 Tacoma, then began parttime ventures including single years at KZOK-AM and staying through the name change to KQUL and back again. His final radio appearances were at “young country” KYCW-AM-FM from 1995 to 2002. “”Radio became a parttime endeavor for me,” he said. “I was also working as a trainer for several retail financial companies both before and after KYCW. “It’s somehow a natural progression from the communications business and is basically my dream job.” He has been a movie critic and wrote columns in motorcycle publications for three years and was a host on Hog Radio. “I continue to do freelance and commercials voice work. I’m registered with Voice123 . . . Broadcasting was a great bridge to many doors in my career.

He weathered the 1962 Columbus Day storm driving from the station’s rickety location on Roosevelt Way to the Seattle World’s Fair. He also worked for KASY, 1220 Auburn, KTAC 850 Tacoma, and KBES, Bellevue. He also worked for KIRO-AM twice — first when it was atop Queen Anne Hill preparing a move to Broadcast House on Third Avenue. In 1968 he was lured away to Los Angeles’s KNX, the CBS-owned all-news station, getting nationwide exposure for his reports on the Robert Kennedy assassination. To preserve his family life, he returned to KIRO but a year later was lured back to Los Angeles to work for the Westinghouse all-news station KFWB, His family stayed in Seattle. He covered grisly murder trials, got trapped in a forest fire, had F.B.I. agents pull guns on him while running down an alley to get back to the station to file his story on a bank robbery. Two years was enough! The Nebraska-born newsman headed back to the Northwest. He became news director at KASY, 1220 Auburn, a quiet little mom n’ pop station in the swampland of “Little Detroit of the West.” Scripts and notes from his daily KASY news briefs, from 1975 to 1976, have been donated to the White River Valley Museum in Auburn. Near retirement he worked for a Bothell telephone-security company and filled-in as occasional announcer at KPLU, Tacoma. He had a long and productive retirement.

He came from KYA, San Francisco, after a dustup over his music choices. (Elvis Presley records were not acceptable programming on this radio station. Vanderhoof demurred. He played Elvis over and over, until the engineer cut the sound, The station manager apologized for content “not in good taste.”) Vanderhoof was on his way to Seattle, joining a MOR-personality staff including Frosty Fowler, Al Cummings, Jim French. Vanderhoof soon paired with Cummings to raise money for elephants at the Woodland Park Zoo. After 13 years at KING, Bruce moved to KOMO-AM where he held down the morning-drive show. By 1973, he was midday at KTNT-AM (and sometimes KTNT-FM). (VOS, 2014)\n\nBryan Johnson, a Vashon Island boy with British background, started as newsman at KAPA, Raymond, a half century ago.

Richey fronted the KVI country swing band, The K-Six Wranglers His “radio feud” with KVI’s morning man Harry Long lasted 20 fun years. When new owners turned KVI into a personality station (introducing to Seattle such names a Jerry Dexter,and Bob Hardwick) and naming Ritchey “operations director,” it was a no-brainer to change horses. At age 15 the young Buck had began a cross country journey from Missouri — eight years to get to country-music KVI (then licensed as a Tacoma station).. When KAYO was changing from top-40 KRSC to it’s country format. Richey became the keystone to country music in Seattle. He recorded four songs, including a family campfire song — actually a spoken poem by Mildred Plew Meigs “Only the Moon Man Knows.” Buck Richey was on the air 32 years in Seattle/Tacoma. He died December 23, 1973.\n\nBuck Owens was a disk jockey at KAYE-1450, Puyallup, before his Columbia Records recording career took off. Born in near-poverty in Texas, he moved to Bakersfield, CA,.in the late 1950s and after an early record success gave him enough money, he purchased a third interest in the daytime Puyallup station. He played records and occasionally brought in his band for live performances, sometimes including visiting housewife-performers Loretta Lynn and Bonnie Guitar. Owens also hosted his own country music show on Tacoma’s Channel 11, KTNT-TV, introducing such performers as Willie Nelson and Ferlin Husky. Owens later moved back to Bakersfield and took the tiger by the tail, building a multimillion-dollar media empire performing, writing songs and operating several California & Arizona radio stations. He made national TV appearances on the “Jimmy Dean Show” and eventually his own CBS-TV show, “Hee Haw,” which he co-hosted with Roy Clark. He died in 2006, age 76. – VOS2012\n\nBuck Wade – KMPS\n\nHayden (Bud) Blair – Before professional sports took root in the Puget Sound area, local schools drew the allegiance of fans. For those who followed teams from Puyallup and Pacific Lutheran University in the 1970s, their source for news and play-by-play action was Bud Blair. Hayden (Bud) Blair created an atmosphere that made the athletes and their fans feel like their game was the most important game in the area every time he took the mic. Unfortunately, not only Blair’s career, but his life, was cut too short. He died a couple hours after broadcasting a PLU basketball game at the College of Idaho in Caldwell on February 5, 1978 two weeks before his 37th birthday. He had gone to dinner with Ed Anderson, PLU coach, and Gary Wusterbarth, his color man on the broadcast. Blair collapsed in his motel room. Bud was born in Tacoma in 1941 and graduated from Stadium High. He started the Blair Sports Network around 1966 and began freelancing as a broadcaster and photographer. Later, he was part owner and then full owner of KUPY 1450 AM in Puyallup. From 1970 until his death, he called the action for PLU basketball and football games. Bud was noted for injecting his personality into his broadcasts. It was not enough just to say scored, who made two yards and who made the tackle. “Holy Humptulips” and “He’s covered like a Tukwila fog,” were a staple of most Blair broadcasts. There were other favorites including, “In the popcorn machine,” and “Down the elevator shaft,” along with, “It’s a 20-footer that goes 18, five-star stump floating barn burner” and “goodness gracious, Agnes,” that made his broadcast unique. In the spring and summer Blair turned his attention to the unlimited hydroplane circuit. He traveled to the sites of the hydro series taking photos and calling race action. One of his most famous hydro photos captured Mickey Remund catapulting from his boat as it flipped mid-air. (CHBCenter, 2014)\n\nBud Harrington [KBLE]\n\nBuddy Webber was afternoon personality at KVI more than 40 years ago, but is still remembered. He frequently waged a friendly battle with morning host Bob Hardwick and participated in memorable, sometimes zany station promotions. Among them, Webber and Hardwick raced around the world, in opposite directions, to publicize the 1962 Seattle Worlds Fair, “Hardwick beat me,” he said years later, giving his usual explanation: “But then he always beat me because he cheated.” Born Justus Buddy Webber, he started his own Big Band in the late 1940s. He played trumpet; his wife was featured singer. He worked at radio stations in Indianapolis, Omaha and San Francisco. He came to Seattle after Gene Autry bought the station in 1959. After his long stint at KVI, Webber moved to KOMO-TV, where he hosted a morning television show that bore his name and then an afternoon radio program on KOMO-AM. Webber left broadcasting, frankly at the peak of his career, to devote time to a Jehovah’s Witness ministry, moving to the Canary Islands off Morocco. He returned to the states, lived in Rhode Island but returned to Seattle in 1997 to start a business. He died of pulmonary fibrosis in 2005. He was 82.\n\nBurl Barer – TRUE CRIME author, former Seattle radio legend and can still hit the post, in radio terminology. Who knew Burl Barer was bound for fame and glory in the writing business? His on-air stunts at the feuding rockers KJR and KOL is engrained in Seattle’s audio memory. Barer could be pushed to being a screamer, gasping and panting in anticipation for the next record or recoiling from a news item. Barer started at KUJ and KTEL in hometown Walla Walla, moved to Seattle for an overnight gig at r&b station KYAC. From there he got afternoons at KJR and bounced between KOL-AM, KOL-FM and KJR again –, with remarkably brief stints at KIRO and KZOK. 1972, Barer got a commission to adapt the Val Kilmer movie “The Saint” into a novel. That led to a franchise of new authorized novels based on Leslie Charteris’ urbane crime- solver Simon Templar. A second movie screenplay was completed and in 2011 still was being “shopped around” (without any control by Barer) as a TV movie, TV special or TV series.) Barer has also written several “true crime” books and mystery novels. Barer, who once touted himself as a “distance reader” (psychic/mentalist), appears in his own true crime book, “Body Count,” as “the psychic/mentalist/true crime author Jeff Reynolds.” In his Seattle radio days he won praise for producing punchy commercials for national pop- music performers. That lead to forming an internet advertising company and a TV production company focusing on Eastern Washington. Returning to Walla Walla in 1990s, Barer teamed with Thomas D. Hodgins to launch several radio stations for Hodgins broadcast company, with Barer handling programming and on-air talent. He is host of “True Crime Confessions” on the American Horrors channel, a pay-tier TV venture from FilmOn and contributes to “Outlaw Radio” an internet audio service. Barer has two grown children, Anea Barer and Jordan Barer. Barer’s brother Stan is an attorney in Seattle and his sister Jan Curran, who died in 2010, was a journalist with The Desert Sun and author of two books.
