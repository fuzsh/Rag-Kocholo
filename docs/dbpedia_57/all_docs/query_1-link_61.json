        "text": "I remember listening to EOR on WGRX in Baltimore from 1984 to 1986. I absolutely loved that station. It was sort of a mellow classic rock format with some newer soft rock album tracks thrown in. I heard Bruce Cockburn's \"Maybe the Poet\" on that station and have been a fan of Bruce's music ever since.\n\nIt really was an early Prototype for the AAA format. It's unfortunate that is was on a signal 30 miles outside of Baltimore (actually Westminster, MD) so it primarily covered a rural area and not the Baltimore metro area. I was fortunate enough to live in an area that could hear the signal quite well. I actually lived closer to the transmitter than the station's studios which were in the World Trade Center in Baltimore at the time.\n\nI also heard the format on WKGR in West Palm Beach while on business travel. As I recall it had almost a completely different playlist than WGRX, but still followed a similar concept. If I remember correctly the GR in both stations stood for Gourmet Rock, but WGRX never used that moniker. I think WKGR did.\n\nThe consultant that created the format is John Sebastian and I contacted him about a year ago and told him how fondly I remembered WGRX, and WBMW another station in Washington, DC that he consulted. After doing EOR he went on to be a pioneer one of the so called NAC format stations that played New Age, Lite Jazz, and Soft Rock Album tracks. WBMW lasted for about a year and many of the DJ's from WGRX moved to WBMW.\n\nKevin Malvey was the morning man on both stations and the last I heard was in the Boston area. Both WGRX and WBMW were great stations, but WGRX was the best.\n\nThe closest thing to WGRX that you can hear today is Sirius/XMs the Bridge, but of course the Bridge doesn't play new music. The thing that drew me to WGRX was the Mellow Classic Rock like The Bridge, but the thing that kept me listening was the new music that the station introduced me to like Bruce Cockburn. In this way it was much like The Spectrum on Sirius/XM today, or even WXPN, or KCRW.\n\nluckenbg said:\n\nI remember listening to EOR on WGRX in Baltimore from 1984 to 1986.

In this way it was much like The Spectrum on Sirius/XM today, or even WXPN, or KCRW.\n\nIf WGRX Westminster from early 1984 to 1986 was indeed considered an \"EOR\", then yeah! I was eighteen and a half when they first signed on, was getting a bit sick of the monotony of top-40 and boy DO I remember that station! Like you I loved it and I miss it to this day! With an innovative albeit somewhat mellow playlist, It was undoubtedly probably THE best station I've heard! Unfortunately the FM converter I had in the car couldn't pick that station up, so the only way I could listen was at home. Either way, it was one of the only stations that I would listen to for extended periods.\n\nBelieve it or not, for a short while in late 1985, maybe even into early '86, WYRE out of Annapolis played some of this kind of music. IMNSHO they should've stayed with it; especially after WGRX went classic rock.\n\nNow, I also remember when WBMW went from top-40 to a watered down version of 'EOR' in 1987, but IMNSHO that station was musically inept at best; at least when they first signed on. When they went to what I'll call a 'new age blend' about that summer, then I gained some respect for them. Of course it didn't last long and WBMW went to some form of classic rock about a year later when they picked up Howard Stern.\n\nWhile on the subject of WBMW/WJFK, I remember in 1991 when they went through the 'overhaul' in their format, Cerphe had a 'progressive' show in the evenings which lasted for about a year. I would enjoy listening to that on the way home from the University of Baltimore despite being on AM (1300) up there. It was probably the closest thing to what the old WGRX was, but again it wasn't to last and that show would then change to a sort of 'smooth jazz blend'.\n\nWhile the closest things that we now have to the old 'EOR' would either have to be WRNR or WTMD, particularly the latter; I still feel that those stations don't have quite the innovation of the old WGRX. If these stations would be willing to 'tweak' the format or if someone else was willing to show up on the scene with a similar musical makeup, I'd listen (even if it was on AM!) but that's me.\n\nManny Michaels said:\n\nEOR was John Sebastian's format and a precursor to AAA. His theory was that if you took the best from rock and AC with an occasional smooth jazz track, you could peel off some disenfranchised listeners. He kept his rock on the softer side and the presentation was AC. Unfortunately, it was a tough format to market in the industry. GMs and owners were a spooked by the notion of being \"eclectic.\" Most of his clients had deficient signals and the format languished. If I'm not mistaken he first launched in West Palm or there abouts in 1983. 'GRX in Baltimore debuted in early '84. I remember KESI in San Antonio was EOR for awhile until it flipped to AC in 1987.\n\nLet me qualify all of the above with if memory serves me. I am a trifle burned out after all.\n\nThat sounds like what KTCZ (Cities 97) in Minneapolis was when they launched back in 1983, and I'm sure there were quite a few other stations that were influenced by what they did. A new owner came in, ditched the poorly-rated country format and installed his own quirky format based mostly on what he liked listening to. Essentially, a mix of classic rock (the Steely Dan/Jackson Browne/CSNY \"yacht rock\" stuff), tamer new wave (Roxy Music, Squeeze, et. al.), newer light alt-rock (remember Prefab Sprout?), new age and smooth jazz. And the station is still around today, albiet in a Clear Channel-style watered-down form. I tuned it in via the IHR app a few weeks ago and thought about how boring, bland and wimpy they had gotten over the years. Only thing they've really got going for them now is that they have really good jocks."
