        "text": "We'll begin this week's report in NEW YORK's state capital, where the departure of Tele-Media brought another new format to the FM dial this week.\n\nWe told you last week about the fate of the Tele-Media stations that were spun off to Ed Levine's Galaxy, with WKLI (94.5 Ravena) becoming \"94 Rock\" and WABY (1400 Albany) being prepped for sale; we can add this week that Levine's other new purchase, WHTR (93.5 Corinth) is off the air with transmitter problems unrelated to its proposed move to 93.7 in Scotia.\n\nThis week, the attention shifts to the stations Tele-Media sold to Pamal Broadcasting: while WKBE (100.3 Warrensburg) keeps running automated with the \"Point\" hot AC format for the Glens Falls area, WCPT (100.9 Albany) ended its stunt simulcast with CHR WFLY (92.3 Troy) at 4 PM Friday (Nov. 2) to go standards as \"Magic.\"\n\nThe change means Albany listeners can pick from no fewer than three standards stations; in addition to Magic, Crawford runs the format on 50 kilowatt WPTR (1540) and Ernie Anastos runs it on \"the Moon,\" WUAM (900 Saratoga Springs) and WMVI (1160 Mechanicville). NERW wonders whether Pamal will try to get the WABY calls, long associated with the format, when and if 1400 drops them.\n\nPamal is holding on to another station nearby, much to its own surprise. It turns out that Joseph Isabel's IZ Communications (which owns WCSS in Amsterdam) won't follow through on its planned purchase of WIZR (930 Johnstown), the AM that Pamal picked up when it bought Johnstown's WSRD (104.9) and moved it to Albany a few years back. IZ will lose its $10,000 deposit on the purchase; in the meantime, Pamal brings Jeff Weber back to the market to run WIZR. Weber had been the owner of WCSS when IZ bought it; he's been working down at Baltimore's WZBA as general sales manager.\n\nSome familiar voices were missing from Entercom's Buffalo stations on Halloween morning, but it wasn't a prank: the cluster let six people go on Tuesday (Oct. 30). On WTSS (Star 102.5), the casualties were morning co-hosts Joe Thomas and Pam Bunch, production director Mark Krunowski and night jock Dan Rinelli; Roger Christian is back in mornings for now at 102.5 (a spot he last held in the '80s when the station was WBEN-FM), with Sue O'Neil filling in on his usual 10-3 midday slot.\n\nAcross the hall at WGR (550), the sports station lost morning producer Doug Young and midday co-host Anne Burke. Young also did production at WBEN (930), which suffered its own cutbacks last month when morning host Bill Lacy was fired as he returned from vacation.\n\nThat leaves CHR WKSE (98.5 Niagara Falls) and AM also-rans WWWS (1400) and WWKB (1520) escaping the cutbacks...for now. Stay tuned.\n\nFrom Syracuse comes word that Skip Clark has been promoted to music director at country giant WBBS (104.7 Fulton); Clear Channel market OM Rich Lauber takes on the PD reins for B104.7 last held by Rick Jordan, who's now up in Maine.\n\nDown in Binghamton, we see that WLTB (101.7 Johnson City) and W273AB (102.5 Endicott) have been granted their licenses to cover for their transmitter moves; WLTB is now on Ingraham Hill with most of the other big Binghamton FMs, while W273AB has moved from Ingraham to the old 101.7 site out on the west side of Endicott.\n\nFrom New York City comes word that WNBC (Channel 4) and WPIX-TV (Channel 11) are the latest to move from the temporary TV site at Alpine, N.J. to the Empire State Building. The word from NERW readers out on Long Island, though, is that neither signal is getting out as well as WCBS-TV (Channel 2) and WABC-TV (Channel 7), which are apparently the only VHF stations running full power from Empire.\n\nIf our records are correct, the latest moves leave only WNYW (Channel 5), WWOR-TV (Channel 9), WNET (Channel 13) and WNJU (Channel 47) using the Alpine tower, with WPXN (Channel 31) using a site in West Orange, N.J. until it can join the others at a new permanent site.\n\nIn the meantime, the folks at WCBS-TV (Channel 2) are still remaining a step ahead of the competition when it comes to backup sites. WCBS-TV was the only TV station at the World Trade Center to retain a full-power backup at Empire, which paid off immeasurably when channel 2 ended up with New York's non-cable audience to itself after September 11.\n\nNow we see that WCBS-TV has filed to put an auxiliary transmitter atop the Viacom building at 1515 Broadway, just a stone's throw from the Conde Nast building where Clear Channel's backup facilities are housed. The roof at 1515 Broadway used to house a backup antenna for WLTW (106.7), later reused for Infinity's WCBS-FM (101.1) and WNEW (102.7). WCBS-TV wants to join them there with a 1000 watt visual ERP, 200 watt audio, horizontally polarized backup transmitter...just in case. We expect other New York TVs might follow suit, this time.\n\nOut on Long Island, WLUX (540 Islip) still wants to add a second tower for daytime directional operation, but with a bit more power this time. The nostalgia station, presently running 250 watts nondirectional, already holds a CP to go to 320 watts DA-D (retaining its present 204 watts nondirectional at night); now it's been granted a boost to 500 watts DA-D, 204 watts ND-N.\n\nNew call alert: As Univision prepares to relaunch the former USA Broadcasting stations with its new Telefutura network, it has new calls lined up as well. In New York, WHSE-TV (Channel 68 Newark N.J.), whose antenna is now the very highest point in the city (at the top of the Empire mast), becomes WFUT(TV), while Long Island's WHSI (Channel 67 Smithtown) becomes WFTY, calls last seen in Washington, D.C. on what's now WBDC (Channel 50)."
