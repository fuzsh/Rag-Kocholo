Still 70 years is a good run for any radio station.\n\nIf it provides a music mix, or even a genre of music, unavailable on the area's other Spanish-language stations, then yes, it's a station the area needs. As David reminds us so often, \"Spanish\" is not a format, and there are many ways to program Spanish-language stations, just as in English. If the new owner of WFAX wanted to install an English-language alternative rock or classic R&B format, would you be asking if the area needs \"another English station\"?\n\nIf it provides a music mix, or even a genre of music, unavailable on the area's other Spanish-language stations, then yes, it's a station the area needs.

From the article looks like they'll be doing \"Spanish CHR\", which 2 or 3 larger signals in the market already do. If the money is there go for it.

I know thatâ€™s not the point youâ€™re trying to make, but it can come off that way.\n\nThe internet does make it difficult, but itâ€™s just something to keep in mind.
