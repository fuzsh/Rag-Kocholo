        "text": "MusicMaster Expands Development Team\n\nMusicMaster Scheduling is expanding its development department with the addition of Jerry Parker as Director of Technical Services. Among his other roles, Jerry will create and expand relationships with MusicMaster’s real-time integration partners and increase adoption of the MusicMaster Nexus API. Jerry will also oversee deployment and implementation of MusicMaster Client-Server (CS), MusicMaster’s top-tier product for large radio enterprises that manage data and processing on a central server with remote client access.\n\nA seasoned technical professional with over 26 years in the industry, Jerry was most recently Vice President of Operations at Presslaff Interactive Revenue (PIR) and was directly responsible for their Dat-e-Base suite of applications for Radio, Television and Print industries. Jerry provided operational strategies, goals, and action plans with concentrations in applications, database development, server farms, and IT support teams. Under Jerry's leadership, PIR grew to become one of the largest providers of First-Person Databases and Marketing Strategies providing services to Media Businesses worldwide.\n\nPrior to his work with PIR, Jerry started his career in technical services as an engineer in 1986 and served several companies such as Creative Data Planning, Bay Broadcasting, and Reservation Ranch. Focusing on strategic business development plans, he helped grow businesses by implementing technological platforms and equipment strategies to improve business efficiency. In 1999, he joined the executive team at Jones Radio Networks as Director of Engineering and managed their Day-Part and distribution technical platforms, delivering programming such as Delilah, Lia, Marie Osmond, and other talent to affiliate stations across the U.S. and Canada.\n\nScott Wirt, MusicMaster VP and CTO, commented: “Jerry is an industry veteran with a wealth of broadcast engineering and IT experience. I'm excited to see him helping our customers overcome challenges and finding the best ways to integrate MusicMaster into their workflows, as well as working with our industry partners to create great new MusicMaster experiences.\"\n\nGenius Tour Continues on March 13 in Dallas\n\nThis past month, over 60 programmers took part in the MusicMaster Genius Day Tour during our stops in Atlanta, Washington DC and Cleveland. Our final stop for Spring will be in Dallas on March 13 at the MusicMaster headquarters. This meeting of the minds will include Founder/President Joe Knapp and our Chief Developer/CTO Scott Wirt.

The mission is to carry on good ideas and to continuously develop radio for its listeners. Together with our international partners, Top of Mind Media Branding from the Netherlands, BVMedia from Italy and SwissMediaPartners from Switzerland, the ON AIR team from Germany will be present at the MusicMaster Meeting Point and ready to show you the latest software features and answer your questions. You are sincerely welcome to join us at the Austria Center Vienna. Contact office@onair.de for more information or to make an appointment.\n\nDavid Clementina\n\nProgram Director/Sales Manager at Curom Broadcasting - Curacao, Netherlands Antilles\n\nDavid Clementina is the program director and sales manager at Curom Broadcasting in Curacao. He has been working in radio since he was a kid, having started a radio show in 2002 at 15 years old. He began working full-time in radio in 2010. Curom Broadcasting operates 3 stations in 3 different formats: news talk, AC and Hip-Hop. They began using Musicmaster for their Hip-Hop station 88Rocksorsou in 2017, and after a very successful implementation, plan to expand MusicMaster to their AC station.\n\nDavid comments: \"Having an overview of all the music and knowing when and how the songs are playing is very important to us. MusicMaster allows us to do just that. MusicMaster changes the way I do programming and has resulted in one of the most innovative things we have done at our radio station. After wandering around the MusicMaster booth for years, I decided to give it a go last year. I got tired of programming manually with cards and difficult schedule schemes. MusicMaster allows us to change the way we program our radio station. We were able to import and implement all of the clocks and rotations we did manually in the past. The integration has been very good. One of the best features for us is the integration of the commercial logs into the playlists. Before MusicMaster we used to print our logs, and now they are imported automatically into our playlist, eliminating printing. This results in a lot of savings for our company.\n\n\"There is not one thing that MusicMaster can’t do. Searching for particular songs in the database is made easy, and the schedules are clear. At the end of the year, you can also see the airplay of the songs. This made our Top 100 countdown much easier to compile last December. The beauty of MusicMaster is also that you can play around with it and try different things to see how they work for you at any time. After the experiments, I always look at the data to see how my changes have affected the rotation.\"\n\nShane Finch\n\nVP of Business Relations - Ocala, FL\n\nLike many of our MusicMaster clients, Shane started his on-air radio career at a young age and was fortunate to spend the next 35 years working with some of America’s finest media professionals. During that time, he was a jock and PD at a total of 13 stations in Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin and Florida. Shane says, “I was empowered by others to be rewarded with many professional accolades and several “PD of the Year” awards. It was a dream come true!” In 2013, Shane joined MusicMaster and now works as the VP/Business Relations. Among his variety of duties, he manages and protects the relationship between MusicMaster and our many valued music schedulers. He also works to insure a consistent and positive relationship with our Nexus integration partners. In addition, he is instrumental in the planning and execution of MusicMaster’s trade show appearances, Genius Days and other public events.\n\nShane says: “There are many advantages and blessings associated with working with MusicMaster, but engaging with a highly skilled and creative international team is infectious. MusicMaster is a radio platform provider owned, operated and powered by radio people.” Shane’s encouragement for people in the radio industry is to “be a thought leader. The thoughts and words you use either build-up or tear down those you’re involved with. Also, realize how truly privileged you are to have the platform you’ve been given. Use the power of that platform very wisely.”\n\nWhen not working, Shane enjoys spending time with his wife, kids and grandchildren (pictured below). He’s heavily involved in serving at First Baptist Church in Ocala, Florida. He also loves running the beautiful Florida roads through thoroughbred horse country. You can connect with Shane on Facebook or find him on Twitter as @FinchHawkeye."
