AFFILIATED WITH LOS ANGELES AMUSEMENT FEDERATION, CALIFORNIA STATE THEATRICAL FEDERA- TION, CALIFORNIA STATE FEDERATION OF LABOR. AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR. 3 4 Vol. 1 HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA FEBRUARY, 1929 No. 1 \"Capita/ is the fruit of labor, and could not exist if labor had not first existed. Labor, therefore, deserves much the higher consideration\" — Abraham Lincoln Studio Agreement Briefly, the basic Studio agreement entered into by and between the Unions and certain Moving Picture Producing Companies in November, 1926, and extended November, 1928, for an additional period of three years, provides for the establishment of a Board of Arbitration, composed of five representatives of each of the parties, which shall hear and deter- mine questions arising between the Unions and Producers. The Unions referred to in this agreement are : 1. The I. A. T. S. E. & M. P. M. O. 2. The International Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators and Paper- hangers of America. 3. United Brotherhood of Carpen- ters and Joiners of America. 4. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. 5. American Federation of Musi- cians. Local No. 659 is an integral part of the I. A. T. S. E. & M. P. M. O. and cannot by any stretch of the imagination be separated from the parent body. This Local is as much a part of the contract here referred to as is any Union therein specifically referred to. The obligations imposed upon the I. A. T. S. E. & M. P. M. O. by this document are imposed upon the International Photograph- ers, and likewise the benefits con- ferred thereby accrue to Local No. 659. It has the legal effect of mak- ing us as much a part of the contract as though it were signed by the elected officers of this Local. The Rules of Procedure adopted by the above referred to committees (Continued on Page 4) The International Pho- tographer, while primarily the house organ of Local No. 659, enjoys the distinction of being placed monthly in the hands of 1,000 photographic workers of the Motion Picture Industry. The members of this Local, together with those of our sis- ter Locals, No. 644 of New York City and No. 666 of Chicago, represent the entire personnel of photographers now engaged in professional produc- tion of motion pictures in the United States. This condition renders the International Photographer a voice of an ENTIRE CRAFT covering a field that reaches from coast to coast across the nation. Radical Demands Available Attention is again called to the \"Out of Work Book\" maintained in the office of Local No. 659. When out of work come to the office and sign the book. Your name is then called for the first position available in the order of the date of your application. However, after signing the book, should you accept work without help from the Local office you must call in, cancelling your name immediately, so the Business Representative at all times knows just who is available. The \"Work Book\" is arranged in classifications from first cameramen to assistant cameramen. It repre- sents the finest employment agency ever available to cameramen of the Motion Picture Industry. This is the caption of Section 1, Article 4, on the subject of STRIKES AND LOCKOUTS, in the By- Laws of the International Alliance. It would be well for those few members of Local No. 659 who are urging drastic methods to bring about an adjustment of present conditions to study this particular paragraph. It would be well for those mem- bers, who have sincerely at heart the furtherance of a just and equitable settlement of the differences between the cameramen and their employers to report to the local office the names of those members who are agitating and urging the adoption of \"red\" methods in the establishment of bet- ter conditions. There is only one initial method of procedure in the settlement of the differences which may now exist be- tween cameramen and employer, viz., through the channel already estab- lished by the International Alliance, as described elsewhere in this issue. The great machine of the \"I. A.\" has been in operation for many years and its methods are JUST, FIRM and EFFECTIVE. We know that its policies are acceptable to the great majoritv of the members of Local No. 659. This Local has submitted its prob- lems to our International President. These problems have been supported with written arguments to be aug- mented by oral arguments upon the arrival of the Local's committee and our International Representative in New York. We have been assured that President Canavan will use every means to effect this meeting the first part of February.

Federation Report In the report of the California State Theatrical Federation for Jan- uary, Brother Anthony Noriega says in part: \"The cameramen of Hollywood advise a 100 per cent organization west of the Mississippi. They are to be congratulated for their quick and successful campaign of organiza- tion.\" He also calls attention to all locals that the time is short in which to present bills to the State Legislature. He says: \"The time for the introduction of Legislative matters at the State Legis- lature is at hand, therefore it be- hooves locals who may have bills to present to forward same at once, with any data at hand to strengthen your proposition. Our State Executive Committee has selected the writer to represent our Federation during the coming sessions of the Legislature. Send in your propositions at once.\" o Agreement Between Locals No. 644 and No. 659 The Executive Boards of Locals 659 and 644 have signed the follow- ing contract, which embodies the principle of home rule and jurisdic- tional rights. This Agreement entered into be- tween Local No. 644, International Alliance of Theatrical -Stage Em- ployees and Moving Picture Machine Operators of the United States and Canada, of the City of New York, State of New York, and Local No. 659, International Alliance of Thea- trical Stage Employees and Moving Picture Machine Operators of the United States and Canada, of the City of Los Angeles, State of Cali- fornia. WITNESSETH: \"That It Is Mutually Agreed that the first cameraman and his assistant shall have the absolute right of en- tering a foreign jurisdiction to pho- tograph location and studio scenes on a production originating in the do- mestic jurisdiction. That the jurisdictional boundaries of the aforesaid Locals shall be as follows: The jurisdiction of Local No. 644 shall extend from the At- lantic coast line to the Mississippi river, in the United States and into the Dominion of Canada, as shown on the map which is hereto attached and made a part of this Agreement. The jurisdiction of Local No. 659 shall extend from the Pacific coast line to the boundary lines established between Idaho and Montana, Idaho and Wyoming, Utah and Wyoming, Utah and Colorado, and Arizona and New Mexico, in the United and into the Dominion of Canada, as shown on the aforementioned map. The territory in the United States and in Canada, between the afore- mentioned jurisdictional boundaries, is a neutral zone into which a com- plete photographic staff from either jurisdiction may operate under the Local's Constitution and By-Laws of the jurisdiction in which said pro- duction originated. Should a producing unit be de- sirous of carrying into a foreign juris- diction a cameraman or camera- men, other than the first cameraman from the domestic jurisdiction, said cameraman or cameramen shall first obtain permission from the Local of said foreign jurisdiction before enter- ing same. That the photographic staff, as de- fined by the respective Constitution and By-Laws of the foreign Local, as of present date, shall be completed by photographers supplied from the home local of the said foreign jurisdiction. That for the purpose of receiving the applications of incoming, or pros- pective, members of the United ■States shall be divided by the line 100 degrees West Longitude; Local No. 659 holding jurisdiction West of the line and Local No. 644 receiving applications of applicants residing East of the line. In the event of vacancies in either jurisdiction where the Local is un- able to furnish the men required, they shall call upon each other's Local for men to fill same. This Agreement shall not expire unless mutually agreed upon by both aforesaid parties. o Employment Notice It behooves every member to see that business managers and assistant directors of producing companies are informed of the fact that the office of Local No. 659 maintains its own employment bureau. Business managers desirous of em- ploying cameramen, still photograph- ers or assistant cameramen, can save time and be certain of results by call- ing the business office, HEmpstead 1128, where a classified list of avail- able camera workers is maintained. o Brother Paul Perry reports work- ing on sound production at United Artists studio. February, 1929 The INTERNATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER Tin 'Daddy' Dale Goes to Texas \"Daddy\" Dale, well known to members of Local No. 659, left last week for Texas where he will arrange for an organization campaign that is to be launched in the Mid-Conti- nental oil fields. Most of the workers there are understood to be working ten and twelve hours per day, with no incli- nation upon the part of the companies to give a reduction, or bring the pay up commensurate with such ungodly hours of toil. The thousands of friends, in and out of the Labor movement, wish \"Daddy\" Dale all possible success and hope for him one of the most successful of labor revival meetings, and a thorough spreading of the gos- pel. Trade unionism will be glad to welcome him back when President Green and the Oil Workers are readv to let him come home. Vest Pocket Movies Brother Andre Barlatier dropped into the office the other day and showed us an ingenious little device he now has on the market called the \"Filmoscope.\" It is designed for viewing stereoscopic photographs printed on three-foot strips of film. These strips of pictures Andre has aptly dubbed Filomgrams. \"This is not a moving picture,\" Andre explained, \"although it is made on movie film.\" The device, which is so compact that it readily slips into the vest pocket, permits 24 stereoscopic pairs of views on each \"Filmogram.\" Those Andre has prepared are of famous movie stars actually at work on various productions in the differ- ent studios. The pictures may be changed in rapid succession by a clever drop-pin device. It shows pictures in all the roundness and vitality obtained by the illusion of the third dimension. Brother Barlatier is now photo- graphing a new series of interesting subjects which will be added to his rapidly increasing library available for purchasers of \"Filmoscopes.\" The device is an inexpensive nov- elty and the additional \"Filmograms\" may be obtained at a nominal charge. o Brother Victor Milner is photo- graphing the sound production \"Wild Party,\" with Clara Bow as the star. Dorothv Arzner is directing. TREMONT FILM LABORATORIES CORPORATION S 823-829 Seward Street Hollywood California Line Up With <]g> Lamps and Go Ahead MOLE-RICHARDSON, Inc. STUDIO LIGHTING EQUIPMENT 941 N. SYCAMORE AVENUE HOLLYWOOD, CALIF. Four The INTERNATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER February, 1929 Vitacolor An Achievement About twenty-five of us went over to Brother Max DuPont's Vitacolor studio several evenings ago to see what this new color process really looked like. To say that we were pleasantly surprised would be a mild statement. We were astounded. These Vita- color films are certainly more than moving pictures ; they are the nearest approach to life possible to be thrown upon the screen. Max showed us some close-ups so real that we forgot momentarily they were pictures. Vitacolor actors ac- tually appear to live and breathe, but they do not have to talk to do so. Just color ; a color so pure and so beautifully blended that every sensa- tion of life comes as if by magic to the screen. \"•So easy too,\" to quote Max Du- Pont. Either the standard 35 mm. or the 16 mm. camera may be used. To the camera is attached the special Vitacolor filter holder. The film then is exposed in the usual manner. Any standard panchromatic film may be used. The resultant print is black and white and appears similar to ordinary prints. The color appears when the film is projected through a filter at- tachment carrying filters complimen- tary to those used on the camera. One of the outstanding impres- sions we receive is sharpness of focus. Mr. DuPont has made a noteworthy aquarium study of variously colored goldfish, in which the scintilating scales of the tiny swimmers demon- strate the extreme sharpness of focus obtain able with Vitacolor. The pictures have abundant round- ness, bordering on the stereoscopic in fact. This fact coupled with sharp- ness of focus demonstrates the im- mediate value of this wonderful process for scientific, educational and scenic subjects. o Dubray to Chicago Brother Joseph Dubray has left the camera field to take over duties with the Technical Research Depart- ment of the Bell and Howell Camera Company of Chicago. o \"Hey, Harry,\" called the assistant to his cameraman atop a twenty-five foot parallel; \"don't come down that ladder on the other side. I took it away.\" Officers of Local No. 37 Elected Studio Local No. 37 recently elected their new staff of officers at their headquarters, 8111 Santa Mon- ica boulevard. Local No. 37 is composed of Lamp Operators, Grips and Property Men. Steve Newman who has served as Business Representative of Local No. 37 for the past several years, declined to allow his name to be presented for re-election, having decided that he would retire. -Steve's place is now filled by Lew Blix. Following is a complete list of new officers of Local No. 37 : President — W. B. Jett. Vice-President — John Neft. Financial S/ecretary-Treasurer — Rav Norris. Business Representative — Lew C. G. Blix. Sergeant-at-Arms — H. H. Gra- ham. Delegates to Central Labor Coun- cil— Lew C. G. Blix, Kenneth Cof- fey, Carl J. Kountz. Executive Board — Jack Burke, Ed (Tex.) Cox, Dan Farmer, Frank M. Flanagan, Tom Kelly, John Lavin, D. J. Lilly. Trustees — Ray Duckwitz, Harry Hodgins, Dan Kelleher, Jesse Moulin, Ray Simbro. Examining Board — Jack Donahoe, George Taylor, Cliff Whitzel, Char- les Wirth and Ted Wuertenberg. o Operators Elect The annual election of Moving Picture Projectionists No. 150 is past history now. There was a heavy vote at their headquarters, 1 489 West Washington street, polls being open from 10 a. m. to 10 p. m., so that all those employed on the various shifts could have the opportunity of indi- cating their choice. Following are the new officers : President — C. C. Harden. Vice-President — Sidney Burton. Business Manager — T. E. Ecker- son. Secretary-Treasurer — R. L. Mac- Donald. Board of Trustees — G. Slipper, A. L. Feinstein, G. W. Page. Executive Board — M. J. Sands, E. W. Anderson, J. B. Kenton, Al. Pullen, Robert McConahey. Examining Board — W. R. Herm- ance, Don Williams, Louis Moelle. Sergeant-at-Arms — Clyde Babcock. Guide — David Levitte. Board of Inspectors — O. F. Stowe, Ray -Slagel, Chick Fowler. New Mitchell Factory The Mitchell Camera Company broke ground last week for their new $60,000 factory located at Robert- son and Santa Monica boulevard, West Hollywood. The building will be of the \"day- light factory\" type its walls being chiefly of glass and steel. It will provide 26,000 square feet of floor space. Nearly one hundred men will be employed by the Mitchell Company when they move into new quarters. Studio Agreement (Continued from Page 1) provide that each party selcet a Sec- retary to act as agent in the settle- ment of disputes which fail of local adjustment. Frank Carothers was selected by the International Unions to act as Secretary. A. L. Berres was chosen by the Producers' Com- mittee. Matters of a serious nature may perhaps find their way to the higher tribunal while most disputes will un- questionably be disposed of by Local officers or by the Secretaries estab- lished under the agreement. To Local No. 659 the first above referred to committee constitutes the Court of Appeal to which we turn for relief after other measures fail. The terms of the Agreement pro- vide a Method of Procedure whereby all wages, scales and conditions being of a serious nature, are to be deter- mined by the Producers' Committee and the Internationals' Committee and not by local adjustment. In consequence, our present needs for an equitable adjustment of conditions will necessarily be referred to those Committees. In fact, have already been so referred with every possi- bility of a hearing at an earlv date in New York City. President Canavan, who is chair- man of the Internationals' Commit- tee, is naturally deeply concerned in the conditions of the Los Angeles studios, but having six hundred sixty- five sister locals, as well as Local No. 659, whose interest he must conserve, we must subserve our own affairs to the opportune time that he, our In- ternational President, may be able to bring about the adjustments so earn- estly desired. A complete copy of the Articles of Agreement here referred to may be found on page 35 of the Proceedings of the 1928 \"I. A.\" convention in Detroit. February, 1929 The INTERNATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER Five The three views above show Bell and Howell, Mitchell, and De Brie Cameras mounted on the Akeley Gyro Tri- pod. A very clear idea may be gained from these shots of the maximum upward and downward tilt given to the camera by this Tripod. The Akeley Gyro Tri- pod may be had with either stud io legs or news and outdoor legs. Weight of tripod with studio legs— 30 lbs. Weight of tripod with news legs— 24 lbs. The NEjr Universal llGylb Tripod NOW givas you . . . greater spe($, flexibility ; and precision with ANY make} of camera REALIZING that the principles of the Akeley Gyro mech- anism, as embodied in the Akeley Camera, have con- tributed greatly to the mechanical success of motion pic- tures, we have placed on the market a tripod in which is con- tained an improved gyro mechanism adaptable to any make of motion picture camera. This Gyro mechanism now gives to any camera advantages until now exclusive with the Akeley Camera. The new tripod adds to all cameras the flexibility of the Akeley pan and tilt mechanism eliminating the use of crank handles and friction devices which Mr. Akeley found to be unsatisfactory in properly photographing follow shots. There are three different speeds or resistances in the pan, any of which may be selected by the operator. To insure ease of action the Akeley mechanism is entirely ball bearing. Altogether the Akeley Gyro Mechanism provides for the mo- tion picture photographer a more convenient, a quicker and a more profitable method of taking news or studio pictures. It makes the unusual picture an every-day occurrence, the heretofore impossible shot a simple matter. Write for our catalogue describing the Akeley Gyro Tripod in full and details of our time payment plan.

New York Hollywood Equity Ball Announcement has just been made that Maurice Chevalier, foremost Parisian stage and screen star, has consented to appear as a guest artist in the brilliant program of all-star entertainment planned for the first annual Actors' Equity Ball to be staged on the Pacific Coast, scheduled, for the night of January 31 at the Biltmore. Another addition to the stellar aggregation to take part in the caba- ret program just announced is Julian Eltinge, famous female impersonator. The program is by no means com- plete, according to Miss Margaret Smith of New York City, who is director general of the affair. Others billed for the lavish bill of notable stage folk include Pat Rooney, Marion Bent and Pat III, in one of their famous acts, Sophie Tucker, Ray Dooley, Eddie Dowl- ing, Ruby Keeler and others. The Los Angeles Equity frolic and cabaret program is open only to mem- bers of the association, according to Miss Smith, who has been identified with the New York affairs for many years, and many stars have already made arrangements for parties to at- tend. The ball committees, includ- ing the foremost stage and picture folk, have established headquarters at 6513 Hollywood boulevard, where tickets are available. o Union Made Magazines Members wishing to subscribe to magazines or periodicals may do so through Brother Maurice Hall, tele- phone GLadstone 4203 or HEmp- stead 1128. Brother Hall carries a complete line of Union made maga- zines. Demand the Label The Union Label is a bid for friendship. It carries no sting of malice. It says to the friend of Unionism, \"Here is a fair product, deserving of your patronage.\" Its mission is wholly constructive, thor- oughly progressive. No red fire or excitement mark its progress, but it holds its gains and makes new ones every day. — Los Angeles Citizen. o \"There was never a right endeavor but it succeeded. Patience and pa- tience, and we shall win at last . . . Never mind the ridicule, never mind the defeat! Up again, old heart, there is victory yet for all Justice.\" — Emerson. Shorter Week The California State Harbor Board, with headquarters at San Francisco, and of which Secretary Paul Scharrenberg of the State Fed- eration of Labor is a member, has established the five-day work week for all its employes, starting with the first of January. The Commission reports that by the new arrangement more work is accomplished than under the five and a half day week that formerly prevailed. There has been no reduction in pay under the new deal. — Los Angeles Citizen. Photography and Sound There has been a lot of criticism of late in various trade papers to the effect that the sound picture gained a voice only to lose in the quality of photography. Brother Arthur Edeson in his pic- ture \"Old Arizona\" for the Fox Film Corporation, not only proves that a picture can be beautifully photo- graphed as well as embodying excel- lent sound reproduction, but has gone so far as to successfully carry this technique into difficult locations in the open air. o Brother Ray Binger, assisted by Brother Jimmy Harper, together with Brother Irving Ries, assisted by Brother William Foxall, are this week completing specialty shots for \"The Mysterious Island,\" the under- water picture directed by Lucien Hubbard. Gus Edward's \"Review\" was be- gun last Friday on sound stage \"B\" at M-G-M. The picture is to be photographed in Technicolor by Ray Rennahan, assisted by Arthur Pier- son with general lighting effects by John Arnold. Charles Pollock will, of course, make the stills. ■ o A great constructive genius once declared : \"I criticise by construc- tion, not by finding fault.\" Good doctrine, that! Who is he who points out, with caustic sneer, how the doer of deeds has stumbled? Most frequently it is the man who has failed. — Scottish Rite News. Associated with Brother Victor Milner on the current Clara Bow production, \"A Wild Party,\" are Brothers Archie Stout, Rex Wimpy, Cliff Blackstone, assisted by Brothers Al Myers, William Clothier, and Dan Fapp, with Emmet Schoenbaum on the still camera. February, 1929 The INTERNATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER Seven Location Notice Attention is called to all members that they must notify the Local office before leaving town on location. When calling in, give names of entire camera crew, place of location and time you expect to be gone. This is important as it is one of the ways this office can co-operate with, and help the cameramen. o Demand the Label A man who will not help others is not, himself, worthy of being helped. The Union man who neg- lects the Union Label is denying help to those from whom he requires help. o Have you called at the office re- cently for your mail? We have a number of unclaimed letters here ad- dressed to members. Flash! Flash! Flash! To Editor of The International Photographer. Fast Wire. Chas. P. Boyle gets call to go to work at the Pathe studio. Weather permitting call. Second Flash. Hold. Rained today. Kodak Note Employes of the Eastman Kodak Company, numbering 20,000, entered December 20 into a new insurance and pension plan underwritten by the Metropolitan Insurance Company, whereby they get life and disability insurance and pensions, the costs of the premiums to be paid half by the Eastman Kodak Company and half by the employes. Sleep on Pequot The United Textile Workers of America wish every Union member and their family to buy and sleep on Pequot sheets and pillow cases. Why? Because it is the only 100 per cent Union made sheet in this country, and also because it is the oldest and best made. All other sheets and pillow cases are non-Union made. The American Federation of Labor in convention at Detroit, Los An- geles and New Orleans adopted reso- lutions urging Organized Labor to patronize Pequot sheets and pillow cases. Five-Day Week The Kodak Park plant of the Eastman Kodak, well remembered to war-time photographers, is to try the five-day working week as an experi- ment. If successful, the plan of operation will be extended to all points, affecting about 15,000 em- ployes. There are 5,000 employes in the Kodak Park factory. o The Hollywood Daily News is showing real prosperity and has re- placed the former newspaper press with a new one that is strictly up to date. This advance has been neces- sitated by the constantly growing cir- culation. They have also been mak- ing some advantageous improvements in the composing room in the way of rearranging the layout. Near a Pole Sherman — Wherever in the world you go, you'll find us Jews are the leading people. Roal — How about Alaska? Sherman — Veil, Iceberg ain't no Presbyterian name. — Colu?nbia Caul- dron. Greetings and congratulations to the International Photographers, on this, the occasion of the first issue of their official organ. □ ROY DAVIDGE FILM LABORATORIES Eight The INTERNATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER February, 1929 Pans and Tilts Brother Arthur Reeves has just completed several important improve- ments in film printers adapting them to the more efficient manipulation of sound films. * * * Just received a postcard from Brother Walter Scott of Local No. 644, who, with Brother Dan Clark of Local No. 659, is now in Tahiti, South Seas, making sound pictures for the Fox Film Company. * * * Brother Hugh McClung is super- vising the laboratory work and get- ting out release prints of the new Douglas Fairbanks picture, \"The Iron Mask,\" which was photographed by Brother Henry Sharp. * * * The filming of \"The Bridge of San Luis Rey,\" at Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer studios is keeping Brother Merrit Gerstad busy at first camera, Tommy Tutwiler assisting.

He vas voiking vit a leetle Kemeramen who vas a big feller. Von day he vent by locations and did not call it the Beezeness Menegement from the Local. All from a sudden came it a call from a BIG kemeramen who vas it a leetle feller, and he said to the Beezement Menegeness from the Local, I vant it, I shall have it dat leetle Haseest- ent Kemeramen to voik for me at more bucks per week. The Beezeness Menegement called and called and could not find the Haseestent Kemera- men, so de nice leetle Haseestent is still voirking for de little Kemera- men vat vas a beeg feller and not so many bucks. So ven you go by loca- tions, call the Beezement Meneger and dis same thing vont heppen by you. Dot's a nice leetle Haseestent, hoil up de shuttle. Film Care in the Tropics After spending a great many years in the San Fernando Valley, I nat- urally would have a great deal of experience in the handling of film under adverse conditions. So I will suggest a few tips for those that con- template such a journey. Do not open Panchromatic Film in the light. Do not light cigarettes with Pan- chromatic Film. Do not try to film scenes with lens caps on. An umbrella over the director makes the cameraman hot. When developing tests, use the hypo last. In drying tests, if soaked in alcohol they dry quicker. In drinking the alcohol, tests are not necessary. Better results will be obtained if exposed film is sent to laboratory in sealed cans instead of baskets. A Gamma filter on straight stock saves footage. These are just a few of the more important things. I am glad to state that due to the fact that arrange- ments have been made with the Coun- cil at Burbank, passports are not re- quired any more and a paid-up card will get lots of things from Brother I. A. members when on locations.

Vol. 1 HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA, MARCH, 1929 No. 2 \"Capital is the fruit of labor, and could not exist if labor had not first existed. Labor, therefore, deserves much the higher consideration.\" — Abraham Lincoln Federated Voters Active Organized Labor has for many years been aware, as has also the busi- ness interests, that within its grasp was a strength unused. This is the voting strength of its membership. The only reason that this strength has not been useful to the member- ship of the various unions is the fact that- the power has been only poten- tial and never co-ordinated so that it might be of value. The Federated Voters organization has brought about the co-ordination of this potential voting strength and is to be used for the betterment of the amusement industry. There are many laws that need enforcement for our safety. There is a need for the enactment of new laws. There is also a need for proper interpretation of old laws, which have in many instances been construed to mean the opposite of that originally intended. We are living in a period wherein those who ask shall receive if they have sufficient power to see that they get what they ask for. The large amusement companies all use the vot- ing strength, they claim they can pro- duce, to incur favors or for pressure on those who are interpreting the laws, but the fact remains that the votes these companies say they can produce are ours. The Federated Voters will not use the strength that they have for all political matters, but will confine themselves to those matters which are of interest and economic value to the members. There is nothing legiti- mate that we want which we cannot have so long as we present a united front when we vote. —Photo by Edwin Bower Hesser. HOWARD E. HURD Business Representative To our friends everywhere who have not had the pleasure of meeting our business representative, Brother Howard E. Hurd, this column is addressed. Brother Hurd took over active duty with Local No. 659 on August 1, 1928. He was unanimously chosen by members of the organization be- cause of the background of experience which has aptly fitted him to repre- sent the camera workers. Early in his business career Brother Hurd, as a newspaper reporter, cov- ered general assignments for the Chicago Daily Journal. He is a graduate lawyer, having originally matriculated at the Kent Welcome President Canavan We welcome you President Wil- liam F. Canavan. It is hardly possi- ble to express to you in words the pleasure experienced by the camera- men in anticipation of your proposed visit to Los Angeles. We welcome you as the President of the Interna- tional Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employes and Moving Picture Ma- chine Operators, because of the ex- alted position this title confers and the respect it commands from all. We welcome you as the highest exec- utive officer of our parent organiza- tion, because of the tremendous power that position controls. We welcome you as the arbiter of our contentions, the procurator of equity. But we also welcome you as \"Bill\" Canavan for your sincerity of purpose, your fairness to all, the sterling quality of your character, friendship and com- raderie. We extend a sincere and whole-hearted welcome to you \"Bill.\" College of Law in Chicago and com- pleted his legal training with the La Salle Extension University. More than five years ago he took over duties in the office of the camera department of the Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer studios. It was during this time that he became acquainted with virtually every cameramen on the Pacific Coast. He not only became acquainted with them personally, but learned their problems, their abilities, and their needs. That is why they have elected him to represent them in this, their struggle for decent hours, better working conditions, and fair com- pensation for services rendered.

When reporting, it is essential that you give names of entire camera crew, place of location, and length of time you expect to be out of town. Co-operation with the Local on this matter is the only way in which you can expect the protection of this Union while you are out of the city. o Local No. 644, New York, has moved headquarters. Their new ad- dress is 233 West 42nd street, Suite 606-610. o Initiation Increases The increase in initiation fees which went into effect on February 14, renders classifications as follows: First Cameramen .....$500.00 Akelev Cameramen 500.00 First \"Process 500.00 Second Cameramen 250.00 Still Photographers . .... 250.00 Second Process 250.00 Assistant Cameramen. ... 125.00 News Cameramen 100.00 Industrial Cameramen.. 25.00 Available List Never, until the formation of Local No. 659, have the camera- workers of the Pacific Coast had a central office, or guiding head. They were alone in their quest of employ- ment, unknown and unvalued. Today, through careful organiza- tion and wise Local government, the cameramen enjoy the finest employ- ment medium that has ever been available to them. For the first time since the inception of the picture industry a definite value has been placed upon the services of the camera- man. Our business representative accu- rately files each member as he reports himself available for duty. Members names are then taken from this list for employment in the order, by date, of their application for work. Studio managers upon placing a call for men of any classification are thus immediately supplied with com- petent men. That studio managers realize the efficiency of our Local is proved by the number of men employed through this office. Every studio in the city avails itself of this service to the mutual benefit of all. Notary A notary public is now available in the offices of the International Photographers, Suite 428 Markham building. o I. A.

The Los Angeles Citizen is the weekly bulletin of Union hap- penings, and Brother Hall assures us that if subscribed to will prove intensely interesting to members of Local No. 659. Besides representing the Los An- geles Citizen, Brother Hall will place your subscriptions for any Union made magazines. Call him at either GLadstone 4203 or HEmpstead 1128. The International Photog- rapher while primarily the house bulletin of Local No. 659, enjoys the distinction of being placed monthly in the hands of more than 1,000 photographic workers of the Motion Picture Industry. The members of this Local, to- gether with those of our sister Locals, No. 644 in New York, No. 666 in Chicago, and No. 665 in Toronto, represent the entire personnel of photographers now engaged in professional produc- tion of motion pictures in the United States and Canada. This condition renders The Interna- tional Photographer a voice of an ENTIRE CRAFT, covering a field that reaches from coast to coast across the nation. Brother Herrmann Is Live Wire The arm of the International is long. Early in February several cameramen on location with Pathe high in the mountains near Lake Tahoe were somewhat surprised to find that our steward of the northern territory, Brother John L. Herr- mann, was on hand to check cards. The card numbers and names of cameramen holding them were promptly forwarded to this office. The Pathe boys were as follows : Brothers Jacob Baderacco, Vernon Larson, Roy W. Noble, and Wm. H. Dietz. On February 17, Brother Herr- mann was on hand to check over the boys from Universal, working on location in the Yosemite valley. He found all members in good standing as follows — Brothers Geo. H. Robin- son, John Hickson, Joe Harris, Geo. G. Trafton, Wm. Dodds and Wm. J. Shuck. o Brother Jackson Eagan is now at Atascadero recovering from a recur- ence of illness incurred by the gas attack of the Chateau Thierry drive in June, 1918. Jack, who was a member of the Seventh Machine Gun Batallion, will be remembered by army men as one of the founders of AMAROC Post of the American Legion at Coblenz in 1920. The word AMAROC was made up of the two initial letters of AMerican ARmy of OCcupation. We just met King Charney talk- ing things over with one of his satis- fied Agfa customers. March, 1929 T h INTERNATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER Three Still Men Still men, you are selling a finished print to your employer — nothing more. The quality of the print he receives is his means of measuring your ability. It is of vital impor- tance that you insist that your fin- ishing be done in shops capable of giving the highest quality of service. These shops are not the cut-rate establishments your employer might be induced to patronize. The highest quality of commercial finishing in Hollywood today is be- ing done in studios owned and oper- ated by members of Local No. 659. In every instance these men are en- deavoring to standardize quality and price. The non-Union, cut-rate men are tearing down both with inferior material, cheap chemicals, cheap help, and high pressure salesmanship to your employer. Still men, it's up to you. Don't let them get away with it. You are the ones who suffer, because your em- ployer judges your ability by the prints delivered to his desk. Sell Union-finished stills to your employer. Show him that a few cents more for standardized finishing means dollars to the lobby display. The Union-finishers are with vou on this move. They will co-operate with you 100 per cent. They are prepared to deliver the highest standard of fin- ishing because they are able to give the greatest care to their work, em- ploy only the highest skilled work- men, and use the very best material obtainable. Your employer is a business man. If you explain the situation he will realize in a moment that you are right. He patronizes the cut-rate finisher because the 'just as good\" sales talk got to him before you did. Thanks, Mack Brother Macklyn Stengler recent- ly presented to the organization a fine walnut gavel which henceforth will hold sway on the chairman's desk at all meetings. Demand the Label The Union-Made label on the goods you buy means that the article was made by satisfied artisans, work- ing \"white man's hours\" under healthy, sanitary conditions.

Brothers Clyde DeVinna and Dale Deverman have just sailed on the first lap of the long journey to British East Africa, and are to he followed by George Nogle and Bob Roberts. They will film \"Trader Horn\" for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Clyde DeVinna is to go by way of London, where he is to pick up special photographic equipment. Thence he will go to Paris, Genoa, down the Mediterranean to the Red Sea and finally around the east coast of Africa to Mombasa. George Nogle will follow a slightly different route, having a stop at Ber- lin, where he is to make special scenes for Clarence Brown's new picture before proceeding on his way to join the M-G-M forces at Mom- basa. Martialing their forces at Mom- basa, the company will proceed some 800 miles into the interior of the Dark Continent where, near the fa- mous Lake Victoria, the story of \"Trader Horn\" will be photographed. At Nairobi, in Kenya, will be es- tablished a complete laboratory ca- pable of handling film immediately after it is exposed. This laboratory, which is under the supervision of Fred Meeks, assisted by Dominick De- Cento, will be so carefully equipped that the boys will be able to develop negative, make prints, and project them just as they would at the home studio. Besides the laboratory equipment, Clyde DeVinna is taking three Bell and Howell cameras and two Akeley cameras, thus allowing one spare camera of each type in case of emerg- ency. Albert Arnold, of Studio Mech- anics Local No. 37, carries enough reflectors and silver leaf to take care of reflected light necessary. Brother DeVinna's three trusty partners, Eddie Cornwall, L. E. Mc- Afee and W. B. Riley of Local No. 37, have a 1200-amp. portable motor generator set equipped with a Liberty motor which they will nurse through the long stay in the Jungle Conti- nent. They carry besides necessary cables and equipment 1200-amps. in arc lights and 800-amps. in Mazdas. Harry Alviez of Local No. 37, will prop the trip and says he ex- pects to have an easy time as he un- derstands Africa is already equipped with the necessary fixings to make a set look \"it.\" Brother Clyde DeVinna will be remembered as the photographer of that recent masterpiece of the Pacific Islands, \"White Shadows in the South Seas.\" He later made a trip to the same location where he filmed \"The Pagan.\" On both of these expeditions he was accompanied by George Nogle and Bob Roberts. The trio feel by this time quite capable of handling film under adverse con- ditions. Dale Deverman is taking his first long trip with the famous trio headed by DeVinna. \"We'll be back about September,\" said Brother DeVinna as he left the offices of Local No. 659 a few hours before his departure from Los An- geles, but we expect to hear from him before that time, of course. You see Clyde is very widely known for his expertness in handling short wave radios, and it will be remembered that he established some remarkable contacts during the trips to the South Sea islands. On the present location, DeVinna is the proud operator of the latest type short wave set to be obtained, an exact duplicate of the one carried by Commander Byrd on the South Pole Expedition. \"I have complete confidence,\" said DeVinna, \"of establishing regular contacts between the home studio in Culver City, and the location in Cen- tral Africa.\" Further news of the camera crew of \"Trader Horn\" will appear in future issues of the International Photographer, which by the way, will be delivered each month by special post to the camera headquarters in Nairobi. o Reprotone A and B The J. E. Brulatour Company an- nounces two new types of sound re- producing negative, from the labora- tory of the Eastman Kodak Com- pany. Reprotone, Type A, is especially recommended for the Photophone or R. C. A. system of sound photog- raphy. It is characterized by ex- tremely high contrast, fine grain, and high resolving power. Speed is ap- proximately the same as positive film. Reprotone, Type B, is designed for the Western Electric system and is characterized by fine grain, high re- solving power but with low contrast, allowing for complete gamma control in development. The emulsion char- acteristics are of such nature as to allow for greater freedom in exposure and development.

March, 1929 Thr INTERNATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER Five Making Money The International Photographer is pleased to quote several paragraphs from the pen of one of the most progressive observers of modern mov- ing picture problems. We refer to Air. Welford Beaton and the article, excerpts of which are here quoted, appeared in the Spectator. Mr. Beaton says in part : \"Henry Ford has his weak point. By working his employes only six or seven hours a day and only five days a week, and by paying them higher wages than other manufac- turers pay their employes for longer hours and one more day a week he has made only one billion dollars. \"Nothing would assist so much in making pictures better than sensible working hours in studios. There is money in regular hours. \"The greatest benefit that could be derived by the producers of mo- tion pictures would come from the inauguration of a forty-four hour week in every branch of the indus- try ; eight hours a day for five days and four hours on Saturday. \"It is inevitable that proper hours will be inaugurated in the industry. Producers are losing money by de- laying the time. The producers really think that anv suggestion of sensible hours is antagonistic to their interests. They can't see that they're wrong. They can't see that when Henry estab- lished his abbreviated week at un- abbreviated pay he was not thinking of his men at all. He did it solely to make more money than he could make by not doing it. A producer who can't grasp the wisdom of it, at least can contemplate Henry's billion. It's a whale of a lot of money.\" Mr. Beaton goes on to say that where the movie producer works his men to complete exhaustion during a week of fifty-nine hours, Henry Ford gets as much from employes in a thirty-hour week because his men are fresh with clear brains and ready muscles. Mr. Beaton is right. One has only to put in a few days time behind the desk at any of the motion picture worker's locals to realize how com- pletely exhausted these men become after weeks of day and night work. Flesh and blood cannot stand up un- der those galley-slave hours. The picture producer relies for the success of his expensive production on the eyes of his cameraman. Yet he demands that the cameraman work from ten to sixteen hours a day, long after his eyes are capable of giving anything like 100 per cent efficiency. The cameraman deals in the sensitiv- ity of silver ; one of the most exacting trades of science. The light that passes through the lens of his camera onto the sensitive silver film is mea- sured by one scale, and one alone ; the eyes of the cameraman. If his eves become exhausted by long hours of strain they can no longer give efficient service. Long hours; weary weeks. There is only one answer : inefficiency. The producer loses in the quality of his picture and the cameraman loses his health. We thank Mr. Beaton for his timely article and in closing quote his message to the motion picture producers. \"Whoever starts it (the shorter working week) is going to find that he is getting better pictures for less money, that he has back of him a loyal organization, and that he can get the pick of screen workers of Hollywood to work for him.\" Make-up Artists Progress All cinematographers know of the remarkable growth of that unique organizaiton known as the Motion Picture Make-up Artists Association. On its membership rolls are found every recognized make-up artist in the Motion Picture industry. Only two years since its organiza- tion, its growth has been truly re- markable and conductive of good feeling between the boys. Beautiful headquarters are main- tained in the Max Factor's Studio building at Highland avenue and Hollywood boulevard, and regular meetings are held each week. At these meetings demonstrations are given by the various members to the extent that each artist helps the other in solving the problems relating to their particular branch of the in- dustry. Mr. George Westmore is in charge of these demonstrations, and has per- formed his work in a most efficient manner. The organization, itself, is ably managed by its officers : President, Phil Gastrock Vice-President — Jack Pierce Secretary — Guy Pearce Treasurer — Max Fierstein All members of the Association are members of Local No. 235, The United Scenic Artists Union.

The cameras were located at vari- ous positions from pits below the ground to the cat walk, ninety feet above the pavement at the balloon school hangars at Arcadia. Quite intricate rigging was neces- sary as gear boxes had to be secured as well as the cameras.

Something Different A number of members of Local No. 659 have associated themselves with the Hollywood (300) Rifle Club, an organization chartered by the National Rifle Association, and supervised by the Director of Civilian Marksmanship of the War Depart- ment at Washington, D. C. The objects of the club are to instruct and educate the members in expert marksmanship with pistols, rifles, shotguns and bows; to foster good fellowship, and to encourage competition in marksmanship between teams and members of the club. Springfield rifles, 30 caliber. Model 1903, ammunition, targets, and all necessary equipment are furnished to this club without cost, by the Direc- tor of Civilian Markmanship. Tbe Rifle Club offers at a very nominal annual outlay a form of recreation both different and more interesting than the average form of club amusements. Members of Local No. 659 are invited to join, and these interest can obtain further in- formation from Brother Gene O. Hagberg, secretary of the organ- ization. A Blooper It happened at the Davidge Labora- tory. Roy Davidge called Walter, the delivery boy, the other day and told him to go over to Bell & Howell's to pick up a spark plug for tbe B & H printer. Walter thought there was a catch to the order and said : \"Say boss, you're not fooling me are you? You know when I first came over here, the boys sent me after a film stretcher.\" At any rate Walter hied himself over to the Bell & Howell shop, where be again became wary, and in- stead of asking for a spark plug, asked for a \"what-cha-may-call-it\" for the Davidge printer. \"Oh ! You mean a spark plug to fog the sound-track patches.\" \"Yeah, that's it,\" said Walter, and the boys at the shop wondered why he acted sheepish about it. WALTER J.

But the cameraman has to make good whether he is in the sound booth or outside. The deep secret that shrouds each studio about its sound work, insults the intelligence of every cameraman. The producer will benefit when he lets the cameramen solve his troubles as he has done in the past. Sound pictures are now, and always will be, a photographic process. The cameraman has worked hard to set up a standard of photography, only to have it shot to pieces by the advent of sound pictures, sound engi- neers, sound booths, and sound can't men. When we see some of the sound pictures we ask \"where is the photography of yesterday?\" Here is the low-down on some of the lots. We don't mention names because there is no value in giving away their pet secrets. Lot number one has built a box that just fits the camera and motor, with the finder outside the box. It was made sound proof with sponge rubber. They call this ensemble the \"baby blimp.\" Lot number two, on Santa Monica boulevard, made one picture using a sound booth, and the next one was made with the camera in a padded box. They never heard of the \"baby blimp,\" but used common sense to get the camera out of the booth. Lot number three has everyone signed to secrecy. This company has made a very successful western talkie. They use the sound booth very little, and when the camera is used out in the open, the cameraman and sound man get together and the sound of the camera is rendered unnoticeable by the position of the mike and the camera in relation to the amplifica- tion. No secrets, just plain common sense. Lot number four, a well known comedy producer, has placed the sound equipment in charge of the cameraman. He has no sound engi- neers, instead he has two electricians from a sister local handling the sound equipment. With this combination they are shooting with the camera out in the open, and doing work that ranks higher in quality than most of the successful sound dramas. After all photography is an open book, and it is the artistry and skill of the cameraman which makes one picture better than another. This ap- plies to sound pictures of the future, their success will be proportionate to the co-operation given the cameraman. Four Machines at Consolidated Not content with being one of the best equipped laboratories handling commercial work, the Consolidated Laboratories now have the distinc- tion of being the only laboratory on the coast operating four negative de- veloping machines. The machines just installed are known as the Erbograph, and are characterized by the fact that the film moves in a horizontal position instead of vertical. Advantages of this principle are easily recognized. The film is always submerged, thus obviating dangers from air oxidation or scum formations. Though being driven from both ends, the machine is surprisingly simple and easily ac- cessible. It allows easy circulation of developer as supply tanks may be placed quite low. The entire machine is notable for its lack of sprockets and complicated mechanism. This, of course, reduces chance of damage to negative while being developed. The Erbograph machine during use is suspended in the developer tray, but when cleaning, the machine is readily lifted away so that the tank may be slid out and either cleaned separately. These new negative machines, to- gether with their positive machines, make the Consolidated Laboratories entirely machine-operated. V. D. Smith and Aller report perfect re- sults from the new Dupont V. D. sound recording stock recently placed on the market by that company. V. D. is an abbreviation for variable density, and is a specially prepared emulsion perfected by Dr. V. B. Sease of the Dupont Company, associated with Dr. Donald Mc- Kenzie of the Educational Research Products Corp. March, 1929 The INTERNATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER Nine 'Hell's Angels\" Howard Hughes' epic of the air, \"Hell's Angels,\" is at last in the cutting room with approximately 1,500,000 feet of film to its credit. Actual work on the picture started in October, 1927, but owing to the exacting nature of the story the pho- tography was not entirely complete until fifteen months later. From a technical standpoint \"Hell's Angels\" is probably the most unusual picture ever photographed. Before the picture is released the cost of production will total in the neighbor- hood of $2,000,000. With com- paratively few sound effects the pic- ture stands as a collosal silent pro- duction, relying on technique and thrills for its unquestioned success. Our list of Local No. 659 camera workers who put in time on the pic- ture has mounted to such an astound- ing figure that we believe it holds all records for the number of camera- men employed on a single production. While the majority of these men were called through the Local for short periods, the regular crew worked steadily for a period of approximately fifteen months. Our Local records show the fol- lowing lineup: Harry Perry, E. Burton Steene, Gaetano Gaudio, Roy Greiner, Harry Zech, Dewey Wrig- ley, Alvin Wyckoff, Elmer Dyer, Eddie Kull, Terrell Bonnie, Cecil Love, Walter Griffin, Gene Hagberg, Arthur Reeves, Paul Ivano, Earl Metz, Paul Cable, Robert Gough, Otto Himm, Ross Hoffman, William •Stapp, Eddie Cohen, Fred Kaifer, Michael Santacrose, Walter Boling, Bob Miller, Irving Lippman, Leo Hughes, Paul Perry, Billy Tuers, Leonard Galezio, Ray Ramsey, John Leezer, Don Brigham, Rod Tolmie, Jockey Feindel, Arthur Lane, Mar- cel Grand, Jeff Gibbons, Roy Tripp, Jack MacKenzie, T.

Ten T h INTERNATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER March, 1929 Charles Rosher to England Brother Charles Rosher sailed on the steamer Majestic on Saturday, February 9, for Elstree, England, his \"home town,\" where he will take over a position on the photographic staff of the British International Studios. In order to accept this offer, Mr. Rosher has made special arrangements for his release from the United Ar- tists studio, where he has been under contract since the inception of that organization more than ten years ago. The studios at Elstree, known as the Hollywood of England, were opened more than two years ago on a commercial production scale equal to that of any studio in the United States. The British International lot has at present four large stages 300 by 200 feet and 40 feet high. Other buildings house prop rooms, laboratories, carpenter shops, etc., much in the manner of local studios. The picture business must be good, the Lyons Brothers are both work- ing. They are at the Warner studios on Vitaphone, helping Ben Reynolds put Sophie Tucker over.

Price, $2.50 Extra roll films, each 50c The Filmoscope Co. of America Room 423 Markham Bldg. 6372 Hollywood Boulevard Hollywood California Brulatour-Eastman Research Building J. E. Brulatour, Inc., is complet- ing construction on a class \"A\" build- ing at 6706 Santa Monica boulevard, Hollwood, which will be occupied by the West Coast technical service staff of the Motion Picture Division of the Eastman Kodak Company. The feature of this newest prog- ressive gesture by the Eastman people which is of vital interest to the cine- matographer is the research labora- tory which offers many interesting and potentially profitable features. This laboratory will at all times be under the supervision of men trained in the Research Department at Kodak Park, Rochester. Approximately $35,000 has been spent in mechanical and scientific equipment with many new develop- ments pertaining to conjunctive pho- tography in sound production. Research engineers in the service of Eastman Kodak Company have inaugurated their educational cam- paign on the West coast and it has been the privilege of many camera- men to hear the addresses made by these scientists at recent meetings of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and kindred picture organizations. An outstanding departure in film service is offered in the private thea- tre adjoining the new Research Serv- ice building. This theatre will be equipped for sound projection on the popular processes and will have com- fortable seating accommodations for fifty. The theatre is being equipped un- der the supervision of sound engi- neers from the East and is expected to be a revelation in small-room sound picture production, it having been especially constructed for this pur- pose. The throw from projection ma- chine to screen will be seventy-two feet; the ceiling is twenty-two feet and the width of the auditorium twenty-five feet. This theatre, the research labora- tory and the research library will be available at all times day and night by appointment to all accredited technicians and executives in the in- dustry without charge or obligation of any character. o — Brother E.

March, 1929 The INTERNATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER Eleven Jackman to Be Dentist Brother Floyd Jackman after sev- eral months of post graduate work at the University of Southern Cali- fornia, College of Dentistry, has re- turned to his former profession of dentistry. Previous to entering the motion picture camera field, Brother Jackman practiced dentistry for near- ly ten years. Because of the confining nature of dentistry Brother Jackman turned to motion picture photography which profession he followed for several years. That was in the days when pictures were filmed out in the great open spaces. Today, however, the soundproof camera hooth proves more confining than a dentist's office so Brother Jackman decided to take up once more the drill and cement bottle. Dr. Jackman's equipment is of the latest type manufactured by the Rit- ter Dental Mfg. Company. His office, 706 Hollywood First National Bank building at Hollywood boule- vard and Highland avenue, is a model of neatness and efficiency.

Every possible use to which this type of film is adaptable is being tested by Brother Fryer. Special attention is being paid to its reception of color values, which is destined to be an important factor in the future of both talking and silent motion pictures. Brother J. R.

It is the only establishment of its kind in America, and its importance to the Motion Picture Industry is keenly felt by every Cinema- tographer. Mr. W. J. German, vice-president and general manager of J. E. Bru- latour, Inc., of New York, is visiting the West Coast offices of J. E.

Hold every- thing! We thought he had been away from home. The \"islands\" was Catalina. * # * Brother Jackson Rose just com- pleted the Tiffany-Stahl super special production, \"Zeppelin,\" directed by Reginald Barker, with Conway Tearle, Clare Windsor and Larry Kent in the cast. This is the great- est production as well as the most expensive ever attempted by Tiffany- Stahl. A real Zeppelin was used in the ice field scenes and Brother Rose has a beautifully photographed pic- ture to his credit. Brothers M. Hall and Cecil Wright were his associates on the camera staff. * * * \"Between Pictures\" has a new meaning now. Karl Struss for in- stance has emerged for the time be- ing between the sound and silent ver- sions of \"Coquette.\" Though still a devotee of the golf links, Karl has had time to design a new finder bracket for the Bell and Howell camera that remains stationary on the tripod bed thus making it possible to line the finder without racking the camera back and forth. * * * Filming special railroad and snow effects for the M-G-M feature, \"Thunder,\" Brother Henry Sharp assisted by Brother Charles Straumer, is touring the Middle West and vari- ous point in the East. Among the numerous stops scheduled are the Baldwin Locomotive works in Phil- adelphia, and the railroad yards at Chicago. * * * Brother John Mescal, golf cham- pion of Local No. 659 and former city champion, after 16 years of earn- est endeavor succeeded in making a hole-in-one at the Fox Hills Country Club, on January 24. It was a 1 50- yard shot at the eleventh hole. Brother Mescal has just completed \"Leather Necks\" for Pathe. * * * Brothers Stewart Thompson and Walter Rankin have been having a sweet time lately, recording the activ- ities of the twenty-five \"Coquette\" girls who are here on a pleasure tour as the guests of Mary Pickford. Brother Earle Walker has just wrapped up another short comedy, \"Toots and Casper,\" for the Dar- raour Productions at the Cal-Art studio. \"King of the Khyber Rifles,\" an all movietone production for the Fox Film Company, is being photographed by Brother Joe August. With him on the second camera is Brother Irv- ing Rosenberg. They are assisted by Brothers Harry Webb, and J. P. Van Wormer. Brother Clarence Hewitt is the man under the focus- ing cloth on the still camera. * * * Because of the illness of his father, Brother George Bourne has left the camera profession indefinitely. He is now with his parents in Florence, Arizona. * * * Brothers John J. Mescal, Jake Badaracco, Burnett Guffey and Ver- non Larson, with Brother Whitey Schafer on the still camera, are win- tering at Lake Tahoe. They are photographing \"High Voltage\" for Pathe, a feature directed by Howard Higgin, featuring Wm. Boyd. * * * Brother Al Gilks left for the Para- mount studios in New York on February 1 to take charge of the photography on the sound production \"Cocoanuts.\" Brother Elmer Dyer has just fin- ished the air photography on the lat- est Hoot Gibson picture, \"The Winged Horseman.\" A good share of aerial camerawork has come his way lately as he was loaned by the Gibson company to do several weeks work on \"Hell's Angels.\" * * * Just as we go to press with the International Photographer there is a rumor afloat that Brother Walter Scott of Local No. 644, and Brother Dan Clark of Local No. 659, have returned from their long trip to the South Sea islands. They have spent the past several months in Tahiti, making sound pictures with native backgrounds, for Fox Film Company. Brother Leonard M. Poole of the Fox News is now on a six-week tour in the southwest territory. A report from him says the thermometer fell so low it had to be dug out of the ground.

Green, who accom- panied President Canavan on his re- cent visit to Los Angeles in behalf of the Cameramen, has been an Inter- national officer since 1917. He has been General Secretary-Treasurer since 1924. Brother Green is deeply concerned in the affairs of the Cameramen, which interest is prompted, no doubt by a secret ambition, revealed in a moment of weakness to the writer, to hold a card in the Cameramen's Local. Though a resident of New York City, like many other Easterners (William D. Lang, please note), he owns a home in California, and looks forward to the day when he will receive his apprentice's card in Local No. 659, and spend most of his time in sun-kist Los Angeles. Federation Powerful In the amusement industry you have a condition not equaled in any other business in the world. The organized crafts in this industry are more closely knit together within the separate locals, in jurisdictions and nationally, than any other trade. The spirit, interest and morale of the membership is not to be matched in all branches of organized labor. While the Local Unions attend to the business which directly concerns their local affairs, the national officers oversee that which is of more than local importance. There are many problems in each jurisdiction which, while they may be strictly confined in their scope to that jurisdiction, are of interest to more than one of the crafts. Sometimes only two crafts may be concerned in the problem, while at other times all of those in the industry are vitally interested. The amusement federations have been formed for the proper consider- ation of these problems and have done much to promote harmony in the in- dustry. They have great power, as they represent not only a large body of men but a large percentage of the total employees of the firms for whom we work. The Los Angeles Amusement Fed- eration is one of the most successful federations in the country. It is formed and acts for your benefit and for no other purpose. It is com- posed of the Musicians Local No. 47, A. F. of M., Stage Employees Local No. 33, I. A. T. S. E., International Photographers Local No. 659, I. A. T. S.

O. of the United States and Canada President Canavan is known as \"Bill\" to his vast army of I. A. T. S. E. adherents. He is quiet and un- assuming, capable of lightning-like decisions, conveying in few words the sound judgment that his years of experience in labor matters have im- pressed upon him. He has been an executive officer of the International Alliance for the past 1 7 years. In 1924 he was elected president of the I. A. T. S. E., which position he has held since. The effect of President Canavan's visit to the Coast upon the establish- ment of standardized conditions for the cameramen has not yet crystal- ized. and no official announcement can be made until a definite conclu- sion has been reached and sanctioned by both the Union and the employers.

Sease, of the Du Pont- Pathe Film Manufacturing Corpo- ration of Parlin, N. J., recently sent suggestion requests to the cameramen of Hollywood. These requests in- vited comments, criticism, or sugges- tion as to the betterment of the Du Pont moving picture negative. Mem- bers who have not returned these forms are urged to do so, in order to expedite the survey of Dr. Sease. One Year Old Local No. 659 was organized one year ago this month. Not only has the Union grown in strength and membership during that time, but it has lost few of those who began the struggle twelve months ago. Few crafts could have maintained an or- ganization of nearly 750 members over that period without a noticeable percentage of loss, especially during the trying times experieived since March', 1928. That our members have so faith- fully upheld all standards means something more than careful organ- ization. It means that every camera- man on the Pacific Coast feels in his heart the sore need of our craft for Unionization. It has come. Moreover, it has come to stay. With the Union has come for the first time in the history of the moving picture profession the recog- nition of the cameraman's value to production. During the past years he has given hours and weeks of his time to pro- ducers some of whom have not even thanked him for his sacrifice. The cameraman submitted to this injus- tice because he recognized that he stood alone against forces that were organized. Today the cameraman is no longer alone. He is himself a part of a clean and powerful organization. He knows that he is one of the links in a power- ful chain, and that in time of trial will be accorded equal recognition with the great chain itself. This is why our members have remained staunch during the first stormy year of our new life. They realize that the precept of our body, while not so voiced, may be summar- ized in the words of the Great Teacher : \"In so much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these, my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\" Location Notice •Several Local No. 659 men who have left town on location during the past month have found the advan- tages of checking in with our busi- ness representative before going. When reporting, it is essential that you give names of entire camera crew, place of location, and length of time you expect to be out of town. Co-operation with the Local on this matter is the only way in which you can expect the protection of this Union while you are out of the citv. The International Photog- rapher while primarily the house bulletin of Local No. 659, enjoys the distinction of being placed monthly in the hands of more than 1,000 photographic workers of the Motion Picture Industry. The members of this Local, to- gether with those of our sister Locals, No. 644 in New York, No. 666 in Chicago, and No. 665 in Toronto, represent the entire personnel of photographers now engaged in professional produc- tion of motion pictures in the United States and Canada. This condition renders The Interna- tional Photographer a voice of an ENTIRE CRAFT, covering a field that reaches from coast to coast across the nation. Union Label Series In the box below appears the first of a series of Union Labels to be published each month in this maga- zine, that our readers may become acquainted with the emblems to look for on each type of manufactured goods they purchase.

April, 1929 T h INTERNATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER Three Unemployment From the Union Label Trades De- partment of the American Federation of Labor. \"Unemployment is a growing, serious menace. Its importance is uppermost in the minds of all thought- ful men and women. Several rem- edies have been suggested. I shall not discuss this important economic question at this time, except to say that I am in full accord with organ- ized labor's long ago declared phil- osophy, that the only real remedy is to increase the purchasing power of the masses to a point that will en- able them to consume that which they help to create, and that the only way to do this is through and by our trades unions. \"The union label, shop card, but- ton and emblem is a silent, inexpen- sive, powerful and helpful means to this end. Injunctions or judge-made law cannot prevent us from spending our own money when, where and for what we please, AND IT SHOULD PLEASE ALL UNION MEN AND WOMEN TO SPEND THEIR UNION-MADE WAGES FOR\" STRICTLY UNION- MADE PRODUCTS.\" Mohr's Set Colossal The night club set of the picture, \"Broadway,\" shortly to be seen under the Universal banner is of special interest to cameramen throughout the country. Hal Mohr, chief cameraman, and Frank Graves, electrician, succeeded in so placing over 1000 Mole-Rich- ardson incandescent lamps and 2000 single incandescents that almost num- berless camera angles, each perfectly lighted, were instantly available. The set is said to be one of the most colossal interiors ever photographed on the Pacific Coast. It is probable that Brother Mohr had at one time on this set more in- candescent lamps than were used by all the other Hollywood studios com- bined. To the Mole-Richardson Com- pany, designers of lighting equipment, is due great credit for their co-oper- ation with Mohr and Graves in the task of working out special lighting equipment for numerous traveling shots. Hal Mohr will be remembered for his recent box-office success for War- ner Brothers, \"Noah's Ark.\" TREMONT FILM LABORATORIES CORPORATION % 823-829 Seward Street Hollywood California Silent • • Efficient INKIES • • Adequate Economical MR- 11 Utility Lamp MR- 14 Bell Flood MR- 19 Single Side MR -20 Double Side MR- 30 Overhead Strip MR- 31 Floor Strip Domes, Clusters, Special Units MR- 35 1000 Watt Spot MR- 25 2000 Watt Spot MR-200 18-inch Sun Spot MR-224 24-inch Sun Spot MR-205 Soft Spot MR-211 Rifle Spot MR-10 Cine-Lite for the Amateur various units provide a means for obtaining any desired light value MOLE - RICHARDSON, Inc. STUDIO LIGHTING EQUIPMENT 941 N. SYCAMORE AVENUE HOLLYWOOD, CALIF. Four The INTERNATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER April, 1929 Sound Secrets By Arthur Reeves Having a few moments to spare recently, I went up to the control room of Radio Station KMTR to see my old friend Forbes W. Van Why, chief engineer of KMTR, and consulting engineer of four other major radio stations. Realizing the similarity between his mixing board and the equipment used by studios in recording sound pictures, I asked him to tell us a few hints from practical experience which would be applicable to our own pro- fession. Here it is, in Van's own words: \"Our mixing panel, while embody- ing several features of our own de- sign which incorporates many fea- tures of extreme flexibility, serves the same chief purpose as all mixing equipment in general. Its chief func- tion is to permit the use of multiple microphone arrangement, thereby per- mitting the 'picking-up' of voice or music over a greater area, or from a greater number of artists or instru- ments, than is generally advisable with only a single microphone. When several microphones are employed by means of a so-called mixing panel, the blending of the singals from the several microphone circuits is of great importance and is strictly, or should be, in the hands of a trained engineer. However, the engineer should not sit at his controls and constantly turn and twist the volume control dials in order to control the shading of the renditions. This steals the individual interpretation of the vocal or musical selection away from the artist or musician, and places same within the hands of, not an artist, but an engi- neer (very good or very bad). The interpretation of any selection is a matter for the artists to follow, the engineer or mixing control operator naturally has certain limits within which he must keep his volume. This applies to radio broadcast or any type of talking motion picture system, but — outside of that, twisting of the dials and shading of the selections by the technical man is nothing short of 'robbery' as applied to the artistic interpretation of a vocal or musical selection. If anyone is skeptical"
