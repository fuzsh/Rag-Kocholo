The station is owned by Times-Shamrock Communications and broadcasts a classic rock format. Its studios are in Hunt Valley and its broadcast tower is located near Owings Mills at (39°26′49.9″N 76°46′47.2″W / 39.447194°N 76.779778°W / 39.447194; -76.779778).[2]\n\nThe station's service contour covers the Baltimore metropolitan area and southern portions of South Central Pennsylvania.[3] The station markets itself as the only station in the Baltimore market dedicated to the classic rock format.\n\nHistory\n\nEngineer Russ Morgan signed on the station for the first time on November 1, 1959, as WTTR-FM.[4][5]\n\nShamrock Communications purchased the station on April 7, 1981, and changed the format to easy listening. The station's call sign was changed to WGRX in 1984, with a format change to \"Eclectic Oriented Rock\",[5] a hybrid format created by Radio Consultant John Sebastian.[6] The format changed to classic rock in May 1987.[5]\n\nWGRX changed its format to modern rock on December 2, 1994, branded as The X.[7] In April 1996, the station fired its program director and six DJs,[8] then aired a weekend-long stunt of disco music as \"Polyester 101\"[9] before switching to a country music format on May 6, 1996,[10][11] branded as \"Froggy 100.7\". The station later rebranded as \"New Country 100.7\".[12]\n\nOn December 1, 1999, due to declining ratings, the station switched its call sign to WZBA, rebranded as 100.7 The Bay and changed formats to \"Rock AC\" (Rock Adult Contemporary), similar to WMMO in Orlando[13] with the slogan \"Rock Without the Hard Edge\".[14]\n\nIn 2001, WZBA relocated its transmitter closer to Baltimore.[14]\n\nThe station changed its format to classic rock[14] when WXFB changed formats from classic rock to smooth jazz on September 5, 2003.\n\nJefferson Ward, the station's general manager, retired in 2021.[15]\n\nSignal note\n\nWZBA is short-spaced to two other Class B stations operating on 100.7 MHz: WLEV 100.7 WLEV (licensed to serve Allentown, Pennsylvania) and WZXL 100.7 ZXL (licensed to serve Wildwood, New Jersey). The distance between WZBA's transmitter and WLEV's transmitter is only 105 miles (169 km), while the distance between WZBA's transmitter and WZXL's transmitter is only 110 miles (180 km), as determined by FCC rules.[16] The minimum distance between two Class B stations operating on the same channel according to current FCC rules is 150 miles.[17]\n\nTranslators\n\nWZBA programming is broadcast on the following translator:[18]\n\nCall sign Frequency City of license FID ERP (W) HAAT Class Transmitter coordinates FCC info W261CD 100.1 FM Baltimore, Maryland 59981 2 93 m (305 ft) D 39°17′12.3″N 76°36′30.8″W / 39.286750°N 76.608556°W / 39.286750; -76.608556 (W261CD) LMS\n\nReferences"
