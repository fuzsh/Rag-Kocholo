Every day we raise the expectations of blind people, because low expectations create obstacles between blind people and our dreams. You can live the life you want; blindness is not what holds you back!\n\nThe National Federation of the Blind Pledge\n\nI pledge to participate actively in the efforts of the National Federation of the Blind to achieve equality, opportunity, and security for the blind; to support the policies and programs of the federation; and to abide by its constitution.\n\nAbout the National Federation of the Blind of Maryland\n\nThe National Federation of the Blind of Maryland (NFBMD), an affiliate of the National Federation of the Blind (NFB), is an organization of blind people and their family and friends. We believe in the full capacity of blind people; we have the power, influence, diversity, and determination to help transform our dreams into reality. Our members work together for a brighter tomorrow by raising the expectations for blind people everywhere so that blind persons can live the lives they want.\n\nWho We Are\n\nThe National Federation of the Blind of Maryland is a 501c(3) nonprofit comprised of blind people of all ages, their families and friends. Our strong local chapters and divisions, and well-trained leaders help newly blind people adjust to vision loss and promote the full participation and integration of blind people in our communities. We bring our collective experiences together to effect change at the state and national level.\n\nWhat We Do\n\nAssist blind and low-vision persons to acquire the skills of independence\n\nHelp blind and low-vision persons to develop confidence in themselves through our many service activities\n\nTeach blind and low-vision persons the skills of leadership through active participation in conventions, chapter meetings, and civic activities\n\nEncourage blind and low-vision seniors to continue their active and meaningful lifestyles\n\nPrepare blind and low-vision students for productive tax-paying careers through academic and training scholarships\n\nInform people with diabetes about options for coping with vision loss\n\nSupport parents and friends of blind and low-vision children with information about the capabilities of the blind\n\nProtect and promote the civil rights of blind and low-vision persons through public education and legislative action\n\nAdvocate for policies that eliminate discrimination and guarantee equal access to educational programs and high-quality rehabilitation\n\nEducate the public through seminars, community activities and our publications\n\nThank You, Convention Sponsors\n\nWe extend profuse thanks to the following convention sponsors.\n\nBlind Industries and Services of Maryland, Title Level Sponsor\n\nVanda Pharmaceuticals, Equality Level Sponsor\n\nMaryland Accessible Communications / Communications Facilitator, Independence Level Sponsor\n\nAdNet/AccountNet, Inc., Independence Level Sponsor\n\nBrown, Goldstein and Levy LLP, Opportunity Level Sponsor\n\nFriends of the Maryland State Library for the Blind and Print Disabled, Opportunity Level Sponsor\n\nWZBA-FM 100.7 The Bay, Opportunity Level Sponsor\n\n3D PhotoWorks, Freedom Level Sponsor\n\nDemocracy Live, Freedom Level Sponsor\n\nMorgan Stanley Wealth Management, Freedom Level Sponsor\n\nSipbound Corporation, Freedom Level Sponsor\n\nNavigating the Sheraton Baltimore North\n\nThe Sheraton Baltimore North Hotel is located at 903 Dulaney Valley Road, across the street from the Towson Town Center. Meeting rooms and common areas are located on the first and second floors. Guest rooms are on the third floor and above. The gym and pool are also on the third floor.\n\nPlaza Level (first floor):\n\nAs you come into the tiled lobby of the hotel through the main entrance doors, directly in front of you is a large carpeted square seating area with chairs. To the right of the central carpeted area is the front desk.\n\nOn the far side of the carpeted area, directly opposite the main door, is another entry/exit to: a smoking area; a flight of stairs going down with trash cans on either side at the top of the steps; and at the bottom of the stairs, a grassy area appropriate for dog relief. (Please don’t forget to use a baggie!) This exit is also the closest one to Towson Town Center.\n\nTo the left of the central carpeted area (opposite the front desk) is a divided hallway which leads to the rest of the hotel facilities on this level. Think of it as an L-shaped hallway. If you start at the main entrance and put your back to the hotel’s front desk and walk forward, you will be at the apex of the L, where there is the first staircase to the second level. Along the short leg of the L to your right is the Coffee Corner, where every day from\n\n6:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., you can get Starbucks, pastries, salads, sandwiches, yogurt, and assorted fresh fruit and snacks. Past the Coffee Corner, you will find the elevator lobby. There are two elevators on the left and one on the right. All three elevators may be used to access the floors of guest rooms, the second floor where the meeting rooms are located, and the third floor where the fitness area and pool are located.\n\nIf you go back to the apex of the L-shaped hallway, the long leg of this hallway takes you past multiple conversation areas, and eventually leads, with a bit of a curve, to the conference facilities on the plaza level. With the lobby directly behind you, continue down this hallway. First on your left is the Business Center (for guest use), with two tables, each with a computer, and a printer between them. Next on the left of the hallway you will find some big comfy chairs facing a flat screen TV. Opposite this seating area, on the right side of the main hallway are the afore-mentioned stairs (which are around the corner from the Coffee Corner).\n\nFurther down the hall on the left is a high-top table surrounded by six chairs with plug-ins for eight devices. Directly opposite this table, on the right side of the hallway, is the beginning of Warfield’s Ballroom. Warfield’s Ballroom extends down the right side of the hallway. One entrance to Warfield’s Ballroom has a few steps in front, but the other entrance is accessible. Further down the hallway on the left are several groupings of round high-top tables and chairs.\n\nPast Warfield’s you will be heading straight to the host stand for the Rain 903 Restaurant and Lounge, where you wait to be seated. At this point the main part of the hallway (which is no longer carpeted) opens up and slightly veers off to the left. Once you have turned left, you will pass the restaurant and then the steps that lead up to the bar on your right. Past the bar on the right side of the hallway are the restrooms. There is a wall with a flat screen display blocking direct access to the restrooms. Go around the wall on either side to find the restroom alcove with the ladies’ room on the left and the men’s room on the right. There are two water fountains between the restrooms. On the left side of the hallway opposite the wall shielding the restroom alcove are more high-top tables with chairs.\n\nContinue past the restrooms just a short distance and find another large carpeted open area. This is the Fitzgerald West Foyer. With your back to the central hallway, there’s another entry/exit door going to/from the parking area, on your left. To your right, across the foyer is the very large\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald Ballroom. There are many entry/exit doors to this area, which we will use for exhibits and other meetings on Friday, general sessions on Saturday and Sunday, and the banquet on Saturday evening.\n\nAlong the far left side of the Fitzgerald Ballrooms, you will find another long hallway, called the Fitzgerald North Foyer. This is where convention registration, packet pickup, and banquet ticket exchange will be located. You must walk through the Fitzgerald West Foyer to get to the Fitzgerald North Foyer. At the end of the Fitzgerald North Foyer is a short set of stairs that lead outside to a second guide dog relief area.\n\nAt the end of the hallway that leads from the main lobby, past the Fitzgerald West Foyer on your right, is the second set of stairs, which lead to the second floor. One can walk directly under the stairs, so be careful not to bump your head.\n\nSecond Floor:\n\nDirectly across from the top of the stairs that are in the Fitzgerald Foyer area is one of the two entrances to the Duncan Room. You can only turn right at the top of the stairs. On your left you will first pass the Duncan Room, followed by the Amphitheater. After the first entrance to the Amphitheater, the hallway opens up to something like a T-intersection. If you follow the wall on the left, past the second Amphitheater entrance, you will be able to make a right into another hallway. On the left side of this hallway, you will first encounter a set of restrooms (ladies on the left and men on the right). Further down the hall on the left you will find Lindsay A, B, and C. There is nothing else in this hallway.\n\nBack at the 3-way intersection with the stairs behind you, the Grason Room is straight ahead of you. Turn right here and on your left you will pass the Burke Room, the MacIntosh Room and the Cole Room, beyond that is the Sales and Catering Office. Along the right side of the hallway is an opening which allows you to look down on the plaza level. As you approach the end of this hallway, there is another large open space. If you follow the wall to your left, you will find the stairs that take you downstairs near the lobby around the corner from the Coffee Corner. Pass the stairs on your left and turn left into the elevator lobby, where you will find two elevators on the left and one on the right.\n\nThird Floor:\n\nAs you leave the elevator lobby, straight ahead is the fitness center, including the pool. You will need your room key to enter this area. The hallway off to the right leads to guest rooms.\n\nLIVE THE LIFE YOU WANT\n\nLyrics copied from October 2015 Presidential Release\n\nChorus: Live the life you want. Nobody can stop you.\n\nShoot for the sun and break on through.\n\nSo you're blind. You'll be fine. We've got good news!\n\nYou can live the life you want.

On the left side of the ad is a photo of a man wearing dark glasses walking through a lobby led by a guide dog. Vanda Pharmaceuticals is dedicated to raising awareness of Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (Non-24) and supporting the blindness community. Non-24 is a rare circadian rhythm disorder affecting up to 70% of people who are totally blind. People living with Non-24 experience excessive daytime sleepiness and nighttime sleeplessness, which leads to impaired social and occupational functioning. This is due to the misalignment between the internal master body clock and the 24-hour day.
