        "text": "Today's fish-dominated seafood consumption pattern cannot be sustained, since supply has shifted from capture to culture (each currently at around 100 million tons/y). Already today, seaweeds (macroalgae) and shellfish dominate mariculture. To prevent crises, wise policies could anticipate this inevitable shift, by promoting seaweed and shellfish production and consumption. The current rate of expansion in mariculture production will inevitably rise in the long run. Eventually, the seafood share in global food supplies, primarily in 3rd world countries, will rise, with the emerging global exhaustion of arable land and freshwater reserves. The sea remains the world's last food frontier-the only environment that is still available for expansion of food production. A sustainable expansion of seafood culture by orders of magnitude necessitates a balance, as in agriculture, between fed aquatic animals (fish, shrimpâ€¦) and extractive plants and animals (bivalves, detritivores). Extractive organisms ameliorate the environmental impacts of the fed animals' farming, while bringing more income and jobs. Cultured seaweeds, with their biochemical composition and high protein content, can also replace much of the fishmeal in aquaculture diets and provide humanity with nutritious protein.\n\nKey factors affecting the economic sustainability of any aquaculture industry and in particular the seaweed industry are its ecological interactions and impacts. Understanding these issues requires an extended production analysis and simulation, given the natural variability and dynamics of external factors that affect those interdependencies. As such, making sense of production data is required for suitable planning and resource optimization in a seaweed farm. The present work calculates the required water renewal rates for seaweed flow-through production units, using a novel simple user-friendly nitrogen budget model. The user interface is straightforward and the model parameter inputs and outputs are minimal, whereby the target users are commercial seaweed farmers. The model was parameterized for production kinetics of Ulva spp. based on an extensive literature survey, and was evaluated with published data on seaweed-growing experiments. Results for the estimated number of volume renewals per day are in agreement with the experimental data. The outputs indicate that this application can be used to estimate the envelope, i.e. average lower and upper ranges for water renewal rates for a given production in a given site. This model and corresponding parameterization for Ulva spp. are available to be used by farmers, managers and researchers in the form of a spreadsheet file (available as Supplementary Material). The conceptual model and application presented herein represent the basis for future developments to incrementally increase complexity, regarding additional seaweed species and production settings (in recirculating and integrated multitrophic aquaculture systems) by farmers and planners.

Fish and seafood represents a healthier alternative to terrestrial meat and processed meat products; usually having a higher protein content on an edible fresh weight basis than terrestrial meats, are generally leaner and have a lower saturated fat content than terrestrial meats, and are unique in the animal kingdom as being a naturally rich source of heart-healthy long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA 20:5n-3] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA 22:6n-3]), and are also generally a richer source of essential minerals and trace elements than most terrestrial meats (including Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Iron, Potassium, Sodium, Zinc, Copper, Manganese, Selenium, Iodine, Fluorine, and Trivalent chromium), and are also a richer source of several key vitamins than most terrestrial meats (including Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Vitamin B12, Folic acid, and Choline)."
