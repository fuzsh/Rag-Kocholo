The document provides an introductory overview of the Valley of Kashmir. It describes Kashmir in 1887 as an absolute monarchy, where the people looked to the Maharaja as their direct ruler. At that time, the administration was plagued by abuses of power, corruption, and oppression of villagers. The villagers were treated as serfs without rights, forced to labor, and dragged away from their homes. In contrast, city dwellers were pampered. The introduction sets the stage for reforms begun through a new land settlement process starting in 1887.",
