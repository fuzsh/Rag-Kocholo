        "text": "KSPS in Spokane, Wash., announced two promotions.\n\nDawn Wiley Bayman stepped up to station manager. Bayman joined the station in 1996 as a producer and most recently worked as chief investments and partnerships officer.\n\n“By moving Dawn to station management we’ll be able to have a greater impact by growing our community outreach and partnerships,” said KSPS President Gary Stokes in a news release.\n\nIn addition, Skyler Reep was named director of development. He joined the station as membership director in 2017. In the release, Stokes said Reep “has an excellent track record in both fundraising and digital communication” and will “help us stay sustainable while we reach new audiences and improve our service to the community.”\n\nKerry Swanson was appointed COO for KUOW in Seattle.\n\nSwanson started working for the station in January “on a year-long project appointment to assist General Manager Caryn Mathes with the research and creation of a COO position,” according to a news release. Swanson started the job Tuesday.\n\nBefore KUOW, Swanson was station manager for Northwest Public Broadcasting in Pullman, Wash. He has also been director of radio for WABE in Atlanta and held several positions with KNKX in Tacoma, Wash., including COO and GM.\n\nNatalie Engel left her position at PBS Kids.\n\nEngel, a senior director of development in the content department for PBS Kids, will transition to a consultant role, according to a PBS spokesperson. News of her role change was first reported by Deadline.\n\nEngel joined PBS in 2009 as executive coordinator of marketing, communications and children’s media. She was also assistant director of marketing for PBS Kids before transitioning to content roles in 2014.\n\nBrian Bull will be lead interviewer and consultant for The Public Radio Oral History Project.\n\nThe project aims to interview 40 “living pioneers and builders of the public radio system in America during the next year,” according to a news release. “The recent deaths of Jim Russell and Wally Smith underscore the urgent need for oral history interviews to begin,” said Project Director Ken Mills in the release.\n\nBull, an enrolled member of the Nez Perce Tribe, is currently co-interim news director for KLCC in Eugene, Ore. He joined the station as a reporter and producer in 2016. Bull has worked for Ideastream Public Media in Cleveland, Wisconsin Public Radio and South Dakota Public Broadcasting and was president and chair of Vision Maker Media from 2004–2014.\n\nContent\n\nManuel Valladares announced on Twitter that he was hired as an associate producer for Southern California Public Radio. Valladares first joined the organization in 2020 for an apprenticeship as AirTalk news clerk. He most recently worked as a contract assistant producer.\n\nDana Meyers was hired as a host for Indie 102.3, a music station owned by Colorado Public Radio. Myers, who started in radio at the student-run station at the University of Colorado Boulder, most recently worked as a host and production director for WZBA in Baltimore. She is succeeding Jeremy Petersen, who joined the organization in 2015. Petersen left Colorado during the pandemic but continued to work remotely. “We are grateful to Jeremy for providing terrific hosting from afar during that unprecedented time,” said Sean Nethery, SVP of content, in a news release. “Now that things are mostly back to normal, hosts need to be members of the Colorado community, attending events, interviewing musicians in our onsite performance studio and more.”\n\nFellowships\n\nWBUR in Boston selected Jacob Garcia and Irina Matchavariani as its 2023 Newsroom Fellows. Garcia graduated from Florida State University last year and most recently worked as an associate producer for GBH in Boston. Matchavariani earned her master’s degree in journalism from the University of Missouri this year and previously worked as an editorial intern for Illinois Latino News."
