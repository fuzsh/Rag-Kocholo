Some such demonstration and prototype reactors were built in the country, and the electric power furnished from them 6 was used by utilities, just as any other electricity was used. But they were not considered a commercial alternative to the normal forms of electric generation.\n\nIt is my understanding, at least,and my belief, that all of the projects that you have been have been conta'ned in the documents that you showed me are of 12 that form. My affidavit relates to the first time in which 13 - an o fering was made that could be considered an al\" ernative to the other available forms of generation.\n\n16 Q. I'm a bit confused. You say the projects prior 17 to the mid-60's are research and development? Is it vour af idavit's statement that the Turkey Point plants we e research and development?\n\n20 The licenses to be granted were. so-called research 21 and development licenses. The plants were of a size and 22 \"he potential economics were projected to be on the same seal\n\nas other alternatives that were available.\n\nSo they were planned commercial, as opposed to research and development?\n\nMR. BOUKNlGHT: I object to that. You are asking Mr. Gardner to make a legal characterizat'on, Mr. Guttman.\n\nYou know both of those are terms of the Atomic Energy Act as of tha time.
