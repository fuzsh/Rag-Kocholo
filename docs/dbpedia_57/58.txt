Baltimore, or "Charm City," is the largest city in Maryland and the state's bustling cultural and industrial center. Baltimore boasts all the excitement you'd expect to find in a major U.S. city, but is situated remarkably close to the Appalachian Mountain range, rolling countryside, and a variety of seaside resorts. Baltimore Harbor is one of the best protected deepwater seaports in the world, with the Delmarva Peninsula shielding the area from most hurricanes and tropical storms, and the Appalachian Mountains protecting the city from the most extreme winter cold.

Baltimore has undergone a renaissance in recent years, including a revitalization of the Inner Harbor and its surrounding neighborhoods. Harborplace, a modern urban retail and restaurant complex, was opened on the waterfront in 1980, followed by the National Aquarium in Baltimore, Maryland's largest tourist destination, and another cultural venue, the Baltimore Museum of Industry in 1981. Baltimore also enjoys two of the nation's premiere sports facilities: In 1992, the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball moved from Memorial Stadium to Oriole Park at Camden Yards, the first and most highly praised of the "retro" style ballparks, and six years later the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League moved to a new stadium next door.

Baltimore was recently named one of the New York Times' 52 Places to Go in 2018 (listed as number 15).
