Leading the latest phase of activity is specialty insurance distributor Amwins, which inked a new lease for 15,569 square feet of office space. Joining Amwins are game developer Midsummer Studios, radio station WZBA-FM, 100.7 The Bay, Resilient Health Acupuncture, Blis Pilates, law firm Wagonheim & Associates and financial adviser group Accompany Wealth Partners. Combined, the seven tenants will occupy more than 35,000 square feet across the four-building complex.

“The diversity of companies involved with this recent wave of new leases exemplifies the range of industries that are attracted to Executive Plaza’s strategic location and best-in-class business environment,” Danielle Beyrodt, Hill Management’s vice president and chief operating officer, said in a statement.

The commercial complex at 11350 McCormick Road just off Interstate 83 boasts a range of amenities, including conference spaces and dry cleaners, child care offerings, a newly upgraded fitness center, an on-site deli and a post office. Free surface and underground parking offers commuters car detailing opportunities, though the development is also within walking distance of Maryland Transit Administration service and light rail stops.
