How does verification work?

Verified signatures are those which we have taken one or more extra steps to confirm as legitimate:

• Direct contact - We have been in direct contact with this person to verify that they have signed the letter.

• Declaration URL - This person has made a public declaration of signing the open letter which can be viewed online.

All published signatures, ‘verified’ or otherwise, are subject to several forms of verification: email verification, spam and duplicate filters, and a review by a member of our data vetting team.
