Nobel Prize in Peace is a special award given to people and groups who have done great things to bring peace to the world. It was started by Alfred Nobel, a smart person who invented dynamite. In his will, he said that his money should be used to make prizes for achievements in different areas, like Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Literature, and Peace.

The Peace Prize is different because it’s given out in Norway, not Sweden like the other prizes. This is what Nobel wanted, and it was decided by a special group chosen by the Norwegian Parliament. Since 1901, the Nobel Peace Prize has been given to people, groups, and movements that have made big differences in making peace, solving problems, and protecting human rights. Winners can be leaders, activists, or groups that have made the world safer and better.

First Nobel Prize in Peace

The very first Nobel Peace Prize was given in 1901. It was awarded to two people: Henry Dunant and Frédéric Passy.

Henry Dunant helped start the Red Cross, which helps injured people during wars and disasters. He also made rules to treat wounded soldiers and prisoners of war kindly. Frédéric Passy worked hard for peace and was part of a group that brought together different countries’ parliaments to talk and cooperate.

Henry Dunant and Frédéric Passy were the first people to get the Nobel Peace Prize. They showed how important it is to work for peace and help others during hard times. Their work set an important example for peace around the world.

Nobel Prize in Peace 2023

The Nobel Peace Prize for 2023 goes to Narges Mohammadi. She’s being honored for her brave fight for women’s rights and human freedom in Iran. Narges has faced a lot of personal hardships for her beliefs. She’s been arrested 13 times, convicted five times, and given a harsh sentence of 31 years in prison plus 154 lashes. Right now, she’s still in prison.

In September 2022, a young Kurdish woman named Mahsa Jina Amini was tragically killed while in the custody of the Iranian morality police. This event sparked huge protests against Iran’s ruling regime, the biggest since 1979. People chanted “Woman – Life – Freedom” to show their support for women’s rights. More than 500 protesters lost their lives, and thousands were hurt. Some were even permanently injured, losing their sight from rubber bullets fired by the police. Shockingly, over 20,000 people were arrested and kept in regime custody.

Narges Mohammadi’s fight isn’t just for women. She’s also fighting for free speech, and independence, and against rules that restrict how women can live their lives. The demands for freedom from these protesters apply to everyone, not just women. It shows how important these values are for everyone.
