        "text": "The Nobel Peace Prize, awarded by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, is awarded in honour of Alfred Nobel who died on 10 December 1896. According to the term of his last will and testament dated 27 November 1895, “…one part [one fifth of the annual returns on the assets of the Foundation] [shall be apportioned] to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses. He also stated that, “in awarding the prizes, no consideration whatever shall be given to the nationality of the candidates, but that the most worthy shall receive the prize, whether he be a Scandinavian or not”.\n\nWhen you read the biographies and stories of these Nobel laureates, you will notice that there are no restrictions or criteria to ways through which one can act as a champion for peace. There is no restriction based on race, age, geographical location, sex, religion, educational qualifications, or even socio-economic status.
