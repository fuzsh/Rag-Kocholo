Einstein nominated other eleven scientists, and all them were Nobel Prizes laureates. We also examine and discuss the Nobel Peace Prize Nominators and Nominees from 1901 to 1964. Just taking into account data up to the year of the Nobel Prize, the highest number of nom- inations was awarded to an organization, the Permanent International Peace Bureau in 1910, with a total of 103 nominations, followed by two women: Bertha von Suttner (101 nominations, 1905) and Jane Addams (91 nominations, 1931). Data show that the average number of nominations per Nobel Prize awarded was 17.7, and only 18 of the total 62 laureates exceed this average. At the other extreme there were often prizewinners who had just zero, one, two or three nominations - a highly subjective indicator. We also veriﬁed that there were at least 25 nominations by National Parliaments, there were determinants for some winners. Considering the results presented, it is possible to afﬁrm that Rondon received sufﬁcient nominations to be awarded the Nobel Prize, even not considering Einstein’s letter.

Resumo: Discutimos brevemente uma carta escrita pelo f´ ısico de origem alem˜ a Albert Einstein (1879-1955) ao Comitˆ e Norueguˆ es do Prˆ emio Nobel indicando o oﬁcial militar, ge´ ografo, explorador e paciﬁcador brasileiro Candido Mariano da Silva Rondon (1865-1958). Einstein indicou outros onze cientistas, e todos foram laureados com Prˆ emios Nobel. Tamb´ em analisamos e discutimos os Nomeadores e Nomeados ao Prˆ emio Nobel da Paz desde 1901 at´ e 1964.

INTRODUCTION During a brief stay in Brazil in the city of Rio de Janeiro, the well-know physicist of German origin Albert Einstein (1879 – 1955, Figure 1) wrote a letter to the Norwegian No- bel Committee about the Brazilian military ofﬁcer, geogra- pher, explorer and peacemaker Candido Mariano da Silva Rondon (1865 – 1958, Figure 2) [1]. In his travel diary on May, 11, 1925, Einstein wrote about how really impressed he was with Rondon’s attempts to integrate Indian tribes to civilization without the use of force. He wrote saying: “great cinematic presentation of Indian life and its exemplary devel- opment by General Rondon, a philanthropist and ﬁrst order leader” [1]. He spent more than 50 days in a trip to South America, and visited the Republics of Argentine, Uruguay and Brazil. This letter, written on May 22, 1925, is now at the Einstein Archives Online (http://alberteinstein.info) num- ber 71-113.

I take the liberty to draw your attention to the activities of General Rondon from Rio de Janeiro, since, during my visit to Brazil, I have gained the impression that this man is highly worthy of receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. His work consists of adjusting Indian tribes to civilized world without the use of weapons or coercion. The information I have is based on what I heard from professors at the Higher Technical School in Rio de Janeiro, who spoke with great enthusiasm about the man and about his work. Some things I also have been shown on ﬁlm. Rondon himself, I have not met. I can provide more detailed information if it is your wish, but it would be better if you could get additional information through the Norwegian repre- sentation. With the highest regards, Prof. Dr. A. Einstein Haberlandstr. 5, Berlin Einstein received 62 nominations (45 of them during the period 1910 - 1921 [3]) and was awarded the Nobel Physics"
