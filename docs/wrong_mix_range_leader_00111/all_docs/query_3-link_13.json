The winners list for 2011 was split between three women: Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Leymah Gbowee from Liberia and Tawakkul Karman from Yemen.\n\nThe EU was awarded the prize in recognition of \"over six decades contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe\", and becomes the 25th institution to receive the prize since its creation in 1901.\n\nIt has been an open secret that the challenges currently facing the EU were also taken into account by the awarding panel, whose secretary said the prize was intended to send a message to the European public, urging them \"to secure what they have achieved on this continent\".\n\nThis was also highlighted in the awarding body's official statement:\n\nThe EU is currently undergoing grave economic difficulties and considerable social unrest. The Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to focus on what it sees as the EU's most important result: the successful struggle for peace and reconciliation and for democracy and human rights. The stabilizing part played by the EU has helped to transform most of Europe from a continent of war to a continent of peace\n\nYou can read the full text of the Nobel prize citation here.\n\nThere have now been 125 winners of the peace prize since its inception, and this is how they break down.\n\n• The vast majority are men: 85, compared to 15 women\n\n• In fact there have been more institutions than women - 25 since 1901\n\n• 29 winners are from the US\n\n• Nearly half of all winners have to share their prize - only 54% get to keep it all to themselves\n\nLet us know if we've missed anything - or what you can do with the data.\n\nData summary\n\nDownload the data\n\n• DATA: download the full spreadsheet\n\nWorld government data\n\n• Search the world's government with our gateway\n\nDevelopment and aid data\n\n• Search the world's global development data with our gateway\n\nCan you do something with this data?\n\nFlickr Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our Flickr group"
