Introductions will be rolled out every two weeks.\n\nThe BFI is committed to celebrating women’s contribution to film and TV, both behind and in front of the camera. As well as being a permanent SVOD collection on BFI Player, Woman with a Movie Camera is also the name of a monthly event at BFI Southbank, originally launched on International Women’s Day 2016. In June 2018 and 2019 this culminated in a special annual event at BFI Southbank – the Woman with a Movie Camera Summit. This very popular day-long event, cancelled in 2020 due to the pandemic but returning in 2021, features a keynote speech, a range of talks and discussions led by leading thinkers, programmers and film critics and interactive experiences to watch or take part in."
