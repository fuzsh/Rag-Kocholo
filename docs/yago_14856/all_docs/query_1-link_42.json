        "text": "She is one of the most successful actresses in Hollywood.\n\nAnd, with that, comes an impressive back-catalogue for Michelle Williams - whose box office hits range from Brokeback Mountain to My Week With Marilyn.\n\nYet, while most film fanatics could easily reel-off her best movies, they'd likely omit one classic from their list: Me Without You.\n\nThe 2001 British film, which co-starred Anna Friel, is deemed one of her forgotten projects, yet is simultaneously regarded as one of her best-ever movies.\n\nWe urge you to check it out.\n\nDirected by Sandra Goldbacher, it tells the tale of two best pals - shy and studious Holly (Williams) and competitive, rebellious Marina (Friel) - who have a truly toxic friendship.\n\nIt opens with them making a childhood pact of lifelong loyalty, then tracks the inevitable decline of their kinship against the backdrop of 1980s punk, alternative 90s and, later, the early 2000s.\n\nTogether, they suffer teenage rebellion, fashion fails and romantic heartbreak, while secretly wishing the best - and very worst - for one another.\n\nVisually rich and yet packed with cinematic substance, the movie is kitted out with Stella McCartney clothes, has a killer soundtrack (The Clash, The Stranglers) and also boasts cameos from Sting's wife, Trudie Styler, and Sex and the City's Kyle McClachlan.\n\nIt even has time-capsule references to Charlie perfume and that advert for Hamlet cigars (ask your mum).\n\nBut its ultimately the dual performances of Williams on Friel which seal this little-known gem as a British indie classic.\n\nAnd the critics agree. When it was first released, the Chicago Tribune wrote: \"There is no substitute for on-screen chemistry, and when Friel pulls the strings that make Williams sink into melancholia, the reaction in Williams is as visceral as a gut punch.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Washington post hailed it as \"both illuminating and dispiriting.\"\n\nSadly, upon release, it failed to make much of an impact on the box office - recouping just Â£45,532 on its opening UK weekend and $12,816 stateside.\n\nBut, despite this, it lives on in credibility. Don't miss your second chance to see it on the big screen."
