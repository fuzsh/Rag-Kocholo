        "text": "Sandra Goldbacher grew up outside London in the Hampstead Garden Suburb, the daughter of a Jewish father and a Catholic mother. Her mother converted to Judaism when she was one and Goldbacher received a reform Jewish upbringing. She went to college at Sussex University in the seaside tourist town of Brighton and after studying French Literature for three years, Goldbacher, as many young people often do, had a complete change of heart and realized she wanted to be a filmmaker."
