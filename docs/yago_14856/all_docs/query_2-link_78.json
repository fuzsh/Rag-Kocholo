        "text": "Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 8.\n\nNow Playing\n\n''ARMAGEDDON,'' starring Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler and Steve Buscemi. Directed by Michael Bay (PG-13, 144 minutes). This big, showy, spirit-crushing summer extravaganza includes not a single heartfelt moment, unless you count its sequence set in a strip club. Imminent doom (courtesy of an approaching asteroid) becomes the excuse for rampant flag-waving, gung-ho patriotism and a notion of heroism that has nothing whatever to do with real courage. Mr. Willis gets the film's noblest lines for the same reason that he probably got the set's biggest trailer. Mr. Affleck tries gamely to seem mad about Ms. Tyler, who serves as window dressing at NASA headquarters. Totally predictable elements -- loud noises, frequent explosions and bright computer screen colors -- seem as inevitable and deadly as the asteroid while they create the illusion of escapist fun (Janet Maslin).\n\n''THE AVENGERS,'' starring Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes. Directed by Jeremiah Chechik (PG, 100 minutes). Sometimes major movie studios should be afraid to screen expensive fiascos for the press, but they go ahead anyway. ''The Avengers'' is Warner Brothers' would-be blockbuster that actually had its light hidden beneath a bushel until opening day, and no wonder. With pseudo-suave repartee that would make Austin Powers blush and with so many shades of ''Howard the Duck'' that one scene depicts man-size pastel teddy bears sitting around a conference table, it's a film to gall fans of the old television series and perplex anyone else. I can't remember another Friday morning show where I heard actual cries of ''Ugh!'' on the way out the door (Maslin).\n\n* ''THE CHAMBERMAID ON THE TITANIC,'' starring Olivier Martinez, Aitana Sanchez Gijon and Romane Bohringer. Directed by Bigas Luna (not rated; 96 minutes). A delightful, sexy period fable, adapted from a novel by Didier Decoin. ''Chambermaid'' wittily illustrates the basic human need to consume and spin heroic stories of passion and loss (whether or not they're true). When Horty (Mr. Martinez), a poor French foundry worker, wins a contest that sends him to Southhampton, England, to watch the Titanic depart on its maiden voyage, he takes to his hotel room a woman who claims to be a chambermaid on the ship and has no lodging. After the ship sinks, his co-workers press him about the details, and his fabricated story of an ultimate one-night stand becomes a local myth that eventually catapults him into a show business career telling the same (increasingly embellished) tale over and over. The movie has profound things to say about gossip, storytelling and the primal urge to mythicize personal experience (Stephen Holden).\n\n''DEEP IMPACT,'' starring Robert Duvall, Tea Leoni, Elijah Wood, Vanessa Redgrave, Maximilian Schell and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mimi Leder (PG-13, 120 minutes). Apparently there is no better aid to family therapy than a murderously large meteor hurtling toward Earth. So this is a more sensitive sci-fi disaster film than most, with lovers bonding and old wounds healing as the summer's first colossal cinematic catastrophe looms. This thriller is vigorously made, but it provides less grisly mayhem than might be expected. As the planet faces extinction, attention is paid to rescuing art, antiques, elephants and flamingos. Special-effects wizardry provides a suitably devastating tidal wave (Maslin).\n\n''EVER AFTER: A CINDERELLA STORY,'' starring Drew Barrymore, Anjelica Huston and Dougray Scott. Directed by Andy Tennant (PG-13, 120 minutes). The clever notion of reinventing Cinderella as a self-motivated powerhouse who doesn't need a fairy godmother to get ahead has been reduced into a bland mishmash of comedy and soap opera. Drew Barrymore is appealing as Danielle, a plucky, resourceful, slightly tomboyish 16th-century French girl who knows how to stand up for herself. But her wimpish prince (Mr. Scott) isn't much of a prize to crow over. And why is Leonardo da Vinci (Patrick Godfrey) traipsing around France with the ''Mona Lisa'' under his arm, giving advice to the lovelorn? The most orthodox refugee from the standard fairy tale is Ms. Huston's haughty stepmother (Holden).\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
