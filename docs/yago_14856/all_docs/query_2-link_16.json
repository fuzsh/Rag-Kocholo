For Marina, troubled, fiercely independent, determined to try everything, Holly stays the only constant in a life of divorcing parents, experimental drugs and fashionable self-destruction. But for Holly, a friendship that has never been equal gradually starts to feel like a trap.",

        "text": "What this movie does wrong, it does really wrong. While it's supposed to be about two sides of a faltering friendship, it really ends up capturing just one. There is a tragic, compelling story about Marina that we don't ever get to see because the movie is too in love with Holly. Their concurrent affairs with their professor, Daniel, capture it perfectly without ever stopping to ask the more interesting questions about it. Daniel immediately puts them in a virgin/whore dichotomy: Holly is the intelligent, profound, innocent girl he seems to almost love, while he sees glamorous Marina as a vapid, wild fling that he can use to both reconnect with youth and feel superior to it. Daniel doesn't take…\n\nMarina is manipulative, selfish and controlling and Holly is both her best friend and her victim.\n\nThe girls had little in common from the moment we met them but due to Marina's clinginess they stick together for 10+ years, through the awkward teens up until their mid 20s. The girls seem to resent each other for possessing qualities that they themselves are lacking. Holly is jealous of Marina's looks and fun-loving attitude and of course her ability to make any man want her whereas Marina is jealous of Holly's depth, her intelligence, her \"realness\".\n\nMarina being empty, shallow, maybe even a little broken is touched upon throughout and as awful as she is I couldn't help but feel some sympathy.…"
