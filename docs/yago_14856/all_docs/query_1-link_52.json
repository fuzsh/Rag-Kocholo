        "text": "Sandra Goldbacher has followed up her confident, distinctive debut The Governess with this enjoyable, feelgood comedy: a bittersweet tale of two best friends who grow up amongst the ever-changing pop culture of the 1970s and 1980s. Dawson's Creek star Michelle Williams does a very good English accent as Holly, the bookish Jewish girl who has an intense relationship with her sexier best mate Marina: Anna Friel, who journeys further into shriekingly neurotic AbFab mode as her character gets older. (Stella McCartney is thanked in the closing credits for \"Chloe\".) There are many nicely observed touches, but nothing too obvious: no Spacehoppers, thank heavens. We get strong, sympathetic supporting turns from Allan Corduner, as Holly's gentle, understanding dad, and Trudie Styler as Marina's mutton-dressed-as-trendy-lamb mum. It's impossible not to like a film with Wreckless Eric's Whole Wide World on the soundtrack."
