Growing up from grade-school confidantes into half-ass punks in Thatcher-era London and then finally into semi-lost twentysomethings, best friends Holly (Williams) and Marina (Friel) survive two decades of codependency, but just barely. With an ethereal palette and lyrical score cut from the same cloth as Sofia Coppola's Virgin Suicides, Goldbacher's BAFTA-nominated film is a melancholy, yet humorous look at what happens when best friends break up. Friel and Williams (of Dawson's Creek) are exceptional as the two girls struggling to nail down an identity independent of the other."
