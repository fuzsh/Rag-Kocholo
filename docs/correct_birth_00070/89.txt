Robbie Williams is COMING HOME!

The Great Showman will play a special homecoming stadium show 'Robbie Williams - He's Coming Home' in Stoke on Trent next year, it has been announced.

The Take That and Angels star will play his first ever show at Port Vale FC's Vale Park Stadium on Saturday June 20, 2020.

Williams was born very close to the stadium and has always wanted to play there.

'Robbie Williams - He's Coming Home' will be in aid of three charities - The Donna Louise Children's Hospice Trust, Unicef UK and The Hubb Foundation.

Early ticket access is available to UK fans who purchase (or have already purchased) Robbie’s new album ‘The Christmas Present’ from the official Robbie Williams store before 6pm GMT next Thursday, December, 5.

Early access code and instructions will be emailed before 6pm GMT on Friday December, 6.

Williams, who was given the Freedom of Stoke-on-Trent in 2014, said of his home city: “ Stoke-on-Trent made me. My heart, my humour, it’s all from Stoke. Cut me and it’s through me like a stick of rock.”

“It has always been an ambition of mine to play a show at Port Vale and I’m delighted that now it’s actually going to happen.

"This is like the best Christmas present of all for me! I want to continue to help raise money for charities in the Stoke community, and to help children grow up happy, healthy and able to play.

"This event will be able to do just that and I’m proud to be doing this in aid of The Donna Louise, Unicef and The Hubb Foundation.”

Carol Shanahan, co-owner of Port Vale FC, said today: “ When we took over at Port Vale just over six months ago, our aim was to create a place and atmosphere that would bring people to the football club and be a shining light in the heart of the community. To be asked to host such a magnificent event instils us with enormous pride and together, working with the Stoke-on-Trent community, we are delighted to welcome Robbie back home, to Port Vale Football Club.”
