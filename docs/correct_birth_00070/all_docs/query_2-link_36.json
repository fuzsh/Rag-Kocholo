Life is too fast there. I grew up too fast.\n\n\"There are too many ways to grow up even quicker. We want to avoid that.\n\n“I don’t want to be in England all year round either. I’m just too famous there. I wish I could be as safe in my bubble as my kids are in theirs.\n\n“So the rest of the world remains for us. We haven’t decided where we want to live yet, but the question is on our minds.\"\n\nRobbie longs to find a place in the sun, but Ayda, 43, isn't keen.\n\nHe added: “I would like to live in the Bahamas, but my wife doesn’t at all.\n\n“I love the heat there, I love summer, I love beaches and I love looking out on to the sea.\n\n\"I’m just a lot happier in the sun than in the European winter.”\n\nThe 49-year-old star previously admitted settling on a place to live was tough because of having to juggle the needs of his children and his own career.\n\nSpeaking to Australian radio hosts Kyle and Jackie O last year, he said: \"We’re actually nowhere.\n\n\"We haven’t got an abode right now, we’ve pretty much sold everywhere, we don’t live anywhere and we’re trying to figure it out.\n\n\"The four kids are constantly a Rubix Cube puzzle that we’re trying to sort out because if they are schooled then they don’t see me because I’m all over the place and if they are home-schooled then they have another set of things that are a problem.\""
