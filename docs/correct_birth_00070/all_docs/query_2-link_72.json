        "text": "Robbie Williams is a pop singer-songwriter from Stoke-on-Trent.\n\nStarting his music career in 1990 as a member of Take That, the group released three hugely successful albums before Williams left to pursue a solo career. He put out his debut, 'Life Thru A Lens', in 1997. He has gone on to record over 10 albums, with his most recent full-length release being 2022's 'XXV'.\n\nHe rejoined Take That in 2010 and lent his vocals to three more studio albums. Although still a member of the band, he did choose not to feature on their seventh and eighth studio albums in order to focus on his solo career.\n\nHe has won 17 BRIT awards, sold over 77 million albums worldwide, and played massive shows all over the world.\n\nRobbie Williams will headline BST Hyde Park in July 2024. Catch him live by checking tour dates and ticket information on Stereoboard.\n\nYou can track Robbie Williams tour dates, find out about presales and get ticket price alerts!
