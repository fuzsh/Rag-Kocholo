        "text": "Famous worldwide for his catchy and entertaining songs, Robbie Williams has become an icon of British pop music. It's no secret around Stoke-on-Trent that the pop legend came from humble beginnings in Burslem.\n\nWe have taken a deep delve into the life of the Angels hitmaker, including his lush living arrangements, huge net worth and celebrity wife. Also below are details of Robbie's future plans - including a massive homecoming gig at his beloved Vale Park.\n\nREAD MORE: Robbie Williams is coming home - Everything you need to know about his Vale Park gig\n\nWhere did Robbie Williams grow up?\n\nHe grew up living at the Red Lion pub, Burslem, which, until recently, bore a mural of the singer on the front. There, Robbie became a life-long supporter of Port Vale FC.\n\nHis migration away from the area started when, aged just 16, he became the youngest member of boy band Take That in 1990. He found fame with the band, staying with them for his first stint until 1995.\n\nHow many records has Robbie Williams sold?\n\nRobbie achieved huge success as a solo artist, starting with debut record Life Thru a Lens in 1997 and selling 77 million records worldwide. Despite his solo success, which has included sold-out tours all over the world and several UK number-one singles and albums, he reunited with Take That in 2010.\n\nWhat's next for Robbie Williams?\n\nNow 48, Robbie is now set to return for a gig in his home town. He will play at Vale Park - Port Vale's home ground - on June 4, 2022.\n\nA biopic of the former Take That star is also now in the works. Filming has been taking place in Australia, with Robbie set to play himself for certain parts and former Hollyoaks star Jonno Davies to play \"young Robbie\".\n\nThe film - Better Man - will look at Robbie's personal life and rise to stardom - including his problems battling mental health problems, as well as alcohol and drug addictions. The film is being directed by Greatest Showman director Michael Gracey.\n\nRobbie is also expected to keep indulging his interest in UFOs. The pop star once made a documentary with BBC Radio 4 exploring the possibilities of extraterrestrial life and the many theories which surround encounters with the unknown.\n\nWho is Robbie Williams married to?\n\nRobbie married model, actress and Loose Women panellist Ayda Field in 2010. The pair now have four children together.\n\nRobbie revealed in an interview with Jonathan Ross how he is a different man at home to the cocky character fans see on stage. He said: \"At home I'm Rob. When I'm on stage I'm Robbie. People confuse me with the guy that gets on stage and gives it the big one. I wouldn't be able to get away with that at home.\"\n\nHe also admitted he broke up with her three times - without telling her - in the early part of their relationship, when he was still battling addiction problems. He told You Magazine he slept with his drug dealer the night he met Ayda, 42.\n\nWhere does Robbie Williams live?\n\nRobbie has swapped Burslem for the high life in mansions around the world. They include one in Kensington. In 2016, he moved into £17 million Woodland House.\n\nWhen staying there, he lives among rock music royalty, recently getting into a spat with his neighbour - Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Paige - over planning proposals on his property. Robbie's renovations, including an underground swimming pool, will begin in spring 2022.\n\nEarlier this year, Robbie sparked controversy when he claimed he had \"nowhere to live\" after selling a raft of properties, including a £6.75m \"mega mansion\" in Compton Bassett, Wiltshire, and his £37 million LA pad. He has also sold his Alpine villa on the shore of Lake Geneva for £24 million.\n\nHowever, he and Ayda recently invested around £40 million in a new pad in Holmby Hills, LA. The estate includes a main house and three separate guest houses\n\nOffering plenty of room for the couple and their children - Teddy, nine, Charlton, seven, Coco, three, and Beau, two - it includes an outdoor pool, tennis court, chef's kitchen, library and fitness centre.\n\nWhat is Robbie Williams' net worth?\n\nAs of 2022, Robbie's net worth is estimated at $300 million, or just under £240 million. At one point he was also the largest shareholder of Port Vale football club, before the club went into administration in 2012.\n\nNEWSLETTER: Sign up for email alerts to StaffordshireLive straight to your inbox here\n\nREAD MORE: Robbie Williams concert: Where to eat and drink in Burslem before Vale Park gig"
