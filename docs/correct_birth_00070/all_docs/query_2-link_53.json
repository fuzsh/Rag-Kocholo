        "text": "He's had a varied career!\n\nRobbie Williams was the first member of Take That to embark on a solo career, and he became an international superstar who is the very personification of pop music. The singer has released 12 studio albums - 11 of which went to Number 1 - as well as scoring seven Number 1 singles and 31 Top 10 singles!\n\nDespite reuniting with Take That a couple of times, Robbie's solo career continues to flourish and it's clear he isn't stopping anytime soon - especially after embarking on a world tour and releasing an album called 'XXV'! To celebrate, we've decided to take a look at the pop star's life from his early beginnings as a cheeky teenager to an X Factor judge and beyond.\n\nWhere’s Robbie Williams from?\n\nRobbie wasn’t always the roguish pop star we’ve come to know and love. Robbie was born in Stoke-on-Trent on 13th February 1974, making him currently 50-years-old. His dad, Peter Williams, also known as Pete Conway, is a former comedian. You can see why Robbie was drawn to showbiz!\n\nRobbie Williams in Take That\n\nRobbie Williams, along with Gary Barlow, Mark Owen, Howard Donald, Jason Orange, joined Take That when Robbie was just 16-years-old, making him the youngest member of the group when they formed in 1989.\n\nRight from the beginning, he was known as the joker in the pack; extroverted and fun, he loved practical jokes, so it was little wonder that he was the most popular member of the mega-successful group.\n\nAfter his departure in 1995, when he shocked the music world and his fans, he made a name for himself as a solo pop star with songs such as 'Rock DJ' and 'Millennium'.\n\nWhich Take That songs did Robbie sing the lead on?\n\nEven though Gary Barlow wrote and performed on most of Take That’s hits, it was Robbie who took the lead vocals on ‘Could It Be Magic’, ‘I Found Heaven’ and ‘Everything Changes’.\n\nWhy did he leave Take That?\n\nThere were all sorts of reasons why Robbie left Take That, but it boiled down to a few crucial factors. He was unhappy with being told what to do by the group’s management. There were the usual musical differences, and tensions began to escalate in the band when Robbie started to miss rehearsals due to his excessive partying. He quit Take That in July 1995.\n\nRobbie Williams’ early solo success\n\nRobbie’s first two singles, a cover of George Michael’s ‘Freedom’ and his own ‘Old Before I Die’, both hit Number 2 in the UK singles chart. Amazingly, his next singles, ‘Angels’ and ‘Let Me Entertain You’ only made it to Number 4 and 3 in the charts, but there was plenty of consolation to be had, knowing that the former went Platinum twice and the latter Gold.\n\nThe parent album, ‘Life Thru A Lens’ has gone to sell over four million copies worldwide and has been certified 8x Platinum in the UK.\n\nHis second album, ‘I’ve Been Expecting You’, was released in October 1998 and it entered the charts at Number 1. The album’s first single, ‘Millennium’, sampled the James Bond theme tune and became Robbie's first solo Number 1 single in the United Kingdom. ‘She’s The One’ also hit the top spot.\n\nWATCH: Robbie Williams - 'She's The One' (Official Video)\n\nRobbie's superstardom\n\nRobbie hit superstardom when, in 2003, he played to some 125,000 on each of the three nights that he played at Knebworth. To put that into some kind of context, those audiences were bigger than the ones for Queen, Led Zeppelin and Oasis!\n\nHe’s also won 12 solo BRIT Awards including Best British Single for ‘Angels’, ‘She’s The One’, and ‘Rock DJ’ as well as Best British Male Solo Artist in 2001, 2002 and 2003. It’s little wonder when the albums Robbie was releasing during that period were ‘Sing When You’re Winning’ and its jazz sister record ‘Swing When You’re Winning’ as well as ‘Escapology’.\n\nDuring that period, he also scored Number 1 singles with ‘Rock DJ’ and ‘Somethin’ Stupid’, a duet with Nicole Kidman.\n\nWATCH: The music video to 'Somethin’ Stupid'\n\nRobbie's swing album\n\nRobbie Williams’s fourth album 'Swing When You're Winning' in 2001 was a highly successful collection of swing covers of artists such as Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole among others. Going straight to Number 1, it was swiftly followed by the DVD version of his 2001 swing gig at the Royal Albert Hall, which went 6 x Platinum in the UK alone!\n\nHe followed it up in 2013 with a second swing album, ‘Swings Both Ways’, a mix of standards and originals. Did you see what he did there? Anyway, it featured a heap of guest appearances including Lily Allen, Olly Murs, Rufus Wainwright, Kelly Clarkson, and Michael Bublé.\n\nWhat is Robbie Williams' most recent album?\n\nRobbie released compilation album 'XXV' in September 2022 to celebrate 25 years of being a solo artist. The album features re-recorded and newly orchestrated versions of his greatest hits recorded with the Metropole Orchestra, with a few surprises.\n\nIs Robbie Williams on tour?\n\nIn 2022, Robbie embarked on his 'The XXV Tour' in support of the record of the same name. The tour took him across the world, with shows across Europe, Australasia, the UK and Ireland.\n\nAfter announcing an initial seven dates across the UK in October, he added another three dates, and went on to reschedule one of his Glasgow shows.\n\nWhile on tour in the UK in August 2023 he brought out Mark Owen for a mini reunion on stage, where the pair performed the Take That song 'Greatest Day'.\n\nWhile on tour in Budapest, Robbie picked out a fan from the crowd. He later posted about the gig saying that he had picked the same fan 20 years before! He shared details on Instagram, along with two photos of him with the fan saying: 'So this happened two nights ago in Budapest - I chose someone from the audience to come down to the front and, amazingly, I chose the same guy that I picked out from the audience in Budapest 20 years ago!\n\n'The odds of that happening? 174,240,000 to 1. Nice to see you again, sir. Love from Rob x'.\n\nDid Robbie Williams reunite with Take That?\n\nYes he did! Robbie returned to Take That in 2010 and then left again when they took a break the following year. Concentrating on his solo career, he released the albums ‘Take The Crown’ in 2012 and then ‘The Heavy Entertainment Show’ in 2016.\n\nDespite reuniting with Take That briefly over the years, Robbie has continued to be a successful solo artist, however 2018 saw him move onto the role of a judge on The X Factor alongside his wife Ayda Williams, One Direction's Louis Tomlinson and Simon Cowell.\n\nWhen did Robbie Williams reunite with Take That for Compare The Meerkat?\n\nRobbie reunited with Take That for a one-off virtual concert on Friday 29th May 2020! The gig took place on both Compare The Meerkat's Facebook page and YouTube page.\n\nIn a statement, the band said, \"This is a world first for us. Reuniting with our old friend online for a one-off performance! It’s always great getting back together with Robbie and we are really excited to be part of this unique show that everyone can enjoy from home.\"\n\nWhen was Robbie Williams on The X Factor?\n\nRobbie joined The X Factor panel as a judge for the 2018 series of the show, alongside his wife Ayda Field, former One Direction star Louis Tomlinson and Simon Cowell. Robbie made it through to the semi-finals with the groups, with his final group Acacia & Aaliyah being eliminated.\n\nLouis' act Dalton Harris eventually won the series in the Boys category, with Simon's act Scarlett Lee coming second and Louis' other act Anthony Russell coming in third. Robbie and Ayda announced their decision to step back from the show in April 2019, taking to Instagram with a photo of the pair.\n\nThey wrote: 'Sadly though it’s impossible to do everything … and we’re gutted to tell you we won’t be able to return to The X Factor this year. We will, however, be working on projects with Simon going forward - and as huge fans of the show, we will still be tuning into The X Factor, voting and winding Simon up…x'\n\nHas Robbie Williams done any film work?\n\nRobbie voiced Dougal in the film version of the popular kids’ TV show The Magic Roundabout. It also starred the vocal talents of Kylie Minogue, who he'd previously worked with on 2000 track 'Kids'.\n\nThe Robbie Williams documentary\n\nIn August 2022, Netflix announced they would be doing a documentary about Robbie. It includes 25 years' worth of intimate, never-before-seen archive footage as well as exclusive access to the 'Angels' singer.\n\nThe documentary landed on the streaming platform in November 2023.\n\nWhat else does Robbie Williams have planned for the future?\n\nIn an interview with The Telegraph, Robbie revealed he has a lot of plans for the future including another album inspired by 1995, a TV show, his own clothing line and building a hotel!\n\nIn January 2023, he was announced to be the new voice of cat food company Purina, performing new song 'It’s Great To Be a Cat' for the new campaign. He said: \"The cat is out of the bag, I’m the new voice of Felix. I’ve been a long-time fan of cats, I’ve had many feline friends over the years and after studying their fascinating behaviour, I can confidently say, It’s Great To Be a Cat.\"\n\nFamily life\n\nRobbie Williams and actress Ayda Williams (née Field) have been together since 2006 after meeting on a blind date. They wed in 2010 and their daughter, Theodora ‘Teddy’ Rose was born in 2012 and their son, Charlton ‘Charlie’ Valentine was born two years later. Daughter Coco and son Beau were both born via surrogate in 2018 and 2020 respectively.\n\nNow take a look at Robbie's greatest moment in pictures:\n\nWATCH: Robbie Williams celebrates his incredible and unmatched career\n\nYou can hear Robbie Williams' songs on Magic.\n\nRead more:\n\nRobbie Williams' biggest career moments\n\n10 of Robbie Williams' biggest songs of all time\n\nTake That: Everything you need to know about the 90s heartthrobs\n\nHow to listen to Magic:\n\nFrom Ed Sheeran to ABBA, and Take That to Madonna, Magic Radio plays more of the songs you love!
