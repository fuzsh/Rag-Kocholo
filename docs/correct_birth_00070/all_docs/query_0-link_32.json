Pricing and availability are subject to change.\n\nRobbie Williams has announced another 10,000 tickets will go on sale for his stadium show at Stoke's Vale Park.\n\nThe gig, which takes place on 4 June, will be his first ever hometown concert and has been delayed for two years because of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nTickets for the concert will go on sale from 10am on Friday 6 May and can be purchased from the singer's official website. Tickets that were originally bought in 2020 remain valid for this performance.\n\nWilliams has said it has always been an ambition of his to play Vale Park with more than 20,000 spectators expected to attend.\n\nThe 'Angels' singer said in a statement: \"It's been a long wait since we announced the show back in 2020, but I know it will be worth it when I finally walk out on to the pitch at Vale Park.\"\n\nHe also praised his hometown: \"Stoke-on-Trent made me. My heart, my humour, it's all from Stoke. Cut me and it's through me like a stick of rock.\"\n\nThe former Take That member is also using the concert to raise money for various charities. Williams said: \"I want to continue to help raise money for charities in Stoke-on-Trent's communities, and to help children grow up happy, healthy and able to play. This event will be able to do just that, and I'm proud to be doing this in aid of The Donna Louise, Unicef and The Hubb Foundation.\"\n\nWilliams has not toured since 2018 but played a Las Vegas residency in 2019 at the Encore Theatre.\n\nThe 2018 tour saw him play various stadiums across the world including the Etihad in Manchester which was sold out with over 90,000 people in attendance.\n\nThe tour concluded in November 2019 with a performance at a Mexico City racetrack.\n\nBuy tickets when they go on sale at 10am on Friday 6 May"
