        "text": "I’m loving Sydney instead...\n\nRobbie Williams has committed the ultimate concert faux pas during his return to the stage at Melbourne’s AAMI Park Wednesday night as part of his headline-making Australian tour.\n\nThe British rocker, 49, enjoyed a few days off performing after his sell-out show in Sydney last Thursday, but it appears Williams forgot he boarded a plane further south during the week.\n\nAmping up the Melbourne crowd amid his dance hit Rock DJ, Williams screamed into the microphone, “Sydney, do you rock harder...” he paused mid-sentence amid groans from the audience.\n\nSalvaging the situation swiftly, Williams clarified, “Melbourne, do you rock harder than Sydney?!”\n\nIt’s not the first time Melbourne has been snubbed by international stars during their Aussie tours.\n\nGuns N’ Roses incensed Vic fans during the band’s tour in 2017, referring to the crowd as “Sydney” during their welcome speech, before later apologising for the grave error on social media:\n\nBack in 2010, the late George Michael made the same flub in Melbourne, encouraging the “Sydney” audience to sing with him, not once, but twice. The second mistake triggered a groundswell of Melburnians chanting the city’s name out loud.\n\nThe British singer apologised to locals, adding, “After 114 shows you definitely have the last show. I can’t think of a better place to do this.” Elsewhere during Williams’ show, he paid touching tribute to the woman who died following his Sydney concert last Thursday.\n\nThe star expressed his heartfelt condolences to the family of Robyn Hall, who suffered a fall at the rocker’s Sydney show at Allianz Stadium a week ago.\n\nMs Hall, who was in her 70s, was rushed to St Vincent’s Hospital after the concert, where she was put in an induced coma. She was pronounced dead on Monday.\n\nIn audio from Williams’ Melbourne show obtained by Melbourne’s 101.9 The Fox, the performer said Ms Hall’s death had broken his heart.\n\n“I’ve been thinking about it an awful lot and I’ve thought about it through the show tonight,” Williams said to a packed audience.\n\n“I just want to give a big shout out and lots of love from me and my band to Robyn and Robyn’s family.\n\n“Let’s all sing up, she was somebody just like you who came to the gig just like you did tonight, this is for her.”\n\nWilliams then began singing his hit 1997 song, Angels, in honour of Ms Hall.\n\nIt comes after the woman had fallen down six rows of seats during Williams’ last concert at Moore Park.\n\nHer son Michael Hall shared a tribute to her on Facebook on Tuesday saying he had lost his “best friend”.\n\n“I haven’t got the words to say what my mum meant to me,” he said.\n\n“Taken from under me and my best friend is no longer with me … I love you forever.”\n\nIt is understood Ms Hall had been climbing over chairs at the end of Williams’ show before she slipped and fell.\n\nThe sold-out show kicked off just after 7pm and had wrapped by about 10pm when the 40,000 fans began making their way to the exit.\n\nParamedics were called to the stadium about 10.15pm, where they treated Ms Hall for serious head and face injuries before transporting her to hospital.\n\nWilliams will perform in Melbourne again Thursday night as part of his XXV Australian Tour, before heading to wineries in Geelong, Adelaide and then Western Australia’s Swan Valley to wrap his tour."
