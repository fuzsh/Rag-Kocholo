        "text": "Robbie Williams is an English singer-songwriter, and occasional actor born in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. He is a member of the pop group Take That, but has found greater commercial success as a solo artist.\n\nWilliams rose to fame in the band's first run in the early- to mid-1990s. After many disagreements with the management and group members, Williams left the group in 1995 to launch a hugely successful solo career, which saw his first seven albums each reach number one in the UK. Williams also released seven number-one singles and found similar success across Europe. On 15 July 2010, it was announced he had rejoined Take That. The group's subsequent album became the second fastest-selling album in UK chart history and the fastest-selling record of the century so far. He continues to perform both as a member of Take That and as a solo artist."
