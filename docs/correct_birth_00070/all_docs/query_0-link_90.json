        "text": "Robbie Williams, from Stoke-on-Trent, isn’t just a singer with a wonderfully flexible voice capable of dazzlingly singing not just his own songs but others in every style from Queen to Frank Sinatra. He is also one of the most brilliant entertainers around today. The audience at Lucca’ Piazza Napoleone were utterly captivated by him and Robbie was amazed at how well a largely Italian audience of 16,000 knew his songs by heart.\n\nWe clearly were taken in by the electric atmosphere, the sheer energy of the evening. I’d managed to get our tickets month ago. The price, which at the time I felt was a bit high at 70 euros, was worth every centesimo I decided by the evening’s end.\n\nWith a blond punky hair crest and dressed in black, Robbie was greeted by ecstatic applause and scream to the background of Carl Orff’s O Fortuna. Then followed virtually without a break the best of Robbie’s repertoire: Let me entertain you, Rock DJ, Monsoon, Come Undone, The road to Mandalay, Minnie the Moocher. Ignition was sung beautifully a Capella and was followed by She’s the one and Supreme.\n\nIn we will rock you Robbie invited a certain Francesca, one of his most devoted fans on stage and it must have been like a surreal dream when he invited her to sing with him in a number in which he asked if she would like to come to bed with him (a virtual bed, of course, projected on the absolutely beautifully choreographed stage lighting) and kissed her with the loudest applause from the public.\n\nUnlike those dismal pop concert I remember in the UK, the hot steamy evening temperature was just not the only factor working in our favour, not just the wonderful scenographic piazza Napoleone with its backcloth not just of the stage but of the ducal palace, but it was above all the sheer mix of the audience from six, to sixteen year old, and all the way up the scale to our undisclosable age.\n\nIndeed, one of the most moving moments was when Robbie, now at 41 a family man with two kids and the ‘bad boy days’ with Take that a long way behind him, invited his suited and booted dad on stage singing with him the first song his dad had taught him. It was truly a touch of absolute genius, in a way reminding me of Pavarotti and his dad singing together.\n\nI was still waiting for the song which melts my heart as strongly as any of the great Puccini arias in his own city. But first we heard an absolutely beautiful rendering of Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody, before Angel appeared, At this stage we were truly in that angelic heaven but then Robbie William, ever the superbly timed entertainer, brought in some Karaoke in the form of Sinatra’s My Way.\n\nI’ve been to quite a few Lucca summer festival events but this one in my opinion topped them all – yes above, Clapton, above Cohen, above Dylan above Lisa Minelli even above the Lucca-ubiquitous Elton John, prodigious as they all are.\n\nRobbie Williams is a truly international star at his best. He had the audience feeding out of his hand so much so that there was absolutely no pushing or shoving, no drunkenness, no impatience. All we wanted was to have a great evening in the company of one of the world’ greats and we got it many, many times over. Among the VIP’s there was even Helena Bonham-Carter whose husband Tim Burton was in charge of the show’s choreography which had even the lovely plane trees in the Piazza dancing with lights.\n\nRobbie said how much he liked Lucca and its inhabitants and, surely, the Luccans were totally in love with Robbie that evening and had been for such a long time before.\n\nI don’t know how, but we did get home that evening, so warm that I was still wearing shorts and a t-shirt on my scooter when it was well-past midnight."
