        "text": "Robbie Williams, the renowned pop sensation and former Take That star, is facing financial challenges as he grapples with the upkeep of his three extravagant homes. Despite an estimated fortune of £222 million, Williams has revealed that maintaining his residences in London, Los Angeles, and Switzerland has become prohibitively expensive, prompting him to consider streamlining his property portfolio.\n\nManagement becomes a problem\n\nIn a candid discussion on Rob Brydon's podcast, Williams confessed, 'It's too big, it's too expensive. We've created a life and a lifestyle that is too big for us.' The singer acknowledged that the acquisitions were 'out of control' and reflected on the common trend in the entertainment industry where individuals aspire to various ventures without anticipating the overwhelming consequences.\n\nAs per The Express, the Williams family primarily resides in their opulent £17.5 million mansion, Woodland House, located in Kensington, West London. The Swiss property, acquired for £24 million in 2021, served as a relocation haven during the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite these substantial assets, Williams admitted, 'Everything's just a bit out of control,' signaling a need for financial recalibration.\n\nIn a surprising revelation, Williams shared his doubts about the longevity of his marriage to American actress Ayda Field, with whom he shares four children. Brydon remarked on their 18-year union, to which Williams responded, 'Dude, I would not have put money on it.' The couple's podcast, At Home with the Williams, had previously delved into the challenges they faced in the early stages of their relationship, with Ayda disclosing moments of uncertainty.\n\nBizarre feud with a famous neighbor\n\nBeyond his domestic concerns, Williams is currently embroiled in a feud with neighbor Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin over an extensive 'super basement' project. According to The Mirror, the £17 million London home's renovation includes an indoor pool, gym, and underground passage, sparking tensions between the two music icons. Despite the discord, Williams has implemented measures, such as a traffic management plan and the use of specific construction tools, to minimize disruptions and vibrations during the 46-week construction period.\n\nIn an effort to alleviate financial strain, Williams recently sold two of his luxurious properties, generating a total of £44.95 million. The sales included a seven-bedroom Wiltshire estate and a ten-bedroom Beverly Hills mansion, with rapper Drake acquiring the latter for £38.2 million. Furthermore, the couple listed their £24 million Swiss mansion and invested in a £49.5 million Holmby Hills property in June, as per The Radio Times.\n\nAs if navigating through these property dynamics weren't enough, Williams and Ayda are the subjects of a new Netflix documentary, Robbie Williams, providing an intimate look into the pop icon's life, including his rise to fame, struggles with mental health and addiction, and enduring marriage to Ayda Field. Director Joe Pearlman described the documentary as 'one of the most raw and honest portrayals of a celebrity's life,' featuring testimonials from those closest to Williams, including Ayda.\n\nThe renowned artist, born on February 13, 1974, in Stoke-on-Trent, skyrocketed to fame as a teenage heartthrob with Take That in the early 1990s before embarking on a highly successful solo career. With chart-topping hits like Angels, Millennium, and Rock DJ, Williams has left an indelible mark on the music industry, earning him a record-setting 18 Brit Awards and a reputation as one of the best-selling music artists worldwide, with over 75 million records sold.\n\nRead more:\n\n⋙ Robbie Williams and Ayda Field have an 'unconventional relationship', here's why\n\n⋙ Robbie Williams: What is the singer's property portfolio?\n\n⋙ Robbie Williams opens up about relationship with Geri Halliwell over 20 years ago"
