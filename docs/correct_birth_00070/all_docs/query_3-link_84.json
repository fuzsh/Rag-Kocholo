        "text": "September 8, 2011\n\nBeautiful. Not your usual biography - as far as Robbie and Chris Heath are concerned, that's what Feel is for. This book is more an anecdotes-by-pictures kind of book. Many, many pictures, and Robbie comments on all of them. Pics from the last 20 years - Pics that are widely known, pics that are rare, pics never seen before. Public and private pics; Robbie @ Take That, Robbie solo, Robbie with friends, family, celebs, his dogs, Robbie, fully bearded, during his time out. It's all in here, all presented in a very beautiful way and, I mentioned it before, all commented by Robbie, in his unique and wonderful style. This is definitely a book I will browse through again and again.\n\n[Weirdly enough, I got the German copy of this book - I think it was published before the English version? Or I was too dumb to get the English version back then? Don't remember, I just needed to have this book ASAP, because it makes a beautiful coffee table book, if nothing else, and mostly, it's Robbie, so my mind went into \"gimme gimme gimme\" mode, conditioned by 17 years of being a Robbie fan. Anyway, thing is, while I usually prefer to read the original voice, especially with something as autobiographical as this one, with Robbie, it didn't matter that much that I was dealing with a translation. I may read it in German, but my mind translated it into Robbie's voice, talking English, all on its own. Again, conditioned by 17 years. I just totally know what he's saying ;)]\n\nJuly 28, 2023\n\nOnly took me a few hours to read wasn’t long, I enjoyed it even though it is now 13 years old so a bit out of date and a lot has happened since then, but what nice to read about his most famous years and cool to know after this he got back with take that and that was massive, love Robbie hope he keeps going he still is in 2023 good, nice easy thoughtful read.\n\nApril 12, 2018\n\nA nice enough photo book with pleasant enough captions. Took less than two hours to read through.\n\nJanuary 26, 2011\n\nI should really make my confession here and now: I really like Robbie Williams, so of course I was going to buy this book. I have read Feel (his autobiography released some years ago) and thoroughly enjoyed it. What’s not to like about a man who says things like ‘I want to learn how to play the Effexor’? (Like most medical jokes, that one is not even remotely funny).\n\nYou Know Me is predominantly a photographic book of the first twenty (yes, twenty!) years of Robbie’s career from Take That to solo to Take That again. It is divided into chapters with several pages of text, then photos and Robbie’s take on them. Robbie is still amusing as ever and Chris Heath has a talent in getting the reader into (what we think at least) the mind of the real Robbie. It’s an easy read, be wannabe Mrs Williams’s beware: there are multiple references to his ‘missus’, Ayda Field. (My take: as long as you’re happy Robbie).\n\nThe photos are fantastic – Robbie in Egypt with beard (completely unrecognisable), photos on tour (some good memories) and the text gives insight into what was going on.\n\nThis is for the fans, but it’s an enjoyable, light holiday read.\n\nJune 9, 2011\n\nIch würde mich wirklich nicht als großen Robbie Williams Fan bezeichnen, aber ich liebe Biographien und irgendwie hat mich schon immer fasziniert, wie aus dem Boygroup-Robbie der megaerfolgreiche Solo-Robbie geworden ist. Nicht zu vergessen die Drogen-Eskapen zwischendurch und sein inzwischen sesshaftes Leben mit seiner Frau Ayda.\n\nDie Biographie war etwas ungewöhnlich, da zum Großteil Bilder mit Anekdoten aus Robbies Leben versehen wurden. Es war also nur teilweise eine chronologische Abfolge, aber trotzdem sehr unterhaltsam. Ich habe festgestellt, dass Robbie Williams wirklich ein cooler Kerl ist und ich wünsche ihm von Herzen, dass er nicht nochmal so tief abstürzt.\n\nSeptember 6, 2013\n\nI have been a Robbie Williams fan for over 20 years now, so it was really a suprise that I got this book as a belated birthday present last week and had not read it. My friend was pleased, of course.\n\nNeedless to say, I quickly finished it (it's mostly about the pictures) and enjoyed the photo safari through the 20 years of Mister Williams thoroughly. His comments are quite honest, sometimes a bit disturbing and often hilarious. Many things are already known to long time fans like me, but still, nice read and great pictures!\n\nPerfect gift :-)\n\nJanuary 9, 2012\n\nI am a big Robbie Williams fan for half of my life, so this book was a must. And I really liked it. You get to see lots of pictures from Rob's life and Chris Heath wrote down what Rob told ihm about the pictures. So it's the closest to \"watching pictures with Rob\" you'll get as a fan.\n\nSeptember 10, 2012\n\nIt is what it is, a picture book. It's nothing like Chris Heath's original fly on the wall book Feel, but it does offer a small insight into an up to date Robbie so for that fact alone, if you're a Robbie fan, it's worth getting.\n\nOtherwise don't bother.\n\nOctober 28, 2014\n\nNot much of a story to b honest but the amazing pics make it worth while a must for robbie fans\n\nFebruary 20, 2014\n\nmehr Bildband als Buch aber trotzdem toll. Robbie halt."
