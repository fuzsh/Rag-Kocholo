        "text": "Robbie J. Williams of Tennille, Georgia passed away on January 2, 2024, at the age of 86. Robbie was born June 4, 1937, in Dahlonega, Georgia to Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin Carlton Williams. She received a Bachelor of Science degree from Mercer University in 1959. She then completed training as a medical technologist at Grady Hospital in Atlanta before moving to Augusta, GA where she worked for several physicians including Dr. E. Val Hastings. This is where she met Henry J. Heffernan who would become her husband of almost 30 years.\n\nShe was an avid golfer who once reached and maintained a five handicap. She was a multiple-time champion of the Augusta Country Club’s Women’s Golf Association and the CSRA Women’s Golf Association. After moving to Tennille, GA, she was a multiple-time champion of the Twin City County Club Women’s Golf Association. Robbie was also passionate about gardening and operated a thriving flower business with her partner Dr. Glenn Bridges on their Chinaberry Ranch near Dublin, Georgia, for several years. They enjoyed selling their flowers at the weekly Farmer’s Market in Sandersville, GA every Saturday during the summer. She became widely known in middle Georgia as “The Flower Lady.” In 2007, she authored the book “A Few Flowers For My Soul. A Gardener’s View of the Healing Powers of Cut Flowers” which captured many of the memorable experiences she had selling her flowers. Her first book, co-authored with her oldest daughter, Lee Heffernan and published in 2002 was “Gentlemen Only: An Insider’s View of Golf in Augusta, Georgia and What She Found at the End of Magnolia Lane.”\n\nRobbie is survived by her three daughters: Mary Lee Heffernan of Greensboro, GA, Agnes Cecelia Heffernan of Jackson, WY and Sara Regina Heffernan of Greensboro, GA.\n\nThe family thanks the wonderful, compassionate staff at Washington County Regional Medical Center in Sandersville, Georgia for their exceptional caring and support.\n\nDonations may be sent to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, P.O. Box 1000, Dept. 142, Memphis, TN 38148.\n\nThe graveside service will be on Friday, January 5, 2024, at 2:00 P.M. at Magnolia Cemetery in Augusta, Georgia with Mr. Chandler Bridges officiating. The family will receive friends following the graveside service."
