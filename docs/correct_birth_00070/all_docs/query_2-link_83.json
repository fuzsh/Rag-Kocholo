        "text": "AYDA Field made a name for herself before she met her future husband Robbie Williams.\n\nBut ever since the pair met, they have been steadfast pillars of support for each other such as supporting Robbie Williams at BST Hyde Park, where he will perform on Sunday July 6, 2024.\n\nWho is Ayda Field and where was she born?\n\nAyda Field was born Ayda Sabahat Evecan in Los Angeles on May 17, 1979 to Turkish father Haldun Evecan and movie producer mother Gwen Field.\n\nShe is an American actress and the wife of Robbie Williams.\n\nAyda graduated from Harvard-Westlake School in California in 1997 and went on to study law and accountancy at university.\n\nBut Ayda turned to modelling and working as an actress, and made her debut aged 21 in City Girls in 1998.\n\nTwo years later she got her big break as an actress when she won a lead role in the huge US soap Days of our Lives playing Angelo Moroni.\n\nHer other roles included the drama Back To You, playing Montana Diaz Herrera in the Fox sitcom for ten episodes.\n\nShe also starred as Jeannie Whatley in the TV series Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, alongside Matthew Perry.\n\nAyda paid tribute to Matthew after he died.\n\nShe wrote: \"I’ve just read the news that Matthew Perry has passed away and my heart is heavy.\n\n\"Many years ago, I had the pleasure of working with Matt on a tv series called Studio 60 On The Sunset Strip.\n\n\"Working alongside him for a year was truly a privilege, personally and professionally.\n\n\"Not only was Matt one of the most talented actors I’ve ever worked with, he was one wickedly funny human being.\n\n\"He lit up a room with his humour and his charm. I feel grateful that I have these memories and am mourning the loss of a really special man. I’ll miss you, Matt xx #rip\"\n\nWhat does Ayda Field do for a living?\n\nAyda continues to act, and her shows include Fresh Meat, and the drama Paranoid.\n\nShe also enjoyed a stint on ITV's Loose Women as a guest panellist.\n\nAyda also sat alongside husband Robbie Williams on the X Factor 2018 judging panel.\n\nIt was reported at the time that show bosses put a £10million deal on the table to secure the husband and wife as a judging combo.\n\nHow did Ayda Field meet Robbie Williams?\n\nThe couple were set up on a blind date by mutual friends in 2006.\n\nThey got engaged at Christmas in 2009 and were married at his Los Angeles home in 2010.\n\nOver the years, Robbie and Ayda's relationship has gone from strength to strength, and today they are one of the most solid couples in showbiz.\n\nDuring his single life, Robbie was well known for romancing a string of beauties.\n\nThe former Take That star famously dated Spice Girls star Geri Halliwell in the early noughties.\n\nAnother one of his very high profile relationships was with model Rachel Hunter, who had recently split from Rod Stewart when they got together - they were together for a year from 2002.\n\nRobbie also dated The Corrs star Andrea Corr.\n\nIn 2022, the singer hinted that he had flings with both Kylie Minogue and Nicole Kidman - both of who he had No. 1 singles with.\n\nRobbie also was in a relationship with All Saints star Nicole Appleton in the late 90s.\n\nDo Ayda Field and Robbie Williams have kids?\n\nTogether, the couple have four children.\n\nThe oldest of the Williams brood is Theodora Rose, known as Teddy, who entered the world on September 18, 2012.\n\nWhile their famous mum and dad generally keep their children out of the spotlight, their eldest made her first public appearance in 2018 as a bridesmaid at Princess Eugenie's wedding.\n\nCharlton \"Charlie\" Williams was next, and was born on October 27, 2014.\n\nThe couple then welcomed Colette Josephine, known as Coco, on August 19, 2018 via a surrogate.\n\nShe was followed by their fourth child -and second son - Beau.\n\nThe youngster was born on Valentine’s Day 2020 via the same surrogate who carried Coco.\n\nAnnouncing the news on Instagram at the time, mum Ayda wrote: \"Spot the difference... On this Valentine's Day, we would like to celebrate love in the most awesome way... Beau Benedict Enthoven Williams.\n\n\"As with Coco, he is biologically ours, but born via our same incredible surrogate.\n\n\"We are so blessed to have our healthy son safely in our arms and are officially complete as a family.\""
