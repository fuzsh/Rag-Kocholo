        "text": "As the Royal Family gather at Sandringham for the first Christmas hosted by King Charles III and the Queen Consort, the Norfolk estate is also gearing up for next summer’s big event. Yesterday, it was announced that one of Britain’s best selling artists, Robbie Williams, and special guests, would play one night at the Sandringham Estate on 26 August.\n\nRead More\n\nWhen William and Kate first took the US by storm: revisiting the Prince and Princess of Wales’s 2011 trip across the pond\n\nIn honour of their visit to Boston this week, Tatler looks back at Kate and William’s three-day trip to America in July 2011, just months after the royal wedding\n\nThe 20,000-acre royal estate, home to British monarchs since 1862, is traditionally used to the altogether more sedate visits of dog-walkers and families to the Winter Luminate light trail. But this, the first large live-scale music event at Sandringham promises to be a sell out as tickets go on sale on Friday.\n\nWilliams, 48, who most recently played in the UK in November at the Royal Albert Hall, is no stranger to world stadiums and grand estates. Summer 2003 saw 375,000 fans descend on the Lytton Cobbold family seat, Knebworth House in Hertfordshire, to see Robbie perform a trio of concerts. Robbie began his hugely successful solo career in 1996 when he split from boy band Take That. He is celebrating his 14th Number 1 solo album with XXV.\n\nRead More\n\nWho is Princess Sofia of Sweden? The colourful life of the model-turned-royal as she celebrates her 39th birthday\n\nThe wife of Prince Carl Philip has gone from reality TV queen to royal mother-of-three. She is now a hard-working royal and activist. Her top targets? Cyberbullying, neurodiversity issues and nurses' causes\n\n‘I am so honoured to be playing this show at the Sandringham Estate this summer,’ tweeted the star yesterday. No doubt the younger royals will be out in force to see this charismatic star set Sandringham alight.\n\nThe Royal Family will next be seen at the Princess of Wales’s carol concert, Together at Christmas, which will be held at Westminster Abbey next week. Kensington Palace announced today that Kate will be supported by Prince William and King Charles and the Queen Consort at the event, which will feature readings from Dame Kristin Scott Thomas and Hugh Bonneville.\n\nThe family is also bracing itself for the release of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s Netflix docuseries, Harry & Meghan, which will premiere on the streaming platform on 8 December."
