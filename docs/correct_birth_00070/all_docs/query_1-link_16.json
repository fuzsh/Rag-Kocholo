        "text": "Things seem to be going very well for Robbie Williams. His latest album Swings Both Ways, featuring collaborations with Olly Murs, Rufus Wainwright, Kelly Clarkson and Lily Allen, hit the top of the charts last weekend.\n\nTo celebrate Robbie's landmark success, here are ten things you might not already know about the star.\n\n1. Born in February 1974, Robert Peter Williams (though you can call him Robbie, if you want) was born and raised in Stoke-on-Trent. He had an interest in performing from a young age, starring in several school plays including as the Artful Dodger in Oliver!.\n\n2. One thing Robbie has become well known for is his body art. Among his numerous tattoos are the sheet music to the chorus of The Beatles hit 'All You Need Is Love' on his back, Take That's official logo on his wrist and the slogan 'Born To Be Mild' on his arm. He also has an 'A' inked on his ring finger, in place of the wedding ring which he reportedly can't stop losing.\n\n3. Robbie got his big break as one fifth of one of the biggest boybands of the '90s, Take That. Three years after the five-piece released their debut single, Robbie's partying was out of hand and he was unhappy with his lack of creative control within the group, which led to his departure. He later rejoined the group in 2010 to record the album Progress, Take That's first new material as a five-piece in 15 years.\n\n4. After he quit Take That, Robbie kicked off his solo career. While it was songs like 'Angels' and 'Let Me Entertain You' that would eventually make Robbie one of the biggest stars in British music, his debut single was a cover of George Michael's 'Freedom', an apparent statement to his former Take That bandmates. Robbie has since said that when they filmed the video for the song he hadn't even recorded his version yet, so mimed to George Michael's original instead.\n\n5. In addition to his music career, Robbie is one of the creators of the charity event Soccer Aid along with Jonathan Wilkes. Every two years, a team of English celebrities and professional footballers takes on a similar team - dubbed 'The Rest Of The World' - in a charity football match to raise money for UNICEF. The most recent match in 2012 saw Olly Murs, John Bishop and Paddy McGuinness taking on Gerard Butler, Will Ferrell and James McAvoy.\n\n6. He might be settled down now with his wife of three years, actress Ayda Field, but Ayda is not the only woman to have turned Robbie's head. In the past he's been romantically linked with a string of famous women including - but not limited to - Nicole Appleton, Anna Friel, Nicole Kidman, and not one but two Spice Girls in the form of Mel C and Geri Haliwell.\n\n7. Over the course of his career, Robbie has made a number of striking music videos, requiring him to dress up as Elvis Presley, a bunny rabbit, James Bond, a race car driver and, for 2007's 'She's Madonna', a woman. Robbie's most notorious video is probably the controversial clip for his 2000 single 'Rock DJ', where he famously rips off his clothes for a group of roller-skating women. When the ladies don't seem impressed, he then proceeds to rip off his skin, leaving nothing but a dancing skeleton at the end of the video.\n\n8. Robbie Williams has famously won more Brit Awards than any other artist, both as a part of Take That and for his solo career. This includes the Outstanding Contribution to Music award, which he won in 2010. Previous winners of the lifetime achievement award include Pet Shop Boys, Sir Paul McCartney and Tom Jones.\n\n9. No stranger to The X Factor, Robbie has performed during the live shows a number of times. He duetted on 'Angels' with eventual runner-up Olly Murs, who is one of the guest performers on Robbie's most recent album Swings Both Ways. He's also been a guest mentor at Judges' House, helping both Sharon Osbourne and former Take That bandmate Gary Barlow decide who should go through to the Live Shows - including one notable moment where he paid tribute to Sinitta's infamous \"leaves\" outfit."
