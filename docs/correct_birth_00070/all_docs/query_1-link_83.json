        "text": "After months of anticipation Robbie Williams' Netflix documentary, aptly named Robbie Williams, is set to drop later this week and will chart the course of Robbie's early fame, to leaving Take That, his successful solo career and his life now, with wife Ayda Field and their four children.\n\nOver the years Robbie and Ayda, who have been married for 13 years, have kept their children out of the spotlight, never sharing photos of their children's faces, but occasionally giving updates on their big life milestones, including their birthdays which the parents seem to throw the most incredible parties for.\n\nHowever, in the documentary it's thought we might get more of an insight into Robbie's family life now, with a clip of eldest daughter Teddy performing 'Angels' included in the trailer for the documentary.\n\nSo how many children does Robbie Williams' have and what are their names and ages? Here's what you need to know.\n\nWhat are the names and ages of Robbie Williams' children?\n\nTheodora 'Teddy' Rose Williams\n\nRobbie and Ayda's eldest child is Theodora Rose Williams and she usually goes by Teddy. Teddy was born in 2012 and as of November 2023 she is 11 years old.\n\nWhile Robbie and Ayda generally keep their children out of the spotlight, Teddy made her first public appearance in 2018 as a bridesmaid at Princess Beatrice's wedding.\n\nTeddy is also seen in the Robbie Williams documentary trailer performing her dad's, arguably, most famous song 'Angels' to him and mum Ayda.\n\nCharlton 'Charlie' Valentine Williams\n\nCharlton 'Charlie' Valentine Williams is Robbie and Ayda's second child and he was born in October 2014, and as of November 2023 he is nine years old.\n\nCharlie's birth was announced by Robbie on YouTube, in a video captioned: \"Charlton Valentine Williams has left the building…\" and showed Ayda pushing Robbie in a wheelchair while holding Charlie.\n\nColette 'Coco' Josephine Williams\n\nColette 'Coco' Josephine Williams is Robbie and Ayda's third child and she was born in August 2018, and as of November 2023 she is five years old.\n\nCoco was born via a surrogate and Ayda announced the couple's happy news on Instagram, a few weeks after her birth, saying: \"So we have been keeping a very special secret! We are delighted to share with you that we have had a baby girl….welcome to the world Colette (Coco) Josephine Williams!!\n\n\"It has been a very long and difficult path to get here, which is why we have kept it on the down low.\"\n\nShe added: \"Family comes in all forms, and this little lady, who is biologically ours, was carried by an incredible surrogate mother, to whom we will be eternally grateful.\"\n\nBeau Benedict Enthoven Williams\n\nBeau Benedict Enthoven Williams is Robbie and Ayda's fourth and youngest child, and he was born in February 2020 and so as of November 2023 he is three years old.\n\nBeau was born via the same surrogate Robbie and Ayda used for Coco's birth. Ayda announced Beau's arrival on Instagram on Valentine's Day, writing: \"On this Valentine's Day, we would like to celebrate love in the most awesome way.\n\n\"As with Coco, he is biologically ours, but born via our same incredible surrogate. We are so blessed to have our healthy son safely in our arms and are officially complete as a family.\"\n\nRobbie Williams is available on Netflix from 8th November"
