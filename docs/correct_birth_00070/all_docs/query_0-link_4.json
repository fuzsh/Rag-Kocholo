        "text": "#1 - Newfield Street, Tunstall\n\n46 Newfield Street was the home of Robbie's grandmother Betty Williams and her husband Phillip Williams. Robbie's father Pete Conway grew up here and Robbie spent a lot of his time here when growing up. She passed away in 1998. In 2002 Robbie wrote the song \"Nan's Song\" in her memory.\n\nThis guide follows a slightly different route with additional points of interest, which can be found here: RWDB Tourist Trail Map. The route is 7km and takes about 2 hours by foot or 20 minutes by car without stopping.\n\nThe official route marker is located on the corner of Newfield Street and High Street.\n\n#2 - St. Margaret Ward Catholic College, Tunstall\n\nSt Margaret Ward Catholic Academy is a mixed secondary school and sixth form. The school is named after Saint Margaret Ward, a Roman Catholic martyr who was executed during the reign of Elizabeth I for assisting a priest to escape from prison. Robbie attended school here from 1985 to 1990.\n\n#3 - Mill Hill Primary School, Tunstall\n\nThe school was opened in 1952 and located on Sunnyside Avenue. Robbie spent his primary school years here from 1978 to 1985.\n\n#4 - Victoria Park & Victoria Park Road, Tunstall\n\nRobbie lived on Victoria Park Road from 1974-1975. Victoria Park is the main park in Tunstall. It has a football pitch, skate ramps, basketball courts, a children's adventure park and two lakes where children come to feed the ducks. Robbie developed his love for football and his football skills in this park.\n\nIn 2014 a blue plaque was revealed to celebrate Robbie's 40th birthday. A blue plaque is a permanent sign installed in a public place in the United Kingdom and to commemorate a link between that location and a famous person, serving as a historical marker. The plaque was stolen when Robbie visited his hometown for his Homecoming Gig in 2022.\n\nThe plaque was located on the left of the entrance of Victoria Park, near the corner of Victoria Park Road and Queens Avenue.\n\n#5 - Greenbank Road, Tunstall\n\nRobbie was living on 108 Greenbank Road when he joined Take That in 1990.\n\n#6 - High Lane Oatcakes, Tunstall\n\nRobbie loves oatcakes and this was his favourite shop. It was very high rated until it came under new management in 2022.\n\nOatcake shops are known to have existed in the 1850s and the recipe is even older. It's a signature dish in the Potteries, of which Stoke-on-Trent is part of. An oatcake is a type of flatbread that takes the shape of a pancake and has oatmeal as the primary ingredient. The oatcake was mostly popular on Sunday as a treat with bacon, eggs, cheese, mushrooms, and/or onion.\n\n#7 - Vale Park, Burslem\n\nThis is the home of Robbie’s beloved football team, Port Vale FC. On 4 June 2022 Robbie performed his Homecoming Gig in the stadium, which was a very emotional experience for him.\n\n#8 - Red Lion, Burslem\n\nRobbie lived here from 1975 to 1978 when his parents ran it. Robbie's father Pete tells the story of when Robbie got angry and decided to throw the bar takings onto the street from an upstairs window.\n\nThe premises recently reopened under new management. The new owners made the controversial decision to remove a mural of Robbie themed around his his 'Angels' from the front of the pub. Nonetheless, a plaque dedicated to the star is still in place at the front of the pub. It reads: \"Robbie Williams. Singer-songwriter and megastar entertainer Robbie Williams grew up here in the Red Lion which was run by parents Janet and Pete. The pub is a few hundred metres from his beloved Port Vale FC, the Mighty Valiants. Robbie first erupted on stage with Take That, followed by phenomenal success as a solo artist. With 75 million record sales worldwide, it's no wonder he has the Freedom of the City of Stoke-on-Trent. \"Angels\" is the biggest of Robbie's many hits, one we'll happily sing along with, anytime. It's not clear if the song title is taken from the Angel of Victory atop Burslem Town Hall, though we think it might be...\n\n\"Angels\" lyric (Robbie Williams/Guy Chambers) used by kind permission 08/2019.\"\n\n#9 - Old Town Hall, Burslem\n\nThe angel on the Old Town Hall is rumoured to have been the inspiration for Robbie’s hit song Angels in 1997.\n\n#10 - The Queen’s Theatre, Burslem\n\nRobbie was a member of North Staffs Amateur Dramatic Society and appeared as The Artful Dodger in Oliver! in 1988, aged 14.\n\n#11 - Scotia Road, Tunstall\n\nWhile not a place Robbie lived, it is mentioned in one of his songs, 'The 80s' on album Rudebox. The lyrics say: \"When I ran, I ran so far away down Scotia Road to a taxi bay, then I ran again 'cos I couldn't pay\".\n\n#12 - Middleport, Stoke-on-Trent\n\nRoads in a housing estate in the Middleport area in Stoke-on-Trent are called Angels Way, Candy Lane and Supreme Street to honour Robbie Williams' 40th birthday. The three \"Robbie Williams\" streets are part of a £14m housing development by social housing company Sanctuary Group, part-funded by the Homes and Communities Agency. Although Robbie did not attend the unveiling ceremony in 2014, he said it was \"a real honour\" and \"a wonderful legacy\"."
