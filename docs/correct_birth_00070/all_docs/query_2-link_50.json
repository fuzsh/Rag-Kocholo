        "text": "The British singer Robbie Williams, who looks back over his three-decade music career in a new Netflix documentary, is believed to boast a nine-figure net worth.\n\nAccording to the website Celebrity Net Worth, which specialises in calculating how rich the stars are, the 49-year-old’s fortune stands at around $300 million.\n\nThis figure is more or less consistent with a 2021 estimate by the Sunday Times, whose Rich List placed him 16th among the UK’s wealthiest musicians, with a net worth of £195 million. That’s about $245 million at the current sterling-dollar exchange rate, but was closer to $270 million at the time.\n\nMultiple award-winning, chart-topping singer\n\nWilliams has established himself as one of the most successful artists in British music history, winning a record 18 Brit Awards either as a solo musician or as part of the hit boy band Take That.\n\nHis 2022 compilation album XXV, which celebrated his 25 years as a solo artist, was the 14th solo album of his career to reach No. 1 in the UK charts. Only the Beatles, with 15, have more chart-topping albums.\n\nWilliams was also involved in five No. 1 albums across his two stints as a member of Take That, and has a total of 14 No. 1 singles across his solo and group career.\n\nRobbie Williams Netflix documentary: watch the trailer\n\nOpens up on struggles in Netflix series\n\nReleased earlier this month, the four-part Netflix documentary Robbie Williams sees the pop icon talk candidly about his rise to stardom - and his major personal struggles as he has dealt with addiction and the pitfalls of fame.\n\nThe series includes previously-unseen archival footage in which, for example, Williams opens up on the feelings of insecurity caused by being a huge celebrity.\n\nSpeaking directly into the camera in one video, filmed as his solo career blossomed in the years after his first departure from Take That in 1995, Williams says: “I’m getting a bit scared by all the success and what’s happening - it’s all a bit too much at the minute.\n\n“Especially becoming really, really famous again [as Williams had previously been as a member of Take That] and not knowing who to trust. It’s weird, because my last memory of being really, really famous was being really, really sad."
