        "text": "Robbie Williams recently revealed he has nowhere to live after selling his homes based in both Wiltshire and Los Angeles.\n\nHowever, the singer is thought to still own homes that total an eye-watering £44 million including a lavish villa in Zurich that he purchased with wife Ayda Field last year to relocate during the Covid pandemic, and a £17.5 million home in west London.\n\nIn a recent interview, Robbie confessed he and his family are living 'nowhere' at the moment after recently selling his LA home to rapper Drake in a deal thought to be worth at least $35 million.\n\nThe Williams' Swiss property is built in the style of a traditional Genevan villa with a long sweeping tree-lined drive and gated entrance.\n\nIt was previously reported that Robbie cut a deal with businessman Nicolas Brunschwig over the 356 square-metre Swiss villa during a game of golf, and splashed out a reported £24 million on the property.\n\nBack in September, Robbie revealed he was living in Switzerland amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDuring an interview with Steve Wright on BBC Radio 2, the musician insisted he's opted to temporarily reside 'up a mountain' in a bid to avoid contracting COVID-19 as he's 'a bit neurotic'.\n\nWhen asked he's living in his Los Angeles or Malibu home, the media personality said: 'No I'm not. I'm somewhere in Switzerland up a mountain.\n\n'Well, I'm a bit neurotic and I thought where can I place myself where it won't get me? And I thought, well I'll just live up the Mont Blanc for 6 months… it's really warm actually, it's really lovely.'\n\nOn how the global outbreak has affected his lifestyle, the former Take That star admitted while he loves spending time with his children, he's eager to get back to 'doing what I love'.\n\nThe singer said: 'The performing arts is suffering greatly because of it and, on a personal note from me, I'm so grateful to do what I do for a living and can't wait to get back to work and start performing again.\n\n'I'm loving my time with my family, I'm loving my time with my wife, I've got 4 kids – it's joyous – but I'm chomping at the bit now to leave the house and do what I do for a living and what I love.'\n\nThe singer also owns a £17.5 million London home that has been the source of an ongoing row with his next door neighbour, Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, over renovation plans.\n\nThe former Take That star was given planning permission for an underground swimming pool and gym in October 2019 at his Grade II-listed home after five years of fighting with rocker Page.\n\nWilliams previously responded by withdrawing the blueprints but later returned with a fresh set of plans, and last month he filed a new report guaranteeing that noise from the units will not exceed 25 decibels.\n\nPage hotly contested the application, saying even the tiniest of vibrations could ruin his own Grade I-listed building in west London, and its fragile ancient paintings and frescoes.\n\nAlthough Williams won the war, Page was victorious in one battle, which meant the singer's builders could only use hand-held tools to excavate the basement, meaning it would take years at great expense.\n\nIt was thought Williams had lost interest and was reportedly looking for buyers after relocating to Switzerland during the pandemic.\n\nIt comes after Robbie admitted he and his family are searching for somewhere new to put down roots after recently selling almost all of his properties, after selling his ten bedroom, twenty-two bathroom LA mansion to Drake in a private $35-$50 million deal for the ten bedroom, twenty-two bathroom mansion.\n\nThe sale came two months after Robbie found a buyer for his Wiltshire home in a deal worth £6.75million, meaning the family are now reviewing their options.\n\nSpeaking to Australian radio hosts Kyle Sandilands and Jackie 'O' Henderson, Robbie said: 'We’re actually nowhere.'\n\n'We haven’t got an abode right now, we’ve pretty much sold everywhere, we don’t live anywhere and we’re trying to figure it out.'\n\nRobbie and his wife Ayda Field, 42, share their home with their four children, Teddy, nine, Charlie, ten, Coco, three, and two-year-old Beau.\n\nRobbie went on to say that his kids are a massive factor in deciding where to live because they need to be placed in suitable schools.\n\nHe explained: 'The four kids are constantly a Rubix Cube puzzle that we’re trying to sort out because if they are schooled then they don’t see me because I’m all over the place and if they are home-schooled then they have another set of things that are a problem.'\n\nThe singer also refused to confirm the widely reported multi-million dollar Los Angeles property sale to Drake, jesting he would've signed a non-disclosure agreement if it did happen - so he wouldn't be able to comment either way.\n\nDespite securing a massive deal with the LA home, it was reported that Robbie was hoping for $80 million for the mansion - which is around 25,000 square feet and features at least 22 bathrooms.\n\nThe Tuscan style property also boasts an eleven car garage, a wine cellar, a gym, a game room, a professional screening room, an elevator, a tennis court, a mosaic tiled pool and an outdoor kitchen.\n\nRobbie sold his Wiltshire home, Compton Bassett House, in January, after buying the £8.1million property in 2009 and failing to sell it just 18 months later.\n\nSet in a backdrop of 'picturesque rolling countryside,' the property is built over three floors and and with an extensive leisure complex and a detached cottage.\n\nCompton Bassett House went on the market with estate agency Knight Frank for £6.75 million in 2021, with the singer admitting he was keen to sell to someone who appreciated its splendour as much as he did.\n\nHe said in a statement: 'Compton Bassett House is most definitely a family friendly house that deserves to have much more laughter and joy within its beautiful walls. We hope the incoming purchaser will enjoy just as much as we have.'\n\nHe added: 'The gardens and trees have enchanted us with their magic, and on rainy days—of which there are many in England—we have played and splashed around the indoor pool, much to our delight.'\n\nSpeaking in 2014, Robbie - then a father of two - admitted he was keen to make the United Kingdom his permanent base after spending an extended period of time in the United States.\n\nHe told The Sun: 'I love LA. The people and the weather are great but it's not England. It can't offer the same. Things change when you're a dad - there are people to look after who are more important than yourself.\n\n'I want [daughter] Teddy and the new baby, whatever it may be, to be educated in England. Teddy is already surrounded by English people so she's bound to have an accent anyway.\n\n'But that's not the point - we want to educate her in London. We've just bought a ruddy big house so we had better be coming back!'\n\nWilliams reportedly put his £9 million Compton Basset Manor back on the market after failing to sell it back in July 2010, with the singer having forked out a cool £24million on an incredible mansion in Switzerland after moving their family to Geneva.\n\nWilliams was said to be keen on selling the 17th century Wiltshire property as he 'never felt at home' there and also feels it is 'haunted'.\n\nA source told The Mirror: 'It seemed like an idyllic hideaway in the English countryside but he never really felt at home there. In a matter of months he realised it wasn't where he and Ayda wanted to settle.\n\n'Now he's planning a reshuffle of his property portfolio since deciding to buy in Switzerland.The family moved there last summer and rented for six months to make sure they wanted to stay.'\n\nThe reshuffle of his property portfolio comes as Robbie and Ayda moved to Switzerland with their children last year in a bid to avoid Coronavirus, splashing £24million on a mansion in Geneva.\n\nHowever, with the news that the family are still looking for somewhere to live after the shrinkage of their range of properties - it could be that the family make the move down under.\n\nRobbie has been spending a lot of time in Australia as he films his Better Man biopic in Melbourne.\n\nIt was revealed that Robbie has been casting young Australian stars to play Take That in the biopic - as he will star as himself in the production.\n\nThe biopic will focus on Robbie's life and career as a singer and is being directed and co-written by Australian filmmaker Michael Gracey."
