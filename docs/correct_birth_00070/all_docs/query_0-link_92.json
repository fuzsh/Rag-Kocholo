        "text": "A.S.H. Auctions have a very special lot in their upcoming sale on the 24th Nov. If you know a Robbie Williams fan you better let them know about this one! The lot consists of several items signed by the singer himself.\n\nRobbie Williams was born and grew up in Stoke On Trent, the town in which the saleroom is located and Robbie is still very passionate about his hometown.\n\nHe set up a charity fund called \"Give It Sum\" which has helped a number of charities over the years, one such charity is the Blurton Community Centre project which is located right in the heart of his hometown, Stoke on Trent.\n\nThe \"Give it Sum\" charity was created back in 2000 and is dedicated to tackling poverty, promoting social justice and helping local people find solutions to local problems, has funded almost 300 projects across North Staffordshire and seen more than Â£5 million spent on changing the lives of countless people in the area.\n\nA.S.H. Auctions were approached by the founder of the Blurton Community Centre project, Mrs Nina Hulse, who whilst now retired, still thinks of the centre as her baby. She explained why she wanted to undertake the auctioneer's services; unfortunately, the centre had run into difficulties and was under threat of closure. Mrs Hulse asked A.S.H. Auctioneers if they would undertake the job of auctioning off the fixtures and fittings of the centre. She then mentioned the Robbie Williams items they were in possession of which were also to be sold.\n\nOwners of the auction house kept in contact with Nina and have recently found out a lot about this amazing centre and the work that the team there have done over the years. They conducted some research via the internet and found a wealth of information about Nina and her dedication to the cause. Nina also featured in the book \"Inspirational Women\" which shows just how dedicated she is.\n\nDuring the following few weeks, Nina and another volunteer of the centre worked tirelessly trying to rescue the centre and prevent its closure, which we are pleased to announce has been successful for the immediate future. So, for now, the fixtures and fittings are safe, but the Robbie Williams items are still going under the hammer to raise funds to support this worthwhile project.\n\nThey hope that the proceeds from the sale of these items will help to keep the centre going into the new year, while the volunteers sort out a new manager that can hopefully keep it going for good.\n\nThe auctioneers have kindly agreed to reduce our selling commission to 5% of the hammer price for this special project, as they believe strongly that local projects like this are a vital part of the community and need to be saved.\n\nIncluded in the lot are the following:\n\nRobbie Williams Hard Back Book \"FEEL\" By Chris Heath. (Personally Signed By Robbie Williams When He Visited The Blurton Community Centre which he helped to fund)\n\nA Large 65cm x 54cm FRAMED And GLAZED PLAQUE That Includes a Signed Photograph of Robbie In the recording studios in October 2002.\n\nA Signed Letter by Robbie saying how sorry he was that he could not make the official opening day of the Blurton Community Centre."
