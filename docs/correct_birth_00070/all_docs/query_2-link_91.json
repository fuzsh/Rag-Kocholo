        "text": "Robbie Williams is the celebrated singer-songwriter and former member of the iconic English pop group Take That with a distinguished solo career. With a charismatic stage presence and evocative lyrics, he has brought the world together with chart-topping hits. Williams has consistently reinvented himself, solidifying his status as one of the UK's most enduring and versatile pop icons. Today, he continues to make headway on a journey that began during his first stint in rehab in the '90s, transforming inner demons into self-loving angels.\n\nA star is re-born: Robbie Williams’ collection of artworks on mental health have arrived right on time. Through candid, caricature forms, the artist sends a wave of relief through our collective consciousness. It can be hard not to internalise the conditions of our sometimes hostile world, putting inner peace and freedom of mind seemingly out of reach. Robbie’s art holds an antidote.\n\nHis down to earth, vulnerable yet bold visual language illustrates his personal struggle with external pressure, shame, fear, and other inner demons. Through time, resilience and a creative renaissance, he can now proudly say: “the things that destroyed me also made me successful”.\n\nFollowing the example of the artist, we may look inward and embrace both dark and light, and learn to express ourselves with the freedom of full (sometimes comical) transparency.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with mental health, do not hesitate to ask for help. Call or text 0800-0113 or visit these sources:\n\nFor Dutch\n\nFor International\n\nWhen it comes to a metamorphosis, Robbie Williams is no stranger to embracing evolution with a bit of wit and an exposed heart.\n\nBorn on February 13, 1974, in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England, Robert Peter Williams catapulted to fame as a member of the iconic boy band Take That in the early 1990s - Iconic hits include \"Back for Good\" and \"Never Forget.\" However, Robbie's itch for creative independence and personal struggles led to his departure in 1995, marking the start of his solo career. In 1997, Robbie Williams released the international hit single “Angels,” propelling him to superstardom.\n\nExperiencing ups and downs in his career, Robbie Williams felt the pressures in his professional and private life, and this stormy journey pushed him in and out of rehab. During his last stint in rehab, the artist began a self-reflective journey - embracing the light and the dark - to transform inner demons into self-loving angels. Now, after consistently creating art on a daily basis since the 90s, Robbie Williams opens his visual diary that documents his mental health journey through creative expression. Using humour and an honest vulnerability, Williams illustrates the humanistic truths that can touch us, make us laugh and spark pride within ourselves.\n\nNow, Robbie Williams demonstrates his dedication and ability to connect with audiences in a new art form for the public, in the exhibition Pride and Self-Prejudice. Moco Museum Amsterdam is proud to debut the art of Robbie Williams in his first solo exhibition, featuring standout pieces such as “I Deserve Every Drop of Love” and “Your Mental Illness”."
