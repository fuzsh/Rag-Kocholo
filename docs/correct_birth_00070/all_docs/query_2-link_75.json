        "text": "2023 is shaping up to be a pretty exciting year for Robbie Williams fans (aka all pissed mums, everywhere). First up, Netflix is set to release a tell-all docuseries about the ‘Let Me Entertain You’ and ‘Angels’ singer. It promises ‘unprecedented level of access to Williams and an intimate look at his career’, from the break-up of Take That to his recovery from addiction.\n\nAnd as if that weren’t enough, it has just been announced Williams will also be playing a massive summer show in the UK – the first-ever large-scale music event to take place at the Royal Sandringham Estate. Here’s everything we know about the concert (and how you can get tickets).\n\nWhen is Robbie Williams headlining at the King’s Sandringham Estate?\n\nThe former Take That singer will be playing at the Royal Estate of Sandringham on Saturday August 26 2023. It will be the first time a major music event has been held in the estate grounds, and Williams is expected to be joined by some pretty major support acts.\n\nWhen do tickets go on sale?\n\nTickets for the Sandringham show will go on sale at 9am this Friday (December), with a pre-sale taking place the day before.\n\nHow can I get tickets?\n\nYou can register for the pre-sale and buy tickets here.\n\nHow much do they cost?\n\nTicket prices for the show are still to be announced. We’ll be keeping this page updated with the latest information – so watch this space."
