        "text": "MUSIC\n\nRobbie Williams ★★★★\n\nNikola Estate Winery, Perth, November 30 & December 1\n\nHe was 16 years old when he joined Take That and brought screaming girls everywhere to their knees.\n\nMore than three decades later, Robbie Williams may now be playing smaller venues (in 2003 he played to 375,000 people at Knebworth in the UK) but his stage presence is just as big.\n\nThe now 50-year-old brought his XXV Australian Tour to Nikola Estate Winery in Middle Swan and despite the calamitous traffic in and out of the venue, Robbie more than made up for the wait.\n\nThe born entertainer took the audience on a pop music tour of the 90s, belting out his biggest hits such as Let Me Entertain You, Come Undone and Angels, but it was his renditions of some of Take That’s biggest songs and a cover of Oasis’ Don’t Look Back in Anger that really got the crowd going.\n\nHis visit to Perth comes weeks after a four-part documentary aired on Netflix, giving viewers a rare glimpse into his life in LA, his marriage and his four children. It was also used as an opportunity for Williams to look back at his controversial past and give candid insight into what it was like being one of the most famous people on the planet.\n\nHe was also searingly honest in speaking about his feelings for Take That and its frontman Gary Barlow after their falling out, his struggles with drugs and alcohol and his mental health battles. It was moving to watch him at times, and by the end left audience members feeling as though they knew him.\n\nThe flip side of this darkness, however, is Williams’ ability to tell a brilliant joke. The entire crowd was left virtually crying with laughter at his stories – about fans touching his private parts, about his scallywag boy-band days, and how – now much older – he was finding performing exhausting.\n\nAnd while he has the gift of being able to sing into the hearts of everyone in the audience, he also managed to interact with some people intimately, at one point recording a video for a couple’s children, saying “hi from Uncle Robbie”. Another fan was also serenaded with a rendition of She’s The One while one poor bloke got dragged into being the butt of some of his jokes.\n\nLoading\n\nLater in the show his voice was amplified by those of 14,000 delighted people covering John Farnham’s You’re the Voice.\n\nOne of the best multi-generational performers of our time, Williams proved he still has what it takes to work a crowd and as thousands of people (very) slowly made their way home, you can be guaranteed they had smiles on their faces.\n\nGet the day’s breaking news, entertainment ideas and a long read to enjoy.
