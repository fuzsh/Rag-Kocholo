        "text": "A right winger and considered by many the greatest dribbler in the history of football, he was the first British footballer to be knighted (1965).\n\nMatthews began his professional career in 1931 and played at various times for Stoke City and Blackpool. By 1938 he was representing England in international matches, and, when he retired in 1965, he had played in 54 full international contests.\n\nHe made his debut at age 17 for the local First Division professional team, Stoke City. Two years later, he was selected to play for England.\n\nA right winger, Matthews was a wonderful dribbler whose subtle body swerves, acceleration, and superb ball control unsettled virtually every defender he faced. In 1947 he moved to Blackpool and it was then he finally won a Football Association (FA) Cup winners medal, in 1953. At the age of 41, Matthews won the first-ever European Player of the Year award. In 1965 he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, becoming the first active football player ever to receive the honour. Widely respected as the perfect sportsman, Matthews was never cautioned by a referee throughout his 33-year career.\n\nMore than 35,000 fans attended Matthews's retirement game in 1965. So many of the world's top players came to the game to honour him that four teams formed and played two matches.\n\n(1867 - 1931)\n\nEnoch Arnold Bennett was born on 27 May 1867 at 90 Hope Street, Hanley. He was the son of Enoch Bennett, a Burslem man who was at the time a pawnbroker, seeking to improve his station in the pursuit of a career in law (which he subsequently attained). He was the husband of Sarah Longson, a daughter of a Derbyshire family.\n\nArnold Bennett was the eldest of six surviving children. From the time Arnold was eight years old, the family changed residences from Dale Hall, Burslem to Middleport and eventually settled in a newly built house at 205 Waterloo Road, Burslem.\n\nBennett was educated at Swan Bank Wesleyan Chapel, Burslem, the Endowed school at the Wedgwood Institute in Queen Street and the Orme Middle School which was to become Wolstanton Grammar School.\n\nUpon leaving school it was intended that Bennett should become a lawyer but already he had experienced the stirrings for journalism, social correspondence and short-story writing. In 1889 he left the Potteries for good to make his home in the capital where for a time he worked as a solicitors clerk. By 1893 he had become a journalist and within three years he was the editor of the London periodical Woman.\n\nBennett`s first novel, \"A Man From The North\", was published in 1898 and foretold the writer's exploration of environmental biography which resulted in the creation of his fictional town Bursley. His written works contained lightly concealed descriptions of Burslem, forming a fictional gazetteer of this important Potteries town.\n\nWith \"Anna Of The Five Towns\", Bennett struck the theme which earned him respect as a novelist. In this book he wove into fiction, many factual aspects of his home town. The Five Towns` novels are important works of Edwardian English literature. Bennett`s novels are indeed greatly acclaimed in their sociological style and chronological detail.\n\nIn terms of important themes and realistic telling, \"Clayhanger\" and \"Old Wives Tale\" rate as high as any fiction in the English Language and with the humorous novel, \"The Card\", justifiably place Bennett as the most celebrated and critically important man of letters to come from Staffordshire. His Journals were published posthumously."
