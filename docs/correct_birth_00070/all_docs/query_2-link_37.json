        "text": "The story of Robert Peter Williams began 45 years ago at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire.\n\nHis parents, Pete and Jan, were living in a three-bedroom Edwardian semi in Victoria Park Road, Tunstall, overlooking Tunstall Park, with Jan’s daughter Sally.\n\nAt the time, Pete was trying to break into the world of showbusiness, with regular appearances on the local club circuit while working for an electrical manufacturing company.\n\nHe got what he hoped would be his lucky break when he won television talent competition New Faces — and came third in the ‘all-winners final’ behind Les Dennis — but when Robert was two, Pete and Jan took over the Red Lion pub in Burslem, near Vale Park.\n\nAfter his parents separated when he was three, Rob lived with Jan and Sally in Greenbank Road, Tunstall, and spent school holidays with Pete at holiday camps where he was working as a comedian.\n\nRob used to watch his father perform and pay attention to what the audience responded to – occasionally taking to the stage himself.\n\nHe attended Mill Hill Primary School in Tunstall, taking the lead in school productions, and had his first taste of the stage in the chorus in Hans Christian Andersen with the North Staffordshire Operatic Society.\n\nIt soon became clear that young Rob had inherited his father’s flair for the stage.\n\nHis first main role was as Jeremy in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, staged at the Theatre Royal in Hanley by the Stoke-on-Trent Charity Pantomime and Drama Company, in 1985 — after that he was bitten by the acting bug.\n\nHe appeared in Fiddler On The Roof and The King And I, but, as a pupil at St Margaret Ward High School in Tunstall, he kept his talents hidden from his school friends – preferring instead to kick a football around.\n\nAfter appearing as Fat Boy in Pickwick with the North Staffs Operatic Society at the Queen’s Theatre, he landed the role of Artful Dodger in the society’s 1988 production of Oliver!\n\nBy all accounts 14-year-old Rob was a huge success in the role — exhibiting the confidence which would later be his trademark.\n\nIn his first interview with The Sentinel, promoting Oliver!, young Rob said: “I am really interested in acting and hope to go to drama school” — although he was soon to be distracted by the lure of a pop career.\n\nBetter known at school as a joker than for his academic prowess, Rob left at 16 and got a job as a double glazing salesman.\n\nHe planned to go to Stoke-on-Trent Sixth Form College in Fenton but his mum Jan spotted an advert in The Sentinel from a Manchester agency looking for members for a new boy band.\n\nBased on American teen idols New Kids On The Block, the band was created by music impresario Nigel Martin-Smith — who decided that Rob Williams from Stoke-on-Trent would be known as Robbie.\n\nHe sang Jason Donovan’s Nothing Can Divide Us at his audition and was chosen to join Take That alongside Gary Barlow, Mark Owen, Howard Donald and Jason Orange.\n\nThe group signed a major label deal with RCA in September 1991.\n\nIt was their third single, It Only Takes A Minute Girl, which really forced Take That into the national consciousness.\n\nRobbie went on to have six number one singles and three number one albums with Take That, before leaving in 1995.\n\nRobbie would reunite with the band in 2010 when a new album, Progress, was released.\n\nFollow StokeonTrentLive\n\nDownload our app - You can download our free app for iPhone and iPad from Apple's App Store , or get the Android version from Google Play .\n\nFollow StokeonTrentLive on Facebook - Like our Facebook page to get the latest news in your feed and join in the lively discussions in the comments.
