        "text": "After splitting from the popular British boy band Take That, Robbie Williams has become one of the bestselling British singer-songwriters of all time, selling over 75 million records worldwide. He also set a world record by selling 1.6 million concert tickets in just one day.\n\nAs most of the mega-wealthy have been doing, Williams and his American actress wife, Ayda Field, have been sinking their fortune of around US$300 million into some of the most glamorous property on the planet. The Faring Estate in Los Angeles, their most recent purchase, was the former home of Fanny Brice, the original Funny Girl. Totally updated, and at one time listed as high as US$70 million, Williams bought the Holmby Hills home for US$49.5 million.\n\nThe main house, with an attached and two separate guest houses, is found behind the double-gated entry, located on just under one private hectares (two acres). There is a circular motor court and a second gated motor court with a garage, which will accommodate 15 or more cars. The two-story house has an impressive light-panelled foyer with a spiral staircase and inlaid wood floor.\n\nIt opens into a large and cheerful main living room with sunshine pouring through the large windows. Dental moulding surrounds the ceiling and many Old World artisan touches are still evident. The formally panelled wide entry into the library currently shows its whimsical side with a large quirky piece of artwork hanging between the two entry doors.\n\nThe formal dining room will seat 12 comfortably and above its wainscoting is scenic wallpaper of trees over water. Encompassing 18,925 sq ft, the compound has eight bedrooms and eleven baths.\n\nThe luxurious primary suite in the main house has a fireplace in the sitting area and what every couple dreams of: elegant separate baths, his with a masculine vibe and hers much more feminine with its own salon hair station.\n\nAdditionally, there is a chef’s kitchen with breakfast nook, a book-lined study with views over the grounds and a comfortable family room with fireplace.\n\nIn addition to a spacious lawn for rambunctious children, everyone will enjoy the pool and pool house with its fitness centre.\n\nA rousing game of tennis can be played on the pristine tennis court and for those who like to grow organic, there is a brick-paved, raised-bed, vegetable and flower garden, as pretty as it is functional. There is also a long koi pond with tiny fountains along the sides where one can sit on a bench and enjoy quiet contemplation.\n\nThe Holmby Hills mansion isn’t the first US home Williams has owned. After selling his last home to Drake in early 2022 for US$50 million – almost US$18 million more than he paid for it in 2015 – he has now captured one of LA’s most storied and lovely homes for his family of six.\n\nWant more stories like this?
