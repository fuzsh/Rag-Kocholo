        "text": "Robbie Williams was forced to stop his concert mid-way through as he announced he is 'f***ed' from 'long Covid'.\n\nThe former Take That star, 49, was just a few songs in to his show at the Pinkpop music festival in the Netherlands over the weekend.\n\nHe could be seen bending over with his hands on his thighs as he called out to his band to stop.\n\nRobbie then said: \"No, stop stop. I'm f**ked. I'm f**ked.\"\n\nThe audience started to laugh as he continued: \"It's long Covid, I've got long Covid. It's not my f**king age, you f**kers.\"\n\nAfter a quick break, the singer was able to start again as he kick off his track Monsoon.\n\nHe then fit enough to carry on a further 16 songs including hits like Rock DJ, Kids and Angels.\n\nRobbie is currently on a world tour to mark 25 years of his hits, where he is set to perform in New Zealand, Singapore, Italy and the royal Sandringham Estate.\n\nThe chart-topper suffered with two cases of Covid - the first in April 2020 and the second in January 2021 while he was on holiday in the Caribbean island of St Barts.\n\nRobbie has recently been accused of ‘environmental vandalism’ by his neighbours over plans to take a chainsaw to giant trees in his garden.\n\nHe wants to prune 14 plants at his mansion in London’s posh Holland Park.\n\nThe ‘Angels’ singer, worth a reputed £200m, asked the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea for permission to prune back the vegetation.\n\nHe has also applied to chop down others.\n\nBut it sparked trouble with the neighbours again.\n\nThe demands were part of a long list of suggested changes at his home.\n\nHis neighbour former Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page has spent five years fighting Robbie’s plans to renovate his £17.5m Grade II listed mansion in west London.\n\nHe argued unsuccessfully that vibrations could damage ancient paintings and frescoes in his home, where he has lived for 50 years.\n\nRobbie is putting in an indoor pool, gym and underground passageway. His new bid was for a trellis to three sides of the property’s boundary.\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter and Facebook ."
