        "text": "British pop singer (born 1974)\n\nNot to be confused with Robin Williams.\n\nFor other people with the same name, see Robbie Williams (disambiguation).\n\nMusical artist\n\nRobert Peter Williams (born 13 February 1974)[1] is an English singer and songwriter. He found fame as a member of the pop group Take That from 1990 to 1995, launching a solo career in 1996. His debut studio album, Life thru a Lens, was released in 1997, and included his best-selling single \"Angels\". His second album, I've Been Expecting You, featured the songs \"Millennium\" and \"She's the One\", his first number one singles. His discography includes seven UK No. 1 singles, and all but one of his 14 studio albums have reached No. 1 in the UK. Six of his albums are among the top 100 biggest-selling albums in the UK, with two of them in the top 60, and he gained a Guinness World Record in 2006 for selling 1.6 million tickets in a single day during his Close Encounters Tour.[2]\n\nWilliams has received a record 18 Brit Awards, winning Best British Male Artist four times, Outstanding Contribution to Music twice, an Icon Award for his lasting impact on British culture, eight German ECHO Awards, and three MTV European Music Awards.[3][4] In 2004, he was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame after being voted the Greatest Artist of the 1990s. According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), he has been certified for 20.36 million albums and 9.2 million singles in the UK as a solo artist.[5] Five of his albums have also topped the Australian albums chart, and has sold 75 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. He also topped the 2000–2010 UK airplay chart. His three concerts at Knebworth in 2003 drew over 375,000 people, the UK's biggest music event to that point.[6] In 2014, he was awarded the freedom of his hometown of Stoke-on-Trent and had a tourist trail created and streets named in his honour. Williams' latest compilation album, XXV, was released on 9 September 2022.[7][8]\n\nAfter 15 years, Williams rejoined Take That in 2010 to co-write and perform lead vocals on their album Progress, which became the second-fastest-selling album in UK chart history[9] and the fastest-selling record of the century at the time.[10] The subsequent stadium tour, which featured seven songs from Williams' solo career, became the biggest-selling concert in UK history when it sold 1.34 million tickets in less than 24 hours. In 2011, Take That frontman Gary Barlow confirmed that Williams had left the band for a second time to focus on his solo career, although he stated that the departure was amicable and that Williams was welcome to rejoin Take That in the future.[11] Williams has since performed with Take That on three separate television appearances,[12][13][14] and collaborated with Barlow on a number of projects[15] such as the West End musical The Band.[16]\n\nEarly life\n\nRobert Peter Williams was born on 13 February 1974 in Stoke-on-Trent, the son of Janet (née Farrell) and Peter Williams (also known as Pete Conway), who ran a pub called the Red Lion in Burslem before becoming the licensee at the Port Vale FC Social Club.[17] His maternal grandfather was an Irishman from Kilkenny.[18] He attended St Margaret Ward Catholic School in Tunstall[19] and participated in several school plays, most notably in the role of the Artful Dodger in a production of Oliver![20]\n\nTake That\n\nMain article: Take That\n\n1990–1995: First stint\n\nIn 1990, the sixteen-year-old Williams was the youngest member to join Take That. According to the documentary Take That: For the Record, his mother read an advertisement seeking members for a new boy band and suggested that he try out for the group. He met fellow member Mark Owen on the day of his audition/interview with Nigel Martin-Smith. Although the majority of the group's material was written and performed by Gary Barlow, Williams performed lead vocals on their first Top Three hits \"Could It Be Magic\", \"I Found Heaven\", and \"Everything Changes\". Williams' use of alcohol and cocaine brought him into conflict with Martin-Smith over the behaviour rules for Take That members.[21]\n\nIn November 1994, Williams's drug use had escalated; he nearly had a drug overdose the night before the group was scheduled to perform at the MTV Europe Music Awards.[22] According to the documentary For the Record, he was unhappy with his musical ideas not being taken seriously by Martin-Smith and lead singer Barlow; his desire to explore hip hop and rap conflicted with Take That's usual ballads. Barlow stated in interviews that Williams had given up trying to offer creative input.\n\nNoting Williams's increasingly belligerent behaviour and poor attendance at rehearsals, and worried that he might leave the group during their upcoming tour, Barlow and Jason Orange took their concerns to Martin-Smith. During one of the last rehearsals before the tour commenced, the three confronted Williams about his attitude and stated they wanted to do the tour without him. He agreed to quit and left the group in July 1995; it would be the last time for twelve years that they were all together. Despite the departure of Williams, Take That completed their Nobody Else Tour as a four-piece. They later disbanded on 13 February 1996, Williams's 22nd birthday.[23]\n\nShortly afterwards, Williams was photographed by the press partying with the members of Oasis at Glastonbury Festival. Following his departure, he became the subject of talk shows and newspapers as he acknowledged his plans to become a solo singer, and he was spotted partying with George Michael in France. A clause in his Take That contract prohibited him from releasing any material until after the group was officially dissolved, and he was later sued by Martin-Smith and forced to pay $200,000 in commission. After various legal battles over his right to a solo career, Williams succeeded in getting released from his contract with BMG. On 27 June 1996, he signed with Chrysalis Records.\n\n2006–2011: Second stint\n\nBy March 2009, Williams had shown interest in rejoining Take That;[24] the band completed their The Circus Live without him. In spite of rumours that Williams was working in New York with Take That in September that year,[25] by the day of the Children in Need charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall in November they were still performing separately. Both did join with the other acts in the final song of the evening, with Williams putting his arm around Gary Barlow and singing \"Hey Jude\".\n\nOn 15 July 2010, Williams reconciled with his former colleagues and rejoined Take That. In November 2010 the Take That album Progress was released, becoming the fastest selling album since 2000 and the second fastest selling album in UK history.[26] The group travelled across the UK on their Progress Live tour, which included eight nights at Wembley Stadium in London,[27] then continued across Europe. The tour was the fastest selling in UK history with ticket hotlines and websites crashing under the demand.[27]\n\nIn August 2012, Take That performed at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics. Williams was due to perform with Take That but missed the performance because his wife gave birth at around the same time; the group performed as a four-piece.[28]\n\nAlthough still officially part of Take That,[29] Williams chose not to return for group's seventh and eighth studio albums and their accompanying tours, focusing instead on his solo commitments. He continued to write music with his colleagues and has performed with the group on several occasions since 2011's Progress tour[30] and planned to return for a full tour to celebrate Take That's 30th anniversary in 2019.[31]\n\nSolo career\n\n1996–1998: Life thru a Lens and I've Been Expecting You\n\nWilliams launched his solo career in 1996 with a cover of George Michael's \"Freedom\", which reached number two in the UK Singles Chart.[32] Recordings for Williams's first album began at London's Maison Rouge studios in March 1997. Shortly after his introduction to songwriter and producer Guy Chambers, Williams released \"Old Before I Die\", the first single from his debut album. The single reached number two on the UK Charts;[32] it was largely ignored on international charts. His debut album, Life thru a Lens, was released in September 1997. The album launched with his first live solo gig at the Élysée Montmartre theatre in Paris, France. The album debuted at number eleven on the UK Albums Chart.\n\n\"Angels\", the fourth single, is Williams' best-seller in the United Kingdom.[33] The song, apart from becoming a hit around Europe and Latin America, caused sales of his album to skyrocket. The album remained in the British top ten for forty weeks and spent 218 weeks there altogether, making it the 58th best selling album in UK history with sales of over 2.4 million.[34] The album eventually managed to sell over three million copies in Europe.[35]\n\nWilliams and Chambers started writing the second album, I've Been Expecting You, in Jamaica in early 1998. The first single, \"Millennium\", accompanied with a music video featuring Williams parodying James Bond, complete with tuxedo and references to Bond films like Thunderball and From Russia with Love, became Williams' first solo number one single in the United Kingdom.[36] It also became a top twenty hit in many European countries, Latin America and Australia.[37]\n\nI've Been Expecting You was released in late October 1998 and debuted at number one in the UK Albums Chart.[36] The album received more attention outside the United Kingdom, leaving its mark in the European and Latin American markets with hits such as \"No Regrets\", a collaboration with the Pet Shop Boys' singer Neil Tennant and the Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon. \"She's the One\", a cover of a World Party track written by Karl Wallinger, became Williams' second UK number-one single.[36] Williams finished the year with a European Tour late in 1999. I've Been Expecting You sold almost 3 million copies in the UK and was certified 10× Platinum by the BPI.[38] In Europe, the album sold over 4 million copies.[39]\n\n1999–2001: Sing When You're Winning and Swing When You're Winning\n\nIn 1999, Williams was signed to Capitol Records in the United States, a part of EMI. He embarked on a United States promotional tour and released his first United States and Canadian single, \"Millennium\". The compilation album The Ego Has Landed was released in July 1999 in the United States and Canada. In the middle of promotion and the tours in 1999, Williams began work on his third studio album.\n\nThe first single taken from the album was \"Rock DJ\", a song inspired by Williams's UNICEF mentor, the late Ian Dury. The video created by Fred & Farid[40] showed Williams in an attempt to get noticed by a group of women, first stripping and then tearing chunks of skin and muscle from his body, and caused controversy in the United Kingdom and many other countries. The video was edited by Top of the Pops for its graphic content and many other channels followed suit.[41] The song became an instant hit, reaching number one in the UK (becoming his third number one single as a solo artist) and New Zealand. The song went on to win \"Best Song of 2000\" at the MTV Europe Music Awards, \"Best Single of the Year\" at the Brit Awards and an MTV Video Music Award for Best Special Effects.[42]\n\nWhen the album, Sing When You're Winning was released in August 2000, it topped the charts in many different countries.[43] In the UK the album was certified 2× Platinum on its first week of release.[44] After the success of his third album, Williams wanted to take another musical direction. He took two weeks off from his tour to record Swing When You're Winning, his fourth studio album. Born from his lifelong love for Frank Sinatra – combined with the success of the track \"Have You Met Miss Jones?\" that he recorded for the film Bridget Jones' Diary in 2001 – the album was recorded at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles.\n\nWilliams took the chance to duet with his long-time friend Jonathan Wilkes, Little Voice star Jane Horrocks, Saturday Night Live star Jon Lovitz, Rupert Everett and actress Nicole Kidman. The first single released from the album was a duet with Kidman, on \"Somethin' Stupid\". Originally a hit for Frank and Nancy Sinatra, the song became Williams' fifth number one hit in the UK.[45] It eventually went on to become one of the biggest hits of 2001.[46] \"Beyond the Sea\" was featured over the credits of the film Finding Nemo in 2003 and was also released on the film's soundtrack CD. A DVD, Robbie Williams Live at the Albert Hall, was released in December of that year. So far, it has become one of the best selling music DVDs in Europe, being certified 6× Platinum in the United Kingdom[47] and 2× Platinum in Germany.[48]\n\n2002–2005: Escapology and Intensive Care\n\nIn 2002, Williams signed a record-breaking £80 million contract with EMI.[49] The contract included a number of provisos, including the label ceding greater creative control to the artist and a commitment to breaking Williams into the US market. It remains the biggest music deal in British history. The deal was brokered by Ingenious Media, a UK corporate finance advisory business. Williams began working on what would be his fifth studio album, spending a year in the recording studio. The album heralded a new era for Williams. He had taken a more active role in the making of this album. \"One Fine Day\", \"Nan's Song\", and \"Come Undone\" were the first songs that Williams wrote without the input of Guy Chambers. Most of the songs were recorded in Los Angeles.\n\nThe album's first single, \"Feel\", written by Williams and Chambers, was recorded as a demo. When they started working on the album and were trying to re-record the vocals, Williams felt dissatisfied with it, so he decided to include the demo version and then release it as the first single. When the single was released in late 2002, it became Williams' biggest international hit, going number one in The Netherlands and Italy and reaching the top ten in many European countries.[50] When Williams' fifth studio album, Escapology, was released in late 2002, it hit number one in at least 10 countries around the world. In the United States, it failed to make such an impact. Escapology sold almost 2 million copies by the end of 2003 in the United Kingdom.[51] On 1–3 August 2003, Williams played three consecutive concerts at Knebworth to 125,000 people each night, making it the biggest event in UK music history.[6] Memorable performances included \"Come Undone\" where he interjected with \"Britain, I'm Your Son\", and further interacted with the audience when he brought a girl up on stage.[52] In October 2003, Williams released a live album of the concerts, Live at Knebworth.[53]\n\nIn October 2004, Williams released, Greatest Hits, a retrospective of his career, and also, to reveal the new tracks he had been working on with the then-new collaborator, Stephen Duffy. \"Radio\", the compilation's first single, debuted at number one in the UK Singles Chart[36] (becoming Williams' sixth number-one hit). When the compilation was later released it debuted at number one in the UK[36] and was the best selling album of the year in the UK[54] and Europe.[55] Eight years after the release of \"Angels\", the British public voted it as the \"Best Single of the Past Twenty-Five Years\" at the 2005 Brit Awards.[56]\n\nAfter touring Latin America in late 2004 for the promotion Greatest Hits, Williams started working on his sixth studio album. Recorded at his house in the Hollywood Hills, the album was co-written by Stephen Duffy over the course of 24 months. The album Intensive Care was launched in Berlin on 9 October. It became an international hit. In November 2005, Williams took home the MTV Europe Music Award for 'Best Male', but also, entered in The Guinness Book of World Records when he announced his World Tour for 2006, selling 1.6 million tickets in one single day.[57] Williams kicked off his Close Encounters World Tour in South Africa in April 2006; when he finished his European leg of the tour, 2.5 million people had seen the show and, after touring Latin America and Australia, the numbers went up to 3 million.[58]\n\n2006–2009: Rudebox and Reality Killed the Video Star\n\nMain articles: Rudebox and Reality Killed the Video Star\n\nWilliams released his much anticipated dance/electro album, Rudebox, on 23 October 2006. It featured collaborations with the Pet Shop Boys, William Orbit, Soul Mekanik, Joey Negro, Mark Ronson, Chris Grierson, and The Orr Boys. It received mixed reviews: Allmusic gave it a four star rating, the NME 8 out of 10, and Music Week and MOJO were equally positive,[59] but it received much weaker reviews from some of the British press. The album sold 2× Platinum in Europe with sales of over 2 million making it the fastest platinum-selling album of 2006.[60] To promote his album, Williams commissioned a series of short films.[61] Goodbye to the Normals was directed by Jim Field Smith and features \"Burslem Normals\" by Williams.\n\nIn February 2009, it was confirmed that Williams had written material with Guy Chambers and Mark Ronson. A spokesman said that Williams was planning to begin the recording sessions in March and that the new album would be released in late 2009. This will probably be the last Williams album released by EMI.[62] On his official website, Williams confirmed that he was working with producer Trevor Horn on his new album, which would eventually be titled Reality Killed the Video Star,[63] a reference to the song \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" by Horn's former band the Buggles. The album was released on 9 November 2009 in the United Kingdom.[64]\n\nOn 11 October 2009 Williams published a 12-track compilation album, titled Songbook, as a free CD for the newspaper The Mail on Sunday. That same evening, Williams made his \"comeback\" on The X Factor results show, performing his new single \"Bodies\" for the first time live.[65] On 20 October 2009 Williams opened the BBC Electric Proms at the London RoundHouse.[66] It was his first live concert for 3 years and was broadcast across 200 cinemas worldwide.[67] Accompanied by a string section, horn section, full band and producer Trevor Horn, Williams performed several new tracks from Reality Killed the Video Star and older tracks.[67]\n\nReality Killed the Video Star was previewed in the UK on the Spotify music streaming service on 6 November 2009, and official released on 9 November.[68] In a high-profile chart battle, Williams' album was pitted against X Factor 2008 runners-up JLS who released their debut album the same day. JLS beat Williams to the number one spot by 1500 sales. The album was also released in the United States (Williams' first album to be released there since 2002's Escapology). In late November 2009, Williams travelled to Australia to perform at the ARIA Music Awards of 2009.[69]\n\n2010–2012: In and Out of Consciousness and Take the Crown\n\nIn October 2010, Williams released his second greatest hits album, In and Out of Consciousness: The Greatest Hits 1990–2010, to celebrate 20 years as a performing artist. A single, \"Shame\", was also released, which was written and sung by Williams and Barlow.\n\nOn 21 October 2011 Williams signed with Island Records (Universal Music), following his departure from his previous record label EMI in 2010.[70]\n\nWilliams was the opening act at the Diamond Jubilee Concert, which was co-organised by Gary Barlow, held outside Buckingham Palace on 4 June 2012.[71] During the end of August his official website began a countdown to the release of information regarding his latest solo material, with an image of his face and his mind unveiled daily as the countdown expired.[72] Titled Take the Crown, the album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart making it Williams' tenth number one album. It also marked the second time that Williams had a number one single (\"Candy\") and album at the same time on the chart. The first time was in 2001 when \"Somethin' Stupid\" and Swing When You're Winning were number one on the singles and albums chart respectively.[73]\n\nThe album's lead single, \"Candy\", premiered on 10 September 2012 and was released on 11 September in most countries and 29 October in the UK. In the UK, \"Candy\" became Williams' first number one single since \"Radio\" (2004) and his seventh solo number one single. In its first week the song had sold 137,000 copies becoming the fastest-selling male artist single of the year.[74] On 26 November 2012 Williams announced a 17 date stadium tour of Europe.[75][76] Williams also confirmed that the support act for the tour would be Olly Murs who also duets with him on \"Kids\". Universal and EMI merged in 2012, bringing Williams' Chrysalis/Virgin recordings full circle to Universal.\n\n2013–2014: Swings Both Ways and Under the Radar Volume 1\n\nIn September 2013, Williams announced a follow-up to his 2001 swing album, titled Swings Both Ways for release in November.

I cannot trust me. I don't know what I'm going to do at any time. There's no, sort of, plan. The plan was, sing in key, don't fall over. That was the plan and 99% of the plan, I pulled off.\" When asked did the idea just enter his head he responded, \"Nothing actually pops into my head. There's a block between me and sense... then something happens and then five minutes later, I'm like, 'Did I? Yeah, I did, didn't I?\".[89]\n\nOn 17 July 2018, Williams along with his wife, and One Direction star Louis Tomlinson, were announced as the new judges on the fifteenth series of The X Factor in the UK, joining Simon Cowell and replacing Louis Walsh, Sharon Osbourne and Nicole Scherzinger.[90]\n\n2019–present: The Christmas Present, Lufthaus, and XXV\n\nOn 22 November, Williams released his first Christmas album titled The Christmas Present, which features guest appearances from boxer Tyson Fury, Rod Stewart, Jamie Cullum, Helene Fischer and Bryan Adams.

His appearance attracted criticism due to Qatar's human rights abuses and strict LGBT laws.[111][112][113] After the criticism, Williams stated, \"I don't condone any abuses of human rights anywhere [...] if we're not condoning human rights abuses anywhere, then it would be the shortest tour the world has ever known: I wouldn't even be able to perform in my own kitchen [...] Anybody leaving messages saying 'no to Qatar' are doing so on Chinese technology [...] the hypocrisy there is that if we take that case in this place, we need to apply that unilaterally to the world. Then if we apply that unilaterally to the world, nobody can go anywhere.\"[114]\n\nOn 5 May 2023, Williams was featured on the bilingual single \"Une Tahitienne á Paris\", by French singer Mareva Galanter.[115][116] On 21 August 2023, Williams was featured with a cameo performance on the single \"Punk's Dead\", by English duo Soft Play.[117] Lufthaus' debut album, \"Visions, Volume 1\" was released on 6 October 2023.

He said: \"I just thought I'd save them the audacity of me even trying to step on a stage and be in the same echelon as Freddie Mercury. Because he, to me, is angelic. He's godlike. It was just too scary.\"[143]\n\nWilliams has revealed that he does the \"Elvis Prayer\" before going on stage at every concert.
