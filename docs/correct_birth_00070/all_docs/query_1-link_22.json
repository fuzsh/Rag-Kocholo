        "text": "Happy Birthday, Robbie Williams! The singer-songwriter, who first made his name as one-fifth of the Nineties boyband Take That, celebrates a milestone birthday on Tuesday.\n\nThe popstar, who hails from Stoke-on-Trent, is known not only for his illustrious music career but also for his colourful personal life, from his star-studded romances to his struggle with substance abuse. As the singing sensation turns 50, we take a look back at his life and career…\n\nCareer beginnings and the formation of Take That\n\nIt all started in 1990 when Robbie's mum, Janet, read an advertisement seeking members for a new boy band and suggested her 16-year-old son audition for a place. Robbie was the youngest member of the group, joining Gary Barlow, Mark Owen, Jason Orange and Howard Donald in Take That.\n\nThe teen singing sensation quickly became a fan favourite, performing lead vocals for some of the group's earliest hits, including 'Could It Be Magic' and 'I Found Heaven'.\n\nRobbie's 'feud' with bandmate Gary Barlow\n\nOver the years, there's been much speculation about the relationship between Robbie and his fellow bandmate Gary during their time in Take That.\n\nOpening up about their rumoured feud in his Netflix documentary, Robbie said: \"It seemed like there was one person being managed in Take That and it was Gary Barlow. As a young person, I would have been jealous of that and a lot of me resented him.\"\n\nHe went on to say: \"I disliked Gary the most because he was the one who was supposed to have everything and the career, and I wanted to make him pay. I was vengeful,\" adding: \"I'm sorry I treated Gary like that.\"\n\nSubstance abuse issues\n\nAs the group's popularity grew, Robbie began to struggle with mental health, alcoholism and addiction – issues that would eventually result in his departure from the band.\n\n\"I was ingesting everything I could get my hands on,\" Robbie said of his reckless behaviour with drugs and alcohol. \"Ecstasy, cocaine, drinking - I'm literally drinking a bottle of vodka a night before going into rehearsals. So that's happening... that's happening every night.\"\n\nTake That departure and early solo career\n\n1995 is a year that Take That fans will never forget, as it marks the year that Robbie left the band. In July, the singer took a step back from the group during their Nobody Else world tour – a decision that sparked great upset amongst their fanbase and attracted wide media attention.\n\nWhile it's been widely reported that Robbie left the band due to his issues with addiction and alcoholism, he opened up about the decision in his Netflix documentary that aired last year.\n\n\"The sense that I wasn't ready or capable to fulfil the role that was being asked of me was palpable,\" he said. \"One day I went in for rehearsals, and then at lunchtime, they said, 'Rob, we need to have a band meeting.' I said to the boys I just couldn't be there anymore.\n\n\"Then they said, 'Look, we wanna see if we can do this tour as a four-piece. What do you think?'\n\n\"And in the end, 'What do you think?' was me deciding to leave Take That.\"\n\nThe group officially disbanded on February 13 1996 – Robbie's 22nd birthday. Just a few months later, Robbie signed with Chrysalis Records and embarked on his solo career.\n\nHis first two singles, 'Old Before I Die' and a cover of George Michael's 'Freedom' landed a place at number two in the UK singles chart, with his debut album Life thru a Lens hitting number 11 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\nRobbie's fourth single, 'Angels', became a huge hit in Europe and Latin America, and remained in the British top ten for forty weeks, making it the 58th best-selling album in UK history with sales of over 2.4 million.\n\nIn 1998, the singer dropped his second album, I've Been Expecting You, which entered the charts at number one. His first single from the album, 'Millennium' secured Robbie his first solo Number 1 single in the UK, with 'She's The One' also landing the top spot.\n\nRise to stardom\n\nThe start of the millennium marked the release of Robbie's third album, Sing When You're Winning, which included the hit single 'Rock DJ'. The following year, he released his first Swing album, collaborating with the likes of Rupert Everett, Nicole Kidman, Jon Lovitz and Jane Horrocks.\n\nAfter winning a string of BRIT Awards, Robbie set his sights on America and signed a record-breaking deal £80 million contract with EMI, prompting the release of his fifth studio album, Escapology.\n\nThis was followed by three consecutive concerts at Knebworth Festival in 2003, where he played to 125,000 people each night, making it the biggest event in UK music history.\n\nStar-studded dating history\n\nBefore meeting his now-wife Ayda Williams, Robbie was linked to various famous faces, including Spice Girls Mel C and Geri Halliwell, whom he briefly dated in the mid-90s and early noughties respectively.\n\nHe also had an on-and-off relationship with All Saints singer Nicola Appleton after they met on Top Of The Pops in 1997. After several months of dating the pair got engaged but called things off just a few weeks later.\n\nIn her autobiography, Together, released in 2002, Nicole revealed that she had aborted her and Robbie's baby and said she had been pressured by her record company.\n\nREAD: Inside Robbie Williams' dating history - from Geri Halliwell, Mel C to Nicole Appleton\n\nMove to Los Angeles and meeting Ayda Field\n\nIn 2006, Robbie relocated to Los Angeles, where he continued to focus on his solo career and release more albums. In the same year, he met his future wife Ayda Field, an actress who rose to fame playing Angela Moroni on Days of Our Lives.\n\nThe couple first crossed paths at a party after working together on a UFO documentary that Robbie was producing for Radio 4. While Ayda previously admitted that she felt the pair had \"nothing in common\" when she first met the 'Angels' hitmaker, it didn't take long before sparks were flying between the two.\n\n\"There was just this moment where we were laughing and I cannot even tell you what happened. It was like the universe opened up,\" Ayda revealed in Robbie's Netflix documentary.\n\nHer husband added: \"I had this moment where I felt I'd known her forever.\"\n\nStint in rehab\n\nDuring the early days of his romance with Ayda, Robbie was dealing with addiction and told his girlfriend that he had to get better before the couple could be with one another.\n\n\"I understood it because I saw that he was unwell. I just want you to get better. Whatever you need to do and I was just so crestfallen. He was my soulmate and then he was gone,\" Ayda explained in the series.\n\nOpening about his addiction, Robbie, who was diagnosed with depression in his early 20s, said; \"Everybody knew I was in trouble, but they didn't care, I'd gone past the point of no return. My life had spiralled out of control so severely that my manager understood what needed to happen, I needed to be carted off to rehab.\n\n\"I used to drink and do drugs because it helped me not feel this way, when you strip that away all the everything comes up that you've been suppressing and I’ve been suppressing that for years. I’m depressed and I’m mentally ill.\"\n\nOn his 33rd birthday in 2007, Robbie checked into rehab after taking Class A and prescription drugs.\n\nAfter seeking treatment, the singer left the rehabilitation centre and reunited with Ayda. By 2009, the couple were engaged.\n\nTake That reunion\n\nIn 2010, Robbie delighted fans with his surprise return to Take That. Together, they released the hugely successful album, Progress, before embarking on a successful tour across the UK and Europe.\n\nWhile he remained a part of the band, Robbie chose not to be involved in the group's seventh and eighth studio albums, instead focusing on his solo career. He did, however, reunite with his bandmates for a special 40-minute virtual performance during the coronavirus lockdown of May 2020.\n\nHappy marriage to Ayda and becoming a dad\n\nRobbie and Ayda tied the knot in a stunning ceremony at their Los Angeles home in August 2010 before going on to welcome four children: Teddy, 11, Charlie, nine, Colette, five, and three-year-old Beau."
