        "text": "About\n\nRobbie Williams' journey to stardom was not a solitary one; it was shaped by the love and determination of his mother, Theresa Janet Farrell. Born into a family that ran 'The Red Lion,' a pub in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, Robbie's early years were infused with an atmosphere of camaraderie and entertainment.\n\nHowever, when Robbie was just three years old, his parents' marriage came to an end in 1977. After the divorce, it was Theresa, often affectionately referred to as \"Jan,\" who took on the role of raising Rob on her own. The bond between mother and son grew strong, and Jan played a pivotal role in her son's journey to fame.\n\nJan's influence on Robbie's career was serendipitous. She spotted an advertisement for auditions for a new boy band called Take That in a local newspaper, an opportunity that would prove to be the launching pad for Robbie's musical career. Her keen eye and support led Robbie to audition for the band, eventually becoming a member and setting the stage for his rise to fame.\n\nJan's impact on Robbie extended beyond his career. She served as the inspiration behind some of his songs, including \"One of God's Better People.\" In 1998, Robbie openly acknowledged the profound role his mother played in his life, stating, \"My mum is the pillar of strength that has kept me sane throughout my mad life. She's the most important woman in my life and always will be.\"\n\nJan herself had a career as an alcohol and drugs counselor, further emphasizing her commitment to making a positive impact on others' lives.\n\nIn the story of Robbie Williams, the influence of a strong, supportive, and determined mother is woven throughout his journey to fame and success. It's a testament to the power of a loving family and the pivotal role parents can play in their children's lives."
