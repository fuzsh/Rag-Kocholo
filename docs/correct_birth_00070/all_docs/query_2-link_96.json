        "text": "British pop star Robbie Williams has teamed up with The Greatest Showman director Michael Gracey on a feature about his life and career, with filming to start in Melbourne later this year.\n\nSet to become one of the largest movies to be filmed in Victoria, Australia’s most southern mainland state, Better Man will film at Docklands Studios Melbourne with the best of Victoria’s screen industry talent, on both sides of the camera.\n\nDirected and co-written by Melbourne-born Gracey, Better Man will offer an introspective look into the experiences that shaped the popular entertainer.\n\nWilliams said filming in Melbourne was an ideal location.\n\n“I’m so excited I am making this movie in Victoria with my friend Michael Gracey.”\n\nRobbie Williams\n\nGracey, who was an Executive Producer on the Elton John biopic Rocketman, said Melbourne was the perfect place to make the film.\n\n“To tell Robbie William’s beautiful, distinct story, back home, in my own city, is a dream come true. There is a creative energy that burns across the Melbourne film industry, and I know this movie will thrive here with the support of the Australian Government’s Producer Offset and Film Victoria’s incentive program.”\n\nMichael Gracey\n\nBetter Man was attracted to Victoria through the Victorian Screen Incentive and is one of many high-profile projects currently underway in Victoria.\n\nNBC’s hit sci-fi series La Brea has just announced it is returning to Melbourne shoot its second season; Sarah Snook is set to star in horror/thriller Run Rabbit Run following her recent Golden Globe Award win for Succession; and The Dressmaker director Jocelyn Moorhouse is back in Victoria for Savage River, a gripping crime drama series with Golden Globe-nominee Katherine Langford (Thirteen Reasons Why, Knives Out).\n\nWant to find out more about filming in Victoria or the Victorian Screen Incentive?\n\nContact Film Victoria’s Manager of Production Attraction & Support Joe Brinkmann"
