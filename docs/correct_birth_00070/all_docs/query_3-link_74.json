        "text": "About\n\nRobbie Williams' journey in the world of entertainment has deep roots, stretching back to his formative years. Born to parents who ran 'The Red Lion,' a pub in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, his life was steeped in the world of showmanship from the start. However, the course of his life took shape when his parents, Peter Clive Williams and Jan Williams, divorced in 1977 when Robbie was just three years old.\n\nAfter the divorce, Robbie's father, Peter, turned his focus towards a career in stand-up comedy and singing. He became an entertainments manager at various holiday locations, including Carmarthen Bay Holiday Village in Kidwelly, and Holme Lacy House in Hereford, among others. It was during Robbie's summer holidays that he had a front-row seat to the world of entertainment. He spent these seasons backstage, observing and absorbing the performances of entertainers. At the age of 10 or 11, the spark of inspiration ignited in Robbie, and he realized that this was what he wanted to do. Despite Peter's efforts to dissuade him, he saw in Robbie that special quality, often referred to as the \"X Factor.\"\n\nPeter Williams, known affectionately as \"Poppa Pete\" in recent years, also had ties to the Port Vale Social Club, which fostered Robbie's lifelong affinity with the football club. In 2013, Pete married Melanie Mills, who was 25 years his junior, in one of Robbie's opulent mansions. Unfortunately, their marriage didn't endure, and they divorced in 2018.\n\nIn 2015, a significant development occurred in Pete's relationship with Robbie. Pete began joining his son on tour, where they would share the stage and sing one song together, either \"Better Man\" or \"Sweet Caroline.\"\n\nRobbie's father pursued a career under the stage name Conway when he ventured into the world of entertainment, choosing the last name of a close friend. In recent years, he's been commonly known by the nickname \"Poppa Pete.\" In February 2018, he joined Twitter with the handle @poppapete299.\n\nIn 2019, Robbie released the album \"The Christmas Present,\" which included a heartfelt duet with his father titled \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" Pete announced his retirement during \"The Robbie Williams Christmas Show;\" the special Homecoming gig planned for Stoke-on-Trent in June 2020. Regrettably, the concert was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAdding to the family's challenges, in 2020, it became public knowledge that Pete had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Despite the hurdles, the Williams family's deep connection to the world of entertainment, their enduring love, and their shared experiences continue to be a defining thread in their lives."
