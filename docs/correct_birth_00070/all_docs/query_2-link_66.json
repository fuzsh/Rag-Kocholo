        "text": "Robbie Williams launches his Australian tour tomorrow night to celebrate 25 years as a solo artist, but some things have changed for the 49-year-old father.\n\n\"There used to be a bevy of semi-clad beauties hanging around me,\" the pop star said.\n\nThe popularity surrounding some of his greatest hits, such as the 1997 power ballad Angels, however, continues.\n\n\"I consciously know that song gave me my career and it exists outside of me. It belongs to the people and it's bigger than me\", he said.\n\nFor Williams, Australia has always held a special place in his heart.\n\nDuring a time when he struggled to feel accepted by his home country, the English singer felt understood by audiences down under.\n\n\"I feel as though Australia has always seen me, and I feel as though it's kind of an adopted home in my heart and soul because I'm not scared or embarrassed or ashamed to be me here.\"\n\nHe's discussed moving to Australia with his wife, American actress Ayda Field, and their four children, frequently.\n\n\"We're always aggrieved and sad because we always decide it's too far … my whole life and my biggest audience and my job is based in Europe,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's not lost on me that the people that I feel most comfortable around are Aussies, because you can joke here.\"\n\nAfter releasing a four-part docuseries last week — reflecting on his struggles with addiction and rise to stardom — Williams is set to embark on a nine-show tour across the country, starting in Sydney tomorrow night.\n\nNostalgia for Generation X\n\nWhile the music industry around him evolved, Williams did not choose to reinvent himself like so many other artists.\n\nInstead, he re-mastered his greatest hits time and time again, serving as a piece of nostalgia for Generation X.\n\nHe said he sticks to the classics to take the stress out of performing.\n\nTeen star\n\nMore than 30 years ago, at just 16 years old, Williams shot to fame in the 1990s pop group Take That, with hits Back for Good, Never Forget, and Babe.\n\nHe quit the group in 1995 after battling with drug addiction. The rest of the band split up the following year.\n\nBut as the broken hearts of adolescent girls began to mend over his shock departure, so did Williams's career.\n\nJust two years later, in 1997, he released his debut solo album Life thru a Lens.\n\nAt the height of his fame, in 2003, Williams performed to a record 375,000 people over three days at Knebworth House in Hertfordshire, England — a record which the BBC says has not been broken since.\n\nTake That eventually reunited without Williams, who rejoined in 2010 to re-record their songs.\n\nIt became one of the fastest-selling albums of the century.\n\nMore than 20 years after the smash-hit Kids was recorded with Australian pop icon Kylie Minogue, Williams recreated the duo with Delta Goodrem at the 2022 AFL Grand Final."
