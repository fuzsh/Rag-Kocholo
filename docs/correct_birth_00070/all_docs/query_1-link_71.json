        "text": "Robbie Williams has been famous for 30 years - a career of many thrilling peaks and a few miserable troughs. Now back with a new album, he discusses self-esteem, social-media spats and settling down\n\nTen years ago, Robbie Williams had just bought a house in a village in Wiltshire. He’d been in retirement from pop stardom for a couple of years – though not everyone was aware of it – vegetating in Los Angeles with a beard and a kaftan, not doing very much at all except eating crisps and doughnuts and looking for UFOs.\n\nAt a recent football match in Brentford, the crowd had sung, ‘You’re not famous any more,’ so he thought it would probably be quite safe to go out to Devizes, the local market town, for a coffee. ‘Thirty people followed me back to the car, as if I was the village fete,’ he says now. ‘And it made the local newspaper.’\n\n‘Pop star Robbie Williams has been seen out and about in Devizes today,’ read the article. ‘The singer, who is moving into a mansion near Calne, was out with his girlfriend and his dog in the town. He was spotted sitting on a wall outside the library. He later bought a drink in Costa Coffee. Have you seen Robbie? Send us the details and a picture…’\n\nThese days, he says, he only leaves the house for golf. Or the odd social occasion. Tonight, for example, he is going to Windsor’s Royal Lodge, home of Sarah Ferguson, for dinner.\n\nGolf? Fergie? Is this the same Robbie Williams who once staggered to the house of fellow Take That member Gary Barlow after drinking a couple of Poco Locos (key ingredients: mescaline, ecstasy and acid), speaking in tongues and telling him he had found God?\n\nIt is. But actually, he admits, he’s still an addict, and golf is one of his many new addictions – relatively healthy ones, or more so than crack, anyway: Fifa, golf, boxing, computers, Football Manager. He just gets bored so easily.\n\nAt the moment golf is also his main form of exercise. ‘I walk 18 holes. And if you carry your bag – which I don’t – it burns 1,900 calories.’ He used to play when he was a teenager, but then stopped. ‘Now it’s become one of those things I’m totally addicted to, and I can spend three hours thinking about the next shot, and I wonder if they have golf in heaven – and then one day I just stop. And don’t play again for 12 years.’\n\nGolf in heaven? Perhaps he really has found God – or perhaps the grown-up that he always suspected was lurking within him has emerged. ‘Nah, the grown-up hasn’t arrived. But he sometimes turns up when I have to discipline the kids. And it is the grown-up who has been faithful to his wife for 13 years.’\n\nHe is 45 now, clean and sober for a long while, and a lot has changed since the Poco Loco days. ‘But I’m always going to be a bit childlike and man-boyish.’\n\nWilliams lives mainly in Los Angeles but is here for two reasons: for the RSC’s musical adaptation of David Walliams’s book The Boy in the Dress, for which he and Guy Chambers, his long-time songwriting partner, have provided the music (with a little help from the writer Chris Heath); but chiefly to promote The Christmas Present, a double album that mixes seasonal cover songs and originals. It includes such festive stalwarts as Let it Snow, and a surprisingly palatable and matey big-band version of the execrable Slade hit Merry Xmas Everybody.\n\nJamie Cullum appears on that, just one guest appearance in a varied collection that includes Williams’s daughter Teddy and his dad Pete, along with Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart and – weirdly – Tyson Fury, whom Williams met when he did a residency in Las Vegas. He had seen Fury sing after fights and enlisted him for the album.\n\nRobbie Williams and Christmas is an obvious combination. ‘I haven’t made a Christmas album before because I’ve been interested in making the perfect pop record – or at least just getting better – by practising and practising and practising,’ he says. ‘But I’ve given up on that now.’\n\nIn the past 30 years, he has won a record 18 Brit Awards (including those for Take That), and has sold 80 million albums in his solo career alone. Now, he says, it’s about ‘building new doors to go through. My raison d’être for the last three years has been trying to write that record that stays around for ever.’\n\nIt’s a lofty ambition, but as he says, he’s fashioned a life out of unrealistic expectations, so why not carry on?\n\nChristmas songs were a big thing in his childhood home. ‘They are the fabric of people’s lives,’ he says. Christmases growing up in Stoke must have been very different from the ones he has now. ‘My mum worked very hard to create memories for us and she did a fantastic job of it. My mum is from a council estate, and she got a loan to open her own shop in a wealthy area – we’re talking wealthy for Stoke-on-Trent, don’t get me wrong, it’s not Sloane Street – and gave us these memories at Christmas that I’ll have all my life.’\n\nHis parents divorced when he was three, and Williams was largely brought up by his mother, Janet, and his grandmother, his adored 'Nan', who ‘spoiled me with love. She just beamed acceptance and love at me all day.’ His father Pete, who lived nearby, was a club entertainer (and former policeman) who was obsessed with music, in particular Matt Monro. What was the festive season like?\n\n‘I just remember the smell that emanated from the radiators,’ he says, a little oddly. ‘It was hot and the house felt soporific and womb-like, and there’d be a tree with tinsel and presents underneath – and I would take a razor blade and slit them slightly so I could have a look without anyone knowing.’\n\nThe wife. That would be Ayda Field, an American actor whom Williams met in 2006 – during a particularly arduous drug binge – and married in 2010. (Their dogs were her bridesmaids.) He loves her. Boy does he love her. The praise pours out of him: ‘She’s incredibly trustworthy, incredibly smart, incredibly funny, incredibly interesting to look at. I never get used to seeing that face – and it always changes. She’s my cheerleader and she’s got my best interests at heart. And we’re very comfortable in each other’s company.’\n\nField is quite dry. ‘She’s got a British sense of humour – she totally gets irony. She’s naughty, she’s rude and she’s vulgar – not in public, but she is.’ He looks thoughtful. ‘She says “dickhead” really well.’\n\nIn 2016 she joined Loose Women, ITV’s lunchtime chat show, and having been around Williams for a while came out with a lot of expressions that might not be considered suitable for daytime television: ‘Bollocks,’ ‘It’s pissing it down,’ and so on. (They are a sweary household.\n\nWilliams is fond of telling a story about a time he took his then three-year-old daughter to play in the shared private garden of their house in London, where he had to ask some nannies to delete photographs they’d taken of Teddy. Walking back to the house with her he muttered, ‘F—king idiots,’ under his breath – and with a cheery wave, Teddy turned to the nannies and called, ‘Bye f—king idiots!’)\n\nThey responded with a sharp little video posted on Instagram, in which Field squeals, ‘Oh, please take me with you!’ when Williams says he’s going to work, and then confuses a picture of Ann Widdecombe for one of Walsh.\n\nIt was funny, and fairly light-hearted revenge, but the truth is that Williams was very upset when he read Walsh’s comments. ‘When people say things about me, I get really angry and want to get them back, but when it’s about your family, it’s a whole other realm, and I had an absolute f—king panic attack.’\n\nDuring their X Factor run, the couple had been goaded, he says, into ‘being mean about Louis’ by the producers on the show, ‘but we had no reason to, and so we were having none of it’. And Walsh had met Field, Williams continues, and even told her ‘that she was extremely talented, and too good for Loose Women, so…’\n\nRevenge, these days, is dangerously easy to execute. Social media gives you so many options, but its impact can be out of proportion to the original slight. What did Williams think about the Rooney/Vardy debacle?\n\n‘There was a dramatic overcorrection,’ he says. ‘Let’s say Rebekah Vardy was guilty – which we don’t know. How she will feel inside right now is 10 times worse than how Coleen Rooney would have felt when those things were happening to her. It’s a dangerous game to play.\n\nOnce something’s out there, he says, it’s beyond your control. ‘It becomes a 16- headed monster.’\n\nWilliams is a man who knows about shame. It is one reason he is not allowed to know his own Twitter password: he banned himself. But not long ago someone on his staff – a new person who didn’t know the rules – gave it to him and he had a 48-hour binge. ‘And I became engulfed with resentment and anger and shame and fear and all those things. Then I was on a plane to Majorca and I phoned my manager and said’ – theatrical whisper – ‘“I’ve found my password – change it and don’t give me the new one.” He said, “Oh no, what have you done?” and I said, “Just do it. I’m one tweet away from a career-ender.”\n\n‘Because in anger I can be quite creative and my aggression would serve me badly.’\n\nIn what way? ‘There would be people who were showing their disdain,’ he says darkly. ‘And I’d go and find them and show my disdain back. And then I’d turn into a self-lacerating hate machine.’\n\nBut, he says seriously, ‘I don’t understand why I’m drawn like a magnet to try and find out why my deepest fears about myself are true. It’s as if I constantly need to bolster the self-hatred.’\n\nHe is not as affected by it as he used to be. ‘But it just becomes part of your daily routine: cup of tea, go for a wee, hate yourself.’\n\nDon’t you relish any of the good things you read about yourself? ‘It’s nice that they’re there, but they don’t affect me as much as the hate.’\n\nAnd the hate is easy to find on Twitter. ‘Yeah, and I find some very easy retort to cut them down to size.’\n\nDoes that give you any real satisfaction, or is it only momentary?\n\n‘I don’t know what the f—k it is, but it’s just wrong.’\n\nOh Robbie. He tried therapy but didn’t like the therapist (‘He just told me to develop a thicker skin’), though he does approve of it in general, and thinks it should be on offer in schools (‘Understanding why I think what I think and do what I do would have been so much more important for me than geography’). Still, things are looking up. ‘Last night before I went to bed I noticed that I have moments of quite lovely self-esteem – but they are fleeting, and I wonder why I can’t hold on to them.’\n\nHaving a family has helped. ‘It focuses everything and it’s made my life much richer and opened up this whole other level that I wasn’t going to experience because I didn’t used to want kids. For all the anxiety that children bring, or for all the new creative ways to hate myself that I come up with, they also bring something that totally outweighs it.’\n\nHe lets Field lead the way with parenting. He knows when to pick his battles, he says, and let things go. ‘She’s more sensible than me. I would say, “Yeah, let them jump off the wall and hurt themselves, then they won’t do it again” – whereas Ayda would say, “Let’s get that wall taken down so that they don’t jump off.”’\n\nAt the moment his family travel everywhere with him because he can’t bear to be without them. While the children are here they are home-schooled in an annexe at the side of the house, but, he says, that can’t go on for ever. ‘Ayda really wants the kids to have the experience of school, but I’m not bothered about that. We’re still in transition, trying to figure it out.’\n\nHe is not a Lego dad; he finds it difficult ‘to do the playing thing’. But he likes colouring in (he shows me the result of a mammoth session, which he did to distract himself when he gave up smoking in January) and reading to the children. He has read The Tiger Who Came to Tea to Teddy ‘1,000 times’, and is singing on Hey Tiger!, the theme tune for Channel 4’s Christmas adaptation of the book (composed by Grammy-winner David Arnold, with lyrics by Don Black). ‘It was a huge bonding session, reading that book to her. It felt like a real “I’m a dad” moment. Teddy was learning how to speak and I left a gap at the end of each sentence and she would finish it.’\n\nOn cue, Field pops in with Teddy, a lovely dark-haired seven-year-old, who has something to share.\n\n‘Coco just took her first steps!’ says Field.\n\n‘Our baby just walked,’ Teddy explains to me kindly.\n\n‘You’re joking!’ says Williams. ‘That’s so exciting!’\n\n‘You’ll see her do it,’ says Field. ‘We’ll have her practise a little and do some push-ups.’\n\nLater, Coco, a sturdy little 13-month-old – ‘She’s in the 98th percentile!’ says Williams proudly – does a turn across the kitchen floor for us, to her own evident delight.\n\nCoco is their third child and was born to a surrogate mother (last week Field revealed she’d like to have a fourth). A few years ago, Williams found that his sperm wasn’t very active (‘In fact it’s dead now,’ he announces cheerfully), and had it frozen. Field also had complications, and they experienced some stressful rounds of IVF. ‘Heartbreaking times when Ayda was filling herself with hormones that were making her feel deathly, and it just wasn’t happening.’ So they found ‘an incredible surrogate’ who has become part of their family. ‘And we love them and they love us, and for me it’s not weird.’\n\nWilliams and Field were at the birth. ‘My wife got to stand there with the oven mitts on waiting for the baby to come out,’ he says, ‘and she didn’t have to suffer with postnatal depression or her body exploding, and months of looking after a child who’s just been born when physically you yourself need looking after.’\n\nRobbie Williams is fully aware of how lucky he is. A working-class boy from Stoke, he was in line to be in the Army, or the police force. Or a drug dealer, he says. But here he is, still the consummate pop star. ‘People are lucky if they get five years – or even one song. After Take That, I had 10 years where I couldn’t miss a ball, even though some of the shots were really f—king bad.’\n\nIt was nearly three decades ago that he joined the group as a 16-year-old, on £150 a week. He left after five years (though he rejoined in 2010 for an album and a tour). It must all seem an awfully long time ago now. Does he still have any kind of relationship with the remaining members, Mark Owen, Howard Donald and Gary Barlow?\n\n‘Yes I do,’ he says, ‘though it’s an email relationship now. It’s a box of toys to be played with at a later date. Always is. But there is a universal cord that pulls us back together.’\n\nLet’s play Shag/Marry/Kill, I suggest – partly in order to stop Williams getting bored – with the three members of Take That.\n\nHe looks unfazed. ‘I’d marry Mark. We were best mates. Howard’s got a lovely bum, and great pecs – I’d shag Howard. But I’m not killing Gary. I’d marry Gary too. We would be the odd couple, but I don’t think we’d be bored. It would have to be Shag/Marry/Marry – I’d be a bigamist.’\n\nLater, Williams shows me round the house, which has been decorated magnificently by The Wife, with wooden floors and alluring lighting and lots of art everywhere (‘She was on a budget,’ he emphasises). There is a Banksy in the kitchen, and what looks like a Warhol print in the sitting room. The children’s bedroom is enchanting, their little beds draped with curtains so they look like mini-four-posters. Then we go to his studio to see Williams’s own art, which he has been working on while he’s here – huge canvases covered in graffiti-style designs in shiny floor paint. It’s only a few minutes away but we travel there in his latest toy, which he calls ‘the van’: a Mercedes JetStar, akin to a first-class plane cabin with four seats, equipped with Wi-Fi and two TV screens, and cut off from the driver.\n\nHe presses a button. ‘Neil?’ he says.\n\n‘Yes?’ comes the disembodied voice from the front.\n\n‘Nothing. Just showing off.’\n\nDrivers, cooks, a nanny, teachers, security – this is a lifestyle that costs a lot of money to maintain. But as well as royalties and concert fees, Williams can earn ‘mind-blowing amounts’ performing at, say, private parties – which he has done quite a lot. Does he still do that, and does he regret any of them?\n\n‘Yes I do, and no I don’t.’\n\nHow was Philip Green’s?\n\n‘Well I would have signed an NDA – but if I’d not signed an NDA it would have been perfectly fine.’\n\nHow do you judge whether to do one? It can’t just be the money.\n\n‘Yeah, it is.’\n\nYou wouldn’t make a decision based on that alone, would you?\n\n‘Yeah, I would.’\n\nYou don’t need the money, do you?\n\n‘Yeah, I do.’\n\nAdmittedly I got this off Google, but as of 2019, Robbie Williams’s net worth is supposedly £230 million. (Other estimates are closer to £150 million.) Williams himself says he only has enough actual cash to maintain his lifestyle for the next couple of years.\n\n‘The thing about money is the more you have, the more toys you get. And they all need paying for. Of course I could have less houses, less staff, less toys – but I don’t want to. I like my life. But my life costs money. It’s just how it is.’\n\nHe has no desire, he says, to go to some remote Scottish cottage away from it all for a holiday with only his family. ‘I’d have to take the staff with me,’ he laughs. ‘Because we like not having to do s—t for ourselves. It’s nice. Technically we could do that – but we wouldn’t want to – we really like life like this.\n\n‘It’s such a bubble to live in, I know, and you shouldn’t really talk about these kinds of things in public, but I talk about an awful lot of things I shouldn’t discuss in public.’\n\nThat’s why we love you, Robbie.\n\n‘Thank you.’\n\nThere must be moments, I say, when you think, how did this happen?\n\nAll the time, says Williams. ‘When I’m on stage there’s always a moment when I think, how on earth have I pulled this off?’\n\nDid you feel like that last year when you were at a royal wedding (that of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank, where Teddy was a bridesmaid)?\n\n‘No, not really… First and foremost, they are my mates; no matter who they are outside our relationship, they’re Jack and Euge – and they make me laugh. I really admire them, because of how they’ve grown up and what they’re supposed to be compared to what they actually are. There was an immense sense of pride about the whole occasion, but mainly it was my two mates getting married.’"
