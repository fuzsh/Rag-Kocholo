        "text": "Rap megastar Drake has reportedly just bought pop icon Robbie Williams' sprawling Los Angeles estate for a whopping $116.5 million.\n\nLocated in the opulent locale of Beverly Crest, the property is spread over nearly 81,000-square-metres of supreme, blue-chip, manicured grounds.\n\nAlthough photos of the notoriously private property are hard to come by, trust us when we say, this place has got the lot, and then some.\n\nMuch like Drake (and Williams, for that matter), the estate's mansion is larger than life, boasting a scarcely believable 2322-square-metres of internal living space, 10 bedrooms and 22 bathrooms, if you can believe it.\n\nREAD MORE: Justin Bieber's producer poisoned by his own home\n\nThere's also a four-bedroom guest house, which is larger than your average family home.\n\nFeatures and benefits of the sprawling property border on the innumerable, but some of the headline perks include a giant pool, championship tennis court, an elevator, expansive wine cellar and a home gym.\n\nConsidering the home's past and now new owner are both music industry luminaries, we wouldn't be surprised if there was also a producing studio in the gargantuan main home, too.\n\nAccording to Mansion Global, Williams scooped up the impressive property in 2015 for $44.8 million, meaning the Brit will make an absolute killing in the sale.\n\nMore precisely, the 48-year-old is looking at a cool $71 million-plus profit in just seven short years.\n\nAnd if that doesn't sound crazy enough, some rough math shows that the stunning estate earned Williams nearly $28,000 for every day of ownership. Such is the nature of primo LA real estate sector these days.\n\nIt's not Williams' only off-loading of personal property recently, either. Just a few short months ago, the 'Rock DJ' singer listed his English country manor in Compton Bassett for $12.7 million, which was recently sold too.\n\nAs for Drake (real name Aubrey Drake Graham), the Grammy award winner is no novice when it comes to the ultra top-end of North American real estate.\n\nIn 2020, the 35-year-old moved into an unbelievably large mansion in his hometown of Toronto, Canada.\n\nWorth an estimated $137 million, the rapper's 4645-square-metre abode is unbelievably lavish and has every luxury imaginable, including a full-size custom basketball court.\n\nAnd now he's secured another mega-mansion south of the Canadian border, down California way."
