        "text": "On middle-aged pop stars: \"As a 29-year-old, the only thing that I can possibly think is that if I'm still performing at 50, it's because I'll have had disastrous marriages and I have to pay for them.\"\n\nOn music snobs: \"There is a lot of snobbery towards pop music, to me and pop in general – it's kind of a despised art form.\"\n\nOn being a weirdo: \"I'm quite open to the fact that I might be a tinfoil-hat freak.\"\n\nOn his younger self: \"What was I like? I had a high-pitched voice. Sounded a bit like a girl. Spoke with a Stoke accent, tremendously naive. Overconfident. Tremendously overconfident. And underconfident at the same time – really, really bad combination! Gets you places, though.\"\n\nOn aging gracefully: \"I’m on good form. I’m an older guy. I feel healthy, I’ve been training, I’m looking after myself, I get up early. I look after the dogs. I’m happy.\"\n\nOn maturity: \"I've deliberately tried to calm myself down because eventually I want to be a good role model to my kids.\"\n\nOn discipline: \"[Music video director] Kim Gavin thought I was a pain in the arse. And for the job that he had to do at the time, that’s understandable. Because I didn’t apply myself. But I have a tremendous relationship with Kim now. And I’m applying myself.\"\n\nOn stardom: \"It's success, not fame, that is quite addictive. I'm addicted to a lot of things and, as it happens, success is one of them.\"\n\nOn public displays of affection: \"It would be great to see somebody like Kid Rock kissing a man. But I'm sure that he wouldn't like the prospect of it put to him, and I won't even go there with Eminem.\"\n\nOn his dark side: \"I am not as bad as people would suggest. Not as good as I would like to be.\"\n\nOn growing up: \"People change. I wouldn't like to be accountable for the interviews I've done, or the person I was when I was 20, 21.\"\n\nOn Gary Barlow: \"Even though I disliked Gaz or the regime we were under, I didn't want him to hurt. I did want to win, but I didn't want him to have the fall from Grace that he did.\"\n\nOn his ego: \"I have a gigantic ego and need to be at the top of the pile and be doing amazingly well; also, at the same time, I'm just pleased to be anywhere.\"\n\nOn feeling no love for Courtney: \"I met Courtney Love and she said she'd like to sleep with me, but she couldn't cos of my \"pop-star thing\"... so I said to her I couldn't sleep with her either - cos of her 'ugly thing'...\"\n\nOn dating: \"I miss having someone to cuddle up and have an early night with. But I'm looking. Meanwhile, I'm having a few relationships that don't mean much.\"\n\nOn American politics: \"I'd make a better U.S. president than George W. Bush. Bush is an idiot. I'm a better public speaker than him. It makes you wonder about the voters.\"\n\nOn the afterlife: \"I think there are ghosts. I haven't seen or heard anything. I've definitely felt something, but it's not scary.\"\n\nOn illegal substances: \"Some of the best times in my life happened under the influence of drugs... I'd still be doing it if I could make good judgement calls. I'd still be doing it if I didn't blow up to the size of an aircraft hangar, because it was a great time.\"\n\nOn rehab: \"When people come out of rehab, they usually go to secondary rehab for another six months and then enter back into society gradually. But I came out and did Top Of The Pops straight away!\"\n\nOn regrets: \"There's no point regretting things. If you can't do the time, don't do the crime. Life's too short to worry about things I've said.\"\n\nOn envy: \"Look at Paul McCartney, look at Elton John. They're jealous of Justin Timberlake. I'm sure they were jealous of me when I was in my imperial phase.\"\n\nOn reality TV: \"I love reality TV. It's the only stuff I watch. But yeah, if this CD fails and Take That doesn't do too well, Strictly Come Dancing then straight to panto.\"\n\nOn returning to Glastonbury as a solo artist: \"Last time I came here I got the sack - thank f---for that.\"\n\nOn his wild years: \"I picked up a TV set in my hotel room and walked right out of the building. My room was on the ground floor and I actually threw it back through the window, on to my bed.\"\n\nOn being a household name: \"I've got this brilliant thing where I go, 'I'm Robbie Williams', and people are interested in what I want to say - which is amazing because I'm just an idiot from Stoke-on-Trent.\"\n\nOn talent: \"I can do anything I want to do really, I might as well.\"\n\nIntroducing himself at a gig: \"Good evening everybody, my name is Robbie Williams, this is my band and for the next two hours YOUR ASS IS MINE!\"\n\nOn the room in which he uses the internet: \"I should not call it my office. I should call it my adulation top-up room!\"\n\nOn his man-crush: \"We'd probably have sex. That's what this is all about isn't it? I want him to be grateful for it. Let's get it out in the open. I want to shag Liam Gallagher.\"\n\nOn companionship: \"I think you're very lucky to find somebody you can coexist with without straying or going mad or being angry. That's whether you're Liam Gallagher and Nicole Appleton, Robbie Williams and Ayda Field, or Tim and June from down the road.\"\n\nThe last sentence of his CV, before his Take That days: \"I have only one ambition, which is to be famous.\""
