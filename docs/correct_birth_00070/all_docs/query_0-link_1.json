        "text": "Fans of pop icon Robbie Williams will be aware of the star's early life growing up in Burslem in Stoke-on-Trent. What some may not be aware of is the Robbie tourist trail which die-hard fans can follow to visit sites of significance to the entertainer.\n\nSeveral locations across Burslem and wider Stoke-on-Trent have been marked as spots where Robbie pilgrims can go to pay their respects to their idol. They include the Burslem pub where he grew up, as well as the pop star's old school and houses he lived in.\n\nThe tourist trail was officially opened in 2014 by the then-Lord Mayor of Stoke-on-Trent, Sheila Pitt. It was opened alongside Robbie's mother and marks out important locations for Robbie across the \"six towns\" of the Potteries.\n\nREAD MORE: How to watch World's Strongest Man 2022 as UK's Tom Stoltman competes to defend title\n\nThey all played a part in shaping Robbie's life and career. At the age of just 16, he left the area to become the youngest member of boyband Take That.\n\nRobbie's solo career, launched in 1997, also brought great success, including a string of number-one singles and albums. It comes as he prepares for a massive homecoming gig at Vale Park - the home of the club he loves, Port Vale - on Saturday, June 4.\n\nHere are some of the locations where Robbie spent time while growing up in Stoke-on-Trent. They are all included on the tourist trail.\n\nNewfield Street, Tunstall\n\nThis spot is the home of Robbie’s grandparents. The star spent a lot of time there growing up. In 2002, Robbie wrote Nan's Song in memory of his grandmother.\n\nVictoria Park Road, Tunstall\n\nThis was the first place Robbie lived, inhabiting the street from 1974 to 1975. He would have been around one-to-two years old at this time.\n\nVictoria Park, Tunstall\n\nA popular spot in Tunstall for anyone looking for a quiet day out. As a boy, Robbie honed his football skills at the park.\n\nMill Hill Primary School, Sunnyside Avenue, Tunstall\n\nThis was where Robbie went to primary school. He was at Mill Hill from 1978 to 1985, meaning that he started there from nursery aged around four all the way to leaving for high school at ten.\n\nSt. Margaret Ward Catholic College, Little Chell Lane, Tunstall\n\nWhen he was eleven years old Robbie started secondary school at St Margaret Ward Catholic College. He continued on here until leaving in 1990 aged 16 when he joined Take That. While at school Robbie performed in some of the school's shows. His biggest role was the Artful Dodger in a production of Oliver!\n\nGreenbank Road, Tunstall\n\nThis was the location where Robbie was living when he joined Take That in 1990. His mother had read an advert for a boyband seeking new members, and suggested that he try out for the group. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nScotia Road, Tunstall\n\nWhile not a place Robbie lived, it is mentioned in one of his songs, 'The 80s' on album Rudebox. The lyrics say: \"When I ran, I ran so far away down Scotia Road to a taxi bay, then I ran again 'cos I couldn't pay\".\n\nThe Queen’s Theatre, Wedgwood Place, Burslem\n\nWhile at school Robbie was also a member of North Staffs Amateur Dramatic Society. While aged 14 he appeared as The Artful Dodger in Oliver. in 1988 when he was 14 years old, just two years before joining Take That.\n\nVale Park, Hamil Road, Burslem\n\nThe home of Robbie's beloved football club Port Vale. After making his millions as a pop star Robbie ended up purchasing a large stake in the club, reportedly costing him £240,000. At the time he was the largest stakeholder. Sadly when the club went into administration the singer lost his investment.\n\nThe Red Lion pub, Moorland Road, Burslem\n\nRobbie's home from 1975 to 1978. His father was the landlord of the famous Port Vale-aligned pub. The premises recently reopened under new management. The new owners made the controversial decision to remove a mural of Robbie themed around his his 'Angels' from the front of the pub. Nonetheless, a plaque dedicated to the star is still in place at the front of the pub.\n\nThe Angel, Burslem\n\nAnother source of inspiration for Robbie. This pub is rumoured to have been the inspiration behind what many consider to be Robbie's greatest hit 'Angels', which was released in 1997.\n\nNEWSLETTER: Sign up for email alerts from StokeonTrentLive direct to your inbox"
