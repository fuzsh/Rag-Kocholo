        "text": "Robert Peter Williams, popularly known as Robbie Williams, is a BRIT award-winning singer, dancer, and songwriter. He garnered widespread publicity as one of the members of the pop boy band ‘Take That.’ He is one of the best-selling music artists whose albums have sold 75 million copies worldwide as of 2020. As a solo artist, he has 18 ‘BRIT Awards’ to his credit, a record that remains unbroken till date. He was voted the ‘Greatest Artist of the 1990s’ and has also been inducted into the ‘UK Music Hall of Fame.’ He is the only bestselling non-Latino artist in Latin America. He appears frequently in the British media for his heavy party-style life, sex appeal, and romantic affairs with women. Although he has frequently caught the attention of the media for wrong reasons, he has also won the hearts of many with his active participation in humanitarian efforts. He runs a charity organization called ‘Give It Sum,’ which aims at helping the under-privileged people in his hometown of Stoke-on-Trent. He is a patron of ‘Donna Louise Trust’ and an ambassador of UNICEF. A man with many interests, Robbie holds a great fascination for the UFOs and their mystical phenomena."
