        "text": "The famous singer Robbie Williams began his path to success by participating in the musical group Take That. Robbie Williams is currently a solo singer, lyricist and darling of women.\n\nHis amazing voice is combined with excellent external data. This is one of the most popular and best-selling British pop artists.\n\nHow was the childhood and youth of the singer Robbie Williams?\n\nRobbie Williams was born in a provincial town in the UK. His childhood, however, like his youth, could not be called happy. When the boy was barely three years old, his father abandoned their family. Robbie and his adoptive sister were raised by their mother.\n\nFrom an early age, he showed his rebellious character. Studied badly. At school, he earned the title of clown and jester. Often, in order to stand out from the background of students, he came into conflict with teachers, demonstrated various tricks at recess, and was a typical bully.\n\nThe studies did not go on, which greatly upset his mother, who already had a hard time. The only thing the guy was probably good at was performing at school concerts and performances. Artistic talent has become the only positive feature of Robbie, according to teachers.\n\nHe adored listening to music, imagining himself on the big stage. Robbie wanted to get out of poverty with all his heart, so attempts to break into show business began in his early years.\n\nMusical career of Robbie Williams\n\nTake That, a popular British band at the time, was looking for a fifth member. Robbie Williams decided to try his luck, so when the producer of the musical group held an audition, the guy also signed up for it.\n\nRobbie decided that the song \"Nothing Can Divide Us\" would bring him good luck. And so it happened. After listening, the producer of the musical group invited the young guy to become part of his project.\n\nFor 5 years he was a member of the Take That group. 5 guys who were part of the team were distinguished by attractive external data.\n\nTheir listeners were young girls. They were engaged in the fact that they recorded and performed cover songs, that is, they “re-sang” famous hits. And only in 1991 the band released their first album, which was called \"Take That and Party\".\n\nThe record brought popularity to the musical group. For a long time the tracks of the debut album remained at the peak of popularity.\n\nTake That became the most popular band in the UK. A couple of years pass and the guys are recording the second album, which was called \"Everything Change\".\n\nThe tracks of the second album are also popular not only in the UK, but also abroad. After the release of the second disc, the guys go on their first large-scale tour.\n\nWe would like to draw your attention to the fact that, unlike many British bands, the guys performed their compositions live.\n\nRobbie Williams: thoughts on solo career\n\nConcerts and the long-awaited popularity turned the heads of young performers. Each of the participants in the musical project began to think about a solo career. Robbie Williams is the first member who decides to leave the band and pursue a solo career. But he will fail.\n\nThe fact is that according to the contract that he signed with the producer of the group, for another 5 years Robbie does not have the right to perform and record tracks. Williams becomes depressed. Increasingly, they begin to see him under the influence of alcohol and drugs.\n\nHe was able to overcome alcohol addiction. At that time, he was involved in litigation with a former producer.\n\nWhen the trial is over and justice has been done, Robbie records a cover of George Michael's song. Music fans approve of the track and Robbie's idiosyncratic approach, and embrace his solo activities.\n\nAfter the release of the cover song, Williams recorded his debut album. But, much to his surprise, the audience takes him coldly. This does not stop the singer.\n\nThe album is followed by the track \"Angels\", which literally melted and won the hearts of the listeners.\n\n\"Angels\" has become the biggest hit of the last 25 years. This track remained a hit on the UK charts for a long time.\n\nWithout thinking twice, the singer decides to release another single - \"Millennium\", which brings him several awards at once - \"Best Visual Technologies in a Video Clip\", \"Best Song of the Year\" and \"Best Single\".\n\nAfter the release of the presented tracks, his work conquered all of Europe. However, Robbie Williams does not want to stop there.\n\nRobbie Williams and Capitol Records\n\nIn 1999, he signed a contract with the well-known company Capitol Records. He is working on the creation of an album, which, in his opinion, should increase the number of fans in the United States of America.\n\nThe track \"The Ego Has Lended\", which Robbie recorded at a new recording studio, takes 63rd place in the hit parade. This is a complete failure, disappointment and surprise. Some time later, he recorded the single \"Rock Dj\", which was approved by listeners and music critics. However, the song did not blow up modern show business, in view of the great competition.\n\nIn 2000, together with Minogue, they recorded a joint composition - \"Kids\", which literally blew up all the charts. It was Robbie who became the author of this track. Such an upsurge benefited the young performer and motivated him to record new albums.\n\nThe modern discography of the singer is updated, replenished with interesting and not very albums. Robbie is always warmly welcomed by the public. He has earned attention from the younger generation through participation in various social projects.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2017 he released 7 albums. With popular tracks, he traveled half of Europe. Including he is warmly received by fans of the CIS countries.\n\nAt the moment, there has been a lull in Robbie's work. It can be on various talk shows, including Russian ones. You can learn more about his life on social pages."
