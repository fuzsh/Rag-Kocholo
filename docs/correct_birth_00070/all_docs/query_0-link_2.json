        "text": "Robbie Biography\n\nRobbie Williams was born Robert Peter Williams in Stoke-on-Trent on 13th February, 1974.\n\nAt the age of three, his parents divorced and he resided with his mother and sister.\n\nHe went to high school and was renowned for being mischievous, so it wasn’t surprising when he didn’t pass any of his G.C.S.E’s.\n\nWith few options open to him, he got a job as a salesman but destiny had a lot more in mind; his mother had noticed an article in the newspaper for an audition for a boy band and considering Robbie’s talented voice and acting abilities, she decided to get him to audition and he stepped on the first step to stardom.\n\nHear Robbie's Mum talk about Rob\n\nOn February 6th 2004, Jan chatted with BBC Stoke presenter Stuart George for nearly an hour about Robbie, his troubles, his early life and Give It SumYou need Real Player to hear this. Click for BBC's RP download guide\n\nTake That\n\nHe joined Take That in 1990. For five straight years, the success of Take That was undisputed but, in 1995, Robbie decided that he wanted to quit - and interviews that followed this incident never really cleared up whether Robbie had been pushed out, or was quitting the band of his own free will.\n\nBut one thing was for sure; he had always felt that being in a band was constricting and prevented him from being his own person; he had stopped giving input and stopped doing as he was told (perhaps being young was not an advantage, after all!).\n\nThe rules set out for the band were too much for someone as extroverted as Robbie - which led to him resorting to alcohol and drugs; while ensuing legal battles with BMG, which was his record company, to allow him to go solo (apparently there was a clause that prevented him from becoming a solo singer if he ever left Take That) drained his energy.\n\nHear Robbie's Dad talking about Rob\n\nPete Conway chatted with BBC Stoke presenter Den Siegertsz about what Robbie is really likeYou need Real Player to hear this. Click for BBC's RP download guide\n\nGoing solo\n\nOn the 27th of June, 1996, Robbie announced that his contract with BMG was coming to an end and that he was now signed on with Chrysalis Records.\n\nHis first single was the cover version of ‘Freedom’ by George Michael; it hit No. 2, narrowly beaten by the ‘Wannabe’ by the Spice Girls.\n\nHe met Jacquie Hamilton-Smith at a New Year’s Party and soon moved in with her and he started leading a life of parties; the previous months had been very hard on him and after a whole year he returned to his senses.\n\nHe followed the advice of Sir Elton John and various other artists, and went to a rehab centre to recover from drug and alcohol addiction (Clouds House Drink and Drugs Rehabilitation Clinic, Salisbury).\n\nHear (just a little bit!) of sister Sally talking about Rob\n\nBBC Stoke's Jo Morris asked a number of people on the street in Stoke about Robbie's marriage prospects. By coincidence she bumped into Rob's older sister Sally!You need Real Player to hear this. Click for BBC's RP download guide\n\nThe best in the business\n\nFrom this point his music career has gone uphill, receiving international fame and many No 1s. He has also taken many awards in the process.\n\nAnd you too can add to this page ...\n\nCan you add some other facts about Robbie?\n\nDo you know of relevant websites, local memorials, or accounts about him that would be useful to know?\n\nHave you ever met him?...\n\nIf you can help or have comments - e-mail us!\n\nDid you know?"
