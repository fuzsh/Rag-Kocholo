        "text": "1991: Early days in the band\n\nTake That's original line-up of Gary Barlow, Howard Donald, Mark Owen, Jason Orange and Robbie Williams. Thankfully they changed their name and after a few unsuccessful songs in the early 90s Take That's breakthrough hit 'It Only Takes A Minute' was released. The song was a cover of a 1975 song by Taveres and reached Number 7 in the charts.\n\n1992: Take That in their prime\n\nIn 1992 Take That had hits with 'A Million Love Songs' and 'Could It Be Magic'. The boys' follow-up single 'Could It Be Magic' quickly propelled them to super-stardom with a string of number 1s not far away. Take That's success continued in 1993 with 'Pray', 'Relight My Fire' (featuring Lulu) and 'Babe'.\n\n1995: Robbie left Take That\n\nHowever, in July 1995 after countless hits, fans heard the devastating news; Robbie Williams would be leaving the band following friction with other band members. Robbie later admitted in a TV documentary in 2005, that he did some \"stupid stuff\" after parting ways with the band over 20 years ago, but said he didn't regret it because he was young.\n\nIn 1997, Robbie released his first album 'Life Thru a Lens'. The album included the single, 'Angels' which is still his best-selling single of all time.\n\n2000: 'Rock DJ' and BRIT Award win\n\nAt the start of the millennium Robbie released his third solo album, 'Sing When You're Winning'. The album included the single 'Rock DJ' which had quite a controversial music video. The video involved Robbie trying to impress a group of women by stripping down but, when the clothes didn't work he starts removing his skin and muscle until he's just a dancing skeleton. Many TV networks edited the video because of this.\n\nHowever, the single was still a great success with it being the UK's fourth-best selling single of 2000. The song also went on to win best British single and best music video of the year at the BRIT Awards as well as best special effects at the VMAs.\n\n2001: Swing album\n\nHaving grown up loving the music of Frank Sinatra, Robbie went in a new musical direction in 2001 when he released the album 'Swing When You're Winning'. With the title being a pun on his previous album, Robbie called 'Swing While You're Winning' \"the big band album he had always dreamed of making\".\n\nThe album includes guest performances from Rupert Everett, Nicole Kidman, Jon Lovitz and Jane Horrocks as well as Frank Sinatra posthumously duetting with Robbie. Despite not being his usual style, the album was still a success and made it to Number 1 on the UK albums chart.\n\n2002: EMI deal\n\nIn 2002 Robbie signed a whopping £80 million deal with EMI which was the biggest music deal for a British artist. The record was only broken in 2016 by Adele. The deal included a promise from EMI that they'd help him break into the United States. While his next album, 'Escapology', did perform better internationally than his previous albums, it still didn't perform as well as he'd hoped in the US.\n\n2006: The 'Close Encounters' Tour\n\nIn 2006, Robbie embarked on his 'Close Encounters' Tour where he performed over 50 shows across the globe. The tour got him into the Guinness Book of World Records after he sold a whopping 1.6 million tickets in a single day!\n\n2009: 'Reality Killed The Video Star'\n\nIn 2009 Robbie was back with his eighth studio album, 'Reality Killed the Video Star'. The album included the singles 'Bodies', 'You Know Me' and 'Morning Sun'. While the album still managed to sell over a million copies in Europe, it wasn't enough to land the top spot on the UK album charts, coming second place to JLS' debut album.\n\n2010: Take That reunion\n\nRobbie Williams made an unexpected return to the Take That in 2010, joining forces with Gary Barlow - the first time since 1995 - with the song 'Eight Letters' appearing on later albums by both Take That and Robbie - 'Progress' and 'Take the Crown'.\n\nThen, later that year, the news that all Take That fans had been waiting for was confirmed, the original line-up would be reforming for the wildly successful album, 'Progress' and its live tour. Their lead single 'The Flood' was released and peaked at Number 2 featuring both Gary and Robbie as lead vocals.\n\n2012: Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee\n\nIn 2012 Robbie took part in the celebration of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee, celebrating her 60 years on the throne. Robbie was the opening act of a concert held in the gardens of Buckingham Palace to commemorate the anniversary.\n\n2013: 'Swings Both Ways'\n\nRobbie returned to the world of swing with his second album in the genre, 'Swings Both Ways'. The album included some original songs written by Robbie, Guy Chambers, and Chris Heath, as well as some covers of some classics including The Jungle Book's 'I Wan'na Be Like You' and The Wizard of Oz's 'If I Only Had a Brain'. The album includes duets with Olly Murs, Michel Bublé, and Kelly Clarkson.\n\n2018: FIFA opening ceremony performance\n\nIn the summer of 2018, Robbie performed at the opening ceremony of the FIFA World Cup that took place in Moscow, Russia. During the performance he sang some of his greatest hits that included 'Let Me Entertain You', and 'Angels'.\n\n2018: The X Factor judging panel\n\nLater on in 2018, it was announced that Robbie would be joining the judging panel of the 15th series of the X Factor on ITV. Robbie was one of three new judges on the panel joining Simon Cowell, the other two were his wife, Ayda Field, and former One Direction member Louis Tomlinson.\n\n2019: The Boy In The Dress\n\nIn 2019 Robbie co-wrote the music for the musical adaption of David Walliams' The Boy in the Dress along with Guy Chambers. The musical was produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company and premiered in Stratford-Upon-Avon in late 2019. The show was due to transfer to the Savoy Theatre in London's West End in Autumn 2020, but the Coronavirus pandemic has put those plans on halt.\n\n2019: 'The Christmas Present'\n\nRobbie released his first ever Christmas album in November 2019 called 'The Christmas Present'. The album had some original songs along with some festive classics such as 'Winter Wonderland' and 'The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire)'. The album features guest performers including Helene Fischer, Rod Stewart, and Tyson Fury.\n\nThe album made it to Number 1 in the UK charts during its second week and knocked Robbie up to joint-second place with Elvis Presley for number of number one albums in the UK.\n\n2023: The voice of Felix\n\nRobbie joined forces with cat food company Purina to release a brand new song 'It's Great To Be a Cat' in January 2023. He said: \"The cat is out of the bag, I'm the new voice of Felix. I've been a long-time fan of cats, I've had many feline friends over the years and after studying their fascinating behaviour, I can confidently say, It's Great To Be a Cat.\""
