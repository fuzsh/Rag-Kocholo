        "text": "Robbie Williams has offered his strongest hint yet that he is ready to leave Los Angeles and move back home to the UK.\n\nThe 46-year-old pop star has been living the Hollywood life since 2006 and currently resides in a lavish Beverley Hills mansion with wife Ayda Field and their four children.\n\nBut Robbie has hinted it's because of his family that he's considering moving somewhere more low key.\n\nThe former Take That star, who is originally from Stoke-on-Trent, said he is worried about his brood turning into brats by growing up in La La Land.\n\n\"There's these kids [in LA] with entitlement because of the place where they were born... I don't want my kids near any of those kids,\" Robbie told OK! Magazine.\n\nThe father-of-four said he initially preferred living in the States with his family as his lesser fame there allowed him to be 'dad' instead of 'Robbie Williams being a dad' but things could be about to change.\n\nEx X Factor judges Robbie and Ayda, 41, have their hands full with Teddy, seven, Charlton, five, Coco, two and seven month old Beau.\n\nDespite his estimated £200million wealth, family man Robbie insists he hasn't lost his humble roots.\n\nThe star said it took him 12 years to find the 'courage' to buy a Rolls Royce and he still shares bath water with wife Ayda to save the pennies. He also revealed he 'polices' Ayda's penchant for buying expensive 'posh' scented candles for their home.\n\n\"I lit the candle then went to the bathroom to pee,\" said Ayda. \"By the time I'd come back he'd blown the candle and went 'You're just burning money. You're not even in the room!' I'd say that's the difference between Beverley Hill and Stoke-on-Trent,\" she teased.\n\nRobbie has spent most of his time in Los Angeles, where he married Ayda, since 2006.\n\nHe did move back to the UK in 2009 where he bought an £8.5million mansion in Compton Bassett, Wiltshire, but sold the home just a year later and moved back to America permanently."
