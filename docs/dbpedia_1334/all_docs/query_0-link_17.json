        "text": "BIOGRAPHIES OF NAMIBIAN PERSONALITIES\n\nin alphabetical order\n\nKLAUS DIERKS\n\nCopyright © 2003-2004 Dr. Klaus Dierks\n\nA - H\n\n000419\n\nAaron\n\n*\n\n---\n\nAaron was a \"white\" trader who in 1854 had obtained a mining concession in the Swakop/Kuiseb area from the Captain of the Orlam Afrikaners, Jonker Afrikaner. Possibly he was identical with Aaron de Pass. Aaron de Pass had commenced fishing operations at Walvis Bay in 1852, while Barry Munnik from Cape Town had established himself in this industry in early 1859, and William Latham was fishing there in the late 1860s. The fish was generally dried and then exported to Mauritius. Owing to the inadequate infrastructure, there was too much sand in the dried fish. As a result the prices received for the final fish product were so low that the venture did not prove economically feasible. Small-scale fishing operations and whaling did, however, continue.\n\n---\n\nGender: m\n\nField of activity: TRA\n\nProfession: Trader\n\nRAW DATA: Esterhuyse 1968:10; Tabler 1973:1; Wilken et al, 1978:56-56; Berichte, 1853:283; Chronology of Namibian History, 2003 (Dierks);\n\n000124\n\nAbraham\n\n*\n\n---\n\nAbraham was one of the Witbooi Nama who left Gibeon with Hendrik Witbooi in 1884.\n\n---\n\nGender: m\n\nNamibia National Archives Database\n\n000354\n\nAbrahams, Kenneth Godfrey, Dr.\n\n* 25.10.1936 in the Cape Province, South Africa\n\n---\n\nKenneth Godfrey Abrahams was born on 25.10.1936 in the Cape Province in South Africa. He obtained a M.B.Ch.B. degree from the University of Cape Town, a D.V.D.T.M. & H. degree from Liverpool University in the United Kingdom and a M.D. from the University of Stockholm in Sweden. He joined the Ovamboland People's Congress (OPC) in 1957 and SWAPO in 1960. While he studied at the University of Cape Town, he belonged to the secret Maoist Yo Chi Chan movement as well as the National Unity Movement (NUM) which rivalled the African National Congress (ANC) in strength among Cape Coloureds in the Western Cape. He was the editor of the \"SWA Observer and Commentator\" in Cape Town in 1960/61. In 1962 he moved to Rehoboth with his wife (Ottilié, married in 1961) to open a medical practice there and was granted citizenship of the \"Baster Gebied\". In 1963 the Yo Chi Chan's planned guerrilla activities in South Africa were discovered and the Abrahams tipped off about their imminent arrest by the South African authorities in Rehoboth. When security police arrived to arrest the couple, elders in the \"Baster Gebied\" (i.a. Hermanus Christoffel Beukes) threatened bloodshed which led to the retreat of the police. Soon afterwards the SA authorities gave him indemnity to stay. However, Abrahams decided to go into exile to Botswana together with Andreas Shipanga who was at this stage a National Organiser for SWAPO and the Baster Paul Smit. They were escorted to Ghanzi in Botswana and received residence permits. On the way to Lobatse, still in Botswana, they, together with Hermanus Beukes, an elder on the Baster Council and petitioner at the United Nations, were kidnapped by three South African policemen in an unmarked truck and brought to Gobabis. There they were jailed and charged to have left Namibia illegally. Abrahams' father-in-law, Otto Ferdinand Schimming, discovered that he was jailed at Gobabis and the situation received world-wide publicity. Abrahams was flown into Cape Town and charged with sabotage while the South African Police claimed they had arrested him near Gobabis in Namibia. The British High Commission in Botswana and the British Embassy in South Africa launched an investigation and instituted Habeas Corpus proceedings at the South African Supreme Court which eventually led to his release back to Botswana. From there the Abrahams left for Dar-Es-Salaam in Tanzania. Both were appointed to the SWAPO Central Committee. The Abrahams couple was expelled from SWAPO in 1964, allegedly on the initiative of Emil Appolus. The couple settled then in Lusaka in Zambia, where Abrahams practised as a medical doctor. Political pressure eventually led to the couple being declared prohibited immigrants. 1968, Abrahams evaded the Zambian Police and fled again to Tanzania while his wife was arrested and imprisoned with their youngest child. Accompanied by much public furore over the popular \"doctor freedom fighter\", Ottilié was released and rejoined her husband in Sweden where they lived until 1978. On 10.06.1978 Abrahams was, together with Andreas Shipanga, a founding member of a new political party, the SWAPO-Democrats (SWAPO-D). He returned to Namibia in 1978 as a SWAPO-D office bearer. He also was a member of the Namibia National Front (NNF, formed in 1977) until 1980 when he joined the Namibia Independence Party (NIP). Since then he was active in community issues and grassroot development projects and a number of committees including the Namibia Nationhood Co-ordinating Committee. He was also a member of the Namibian Educational Forum (NEF). Abrahams edited the \"Namibian Review\". Since 1989, he was the NNF Information Secretary.

Her parents were Otto Ferdinand Schimming and Charlotte Schimming, née Freiser. She received her education at the Primary School in Windhoek and the Secondary School at the Zonnebloem College in Cape Town, South Africa. She matriculated at the Trafalgar High School in Cape Town in 1954. She obtained a BA degree and a Higher Primary Teacher's Certificate from the University of Cape Town (UCT) in 1961. She joined the SWA Student Body as a founding member in 1952, which was reconstituted 1955 as the SWA Progressive Association (SWAPA) to campaign for improved \"black\" education facilities. Its newspaper, the South West News, was banned for its nationalist content in 1960. 1957 she became a Member of the Cape Peninsula Student's Union. She joined the Ovamboland People's Congress (OPC) in 1957 and SWAPO 1960. In 1961 Ottilié Schimming married Kenneth Godfrey Abrahams. While the couple studied at the University of Cape Town, they belonged to the secret Maoist Yo Chi Chan movement as well as the National Unity Movement (NUM) which rivalled the African National Congress (ANC) in strength among Cape Coloureds in the Western Cape. After her completion of her studies at the UCT, she taught at the Trafalgar High School and Alexander Sinton High School at Cape Town. In 1962 the couple moved to Rehoboth where Kenneth opened a medical practice. In 1963 the Yo Chi Chan's planned guerrilla activities in South Africa were discovered and the Abrahams tipped off about their imminent arrest by the South African authorities in Rehoboth. When security police arrived to arrest the couple, elders in the \"Baster Gebied\" (i.a. Hermanus Christoffel Beukes) threatened bloodshed which led to the retreat of the police. Soon afterwards the SA authorities gave them indemnity to stay. However, Kenneth Abrahams decided to go into exile to Botswana together with Andreas Shipanga who was at this stage a National Organiser for SWAPO and the Baster Paul Smit. They were escorted to Ghanzi in Botswana and received residence permits. On the way to Lobatse, still in Botswana, they, together with Hermanus Beukes, an elder on the Baster Council and petitioner at the United Nations, were kidnapped by three South African policemen in an unmarked truck and brought to Gobabis.

There the Abraham couple was re-united and both went into exile 1963 to Tanzania. Both were appointed to the SWAPO Central Committee. The Abrahams couple was expelled from SWAPO in 1964, allegedly on the initiative of Emil Appolus. The couple settled then in Lusaka in Zambia, where Abrahams practised as a medical doctor and Ottilié taught at the Chizongwe Secondary School and Lusaka Girls' School.

Accompanied by much public furore over the popular \"doctor freedom fighter\", Ottilié was released and rejoined her husband in Sweden where they lived until 1978. While in Sweden, Ottilié continued her university studies. She obtained a MA degree from Stockholm University in 1974. However, she didn't complete her Ph.-D. thesis at Stockholm University (1974-1978). On 10.06.1978 she was, together with Kenneth Abrahams and Andreas Shipanga, a founding member of a new political party, the SWAPO-Democrats (SWAPO-D). She returned to Namibia in 1978 as a SWAPO-D office bearer. She also was a member of the Namibia National Front (NNF, formed in 1977) until 1980 when she joined the Namibia Independence Party (NIP) where she became the Secretary-General and Secretary for Information and Publicity. Since then she was active in community issues and grassroot development projects and a number of committees: She became the Chairlady of the People's Action Committee (anti-conscription in the South African Army) in 1981, in 1984 she was active in the Action Manpower Bureaus and in the Action General Sales Tax. In 1985 she was involved in the Action Site and Service. In the same year she became the Director of the Jakob Marengo Tutorial College in Khomasdal. She was also active in the Namibia Nationhood Co-ordinating Committee and a member of the Namibian Educational Forum (NEF). Ottilié Abrahams also edited the \"Namibian Review\". She was the Chairlady of the Khomasdal Civic Association (KCA). In 1989 she was elected as NNF Secretary-General.

Adrian worked later as a clerk (Zahlmeister) with the Lüderitz railway, then in a managerial position with the Pomona-Diamantengesellschaft, later with CDM until 1940.

Ben Africa was only in 1977 elected as fourth Baster Captain (until 1979). Ben Africa was born on 13.10.1938 at Rehoboth. He matriculated at the Athlone High School in Cape Town in South Africa in 1957. He graduated from the University of Cape Town Medical School in 1964 with a bursary of the SWA Administration. As a student in Cape Town he steered away from active politics but narrowly missed expulsion from medical school after openly speaking out about discrimination on campus: \"black\" students could not attend post mortems on \"whites\", but \"white\" students could dissect \"black\" corpses. He was appointed as first Resident District Surgeon of Rehoboth in 1966. In 1971, however, the Rehoboth Baster Association (RBA) was constituted by Ben Africa, John McNab and Piet Junius. The new party was founded mainly as a result of the refusal of the then ruling Rehoboth Volksparty (Rehoboth People's Party) to negotiate with the SWA Administration to relieve the problems caused by a major gastro-enteritis epidemic in the \"Baster Gebied\". Ben Africa represented the Baster in the Turnhalle Constitutional Conference (01.09.1975). The RBA joined the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) in November 1977. On 03.10.1977 an election was held for a Kaptein (Captain) for Rehoboth in terms of the Rehoboth Self-Government Act, No. 56 of 1976. The election was narrowly won by Ben Africa, leader of the Baster delegation at the Turnhalle Conference and of the Baster Vereniging. His opponent was Johannes (Hans) Gerard Adolf Diergaardt of the Rehoboth Liberation Party. Diergaardt challenged the outcome of the election in court, and the court consequently ruled that Africa could not be installed as Kaptein of the Rehoboth Gebied. On 31.10.1977 elections for the Rehoboth Volksraad were held and won by Diergaardt. Consequently he became the fifth and last Baster Captain in 1979. On 03.07.1978 Ben Africa became Vice-President of the DTA. He also was the Chairman of the Turnhalle Credentials Committee and the Committee on Discriminatory Practices affecting labour conditions and salaries. He was a Member of the first \"Interim's\" National Assembly in 1979 and a Member of the first \"Interim's\" Ministers' Council from 1980 to 1983. In November 1986 the Progressive Peoples Party (PPP) was formed after the RBA split. The RBA was renamed the Rehoboth Democratic Turnhalle Alliance Party (RDTAP) and was led by Ben Africa.\n\n---\n\nGender: m\n\nField of activity: POL\n\nMarried: <1>Marjory Judith: two children\n\n<2>Ida Kroukamp: one son\n\nRAW DATA: Namibia Handbook and Political Who's Who, 1990 (Pütz, Von Egidy and Caplan); Chronology of Namibian History, 2003 (Dierks);\n\n000481\n\nAfrika, Jonathan\n\n*\n\n+ .188?\n\n---\n\nJonathan Afrika was a courageous Bechuana and excellent marksman initially in the employ of the trader Thomas Morris, but joined Charles John Andersson's service in 1853, when he guided Andersson and Galton when they attempted to open up the route between Walvis Bay and Ngamiland. In 1875, he was hunting in the Pandamatenga area for George Westbeech. He was forbidden to hunt in the Mangwato area by Bechuana Chief Khama because of his poaching. In June 1884, he was at the Zambezi, recovering after having been mauled by a wounded lioness.

He was the fifth in the genealogy of the Orlam Afrikaners. On 04.06.1863 he wrote to Charles John Andersson: \"Furthermore, I must say that you wish to steal the land, even though you know that it has always belonged to us. Because you did not not know how to get the land, you decided the following: 'Let me instigate and support the Herero against the people'. So that they shall kill me and all my people. In this way you would get the land. That is why you have strengthened these people with guns and powder.\" Consequently Christian was killed a little bit later, on 15.06.1863, in an attack on Maharero's settlement at Otjimbingwe by \"Andersson's private army\". This marked the erosion of Orlam Afrikaner power.

Jager was baptised in 1815 (named Christian) three months after destroying Warmbad, and stopped cattle raiding commandos until his death in 1923. He was one of the founders of Namibia's first systematic settlement in an engineering sense, ||Khauxa!nas or Schans Vlakte which was discovered by Klaus Dierks in 1987.

He was born around 1820. He succeeded his brother Christian as Chief of the Orlam Afrikaners (|Aixa|aen)in 1863. His Nama name is variously given as |Haramumab or |Hoa-|arab. He was the sixth and last in the genealogy of the Orlam Afrikaners. He married Mietje Hendrik in Bethany in December 1842. After considerable internal conflict, he succeeded his older brother Christian as Captain after the latter's death in June 1863. Under him, the Afrikaners lost their position of political dominance in central Namibia. In December 1867 he had to flee to Walvis Bay, after he unsuccessfully tried to again attack Otjimbingwe. Some days later (22.12.1867) a commando from Otjimbingwe surprised Jan Jonker in Anawood and defeated him crushingly. In May 1870 Jan Jonker Afrikaner tried to persuade Maharero to form an \"anti-European alliance\", but Maharero declined the peace offer under the influence of the Rhenish Missionary, Carl Hugo Hahn. In September 1870 Jan Jonker took part in the Peace Conference of Okahandja. In 1876 negotiations between William Coates Palgrave and Jan Jonker ended unsuccessfully. In 1878 Jan Jonker participated in a Conference of Hoachanas, which was boycotted by a majority of Namibian leaders. In January 1879, Jan Jonker sent a petition to the British authorities in the Cape Colony for protection of the Orlam Afrikaners which was declined by the British in January 1880. After the outbreak of a renewed Ovaherero-Nama War on 23.08.1880, Jan Jonker was defeated by Wilhelm Maharero in the Battle of Otjikango on 12.12.1880. For the first part of the 1880s, the Afrikaners under Jan Jonker and the Witboois under Moses were allies. In November 1881 Jan Jonker with his Witbooi allies was defeated by the Ovaherero in the Battle of Osona. Jan Jonker fled to the Gamsberg area. In February 1885 Jan Jonker concluded a private treaty with Adolf Lüderitz. In May 1885 he sold very large tracts of his territory to German colonial agents, and shortly afterwards (January 1886) signed a Protection Treaty with Germany. As from 1888 (perhaps September 1887) he was fighting actively against Hendrik Witbooi. He was finally defeated by Witbooi near Tsaobis in August 1889, and allegedly shot by his son Phanuel on 10.08.1889. For a critical discussion of the stories of his death, see Witbooi (1989:170). He was buried on Farm Jonkersgrab No. 7. The Orlam Afrikaners' polity ceased to exist.\n\n---\n\nGender: m\n\nField of activity: POL\n\nMarried to: Mietje Hendrik\n\nMother: Beetje Afrikaner\n\nFather: Jonker Afrikaner\n\nRAW DATA: Lau 1985:V1241; Chronology of Namibian History, 2003 (Dierks);\n\n000488\n\nAfrikaner, Jonas\n\n*\n\n+ 15.06.1863 at Otjimbingwe\n\n---\n\nJonas Afrikaner was one of Jonker Afrikaner's younger brothers who lived near Windhoek during the 1840s and 1850s.

His father was Jager Afrikaner (1760-1823). He followed him as Captain of the Orlam Afrikaners (|Aixa|aen) in 1823. He was the fourth in the genealogy of the Orlam Afrikaners. He left his father's settlement at Blydeverwacht (||Khauxa!nas - Schans Vlakte) in 1823 for central Namibia together with three brothers and some 300 followers, and established a large settlement at Windhoek around 1840 or before.\n\nIn 1825 he expressed the wish to have his own missionary. From then until his death, he and his Raad played a prominent role in Nama- and Damaraland, thereby creating a powerful, if rudimentary, state. In the 1830s he strengthened his power over the central and southern parts of Namibia. He established an alliance with the Kai||khaun. In 1836/37 he persuaded the British explorer James Edward Alexander to arrange for a missionary for him. In 1840 Jonker built a church for a congregation of between 500 and 600 in Klein-Windhoek. In 1842 the first two missionaries of the Rhenish Missionary Society (Carl Hugo Hahn and Franz Heinrich Kleinschmidt) arrived in Windhoek.\n\nIn the 1840s Jonker Afrikaner commenced his road building activities in central and southern Namibia (over the Auas Mountains to the south and the northern Bay Road from Windhoek to Walvis Bay). During this time he tried to subjugate the Ovaherero. The Ovaherero chiefs Tjamuaha (born ca. 1790) and Maharero (born 1820) were forced to settle in Windhoek. The Ovaherero chiefs Tjamuaha and Oove ua Muhoko Kahitjene formed an alliance with Jonker (Christmas Peace of 1842). In August 1843 he asked Rhenish Missionary Heinrich Kleinschmidt to write a letter to Abraham Christian from the !Gami-#nun (Bondelswarts), not to proceed with his plans to attack the Ovaherero, together with the Kai||khaun (Red Nation of Hoachanas). In 1844 ||Oaseb from the Kai||khaun attacked Ovaherero leader Kahitjene without Jonker lifting a finger to assist him. Kahitjene's defeat can be directly attributed to his attempt to have tried to win independent access to arms and horses, with assistance of Rhenish missionary Carl Hugo Hahn.\n\n1844 Jonker invited the Wesleyan missionaries Richard Haddy and Joseph Tindall to Windhoek, in order to replace the Rhenish missionaries (Carl Hugo Hahn and Heinrich Kleinschmidt) who interfered to much in Jonker's policies. In 1846 Jonker levelled serious accusations against missionary Hahn, whom he considered responsible for the outbreak of hostilities between the Nama and Ovaherero. Hahn, on the other side, accused the Wesleyan Missionary Society to tolerate Jonker's attacks against the Ovaherero. Hahn regarded Jonker and ||Oaseb as the centres of an Anti-European Missionary coalition. In 1849 the hostilities between Jonker and the Ovaherero and the Ovambanderu increased. In 1850 Jonker was pivotal in establishing the first copper mines in the Khomas Hochland (Aaron de Pass: Pomona Mining Company). In August 1850 Jonker attacked Okahandja and the Rhenish missionary station there. In 1852 Jonker continued his attacks on the Ovaherero (Tjamuaha and Maharero were attacked at Otjosemba). In 1854 Jonker moved to Okahandja in order to control the Ovaherero and the Rhenish missionaries. In the late 1850s conflicts between Jonker and other Namaland communities like ||Oaseb of the Kai||khaun and Willem Swartbooi (!Huiseb #Haobemab) increased. But the dividing lines between Jonker and other Nama communities were not clear cut and changed constantly. The Hoachanas Peace Accord of January 1858 again established an alliance between Jonker Afrikaner and ||Oaseb.The political constellation as it consolidated itself in the late 1850s can be described as follows: The chiefs ||Oaseb of the Kai||khaun, Amraal Lambert or #Gai|nub of the Kai|khauan, Piet Koper !Gamab of the Fransman Nama or !Khara-khoen, Hendrik Henricks or !Nanib gaib #Arisemab of the ||Hawoben and Jacobus Boois from Bethany supported Jonker Afrikaner, while Willem Swartbooi or !Huiseb #Haobemab from Rehoboth, the chiefs from Bethany (David Christian Frederiks) and Berseba and later Kido Witbooi or #A-||êib from Gibeon, assisted by Captain Tseib from Keetmanshoop, represented the anti-Jonker coalition. The Rhenish missionaries and European traders greatly added to these polarisations of different Namibian groups. The intent was to destroy Jonkers nascent state structures in order to weaken any local political power that might have resisted the missionaries objectives and later colonial annexation. Jonkers slogan: \"Africa to Africans, but Namaland and Hereroland to us\" was a challenge which was not acceptable to the missionaries.\n\nIn the early 1860s Jonker expanded his attacks into Ovamboland and the Kaokoveld in the north. The economic power increasingly slipped out of the hands of the Namibian leaders and passed into the hands of European traders and missionaries. A new form of European colonial domination was unofficially introduced by the missionary-trader alliance long before the colonial annexation took place. This development paved the way for the overthrow of Jonker Afrikaner's sovereignty in the 1860s. On 18.08.1861 Jonker Afrikaner died in Okahandja. He was married to Beetje Boois, sister or daughter of Jan Boois of Bethany. He was one of the most controversial figures of Namibian history, although his key role in the history of the central part of the country as a powerful ruler is uncontested.

He was the second in the genealogy of the Orlam Afrikaners (after \"Old Afrikaner or \"Oude Ram\" who died before 1760 in Cape Town). Although data are scanty, it is known that from 08.-15.12.1779 Klaas Afrikaner was at Warmbad, which may also contain a clue to the foundation of ||Khauxa!nas (Schans Vlakte). Klaas and the Boer Pienaar accompanied William Paterson and Robert Gordon on a journey to the Oranje River region in this year.In 1793, Klaas Afrikaner and his followers conducted a commando campaign against the \"Bastaard Hottentotten\", the descendants of Nama and slaves who had migrated northwards into Namibia. During the course of this campaign, which was undertaken on behalf of the South African Cape Government, the Orlam Afrikaners moved deep into Namibia. On their return to the Oranje River they were caught up in a skirmish with Guilliam Visagie, the first \"white\" settler in Namibia itself, who had established himself in #Nu#goaes (Swartmodder, later Keetmanshoop). It must have been at this time, between 1796 and the turn of the century, that Klaas Afrikaner and his followers established ||Khauxa!nas to the east of the Great Karas Mountains as a hidden retreat and \"impregnable fortification\" against possible attempts at pursuit by the Cape authorities, although the only primary historical source to support this is the Wesleyan Missionary Benjamin Ridsdale. Around the turn of the 18th century Klaas Afrikaner handed over the leadership over the Orlam Afrikaners to his son, Jager Afrikaner, also known as |Hom|aramab.\n\n---\n\nGender: m\n\nField of activity: POL\n\nRaw Data: Chronology of Namibian History, 2003 (Dierks);\n\n000492\n\nAfrikaner, Klaas\n\n[!Garuhamab - Nama name]\n\n*\n\n---\n\nKlaas Afrikaner was the son of Jager Afrikaner and nephew of Jonker Afrikaner.
