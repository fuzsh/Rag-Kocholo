But how does it compare to the other major international football properties, the UEFA Champions League and FIFA World Cup: ‚ö° The EURO 2020 final attracted 600m unique viewers, above the 450m of the Champions League final, but a far cry from the 1.5bn of the World Cup final 2022 (additional reference: Women's EURO 2022 hit 50m and the Super Bowl 2024 reached 250m) ‚ö°EURO 2024 is forecast to generate ‚Ç¨2.44bn in revenues, trailing the Champions League's ‚Ç¨3.23bn and only ~41% of the 2022 World Cup's massive ‚Ç¨5.89bn ‚ö° EURO format change in 2016 (expanding from 16 to 24 teams) lead to 20 more games and a subsequent increase in revenues; the Champions League (125 to 189 games) and the World Cup (32 to 48 teams, 64 to 104 games) are both expanding formats in their next iteration, further widening the revenue gap to the EURO Tier-1 properties increasingly dominate today's media landscape, sucking up all the attention and revenues. The EURO firmly belongs among the tier-1 properties in international football, featuring nearly all global football powerhouses (besides Brazil and Argentina). As such, revenues will continue to grow, but it will be interesting to see if this suffices for UEFA or whether they tweak the format again to keep up with the Champions League and the World Cup. üèÜ PS: England, France, Germany, Spain and Portugal (in this order) are the bookmakers favorites to win the tournament For more details, check out the full piece and enjoy the read!üòÑ Thanks for your interest and stay tuned for more üôå #football #uefa #EURO2024 #sportbusiness #finance #fifa #worldcup #championsleague\n\n‚öΩÔ∏è Copa Am√©rica Group C: Uruguay Thrashes Bolivia, Panama Stuns USA ‚öΩÔ∏è The action in Copa Am√©rica Group C continued with a night of high drama and significant outcomes.
