        "text": "Cape Town – If you’re keen for a fun night out, then look no further!\n\nCafé Roux Comedy Stand Up Sessions with Schalk Bezuidenhout, Liam Bento, Phil de Lange and Mel Jones is happening tonight, Wednesday 7 September.\n\nEvent details:\n\nVenue: Café Roux, The Farm Village, Noordhoek.\n\nAddress: 270 Chapman`s Peak Drive.\n\nTickets: R120.00\n\nTime: Dinner from 19:00. Show from 20:30.\n\nBookings: go to www.caferouxsessions.co.za or book at www.webtickets.co.za\n\nContact for enquiries: info@caferoux.co.za / 021 789 2538\n\nSchalk Bezuidenhout (HEADLINE ACT) was born in a very Afrikaans town right next to the airport in Joburg. In Kempton Park the traditional Afrikaans way of living was a good life. Your mother’s breast milk would be brannewyn en coke, you would walk kaalvoet to school, and you’d hide your lunch money when a black man walked past. His family and friends stood back as they watched Schalk evolve from an Afrikaans conservative caterpillar into a beautiful dramaqueen butterfly, complete with a moustache and furry afro. It was obvious to Schalk’s parents that he would study drama, and to help numb the pain they sent him away to study at the University of Cape Town.\n\nWhile studying in Cape Town Schalk slowly began to realise that there was so much more to life than boerewors and rugby, and started doing stand-up in April 2011. On stage Schalk is fun and energetic and appeals to people of all kinds and colours. Schalk has come a far way in the short amount of time that he has been doing comedy. He has had the privelage to perform at some great venues, alongside some even greater comedians.\n\nBorn and raised in Cape Town and a proud resident of Mitchell’s Plain, Mel Jones (HOST) describes herself as \"the favourite\" of three siblings. She is a single mother, an award nominated comedian, award nominated radio producer and an energetic MC. Her career started taking flight when she was fondly received at the Spier Amphitheatre only 6 short weeks after doing her very first open mic slot.\n\nSince then, you may have heard her on the radio as co-presenter of a very popular morning show, seen her on SABC3’s Comedy Showcase, the Phat Joe show, the King Size Comedy Tour, the Blacks Only Comedy Show, Mind The Gap, The Heavyweight Comedy Jam, Kings & Queens of Comedy, the critically acclaimed comedy & sketch show, Bitches, the Vodacom Funny Festival where she was their very first female host, Comedy Central and is hugely popular as a corporate comedian and MC. hit. Mel takes laughter and hilarity very seriously and as one of only a handful of female comedians in the country, she is part of a very exclusive club.\n\nHe’s performed at Cape Town and Joburg’s hottest comedy venues. He’s been a popular act at Rocking The Daisies, Synergy Live, and the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown in both 2014 and 2015. Here he played the Cape Town Comedy Club late night comedy stage, Pants On Fire, Goliath & Goliath, Stand Up 4 Comedy, and also opened for Sne Dladla’s The Joke’s On You in 2014. He’s also opened for Gino Fernandez and Robby Collins at their Cape Town shows. Phil De Lange (SUPPORT ACT) is a comic originally from Bloemfontein and has been playing the Cape Town circuit since 2013.\n\nHe broke into the comedy scene at the much loved Armchair Theatre in Cape Town, which has sparked the careers for a great deal of South African comedians. He carries a ukulele around and mixes it up with a blend of awkward, tongue in cheek, at times self-deprecating, musical, and stand-up comedy.\n\nPhil is also part of the Comedy On A Roll collective that runs comedy shows across Cape Town, including the very popular Armchair Wednesday open mic night.\n\nCape Town based comedian, Liam Bento (SUPPORT ACT) has been in the comedy game since 2009, starting off as one of a stable of comedians at Jokers Comedy Club with the likes of Kagiso ‘KG’ Mokgadi and Carl Weber, then going on to perform at some of the hottest spots in Cape Town including Zulu Bar, Purple Turtle and becoming a regular support act at Cape Towns premiere comedy venue Jou Ma Se Comedy Club Liam’s brand of comedic social commentary focuses on the everyday things we all take for granted, never talk about and can relate to.\n\n(Photos: Supplied)"
