        "text": "Effect of indomethacin on desmopressin resistant nocturnal polyuria and nocturnal enuresis.\n\nPubMed\n\nKamperis, Konstantinos; Rittig, SÃ¸ren; Bower, Wendy F; Djurhuus, Jens C\n\n2012-11-01\n\nWe evaluated the acute effect of indomethacin on renal water and solute handling in children with coexisting monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and desmopressin resistant nocturnal polyuria, and in healthy controls. A total of 23 subjects were recruited, consisting of 12 children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and nocturnal polyuria with partial or no response to desmopressin, and 11 age matched controls. Children completed a 48-hour inpatient study protocol consisting of fractional urine collections and blood samples. Sodium and water intake were standardized. During the second night a dose of 50 mg indomethacin was administered orally before bedtime. Diuresis, urine osmolalities, clearances and fractional excretions were calculated for sodium, potassium, urea, osmoles and solute-free water. Renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide were measured in plasma. Prostaglandin E(2) was measured in urine. Indomethacin markedly decreased the nocturnal sodium, urea and osmotic excretion in children with enuresis and controls. The overall effect on nocturnal urine output was inconsistent in the group with enuresis. Subjects in whom nocturnal diuresis was decreased following administration of indomethacin remained dry. Prostaglandin inhibition leads to antidiuresis, reducing the amount of sodium, urea and osmotic excretion in children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and desmopressin resistant nocturnal polyuria. The sodium regulating hormones do not seem to mediate these processes. The overall effect in desmopressin nonresponders with nocturnal polyuria is variable. The extent to which indomethacin can be applied in the treatment of enuresis needs further evaluation. Copyright Â© 2012 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.

A total of 42 children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and significant nocturnal polyuria with high nocturnal urinary osmolality (more than 850 mmol/l) were not responding to desmopressin. A 24-hour urinary concentration profile was obtained with measurement of urine volume, osmolality, osmotic excretion and creatinine. The control group consisted of 100 children without enuresis. Based on osmotic excretion patients were classified into 3 groups. Group 1 had 24-hour increased osmotic excretion, most likely secondary to a high renal osmotic load. This was probably diet related since 11 of these 12 patients were obese. Group 2 had increased osmotic excretion in the evening and night, probably due to a high renal osmotic load caused by the diet characteristics of the evening meal. Group 3 had deficient osmotic excretion during the day, secondary to extremely low fluid intake to compensate for small bladder capacity. Nocturnal polyuria with high urinary osmolality in our patients with desmopressin resistant monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis is related to abnormal increased osmotic excretion. This may be explained by their fluid and diet habits, eg daytime fluid restriction, and high protein and salt intake.\n\nThe pathophysiology of monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis with special emphasis on the circadian rhythm of renal physiology.\n\nPubMed\n\nDossche, L; Walle, J Vande; Van Herzeele, C\n\n2016-06-01\n\nNocturnal polyuria in monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE) has so far mainly been attributed to a disturbed circadian rhythm of renal water handling. Low vasopressin levels overnight correlate with absent maximal concentrating activity, resulting in an increased nocturnal diuresis with low urinary osmolality. Therefore, treatment with desmopressin is a rational choice. Unfortunately, 20 to 60Â % of children with monosymptomatic enuresis are desmopressin-resistant. There is increasing evidence that other disturbed circadian rhythms might play a role in nocturnal polyuria. This review focuses on renal aspects in the pathophysiology of nocturnal polyuria in MNE, with special emphasis on circadian rhythms. Articles related to renal circadian rhythms and enuresis were searched through the PubMed library with the goal of providing a concise review. Nocturnal polyuria can only partially be explained by blunted circadian rhythm of vasopressin secretion. Other alterations in the intrinsic renal circadian clock system also seem to be involved, especially in desmopressin-resistant enuresis. â¢ Disturbance in the circadian rhythm of arginine vasopressin secretion is related to nocturnal polyuria in children with enuresis. â¢ Desmopressin is recommended as a treatment for monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis, working as a vasopressin analogue acting on V2 receptors in the collecting ducts of the kidney. What is New: â¢ Other renal circadian rhythms might play a role in nocturnal polyuria, especially in desmopressin-resistant case.\n\nDesmopressin (melt) therapy in children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and nocturnal polyuria results in improved neuropsychological functioning and sleep.\n\nPubMed\n\nVan Herzeele, Charlotte; Dhondt, Karlien; Roels, Sanne P; Raes, Ann; Hoebeke, Piet; Groen, Luitzen-Albert; Vande Walle, Johan\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThere is a high comorbidity between nocturnal enuresis, sleep disorders and psychological problems. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a decrease in nocturnal diuresis volume not only improves enuresis but also ameliorates disrupted sleep and (neuro)psychological dysfunction, the major comorbidities of this disorder. In this open-label, prospective phase IV study, 30 children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE) underwent standardized video-polysomnographic testing and multi-informant (neuro)psychological testing at baseline and 6 months after the start of desmopressin treatment in the University Hospital Ghent, Belgium. Primary endpoints were the effect on sleep and (neuro)psychological functioning. The secondary endpoint was the change in the first undisturbed sleep period or the time to the first void. Thirty children aged between 6 and 16 (mean 10.43, standard deviation 3.08) years completed the study. The results demonstrated a significant decrease in periodic limb movements during sleep (PLMS) and a prolonged first undisturbed sleep period. Additionally, (neuro)psychological functioning was improved on several domains. The study demonstrates that the degree of comorbidity symptoms is at least aggravated by enuresis (and/or high nocturnal diuresis rate) since sleep and (neuro)psychological functioning were significantly ameliorated by treatment of enuresis. These results indicate that enuresis is not such a benign condition as has previously been assumed.\n\nNocturnal polyuria is related to absent circadian rhythm of glomerular filtration rate.\n\nPubMed\n\nDe Guchtenaere, A; Vande Walle, C; Van Sintjan, P; Raes, A; Donckerwolcke, R; Van Laecke, E; Hoebeke, P; Vande Walle, J\n\n2007-12-01\n\nMonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis is frequently associated with nocturnal polyuria and low urinary osmolality during the night. Initial studies found decreased vasopressin levels associated with low urinary osmolality overnight. Together with the documented desmopressin response, this was suggestive of a primary role for vasopressin in the pathogenesis of enuresis in the absence of bladder dysfunction. Recent studies no longer confirm this primary role of vasopressin. Other pathogenetic factors such as disordered renal sodium handling, hypercalciuria, increased prostaglandins and/or osmotic excretion might have a role. So far, little attention has been given to abnormalities in the circadian rhythm of glomerular filtration rate. We evaluated the circadian rhythm of glomerular filtration rate and diuresis in children with desmopressin resistant monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and nocturnal polyuria. We evaluated 15 children (9 boys) 9 to 14 years old with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and nocturnal polyuria resistant to desmopressin treatment. The control group consisted of 25 children (12 boys) 9 to 16 years old with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis without nocturnal polyuria. Compared to the control population, children with nocturnal polyuria lost their circadian rhythm not only for diuresis and sodium excretion but also for glomerular filtration rate. Patients with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and nocturnal polyuria lack a normal circadian rhythm for diuresis and sodium excretion, and the circadian rhythm of glomerular filtration rate is absent. This absence of circadian rhythm of glomerular filtration rate and/or sodium handling cannot be explained by a primary role of vasopressin, but rather by a disorder in circadian rhythm of renal glomerular and/or tubular functions.\n\nEvidence of reduced bladder capacity during nighttime in children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBorg, B; Kamperis, K; Olsen, L H; Rittig, S\n\n2018-04-01\n\nBladder capacity in children with nocturnal enuresis is assessed by maximal voided volumes (MVV) obtained through daytime frequency volume (FV) charts. Although a degree of association has been demonstrated, daytime MVV does not consistently correspond with the nocturnal bladder capacity (NBC) in monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE). It was hypothesized that isolated reduced NBC is a common phenomenon in children with nocturnal enuresis, despite normal daytime bladder function. The aim of this study was to evaluate NBC in children with MNE and normal daytime voided volumes. Specifically, it aimed to determine the prevalence and degree of reduced NBC when using nocturnal urine production (NUP) during wet nights as a surrogate estimate of NBC. Furthermore, it aimed to investigate the relationship between NBC and desmopressin response. Data from 103 children aged 5-15 years consecutively treated for MNE in a tertiary referral centre and with normal MVV on daytime FV charts were collected for this cohort study. Home recordings were completed for 2Â weeks at baseline and during desmopressin dose titration. Estimated nocturnal bladder capacity (eNBC) was assessed separately each night as the total NUP causing a wet night. If NUP during a wet night was less than MVV, it was considered to be reduced eNBC during that particular night. Surprisingly, 82% (nÂ =Â 84) of the children with MNE and normal daytime MVV experienced at least one wet night, with NUP below the daytime MVV indicative of a reduced eNBC. For 84 patients, mean percentage of wet nights with reduced eNBC (NUP below MVV) was 49% (SDÂ Â±Â 31). A total of 11% of children with frequently reduced eNBC (>40% of wet nights with reduced eNBC) responded to desmopressin (Summary Fig.). Of the children with frequently reduced NBC, 91% experienced wet nights, with NUP <65% of expected bladder capacity (EBC). A significant proportion of children with MNE and normal MVV during the daytime frequently experienced wet\n\n[Nocturnal polyuria, treatment with desmopressin].\n\nPubMed\n\nZachoval, R; Krhut, J; Å ottner, O; HanuÅ¡, T; Martan, A; HorÄiÄka, L; Feyereisl, J; HalaÅ¡ka, M; Å vabÃ­k, K; Krofta, L\n\n2013-08-01\n\nNonpharmacologic and especially pharmacologic treatment options are available for nocturnal polyuria. Desmopressin represents the basis of pharmacologic treatment. Desmopressin acetate is a synthetic analogue of arginine vasopressin with high affinity to V2 receptors with antidiuretic effect. It is the only medicament currently registered for antidiuretic treatment. Desmopressin has not any relevant affinity to V1 receptors, and therefore there is no hypertensive effect in contrary to natural vasopressin. Desmopressin use before a bedtime leads to reduced production of urine during a sleep, therefore time between desires to void is prolonged and number of nocturia is reduced. Clinical effect, in a meaning of reduced urine production and increased osmolality of urine, lasts approximately 8-12 hours. In the treatment of nocturnal polyuria desmopressin is used orally one hour before a bedtime. It is essential to titrate an ideal dose, the initial dose is 60 Âµg of MELT formula (fast melting oral formulation) and it can be increased according to the clinical effect up to the maximal recommended daily dose 240 Âµg. Patients treated with desmopressin should cut down a fluid intake 1 hour before and 8 hours after the use of desmopressin. Total number of adverse events connected withdesmopressin treatment in clinical studies was higher compared to placebo but the side effects were mostly mild. The most common adverse events were headaches, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, dry mouth and hyponatremia both in the short-term and long-term clinical trials. Hyponatremia was observed mainly in patients over 65 year of age. Therefore treatment with desmopressin should not be commended in patients over 65 year of age without close monitoring of the natrium level in serum and all patients should be informed about the first symptoms of hyponatremia - headache, nausea and insomnia.

Choice of treatment depends on the frequency and severity of symptoms, the child's age and motivation. Treatment options for NE are alarm, desmopressin and imipramine. In particular, the main desmopressin therapeutical effect is the antidiuretic activity. The different formulations of desmopressin are an injectable solution, an oral tablet formulation and the recent oral lyophilisate (MELT). MELT with its higher biodisponibility guarantees the same therapy response of other formulations with a lower doses and it represents the first line and safety treatment for the NE.\n\nComparison of incidence of hyponatremia between intranasal and oral desmopressin in patients with central diabetes insipidus.\n\nPubMed\n\nKataoka, Yuko; Nishida, Sachi; Hirakawa, Akihiro; Oiso, Yutaka; Arima, Hiroshi\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCentral diabetes insipidus (CDI), which is characterized by polyuria and polydipsia, is caused by a deficiency of the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP). While CDI is treated with desmopressin, an analogue of AVP, the intranasal formulation is inconvenient and CDI patients reportedly prefer the oral formulation to the intranasal one. In Japan, intranasal desmopressin had been the only formulation for the treatment of CDI until 2012, when the desmopressin orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) was approved for treatment. In this study we analyzed 26 patients with CDI in whom intranasal desmopressin was switched to desmopressin ODT. The mean daily dose of intranasal desmopressin was 10 Â± 8 Î¼g/day, and that of desmopressin ODT was 142 Â± 59 Î¼g/day. The mean serum sodium levels were 140 Â± 5 mmol/L and 140 Â± 3 mmol/L with intranasal desmopressin and desmopressin ODT, respectively, and there were no significant differences between these values. The frequency of hyponatremia (<135 mmol/L) with intranasal desmopressin was 11.7% and that with desmopressin ODT was 7.6%, while the frequency of hyponatremia (<130 mmol/L) with intranasal desmopressin was 4.2% and that with desmopressin ODT was 1.3%. Statistical analyses revealed that incidence of hyponatremia was significantly decreased after the switch to desmopressin ODT. Thus, it is suggested that water balance is better controlled with desmopressin ODT than with intranasal desmopressin in patients with CDI.\n\nDesmopressin administration in children with central diabetes insipidus: a retrospective review.\n\nPubMed\n\nOoi, Hooi Leng; Maguire, Ann M; Ambler, Geoffrey R\n\n2013-01-01\n\nCentral diabetes insipidus (DI) is a rare disorder in children caused by a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone arginine (vasopressin). Desmopressin is the first line agent in management of central DI. However, one of the side effects of desmopressin is water intoxication and hyponatraemia. This study reviews the patterns of desmopressin use and side effects in our institution. Retrospective chart review of all patients with central DI followed up in one tertiary centre between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2010. Forty-one patients (22 males and 19 females) were included. Twelve patients (29.3%) had congenital and 29 patients (70.7%) had acquired DI, mostly as a result of intracranial tumours. Thirty-six (87.8%) patients were on oral desmopressin and the remaining on nasal formulation. The median oral dose was 9.5 (4.2-17.0) Î¼g/kg/day with median frequency of 2.5 (2-3). The median nasal dose was 0.7 (0.4-1.4) Î¼g/kg/day with median frequency of 2.0 (2-3.5). Fourteen patients (34.1%) were switched from nasal to oral desmopressin with the median dose conversion factor of 20.1 (10.7-31.8). Forty percent of patients on nasal desmopressin experienced hypo/hypernatraemia compared to 18.1% on oral, however, there were no significance difference between standardized hypo/hypernatraemia episodes per treatment year. Oral desmopressin is used in the majority of our patients including infants and toddlers. There is wide inter-individual variation in dose requirement and dosing intervals. Management of central diabetes insipidus remains a challenge in adipsic patients and in young children during intercurrent illness regardless of the desmopressin formulation.\n\nThe risk of hyponatremia with desmopressin use for nocturnal polyuria.\n\nPubMed\n\nChoi, Eun Young; Park, Joon-Sung; Kim, Yong Tae; Park, Sung Yul; Kim, Gheun-Ho\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDesmopressin is used for treating nocturnal polyuria, but hyponatremia is an associated concern in the elderly due to impaired urinary dilution. This study was undertaken to characterize hyponatremia occurring in adults using desmopressin for nocturnal polyuria. Data from 172 patients who were prescribed desmopressin for nocturnal polyuria at a urology clinic from September 2010 through February 2013 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic and laboratory parameters were investigated to examine the risk factors for desmopressin-associated hyponatremia. The average follow-up serum sodium measured 21 Â± 22 days after using desmopressin was 138 Â± 5 mmol/l. Hyponatremia (<135 mmol/l) was found in 24 patients (14%), and it was severe in 7 (<126 mmol/l). In the hyponatremic patients, serum sodium decreased by 11 Â± 6 mmol/l. Patients with hyponatremia were older than those with normonatremia (78 Â± 7 vs. 68 Â± 9 years, p < 0.0001). The presence of either hyponatremia-predisposing comorbidities or concurrent medications was associated with hyponatremia. Patients with hyponatremia had lower basal hemoglobin (11 Â± 2 vs. 13 Â± 2 g/dl, p < 0.001) and serum sodium (139 Â± 2 vs. 140 Â± 2 mmol/l, p < 0.05) than those with normonatremia. Multivariate logistic regression after adjustment for basal serum sodium showed that advanced age (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.03-1.27) and lower hemoglobin level (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.43-0.94) were independently associated with hyponatremia. Hyponatremia is not infrequently associated with desmopressin use. Those with advanced age (â¥65 years) and lower hemoglobin are at risk of desmopressin-associated hyponatremia and need to be carefully monitored. Â© 2015 S.

Current guidelines recommend serum sodium concentration correction targets of no more than 8 mEq/L per day in patients at high risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. Desmopressin is recommended to control high rates of serum sodium concentration correction in severe hyponatremia. However, recommendations are based on limited data. The objective of this study is to review current strategies for DDAVP use in severe hyponatremia. Systematic literature search of 4 databases of peer-reviewed studies was performed and study quality was appraised. The literature search identified 17 observational studies with 80 patients. We found 3 strategies for desmopressin administration in hyponatremia: 1) proactive, where desmopressin is administered early based on initial serum sodium concentration; 2) reactive, where desmopressin is administered based on changes in serum sodium concentration or urine output; 3) rescue, where desmopressin is administered after serum sodium correction targets are exceeded or when osmotic demyelination appears imminent. A proactive strategy of desmopressin administration with hypertonic saline was associated with lower incidence of exceeding serum sodium concentration correction targets, although this evidence is derived from a small case series. Three distinct strategies for desmopressin administration are described in the literature. Limitations in study design and sample size prevent definitive conclusions about the optimal strategy for desmopressin administration to correct hyponatremia. There is a pressing need for better quality research to guide clinicians in managing severe hyponatremia. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation has been documented to be efficacious in children with daytime incontinence. We investigated the effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation in children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis without nocturnal polyuria. Children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (3Â or more wet nights per week) and no nocturnal polyuria were randomized to treatment with active or sham transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation involving 1-hour sessions twice daily for 10 weeks in a double-blind design. Of the 52 children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis included in the study 47 completed treatment (mean age 9.5 Â± 2.1 years, 38 males). None of the children experienced a full response with complete remission of enuresis. Treatment with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation did not lead to significant changes in number of wet nights, nocturnal urine production on wet or dry nights, maximum voided volume with and without first morning voided volume, or voiding frequency when comparing parameters before and after treatment. The present study demonstrates no anti-enuretic effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation in children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis without nocturnal polyuria. Nocturnal urine production and bladder capacity remained unchanged during and after treatment with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.

Nocturnal polyuria is present in up to 88% of adults with nocturia, however, treatment options for reducing nighttime urine production have historically been limited to behavioral modification and off label use of timed diuretics and desmopressin. Noctiva TM (desmopressin acetate nasal spray, DANS, Serenity Pharmaceuticals, LLC) is a novel formulation of desmopressin approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria in March 2017. Areas covered: Incidence and etiology of nocturia, currently available therapies (approved and off label), and pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety data associated with DANS. Expert commentary: DANS has been studied for the treatment of nocturia in adults over age 50 without contraindications to the use of desmopressin. 49% receiving the higher clinical dose experienced â¥50% reduction in nocturnal voids in clinical trials vs. 30% with placebo. Although nadir serum sodium <135Â mmol/L was not uncommon (14%), the incidence of sodium â¤125Â mmol/L was rare (1%). DANS therefore appears to benefit a significant subset of patients with nocturia while maintaining an acceptable risk profile. Given the risks of hyponatremia, education of patients and prescribers in contraindications and the importance of monitoring are paramount.\n\nA combination of desmopressin and docetaxel inhibit cell proliferation and invasion mediated by urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) in human prostate cancer cells\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSasaki, Hiroshi; Klotz, Laurence H.; Sugar, Linda M.\n\nBackground: This study was designed to assess the effectiveness of a combination treatment using both desmopressin and docetaxel in prostate cancer treatment. Desmopressin is a well-known synthetic analogue of the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin. It has recently been demonstrated to inhibit tumor progression and metastasis in inÂ vivo models. Docetaxel is widely used for the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients. However, durable responses have been uncommon to date. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effect of desmopressin in combination with docetaxel inÂ vitro and inÂ vivo. Methods: Two prostate cancer cells (PC3, LNCaP) were treated with different concentrations of desmopressinmoreÂ Â» alone, docetaxel alone, and a combination of desmopressin and docetaxel. Cell proliferation was determined by MTS assay. The anti-invasive and anti-migration potential of desmopressin and in combination with docetaxel were examined by wound healing assay, migration chamber assay, and matrigel invasion assay. Results: The combination of desmopressin and docetaxel resulted in a significant inhibition of PC3 and LNCaP cell proliferation (pÂ <Â 0.01). Additionally, cell migration and invasion were also inhibited by the combination when compared to that of either treatment alone in PC3 cells (pÂ <Â 0.01). The anti-tumor effect of this combination treatment was associated with down-regulation of both urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2 and MMP-9) in PC3 cells. Conclusions: We are the first to elucidate the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic potential of desmopressin in combination with docetaxel in a prostate cancer model via the uPA-MMP pathway. Our finding could potentially contribute to the therapeutic profile of desmopressin and enhance the efficacy of docetaxel based treatment for CRPC. - Highlights: â¢ Desmopressin inhibits cell proliferation in prostate cancer cells. â¢ The expression of cyclin A\n\nEffects of desmopressin (DDAVP) on memory impairment following electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdollahian, Ebrahim; Sargolzaee, Mohammad R; Hajzade, Moosareza; Mohebbi, Mohammad D; Javanbakht, Arash\n\n2004-06-01\n\nMemory impairment is a common adverse effect of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Studies on animals and humans suggest that vasopressin improves the cognitive function, and positive effects of desmopressin on memory and learning have been reported. This research was performed for evaluation of the effects of desmopressin in the prevention of memory impairment following ECT. This randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial with placebo administration was performed on 50 patients with psychiatric disorders who were candidates for ECT. Subjects in the case group received 60 Âµm of intranasal desmopressin daily (in three doses of 20 Âµm). For the control group 0.9% saline solution was administered in the same way. Memory function was evaluated using Wechsler's Memory Scale three times a week (the first time before the start of ECT and the second and third times after the third and sixth sessions, respectively). Results were analyzed by t-test and Paired t-test. The mean age of patients was 29 years (range 20-40). During the course of ECT, patients in the control group demonstrated a meaningful decrease in memory scores (from a base score of 80.15-75.45 in the second test and 72.60 in the third test). Despite this, a meaningful increase in memory scores was observed during the treatment with desmopressin in the case group (from a base score of 73.27-75.70 and 79.13 in the second and the third tests, respectively). There was a meaningful difference between the two groups (P < 0.0001). This study confirms the protective effect of desmopressin against memory impairment. The results confirm that memory impairment is a common side-effect of ECT and suggest that desmopressin may prevent ECT-induced memory impairment by its effects on memory and the learning process.\n\nTransient diabetes insipidus in a preterm neonate and the challenge of desmopressin dosing.\n\nPubMed\n\nVan der Kaay, Danielle C M; Van Heel, Willemijn J M; Dudink, Jeroen; van den Akker, Erica L T\n\n2014-07-01\n\nAs neonatal central diabetes insipidus is rare in preterm neonates with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), very little is known about dosing and the route of administration of desmopressin treatment. We present a preterm neonate born at 29 weeks' gestation. Within 24 h, she developed bilateral IVH with subsequent post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus. On the 3rd postnatal day, she developed diabetes insipidus for which she was intranasally administered 0.2 mg desmopressin. This resulted in oliguria with several hours of anuria and a 25-point drop in sodium levels within 15 h. The determination of the desmopressin dose in a preterm neonate is a challenge and there is no consistent literature about the dosing or the route of administration. We suggest starting with a low dose of intranasal desmopressin (0.05-0.1 Î¼g) and titrate in accordance with clinical and laboratory parameters.\n\nIndirect-response modeling of desmopressin at different levels of hydration.\n\nPubMed\n\nCallrÃ©us, T; Odeberg, J; Lundin, S; HÃ¶glund, P\n\n1999-10-01\n\nThe objective of the present study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of desmopressin in healthy male subjects at different levels of overhydration. Also, we examined if an indirect-response model could be related to renal physiology and the pharmacological action of desmopressin. Eight healthy male subjects participated in this open, randomized crossover study with three periods. Each subject was orally water loaded (0 to 20 ml.kg-1 body weight) on 3 study days in order to achieve three different levels of hydration. After the initial water load, urine was voided every 15 min and the volumes were measured. To ensure continuous overhydration the subjects replaced their fluid loss with drinking-water. When a steady-state diuresis was achieved after approximately 2 hr, 0.396 microgram of desmopressin was administered intravenously as a bolus injection. Blood was sampled and urine was collected at intervals throughout the study day (10 hr). An indirect-response model, where desmopressin was assumed to inhibit the elimination of response, was fit to the urine osmolarity data. There were no statistically significant effects of different levels of hydration, as expressed by urine flow rate at baseline, on the estimates of the PK and PD model parameters. The calculated terminal half-lives of elimination (t1/2 beta) ranged between 2.76 and 8.37 hr with an overall mean of 4.36 hr. The overall means of plasma clearance and the volumes of distribution of the central compartment (Vc) and at steady state (Vss) were estimated to be 1.34 (SD 0.35) ml.min-1.kg-1, 151 (SD28) ml.kg-1, and 386 (SD 63) ml.kg-1, respectively. High urine flow rate, indicating overhydration, produced a diluted urine and thus a low osmolarity at baseline (R0). The effect of the urine flow rate on the urine osmolarity at baseline was highly significant (p < 0.0001). The mean values for IC50 and the sigmodicity factor (gamma) were 3.7 (SD 1.2) pg ml-1 and 13.0 (SD 3\n\nSleep fragmentation and periodic limb movements in children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis and polyuria.\n\nPubMed\n\nDhondt, Karlien; Van Herzeele, Charlotte; Roels, Sanne Patrick; Raes, Ann; Groen, Luitzen-Albert; Hoebeke, Piet; Walle, Johan Vande\n\n2015-07-01\n\nChildren with nocturnal enuresis (NE) have been found to have sleep fragmentation and a high incidence of periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS). This study explored the association of monosymptomatic NE and polyuria in relation to fluid intake, bladder volume, number of wet nights, and number of nights with polyuria to the frequency of PLMS and cortical arousals during sleep. Thirty children with monosymptomatic NE and polyuria were enrolled in the study. Enuretic parameters were determined by diaries, forced drinking, uroflow, and ultrasound examination. All subjects participated in one polysomnographic study. The number of cortical arousals and PLMS were compared with those recorded in a former pilot study which included only children with refractory NE. Of the 30 children who participated in the study, the mean age was 10.43 Â± 3.08 (range 6-16) years, and 23 were boys. The PLMS index was positively associated with the arousal index and the awakening index (p < 0.001). No significant association between the sleep and the enuretic parameters was found. Children with refractory NE showed a significantly higher PLMS index (p < 0.001). We found that PLMS and cortical arousals in sleep were increased in children with monosymptomatic NE and polyuria, without a significant association with the enuretic parameters. These observations suggest the presence of a comorbid mechanism driven by a common, independent pacemaker. We hypothesize the autonomic system, its sympathetic branch, and the dopaminergic system as candidates for this pacemaker.\n\nPharmacokinetic Modelling to Predict FVIII:C Response to Desmopressin and Its Reproducibility in Nonsevere Haemophilia A Patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchÃ¼tte, Lisette M; van Hest, Reinier M; Stoof, Sara C M; Leebeek, Frank W G; Cnossen, Marjon H; Kruip, Marieke J H A; MathÃ´t, Ron A A\n\n2018-04-01\n\nâNonsevere haemophilia A (HA) patients can be treated with desmopressin. Response of factor VIII activity (FVIII:C) differs between patients and is difficult to predict. âOur aims were to describe FVIII:C response after desmopressin and its reproducibility by population pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling. âRetrospective data of 128 nonsevere HA patients (age 7-75 years) receiving an intravenous or intranasal dose of desmopressin were used. PK modelling of FVIII:C was performed by nonlinear mixed effect modelling. Reproducibility of FVIII:C response was defined as less than 25% difference in peak FVIII:C between administrations. âA total of 623 FVIII:C measurements from 142 desmopressin administrations were available; 14 patients had received two administrations at different occasions. The FVIII:C time profile was best described by a two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. Interindividual variability of the estimated baseline FVIII:C, central volume of distribution and clearance were 37, 43 and 50%, respectively. The most recently measured FVIII:C (FVIII-recent) was significantly associated with FVIII:C response to desmopressin ( p â<â0.001). Desmopressin administration resulted in an absolute FVIII:C increase of 0.47 IU/mL (median, interquartile range: 0.32-0.65 IU/mL, n â=â142). C response was reproducible in 6 out of 14 patients receiving two desmopressin administrations. âFVIII:C response to desmopressin in nonsevere HA patients was adequately described by a population PK model. Large variability in FVIII:C response was observed, which could only partially be explained by FVIII-recent. C response was not reproducible in a small subset of patients. Therefore, monitoring FVIII:C around surgeries or bleeding might be considered. Research is needed to study this further.

No significant changes were observed in serum concentrations of FSH and LH after 9 days with DDAVP therapy. Nevertheless, serum concentrations of testosterone after 12 hours of DDAVP administration were significantly higher than basal concentrations. Three hours after the administration of DDAVP, serum testosterone concentrations decreased significantly. The conclusion reached was that low doses of desmopressin do not change serum concentrations of FSH and LH, but serum concentration of testosterone is decreased within three hours after the administration, although an increase is observed 12 hours later possibly due to a \"rebound effect\". Desmopressin would therefore directly act upon human testicle.\n\nEfficacy of Desmopressin to Treat Nocturnal Polyuria in Elderly Men: Effects on Sleep Quality.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Sun-Ouck; Yu, Ho Song; Kwon, Dongdeuk\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe investigated the efficacy of desmopressin in elderly patients with nocturnal polyuria (NP) to evaluate its effects on sleep quality. Patients with NP (defined as the nighttime urine production >33% of total 24-hour urine volume determined from a frequency-volume chart) were recruited. Desmopressin (0.2 mg) was treated orally at bedtime for 12 weeks. The participants completed the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale. The mean patient age was 62.7 Â± 13.0 (range 42-78 years). The mean symptom duration was 42.2 Â± 39.7 months. The number of nocturia episodes (from 3.49 Â± 1.83 to 2.03 Â± 1.35, p = 0.01), nocturnal urine volume (p = 0.01), NP index (p = 0.01), and nocturia index (p = 0.01) decreased significantly after treatment with desmopressin. Among the MOS Sleep Scale categories, hours slept/night (p = 0.042), shortness of breath (p = 0.019), and adequacy of sleep (p = 0.001) changed significantly with a decrease in the number of nocturia episodes. Adverse events were mild. Desmopressin is an effective treatment for NP and improved sleep quality in elderly men. Â© 2016 S.

This is costly and may be associated with transfusion reactions and fluid overload. We evaluated the efficacy of intranasal desmopressin as an alternative to transfusion to correct the coagulopathy of cirrhotic patients undergoing dental extraction. Cirrhotic patients with platelet counts of 30,000 to 50,000/microL and/or international normalized ratio (INR) 2.0 to 3.0 were enrolled in a prospective, controlled, randomized clinical trial. Blood transfusion (fresh frozen plasma 10 mL/kg and/or 1 unit of single donor platelets, respectively) or intranasal desmopressin (300 microg) were given before dental extraction. A standard oral and maxillofacial surgical treatment protocol was performed by the same surgeon. Patients were followed for postextraction bleeding and side-effects over the next 24 to 48 hours. No significant differences were noted between the 2 groups in gender, age, INR, platelet count, creatinine, total bilirubin, ALT, albumin, MELD score, or number of teeth removed (median 3 vs 4). The number of teeth removed ranged between 1 and 31 in the desmopressin group and 1 and 22 in the transfusion group. No patients in desmopressin group required rescue blood transfusion after extraction. One patient in the transfusion group had bleeding after the procedure and required an additional transfusion. Another patient experienced an allergic reaction at the end of transfusion, which was effectively treated with diphenhydramine. Treatment associated average costs were lower for desmopressin ($700/patient) compared with transfusion ($1,173/patient). Intranasal desmopressin was as effective as blood transfusion in achieving hemostasis in cirrhotic patients with moderate coagulopathy undergoing dental extraction. Intranasal desmopressin was much more convenient, less expensive, and well tolerated.\n\nDesmopressin acetate (DDAVP) for preventing and treating acute bleeds during pregnancy in women with congenital bleeding disorders.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaranth, Laxminarayan; Barua, Ankur; Kanagasabai, Sachchithanantham; Nair, N S\n\n2013-04-30\n\nCongenital bleeding disorders can cause obstetric haemorrhage during pregnancy, labour and following delivery. Desmopressin acetate is found to be an effective drug which can reduce the risk of haemorrhage and can also stop bleeding in certain congenital bleeding disorders. Its use in pregnancy has been controversial. Hence beneficial and adverse effects of desmopressin acetate in these groups of pregnant women should be evaluated. To determine the efficacy of desmopressin acetate in preventing and treating acute bleeds during pregnancy in women with congenital bleeding disorders.

We report a patient who, while receiving desmopressin and contraceptive pills (OCP), developed straight sinus thrombosis. Clinical assessment and laboratory investigations revealed untreated hyperthyroidism and a hypercoagulable state, characterised by high levels of von Willebrand factor, factor VIII coagulant activity and IgM cardiolipin antibody. The clinical picture improved with anticoagulation, treatment of hyperthyroidism and discontinuation of OCP and desmopressin. To the best of our knowledge, the association between the use of oral desmopressin and CVT has not been described. The multiple risk factors present in our case were probably additive in increasing the risk of CVT. Although this case represents a rare occurrence, practitioners should be alerted to the possible associations of desmopressin, oral contraceptives and Graves' disease with venous thrombosis. 2016 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.\n\n[Treatment with sublingual desmopressin in two infants with hydranencephaly and central diabetes insipidus].\n\nPubMed\n\nMarÃ­n, Gustavo R; Baspineiro, Berta; Vilca, Iris\n\n2018-02-01\n\nCentral diabetes insipidus is a rare disease in children caused by a deficiency of vasopressin.

The release of desmopressin from different solid lipid microparticles in the absence and presence of a microbial lipase and protease was determined. Trilaurin (TG12), trimyristin (TG14), tripalmitin (TG16), and tristearin (TG18) were used as lipid excipients to produce solid lipid microparticles. In the presence of lipase, the rate of drug release from different lipid particles was in the order of TG14 > TG16 > TG18, which is the same rank order as the lipid degradation rate. A reverse rank order was found for the protection of desmopressin from enzymatic degradation due to spatial separation of desmopressin from the protease. TG12 accelerated the release of desmopressin from all lipid particles when added as either drug-free microparticles to the lipolysis medium or incorporated in TG16 particles. Additionally, TG12 particles protected desmopressin from degradation when present in the lipolysis medium with the other lipid microparticles. TG12 is a very interesting lipid for oral lipid formulations containing peptides and proteins as it alters release and degradation of the incorporated desmopressin. The present study demonstrates the possibility of bio-relevant in vitro evaluation of lipid-based solid particles.\n\nEfficacy of Hydrochlorothiazide and low renal solute feed in Neonatal Central Diabetes Insipidus with transition to Oral Desmopressin in early infancy.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbraham, Mary B; Rao, Shripada; Price, Glynis; Choong, Catherine S\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe treatment of central diabetes insipidus (DI) with desmopressin in the neonatal period is challenging because of the significant risk of hyponatremia with this agent. The fixed anti-diuresis action of desmopressin and the obligate high fluid intake with milk feeds lead to considerable risk of water intoxication and hyponatremia. To reduce this risk, thiazide diuretics, part of the treatment of nephrogenic DI, were used in conjunction with low renal solute feed and were effective in a single case series of neonatal central DI. We evaluated the efficacy of early treatment of neonatal central DI with hydrochlorothiazide with low solute feed and investigated the clinical indicators for transition to desmopressin during infancy. A retrospective chart review was conducted at Princess Margaret Hospital, Perth of neonates diagnosed with central DI and treated with hydrochlorothiazide, between 2007 and 2013. Four newborns were identified. Mean sNa and mean change in sNa with desmopressin and hydrochlorothiazide treatment were recorded along with episodes of hyponatremia and hypernatremia. Length and weight trajectories during the first 12 months were assessed. The mean change in sNa per day with hydrochlorothiazide and low renal solute feed was 2.5 - 3 mmol/L; on desmopressin treatment, the mean change in sNa was 6.8-7.9 mmol/L. There was one episode of symptomatic hyponatremia with intranasal desmopressin with no episodes of hyponatremia or hypernatremia during treatment with hydrochlorothiazide or following transition to oral desmopressin. Transition to oral desmopressin between 3 to 12 months of age was associated with good control of DI. Following introduction of solids, sNa remained stable but weight gain was slow. This improved following transition to desmopressin in one infant. Hydrochlorothiazide with low renal solute feed is a safe and effective treatment option in neonatal central DI. However, transition to desmopressin should be considered early in infancy\n\nDesmopressin acetate (DDAVP) for preventing and treating acute bleeds during pregnancy in women with congenital bleeding disorders.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaranth, Laxminarayan; Barua, Ankur; Kanagasabai, Sachchithanantham; Nair, Sreekumar\n\n2015-09-09\n\nCongenital bleeding disorders can cause obstetric haemorrhage during pregnancy, labour and following delivery.

Eligible patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia older than 65 years with nocturia, nocturnal polyuria and International Prostate Symptom Score 14 or greater were included in the study. All patients received placebo or 0.1 mg desmopressin orally at bedtime. Patients were required to visit the outpatient clinic from the first visit, and after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment. Patients maintained flow volume charts and used diaries to record voiding data throughout the study. During followup urinalysis, urine sodium, urine osmolality, serum electrolytes, prostate specific antigen, International Prostate Symptom Score, quality of life, transrectal ultrasonography of prostate, uroflowmetry and post-void residual urine volume were performed at each visit. A total of 115 patients were enrolled in the study and randomized as 58 in the placebo group and 57 in the desmopressin group. Desmopressin significantly decreased nocturnal urine output and the number of nocturia episodes, and prolonged the first sleep period (p < 0.01). Compared to before treatment desmopressin gradually decreased serum sodium and induced statistically but not clinically significant hyponatremia after 12 months of treatment. No serious systemic complications were found during medication. Low dose oral desmopressin is an effective and well tolerated treatment for nocturnal polyuria in the lower urinary tract symptoms of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Long-term desmopressin therapy gradually decreases serum sodium and it might induce hyponatremia even in patients without initial hyponatremia. For long-term desmopressin administration serum sodium should be assessed carefully, at least at 1 week after treatment.

To evaluate the efficacy of topical use of Matricaria recutita L oil in the treatment of enuresis in children. Methods. Eighty patients diagnosed as monosymptomatic nocturnal or daytime enuresis were allocated to receive Matricaria recutita L (chamomile) oil or placebo topically for 6 weeks in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial with a parallel design. Patients were evaluated prior to and following 8 weeks of the intervention in terms of frequency of enuresis and any observed adverse events. Results. The mean frequency of enuresis at the first, second, and third 2 weeks was lower in the intervention group compared with the placebo group, and the differences were statistically significant (P < .001, P = .03, and P < .001, respectively). There was no report of any adverse event in the study groups. Conclusion. The findings of this study showed that the topical use of (chamomile) oil can decrease the frequency of nocturia in children with monosymptomatic nocturnal or daytime enuresis.

The desmopressin stimulation test is used in the diagnosis and postsurgery prognosis of Cushing disease (CD). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the desmopressin-induced ACTH increase in patients with CD are poorly understood. The objectives of this study were to determine, for the first time, whether desmopressin acts directly and exclusively on pituitary corticotropinoma cells to stimulate ACTH expression/release and to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in desmopressin-induced ACTH increase in CD. A total of 8 normal pituitaries (NPs), 23 corticotropinomas, 14 nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, 17 somatotropinomas, and 3 prolactinomas were analyzed for AVPR expression by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Primary cultures derived from corticotropinomas, nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, somatotropinomas, prolactinomas, and NPs were treated with desmopressin, and ACTH secretion/expression, [Ca(2+)]i kinetics, and AVPR expression and/or proliferative response were evaluated. The relationship between AVPR expression and plasma adrenocorticotropin/cortisol levels obtained from desmopressin tests was assessed. Desmopressin affects all functional parameters evaluated in corticotropinoma cells but not in NPs or other pituitary adenomas cells. These effects might be due to the dramatic elevation of AVPR1b expression levels found in corticotropinomas. In line with this notion, the use of an AVPR1b antagonist completely blocked desmopressin stimulatory effects. Remarkably, only AVPR1b expression was positively correlated with elevated plasma adrenocorticotropin levels in corticotropinomas. The present results provide a cellular and molecular basis to support the desmopressin stimulation test as a reliable, specific test for the diagnosis and postsurgery prognosis of CD. Furthermore, our data indicate that AVPR1b is responsible for the direct\n\nManagement of nocturnal enuresis - myths and facts\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSinha, Rajiv; Raut, Sumantra\n\n2016-01-01\n\nNocturnal enuresis often causes considerable distress or functional impairment to patient and their parents necessitating a multidisciplinary approach from paediatrician, paediatric nephrologist, urologists and psychiatrist. Mechanisms of monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis are mainly nocturnal polyuria, bladder overactivity and failure to awaken from sleep in response to bladder sensations. Goal oriented and etiology wise treatment includes simple behavioral intervention, conditioning alarm regimen and pharmacotherapy with desmopressin, imipramine and anticholinergic drugs.

It has been demonstrated that desmopressin improves platelet function under hypothermia. We tested platelet function ex vivo during hypothermia and acidosis. Blood samples were taken from 12 healthy subjects and assigned as follows: normal pH, pH 7.2, and pH 7.0, each with and without incubation with desmopressin. Platelet aggregation was assessed by multiple electrode aggregometry. Baseline was normal pH and 36 degrees C. The other samples were incubated for 30 min and measured at 32 degrees C. Acidosis significantly impaired aggregation. Desmopressin significantly increased aggregability during hypothermia and acidosis regardless of pH, but did not return it to normal values at low pH. During acidosis and hypothermia, acidosis should be corrected first; desmopressin can then be administered to improve platelet function as a bridge until normothermia can be achieved.\n\nDesmopressin test during petrosal sinus sampling: a valuable tool to discriminate pituitary or ectopic ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nCastinetti, F; Morange, I; Dufour, H; Jaquet, P; Conte-Devolx, B; Girard, N; Brue, T\n\n2007-09-01\n\nCorticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-stimulated petrosal sinus sampling is currently the gold standard method for the differential diagnosis between pituitary and ectopic ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome. Our objective was to determine sensitivity and specificity of desmopressin test during petrosal sinus sampling. Forty-three patients had petrosal sinus sampling because of the lack of visible adenoma on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or because of discordant cortisol response to high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. ACTH sampling was performed in an antecubital vein, right and left petrosal sinuses, then at each location 5 and 10 min after injection of desmopressin. Diagnosis was based on the ACTH ratio between petrosal sinus and humeral vein ACTH after desmopressin test. Diagnosis was confirmed after surgery. A receiver operating characteristics curve was used to determine optimal sensitivity and specificity. Thirty-six patients had Cushing's disease (CD) and seven had ectopic ACTH secretion. A ratio > 2 after desmopressin was found in 35 of the 36 cases of CD (sensitivity: 95%). A ratio < or = 2 was found in the seven patients with ectopic ACTH secretion (specificity: 100%). Sinus sampling was ineffective in determining the left or right localization of the adenoma (sensitivity = 50%). No major adverse effects were observed during or after the procedure. Desmopressin test during petrosal sinus sampling is a safe and effective diagnostic procedure in ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome. It thus represents a valuable alternative to CRH.\n\nCircadian Rhythm of Glomerular Filtration and Solute Handling Related to Nocturnal Enuresis.\n\nPubMed\n\nDossche, L; Raes, A; Hoebeke, P; De Bruyne, P; Vande Walle, J\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAlthough nocturnal polyuria in patients with monosymptomatic enuresis can largely be explained by the decreased nocturnal vasopressin secretion hypothesis, other circadian rhythms in the kidney also seem to have a role. We recently documented an absent day/night rhythm in a subgroup of desmopressin refractory cases. We explore the importance of abnormal circadian rhythm of glomerular filtration and tubular (sodium, potassium) parameters in patients with monosymptomatic enuresis. In this retrospective study of a tertiary enuresis population we collected data subsequent to a standardized screening (International Children's Continence Society questionnaire), 14-day diary for nocturnal enuresis and diuresis, and 24-hour concentration profile. The study population consisted of 139 children with nocturnal enuresis who were 5 years or older. Children with nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis were used as controls. There was a maintained circadian rhythm of glomerular filtration, sodium, osmotic excretion and diuresis rate in children with monosymptomatic and nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis, and there was no difference between the 2 groups. Secondary analysis revealed that in patients with nocturnal polyuria (with monosymptomatic or nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis) circadian rhythm of glomerular filtration, sodium and osmotic excretion, and diuresis rate was diminished in contrast to those without nocturnal polyuria (p <0.001). Circadian rhythm of the kidney does not differ between patients with nonmonosymptomatic and monosymptomatic enuresis. However, the subgroup with enuresis and nocturnal polyuria has a diminished circadian rhythm of nocturnal diuresis, sodium excretion and glomerular filtration in contrast to children without nocturnal polyuria. This observation cannot be explained by the vasopressin theory alone. Copyright Â© 2016 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The impact on Asian children, however, is not known. This study investigates the relationship between SE and monosymptomatic NE in Malaysian children aged 6 to 16 years. Children with wetting frequency of at least 4 out of 14 nights were recruited with controls matched for age, gender and race. SE scores were obtained using the 'I Think I Am' questionnaire for five domains: body image, talents and skills, psychological well-being, relationship with family and relationship with others. A total of 126 children were recruited; 22 enuretics aged 6-9 years and their matched controls (Group1) and 41 enuretics aged 10-16 years and their matched controls (Group 2). SE scores were similar between the enuretic and controls in Group 1, whereas in Group 2, enuretics had significantly lower scores (P < 0.05) in 'body image', 'relationship with others' and total SE scores. This difference was more pronounced among girls, adolescents and those who wet more than 10/14 nights. The SE of Malaysian children with monosymptomatic NE aged 10 years and above is significantly lower than their peers. This effect is seen particularly among girls, adolescents and those with frequent wetting. In the light of these findings, the 'wait and see' approach by the Malaysian medical profession is no longer appropriate. Treatment should begin before the age of 10 years. Â© 2012 The Authors.

In this study, we investigated the pharmacokinetics of two formulations-a tablet and a lyophilisate-in both fasted and fed children. Previously published data from two studies (one in 22 children aged 6-16Â years, and the other in 25 children aged 6-13Â years) were analyzed using population pharmacokinetic modeling. A one-compartment model with first-order absorption was fitted to the data. Covariates were selected using a forward selection procedure. The final model was evaluated, and sensitivity analysis was performed to improve future sampling designs. Simulations were subsequently performed to further explore the relative bioavailability of both formulations and the food effect. The final model described the plasma desmopressin concentrations adequately. The formulation and the fed state were included as covariates on the relative bioavailability. The lyophilisate was, on average, 32.1Â % more available than the tablet, and fasted children exhibited an average increase in the relative bioavailability of 101Â % in comparison with fed children. Body weight was included as a covariate on distribution volume, using a power function with an exponent of 0.402. Simulations suggested that both the formulation and the food effect were clinically relevant. Bioequivalence data on two formulations of the same drug in adults cannot be readily extrapolated to children. This was the first study in children suggesting that the two desmopressin formulations are not bioequivalent in children at the currently approved dose levels. Furthermore, the effect of food intake was found to be clinically relevant. Sampling times for a future study were suggested. This sampling design should result in more informative data and consequently generate a more robust model.\n\nEffects of desmopressin for the treatment of nocturnal polyuria in elderly women: impact on related sleep quality\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMun, Jong-Hyeon; Kim, Sun-Ouck; Yu, Ho Song; Chung, Ho Suck; Kwon, Dongdeuk\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIntroduction: We investigated the efficacy, safety, and impact of desmopressin on quality of sleep in treating nocturnal polyuria in elderly women. Methods: We recruited 60 women over 60 years old with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), including nocturia, and with nocturnal polyuria. Nocturnal polyuria was defined as nighttime urine production exceeding 33% of the 24-hour total urine volume determined by a frequency volume (FV) chart. All patients failed to respond to treatment of their underlying disease and evening fluid restriction. Desmopressin 0.1 mg was administered orally at bedtime for 12 weeks. The participants completed a series of questionnaires on the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) sleep scale and FV chart before and after treatment. Results: The patient population had a mean age of 69.2 Â± 9.4 years (range: 61â81). The mean duration of symptoms was 61.2 Â± 45.1 months. Significant decreases were evident after desmopressin treatment in the number of nocturia episodes (3.63 Â± 1.61 to 2.00 Â± 1.13, p = 0.01), nocturnal urine volume (p = 0.01), nocturnal polyuria index (NPI) (p = 0.01), and nocturia index (NI) p = 0.01). Among the categories of the MOS sleep scale, sleep index (p = 0.003), sleep disturbance (p = 0.001), snoring (p = 0.028), and shortness of breath (p = 0.036) significantly changed, with a decreased number of nocturia episodes. Adverse events were mild. Conclusions: Desmopressin is an effective treatment for nocturnal polyuria in elderly women, where conservative treatment has failed. Sleep quality is also improved.

A German observational, multicenter, post-marketing surveillance study including men with LUTS/BPH and nocturia due to NP starting 3 months of desmopressin treatment. In total, 137 patients with a mean of 3.8 nocturnal voids (range 2-7) were included. Desmopressin significantly reduced the mean number of nocturnal voids by 53 %, mean IPSS nocturia question by 50 %, and the mean ratio of night/24-h urine volume by 39 % from baseline to endpoint. The hours of undisturbed sleep significantly increased by 74 %; 71 % of men reported about undisturbed sleep of â¥4 h at study end. Additionally, there was a significant reduction in the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire score, indicating a clinically relevant QoS improvement. This was associated with an improved HRQoL, as shown by a significant improvement in both the mean IPSS-QoL question by 43 % and mean ICIQ-N nocturia problem question by 53 %. Concomitant alpha-blocker use had no effect on the efficacy of desmopressin. The incidence of adverse events was low (2.2 %). Hyponatremia was not observed in any patient. The majority of patients and physicians rated the efficacy and tolerability of desmopressin as good/very good. Desmopressin is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for nocturia due to NP in patients with LUTS/BPH in daily practice under routine conditions.\n\nThe effectiveness of low-dose desmopressin in improving hypothermia-induced impairment of primary haemostasis under influence of aspirin - a randomized controlled trial.\n\nPubMed\n\nTsui, Pui Yee; Cheung, Chi Wai; Lee, Yvonne; Leung, Susan Wai Sum; Ng, Kwok Fu Jacobus\n\n2015-05-28\n\nMild hypothermia (34-35 Â°C) increases perioperative blood loss. Our previous studies showed that desmopressin could have in vitro beneficial effects on hypothermia-induced primary haemostasis impairment. In this study, we investigate the in vitro effects of desmopressin on hypothermia-induced primary haemostasis impairment under the influence of aspirin in healthy volunteers. Sixty healthy volunteers were randomly allocated to taking aspirin 100 mg or placebo for three days. On the sixth day blood samples were taken before and after the injection of desmopressin (1.5 microgram or 5 microgram) or normal saline subcutaneously. Measurements including Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA-100Â®) closure times, plasma von Willebrand Factor antigen, haemoglobin and platelet levels were made at 32 Â°C and 37 Â°C respectively. Collagen/epinephrine closure time (EPICT) was significantly prolonged by 21.13 % (95 %CI 2.34-39.74 %, pâ=â0.021) in aspirin group at 37 Â°C. While hypothermia alone prolonged both collagen/adenosine diphosphate (ADPCT) and EPICT by 17.63 % (95 %CI 13.5-20.85 %, pâ<â0.001) and 8.0 % (95 %CI 6.38-10.04 %, pâ=â0.024) respectively, addition of aspirin only further prolonged EPICT by 19.9 % (95 %CI 3.32-36.49 %, pâ=â0.013). In aspirin group, desmopressin 1.5 microgram and 5 microgram significantly reduced ADPCT to below baseline levels at 37 Â°C (pâ=â0.025 and <0.001 respectively), whereas reduction in EPICT was seen with desmopressin 5 microgram (p =0.008). The effect was less pronounced at 32 Â°C, with a significant reduction in EPICT obtained with a dosage of 5 microgram only (pâ=â0.011). It was shown that aspirin could further potentiate the hypothermia-induced closure time prolongations. Low dose desmopressin (1.5 microgram) reduced PFA-100Â® closure times towards baseline. A higher dosage (5 microgram) further reduced the closure times below baseline. Therefore low dose desmopressin (1.5 microgram) might have the potential to\n\n[The efficacy of desmopressin in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus after resection of chiasmo-sellar region tumors].\n\nPubMed\n\nAstaf'eva, L I\n\nCentral diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a neuroendocrine disease, the pathogenesis of which is associated with abnormal secretion of the antidiuretic hormone. One of the specific causes of CDI is neurosurgical resection of chiasmatic-sellar region tumors. to study the efficacy and safety of desmopressin in CDI patients after resection of chiasmatic-sellar region (CSR) tumors. Examination and treatment of patients were performed at a hospital for 7-14 days after surgery and then were continued after discharge. During treatment, the following tests were performed: a daily fluid intake and excretion volume, serum levels of sodium, potassium, and glucose twice a day, morning urine specific gravity, and Zimnitsky's test. Twenty-three patients with CSR tumors (11 craniopharyngiomas, 10 pituitary adenomas, 1 skull base chordoma, and 1 CSR meningioma) and CDI after neurosurgical treatment received desmopressin. On treatment, a thirst decrease, a reduced rate of diuresis, a reduced amount of excreted urine, and normalization of the sodium level were observed in all patients. In 12 patients (with pituitary adenoma, skull base chordoma, and meningioma) with transient CDI, desmopressin therapy was discontinued upon regression of symptoms 7-30 days after surgery. Eleven patients with permanent CDI continued to receive the drug at a dose of 1 to 4 doses per day. All patients well tolerated the drug without significant adverse effects. Therapy with desmopressin in the form of a nasal spray (vazomirin) in patients with transient and permanent CDI after resection CSR tumors of various histological nature (craniopharyngiomas, pituitary adenomas, meningiomas, and chordomas) was effective and safe in the early postoperative and long-term postoperative periods.\n\nDesmopressin is an Effective Treatment for Mixed Nocturia with Nocturnal Polyuria and Decreased Nocturnal Bladder Capacity\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLee, Hye Won; Choo, Myung-Soo; Lee, Jeong Gu; Park, Choal Hee; Paick, Jae-Seung; Lee, Jeong Zoo; Han, Deok Hyun; Park, Won Hee\n\n2010-01-01\n\nTo investigate the efficacy and safety of desmopressin in patients with mixed nocturia, Patients aged â¥18 yr with mixed nocturia (â¥2 voids/night and a nocturnal polyuria index [NPi] >33% and a nocturnal bladder capacity index [NBCi] >1) were recruited. The optimum dose of oral desmopressin was determined during a 3-week dose-titration period and the determined dose was maintained for 4 weeks. The efficacy was assessed by the frequency-volume charts and the sleep questionnaire. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a 50% or greater reduction in the number of nocturnal voids (NV) compared with baseline.

Without country or language restrictions, articles with high evidential value found in electronic databases were compared to our patients' data. After the literature review, three articles were included for systematic evaluation. Desmopressin was applied to the patients for the treatment of hyponatremia, volume contraction, and negative sodium balance caused by SIADH. However, it was not used for preventing re-bleeding. To prevent the development of this complication (SIADH), the use of desmopressin, an analogue of vasopressin, is important in routine clinical practice.\n\nThe effect of desmopressin on nocturnal polyuria, overnight weight loss, and morning postural hypotension in patients with autonomic failure.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMathias, C J; Fosbraey, P; da Costa, D F; Thornley, A; Bannister, R\n\n1986-01-01\n\nDay and night urine volume, morning and evening body weight, and supine and sitting blood pressure were measured in five patients with chronic autonomic failure who were not receiving treatment with drugs. All had nocturnal polyuria, overnight weight loss, and a pronounced postural fall in blood pressure, with lowest levels in the morning. Desmopressin (2-4 micrograms given intramuscularly at 8 pm) reduced nocturnal polyuria, diminished overnight weight loss, raised supine blood pressure, and reduced the postural fall, especially in the morning, when patients were often at their worst. Desmopressin may be a useful alternative to, or may supplement, other forms of treatment in some patients with autonomic failure.

The characteristics of four newborns with CDI treated with ODL were evaluated. Four newborns with polyuria and hypernatremia were included [male, 2 (50%); mean postnatal age, 19Â±17 days]. At the time of hypernatremia, the mean serum and urine osmolality values were 310Â±16 and 179Â±48 mOsm/kg, respectively. Antidiuretic hormone levels were undetectable (<0.5 pmol/L) in all cases. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed anatomical malformations in all cases. ODL (60 Î¼g/tablet) dissolved in water (3-5 mL) was initiated with a dose of 5 Î¼g/kg/day in two equal doses, together with limitation of water intake to avoid hyponatremia. Serum sodium levels returned to normal in a mean duration of 58Â±9.9 h with a mean decline rate of 0.37Â±0.1 mEq/L/h after desmopressin administration. Rehospitalization was required for one of the infants because of hypernatremia due to non-compliance. No episode of hyponatremia was encountered. Weight gain and growth of the infants were normal during the mean follow-up duration of 8.5Â±1 months. ODL appears to be practical and safe in the treatment of CDI during the first year of life.\n\nAtomoxetine ameliorates nocturnal enuresis with subclinical attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\n\nPubMed\n\nOhtomo, Yoshiyuki\n\n2017-02-01\n\nRecent studies have shown that incontinence and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) coexist and there is an interaction between them. The treatment for nocturnal enuresis (NE) and ADHD, however, has not been established. At the first visit to the outpatient clinic, physical examination and history taking were carried out in 265 new patients with NE. After excluding the possibility of comorbid ADHD and related disorders, patients with monosymptomatic NE (MNE) were treated with desmopressin and/or alarm, and those with non-monosymptomatic NE (NMNE) were treated with anti-cholinergics and/or alarm. This 12 week treatment did not work in 65 patients, and they were re-assessed for comorbid ADHD. A total of 24 were diagnosed with ADHD, and they were treated with atomoxetine (1.8 mg/kg/day) in addition to ongoing therapy for NE. After 8 weeks of atomoxetine, the average wet nights per months was significantly decreased: 18.5-4.6 in the MNE group (P = 0.001), and 22.1-12.4 in the NMNE group (P = 0.0251). Overall, atomoxetine was beneficial in 19 of 24 patients. Atomoxetine may be a suitable option for refractory NE with comorbid ADHD.

She was treated with levothyroxine and hydrocortisone and urged to take fluid to replace urine. She was scheduled to undergo ventricular drainage to relieve hydrocephalus prior to tumor resection. For the first surgery, desmopressin was not started and urine output reached 4,000 to 6,000 ml x day(-1), urine osmolality 64 mOsm x l(-1) and urine specific gravity 1.002. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane and maintained with propofol and remifentanil. Maintenance fluid was with acetated Ringer's solution and urine loss was replaced with 5% dextrose. Bradycardia and hypotension occurred after intubation, which was treated with volume load. Infusion volume was 750 ml and urine output was 1100 ml during 133 min of anesthesia. Postoperative day 1 nasal desmopressin was started. Ten days later, partial tumor resection was performed. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and fentanyl and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. Infusion volume was 610 ml, urine output 380 ml, and blood loss 151 ml during 344 min of anesthesia. Hemodynamic parameters were stable throughout the procedure. Pathology of the tumor was revealed to be germinoma. Bradycardia and hypotension experienced during the first surgery was suspected to be caused by preoperative hypovolemia brought by polyuria. Desmopressin was proved to be effective to treat excessive urine output and to maintain good perioperative water balance.\n\nComparison of nocturia response to desmopressin treatment in elderly men with and without nocturnal polyuria in real-life practice.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, S-L; Huang, Y-H; Hung, T-W; Ou, Y-C\n\n2016-05-01\n\nTo evaluate the safety and efficacy of low-dose desmopressin in elderly men with and without nocturnal polyuria (NP) in real-life practice.

We retrospectively analysed elderly men treated with adding desmopressin to current medications for nocturia according to category of the baseline nocturnal urine volume. The 48-h frequency volume chart (FVC), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and quality of life (QoL) were initially assessed and re-evaluated 12 weeks later. Serum sodium level was checked 1 week, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks after initiation of desmopressin therapy or suspected hyponatremia event. The mean change in numbers of nocturnal voids was evaluated for efficacy of treatment. A total of 136 patients were included with 55 in non-NP group and 81 in NP group. Hypertension was more common in NP group in regard of comorbidities. During treatment period, there were significant reductions of nocturnal voids from 4.22 Â± 1.38 to 2.31 Â± 0.98 (p < 0.001) in non-NP group and from 4.52 Â± 1.23 to 2.07 Â± 0.89 (p < 0.001) in NP group. The reduction in nocturnal voids was more significant in NP group (2.44 Â± 1.15 vs. 1.91 Â± 1.48, p = 0.003). The mean decrease in serum sodium levels were 3.89 Â± 1.22 mmol/l (p < 0.001) in non-NP group and 4.69 Â± 3.5 mmol/l (p < 0.001) in NP group at the extreme value. Long-term treatment with low-dose desmopressin is safe and effective for nocturia with or without NP in elderly patients with LUTS/BPH during real-life practice.

Children with enuresis can be embarassed by their condition and may believe that multiple doses of their nasal spray may bring about a rapid resolution. Water intoxication is an uncommon but serious adverse effect of treatment with intranasal DDAVP. These patients may present with seizure, mental state changes, or both. Basic management consists of stopping the drug, fluid restriction, and suppressive treatment for seizures. Recovery is usually rapid and complete. Administration of the nasal spray in children should be supervised by parents to prevent highly motivated children from accidental overdose. The risks of high fluid intake need to be carefully explained to both parents and children.\n\nA patient with Cushing disease lateralizing a pituitary adenoma by inferior petrosal sinus sampling using desmopressin: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nLim, Joo Hee; Kim, Soo Jung; Jung, Mo Kyung; Kim, Ki Eun; Kwon, Ah Reum; Chae, Hyun Wook; Kim, Duk Hee; Kim, Ho-Seong\n\n2016-03-01\n\nA 14-year-old girl was referred for evaluation of the etiology of Cushing syndrome. During the previous 2 years, she had experienced weight gain, secondary amenorrhea, growth retardation, and back pain. Random serum cortisol level, 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion, and overnight and low-dose dexamethasone suppression tests suggested Cushing syndrome. Midnight adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level and high-dose dexamethasone suppression test confirmed Cushing disease. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging was suspicious for microadenoma. To eliminate ectopic ACTH syndrome, and lateralize the pituitary tumor, inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) was performed by desmopressin use to stimulate ACTH. Finally, the patient was diagnosed with Cushing disease due to ACTH-secreting pituitary microadenoma, lateralized to the left side; subsequently underwent transsphenoidal surgery. Here we report a case of a 14-year-old girl diagnosed with Cushing disease with a pituitary tumor lateralized by IPSS using desmopressin, which is very rare in pediatric Cushing disease.\n\n[Monosymptomatic hyperthyroidism and TSH-producing adenoma: successful therapy with octreotide].\n\nPubMed\n\nMayinger, B; Axelos, D; Pavel, M; Hahn, E G; Hensen, J\n\n1999-01-29\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the central nervous system was performed on a 72-year-old woman who was hyperthyroid without suppression of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and had complained of a recent onset of headaches. MRI demonstrated a space-occupying lesion, 1 cm in diameter, in the anterior pituitary. The clinical symptoms were marked by a long-standing monosymptomatic illness of rapidly changing mood swings with depressive and manic phases. Endocrinological-biochemical tests showed hyperthyroidism (fT3 10.55 pmol/l and fT4 39 pmol/l) but no TSH suppression (TSH: 2.9 microU/ml). Octreotide scintigraphy documented an activity-rich area in the anterior pituitary and the upper anterior mediastinum. Mediastinal MRI revealed a 5 cm space-occupying mass lying on the right atrium. 131I scintigraphy identified the mass as a retrosternal goitre. As an operation on the anterior pituitary would have carried a high risk for the patient who was in a poor general condition and she had refused to be operated, treatment with octreotide, a long-acting somatostatin analogue, was initiated. This achieved a euthyroid state with partly suppressed TSH, and the patient's emotional swings ceased. If hyperthyroidism coexists with non-suppressed TSH levels, a TSH-producing hypophyseal adenoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis despite its rarity. Octreotide administration is an effective and safe treatment and is the method of choice, especially when there are contraindications to surgical resection of the anterior pituitary.\n\nOral desmopressin in central diabetes insipidus.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWestgren, U; WittstrÃ¶m, C; Harris, A S\n\n1986-01-01\n\nSeven paediatric patients with central diabetes insipidus were studied in an open dose ranging study in hospital followed by a six month study on an outpatient basis to assess the efficacy and safety of peroral administration of DDAVP (desmopressin) tablets. In the dose ranging study a dose dependent antidiuretic response was observed. The response to 12.5-50 mcg was, however, less effective in correcting baseline polyuria than were doses of 100 mcg and above. Patients were discharged from hospital on a preliminary dosage regimen ranging from 100 to 400 mcg three times daily. After an initial adjustment in dosage in three patients at one week follow up, all patients were stabilised on treatment with tablets and reported an adequate water turnover at six months. As with the intranasal route of administration dosage requirements varied from patient to patient, and a dose range rather than standard doses were required. A significant correlation, however, was found for the relation between previous intranasal and present oral daily dosage. No adverse reactions were reported. No clinically significant changes were noted in blood chemistry and urinalysis. All patients expressed a preference for the oral over existing intranasal treatment. Treatment with tablets offers a beneficial alternative to the intranasal route, particularly in patients with chronic rhinitis or impaired vision.

In the most aggressive cases of mammary cancer, surgery is not enough to warrant a favorable outcome, and adjuvant therapies are needed to improve the patientâs overall survival. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of two peptides on proliferation of a canine mammary cancer cell line derived from a simple carcinoma. The cell line CMT-U27 was grown in 96-well plates, at two cell densities (4âÃâ103 and 8âÃâ103 cells/well). Cultures were treated with oxytocin (OT) or desmopressin at five concentrations (10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000ânM). After 72âh of incubation, cell proliferation was determined by the MTT assay. Results showed that with 4âÃâ103 cells/well, OT at 50, 500, and 1000ânM was growth inhibitory for the cells, being statistically significant at 1000ânM. On the contrary, no antiproliferative effect was observed with 10 or 100ânM. At 8âÃâ103 cells/well, OT showed a significant antiproliferative effect only with the highest concentration (1000ânM). Desmopressin at 4âÃâ103 cells/well decreased cell viability at concentrations of 50, 100, 500, and 1000ânM (statistically significant with the highest concentration), while no effect was observed with 10ânM. With 8âÃâ103 cells/well, this peptide reduced cell growth at 100, 500, and 1000ânM. In conclusion, we suggest that these peptides may be potential and promising compounds for the treatment of dogs with simple carcinomas of the mammary gland. In vivo studies are required to confirm this hypothesis.

Four patients with CDI (all male, mean age 60.2 years) were included in this IRB-approved study. For (23)Na-imaging, a 3D density adapted, radial GRE-sequence (TE = 0.55 ms; TR = 120 ms; projections = 8,000; spatial resolution = 5 Ã 5 Ã 5 mm(3)) was used in combination with a dedicated (23)Na-coil and reference phantoms. The corticomedullary [(23)Na] gradient (in mmol/L/mm) was calculated pixel-by-pixel along a linear region-of-interest (ROI) spanning from the renal cortex in the direction of the medulla. Mean Â± SDs of [(23)Na] were calculated for each patient as well as for the entire group. Mean [(23)Na] increased along the corticomedullary gradient from the cortex (pre-DDAVP 38.0 Â± 6.3 mmol/L vs. post-DDAVP 30.7 Â± 3.5 mmol/L) to the medulla (pre-DDAVP 71.6 Â± 14.8 mmol/L vs. post-DDAVP 59.7 Â± 10.8 mmol/L). The overall mean decrease of [(23)Na] after DDAVP administration was 17.1 Â± 1.1 %. (23)Na-MRI with state-of-the-art techniques at 3T depicts the physiologic renal response to the administration of desmopressin in patients with central diabetes insipidus.\n\nThe effect of desmopressin on platelet aggregation defect in systemic amyloidosis: a preliminary report.\n\nPubMed\n\nDemiroÄlu, H; BariÅta, I; GÃ¼rsoy, M; Oymak, O; DÃ¼ndar, S\n\n1996-05-01\n\nSystemic amyloidosis may often be complicated with haemorrhagic tendency. The causes of this manifestation are factor deficiencies, hyperfibrinolysis and vasculopathy. In order to investigate the role of platelets, if any, we performed platelet aggregation tests with different aggregants in 10 patients with systemic amyloidosis due to familial Mediterranean fever and 10 healthy controls. Platelet aggregation was defective with different aggregants (ADP, epinephrine, collagen) in patients compared with controls. Platelet aggregation tests repeated after desmopressin (DDAVP) administration were normalized. These findings may suggest "
