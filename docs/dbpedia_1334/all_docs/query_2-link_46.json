        "text": "This email dialogue between Denise and myself is published as it changed the goals I started off with, from just enjoying a nostalgic trip down memory lane, to a serious case of being bitten by the “genealogy bug”.\n\nI consider the conversations that took place between Denise and myself invaluable. Her intimate knowledge of the area, its history and its people, and the enthusiasm to help us find our ancestors graves, made the difference between success and failure.\n\nApart from being the most gracious hostess, she is the best ambassador Haenertsburg can possibly have. Vivacious, well informed and pro-active – she truly makes every visitor want to come back again.\n\nWhat started as a search to find well positioned accommodation, lead me to a person that was eager to share are our adventure.\n\nIf/when I get to the point that I can focus on writing my book, I would love to do that in the rustic cottage by the river on their farm….\n\nJanuary 9\n\nConnie, As promised am getting back to you re accommodation. Both cottages are available and it depends on the space required. Legod is a two bed roomed cottage with open plan lounge and kitchen area and deck overlooking the river. It’s a lot more spacious and you cook inside. The log cabin on the other hand has a spectacular view of the small waterfall and pool, but consists of one open plan bedroom lounge area with en suite bathroom and outside but covered kitchen area. It’s not quite as spacious especially if you are having family or friends over to stay.\n\nWhere abouts did you grow up? We are situated on the Cheerio Road near Haenertsburg. I guess the area has changed as many more pine trees have been planted and so little of the beautiful grasslands remain. But it’s still a small village and still pretty rural in many ways. It’s a beautiful place and we love living here.\n\nDenise\n\n====================\n\nHi Denise\n\nMy late father’s Roets family owned farms along the Broederstroom river. My childhood memories seem to recall after passing Haenertsburg you go around the peak before the road heads towards the Ebenezer dam. The old road hugged the mountain on the left, and their property was on the right hand side, stretching to the river.\n\nThe main homestead was right in the bottom of the valley – had ancient fruit trees growing all the way to the river. Gran’s parents died when I was very young so this place went to the sons, Pieter and Johann Roets. They were all involved in the Forestry dept.\n\nShe married a Bezuidenhout, but he died quite early and she brought up the 4 children by herself – used to have a massive rondavel house on the hill above the homestead, and from there you had to walk down a very steep hill to reach her section of the river.\n\nAs the river carried on it became rockier and more fun(!) on the section next to hers. I think It belonged to an older sister before she sold it to a Mr. Worth or something like that. I was about 15 at the time so my memory is probably not clear, even though I have vivid recollections of our games played in the Blackwattle forests, climbing the fruit trees; I also recall the family graves on that hill before you descend to the homestead below. Some of those were very old and I guess after the place was sold fell into a bad way.\n\nI am very excited about the prospect of walking those misty paths again…. Mom used to call it “Misreen bult” because it was always damp….\n\nRegards\n\nConnie\n\n===============================\n\nSo interesting hearing about your family history. I am sure that there are still people like Gub Turner from Cheerio who will remember all these old families. I am just trying to work out which farm it is that you refer to on the Broederstroom. I know a Mr. Worms from Polekwane owns a farm on the Broederstroom which is quite close to Haenertsburg but I haven’t been there myself. It’s going to be a wonderful time for you exploring and remembering the times spent on the river. We have had so much fun as a family swimming in and enjoying different parts of this river – my kids have also been fortunate to have experienced this throughout their growing up years and we have awesome memories which have been made along the river.\n\nLet me know more or less the dates and will see what we can do. Just to mention that we don’t have electricity at any of our cottages but there are solar lights, gas stoves and water heaters as well as an old fashioned donkey boiler that gets lit by our staff every day. Paraffin lamps and candles add all the atmosphere needed. They are fully equipped with everything you need…only swimming towels are necessary if you want to take a dip in the river.\n\nWarm regards\n\nDenise.\n\n=============================\n\nThanks Denise that is very kind of you.\n\nIt seems I had my geography slightly wrong. My brother (who went to primary school in Haenertsburg while I was in high school in Pietersburg) last night pointed out that the small place I was referring to was actually Veekraal, not Haenertsburg. I don’t even know if Veekraal still exists – it used to have a gas station, maybe a post office, but I can’t see it on Google maps.\n\nAnd Mr. Worms may well be the neighbour – if still the original man he would be quite old by now, but his son could be closer to my age (i.e. a bit younger than very old(!)\n\n============================================\n\nConnie,\n\nWhere were you in boarding school? Was it at Haenertsburg Primary? I too went to boarding school in Polekwane from the tender age of 5 and a half…and just like you absolutely hated it! Perhaps only when I reached std 8 at the age of 14/15 did I begin to enjoy being with all my friends and finally accepted that I could possibly have a good time.\n\nMy grandmother – Ada Thompson – owned the farm Veekraal for many years then it was taken over by her son Reg Thompson. At its height it had a thriving general dealer shop run by the Moosa’s – a post office and a school for all the local kids. It was also the stop for the bus and many local people fetched goods that had been delivered by bus at Veekraal. My mother grew up there and her best friend was one of the Moosa daughters. It was during the apartheid years and it was as a result of the group areas act that the Moosa’s finally left Veekraal. I have often toyed with the idea of a book depicting the story of the two families, their vastly different backgrounds, their friendships kindled by living in this small remote outpost, eventually driven apart by the bizarre laws of the time. There are so many stories to be told on this Mountain and such interesting characters. It will be so interesting talking with you.\n\nDenise Tooley\n\n====================================\n\nOh Denise it is so wonderful reading your mail – I was meant to make contact with you!\n\nYou won’t believe this but my Gran and even parents, knew the Thompsons very well. Reg was married to Ina and I can recall their redhead son Ian (I think?). I seem to remember ‘n laatlammetjie daughter when they came to visit us later on in Pretoria. (I finished high school there, in 1963) I can just see we are going to share many stories!\n\nI am too excited and keep remembering little incidents – extraordinary how well one’s brain recall incidents 50 years later.\n\nIsn’t it amazing how small this world of ours really is? By the end of my holiday we may even discover our paths have crossed in the past.\n\nWhen were you in Pietersburg schools? As a very shy and introvert child I lived for my sport when I did not have my nose in my books. We played netball (or was it korfbal in those days?) against Capricorn and schools in neighbouring cities.\n\nSince moving to the Cape in 1969, [and as my ex husband’s family and friends were mostly English], I rarely spoke the Boeretaal. Now I look forward to brushing up my Afrikaans again.\n\nMy late father’s work resulted in us moving around a lot, so I attended many schools in my life. He was involved at the start of Turfloop University, Dap Naude as well as Ebenezer dams – so much happened in that period! I think I was at Pietersburg primary in std 3 and 4, then we went to Luvubu for a while, came back again – I lost track! Our house at Turfloop was probably one of the first to go up, in fact we “lived” in the garage section while the place was completed…and just look at it now……those rocky outcrops witnessed many hours of hide-and-seek, or Dassie hunting! I even owned a baby fox for a short spell till he became too interested in mom’s fowls…they never told me where he “found a home” and I did not want to ask. In Magoebaskloof our playground was the forest, streams, and the family farm. My two daughters have never been to the place, and now live abroad, so sadly they have no recollection of this magic place. I forgot – the youngest and her boyfriend plus Irish Terrier spent a few days in some log cabin a while ago (not yours) and fell in love with the jungle.\n\nThe Wolkberge “constant” if I can call it that. was the family farm, where my parents started their married life, and later on, we often visited my gran. The (Roets) family must have lived in the area since the late 1800’s as Gran was born in 1900 (I always thought the youngest child of a family of 5.) Most of the family were buried on the farm, except for my uncle who lost his life in Italy in the war. Dad is buried in Pietersburg. Sadly I have lost touch with the Roets children since moving to the Cape.\n\nMy gran’s old place as well as the main homestead was pretty close to Veekraal, but the property apparently is covered in pine trees these days – so sad as it used to be lovely grassland. Dad’s mother brought up 4 children on her own as her husband died when they were tiny, so the support came from her parents; she lived within walking distance from them. Dad was born in 1923 and as kids they walked (barefoot!) to Veekraal school; I so vividly remember him telling us how cold it was in winter. True or false, they apparently liked following the cows as the hot dung provided a bit of heat for frozen toes – as a young girl I could not believe my ears and still think he may have been pulling my leg. Times were tough though, so maybe not…\n\nI somehow have this image of coming around a hill just after passing Veekraal, then this vast valley opens up on your right. As the old road started descending, the Worms property came into view first on the right hand side; gran’s thatch roof rondavel was on a flattish plateau a bit further on, while a very steep, muddy road took you down to the main homestead in the bottom of the valley. The “highway” [probably as it still does], hugged the mountainside way above this old clay home. All the floors were made of a mixture of dung and earth – can still remember that smell after it was “touched up”!\n\nThe younger sister owned a bit of land a bit further down the road. She was married to a Mr. Senekal and they owned a pharmacy in Pietersburg for many years; only came to the farm some weekends. Her house was tucked away down a densely forested road, right on the banks of the river. She always had the most beautiful garden. As the river flows, her property was upstream, then came the main homestead, then my gran, and lastly the Worms place, all side by side.\n\nBy the time we moved to Pretoria my great grandparents had long passed on, and their 2 sons owned their land. Nobody lived there for some years but my dad used to take fruit to outlets in the area – the orchard was ancient but had such variety, and always was one of my favourite places. Gran stayed on the farm all by herself, and even when she became seriously ill did not want to leave her home. A young “pikkanien” brought milk, collected the eggs, and fetched a few buckets of water from the river, once or twice a week – none of those homes ever had electricity or running water. The long-drop toilet was tucked away in a patch of trees, among the chickens. If you needed to go during the night, you were allowed no 1 in a designated area: fear of the long-drop or noisy chickens usually made it possible to wait till the next day!\n\nWhen it became clear that there was something seriously wrong with my gran we fetched her, much against her will, and I will never forget that sad look on her face – she kept turning back till we rounded the corner close to Veekraal. She knew that was the last time she was going to see her home – a few months later the cancer took her from us. Dad felt he wanted to take her “home” himself, so I drove with him and the coffin – a scary experience for an impressionable young girl I must say, and true to form, the funeral took place on a very wet and misty day. It was a rather tough, slippery walk from the homestead up that steep hill to reach the cemetery….and I have never been back, as the two remaining children sold the land in the early sixties.\n\nI loved those homes. The rondavel was huge, and had a kitchen attached at one end, gran’s sleeping quarters at the other. We always slept in this open plan round area – and I recall some freezing mornings. The old homestead had high ceilings and a wrap-around stoep with gorgeous rambling roses growing everywhere – no problem growing anything in that place! We had many cozy evenings in front of the stove, and some scary nights. Flickering candle light, throwing strange patterns on the walls and high ceilings can invoke all sorts of fear…\n\nFrom what you wrote, Reg Thompson must have been your uncle? What happened to his children?\n\n=================================================\n\nJan 13\n\nConnie,\n\nHave so enjoyed reading your stories of what you remember from your youth of this area and was particularly interested in your knowledge of Veekraal. My Aunt Olive Kietzman would have been the perfect person to help me link this all up. She knew all the families in the area at the time you talk of. Unfortunately she passed on early last year. So many of the surnames you mention I too remember mentioned in passing over the years. It’s going to be an interesting return.\n\nBTW There are no roadworks on the Soekmekaar road anymore, it’s a really good road all the way to the T junction near Mooketsi. From Mooketsi through to Modjadjiskoof (about 18km) – not totally sure about but a while back they looked as if they were nearly done. Up Magoebaskloof all is ok – only a stop and go once you get up the mountain – all of the R71 between Polekwane and Tzaneen is being upgraded and they are working intensively around the Haenertsburg area at the moment building bridges etc.\n\nDenise\n\n===========================================\n\nJan 14\n\nThanks Connie. You know..I think it’s going to be best to locate which farm exactly when you get here. I know the names of most of the people who own farms along the river and I think Worms sold it to someone else recently. But when you get here we will check it out. Reg and Ina have both passed on. Long story which I will tell you when you get here but sadly Veekraal is really dilapidated and is owned by a cattle farmer who uses the shop and outbuildings as areas for the sheep and cattle…another long story..I look forward to all the talking. I am also going to invite my older brother (Neville Pirie) around (he is 14 years older than me) he lived with my mom and dad at Veekraal when they 1st started out. He remembers a lot more about the earlier years at Veekraal than I do. My dad was a Pirie and grew up on a farm called Monte Christi also about 6 to 8 km from Veekraal and also had to walk to Veekraal school each day or sometimes by donkey cart. My other brother David still owns this farm.\n\nWill try and find out who owns that particular stretch of the Broederstroom now. The Lands from Politsi bought a farm on the stretch just before that so could start there. If only my mom was still alive she would be able to tell all!\n\n=========================================\n\nFeb 12\n\nConnie\n\nAs I mentioned on the phone, aunt Eda was at school with your father. She would have loved to meet you while in Haenertsburg!\n\nEda was born Kietzman (sister-in-law to my mother’s sister Olive)- but married to Van Zweel who recalls your family.\n\nEda’s daughter Elisha is with her mom at the moment in Haenertsburg\n\nI know you will have a wonderful time meeting Eda.\n\nHope you enjoy the attached tribute to my Aunt Olive at her funeral.\n\nMy Aunt Olive…My mother’s sister, Mother to Les, Avie, Jeffey and Carin, wife to Fritz and grandmother to Diane, Bodo, Peter, Joyce, Callie, Oliver Jenny , Lauren and Michelle. What a privilege to be asked to speak about you today. As my mother’s sister you were a central part of my growing up years and there are so many ways that I will remember you. I remember your warmth, your caring, your love for gardening, flowers and nature, your kindness towards others and to animals, your wonderfully entertaining stories, your ability to laugh till the tears rolled down your face, your ability also to endure the toughest of times and equally shed a tear or two, the delicious smells of something always cooking in the kitchen, and always always…no matter what the happiness or tragedy… the saying …let s all have a nice cup of tea!. When I speak to people and tell them of your passing the words are always the same…she was a kind person, she will go straight to heaven, she was a saint, she gave so much to others. Even in your last years at Nazareth House in Durban, I hear how you entertained the others with your stories, a little joke here or there.\n\nAuntie olive, you were a born survivor. You are the last of my mother’s siblings to leave us. In fact you and your twin brother Uncle Raymond were the last two to leave…. Just as you came into the world together as twins, born prematurely in a time when incubators were not yet thought of in a rural area where there were no hospitals. Your mother, having lost 3 children just before giving birth to you found an unbelievable determination to save the two of you. How many times s did I listen in absolute fascination as you told the story of the next door neighbour giving Ouma a cow who had just had a calf so that she could feed you this first milk full of protein. Of how she kept you in a box with glass bottles filled with warm water so you would not get cold. How she fed you even though you were too weak to suck. You survived and went on to live to 92…not quite the 100 that you were hoping for Aunt… but still a fine innings.\n\nYou were born on this mountain in 1918 and your stories of your youth and growing up on first Rustfontein farm, with your mother Ada and father Alan Douglas and then later on Veekraal were always so entertaining. A time long before blackberries and wireless, where a trip to what was then Pietersburg by ox wagon took two full days, where local children walked miles to get to and from Veekraal school often without any shoes and where people also thought nothing of walking half a day to get to get to the Veekraal tennis parties, sleep over and walk half a day back again.\n\nThese were pioneering days, times were tough and people were poor but always you said, a plan was made to help another. These were the days before pine trees when the landscape was still covered with fields of flowers and wild grasses. You used to tell me how you loved to pick bunches of wild flowers.\n\nYour life was not always easy my Aunt, as a young girl you had to shoulder responsibility at an early age where you worked in the Veekraal post office at the tender age of 14. At the age of 17 the war broke out and you told me how you and 2 of the Collins girls took first the railway bus then the train all the way to Pretoria and joined the army. You told me how you worked in the Ciphers section and became a 2nd lieutenant. I think it was while working in Pretoria that you met Fritz who came from this area. The two of you got married and returned to work on a farm in the Lowveld for your older brother Donsie. Enough money was made for you to buy your own Lowveld farm and then a series of farms and small holdings in the Haenertsburg area.\n\nMost of my vivid memories are of the time you stayed on the farm Palmietfontein. It was here that we visited and watched how the geese were plucked for down pillows, where Jams cooked continuously on the stove, where my mom and you continually swopped recipes for “Ann s chocolate cake” or “Chickens Lemon meringues or “Ina s mince pie s”. Where the two of you would pop off to garden club bearing the testing’s of these latest recipes. This was also the place where Ouma spent her last days, and where you experienced the greatest tragedy of all…the loss of your last born child Carin.\n\nIn your life you took care of so many old people…first there was Ouma – my grandmother – who lived to be 103. But I am told, before this you also helped to help Ouma to nurse your own father until his death. Then there was Fritzes father, Oupa Keitzman then Ouma Kietzman, Aunt Rosie, Mrs Jones, Uncle Donsie and Aunt Annie. I know that all of the people that were closest to these old people tell of your unbelievable patience, your care, your love and kindness. You devoted so much of your time to make the last years of these people comfortable and allowed them to die with dignity. You also helped my own mother when she was so terribly sick with cancer, nursing and feeding her till she had to be hospitalized. There are so many of us that want to say thank you for this!\n\nYou loved this mountain Aunt and always said that you wanted to be brought back here to be laid to rest. One of my favourite things was to walk with you through the Haenertsburg cemetery while you related the stories of the people who had gone before. We would stop at each family site and you would ponder a bit before telling some fantastic story of how they lived their lives, who they had married and always a bit of juicy detail…half whispered…so no one else might hear . We are so happy that you have come home. We celebrate your life Aunt….Now it is we that should continue the stories, tell the history and walk though the graveyard relating the history of the characters that have gone before us. Now we will stop at your grave and tell your story….and what an incredible story that is!\n\nAvril has asked me to please thank her daughter Diane for all her help in sorting out the funeral arrangements. She would also like to thank Frank and Diane for always being there for her.\n\n====================================================\n\nFeb 12\n\nThanks Denise – and what a lovely tribute to a fantastic lady! In sharing our “link” to the past we are able to not only remember them, but also to ensure they are not forgotten. We simply have to put pen to paper to allow our kids to share these wonderful stories.\n\nThere is a common thread in our pasts – and even though I remember (and have experienced!) the financial struggles those pioneers endured, I envy them the loyal friends and good times they had. Those good, salt of the earth people are still living in the mountains, but here in the big cities, sadly, life is so different.\n\nI will phone aunt Eda’s daughter tomorrow, and will do my utmost to set up a meeting in the near future. My late brother’s son lives in Pta so I can always stay with them. Martin is very keen to learn more about his ancestors and I know he will be a willing chauffeur!\n\nMy “journey of discovery” has been followed by a few friends with great excitement, so there is added motivation to fill in a few more gaps.\n\nThe danger is that by comparison my other work is less tempting…\n\nThanks so much for all the bits and pieces that is adding to this lovely story.\n\nJust remembered something that made me wonder (my brain is overactive after your call!)\n\nMy cousin, daughter of my father’s sister, is called Olivia – and this is not a family name. Won’t be surprised one bit if she was named after your aunt! We always knew her as Via, but as I am trying to track down family and concentrating on full names, this thought popped up…\n\nMy aunt would have been born around 1921 and this daughter born in early 1940’s.\n\n=======================================================\n\nSo interesting Connie! My aunt was born in 1918 and my mom in 1920. Shoo..my head is also spinning and I am now really wanting to follow up on the Moosa family at Veekraal as the more I hear about them the more I realise what a central role they paid in this community. Would love also to trace their heritage and how they came to be in Haenertsburg and once they left what happened. The story continues…\n\n=====================================================\n\nCape Town, Match 2013.\n\nGood morning early bird – I can just visualize the view that greets you this time of day.\n\nI hope you can track down the Moosa family, as those girls will add a different dimension to this story. The name is quite popular so it may be harder to achieve e g in Louis Trichardt I saw it among a group of legal eagles.\n\nYou and I can probably do a joint project on this(!)\n\n===========================================================\n\nMarch 5\n\nDear Denise\n\nHow time flies – can’t believe it is nearly a month since we spent such a lovely time with you. So much has been happening in between, I still have not been able to settle back into my working routine. If I ever will…but life will never be the same, that much I know.\n\nI have not been able to meet your aunt Eda as yet, as I am eager to put together a few special photos and stories before I do, but we have chatted, and my plans are all coming together.\n\nI have reconnected with numerous descendants and we chat all the time. I also discovered that one of the relatives has done an amazing amount of research into the genealogy of the Roets family, who can be traced right back to the Great Trek and beyond (Germany), when they were known as “Ruts”.\n\nShe does not have access to computers, so we are working on this together, to hopefully publish a family tree link in my blog. She has provided reams of information obtained from Gisa, and I will be heading there soon to do my bit of micro-fisching on the Bezuidenhout line. My ongoing interest is however to record not only their family lines, but the story behind the story; where they lived and apparently, left quite a few memories and even legacies.\n\nOne of the Roets grandsons (he has the family name) still has some very old and valuable photos, and I want to take them along when I meet Eda. I am sure she will recognize the people! Taken around 1926/7 it shows the great grandparents with their children and spouses, plus a few of the grandchildren including my late father.\n\nThere are off course some sad stories and I am quite prepared to discover a few skeletons in the cupboard, but that makes this very real. Times were tough and these people lived in politically volatile times. I believe the old man was quite a character – trained the horses and zebras(?) used for the postal coach and was a “Rapportryer” during the war – don’t know the English term for that.\n\nI have just been told to try and obtain the book on the history of Pietersburg, written by a famous Haenertsburg resident, Proff Louis Changuion (sadly it seems to be out of print). I have been told the Roets family owned vast pieces of land (including Doornkraal, Deutschland, Kalkbank, Welverdiend, Swartpan, Veekraal) stretching all the way to Pietersburg and even Dendron – and this may explain why one of the daughters lived on the other side of Pietersburg, or how my father met my mother, as she lived in Dendron. I believe Annandale was a piece of land great great grandpa donated to the town, and it was named after his wife Anna. I have not read the book, but am told this information is correct.\n\nI have also learnt that Dap Naude, the family lawyer, bought my granny’s piece of land.\n\nIt has been suggested that we arrange a reunion as so few of us know all these incredible stories. Obviously a venue will be the challenge, but then the thought struck me – what better place to do this than near Veekraal, near the Kopje Alleen homestead. This may be a crazy idea, but who knows, it may be possible…. So many of the present day inhabitants were closely connected to the family, it may lead to a proper Boerejol! What an event this could be. But they may not all share my enthusiasm…\n\n========================================\n\nMar 11\n\nMy late mother always told us that Mara Prinsloo (popular Afrikaans fiction writer) was related to my late Father. Aunt Eda knew her and told me she was a van der Merwe girl, and they lived in your original old house, at the “events centre”. What a small world. I still don’t know how this all fits into the family tree….\n\nMar 16\n\nHi Denise,\n\nWhen you have a bit if free time and if you are able to, can you please let me know the name of the Van der Merwe that owned your farm in the past? And do you have any contact with any of their children/grandchildren?\n\nThe connection as I can see it, is that my great grandfather had a sister, Getruida Aletta Roets (26 Jan 1875) who married Izaak Jacobus van der Merwe.\n\nAccording to Aunt Eda her childhood friend, the author Mara (Hester Sophia) Prinsloo (first marriage to a van der Linde) was a van der Merwe girl. If there is a family graveyard on the farm they will probably be buried there?\n\nSorry to bug you but these bits of info are crucial in tracking down the missing links. Mara is apparently in frail care in Pretoria, but I have been unable to find out exactly where she is. Aunt Eda is also eager to know, and if we can get in touch with one of her children etc I hope to look her up when I meet Eda in three weeks time.\n\n(Author’s note: This information turned out to be incorrect as she had died a few years ago)\n\n======================================================\n\nMar 17\n\nHi Commie\n\nSo sorry about the lack of communication..it has been busy…we haven’t had our wellness retreat yet…that is on the 10-14 April, but have been busy with a whole lot of other stuff.\n\nIts so exciting to hear all the links you have been able to make between the families on the mountain. I knew the Van der Lindes and the van der Merwes were linked somehow. The original owner of this farm was Gert Van der Merwe. The family graveyard is on our farm and I will go and have a look at the gravestones today and make a note of the names and send these through to you. A while ago (maybe 6 years ago) some family came to the farm to clean up the graveyard. I know one of the men was involved in television and may have been a son of Mara?\n\nSo happy you have connected with Aunt Eda … She is a wonderful source of information…\n\nLots of love that side, and I will send those names through later today.\n\nDenise.\n\nThanks Denise much appreciated. In the end we are all connected(!) It is quite amazing when I look at the Roets side-branches how many of the Haenertsburg names come through.\n\nMar 18\n\nGRAVES INFO:\n\nGerhardus van der Merwe born Nov 1887 died 1946. Then…there were two young children…Hester Sophia v d Merwe born 31 May 1917 and died 28 Oct 1923 and Philip Johannes Jacobus v d Merwe. Born 21 Dec 1919 and died 9 Nov 1923. Then one other marked grave…that of Harry Charles Whiley. Born 1857 and died 1937. May have been the father in law? Those are the only marked graves … On Gerts grave it says a message and then van u wagtende eggenote, Sophia en kinders. . So obviously Sophia was the wife?\n\nI spent most of my childhood in very rural, Afrikaans areas.\n\nMost of my mother’s family were farmers (rather wealthy ones I may add!) living in the Dendron area, while my father’s only sister lived in Pretoria.\n\nI never knew my grandfathers, as Hannes Bezuidenhout died when his children were all under 10, and on the maternal side grandfather Potgieter died when I was barely two years old. My grandmothers had totally opposite personalities: Ouma Pot was a descendent from the well respected Lang Hans Janse Van Rensburg family, financially independent and a true matriarch. By contrast Ouma Bez was a very approachable, down to earth little bird of a woman, toughened by the hard life of a single mother raising 4 young children in very difficult circumstances.\n\nTime shared with them could not be more different: when we visited Ouma Pot there were numerous rules you had to obey: you ate every scrap of food on your plate including the dreaded spinach; you never entered the “voorkamer” as that had to remain spotlessly clean in case visitors arrived. Pets never entered the house, and heaven help you if you ever broke or damaged anything.\n\nIn stark contrast, time spent on Ouma Bez’s farm was one huge adventure and we could not wait to get there. Not only were there a large number of pets around, the forested area close to her dwelling allowed us to let our imagination go wild. Cowboys and crooks, Robinson Crusoe, The three Bears and Rooikappie or Tarzan all lived down there just waiting for us to enter their magical world. Dad even joined us at times, showing us how to build a “foefie slide” or demonstrated how you could use your body weight to bend young black wattle trees till you could swing down to the ground. Ouma’s house consisted of a massive thatch roofed rondavel with a kitchen added at one end, and her bedroom at the other. I recall a very interesting smell of clay and cow dung, caused by the mixture the maid used to patch up the rough earth floor from time to time. When we lay in bed (i.e. on a large mattress on the floor!) you could watch the mysterious reflections caused by flickering candle light hopping from beam to beam high above our heads.\n\nShe used to own a real gramophone and some vinyl records, and we took turns, literally, to create music. Dad was always a keen musician, and often entertained us on his piano accordion. I inherited my love of music from him but he in turn was just another one of the Roets descendents that could play any instrument without formal training.\n\nI have touched on just a few of the magical moments spent on the “Berg.” Sadly, after Ouma Bez passed away in 1963 her portion of the farm Welverdiend was sold. I started my university education the following year, got married to a Capetonian in 1969, and never went back again. Whether it is a sign of old age creeping up on me, or just circumstances that revived my childhood memories in recent years, fact remains I have been dreaming of going back at least once before I die. This urge became stronger and stronger, and after discussing the possibility with my siblings Pieter and Janette, we decided to spend a few days in that area.\n\nOnce that decision was made I started looking at accommodation options as close to the farm as possible. Now it must be remembered that my last visit happened 50 years ago in sad circumstances. As a child I never really took note of the route travelled, so I had to rely on some distant memories to try and locate the place.\n\nI could not even recall the name of the farm, but I did remember names like Haenertsburg, Veekraal, Magoebaskloof. I had an impression of this family graveyard close to the main homestead, and for directions, my childhood vision of the sequence of contours and the road we used to get to the place. Some family names stuck, also the name of the neighbour that bought a portion of the farm. This proved to be a key fact as this search unfolded.\n\nAs a result of an apprenticeship he did after school my dad always worked in the building industry. A brilliant if difficult foreman/inspector of work, he did not tolerate shoddy work. Maybe that is why I am so hard to please!\n\nDuring the period 1958 – 59 he was responsible for the projects at Turfloop University (known as University of the North these days) as well as the Dap Naude and Ebenezer dams. When we lived on those sites there was no University, no dams, and seeing those established structures 55 years later, made me feel very proud of his achievements.\n\n“Armed” with these memories my aim was to find accommodation near the Broederstroom river at the points were these two dams are situated – I remembered the family farm was very close to this.\n\nGoogle maps is a wonderful tool to locate places, but I soon discovered via the aerial image that the area had changed dramatically since 1963. What used to be rolling grassland hills are now a series of identical looking pine-forested valleys. It is almost impossible to see the buildings in amongst the trees, let alone find a family graveyard…\n\nThroughout my search however it was as if something was leading me to the right people, helping me make the right decisions to achieve this goal of finding my roots. Even my choice for a place to use as home base proved to be inspirational. On a satellite map it appeared to be very close to our old family farm, situated on the banks of the same Broederstroom river. However it must be said the location of Zwakala Retreat alone would not have been enough to find the graveyard or even the farm. Some instinct, good luck and a lady with lot of local know-how, did the trick.\n\nThe owner (Denise Toolley) and I started corresponding about the accommodation and it turned into chats about the reason for my visit. Once we discovered common ground she got caught up in my enthusiasm, providing invaluable leads and bits of information. I plan to post our emails in another article so the reader can see how this friendship developed.\n\nAt that stage I had not seen my younger sister Janette (living in Louis Trichardt) and remaining brother Pieter (based in Nylstroom) for some time, so I suggested that we use this as an opportunity to spend a few days together, reminiscing about our childhood while we all go grave hunting together.\n\nI flew to Pietersburg, spent a few days with Janette and arranged to meet Pieter and his wife Lettie at Zwakala River Retreat. Our vivacious hostess Denise immediately offered her assistance to help in our journey of discovery.\n\nI mentioned earlier that the sale of property to a neighbour (Worth?) proved to be a key element in this search.\n\nThe farm Welverdiend bordered on the Broederstroom river, and after the great grandfather’s death, was subdivided among 4 children.\n\nThe Roets owners in “downstream sequence” were:\n\n1. Portion 1 – My dad’s aunt Cox Senekal\n\n2. Portion 2 – the original homestead, owned by eldest son Piet Roets\n\n3. Portion 3 – my granny, Annie Bezuidenhout\n\n4. Portion 4 – youngest son – Adriaan Roets – sold to Mr. Worms.\n\nWhen I mentioned the name “Worth” to Denise it did not ring a bell, but she mentioned that she knows of a Mr. Worms who owns land on the river. As soon as she uttered his name I could confirm it was the right person. I recalled how as kids we joked about a “creepy crawly” surname like that.\n\nWe set out early the next day to find this property, but bearing in mind the only reason we ever went to that portion of Welverdiend was to swim, (while it still belonged to one of the Roets children) I had reservations about identifying a rock pool in a river!\n\nWhen we reached the place it did look very familiar, but I was not 100% sure. After all, this is an ever changing piece of nature, where as children, we swam 50 years ago….. A bit unsure, we discussed our next options.\n\nI described the house of aunt Cox to Denise – and to my astonishment she told me her friend’s house fits the description! It was just upstream from where we were standing, and quickly confirmed that we were on the right track. Having found portions no 1 and 4, it was relatively simple to find the two sections in between. Many hours later we figured out that the road we used to reach the Worms place went right past the graveyard.\n\nThe next stop had to be the old homestead. On our way back we caught sight of this steep rooftop among the trees, which made Pieter and I shout excitedly “this is the place”! If it had not been for the dense trees we would have seen it on the way down even before reaching the Worms rock-pool, but coming from a different direction provided a better view.\n\nThe original house/roof is still standing but it has been renovated extensively. It is surrounded by gorgeous landscaped gardens, and ornamental lakes have replaced the ancient fruit orchard. Seeing the place in this splendid setting made me feel very happy. Times were very tough in the 1950’s when great grandfather Roets stayed there, and they planted only the bare essentials. Lawns were unheard of – any grassland was considered cattle grazing area!\n\nInitially the owner was a bit evasive about the cemetery and denied having any knowledge. He probably thought these people are going to present an ancestral claim to the land(!) In time though he started telling us about a relative that came looking for the graves a few years before, while he was away on holiday. He claimed to have come across some very neglected headstones in the forest, but could not recall the position.\n\nThat however did not matter to me – once I had my bearings at the house I knew exactly which direction to go!\n\nThe group went off in different directions while I headed straight into the forested area next to the road we had travelled a bit earlier. The undergrowth is very sparse, as the dappled light only allows certain plants to survive. But after walking for about 2 minutes I saw what looked like a hedge in front of me. My heart started racing as I could feel a presence, and when I peeped over the top of this “hedge” I could see the graves.\n\nThe hedge was formed where jungle creepers covered the wire fencing, and completely hid it from view.\n\nI did not call out to the others immediately, but found the gate and entered. That feeling of being at home cannot be adequately described. I sat down next to granny Bez’s grave and could so clearly recall her holding my hand while we went collecting eggs. Don’t ask me what went through my mind at that moment, but I truly felt she was communicating with me.\n\nIt was time to call the others, and from my voice they knew I had found the place. We spent some time studying the names on graves, recorded the detail and took some photos. It was decided that we will come back next day, put some (indigenous) flowers on the graves and tidy up a bit. I feel very strongly that I don’t want to change the idyllic setting, and only want to remove the rotten branches that covered the graves. It is like a silent little island in the middle of this forest, and only the sound of wind in the trees can be heard.\n\nWhile recording the names and detail on the headstones we discovered some information: the fact that there was an Oupa Hannes; that my father lost another little sister aged 2. There was an unmarked grave that has to be that of my father’s youngest brother. One lonely little grave belongs to the brother of my second cousin Eddie Roets: we always thought he was an only child (which he was in practice, as little Pieter died before Eddie was born).\n\nAfter I got back to Cape Town I wanted to know more about my grandfather’s family. Nobody ever mentioned his name, as he died so long ago my father and his family hardly knew him. But to my way of thinking, this man would have had a family – why did we never meet any of them? To find out who they were, I would have to do some research, and that is off course another topic for another day.\n\nThe family members (nephews and nieces) that did not accompany us this time was off course all very curious to find out what happened, so I posted numerous photos on Face book. Janette’s daughter Nicolene wrote back quite excitedly after seeing those of the graveyard, pointing out the numerous round “bubbles” hovering around the headstones and in the trees. I am no fundi on this topic so will refrain from commenting on her statement, but she sees those as “orbs”, indicating a lot of spiritual activity. All I can add is to repeat my comment above, that long before any photos were taken or published, I experienced a feeling like nothing I had ever felt before."
