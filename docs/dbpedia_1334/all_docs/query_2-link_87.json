We both have an affinity to all things that are unconventional, covered in tattoos and piercings and we adore all things vintage. After only two months we became engaged and I had his name tattooed on me as a symbol of my lifelong dedication to making the world rock together!”\n\nMona & Dewald wanted a fun, simple and personal wedding. They basically created a big party for all their friends and family and kept it as non-weddingy as possible. The pastor even arrived for the ceremony on a Harley Davidson! The bride’s Mother is a dressmaker so she obviously made Mona’s dress. She wanted something offbeat, something unique and something completely different to a traditional wedding dress.”We combined our avant-garde taste gave birth to sexiest little wedding tutu – I felt like a princess!” concluded the bride.\n\nHuge thanks to Mona & Dewald for sharing their fab wedding today!"
