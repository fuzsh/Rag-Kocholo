        "text": "Growing up in a rural area with limited career opportunities, I discovered my passion early in life by serving my large family in the kitchen and hosting family gatherings. There’s nothing more rewarding to me than seeing the joy on people’s faces when I serve them—it’s always been my greatest satisfaction. This love for hospitality has been the driving force behind my journey, inspiring me to pursue a career dedicated to creating memorable experiences for others.\n\nAfter completing matric, I chose to pursue my passion by enrolling in the Diploma in Hospitality Management at Durban University of Technology. Despite facing significant challenges, I remained committed and determined to reach my goals.

I firmly believe the hospitality industry holds the key to the future, offering limitless opportunities for growth and innovation. The skills and experiences I’ve gained empower me to inspire and guide the next generation of hospitality professionals.\n\nI have recently joined Capital Hotel School as a Marketing Assistant.

Her journey began when she pursued her studies in Consumer Science, specializing in Hospitality Management at the University of Pretoria.\n\nWhile immersing herself in the world of academia, Suzanne embraced hands-on experiences that shaped her culinary abilities. As a food assistant for Vrouekeur magazine, she played a vital role in the creation of numerous cookbooks and weekly issues, honing her skills and showcasing her culinary creativity.\n\nIn 2009, Suzanne’s career took a delightful turn as she assumed the position of head pastry chef at 18th Avenue Bakery Café in Rietondale, where her delectable creations delighted her patrons.

They worked together at Lynton Hall, a highly regarded establishment in Pennington, upon which Tyrow eventually became the Executive Chef and took over the leadership role in the kitchen.\n\nTyrow expanded his culinary horizons and ventured abroad to work in Ghana, which exposed him to an array of new flavours, ingredients, and cooking techniques. His international adventures thereafter continued to the United States, where he held significant positions in renowned establishments, firstly as an Executive Sous Chef at Laurel Links Country Club located in Long Island and later served as an Executive Sous Chef at Mar-A-Lago Country Club, a prestigious club owned by Donald Trump in Palm Beach, Florida known for its upscale dining experiences.\n\nTyrow takes pride in his culinary journey, which showcases a diverse range of skills and a commitment to excellence in the culinary arts.
