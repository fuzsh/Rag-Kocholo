He writes a suicide note to his wife and is about to gas himself in his car in the garage, when he switches on the car radio. The Elvis Presley song he hears does more than take him back 30 years – it recalls an event in his childhood that changed his life forever. Abandoning – for the moment – the idea of suicide, he drives the 200 kilometre journey to the town in which he grew up, to a lamp post opposite the ex-Carlton Bioscope in Witbank, there to retrace his life, to try to find out what went wrong, how it went wrong, and – perhaps most importantly – why it went wrong…\n\nCan we change our own destinies…? “Elvis” du Pisanie is about to find out…\n\n“A milestone for South African Theatre…!”\n\n(Humphrey Tyler SUNDAY TRIBUNE)\n\n“He mesmerises his audience…! Not to be missed…!”\n\n(Garalt McLiam THE STAR)\n\n“The Great South African Novel come to life onstage…!”\n\n“Profound poetry… Equal to anything by Beckett or Pinter…!”\n\n“Nothing less than the new Bosman… what a performance, what a play…!”\n\n(Iain MacDonald THE ARGUS)\n\n“Buy, beg or steal but get your hands on a ticket for this magnificent play…!”\n\n(Billy Suter NATAL MERCURY)\n\n“A vigorous, robust tour de force… a memorable evening of theatre…!”\n\n(Terry Herbst EASTERN PROVINCE HERALD)\n\n“A tale – fragile and beautiful as blown glass – of dreams lost and found…”\n\n(Brenda van Rooyen PRETORIA NEWS)\n\nThe Return of Elvis du Pisanie – first performed in July, 1992 – has the distinction of having won more awards (in a single year) than any other play in the history of South African Theatre – 1993 Vita, Fleur du Cap and Dalro Awards included Best New South African Play, Best Actor, Best Production, Best Director – as well as The Star “Tonight”/IGI Life Vita Award for Comedy. It has also been presented – by invitation – in Washington DC and Chicago, USA.\n\nJOHANNESBURG\n\nPieter Toerien’s Montecasino Theatre\n\nLimited 2-week season ONLY: 10 May – 26 May\n\nTickets at Webtickets and Theatre Box Office (011) 511 1988.\n\nJHB BOOK HERE!\n\nCAPE TOWN\n\nPieter Toerien’s Theatre On The Bay\n\n30 May – 15 June\n\nTickets at Webtickets and Theatre Box Office (021) 438-3301.\n\nCPT BOOK HERE!\n\nhttps://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/EDP-Poster-2024-V3-web-scaled.jpeg 2560 1810 Mark Monte https://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ptp-black-logo.svg Mark Monte2024-02-28 16:02:312024-06-18 08:56:49Paul Slabolepszy's THE RETURN OF ELVIS DU PISANIE – Jo’burg & Cape Town 2024\n\nBianca Amato is currently in Cape Town rehearsing ‘LUNGS’ ahead of its run at Pieter Toerien’s Theatre On The Bay from 7 – 24 February, 2024.\n\n‘LUNGS’ is a funny, off-kilter love story, that explores the debate around the environmental impact of having children in today’s world, a world that is becoming more and more focussed on sustainable living.\n\nDean Roberts.\n\n30 January, 2024.\n\nDR: You last appeared on our stages in Pieter Toerien’s 2001 production of ‘Proof’, starring Michael Atkinson. Since then you have worked extensively overseas – how does it feel to be home again?\n\nBA: Shew! Such a wild mix of emotions! I returned for family life and that has been very special. The process of building up a similar work life to the one I experienced in the US has begun and I feel very excited by it. It hasn’t come easy, what with having a baby and then COVID in the middle of it all. But the challenges that I’ve had make it all the sweeter now, as it gains momentum.\n\nDR: A performing highlight that you wish to share?\n\nBA: Do I have to pick just one? Working with Jack O’ Brien and Tom Stoppard in the Coast of Utopia trilogy at Lincoln Centre. All the Shakespeare I got to do in NYC. The Importance of Being Earnest directed by Sir Peter Hall.\n\nPlaying Amanda in Private Lives directed by Maria Aitken. Playing Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice and Eliza Doolittle in Pygmalion at the wonderful Guthrie Theatre. Playing opposite Bill Irwin, sharing a stage with Billy Crudup, Ethan Hawke, Martha Plimpton, David Harbour, Lynn Redgrave, Miriam Margolyes. Being directed by Athol Fugard in NYC. I have been beyond lucky.\n\nDR: A production that posed unique challenges, and how you overcame them?\n\nBA: Ha! I had to play a ballerina in Mr.Fox: a Rumination. A play by Bill Irwin about a famous clown in 19th century New York City. I played the clown’s wife and I had to learn ballet in 3 weeks. Faking it obviously, not on pointe at all. I had to work VERY HARD to become a little bit graceful.\n\nDR: South African audiences will of course remember you as Philippa De Villiers in Isidingo, which do you prefer stage or screen?\n\nBA: Stage. I won’t say no to screen, but ja, Stage.\n\nDR: Can you tell me about ‘LUNGS’, and how you came across the play?\n\nBA: ‘LUNGS’ is really a peek into a private conversation that spans 40 years. It is both a love story and a searing look at where we are now, us little humans. It is brave, probing, funny, and achingly poignant. It is a play that has come into its time a decade after it was written – it’s actually quite unsettling to see how much more relevant it is now, given the current climate crisis. I read it in 2018. It spoke to me. I could hear it. Duncan Macmillan writes in a very particular way and I feel very connected to it.\n\n[LINK] Read more on Playwright Duncan Macmillan and how ‘LUNGS’ came to be.\n\nDR: What attracts you to this project?\n\nBA: The style of it – it’s vital and smart and potent and demands virtuosity from its performers. The humanity of it. The humor. The joy of it! It’s a rollercoaster ride, and it’s such a great piece for two young actors to revel in. Jazzara and Sanda are just extraordinary – I cannot wait for people to fall in love with them.\n\nDR: How do you approach casting a play – this play in particular?\n\nBA: Very carefully! I saw many people, many lovely performers, but I was looking for two people who have an instinct about the essence of the characters, as well as an understanding of what is needed from them stylistically. And most importantly, they need to have chemistry with each other. The piece is very intimate and asks for vulnerability and connection.\n\nDR: How do you collaborate with actors, to bring about their best performances?\n\nBA: Every actor is unique, and their process is too. Respecting this is very important to me. But the most important thing, especially when you have a good play on your hands, is to honor the text. To really investigate together, to be exacting and specific. If we can do that together, find each other in the investigation, put the text first, and play, play, play, while always staying true to the intentions of the writer, we’ll be on our way.\n\nDR: What do you wish the audiences to take away from this experience?\n\nBA: I hope they feel that they have been given a gift, that they have been allowed to eavesdrop on two people’s lives, and that they feel richer for it. I want them to have a good laugh and a good cry. And perhaps, who knows, maybe they will feel galvanised to help tackle the climate crisis in some personal way? At the very least, recycle!\n\nDR: You have formed your new production company, The Quickening Theatre Company. How did this come about, and what sort of projects are you looking at producing in future?\n\nBA: In South Africa you can’t just wait for the phone to ring. We as artists have to forge ahead and make our own work. I have been circling around the idea of creating my own theatre company for a few years now, but the thought of doing it alone was daunting. I met Kensiwe Tshabalala last year, and we quickly realized we could make a really great team. The Quickening is dedicated to producing contemporary plays that excite South African audiences, and to revitalizing Shakespeare and other classical playwrights in productions that resonate with us all and reflect the here and now. We are hugely excited to see what lies ahead!\n\nBOOK HERE!\n\nDR: What do you consider the most rewarding aspect of being a theatre director?\n\nBA: Getting to craft stories. To help birth something. Getting to work with others to weave magic from words. I love language and I love people and I love moments.\n\nDR: What do you believe are the key qualities of a successful theatre director?\n\nBA: I’m learning as I go, but I would think listening, being patient, trusting the process, trusting your instincts, and not taking yourself too seriously. Knowing when to speak and when to shut up (still very much learning!) Having vision, but being flexible. Leaning into the humor in the room. Not being too precious. Letting people breathe. Having fun. But always looking to honor the work, to be exacting, to not settle for surface choices, to keep digging, keep honing, keep divining the truth. Also, inspiring and motivating people! Making them feel energised and lucky to be doing this work. My favorite director and role model, Jack O’Brien, would give such gorgeous, rousing speeches about the work that we would feel like we would do anything for him. I can only dream of capturing a casts heart and imagination the way he does.\n\nPresented by The Quickening Theatre company and Gloucester Productions, ‘LUNGS’ by Duncan MacMillan runs at Theatre On The Bay from 7 – 24 February, 2024.\n\nPerformances from Tuesdays to Saturdays at 7:30pm, with Saturday matinees at 3pm.\n\nTickets available from Webtickets, or the Theatre On The Bay box-office on (021) 438-3301.\n\nAge restriction: 13\n\nFor more information on Bianca Amato, visit http://www.biancaamato.com/.\n\nBOOK HERE!\n\nhttps://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bianca-Amato-Headshot.jpeg 431 378 Dean Roberts https://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ptp-black-logo.svg Dean Roberts2024-01-29 12:12:252024-01-31 15:49:12Q&A: 'LUNGS' Director and Co-Producer, Bianca Amato, On Breathing Life into Duncan Macmillan's Hit West End Play.\n\nPieter Toerien presents Agatha Christie’s ingenious courtroom drama, for the first time in South Africa!\n\nWith All Star Cast including Graham Hopkins, Sharon Spiegel Wagner, Mike Huff, Peter Terry, Craig Jackson, Brett Kruger, Dianne Simpson, Matthew Lotter, Micah Stojakovic & Jordan Soares\n\nThis classic Christie will delight audiences and keep everyone on the edge of their seats right up till the thrilling climax that will leave you stunned!\n\nWITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION is a gripping tale of justice, passion, betrayal and revenge.

You decide your own truth, but always remember your way home.”\n\nHome is where the truth lies for André. Varying between moments when his coat shone vividly becoming the first Phantom in South Africa with Lloyd Webber’s seal of approval, to moments where every hint of colour faded from his coat, upon receiving a diagnosis of Motor Neurone Disease.\n\nThe narrative as well as songs, such as Any Dream will Do, You must love Me, Music of the Night, No Matter What, Memory and Send in the Clowns, weave together forming a unit that places this piece firmly in the genre of pure theatre. If you are expecting a “lounge music” version of any of these favourites, then you are coming to the wrong show.\n\nSend in the Clowns is the only song in the production that is not written by Lloyd Webber. “I marvel at the insolence of young artists who think they have owned the right to interpret this song. Their waltz with time is brimming with life. Whereas we, from whom youth has deserted, realise the ultimate clown”, says Schwartz.\n\nThe songs are presented unguarded, stripped and shamelessly honest – as is Schwartz’s life story.\n\nThe show moves between moments of immense pain experienced by the artist, to exalted moments of hope and inspiration – the key message of the show.\n\nHumour is omnipresent and razor-sharp – very often self-deprecating.\n\nDirected by Matthew Counihan.\n\nMusical direction by Bryan Schimmel, with Dawid Boverhoff on piano and Mauritz Lotz on guitar.\n\nWednesday, 22 May at 7:30pm\n\nThursday, 23 May at 7:30pm\n\nFriday, 24 May at 7:30pm\n\nSaturday, 25 May at 3pm\n\nSaturday, 25 May at 7:30pm\n\nSunday, 26 May at 2:30pm\n\nTickets available from Webtickets or the Theatre On The Bay box-office on (021) 438-3301.\n\nBooking link: https://www.webtickets.co.za/v2/Event.aspx?itemid=1538947649\n\nhttps://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Andre-Schwartz-Any-Dream-Will-Do-scaled.jpeg 2560 1814 Dean Roberts https://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ptp-black-logo.svg Dean Roberts2024-01-17 15:18:242024-05-27 09:16:09André Schwartz's Any Dream Will Do - My Pad Met (CPT)\n\nCONRAD KOCH & CHESTER MISSING’S ‘BAGGAGE’\n\nTheatre On The Bay from 28 February – 2 March, 2024.\n\nIn this laugh out loud, feel-good explosion of comedic silliness, internationally acclaimed ventriloquist Conrad Koch wants to get personal about his ‘Baggage’. But his best friend, superstar puppet Chester Missing (who lives in actual baggage), has other plans. In his usual funny and irreverent way Chester thinks Conrad’s ‘problems’ are a joke. In fact all the voices in Conrad’s head have bad and outrageous advice on everything: anxiety, climate change, dating, load-shedding and much much more. Meet the hilarious crew, including Hilton the booty shaking ostrich, Mr Dixon, retired high school teacher we can all relate to, and even a fashionista lion, this interactive comedy show is a LOL ensemble of one. ‘Baggage’ won a Standard Bank Ovation Award at the National Arts Festival.\n\n​​\n\nChester Missing is famous in South Africa for his satirical news TV shows, and his many viral social media posts, with 100 million views on TikTok alone. Conrad’s theatre shows have received critical acclaim globally, and has featured on the likes of Comedy Central, Canada’s Comedy Network, Just for Laughs, etc.\n\n“Fiercely intelligent… Frenzied Hilarity” The List, UK\n\n“Brings the roof down” The Independent, UK\n\n“Hilarious” Mail & Guardian\n\nBooking link: https://www.webtickets.co.za/v2/Event.aspx?itemid=1538779260\n\nBaggage is PG16, although everyone is welcome.\n\nhttps://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/BAGGAGE-A1-TOTB-1-scaled.jpeg 2560 1806 Dean Roberts https://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ptp-black-logo.svg Dean Roberts2024-01-17 15:11:472024-03-04 08:30:10Conrad Koch & Chester Missing's \"Baggage\"\n\nAlan Committie is back and he is FAST AND (reasonably) FURIOUS!\n\nSouth African stand-up comedy Hall-of-Famer, Alan Committie, returns for a laugh-filled start to 2024.\n\nHe is on stage at Theatre On The Bay with his latest, brand new stand up show: FAST AND REASONABLY FURIOUS, until 3 February, 2024.\n\nDisplaying his lighting fast wit coupled with his madcap phyisicality and renowned crowd engagement, this is Committie screeching his way across the stage with high octane, Vin-diesel fueled laughs for the post-holiday season.\n\nWhat to expect?\n\nA flip chart filled with flagrantly flippant fun facts.\n\nRants and ruminations around Coronations, World Cup fever, Artificial Intelligence and so much more….\n\nIn addition, Committie is throwing in an interval.

A promising theatre career ensued, including a tour of the stage adaption of Fatal Attraction where she played the complex lead role of Alex Forrest.\n\nJazzara made her debut feature film role as Olympia in Warner Brothers’ A Cinderella Story. She has since portrayed notable roles on screen including Jane Swann in Professionals (Brendan Fraser, Dir. Ciaran Donnelly, Bharat Nalluri) and Miranda Hugo in Mnet’s Lioness.\n\nShe has a deep passion for exploring the human condition which has now manifested in her creating her own work as a director and writer.\n\nDancing and singing is another expression she loves, be it in the lounge or on stage. Travelling fills her with the most joy and inspiration, diving into foreign cultures and new ways of thinking.\n\nSanda Shandu:\n\nBorn in Durban and raised in Newcastle KZN, Sanda Shandu is a Cape Town based actor, voice artist and musician.\n\nWhilst being a classically trained vocalist and pianist, Sanda studied at UCT and completed a Bachelor of Social Sciences in Economics and Organisational Psychology in 2015. With his heart still set on performing, it wasn’t long after his studies that he landed his first professional stage role in The Fugard Theatre’s Orpheus in Africa as ‘Richard Collins’ in 2015. ​\n\n2017 brought about more work at The Fugard Theatre where he landed a role in South Africa’s legendary hit musical King Kong as menacingly smooth gangster, “Lucky Lukasi”, which earned him his first Fleur du Cap and Naledi awards for Best Supporting Actor in a Musical. He received another Fleur du Cap nomination for his supporting roles as ‘Richmond/Dorset’ in Richard III at Maynardville Open-Air Theatre in 2019 and another for his supporting role in The Unlikely Secret Agent.\n\nOn screen you can see him in Netflix’s The Kissing Booth as “Randy”.

What sets this iteration apart is its superb triple threat cast and their extraordinarily professional delivery of powerful storytelling, heart stopping singing and outstanding performed dance numbers that have literally blown audiences and critics away night after night in the first bonsai season.\n\nSpring Awakening delves into the lives of a group of adolescent students discovering their sexual identities and desires as they rebel against the prevailing burdensome and restrictive societal norms. Under Sylvaine Strike’s visionary direction, this reimagined production expertly brings the gripping and emotional story to life as it explores complex themes such as self-discovery, repression, and the power of rebellion. Guest artists re-joining the LAMTA company will include the brilliant Francis Chouler and Natalie Robbie in multiple roles.\n\nSays LAMTA Co-Founder Anton Luitingh, “As we remount the show in March, it is my hope that an increasing number of our younger generation will see this production, both to revel in the magic of live theatre but more specifically because of the way that Spring Awakening resonates with its profound relevance to young individuals and their parents and guardians today, highlighting the symbiosis between the two generations. We are immensely proud of the sterling audience and media responses to our Spring Awakening and thrilled to confirm that this production extension, courtesy of Pieter Toerien, will be taking place at his beautiful venues – Theatre on the Bay in Cape Town and Montecasino in Johannesburg.”\n\nLAMTA (Luitingh Alexander Musical Theatre Academy) turned 5 this year and Spring Awakening, starring their own students, graduates and guest artists Francis Chouler and Natalie Robbie, marked the Academy’s first book musical and Strike’s first foray into musical theatre directing. Outstanding creatives on the show include Musical Director Amy Campbell, Resident Director Anton Luitingh, Choreographers Naoline Quinzin and Anna Olivier (with oversight by Duane Alexander); Set, Costume and Lighting Designer Niall Griffin, Intimacy Co-ordinator Natalie Fisher, and Sound Designer David Classen.\n\nBooking for the 2024 Spring Awakening season at Theatre on the Bay in March 2024 has opened at Webtickets and tickets can also be booked through 0214383301.\n\nPlease note that Spring Awakening contains mature themes, partial nudity, sexual situations as well as explicit language.\n\nBooking link: https://www.webtickets.co.za/v2/Search.aspx?search=spring\n\nNo persons under 13.\n\nhttps://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/SPAW-POSTER-JHB-Web.jpg 913 645 Mark Monte https://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ptp-black-logo.svg Mark Monte2023-12-18 13:54:382024-05-06 09:03:26SPRING AWAKENING - Jo'burg & Cape Town 2024\n\nPeter Schaffer’s AMADEUS\n\n8 March – 7 April at Pieter Toerien’s Montecasino Theatre\n\n12 April – 18 May at Theatre On The Bay\n\nGloucester Productions is thrilled to present a 2024 staging of Peter Schaffer’s classic text AMADEUS in Johannesburg (at Pieter Toerien’s Montecasino theatre) and then in Cape Town (at Theatre on the Bay).\n\nThis Tony award winning play was first staged in 1979 and has had numerous productions presented all over the world since then. In addition, there was an Oscar award winning movie made in 1984.\n\nThis thrilling drama has all the elements: Suspense, comedy, rousing music and great characters.\n\nIn the court of the Austrian Emperor Joseph II, Antonio Salieri is the established composer. Enter the greatest musical symphonist of all time: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\n\nSalieri has given himself to God so that he might realize his sole ambition, to be a great melodist. Mozart, however, is a foul-mouthed, graceless oaf who has that which is beyond Salieri’s envious grasp: Genius.This is Salieri’s passionate telling of his act of vengeance in response to Mozart!\n\nPeter Schaffer has given us a gripping, intriguing study of the roots of envy and the haphazard nature of genius.\n\nAMADEUS is brimming with gloriously evocative text and soaring snatches of Mozart’s music and promises to be a vivid theatrical occasion.\n\nAward winning director – Geoff Hyland – takes the helm of Amadeus.\n\nHis production team include: Illka Louw with costume design, Oliver Hauser with lighting, Gideon Lombard working on the sound design and Nadine Minnaar constructing the scenic elements.\n\nTwo time Fleur du Cap Best actor winner – Alan Committie – heads up the cast playing Antonio Salieri.\n\nThe rest of the cast to be announced shortly.\n\nThe production runs at Montecasino from the 8 of March to the 7 April and then moves to Theatre on the Bay from the 12 of April to the 18 of May.\n\nBookings are now open and can be made through Webtickets or by calling Montecasino on 011 5111988 or Theatre On The Bay on 021 4383300\n\nBooking link: https://www.webtickets.co.za/v2/search.aspx?search=amadeus\n\nhttps://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Amadeus-A1-Poster_JHB-03_PRINTsmall.jpg 1264 899 Mark Monte https://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ptp-black-logo.svg Mark Monte2023-12-04 13:40:472024-05-20 08:30:05AMADEUS - Jo'burg & Cape Town 2024\n\nAlan Committie\n\nIs back and he is\n\nFAST AND (reasonably) FURIOUS!\n\nSouth African stand-up comedy Hall-of-Famer, Alan Committie, returns for a laugh-filled start to 2024.

This is the best show I’ve seen in years.” – Michelle Welsh.\n\nThe Cast\n\nAdrian Galliard and his 14-year-old daughter, Emma-Jean, shot to cyber fame in 2020 after a video of the duo singing the famous Andrea Bocelli/Celine Dion hit, The Prayer, went viral. They parlayed their cyber success into their first theatre show, Accidentally Viral, which played to sold-out houses at the Redhill and Hilton Arts Festivals in 2022. They are supported by veteran accompanist Neil Bennett.\n\nEmma-Jean is now 16 years old and a consummate performer that belies her youth.\n\nhttps://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WebAEJ_Striking-a-Chord_A1-Poster_Monte_d31.jpg 814 580 Mark Monte https://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ptp-black-logo.svg Mark Monte2023-10-04 11:47:082023-11-27 09:04:39Striking a Chord with Adrian and Emma-Jean\n\nYou’ll ‘Feel The Earth Move‘! An exciting show is heading to Cape Town and Johannesburg, promising to deliver a fantastic theatrical experience, filled with heart and soul.\n\nVR Theatrical’s Jaco Van Rensburg, and show director Elizma Badenhorst, sat down with Dean Roberts to talk about the exciting new tribute show that will be hitting Pieter Toerien’s Cape Town and Johannesburg theatres in October and November this year.\n\nDR: Following up on the success of ‘Here’s To You – The Simon & Garfunkel Songbook’, what made Carole King’s catalogue so attractive to you?\n\nJVR: Apart from her world-famous Tapestry album, Carole King is a fascinating artist who not only made songs famous herself, but who wrote or co-wrote very many hits that nobody knows was her. Remember Kylie Minogue’s Loco-motion? I bet you didn’t know that that was a Carole King song!\n\nWhat ultimately drew us to her work, was the fact that her songs are story-songs. They are all like one-act plays that takes the listener on a journey of discovery, making it the perfect music for a theatrical event.\n\n“Our diverse cast is not only excellent, but also lovely humans! It has been an absolute pleasure to create this production around their specific talents.”\n\nDR: Carole King wrote more than 400 songs, 100 of which have hit the Billboard singles chart, how do you go about choosing the songs for the show?\n\nJVR: I am very lucky to not have to make the final decision here. I leave that to the creative team, although I may have had some opinions and made some suggestions.\n\nEB: Growing up, I loved music from the 60s and 70s. I had no idea who wrote them, I just knew I loved them, later in life I learned that Ms. King wrote many of my favourites. Going through her body of work was equally challenging, as it was a familiar stroll down memory lane. Choosing the songs was, indeed, a delightfully difficult task of mammoth proportions. But I must say, the concept took shape pretty quickly, and once we knew we were ‘up on a roof’ overlooking a city, the songs metaphorically ‘put up their hands’.\n\n“Storytelling. These women have a gift of telling stories through their music that any human can relate to in such an authentic way. The human condition addressed, but with exquisite melodies and harmonies to boot.”\n\nDR: Artists such as Adele, Amy Winehouse and Taylor Swift have all credited Carole King as being one of their biggest influences… can you hazard a guess as to what the through line is with these fine artists music?\n\nJVR: A good narrative. There are shoo-bee-doo-bee pop-songs and there are songs with lyrics like:\n\n“When this old world starts getting me down\n\nAnd people are just too much for me to face\n\nI climb way up to the top of the stairs\n\nAnd all my cares just drift right into space”\n\nThey’re relatable and timeless songs.\n\nEB: Storytelling. These women have a gift of telling stories through their music that any human can relate to in such an authentic way. The human condition addressed, but with exquisite melodies and harmonies to boot.\n\nDR: Your promotional material highlights an all-woman cast of singer-musicians who all work together to create these magical soundscapes, what was the casting process like?\n\nJVR: Casting an original production is always strange and wonderful. Because there is no script, we could mould and shape the production around the specific personality and talents that we find – and boy-oh-boy are these ladies talented! Six gorgeous proudly South African women who deliver these timeless songs with excellence!\n\nEB: The casting process of an original piece such as ‘Up on the Roof’ is always interesting to say the least, because the show doesn’t exist yet; you’re not casting a performer for a specific character. But there are so many things to consider. Their skills, their musicianship, their personalities, how will all of them work together; it’s a very intricate puzzle, and I must say, we have built an exquisite cast with our six phenomenal cast members.\n\nDR: Carole King has been called THE greatest songwriter of all time, and being responsible for penning the soundtrack to our lives. Why do you think these well-written songs have stood the test of time?\n\nJVR: She’s a great story-teller with an ear for writing a ‘hook’ – you know, that little bit of a song that gets stuck in your mind and that you can’t get out of your head.\n\nHer themes are universal and timeless (often about falling in or out of love) and have emotional depth. While this all sounds very cerebral, her melodies are also catchy! I think the combination of all of these things make her music timeless.\n\nEB: Ms. King has the ability to put words and melodies to universal feelings of love and loss, the ups and downs of life. We all know exactly what she’s addressing in her songs and most importantly, it then makes us not feel alone.\n\nDR: The music of Carole King is especially comforting, and with themes of love, relationships, and the idyllic notion of what ‘home means… how have you considered these themes when selecting the numbers as well as the ensemble cast?\n\nJVR: Our brilliant director, Elizma Badenhorst has come up with a clear concept that drives the overall narrative of the show. We did not want it to be ‘just another tribute show’ but rather to be thematically linked. Our musical director, Wessel Odendaal created original arrangements that emphasise the emotional impact of the songs.\n\nOnce the concept was established, i.e. a group of friends meet for a glass of wine on a ‘New York type’ rooftop and sing songs about their lives, the material sort of chose itself.\n\nOur diverse cast is not only excellent, but also lovely humans! It has been an absolute pleasure to create this production around their specific talents.\n\nDR: Could we perhaps argue that Carole King is the perfect everywoman figure: an alto singer (too low for soprano voice and too high for a tenor), the perfect mix for soul music?\n\nJVR: Yes! Unique is our Carole. Not only a brilliant songwriter, but also an exquisite vocalist in her own right, solidifying the singer/songwriter category in pop music history.\n\nDR: How are you aiming to marry the sublime sounds of Carole King’s catalogue, with the staging of such a dynamic ensemble presentation?\n\nJVR: The fact that we don’t have one person impersonating Carole King gives us scope to play with dynamic staging, interesting choreography and incredible vocal arrangements – all necessary to create an interesting piece of theatre.\n\nAdd to that a boho-chic inspired rooftop setting and theatrical lighting and you have a magic recipe for harmonic heavenliness!\n\nEB: When the concept came to me, it all fell into place so seamlessly: six girl friends meeting up on a roof overlooking the city observing some people down below and commenting through Ms. King’s songs on what they possibly could go through, realising we’re all pretty much the same.\n\nDR: ‘(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Women’ is a song that emphasises the route of self-discovery, of a woman’s natural inner beauty. How do you want the audience to leave the theatre ‘feeling’?\n\nJVR: Things are tough out there and people are tired. This production guarantees to make you forget your troubles for at least two hours, to fill you with hope, heart and optimism and will make you leave the theatre feeling happier than when you entered! I can only describe the experience as a warm, glowing ember that will ignite the fire we all carry within ourselves.\n\nEB: Uplifted…. And I guarantee this is what audience members will feel. They are going to hum along, laugh, shed a few nostalgic tears, but will definitely leave feeling better about life.\n\nDR: Who will enjoy this exciting piece of live theatre?\n\nJVR: You do not have to know Carole King’s catalogue in order to enjoy this incredible production. There is so much to listen to, look at and appreciate, from the beautiful setting to the gorgeous harmonies and the amazingly talented performers onstage. If you are the kind of person who enjoys any kind of live entertainment, there will be something here for you!\n\nEB: This is one of the many things a love about Ms. King’s music. Whether you know her/her work, or not, you will enjoy her music. The range of styles this woman composed in is incredible: soul, folk, pop, rock, jazz, R&B and more. If you love music, you will enjoy this production.\n\n‘Up On The Roof – The Carole king Songbook’ runs at Theatre On the Bay in Cape Town from 5 October and at Pieter Toerien’s Montecasino theatre in Johannesburg from 1 November, 2023.\n\nDirection & concept – Elizma Badenhorst\n\nMusical direction & orchestration – Wessel Odendaal\n\nScenic design – Nadine Minnaar\n\nWardrobe co-ordination – Elizma Badenhorst\n\nLighting design – Kieran McGregor\n\nGraphic design – Jaco Van Rensburg\n\nSound design – Christo Davis\n\nDuration is approx’ 2-hours, including a 20-minute interval.\n\nAge restriction: none.\n\nTickets are available from Webtickets or by dialling CPT (021) 438-3301 or JHB (011) 511-1988.\n\nBooking link: https://www.webtickets.co.za/v2/search.aspx?search=up+on+the+roof\n\nhttps://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/UOTR_Poster-scaled.jpg 2560 1803 Dean Roberts https://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ptp-black-logo.svg Dean Roberts2023-09-29 12:05:072023-10-13 09:00:58INTERVIEW: Up On The Roof - New Show Brings Songwriter Carole King's Legendary Tapestry Of Melodies To Stage.\n\nMzansi Ballet presents the RETURN BY HUGE DEMAND of their spectacular – The QUEEN Show!\n\nMain Theatre, 13 December to 14 Jan\n\nBookings now open at WEBTICKETS\n\nhttps://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Queen-Show-Edit-Poster.jpg 942 702 Mark Monte https://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ptp-black-logo.svg Mark Monte2023-08-29 10:23:392024-01-15 08:41:48Mzansi Ballet's The QUEEN Show - Jo'Burg Season 2023\n\nPieter Toerien and Gloucester Productions present\n\nSAME TIME, NEXT YEAR By Bernard Slade\n\nThis spring you can enjoy the hilarious romantic comedy that was one of the longest running hits on Broadway.\n\nSame Time, Next Year is a comic play that focuses on two happily married people – BUT, JUST NOT TO EACH OTHER!

Stripped down to the essence of their music. An absolute must-see at Pieter Toerien’s Theatre On The Bay: 27 June – 1 July.\n\nBorn in Brussels to a South African diplomat, Zoid grew up in Belgium before moving to Johannesburg. Here she attended the National School of the Arts before going on to study drama at AFDA. In 2001, she dropped out of university to focus her attention on music.\n\nSince releasing her first solo album, Poles Apart (2002), Zoid has become such an important part of the home grown scene that her name is now the byword for emotionally charged, downright incendiary South African rock music. The press renamed her followers the ‘Zoid Generation’.\n\nWhat’s more, through the last decade, Zoid has managed that unusual and frequently tricky feat of balancing popular appeal with critical praise; of securing an audience of both Afrikaans and English speakers; of retaining her individuality in a market known for its desire for ‘sameness’. And through it all, Zoid has held onto an enviable integrity that allows her to speak her mind in a way that only earns her more devotees and proved no barrier to being named Best Female Artist at the 2008 South African Music Awards.\n\nZoid’s super-charged rock energy is an ability to write gorgeous, delicately rendered songs that speak of the emotional vortex that drives this exceptional artist to keep creating. ‘Zoid Afrika’, her latest album shows that Karen Zoid is South Africa’s premier female rock artist, full stop. She has shared the staged with international acts like John Mayer, Annie Lennox, Metallica, Simple Plan, Hothouse Flowers, Seal and UB40.\n\nDuring her career, Zoid has earned various accolades (including gold album sales) but she says that what continues to drive her is a deep-seated desire to create music that she can get up on stage and play live.\n\n“When I was in that all-girl punk band, or busking or when I am playing to a huge crowd, the feeling I get from delivering my music is still the same – and that’s why I do this. All the stuff that goes around making an album – the promo, the interviews, making videos, the artwork … that’s work. Playing live? That’s what I love.”\n\nInteresting facts:\n\nMusic from Zoid’s albums has been included on the audio entertainment of international flights to and from South Africa.\n\nZoid has also written music for television, with two of her songs featuring in the 2006 movie “Number 10”.\n\nOn 3 May 2008, she won her first SAMA award for Best Female Artist.\n\nKaren Zoid performed at the inaugurations of Presidents Thabo Mbeki in 2004, and Jacob Zuma in 2009. She and her band also performed at the Nelson Mandela 46664 HIV/AIDS benefit concert in 2005.\n\nZoid and her band have had several concerts in London, mainly to South African audiences. In 2006 they performed in London, Canada and Dubai (at the Dubai Desert Rhythm Festival).\n\nTickets range from R150 – R250, and are available from Webtickets or the Theatre On The Bay box-office (021) 438-3300/1.\n\nBooking link: https://www.webtickets.co.za/v2/Event.aspx?itemid=1528470954\n\nhttps://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Karen-Zoid.png 784 556 Dean Roberts https://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ptp-black-logo.svg Dean Roberts2023-06-08 10:56:002023-06-26 09:25:36SAMA Award-Winning Singer-Songwriter Karen Zoid Set to Rock Theatre On The Bay!\n\nLAUGHABLE\n\nStuart Taylor returns to our theatre stages with his quintessential mix of hilarious stories and witty punchlines in Laughable.\n\nEverything in his life is fair game: from his other half to his offspring, trying to stay fit in his forties, and keeping up with the Joneses (or the Jabulanis or the Jaffers) in the suburbs.

It was a time when women had to know their place, peroxided their skins (because freckles were considered common) and men wore braces and smoked Springboktwak and Boeremeisies had to marry Boereseuns.\n\nThe heroine, Maxie de Meyer (a boeremeisie) falls in love with Raymond G. Bartlett (a dashing rooinek) who also happens to be a R.A.F fighter pilot – and a drama in the tradition of Springbokradio serials unfolds.\n\nStrydom sings in English, Afrikaans, French, German, Dutch and Zulu and is accompanied by her long-standing pianist and musical director, the brilliant Coenraad Rall.\n\nhttps://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/AmandaS.jpg 1191 842 Mark Monte https://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ptp-black-logo.svg Mark Monte2023-05-11 13:18:032023-08-07 08:53:20Amanda Strydom - STATE of the HEART\n\n“The hills are alive, with the sound of music…”\n\nThe world’s most loved musical returns to South Africa this December!\n\nPieter Toerien, with Cape Town Opera, presents the much-anticipated revival tour of Rodgers & Hammerstein‘s classic musical, The Sound Of Music.\n\nPerformances begin at the Artscape Opera House on 14 December 2023; the show is the perfect holiday treat for the entire family.\n\nJohannesburg theatre fans will soon after have an opportunity to revel in this full-scale musical masterpiece, from 27 January 2024 at The Teatro at Montecasino.\n\n“Of all the shows we have presented over the years, The Sound Of Music remains in the top five most requested shows by our audience. We are thrilled to be able to present this wonderful show to a whole new generation of musical fans”, says Toerien.\n\nThe Sound Of Music marks the 11th and final collaboration between legendary lyricists Rodgers & Hammerstein, and features a treasure trove of popular show tunes, including ‘My Favorite Things’, ‘Edelweiss’, ‘Climb Ev’ry Mountain’, ‘Do-Re-Mi’, ‘Sixteen Going On Seventeen’, and many more.\n\nThe inspirational story, based on the memoir of Maria Von Trapp, follows a young nun in-training who serves as governess to the seven children of the imperious Captain Von Trapp, bringing music and joy to the household. But as the forces of Nazism take hold of Austria, Maria and the entire Von Trapp family must make a moral decision.\n\nThe original stage production won six Tony awards, including Best Musical, and was then adapted into the five-time Oscar-winning film, which went on to become the most-successful movie musical of all time.\n\nDirected by Steven Stead, this new production, with sumptuous sets and costumes, and songs that will stay with you long after the curtain comes down, will be a stellar theatrical event.\n\nBookings now open at webtickets.co.za\n\nBooking link: https://www.webtickets.co.za/v2/search.aspx?search=The+Sound+Of+Music\n\nGroup bookings:\n\nFor Cape Town group bookings email dean@theatreonthebay.co.za\n\nFor Johannesburg group bookings email geraldine@montetheatre.co.za\n\nMedia Enquiries:\n\nFor Cape Town media enquiries contact dean@theatreonthebay.co.za\n\nFor Johannesburg media enquiries contact mark@montetheatre.co.za\n\nhttps://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Sound-Of-Music-SA-2023-4-Poster-scaled.jpeg 2560 1806 Dean Roberts https://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ptp-black-logo.svg Dean Roberts2023-05-09 11:04:102024-03-04 08:34:24Media Announcement: The Sound Of Music To Tour South Africa In 2023/4\n\nPieter Toerien & RMB present\n\nThe MZANSI TENORS\n\n21 – 25 June 2023\n\nAfter triumphant appearances around the country, the Mzansi Tenors, hosted by Richard Cock and supported by Rand Merchant Bank, are coming to Pieter Toerien’s Montecasino theatre from 21 June – 25 June.\n\nOnly 6 performances!\n\nGuest appearance by Nádine (Jesus Christ Superstar, Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Musiek Roulette), and introducing Sinesipho Mnyango.\n\nTheir dynamic Opera-style programme includes tenor arias, signature African pieces, Neapolitan favourites and musical theatre memories.\n\n“They are a South African sensation,” says Rand Merchant Bank’s Carolynne Waterhouse. “They could hold their own anywhere in the world.

After it’s first sold-out season at the Theatre on the Bay in 2016, the performer/writer has told his story to captivated audiences throughout South Africa. Now he will bring the experience back to the Montecasino Theatre. Having performed alone on the stages of the world for well over seven thousand times, Pieter-Dirk Uys has learnt that every show is the first and the last performance – because each audience demands and gets a different energy, topicality and excitement. Now in his 77th year, he doesn’t glance back at the successes and failures that have strengthened his belief in a constant improvement of his work, but at those small signposts that throughout his life subconsciously have pointed him in a right and original direction – his father Hannes Uys, his mother Helga Bassel, his grandmothers, his teachers, his passions: Sophia Loren, censorship, false eyelashes and making a noise when everyone demanded silence.\n\nSouth Africa’s foremost satirist sits on a barstool, wearing his black beanie and his Almost Famous sweatshirt, and with his impish smile, he even looks like a naughty goblin trapped by the spotlight. Within minutes he fills the auditorium with his presence. This is just Pieter-Dirk Uys speaking and he opens his heart and talks about his private and public life. The big hair and silky repartee of Evita Bezuidenhout or the smoky drone of the sexy Bambi Kellermann have been stored elsewhere for some other time. It soon becomes clear that the title of his autobiographical one-man memoir, The Echo of a Noise, doesn’t really do justice to what he presents here. He leads you into his inner sanctuary, takes you through our history and shows where what is public and private meet.\n\nUys was and still is a voice in the wilderness, ever since he first appeared fearlessly on a stage in the 1970’s. He jokes that the all-powerful censor board was his own personal public relations department. We hear the recording of the voice of little Pietertjie Uys singing like an angel and accompanied on the piano by his father, Hannes Uys, whom he would accompany on Sundays to the church where ‘Pa’ was organist – the father whom he loved, but didn’t like very much; the sternest critic of his work and yet the one who could also give good advice. He tells of his father’s last moments, being with him as he died and then going back to the family home where Sannie, the housekeeper and his ‘Cape Flats mother’, asked if there wasn’t any washing from ‘Pa’. The audience is spellbound as he shares the suicide of his German mother, Helga, as well as the influences on him of his Afrikaans and German grandmothers. It’s as if Uys constantly takes his audience into his confidence and so breaks all the rules and crosses boundaries. He remains a master storyteller who can make as much fun of himself as he does with the others who get a lashing from his sharp tongue. This is arguably beyond the 7000th solo performance and yet it feels as fresh as his very first.\n\nMEDIA COMMENTS\n\nThe Echo of a Noise is the most honest and wonderful performance I’ve ever seen him give. He’s a magnificent raconteur – Leslie Stones / Daily Maverick 28.3.2017\n\nWatching this intimate performance was like having a one-on-one conversation with Uys – Karitha Pillay / Witness 23.2.2017\n\nPieter-Dirk Uys has a knack of knocking life into perspective. Even as we laughed, we left The Echo of a Noise much wiser, with thanks for the gift of this teacher/philosopher/actor/satirist/humourist. Long may Pieter-Dirk Uys remain our moral signpost – Sheila Chisholm / OnChisholm 4.4.2017\n\nFor me the show was a revelation of Pieter-Dirk Uys’s considerable courage, humanity, endurance and loyalty – Chris Sutton / Times 27.7.2017\n\nHe shared his personal history with such a profound sense of honesty that at times I was moved to tears – Wanda Daly ? Berea Mail 2.7.2017\n\nA national treasure, a theatrical legend, a master craftsman, a constant inspiration – Pieter-Dirk Uys delivers his most poignant and gripping work to date with The Echo of a Noise. He is simply superb. – Billy Suter / Sosuterbill 27.7.2017\n\nThe experience of a great comforting hug is perhaps the best way to describe The Echo of a Noise. That hug is an ode to storytelling in service of the theatre and life that helped shape Uys as an all-round creative artist.\n\nHe’s engaging, dramatic, poignant, bitingly satirical and hysterically funny – performing the most riveting two hours without an interval. But you barely notice the time. Don’t miss it. – Caroline Smart / Artsmart 27.7 2017\n\nThe story he weaves in The Echo of a Noise is funny, sad, poignant and utterly compelling … Uys’s finest work. – Estelle Simkins / Witness 2.8.2017\n\nThis is an amazing glimpse into what created one of the most influential performers in South Africa. Uys is a master storyteller whose characters are always entertaining and at the same time often poignant. This wonderful trip down memory lane is a treasure and definitely a show not to be missed – Dawn Heynes / Livewire 8.7.2017\n\nThat’s what I took away from The Echo of a Noise – a feeling of solidarity and a night filled with laughter and some tears. And that’s Pieter-Dirk Uys. That’s always been Pieter-Dirk Uys. An artist who has, through the decades, united a very divided South Africa through laughter and later introspection. – Carla Bernardo / Cape Argus 1.12.2016\n\nPieter-Dirk Uys’ one-man memoir – The Echo of a Noise\n\nPieter-Dirk Uys has taken South Africa by storm with his provocative and deeply personal memoir The Echo of a Noise. It is a story that aches to be heard and Uys knows how to keep his audiences on the very edge of their seats waiting to hear about the great influences in his life: his father Hannes Uys and mother Helga Bassel, and of course his unlikely pen friend, the beautiful Sophia Loren. Audiences are given the opportunity to celebrate a life well lived in all its emotional states. Uys has played to full houses and sold out seasons. His masterful story telling, wit and wisdom are generously shared. As with so many of his performances he takes his audiences into his confidence, breaks the rules and crosses boundaries. Since the moment he first stepped on stage in the 1970s, Uys has been a voice where others have demanded silence. Jokes about the censor board being his own personal public relations department, gently disguise the reality that each time he tread the boards, he crossed lines and stepped on quite dangerous toes. He has always used humour as a “weapon of mass distraction” and describes the laughter he evoked as a relief from the fears that shaped South African society in 1950s, 60s, 70s, and 80s.

A sell-buy date in Uys’s hands will reflect a new post-Covid energy that, while his audition might be over and the disease to please has been cured, proves that a PDU show is always a highlight to remember.\n\n* no interval\n\n* running time: 70/80 mins max\n\n* English and Afrikaans\n\nhttps://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PDU-SELL-BY-DATE-Poster-2023-Monte-1-1-scaled.jpeg 2560 1806 Mark Monte https://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ptp-black-logo.svg Mark Monte2023-03-14 11:51:402023-09-11 09:04:40Pieter-Dirk Uys SELL-BY DATE - Jo'Burg Season 2023\n\nFIREFLY\n\nStarring Sylvaine Strike & Andrew Buckland,\n\nwith Tony Bentel on piano.\n\nDirected by Toni Morkel.\n\nPieter Toerien’s Theatre On The Bay from 28 April to 13 May\n\nPieter Toerien’s Montecasino Theatre from 17 May to 11 June.\n\nIn the remote village of Bucket’s End, nestled high in the mountains upstream from the disappearing river, Ferine and Ferase manifest their love by delighting in their masterful telling of the story of two ill-fated lovers whose forbidden love is ignited by full moons and fireflies. The exceptional clowning duo of theatre legends Andrew Buckland and Sylvaine Strike take you on an unforgettable journey into wonder with Firefly.\n\n“One of the factors that make this piece so unique is the range of imaginative theatre traditions and techniques used. Clowning and its associated physical tics and contortions combine with perspective switches in both action and narration to help the audience understand which couple they are engaging with and what sort of emotional connection is likely most appropriate. An incredible level of detail adds a dozen extra layers – costumes that contort to reflect a character’s emotional state; a tiny peephole in a giant curtain, used just once, but revealing the specific headspace; the precise movements of one or both of the actors as they contort their bodies to fit an hilarious description of their appearance. Strike and Buckland, along with director Toni Morkel, ensure that nothing in this tidal wave of creativity exists purely for the sake of filling a gap, with each nuance helping to first establish an understanding of the story and then to inspire a feeling of ever-growing wonder at the poetic, desolate, hysterical, exultant genius of it all.” – Bruce Dennill, pARTicipate\n\nAge restriction: PG-10\n\nDuration: 1 Hour 15 minutes – no interval\n\nBookings at webtickets.co.za\n\nBooking link: https://www.webtickets.co.za/v2/search.aspx?search=firefly\n\nhttps://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Fire-Fly-2023-scaled.jpeg 2560 1810 Mark Monte https://www.pietertoerien.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ptp-black-logo.svg Mark Monte2023-02-27 09:47:092023-06-12 09:18:03FIREFLY - 2023\n\nCAPE TOWN OPERA presents MASTER CLASS starring SANDRA PRINSLOO as MARIA CALLAS, Pieter Toerien’s Montecasino Theatre from 15 March to 2 April, 2023.\n\nFrom 15 March to 2 April 2023, Pieter Toerien in association with Cape Town Opera (CTO) will present MASTER CLASS at Pieter Toerien’s Montecasino Theatre, a riveting play written by the late American playwright, librettist and five-time Tony Award winner Terrence McNally (Kiss of the Spider Woman, Love!Valour!Compassion!, Ragtime, The Lisbon Traviata).\n\nDirected by CTO’s Artistic Director Magdalene Minnaar, with musical direction by José Dias, the two-act play stars Sandra Prinsloo as Maria Callas and features well-known arias by Verdi, Puccini and Bellini. Prinsloo, in a purely acting role, will be joined by a stellar supporting Cape Town Opera cast including Soloist Brittany Smith together with CTO’s Judith Neilson Young Artists Alida Scheepers and Tylor Lamani as the aspiring opera singers mentored by Callas. Musical Director José Dias takes on a dual role as pianist and actor. Costume design is by Maritha Visagie and lighting design is by Magdalene Minnaar.\n\n“Cape Town Opera is delighted to be presenting this superb piece of theatre,” says Magdalene Minnaar. “From having one of South Africa’s greatest actresses playing Callas to being back at Pieter Toerien’s beautiful Theatre on the Bay during the100th anniversary of Callas’ birth is very special.”\n\nMaster Class is a portrait of Callas in the context of the master classes she gave at the Juilliard School in New York in 1971, at a time when she herself had not"
