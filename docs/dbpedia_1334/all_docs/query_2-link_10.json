        "text": "‚≠êÔ∏è It is with the utmost fulfillment and contentment that I announce my successful completion of the Program Management Internship with the United Nations Secretariat in the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and the Department of Peace Operations (Shared Structure). The time I spent with extremely talented and driven team working on the ‚ÄúBuilding Our Pillar‚Äù initiative truly surpassed my expectations. I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to build on my program management skills with the UN in an international and multicultural setting. During my internship, I had the opportunity to be the lead for the Building Our Pillar weekly newsletter which focused on career growth, innovation and capacity building, diversity and inclusion and mental health and well-being. I was also privileged to work on two significant projects concerning learning development and mental well-being in an organizational setting. Being passionate about human rights and having majorly focused on inequalities during my undergraduate studies, working with the UN has been particularly significant in putting my passions and knowledge to good use. This experience has allowed me to further develop my knowledge and skill set in promoting diversity, equity, equality and inclusion. I have also been able to approach program management from a nuanced and inclusive lens, ensuring optimal organisational performance despite many surrounding challenges. Beyond learning by doing through my role and responsibilities, I have also earned certifications in Microsoft Power BI and Data Visualisation. These additions have enhanced my skill set beyond my qualitative analysis capabilities and will allow me to take on a wide range of research and analysis challenges going forward. I can safely say that this is one of the best teams I have worked with. Despite working remotely with a 6 hour time difference, the department went above and beyond to ensure I was included. A special thank you to my supervisors Alexandra Marksteiner and Cecile Grima for their amazing mentorship and guidance throughout. I am grateful this significant opportunity in my early career and look forward to the new heights it will help me climb to in the future ‚≠êÔ∏è. #UnitedNations #DPPA #DPO #programmanagement #UNInternship #PoliticalAffairs #DEI #OrganisationalCulture #Innovation #RecentGraduate #SocialChange\n\nüéìOn the 29th of February, 2024, Trianon Convention Centre in Mauritius welcomed the largest ALC graduating cohort through its doors; a momentous occasion I am proud to say I was part of. I am ecstatic to announce that I have graduated from the The African Leadership University and Glasgow Caledonian University with a BA (Hons) in Social Sciences with a First Class Distinction! If, 3 years ago, someone were to tell me this would be my reality I would‚Äôve have simply laughed at their seemingly unrealistic hopes. This time in 2020, I was embarking on an entirely different path, choosing to work and save up for my higher education which I could not afford on my own. But, thanks to ALU/ALC and the Mastercard Foundation, I continue to serve as a testimony that no dream is too big and no goal too far-fetched. If this journey has taught me anything, it‚Äôs to never stop dreaming and continue to fight for what you truly want. It WILL come. Three years and many many submissions later, I walked that staged as a graduate! After many tears, rejections, celebrations, sleepless nights, ChatGPT prompts and Google Scholar searches, I can call myself an Alumnus. Words cannot accurately surmise the magnitude of how much this means to me. I am a first-generation college student. This experience will be carried for my lifetime, as will the amazing network of people I grew with over time. It was not easy, but it was definitely worth it. Aside from graduating with a First Class Honours and a Distinction in my Dissertation (with the second-highest grade), I was also named GCU-ALC‚Äôs Best Student and was a runner-up for ALC‚Äôs Intellectual Excellence Award, all testament to my tenacity and dedication despite the odds. Thank you to everyone who played an instrumental part in this journey, particularly my facilitators and supervisors, Anandini Kistamah, Fran√ßois Ga√´l Sarah Chatton , Jared Jeffery and Dr. Emmanuel Nuesiri. üí´This is not the end, only the beginning, of a transformational journey.\n\nI remember when I first heard of Minority Africa. It was through an email an ALU faculty member had sent regarding an essay I had written for my African Studies class. The essay, which spoke of the portrayal of Africa in global media and the dangers of stereotypical stories about our African communities, was praised by my facilitator, Emmanuel Nuesiri, who believed I could have it published. The ALU Faculty member I mentioned, Shaheen Beeharry, agreed with him and referred me to a pan-African publication challenging societal norms in Africa - Minority Africa. I immediately fell in love with their vision as someone who has fully pivoted towards social impact. While my essay, not for lack of excellence, could not be published with them due to it not specifically focusing on an African minority, which is MA‚Äôs identity, it did give me a meaningful connection with their Managing Editor, Caleb Somtochukwu Okereke. Through this connection, I was able to gain a mini-internship with Minority Africa‚Äôs Editorial team from September to December 2022. Now, why would I randomly bring this up 3 months after my internship ended? Well, today I received an email announcing that a piece a fellow intern, kevin wanai, and I had worked on had finally been published. This piece represented weeks and weeks of very intentional work. We received word that two South African editors had just released an anthology that expressed the nuanced and multi-faceted journeys of the LGBTQ+ communities across Africa. It was one of the biggest and most comprehensive of its kind. Minority Africa decided to take the story on and write a feature for the book. I have written several articles before, but this one really impacted my journey as a writer and here‚Äôs why. First of all, it was the first article I did that required interviews. While this may not seem big, it was a time I fully felt like I was in my journalistic era. I developed personal connections with the editors, Dr Layla Cassim and Meryl Du Plessis, and felt a part of their lives through their stories. I was brought to tears when speaking to one of the contributors about the motivation behind their contribution. I learnt so much about sensitisation and respect when talking about such polarising topics on a largely conservative continent. Not being part of the LGBTQ+ community myself, I learnt about the dangers of speaking for others. In this way, I tried to approach it from the perspective of speaking with others and made it a point to include their voices every chance I could get. After months of reaching out, writing, editing, re-editing, re-interviewing and re-learning, we are able to see the beautiful product of our collective efforts. This piece represents the fight to spread love, not hate, across the continent. Thank you to every contributor for their amazing work! https://lnkd.in/e8WBbed2\n\nPart 2. It‚Äôs safe say that this is one of the best experiences I have had so far; from the mindblowing trips to Google, Google X and Amazon to the fun mixers with students from programs such as Emerson, the one factor that always stood out to me was the quality of people we met along the way. As Huggy Rao taught us, and many echoed this sentiment, strong teams get far and teams are made of PEOPLE. Never overlook the power of people; they are immeasurably important. I would like to extend a huge thank you to the following people who made this experience nothing short of amazing: - Chase Huff and Laura Mapstone, our outstanding program leads who bent over backwards for us to ensure the program was a success. - Manuelito Biag and Tselot Aklilu for welcoming us to Carnegie with open arms and making us feel at home, AND leading the Design Thinking series (one of the best sessions we had!) - William R. Cockayne, Ph.D. and Arman Amin for working so closely with us and helping us bring our projects to life. Your insights helped us reach a deeper level of analysis and unpacking and really pushed us further than we thought we could go. - The African Leadership University, Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching , College Track and Stanford University. Without you, there would be no program, so thank you for opening doors for us. -Kenton D. Raiford , Andrew Fede, Nick Kohli, Astro Teller, Lorraine Bassett PhD, Wafo Luc Tengueu and Stephanie Gong and for giving us Google, X, the moonshot factory and Amazon / Amazon Web Services (AWS) tours and lectures. Your energy, kindness and insightfulness will be remembered long into our future. Fun fact, we are the first group that was allowed back on Google‚Äôs campus for a tour post-Covid. -Tshisikhawe Hope Rabonda for being a fantastic friend, sister and co-host for graduation. -Woopi Takarasima for being the best work-partner and friend during this transformational time. -leila K. and Leckraj MUNIEN (he/him) for their amazing teamwork and hosting skills when we led FLD. -The team at ALLY, Bryan Bahizi Daniella Ralaiarinosy, Adriana M. Valdivia and Yuri Coret. They worked tirelessly to bring our idea to life and made the best team! -Every participant made this special for me in your own way, and I will remember you all. -Our lecturers and guest speakers are too many to name individually, but each left us with invaluable knowledge and immense gratitude. We were privileged to hear from you. Here is to more great experiences, may we only go up from hereü•Ç.\n\nPart 1. Wow, what a mindblowing four weeks it has been! I remember saying it felt like I had been a part of the Silicon Valley Hub Program for five years after the intensity of the first week. Now that I am back home in Zimbabwe after 44 hours of travel, it feels like the program passed in just a few minutes, and I wish I could rewind and replay the entire experience again. Those who know me know that I will tell a story, it‚Äôs what I do, and this post is no different. So sit back and enjoy this experience with me. I went into the inaugural SVHP sceptical of my ability to thrive in such an environment. I was not enterprising in an entrepreneurial sense (or so I thought). Most of my questions to the several industry leaders we were privileged to meet were geared toward how a Social Science student, like myself, could contribute to and be successful in spaces primarily focused on business and technovation. I am passionate about working toward a more socially equitable world where we no longer have marginalised groups fighting extra hard to receive their fair share of the pie. Social impact stands at the core of me as a person and my goals as a young leader. It was refreshing and comforting to see so many people working towards these causes in the most innovative ways that I would never have begun thinking of if I had not been immersed in such an environment. From The Distributed AI Research Institute (DAIR) to X, the moonshot factory to Google, I learned there are infinite ways different industries can contribute to the cause, and I am more than capable of positively impacting these spaces. The lesson I took home from this is that it doesn‚Äôt matter what you study; it is more about what you can bring to the table as a person. That is what great companies look for. I have grown more in these four weeks than I had since commencing university in January 2021. I believe this is because I have been surrounded by truly unique people, from faculty to guest speakers to my fellow participants. All have in one way or another, pushed me to take risks and challenge my boundaries, which led me to do things I never thought I would be able to do (at least not without making an absolute fool of myself). I climbed the treacherous hill more than once every week. I co-hosted two events, FLD and Graduation. I completed the business simulation with a viable idea and more confidence in myself and my abilities than ever before. It is truly amazing what you can accomplish when you step out of your comfort zone and allow yourself to grow, no matter how uncomfortable it may feel. Stay tuned for Part 2."
