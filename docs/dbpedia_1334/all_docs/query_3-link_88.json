        "text": "ALICEDALE JUNCTION – GRAHAMSTOWN RAILWAY\n\nResearched and compiled by Bruno Martin\n\nWhen the citizens of Grahamstown first lobbied for a railway in 1856 they had asked for a direct line to Port Elizabeth but instead, under Cape Act 19 of 1874, Grahamstown was to be served with a branch line linked the Cape Midland Line at Alicedale Junction. Not happy with the decision, S C Cronwright, MP for Grahamstown, presented the Legislative Council with a petition with 1 334 signatures requesting Grahamstown be included on the main line – but to no avail. After the main line had reached Alicedale Junction in May 1877, work started on the Grahamstown branch. The first section, 22 miles 17 chains long, was opened to Atherstone on 3 March 1879 while the next section, comprising 12 miles and 66 chains, was opened six months later to Grahamstown on 3 September.\n\nThere was no official welcome on the evening of 2 September for the first passenger train arriving at Grahamstown Station from Port Elizabeth carrying some important guests for the formal opening the next day. The following morning “a well-dressed, expectant and hospitably-disposed crowd” assembled at the station to witness the departure of the first train at 11:00 am from Grahamstown Station for the ceremonial journey to Atherstone. After arriving at Atherstone, the passengers were left to mark time while waiting for the 16-carriage special train from Port Elizabeth which was running 1½ hours behind schedule. For the journey to Grahamstown, the combined train now made up of 25 carriages was doubled-headed with the leading engine “gorgeously emblazoned” and bearing the name ‘The Settler City’ and the consist banked by a third engine. The platform at Grahamstown Station was packed to capacity with spectators as the train rolled in and came to a stop. Passengers on the train were unable to get off for about 20 minutes and then they still had to push their way through the crowd with their luggage.\n\nThe opening ceremony followed the established pattern of speeches of a political flavour and full of praise for the chief engineer Mr Watson and his team. The formalities culminated with three cheers “for the success and prosperity of the line”.\n\nBuilding the branch line to Grahamstown through the difficult terrain was no mean achievement which called for considerable professional skill from the district engineer W J Rose. It required boring three short tunnels – more than on any other line in the Cape Colony embodied at the time – the longest was the 787ft Waai Nek tunnel*. One major cutting involved the blasting and removal of 17 000 cubic yards of hard white rock. A bridge composed of loose rock was built over a deep ravine while on another stretch a 70 ft high embankment was required. On exiting the 300-ft long New Year’s River Tunnel, two miles from Alicedale Junction, the line encountered a sustained 1 in 40 grade for 11 miles to Highlands. The line reached its highest point 2 500 feet above sea level between Tunnel No.2 and Cold Spring from where it descended 750 feet over 7½ miles into Grahamstown.\n\n* George Pauling’s first contract: to supervise the work in the tunnel and on each side of it.\n\nTHE KOWIE RAILWAY COMPANY\n\nGrahamstown was not intended to be the end of the line for long: the business community now focussed on enhancing the commercial prospects of the city by extending the railway to Port Alfred. Residents of Lower Albany had petitioned the Cape Colonial Government as early as 1862 for a railway between Grahamstown and Port Alfred. About £200 000 was spent by the Cape Colonial Government to establish a harbour at the mouth of the Kowie River. This work was abandoned in 1898 and the harbour was left to silt up.\n\nGeorge Pauling, who went on to make a name for himself building railways in Southern and Central Africa and other parts of the world, arrived in Grahamstown in 1877 where he established various business ventures as a hotelier, builder and contractor. Pauling records he was “on terms of intimate friendship” with Mr Cronwright, MP for Grahamstown and that he suggested to him if the government could be induced to grant a subsidy of £2 000 per mile for building the railway from Grahamstown to Port Alfred he might be able to raise the rest of the capital needed in England. An announcement was made on 23 July 1880 that the railway was to be constructed by private enterprise with a subsidy of £50 000 provided by the Cape Colonial Government. The route was surveyed between September 1880 and March 1881 and on 16 May, the bill authorising the construction of the railway was passed by the Cape Parliament as Act No.5 of 1881. Pauling teamed up with one of his business acquaintances, Ralph Firbank, to form the company Firbank & Pauling and was awarded the contract to build the railway. Of a total estimated cost of £350 000 for the 43 miles and 34 chains of railway, Pauling had to raise £300 000 in England. The Grahamstown and Port Alfred Railway Company Ltd was floated in England with a capital of £200 000 from mainly British shareholders. On 21 October 1881, John X Merriman, Commissioner of Public Works, performed the turning of the first sod ceremony in Port Alfred.\n\nBy February 1882, earthworks were completed for 14 miles and ready for track laying. Rails had been shipped out from England but the inability to land the railway material due to bad weather and the breakdown of the tug seriously hampered the progress. The company ordered four tank locomotives from the Hunslet Engine Co. Ltd of Leeds; two of which were landed from the ‘SS Rothesay’ at Port Alfred on 22 May 1882. The passenger locomotives with a 4-4-0 wheel arrangement and weighing 22 tons in full working order were named ‘Bathurst’ and ‘Grahamstown’. Sporting large American-type balloon stacks, they were designed for wood-firing as imported coal from Wales was considered too expensive. The goods locomotives were named ‘Kowie’ and ‘Port Alfred’ and had an 0-6-0 wheel arrangement.\n\nThe first train is reported to have operated on a 2-mile long stretch of the line on 27 July 1882. By May 1883, the line was in operation several miles beyond Bathurst and it was anticipated that the whole line would be opened throughout by the end of 1883. About 6 per cent of the line was graded at 1 in 40 while 30 per cent was graded at 1 in 50 and curves of 8 chains minimum radius.\n\nCrossing the deep gorge of Blaauwkrantz River was the main obstacle in the way of completing the line. Local Africans believed demons and ghosts inhabited the forbidding gorge and always insisted on waiting for a while before entering to appease the spirits. Pauling noted that “ a very bad piece of country had to be crossed and it took some time before it was decided to cross the worst spot of the route called Blaauwkrantz, about thirteen miles from Grahamstown, by a high-level bridge\". The bridge was designed by civil engineers Max Am Ende and A Buchanan, the superstructure supplied by Messrs A Handyside & Co., Derby, England. The components of the bridge were shipped to Port Alfred and transported to the site by the railway which in the meantime had been completed up to there. Thirty-five men were engaged in erecting the bridge under the supervision of Mr Parker from Messrs Handyside & Co. The erection of the bridge was completed on 2 August 1884. It was built on the cantilever principle with a central span of 230ft, towering at its highest point 185ft above the riverbed, with two spans on either side of 61ft 3in giving an overall length of 480ft 6ins. The raking struts were 75ft long and the supporting piers were 55ft high.\n\nWhen about two-thirds of the work on the railway was finished, a financial arrangement proposed by Ralph Firbank fell through and Pauling had great difficulty in raising sufficient funds to carry on with the contract. Pauling had gambled with the idea of getting the government to advance the subsidy of £1 500 per mile built but the responsible department steadfastly refused to release any money until the railway was completed. To add to Pauling’s financial woes, his business partner Ralph Firbank died suddenly from heart failure. Pauling managed to juggle payments from other contracts he had won to see out the completion of the Port Alfred-Grahamstown Railway.\n\nTo create some cash-flow, a passenger service was introduced 24 December 1883 from Port Alfred to a temporary terminus named Waai Plaatz near the Blaauwkrantz Bridge where passengers transferred to a post-cart to continue their journey to Grahamstown. Provision was made in the timetable taking effect on 4 January 1884 for a daily combined train and post-cart journey in each direction. The cost of the journey was far from being cheap: a charge £2 was made for each passenger.\n\nOn 27 August 1884, a party of officials (Messrs Cooper, the railway company’s chief engineer; Drennan, the government engineer, Hopkinson, the contractor’s engineer and Lowe, the traffic manager) travelled down the line from Belmont to the Blaauwkrantz Bridge. Here, they boarded the footplate of the waiting locomotive of a construction train which would have been the first to cross the bridge. With locomotive superintendent Begbie at the controls, the ‘Port Alfred’ proceeded across the bridge with its guests to the construction train waiting on the Port Alfred side. Ten days later, testing the bridge followed the time-honoured process of first placing two locomotives coupled together on each of the side spans, and then moved so that all four locomotives straddled the centre span, after which all four locomotives slowly hauled sixteen wagons with a total load of 300 tons over the bridge at 25 mph and lastly, all four locomotives entered the bridge at speed and brought to a sudden halt on the centre span. The results of the test were very satisfactory in all respects: the deflection and oscillation amounted to just a few thousandths of an inch.\n\nThe line was opened to traffic on 1 October 1884 but not all went to plan on the opening day: the train from Port Alfred which left at 7:00 am did not arrive in Grahamstown until 7:00 pm – a rather trying experience for a journey of a little over 43 miles. Trains initially operated from a temporary terminus ‘near the native location’ in Grahamstown until 1 December when the Kowie Railway Company’s trains were able to use the CGR station. Two passenger services initially operated daily in each direction but after five months the service was reduced to one regular train. The construction cost of the railway was never fully recovered and the Grahamstown and Port Alfred Railway Co. Ltd had “proved a sore drain on our resources” lamented Pauling.\n\nWhile passenger and goods traffic looked promising at the start of operations, the volume was not sustained, and the railway company was plunged into financial difficulties. With financial resources exhausted, cabled instructions placing the Kowie Railway Company in liquidation were sent from London placing the brokers in possession of the station buildings, even seizing the manager’s household goods while the employees were left unpaid. A public notice appeared on 19 July 1887 advising no scheduled trains would be running after 20 July.\n\nAlthough scheduled services had ceased, a weekly mixed train was run to convey goods landed at Port Alfred and passengers from the district who wanted to travel to Grahamstown. With the Jubilee Exhibition to be held in Grahamstown from December 1877 until January 1888, the sudden closure of the railway to Port Alfred could not have come at a worse time. As many visitors from all over South Africa were expected to visit the region, it was decided to continue running a limited service until March 1888.\n\nFollowing negotiations with the liquidator, a syndicate was formed by ten residents of Grahamstown to take over the running of the railway. It was reopened on 27 October 1888 and continued operating until 1 September 1895 when a new company was formed, the Kowie Railway Company Ltd., to take over the line. A government loan of £20 000 was secured by debenture stock of which £5 000 was allocated to expenses in connection with the liquidation of the original railway company. The balance of £15 000 was ear-marked for getting the permanent way and rolling stock in good working order. The parliamentary authority obtained for the formation of the new railway company gave the Government the right to nominate two directors on the board.\n\nThe new company soldiered on until that fateful day, Saturday, 22 April 1911 when disaster struck:\n\nThe Memorial Edition of Grocott’s Penny Mail, dated 1 May 1911, carried an ‘authentic description of the appalling accident’ headlined Blaauwkrantz Bridge Disaster. Passenger Train hurled into the Valley of Death. A goods wagon on a mixed train carrying stone for Grahamstown Cathedral derailed a short distance from the bridge. It bumped along the sleepers and on reaching the centre of the bridge turned over snapping the front coupling and detaching it from the front portion of the train which continued to Grahamstown. The sudden impact of the two trailing passenger coaches against the overturned wagon sent them toppling over the side of the bridge where they were smashed to pieces on the rocks below. Twenty-eight passengers were killed and a further twenty-two were hurt, though it appears that one or two more may have subsequently succumbed to their injuries. There was one remarkable survivor: upon hearing a voice calling “Mummy”, two men climbed up one of the bridge’s 55ft high support piers to rescue a little girl found seated on a crossbeam.\n\nAt the inquiry into the accident, it was suggested that the derailed goods wagon that had caused the accident was overloaded. The magistrate, however, ruled that the derailment was due to poor maintenance of the track and rolling stock. As for the damage to the bridge – some rails were ripped up and a handrail on the south side bent. Within a few days, the bridge was repaired and declared safe to be reopened to traffic.\n\nThere can be little doubt that the Blaauwkrantz Bridge disaster was the death knell for the Kowie Railway Company. The company went into liquidation on 4 September 1912 with tenders to purchase called for both in South Africa and the United Kingdom. The sole offer of £47 500 to purchase came from the Union Government which acquired the line by a Resolution of Parliament and added it to the 8340 miles of open lines of the SAR on 1 April 1913.\n\nPOSTSCRIPT:\n\nUnable to cope with increased loads and the use of heavier rolling stock, the Blaauwkrantz* Bridge was replaced with a new structure at a cost of £29 000. The new bridge, consisting of two 84ft, two 102ft and three 36ft spans carried on trestles standing 175ft above the river bed was built without interrupting rail traffic by interlacing the structure of the new bridge with the old and upon completion, dismantling the old and retaining only the original abutments on either side. The official opening ceremony was performed on 23 June 1928 by the mayor of Grahamstown, Clr J C Rae, MPC, in the presence of the mayors of Port Alfred and Bathurst. Heavier rolling stock could now complete the journey to Port Alfred from distant centres without passengers having to change coaches at Grahamstown.\n\n(*Spelling of Blaauwkrantz was changed to Bloukrans in 1953).\n\nReferences:\n\nBrinkman, B., ‘The Kowie Railway’, SA Rail, Vol.39, No.4, 1999, pp.185-189\n\nBurman, J., ‘Early railways at the Cape’, 1984\n\nBezuidenhout, B.
