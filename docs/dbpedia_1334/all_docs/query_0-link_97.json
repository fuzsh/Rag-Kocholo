        "text": "1, 3, 7, 12, 15 October 2018 – Seek ye first, victorious, Joshua 1:9\n\nI have seriously neglected my Bible study over the last two years and every time I hear Matthew 6:33 – seek ye first the Kingdom of God – it feels like God is reminding me to get back to my studies. To put Him first and foremost. There are a few things that the Lord has explicitly told me to do, which I am seriously neglecting: my quiet time study of His Word and exercising.\n\nThe pace of life is so hectic, that our priorities sometimes end up with the most important things at the bottom of the list and more often not getting it done at all.\n\nFor months I have been out of routine. I would work through the night and sleep late during the day. Always tired, always stressed. Highly strung.\n\nIt is not the life Jesus wants us to live. It is not what He died on the cross for. He died so we may be free from sin, free from stress and to live a life of abundance. Abundance does not necessarily mean plenty of material goods, but instead, it means to be content with whatever God has given us.\n\nThe world’s idea of success is money, power and nice things but in the end, none of that will matter. To live peaceably with fellow human beings and with God – yes, when we moan and gripe, we are not at peace with what God has given us – then we are successful. It is a lot easier said than done though. We have hopes, dreams and expectations and when these are not fulfilled, we are hurt and confused and sometimes even angry with God for not giving us the desires of our hearts.\n\nI have learned that when we get to that point, it is time to shift our minds into a different gear. To renew our minds and set it upon all that is lovely, all that God has given – those things we so easily take for granted, like still being alive and able to function – and to focus on verses that tell us how absolutely in LOVE God is with us. The nasty old devil wants to convince us that God is punishing us, but He is not. He loves us and has the best in mind for us. Sometimes He waits to give us the desires of our hearts only when He knows that the timing is right.\n\nBut while we wait, we must pour ourselves into His Word and put Him first in all we do. We must Matthew 6:33 every day – But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.\n\nThe well-known speaker and life coach Tony Robbins say in one of his seminars: It is not what we do once in a while that brings about change. It is what we do consistently.\n\nWe complain with God that we want certain things, yet we fail to consistently seek Him first. I will go as far as saying that many Christians are not good stewards in seeking Him first and this in itself blocks us from receiving “all these things” that shall be added unto us. I am not saying that it is the only reason why God will sometimes withhold gifts to us, but it certainly is one of the reasons because He does not want us to have idols in our hearts and when we put anything before Him, then it is an idol.\n\nWhile I am typing this, the Fireproof song by John Waller – While I am waiting – comes to mind. While we wait on God, we must keep on seeking Him first in all we do.\n\nWhile I’m Waiting – John Waller\n\nI’m waiting, I’m waiting on You Lord\n\nAnd I am hopeful, I’m waiting on You Lord\n\nThough it is painful, but patiently I will wait\n\nAnd I will move ahead bold and confident\n\nTaking every step in obedience\n\nWhile I’m waiting I will serve You\n\nWhile I’m waiting I will worship\n\nWhile I’m waiting I will not faint\n\nI’ll be running the race even while I wait\n\nI’m waiting, I’m waiting on You Lord\n\nAnd I am peaceful, I’m waiting on You Lord\n\nThough it’s not easy no, but faithfully I will wait\n\nYes, I will wait\n\nAnd I will move ahead bold and confident\n\nTaking every step in obedience\n\nWhile I’m waiting I will serve You\n\nWhile I’m waiting I will worship\n\nWhile I’m waiting I will not faint\n\nI’ll be running the race even while I wait\n\nI will move ahead bold and confident\n\nI’ll be taking every step in obedience, yeah\n\nWhile I’m waiting I will serve You\n\nWhile I’m waiting I will worship\n\nWhile I’m waiting I will not faint\n\nAnd I will serve You while I’m waiting\n\nI will worship while I’m waiting\n\nI will serve You while I’m waiting\n\nI will worship while I’m waiting\n\nI will serve You while I’m waiting\n\nI will worship while I’m waiting on You Lord\n\nI will serve You while I’m waiting\n\nI will worship while I’m waiting\n\nI will serve You while I’m waiting\n\nI will worship while I’m waiting\n\nThe word victor popped up in a song – I did not catch the name or artist – and I was again reminded that no matter how much I might feel like a failure in this world, through Christ we are more than conquerors. We are victorious overcomers. The battle was won when Jesus died and rose again. And in Christ, we have the victory.\n\nJust after that Ray Legodi on Radio Pulpit quoted Joshua 1:9 in which God tells us to take courage. Just like Joshua inherited the land of Canaan, the Christians will inherit the Kingdom of God.\n\n2 October 2018 – Faithful in the small things, see what God is doing\n\nWaiting long for God’s promises to be fulfilled, sometimes has a tendency to make us blunt. Despondent. Yet, we have to run the race flat out and remain faithful even in the small things before God can entrust bigger things to us. The Lord has reminded me of this, throughout 2018. And several times in the last few years. On this day, it came through Christine Ferreira’s discussion with Ronel Bezuidenhout on Radio Pulpit.\n\nThe message for the day, on our youth group, contained the same message.\n\nFurthermore, the Word for Today was about seeing what God is doing in our lives. It refers to Moses and how God called him from the burning bush. It also encourages us to not miss God’s calling on our lives. He would often, out of the blue (or a burning bush) call us on a specific day and our lives will change forever.\n\nBut we have to pay attention, or we may miss it. It is one of the very important reasons I keep a diary.\n\n3 October 2018 – Listening for God’s voice\n\nThe Word for Today is about listening for God’s voice.\n\nMany people believe that God stopped talking to His children and that the only way He now talks to us, is through the Bible. However, I completely disagree with this.\n\nThe Bible teaches us that God is the same yesterday, today and forever. Furthermore, the Lord spoke to the very first man, woman and child on earth thousands of years ago. And for thousands of years after, He continued to speak to mankind.\n\nThere is a period between the books of Malachi and Matthew where it appears as though God did not speak to His people and many sermons are preached on this.\n\nWith this also, I do not agree. It cannot be proved that God did not speak to anyone during that time. I think that God spoke to individuals, but no one was instructed to record anything He said or perhaps it was recorded, but it was nothing God wanted to preserve for us today.\n\nBesides God speaking in the Old Testament and through Jesus while He lived on earth, there are also referrals of the Holy Spirit speaking in the New Testament.\n\nLuke 12:12 for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.”\n\nAct 8:29 And the Spirit said to Philip, “Go over and join this chariot.”\n\nAct 10:19 And while Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Behold, three men are looking for you.\n\nAct 11:12 And the Spirit told me to go with them, making no distinction. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man’s house.\n\nAct 11:28 And one of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world (this took place in the days of Claudius).\n\nAct 13:2 While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.”\n\nAct 20:23 except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me.\n\nAct 21:4 And having sought out the disciples, we stayed there for seven days. And through the Spirit they were telling Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.\n\nAct 21:11 And coming to us, he took Paul’s belt and bound his own feet and hands and said, “Thus says the Holy Spirit, ‘This is how the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.’”\n\n1Ti 4:1 Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons,\n\nRev 2:7 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.’\n\nRev 2:11 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who conquers will not be hurt by the second death.’\n\nRev 2:17 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, with a new name written on the stone that no one knows except the one who receives it.’\n\nRev 2:29 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’\n\nRev 3:6 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’\n\nRev 3:13 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’\n\nRev 3:22 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’”\n\nRev 14:13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.” “Blessed indeed,” says the Spirit, “that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them!”\n\nRev 22:17 The Spirit and the Bride say, “Come.” And let the one who hears say, “Come.” And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the water of life without price.\n\nRom 8:16 The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,\n\nFrom the verses above it is clear that the Holy Spirit, who was sent by the Father as Jesus said He would be, speaks to us and will keep on speaking to us. The Bible says that He speaks – it is not a mime show where the Holy Spirit is present but we do not hear Him.\n\nSome of those who do not believe that the Holy Spirit still speaks to us, have a tendency to think it is mostly Charismatic types that experience Him speaking, however, that is not true. Many Christians across all denominations report on hearing the voice of the Holy Spirit.\n\nI agree that there is much deception and some people are hearing voices other than that of the Holy Spirit. That is why it is so important to be in the Word of God as much as possible and to trust God for discernment.\n\nDr. Michelle Strydom gives extensive teaching on how evil forces communicate with people through theta brainwave activity. She further explains how to discern the source of the communication we receive. We should discern the source of all communication, whether it is internal or external such as another person, or any form of media. Because other forms of communication can also be inspired by evil forces, though they may come across as pure and from God.\n\nIt is a very fine line.\n\nJesus said: “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name? And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’\n\nAlso, Proverbs 14:12 states that there is a way that looks right to a man, but its end is destruction. “ There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death.”\n\nTherefore, I can not emphasize enough, how important discernment is.\n\nOur spirit should always testify alongside the Holy Spirit and when we feel uneasy in our spirit because something goes against God’s Word, we should adhere to it and react accordingly.\n\nThat, in turn, is why it is vital to STUDY God’s Word. Systematically. Reading a verse here and there does not supply the sustenance one needs for healthy spiritual living and knowledge of the Word. Out of my nine years of Bible study, five of those were done chronologically and it has helped me immensely to retain information. When I started chronologically studying the Bible, it suddenly came alive. The boredom of Kings and Chronicles with the many names and genealogies became interesting and realistic. Reading the Bible from book to book was confusing. King David was alive, then he passed away, then he wrote a psalm. When studying chronologically, the life of David was followed as it progressed, with the psalms he wrote, in between.\n\nEvery Christian should read the Bible chronologically, at least once in a lifetime. My chronological list of the Old Testament is below this, should you wish to download it. It must be read left to right, from top to bottom. I marked off every section after finishing it, so I did not get confused.\n\nChronological Order of The Bible – Old Testament\n\nIn addition to studying the Bible chronologically, I also make notes on a sheet of topics I wish to study for example when John 3:16 came up, I would make a note and number it to study the word “love” and all its aspects. From E-sword I would pull all verses containing the word love and I would study the various Greek formats of that word. I would make a note to study the word “begotten” and add a number to it. Then I would note the word “whosoever” and study all aspects of that.\n\nIt is a slow study process but it is thorough and very rewarding.\n\nDuring these studies, the Lord has spoken to me a lot through His Word. He has given me a lot of revelation and often news and other events would apply to sections that I was busy studying at that time.\n\n4, 5, 12 October 2018 – Washing of water by the Word, renew our thoughts, heart of flesh, Don’t Try to Force It\n\nEphesians 5:25 – 27 says “Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave Himself for it; that He might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,\n\nthat He might present it to Himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.”\n\nThe part “washing of water by the Word” came up several times this week and Holy Spirit pointed it out to me. Also to renew our minds, as well as the verse that God will take out the heart of stone and give a heart of flesh came up several times.\n\nThe Lord reaffirmed once again that we can not renew our thoughts unless we study His Word. Taking in the Word is what cleanses us and renews our minds. Failing to do so will result in the exact opposite and the danger of people drifting away and getting weak in the faith. Especially with the times we live in, it is most crucial to be grounded in the Word of God.\n\nNot only as individuals but as congregations and it is important for teachers to teach pure Biblical doctrine for the church to remain sanctified and cleansed.\n\nThe Word for Today of 5 October was yet again a powerful message very applicable to myself. Having waited so long for things to happen in my life, I tend to sometimes want to force them to happen instead of just letting God do it in His perfect time.\n\n5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 14 October 2018 – Ruth\n\nOver several days, the name Ruth came up numerous times and my attention was drawn to it.\n\nI felt as though God was calling my name. Calling me to attention.\n\nOn the 5th, I turned the Book of Ruth on for bedtime. I very often have the audio Bible playing quietly while I sleep. Though I am not cognitively processing the information, I believe that my mind still takes it in.\n\nThis specific night I felt like listening to the Book of Ruth. I do not often listen to it, but this night I chose her story.\n\nOn the 6th on Radio Pulpit, Berni Dymet’s insert was about Ruth. The part where she insisted on staying with Naomi and how God blessed her for honoring her mother-in-law.\n\nOn the 9th Joyce Meyer said in her insert over Radio Pulpit: “where are the Esthers and the Ruths?”\n\nDuring the sermon on the 14th, mention was made of the obedience of Ruth and what we learn from that.\n\nOn the 10th I noted a few significant numbers and parallels that I picked up about my life:\n\nMy calling happens in 2019 and in this year it is\n\n7 years since God showed me what my calling is. Seven is the number of perfection.\n\nMy mother was born in 1949, which means she would have turned 70 this year\n\nIt is 10 years since her passing away\n\nVanderbijlpark, the town that I have lived in for the most part of my time in the Vaal Triangle, was established in 1949 – the same year as my mother’s birth year and also 70 years ago.\n\nI have been staying in the Vaal Triangle for 21 years – which is what was considered adulthood/maturity for many years in the past – before it was changed to the age of 18 in South Africa.\n\nI could not help getting the feeling that God had orchestrated all this as a means of showing me that indeed my time has come.\n\nOn the 11th I picked up on Radio Pulpit, but I did not note who said it, the verse which says that my times are in God’s hands. I considered that as the confirmation of God’s planning of my life.\n\nI also noted that the theme the entire week was about overcoming fear, to trust God, to forgive and to renew my mind.\n\n8 October 2018 – Strength for Speakers\n\nThis day’s Word for Today is an encouraging message for those who address large scores of people. I made a point of remembering the phrase “ you can’t fill an empty bucket from a dry well”\n\nIt is important to always stay tapped-in into the Word of God. Pun intended.\n\n9, 10 October 2018 – Doulos, Amos 3:7, representatives\n\nOn these two days, the word doulos appeared twice and Holy Spirit pointed it out to me with a friendly reminder to always have a servant’s heart.\n\nAlso, Holy Spirit again pointed out Amos 3:7 – Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but He revealeth His secret unto His servants the prophets.\n\nAlso, Fanie Coetzer’s insert on Radio Pulpit referred to us representing God and His DNA here on earth.\n\nhttps://www.galileeministry.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Daybreak-101018.mp3\n\n14, 15 October 2018 – Understanding our Heavenly Father\n\nSeeing God as our Father is beautifully explained in this two-part piece from Word for Today.\n\n16 October 2018 – Your talents\n\nOn this afternoon, Tania Strauss’ insert specifically referred to how we manage our lives and our talents. The part that stood out for me was “talents”.\n\nAgain I felt like God was prompting me to apply one of the beautiful talents He had given to my entire family: music.\n\nSinging is my forté and what I like doing most. I have not played piano in many years and I know I need to pick up on it again, soon.\n\nAs for singing, I knew I had to sing something soon, just to get started. No matter how out of practice I am, I just had to get it done. I needed to break the ice, since 2012 when I stopped singing.\n\n23 October 2018 – Wake up South Africa, wake up!\n\nJust as I woke this morning, the following words gripped my heart: Wake up South Africa, wake up!\n\nI felt God saying that South Africans had to open up their eyes to the deceit that was going on all around, even in churches and false Christianity.\n\n1 November 2018 – Do not want to ask anymore\n\nOn this day, I wanted to ask God for something – a desire of my heart – but I just felt that I did not even want to ask for anything anymore out of fear that the answer would again be “no” or “wait”.\n\nBut immediately Holy Spirit brought to remembrance the parable of the widow who kept on nagging and nagging the judge until he conceded to her request.\n\nKeep asking and keep trusting. God’s word is for real and His promises true. It will happen if He said so.\n\n2 November 2018 – Knowing God’s will is powerful\n\nThe Word for Today’s bit was about Knowing God’s Will and how powerful it is.\n\nTo this, I can testify wholeheartedly. Since God revealed His calling upon my life in 2012, I have been able to cope better with the issues of this life. It is still difficult sometimes, but God is not a man that He should lie. What He says He will do, He does.\n\n7 November 2018 – CCMA, freedom, reconcile, settle the matter and Stradivarius\n\nMy CCMA case’s final hearing was on this day. I did not sleep well, was tired and overwhelmed.\n\nOn Radio Pulpit, some of Johann Els very first words were: “come now, let us settle the matter” as in Isaiah 1:18 (NIV).\n\nA little later, Johann said that I have the peace of reconciliation and he also referred to being “declared innocent”.\n\nThe Word for Today was referring to being free from religious bondage and the word free and freedom came up several times on this day.\n\nGustav Gouws on Radio Pulpit after that used the word reconciliation and freedom.\n\nAfter that Janine and Wynand were talking about Stradivari and how they produced their Stradivarius instruments. How the beaten up wood, produced a beautiful sound.\n\nThat hit my heart with a loud thud. If they spoke of it on any other day, it would have been different. But on this day, where I wanted my innocence proven, it meant a lot to me. It reminded me of my calling, as a late bloomer and all of God’s promises to me.\n\nAfter that, a young man named Henko spoke of his testimony and my ear caught the part where he said: I just had peace. Peace comes with reconciliation.\n\nAfter that Psalm 105:7 came up:\n\nPsalm 105:17 – He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:\n\nPsalm 105:17 Hy het ‘n man voor hulle uit gestuur: Josef is as slaaf verkoop.\n\nWhen I hear the story of Joseph, it reminds me so much of my own story. The very big dreams God had for him, the unbelief and envy of his brothers, the hardship it took to get to his calling and the time that it took to get there.\n\nI set out to Vereeniging for my CCMA case, sure and confident that I will win. After all, I have truth and all God’s promises on my side.\n\nhttps://www.galileeministry.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Daybreak-071118.mp3\n\n8 November 2018 – You must know your life’s purpose\n\nIn this Word for Today, it is made clear how important it is to know your life’s purpose to do what God requires from you. Not knowing, will result in likely doing the wrong things.\n\n10 November 2018 – Work as though unto the Lord, God is your provider\n\nOn this day, Janine van Niekerk on Radio Pulpit was talking about how employees should protect employers’ interest by working diligently as though working unto the Lord. Since being born again, this has always been my motto. Even though my employer does not see what I do during work hours, God sees. Am I honoring God with my work?\n\nMany Christians spend way too much time on social media for personal matters daily during work hours – which is stealing company time. And God clearly says in His Ten Commandments that we may not steal.\n\nI am confident that when I stand before God, this is one aspect on which I will be rewarded. I take work very seriously and give my best.\n\nOften throughout our lives, it seems as though things do not work out the way we want them to.\n\nMany of the figures in the Bible had the same problem. However, Romans 8:28 cannot be any clearer: “And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.”\n\nThis was the message by The Word for Today.\n\nAt the time I did not know how much I will be leaning on that scripture and this message from God in the days that followed.\n\n13 November 2018 – Get real with God\n\nIt amazes me how I and many other Christians that I am aware of, sometimes think God does not see or know the deepest motivations of our hearts. He knows everything, we can hide nothing.\n\nThis Word for Today is a stark reminder of this and a call to some serious self-examination.\n\n[clear]\n\n16 November 2018 – Family who do not talk\n\nI was upset with my sister, for not reacting to any of my messages and I blocked her on Whatsapp. But the conviction to unblock her was too great to resist. I unblocked her and when we spoke, she gave me shocking news – but only a tiny portion of it.\n\nI did not have the full picture until January 2019.\n\nhttps://www.galileeministry.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Brandpunt-16-Nov-2018-Restoring-Family-Ties.mp3\n\n17, 18 November 2018 – Doorn Créche and God’s Bloomin’ Message\n\nSpecial spiritual occasions are noted in my diary and I celebrate them each year. This year, the 17th of November was the first celebration of my going to Doorn Créche and being delivered of a lifetime of bondage.\n\nThe 18th was the first year that I celebrated God’s Blooming message to me, which was kicked off by Pastor Peter at church.\n\n19, 21 November 2018 – 2017 Prophecy over SA by Dr Jonathan David\n\nOn the 19th of November, I received a prophecy from Bulelani of New Nation Movement but only listened to it on the 21st.\n\nThis prophecy was given in November 2016.\n\nThe prophecy was by Dr Jonathan David and it contained the following info as in the audio and typed up below:\n\nhttps://www.galileeministry.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Prophecy-over-South-Africa-2017-REDUCED.mp3\n\nPoint 1 – Peoples Movement\n\nCompany of people across the world will come together\n\nThe rise of a new people movement inspired by the Holy Ghost (perhaps New Nation Movement?)\n\nA new dimension that is causing all nationalities to come together\n\n5 Things concerning South Africa\n\nAn inspired prayer movement that will take place – all nationalities will partake (It’s Time?)\n\nAfrica is going to change\n\nGod is going to cause South Africa to be the inspiration in the heart of the Africa continent\n\nHe refers to Cape Hope (it reminded me of Fire Trails in 2010 – a movement brought to life by Elza Meyer. At the start of this prayer campaign, three arrows were shot from Table Mountain in the Cape of Good Hope Northward symbolically into into Africa. One arrow for the East, one for the West and one for the centre of Africa. Someone recently mentioned trains that went in those directions. I do not recall the trains, but I do recall that teams went out in each direction, visiting towns on its path).\n\nSpirit lead people rising\n\nUnited by the cause for the Lord, God is leading the movement – no human leader. (The word Theocracy has come up several times in the last few years and my understanding of that is that God will raise up leaders, in the same way He rose the Judges in Biblical times. A Theocracy is the opposite of a Democracy where people vote. In a Theocracy people do not vote as in a democracy as it – a Theocracy – is similar to a kingdom and in this case Jesus will be the King. Theocracy is derived from the Greek word, which means God in the same way as Theology means “study of God”.)\n\nGod is calling all peoples in unity in Him\n\nGod will bring covenant breakers into judgment\n\nSpirit lead appointment centered people movement in South Africa\n\nPoint 2 – Prayer\n\nHoly Spirit will create tremendous power of prayer\n\nNo weapons of war, but the weapon of prayer\n\nIn many nations of Africa\n\nThe people of South Africa will pursue the same purpose and be committed to each other\n\nThere will be no fear\n\nPoint 3 – Violence will be stopped\n\nA transformation will happen, without guns\n\nThe cursed ground will be changed\n\nHe speaks of a prayer meeting of one million people where the sound has a three minutes delay – all of heaven responds and all of hell trembles\n\nEvil strongholds will be brought down in cities\n\nGod is going to do an amazing work – terror won’t come by night, everyone will have a share\n\nPoint 4 – Streams will merge into a river, churches will change\n\nHardest one to happen, there are men standing in high place in the spiritual kingdom in churches who are trying to prevent this from happening, but God will remove them one by one.\n\n2017 is the year of God’s government coming into South Africa\n\nDenomination lines will break, the common denominator will be the indwelling Holy Spirit\n\nThere will be a lot resistance in churches saying it is politics, but this is church, but the righteous will be chosen, the Christian concensus will take over to bring the victory\n\nFrom now until the election in 2019 the gap has to be breached\n\nSouth Africa almost the last nation to come into the race (a late bloomer)\n\nFind your lost brother, South African revival is about to break out, the minds of people are going to change\n\nLet’s set the house in order\n\nThis revival is amazing because God will rise from the inside\n\nHe will deal swiftly with the Godless\n\nSomething supernatural is going to happen\n\nSouth Africa is going to be a model for Africa and other places\n\nLight will be coming slowly from South Africa and spread all the way\n\nPoint 5 – God will hold the currency\n\nThis is my Proverbs 1:14, 15 testimony of 2012 – throw in your lot among us; we will all have one purse”— my son, do not walk in the way with them; hold back your foot from their paths,”. South Africa will not partake in the global one world currency, but of God’s currency.\n\nThe economy of this country will grow steadier and steadier, unexplained. God is the God of the currencies.\n\nThe currency of the South African is a people’s movement based on prayer, they will turn their weapons of war into agritural equipment (My testimony of 2014 of Isaiah 2:4, 5 – He shall judge between the nations, and shall decide disputes for many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore. O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the LORD.)\n\nThe movement that will start, will be co-ordinated by the Holy Spirit to unite men and women\n\nYour days of waiting is coming to an end, the day of the answer is coming (my 2018 testimony of February = 06 + 05 + 08 = 19)\n\nThis is not the time to run away or be afraid\n\nGod will push back the spirit of darkness, no weapen against us will prosper\n\nThe Word of the Lord will go forth and all the nations of the world will listen\n\nThe way God will do it so quickly, that their hope will rise in all of Africa (my Habakkuk 2:3 testimony of December 2015 under the James Bond – Spectre heading: “For still the vision awaits its appointed time; it hastens to the end–it will not lie. If it seems slow, wait for it; it will surely come; it will not delay.” When it happens, it will happen quickly and suddenly)\n\nSouth Africa must rise, God is giving priority to this nation, your time has come\n\nThe kingdoms of the world will become the Kingdom of our Christ and He will reign forever\n\nThe church has a major role\n\nGod will make it up to Africa (Joel 2:25 – “I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter, my great army, which I sent among you.” During my study of the Old Testament, when I came to this verse, I experienced the Lord telling me that as a late bloomer, I must not look at the years lost, for He will restore it. In my 2015 testimony with the heading “Also in 2015 – Africa’s stunted growth” I experienced that, like me, Africa should not look at the years lost, for the Lord will restore it.)\n\nPrayer will be restored in schools, Bibles will be handed out freely\n\n20 November 2018 – Leader, here’s God’s way\n\nThe Word for Today on this day was giving valuable advice on delegating tasks and not doing it all single-handedly.\n\n22 November 2018 – You will get back more than you give, LOST!!!\n\nOn this morning, I received a notification of the outcome of my CCMA case. The decision was in favour of the employee.\n\nI lost my case.\n\nI was devastated. Something inside me broke.\n\nBut I knew I had to look beyond the here and now and keep on trusting God, no matter what.\n\nHowever, it gets difficult at times to keep on failing and failing and failing at everything. Proverbs 13:12 says – “Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a desire fulfilled is a tree of life.”\n\nThere are days that my heart feels like it is in ICU.\n\nOn this day, the Word for Today mentions that we will get more than we give. Even though I feel now like I am losing at EVERYTHING, I hold on to the promises of God and I know He will give me more than I give and make up for all my losses.\n\n23 November 2018 – Trust God’s unchanging character\n\nAfter receiving the outcome of my CCMA case, I felt devastated. When I read the Word for Today, I felt that it was God’s way of telling me to trust His decision and to trust Him completely.\n\nIn the days that followed, I was crying to God: why, Lord? I was so sure I would win my case because You gave me Deuteronomy 28:7 that my enemies will flee before me, so many times.\n\nThe Lord’s response to me was: “Yes, Deuteronomy 28:7 – just not yet.” I was reminded of my calling and it made sense that God might be reserving this outcome for a time that I am positioned in my calling.\n\n24 November 2018 – Singing in church\n\nSo the day came that I did a solo at church – ill-prepared and having the slightest sound problem, it went down not exactly as I had hoped. But the ice was broken and I need to practice daily – which I have not done for months to follow and need to implement again. I need to use my talents.\n\n26 November 2018 – Give thanks to God in all circumstances, The Napalm Girl\n\nThis morning on Pulpit, Joyce Meyer was saying that we are to stop murmuring and to thank God in everything, no matter what the circumstances. To give thanks to God and not\n\nThis morning on Pulpit, Joyce Meyer was saying that we are to stop murmuring and to thank God in everything, no matter what the circumstances. To give thanks to God and not take people for granted.\n\nJust after that was Focus on the Family and the team had an interview with Kim Phuc, a Vietnamese woman whose village was bombed in 1972 by the Vietnamese government when she was a young girl. The bombs contained a substance called napalm, which burns the skin when it comes into contact with it. Almost like acid would.\n\nI remember as a child, seeing the award-winning picture of Kim Phuc, dubbed The Napalm Girl, as she was running naked through the street, while her skin was being burned by the napalm. At that time I was roughly the same age as she was when it happened and the memory of this stuck in my mind to this very day.\n\nAfter hearing her testimony, I Googled her and thanks to Wikipedia for the info posted below.\n\nDuring her interview with Focus, she was telling of the constant pain that she still endured from the burns, as well as the numerous operations she has had and still had to have.\n\nDespite that, she turned to Christianity and is serving God with her whole being.\n\nShe gives thanks to God in everything and has a platform for sharing her faith.\n\nWe so easily gripe and complain – I often battle with complaints. Then I try to remind myself of Paul and Silas singing praises to God at midnight, after having been beaten and in pain and in chains in prison.\n\nMany Christians of this day, specifically in Western cultures, do not face persecution nearly this bad. Yet we are quick to complain about how unfair life is, our faith is fickle and rests on circumstances of the moment, rather than what Jesus has done for us and that He is coming back to get us for eternity.\n\nIt is in the most trying times that I discovered how strong my faith really is. Sometimes I would have doubts and be filled with fear, but God would pick me up and renew my strength and He ALWAYS comes through for me at His good time.\n\nWe should pray the Lord to give us faith in abundance for the time of persecution is coming. And we should learn to trust Him fully. That in turn, makes it much easier to give thanks at all times.\n\nThanks to Wikipedia for the info and Getty Images for the image of Kim Phuc below.\n\n28 November 2018 – Now I know why, Get up and try again\n\nFor almost ten years, it had bothered me that I was not at my mother’s bed when she passed away. I had gone to the front door to have a cigarette (during my smoking days). I was not looking at the clock at that time and had no idea how late it was.\n\nStanding at the front door, the hooters, crackers and cheering people increased and I realised that it was midnight. I flicked away the cigarette and ran to my mother’s room, to find that she had just breathed out her last. I walked over to her and closed her eyes – it had just happened.\n\nAt midnight, just as God said it would.\n\nHad I been in the room at that time, I would have focused on my mother and would not have noticed the time and that she passed away right at midnight as God said. So for the first time in ten years, I had peace about not having been right there when it happened.\n\nThe Word for Today was about persevering. It states that we will be rewarded for what we finish, not what we start.\n\n29 November 2018 – The Lord shall guide me\n\nDuring this time of confusion, God was faithful to remind me that He is leading me and my life is in His hands, all the time. Not just some of the time, or on certain days, but ALL of the time. And when our lives are in His very capable hands, we are safe. Walking on water amidst a storm does not always appear to be safe but when we do it with our eyes on Jesus, then it is safe.\n\nIsaiah 58:11 – And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.\n\nJesaja 58:11 – En die HERE sal jou gedurigdeur lei en jou siel versadig in dor plekke en jou gebeente sterk maak; en jy sal wees soos ‘n tuin wat goed besproei is en soos ‘n fontein van waters waarvan die water nooit teleurstel nie.\n\n30 November 2018 – A willing heart, Dont lose your passion\n\nOn this morning on Radio Pulpit, Derek Prince talked about Malachi 4:6 on his insert. I had read this verse earlier the week, as well as the verse about fathers not exasperating their children. Derek also said that God can only change us if we have willing hearts. The Bible speaks clearly about stubbornness and how it displeases God.\n\nThe Word for Today was also a reminder that God has a plan and it states that if we line up our passion with God’s plan, there will be no stopping us. It also says: “if you are down today, get back up. If you failed, try again.”\n\nber / December 2018 – Severe hail storms worldwide\n\nThroughout November and December messages of severe thunderstorms across South Africa were spread via the media. Photos and videos circulated. Also in other parts of the world. Hail storms like none people have ever experienced.\n\nI could not help but wonder how much of it was done by HAARP and similar technologies. Some countries are experts in weather manipulation.\n\nFor that very reason I just love when the educated people say that a country is experiencing an El Nino weather phenomenon and that there will be a drought. As what happened in the Western Cape of South Africa. The dams dried up and day zero for water supply came closer. The educated people said it would take five years to fill the dams again. Then came the rain and day zero is no longer a concern. Though our fellow countrymen and women in the Cape still have to use water sparingly, the worst of the threat is over.\n\nThe weather people say El Nino and the Christians say El Shaddai!\n\nSeeing the media on all these hail storms, reminded me of a verse in the Bible – Revelation 16:21\n\n21 And great hailstones, about one hundred pounds each, fell from heaven on people; and they cursed God for the plague of the hail, because the plague was so severe.\n\nI received the other images via Whatsapp and do not know who to credit.\n\nHail storm in the Vaal Triangle:\n\nHail storm at Sun City:\n\nHail storms in Australia – thanks to Google:\n\nI can not help but wonder how many of these natural disasters are from God, as people call it “acts of God” and how many are done by humanity through the manipulation of the weather by institutions such as HAARP in Canada and those in Russia, China and the United Arab Emirates. The weather has been manipulated for years and when we mess with nature, it has a bad way of blowing up in our faces. It reminds me of the movie, ‘Cloudy with a chance of meatballs’. But then again, movies are often based on reality, though they make it look like fiction or give a fictitious twist to it. That again brings me to global warming and whether it is real or only propaganda, like so much else. Or perhaps intensified weather manipulation in specific areas across the globe to make people believe it is global warming. There is a much bigger picture to global warming.\n\nThanks to WikiPedia for the info below:\n\n4, 14 December 2018 – Slaying giants, Seek ye first\n\nAfter the morning devotion, Johann Els of Radio Pulpit said: “you will slay giants”. He also quoted Matthew 6:33 and Genesis 12:1 – Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will show thee:\n\nWhen we are obedient to God like Abraham was and we seek Him first as Matthew 6:33 says and we trust Him completely, He will enable us to slay giants. To be victors over our circumstances and over satan and his evil forces.\n\n4, 5 December 2018 – Look at the birds\n\nThen there is always the worry over financial matters. God’s constant way of reminding me of His provision is Matthew 6:26 – Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?\n\nThis verse popped up several times over a few days and God reminded me that He WILL take care of me. He always takes care of His children. He is a good, kind, loving, heavenly Father.\n\n4, 5, 6 December 2018 – A time such as this\n\nI was very frustrated with my life and the fact that it feels like I am getting nowhere. The last few weeks were trying and my faith was dwindling. “What am I here for?” “Why am I even still here?” It feels as though my life is going in pointless circles and I have no purpose.\n\nWhen I got into bed, I turned on the audio Bible and I was listening to Esther. My ear caught the verse about Esther being born and placed as queen for a time such as this.\n\nThe next day around noon, the thought came to me very clearly; I am here for a time such as this. However insignificant I feel now, there will come a time that I will help many people and touch many lives. The way this thought arose, was not from my head, but from my heart. As though God wanted to make sure I grasped that fact.\n\nThe next day, on Radio Pulpit, Derek Prince also spoke of Esther and specifically said: “for a time such as this”. He also said: “Rise to the position God elevated you to. Esther’s intercession shaped the future, we should do the same.”\n\nI know God’s plans for my life and I must hold on to them. But some days I feel like giving up. It is taking so long. For that very reason, God keeps reminding me.\n\n5 December 2018 – Pack, you are moving, Are you at breaking point\n\nSome time early in December – I did not note the date – God very clearly said to me: “Pack, you are moving”.\n\nMy response: “Please Lord, not before Christmas. I don’t want to be uprooted before Christmas. I have clients to tend to over that period and … it just is not a good time to move. Please not before Christmas. I promise I will start sorting my stuff out and get ready to move before the end of the year.”\n\nGod’s response: “Good.”\n\nSo Christmas came and went and by the end of the year, I had only sorted my toolbox and not all the other things I promised I would.\n\nThe Word for Today is about reaching a breaking point and how God sometimes allows it, so we may go to Him for guidance and strength.\n\n]\n\n12 December 2018 – Keep believing God, it will happen\n\nThere are certain things I have prayed and asked God for, but they are taking so long to come to fruition. The Word for Today was a powerful reminder to me to keep the faith, trust God and BELIEVE every single promise He made. It will happen. God is not a man that He should lie.\n\nAlso quoted in today’s piece is Habakkuk 2:3 – For still the vision awaits its appointed time; it hastens to the end–it will not lie. If it seems slow, wait for it; it will surely come; it will not delay.\n\n13 December 2018 – Live\n\nThe Word for Today is a powerful reminder that age does not matter to God. Here I am, worried that my life is rushing by, but to God it does not matter. He will use the years of experience and He will Joel 2:25 – I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter, my great army, which I sent among you.\n\nAfter all my setbacks, it seemed as though God was making sure I hold on to Him. Many times I felt like letting go, but He kept reminding me of His promises.\n\nJust wait a little longer.\n\n6, 17, 19 December 2018 – My life partner\n\nNot only were my doubts growing in terms of my calling, but again also in terms of my life partner. My husband. I know God had chosen a man for me. I saw him and have been praying for him in all earnest, for the last two years. But nothing came of it.\n\nI was about to give up (again). To stop praying and asking. Then on 6 December on Radio Pulpit Rhona Zwarts was being interviewed and she made the statement in Afrikaans about her husband: “My beminde was vir my gekies.” (My beloved was chosen for me).\n\nIt reminded me of the man God had chosen for me and that I just had to hold on and keep believing like Abraham and Sarah.\n\nLater that afternoon, I was working through one of the teachings of Stephen Bohr and in it he quoted the verse about man not separating what God put together.\n\nOn the 17th on Radio Pulpit Joyce Meyer was saying: “how many times can I be the bridesmaid and survive it?” Over the years, out of frustration, I used to complain that I am always the bridesmaid, never the bride. She continued telling how perfect God’s timing is. I knew it was God’s way of telling me to hold on.\n\nOn the 19th on Radio Pulpit, Gustav Gouws was giving his motivational talk and he was saying that we are to trust God in everything and he specifically made mention of who to marry.\n\nDespite all this encouragement, I felt myself slipping into a deep pit of despondency. My heart was dying a slow death. I was so ready to give up. Proverbs 13:12 Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a desire fulfilled is a tree of life.\n\nNo amount of trying to muster up hope seemed to work anymore. My heart was in the state of Proverbs13:12 – sick, critical, dying.\n\n16 December 2018 – Stop procrastinating!\n\nProcrastination has been a problem for me for many years. Sometimes I feel so overwhelmed and inundated with trying to survive that I grab and then let go of things halfway done and I feel like I am getting nowhere. This could very well be a symptom of procrastination and the Word for Today had a clear message on the importance of not procrastinating. It also mentions: “’Today’ is the tomorrow you were talking about yesterday.”\n\n17 December 2018 – Christ in us, To Teach\n\nIn this morning’s devotion on Radio Pulpit, Wynand Rossouw was quoting the verse about Christ in us. This verse is very dear to my heart. He was also saying that we are to be salt and light in the world. He then quoted Ps 51:14 and 15, but in the ESV it is verses 13 and 14 – “Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.” This verse is my life mission. To teach people the ways of God.\n\n19 December 2018 – Changing careers at 40, Do not FRET, Great and hidden things, Seek ye first, 2019, victorious\n\nThis morning, it felt like God was talking just to me. With all my questions and doubts, the message was aimed right at me. Gustav Gouws was giving his weekly inspirational message in which he encouraged us to trust God in everything. He specifically mentioned who to marry as well as changing careers at the age of forty.\n\nFor about two years now, I have known that I will be moving away from doing business to something else and I believe that 2019 is the year that it will happen and that I will change careers in my forties.\n\nJust after 8 am, the birthday message was done and the verses given were Matthew 6:33 – to seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness and also Jeremiah 33:3 – Call to me and I will answer you, and will tell you great and hidden things that you have not known. Wynand Rossouw then commented that 2019 will be a mind-blowing year.\n\nWhen I heard it, I knew and agreed that 2019 will be a year to remember.\n\nAfter that, Joyce Meyer quoted Psalm 37 – Fret not yourself because of evildoers; be not envious of wrongdoers! FRET is the word the Lord had written to me in the clouds on 1 April 2013 and His message to me was Psalm 37 and that I had to quit the fretting and make room for faith.\n\nIn the evening I had just switched on the radio and did not hear whose insert was playing. The man said: “You will come out victorious. It won’t be easy, but God will carry you through.”\n\n23 December 2018 – Cover the earth with Your Glory, make a new sound, Siener van Rensburg\n\nDuring my Stradivarius testimony about Africa (2014), God told me that Africa will make a noise in this world, that will never be duplicated again. Also, see my personal Stradivarius testimony of 2012.\n\nI believe this will happen in 2019 and in confirmation of this, several persons made prophecies regarding a new sound in South Africa and Africa. As well as songs, that I have not heard in years, being played over the radio.\n\nOne of the songs were Cover The Earth by Lakewood Live\n\nhttps://www.galileeministry.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Lakewood-Church-Cover-The-Earth-Edited.mp3\n\nThe words are as follows:\n\nLet me be an instrument\n\nTo exalt and to extend\n\nJesus’ name globally\n\nAs the waters cover the sea\n\nOpen the heavens O Lord\n\nAnd pour out Your Spirit\n\nCover the earth with Your glory\n\nCover the earth with Your glory\n\nCover the earth with the sound of heaven\n\nCover the earth with Your glory\n\nCover the earth with Your glory\n\nCover the earth with the sound of heaven\n\nCover the earth\n\nLet me speak what You say\n\nLet the sound prepare the way\n\nKingdom come globally\n\nAs the waters cover the sea\n\nOpen the heavens O Lord\n\nPour out Your Spirit\n\nCover the earth with Your glory\n\nCover the earth with Your glory\n\nCover the earth with the sound of heaven\n\nCover the earth with Your glory\n\nCover the earth with Your glory\n\nCover the earth with the sound of heaven\n\nCover the earth\n\nOpen up the heavenlies\n\nLet a new sound be released\n\nAs the waters cover the sea\n\nCover the earth\n\nWhat caught my ear very specifically is “Let a new sound be released.”\n\nAlso, in November 2017 I received a prophecy by Cindy Jacobs. I am not sure what date this prophecy was made on, but it starts out with “I am bringing a new sound …”\n\nHer prophesy also mentions that God is doing a new thing. This has been strongly pressed on my heart by the Lord.\n\nAround the end of 2013, beginning of 2014 I developed a curiosity about Siener van Rensburg. So I searched the internet for information about him and the prophesies he made and came across a file which contains all he said, which his daughter had written down.\n\nMuch of it seemed highly incoherent to me, reading it as plainly as I did.\n\nHowever when I got to a certain statement he made, my spirit jumped up and I thought: hey, he is talking about me!\n\nThe section talks about a woman from the North with blue eyes wearing a garment of which the colour is between blue and white.\n\nImmediately when I read it, I knew he was talking about me. For three reasons: I am in the North, I have blue eyes and my sister had a dream about me wearing a blue blouse. She sent me a message one morning, some years before and told me that she had a dream about me. That I was wearing a blue blouse, but that the blouse was made of blueish stone and that it looked very, very beautiful. Like royalty. Later on, she expanded on the dream – I was curious and asked questions – she told me that the blue stone was not a sapphire, but a pale stone and she sent me a picture. I lost all the chats and pictures when my phone crashed. It was before smartphones and backing up existed. Nonetheless, the stone looked like a Blue Chalcedony, which in appearance is a colour between blue and white.\n\nFor many years, I did not think about Siener van Rensburg until a client mentioned him in August 2018 and since then, I wanted to read more about him. It was not until December this year, that I got around to it.\n\nBefore December, I made some inquiries on a group on FaceBook, but it was only this month, that I read his prophecies again.\n\nWhen I got to the part about the woman with blue eyes, I remembered that I was certain he spoke of me. The date was 15 May, but the year is only noted at the top and I did not pay attention to it years ago when I read it first. Hurriedly I scrolled up to see which year he made this prophecy and was astonished that the year was 1919.\n\n2019 is the year in which God will raise me up for my calling and 2019 is also exactly 100 years after the prophecy by Siener van Rensburg.\n\nMy calling has to do with leadership and what I found even more astonishing was that the month of the prophecy is the month in which the elections would be in 2019: May.\n\nUp until this day, I did not know that the elections will take place in 2019. I Googled it and then realised SA will have an election in 2019. It was about two months later that president Ramaphosa announced the election date of 8 May 2019.\n\nThus this prophecy had a variance of one week short of a hundred years as far as the elections go. For about two months I lay this before the Lord as to whether I should partake in the elections or not.\n\nLooking back, I clearly see the hand of God and His planning in all of this.\n\nMy message to Africa, specifically South Africa, is this: God has a plan. A flawless plan. Just hang in there and see what God will do. Byt net vas!\n\nCindy Jacobs prophesy\n\nBlue Chalcedony\n\nSiener van Rensburg\n\nSiener van Rensburg’s prophesies can be downloaded here: Siener van Rensburg Afrikaans. It is in Afrikaans and only the notes as taken down by his daughter. No commentaries or opinions, just the raw messages.\n\n25 December 2018 – God will make it happen\n\nDoubt has an uncanny way of creeping in more often than not. But God has a constant way of reassuring us of His promises. He is not a man, that He should lie. Also, as impossible as it may seem, nothing is impossible for God. He used simple people to achieve extraordinary actions that went down in the books of history for thousands of years.\n\nMy calling is huge and I found this message to be inspirational. To remind me that God will make it happen, His way. His timing. His agenda.\n\n26 December 2018 – Holding Spaces, Spirit Friends, My 2019 Message\n\nAs I lay in bed this morning, reluctant to get up, I was thinking about my life and not being where I wanted to be. How differently I wanted my life to be. The words ‘holding spaces’ came to mind an I understood it to mean that sometimes we are kept in holding spaces where we receive training and are equipped for the time that we have to move forward. A time of preparation.\n\nLater that morning on Radio Pulpit, Sipho Kaleni and Ayanda Nenemba were speaking of exactly the same and also using the words ‘holding spaces’.\n\nThe Word for Today is about Spirit Friends and how the indwelling Holy Spirit resonates within us when we connect to fellow Spirit-filled Christians. It is important for us to fellowship together for upliftment, encouragement and bonding in Christ.\n\nEvery year I send out a New Year’s message of what God lays on my heart for the coming year. I browsed through my pictures and came across a photo I took of a light bulb. Immediately the Holy Spirit said: light, the message for 2019 must be about being light in the dark world. To shine like never before. I started the message about a week before the 26th, but because I was unclear about how to word the message, I rather drafted it on Word instead of constantly having to redo changes in PhotoShop.\n\nFaithfull as He is, He confirmed several times in the days that followed, that His instruction to us for 2019, is to shine.\n\nI started my 2019 well before the 26th, but because making changes all the time in PhotoShop was a pain, I decided to type it in Word first and then complete it in Photoshop.\n\n28 December 2018 – Listen and be willing to take advice\n\nWhen a person is spiritually blunt, it is easy to not hear the warning cries by the Holy Spirit either directly or via another form of communication such as the Bible, a friend, a sermon or whatever media or forms of communication.\n\nThe same happened during the time of Noah and it is happening still. People are not listening and not taking heed.\n\n29, 30, 31 December 2018 – Lead me to the Rock that is higher than I\n\nA few times in a row, the words: “Lead me to the Rock that is higher than I” came up. First, in Janine van Niekerk’s program, a song sung by Janine Naidoo and then later on Angela Reed’s program a male singer sang a song with the same words.\n\nIn the early morning hours of the 31st, another song with the same words were playing: “on the Rock that is higher than I”. Also “I will sing of Your love for me”.\n\nI have an idea of what is lying ahead. Most Christians do and the Lord has been making it so abundantly clear that we will have to lean on and trust in Him like never before. To seek Him first and foremost. I also believe that a change for the better is coming. Africa’s time has come.\n\n30 December 2018 – 2019: Comfort, comfort My people, says your God\n\nWhen It’s Time was announced for 22 Aril 2017, the Lord gave me a message for the nation. Though I was not sure whether the message was applicable for that day and if so, how I would convey it, but I typed it up and kept it.\n\nThe message is based on Isaiah 40:1-5, but it was directed to Africa:\n\nComfort, comfort my people, says your God.\n\nSpeak tenderly to Africa, and cry to her that her warfare is ended, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she has received from the LORD’s hand double for all her sins.\n\nA voice cries: “In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.\n\nEvery valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill be made low; the uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain.\n\nAnd the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together, for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.”\n\nOn 30 December 2018 I was listening to Radio Pulpit and Elza Meyer was giving her prophetic word for 2019. It is in Afrikaans. She started by quoting Isaiah 40 and said that she ads the cities of South Africa.\n\nShe further quoted verse 9, Get you up to a high mountain, O Zion, herald of good news; lift up your voice with strength, O Jerusalem, herald of good news; lift it up, fear not; say to the cities of Judah, “Behold your God!”\n\nBehold, the Lord GOD comes with might, and His arm rules for Him; behold, His reward is with Him, and His recompense before Him.\n\nHe will tend His flock like a shepherd; He will gather the lambs in His arms; He will carry them in His bosom, and gently lead those that are with young.\n\nShe experiences that a huge shift will take place in South Africa and she also referred to the first It’s Time prayer movement of 22 April 2017 in Bloemfontein, as well as the meeting in Cape Town and the shifts that took place after these prayer days. Also the Tswane/Pretoria meeting.\n\nShe also mentioned how there will be radical shifts within the government in 2019 with major changes. There will be difficult times, but the economy will recover. The children of God must stand upright more than ever now.\n\nhttps://www.galileeministry.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Elza-Meyer-AUD-20190409-WA0009.mp3\n\n31 December 2018 – Time to clean house\n\nA very fitting message by The Word for Today for the last day of the year.\n\nIt speaks of the importance of being cleansed by God daily, not just weekly or annually.\n\n31 December 2018 – Arise and shine!\n\nAs mentioned earlier, God’s message for 2019 is for Christians to shine.\n\nThis was confirmed a few times on the 31st.\n\nOn Radio Pulpit, Ayanda Nenemba quoted Isaiah 60:1 Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the LORD has risen upon you.\n\nAn hour later in an interview with Mamela Khotso Mokhalema, he said: “Arise and shine” and he quoted Jeremiah 29:13 – “You will seek me and find me. When you seek me with all your heart,”\n\nSomewhat later a song was playing with the words: “Time to arise”."
