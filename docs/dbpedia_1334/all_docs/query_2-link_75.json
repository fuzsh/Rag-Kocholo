        "text": "Introduction:\n\nDead man’s shoes written by David Evans; David was born and raised in South Africa, but after 5 years in prison for anti-apartheid activities, he moved from his hometown.\n\nThe story is about recently widow Anne Bezuidenhout. Her husband of many years Piet Bezuidenhout had broken his neck at the Pampoenfontein gymkhana and was now dead. Anne was pleasant-faced with wide green eyes and had a flickering, charming and tantalizing smile. Most important, Anne was rich. She had ten thousand morgen fully paid for, fruitful lands and all the right equipment.

All of the suitors had to try on the pair of brown shoes, and the one who could fill them out would get Anne and all of her wealth. After none of the 7 suitors fitted the shoes, Sam is asked to try, and he slides into them, as if they were his own.

Therefore the suitors were quite shocked. Sam was just a Negro and not a good match for a woman like Anne. A few days later the teacher visited his shoemaker Josiah Meintjies to get a pair of boots repaired and he then shared the “Cinderella” story. “Bad it might have been, but it was no miracle that those shoes fitted, because I made them for Sam Pitso. I made them in return for six pairs, which had belonged to the late Mr. Bezuidenheit and were to narrow for Sam”.\n\nThey had all been duped, but by who? One must take for granted that Anne has had a hand in. She had of course been able to recognize her deceased husband’s shoes and must have known that the muddy brown pair did not ever belong to"
