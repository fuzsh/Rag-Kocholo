        "text": "GROWTH MINDSET\n\nA few years ago, I decided to live a minimalist lifestyle and travel the world – quite literally the best thing I have ever done. Since giving up everything I own, except for my laptop and what I could fit into a 10 pound backpack, I have experienced lifestyles around the world and have learned to live for the things that matter the most.\n\nWant to know more about me? See my FAQ\n\nEXTROVERT\n\nAs a natural born extrovert with a goal of pushing myself beyond my comfort zone, I have met a lot of unique and interesting people during my travels. These individuals have opened my mind to new ideas and provided me with many life lessons through their personal adventures and stories.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHY\n\nI fell in love with photography at a young age. The ability to capture human senses, anchored to moments of life, in a single image still fascinates me today. Focused on seeing the world for what it is, I use photography to capture everyday life experiences around the world – Instagram\n\nPASSION\n\nTo me, design is more than just a job. It’s something I truly enjoy and love sharing with others. From mentoring students, to training designers on the use of prototyping tools, and creating UX process templates to help a corporate UX department run more efficiently, I aim to make a true difference and help the community grow.\n\nMOTIVATION\n\nMotivation fuels my work and my desire to impact the world. I have been passionate about software technology and product design since owning my first computer at eleven years old. My love of digital product design has influenced my career and motivates me to continue growing my knowledge and skills."
