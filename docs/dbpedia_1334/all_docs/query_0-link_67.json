        "text": "Due west out of Port Elizabeth for 177 miles to the tiny hamlet of Avontuur, there meanders a 2’-0” gauge railway that for more than 80 years served the deciduous-fruit growing region known as the Langkloof. Although the “kloof” part of its name – meaning “cleft” or “ravine” – implies that it is narrow, it is in fact a broad, well-watered valley, quite rugged in parts, between tall mountain ranges. Until the completion of the metalled R62 in the mid-1960s the ‘Kloof was Arcadian in its isolation, only accessible by railway or corrugated dirt roads developed from crude wagon tracks that had served the region since the 18th century. The arrival of the railway – albeit a narrow-gauge one – in 1906 was of huge benefit to farmers who hitherto had battled to get their produce to market by ox wagon. Much closer to Port Elizabeth there was also an important branch that tapped the fertile vegetable lands and citrus groves of the Gamtoos valley. In wild, largely unspoilt country to the east of this river are extensive deposits of a pure form of limestone, ideal for cement making. During the 1920s a quarry with its own link to the SAR was established at Patensie by the Eastern Province Cement Company (EPCC – a subsidiary of Pretoria Portland Cement). At Chelsea siding, 14 miles from PE, a 12-mile private line connected the EPCC factory at New Brighton. Although the limestone quarry was later moved closer to Loerie its product became the base traffic of the narrow gauge and remained so for more than 70 years.\n\nBy the 1920s the Avontuur line had become one of the busiest narrow-gauge systems – described in detail in Sydney Moir’s seminal “Twenty-four Inches Apart”, published by the Oakwood Press in 1963. Rather than going over ground already well ploughed by Moir (he died some 20 years ago), the next five chapters of SoAR will mostly deal with the turbulent subsequent years. We hope that much of this material will be made available in a proposed new book by David Payling.\n\nPost WWII the South African economy experienced 40 years of almost continuous growth, sweeping the SAR along with it. The Langkloof railway was affected slowly at first but by the early 1960s traffic had increased enough to warrant substantial investment in its infrastructure, rolling stock and locomotives. After SAR became South African Transport Services (SATS) in 1981 expenditure on its narrow-gauge lines continued unabated at first, but came to an abrupt end in 1985 – we shall see why in a moment.\n\nWhen this somewhat naïve, newly appointed Regional Engineer took up his post in PE in 1981, the narrow-gauge relaying and strengthening programme (a prerequisite for running diesels into Avontuur) was a predominant topic at our weekly meetings with the Regional Manager1. This was ten years after SAR’s run-down of steam traction had been set in motion, so all the Locomotive Superintendent wanted to know was when he would be able to dispense with steam west of Assegaaibos. In this he was eagerly supported by the Superintendent Operating (who actively hated steam) and the Regional Manager himself who had no emotional attachment to the machines that had faithfully served the Langkloof for 80 years - however hard I tried to convince them that exhaust-steam and coal smoke were what gave Langkloof apples their much sought-after flavour.\n\nJust in time for the new fruit season, in February 1984 a process that had begun 15 years earlier was finished – 177 miles of 60lb rails had been laid right into Avontuur. For the first time, packed fruit could run behind diesels all the way from the Kloof to the cooling sheds in PE Harbour. There were no hiccups, except that there weren’t enough diesels to handle the peak traffic, so after a break of ten years (but only for a few weeks) pairs of NG15s helped haul in block-loaded crops from Assegaaibos – a job they had done with distinction until they were bumped aside by the class 91s. However, the track-relaying programme was not the only project completed in that month. At Twee Riviere, Misgund and Avontuur new fruit shelters, paved areas for fork-lift trucks and offices for the Deciduous Fruit Board (DFB) were handed over to the Commercial Division and the last of 220 new insulated OZ fruit wagons were delivered to the Operating Department.\n\nThe 1984 season was spectacularly successful. Never had the traffic been cleared so efficiently – and this with an all-time record 58,000 tons of export fruit in three months. Cape Midland railwaymen from all departments were naturally proud of this achievement – even more so on 11th of May when a letter of congratulation arrived from prominent Misgund farmer, Mr M Kritzinger on behalf of the Langkloof producers, thanking the Regional Manager for the completely hassle-free clearance of the 1984 crop and looking forward to a similar joint operation in 1985. I quote from this letter (translated): “We as the producers cannot let this opportunity pass to thank you for the truly outstanding service which we received from SATS during the past season. The harvest eventually turned out to be much bigger than originally anticipated but we never experienced any difficulties in getting the export tonnages away smoothly. We thank you [again].”\n\nBut unbeknown to all on the region (it is fair to include the Regional Manager himself, unless he was a good actor) storm clouds were gathering. At the weekly meeting in September 1984 a letter from Assistant General Manager (AGM) (Commercial), Dr G J S Coetzee, informed us that the 1985 crop was to be handled by SATS’s in-house Road Motor Transport (RMT) division. Additional lorries and trailers would be sent to cope with the surge in tonnage. I was present at that meeting and can remember as if it were yesterday the gasps of disbelief and dismay around the long table.\n\nWe knew instantly that this decision would have disastrous consequences – and so it proved. Pandora's box had been opened.\n\nThe stage for the tragedy – that is not too strong a word – had been set several years previously with the passing of the Road Transportation Act, Act 14 of 1977 (mentioned in SoAR chapter 1 part 5). The curious thing is that railwaymen (including this writer) didn’t realise its implications at the time – in effect this landmark Bill removed the protection from road hauliers which SAR had enjoyed since the Motor Carrier Act of 1931. Among several harmless provisions of the new Bill, the killer was a sneaky clause that allowed private carriers to haul goods permit-free within a radius of 80km from their headquarters. Soon, trucking garages were set up at 160km intervals between Durban and Johannesburg, and similar depots began to spread out along other main and branch lines. Nor did the narrow gauges escape. Without us realising it, Act 14 had rendered almost every private siding, most of the branch lines and even main lines vulnerable to competition from subsidised private road hauliers, so that by the 1990s the railway map of South Africa was being altered forever. In the nature of government-run bureaucracies it took years for the bad news to sink in. While the number of SATS employees nationwide continued to increase from c 260 000 in 1977 to an all-time high of 278 000 in 1983, investment in the railways continued on a massive scale. To illustrate this point a table of Capital and Betterment expenditure (adjusted for inflation) on the Port Elizabeth narrow gauge is reproduced below. Many new B-bogies and OZ wagons ordered during 1982/3 and delivered in 1984/85 scarcely turned a wheel in revenue service. Having stood idle for several years while most of their phosphor-bronze and whitemetal bearings were stolen, they were eventually scrapped where they stood.\n\nIn the latter half of 1984 Head Office woke up. With the compliance of the Minister of Transport Hendrik Schoeman (who owned a fleet of trucks already benefiting from Act 14), someone in Johannesburg decided that branch lines in general and the narrow gauges in particular were to be phased out as quickly as possible – with cynical disregard for the consequences. Expressed in today’s money, in two decades since the mid-sixties R1,3 billion had been spent on the Port Elizabeth narrow gauge – more than half on new rolling stock and track that would hardly begin to generate a return. In euros at least it sounds less at Є110,000,000, or in sterling even less: £94,000,000 – barely enough for half a mile of HS2! But in South Africa this was BIG money – given the casualness of the decision to close it could have been put to much better use elsewhere.\n\nConsidering that the Langkloof railway was handling the traffic to the obvious satisfaction of its customers and a huge capital works plan had almost been completed, there seemed to be no logical reason for closure. The announcement was greeted with indignation by local railwaymen, who demanded en masse (via the unions) that the decision be reversed. But the Regional Manager was a fatalist who was reluctant to stand up to head office in spite of overwhelming evidence that this was what neither the customers nor railwaymen wanted – his favoured expression when referring to the narrow gauge became “die koeël is deur die kerk ” (the die is cast).\n\nAt this stage there was no real threat from private road hauliers (no doubt they were sniffing around) but as it turned out there was a convenient reason for head office to abandon rail. The underground cooling sheds in Port Elizabeth harbour were old and expensive to maintain (the first was built in 1934, the second in 1954) and needed to be rebuilt or replaced. Dr Coetzee (Dr Faustus would have been more appropriate) decided to impose a R2/ton surcharge to recover the cost – here it should be mentioned that only a few years earlier, in SAR days, upgrading or replacing the precooling sheds would have been proposed by head office without much ado and funds rubber-stamped by Parliament with hardly a query. But the government had got itself embroiled in the border wars with Angola and Mocambique which sucked up money that ought never to have been wasted on such disastrous escapades so there was much less available for the railways.\n\nNaturally the DFB objected to the surcharge and so the idea of encouraging farmers to erect their own cooling sheds on their farms was born. This suited SATS management who, without consultation with the Regional office or its customers, had unilaterally submitted to the Minister of Transport a proposal that the narrow-gauge lines be closed. Their recommendation, based upon a dissertation by Dr Coetzee2, made no mention of the new insulated wagons – a further excuse being that reefer lorries provided by SATS could preserve what was known as the “cold chain” but the slow narrow-gauge trains could not (In 1993 this proved to be a fallacy after tests by Alfred County Railway).\n\nThe main reason for the DFB’s acceptance of the switch to road immediately after completion of the Capital and Betterment programme was this surcharge imposed by Head Office, again without consultation either with the regional office or the customers. In a letter to Dr Coetzee in September, 1984 the DFB emphasised that they were more concerned about the tariff than the mode of transport, but Coetzee obdurately refused to budge so they were forced to accept the road-haulage proposal.\n\nIn November 1984 the Regional Manager, in a letter to Head Office, set out the Region’s objections to the proposal. In referring to the fact that the AGM (Commercial) had encouraged the DFB to use road transport because “the narrow gauge was being worked uneconomically”, the letter provided figures which showed that operating costs were being covered, it was only when Head Office charges and capital redemption were included that the bottom line turned red. It pointed out that if the plan to close the narrow gauge were executed these costs would simply be transferred to the remaining open lines, thus setting off a domino effect.\n\nThere was no response to this letter and it soon became clear that removal of the fruit traffic was only the first step. Dr Coetzee was aware that in order to close the narrow gauge he needed the co-operation of Pretoria Portland Cement (PPC), the owners of EPCC. Within days of his tactical success with the DFB he approached Mr Luyt, CEO of PPC, with the object of persuading the company to transport its 380,000 annual tons of limestone from Loerie to New Brighton with lorries. The GM Commercial was very persuasive – he suggested that a 60% tariff increase would cover what he claimed were SATS’s losses on hauling their product. When this leaked out on the region it was realised that loss of the limestone would be a terminal blow – which of course was the whole idea. This time however the GM Commercial overstepped the mark. He completely underestimated the uproar the proposal created in and around Algoa Bay, not only from railwaymen but from PPC’s subsidiary, EPCC (particularly the latter’s GM, Mr Bezuidenhout, who did not favour road haulage), heads of commerce and industry as well as environmentalists in Port Elizabeth. Thus began a stressful year of sparring between the regional office and a very determined Commercial department in Johannesburg. An account of how the base traffic of the line was saved and the life of the Avontuur line extended for another 20 years will be told in Part 2 of the Port Elizabeth narrow-gauge story.\n\nMeanwhile, local railwaymen were delighted to find that they were not alone in their astonishment that railway managers in head office were promoting road haulage – ostensibly because the line was losing money and the DFB wanted to switch. As word got out, influential municipalities, commercial organizations, customers and the media throughout the catchment of the narrow gauge joined forces to oppose its closure. During the ensuing months meetings were held up and down the Kloof to counter the threat resulting from loss of the fruit traffic. Many cases and strategic plans were submitted to SATS headquarters but all to no avail. The political route was also tried but the pleas of producers fell on stony ground, one suspects mainly due to the road-oriented Minister of Transport.\n\nA year later, on 10 October 1985, matters came to a head when Dr Coetzee addressed business and local authorities in Humansdorp. Faced with unanimous opposition to the proposed closure, this was where the wolf finally shed his sheep’s clothing. After thanking the chairman for his warm welcome Dr Coetzee went on to say he hoped that after his speech he would be just as welcome at future meetings – he must have thought he was dealing with idiots. The speech and his subsequent dismissive responses to numerous objections to the proposed closure were full of factual distortions, doublespeak and misleading “information” that would have done a politician proud.\n\nFortunately, forewarned had been forearmed. The chairman of the meeting, Mr N P R van der Watt turned out to be a champion. He had armed himself with traffic figures discreetly provided by Johan Marais, SATS's Regional Statistician – a worthy stalwart of the cause. Including the rump of the Langkloof traffic – deciduous fruit – the 1984 tonnages made up an impressive 599,700 tons (note that small inbound tonnages are included) and the thrust of his argument was how could the GM (Commercial) justify putting all this business on road?:\n\nLangkloof (mainly fruit): 50,700 tons\n\nAssegaaibos (fruit, wheat and treated timber): 50,000 tons\n\nHumansdorp (mainly grains): 70,000 tons\n\nPatensie branch (citrus, grains, lucerne and vegetables): 45,000 tons\n\nLoerie (almost all limestone): 384,000 tons\n\nMr van der Watt (head of the Kouga Regional Development Board, which included the Langkloof) went on to provide conservative figures based on new agricultural lands coming into cultivation that showed the total nett tonnage available to rail increasing by 13%, or 77,000 tons during the next five years.\n\nIn spite of this, Dr Coetzee stubbornly refused to give an undertaking that the line might have a future after all. It was pointed out to him that customers could not make investment decisions to use rail in the face of such uncertainty but he was unmoved, ducking and diving to avoid direct answers to questions and challenges in the most embarrassing way. I have the full transcript of this meeting and in Part 3 a translation of it will be published which shows that important rail customers posed questions that remained unanswered or were misleadingly answered. From time to time I will refer to this document in future parts of SoAR – beginning with the story of how the limestone, base traffic of the narrow gauge, was almost lost then retained due entirely to the initiative of the Regional Office.\n\nThe reader will notice that many of the illustrations date back to the very early years covered by Sydney Moir.
