        "text": "Meet the Dietitian: Retha Harmse\n\nWe spoke to ADSA Executive Committee member and registered dietitian, Retha Harmse. She has served on the ADSA Executive Committee in the Public Relations portfolio for the last two terms (2019 – 2023). She is a powerhouse and we are glad to have her on the ADSA team!\n\nTell us a bit more of yourself?\n\nThis is quite a tough question as I don’t really have a short answer to this, there are many aspects to me that it is hard to narrow it down to just a sentence or two. But let me try;\n\nIn my personal life, I would say I don’t do anything half – I am properly serious and hardworking when I am in task mode but I also have a very silly sense of humour and can laugh abundantly when I rest (those who watch my Instagram stories would agree). I also really pour my heart in soul into everything I do.\n\nIn terms of my career, I love learning more and improving myself daily – not just for myself but also for my patients and to help the profession grow. I really believe we can change the world!\n\nWhy did you become a Registered Dietitian?\n\nI often tell my patients that I became a dietitian because I love people, I’m passionate about health and I love people. And in short, that is it!\n\nAfter matric, I took a gap year where we did a different course each week and there was a month focused on career guidance. In that month I did shadowing in dietetic lectures, with clinical dietitians and outpatient consultations. And after that there was no turning back.\n\nOnce I started studying and after that started working, I realised that this is definitely exactly where I need to be.\n\nWhat would you have wanted to do if not Dietetics?\n\nI would’ve wanted to study Medicine (but can now truly say that I love being a dietitian).\n\nWhere did you study (degree and/ or postgrad)\n\nI studied BSc Dietetics at the North West University, Potchefstroom campus. Besides getting my qualification and becoming a dietitian, I made some of my fondest memories there and met lifelong friends.\n\nWhere do you work and what does your job entail?\n\nMy private practice is located in Saxonwold, Johannesburg in Oxford Healthcare Centre. I work in a psychiatric day hospital called The Day Clinic and I see the patients for individual as well as group sessions.\n\nWe use the modality of Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) and Intuitive Eating to help our patients improve their relationships with food and their bodies and practice more self-care and acceptance towards themselves.\n\nThis is so rewarding and I absolutely love it\n\nWalk us through a day in your life?\n\nI would arrive at the office, see The Day Clinic group sessions or individual patients and in between a few outpatients. There are also paperwork in between, stuff like patient notes, billing, etc.\n\nI would work on social media content for the practice (recording a video, writing captions, etc), work on developing a course/masterclass (either for dietitians or for the public), plan a corporate offering for a company or engage with the media (television, radio or written media).\n\nEach day is different, but I really love it exactly for that reason.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about the work you do? What are the most satisfying moments?\n\nWhen individuals experience Food Freedom! It is the most rewarding when I see people free from the hold that eating disorders or disordered eating had over them. When food becomes something they can just enjoy and their bodies become an instrument that they can experience life through.\n\nWhat has been your career highlight?\n\nTo be honest, there have been so many highlights (and I think this is just the beginning). But being an ADSA spokesperson and serving on the Executive Committee has definitely been a massive highlight. I experienced so much growth (both personally and professionally) and would urge everyone to get more involved in the ADSA structures.\n\nWhat are the most challenging aspects of your career?\n\nWorking in mental health and eating disorders, it is really hard to sometimes switch off and not take the emotions home with you.\n\nWhat is something that people don’t know about you?\n\nI love music – I play the piano and sing in the church band.\n\nWhat are your favourite foods?\n\nI love most foods, but my best ones are Sushi, Butter Chicken and Asian Cuisine.\n\nWhat are the three things that you think people should stop saying when they meet a dietitian?\n\nThen you probably tell people what to eat and what not to.\n\nCan you give me a meal plan?\n\nThen you shouldn’t look at what I have on my plate now.\n\nPhoto credit: SOIF DE VIVRE IMAGERY\n\nMeet the Dietitian: Estelle Strydom\n\nWe met up with ADSA Executive Committee member and registered dietitian, Estelle Strydom. She serves in the Treasury portfolio and is definitely a force to be reckoned with. Read more to get to know her better!\n\nTell us a bit more of yourself?\n\nI stay in Potchefstroom with my 4 blue-eyed boys: a lovely husband, a darling baby boy and two Ragdoll cats. (Go Google Ragdoll cats and you’ll see why these cats are famous for their beauty and friendly personalities.) I work at the North-West University and am also the treasurer of the ADSA Executive Committee.\n\nWhy did you become a Registered Dietitian?\n\nI’ve always been really interested in how the body works and I wanted to do something that can help others to become their healthiest selves. And food is life.\n\nWhat would you have wanted to do if not Dietetics?\n\nPharmacy.\n\nWhere did you study (degree and/ or postgrad)\n\nI did my undergrad at Stellenbosch University and an MSc at the NWU. I’m also currently busy with my PhD at the NWU.\n\nWhere do you work and what does your job entail?\n\nI’m the Manager of the ImpENSA Training Programme (Improving Early Nutrition and Health in South Africa) at the NWU. ImpENSA is a training programme for health care professionals to improve their knowledge and skills to better support women and children during the first 1000 days of life.\n\nWalk us through a day in your life?\n\nIt differs every day :).\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about the work you do? What are the most satisfying moments?\n\nI am really proud of the online module I co-created for the ImpENSA Training Programme. I learned many things about learning design (the way in which content is conveyed to the learner, like quizzes, case studies, interactive media elements, etc.). Being closely involved in the development of different media elements such as interactive graphs, and the filming of videos was also really exciting. As the ImpENSA project is an international collaboration I also had the opportunity to travel to new places and meet colleagues from around the world.\n\nWhat has been your career highlight?\n\nWatch this space 😉\n\nWhat are the most challenging aspects of your career?\n\nI struggle to say no and often have too many things on my plate.\n\nWhat is something that people don’t know about you?\n\nI am also a Yoga teacher.\n\nWhat are your favourite foods?\n\nPizza and chocolate.\n\nWhat are the three things that you think people should stop saying when they meet a dietitian?\n\nPlease don’t look at my plate.\n\nOh, you must speak to my husband/kids and tell them to eat healthier.\n\nMy friend is using these pills that made her lose so much weight and it also increases your hair growth, makes your skin smooth and can cure cancer.\n\nPeanut Butter Spice Granola\n\nRecipe by registered dietitian, Rhodene Leydekkers\n\nAmount of servings: 8 Servings\n\nPreparation time: 10 Minutes\n\nCooking time: 45 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 55 Minutes\n\nIngredients:\n\n2 Cups rolled oats\n\n1/3 Cup no-added sugar Peanutbuter\n\n100 g Pitted Dates\n\n1 Medium Apple\n\n100 ml Boiled water\n\n1 Teaspoon Vanilla\n\n1 Teaspoon Cinnamon\n\n1 Teaspoon Turmeric\n\nPinch of Salt\n\nMethod:\n\nPre-heat the oven to 180 C.\n\nAdd the peanut butter, dates, apple, boiled water and vanilla to a blender and blend until smooth.\n\nMix the rolled oats, cinnamon, turmeric, and salt in a separate bowl.\n\nAdd the peanut butter mixture to the oat until well combined.\n\nSpread out the mixture on a greased baking tray, and bake for 45 – 50 minutes until light brown and crispy.\n\nLet it cool down and store it in an airtight container.\n\nAdditional Advice: This recipe can be enjoyed in different ways! For delicious Granola bars, press the mixture into an oven-proof dish and bake for 45 – 50 minutes. Cut into bars and let it cool off. Enjoy it as a snack or a breakfast on the go!\n\nTop tip: Enjoy this tasty granola with some yoghurt to increase the protein content of the meal, as well as a portion of fruit to up the fibre.\n\nNutritional information per 78 g serving:\n\nEnergy: 843 kJ\n\nProtein: 4.6 g\n\nCarbohydrates: 26 g\n\nOf which total sugar: 11.2 g\n\nTotal fat: 7.9 g\n\nOf which saturated fat: 1.6 g\n\nDietary fibre: 3.4 g\n\nSodium: 41 mg\n\nBlack Forest Smoothie Bowl\n\nRecipe by registered dietitian, Lila Bruk.\n\nIngredients:\n\n100g frozen cherries*\n\n1 tblsp chia seeds\n\n80ml almond milk\n\n70g cooked, cooled oats (20g raw)\n\n1 tbsp smooth fat-free cottage cheese\n\n1 tsp cocoa\n\n1 tsp raw honey\n\nHandful of ice\n\nIf frozen cherries are not available, use any frozen berry (e.g. blueberries) as an alternative.\n\nMethod:\n\nBlend, top with sliced cherries and enjoy!\n\n• Why we love it: Smoothies are very popular, but very often drinking your breakfast does not feel as satisfying as eating your breakfast. Smoothie bowls are the perfect solution, because they require you to use a spoon, which instantly makes the smoothie bowl feel like more of a meal (and thus more satisfying) than a regular liquid breakfast smoothie.\n\n• Dietitians say:\n\n– Cherries are amazing little powerhouses packed with the antioxidants anthocyanins, which assist with reducing inflammation and reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke. Combine them here with phytonutrient-rich cocoa for the ultimate combo!\n\n– In addition, this delicious breakfast is rich in fibre and protein, so should keep your blood glucose levels stable until your next meal or snack.\n\n• Top tips:\n\n– The cherries can easily be replaced with blueberries depending on seasonal availability.\n\n– You can add more cocoa if you want it to be extra chocolate-y, but it will make it less sweet.\n\n– You may need to add more milk if the mixture is too thick\n\n– You can use raw oats if you prefer, but cooked oats provide a better, creamier texture\n\nNutritional information per bowl:\n\nKilojoules 1055kJ\n\nTotal fat 6.6g\n\nSaturated fat 0.7g\n\nTrans fat 0g\n\nPolyunsaturated fat 4g\n\nMonounsaturated fat 1.5g\n\nTotal Carbohydrates 41.6g\n\nDietary fibre 9.5g\n\nAdded Sugar 0g\n\nProtein 8.4g\n\nMoroccan Spiced Lentil Salad with Dried apricots and Almond flakes\n\nRecipe by registered dietitian, Emmie Bester\n\nPrep: 15 Minutes\n\nServing: 1 Person\n\nIngredients:\n\n20g Salad Leaves\n\n80g Canned Lentil rinsed\n\n½ Red Onion chopped roughly\n\n20g Dried Apricots chopped roughly\n\n1 Celery Stick chopped\n\n5g Almond Flakes\n\n5g Herb Mix (coriander/flatleaf parsley/mint) chopped\n\n10ml Orange zest and juice\n\n1 Fresh Chilli (optional to taste)\n\nMoroccan Dressing:\n\n5ml Honey\n\n5ml Olive Oil\n\n10ml Red Wine Vinegar\n\n1 Garlic Clove finely minced – use a garlic press (optional to taste)\n\n2g Cumin\n\n2g Cinnamon\n\nPinch Ground Cloves\n\nPinch Salt and Pepper (to taste)\n\nPreparations:\n\nRinse the green leaves.\n\nDrain and rinse the lentils.\n\nPeel and chop the onion (If sensitive to onions chop and place in a bowl of cold, salted water).\n\nChop the apricots.\n\nChop the celery.\n\nRinse the fresh herbs and chop roughly.\n\nZest and juice the orange leaving some segments for garnish.\n\nDeseed and finely chop chilli (to taste).\n\nStep 1 Place the green leaves in a large bowl topped with lentils, drained onions, apricots, celery, almonds, herbs and orange zest.

Read on to get to know her better!\n\nTell us a bit more of yourself?\n\nI was born, raised and went school and university (North West University – NWU) in Potchefstroom. Having a father as a lecturer at the university and a mother as a school teacher, I know very early in my life that would like to be ‘some form of teacher’, later it became clear to me that I would like to work with students at a university. I am therefore very fortunate to have been involved in academics as a registered dietitian in the training of dietetic students for the last 25 years, at first at SMU (Pretoria) and the last 10 years at NWU (Potchefstroom).\n\nWhy did you become a Registered Dietitian?\n\nAs a student, I first enrolled for Home Economics (now known as Consumer Sciences). I did ballet and modern dance for many years and continued with it into my student years. This created a natural interest in general health and fitness and triggered as much bigger passion for evidence-based nutrition, leading to me changing my studies to Dietetics already early in my 1st years at the university. With more studies, I learnt that general health & fitness and weight management are only very small components of the scope of dietetic practice. Since I also seriously considered studying medicine at a point in time, medical nutrition therapy and the difference we a registered dietitians can make in the life of patients and clients, made a big impact on me.\n\nWhat would you have wanted to do if not Dietetics?\n\nBecoming a medical doctor or an accountant.\n\nWhere did you study (degree and/ or postgraduate)?\n\nBSc Dietetics (1992) and BSc Honours (Dietetics) (1993) degrees – North West University (NWU), Potchefstroom Campus\n\nPost-graduate Diploma in Hospital Dietetics (1995) – at University of Pretoria (UP)\n\nMSc (Dietetics) degree (2014) – NWU (Potchefstroom Campus)\n\nWhere do you work and what does your job entail?\n\nFrom 2010, I have been working at the NWU, Potchefstroom in the Dietetics department, mainly as a lecturer & the internship coordinator of the 4th year Dietetics students, travelling to students at training facilities, evaluating and supporting them and ensuring quality control of the internship training.\n\nWalk us through a day in your life?\n\nNot one day is the same, depending on where I need to do visits to and evaluate my students in the internship – hospitals, various community settings or foodservice units. A day when visits are not required will be typically spent at the office, managing admin and other academic duties.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about the work you do? What are the most satisfying moments?\n\nWorking with my students and encouraging them to do their best and becoming the best young dietitian they can be. Nothing is more satisfying when students improve on their performance with hard work and dedication, and receiving positive reports from training personnel.\n\nWhat has been your career highlight?\n\nEvery year bring highlights, especially when the 4th year Dietetic students graduate\n\nObtaining my MSc in Dietetics and publishing my 1st article\n\nServing my profession by serving on ADSA branch committees (NW and Pretoria) in several portfolios and also several terms as chairlady\n\nServing my profession by serving on the ADSA executive committee (terms 2009 – 2011 and 2011 – 2013 in the membership portfolio and also, the current term 2021 – 2023 in the CPD portfolio)\n\nWhat are the most challenging aspects of your career?\n\nAct as a go-between my students and dietetic internship training personnel, always having to have an open ear, mind and heart for both parties, not judging either side too quickly and facilitating good communication between the parties involved to ensure quality training of the students. And also, not getting angry too quickly about incompetent individuals in my profession.\n\nWhat is something that people don’t know about you?\n\nI am a dancer in my heart, doing ballet for most of my young life as a child, young girl and student. I love music and also want to dance when I hear good music.\n\nWhat are your favourite foods?\n\nSalads, eggs, pasta, pizza and seafood dishes\n\nWhat are the three things that you think people should stop saying when they meet a dietitian?\n\n“Hey, maybe you should work out a diet for me, then I will lose weight!”\n\n“I should actually not eat this in front of you”\n\n“Have you heard about this …….. (newest fad) diet? It really works!!”\n\nMeet the Dietitian: Alta Kloppers\n\nYou might have heard the name Alta Kloppers. She serves on the ADSA Executive Committee from 2019 – 2023 in the Private Practicing Dietitian portfolio. Do yourself a favour and get to know them better!\n\nTell us a bit more of yourself?\n\nI was born more than a half century ago at one of the hospitals where I currently run a practice, at that time known as the Glynnwood Nursing Home in Benoni. I was also schooled and lived on the East Rand all my life. I obtained a B Dietetics degree as well as Post Graduate Diploma in Hospital Dietetics from the University of Pretoria and recently completed a M Sc Dietetics degree from the University of the Free State. I have been a PPD for 27year.\n\nIn December, I will be married for 33 years. We have a beautiful 23year old son that makes us very proud.\n\nWhy did you become a Registered Dietitian?\n\nI wanted to become a pharmacist all my life. When I was not accepted to study pharmacology, (those years there were no 2nd and 3rd choices) – I paged through possible courses and noted that a certain course included pharmacology as subject in the third year. I paged back and saw that it was the B Dietetics course and immediately decided that this is what I want to do.\n\nWhat would you have wanted to do if not Dietetics?\n\n30 years ago, a pharmacist, now… I can’t imagine being anything other than a dietitian.\n\nWhere did you study (degree and/ or postgrad)\n\nUP\n\nWhere do you work and what does your job entail?\n\nMy practice is based in Alberton and Benoni. My personal special interest is critical care, food allergies as well renal. I work with a team of passionate dietitians. Besides consulting my own patients, I love mentoring and teaching the younger dietitians in my practice. I also enjoy running my own business and the challenges that it entails.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about the work you do? What are the most satisfying moments?\n\nI love teaching. I enjoy most to be able to “connect” with a patient during a session and observing the “aha moments” in their eyes, regardless, if it is explaining to a weak ICU patient why they need additional supplementation or an insulin resistant patient grasping that they actually do need carbohydrates. I also love it when young dietitians show a true passion for the profession and being able to mentor them to the best of my ability.\n\nWhat has been your career highlight?\n\nI know it sounds boring but obtaining my Masters.\n\nWhat are the most challenging aspects of your career?\n\nRunning my practice like a business.\n\nWhat is something that people don’t know about you?\n\nI am determined to learn how to ride a horse at my mature age. I can’t ride a horse but I am determined to learn how to do it and do it well when I can make the time to do so!\n\nWhat are your favourite foods?\n\n“Skaaptjoppie met n stukkie vet aan”\n\nWhat are the three things that you think people should stop saying when they meet a dietitian?\n\nStart telling me what they eat\n\nTelling me they “don’t do carbs” without even knowing what carbohydrates are\n\nChanging “people” to “nursing staff” – what is for lunch today?\n\nMeet the Dietitian: Cindy Chin\n\nGet to know Cindy Chin, who serves on the ADSA Executive Committee 2021 – 2023 in the Communications portfolio (and she is the Woolworths dietitian)!\n\nTell us a bit more of yourself?\n\nI live in Cape Town, I have two beautiful daughters (almost both teens) and an amazing husband. I enjoy experimenting in the kitchen with new recipes and ingredients, and gardening when I have the time!\n\nWhy did you become a Registered Dietitian?\n\nI’m passionate about helping people to improve their diet and lifestyle.\n\nI love the science of nutrition and the psychology of eating.\n\nI love food (most types).\n\nWhat would you have wanted to do if not Dietetics?\n\nAccounting, but I can’t imagine myself doing that today!\n\nWhere did you study (degree and/ or postgrad)\n\nWits (BSc undergrad), UCT (BSc Hons Nutr & Diet), Stellenbosch (MSc Ther Nutr) (almost finished!)\n\nWhere do you work and what does your job entail?\n\nWoolworths Foods. As the Nutrition manager, my role is to inform, direct and enable the delivery of the nutrition strategy across the foods business, through science-based nutritional expertise, strategic partnerships and thought leadership.\n\nWalk us through a day in your life?\n\nNo day is the same but it usually entails a mixture of responding to emails and attending virtual meetings that are comprised of giving guidance to product teams, providing strategic input into various initiatives, presenting nutrition insights and training, signing off marketing comms, writing/reviewing nutritional guidelines, scanning research and attending webinars to stay up-skilled.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about the work you do? What are the most satisfying moments?\n\nMaking a difference to the nutritional quality of the foods people purchase, challenging better product development, the privilege of setting and driving nutritional standards for a major food retailer\n\nWhat has been your career highlight?\n\nI would have to say that travelling internationally with colleagues has probably been a career highlight. Experiencing good food with foodie fanatics is highly recommended!\n\nWhat are the most challenging aspects of your career?\n\nInfluencing and negotiating in a commercial environment; translating complex scientific information into a retail-specific context; dispelling pseudoscience\n\nWhat is something that people don’t know about you?\n\nI like imagining a futuristic world so enjoy science fiction/fantasy books and movies like Lord of the Rings, Marvel, and reading the classics like Charles Dickens and Jane Austen.\n\nWhat are your favourite foods?\n\nI love almost all types of foods, but Cantonese cuisine is my favourite.\n\nWhat are the three things that you think people should stop saying when they meet a dietitian?\n\nIs this healthy? (points at their plate of food)\n\nWhat do you think about *insert latest fad diet name*?\n\nI hope the dietitian approves.\n\nMeet the Dietitian: Fatima Hoosen\n\nWe had a chat with Fatima Hoosen, who serves on the ADSA Executive Committee 2021 – 2023 in the Ad Hoc portfolio. Read on to get to know her better!\n\nTell us a bit more of yourself?\n\nMy name is Fatima Hoosen, I am from Cape Town, married and a mom of 4 with ages ranging from 16 to 4 years old.\n\nWhy did you become a Registered Dietitian?\n\nI met a dietitian when I was about 16 years old. She told me about dietetics and I was immediately interested in the career. I then researched the profession and where to study the course. My dad was not keen on this course and encouraged me to study something else – I did one year of BSc (general) and then secretly applied for the course for the following year…and the rest is history!\n\nWhat would you have wanted to do if not Dietetics?\n\nI think teaching may have appealed to me – I enjoy working with young people.\n\nWhere did you study (degree and/ or postgrad)\n\nI did my undergrad at the University of the Western Cape, my masters at Stellenbosch University and currently completing my PhD at the University of Cape Town.\n\nWhere do you work and what does your job entail?\n\nAt present I am a full-time PhD candidate, however I was clinical educator at UCT prior to this.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about the work you do? What are the most satisfying moments?\n\nI enjoy working with people and being of assistance. When working with patients it is very satisfying when the desired outcomes for the patient are achieved. When I am working with students – it is extremely satisfying to see them grow and develop into qualified dietitians and later into leaders in the field.\n\nWhat has been your career highlight?\n\nWorking in the UK has always been special to me. I initially worked as a clinical dietitian but when I went abroad for the second time I worked as a community dietitian working in various multidisciplinary teams. Another highlight was when I was awarded an internship at the South African Medical Research Council to focus on my PhD.\n\nWhat are the most challenging aspects of your career?\n\nMy PhD is focused on behaviour change and I think understanding human behaviour and successfully implementing behaviour change can be extremely challenging for any dietitian.

We thought it well to meet up with her and get to know her a bit better.\n\nTell us a bit more of yourself?\n\nI’m 39 years old, wife to my high school sweetheart, Prean and mum to 2 amazing kids (Kiara and Kaelen). We have a dog, and 2 chickens J I love spending time with my family and am passionate about Indian classical dance and music. I enjoy doing social work that involves children. I love birthdays as I feel it a great opportunity to celebrate a person’s uniqueness and contribution to this world!\n\nWhy did you become a Registered Dietitian?\n\nIn high school, I had to do a research project and chose to do the impact of the Indian diet on blood glucose control in diabetics compared to the impact of Western diet on blood glucose control in support of my mum who was diabetic for 15 odd years at that time. It was then that I met dietitians (Phumelele Mthembu and Chantell Witten) for the first time, and they inspired me to do dietetics.\n\nWhat would you have wanted to do if not Dietetics?\n\nMedical Doctor\n\nWhere did you study (degree and/ or postgrad)\n\nProudly UKZN (Undergrad and Masters)\n\nWhere do you work and what does your job entail?\n\nKZN Department of Health – Assistant Director Nutrition at the Provincial Office\n\nWe provide technical support to other government departments, districts in KZN, and health facilities. We develop guidelines and policies that support the implementation of the Integrated Nutrition Programme.\n\nWalk us through a day in your life?\n\nIt really does vary and could start at 5am (when travelling to far away districts) and end at 11pm completing reports or driving back home. There are amazing days of working with clinics and outreach staff to deliver nutrition services, and there are long board room days strategizing and planning. There are then office days of admin, and reviewing reports, and hospital days of clinical audits and monitoring. In summary no 2 days are the same.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about the work you do? What are the most satisfying moments?\n\nDeveloping and implementing interventions that brings about positive change gives me gratitude and appreciation for being in the field of nutrition. Dietetics is dynamic and vast and there is so much we can do, even with little. Having the opportunity to support and mentor younger dietitians also gives me joy, for as much as they develop I also learn from them along the way.\n\nWhat has been your career highlight?\n\nCompleting my Master’s degree whilst working full time in a demanding job, taking care of my family and living life. It felt impossible at times and I felt like giving up.\n\nWhat are the most challenging aspects of your career?\n\nAt times the fruits of your labour are also dependent on bigger systems and challenges beyond your control.\n\nWhat is something that people don’t know about you?\n\nI am able to read, write and speak in my mother tongue (Tamil – a South Indian tamil language) and\n\nI’m also a qualified Bharatha Natyam (South Indian classical) dancer, although a bit rusty now.\n\nWhat are your favourite foods?\n\nSushi & crab curry\n\nWhat are the three things that you think people should stop saying when they meet a dietitian?\n\nCan I have a diet sheet?\n\nDon’t look at what I’m eating.\n\nYou must cook very healthy things at home\n\nSWEET POTATO AND OAT MUFFINS\n\nBy Kelly Francis\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 cup mashed sweet potato (roasted)\n\n1/2 cup canola oil\n\n2 whole eggs, large\n\n1/2 cup plain, fat free yoghurt\n\n1 teaspoon vanilla essence\n\n1/3 cup brown sugar\n\n2 cups oat flour\n\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n\n1 teaspoon cinnamon\n\nMethod:\n\nPreheat the oven to 180°C and line a muffin tray with paper cups\n\nMake oat flour by grinding rolled oats until fine.

We thought it well to meet up with her and get to know her a bit better.\n\nTell us a bit more of yourself?\n\nMy name is Michelle Zietsman and I am 27 years young. I live in Pretoria with my amazing husband Mauritz, who is a Youth Pastor at Every Nation Hennopspark. We have two fur babies (pugs), Britney and Bruno. Bruno was named after my husband’s favourite Manchester United soccer player, Bruno Fernandez. I have one older sister who is an engineer and always helps me with my excel spreadsheets as I just cannot get the hang of it. My sister and I are extremely close, although she is moving to the Netherlands at the end of the year so I will miss her dearly. But luckily, we will get to visit them and get to explore the beautiful country. We are a very close family. My parents live in Cape Town so we try to visit them as often as we can.\n\nI have been a Registered Dietitian for almost 6 years now and I still feel like I am just scratching the surface of all the amazing things we can do and be as dietitians. I love growing in the dietetic field and as a person, and I love how being a dietitian has contributed to shaping and molding me into the person I am today.\n\nWhy did you become a Registered Dietitian?\n\nI have known without a doubt since I was 15 that I wanted to be a dietitian. I developed an interest in nutrition and I was so intrigued with how food choices can affect our physical, emotional and spiritual well-being in either a positive or not-so-positive way.\n\nWhat would you have wanted to do if not Dietetics?\n\nThis is a tough question for me because it has always been dietetics. But I think I would still choose to be a health care professional, maybe a nurse, speech therapist or occupational therapist? And if not a healthcare professional, then definitely a chef with a restaurant that provided unique culinary experiences!\n\nWhere did you study (degree and/ or postgrad)\n\nI obtained my BSc Degree in Dietetics at the North-West University. I also completed a Higher Certificate in Christian Counselling at the South Africa Theological Seminary and I am currently studying towards becoming a South African Certified Lactation consultant.\n\nWhere do you work and what does your job entail?\n\nI work at En Bonne Santé Dieticians, which is a dietetic private practice. En Bonne Santé is French for “In Good Health”. I provide nutrition counselling, support and guidance for individuals to achieve their lifestyle goals, no matter where you are in your health journey. I have a special interest in women’s health and nutritional intervention for chronic diseases. I also consult with those who wish to follow a vegan or vegetarian lifestyle, or those interested in eating more plant-based. I aim to promote eating patterns that emphasize whole plant foods not only for health and well-being but also for sustainable and compassionate living.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about the work you do? What are the most satisfying moments?\n\nI love when my clients rediscover that even though food is about health, it is also about culture, fun, family and relationship. And when they break free from the restrict-binge cycle.\n\nWhat has been your career highlight?\n\nThat is still a work in progress 😉\n\nWhat are the most challenging aspects of your career?\n\nAt the moment, I feel like the biggest challenge for me is that many well-meaning individuals, without a degree in Dietetics, are claiming to be nutrition experts and are promoting extreme diets or they want to sell weight-loss products. In most cases, people’s beliefs regarding health and weight are affected negatively and this can lead to an unhealthy relationship with food. These restrictive health beliefs are challenging for clients to release. But as I mentioned earlier, the most satisfying moments are when people break free from restrictive diets and realize that a real healthy lifestyle is much more abundant.\n\nWhat is something that people don’t know about you?\n\nI follow a Vegan lifestyle 😊\n\nWhat are your favourite foods?\n\nI love tropical fruits OR Mexican style dishes with beans, guacamole and salsa OR a Curry.\n\nWhat are the three things that you think people should stop saying when they meet a dietitian?\n\n“Please don’t look at the food I dish up” OR “oh you must put me/my spouse on a diet” when you are at a Braai OR “what do you think about the Blood Group diet?”\n\nMeet the Dietitian: Janke Draper\n\nWe caught up with Janke Draper, who serves on the ADSA Executive Committee in the Membership portfolio for the term 2021 – 2023. We met up with her to get to know her a bit better!\n\nTell us a bit more of yourself?\n\nI am a wife of the best husband in the world and a mother of three lovely boys. My favourite place to be is at home and I like to spend time outside with my family.\n\nWhy did you become a Registered Dietitian?\n\nI am not exactly sure about how exactly I decided to become a dietitian, it always feels as if the profession chooses me…and not the other “expected” way around.\n\nWhat would you have wanted to do if not Dietetics?\n\nWhen I was a little girl I wanted to become a teacher. But now since I have my own children I think it is better that I did not become a teacher, even though I do teach patients on a daily basis, so it is a win-win!\n\nWhere did you study (degree and/ or postgrad)\n\nI completed my B.Sc. Dietetics degree at the University of the Free State and then I obtained my Master’s degree in dietetics also at the UFS.\n\nWhere do you work and what does your job entail?\n\nI am a proud public servant. I am the sole dietitian at a TB Specialist Hospital in the province of the rising sun in a small town, Standerton and I also act as the food service manager.\n\nWalk us through a day in your life?\n\nLoads of administration, ward rounds, kitchen visits, training at clinics and lots of meetings. I used to travel a lot, but since the COVID-19 pandemic, we travel less and attend more online meetings and training. And then of course, when I get home after work, my “real” work starts (the job to keep three little busy boys alive).\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about the work you do? What are the most satisfying moments?\n\nThe best part of my work is when I get the opportunity to teach and interact with patients. And the most satisfying moments are when we notice some positive change.\n\nWhat has been your career highlight?\n\nI think over the period of nine years there have been many significant highlights, but a personal highlight was when I was nominated and selected as one of the top three public service dietitians in Mpumalanga Province in 2018.\n\nWhat are the most challenging aspects of your career?\n\nThe world of dietetics is unlimited and the research is forever changing, so for me the biggest challenge is to stay up to date with the newest findings in as many nutrition aspects as possible.\n\nWhat is something that people don’t know about you?\n\nI am a cat lover and I dream of adopting my own Maine Coon cat one day.\n\nWhat are your favourite foods?\n\nI like a big variety of foods, but I can’t resist a good pasta, soup in the winter, salad and fruit in the summer and chocolate.\n\nWhat are the three things that you think people should stop saying when they meet a dietitian?\n\nAre carbs bad for you?\n\nWhat do you do in a hospital?\n\nWhat is the best weight loss trick?\n\nMEET THE DIETITIAN: COMMUNITY SERVICE SERIES\n\nBy Marcelle Zahn Kruger\n\nHi, I’m Marcelle.\n\nI will try to keep this as short as possible.\n\nA few facts about me; I grew up in Centurion where I matriculated from Hoërskool Zwartkop. Thereafter I moved to Potchefstroom to study at North West University and graduated in 2019. I am currently serving my community service year in Harrismith.\n\nWhen you get to know me, you will realize that I am a very ambitious, hardworking, fast learner who has a passion and love for dietetics. I have always had an interest in nutrition, cooking, baking, health, diseases, science and an urge to help people. I am highly allergic to peanuts and nuts. All these factors contributed to why I became a dietitian.\n\nAs a community service dietitian, I have the wonderful opportunity to practice both as a therapeutic and community dietitian. My job entails quite a lot of different tasks; ward rounds, follow-ups with outpatients, outreaches to the surrounding clinics, planning and organising health and wellness events as well as information days, to name a few. Basically, what a day as a community service dietitian looks like, with the added bonus of coffee with colleagues. With that said, 2020 is not an accurate representation as to what a community service year should look like.\n\nBeing so young and new to the field, I don’t think that I have experienced my career highlight, as yet, and I am looking forward to what it may be. But I can say that the most rewarding aspect of my job is when you see the changes and improvements in your patients, especially paediatric patients, they just show results much faster. As a dietitian we have the privilege to work within a wide field of practice and different types of circumstances as well as work settings. This I enjoy thoroughly, because we are not confined to a limited field of work. But with that said, I also think this contributes to the challenges of being a dietitian, practicing in such a wide scope and that there are always new guidelines or information to stay on top of. Without a challenge, how can you grow?\n\nI find that when people hear I am a dietitian, they make a lot of assumptions and prepare a list of questions to ask. I just want to set the record straight with one of the common assumptions: Yes, I do eat chocolates, some will say it is my favourite food. To those asking about what I think about fad diets, what I suggest they should do regarding weight loss and if I also did a four-week course to become a dietitian, make an appointment and we can discuss all these questions further.\n\nThank you.\n\nMeet the Dietitian: Community Service Series\n\nBy Danisa le Roux\n\nMy community service story looks a little different to most newly graduated community service dietitians. As my graduation drew near, the fear around the reality of my future started to become overwhelming. I started to have countless doubts about the path that I decided to take. Not because I didn’t love what I studied, but because reality hit me that this is what I will be doing for the rest of my working life, and uncertainty started to creep in. The fear of being placed away from my family and friends also gripped me. I graduated in the year 2019 and ended up being placed at a clinic that ended up being, as I feared, far away from my family and friends. Far away from everything I knew.\n\nOut of fear, I decided to decline the position and take a year to regroup and find out if this is really what I wanted to do with my life. Sometimes it’s important to be 100% sure. Long story short, I ended up being excited to apply for my community service year (round 2) for 2021, and no matter where I was to be placed, I knew this time I was certain, even if the distance was scary. I ended up being placed at Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital, which is a dream come true, seeing that my passion is paediatrics.\n\nI decided to become a dietitian because I knew that this is where my passion lies. I have a heart for maternal and child nutrition and working with children has always been a dream of mine (second to having my own children one day). I also have a passion for food and health, as well as for people in general. Dietetics covers all these passions and was therefore the ideal career path for me.\n\nI studied at Stellenbosch University, and am so grateful for the incredible friends, and now colleagues, that I made during my 4 years of studying.\n\nAt Red Cross Hospital my main focus is optimizing nutrition within the first 1000 days of life. I work in the short stay ward, gastro ward as well as trauma ward. I, therefore, see many patients who present with malnutrition in all its forms (Failure to thrive, underweight babies, SAM/MAM, micronutrient deficiencies, etc.) I have also (nearly) mastered the effective management of acute and chronic gastroenteritis through the guidance of my incredible colleagues. On occasion, I will also cover the longer stay wards where I will see various patients who need feeding prescriptions and nutritional support either orally or via tube feeding. I also run our obesity, general, infectious disease and Cerebral Palsy clinics. And my favourite part of it all is providing breastfeeding support and education to mothers who need it.\n\nMy main challenge when stepping into my community service year was the extra hours I needed to put in to refresh my theory after being out of practice and studies for just over a year. The knowledge came back quickly, however, and with practice and guidance from my colleagues, my confidence in patient care and management improved tremendously.\n\nIf I could encourage any future community service dietitians/fellow community dietitians with anything it would be the following:\n\nFollow your passion no matter how scary it might be.\n\nPut in the extra study/research time. Continued learning is good and helps a lot.\n\nDon’t be afraid to ask questions. Everyone was once where you are.\n\nIf you make mistakes, it’s not the end of the world. You will grow and learn from them. I had to, and still constantly have to remind myself of this.\n\nMeet the Dietitian: Community Service Series\n\nBy Elske Rich\n\nWhen it came to choosing a career path I knew one thing: I want to help people. This combined with my passion for Biology at school led me to find dietetics. At the University of the Free State, I met the most amazing group of ladies and lecturers who made me fall in love with all aspects of Dietetics. Now I adore this profession and its neverending possibilities.\n\nI completed my Community Service year at the fairly new and very small Albert Nzula District Hospital in Trompsburg, about 120km from Bloemfontein. Situated next to the N1 right in the heart of the Free State this hospital was sometimes the only option for a higher level of medical care for up to seventeen small surrounding towns. This means that I spent half of my time driving to surrounding clinics and the other half in the hospital treating in- and out-patients or managing the food service unit along with the other Dietitians.\n\nThis hospital was my first choice as I worked in Trombsburg as a student. I knew the area and the type of patient that was to be expected but I never expected to gain so much happiness. Albert Nzula only opened its doors for the first time about four years ago. This meant that the Dietetics department had so much room for growth which excited me a lot. I spent my spare time developing educational material and organising wellness events as far as COVID-19 allowed in order to promote the profession.\n\nChallenges included limited staff during the pandemic but this allowed me to feed patients and help them with sip feeds when there were not enough hands available. There was also no parenteral nutrition or a theatre but luckily Bloemfontein was not too far away. It became a part of the job to get creative with feeds in the hospital setting and spend long hours on the road driving to clinics that were far away. During the pandemic, it also became our job to supervise the food service aspect of the quarantine and isolation sites in the district. So not one day was the same.\n\nIf you know me, you know I love public speaking. As a result, all the health talks at the clinics were memorable to me. Especially when I got the patients to interact and start holding each other accountable as a community for their individual health goals. In addition, what I adored most was just really talking to people and seeing the impact of very small but significant changes in their life. I also really enjoyed visiting the clinics and having an excuse to hold and weigh all the babies!\n\nI encourage you to make the best of every situation by looking at what service you offer from a patient’s point of view. If your approach is one filled with compassion and determination you can help every single person around you. I always say: “Everyone eats so there must be something I can help with.”\n\nPROTECTING BREASTFEEDING IS A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY\n\nBreastfeeding is the recommended ideal, a natural and sustainable food for the healthy growth and development of infants and young children. Yet, South Africa’s breastfeeding rates, at all ages, are low. The recommendation for infants 0 – six months is exclusive breastfeeding (feeding breastmilk only). The rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life was reported at just 32% at the last national survey in 2016. While that figure falls far short of the World Health Organisation (WHO) global target of 50% by 2025, it signals a slight improvement over the past years for the country.\n\nThe effort to improve breastfeeding rates has shifted from focusing on mostly mothers and health care workers, to look across our society and identify all the contact points with mothers and ways that mothers may be discouraged and or even persuaded to give up on breastfeeding their babies. This has led to efforts to include all sectors throughout the healthcare system, the non-profit and community-based organisations, workplace settings and families to unite in protecting breastfeeding and creating a culture where the whole society fully supports breastfeeding mums.\n\nWe often don’t realise that we may be discouraging breastfeeding and may have little idea of the health impacts on both mothers and babies if exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life doesn’t happen. It’s quite another thing though, to answer a call to become a protector of breastfeeding. How do we do this? It starts with understanding the barriers to breastfeeding that many mothers face. Breastfeeding education in South Africa is insufficient and there is often not enough skilled healthcare support for new mothers to help them overcome early challenges. The answer to any sign of a struggle is too often a recommendation to abandon breastfeeding and switch to infant formula products. In a upper-middle income country, this is a move that not only compromises the health of mom and baby but adds a significant household expense impacting on the entire family.\n\nHowever, the challenges of breastfeeding exclusively for six months, and ongoing breastfeeding on demand are not limited to our healthcare facilities and services. Key to successful breastfeeding is that moms are empowered to feed their babies anytime and anywhere, which means they need broad-based support across society. Dr Chantell Witten, a Registered Dietitian and spokesperson for ADSA, (The Association for Dietetics in South Africa), points out that moms can face significant roadblocks to breastfeeding their babies even when this delicate process went well for them after the birth of their baby. She says, “Given the many stressors on households, sometimes mothers find themselves in hostile home environments and social circles negative towards breastfeeding. Often influential women in their lives second-guess them or encourage that they feed other foods before their baby is six months old. The need to earn and return to work, puts pressure on moms to give up on breastfeeding. That’s why protecting breastfeeding needs to be a “whole of society” effort to ensure that we have work and social environments that are breastfeeding-friendly.”\n\nIn essence, what we all have to remember is the simple truism that ‘breastfeeding is best’ – for both babies and moms. The straightforward health benefits are all the reasons we need to become protectors of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding from birth supports the healthy development of babies and plays an important role in prevention of all forms of childhood malnutrition including undernutrition, obesity and micronutrient deficiencies. Breast milk contains antibodies which help protect against many childhood illnesses. The risk of breast and ovarian cancers can also be reduced in women who breastfeed.\n\nProfessor Lisanne du Plessis, a fellow ADSA spokesperson and Registered Dietitian and Nutritionist, makes it easy to understand how we can be a protector of breastfeeding:\n\nPartners can help mothers with the domestic workload as well as the caring of the baby. Getting hands-on with baby bathing, burping, talking, singing and playing is a great support. Doing grocery shopping, helping with food preparation and cleaning of the house creates a supportive environment. Raising children was never supposed to be a one-woman job and partners have a major impact on creating a home environment conducive to breastfeeding for optimum mom and baby health.\n\nFamily and friends should be cheerleaders for breastfeeding. It makes such a difference to encourage mothers on their journey to provide their babies with the best nutrition. Be aware of supporting breastfeeding moms anytime and anywhere. Even if you didn’t have a positive breastfeeding experience with your baby, make sure you fully encourage the new moms in your social circle.\n\nWorkplace support can make a real difference when it comes to maintaining breastfeeding after the end of maternity leave. In South Africa, we have few workplace policies that are designed to create an enabling environment to support breastfeeding mothers, and you can be part of ensuring this happens in your company. Breastfeeding moms who have returned to work are entitled to two 30- minute breaks to express breastmilk. A private room and refrigeration facilities for safely storing their breastmilk can provide further support.\n\nSA society needs to be aware of attitudes that discourage breastfeeding, and even shame breastfeeding mothers. Breastfeeding is perfectly natural and should be normalised and championed across SA communities. Do your part to support, promote and protect breastfeeding as a national asset. It makes sense for us to ensure that our breastfeeding moms feel valued for the great choice they are making.\n\nWorld Breastfeeding Week runs from 1 to 7 August 2021. In the midst of the global pandemic with our heightened awareness of the importance of health and robust immunity, it is vital to remember that breastmilk is the optimum food for our babies. Nothing compares, it is priceless. Let’s support and encourage moms in those critical hours after birth, continue the support for the first six months of the baby’s life and also over the longer term as they strive to do their best for their children.\n\nMeet the Dietitian: Community service series\n\nBy Leandré Piek\n\n“Flexibility is key”\n\nI remember doing a “personality test” during my dietetics studies that pointed out that I’m as flexible as a rock, not having the ability to eagerly adapt to new and unexpected environments and changes. This was true of me since I absolutely love structure, or so I thought.\n\nAs I entered my last year in high school, I still had no idea what I wanted to do with my life – but I knew it would be something in medicine and health sciences. It was thus appropriate to go to the open day at the Tygerberg Campus of Stellenbosch University, hoping that I would find some clarity!\n\nThank you to the 4th years at the dietetics stall who convinced me to choose dietetics as my future profession. With no plan B, I applied for the 4-year course, and by grace, I got accepted. With lots of grace, I got through the 4 years to where I am now!\n\nWhere am I now? Not in the Western Cape where I was hoping to be placed (I think a few can relate to this). No, I was placed at Kakamas Hospital in the Northern Cape, and can I just say how grateful I am for being Afrikaans!\n\nDuring my comserve year I am getting the best of both worlds – a mixture of all there is to dietetics. I work in the hospital, at clinics, see out-patients, work in the food service unit, do training and health talks and manage a Severe Acute Malnutrition Project in the district. I absolutely love the variety, although it took me some time to get used to everything. It is not all textbook work, and it is normal to swim a bit before finding solid ground.\n\nOne thing that I can encourage is, to ASK QUESTIONS! Don’t be afraid to learn from others or to show vulnerability. After 4 years of studying, you know a lot, but you don’t know everything. After the anxiety and uncertainty of my comserve placement, I am extremely grateful for the journey so far.\n\nIn a rural setting, you must work with what you have, and this has improved my ability to be flexible and think out of the box! But it is absolutely what you make of it – how you see every opportunity, how you build relationships, how you treat other people, and how you keep on trying to do better.\n\nDon’t be afraid to be flexible – it opens new doors that you didn’t know you needed.\n\nOPTIMISING HEALTHY EATING HABITS\n\nThere’s nothing quite like a (hopefully) once-in-a-lifetime experience of a global pandemic to focus our attention on the status of our health, and the preventative benefits of a healthy lifestyle. As rolling lockdowns have restricted our movements and options, and tightened our belts, we’ve had little choice but to adapt our shopping and exercise habits; and shift our cooking and eating patterns to meet the moment. Now, in the midst of a third wave, many South Africans across economic spectrums are thinking more about how and what we eat; and wondering if our eating habits can help to protect our health in the face of COVID.\n\nAs Registered Dietitian and President of ADSA, (The Association for Dietetics in South Africa), Maria van der Merwe points out when it comes to preventative health, nutrition plays a bigger role than just immune support. “Good nutrition is essential for optimal health across our lifespans. Meeting our changing nutritional needs from infancy through childhood and the teen years, through our adulthood into older age can not only help to increase resilience but helps us to manage our weight, prevent nutritional deficiencies and the development of a range of chronic health conditions. If we do become ill, a balanced diet can help us fight acute health problems and aid in our recovery.”\n\nSo, how is the pandemic shaping our views and habits when it comes to daily eating?\n\nRegistered Dietitian, Dr. Nazeeia Sayed says, “Many South Africans are feeling the economic impacts of the pandemic such as rising food prices and reduced household incomes threatening their household’s food security. With tighter budgets, you can still find affordable, healthy foods and achieve balanced meals. Focusing on increasing your family’s intake of seasonal veg and fruits, whole-grain options like oats, as well as shifting to more plant protein sources such as beans and lentils in place of meat, will save money. Healthy eating is within reach. For instance, traditional foods such as samp and beans, or dahl and rice are tasty, affordable meals that can be supercharged with some extra veg or a salad.”\n\nMany middle-income South Africans have increased their focus on nutritional supplements and so-called ‘functional foods’. Nazeeia points out that, “With vitamins and minerals flying off the shelves, it’s important to note that’s there’s no scientific evidence that any particular food or nutritional supplement or diet that can prevent COVID or any other infections. Your best move is to stick with the healthy eating guidelines and ensure your family is enjoying a variety of foods every day.”\n\nBut what are functional foods?\n\nMaria explains, “Also known as nutraceuticals, functional foods contain particular ingredients that offer health benefits that extend beyond their nutritional value. For example, these ingredients may protect against disease, prevent nutrient deficiencies, and promote proper growth and development. Some examples of functional foods include products enriched with vitamins, minerals, probiotics, or fibre; with each of these ingredients having a specific function. However, by their nature, nutrient-rich whole-foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and wholegrains can also be considered functional foods. For instance, whole-grains like oats and barley contain a type of fibre called beta glucan, which has been shown to reduce inflammation, enhance immune function, and improve heart health. Similarly, fruits and vegetables are packed with antioxidants, which are beneficial compounds that help protect against disease. So, increasing your family’s access to functional foods in an affordable way is as simple as including more fresh vegetables and fruit, legumes and whole-grains in our daily meals.”\n\nShould we make more home-cooking a keeper in this COVID world?\n\nMost South Africans have cooked more at home over the past 18 months than ever before. Nazeeia says, “Home cooking is great for many different reasons! If you involve the family, especially your children, it is a time to learn more about the food you eat – where it comes from and what it contains. Home cooking inspires us to try new recipes, talk about healthy eating, and explore different global cuisines. This is important modelling for the younger generation and assists in them establishing better eating habits that can last a lifetime. Many of us have access to the internet and you can learn to cook from watching videos, even if you have not done so before.”\n\nMaria agrees, “Cooking at home, from scratch, allows us to use unprocessed or minimally processed foods – foods in their natural state – as the basis of our meals. When we cook our own meals, we can determine how much fat, salt and sugar, if any, are added during meal preparation. Unprocessed foods are more often than not, affordable ‘functional foods’ – nutrient dense and good sources of vitamins, minerals and fibre.”\n\nWhat are the top dietitian tips for getting more preventative nutrition benefits on a tighter budget?\n\nFocus on eating a variety of affordable foods so that you consume a wider spectrum of beneficial nutrients\n\nPrioritise unprocessed foods, including seasonal vegetables and fruits, wholegrains, dried beans and lentils\n\nEat less take-out meals which are often high in salt and fats, and allocate this budget to whole-foods you can prepare at home\n\nReplace drinks with added sugar including sodas, fruit, sports and energy drinks with lots of clean, safe water – you will be amazed at how much you will save on your food budget\n\nReduce your meat intake by focusing on more plant-based eating. Inexpensive dried beans and lentils are tasty replacements in meat dishes, or they can be added as an extra ingredient to stretch out your meat-based meals\n\nIf meat options are becoming too expensive, shift to other more affordable animal-based protein sources such as eggs, maas and yoghurt\n\nPlan your meals and plan your food shopping. Look out for price specials and discounts. Collaborate with your family, friends and neighbours so that you can collectively shop for cheaper bulk buying options.\n\nGrow your own – start a home or community veggie garden and increase your daily access to easy-to-grow veg such as spinach, kale and traditional greens such as marog, as well as onions, beans, beetroot, carrots and tomatoes\n\nMeet the Dietitian: Community service series\n\nBy Chené Vorster\n\n“Stay positive by staying negative.” – The main joke of 2020\n\nI stumbled upon dietetics by accident and I have never looked back. A friend of mine stated that she wanted to become a dietitian and she was going to shadow them in the upcoming holidays. Curious about this unknown career and unsure about what I wanted to study, I decided to do the same. The moment I entered the ICU, I fell in love with dietetics. As the university years progressed along, I realised how big this field was and I was amazed by all the areas we work in. I studied at the University of Pretoria, the “Jakarandastad” gave me fond memories and the opportunity to work from Stanza Bopape CHC to Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital.\n\nDuring the year 2020, I was busy completing my community service year at Thelle Mogoerane Regional Hospital – a 760-bed hospital in Vosloorus, Gauteng. The first three months of the year went well, I was fortunate enough to have another comserve walk this daunting road with me. I ran the medical and surgical wards and occasionally a paediatric ward – everything was going well. I will never forget when a colleague sent me the post with the caption “It’s here”. We had been following this covid-19 but was told it’s too hot in SA. On the 23rd of March, everything started to change. We tried not to panic but the lack of knowledge on this virus and protocols on its treatment, the implication of the lockdown and all the new rules were overwhelming. We can no longer eat together, we had to rotate offices to prevent overcrowding, insufficient PPE and the emotions were running high. We had to close down the OPD and ‘sneak’ out some packages to patients that were being turned away. The importance of a dietitian became very clear during the pandemic and our services were needed all around.\n\nMy wards shifted and I was now in charge of the covid PUI ward, medical wards and occasionally the covid wards. I was terrified to go in there, terrified to walk out – “What if I contracted it?”. The kangaroo pumps ran out and I was feeding patients myself from time to time. The pandemic wasn’t all bad though, I built fond relationships, learned how to dance to Jerusalema, gained so much knowledge and love what I do. I am forever grateful that I could fight on the frontlines.\n\nMy advice to those who are still fighting on the frontlines:\n\nMDTs are very important. Befriend everyone – they are an excellent support structure!\n\nDon’t be intimidated – you have a lot more knowledge than you think. If the opportunity arises, write a protocol or volunteer to assist in a difficult case. Your hard work will not go unnoticed.\n\nBe kind, but don’t allow anyone to walk over you – if there’s a problem, sort it out immediately.\n\nStay positive by staying negative – wear your PPE, wash your hands and sanitize everything. Practice social distancing and be a role model in your community.\n\nROASTED TOMATO SOUP\n\nBy Rhodene Oberholzer\n\nServes 4\n\nIngredients:\n\n6 Medium Tomatoes\n\n2 Small onions\n\n1 Green pepper\n\n2 Garlic cloves\n\n1 Cup cooked split red lentils\n\n500 ml Boiled water\n\n1 Tomato and onion stock cube\n\n1 Cup plain low-fat yoghurt\n\n1 Tablespoon tomato paste\n\n1 Teaspoon ground Cumin\n\n1 Teaspoon Turmeric\n\n½ Teaspoon Cayenne pepper\n\n1 Tablespoon Olive oil / Canola oil\n\nMethod:\n\nPre-heat the oven to 180 °C.\n\nChop the tomatoes, onions and green peppers into chunks and place, along with the garlic cloves, in an ovenproof dish.

Dietetics is a combination of all 3 of these elements and that’s why I chose it!\n\nMy aunt is a dietitian in Namibia and she definitely sparked my interest in this field. I’m so glad that I chose to study dietetics and I can’t see myself in any other job.\n\nI studied at the University of Stellenbosch on Tygerberg campus and graduated at the end of 2019 after 4 hard-working years. I was blessed with the most incredible friends that helped me get through the course! I might be biased, but I believe that we had the best lectures and got the best practical experience on Tygerberg Campus!\n\nI completed my community service year at Rob Ferreira Hospital in Nelspruit, Mpumalanga. It’s a tertiary hospital and we rotated wards every 2 months. I had the best year and made a lot of new friends! My biggest advice to final years would be to choose a tertiary hospital if you want the most clinical/practical experience. Some of my friends in rural clinics never worked with parenteral or enteral feeds, but they still had great health promotion opportunities.\n\nI currently work for a private practice in Nelspruit and I see out-patients at our practice as well as in-patients at two private hospitals in the area. Private is a lot different than government in terms of the environment that you work in, but you still get very good practical experience! The private sector was a big adjustment for me as I wasn’t the only dietitian in a hospital ward anymore. All of a sudden I was being surrounded by several other dietitians.\n\nWhat I love most about my job is seeing the progress that my patients make. It could be someone progressing from a tube feed to oral feeding or a pt coming in for a weight-loss consultation and gradually shedding off the weight to reach her end goal!\n\nMy biggest advice to future dietitians would be to work hard and be like a sponge. Embrace all the new learning curves that come your way! Absorb new information and learn from the mistakes that other health professionals make. Be the best version of yourself!\n\nRECOVERING FROM COVID-19? HERE’S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT NUTRITION\n\nCOVID-19 has impacted infected people in different ways. Some have been asymptomatic; many have had mild cases; some have had to be hospitalised but didn’t need ventilation and others have endured long stays in ICU. There are those who have recovered quickly, but a number of people are suffering from ‘long-COVID’ and experience symptoms that go on for months. As with any other illness, nutrition will play an important role in recovery. Whatever you eat and drink on a daily basis will either be supporting and advancing your return to health or making it more challenging for your body to fully heal. Importantly, good nutrition can help to avoid risks of complications and shorten your recovery time.\n\nAccording to ADSA (The Association for Dietetics in South Africa) people recovering from COVID-19 who also suffer from diabetes and cardiovascular disease need to take special care when it comes to their nutrition during post-COVID recovery. Registered Dietitian and ADSA spokesperson, Andiswa Ngqaka says, “Pregnant women who are recovering from COVID also have questions around nutrition. They feel anxious to return to health as quickly as possible, and of course, want to make sure their bodies are supporting the development of their unborn babies as they recover. In addition, family members who are supporting loved ones who are recuperating at home after a stay in ICU may be facing challenges when it comes to nutrition.”\n\nOmy Naidoo, another ADSA spokesperson and Registered Dietitian points out that people recovering from COVID may still be experiencing health issues. He says, “COVID symptoms such as the loss of taste and smell can persist for quite some time, and these senses have a major impact on appetite. Chronic fatigue, weight loss, loss of muscle mass and general weakness are common too. The main goal of recovery nutrition is to provide enough of the nutrients that support healing, and therefore a loss of appetite is a challenge that needs to be addressed.”\n\nThe general nutrition tips for post-COVID recovery include:\n\nWhen fighting an infection, the body needs more energy and more fluids. Eat a variety of foods every day to ensure balanced nutrition\n\nEat plenty of vegetables and fruit, and include plant-based meals to ensure optimal intake of immune-supporting vitamins and minerals\n\nMake whole grains and high fibre foods (which includes veg, fruit and salads) part of most meals\n\nDrink plenty of clean safe water as adequate hydration is essential to recovery, and focus on hydration particularly if you are still experiencing symptoms such as fever, vomiting and diarrhoea\n\nIn the case of muscle mass loss, focus on a high protein diet to support muscle recovery. Good sources of protein include lean chicken, eggs, dairy and fish, as well as legumes and pulses such as beans, lentils and chickpeas\n\nLimit sugary foods and drinks, highly processed and fast foods\n\nNaidoo points out that different strategies may be necessary if you or your recovering family member is experiencing a chronic loss of appetite. He says, “Oral nutrition supplement drinks may be necessary if the person is unable to consume enough protein and calories each day. Good quality oral nutrition supplement drinks are easy to consume, and they contain a balance of protein, carbohydrates, fat and necessary micronutrients.”\n\nIn addition to general nutrition guidelines, people living with other health conditions and recovering from COVID-19, should take note of Andiswa Ngqaka’s advice:\n\nAdditional nutritional advice for people with diabetes or heart disease recovering from COVID-19\n\nPay attention to your glucose control. Regular control will manage complications caused by low and high glucose levels\n\nIt is important to eat small frequent meals, for instance 3 meals a day and healthy snacks like nuts in between, to avoid any fluctuations of glucose levels. Fluctuations in blood glucose predisposes to serious complications and most commonly diabetes ketoacidosis.\n\nAn ideal diet is high in fibre, whole grains, legumes, with plenty of vegetables and fruits\n\nAvoid sugar and unhealthy fats, reduce salt intake and reduce high fat and processed meat products\n\nFoods that support immunity and reduce inflammation are important for the heart. Focus on vegetables and fruits of different colours to provide a spectrum of vitamins and minerals to support the immune system.\n\nInfections such as COVID-19 contribute to a rise in blood sugar therefore you must ensure you drink sufficient fluids – clean safe water is best\n\nIt is important not to overwork and to get a good night’s sleep\n\nAdditional nutritional advice for people recovering from COVID-19 after being in ICU\n\nAddress loss of appetite by encouraging small, frequent meals and encourage a variety of foods to provide different nutrients\n\nFocus on foods that are rich are vitamins and minerals, such as vegetables and fruit, high fibre and wholegrain foods\n\nAim to have a high protein food at each meal, to help replace muscle loss and regain your strength\n\nA dietitian can recommend oral nutritional supplement drinks that may be necessary\n\nAdditional nutritional advice for pregnant women recovering from COVID-19\n\nInclude foods rich in iron, such as spinach, asparagus, broccoli, dried apricots, lentils, beans, eggs, fish, chicken and lean red meat\n\nInclude foods rich in folate, such as brussels sprout, mushrooms, green leafy vegetables, peas, chickpeas, kidney beans, lentils, butter beans and soya beans\n\nIf you’re feeling a loss of appetite, focus on healthy snacks and creating more frequent healthy mini meals\n\nIt is important to rest well and take it easy during recovery\n\nWhat’s most important is that if you or a recovering loved one are experiencing difficulty following these guidelines, then you should get help. Nutrition is too important to recovery to struggle on alone with an inadequate intake of nutrients. Your dietitian can help you with an individualised plan to meet your unique post-COVID recovery nutrition challenges and provide ongoing patient support. They can provide expert guidance and recommendations when it comes nutrient-rich, fortified, tasty foods and special supplements that will support rehabilitation, reduce risks of complications and shorten your recovery time.\n\nTo find a registered dietitian in your area, please visit www.adsa.org.za\n\nThe Importance Of Nutrition In Fighting Cancer\n\nAs many of us know all too well, a cancer diagnosis for you or a loved one is a sea change. While day-to-day life goes on, cancer symptoms and the ongoing effects of treatments usher in a myriad of adjustments. Typically, our food preferences and eating habits are deeply entrenched, and therefore, getting optimally supportive nutrition can be challenging, but it is vitally important.\n\nAs a Registered Dietitian and spokesperson for ADSA, (The Association for Dietetics in South Africa), Omy Naidoo points out, “Cancer propels the body into a catabolic state where both muscle mass and fat are breaking down, therefore the nutritional needs of cancer patients increases. To meet this, there needs to be a careful focus on protein, calorie, and vitamin intake.\n\nUnfortunately, this need for increased nutrition comes at a time when it’s highly common to experience a general loss of appetite and the side effects of treatment that can seriously impair a patient’s interest in eating. This makes a focus on nutrition a critical part of a patient’s cancer journey.”\n\nRevealing a cancer diagnosis in your circle often opens the floodgates to well-meaning nutritional advice that can lead to going down unhelpful ‘rabbit-holes’. There’s a mass of information and promotion around ‘alternative’ or ‘natural’ cancer nutritional support, even cancer ‘nutritional cures’. This can be overwhelming, confusing, and frustrating during a vulnerable time. It is important to note that there is currently no scientific evidence that any particular food, food supplement, or diet can cure cancer.\n\nCancer patients in both the private and the public healthcare systems do have access to the support of a dietitian, who is the only health professional that has specifically qualified in evidence-based nutrition. If you’re feeling uncertain about what you or your loved one should be eating and drinking, it’s time to ask your doctor to help bring a dietitian onboard. It’s important to discuss any natural remedy you want to introduce with your doctor or dietitian to ensure that there are no unintended interactions with the treatment you are undergoing.\n\nWhile nutritional support for cancer patients focuses on avoiding malnutrition, some foods are allies, and some are to be avoided. Another ADSA spokesperson, Registered Dietitian, Faaizah Laher puts it in a nutshell:\n\nFoods to avoid during cancer treatment and recovery:\n\nAvoid or limit alcohol\n\nAvoid or limit highly refined, highly processed foods\n\nLimit foods high in sugar, including sweets, cakes and sugary drinks\n\nLimit foods that are high in salt\n\nLimit foods that are high in animal fats\n\nAvoid or limit cured meats such as bacon, ham and sausages\n\nFocus instead on\n\nEating lots of fresh vegetables and fruits every day\n\nEnjoying lean animal protein such as chicken breast and fish\n\nIncluding more plant-based foods high in protein such as beans, lentils, peas, chickpeas, quinoa and soy-based foods\n\nChoosing whole-grain options such as brown bread, brown rice and wholewheat pasta\n\nIncreasing your intake of nuts and seeds\n\nFocusing on sources of healthy fats such as olive oil, avocados and fatty fish like sardines\n\nTips for bypassing the typical nutritional roadblocks\n\nOmy Naidoo says, “Cancer patients undergoing treatment often experience a severe loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, as well as dysgeusia which is taste alterations. Very often these patients need high protein, vitamin-containing supplements which they drink 2-3 times per day. Some patients need tailored diets to help them get through spells of nausea and vomiting, and this is exactly how your dietitian can help you.\n\nIt’s important to remember that cancer patients need more nutrition, however, they typically end up taking in much less than usual due to these symptoms. The nett effect of this is that patients can lose muscle mass and become malnourished. This is precisely what you want to avoid as malnutrition then becomes an independent risk factor for poorer outcomes.”\n\nIf you or a loved one are dealing with these challenges, then you need to reset your daily nutritional regime:\n\nFocus on smaller, lighter meals eaten more frequently than the standard three meals a day\n\nExperiment with healthy snack foods that are always on hand such as wholewheat crackers, nuts, seeds, fruits and vegetables\n\nTry out delicious nutrient-rich smoothies\n\nAdd nuts and seeds to yoghurt, cereals, smoothies, and even casseroles\n\nMake frozen lolly treats from fresh fruit juices, fruit, yoghurt and smoothies\n\nUse nutritional supplements prescribed by your health professional\n\nMost important is to remember that combatting malnutrition is your goal. Take action and get professional nutritional advice to help the cancer patient maintain their weight as best as possible.\n\nHealthy nutrition also reduces your risk of cancer\n\nWhile some risk factors for cancer cannot be changed, research shows that 30 to 50% of major cancers can be prevented by following a healthy lifestyle. Faaizah Laher says, “While there is no guaranteed way to prevent cancer, a healthy lifestyle can help reduce your risk of developing many cancers and positively support treatment and recovery if you are diagnosed with cancer.\n\nThink of eating the colours of a rainbow and lots of variety of nutritious foods (such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes). Along with healthy eating, an active lifestyle and maintaining a healthy weight play important roles in reducing risk and boosting your resilience.”\n\nMeet the Dietitian: Community Service Series\n\nMy Unexpected Journey\n\nWritten by JéJéan du Plessis\n\nAs a little girl walking around the grocery store, it was the norm for me to turn around the pretty pictures of products and focus on the more ‘boring’ nutritional information.\n\nThis was to ensure that I stay clear from any allergens that could lead to an eventful trip to the hospital. Being surrounded by all of the knowledge of food as a child (and now adult) with severe allergies, it was quite inevitable for me to find a passion for nutrition, thus leading me to study dietetics at the NWU Potchefstroom Campus.\n\nLike most of us, while studying for my degree at Potchefstroom, I quickly developed a love for therapeutic nutrition. Any form of Hospital assignments or practicals were written in my diary with the most beautiful washi tapes and highlighters, and during my last year, I was completely fascinated by all hepatic- and liver-related diseases.\n\nThis led me to be deeply disappointed, as I was not placed at either of my five options for my Community Service Year. I was placed in the District Office in Ekurhuleni, which is Clinic-based work. Yet, and to my surprise, I am enjoying it tremendously! I mostly see outpatients throughout my day; do in-service training with the clinic staff members; are responsible for health campaigns; visit surrounding ECD centres; Old Age Homes; and Mental Health Institutions.\n\nIn the past few months, my love for Community Nutrition grew overwhelmingly, and I was never aware of just how rewarding this spectrum of dietetics can be! You walk a close path with each of your patients, struggle with them to find a suitable diet, and try different approaches to see which will fit their lifestyle best. Through this process, you really get to know the person sitting on the other side of the table, which truly spoke to me, as you can really feel the difference you make in most lives.\n\nA new field of interest for me is definitely Diabetes and the nutritional management thereof, since I quickly realised that these people’s way of living is changing drastically within a few weeks from diagnoses, and giving them the best possible support will make the worlds difference to them, but that can also be said about any patient seen in the clinic setting.\n\nThe moral of my story is the following:\n\nThe biggest curveballs in life can be full of opportunities and self-exploration experiences that will ensure huge growth within you as an individual, and newly graduated dietitian.\n\nAlways remember that you are making a difference, no matter if you are calculating a TPN feed in an ICU setting, or if you are working at the local clinic with patients who really need your expert advice to live the best possible quality of life.\n\nMeet the Dietitian: Community Service Series\n\nBy Ilse Gravett\n\nAt the end of every stage in our lives, we find ourselves in a tricky position where we need to decide what our next step is. For a 17/18-year-old, it is quite daunting, well it was for me. I had so many different ideas of where I wanted to be and what I wanted to become. Eventually, I applied to study medicine at the University of Pretoria, and dietetics at the North West University. I got accepted for both medicine and dietetics, but I chose dietetics. Deep inside me, I knew that I wanted to do more and be more. Please don’t get me wrong; all doctors are real superheroes and I have a huge amount of respect for each one of them! There were times that I even wanted to be one of them. But it was not until my final year that I realised the honour and privilege of being a dietitian. Being a dietitian, you get to really make a difference in a person’s every-day life. Essentially, everyone needs to eat, and you get to be the expert. You get to work with the sick and the healthy, the individual and the community. So here I am, already in the last week of my community service year.\n\nI got placed in a hospital I have never heard of in a town I didn’t even know existed. St Patrick’s Hospital, Bizana, Eastern Cape. What a blessing! Looking back, I know that I have learned so much – some might even help you on your journey:\n\nShare your knowledge. We forget that information that seems like common sense to us, might prevent severe acute malnutrition in a toddler or help the sweet old lady gain control of her blood pressure.\n\nBe extra… Okay, not annoyingly extra, but be extra kind and go the extra mile. You have no idea what battle your patient or even colleagues are fighting, so never underestimate the power of that.\n\nDon’t settle for the “lack of resources” excuse. Rural hospitals are challenging on a whole different level. In most cases, you don’t have all the fancy feeds or even a feeding pump. This means you really need to think outside the box and get creative. You are the expert; you can do it!\n\nFocus less on yourself. With this I don’t mean let yourself burn out – please take your break when necessary. But you are doing this year to serve the community. So, don’t always think about how much you can get out of a situation but how much you can give. Once you do that, you will feel how you automatically grow.\n\nLook on the bright side. One of the biggest challenges I had to face this year, was to accept the fact that I will only see “basic” cases. And wow, how my perception of “basic” cases changed. Every case has so much detail to it and a lot that you can master.\n\nGive it time. This is probably the most cliché of them all, but really – give it time. It doesn’t all happen overnight, and that’s okay. Be open to growth and to learn from those who have been there longer. They have a different kind of knowledge that books don’t have.\n\nEnjoy! Make friends with anyone, have inside jokes with the cleaners, get to know all the different cultures, and make every day an adventure.\n\nIn the end, it’s all up to you and the choices you make each day. I hope you choose to make it the best 365 days of your life!\n\nWHY ‘EAT LESS, MOVE MORE’ IS NOT OBESITY’S SILVER BULLET\n\nWe would like to believe there may be small, simple solutions to big problems, but when is that actually true? The answer is probably, never. Intractable, extreme issues arise out of complexity, and nothing less than a host of multi-dimensional, cross-functional countermeasures issued at the right time and the right place can bring about sustainable transformation.\n\nObesity, a disease characterized by the interaction of genetic, behavioural, metabolic and environmental factors, embodies a complex matter requiring a comprehensive approach. A quick glance at the South African context (marked with more than 41% of women being obese) highlights that combatting obesity in South Africa will require more than a one size fits all approach.\n\nThis is why advising people who are obese to just consume fewer calories while burning more energy is not just doomed to fail but damaging to vulnerable people.\n\nObesity is a health condition beyond overweight that soars past trite platitudes. Research has shown that restricting calories while boosting exercise only makes a paltry 3 to 5% difference to sustainable weight loss and weight management. This is staggering, and it points out that the roots of obesity run deep – in the unseen details of our DNA; in the shadowy intricacies of our individual psychology, and day-to-day, in the banality of our homes, workplaces and communities where bias and shame are uncontested.\n\nWorld Obesity Day, the 4th of March, is a time to acknowledge the global increase of obesity and its long-term impacts, while providing hope through awareness and education. Having a loved one on the brink, or all the way down the road, causes all involved parties to grapple with bona fide existential fear. Obesity puts one at risk for a host of other medical conditions such as non-communicable diseases, and it is too complex to solve with simple calorie restrictions plus exercise.\n\nDr Christine Taljaard-Krugell, President for ADSA (The Association for Dietetics in South Africa) says, “Simplifying obesity to one cause could prevent effective treatment. It ignores the various root causes such as biology, food, genetic risk, healthcare access, life events, marketing and sleep. Hence, when tackling obesity as a chronic disease, an evidence-based approach should be followed. Holistic patient care is critical. While cutting back on calories and increasing exercise is a relevant start and lays a foundation for healthy living at a healthy weight, it’s not the be all and end all when you’re aiming for sustainable change. This is a misconception that needs to shift.”\n\nIn recognition of World Obesity Day, the National Department of Health has stated that “it welcomes a broader view when it comes to dealing with obesity in South Africa, which is at an all-time high. Obesity is defined as a prevalent, chronic condition that impairs health, increases morbidity, and renders people prone to relapsing.”\n\nObesity care cannot simply be about diet and exercise advice; it should include intensive nutritional therapy led by registered dietitians, physical activity programmes, pharmacotherapy, as well as psychological, and even surgical interventions. For sustainability, the root drivers of obesity must be dealt with. These may b"
