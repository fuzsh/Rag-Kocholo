This is one of a special series of short episodes speaking to some of the best comedians appearing at this year's Edinburgh Fringe! These episodes will be released daily during the week of 8 August 2022.

Schalk Bezuidenhout was born in Kempton Park or as he calls it - 'The New York of the East Rand'. His family and friends stood back as they watched Schalk evolve from an Afrikaans conservative caterpillar into a beautiful dramaqueen butterfly, complete with a moustache and furry afro. It was obvious to Schalk's parents that he would study drama, and to help numb the pain they sent him away to study at the University of Cape Town. While studying in Cape Town Schalk slowly began to realise that there was so much more to life than boerewors and rugby, and started doing stand-up in April 2011.

We had great fun chatting to Schalk and learning how he got into stand-up, including hearing about his... interesting venue for his first paid gig, the differences between South African and UK stand ups, and much more!
