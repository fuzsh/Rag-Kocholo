One thing i like about Indian Cinema is its ability to recognize real-life heroes. I don't think there is a single person there who's done something extraordinary and doesn't have a movie on his life.

Beautiful storytelling. A style something Hansal Mehta has adopted quite well in films done later.

Also, talking about cinematic universe, something Rohit Shetty recently tried his hands at. Mind you, Hansal Mehta did it first. He's made Omerta and Shahid set in the same world.

A very important biographical drama on the life of late Shahid azmi.. this film is more relevant today than ever as all of it is happening much more in today's india and there is no one to tell those stories.

A criminal has no religion, nor does the one who endures the crime.

In the end, both the killer and his victim are human beings.

It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer. -William Blackstone

One of the tightest screenplays I've seen in a courtroom drama. Respect! Shahid Azmi and props to Rajkumar Rao and Hansal Mehta for making such a wonderful portrayal of an amazing person. Got their well-deserved appreciation through their national awards but not bo wise sadly.

Pirates are evil? The Marines are righteous? These terms have always changed throughout the course of history! Kids who have never seen peace and kids who have never seen war have different values! Those who stand at the top determine what's wrong and what's right! This very place is neutral ground!

Justice will prevail, you say? But of course it will! Whoever wins this war becomes justice! ~Donquixote Doflamingo
