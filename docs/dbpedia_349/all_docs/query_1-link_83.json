Rhodes Editorial Board: Lizelle Bisschoff, Stephanie Hemelryck Donald, Anna Misiak and Des O’Rawe\n\nReFocus is a series of contemporary methodological and theoretical approaches to the interdisciplinary analyses and interpretations of international film directors, from the celebrated to the ignored, in direct relationship to their respective culture – its myths, values and historical precepts – and the broader parameters of international film history and theory. The series provides a forum for introducing a broad spectrum of directors, working in and establishing movements, trends, cycles and genres including those historical, currently popular, or emergent, and in need of critical assessment or reassessment. It ignores no director who created a historical space – either in or outside of the studio system – beginning with the origins of cinema and up to the present. ReFocus brings these film directors to a new audience of scholars and general readers of Film Studies. Titles in the series include: ReFocus: The Films of Susanne Bier Edited by Missy Molloy, Mimi Nielsen and Meryl Shriver-Rice ReFocus: The Films of Francis Veber Keith Corson ReFocus: The Films of Jia Zhangke Maureen Turim and Ying Xiao ReFocus: The Films of Xavier Dolan Edited by Andrée Lafontaine ReFocus: The Films of Pedro Costa: Producing and Consuming Contemporary Art Cinema Nuno Barradas Jorge ReFocus: The Films of Sohrab Shahid Saless: Exile, Displacement and the Stateless Moving Image Edited by Azadeh Fatehrad edinburghuniversitypress.com/series/refocint\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd ii\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\nReFocus: The Films of Sohrab Shahid Saless Exile, Displacement and the Stateless Moving Image Edited by Azadeh Fatehrad\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd iii\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\nThis book is dedicated to Deep, for his true love\n\nEdinburgh University Press is one of the leading university presses in the UK.

The initial starting point was a personal fascination with the work of this remarkable filmmaker, which led to the development of the first UK retrospective on his work (co-curated with Nikolaus Perneczky, October 2017 to January 2018), alongside the first English-language book on the director. During the retrospective, eleven films were screened at three sites – Close-Up Cinema (East London), Institute of Contemporary Art (Central London) and Goethe-Institut London (West London) - to reach as wide an audience as possible and share our admiration for Shahid Saless’s outstanding practice. We are pleased to report that the project was a great success. Through ReFocus: The Films of Sohrab Shadid Saless, its selected chapters and contributions from remarkable scholars, you will notice the unique condition of Shahid Saless’s films as a stateless archive and will be provided with a deeper insight into the filmmaker’s practice, as well as the notion of curating stateless moving images. This project has been made possible through the generous support of many individuals and institutes. I would like to thank Professor Fran Lloyd, Professor Stephen Barber, Gillian Leslie, Gary D.

He made his mark on the international film festival circuit with the enormous success of his two Iranian-made feature films: A Simple Event (Yek Ettefaq-e Sadeh, 1974) and Still Life (Tabiate Bijan, 1974), the latter winning the Silver Bear at the Berlinale in 1974. After his move to Germany in 1975, from 1975 he went on to direct a considerable body of feature-length projects, including long works for television, and culminating in the drama Roses for Africa (Rosen für Afrika, 1992), for which he was awarded the German Television Prize. While his Iranian films were concerned with the marginal lives of the downtrodden and disenfranchised, in Germany, this ‘guest-worker’ (as he would call himself) looked to the agony of homelessness and displacement, and the cruelty of the bureaucratic system: a reflection of his own life in Germany, without permanent residency status and fighting continuously for film funding. Despite his long career in the German film industry and the acclaim that has greeted his films, Shahid Saless is rarely mentioned in scholarly literature and, except for a few short articles, there is a total lack of scholarship in English on the life and work of this visionary and transnational artist. The present book, which follows in the footsteps of the first UK retrospective of his work in 2018, promises to fill the lacunae. Iran Heritage Foundation is proud to have supported the UK retrospective and the publication of this book.

In dozens of ‘heres,’ in dozens of ‘theres,’ that you didn’t know, that you don’t recognize. Dark zones that used to be bright. Light zones that used to be heavy. You no longer end up in yourself, and reality, even objects, lose their mass and stiffness and no longer put up any serious resistance to the everpresent transforming mobility.1\n\nT\n\nhis volume is the first English-language book on this remarkable but neglected Iranian–German filmmaker (1944–98). Shahid Saless’s work belongs to no single place or canon; it is a continent of its own – a central massif of cinema, as one critic notes. The director’s slow-paced films tell simple stories almost without words, in meditative but searing images that register the smallest of details. His close attention to the routines and repetitions of everyday life is mirrored in the rhythmic flow of his films and in the clockworkprecision play of sound and silence. In addition to cinema, he engaged in other mediums such as television and literature. Moving across cultures, from prerevolutionary Iran to post-war West Germany and the former Czechoslovakia, he observes the world with an unflinching eye, alert to cruelty and injustice, but never judging. Shahid Saless led a fascinating, if at times sad and lonely, life. Fleeing from his native Iran in 1974 and making Germany his new home, he did enjoy some success there but eventually had to leave in 1992, due to the difficulty of securing funds for his projects and finding it hard to support himself generally. He died just a few years later, alone in a rental flat in Chicago. This book provides an overview and analysis of Shahid Saless’s lifetime work, produced in Iran,\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 1\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\n2\n\nA Z A D E H FAT E H R A D\n\nGermany and the USA, through a set of comprehensive contributions from leading scholars in the field. The book is divided into three major parts. The first covers Shahid Saless’s time in Iran, including the inspiration he took from the great Chekhov, and his minimalist mise-en-scène and use of non-professional actors in A Simple Event (1974) and Still Life (1974). It continues by reflecting on Shahid Saless’s work in West Germany; this includes Utopia (1982), which offers a form of social critique of the life of women in Berlin during the 1970s. This is followed by theoretical reflections on categorising Shahid Saless’s work as an Iranian filmmaker abroad – from exilic to diasporic, émigré, ethnic, cosmopolitan and beyond. Here, the ironic language of Shahid Saless’s filmmaking, as witnessed in Time of Maturity (1976) and Far from Home (1975), is seen as offering a ‘counter-protocol’ to the norms prevailing in society at that time. In the second part, the book refers to the notion of ‘cinema of exile’, using Shahid Saless as a case study to reflect on certain aesthetic, stylistic, financial and socio-political regularities in the lives of those creatives who have chosen to make a new place their home. The book also discusses Shahid Saless’s situation in the political economy of New German Cinema and considers how the emergence of a ‘cultural mode of production’ in Germany, which relied heavily on state subsidies and television co-productions, helped him not only to re-establish his career in exile but actually to emerge as an important proponent of what the Germans called the Autorenfilm. Engaging with various sociocultural factors, this part also reflects on the notion of individual struggle to navigate a path through complex social relations and the diverse negotiations of agency within artistic practice. Time of Maturity is reflected upon to explore the notion of ‘in-betweenness’ in the Iranian–German filmmaker’s work, and his aesthetic and stylistic approach that masterfully leads the viewer from one uncomfortable scene to the next. The major theme of ReFocus: The Films of Sohrab Shadid Saless is related to exiled and displaced moving image practitioners: their ethics, aesthetics and modes of production, as well as their precarious lives and often uncertain legacy. Therefore, a parallel is drawn with Belgian film director Chantal Akerman’s work, as well as that of Romuald Karmakar. In particular, selected scenes from Akerman’s Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) and Karmakar’s Nightsongs (Die Nacht singt ihre Lieder, 2004) are analysed to provide a wider context for the ‘cinema of exile’. Considering that Shahid Saless’s body of work consists of a stateless archive of footage held in various locations such as Film Museum München (in Germany) and the Centre for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults (Kanoon) (in Iran), with the copyright being held by various individuals and institutions around the world, it becomes almost imperative to allocate a section of this book to the matter of ‘accessibility’:\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 2\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\nI N T RO D U C T I O N\n\n3\n\nthe way in which researchers and curators can access stateless archival films such as Shahid Saless’s, and how the public can also see these invaluable creative productions. Therefore, in the third part of this book we explore the notion of the ‘stateless’ moving image and the processes and challenges for researchers and museums and galleries involved in working with such materials, all of which is designed to provide a deeper insight into working with the uncertain legacy of creative exiles like Shahid Saless. The text also looks at some developments in distribution channels, such as galleries and digital platforms that were not available to Shahid Saless during his time. Film curators and academics at both private and publicly funded institutes have provided their insight into the persistent problems concerning the archiving and transmission of transnational or ‘stateless’ film – Shahid Saless’s work being a case in point in comparison to his that of his contemporary counterparts. The final three additional sections are dedicated to Shahid Saless’s filmography, including full details of cast and crew, along with production information. We have also provided images from production shoots, screen grabs and more. There follows an interview between journalist Behrang Samsami and Bert Schmidt (Shahid Saless’s cinematographer), to give an even deeper insight into the filmmaker’s work. The final section discusses a film that has been made about Shahid Saless, written and produced by Omid Abdolahi. In ReFocus: The Films of Sohrab Shadid Saless my aim has been to create an opportunity for artists, scholars and the engaged public to reflect on the director’s work and on its implications for creativity in diasporic conditions of urban displacement. I have personally found Shahid Saless’s work a great inspiration in terms of the context we share in common as creative foreigners struggling in a new land to obtain a residency permit and to integrate. His slow-paced, minimalist evocations of the everyday have inspired the work of Chantal Akerman (mentioned above) and the legendary Abbas Kiarostami. Today, moving image artists such as Romuald Karmakar are also claiming a kinship with Shahid Saless, whose films speak forcefully to the traumas of displacement and migration. NOTE 1. G.

However, they do not constitute a unified bloc. Their identities are varied and evolving – from exilic to diasporic, émigré, ethnic, cosmopolitan and beyond – and they work in many countries, using different modes of production and making a variety of types of film in multiple languages. This chapter discusses these issues by placing Sohrab Shahid Saless’s life and films in the context of the Iranian diaspora since the 1960s and the ‘accented cinema’ that they produced.1 If Masud Kimiai’s movies Dash Akol (1971) and Qaisar (1969) consolidated the conventions of the popular Tough Guy movie subgenres of dash mashti and jaheli, respectively, Dariush Mehrjui’s The Cow (Gav, 1969) combined some of the textual features that became characteristic of New Wave art-house movies, particularly those of Sohrab Shahid Saless, the most loyal dramatist of naturalism and realism in Iranian cinema. Reality – faithfulness to the external world – and realism – faithfulness to the conventions of classic realist cinema – were two intertwined features that set the New Wave films apart from the fantasy-driven and narratively chaotic commercial Filmfarsi works (in the Farsi language), such as the Tough Guy movies. These were foundational features of this counter-cinema, which set the reality of ordinary peoples’ lives, treated with empathy and respect, against the fiction of the official culture of spectacle perpetrated by the Pahlavi government and commercial cinema. These features gave the New Wave films their ‘luminous truth’, a phrase used by Giuseppe Ferrara to describe the Italian neorealist films (Liehm 1984, 132). The audiences for the popular Filmfarsi genre movies were ordinary people, while those for the art-house movies were predominantly more educated.\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 7\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\n8\n\nH A M I D NA F I C Y\n\nE A R LY C A R E E R A N D F I L M S I N I R A N B E F O R E E X I L E\n\nSohrab Shahid Saless was born in Qazvin in 1944. He received his film production training in Austria and France, and began making films in Iran in the late 1960s as a contract employee of the Ministry of Culture and Art, earning 9,000 tomans a month. He made twenty-two documentaries and short films for the ministry, several of them about the performing arts and dance, designed for foreign distribution through Iranian embassies and consulates. Among these were Bojnurd Folkdances (Raqs ha-ye Mahhali-ye Bojnurdi, 1970), Torbate Jam Folkdances (Raqs ha-ye Mahhali-ye Torbat-e Jam, 1970) and Turkman Folkdances (Raqs ha-ye Mahhali-ye Turkaman, 1970). He directed his first feature, A Simple Event (Yek Ettefaq-e Sadeh, 1974), under the guise of working on a twenty-minute short. Many key features of his style emerged in this first fiction film, and were reconfigured in the second and last feature that he made inside Iran, Still Life (Tabi’at-e Bijan, 1974). Unlike his contemporary New Wave director Parviz Kimiavi, who had a generally optimistic and expansive view of the world and whose films were playful and open, Shahid Saless was pessimistic and his work adopted a recessive and closed style. The action in these two films is staged with meticulous Chekhovian naturalism, and they are filmed in a signature minimalist and formalist style involving a slow pace, and a static and observational camera prone to long takes, long shots and slow pans. In fact, Shahid Saless might be considered as one of the progenitors of what nowadays is called ‘slow cinema’ in film studies circles. Additionally, Shahid Saless’s films are concerned with the life of ordinary people and their daily routines, rendered with an ironic and objective distance. Space is closed and pre-ordained; time is still or passes slowly. Unlike some New Wave filmmakers, Shahid Saless generally shunned symbolism. With time, his films became darker, yet luminous in their darkness. As the result of his troubled exile, his lengthy, dystopic and dysphoric films, and his difficult personality and style of work, as well as the Eurocentrism predominant in much of film studies world in the 1980s and 1990s, he did not gain the respect and recognition that he deserved, either in Germany where he made all his post-Iran films, as a contributor to the vibrant New German Cinema, or in international circles, as the great auteur director that he was. Likewise, it is not surprising that he would not currently be recognised as one of the fathers of slow cinema. Those who are usually cited as pioneers of this film style include Andrei Tarkovsky, Ingmar Bergman, Michelangelo Antonioni, Aleksander Sokurov, Béla Tarr, Chantal Akerman and Theo Angelopoulos. I would nevertheless add his name to this list of great cinematic slowcoaches! The first two feature films that he made inside Iran not only showcased his luminous style but also garnered widespread praise among Iranian critics\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 8\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\nTHE CINEMA OF SOHRAB SHAHID SALESS\n\n9\n\nand at international film festivals. A Simple Event concerns the daily routines of a student, who lives in Bandar Shah, at the end of the south–north rail line, with his alcoholic fisherman father and his sick mother; the latter soon dies. Still Life deals with the everyday life of a railway guard at some far-off junction in the northern part of the country, who is about to lose his job. The joyless existence and drudgery lived through by these characters stood in high contrast to the era during which the films were made, particularly A Simple Event, which was filmed during the lavish 2,500th anniversary celebration of the Iranian monarchy. The characters are played by non-actors, but the films treat these ordinary people with dignity: a dignity that the state had withdrawn from its citizens. Critics praised A Simple Event and it influenced rising filmmakers, such as Abbas Kiarostami. Critic Jamal Omid called it a ‘sincere, noble, and truthful’ work; Feraidun Moezimoqaddam characterised it as a ‘long poem’; and Jamsheed Akrami, playing on its title, called it ‘a significant event’ (Omid 1995, 659–62). Shahid Saless himself called it ‘the noblest film I ever made in my life’ (Sar Reshtehdari 1998, 45). With this seminal work he made a name for himself nationally by winning the top directorial award at the Second Tehran International Film Festival. Both A Simple Event and Still Life were entered in the Berlin International Film Festival, where they both won awards, the latter the Silver Bear (for best film). Such prizes brought Iranians a sense of pride. Ironically, Iranians (mis) recognised themselves in the dark mirror that Shahid Saless held up to them. That his films had become a source of pride was evident from the critic Feraidun Moezimoqaddam’s review in Sinema 53 magazine: I feel proud and honoured. My international friends all congratulate me, and the Iranian residents and students in Germany (even those with criticism) are delighted and proud . . . I think the highest reward that Shahid Saless received was the compassionate looks of Iranians who had made their way to Berlin from all around Germany and witnessed that he was not returning home with empty hands, thanks to his films. (Omid 1995, 691) In Iran, only Still Life received a public screening, and that just in one Tehran movie house, Capri Cinema. It did unexpectedly well, however. Despite, or perhaps because of, its success, the government did not give the director a production permit for his next film, Quarantine (Qarantineh), causing Shahid Saless to choose voluntary exile in Germany, where he made fifteen lengthy and searing films in twenty-three years. Exile internationalised Iranian filmmakers in a more fundamental way than either their training abroad or their participation in film festivals. Of Shahid Saless’s movies made in exile, the only one shown in Iran before the revolution, to a packed auditorium in the\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 9\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\n10\n\nH A M I D NA F I C Y\n\nIran–Germany Cultural Society, a venue for the Tehran International Film Festival, was his Far From Home (In der Fremde/Dar Ghorbat, 1975), about a Turkish guest-worker in Germany. Like his other exilic films, this one steered clear of Iranian matters – stories, characters, locations – but it did deal with a personal issue: life as an immigrant in an inhospitable foreign land. With this film, the director’s closed-form aesthetics became more prominent and his dark tonality thickened. Far From Home deals with Turkish industrial guest-workers in Germany, who formed a large labour force essential to Germany’s post-World War Two economic recovery but who never received the recognition they deserved. An alienated worker named Hussein (Parviz Sayyad) maintains a crushingly routinized job as a beaten-down but earnest operator of a factory’s monstrously noisy machines. While work gives him an income and a much-desired structure, it is a prison. His austere life outside the factory is laden with fear and loneliness; his attempts to enter German society fail. Even though he shares an overcrowded communal apartment with other guest-workers, he feels isolated. Hussein’s only contact is a younger man named Kalim (Muhammet Temizkan), who claims to have a German girlfriend. He borrows money from Hussein to sustain this relationship – money that he gambles away and never returns. In the end, the girlfriend turns out to have been imaginary, a figure of desire which both men used in an attempt to emplace themselves in the midst of their total displacement. An urgent letter forces Kalim to return to Turkey – a return that is dreaded, foreclosing his dream of freedom and connection to Germany, even though his actual experience there is far removed from that idyllic German dream of an elsewhere (Fernweh). In this dystopic figuration of the exilic return, Far From Home ran counter to the accented films that celebrate actual or imaginary homeward returns. Shahid Saless himself neither harboured the fantasy of a glorious return to his original homeland nor attempted such a return. Though unique in his artistry, Shahid Saless was nevertheless part of the large Iranian diaspora, begun in the 1960s, and the cinematic productions that stemmed from it; this deserves exploration. Since Mehrjui’s The Cow in the early 1970s, Iranian art-house films have been making major headlines in the international press and at film festivals, winning top awards. This trend intensified many-fold with the emergence of the new post-revolution art-house films, which, in addition to receiving a laudatory press and myriad top awards at international film festivals, were given commercial exhibition in movie houses and on TV, college campuses and streaming sites. As early as the start of the 1990s, the Toronto International Film Festival and New York Film Festival began calling Iranian cinema ‘one of the pre-eminent national cinemas’ and one of the ‘most exciting’ cinemas in the world, respectively. Abbas Kiarostami, Amir Naderi, Dariush Mehrjui, Bahram Baizai, the Makhmalbaf\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 10\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\nTHE CINEMA OF SOHRAB SHAHID SALESS\n\n11\n\nfamily, Rakhshan Banietemad, Tahmineh Milani, Bahman Ghobadi, Majid Majidi, Jafar Panahi and Mohammad Rassoulof have all become practically household names among the cinephiles of the world. What has not received sufficient attention is the significant work that Iranians have been producing outside Iran, in their wide diaspora. A survey of some sixty-one countries in 2009 by the International Monetary Fund concluded that Iran has the highest rate of ‘brain drain’ in the world and that ‘every year more than 150,000 educated Iranians leave their home country in the hope of finding a better life abroad’. This number, which has now reached around 180,000, is a massive and alarming development, with far-reaching consequences for the future of Iran, Iranians in diaspora and the receiving nations. What is remarkable is that, simultaneously, post-revolution Iran also topped the list of the world’s largest refugee havens, with the number of displaced Iraqis reaching 700,000 after the Halabja chemical bombings in 1988, and the displaced Afghan population reaching three million at its peak in 1991 (Hakimzadeh 2006, 8–9). Both of these movements of displaced populations – emigration and immigration – have had profound repercussions for Iranian cinema and Iranian filmmakers, particularly in broadening and deepening their horizons, and diversifying and globalizing their output. Most Iranians emigrated to Europe and North America, with those in the USA forming the largest population outside Iran. Although highly concentrated in Southern California, the group is dispersed widely across the country, with heavy concentrations in New York, Texas, Virginia, Maryland, Florida and Illinois. This population is also widely heterogeneous in terms of social and class affiliation, profession, politics, ethnicity, religion, gender and generation. As a result, it is misleading to speak of an Iranian community outside Iran as if it were singular and homogeneous. The same is true of the Iranian mediamakers. I conducted three research projects on these mediamakers, each leading to a book. One dealt with Iranian popular culture and television programmes in Los Angeles, a second with displaced Middle Eastern and North African filmmakers, including Iranians, and a third with displaced Iranian filmmakers only; these provide a context for Shahid Saless’s works. I R A N I A N P O P C U LT U R E A N D T E L E V I S I O N I N LOS ANGELES\n\nThe first study, undertaken in the 1980s and the early 1990s, established the vitality and extensive cross-fertilisation of Iranian exilic popular culture and television, produced in Los Angeles and disseminated throughout the diaspora.\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 11\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\n12\n\nH A M I D NA F I C Y\n\nIt showed that, in their first decade of emigration, from 1980 to 1991, Iranians in the USA produced and transmitted sixty-two regularly scheduled television programmes, totalling over seventeen hours of programming per week. For their TV broadcasts, they used the new ‘lease access’ provision of the cable television law that required cable companies to air community-produced shows. In addition, Iranians produced twenty-seven feature films, primarily in the USA, many of them by veteran, Pahlavi-era filmmakers. Finally, Iranians in Los Angeles – the capital of Iranian pop culture, also called ‘Persian Motown’ in those days – produced eighteen regularly scheduled radio programmes in this period, eigthy-six Persian-language printed periodicals, and numerous music albums and music videos, and formed numerous cultural and political associations, university student societies and nightclubs (Naficy 2002, 249–67). Iranian ethno-religious minorities proportionately outnumbered their Muslim compatriots among television producers in California: of 46 producers, 28 were Muslim, 12 Christian (6 Armenians, 5 Assyrians, 1 Protestant), 2 Jewish and 4 Baha’is (Naficy 1993, 82). Interethnicity – the presence of subgroups within an immigrant group – also figured large in the Los Angeles pop music industry, resulting in fascinating cross-fertilisation. For example, in the 1980s, Jewish businesspeople were generally the producers and distributors of the music that Muslim singers sang and Armenian musicians performed. In addition, Jews were apparently the most active music-buying, concert-going and party-giving group among Iranians, perhaps partly due to their financial success as a result of their very high self-employment rate in Los Angeles. Over the years, Iranian exilic television underwent a radical transformation. While the early exilic TV productions consisted of single shows, produced by an individual producer and aired in the 1980s and 1990s by broadcasters, cablecasters or public access outlets for Iranian exiles primarily in Los Angeles, the twenty-four-hour satellite channels that emerged from the 2000s on were diasporic, in that they addressed not only Iranian exiles in Los Angeles, but also those elsewhere in the diaspora and inside Iran. These channels thus became important players in the new, mutually antagonistic public diplomacy – soft power relations – particularly between the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iranians in the diaspora, and the United States. The satellite era began with National Iranian TV, operated by former pop singer Zia Atabay, and quickly grew to include over two dozen Persian-language channels as other governments and entities entered this controversial but lucrative intersectional media public diplomacy. I R A N I A N - AC C E N T E D C I N E M A I N D I A S P O R A\n\nMy second study, conducted in the late 1990s, argued that a new global cinema had emerged, created by the displaced filmmakers of the world since the 1960s. I called this an ‘accented cinema’ because – in its non-linear, fragmented style,\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 12\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\nTHE CINEMA OF SOHRAB SHAHID SALESS\n\n13\n\nits multilingualism, its concern with themes of home and elsewhere, and its marginal and displaced characters – it offered an alternative to mainstream cinemas, which were presumably without accent. My study showed that Middle Eastern and North African filmmakers in their diaspora formed a surprisingly large and diverse group of accented directors, numbering 321 from 16 sending countries, who made a minimum of 920 films in 27 receiving countries, mostly in Europe and North America (Naficy 2001, 18). The study showed that, in the 1990s and early 2000s, the output of Iranians topped the list of Middle Eastern and North African diasporic filmmakers: Iranians produced 307 films, followed by Armenians (235), Algerians (107), Lebanese (46), Palestinians (35), Turks (25), Moroccans (25), Tunisians (23) and Israeli/Jewish (24). My third, extensive study, of Iranian filmmakers working abroad only, conducted for my four-volume book, A Social History of Iranian Cinema, not only revised their total output considerably upward from the previous two studies but also provided a fascinating socio-cultural and cinematic profile of that output. The geographical locations in which Iranians made films give us a good idea of the dispersal and concentration of the diaspora communities, and the number of films they created indicates the relative size and cultural capital of the Iranian population in each location. Iranians made films in twenty-one countries, with the United States ranking first (505 films), followed by France (138), Canada (107), Germany (90), Sweden (77), Austria (68), Great Britain (67), the Netherlands (42), Australia (19), Norway (18), New Zealand (11) and Denmark (10). The dominance of those in the USA is not surprising, for America houses both the largest population of Iranians outside Iran – as well as numbers of Iranian entertainers and mediamakers – and the most powerful film industry in the world (Naficy 2012, 376). There are some exceptions, however, as Iranians in France made more films than those in Sweden and Germany, even though at the time both of the latter had a larger Iranian population; and while Iranians in France, which has a smaller population of Iranians, produced a larger number of films than other European countries, those in Israel, which has a higher ratio of Iranians, apparently did not produce any. The disproportionate number of films to population in certain countries is partly due to the over-productivity of a few individuals in those places: for example, Ghazel Radpay in France, Sohrab Shahid Saless in Germany and Houchang Allahyari in Austria. Such areas need more work and more accurate data. I R A N I A N I M M I G R AT I O N WAV E S A N D T H E I R FILMIC OUTPUT\n\nThe influx of Iranians into the USA occurred in three broad waves: from 1950 to 1977, from 1979 to 1986, and from 1987 to 2012. The first was motivated by the rapid, top-down Westernisation spearheaded by the Shah, the second\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 13\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\n14\n\nH A M I D NA F I C Y\n\nby the bottom-up popular social revolution, eventually led by Ayatollah Khomeini, and the third by economic misery, the eight-year war with Iraq, and political repression; this produced three different types of population. While the first wave was comprised chiefly of permanent economic immigrants or of temporary immigrants, such as a large number of students, much of the second wave was made up of political refugees and exiles with high class-capital (Bozorgmehr 1997, 443–4). The third wave consisted of highly qualified professionals, on one hand, and of working-class economic refugees, on the other, who emigrated after the ceasefire with Iraq in search of better opportunities; these are the émigrés (Hakimzadeh 2006, 3). Even though a small sojourner population, the first immigrant and student wave produced many films – 78 in North America and Europe. The second, larger wave of exiles and refugees was even more productive, with 135 films. In the ensuing years, between 1987 and 2012, as exile evolved for many into diaspora, ethnicity and permanent immigration and these people were joined by a new third wave of working-class émigrés; their output grew steadily, reaching an all-time high of 896 films (Naficy 2012, 381). Just as the Iranian populations in the diaspora are not homogeneous, the films that they make are also not homogeneous. They could be discussed in various ways, under aesthetic, stylistic and formal rubrics or under the types of film made. Here I will discuss them based on the social placement of their authors. As such, this is primarily an authorship approach to the diaspora cinema to the films of Shahid Saless. M O DA L I T I E S O F I R A N I A N - A C C E N T E D F I L M S\n\nThe films that Iranians made abroad are part of the new global cinema of displacement – accented cinema – created by differently situated displaced filmmakers who, despite their many fundamental differences, share certain features in their films, which constitute the latter’s accent (Naficy 2001). If the dominant cinema in each country were considered universal and without accent, the films that displaced subjects make there would be accented. Likewise, if the dominant world cinema, that of Hollywood, were considered universal and without accent, the films that displaced global filmmakers make would be accented. However, this accent emanates not so much from the accented speech of the diegetic characters as from the displacement of the filmmakers themselves, in their alternative artisanal production mode, and in the style, aesthetics, narratives and politics of their films. I divide Iranian filmmakers working abroad into at least five recognisable but overlapping types: exilic, diasporic, émigré, ethnic and cosmopolitan. This classification is based on the filmmakers’ different types of displacement and\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 14\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\nTHE CINEMA OF SOHRAB SHAHID SALESS\n\n15\n\nsubsequent placement within the immigration waves to which they belong, and the manner in which displacement shapes their films. Iranian filmmakers, like many other Middle Eastern filmmakers, moved through several countries and across several identities. Some claimed multiple identities – both simultaneous and sequential – while others denied any form of particularistic identity. Some never returned home, while others periodically visited their homelands, where they made films. Some moved among too many worlds, often leaving behind inadequately documented histories. A few deliberately obfuscated their history in order to conceal their tracks. Such fluidity and camouflaging, characteristic of displaced positionality, makes it difficult to pin down with certainty some filmmakers’ country of origin or residence, let alone their other markers of identity, such as ethno-religious affiliations. As a result, it is important to note that some filmmakers fall into more than one category. What is more, many started in one category of identity but evolved and made films in other categories, in tandem with their own personal and professional journeys and evolution of identities. In addition, not all Iranians abroad made accented films. Some worked in the dominant film and television industries and engaged in popular cinematic practices, making mainstream movies. I briefly discuss prominent filmmakers in each category, including Shahid Saless as a transnational cosmopolitan accented filmmaker. EXILED FILMMAKERS\n\nThe term ‘exile’ refers principally to external exiles: Iranians who voluntarily or involuntarily left their country but who maintained both an ambivalent and a highly cathected relationship with their original and adopted homes. Although these exiles did not return to Iran – and many could not, they maintained an intense desire to do so, a desire that was projected in potent return narratives in their work. The exiled filmmakers, like exiled writers, who were generally older, suffered from the discrepancy between their higher-status identity prior to exile and their generally lower-status identity in foreign lands. In addition, being deprived of their original language, culture and audience robbed them of their natural bedrock and tools of expression (Naficy 1993, 1–31). If, at home, they were regarded as stricken by the West (gharbzadeh), in exile they became deeply stricken by home (ghorbatzadeh). Finally, filmmakers who were forcibly driven away tended to define, at least during the initial period of their exile, all things in their lives not only in relationship to the homeland but also in strictly political terms. Their connection was one of inheritance and descent. Among such exiled filmmakers are Parviz Sayyad in the USA, with his feature fiction movies, Checkpoint (Sarhad, 1987) and Mission (Ma’muriat, 1983), and Reza Allamehzadeh in the Netherlands, with his feature fiction The Guests\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 15\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\n16\n\nH A M I D NA F I C Y\n\nof Hotel Astoria (Mehmanan-e Hotel-e Astoria, 1989) and documentaries critical of the Islamic Republic’s conduct, including Iranian Taboo (2011), which details the persecution of the Baha’is in Iran. There is, of course, another modality of internal exile. If this modality were to be defined as ‘[i]solation, alienation, deprivation of means of production and communication, [and] exclusion from public life’ (Row and Whitfield 1987, 233), then many Iranian intellectuals, artists and filmmakers, particularly arthouse cinema directors, could be considered to be working in internal exile within their own country. Jafar Panahi, Mohammad Rassoulof and Mojtaba Mirtahmasb, working in Iran, are among these internal exiles, who, despite various impediments, including official and unofficial bans, engage in a kind of guerrilla-style filmmaking. DIASPORIC FILMMAKERS\n\nDiaspora, like exile, often begins with trauma, rupture and coercion, and involves the scattering of populations to places outside the original homeland. Sometimes, however, the scattering is caused by a desire for increased trade, work and financial, artistic, professional and other opportunities. Like the Iranians in exile, those in diaspora have a prior identity in Iran, and their diasporic identity is constructed in resonance with that earlier descent identity. However, unlike exile, which may be individualistic or collective, diaspora is necessarily collective, in both its origination and its destination. As a result, the nurturing of a collective memory, often of an idealised homeland, is constitutive of the diasporic identity. In addition, the exiles’ identity involves a near-exclusive, vertical descent relationship with the Iranian homeland; the diasporic consciousness is multisited, involving horizontal relationships with Iranians at home and with Iranian compatriot communities elsewhere across the globe. As a result, plurality, multiplicity and hybridity are structured in dominance among the diaspora filmmakers, while among the political exiles binarism and duality reign. Among the Iranian diasporic filmmakers is Babak Shokrian, who made feature films dealing with Jewish subjects, the Jewish diaspora and Jewish Iranians: Peaceful Sabbath (1993), America So Beautiful (2001) and Shah Bob (2015). Because of their subject matter and Shokrian’s Iranian–Jewish background, these could also be classified as ethnic films. Persheng Sadegh-Vaziri, a Kurdish–Iranian American, made many documentaries about Iranian national and ethnic belonging: Journal from Tehran (1986), Far from Iran (1991), A Place Called Home (1998) and Women Like Us (2000–2). Some of these focused more on Kurdish ethnic identity, including her own, some on Iranian diasporic identity, and others on gender identity. Shokrian and Sadegh-Vaziri live and\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 16\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\nTHE CINEMA OF SOHRAB SHAHID SALESS\n\n17\n\nwork in the USA. Working primarily out of Great Britain and the USA, Tina Gharavi made experimental documentaries about gender and sexual identity, some involving herself, such as Mother/Country (2002), as well as others, such as I Am Nasrin (2013), that focus on Iranian teenage refugees in north-east London. These diasporic filmmakers are also émigré filmmakers, in whose works their own personal, sexual, ethnic and national identities are explored. ÉMIGRÉ FILMMAKERS\n\nThe émigré filmmakers are defined as those who, like exilic and diasporic subjects, left Iran and immigrated to other countries, where, after a period of resistance and adaptation, they consented to becoming permanent residents and citizens while maintaining a variety of attachments to their original home country. Though present in some form, the trauma of displacement, the cathected direct relationship to a lost homeland, and the burning desire for a grand homecoming are not constitutive of immigrants’ lives, as the forces of consent relations with the adopted country attenuate those that favour descent relations with the homeland. Émigré European filmmakers were the engines of the American studio system in the 1920s to 1950s. The first heads of the five major US studios in the 1920s were all Jewish émigrés from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, while many major studio directors of the 1930s and 1940s were émigré filmmakers escaping the Nazis. In subsequent decades, other émigré filmmakers from other lands joined in, consolidating the classical realist film style and enriching the American cinema – indeed, world cinema – and culture. The doyen of Iranian émigré filmmakers was veteran television director Reza Badiyi, born in 1930 in Arak, Iran, and trained by the United States Information Agency unit in Iran to make documentaries about development issues. After moving to the USA in 1955 and earning a degree from Syracuse University, he made a prodigious number of mainstream US television series and films in the period between the 1960s and the 2010s. Among these were the following popular TV series: Get Smart (1965), Mission Impossible (1969), Mannix (1972), The Six Million Dollar Man (1974), Barretta (1978), Hawaii Five-O (1979), Knots Landing (1979), Fame (1982), T. J. Hooker (1986), Falcon Crest (1990), In the Heat of the Night (1994), Star Trek (1994–6), Cagney & Lacey (1995), Baywatch (1997), Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997), La Femme Nikita (1997) and Mortal Combat (1999). He was so prolific that he was called the ‘Godfather of American television’, logging in ‘more hours as a director than anyone in history’: about 423 in all (Naficy 2012, 396). He died in 2011.\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 17\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\n18\n\nH A M I D NA F I C Y\n\nAnother type of émigré filmmaker turned to the art world to create installations and art-house films. Working out of New York, Shirin Neshat made several dual-projection films for museums and galleries, becoming a renowned international artist. In 2009, she moved into feature filmmaking with her powerful adaption of Shahrnoush Parsipour’s story, Women Without Men. All her video works and her first feature deal with Iran or Iranian subjects. However, her latest film, Looking for Um Kulthum (2017), extends her reach, dealing with the life and time of the great Egyptian singing star. ETHNIC FILMMAKERS\n\nEthnic filmmakers are born to exilic diasporic, and émigré populations in the adopted countries, whose own relationship to their ancestral homeland is often indirect, second-hand, abstract, and sometimes mediated solely through memory, fantasy and mediawork. Iranian émigrés and ethnics in the USA, like other similar groups before them, are hyphenated, bicultural and multicultural subjects, who assiduously play the politics of the hyphen to construct new identities out of their descent relations with their parental homes and consent relations with their own current homes. The adoption of the hyphen by Iranians in the USA and by accented filmmakers and writers has both positive and negative implications. It could be viewed positively as an indicator of becoming fully American, like other multicultural citizens, or, alternatively, it could be seen as a resistance to the homogenising power of American melting-pot ideology. In this case, both assimilation and resistance would be regarded positively. On the other hand, the hyphen could imply a lack, or an idea that hyphenated Iranians are somehow subordinate to unhyphenated people and that they would never be totally accepted or trusted as full citizens. Many Iranians in the USA at first resisted the hyphen on a class basis, as it implied admitting that they were not fully American and white, like many other lower-class, poor and disenfranchised people of colour in America. They also resisted it because retaining the hyphen could suggest a divided allegiance, even disloyalty, which was particularly dangerous during the periodic waves of anti-Iranian and anti-Muslim sentiments in the USA. Interpretation of the politics of the hyphen is quite complex. In a nativist and chauvinist reading, generally favoured by exilic and diasporic populations, the hyphen provides a vertical link to an authentic essence that lies outside ideology and pre-dates, or stands apart from, the new adopted nation. The hyphen is a link that emphasises descent relations to Iran and to roots, depth, inheritance, continuity, homogeneity and stability. The filmmakers’ task in this modality, in Stuart Hall’s word, is only ‘to discover, excavate, bring to light\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 18\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\nTHE CINEMA OF SOHRAB SHAHID SALESS\n\n19\n\nand express through cinematic representation’ that inherited collective cultural identity, that ‘one true self ’ (Hall 1994, 393). However, in its contestatory adoption, primarily by émigrés and ethnics, the hyphen can operate both vertically and horizontally, playing descent relations against consent relations. In this modality, filmmakers do not strive to recover an existing, authentic past or to impose an imaginary and often fetishised coherence on their fragmented experiences and histories. Instead, by emphasising discontinuity, heterogeneity and specificity, they demonstrate that they are in the process of becoming, that they are ‘subject to the continuous “play” of history, culture and power’ (394). Read as a sign of hybridised, multiple or constructed identity, the hyphen can become liberating because it can be performed and signified upon. In reality, each hyphen is a nested hyphen, consisting of several intersecting and overlapping hyphens that provide inter- and intra-ethnic, racial, religious, temporal and national linkages. This intersectionality works against essentialism, nationalism and binarism, characteristic both of modernity and of exile. In the past four decades in which Iranians have settled in large numbers in the USA, they have played a fascinating and evolving game of identity, sometimes with, and sometimes without, the hyphen. During the hostage crisis, and its virulent backlash against Iranian residents in the USA in the 1980s, some denied being Iranian, identifying themselves, instead, as ‘Latino’, ‘Mexican’ or ‘Greek’. In due course, with Iranian success in business, science, the arts and academic fields, some openly adopted the hyphenated ‘Iranian–American’ moniker, joining the roster of other successful hyphenated ethnic Americans. Others, harking back to the roots of ancient Iran to modulate, soften or avoid entirely any negative associations with the current Islamic Iran, adopted ‘Persian’ or ‘Persian– American’ as their preferred identity. This identity invoked an ancient, almost mythical and tolerant empire that pre-dates both the religion of Islam and the current intolerant Islamic Republic’s regime, an identity that has been romanticised in Hollywood movies and popular literature. The latest and most public use of this latter Persian strategy is in Bravo TV’s reality series Shahs of Sunset. Begun in 2012, the series was very successful, going into its seventh season in August 2018. Relevant to the topic under discussion here, Bravo TV’s website described the participants as six ‘Persian– American’ friends in Los Angeles, ‘who try to juggle their active social lives and careers while also balancing the demands of their families and traditions’. In the series, the players proudly declare themselves to be ‘Persian’ and engage in all the usual youthful American lifestyles and past times featured in other reality shows – living, loving, dating (both homo- and heterosexual partners), partying, fighting, marrying and working. Among ethnic filmmakers is Caveh Zahedi, born in Washington, D.C., in 1960, who made fascinating and challenging autobiographical and avant-garde documentary features such as A Little Stiff (1991), I Don’t Hate Las Vegas\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 19\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\n20\n\nH A M I D NA F I C Y\n\nAnymore (1994), I Was Possessed by God (2000), In the Bathtub of the World (2001), I Am a Sex Addict (2005) and The Sheik and I (2012). In all of these, the director is also the principal subject and actor, his own biography, persona, family relations and politics of the hyphen shaping the films’ humorous, contentious, entertaining and experimental narratives. T R A N S N AT I O N A L C O S M O P O L I TA N F I L M M A K E R S\n\nTransnational cosmopolitan filmmakers are mobile both in their places of residence and in the places in which, and about which, they make their films, regardless of their own places of birth and residence; their films are about a variety of topics, often multicultural, transnational and intersectional. Cosmopolitan filmmakers resist any attachment to place, nation and roots; instead, they emphasise routes, individualised identities and auteurist authority. They reject the politics of the ethnic hyphen and generally do not make films about Iran or Iranians. If they do, they do not tell their own personal stories. Abbas Kiarostami was one exemplar of the cosmopolitan filmmaker, who continued to live inside Iran but who made most of his later films outside the country – in Africa, France and Japan, among other places. Funded by transnational sources, these works involved non-Iranian stories and actors, were filmed in foreign locations and in foreign languages, and were screened not in Iran primarily but at international film festivals, where they received acclaim, and were distributed on international art-house and academic circuits. Amir Naderi is another cosmopolitan filmmaker living primarily in the USA. His US-made features, Manhattan by Numbers (1993), Avenue A, B, C . . . Manhattan (1997), Marathon (2002) and Sound Barrier (2005), are all about homelessness and [un]belonging of one sort or another, and are mostly centred on Manhattan, where he lived. He has also made films in Japan – Cut (2011) – and Italy – Mountain (2016). In all of these, his characters are on the move, on the run, in perpetual motion and on a search of one kind or another. These active, mobile characters pursue their goals obsessively, in the way that Captain Ahab chases the white whale Moby Dick: forcefully, indefatigably and relentlessly, signalling larger epistemological, psychological and philosophical issues. None of these films deals with Iran or Iranians. Like Shahid Saless, Naderi does not want to be considered as a member of a group – a filmmaker in exile, an Iranian filmmaker or even an Iranian–American filmmaker; instead, as he told me forcefully in an interview, he prefers recognition as a universal film auteur. I want to make a complete break, destroy all the bridges. I want to have nothing to do with Iran, my family, Iranian cinema, or being an Iranian exile filmmaker. I want to be a great filmmaker, period. [pause]\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 20\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\nTHE CINEMA OF SOHRAB SHAHID SALESS\n\n21\n\nI have undergone a blood transfusion [no longer carrying Iranian blood]. I don’t care about family, country, language, and the great poets like Ferdowsi, Hafez, or Sa’di. I have broken away from all that. I am here and now, and I want to make my mark on history not as an Iranian or an Iranian–American filmmaker but as a filmmaker, pure and simple. (Naficy 2012, 508) S O H R A B S H A H I D S A L E S S , A C O S M O P O L I TA N FILMMAKER IN EXILE\n\nShahid Saless can best be described as a cosmopolitan subject and filmmaker, even though there are strong strands of exilism in his life and works. After the two fiction films he made inside Iran before the revolution, he made fifteen intense and lengthy features in Germany about alienation and anomie, such as Utopia (1982), which one critic called ‘dark as tar’. With each film, this darkness intensified, but this was no ordinary darkness; it was intense, luminous and illuminating. As part of his politics of identity and hyphen, none of his films deals with Iran or with Iranian subjects, hyphenated or not. Instead, they focus on homelessness, homeseeking, and the burning desire for an elsewhere and for another time, not for a previous home or for a return to an originary home. Like Naderi, Shahid Saless disavowed any particularistic subnational, ethnic, national or hyphenated affiliation or identity – particularly Iranian – in the interest of being recognised as a stateless, universal and transcendent auteur director. However, under such emphatic disavowals lurk complex crosscurrents of identity politics and psychology. After the national and international successes of his New Wave films, A Simple Event and Still Life, Shahid Saless left Iran in 1974 semi-clandestinely, for what became a permanent exile. The reason for the stealth was that he did not have the exit permit then required of all passengers, so pretended to be an important director on his way to Germany for a major film co-production deal (Sar Reshtehdari 1998, 56–7). The primary impetus for his departure was the stifling conditions governing society and the film industry under the Shah, which had put a stop to his production of Quarantine, a film he never completed. Because he left voluntarily, as he told me, he did not consider himself an exile, and he did not pine for return, another characteristic of those in exile. Instead, following the German–Jewish film scholar Lotte H. Eisner, about whom he made the affectionate documentary The Long Vacation of Lotte H. Eisner (1979), he preferred to speak of his lengthy sojourn abroad as a kind of ‘long vacation’. It is this conceptualisation that allowed him to express neither remorse nor nostalgia, which are constitutive of exilic structures of feeling. In\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 21\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\n22\n\nH A M I D NA F I C Y\n\na series of lengthy interviews with me in Los Angeles, conducted over a threeday period a year before his untimely death, he shared his candid thoughts about his life and films: I do not belong to the Iranian diaspora cinema. I left the country in 1974 because of certain difficulties that had been placed in my filmmaking path and because I was very interested in filmmaking, like any young person. I left the country voluntarily and worked for twentythree years in Germany without returning home, despite encouragement by the regimes of both the Shah and Khomeini to do so. I must admit with extreme sadness that I have no nostalgic longing for Iran. When each morning I set foot outside my house, whether it was in Germany, France, Venice, or the Soviet Union – the places where I have lived and made films – I would feel at home, because I had no difficulties. I am essentially not a patriot . . . I think one’s homeland is not one’s place of birth, but the country that gives one a place to stay, to work, and to make a living . . . Germany was my home for a long time. (Naficy 2012, 501) Despite this exilic denial, Shahid Saless’s darkly luminous, dystopic and dysphoric films point to a deep undercurrent of exilism and criticism of the societies in which he lived. He was at home neither in Iran nor in Germany; he was alienated from both. Most of his over a dozen difficult films for cinema and television, some of them three hours long, examine the psychology of social displacements, disillusionments, anomie and alienation in German society. The inhabitants – including immigrants – seem to be suffering from some sort of internal exile, a claustrophobic, contentious, ennui-ridden existence. In displacement, the author and the work map on to one another more tightly. Home is transformed from a physical place to one’s art, one’s films, to cinema. Like many accented filmmakers, Shahid Saless makes films that resonate autobiographically, their despondency reflecting his own exilic-feeling structures. If there is nostalgia in them, it is not for a lost homeland but for a lost mother, while father figures are rare. These figurations have deep personal sources: Shahid Saless lost his mother when she abandoned the family before he was two years old, and he was not particularly close to his father. As he told me: ‘I saw my mother only once, in Austria, when I was eighteen years old, and we ended up having a fight’ (Naficy 2012, 501). Shahid Saless had a daughter with a German woman to whom he was not married, a daughter whom he did not see after she reached her fifth month. These fractured relations and profound loneliness haunt his movies. His most autobiographical film in Iran is his first feature, Still Life, while his most autobiographical exilic film is his last feature, Roses for Africa (1992). Of the latter, he said:\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 22\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\nTHE CINEMA OF SOHRAB SHAHID SALESS\n\n23\n\n[It] is all about myself, even though it is an adaptation of a novel. I have changed the story a lot and, at any rate, Paul’s attitude and behaviour is exactly like mine. Whatever he does, I do. I wanted to see myself on the screen as I am. (Naficy 2012, 502) What is this most autobiographical film about? It is not about escaping the trap of here and now by returning to an earlier home, as those in exile would want to do; rather, it is about the unfulfilled wish of people pinned in their own stifling societies to escape the trap of here and now for an idealised elsewhere, named ‘Africa’. As such, the film is about the protagonist’s home-founding journey – one that fails terribly due to suicide, like Shahid Saless’s own tragic journey, or long vacation, which ended in a bloody death in Evanston, Illinois. Despite their manifest differences, all of his films ruminate on the common dilemma of pervasive homelessness. Collectively, they constitute one of the most sustained and searing critiques by an émigré filmmaker of his adopted homeland, Germany. In Far From Home, he offers an undesired return home; in Utopia, a form of internal exile; in Order (Ordung, 1980), amnesia; and in Roses for Africa, suicide in a phone booth, while the image of the plane taking off for Africa is reflected in the protagonist’s irises, poignantly signalling his failure to achieve his life’s wish to go to a desired elsewhere. Despite his hard work and accomplishments, Shahid Saless remained an outsider to the New German Cinema. Chief among the reasons for this was his uncompromising attitude. He removed his name from Hans – A Young Man in Germany (Hans – Ein Junge in Deutschland, 1985) because the producers demanded that he shorten his three-and-a-half-hour film. He refused, causing the film to be broadcast without his name, until four years later, when he finally shortened it to his liking and allowed his name to be used. There was also his difficult personality and demanding work habits, which, since Utopia, required the intermediary of a lawyer, as well as his minimalist filming style, critical dystopia, and bitter and dark-feeling structures, which made watching his films a challenging experience for ordinary spectators. Although there are numerous reviews of his films in various languages, Eurocentric film scholars in Europe and North America paid little attention to him, treating him as more of a guest than a contender (his films are difficult to find, as well). Given the dystopic trajectory of his films, it is no surprise that, in a short and sardonic piece, he would call cinema a ‘whore’s milieu’, one that does not do ‘much for one’s potency’ (Shahid Saless 1988, 56). The designation of filmmakers as impotent whores working in capitalist societies to which they do not fully belong and from which they cannot truly escape (like the prostitutes in Utopia) is a pessimistic but realistic assessment of accented filmmakers’ interstitial conditions. This metaphor became a reality for Shahid Saless in the mid-1990s. Up to then, state-subsidised funding in West Germany had helped to shield\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 23\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\n24\n\nH A M I D NA F I C Y\n\nalternative filmmakers (including accented filmmakers) from the vagaries of the market. Like the New Wave filmmakers under the Pahlavi regime and early art-house directors under the Islamic Republic, economic dependence on the state meant that these West German filmmakers did not gain a mass following because ‘government subsidy ensured that they never needed to gain one’ (Kaes 1989, 21). However, after Germany’s unification and the triumph of capitalism, involving media privatisation, which profoundly transformed both the country and its film industry, Shahid Saless could no longer continue to make his type of slow, dark and lengthy art-house films. The transformation worsened the whorish competitiveness he had critiqued. Unwilling to compromise, he was now not only an outsider but also a true stranger in a strange land, because of which he became more despondent and darker in outlook. Interstitial authorship by diasporic, exilic, émigré, ethnic and cosmopolitan filmmakers takes a high toll: After Roses for Africa, for six years I could not make a single film. I had three great screenplays, which people in the know thought could be made into successful films. Unfortunately, one by one they were rejected by the producers who wanted films with happy endings – the type of films I’d never made before. When all three screenplays were rejected, I began drinking all alone from the crack of dawn until five in the afternoon. At five o’clock I would fix myself a meal, eat it, and then make numerous phone calls to friends in different parts of the world. All of them would admonish me for drinking. After hanging up the phone, I would fall into a state of stupor until the next morning. I did this for three years. Without any films to make, I was totally undermined and vanquished; while when I was making films, nothing in the world mattered to me. (Naficy 2012, 503) His refusal to play along meant that there was no place for him in Germany, even in its interstices. Roses for Africa seems to have acted as a prophetic, protoexilic film, foreshadowing Shahid Saless’s second exile and death. Unlike Paul, his alter ego in the film, who, unhappy with life in Germany and unable to go to his idealised African elsewhere, commits suicide with a gun in a telephone booth, Shahid Saless succeeded in leaving for another elsewhere: the USA, where he settled in 1995 in the hope of making his first US feature. If, for two decades, he had felt at home – albeit marginalised – in Germany, he was downright uncomfortable in the USA, largely because of its history of interventionist foreign policy in Iran and elsewhere: ‘I do not feel at home here for I have an open account with America that cannot be closed,’ he said (Naficy 2012, 503). As in Utopia, the place of comfort was inside, in a nondescript apartment complex in the San Fernando Valley suburbs of Los Angeles, where he lived\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 24\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\nTHE CINEMA OF SOHRAB SHAHID SALESS\n\n25\n\nwith his stepmother, Farrokh Kamravani Shahid Saless (where our interviews took place). Alas, he was unable to finance any film projects in Los Angeles, forcing him to move to a Chicago suburb, where he had to battle with a series of long-standing illnesses, including tuberculosis, cancer, pneumonia, alcoholism and an ulcer, to which he finally succumbed at the age of fifty-four; it was a sad, lonely and bloody death in a small apartment in Evanston, like Paul’s in the telephone booth in his final film, Roses for Africa. Chicago-based filmmaker Mehrnaz Saeed-Vafa, perhaps the last person to interview him on camera for a film, described his last days to me. Shahid Saless had promised his friends to go cold turkey and stop drinking alcohol. After several days of not hearing from him, a friend, Mohammad Pakshir, decided to check up on him. When he knocked on the door to the director’s apartment but received no response, he called the police, who, upon breaking the door down, discovered a grisly scene: Shahid Saless lying supine on the floor behind the door, dead, naked and covered in his own blood. He had had another bout of severe bleeding, years earlier in Philadelphia, when his stepmother and brother had been around to help rescue him. Not this time. The doctors estimated that he had died within the previous 48 hours, declaring 1 July 1998 as his date of death; however, Saeed-Vafa thinks he may have died on his birthday (28 June), a bitter irony that would fit his films. The path from the bathroom to the door and the back of the door were bloodied, indicating that he had struggled to crawl to the door and to open it. His telephone, his lifeline to the outside world, had been cut off ten days earlier because of his failure to pay his bills, a perennial problem. His brother had his body cremated without an autopsy and had the ashes posted to him, so that he could divide them up with his stepmother. That way each would have something ‘to spread on water’. No memorials were held (Naficy 2012, 504). Shahid Saless’s profound homelessness in exile – despite his denial – come through in his elegiacally dystopic films, in the snippets of my interviews with him quoted here, in the way he lived and died, and in the final short film (fifteen minutes long) that Saeed-Vafa made about him, Sohrab Shahid Saless Far From Home (1998). What, more than anything else, turned him into an exilic figure, causing his departures from his previous homelands, was not national belonging, but rather obstacles in his filmmaking path. Cinema was his true home, not Iran, his country of birth, nor Germany, where he made all of his post-Iran films, nor the USA, where he failed to make any films at all. As he said to me, as we returned to his apartment from a visit to the local liquor store with a bottle of whisky: From the time that I went after film and became a filmmaker until today, I have not felt for a moment that I am Iranian. But that which gave me everything and was my home, my wife, my father, my mother, my\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 25\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\n26\n\nH A M I D NA F I C Y\n\nchildren, my life was filmmaking. If one day they tack a red ribbon on my lapel, that says ‘Filmmaking Forbidden,’ I won’t commit suicide because I hate people who do so, but I think I will die within two years’ time. (Naficy 2012, 504) Although he was not forbidden to make films in the USA, he was unable to raise funds for them there, which was tantamount to receiving a ‘filmmaking forbidden’ ribbon on his lapel. In truth, it was more than that. It was tantamount to a death sentence. And that is where he died. While such an obsessive passion for cinema is peculiar to only a few exilic filmmakers, such as Sohrab Shahid Saless, Amir Naderi and Luis Buñuel, the empowering function of filmmaking, which helps exiles cope with deterritorialisation by creating new narrative homes, motivates all accented filmmakers.

Eisner and Anton Chekhov (the latter being made in the Soviet Union). It was his eighth feature film in total, taking into account his first two award-winning Iranian films, A Simple Event (1974) and Still Life (1974), both of which established his reputation in West Germany and further afield. By the time Utopia was released, Shahid Saless had been living and working in West Germany for nearly decade, after leaving his home country of Iran in the mid-1970s, when he was prevented from working on what would have been his third feature film, Quarantine (Naficy 2001, 200–3). During that time he continued to practise and hone the techniques that would become characteristic of his filmmaking style. With specific reference to Utopia, Hamid Naficy has described these techniques as consisting of ‘a slow pace, slow acting style, and slow line delivery; a rather static and observational camera that is prone to long takes, long shots and slow pans; and a concern for the life of ordinary people and the routine practices of their everyday existence, rendered with an ironic distance’ (Naficy 2001, 200). Narratively, Utopia also revisits the subjects to which Shahid Saless would return obsessively over and over again during his career: his concern with and empathy for society’s outsiders, reflective of his own ‘outsider’ status in German society (and, to a lesser extent, even within Iran); the theme of isolation, and the alienation of his characters from their surroundings and from other people, including their own family members, as well as society at large; and the effects of trauma and its various causes, such as the death of one’s\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 28\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\nPOINT OF VIEW, SYMBOLISM AND MUSIC IN UTOPIA\n\n29\n\nmother, the loss of one’s job and, particularly in Utopia, the use of violence to terrorise and control. For example, there is a scene in Utopia in which the pimp Heinz (Manfred Zapatka) punches the youngest of the sex workers, the rebellious student Susie (Gabriele Fischer), directly in the face. It is not the first time that we have seen Heinz use physical violence against the women who work in his brothel. Indeed, as early as the film’s opening pre-credits sequence, we witness Heinz drag his long-suffering partner Renate (Imke Barnstedt) into his car by her hair, whereupon he drives her to a specific location and forces her out on to the street to work at night, as he looks on impassively from behind the wheel of his car, parked nearby, smoking a cigarette. In another scene, he repeatedly slams Renate’s face into the counter of the bar in the brothel, where they serve their clients alcohol. We have even seen him assault Susie already once, in an earlier scene, slapping her when she threatens to leave the brothel and berating her co-workers for putting up with Heinz’s abusive behaviour. The threat of physical violence, as a means of intimidation and control over Renate and Susie, as well as the other women – Rosie (Gundula Petrovka), Helga (Johanna Sophia) and Monika (Birgit Anders) – permeates the entire film and informs every interaction Heinz has with them (Fig. 2.1). Yet the moment when Heinz strikes Susie remains shocking, not least because of the suddenness with which Heinz lashes out, with little to no emotion or concern for the consequences, as if it were a reflex action. Misogyny and violence are evidently so ingrained in the character of Heinz, that his actions seem almost instinctual, as if he were lashing out like a wild animal. Moments like these run throughout Shahid Saless’s films: not moments of violence necessarily, but rather moments that jolt us out of the sense of familiarity into which we are frequently lulled, even if that sense of familiarity is not always comforting or reassuring. Instances that spring to mind include the startling conclusion to A Time of Maturity (1976), when the film’s young\n\nFigure 2.1 Heinz’s abusive behaviour.

Or the closing moments of Diary of a Lover (1977), when the police discover the dead body of Michael’s ‘lover’, Monika, hidden underneath his bed. Or the murder scene that occurs early on in The Willow Tree (1984) – adapted from the short story of the same name by Chekhov – the close-up of the mace connecting with the victim’s head, accompanied by a sickening dull thud, and shattering the image of the seemingly idyllic, pastoral world that has been constructed in the opening moments of the film, the murder taking on an almost biblical resonance, as if we are watching Cain slay his brother Abel.1 As typical as Utopia undoubtedly is of Shahid Saless’s broader style, it is nevertheless one of his most atypical films in a number of ways. While most of his stories are presented from the point of view of one main character, Utopia is very much an ensemble piece, where the story is told from multiple perspectives. Moreover, whereas Shahid Saless’s protagonists are predominantly male and can be viewed as ciphers for Shahid Saless himself – he was particularly honest about the extent to which the character of Paul in Roses for Africa (1992) was a self-portrait (Naficy 2001, 201–2) – five of the six central characters in Utopia are female. Regardless, Shahid Saless manages to continue the autobiographical streak running throughout his films, by way of his use of symbolism, reflecting his own sense of displacement in West Germany. Indeed, Shahid Saless’s use of symbolism in Utopia, especially his use of music, feels more explicit – though no less powerful – than in any of his other films. It is worth while taking the time to examine these differences more closely, not only because they will help us to understand and appreciate Utopia better, as well as Shahid Saless’s other works (Utopia’s sheer length and relentless bleakness make it one of his most challenging films, despite the beauty of its design and structure), but also because it sheds light on the director’s versatility as a filmmaker, and his ability to approach different content and marry it to the appropriate form, while at the same time making a film that can still be understood as very personal. THE GAZE AND POINT OF VIEW\n\nAs noted, Utopia is one of Shahid Saless’s most uncharacteristic films, not least because, unlike nearly all of his other films, which usually focus on one lone protagonist, in Utopia our point of view is dispersed across the film’s six central characters, with no single perspective displacing or being given significant prominence over the other. Furthermore, that point of view is almost exclusively female rather than male. The narrative is framed entirely from the point\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 30\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\nPOINT OF VIEW, SYMBOLISM AND MUSIC IN UTOPIA\n\n31\n\nof view of Renate, Rosie, Susie, Helga and Monika, with the exception of some scenes in which, uncomfortably, our point of view is aligned with that of Heinz, and some others in which we are left alone in the company of Heinz, usually in his own room-cum-office, which is also located within the brothel. However, even these latter scenes raise more questions than they provide answers about Heinz’s character. For example, in one scene Heinz experiences what looks to be a very painful migraine, clutching his head and moaning as he kneels down on the floor in agony. The reason for these migraines is never explained, nor do we see Heinz seeking any medical treatment for them. Likewise, in another scene we see him looking at what appear to be family photos, including one of himself when he was younger, but apart from some background information from Renate as to how she and Heinz first met and her first (positive) impressions of him, we learn nothing about his family history. One might construe that Heinz’s hatred of women is linked to some traumatic event in his past, a troubled relationship with his mother perhaps, and that the migraines are some kind of physical symptom of the malignant hatred that will eventually destroy him, but Shahid Saless never makes this explicit. Heinz remains very much a mystery to us, an object of fear and cruelty, as well as a sadist. This is not to suggest that there are not many powerful moments in Shahid Saless’s œuvre that are presented primarily from a female perspective. His extended documentary interview with Lotte H. Eisner would be an obvious case in point. In terms of his feature films, the close-up of the disdainful expression on the face of the railway worker’s wife in Still Life, as she looks at the young man who will eventually take over her husband’s position disrespectfully guzzling down the meal she has prepared for him; and the heart-breaking scene in A Time of Maturity, when Michael’s mother, staring at her reflection in a mirror, breaks down in tears upon returning home late one night, are two other moments that spring vividly to mind. But they are just moments. Even in said scene from A Time of Maturity, our viewpoint is, to an extent, filtered through the eyes of Michael, who lies in bed awake, unbeknownst to his mother, listening to her silently as she cries. Utopia is markedly different in so far as Renate, Rosie, Susie, Helga and Monika are all fully-rounded characters in their own right, despite the way in which all of its characters are subject to the observational gaze of Shahid Saless’s camera. Their conflicting outlooks on the world and their different approaches to Heinz emerge strongly during the course of the film. Renate has long since resigned herself to a life of victimhood, whereas Susie is more defiant and openly challenges Heinz on numerous occasions (and suffers the brutal consequences for doing so). Monika is new to her role as a sex worker and clearly insecure, whereas Rosie is far more experienced and sexually confident. Helga, meanwhile, attempts in one scene to seduce Heinz, declaring her love for him. The different tactics that the women employ, the distinctive attitudes\n\n6282_Fatehrad.indd 31\n\n12/03/20 12:04 PM\n\n32\n\nCHRISTOPHER GOW\n\nthat they have towards their work and their clients, and the way in which they negotiate their individual relationships with Heinz, before joining forces to kill him at the end of the film, are central to the drama of Utopia. Nevertheless, despite their strong personalities, the fact that the lives of the women rotate so closely around the figure of Heinz, and that their behaviours are so heavily motivated by their fear of how Heinz will react, is reflective of the unequal power dynamics that exist within the brothel. Such an interpretation is supported by the importance that is ascribed to the act of watching throughout Utopia. Indeed, watching is an important act in many of Shahid Saless’s films. In Hans – A Young Man in Germany (1985), set in Berlin during and in the immediate aftermath of World War Two, the titular half-Jewish protagonist gleans information from his surroundings by quietly observing the world around him, including its inhabitants. We spend a great deal of time watching Hans as he, in turn, silently watches events unfold before him and observes how human nature manifests itself, sometimes kindly but mostly cruelly. This is also true of Zamini, the schoolboy from A Simple Event, as well as Michael in A Time of Maturity. In fact, all of Shahid Saless’s child characters watch and interpret the world around them, in order to understand their surroundings and survive. By stark contrast, the way in which the elderly railway worker from Still Life silently watches the world go by adds to the sense that he and wife are being left behind, as life and so-called ‘progress’ march on. In even starker contrast, in Utopia, for Heinz the act of watching (like physical violence) is a means of control. This is displayed from the very beginning of the film, during the opening credits, as Heinz watches Renate from his car as she waits on the pavement for a potential client to accost her. At one point Shahid Saless cuts to an interior shot from the inside of the car, as if he were positioning the viewer in the back seat and placing them uncomfortably alongside Heinz, as he watches Renate through the windshield. These images are\n\nFigure 2.2 Heinz’s rehearsal.

The idea that watching serves as a means of control is reinforced in the scene where all of the women ‘audition’ for Heinz before the brothel’s official opening, introducing themselves to him as they would to one of the brothel’s clients (Fig. 2.2). In this scene Heinz inspects the women with clinical detachment and brutally critiques their ‘performances’. He derides Monika’s stiltedness and anxiety, while praising Rosie’s flirtatiousness. (As noted, with the possible exception of Renate, the film establishes very early on that only Rosie has previous experience of working in a brothel, and is therefore more adept at pleasuring her clients and winning Heinz’s praise.) The sense that the women cannot escape Heinz’s watchful gaze, even when he is physically not in their presence, is emphasised throughout the film, perhaps most powerfully during one scene in which, in an act of defiance, Susie impulsively throws a bottle of alcohol at the bar and smashes a number of other bottles and glasses to pieces. Rosie quickly breaks down in terror at the thought of what Heinz will do when he returns to the flat and sees what they have done. In another scene, when Heinz goes to pour himself a drink, he notices that the amount of alcohol in the bottle has gone down because some of the women have secretly been consuming small amounts, in defiance of the ground rules that Heinz laid down upon opening the brothel. In Utopia there is an overwhelming sense that nothing escapes Heinz’s scrutiny. Then there are the clients themselves, one of which, a policeman no less, is notably not interested in any kind of physical contact, but is rather a voyeur who prefers to gaze upon Helga as he masturbates in front of he"
