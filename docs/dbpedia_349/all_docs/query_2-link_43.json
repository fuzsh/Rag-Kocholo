        "text": "On the auspicious occasion of Dussehra, Shahid Kapoor announced his next project. Titled 'Deva', the actor even surprised fans with his first look from the upcoming film. The film will release in theatres on Dussehra 2024.\n\nSHAHID KAPOOR ANNOUNCES 'DEVA'\n\nAs the entire country has delved into the festive spirit, Shahid Kapoor treated fans with a beautiful surprise. He announced his next film titled 'Deva.' The actor shared his fierce looks from the movie on Instagram and revealed that it will be released in theatres in Dussehra in 2024. After the success of his latest OTT projects 'Farzi' and 'Bloody Daddy', fans are excited to see Shahid Kapoor's next films. 'Deva' will release in theatres on October 11, 2024.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn the first look, the actor dons a rugged look and can be seen holding a gun in one hand. The actor was last seen in 'Bloody Daddy.' In this upcoming film, Shahid will be seen playing the role of an indomitable police officer. The intensity and edginess infused into the character, coupled with Kapoor's striking depiction of a determined cop, are poised to leave a lasting impact on audiences.\n\nSHAHID-KRITI'S FILM'S RELEASE POSTPONED\n\nKatrina Kaif, Vijay Sethupathi's 'Merry Christmas' and Sidharth Malhotra's 'Yodha' will lock horns at the box office on December 7. To prevent further clash, Shahid Kapoor's upcoming film which was scheduled to be released on the same date, has been postponed. The untitled movie will now release on February 9, 2024.\n\nThere have also been reports about the yet-untitled film that it will see Kriti Sanon as a robot and Shahid Kapoor as a scientist, who falls in love with the former. Dharmendra is also part of the project and plays Shahidâ€™s grandfather. Dimple Kapadia will also be seen playing a significant role."
