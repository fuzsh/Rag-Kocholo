        "text": "Shahid Review {3.5/5} & Review Rating\n\nA stunning documentation on the life and times of Shahid Azmi, SHAHID is brave, courageous and often disturbing and that's one of the prime reasons why it makes for a fascinating cinematic experience.\n\nSHAHID is based on the story of slain lawyer Shahid Azmi. Accused of terrorist links, he was imprisoned before he went on to become a fearless lawyer.\n\nWhile the story of Shahid Azmi makes for an interesting read/conversation, Hansal Mehta makes sure he packages the film with abundant drama [the courtroom sequences are spellbinding] in this less-than-2-hour film. But, at heart, SHAHID remains a disturbing film, with Hansal preparing the viewer at the very outset as Shahid witnesses a gruesome act. The events thereafter -- Shahid's training in a terrorist camp and on return, getting picked up by cops and imprisoned amidst hardened criminals -- are chapters that are enlightening.\n\nHansal tries to be close to reality, filming SHAHID at actual locales -- overcrowded neighbourhoods, congested bylanes and cafes -- which adds a lot of credibility to the goings-on. The subtle romance between Shahid and Maryam, one of his clients, deviates your attention from the heavy drama that dominates the film. But the highpoint of the film are the courtroom sequences, without doubt.\n\nWith SHAHID, Hansal takes a giant leap as a storyteller, bringing his creativity out to the fore. By casting the most appropriate names for the parts, Hansal only cements the fact that it's the material that can sweep you off your feet. The only time the film falters is when Hansal doesn't provide details of how Shahid escaped from the terrorist camp and returned to Mumbai safely. The editing [Apurva Asrani] is sharp, with not a dull moment in the narrative.\n\nSHAHID is embellished with superior performances. Raj Kumar portrays the lawyer with brilliance. The sense of vulnerability and helplessness, the uncertain future, the aspirations and just about every emotion that the character encompasses is brought to the fore with ferocious enthusiasm by the actor. Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub, last seen in RAANJHANAA, is incredible as Shahid's brother. Prabhleen Sandhu is exceptional as Shahid's wife. Also, she has a pleasant screen presence. Kay Kay Menon and Tigmanshu Dhulia, cast in brief but significant characters, are wonderful. Vipin Sharma proves yet again that he's a remarkable actor. Prabal Panjabi is effective in a cameo. Ditto for Mukesh Chhabra, who enacts the part of a witness. He's very good. Baljinder Kaur as Shahid's mother is natural. Shalini Vatsa is first-rate.\n\nOn the whole, SHAHID is a brave film. Its gripping story, exceptional execution and bravura performances continue to reverberate much after the screening is over. Strongly recommended!"
