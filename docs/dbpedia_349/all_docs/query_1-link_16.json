        "text": "Connecting films to audiences\n\nWe are a non-profit startup working to create the most comprehensive database of independent films and film festivals, connecting filmmakers with fans and industry leaders. Think IMDb, but exclusively for festival films - with a \"Where to Watch\" link if the film is already out, and a \"Get Notified\" button if the film is not yet available for streaming.\n\nFilmmaker, unlock your film's full potential!\n\nDuring festival screenings, films experience their peak public interest ‚Äî a time when audience engagement and excitement are at their highest.\n\nYet, this significant opportunity for attention often remains unexplored, as films typically make their online debut long after their festival appearances.\n\nIt‚Äôs not just about lost views; it‚Äôs about missing out on building a lasting relationship with your audience, the support and engagement that could fuel your next projects.\n\nVurchel ensures your audience's interest is retained. We alert your fans when the film is ready to stream, maintaining momentum from festivals for wider reach and engagement. With Vurchel, your film's buzz isn't just preserved ‚Äî it's amplified.\n\nAdd your film to Vurchel.com\n\nSupport our mission! üôè\n\nIf you think such a database should exist, allowing cinephiles to discover new festival gems and support their creators, help us make it a reality - and maximize your experience with a Vurchel Pro subscription.\n\nJoin the elite Vurchel Pioneers, the visionary first subscribers of Vurchel Pro.
