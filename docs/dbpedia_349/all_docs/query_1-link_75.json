        "text": "When Deepika Padukone and Irrfan Khan starred together in Piku, they created magic onscreen. Now, the celeb duo is all set to star in a new film which will be based on a fictional story. The new untitled project is a fictional one contrary to earlier reports that it's a biopic on mafia queen Rahima Khan aka Sapna Didi.\n\n\"T-Series, KriArj Entertainment and Vishal Bhardwaj Pictures clarify that their next production is untitled and fictional, starring Deepika Padukone and Irrfan,\" read a statement issued by a representative of T-Series.\n\n\"Piku\" stars Irrfan and Deepika will be directed by Bhardwaj's long-time associate Honey Trehan.\n\nProducer Bhushan Kumar said: \"Deepika and Irrfan are great actors. We are very excited with the subject and are proud of associating with KriArj Entertainment and Vishal Bhardwaj Pictures on this film.\"\n\nThe shooting of the film begins early 2018 and it is slated for release in October 2018.\n\nOn a related note, Deepika Padukone will be seen playing the protagonist in filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s magnum opus Padmavati. The lady will be sharing the screen space with talented actors Shahid Kapoor and Ranveer Singh. The film has been in news for many reasons and one among them is Deepika’s remuneration. If reports are to be believed, the dimpled beauty was paid more than her male co-stars for the film. This comes as a welcoming change in the industry that is refereed as male dominated.\n\n(With IANS Inputs)\n\nFor more entertainment news and updates, follow our Facebook page"
