Boasting of a talented star cast including Ayushmann Khurrana, Kriti Sanon, Rajkummar Rao, and my favorite Pankaj Tripathi, the story revolves around Bitti, who is a free-spirited small-town girl who lives her life on her own terms. What happens to her when she meets Chirag Dubey (Ayushman), and Pritam Vidrohi (Rajkumar Rao) is the whole movie. This one is an entertainment bomb.\n\nWatch the trailer here\n\nCheck out Bareilly ki Barfi\n\n19. Pad Man (2018)\n\nIMDb Rating: 8/10\n\nDirector: R. Balki\n\nWriter: R.

Dear Zindagi (2016)\n\nIMDb Rating: 7.6/10\n\nDirector: Gauri Shinde\n\nWriter: Gauri Shinde\n\nCast: Alia Bhatt, Shah Rukh Khan\n\nI had stopped expecting good movies from Shahrukh Khan after Chennai Express, and I was mostly right. However, the release of Dear Zindagi changed all that. Seeing Shahrukh in a story-driven plot is something of an anomaly these days, and hence Dear Zindagi is a must-watch.
