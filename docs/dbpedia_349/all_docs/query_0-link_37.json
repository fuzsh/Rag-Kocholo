The Bollywood Business movies in the list are some noteworthy attempts at making high-standard films that ooze out inspiration and motivation. Every film out there, be it Bollywood or Hollywood, has a thing or two to teach. Here is the list of Hindi movies related to business and entrepreneurship:\n\n1. Guru\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.8/10\n\nGuru is undoubtedly Abhishek Bachchan's most popular movie. The movie is a brilliant reflection of the life of the man who started the Reliance empire, Dhirubhai Ambani. Although the makers of the movie never openly claimed that the cinematic venture was Dhirubhai's story, the audience and critics who saw the film could scrutinize Dhirubhai Ambani's rise being portrayed on the silver screen.\n\nMani Ratnam's directorial ingenuity makes the movie appealing especially if you're an innovative soul seeking to start your own venture. You will get some insight into what entrepreneurship meant in the 1950s! Guru is one of the best Bollywood movies on business and a must-watch. The most important lesson it has for young entrepreneurs is self-confidence. Do what you want to and not what others want you to. Which is one of the key principles of any business. Being confident in your decisions and taking charge is what entrepreneurship is all about.\n\n2. Baazaar\n\nIMDB Rating: 6.7/10\n\nBaazaar didn't generate much buzz but it was warmly welcomed by the audience and the critics alike. Saif Ali Khan starrer Bazaar is based on how Dalal Street works and what happens behind the closed curtains. To add some masala, the director has included a fictitious storyline. Although the plot may seem to be predictable, aspiring entrepreneurs would still love this Bollywood movie since it shows what a businessman's life is all about.\n\n3. Rocket Singh - Salesman of the Year\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.5/10\n\nRocket Singh is based on a man (having the same name as the movie title) who is employed as a salesperson. He goes on to launch his own company in the same segment that too while doing his day job. Rocket Singh uses his employer's resources for setting up his own venture without letting his boss know about it.\n\nThe movie had an excellent storyline and characterization which weren't utilized to the fullest. As a result, Rocket Singh didn't deliver the impact it was capable of. People starting their own ventures ought to watch this movie for some cues and tricks.\n\n4. Band Baaja Baarat\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.2/10\n\nBand Baaja Baaraat is based on the escapades of a girl and a boy. The girl, Shruti, is determined to do something big in life. On the other hand, the boy, Bitoo, is nonchalant just going with the flow. He finds solace in chilling out with his friends at the Delhi University. The clichéd Bollywood formula ensures the two end up meeting each other.\n\nBut hold on, here's the entrepreneurial stuff—they decide to start a wedding planning venture. The only rule they need to follow is not to love each other. Though this is a work of fiction, you do learn tidbits about a wedding planner's job and the Indian way of doing business.\n\n5. Badmaash Company\n\nIMDB rating: 6/10\n\nShahid Kapoor-starrer Badmaash Company was ahead of its time and was a hit. Badmaash Company is about four friends who do the wrong things in the right way to make hoards of cash.\n\nYou will enjoy Badmaash Company because of the idea it depicts. Some things may feel out of place (illogical?) but then what's Bollywood without some hard-to-explain scenes? Young individuals would love the film because of the bling shown.\n\n6. Corporate\n\nIMDB Rating: 6.5/10\n\nThe Bipasha Basu starrer movie is the only movie that strongly depicts the negative traits of corporate life. Corporate, true to its name, ruminates on how the corporate industry works.\n\nYou get to see the ethics and the culture of a workplace. The film provides insights into how huge industries function and what employees do to cope with professional issues.\n\n7. 3 idiots\n\nIMDB Rating: 8.4/10\n\n3 Idiots is the perfect combination of inspiration, comedy, emotion, and last but not least, love. It is the story of 3 college friends with a varying outlook on education. 3 Idiots propagates the message of formal degrees and certificates not necessarily being a testament to one's knowledge.\n\nThe movie compels the audience to think beyond the established norms in order to live a fulfilling life. An excellent movie that broke many box office records.\n\n8. Wake Up Sid\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.6/10\n\nThough it may not promote startups or entrepreneurship directly, the movie shows why it's important to be familiar with the struggles of life. This movie projects the life of a rich kid, Sid.\n\nIf not below average, he is okayish in his studies and is interested in only hanging around with friends. It is when he leaves his house due to some father-son arguments does he realize the challenges of a middle-class family.\n\n9. Hindi Medium\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.8/10\n\nHindi Medium is about a self-made businessman struggling to get his daughter admitted to a reputed school. The institution demands the parents be literate. As a result, he decides to get her admitted through a quota reserved. The family shifts to a below-average place of living and quits the comforts it was used to.\n\nThe movie simultaneously depicts the challenges faced by the poor and the rich. You will enjoy the subject and the humor depicted. Spoiler alert but the lesson is that education from a big school does not always result in success. Every entrepreneur will enjoy this Bollywood movie.\n\n10. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara\n\nIMDB Rating: 8.1/10\n\nZindagi Na Milegi Dobara teaches us to live life to its fullest and enjoy the roller-coaster ride of ups and downs. The characters are plagued by personal problems and have lost the charm of living.\n\nA three-week group vacation makes them realize that it's not worth being stressed out and hesitant all the time. With an amazing direction and a plot full of twists, you'll definitely love the film.\n\n11. Raajneeti\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.1/10\n\nAs the name suggests, Raajneeti is based on political vendetta and vengeance. The political backdrop, the tussle for power, and a formidable cast teach you the challenges and situations one's going to face in a competitive environment.\n\n12. Special 26\n\nIMDB rating: 8/10\n\nMovie buffs and entrepreneurs should watch Special 26 to see the wonders of creative thinking and execution. Special 26 takes place in the eighties. A group of tricksters carries out one of the biggest heists in India. Just to let you know, this is based on a real-life event.\n\n13. Once Upon A Time in Mumbaai\n\nIMDB rating:7.4/10\n\nThe film speaks volumes about illegal businesses and trades. The under-the-table transactions, the tussle for power, backstabbing, etc. are relevant to the corporate culture of today. Entrepreneurs could use this movie as a guide for identifying unethical practices and not go astray.\n\n14. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\n\nIMDB Rating: 8.2/10\n\nThis Bollywood movie is a massive source of inspiration for many of us. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag goes beyond being a biography and teaches a few lessons on dealing with unforeseen hardships.\n\n15. Lakshya\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.9/10\n\nLakshya is another inspirational movie dealing with life in general. Its song “Lakshya” often graces music playlists when one seeks motivation. The movie dawns on the realization that fear of failure is the only obstacle one may face in achieving his or her goals and aspirations.\n\n16. Manthan\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.7/10\n\nRelease year: 1976\n\nThis movie first came in 1976 and it has a setting in rural India. The complications faced by the veterinary Dr. Rao in setting up a milk cooperative for the villagers which disturbs the socio-economic condition of the village are shown.\n\nThe Hindi feature film becomes a great and earliest example of entrepreneurship in India. Depictions of gender problems, caste discrimination, and lack of support are evident in this 1976's movie, Manthan starring Girish Karnad and Smitha Patil.\n\nHollywood Business & Entrepreneur-related Movies\n\nBollywood & Hollywood Business movies can teach various lessons on how to start a business, grow the business & other entrepreneurial lessons. Here is the list of the best entrepreneurial movies of all time. These business-related movies will surely inspire you. Have a look -\n\n1. The Godfather\n\nIMDB Rating: 9.2/10\n\nSuccessful business in one sentence. This movie is an inspiration to all future leaders. It has not just one message but a number of them all which will directly move you. It focuses on the importance of relationships with family, friends, and even enemies.\n\nThe movie makes the young generation understand ethical as well as unethical means to deal with situations that today or maybe tomorrow will definitely come in their way and they've to face them.\n\n\"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse\"\n\n2. GoodFellas\n\nIMDB Rating: 8.7/10\n\nThe 1990 drama-crime film discusses the mob life in New York and gives you a number of lessons too. Through the dirty drug business, the average life it gives you. Some important lesson includes not running away from work, and the value of words, promises and money.\n\nAlso, it highlights the need for humour as a must requirement in order to live the good life. Laughing on mistakes, and on situations makes them easier to deal with, and if not at least you had a good laugh.\n\nIf You're Part Of A Crew, Nobody Ever Tells You That They're Going To Kill You\"\n\n3. Fight Club\n\nIMDB Rating: 8.8/10\n\nThis movie may not teach you any business lesson, but an important life lesson. The movie was a total flop at the time of its release. However, people later realized the art of this movie. The movie depicts the life of a person who has everything, a good job, apartment, money, etc. But still struggles to be happy.\n\nHe is going through many mental problems. Later, he meets a man who teaches him how to live life. This movie tells us how mafia groups are born and what can happen if you are not happy with your life. The movie takes an interesting turn at the end. It is full of mystery, you just don't realize it till the end.\n\nWe buy things we don't need with the money we don't have to impress people we don't like.\n\n4. The Godfather Trilogy\n\nThe Godfather Trilogy is possible the all-time best masterpiece of cinema for entrepreneurs. The movie highlights why relationships and building networks matter, why helping people lends itself to a good business and why understanding competition is very crucial.\n\nThe movie is intensely entertaining and packed with thrilling, thought-provoking scenes that will surely leave you better prepared to handle your business challenges. The movie addresses issues about competitive strategies, corporate take-overs, alliances, corporate succession, and diversification that will result in the success of your firm.\n\n“I have learned more in the streets than in any class room.”\n\n5. The Wolf of Wall Street\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street is based on the true story of Jordan Belfort who was a millionaire stockbroker during his time. It follows through his rise and fall as an entrepreneur and showcases how his firm Stratton Oakmont was engaged in penny stock trading and became unexceptionally successful which drew the attention of the FBI as they suspected securities scams.\n\nJordan Belfort is an example of what an entrepreneur should not be. He was swayed by greed, driven by unethical practices, had little or no empathy towards people around him, and spent too much time on drugs and alcohol – which eventually led to his downfall. There is also a scene in the movie which features Matthew McConaughey where he describes what it takes to be a stockbroker which is one of the best scenes in the movie.\n\nWork until your bank account looks like a phone number.\"\n\n6. The Pursuit of Happiness\n\n\"Don't let anyone tell you, that you can't do something\"\n\nThis movie is very close to reality. It inspires you and tells you that if you want to be \"rags to riches\" in real you have to go and get whatever you want. It shows struggles in ordinary life that a common man has to face from bad luck to rejection to hard work that goes in vain, it has all.\n\nThe honesty of this movie will make you realize the importance of struggle and the need for patience on your way to success.\n\n7. Jobs (2013)\n\nMichael Fassbender starring Steve Jobs is based on the life of Apple co-founder – Steve Jobs. The movie is a biopic with three sequences – all depicting a pivotal point in Steve’s life. He faces many problems in his personal and professional life while trying to launch three products in the market.\n\nIt takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution to paint an intimate portrait of the brilliantly talented man as its epicentre. It is a great movie that is inspirational in its very essence – it shows how great ideas are not born through compromise but through vision and determination.\n\n\"I’m not dismissing the value of higher education; I’m simply saying it comes at the expense of experience.\"\n\n8. The Social Network\n\nThe movie is based on Mark Zuckerberg - the founder of Facebook. It shows an 18 yr old old boy learning real business. He learns about the darker side of the business when his idea is stolen.\n\nProtecting your ideas in the corporate world and planning for the worst is what an entrepreneur must always be ready for. Also, Ideas have no value, what matters is applying them in the real world.\n\n\"Ideas have no value\"\n\n9. Glengarry Glen Ross\n\nGlengarry Glen Ross is based on an award-winning play by David Mamet which shows the plight of real estate salespeople during a disruptive and turbulent sales season. The motivational speech given by Baldwin to the sales team is a moving scene in the film.\n\nThe movie shows how it is like to function and operate in a high-pressure sales atmosphere and how you need to use your wits in order to survive and thrive. It takes a closer look at the betrayals and lies people endure just to succeed in their field of business, and illustrates how vicious the business world can be.\n\n\"If everyone thinks one thing, then I say bet the other way.\"\n\n10. Citizen Kane\n\nCitizen Kane is a movie that even if you are not an entrepreneur, or an aspirant too, you should watch regardless as it is one of the masterpieces of cinema. The movie revolves around the life of Charles Foster Kane who is a newspaper tycoon, loosely based on William Randolph Hearst, and his quest for fortune, fame, and power.\n\nBut in the end, Kane comes to a realization and understands what is really important in life. It teaches one that while aspiring to be a successful businessman is a goal of every entrepreneur, it is not the only goal in life.\n\nThere is only one person in the world who is going to decide what I'm going to do and that's me.\"\n\n11. Catch Me If You Can\n\nCatch Me If You Can is based on a true story about the successful con artist Frank Abagnale who charms everyone with his skill mastery. The movie is a classic film that exemplifies the entrepreneurial journey. It covers important themes like creative problem solving, turning something good out of a bad situation, and good old hustle to reach the top, to reach the success one desires.\n\nYou will learn many things from this movie – entrepreneurship skills, creativity and innovation, business vision, perseverance, personal sales techniques, and funding sources. That should, of course, be done with an ethical code of conduct.\n\nDear Dad, you always told me that an honest man has nothing to fear, so I'm trying my best not to be afraid.\"\n\n12. Cocktail (1988)\n\nThe 1988 Tom Cruise starring film shows a bartender with high aspirations who reads books all the time. The story is a mix of drama and romance. It shows how valuable an idea is.\n\nAn entrepreneur is not who works only if the things come out as per him and his ideal choices but is the one who can make his idea work anywhere. Even a bartender can then become a bar owner. And even a shopkeeper is an entrepreneur because he believes in his idea and in the best way can deliver it.\n\n\"If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere\"\n\n13. Moneyball\n\nThis movie is based on baseball but is entertaining to all demographics. Brad Pitt portrays Billy Beane who is the general manager of the Oakland A’s. The team is met with a deficit of finances to spend on players and Beane had to discover unique tactics to compete. He overcomes the odds stacked against his team. He decides to take the untested sabre-metric approach toward building his team to achieve incredible results in the MLB (Major Baseball League).\n\nBilly Bean had to adapt in order to survive.
