        "text": "Shahid's major tryst with success happened with Imtiaz Ali's 'Jab We Met', in which he paired opposite Kareena Kapoor Khan. While Shahid and Kareena had also starred together before in 'Fida', 'Chup Chup Ke' and '36 China Town', their on-screen chemistry in 'Jab We Met' set major on-screen couple goals in the hearts of their fans.\n\nShahid played the role of a quiet and collective businessman, named Aditya Kashyap, whose personality undergoes a fun, positive twist after meeting Kareena's character -- Geet.\n\nA landmark film in Shahid's career is Vishal Bhardwaj's 'Haider' (2014), an adaptation of William Shakespeare's play 'Hamlet'.\n\nThe bold and brave film, featuring Tabu as Haider's mother Ghazala, was set up in the Kashmir insurgency in the 1990s.\n\nShahid absorbed and reflected the complexities of love, revenge, and pain through his intense character.\n\nOne of the iconic sequences of Shahid in the film is the almost three-minute \"Hum hai ki hum nahi?\" monologue Haider delivers in the middle of the road with his uncle, mother, and others in the crowd watching. The film also stars the late Irrfan Khan.\n\nShahid is now all set to woo the audience with the never-seen-before avatars in the upcoming projects. He is coming up with a sports drama 'Jersey', in which he plays the role of a father and husband, with a broken dream career. The film, also starring Mrunal Thakur, will hit the theatres on April 14.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\n'Squid Game' star Anupam Tripathi joins podcast drama 'Scammers'\n\n'You are dearly missed': Shilpa Shetty remembers Sridevi on her fourth death anniversary\n\nTaapsee Pannu bags Sudhir Mishra's yet-to-be-titled short film\n\nShahid Kapoor Bollywood actor Movies films birthday"
