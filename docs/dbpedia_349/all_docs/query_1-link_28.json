        "text": "Films have the power to make us feel a number of emotions in about 2-3 hours and the really good ones stay with us even after they're no longer playing on the screen. Shahid Kapoor's recent release, Jersey, is one such film that got us laughing, crying, hoping, and dreaming, in theatres.\n\nThe film is now available on Netflix and if you haven't had a chance to watch this masterpiece already, we urge you to use the weekend to do so. The film is beyond just a sports film. It is about a cricketer and his dream of being a part of the Indian Cricket Team, a moving tale of hope, that keeps us going even when all seems lost.\n\nJersey isn't the first sports film that got us emotional. There have been others as well that had a similar effect. Let's take a look:\n\n1. Chak De! India\n\nIt's impossible to talk about moving sports films and not mention this masterpiece that got us rooting for our National Game, Hockey, back in 2007. Shah Rukh Khan played the role of Indian Women's Hockey team coach, Kabir Khan. How he leads the team towards victory forms the story of this fictional sports film. SRK's '70 minutes' speech still rings a bell in our minds.\n\n2. Dangal\n\nA sports film with a strong message that girls are no less than boys when it comes to wrestling, Dangal moved the audience back in 2016. The film was made tax-free in several states owing to its rich content and starred Aamir Khan in the leading role. Fatima Sana Shaikh played the role of wrestler Geeta Phogat while Sanya Malhotra played the role of her sister, Babita. Dangal, a biographical film, made a lot of headlines when it released.\n\n3. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag\n\nBased on the life of Commonwealth Games champion Milkha Singh, the film Bhaag Milkha Bhaag released in 2013 and starred Farhan Akhtar in the titular role. Apart from giving us an insight into the amount of hardwork that goes into winning each race, the film also gave us a glimpse of Mikha Singh's hardships on the personal front. The film also starred Sonam Kapoor and Divya Dutta in pivotal roles.\n\n4. Saina\n\nParineeti Chopra's first sports film, Saina, told the story of ace badminton champion Saina Nehwal. From a little girl playing badminton at a sports academy to becoming world's number 1, the film traces her journey of success. Saina also gave us a glimpse of the badminton champion's personal life, allowing the audience to form an emotional connect with the film.\n\n5. Mary Kom\n\nWho is more powerful than a boxer? A boxer who is a mother as well. Priyanka Chopra played the titular role in this biographical sports film based on the life of India's boxing champion Mary Kom. The film traces her triumph, and the comeback into sport after becoming a mother. One of the most memorable dialogues of the film is, \"Ek aurat maa ban kar bahut strong ho jata hai, Aur tumhara taaqat ab do guna badh gaya hai. (A woman is stronger after becoming a mother... and you have double the strength now).\""
