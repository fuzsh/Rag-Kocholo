Released in the theaters on August 2, the film opened to a lukewarm response from the audience. Per industry tracker Sacknilk, the movie opened to Rs 1.85 crore and had collected Rs 7.75 crore at the box office, until Monday. Directed by Neeraj Pandey, it is said to be made on a budget of Rs 100 crore.\n\nMaidaan (2024)\n\nDevgn's highly anticipated sports drama film, ‘Maidaan,’ also failed to click with the viewers. Based on the life of India’s football coach Syed Abdul Rahim, the biographical drama is helmed by Amit Ravindernath Sharma and features Devgn as Rahim. Per reports, the movie opened to a positive response on April 10 but proved to be a failure at the box office. Made on a budget of Rs 235 crore, ‘Maidaan’ managed to collect Rs 68 crore, worldwide.\n\nShaitaan (2024)\n\nDirected by Vikas Bahl, ‘Shaitaan’ is a supernatural horror thriller that hit cinema halls on March 8.

A huge hit at the box office, ‘Shaitaan' made a business of Rs 211 crore. The film's budget is said to be Rs 60-65 crore. More than Devgn, Madhavan’s performance as the antagonist was met with critical acclaim.\n\nBholaa (2023)\n\nThe Neo-noir action thriller is the fourth directorial of Devgn after ‘U, Me Aur Hum’ in 2008, ‘Shivaay’ in 2016, and ‘Runway 34’ in 2022. The film is a remake of Lokesh Kanagaraj’s superhit Tamil film ‘Kaithi’ which was released in 2019 and starred Karthi in the lead. Apart from Devgn in the titular role, it also features Tabu as SP Diana Joseph, and Deepak Dobariyal as Ashwatthama ‘Ashu’, among others.
