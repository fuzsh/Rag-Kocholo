        "text": "Shahid Kapoor will feature in a mythological film based on the Indian epic Mahabharat and play one of the most powerful characters from the text. The film will be produced by Vashu Bhagnani and Jackky Bhagnani's Pooja Entertainment.\n\nAs per a report in Pinkvilla, the film will have extensive VFX shots and be mounted on a massive scale. The movie will be directed by a southern filmmaker whose identity is being kept under wraps.\n\nA source close to the development told the portal, \"It's the most ambitious project for Vashu and Jackky Bhagnani. They have been developing this project since early this year and are determined to create a visual spectacle that Indian audiences have never seen before. Shahid has been their first and only choice since the inception of this project, and heâ€™s already signed on for it. The movie is a technologically advanced project that promises to transport audiences to a never-before-explored world.\""
