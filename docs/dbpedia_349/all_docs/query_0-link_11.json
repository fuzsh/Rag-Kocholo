        "text": "Hi Raja,\n\nYou are very right in your observation. Actually this was not a review of the GREAT CLASSIC. But I only wanted to talk about the movie collectively with respect to every single actor in it. I only wanted to get the younger generaton know about these kind of inspiring movies which they must see.\n\nSo it is a spirited write up on one of the most important movie on our Independence and not a review as such.\n\nAlso, truly speaking I dont feel like reviewing the OLD CLASSICS like I do with the Latest Releases. I really feel those immortal movies are simply above any reviewing system and dont feel like doing it.\n\nThanks for writing in and keep in touch, Looking forward to more comments too...\n\nCheers!"
