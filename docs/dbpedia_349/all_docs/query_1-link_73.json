        "text": "Filmmaker Vishal Bhardwaj has shot down reports about Rangoon being a biopic, saying it is a work of fiction. National Award-winning filmmaker Bhardwaj's period drama is set in the 1940s amidst the turmoil of India's independence struggle, and includes some historic references. There was a buzz that the film is a biopic. But Bhardwaj has set the record straight saying that the movie doesn't follow the life of any of the various actresses of the era. \"'Rangoon' is a love triangle set in the era of the Second World War. We have tried to create the ethos of the era but it's a work of fiction,\" Bhardwaj said in a statement.\n\nIn the film, Kangana Ranaut plays the role of a seductress Julia and Saif Ali Khan is the filmmaker in love with her. Shahid Kapoor is the soldier named Nawab Malik who falls in love with Julia during a train journey. Bhardwaj added: \"It certainly doesn't follow the life of any of the various actresses of that era be it that of Fearless Nadia, Miss Zebunissa, Miss Padma or Ramola. 'Rangoon' is a period drama that has a love triangle in its centre, its not at all a biopic.\" Rangoon, directed by Bhardwaj under the banners of Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment and Viacom 18 Motion Pictures, will release on February 24. (ALSO READ - Kangana Ranaut's BOLD item song from Rangoon will be out next week and we have all the details)\n\nEarlier there were reports stating that the director, Bharadwaj had this wish to make a film on the life of the stunt queen Fearless Nadia. In fact, it was further added that the ace director even signed a German actress Franka Potente for the part. Well, the project never moved beyond those news reports. While Kangana's character reflects a lot of the Fearless Nadia in Rangoon, the reports aren't to be believed. The superbly sleek cut trailer shows Ranaut having a great deal of fun doing the Nadia like ‘Fearless’ stunts and flirting with and seducing the two men in her life, played by Shahid Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan. Rangoon, set in 1944 when World War 2 raged across the world, the movie wears a lush ripe look.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-tC0wcIu24\n\nHave you watched the trailer of Rangoon yet?
