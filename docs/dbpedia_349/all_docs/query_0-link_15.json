        "text": "Rohit Shetty’s cop universe has grown from the big screen to the digital realm on Amazon. The series features Sidharth Malhotra (Shershaah) as the committed and self-sacrificing Delhi police officer Kabir\n\nMalik who risks his family life and safety to dismantle a dangerous criminal network threatening innocent lives. Indian Police Force grows on you as the series follows Kabir chasing his terrorist adversary Zarar while facing numerous obstacles in his mission to protect people. A perfect blend of crime, action and drama, Indian Police Force also stars Shilpa Shetty and Vivek Oberoi in pivotal roles.\n\nWatch it here and read its review here.\n\nKing Khan returned to rule the box office with this masala film—that packs in some great music and action sequences—in early 2023 after a 4-year long hiatus. In what is being touted as another spy thriller from the house of Yash Raj Films, Pathaan stars Shah Rukh Khan as the eponymous Indian RAW agent, who is tasked with averting a major impending attack against India. Pitted against the ruthless mercenary Jim (John Abraham), who has a history of his own, SRK’s Pathaan finds Rubai (Deepika Padukone), a Pakistani agent, as his only possible ally, despite countless betrayals and a looming deal with destruction.\n\nWatch it here.\n\nSoon after his cameo in Pathaan that united him with SRK (Karan Arjun anyone?), Salman Khan returned in this third Tiger instalment. Shot across some beautiful locales and packing a punch with elaborate action sequences, the movie is a true family entertainer. This time, Tiger (Salman Khan) finds out about a new military group that is planning something deadly, headed by a deeply motivated Aatish Rehman (Emraan Hashmi), who has history with Tiger and a personal vendetta to settle. Salman Khan fans are in for a treat as Tiger and Zoya (Katrina Kaif) overcome arms dealers, assassins, and the immensely calculative Aatish in this patriotic action movie.\n\nWatch it here.\n\nHack: Crimes Online is a must-watch if you are a book-turned-movie/series aficionado. Directed by Parmeet Sethi and adapted from the works of renowned Indian cybercrime investigator, Amit Dubey, this thriller series follows real-life instances of online crimes. The series features ACP Ashutosh Malik (Vipul Gupta) who ropes in a young coding genius Shakti (Riddhi Kumar) to solve complex cybercrimes. Earlier this year, the series also had a Republic Day special finale episode on January 26th and is a must- watch for I-Day.\n\nWatch it here.\n\nIt’s not often that you find an Indian biographical war drama as one of the top-ranked on IMDb. But Shershaah has it all. While it pays a posthumous tribute to the life of Kargil war hero Vikram Batra, a captain in the Indian Army, it does it with aplomb. There’s action, romance, drama, and chartbuster songs that are on umpteen playlists. Directed by Vishnuvardhan, Shershaah stars Siddharth Malhotra as the spirited young soldier who fought in the 1999 Kargil war and was killed in action.\n\nWatch it here.\n\nLooking to binge watch a multi-episode patriotic series? Then watch Rakshak – India’s Braves on Amazon’s miniTV. Inspired by real-life incidents, this follows the story of a young soldier, Lt Triveni Singh (Varun Mitra), who sacrificed his own life [VA1] [RR[2] to safeguard over 300 civilians who were caught in the crossfire, while trying to secure Jammu Railway Station. Directed by Akshay Chaubey, and produced by Juggernaut, the film also stars Barun Sobti, Kanika Mann, Mrinal Naval, Mrinal Kulkarni, and Mohit Chauhan. With high-octane battle sequences and enthralling cinematography, this courageous and heroic story is a great watch.\n\nWatch it here.\n\nWith his impressive acting chops and selection of movies, Vicky Kaushal is quickly becoming synonymous with patriotic movies. An IMDb top-rated powerful historical drama, Sardar Udham brings to life the story of a revolutionary freedom fighter played by Kaushal. Directed by Shoojit Sircar, the film showcases the life of the iconic figure who sought vengeance for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. With a compelling narrative, stellar performances, and stunning cinematography, Sardar Udham is a deeply engrossing must-watch for the upcoming I-Day.\n\nWatch it here.\n\nThe brilliance of Alia Bhatt and the gripping suspense of a female Indian spy make Raazi a great addition to your I-Day watchlist. Raazi takes viewers on a rollercoaster ride via the life of a young Kashmiri woman called Sehmat Khan (Alia Bhatt) who is thrust into the world of espionage during the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war. Directed by Meghna Gulzar, the film showcases Sehmat as an undercover agent who marries into a Pakistani military family to gather crucial information for India. Raazi beautifully portrays the tale of Sehmat’s bravery and patriotism that will keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nWatch it here.\n\nThis JP Dutta epic is arguably the most patriotic Hindi war movie of all time. With an ensemble cast led by Sunny Deol, Suniel Shetty, and Jackie Shroff, Border chronicles the extraordinary events of the 1971 war during the battle of Longewala. Delving into the lives of Indian soldiers who valiantly defended their post against a massive Pakistani assault, the film comes as a complete patriotic package. Filled with adrenaline-pumping action, intense emotions, soulful music, and heartwarming moments of brotherhood, Border remains an enduring classic in Indian cinema.\n\nWatch it here.\n\nThe Ghazi Attack is a war film that takes viewers on an underwater voyage during the 1971 Indo-Pak war. Directed by Sankalp Reddy, the movie brings to life the covert mission carried out by the Indian Navy submarine INS Karanj, as it sets out to thwart the Pakistani submarine PNS Ghazi. With a stellar star cast led by Kay Kay Menon, Rana Daggubati, and Atul Kulkarni, the film navigates through high-stakes encounters and nail-biting suspense.\n\nWatch it here.\n\nLooking for inspiration this I-Day? How about a historical drama of 21 Sikh soldiers vs 10,000 Afghan invaders? Watch the historical drama Kesari as it recounts the inspiring battle of Saragarhi. Starring Akshay Kumar as Havildar Ishar Singh, the film tells the story of a small contingent of Sikh soldiers facing off against a massive army of Afghan invaders. Brimming with valour, sacrifice, and camaraderie, Kesari portrays the spirit of these brave warriors as they fiercely defend their post.\n\nWatch it here.\n\nYes, there have been countless movies on the young martyr Shaheed Bhagat Singh. Yet, what makes The Legend Of Bhagat Singh stand out as an IMDb chartbuster is this perfect blend of historical accuracy and heartfelt emotions. An inspiring biographical drama that pays homage to Shaheed Bhagat Singh (Ajay Devgn), the film is a timeless tribute to India’s fight for freedom. Directed by Rajkumar Santoshi, the movie ably utilises Devgn’s talents in depicting Singh’s unwavering dedication and his ultimate sacrifice for India’s independence.\n\nWatch it here.\n\nWatch it for one of SRK’s most patriotic performances. Watch it for the title song. Watch it for the inspiring “Sattar (70) Minute” speech (goosebumps). Chak De India follows the story of Kabir Khan (Shahrukh Khan), an ex-Indian hockey Captain who is appointed to coach the Indian women's national hockey team. A fun, patriotic sports film, Chak De India shows how Khan trains a rag-tag bunch of girls from diverse backgrounds to play as 'Team India' and to play for the love of the game.\n\nWatch it here.\n\nJoining our list of female-led historical patriotic films is Ae Watan Mere Watan starring Sara Ali Khan as a brave young girl, who starts an underground radio station to spread the message of unity amidst India's struggle for freedom in 1942.
