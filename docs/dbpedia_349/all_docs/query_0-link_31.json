In every scene, I was talking to myself, asking questions and answering them, and reacting to things alone. I kept wondering if this was going to continue.”\n\n“Later, I learned the backstory of Goddess Kritikayein, who was one of six women married to seven ‘rishi munis,’ who raised Kartik and later united against Chhathi Maiyya. It was then that I understood I would always have to play multiple roles,” she said.\n\nThe actress added that this was “different and new compared to anything” she has done in her career before.\n\n“I have played a double role before, but never sextuplet roles.
