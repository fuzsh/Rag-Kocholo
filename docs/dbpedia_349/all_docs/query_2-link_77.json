        "text": "Shahid Kapoor is a versatile actor and in the past 17 years that he’s been an active part of the Hindi-film industry, we’ve seen him go from a chocolate boy in Ishq Vishk to embracing characters with negative shades in films like Udta Punjab, Haider and Kabir Singh.\n\nThe actor enjoys a loyal fan-base of people who admire his fitness, incredible dance moves and intense performances on screen. And if you’re a Shahid Kapoor fan too, you’re in for a treat as we’ve rounded up some of his best films that are available on two of the most popular OTT platforms in India– Netflix and Amazon.\n\n7 best Shahid Kapoor movies on Amazon Prime Video and Netflix\n\n1. Badmaash Company – Amazon Prime Video\n\nShahid plays a young boy, Karan, who along with a group of friends aims to get rich by whatever means possible. Anushka, the lead female in the film, also tags along as she aspires to be a supermodel but is in a similar financial scoop as the others. A bit of a ride in the past, this Shahid film has comedy, action, thrill and drama to keep you glued to the screen.\n\n2. Jab We Met – Amazon Prime Video\n\nA Shahid-Kareena classic. You can watch Jab We Met over and over again without getting bored. We’re sure you’re aware of the synopsis of this film already. And maybe have watched a few times too. But then the film is a pep talk in itself that can instantly lift your mood. Also, how can we forget Anshuman and his ‘Ganne Ke Khet’ saga.\n\n3. Vivah – Amazon Prime Video\n\nShahid Kapoor made his Bollywood debut alongside Amrita Rao in 2003 and the duo went on to do four films together, including Vivah. The film is a quintessential Sooraj Barjatya film with all the elements of family values and unconditional love for one another. Vivah is a good watch if you are craving some Shahid-Amrita chemistry.\n\n4. Kabir Singh – Netflix\n\nHis most recent project in this list, Shahid proved his acting versatility and prowess with his character in Kabir Singh. The film is a remake of Telugu film – Arjun Reddy – and chronicles the life of a surgeon who loses his focus as the love of his life is married to someone else. However, the reason to stream this one is purely Shahid Kapoor’s acting and brilliant character portrayal.\n\n5. Udta Punjab – Netflix\n\nUdta Punjab focuses on the drug problems in Punjab and how the menace is affecting so many teens in the state. Shahid Kapoor plays a successful music creator who goes by the name of Tommy Singh who is also a cocaine addict. The film looks at the issue of drug abuse and how it impacts people from different walks of life. A bit of a heavy watch, this one is also perfectly sprinkled with well-timed comedy scenes.\n\n6. Kaminey – Netflix\n\nIf one Shahid wasn’t enough for you, this one has two of him. Kaminey is the story of two identical twins Guddu and Charlie (played by Shahid Kapoor). Guddu and Charlie are leading separate lives until their worlds collide because of a guitar case full of cocaine. What happens next? You’ll find out when you watch the film.\n\n7. Haider – Netflix\n\nThe film is a modern-day adaptation of Shakespeare’s Hamlet mixed with Basharat Peer’s Curfewed Nights, which focuses on the Kashmir conflicts in 1995 and the civilian disappearances. This one could easily qualify as one of Shahid Kapoor’s best performances of his career. And him receiving both the Filmfare and the IIFA Award for his role in the film is a definite proof of it.\n\nBelow are the 7 best Shahid Kapoor movies to watch on Amazon Prime Video and Netflix this week"
