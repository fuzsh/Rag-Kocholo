        "text": "Director Narges Shahid Kalhor no longer wants to be called âShahidâ (martyr) as her surname and casts an actress as herself, who is supposed to set about changing the family name. All of a sudden, her bizarre great-grandfather appears. A man who was declared a martyr in Iran after his heroic death a hundred years ago and thus bequeathed to his descendants the honorific âShahidâ. He seeks to prevent his great-granddaughter from going through with her plan. The temporal layers blend into each other and a nerve-racking quarrel arises between the director and her actress. While the format of the film shifts between reality, fiction, theatre and musical, everyoneâs plans come to nought: The director founders on the obstacles of bureaucracy, the actress on the directorâs demands, the great-grandfather on the descendantâs stubborn will, and finally the film itself on its own premise. In the process, the film questions all kinds of radical ideologies â while not taking itself all too seriously either.\n\nSHAHID is a personal film about the balancing act between coming to terms with the past, with the present, and with oneâs own self.\n\nNarges Kalhorn photos Â© Leonie Huber"
