        "text": "\"I like the emotional scene between me and Vidya during pre-climax\" - Shahid Kapoor\n\nBy Bollywood Hungama News Network, July 29, 2008 - 09:50 IST\n\nHe is Bollywood's very own Prince Charming with the most pleasant smile, a smile that simply lightens and enlightens anybody's day! He is none other than Shahid Kapoor, whose ubber boyish charm in his debut film Ishq Vishk took everyone by storm. And this euphoria continues with his latest release Kismat Konnection, a film in which he stars with none other than Vidya Balan....a pair simply sweet enough to make sugar itself feel diabetic!\n\nAnd as we always say (and mean) that the benefits of being a Bollywood Hungama surfer is totally unparallel. And one of the benefits was an exclusive one-on-one with Shahid himself, courtesy Bollywood Hungama's Celebrity Chat. And for those who missed the bus, here's your ticket to nostalgia as we produce the excerpts of the chat with the chocolate boy Shahid Kapoor!\n\nShahid Kapoor: Hi all\n\nRiba: hey Shahid!!...how was the experience working with Aziz Mirza?\n\nShahid Kapoor: hey riba...Aziz uncle is by far the most senior director i have worked with and at the same time the youngest at heart...he gave me great freedom and I had good fun working with him.\n\nShahid Kapoor: hey riba...Aziz uncle is by far the most senior director I have worked with and at the same time the youngest at heart\n\nAjay: Hi Shahid, this is Ajay from Hong Kong. How are you?\n\nShahid Kapoor: hey ajay how are you doing man...been to Hong Kong once quite liked the place.\n\nRiba: so currently u r shooting for which movie?\n\nShahid Kapoor: right now I am shooting for a dance film, which is directed by Ken Ghosh, who gave me my first break - Ishq Vishk\n\nCoolshruti: hey, how was Vidya and is it true that u were dating Vidya?\n\nShahid Kapoor: hi shruti...vidya is a friend and a co-star...and dont believe everything you read.\n\nShahid Kapoor: hi shruti...vidya is a friend and a co-star...and dont believe everything you read.\n\nPriya64: how was the experience shooting in Canada for the movie??\n\nShahid Kapoor: priya...I really loved the place and I think Toronto is a beautiful city...it has a wonderful waterfront and the downtown is cool as well. Almost became home as we were there for nearly two months.\n\nFarrukh: hi Shahid...any memorable moments can u share with us from the movie.\n\nShahid Kapoor : farrukh....once we were shooting in a tram and the unit was so tired that we all went off to sleep and missed the location that we were supposed to get up in and then we had to run back almost a km with all the equipment.\n\nShahid Kapoor : farrukh....once we were shooting in a tram and the unit was so tired that we all went off to sleep and missed the location.\n\nVedansh: you look great with vidya better than Kareena for sure!!\n\nShahid Kapoor: thanks vedansh...really happy that you liked my pairing with vidya...thanks again.\n\nPriya64: how is Vidya Balan as a co-star.. Honestly I feel that there weren't much chemistry between the two of u... But still the movie was good...\n\nShahid Kapoor: hey Priya...first of all thanks for appreciating the film....I guess with each film the chemistry depends on the characters ....with Jab We Met there was a lot of scope for interaction....however, in this film, the film was driven by my character and the love story was not the centre of focus but thanks for your opinion...will keep it in mind for the future\n\nKartik: hey shahid...howz life been post kismat??\n\nShahid Kapoor : honestly kartik....I have been working 20 hours a day as I am shooting simultaneously but the fact that the film is doing well gives me all the reason to work harder....i am in quite a happy space right now.\n\nanu4sanju: Shahid Kapoor.. My friend is crazy for you!!! She wants me to tell you that she LOVES YOU!!! .. N she is waiting to watch Milenge Milenge?\n\nShahid Kapoor : pls tell her I Love You too...and thanks for all the support.\n\nKK : hey, I just wanted to say that I always thought you were overrated until Jab We Met (didn't really like you in Vivah either) but after Jab We Met and now KK. I respect you as an actor, though i just wish that the writers would have come up with something other than the old ppl angle.\n\nShahid Kapoor: hey KK...I really do appreciate your honesty and I am glad that I have been able to find a place in your heart as an actor....my endeavor is to do better work everyday and I hope that my future films will continue to live up to your expectations...thanks for your opinion on the script...will keep it in mind for the future.\n\nvashini13: hiii Shahid...how r u feeling after getting into A league actor category?\n\nShahid Kapoor : hey vashini...honestly I think I am very fortunate that with only 4 years of work behind me and that too at the age of 27....I am where I am...I don't believe in any lists or ratings ...my agenda is to do better work everyday.\n\nshilps101: Heyy Shahid!! Firstly I'd like to congratulate you on Kismat Konnection :) I've seen it twice in theaters already. I absolutely loved it! And it will be nice if u tell something about your future projects?\n\nShahid Kapoor : hey shilps...a big hug for going twice to see my film...I have 4 films coming up....a film with Vishal Bharadwaj called Kaminay ...expect the unexpected in that one.... a dance film with Ken Ghosh....a love story with Yash Raj and my father's film as a director.\n\nShahid Kapoor : hey shilps...a big hug for going twice to see my film...I have 4 films coming up....a film with Vishal Bhardwaj called Kaminay ...expect the unexpected in that one.... a dance film with Ken Ghosh....a love story with Yash Raj and my father's film as a director.\n\nKikki: Do you have a Lucky Charm, which you have always carry?\n\nShahid Kapoor: honestly I don't believe in lucky charms.\n\nShanaya: how u maintain urself?\n\nShahid Kapoor : hey Shanaya...honestly I have quite a strict regime...try and work out five times a week...get at least 6 hrs of sleep....i am a vegetarian and try and eat small meals every 3 hours.\n\nShanaya: R u really there??\n\nShahid Kapoor: yes i am really there Shanaya...i think Bollywood Hungama as a site are credible enough and you can trust them on that.\n\nShahid Kapoor: yes i am really there Shanaya...i think Bollywood Hungama as a site are credible enough and you can trust them on that.\n\nFarrukh: Shahid all the time you do any solo movie people start comparing you with big stars like Aamir or Shahrukh does that offense you?\n\nShahid Kapoor : not at all Farrukh....if anything it should offend them because i think i am still very very new...It is very difficult to be able to be successful as a solo actor and i consider myself very fortunate that i have been able to achieve it so soon.\n\nPriya64: when is ur movie with Kareena & Milenge Milenge releasing??\n\nShahid Kapoor : that's a good question...i keep asking that all the time as well priya....honestly i don't know when it is releasing but i am sure that it will release late this year or early next year.\n\nnur_kk: Which is yr fav song fr Kismat Konnection?\n\nShahid Kapoor: i like 3 songs....Aye Pappi, Bakhuda and is this love.\n\nShahid Kapoor: i like 3 songs....Aye Pappi, Bakhuda and is this love.\n\nnur_kk: Shahid a few wks ago, we've seen u in a new avatar...the dyed hair with a French beard, is it for yr new film Kaminay? If yes, tell us more abt the film.\n\nShahid Kapoor : yes it is for my new film Kaminay ....n ...honestly its too early to talk about it ....all i can say is that its going to be something very different from what you have seen of me and i hope that you like it.\n\nKaram_Kapur: hi shahid, you are my icon, what can your fans expect from you in the near future?\n\nShahid Kapoor : hey Karam...thanks so much...very honestly i am looking at building a long term relationship with my audience,....i feel that every time the audience enters the theatres...they have certain expectations form the film which are largely on the basis of the lead actor....i know people like me in love stories but at the same time i feel with only about 12 films behind me there is so much more that I can discover....i would want the audience to have the faith in my films to give them one watch....and hopefully not know what to expect...and i hope that i can surprise them in a good way and at the same time give them what they like.\n\nPriya64: what are ur fav holiday destinations?\n\nShahid Kapoor: i like Europe ...i love the combination of old architecture and landscape ...so any part of Europe is good for me.\n\nKartik: who is your favorite actor and director??\n\nShahid Kapoor: kartik my fav actor is my father and as for directors i really admire Hitchcock, copola, Satyajit Ray, James Cameron ...in India i like Raju Hirani , Rakeysh Mehra, Aamir Khan, and Shimit Amin.\n\nArjun.Kapoor: What according to you is the unique selling point of Kismat Konnection?\n\nShahid Kapoor: Arjun i think its got very good music...its a young, fun film which is quite entertaining...\n\nPriya64: how do u rate ur father..?\n\nShahid Kapoor: i don't think i can rate him Priya...he is in a league of his own...i just feel fortunate to be his son and to learn from his brilliant performances\n\nnur_kk: What is yr next release? Is it going to be Paatshala or Milenge Milenge?\n\nShahid Kapoor : honestly i am not sure which is going to be my next release....However in Paathshala i have a special appearance and i have only shot for it for 7 days....just thought you guys should know abt it so you don't expect more of me in the film.\n\nRiddhi: what do you feel when people talk about the resemblance of u to SRK?\n\nShahid Kapoor: riddhi..honestly i take it as a compliment but at the same time i believe firmly that i have to find a place for myself and my endeavor is to do that...also i don't take it too seriously becos SRK is 15 years my senior and may be if people ask me this after 15 years hence...i would take it seriously.\n\nShahid Kapoor: SRK is 15 years my senior and may be if people ask me this after 15 years hence...i would take it seriously.\n\nRiddhi: if u r not an actor then what would you have been?\n\nShahid Kapoor: i would have been a good for nothing :)\n\nShraddha: u won't believe i have watched Jab We Met for more than 76 times. So when did u and Kareena coming together on screen?\n\nShahid Kapoor : first of all Shraddha...a minute long hug for seeing my film so many times....as of now there seems to be nothing on the cards but if something does come up am sure you guys will get to know.\n\nUrsula Poland: Hi Shahid, I'm from POLAND, we love you here :)\n\nShahid Kapoor : hey Ursula....great to know that i have people who see my films all the way in Poland....will make sure every film of mine releases there.\n\nanu4sanju: what do you have to say about your new movie Paatshala where u play teacher ya what?\n\nShahid Kapoor : well yes its a friend's film anu...and i have a special appearance in the film and yes i do play a teacher...it was quite fun actually\n\nArjun.Kapoor: Any scenes from Kismat Konnection, which are memorable to you?\n\nShahid Kapoor : Arjun...i like the emotional scene between me and vidya pre-climax and also all the comic scenes with me and vishal were good fun\n\nShahid Kapoor : Arjun...i like the emotional scene between me and vidya pre-climax and also all the comic scenes with me and vishal were good fun\n\nArjun.Kapoor: Were you surprised when you first heard that Vidya Balan was going to be paired opposite you?\n\nShahid Kapoor : yes Arjun...people did have a different perception of her as she has always done roles like Parineeta but Aziz uncle was really convinced and I had full faith in his conviction\n\nnitesh_shahani: When r ur planning to get engaged?\n\nShahid Kapoor: nitesh yaar...pehle ladki toh dhoondho lo\n\nZafar: shahid i m damn sure u r the next Bollywood king after Shahrukh khan.\n\nShahid Kapoor: thanks zafar...hope that i can live up to your expectations\n\nPriya64: what's ur fav song??
