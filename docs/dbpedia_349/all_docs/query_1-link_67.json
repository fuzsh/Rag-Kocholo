Eliot, Wallace Stevens, Marianne Moore, Langston Hughes, H.D., Hart Crane, and others. We’ll be particularly interested in the interplay between ideas and things, to borrow a phrase from Williams, and initially discuss poems from Dickinson and Whitman to develop a framework for the poets that follow them. This course will especially benefit students preparing for comprehensive exams, though all are welcome. Students will submit shorter response papers each week and a longer seminar paper at the end of the term.\n\nFall 2024\n\nENG 611\n\nSubterranean Homesick Blues: Studies in Contemporary Literature\n\nDr. Monika Gehlawat\n\nM 2:30 - 5:15PM\n\n** fulfills American post-1865 requirement\n\nThis seminar will begin with a periodizing framework that situates 20th century modernism in relation to the late modernism of the postwar period, followed by high postmodernism, and the various developments of contemporary literature leading up to the post-millennial period. We will consider literature in relation to the evolving and correspondent art movements of the postwar period, including Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, Minimalism, and other genres like earthworks and performance art. Among others, we will read Paul Bowles, Frank O’Hara, Ann Beattie, Don DeLillo, Toni Morrison, Robert Creeley, Christopher Isherwood, Grace Paley, Elena Ferrante, Jenny Offill, and Teju Cole.\n\nENG 626\n\nReadings in Poetry\n\nDr. Michael Aderibigbe\n\nW 6:00 - 9:00PM\n\n** fulfills creative writing elective requirement, only open to CW students\n\nIn ENG 626, students will study contemporary poetry books. We will specifically focus on how these texts utilize different elements of poetry. Over the semester, students will write one paper and brief weekly responses. Students will also write original poems that employ poetic elements with intentionality. Some of the writers we will read include Robert Bly, Anne Sexton, Wanda Coleman, Terrance Hayes, Natasha Trethewey, Kwame Dawes, Kimiko Hahn, Jericho Brown, Paul Muldoon, and Agha Shahid Ali.\n\nENG 640\n\nCritical Reading and Methods\n\nDr. Alexandra Valint\n\nTH 2:30 - 5:15PM\n\n** required for MA in lit, PhD in lit, PhD in CW\n\nThis course prepares you to do literary analysis and research at the graduate level. Our focus will be on learning and practicing various ways of approaching texts such as close attention to language and form; historical, biographical, and publishing contexts; and a range of theoretical lenses. We will also practice how to read, respond to, and build on critical scholarship about literature. The major assignment is an original, research-driven, and theoretically informed essay on one of the course’s central texts.\n\nENG 644\n\nThe Life of the Author--New Biographical Criticism and Theory\n\nDr. Eric Tribunella\n\nTH 2:30 - 5:15PM\n\n** fulfills theory requirement\n\nBritish author Beverley Nichols wrote in 1920 that “nowadays fiction is becoming more and more biography, with the result that biography is to-day the only province of literature where we can be quite certain that we are soaring in the realms of pure imagination.” The New Critics of the mid-twentieth century rejected the practice of reading literature through and for the biography of its author, and postmodern theorists went a step further by pronouncing the death of the author. However, as historicist approaches have become increasingly dominant in the post-theory era, “New Biographical Criticism” has been offered as a more theoretically informed approach to using biographical contexts to analyze literary texts, and the lives of authors have been especially important in feminist, queer, and African American literary criticism. In this course, we will review the theoretical debates surrounding the role of author biography in literary analysis and read several biographies in order to practice New Biographical Criticism as an historicist approach to literature. Readings will include essays by Wimsatt & Beardsley, Barthes, and Foucault and selections from Michael Lackey’s Biographical Fiction: A Reader, George Hoffmann’s The New Biographical Criticism, and William Epstein’s Contesting the Subject: Essays in the Postmodern Theory and Practice of Biography and Biographical Criticism.\n\nENG 671\n\nStudies in American Literature II: The South and Film\n\nDr. Kate Cochran\n\nM 6:00 - 9:00PM\n\n** fulfills American post-1865 requirement\n\n“Nowadays when a person lives somewhere, in a neighborhood, the place is not certified for him. More than likely he will live there sadly and the emptiness which is inside him will expand until it evacuates the entire neighborhood. But if he sees a movie which shows his very neighborhood, it will become possible for him to live, for a time at least, as a person who is Somewhere and not Anywhere.”\n\n–Walker Percy’s The Moviegoer (1961)\n\nThis course is designed to provide insight into how the South has been portrayed in American film and literature in the 20th and 21st centuries, from one of its first filmic appearances in The Birth of a Nation to the recent Minari, and its correspondence in fiction, from Robert Penn Warren’s All the King’s Men to Karen Russell’s Swamplandia!. We will be supplementing our viewing and discussions of primary movies and literature with a variety of clips from other films, critical articles, and brief, focused lectures. The course is arranged by topic, rather than chronologically, and examines some of the major tropes in movies about the South. In addition to completing readings and viewing films, students will be expected to maintain a reading journal, participate in class discussion, and craft a well-researched seminar essay.\n\nENG 690\n\nTheory of Teaching Composition\n\nInstructor TBA\n\nM/W 11:00 - 12:15AM\n\n** required for new instructors\n\nHouse of Broken Angels (2018), Luis Alberto Urrea\n\nPostcolonial Love Poem (2020), Natalie Diaz\n\nFiebre Tropical (2020), Julián Delgado Lopera\n\nOf Women and Salt: A Novel (2021), Gabriela Garcia\n\nStepmotherland: Poems (2022), Darrel Alejandro Holnes\n\nPlantains and Our Becoming: Poems (2023), Melania Luis Marte\n\nBlackouts (2023), Justin Torres"
