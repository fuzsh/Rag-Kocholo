Synopsis

SHAHID is a political drama and a desperate comedy at the same time. It is about historical heroes, today's criminals and how modern women deal with them. A story by and about migrants in Germany and from afar. SHAHID is a personal film that questions all kinds of radical ideologies – and doesn't always take itself too seriously.
