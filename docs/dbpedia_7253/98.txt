WARNING! THIS PAGE CONTAINS SPOILERS!

Pistols

SIG P210

Jack Carter (Michael Caine) carries a SIG P210 as his sidearm, using it mostly during the gunfight on the ferry.

Walther PP

Con McCarty (George Sewell) appears to pull a Walther PP. Jack Carter (Michael Caine) takes the pistol from him.

Shotguns

12 Gauge Double Barreled Shotgun

Jack Carter (Michael Caine) finds a 12 Gauge Double Barreled Shotgun in his dead brother's house, and decides to take it. What's interesting is that, despite the fact he's extensively seen with the shotgun, he does not fire it in the film. In the book that inspired the film, Jack Returns Home, the shotgun is meant to symbolise Jack's memories of going hunting with his brother, but in the film this meaning is lost.

Remington Model 31

Peter (Tony Beckley) uses what appears to be a Remington Model 31 shotgun with a shortened barrel and buttstock during the gunfight with Carter on the ferry.

Ithaca 37

Numerous posters for the film feature Carter with an Ithaca 37 shotgun with a shortened barrel and modified buttstock, but these images were taken from publicity photos and Jack never actually uses the shotgun in the film.

Rifles

Remington Model 700
