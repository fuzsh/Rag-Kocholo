Looks magnificent. Fantastic film and My Cocaine is breath-taking.\n\nThe ADR'd/looped audio is very strange (it's there in the original UK DVD with commentary but not the default audio) and a bit silly especially as they've altered the lines quite a bit too. Hodges makes mention of this on the Blu-ray and says it's been 'corrected on the other track' -a reference to the DVD obviously so the Blu-ray's just a copy/paste of the DVD commentary.\n\nI see the Blu-ray also has the music-only track missing.\n\nA lazy cheap release but I'm happy with it as it looks so great.\n\nKarlin\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nJoined\n\nDec 10, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n5,555\n\nReaction score\n\n1,195\n\nPoints\n\n1,413\n\nMay 16, 2014\n\n#37\n\nDodgy dubbing.\n\nJust had this reply from Warner:\n\nA new version of 'Get Carter' is going to be issued, but this may take some time.\n\nCould you please provide me with your address in the meantime?\n\nThank you\n\nKind regards,\n\nDianne\n\nThat's from Blu-ray.com\n\nGoing to email them [email protected] hopefully they'll swap out my US disc if not I'll be on to Amazon.com\n\nKarlin\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nJoined\n\nDec 10, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n5,555\n\nReaction score\n\n1,195\n\nPoints\n\n1,413\n\nMay 30, 2014\n\n#38\n\nHeard back from WB/Tehnicolor:\n\nNew discs will be available mid June, so we are going to be adopting a replacement programme.
