        "text": "In March of 1971, MGM released Mike Hodges’s unrelenting neo-noir masterpiece, Get Carter, to conflicted expressions of formal appreciation and moral revulsion. Variety, for example praised the ‘rare artistry, restraint, and clarity’ of Hodges’s cinematic vision, but found the plot, adapted from Ted Lewis’s underappreciated novel, Jack’s Return Home, ‘brutal, sordid, and gamy.’ Jack Carter’s a London villain, after all. Picture snooker clubs, half-break tailoring, Bow Bells diphthongs. Pub killings and cleanups in the Kray’s East End. It’s Jack Carter’s Newcastle homecoming, though, that drives the film’s cold, methodical violence and enables Hodges’s cinéma verité record of the industrial North. This month, the 50th anniversary of Get Carter’s release invites us to revisit both of Jack Carter’s hard Norths – Hodges’s and Lewis’s – as well as Carter, himself, the rotten ‘knight in shining armor’ whose perspective shows us a poeticized Britain ‘so calculatedly cool and soulless and nastily erotic that it seems to belong to a new genre of virtuoso viciousness.’\n\nUnited Artists, the film’s American distributor, didn’t get Get Carter. It languished at drive-ins alongside the Sinatra clunker, Dirty Dingus Magee. MGM, meanwhile, produced a rival blaxploitation remake called Hit Man. It was an inauspicious debut for a film that BFI would eventually rank 16th among the 100 best British films of all time. It ought to have been a hit. It has a good potboiler plot, sexy stuff. Jack comes home for his brother’s funeral, uncovers a ring of pornographers involved with his death, and hunts them down with Liam Neeson determination. Richard Burton, whose 1971 neo-noir film, Villain, also fizzled in the States, speculated that East End accents were ‘difficult for Yanks to follow,’ but ‘Yanks’ regularly embraced the chic, hedonistic aesthetic of ‘swinging London’ in films like Alfie, a star turn for Caine that typecast him as the ‘cockney Errol Flynn.’ Perhaps Get Carter pitched the wrong Britain for the States.\n\nAs Dylan Jones remarks, 1960s London ‘had a personality that was vibrant, brash, moody, young, and transient,’ a ‘laboratory for the emerging youth-oriented scene.’ But the ‘swinging London’ milieu was, at its core, an affluent West End phenomenon. It stood to reason that the ‘Swinging Sixties’ translated well as prepackaged Britishness for an American milieu characterized by middle-class youth in revolt against middle-class parents. On the other hand, Get Carter must have seemed as alien to middle-class American sensibilities in 1971 as it does to The Guardian’s Michael Hann 50 years out – something ‘like reading accounts of the first westerners to cross the Gobi desert: did this world ever exist, and in such recent times?’\n\nJack, of course, knows that it did and does. Hodges and Lewis both introduce him to us going home on the northbound train. In the film, he’s reading a Raymond Chandler paperback while Hodges’s script points out what’s no surprise to Jack: ‘in the distance, the stacks of a lonely power station belch a continuous stream of brown smoke,’ a ‘massive iron bridge crossing a river,’ a ‘chemical factory, brightly lit,’ and then the ‘outskirts of a city.’ To the grand tradition of British poets, this would have seemed like a hellish satire of pastoral values that cast London against the skylark-fielding peaceable kingdoms of Lake Poets and Shropshire lads. In Romantic terms, it’s Blake’s factory-nightmare Inferno where the ‘Chimney-sweepers cry’ and ‘every blackning Church appalls.’ Closer to Jack’s decade, it’s Philip Larkin with true grit: the ‘provincial town, / the slums, the canal, the churches ornate and mad / in the evening sun.’ Philip Larkin, after all, is just a William Blake who’s lost his mania.\n\nFor Jack Carter, though, who finds his mania – or recovers it – up North, this industrial, provincial landscape is true pastoral. If he’s Chandler’s reader in Get Carter, he’s Chandler’s lyric narrator, Philip Marlowe, in Jack’s Return Home. In Lewis’s novel, Jack’s inner monologue gives us the northbound landscape, the ‘half-dozen steelworks stretching to the rim’ of the hills as ‘soft reds pulsing on the insides of melting shops’ and ‘the structures of the works against the collective glow, all of it looking like the Disney version of the Dawn of Creation.’ Read that again and then close your eyes and listen to Caine talk in the film. Hodges’s script gives a clean transcription of Lewis’s dialogue. Jack’s a hard man, given to short punches of speech, all ‘pint of bitter,’ but he’s not a caricature. The source material begins with Jack’s impressionistic response to the North, good as any poet’s, because it’s about to plunge his consciousness into memories. I’d draw a through-line to Wordsworth’s ‘Tintern Abbey,’ but it’s more than that with Jack. The North’s landscape is embodied memory, and Jack’s selfsame with the landscape.\n\n‘In English movies,’ Michael Caine recalled, ‘gangsters were either funny or stupid. I wanted to show that they’re neither.’ In Hodges’s film, we don’t get Jack’s psychological lyricism, so we learn about him through little intimations, turns of phrase, qualifications of throwaway banter. He’ll take his bitter ‘in a thin glass.’ It’s things like this that prepare us for his heartbreak and fury when he recognizes his niece – is she in fact his daughter? – in a porno reel. But it’s the social logic of the landscape that makes his Jacobean revenge killings comprehensible. You couldn’t set Get Carter in West End, London. I suppose you could, but Jack’s rage would seem purely psychopathic, not inevitable – and certainly not a force of nature.\n\nIn Lewis’s novel, Jack goes back to an unnamed industrial town, a purely poeticized landscape. It contrasts with a Romantic London he calls ‘the smoke.’ Hodges exchanged Jack’s neverland for Newcastle because, location-scouting, he saw Lewis’s landscape in the real world, among real buildings and real faces that made their way into the film. Newcastle, half what’s been and half where it still is in 1971, fit Jack like a glove. In terms of the film’s plunge into stark inevitabilities, it’s prophetic.\n\nJack Carter’s homecoming is time travel as much as train travel, not just in a personal sense, but for ‘Swinging Sixties’ Britishness as well. It’s a violent lobotomy rather than a laboratory for London’s ‘youth-oriented scene.’ Hodges’s externalization of Jack’s inner life through slice-of-life Newcastle scenes pulls Alfie into the ‘kitchen sink realism’ of a decade earlier, the postwar malaise of the 1950s that gave rise to the much-ballyhooed ‘Angry Young Men’ of the cultural scene. Works like A Taste of Honey, It Always Rains on Sunday, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, and John Osborne’s groundbreaking Look Back in Anger expressed the harsh frictions of working-class life apart from the metropolitan center, and often raw class resentment at the fact that, as Look Back in Anger’s Jimmy puts it, ‘the wrong people go hungry, the wrong people be loved, the wrong people dying.’\n\nThat could be the mantra of Get Carter, but it’d be the sound that industrial machines clank out over and over like the factory musical sequences in Bjork’s Dancer in the Dark. In my mind, I keep going back to the idea of Jack Carter as a ‘force of nature.’ A ‘force of nature’ like what? Like John Wayne’s blood-mad, vengeful Ethan Edwards in The Searchers? No, that’s not right. John Ford’s Monument Valley landscapes reveal the individual in poetic isolation. Get Carter’s harrowing finale, which involves both Carter’s death and that of Eric Paice, his quarry, is depicted at every step through interactions with coal slag shoreline. The sea swallows Jack’s rifle at the end. In Lewis’s novel, Jack’s still alive, bleeding out into the sea, listening to silence ‘until there is nothing, nothing at all.’ It’s the end of Larkin’s poem, ‘High Windows,’ the awareness of ‘the deep blue air, that shows / nothing, and is nowhere, and is endless.’ Larkin’s safe behind his window, though, because his speaker doesn’t really belong anywhere. Jack Carter, on the other hand, returns to the elemental landscape that made him."
