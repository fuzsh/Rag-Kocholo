Okja (2017)\n\nKorean Title: 옥자\n\nRating: 7.9 | Run time: 2h | Genre: Drama, Adventure\n\nMija is the devoted caretaker and best friend of Okja, a gentle giant pig creature. When her beloved pet is taken to America for sinister purposes, Mija strives to rescue her with the help of an animal rights group.\n\nThis movie is directed by acclaimed director Bong Joon-ho and the cast features plenty of American celebrities starring as both allies and villains, including Tilda Swinton, Steven Yeun and Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\nIf you’re an animal lover, this film can be a real tearjerker, so be warned!\n\n2. Night in Paradise (2020)\n\nKorean Title: 낙원의 밤\n\nRating: 6.9 | Run time: 2h 11m | Genre: Crime, Drama\n\nAfter successfully enacting revenge for the murder of his family members, an ex-gangster flees to alluring Jeju Island.\n\nThere, he meets a young jaded woman with a loose connection to life. They both quickly realize that there’s no peace to be found for either of them.\n\nDon’t trust the title. There’s hardly anything paradisiac about this gritty film. If you’re up for a very grim story told with great cinematography and poeticism, then this may be the movie for you.\n\n3. Tune in for Love (2019)\n\nKorean Title: 유열의 음악앨범\n\nRating: 7.3 | Run time: 2h 2m | Genre: Romance, Drama\n\nStudent Mi-soo is initially wary when delinquent Hyun-woo enters her sister’s bakery. But over time, they develop feelings for each other. When the two are separated, they struggle to reconnect as the years pass.\n\nThe film takes place in the 1990s, and so it caters a lot to (mostly Korean) nostalgia, with a strong emphasis on radio music.\n\nThe romance is simple, yearning and slow-burning, so you can carefully follow the characters on their long and aching trip.\n\n4. Time to Hunt (2020)\n\nKorean Title: 사냥의 시간\n\nRating: 6.4 | Run time: 2h 15m | Genre: Crime, Thriller\n\nSick of their miserable circumstances, a group of young criminals plot a big heist to boost their fortunes.\n\nHowever, their success attracts the hungry gaze of a killer. Suddenly, the thieves find themselves the prey in a ruthless hunt.\n\nThe dark plot is unforgiving to its protagonists, and you’ll get a huge dose of adrenaline from the impressive action choreography. There’s truly no rest for the wicked.\n\n5. Space Sweepers (2021)\n\nKorean Title: 승리호\n\nRating: 6.8 | Run time: 2h 16m | Genre: Sci-fi, Action\n\nIt’s the year 2092 and space has become familiar territory, especially for one space junk collection crew.\n\nWhen they stumble upon a child robot who is far deadlier than she appears, the tattered stability of their lives is swept away as if consumed by a black hole.\n\nBesides the impressive CGI effects, the rugged characters and their dynamics are particularly fun to follow.\n\n6. Seoul Vibe (2022)\n\nKorean Title: 서울대작전\n\nRating: 6.4 | Run time: 2h 20m | Genre: Action, Comedy\n\nIt’s 1988. The Seoul Olympics are revving up, and naturally, the whole country is getting excited. But things get particularly heated for a group of racers when they become involved with illicit money.\n\nA good word that sums up this film is “wild.” It might especially be a good time for you “Fast and Furious” fans.\n\nIt has a dynamic combination of bright colors, loud characters, screeching engines and crazy cash chases, all amidst a nostalgic and flashy 80s backdrop.\n\n7. Love and Leashes (2022)\n\nKorean Title: 모럴센스\n\nRating: 7.6 | Run time: 1h 58m | Genre: Romance, Comedy\n\nAfter a young woman discovers her fellow co-worker’s fascination with BDSM, the two enter a consensual relationship based on dominance and submission.\n\nThis popular film is based on a webtoon called “Moral Sense.” Though the film is technically rated R, there aren’t any overly explicit scenes in the film (or nudity, for that matter).\n\nThe lens through which the topic of BDSM is observed is light-hearted and, in many ways, quite sincere. It’s plenty fun to observe the characters’ endearing yet perplexing relationship.\n\nWant to watch more movies about entrancing love and shattering heartbreak? Check out these 15 Korean romance movies:\n\n8. 20th Century Girl (2022)\n\nKorean Title: 20세기 소녀\n\nRating: 8.0 | Run time: 1h 59m | Genre: Drama, Romance\n\nIn 1999, 17-year-old high school girl Bo-ra agrees to keep close tabs on Hyun-jin, a classmate who her best friend has a huge crush on.\n\nBo-ra agrees to find out everything she can about him. But as Bo-ra continues to spend her days around Hyun-jin, she fears she’s starting to fall in love with him herself.\n\n9. The Call (2020)\n\nKorean Title: 콜\n\nRating: 8.6 | Run time: 1h 52m | Genre: Suspense, Psychological thriller\n\nWhile visiting her mother in the year 2019, Seo-yeon receives a strange call from someone who claims she’s being tortured. The caller is connecting to her from the year 1999, twenty years in the past.\n\n“The Call” is based on the 2011 film “The Caller,” but it brings its own uniquely disturbing spin on the main plotline.\n\nGet ready for time travel, altered fates and unpleasant twists. You probably won’t get a restful night of sleep after giving this film a watch.\n\n10. Yaksha: Ruthless Operations (2022)\n\nKorean Title: 야차\n\nRating: 6.4 | Run time: 2h 5m | Genre: Crime, Thriller, Action\n\nDetermined to regain his lost honor, prosecutor Ji-hoon investigates an infamous China-based black ops team led by a brutal but efficient man known as Yaksha.\n\nBut espionage becomes a battle amidst an atmosphere rife with tension and violence.\n\nAction is the keyword for “Yaksha”, and it doesn’t hold back from the first minute. There are plenty of things constantly in motion, from flying fists to shifting moral boundaries… so strap yourselves in.\n\n11. The Pirates: The Last Royal Treasure (2022)\n\nKorean Title: 해적: 도깨비 깃발\n\nRating: 6.4 | Run time: 2h 5m | Genre: Adventure, Comedy\n\nIn Joseon-era Korea, a group of rough-and-tumble pirates search for an illustrious royal-certified treasure. Along the way, they must stay one step ahead of dogged pursuers and deal with typical seafaring shenanigans.\n\nThere’s nothing to take seriously in this movie. It’s just a great watch if you want some good laughs at the expense of a motley crew. This film is actually a sequel to a 2014 film, and both are quite popular in mainland Korea.\n\n12. #Alive (2020)\n\nKorean Title: #살아있다\n\nRating: 7.6 | Run time: 1h 39m | Genre: Horror, Action\n\nA gamer’s life is toppled when a zombie outbreak occurs in his city. Trapped in his apartment, the man must figure out how to survive with his limited physical and digital resources, all the while constantly seeking outside help.\n\n“#Alive” is another addition to the hungry pack of zombie flicks that have become popular in recent Korean media. Its young and desperate but a scrappy protagonist caught unawares in his own home might feel relatable to many of us.\n\n13. My Name Is Loh Kiwan (2024)\n\nKorean Title: 로기완\n\nRating: 7.2 | Run time: 2h 11m | Genre: Drama, Romance\n\nKiwan flees North Korea and escapes to Belgium for refuge. The film follows his journey, and while on it, he meets a troubled woman named Marie.\n\nBut while Kiwan is looking to start a new life, Marie has lost the will to live hers. Like Kiwan, Marie is also a North Korean defector. But she’s gained something Kiwan is struggling to obtain—Belgian citizenship.\n\n14. Unlocked (2023)\n\nKorean Title: 스마트폰을 떨어뜨렸을 뿐인데\n\nRating: 6.6 | Run time: 1h 57m | Genre: Thriller, Suspense\n\nAn office worker named Lee Na-Mi lives a normal and peaceful life, until one fateful day when she loses her cell phone. A man named Jun-Yeong finds her phone and then starts using it to stalk Na-Mi.\n\nWhen a murder is reported, detective Woo Ji-Man begins investigating the case. And sure enough, all clues seem to point to Jun-Yeong and Na-Mi’s smartphone.\n\n15. Kill Boksoon (2023)\n\nKorean Title: 길복순\n\nRating: 7.3 | Run time: 2h 17m | Genre: Action, Thriller\n\nGil Boksoon’s day job is being a professional assassin, and killing is easy for her. However, she’s also a single mom to her daughter Gil Jae-yeong and parenting is much more difficult than carrying out assassinations.\n\nJae-yeong doesn’t know about her mom’s job as a killer and isn’t very close to her. She has her own secrets, the biggest being her girlfriend at school.\n\nThings get messy when Boksoon breaks one of the three cardinal rules of assassins.\n\n16. Svaha: The Sixth Finger (2019)\n\nKorean Title: 사바하\n\nRating: 6.8 | Run time: 2h 2m | Genre: Horror, Mystery\n\nBeing a keen investigator of suspect religious groups, Pastor Park sets his eyes on the bizarre “Deer Mount” cult. The group’s reputation also catches the attention of a police captain, who is investigating a mysterious murder.\n\nIt’s always a fun time when mystic cults stir up supernatural trouble that no one has the time or sanity to deal with! The religious backdrop of the horror makes things extra creepy and sinister.\n\nBut this isn’t a mindlessly scary ride—there are a lot of thought-provoking themes and questions that the movie encourages you to mull over.\n\n17. Kingdom: Ashin of the North (2021)\n\nKorean Title: 킹덤: 아신전\n\nRating: 6.9 | Run time: 1h 32m | Genre: Historical drama, Thriller, Horror\n\nAfter losing her entire tribe, a young woman sets off on a bloody path of vengeance. However, her quest leads to circumstances that go beyond what a personal grudge should entail.\n\n“Ashin of the North” is actually a special character-focused spin-off of the very popular “Kingdom” series. You should also definitely watch the series, though you don’t have to in order to understand this movie.\n\nJust like the main series, expect zombie action and tragedy abound.\n\n18. The 8th Night (2021)\n\nKorean Title: 제8일의 밤\n\nRating: 5.8 | Run time: 1h 55m | Genre: Horror, Mystery\n\nWith the aid of a monk-in-training, a former exorcist must once again take up spiritual arms to fight against an awakened ancient evil that is eager to disrupt human lives.\n\nLike “Svaha: The Sixth Finger,” “The 8th Night” also ups the horror game by imbuing creepy religious themes into its scares. This film successfully creates a mood thick with unease, suspense and intrigue.\n\n19. Forgotten (2017)\n\nKorean Title: 기억의 밤\n\nRating: 7.8 | Run time: 1h 49m | Genre: Psychological thriller, Mystery\n\n“Forgotten” is a dark roller coaster: full of twists and turns amidst an unsettling and obscured backdrop. Jin-seok witnesses his older brother, Yoo-seok, being abducted right before his eyes.\n\nIt’s even more startling when, after 19 days, his brother abruptly returns with a brand-new personality and attitude. What exactly happened to make him suddenly act like a completely different person?\n\nIf you’d like to descend down a mystery rabbit hole with some satisfying bits of action and horror, then “Forgotten” will get you there.\n\n20. The Fortress (2017)\n\nKorean Title: 남한산성\n\nRating: 6.6 | Run time: 2h 20m | Genre: Historical drama, War\n\nIn 1636, the Chinese Qing dynasty armies invades Korea. Alongside his trusted retainers, King Injo of the Joseon dynasty flees to a fortress in the mountains.\n\nThere, he and his counsel struggle to decide how best to face the incoming enemy threat while also combating natural hardships. The events of the film are based on true historical events, which makes it that much more compelling.\n\nAlthough its plot takes place hundreds of years before most modern war movies, “The Fortress” still encapsulates the grim and desperate feeling that comes from having to balance pride and honor with basic survival.\n\n21. The Drug King (2018)\n\nKorean Title: 마약왕\n\nRating: 6.7 | Run time: 2h 19m | Genre: Crime, Drama\n\nAfter a lowly smuggler is released from his prison sentence, he treads into the dangerous world of drug trafficking. His ambitions and notoriety soon skyrocket as he ascends to take up the crown of a true drug king.\n\nThe story is based on real-life events, and the protagonist is played by the incredibly versatile Song Kang-ho of “Parasite” fame.\n\nWhile the plot of this movie is definitely not kid-friendly, there are plenty of oddly humorous moments.\n\n22. Psychokinesis (2018)\n\nKorean Title: 염력\n\nRating: 7.0 | Run time: 1h 41m | Genre: Action, Adventure, Comedy\n\nSecurity guard Suk-hun’s life flips upside-down after a drink of sullied water grants him telekinetic powers. And he’s quick to find a great purpose for his new gift: to help out his daughter and her fried chicken business.\n\nClaimed as the first Korean superhero film, “Psychokinesis” takes a slightly different spin with its own champion.\n\nThe plot is filled with excitement, goofs and heartfelt moments. It’s fun watching the protagonist balance very human priorities with the (somewhat literal) gravity of his powers.\n\n23. Carter (2022)\n\nKorean Title: 카터\n\nRating: 4.2 | Run time: 2h 12m | Genre: Action\n\nA man wakes up with no memories. He doesn’t have even a hint of recollection of who he is.\n\nAll he knows, based on a voice in his ear, is that he’s to be called “Carter” and he must immediately undergo a deadly mission. How’s that for a rude wake-up?\n\n“Carter” might ring a few bells for you “Jason Bourne” fans. As always, a character with no memories is always a recipe for chaos and plot twists that will keep you on your toes.\n\n24. Sweet & Sour (2021)\n\nKorean Title: 새콤달콤\n\nRating: 4.3 | Run time: 1h 41m | Genre: Drama, Romance\n\nJang-hyeok and Da-eun are a young couple who met under sweet and genuine circumstances.\n\nBut time passes, and issues in their relationship are amplified when Jang-hyeok takes up a potentially lucrative job in a new location.\n\n“Sweet & Sour” is a simple film that addresses a complicated topic: modern romance and the struggle for love to survive the obstacles of work life and dwindling connections.\n\nIf you’re a Korean language learner looking for added support while you watch Korean movies, you might be interested in FluentU.\n\nFluentU takes authentic videos—like music videos, movie trailers, news and inspiring talks—and turns them into personalized language learning lessons.\n\nYou can try FluentU for free for 2 weeks.
