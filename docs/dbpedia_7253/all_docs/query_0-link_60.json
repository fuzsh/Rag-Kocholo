        "text": "Excess business loss limitation. If you are a noncorporate taxpayer and have allowable business losses after taking into account first the at-risk limitations and then the passive loss limitations (Form 8582), your losses may be subject to the excess business loss limitation. After taking into account all the other loss limitations, complete Form 461, Limitation on Business Losses, to figure the amount of your excess business loss. See Form 461 and its instructions for details on the excess business loss limitation.\n\nCommercial revitalization deduction (CRD). The 120-month deduction period for rental real estate placed in service by December 31, 2009, has expired. See Form 8582 and its instructions for reporting requirements for unused CRDs.\n\nChanges in rules on grouping and definition of real property trade or business. T.D. 9943 revised certain rules in the Regulations under section 469.\n\nApplicable date. The new rules apply to tax years beginning on or after March 22, 2021, but you may chose to adopt these rules earlier. See Regulations section 1.469-11(a)(1) and (4) for additional information on applicability dates and early adoption. If you are a calendar year taxpayer, the new provision applies to you beginning in calendar year 2022.\n\nGrouping rules. T.D. 9943 added Regulations section 1.469-4(d)(6), which prohibits grouping of trading activities described in Temporary Regulations section 1.469-1T(e)(6) subject to section 163(d)(5)(A)(ii) involving a non-passive trade or business in which the taxpayer does not materially participate with any other activity or activities including other trading activities. See Regulations section 1.469-4(d)(6) for more details.\n\nDefinition of real property trade or business. T.D. 9905 and 9943 expanded Regulations section 1.469-9(b)(2)(i) to define several terms used in determining whether a trade or business is a real property trade or business for purposes of section 469(c)(7)(C). T.D. 9905 added Regulations sections 1.469-9(b)(2)(ii)(H) and (I) defining real property operations and real property management. T.D. 9943 added Regulations sections 1.469-9(b)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) defining real property development and real property redevelopment.\n\nRegrouping due to Net Investment Income Tax. You may be able to regroup your activities if you’re subject to the Net Investment Income Tax. See Regrouping Due to Net Investment Income Tax under Grouping Your Activities, later, for more information.\n\nAt-risk amounts. The following rules apply to amounts borrowed after May 3, 2004.\n\nYou must file Form 6198, At-Risk Limitations, if you’re engaged in an activity included in (6) under Activities Covered by the At-Risk Rules and you have borrowed certain amounts described in Certain borrowed amounts excluded under At-Risk Amounts in this publication.\n\nYou may be considered at risk for certain amounts described in Certain borrowed amounts excluded under At-Risk Amounts secured by real property used in the activity of holding real property (other than mineral property) that, if nonrecourse, would be qualified nonrecourse financing.\n\nPhotographs of missing children. The Internal Revenue Service is a proud partner with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children® (NCMEC). Photographs of missing children selected by the Center may appear in this publication on pages that would otherwise be blank. You can help bring these children home by looking at the photographs and calling 800-THE-LOST (800-843-5678) if you recognize a child.\n\nPassive Activity Limits\n\nWho Must Use These Rules?\n\nThe passive activity rules apply to:\n\nIndividuals,\n\nEstates,\n\nTrusts (other than grantor trusts),\n\nPersonal service corporations, and\n\nClosely held corporations.\n\nEven though the rules don’t apply to grantor trusts, partnerships, and S corporations directly, they do apply to the owners of these entities.\n\nFor information about personal service corporations and closely held corporations, including definitions and how the passive activity rules apply to these corporations, see Form 8810 and its instructions.\n\n. Before applying the passive activity limits, you must first determine the amount of the deductions disallowed under the basis or at-risk rules. See Passive Activity Deductions, later..\n\nPassive Activity Loss\n\nGenerally, the passive activity loss for the tax year isn’t allowed. However, there is a special allowance under which some or all of your passive activity loss may be allowed. See Special $25,000 allowance, later.\n\nDefinition of passive activity loss.\n\nGenerally, your passive activity loss for the tax year is the excess of your passive activity deductions over your passive activity gross income. See Passive Activity Income and Deductions, later.\n\nFor a closely held corporation, the passive activity loss is the excess of passive activity deductions over the sum of passive activity gross income and net active income. For details on net active income, see the Instructions for Form 8810. For the definition of passive activity gross income, see Passive Activity Income, later. For the definition of passive activity deductions, see Passive Activity Deductions, later.\n\nIdentification of Disallowed Passive Activity Deductions\n\nIf all or a part of your passive activity loss is disallowed for the tax year, you may need to allocate the disallowed passive activity loss among different passive activities and among different deductions within a passive activity.\n\nAllocation of disallowed passive activity loss among activities.\n\nIf all or any part of your passive activity loss is disallowed for the tax year, a ratable portion of the loss (if any) from each of your passive activities is disallowed. The ratable portion of a loss from an activity is computed by multiplying the passive activity loss that’s disallowed for the tax year by the fraction obtained by dividing:\n\nThe loss from the activity for the tax year; by\n\nThe sum of the losses for the tax year from all activities having losses for the tax year.\n\nUse Part VII of Form 8582 to figure the ratable portion of the loss from each activity that’s disallowed.\n\nLoss from an activity.\n\nThe term “loss from an activity” means:\n\nThe amount by which the passive activity deductions (defined later) from the activity for the tax year exceed the passive activity gross income (defined later) from the activity for the tax year; reduced by\n\nAny part of such amount that’s allowed under the Special $25,000 allowance, later.\n\nIf your passive activity gross income from significant participation passive activities (defined later) for the tax year is more than your passive activity deductions from those activities for the tax year, those activities shall be treated, solely for purposes of figuring your loss from the activity, as a single activity that doesn’t have a loss for such tax year. See Significant Participation Passive Activities, later.\n\nExample.\n\nTerry holds interests in three passive activities, A, B, and C. The gross income and deductions from these activities for the tax year are as follows.\n\nA B C Total Gross income $7,000 $4,000 $12,000 $23,000 Deductions (16,000) (20,000) (8,000) (44,000) Net income (loss) ($9,000) ($16,000) $4,000 ($21,000)\n\nTerry’s $21,000 passive activity loss for the tax year is disallowed. Therefore, a ratable portion of the losses from activities A and B is disallowed. The disallowed portion of each loss is as follows.\n\nA: $21,000 x $9,000/$25,000 $7,560 B: $21,000 x $16,000/$25,000 13,440 Total $21,000\n\nAllocation within loss activities.\n\nIf all or any part of your loss from an activity is disallowed under Allocation of disallowed passive activity loss among activities for the tax year, a ratable portion of each of your passive activity deductions (defined later), other than an excluded deduction (defined next) from such activity is disallowed. The ratable portion of a passive activity deduction is the amount of the disallowed portion of the loss from the activity for the tax year multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing:\n\nThe amount of such deduction; by\n\nThe sum of all of your passive activity deductions (other than excluded deductions) from that activity from the tax year.\n\nExcluded deductions.\n\n“Excluded deduction” means any passive activity deduction that’s taken into account in computing your net income from an item of property for a tax year in which an amount of the taxpayer's gross income from such item of property is treated as not from a passive activity. See Recharacterization of Passive Income, later.\n\nSeparately identified deductions.\n\nIn identifying the deductions from an activity that are disallowed, you don’t need to account separately for a deduction unless such deduction may, if separately taken into account, result in an income tax liability for any tax year different from that which would result were such deduction not taken into account separately.\n\nUse Form 8582, Part IX, for any activity if you have passive activity deductions for that activity that must be separately identified.\n\nDeductions that must be accounted for separately include (but aren’t limited to) the following deductions.\n\nDeductions that arise in a rental real estate activity in tax years in which you actively participate in such activity. See Active participation, later.\n\nDeductions that arise in a rental real estate activity in tax years in which you don’t actively participate in such activity. See Active participation, later.\n\nLosses from sales or exchanges of capital assets.\n\nSection 1231 losses. See Section 1231 Gains and Losses in Pub. 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets, for more information.\n\nCarryover of Disallowed Deductions\n\nIn the case of an activity with respect to which any deductions or credits are disallowed for a tax year (the loss activity), the disallowed deductions are allocated among your activities for the next tax year in a manner that reasonably reflects the extent to which each activity continues the loss activity. The disallowed deductions or credits allocated to an activity under the preceding sentence are treated as deductions or credits from the activity for the next tax year. For more information, see Regulations section 1.469-1(f)(4).\n\nPassive Activity Credit\n\nGenerally, the passive activity credit for the tax year is disallowed.\n\nThe passive activity credit is the amount by which the sum of all your credits subject to the passive activity rules exceed your regular tax liability allocable to all passive activities for the tax year. Credits that are included in figuring the general business credit are subject to the passive activity rules.\n\nSee the Instructions for Form 8582-CR for more information.\n\nPublicly Traded Partnership\n\nYou must apply the rules in this part separately to your income or loss from a passive activity held through a publicly traded partnership (PTP). You must also apply the limit on passive activity credits separately to your credits from a passive activity held through a PTP.\n\nYou can offset deductions from passive activities of a PTP only against income or gain from passive activities of the same PTP. Likewise, you can offset credits from passive activities of a PTP only against the tax on the net passive income from the same PTP. This separate treatment rule also applies to a regulated investment company holding an interest in a PTP for the items attributable to that interest.\n\nFor more information on how to apply the passive activity loss rules to PTPs, and on how to apply the limit on passive activity credits to PTPs, see Publicly Traded Partnerships (PTPs) in the instructions for Forms 8582 and 8582-CR, respectively.\n\nPassive Activities\n\nThere are two kinds of passive activities.\n\nTrade or business activities in which you don’t materially participate during the year.\n\nRental activities, even if you do materially participate in them, unless you’re a real estate professional.\n\nMaterial participation in a trade or business is discussed, later, under Activities That Aren’t Passive Activities.\n\nTreatment of former passive activities.\n\nA former passive activity is an activity that was a passive activity in any earlier tax year, but isn’t a passive activity in the current tax year. You can deduct a prior-year unallowed loss from the activity up to the amount of your current-year net income from the activity. Treat any remaining prior-year unallowed loss like you treat any other passive loss.\n\nIn addition, any prior-year unallowed passive activity credits from a former passive activity offset the allocable part of your current-year tax liability. The allocable part of your current-year tax liability is that part of this year's tax liability that‘s allocable to the current-year net income from the former passive activity. You figure this after you reduce your net income from the activity by any prior-year unallowed loss from that activity (but not below zero).\n\nTrade or Business Activities\n\nA trade or business activity is an activity that:\n\nInvolves the conduct of a trade or business (that is, deductions would be allowable under section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code if other limitations, such as the passive activity rules, didn’t apply);\n\nIs conducted in anticipation of starting a trade or business; or\n\nInvolves research or experimental expenditures that are deductible under Internal Revenue Code section 174 (or that would be deductible if you chose to deduct rather than capitalize them).\n\nA trade or business activity doesn’t include a rental activity or the rental of property that’s incidental to an activity of holding the property for investment.\n\nYou generally report trade or business activities on Schedule C, F, or in Part II or III of Schedule E.\n\nRental Activities\n\nA rental activity is a passive activity even if you materially participated in that activity, unless you materially participated as a real estate professional. See Real Estate Professional under Activities That Aren’t Passive Activities, later. An activity is a rental activity if tangible property (real or personal) is used by customers or held for use by customers, and the gross income (or expected gross income) from the activity represents amounts paid (or to be paid) mainly for the use of the property. It doesn’t matter whether the use is under a lease, a service contract, or some other arrangement.\n\nExceptions.\n\nYour activity isn’t a rental activity if any of the following apply.\n\nThe average period of customer use of the property is 7 days or less. You figure the average period of customer use by dividing the total number of days in all rental periods by the number of rentals during the tax year. If the activity involves renting more than one class of property, multiply the average period of customer use of each class by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the gross rental income from that class of property and the denominator is the activity's total gross rental income. The activity's average period of customer use will equal the sum of the amounts for each class.\n\nThe average period of customer use of the property, as figured in (1) above, is 30 days or less and you provide significant personal services with the rentals. Significant personal services include only services performed by individuals. To determine if personal services are significant, all relevant facts and circumstances are taken into consideration, including the frequency of the services, the type and amount of labor required to perform the services, and the value of the services relative to the amount charged for use of the property. Significant personal services don’t include the following.\n\nServices needed to permit the lawful use of the property;\n\nServices to repair or improve property that would extend its useful life for a period substantially longer than the average rental; and\n\nServices that are similar to those commonly provided with long-term rentals of real estate, such as cleaning and maintenance of common areas or routine repairs.\n\nYou provide extraordinary personal services in making the rental property available for customer use. Services are extraordinary personal services if they’re performed by individuals and the customers' use of the property is incidental to their receipt of the services.\n\nThe rental is incidental to a nonrental activity. The rental of property is incidental to an activity of holding property for investment if the main purpose of holding the property is to realize a gain from its appreciation and the gross rental income from the property is less than 2% of the smaller of the property's unadjusted basis or fair market value. The unadjusted basis of property is its cost not reduced by depreciation or any other basis adjustment. The rental of property is incidental to a trade or business activity if all of the following apply.\n\nYou own an interest in the trade or business activity during the year.\n\nThe rental property was used mainly in that trade or business activity during the current year, or during at least 2 of the 5 preceding tax years.\n\nYour gross rental income from the property is less than 2% of the smaller of its unadjusted basis or fair market value. Lodging provided to an employee or the employee's spouse or dependents is incidental to the activity or activities in which the employee performs services if the lodging is furnished for the employer's convenience.\n\nYou customarily make the rental property available during defined business hours for nonexclusive use by various customers.\n\nYou provide the property for use in a nonrental activity in your capacity as an owner of an interest in the partnership, S corporation, or joint venture conducting that activity.\n\n. If you meet any of the exceptions listed above, see the Instructions for Form 8582 for information about how to report any income or loss from the activity..\n\nSpecial $25,000 allowance.\n\nIf you or your spouse actively participated in a passive rental real estate activity, the amount of the passive activity loss that’s disallowed is decreased and you therefore can deduct up to $25,000 of loss from the activity from your nonpassive income. This special allowance is an exception to the general rule disallowing the passive activity loss. Similarly, you can offset credits from the activity against the tax on up to $25,000 of nonpassive income after taking into account any losses allowed under this exception.\n\nIf you’re married, filing a separate return, and lived apart from your spouse for the entire tax year, your special allowance can’t be more than $12,500. If you lived with your spouse at any time during the year and are filing a separate return, you can’t use the special allowance to reduce your nonpassive income or tax on nonpassive income.\n\nThe maximum special allowance is reduced if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds certain amounts. See Phaseout rule, later.\n\nExample.\n\nYou are a single taxpayer. You have $70,000 in wages, $15,000 income from a limited partnership, a $26,000 loss from rental real estate activities in which you actively participated. Because your modified adjusted gross income is less than $100,000, you aren’t subject to the modified adjusted gross income phaseout rule. You can use $15,000 of your $26,000 loss to offset your $15,000 passive income from the partnership. You actively participated in your rental real estate activities, so you can use the remaining $11,000 rental real estate loss to offset $11,000 of your nonpassive income (wages).\n\nActive participation.\n\nActive participation isn’t the same as material participation (defined later). Active participation is a less stringent standard than material participation. For example, you may be treated as actively participating if you make management decisions in a significant and bona fide sense. Management decisions that count as active participation include approving new tenants, deciding on rental terms, approving expenditures, and similar decisions.\n\nOnly individuals can actively participate in rental real estate activities. However, a decedent's estate is treated as actively participating for its tax years ending less than 2 years after the decedent's death, if the decedent would have satisfied the active participation requirement for the activity for the tax year the decedent died.\n\nA decedent's qualified revocable trust can also be treated as actively participating if both the trustee and the executor (if any) of the estate choose to treat the trust as part of the estate. The choice applies to tax years ending after the decedent's death and before:\n\n2 years after the decedent's death if no estate tax return is required, or\n\n6 months after the estate tax liability is finally determined if an estate tax return is required.\n\nThe choice is irrevocable and can’t be made later than the due date for the estate's first income tax return (including any extensions).\n\nExcept as provided in regulations, limited partners aren’t treated as actively participating in a partnership's rental real estate activities.\n\nYou aren’t treated as actively participating in a rental real estate activity unless your interest in the activity (including your spouse's interest) was at least 10% (by value) of all interests in the activity throughout the year.\n\nActive participation isn’t required to take the low-income housing credit or the rehabilitation investment credit from rental real estate activities.\n\nExample.\n\nStacey, a single taxpayer, had the following income and loss during the tax year.\n\nSalary $42,300 Dividends 300 Interest 1,400 Rental loss (4,000)\n\nThe rental loss came from a house Stacey owned. Stacey advertised and rented the house to the current tenant. Stacey also collected the rents and did the repairs or hired someone to do them.\n\nEven though the rental loss is a loss from a passive activity, Stacey can use the entire $4,000 loss to offset other income because Stacey actively participated.\n\nPhaseout rule.\n\nThe maximum special allowance of $25,000 ($12,500 for married individuals filing separate returns and living apart at all times during the year) is reduced by 50% of the amount of your modified adjusted gross income that’s more than $100,000 ($50,000 if you’re married filing separately). If your modified adjusted gross income is $150,000 or more ($75,000 or more if you’re married filing separately), you generally can’t use the special allowance. This is because the special allowance is reduced to $0 since the modified adjusted gross income is over the $100,000 amount.\n\nModified adjusted gross income for this purpose is your adjusted gross income figured without the following.\n\nTaxable social security and Tier 1 railroad retirement benefits.\n\nDeductible contributions to individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and section 501(c)(18) pension plans.\n\nThe exclusion from income of interest from qualified U.S. savings bonds used to pay qualified higher education expenses.\n\nThe exclusion from income of amounts received from an employer's adoption assistance program.\n\nPassive activity income or loss included on Form 8582.\n\nAny rental real estate loss allowed because you materially participated in the rental activity as a Real Estate Professional (as discussed, later, under Activities That Aren’t Passive Activities).\n\nAny overall loss from a publicly traded partnership (see Publicly Traded Partnerships (PTPs) in the instructions for Form 8582).\n\nThe deduction allowed for the deductible part of self-employment tax.\n\nForeign-derived intangible income and global intangible low-taxed income.\n\nThe deduction allowed for interest on student loans.\n\nExample.\n\nDuring 2023, you were unmarried and weren’t a real estate professional. For 2023, you had $120,000 in salary and a $31,000 loss from your rental real estate activities in which you actively participated. Your modified adjusted gross income is $120,000. When you file your 2023 return, you can deduct only $15,000 of your passive activity loss. You must carry over the remaining $16,000 passive activity loss to 2024. You figure your deduction and carryover as follows.\n\nAdjusted gross income, modified as\n\nrequired $120,000 Minus amount not subject to phaseout –100,000 Amount subject to phaseout rule $20,000 Multiply by 50% (0.50) × 50% Required reduction to special allowance $10,000 Maximum special allowance $25,000 Minus required reduction (see above) –10,000 Adjusted special allowance $15,000 Passive loss from rental real estate $31,000 Deduction allowable/Adjusted\n\nspecial allowance (see above) –15,000 Amount that must be carried forward $16,000\n\nExceptions to the phaseout rules.\n\nA higher phaseout range applies to rehabilitation investment credits from rental real estate activities. For those credits, the phaseout of the $25,000 special allowance starts when your modified adjusted gross income exceeds $200,000 ($100,000 if you’re a married individual filing a separate return and living apart at all times during the year).\n\nThere is no phaseout of the $25,000 special allowance for low-income housing credits.\n\nOrdering rules.\n\nIf you have more than one of the exceptions to the phaseout rules in the same tax year, you must apply the $25,000 phaseout against your passive activity losses and credits in the following order.\n\nPassive activity losses.\n\nThe portion of passive activity credits attributable to credits other than the rehabilitation and low-income housing credits.\n\nThe portion of passive activity credits attributable to the rehabilitation credit.\n\nThe portion of passive activity credits attributable to the low-income housing credit.\n\nActivities That Aren’t Passive Activities\n\nThe following aren’t passive activities.\n\nTrade or business activities in which you materially participated for the tax year.\n\nA working interest in an oil or gas well that you hold directly or through an entity that doesn’t limit your liability (such as a general partner interest in a partnership). It doesn’t matter whether you materially participated in the activity for the tax year. However, if your liability was limited for part of the year (for example, you converted your general partner interest to a limited partner interest during the year) and you had a net loss from the well for the year, some of your income and deductions from the working interest may be treated as passive activity gross income and passive activity deductions. See Temporary Regulations section 1.469-1T(e)(4)(ii).\n\nThe rental of a dwelling unit that you also used for personal purposes during the year for more than the greater of 14 days or 10% of the number of days during the year that the home was rented at a fair rental.\n\nAn activity of trading personal property for the account of those who own interests in the activity. See Temporary Regulations section 1.469-1T(e)(6).\n\nRental real estate activities in which you materially participated as a real estate professional. See Real Estate Professional, later.\n\n. You shouldn’t enter income and losses from these activities on Form 8582, as they are not passive activities. Instead, enter them on the forms or schedules you would normally use..\n\nMaterial Participation\n\nA trade or business activity isn’t a passive activity if you materially participated in the activity.\n\nMaterial participation tests.\n\nYou materially participated in a trade or business activity for a tax year if you satisfy any of the following tests.\n\nYou participated in the activity for more than 500 hours.\n\nYour participation was substantially all the participation in the activity of all individuals for the tax year, including the participation of individuals who didn’t own any interest in the activity.\n\nYou participated in the activity for more than 100 hours during the tax year, and you participated at least as much as any other individual (including individuals who didn’t own any interest in the activity) for the year.\n\nThe activity is a significant participation activity, and you participated in all significant participation activities for more than 500 hours. A significant participation activity is any trade or business activity in which you participated for more than 100 hours during the year and in which you didn’t materially participate under any of the material participation tests, other than this test. See Significant Participation Passive Activities under Recharacterization of Passive Income, later.\n\nYou materially participated in the activity (other than by meeting this fifth test) for any 5 (whether or not consecutive) of the 10 immediately preceding tax years.\n\nThe activity is a personal service activity in which you materially participated for any 3 (whether or not consecutive) preceding tax years. An activity is a personal service activity if it involves the performance of personal services in the fields of health (including veterinary services), law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, or any other trade or business in which capital isn’t a material income-producing factor.\n\nBased on all the facts and circumstances, you participated in the activity on a regular, continuous, and substantial basis during the year.\n\nYou didn’t materially participate in the activity under test (7) if you participated in the activity for 100 hours or less during the year. Your participation in managing the activity doesn’t count in determining whether you materially participated under this test if:\n\nAny person other than you received compensation for managing the activity, or\n\nAny individual spent more hours during the tax year managing the activity than you did (regardless of whether the individual was compensated for the management services).\n\nParticipation.\n\nIn general, any work you do in connection with an activity in which you own an interest is treated as participation in the activity.\n\nWork not usually performed by owners.\n\nYou don’t treat the work you do in connection with an activity as participation in the activity if both of the following are true.\n\nThe work isn’t work that’s customarily done by the owner of that type of activity.\n\nOne of your main reasons for doing the work is to avoid the disallowance of any loss or credit from the activity under the passive activity rules.\n\nParticipation as an investor.\n\nYou don’t treat the work you do in your capacity as an investor in an activity as participation unless you’re directly involved in the day-to-day management or operations of the activity. Work you do as an investor includes:\n\nStudying and reviewing financial statements or reports on operations of the activity,\n\nPreparing or compiling summaries or analyses of the finances or operations of the activity for your own use, and\n\nMonitoring the finances or operations of the activity in a nonmanagerial capacity.\n\nSpouse's participation.\n\nYour participation in an activity includes your spouse's participation. This applies even if your spouse didn’t own any interest in the activity and you and your spouse don’t file a joint return for the year.\n\n. Proof of participation. You can use any reasonable method to prove your participation in an activity for the year. You don’t have to keep contemporaneous daily time reports, logs, or similar documents if you can establish your participation in some other way. For example, you can show the services you performed and the approximate number of hours spent by using an appointment book, calendar, or narrative summary. .\n\nLimited partners.\n\nIf you owned an activity as a limited partner, you generally aren’t treated as materially participating in the activity. However, you’re treated as materially participating in the activity if you met test (1), (5), or (6) under Material participation tests, discussed earlier, for the tax year.\n\nYou aren’t treated as a limited partner, however, if you were also a general partner in the partnership at all times during the partnership's tax year ending with or within your tax year (or, if shorter, during that part of the partnership's tax year in which you directly or indirectly owned your limited partner interest).\n\nRetired or disabled farmer and surviving spouse of a farmer.\n\nIf you’re a retired or disabled farmer, you’re treated as materially participating in a farming activity if you materially participated for 5 or more of the 8 years before your retirement or disability. Similarly, if you’re a surviving spouse of a farmer, you’re treated as materially participating in a farming activity if the real property used in the activity meets the estate tax rules for special valuation of farm property passed from a qualifying decedent, and you actively manage the farm.\n\nCorporations.\n\nA closely held corporation or a personal service corporation is treated as materially participating in an activity only if one or more shareholders holding more than 50% by value of the outstanding stock of the corporation materially participate in the activity.\n\nA closely held corporation can also satisfy the material participation standard by meeting the first two requirements for the qualifying business exception from the at-risk limits. See Special exception for qualified corporations under Activities Covered by the At-Risk Rules, later.\n\nReal Estate Professional\n\nGenerally, rental activities are passive activities even if you materially participated in them. However, if you qualified as a real estate professional, rental real estate activities in which you materially participated aren’t passive activities. For this purpose, each interest you have in a rental real estate activity is a separate activity, unless you choose to treat all interests in rental real estate activities as one activity. See the Instructions for Schedule E (Form 1040), Supplemental Income and Loss, for information about making this choice.\n\nIf you qualified as a real estate professional for 2023, report income or losses from rental real estate activities in which you materially participated as nonpassive income or losses, and complete line 43 of Schedule E (Form 1040). If you also have an unallowed loss from these activities from an earlier year when you didn’t qualify, see Treatment of former passive activities under Passive Activities, earlier.\n\nQualifications.\n\nYou qualified as a real estate professional for the year if you met both of the following requirements.\n\nMore than half of the personal services you performed in all trades or businesses during the tax year were performed in real property trades or businesses in which you materially participated.\n\nYou performed more than 750 hours of services during the tax year in real property trades or businesses in which you materially participated.\n\nDon’t count personal services you performed as an employee in real property trades or businesses unless you were a 5% owner of your employer. You were a 5% owner if you owned (or are considered to have owned) more than 5% of your employer's outstanding stock, outstanding voting stock, or capital or profits interest.\n\nIf you file a joint return, don’t count your spouse's personal services to determine whether you met the preceding requirements. However, you can count your spouse's participation in an activity in determining if you materially participated.\n\nReal property trades or businesses.\n\nA real property trade or business is a trade or business that does any of the following with real property.\n\nDevelops or redevelops it.\n\nConstructs or reconstructs it.\n\nAcquires it.\n\nConverts it.\n\nRents or leases it.\n\nOperates or manages it.\n\nBrokers it.\n\nReal property development.\n\nReal property development is a trade or business that includes the maintenance and improvement of raw land to make it suitable for subdivision, further development, or construction of residential or commercial buildings. Also included in real property development is the establishment, cultivation, maintenance, or improvement of timberlands.\n\nReal property redevelopment.\n\nReal property redevelopment is a trade or business that includes demolition, deconstruction, separation, and removal of existing buildings, landscaping, and infrastructure on a parcel of land to return the land to a raw condition or otherwise prepare the land for new development or construction, or for establishment, cultivation, maintenance, or improvement of timberlands.\n\nReal property operations.\n\nReal property operations involve handling the day-to-day operations of a trade or business relating to the maintenance and occupancy of the real property affecting its availability or functionality by a direct or indirect owner. The real property must be used, or held for use, by customers and payments received must be principally for the customer's use of the property and not for the provision of other significant or extraordinary personal services.\n\nReal property management.\n\nReal property management involves handling the day-to-day operations of a trade or business relating to the maintenance and occupancy of the real property affecting its availability or functionality by a professional manager. The real property must be used, or held for use, by customers and payments received must be principally for the customer's use of the property and not for the provision of other significant or extraordinary personal services. A professional manager is a person who is not a direct or indirect owner of the real property or properties and who is responsible for, on a full-time basis, management and oversight of the real property or properties.\n\nClosely held corporations.\n\nA closely held corporation can qualify as a real estate professional if more than 50% of the gross receipts for its tax year came from real property trades or businesses in which it materially participated.\n\nPassive Activity Income and Deductions\n\nIn figuring your net income or loss from a passive activity, take into account only passive activity income and passive activity deductions.\n\nSelf-charged interest.\n\nCertain self-charged interest income or deductions may be treated as passive activity gross income or passive activity deductions if the loan proceeds are used in a passive activity.\n\nGenerally, self-charged interest income and deductions result from loans between you and a partnership or S corporation in which you had a direct or indirect ownership interest. This includes both loans you made to the partnership or S corporation and loans the partnership or S corporation made to you.\n\nIt also includes loans from one partnership or S corporation to another partnership or S corporation if each owner in the borrowing entity has the same proportional ownership interest in the lending entity.\n\nException. The self-charged interest rules don’t apply to your interest in a partnership or S corporation if the entity made an election under Regulations section 1.469-7(g) to avoid the application of these rules. For more details on the self-charged interest rules, see Regulations section 1.469-7.\n\nPassive Activity Income\n\nPassive activity income includes all income from passive activities and generally includes gain from disposition of an interest in a passive activity or property used in a passive activity.\n\nPassive activity income doesn’t include the following items.\n\nIncome from an activity that isn’t a passive activity. These activities are discussed under Activities That Aren’t Passive Activities, earlier.\n\nPortfolio income. This includes interest, dividends, annuities, and royalties not derived in the ordinary course of a trade or business. It includes gain or loss from the disposition of property that produces these types of income or that’s held for investment. The exclusion for portfolio income doesn’t apply to self-charged interest treated as passive activity income. For more information on self-charged interest, see Self-charged interest, earlier.\n\nPersonal service income. This includes salaries, wages, commissions, self-employment income from trade or business activities in which you materially participated, deferred compensation, taxable social security and other retirement benefits, and payments from partnerships to partners for personal services.\n\nIncome from positive section 481 adjustments allocated to activities other than passive activities. (Section 481 adjustments are adjustments that must be made due to changes in your accounting method.)\n\nIncome or gain from investments of working capital.\n\nIncome from an oil or gas property if you treated any loss from a working interest in the property for any tax year beginning after 1986 as a nonpassive loss, as discussed in item (2) under Activities That Aren’t Passive Activities, earlier. This also applies to income from other oil and gas property, the basis of which is determined wholly or partly by the basis of the property in the preceding sentence.\n\nAny income from intangible property, such as a patent, copyright, or literary, musical, or artistic composition, if your personal efforts significantly contributed to the creation of the property.\n\nAny other income that must be treated as nonpassive income. See Recharacterization of Passive Income, later.\n\nOverall gain from any interest in a publicly traded partnership. See Publicly Traded Partnerships (PTPs) in the instructions for Form 8582.\n\nState, local, and foreign income tax refunds.\n\nIncome from a covenant not to compete.\n\nReimbursement of a casualty or theft loss included in gross income to recover all or part of a prior-year loss deduction, if the loss deduction wasn’t a passive activity deduction.\n\nAlaska Permanent Fund dividends.\n\nCancellation of debt income, if at the time the debt is discharged the debt isn’t allocated to passive activities under the interest expense allocation rules. See Temporary Regulations section 1.163-8T for information about the rules for allocating interest.\n\nDisposition of property interests.\n\nGain on the disposition of an interest in property is generally passive activity income if, at the time of the disposition, the property was used in an activity that was a passive activity in the year of disposition. The gain generally isn’t passive activity income if, at the time of disposition, the property was used in an activity that wasn’t a passive activity in the year of disposition. An exception to this general rule may apply if you previously used the property in a different activity.\n\nException for more than one use in the preceding 12 months.\n\nIf you used the property in more than one activity during the 12-month period before its disposition, you must allocate the gain between the activities on a basis that reasonably reflects the property's use during that period. Any gain allocated to a passive activity is passive activity income.\n\nFor this purpose, an allocation of the gain solely to the activity in which the property was mainly used during that period reasonably reflects the property's use if the fair market value of your interest in the property isn’t more than the lesser of:\n\n$10,000, or\n\n10% of the total of the fair market value of your interest in the property and the fair market value of all other property used in that activity immediately before the disposition.\n\nException for substantially appreciated property.\n\nThe gain is passive activity income if the fair market value of the property at disposition was more than 120% of its adjusted basis and either of the following conditions applies.\n\nYou used the property in a passive activity for 20% of the time you held your interest in the property.\n\nYou used the property in a passive activity for the entire 24-month period before its disposition.\n\nIf neither condition applies, the gain isn’t passive activity income. However, it’s treated as portfolio income only if you held the property for investment for more than half of the time you held it in nonpassive activities.\n\nFor this purpose, treat property you held through a corporation (other than an S corporation) or other entity whose owners receive only portfolio income as property held in a nonpassive activity and as property held for investment. Also, treat the date you agree to transfer your interest for a fixed or determinable amount as the disposition date.\n\nIf you used the property in more than one activity during the 12-month period before its disposition, this exception applies only to the part of the gain allocated to a passive activity under the rules described in the preceding discussion.\n\nDisposition of property converted to inventory.\n\nIf you disposed of property that you had converted to inventory from its use in another activity (for example, you sold condominium units you previously held for use in a rental activity), a special rule may apply. Under this rule, you disregard the property's use as inventory and treat it as if it were still used in that other activity at the time of disposition. This rule applies only if you meet all of the following conditions.\n\nAt the time of disposition, you held your interest in the property in a dealing activity (an activity that involves holding the property or similar property mainly for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business).\n\nYour other activities included a nondealing activity (an activity that doesn’t involve holding similar property for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business) in which you used the property for more than 80% of the period you held it.\n\nYou didn’t acquire or hold your interest in the property for the main purpose of selling it to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business.\n\nPassive Activity Deductions\n\nGenerally, a deduction is a passive activity deduction for a tax year if and only if such deduction either:\n\nArises in connection with the conduct of an activity that’s a passive activity for the tax year, or\n\nIs treated as a deduction from an activity for the tax year because it was disallowed by the passive activity rules in the preceding year and carried forward to the tax year.\n\nFor purposes of item (1) above, an item of deduction arises in the tax year in which the item would be allowable as a deduction under the taxpayer's method of accounting if taxable income for all tax years were determined without regard to the passive activity rules and without regard to the basis and at-risk limits. See Coordination with other limitations on deductions that apply before the passive activity rules, later.\n\nPassive activity deductions generally include any loss from a disposition of property used in a passive activity at the time of the disposition and any loss from a disposition of less than your entire interest in a passive activity.\n\nExceptions.\n\nPassive activity deductions don’t include the following items.\n\nDeductions for expenses (other than interest expense) that are clearly and directly allocable to portfolio income.\n\nQualified home mortgage interest, capitalized interest expenses, and other interest expenses (other than self-charged interest) properly allocable to passive activities. For more information on self-charged interest, see Self-charged interest under Passive Activity Income and Deductions, earlier.\n\nLosses from dispositions of property that produce portfolio income or property held for investment.\n\nState, local, and foreign income taxes.\n\nMiscellaneous itemized deductions that may be disallowed because of the 2%-of-adjusted-gross-income limit (expired for 2018 through 2025).\n\nCharitable contribution deductions.\n\nNet operating loss deductions.\n\nPercentage depletion carryovers for oil and gas wells.\n\nCapital loss carrybacks and carryovers.\n\nItems of deduction from a passive activity that are disallowed under the limits on deductions that apply before the passive activity rules. See Coordination with other limitations on deductions that apply before the passive activity rules, later.\n\nDeductions and losses that would have been allowed for tax years beginning before 1987 but for basis or at-risk limits.\n\nNet negative section 481 adjustments allocated to activities other than passive activities. (Section 481 adjustments are adjustments required due to changes in accounting methods.)\n\nCasualty and theft losses, unless losses similar in cause and severity recur regularly in the activity.\n\nThe deduction allowed for the deductible part of self-employment tax.\n\nCoordination with other limitations on deductions that apply before the passive activity rules.\n\nAn item of deduction from a passive activity that’s disallowed for a tax year under the basis or at-risk limitations isn’t a passive activity deduction for the tax year. The following sections provide rules for figuring the extent to which items of deduction from a passive activity are disallowed for a tax year under the basis or at-risk limitations.\n\nProration of deductions disallowed under basis limitations.\n\nIf any amount of your distributive share of a partnership's loss for the tax year is disallowed under the basis limitation, a ratable portion of your distributive share of each item of deduction or loss of the partnership is disallowed for the tax year. For this purpose, the ratable portion of an item of deduction or loss is the amount of such item multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing:\n\nThe amount of your distributive share of partnership loss that’s disallowed for the tax year, by\n\nThe sum of your distributive shares of all items of deduction and loss of the partnership for the tax year.\n\nIf any amount of your pro rata share of an S corporation's loss for the tax year is disallowed under the basis limitation, a ratable portion of your pro rata share of each item of deduction or loss of the S corporation is disallowed for the tax year. For this purpose, the ratable portion of an item of deduction or loss is the amount of such item multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing:\n\nThe amount of your share of S corporation loss that’s disallowed for the tax year, by\n\nThe sum of your pro rata shares of all items of deduction and loss of the corporation for the tax year.\n\nProration of deductions disallowed under at-risk limitation.\n\nIf any amount of your loss from an activity (as defined in Activities Covered by the At-Risk Rules, later) is disallowed under the at-risk rules for the tax year, a ratable portion of each item of deduction or loss from the activity is disallowed for the tax year. For this purpose, the ratable portion of an item of deduction or loss is the amount of such item multiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing:\n\nThe amount of the loss from the activity that’s disallowed for the tax year, by\n\nThe sum of all deductions from the activity for the tax year.\n\nSeparately identified items of deduction and loss.\n\nIn identifying the items of deduction and loss from an activity that aren’t disallowed under the basis and at-risk limitations (and that therefore may be treated as passive activity deductions), you needn’t account separately for any item of deduction or loss unless such item may, if separately taken into account, result in an income tax liability different from that which would result were such item of deduction or loss not taken into account separately.\n\nItems of deduction or loss that must be accounted for separately include (but aren’t limited to) items of deduction or loss that:\n\nAre attributable to separate activities. See Grouping Your Activities, later.\n\nArise in a rental real estate activity in tax years in which you actively participate in such activity.\n\nArise in a rental real estate activity in tax years in which you don’t actively participate in such activity.\n\nArose in a tax year beginning before 1987 and weren’t allowed for such tax year under the basis or at-risk limitations.\n\nAre taken into account under section 613A(d) (relating to limitations on certain depletion deductions).\n\nAre taken into account under section 1211 (relating to the limitation on capital losses).\n\nAre taken into account under section 1231 (relating to property used in a trade or business and involuntary conversions). See Section 1231 Gains and Losses in Pub. 544 for more information.\n\nAre attributable to pre-enactment interests in activities. See Temporary Regulations section 1.469-11T(c).\n\nExcess business loss limitation that applies after the passive activity rules.\n\nIf you are a noncorporate taxpayer and have allowable business losses after considering first the at-risk limitations and then the passive loss limitations (Form 8582), your losses may be subject to the excess business loss limitation. After considering all the other loss limitations, complete Form 461, Limitation on Business Losses, to figure the amount of your excess business loss. See Form 461 and its instructions for details on the excess business loss limitation.\n\nGrouping Your Activities\n\nYou can treat one or more trade or business activities, or rental activities, as a single activity if those activities form an appropriate economic unit for measuring gain or loss under the passive activity rules.\n\nGrouping is important for a number of reasons. If you group two activities into one larger activity, you need only show material participation in the activity as a whole. But if the two activities are separate, you must show material participation in each one. On the other hand, if you group two activities into one larger activity and you dispose of one of the two, then you have disposed of only part of your entire interest in the activity. But if the two activities are separate and you dispose of one of them, then you have disposed of your entire interest in that activity.\n\nGrouping can also be important in determining whether you meet the 10% ownership requirement for actively participating in a rental real estate activity.\n\nAppropriate Economic Units\n\nGenerally, to determine if activities form an appropriate economic unit, you must consider all the relevant facts and circumstances. You can use any reasonable method of applying the relevant facts and circumstances in grouping activities. The following factors have the greatest weight in determining whether activities form an appropriate economic unit. All of the factors don’t have to apply to treat more than one activity as a single activity. The factors that you should consider are:\n\nThe similarities and differences in the types of trades or businesses;\n\nThe extent of common control;\n\nThe extent of common ownership;\n\nThe geographical location; and\n\nThe interdependencies between or among activities, which may include the extent to which the activities:\n\nBuy or sell goods between or among themselves,\n\nInvolve products or services that are generally provided together,\n\nHave the same customers,\n\nHave the same employees, or\n\nUse a single set of books and records to account for the activities.\n\nExample 1.\n\nJackie owns a bakery and a movie theater at a shopping mall in Baltimore and a bakery and movie theater in Philadelphia. Based on all the relevant facts and circumstances, there may be more than one reasonable method for grouping Jackie's activities. For example, Jackie may be able to group the movie theaters and the bakeries into:\n\nOne activity,\n\nA movie theater activity and a bakery activity,\n\nA Baltimore activity and a Philadelphia activity, or\n\nFour separate activities.\n\nExample 2.\n\nPat is a partner in ABC partnership, which sells nonfood items to grocery stores. Pat is also a partner in DEF (a trucking business). ABC and DEF are under common control. The main part of DEF's business is transporting goods for ABC. DEF is the only trucking business in which Pat is involved. Based on the rules of this section, Pat treats ABC's wholesale activity and DEF's trucking activity as a single activity.\n\nConsistency and disclosure requirement.\n\nGenerally, when you group activities into appropriate economic units, you may not regroup those activities in a later tax year. You must meet any disclosure requirements of the IRS when you first group your activities and when you add or dispose of any activities in your groupings.\n\nHowever, if the original grouping is clearly inappropriate or there is a material change in the facts and circumstances that makes the original grouping clearly inappropriate, you must regroup the activities and comply with any disclosure requirements of the IRS.\n\nSee Disclosure Requirement, later.\n\nRegrouping by the IRS.\n\nIf any of the activities resulting from your grouping isn’t an appropriate economic unit and one of the primary purposes of your grouping (or failure to regroup) is to avoid the passive activity rules, the IRS may regroup your activities.\n\nRental activities.\n\nIn general, you can’t group a rental activity with a trade or business activity. However, you can group them together if the activities form an appropriate economic unit and:\n\nThe rental activity is insubstantial in relation to the trade or business activity;\n\nThe trade or business activity is insubstantial in relation to the rental activity; or\n\nEach owner of the trade or business activity has the same ownership interest in the rental activity, in which case the part of the rental activity that involves the rental of items of property for use in the trade or business activity may be grouped with the trade or business activity.\n\nExample.\n\nFinley and Taylor are married and file a joint return. Healthy Food, an S corporation, is a grocery store business. Finley is Healthy Food's only shareholder. Plum Tower, an S corporation, owns and rents out the building. Taylor is Plum Tower's only shareholder. Plum Tower rents part of its building to Healthy Food. Plum Tower's grocery store rental business and Healthy Food's grocery business aren’t insubstantial in relation to each other.\n\nFinley and Taylor file a joint return, so they’re treated as one taxpayer for purposes of the passive activity rules. The same owner (Finley and Taylor) owns both Healthy Food and Plum Tower with the same ownership interest (100% in each). If the grouping forms an appropriate economic unit, as discussed earlier, Finley and Taylor can group Plum Tower's grocery store rental and Healthy Food's grocery business into a single trade or business activity.\n\nGrouping of real and personal property rentals.\n\nIn general, you can’t treat an activity involving the rental of real property and an activity involving the rental of personal property as a single activity. However, you can treat them as a single activity if you provide the personal property in connection with the real property or the real property in connection with the personal property.\n\nCertain activities may not be grouped: limited partnerships and limited entrepreneurs.\n\nIn general, if you own an interest as a limited partner or a limited entrepreneur in one of the following activities, you may not group that activity with any other activity in another type of business.\n\nHolding, producing, or distributing motion picture films or video tapes.\n\nFarming.\n\nLeasing any section 1245 property (as defined in section 1245(a)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code). For a list of section 1245 property, see Section 1245 property under Activities Covered by the At-Risk Rules, later.\n\nExploring for, or exploiting, oil and gas resources.\n\nExploring for, or exploiting, geothermal deposits.\n\nIf you own an interest as a limited partner or a limited entrepreneur in an activity described in the list above, you may group that activity with another activity in the same type of business if the grouping forms an appropriate economic unit, as discussed earlier.\n\nLimited entrepreneur.\n\nA limited entrepreneur is a person who:\n\nHas an interest in an enterprise other than as a limited partner, and\n\nDoesn’t actively participate in the management of the enterprise.\n\nCertain activities may not be grouped: trading activities.\n\nA trading activity of trading personal property is not a passive activity. Personal property is any personal property that is actively traded (for example, financial securities). A taxpayer who does not materially participate in a trading activity is prohibited from grouping the activity with any other activity including any other trading activity. The prohibition on grouping is effective for tax years beginning on or after March 22, 2021. If you are a calendar year taxpayer, the new provisions apply to you beginning in calendar year 2022.\n\nActivities conducted through another entity.\n\nA personal service corporation, closely held corporation, partnership, or S corporation must group its activities using the rules discussed in this section. Once the entity groups its activities, you, as the partner or shareholder of the entity, may group those activities (following the rules of this section):\n\nWith each other,\n\nWith activities conducted directly by you, or\n\nWith activities conducted through other entities.\n\n. You may not treat activities grouped together by the entity as separate activities. .\n\nPersonal service and closely held corporations.\n\nYou may group an activity conducted through a personal service or closely held corporation with your other activities only to determine whether you materially or significantly participated in those other activities. See Material Participation, earlier, and Significant Participation Passive Activities, later.\n\nPublicly traded partnership (PTP).\n\nYou may not group activities conducted through a PTP with any other activity, including an activity conducted through another PTP.\n\nPartial dispositions.\n\nIf you dispose of substantially all of an activity during your tax year, you may treat the part disposed of as a separate activity. However, you can do this only if you can show with reasonable certainty:\n\nThe amount of deductions and credits disallowed in prior years under the passive activity rules that’s allocable to the part of the activity disposed of, and\n\nThe amount of gross income and any other deductions and credits for the current tax year that are allocable to the part of the activity disposed of.\n\nRegrouping Due to Net Investment Income Tax\n\nYou may be able to regroup your activities, as described below, if you’re subject to the Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) for the first time. For detailed information, see Regulations section 1.469-11(b)(3)(iv).\n\nRegrouping on an original return.\n\nUnder the NIIT “fresh start” election, you may regroup for the first tax year you are subject to the NIIT (without regard to the effect of regrouping). You may regroup only once under this election and that regrouping will apply to the tax year for which you regroup and all future tax years. You are eligible to regroup if:\n\nYou were not previously subject to the NIIT;\n\nThe amount you would have entered on Form 8960, line 12, without the regrouping, would have been greater than zero; and\n\nThe amount you would have entered on Form 8960, line 13, without the regrouping, would have been greater than the amount you would have entered on Form 8960, line 14, without the regrouping.\n\nRegrouping on an amended return.\n\nYou may regroup your activities on an amended tax return, but only if you were not subject to the NIIT on your original return (or previously amended return). You are eligible if:\n\nYou were not previously subject to the NIIT for the tax year for which you are filing an amended return or any prior tax year;\n\nThe changes on the amended return cause you to be subject to the NIIT for the first time beginning in the tax year for which you are amending the return;\n\nThe limitation period for assessments under Code section 6501 hasn’t ended;\n\nThe changes on your amended return cause the amount on Form 8960, line 12, of your amended return to be greater than zero; and\n\nThe changes on your amended return cause the amount on Form 8960, line 13, of your amended return to be greater than the amount entered on Form 8960, line 14.\n\nThis rule applies equally to changes to modified adjusted gross income or net investment income upon an IRS examination.\n\nManner of regrouping.\n\nIf you regroup your activities under this rule, you must attach to your original or amended return, as applicable, a statement that satisfies the requirements described in Regrouping under Disclosure Requirement, later.\n\nDisclosure Requirement\n\nFor tax years beginning after January 24, 2010, the following disclosure requirements for groupings apply. You’re required to report certain changes to your groupings that occur during the tax year to the IRS. If you fail to report these changes, each trade or business activity or rental activity will be treated as a separate activity. You will be considered to have made a timely disclosure if you filed all affected income tax returns consistent with the claimed grouping and make the required disclosure on the income tax return for the year in which you first discovered the failure to disclose. If the IRS discovered the failure to disclose, you must have reasonable cause for not making the required disclosure.\n\nNew grouping.\n\nYou must file a written statement with your original income tax return for the first tax year in which two or more activities are originally grouped into a single activity. The statement must provide the names, addresses, and employer identification numbers (EINs), if applicable, for the activities being grouped as a single activity. In addition, the statement must contain a declaration that the grouped activities make up an appropriate economic unit for the measurement of gain or loss under the passive activity rules.\n\nAddition to an existing grouping.\n\nYou must file a written statement with your original income tax return for the tax year in which you add a new activity to an existing group. The statement must provide the name, address, and EIN, if applicable, for the activity that’s being added and for the activities in the existing group. In addition, the statement must contain a declaration that the activities make up an appropriate economic unit for the measurement of gain or loss under the passive activity rules.\n\nRegrouping.\n\nYou must file a written statement with your original income tax return for the tax year in which you regroup the activities. The statement must provide the names, addresses, and EINs, if applicable, for the activities that are being regrouped. If two or more activities are being regrouped into a single activity, the statement must contain a declaration that the regrouped activities make up an appropriate economic unit for the measurement of gain or loss under the passive activity rules. In addition, the statement must contain an explanation of the material change in the facts and circumstances that made the original grouping clearly inappropriate.\n\nGroupings by partnerships and S corporations.\n\nPartnerships and S corporations aren’t subject to the rules for new grouping, addition to an existing grouping, or regrouping. Instead, they must comply with the disclosure instructions for grouping activities provided in their Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income, or Form 1120-S, U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation, whichever is applicable.\n\nThe partner or shareholder isn’t required to make a separate disclosure of the groupings disclosed by the entity unless the partner or shareholder:\n\nGroups together any of the activities that the entity doesn’t group together,\n\nGroups the entity's activities with activities conducted directly by the partner or shareholder, or\n\nGroups an entity's activities with activities conducted through another entity.\n\nA partner or shareholder may not treat activities grouped together by the entity as separate activities.\n\nRecharacterization of Passive Income\n\nNet income from the following passive activities may have to be recharacterized and excluded from passive activity income.\n\nSignificant participation passive activities,\n\nRental of property when less than 30% of the unadjusted basis of the property is subject to depreciation,\n\nEquity-financed lending activities,\n\nRental of property incidental to development activities,\n\nRental of property to nonpassive activities, and\n\nLicensing of intangible property by\n\npass-through entities.\n\nIf you’re engaged in or have an interest in one of these activities during the tax year (either directly or through a partnership or an S corporation), combine the income and losses from the activity to determine if you have a net loss or net income from that activity.\n\nIf the result is a net loss, treat the income and losses the same as any other income or losses from that type of passive activity (trade or business activity or rental activity).\n\nIf the result is net income, don’t enter any of the income or losses from the activity or property on Form 8582 or its separate parts, as they are recharacterized as nonpassive. Instead, enter income or losses on the form and schedules you normally use. However, see Significant Participation Passive Activities, later, if the activity is a significant participation passive activity and you also have a net loss from a different significant participation passive activity.\n\nLimit on recharacterized passive income.\n\nThe total amount that you treat as nonpassive income under the rules described later in this discussion for significant participation passive activities, rental of nondepreciable property, and equity-financed lending activities can’t exceed the greatest amount that you treat as nonpassive income under any one of these rules.\n\nInvestment income and investment expense.\n\nTo figure your investment interest expense limitation on Form 4952, treat as investment income any net passive income recharacterized as nonpassive income from rental of nondepreciable property, equity-financed lending activity, or licensing of intangible property by a pass-through entity.\n\nSignificant Participation Passive Activities\n\nA significant participation passive activity is any trade or business activity in which you participated for more than 100 hours during the tax year but didn’t materially participate.\n\nIf your gross income from all significant participation passive activities is more than your deductions from those activities, a part of your net income from each significant participation passive activity is treated as nonpassive income.\n\nCorporations.\n\nAn activity of a personal service corporation or closely held corporation is a significant participation passive activity if both of the following statements are true.\n\nThe corporation isn’t treated as materially participating in the activity for the year.\n\nOne or more individuals, each of whom is treated as significantly participating in the activity, directly or indirectly, hold (in total) more than 50% (by value) of the corporation's outstanding stock.\n\nWorksheet A.\n\nComplete Worksheet A. Significant Participation Passive Activities if you have income or losses from any significant participation activity. Begin by entering the name of each activity in the left column.\n\nColumn (a).\n\nEnter the number of hours you participated in each activity and total the column.\n\nIf the total is more than 500, don’t complete Worksheet A or B. None of the activities are passive activities because you satisfy test 4 for material participation. (See Material participation tests, earlier.) Report all the income and losses from these activities on the forms and schedules you normally use. Don’t include the income and losses on Form 8582.\n\nColumn (b).\n\nEnter the net loss, if any, from the activity. Net loss from an activity means either:\n\nThe activity's current-year net loss (if any) plus prior-year unallowed losses (if any), or\n\nThe excess of prior-year unallowed losses over the current-year net income (if any). Enter -0- here if the prior-year unallowed loss is the same as the current-year net income.\n\nColumn (c).\n\nEnter net income (if any) from the activity. Net income means the excess of the current-year net income from the activity over any prior-year unallowed losses from the activity.\n\nColumn (d).\n\nCombine amounts in the Totals row for columns (b) and (c) and enter the total net income or net loss in the Totals row of column (d). If column (d) is a net loss, skip Worksheet B. Significant Participation Activities With Net Income. Include the income and losses in Part V of Form 8582 (or Worksheet 2 in the Instructions for Form 8810).\n\nWorksheet A. Significant Participation Passive Activities\n\nName of activity (a) Hours of participation\n\n(b) Net loss\n\n(c) Net income (d) Combine totals of cols. (b) and (c) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) Totals ( )\n\nWorksheet B.\n\nOn Worksheet B. Significant Participation Activities With Net Income, list only the significant participation passive activities that have net income as shown in column (c) of Worksheet A.\n\nColumn (a).\n\nEnter the net income of each activity from column (c) of Worksheet A.\n\nColumn (b).\n\nDivide each of the individual net income amounts in column (a) by the total of column (a). The result is a ratio. In column (b), enter the ratio for each activity as a decimal (rounded to at least three places). The total of these ratios must equal 1.000.\n\nColumn (c).\n\nMultiply the amount in the Totals row of column (d) of Worksheet A by each of the ratios in column (b). Enter the results in column (c).\n\nColumn (d).\n\nSubtract column (c) from column (a). To this figure, add the amount of prior-year unallowed losses (if any) that reduced the current-year net income. Enter the result in column (d). Enter these amounts on Part V of Form 8582 or Worksheet 2 in the Instructions for Form 8810. (See also Limit on recharacterized passive income, earlier.)\n\nRental of Nondepreciable Property\n\nIf you have net passive income (including prior-year unallowed losses) from renting property in a rental activity, and less than 30% of the unadjusted basis of the property is subject to depreciation, you treat the net passive income as nonpassive income.\n\nExample.\n\nCharlie acquires vacant land for $300,000, constructs improvements at a cost of $100,000, and leases the land and improvements to a tenant. Charlie then sells the land and improvements for $600,000, realizing a gain of $200,000 on the disposition.\n\nThe unadjusted basis of the improvements ($100,000) equals 25% of the unadjusted basis of all property ($400,000) used in the rental activity.\n\nCharlie's net passive income from the activity (which is figured with the gain from the disposition, including gain from the improvements) is treated as nonpassive income.\n\nWorksheet B. Significant Participation Activities With Net Income\n\nName of activity\n\nwith net income\n\n(a) Net income (b) Ratio\n\n(see instructions) (c) Nonpassive income\n\n(see instructions) (d) Passive income\n\n(subtract col. (c) from col. (a)) Totals 1.000\n\nEquity-Financed Lending Activities\n\nIf you have gross income from an equity-financed lending activity, the lesser of the net passive income or the equity-financed interest income is nonpassive income.\n\nFor more information, see Temporary Regulations section 1.469-2T(f)(4).\n\nRental of Property Incidental to a Development Activity\n\nNet income from this type of activity will be treated as nonpassive income if all of the following apply.\n\nYou recognize gain from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of the rental property during the tax year.\n\nYou started to rent the property less than 12 months before the date of disposition.\n\nYou materially participated or significantly participated for any tax year in an activity that involved the performance of services for the purpose of enhancing the value of the property (or any other item of property if the basis of the property disposed of is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of that item of property).\n\nFor more information, see Regulations section 1.469-2(f)(5).\n\nRental of Property to a Nonpassive Activity\n\nIf you rent property to a trade or business activity in which you materially participated, net rental income from the property is treated as nonpassive income. This rule doesn’t apply to net income from renting property under a written binding contract entered into before February 19, 1988. It also doesn’t apply to property described earlier under Rental of Property Incidental to a Development Activity.\n\nLicensing of Intangible Property by Pass-Through Entities\n\nNet royalty income from intangible property held by a pass-through entity in which you own an interest may be treated as nonpassive royalty income. This applies if you acquired your interest in the pass-through entity after the partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust created the intangible property or performed substantial services or incurred substantial costs for developing or marketing the intangible property.\n\nThis recharacterization rule doesn’t apply if:\n\nThe expenses reasonably incurred by the entity in developing or marketing the property exceed 50% of the gross royalties from licensing the property that are includible in your gross income for the tax year, or\n\nYour share of the expenses reasonably incurred by the entity in developing or marketing the property for all tax years exceeded 25% of the fair market value of your interest in the intangible property at the time you acquired your interest in the entity.\n\nFor purposes of (2) above, capital expenditures are taken into account for the entity's tax year in which the expenditure is chargeable to a capital account, and your share of the expenditure is figured as if it were allowed as a deduction for the tax year.\n\nDispositions\n\nAny passive activity losses (but not credits) that haven’t been allowed (including current-year losses) are generally allowed in full in the tax year in which you dispose of your entire interest in the passive (or former passive) activity. However, for the losses to be allowed, you must dispose of your entire interest in the activity in a transaction in which all realized gain or loss is recognized. Also, the person acquiring the interest from you must not be related to you.\n\n. If you have a capital loss on the disposition of an interest in a passive activity, the loss may be limited. For individuals, your capital loss deduction is limited to the amount of your capital gains plus the lower of $3,000 ($1,500 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return) or the excess of your capital losses over capital gains. See Pub. 544 for more information. .\n\nExample.\n\nCarter earned a $60,000 salary and owned one passive activity through a 5% interest in the B Limited Partnership. In 2023, Carter sold that entire partnership interest to an unrelated person for $30,000. Carter’s adjusted basis in the partnership interest was $42,000, and Carter had carried over $2,000 of ordinary passive activity deductions from the activity.\n\nCarter's deductible loss for 2023 is $5,000, figured as follows.\n\nAmount realized $30,000 Minus: adjusted basis –42,000 Capital loss $12,000 Minus: capital loss limit –3,000 Capital loss carryover $9,000 Allowable capital loss on sale $3,000 Carryover losses allowable 2,000 Total current deductible loss $5,000\n\nCarter deducts the $5,000 total current deductible loss in 2023 and must carry over the remaining $9,000 capital loss, which isn’t subject to the passive activity loss limit. Carter will treat it like any other capital loss carryover.\n\nInstallment sale of an entire interest.\n\nIf you sell your entire interest in a passive activity through an installment sale, to figure the loss for the current year that isn’t limited by the passive activity rules, multiply your overall loss (not including losses allowed in prior years) by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the gain recognized in the current year, and the denominator is the total gain from the sale minus all gains recognized in prior years.\n\nExample.\n\nRiley has a total gain of $10,000 from the sale of an entire interest in a passive activity. Under the installment method, Riley reports $2,000 of gain each year, including the year of sale. For the first year, 20% (2,000/10,000) of the losses are allowed. For the second year, 25% (2,000/8,000) of the remaining losses are allowed.\n\nPartners and S corporation shareholders.\n\nGenerally, any gain or loss on the disposition of a partnership interest must be allocated to each trade or business, rental, or investment activity in which the partnership owns an interest. If you dispose of your entire interest in a partnership, the passive activity losses from the partnership that haven’t been allowed are generally allowed in full. They will also be allowed if the partnership (other than a PTP) disposes of all the property used in that passive activity.\n\nIf you don’t dispose of your entire interest, the gain or loss allocated to a passive activity is treated as passive activity income or deduction in the year of disposition. This includes any gain recognized on a distribution of money from the partnership that you receive in excess of the adjusted basis of your partnership interest.\n\nThese rules also apply to the disposition of stock in an S corporation.\n\nDispositions by gift.\n\nIf you give away your interest in a passive activity, the unused passive activity losses allocable to the interest can’t be deducted in any tax year. Instead, the basis of the transferred interest must be increased by the amount of these losses.\n\nDispositions by death.\n\nIf a passive activity interest is transferred because the owner dies, unused passive activity losses are allowed (to a certain extent) as a deduction against the decedent's income in the year of death. The decedent's losses are allowed only to the extent they exceed the amount by which the transferee's basis in the passive activity has been increased under the rules for determining the basis of property acquired from a decedent. For example, if the basis of an interest in a passive activity in the hands of a transferee is increased by $6,000 and unused passive activity losses of $8,000 were allocable to the interest at the date of death, then the decedent's deduction for the tax year would be limited to $2,000 ($8,000 − $6,000).\n\nIf you inherited property from a decedent who died in 2010, special rules may apply if the executor of the estate filed Form 8939, Allocation of Increase in Basis for Property Acquired From a Decedent. For more information, see Pub. 4895, Tax Treatment of Property Acquired From a Decedent Dying in 2010, which is available at IRS.gov/pub/irs-prior/p4895--2011.pdf.\n\nPartial dispositions.\n\nIf you dispose of substantially all of an activity during your tax year, you may be able to treat the part of the activity disposed of as a separate activity. See Partial dispositions under Grouping Your Activities, earlier.\n\nHow To Report Your Passive Activity Loss\n\nMore than one form or schedule may be required for reporting your passive activities. The actual number of forms depends on the number and types of activities you must report. Some forms and schedules that may be required are:\n\nSchedule C (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From Business;\n\nSchedule D (Form 1040), Capital Gains and Losses;\n\nSchedule E (Form 1040), Supplemental Income and Loss;\n\nSchedule F (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From Farming;\n\nForm 4797, Sales of Business Property;\n\nForm 6252, Installment Sale Income;\n\nForm 8582, Passive Activity Loss Limitations;\n\nForm 8582-CR, Passive Activity Credit Limitations; and\n\nForm 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets.\n\nRegardless of the number or complexity of passive activities you have, you should use only one Form 8582. If you need additional lines for any of the Form 8582 parts, you can either use copies of page 1, page 2, and/or page 3 of Form 8582, whichever is applicable, or your own schedule that’s in the same format as the applicable part.\n\nFor examples and further information, see the Form 8582 instructions.\n\nAt-Risk Limits\n\nThe at-risk rules limit your losses from most activities to your amount at risk in the activity. You treat any loss that’s disallowed because of the at-risk limits as a deduction from the same activity in the next tax year. If your losses from an at-risk activity are allowed, they’re subject to recapture in later years if your amount at risk is reduced below zero.\n\n. You must apply the at-risk rules before the passive activity rules discussed in the first part of this publication. .\n\nLoss defined.\n\nA loss is the excess of allowable deductions from the activity for the year (including depreciation or amortization allowed or allowable and disregarding the at-risk limits) over income received or accrued from the activity during the year. Income doesn’t include income from the recapture of previous losses (discussed, later, under Recapture Rule).\n\nForm 6198.\n\nUse Form 6198 to figure how much loss from an activity you can deduct.\n\nFile Form 6198 with your tax return if:\n\nYou have a loss from any part of an activity that’s covered by the at-risk rules, and\n\nYou aren’t at risk for some of your investment in the activity.\n\nFile Form 6198 if you’re engaged in an activity included in (6) under Activities Covered by the At-Risk Rules, later, and you have borrowed amounts described in Certain borrowed amounts excluded under At-Risk Amounts, later.\n\nLoss limits for partners and S corporation shareholders.\n\nSeparate limits may apply to a partner's or shareholder's distributive share of an item of deduction or loss from a partnership or S corporation, respectively. The limits determine the amount each partner or shareholder can deduct on their own return. These limits and the order in which they apply are:\n\nThe adjusted basis of:\n\nThe partner's partnership interest, or\n\nThe shareholder's stock plus any loans the shareholder makes to the corporation,\n\nThe at-risk rules, and\n\nThe passive activity rules.\n\nSee Limitations on Losses, Deductions, and Credits in Partner's Instructions for Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) and Shareholder's Instructions for Schedule K-1 (Form 1120-S).\n\nSee Coordination with other limitations on deductions that apply before the passive activity rules, earlier.\n\nSee also Excess business loss limitation that applies after the passive activity rules, earlier, for limitations that may apply after an allowable passive activity loss is determined.\n\nWho Is Affected?\n\nThe at-risk limits apply to individuals (including partners and S corporation shareholders), estates, trusts, and certain closely held C corporations.\n\nClosely held C corporation.\n\nFor the at-risk rules, a C corporation is a closely held corporation if at any time during the last half of the tax year, more than 50% in value of its outstanding stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by or for five or fewer individuals.\n\nTo figure if more than 50% in value of the stock is owned by five or fewer individuals, apply the following rules.\n\nStock owned directly or indirectly by or for a corporation, partnership, estate, or trust is considered owned proportionately by its shareholders, partners, or beneficiaries.\n\nAn individual is considered to own the stock owned directly or indirectly by or for their family. Family includes only brothers and sisters (including half brothers and half sisters), a spouse, ancestors, and lineal descendants.\n\nIf a person holds an option to buy stock, they are considered to be the owner of that stock.\n\nWhen applying rule (1) or (2), stock considered owned by a person under rule (1) or (3) is treated as actually owned by that person. Stock considered owned by an individual under rule (2) isn’t treated as owned by the individual for again applying rule (2) to consider another the owner of that stock.\n\nStock that may be considered owned by an individual under either rule (2) or (3) is considered owned by the individual under rule (3).\n\nActivities Covered by the At-Risk Rules\n\nIf you’re involved in one of the following activities as a trade or business or for the production of income, you’re subject to the at-risk rules.\n\nHolding, producing, or distributing motion picture films or video tapes.\n\nFarming.\n\nLeasing section 1245 property, including personal property and certain other tangible property that’s depreciable or amortizable. See Section 1245 property, later.\n\nExploring for, or exploiting, oil and gas.\n\nExploring for, or exploiting, geothermal deposits (for wells started after September 1978).\n\nAny other activity not included in (1) through (5) that’s carried on as a trade or business or for the production of income.\n\nSection 1245 property.\n\nSection 1245 property includes any property that is or has been subject to depreciation or amortization and is:\n\nPersonal property,\n\nOther tangible property (other than a building or its structural components) that’s:\n\nUsed in manufacturing, production, extraction, or furnishing transportation, communications, electrical energy, gas, water, or sewage disposal services;\n\nA research facility used for the activities in (a); or\n\nA facility used in any of the activities in (a) for the bulk storage of fungible commodities,\n\nReal property (other than property described in (2)) with an adjusted basis that was reduced by certain amortization deductions listed in section 1245(a)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code,\n\nA single-purpose agricultural or horticultural structure, or\n\nA storage facility (other than a building or its structural components) used for the distribution of petroleum.\n\nException for equipment leasing by a closely held corporation.\n\nIf a closely held corporation is actively engaged in equipment leasing, the equipment leasing is treated as a separate activity not covered by the at-risk rules. A closely held corporation is actively engaged in equipment leasing if 50% or more of its gross receipts for the tax year is from equipment leasing. Equipment leasing means the leasing, purchasing, servicing, and selling of equipment that’s section 1245 property.\n\nHowever, equipment leasing doesn’t include the leasing of master sound recordings and similar contractual arrangements for tangible or intangible assets associated with literary, artistic, or musical properties, such as books, lithographs of artwork, or musical tapes. A closely held corporation can’t exclude these leasing activities from the at-risk rules nor count them as equipment leasing for the gross receipts test.\n\nThe equipment leasing exclusion also isn’t available for leasing activities related to other at-risk activities, such as motion picture films and video tapes, farming, oil and gas properties, and geothermal deposits. For example, if a closely held corporation leases a video tape, it can’t exclude this leasing activity from the at-risk rules under the equipment leasing exclusion.\n\nControlled group of corporations.\n\nA controlled group of corporations is subject to special rules for the equipment leasing exclusion. See section 465(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nSpecial exception for qualified corporations.\n\nA qualified corporation isn’t subject to the at-risk limits for any qualifying business carried on by the corporation. Each qualifying business is treated as a separate activity.\n\nQualified corporation.\n\nA qualified corporation is a closely held C corporation, defined earlier, that isn’t:\n\nA personal holding company, or\n\nA personal service corporation (defined in section 269A(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, but determined by substituting 5% for 10%).\n\nQualifying business.\n\nA qualifying business is any active business if all of the following apply.\n\nDuring the entire 12-month period ending on the last day of the tax year, the corporation had at least:\n\nOne full-time employee whose services were in the active management of the business, and\n\nThree full-time nonowner employees whose services were directly related to the business. A nonowner employee is an employee who doesn’t own more than 5% in value of the outstanding stock of the corporation at any time during the tax year. (The rules for constructive ownership of stock in section 318 of the Internal Revenue Code apply. However, in applying these rules, an owner of 5% or more, rather than 50% or more, of the value of a corporation's stock is considered to own a proportionate share of any stock owned by the corporation.)\n\nDeductions due to the business that are allowable to the corporation as business expenses and as contributions to certain employee benefit plans for the tax year exceed 15% of the gross income from the business.\n\nThe business isn’t an excluded business. Generally, an excluded business means equipment leasing as defined, earlier, under Exception for equipment leasing by a closely held corporation, and any business involving the use, exploitation, sale, lease, or other disposition of master sound recordings, motion picture films, video tapes, or tangible or intangible assets associated with literary, artistic, musical, or similar properties.\n\nSeparation of Activities\n\nGenerally, you treat your activity involving each film or video tape, item of leased section 1245 property, farm, oil and gas property, or geothermal property as a separate activity. In addition, each investment that isn’t a part of a trade or business is treated as a separate activity.\n\nLeasing by a partnership or S corporation.\n\nFor a partnership or S corporation, treat all leasing of section 1245 property that’s placed in service in any tax year of the partnership or S corporation as one activity.\n\nAggregation of Activities\n\nActivities described in (6) under Activities Covered by the At-Risk Rules, earlier, that constitute a trade or business are treated as one activity if:\n\nYou actively participate in the management of the trade or business, or\n\nThe trade or business is carried on by a partnership or S corporation and 65% or more of its losses for the tax year is allocable to persons who actively participate in the management of the trade or business.\n\nSimilar rules apply to activities described in (1) through (5) of that earlier discussion.\n\nActive participation.\n\nActive participation depends on all the facts and circumstances. Factors that indicate active participation include making decisions involving the operation or management of the activity, performing services for the activity, and hiring and discharging employees. Factors that indicate a lack of active participation include lack of control in managing and operating the activity, having authority only to discharge the manager of the activity, and having a manager of the activity who is an independent contractor rather than an employee.\n\nPartners and S corporation shareholders.\n\nPartners or shareholders may aggregate activities of their partnership or S corporation within each of the following categories.\n\nFilms and video tapes,\n\nFarms,\n\nOil and gas properties, and\n\nGeothermal properties.\n\nFor example, if a partnership or S corporation produces two films or video tapes, the partners or S corporation shareholders may treat the production of both films or video tapes as one activity for purposes of the at-risk rules.\n\nAt-Risk Amounts\n\nYou’re at risk in any activity for:\n\nThe money and adjusted basis of property you contribute to the activity, and\n\nAmounts you borrow for use in the activity if:\n\nYou’re personally liable for repayment, or\n\nYou pledge property (other than property used in the activity) as security for the loan.\n\nAmounts borrowed.\n\nYou’re at risk for amounts borrowed to use in the activity if you’re personally liable for repayment. You’re also at risk if the amounts borrowed are secured by property other than property used in the activity. In this case, the amount considered at risk is the net fair market value of your interest in the pledged property. The net fair market value of property is its fair market value (determined on the date the property is pledged) less any prior (or superior) claims to which it’s subject. However, no property will be taken into account as security if it’s directly or indirectly financed by debt that’s secured by property you contributed to the activity.\n\n. If you borrow money to finance a contribution to an activity, you can’t increase your amount at risk by the contribution and the amount borrowed to finance the contribution. You may increase your at-risk amount only once. .\n\nCertain borrowed amounts excluded.\n\nEven if you’re personally liable for the repayment of a borrowed amount or you secure a borrowed amount with property other than property used in the activity, you aren’t considered at risk if you borrowed the money from a person having an interest in the activity or from someone related to a person (other than you) having an interest in the activity. This doesn’t apply to:\n\nAmounts borrowed by a corporation from a person whose only interest in the activity is as a shareholder of the corporation,\n\nAmounts borrowed from a person having an interest in the activity as a creditor, or\n\nAmounts borrowed after May 3, 2004, secured by real property used in the activity of holding real property (other than mineral property) that, if nonrecourse, would be qualified nonrecourse financing.\n\nRelated persons.\n\nRelated persons include:\n\nMembers of a family, but only an individual's brothers and sisters, half brothers and half sisters, spouse, ancestors (parents, grandparents, etc.), and lineal descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.);\n\nTwo corporations that are members of the same controlled group of corporations determined by applying a 10% ownership test;\n\nThe fiduciaries of two different trusts, or the fiduciary and beneficiary of two different trusts, if the same person is the grantor of both trusts;\n\nA tax-exempt educational or charitable organization and a person who directly or indirectly controls it (or a member of whose family controls it);\n\nA corporation and an individual who owns directly or indirectly more than 10% of the value of the outstanding stock of the corporation;\n\nA trust fiduciary and a corporation of which more than 10% in value of the outstanding stock is owned directly or indirectly by or for the trust or by or for the grantor of the trust;\n\nThe grantor and fiduciary, or the fiduciary and beneficiary, of any trust;\n\nA corporation and a partnership if the same persons own more than 10% in value of the outstanding stock of the corporation and more than 10% of the capital interest or the profits interest in the partnership;\n\nTwo S corporations if the same persons own more than 10% in value of the outstanding stock of each corporation;\n\nAn S corporation and a regular corporation if the same persons own more than 10% in value of the outstanding stock of each corporation;\n\nA partnership and a person who owns directly or indirectly more than 10% of the capital or profits of the partnership;\n\nTwo partnerships if the same persons directly or indirectly own more than 10% of the capital or profits of each;\n\nTwo persons who are engaged in business under common control (within the meaning of section 52(a) and (b)); and\n\nAn executor of an estate and a beneficiary of that estate.\n\nTo determine the direct or indirect ownership of the outstanding stock of a corporation, apply the following rules.\n\nStock owned directly or indirectly by or for a corporation, partnership, estate, or trust is considered owned proportionately by or for its shareholders, partners, or beneficiaries.\n\nStock owned directly or indirectly by or for an individual's family is considered owned by the individual. The family of an individual includes only brothers and sisters, half brothers and half sisters, a spouse, ancestors, and lineal descendants.\n\nAny stock in a corporation owned by an individual (other than by applying rule (2)) is considered owned directly or indirectly by or for the individual's partner.\n\nWhen applying rule (1), (2), or (3), stock considered owned by a person under rule (1) is treated as actually owned by that person. But, if a person constructively owns stock because of rule (2) or (3), they don’t own the stock for purposes of applying either rule (2) or (3) to make another person the constructive owner of the same stock.\n\nEffect of government price support programs.\n\nA government target price program or other government price support programs for"
