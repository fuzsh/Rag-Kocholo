        "text": "How does a child learn a language? By observing and imitating others. The same holds true for adults as well, although the process is not as simple for them.\n\nIn this digital age, learning a new language can get one better work opportunities, help in travelling, or simply improve communication skills. English, being a global language, has the highest value, and it’s totally possible to learn English by watching movies.\n\nMost people are already consuming media content on a regular basis, so why not learn a few things while doing it? Plus, movies are entertaining and help relax as well. With that being said, we bring you 10 amazing movies to learn the English language.\n\nList of 10 Amazing Movies to Learn English\n\n1. Toy Story\n\nRelease Date: 1995\n\nCast: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Annie Potts, Don Rickles\n\nAnimated movies are generally targeted towards children, and as we all know, they are not the most well-spoken individuals. On top of being fun and family-friendly, animated movies also feature simplistic storylines and dialogue that can be easily understood by everyone.\n\nAnd the best of the genre belongs to Disney and Pixar. If you’re looking for a good animated movie to start with, try Toy Story. The film centers on the secret lives of children’s toys, who, when not in use, get up to their own adventures.\n\nToy Story was a huge critical and commercial success and is widely regarded as one of the best-animated movies.\n\n2. The Avengers\n\nRelease Date: 2012\n\nCast: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans\n\nSuperhero movies are all the craze nowadays and are popular worldwide. And like animated movies, filmmakers choose dialogue and references that will be easily understood by everyone, irrespective of race, culture, or language.\n\nSuperhero movies range back to the 1960s, but the modern Marvel Cinematic Universe is probably the best superhero franchise in existence. Once you watch all the solo movies, try to pay better attention to the ensemble movies like The Avengers. These movies feature multiple actors from varying backgrounds and accents that can be quite educative.\n\n3. The King’s Speech\n\nRelease Date: 2010\n\nCast: Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter, Guy Pearce\n\nThe King’s Speech will probably feel like a horror film to those with social anxiety or speaking disorders. The film is based on the true story of King George VI of England, who suffered from a stammering problem throughout his life.\n\nThe King's Speech takes place just before the Second World War, and Prince Albert (later George VI) ascended to the throne at the same time. To be a good leader and inspire his country, Albert decides to overcome his affliction with the help of an eccentric speech therapist. The King’s Speech is a great movie to learn a few tricks for speaking in public and improving English. The King’s Speech won the Best Picture and Best Actor Oscars as well.\n\n4. Before Sunrise\n\nRelease Date: 1995\n\nCast: Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy\n\nBefore Sunrise is a dialogue-driven romance movie that takes place over the course of one fateful evening in Vienna. Richard Linklater directed Before Sunrise and its two subsequent sequels.\n\nBefore Sunrise revolves around two strangers who meet on a train in Europe and instantly form a deep connection. The film features multiple, thoughtful conversations that will definitely come in handy for someone looking to learn English.\n\n5. Thank You for Smoking\n\nRelease Date: 2005\n\nCast: Aaron Eckhart, Katie Holmes, J.K. Simmons\n\nSatire is one of the best ways to demonstrate command of any language, and Thank You for Smoking is arguably the best modern satirical movie in Hollywood.\n\nThank You for Smoking centers on a lobbyist for Big Tobacco whose only job is to convince everyone that tobacco is not harmful and should be consumed even more. Interestingly, the film doesn’t feature a single shot of a cigarette.\n\nThank You for Smoking can teach a lot about the hypocrisy in politics and the media, and the spin tactics they use to fool people.\n\n6. 12 Angry Men\n\nRelease Date: 1957\n\nCast: Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Joseph Sweeney\n\n12 Angry Men is an essential movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives. This Sidney Lumet film takes place in one room where 12 jurors deliberate on the conviction or acquittal of a teenager charged with murder.\n\n12 Angry Men is an amazing movie that deals with issues of racism and stereotypes. And since all the characters in the movie remain unnamed, the viewers can see facets of their own personalities in them. 12 Angry Men is a dialogue-driven movie, so you’ll have to pay some attention, but it’s quite easy to understand.\n\n7. Jurassic Park\n\nRelease Date: 1993\n\nCast: Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum\n\nSteven Spielberg’s Jurassic Park is another essential watch for everyone. Jurassic Park centers on a visionary billionaire who opens a theme park where the main attraction is dinosaurs. But to no one's surprise, all hell breaks loose when a T. Rex goes awry.\n\nJurassic Park explains scientific topics and jargon with simple language and is a movie suited to all age groups. If you’re looking for some great English dialogue and also epic action, Jurassic Park should be on your watchlist.\n\n8. Pulp Fiction\n\nRelease Date: 1994\n\nCast: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis\n\nWhen it comes to dialogues, Quentin Tarantino is one of the best writers working in Hollywood. Tarantino is also an accomplished director whose best work is perhaps Pulp Fiction.\n\nPulp Fiction consists of four interconnected narratives, and each is more absurd than the other. While Pulp Fiction features some rich dialogue, it’s not suited for everyone. Pulp Fiction is high on vulgarity and violence, but it is an outstanding movie regardless.\n\n9. Gosford Park\n\nRelease Date: 2001\n\nCast: Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren, Michael Gambon, Clive Owen\n\nThe period genre is also an excellent way of learning English. The Victorian era didn’t have any modern slang etc. And the English that was spoken was quite unadulterated. Gosford Park is a prime example of this.\n\nGosford Park is a period mystery movie directed by Robert Altman and written by Julian Fellowes. The film centers on a group of wealthy Britons and their servants who become embroiled in a murder investigation after a dinner party.\n\nGosford Park won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay and is widely regarded as one of the best movies of the 21st century.\n\n10. The Social Network\n\nRelease Date: 2010\n\nCast: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Armie Hammer, Justin Timberlake\n\nFinally, we have The Social Network, one of the best movies of the century. Written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by David Fincher, The Social Network tells the story of the creation of Facebook and the subsequent lawsuits against its co-creator, Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThe opening scene of The Social Network is enough to throw even the most eloquent English speakers off. It’s no surprise the film ended up winning an Oscar for its screenplay.\n\nThe Social Network is an intricately written film that demands the viewer's complete attention. So, only watch it when you’ve checked out all the previous entries on the list.\n\nConclusion:\n\nMovies can teach you about mannerisms and tone, but not about grammar and syntax. However, it’s a great short-term solution to learn or brush up on your English while also having fun. Hopefully, you liked our list of 10 amazing movies to learn English.
