        "text": "1000 Level Courses\n\n1000-level courses initiate students to the university-level study of English literature. Students will be introduced to the rich diversity of English literature and to the scholarly research tools which make the study of English possible. Discussions, activities and assignments focus on close reading practices which allow students to move beyond arguments based primarily on questions plot. Students will be expected to begin to develop their own critical point of view and to take responsibility for their own engagement with the texts at hand. 1000-level courses are an ideal way to enter an English module, but they also provide the foundations of analysis and argument essential to university-level scholarship in any text-based discipline (e.g. history, philosophy, sociology, classics, etc.).

McDayter Syllabus\n\n1022E - Enriched Introduction to English Literature\n\nWhy does literature matter? This course will pose this question by examining works of literature from the fourteenth century to now and through assignments that ask you to hone a range of interpretive, critical, and creative skills necessary to your future success as students and leaders. Above all the course will explore how the writing and reading of literature are inherently political acts that ask us to think through our most pressing issues – environment, sexuality, race, gender, class – with tolerance for others and hope for the future. 1.0 course\n\nFall/Winter 1022E / 001 J. Faflak Syllabus\n\n1027F - The Storyteller’s Art I: Introduction to Narrative POPULAR!\n\nThe act of storytelling has been essential to human culture from the time of the ancient Greeks to the present day. Stories are integral to the way we define ourselves – and manipulate others. This course will examine the story teller’s art not only through novels and short stories but also in its ancient and modern forms, ranging from the epic to more recent forms such as the graphic novel. As diverse as these stories may seem, they share a central concern with the way we represent ourselves and interpret others. 0.5 course\n\nFall 2024 1027F / 001 C.

Keep Syllabus\n\n1028G (002) - The Storyteller’s Art II | Introduction to Narrative: Monsters, Ghosts, and Demons POPULAR!\n\nMonsters, ghosts, and demons appear in sublime stories. This course charts the development of these supernatural beings in the nineteenth century, including Frankenstein, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and Dracula. The course will examine several gothic narratives in their historical, cultural, and artistic contexts.\n\nThe weekly course schedule consists of two hours of lecture and a third hour of tutorial discussion facilitated by a teaching assistant. In addition to providing opportunities for the discussion of reading and lecture materials, tutorials will also provide substantial instruction in effective essay writing and research methods. English 1028G is a course in its own right. It need not be taken in combination with any other course. Students who took English 1028G (The Storyteller’s Art I), will have the equivalent of a 1.0 “essay” course for their breadth requirements, and completed the 1.0 credits in first-year English necessary to take senior-level courses. 0.5 course\n\nWinter 2025 1028G / 002 M.

The aim of this course is to encourage students to develop a critical understanding of all aspects of popular culture. 1.0 course\n\nFall/Winter 2017 / 650 (Online) N. Joseph Syllabus\n\n2033E - Children’s Literature POPULAR!\n\nThis course examines the development of literature for and about children from its roots in fairy tales, nursery rhymes, and nonsense literature. Animal stories, adventure tales, picture books, and domestic novels will be considered alongside visits to fantasy realms like Wonderland, Neverland, or the Land of Oz. A central focus will be the assumptions about children and childhood that shape these texts, all produced by adults based on what they believe children enjoy, want, or need. 1.0 course\n\nFall/Winter 2033E / 001 G. Ceraldi Syllabus\n\n2041F - Special Topics in Drama: The Knight of the Burning Pestle\n\nIn this course, students participating in the Department of English and Writing Studies' Drama Production - The Knight of the Burning Pestle, explore in theory and practice approaches to text in performance. Only students working as an actor, director, stage manager, assistant stage manager, lighting, set or costume designer may enroll. Please note: Auditions are held prior to the course start date so that students can register and receive a course credit for their part in the production. See course page for more details. Permission required to enroll. 0.5 course\n\nFall 2024 2041F / 001 J. Devereux Syllabus\n\n2071F - Speculative Fiction: Science Fiction\n\nScience fiction is a speculative art form that deals with new technologies, faraway worlds, and disruptions in the possibilities of the world as we know it. However, it is also very much a product of its time—a literature of social criticism that is anchored in a specific social and historical context. This course will introduce students to the narrative conventions and tropes of science fiction, starting with highly influential works from the nineteenth and early twentieth century—Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, H.G. Wells’ The Time Machine, and Wells’s The War of the Worlds—that are preoccupied with humanity’s place in an inhospitable universe. Next, we examine short stories from the Cold War era that reflect both the apocalyptic sensibility of nuclear confrontation in the sixties and the feelings of historical inevitability that marked the era. Building on these important precedents, our next texts use discussions of alien species and alternative futures to explore the nature of human identity. Ursula Le Guin’s novel The Left Hand of Darkness uses the trope of alien contact to explore the possibilities of an androgynous society unmarked by the divisions of gender. Arrival, a film portraying the appearance of mysterious spacecraft on Earth and the subsequent threat of war, revisits many of the concerns raised by Wells in a postmodern context, and poses new questions about identity, language, and free will. We will finish the course with novels examining the relationship between humans and technology. William Gibson’s Neuromancer foregrounds what many critics see as a crisis in defining human identity in a technological age. Lavalle's graphic novel Destroyer comes full circle to re-examine many of the ideas about artificial intelligence brought up in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, repositioning the creature's desires for love and vengeance in the embittered context of the contemporary United States. Short stories by authors such as Phillip K. Dick and Octavia Butler will round out our exploration of prominent narrative conventions and tropes of science fiction.\n\nThis course is offered as an online asynchronous course. However, it will have a mandatory in-person final exam. Students must be able to come to Western’s campus to write the final exam, which will take place during the December exam period. 0.5 course\n\nFall 2024 2071F / 650 (Online) A. MacLean Syllabus\n\n2071G - Speculative Fiction: Science Fiction\n\nFrom Mary Shelley's Frankenstein to Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, a consideration of the history and development of science fiction. Will include science fiction themes such as the Other, new technologies, chaos theory, cybernetics, paradoxes of space/time travel, first contact, and alien worlds. 0.5 course\n\nWinter 2025 2071G / 001 J. Kelly Syllabus\n\n2072F and 2072G - Speculative Fiction: Fantasy\n\nWizards, vampires, fairies, and the Chosen One – these figures are no longer confined to a genre ghetto but have instead moved to the mainstream. This course examines the roots of the fantasy genre in novels such as Dracula and The Lord of the Rings and considers how the tropes of the genre have been reproduced and transformed by authors like J.K. Rowling and Angela Carter. We will examine the continuing appeal of stories about magic, whether they involve supernatural intrusions, visits to the realm of faerie, or extraordinary powers hidden in apparently ordinary places. 0.5 course\n\nFall 2024 2072F / 001 G. Ceraldi Syllabus Winter 2025 2072G / 650 (Online) G. Ceraldi Syllabus\n\n2073G - Speculative Fiction: Utopias and Dystopias\n\nAn examination of major utopian and dystopian texts. Will concern ways in which humanity has tried to imagine a perfect world, fix the current world, or construct an exaggerated version of the world in order to demonstrate its flaws and weaknesses. 0.5 course\n\nWinter 2025 2073G / 001 G. Ceraldi Syllabus\n\n2091G - From Pixels to Papyrus: A Brief History of the Things We Read\n\nWhat is a “book,” and where does it come from? How did the evolution of systems for the dissemination of information bring us to the modern printed codex and virtual e-text? What is the impact of the medium of publication — manuscript, print, and most recently code — upon how we read, write, and interpret information, textual and otherwise? And how have broader cultural institutions – the publishing industry, practices in editing, and government interventions, to name but a few – impacted on what is written, published, and read?\n\nThis course will explore the broad sweep of book history in its many facets, from early manuscript culture through to the eBook. Much of this course will be “hands-on,” working with the material artifacts or facsimiles of book culture, and we will be spending some time as well examining modern Canadian literary culture and the mechanisms that bring a book from inception to the bookshelf. Short “field trips” and guest lectures will enhance our understanding of the complexity of this enormously large and important subject. 0.5 course\n\nWinter 2025 2091G / 001 M. McDayter Syllabus\n\n2092F - The Many Faces of Harry Potter\n\nThis course will examine the Harry Potter series in relation to the multiple genres that it draws on, including the gothic novel, detective fiction, fantasy, adventure, and the dystopian novel. We will read all seven books alongside other novels and short stories that illustrate the generic conventions Rowling is working with. There will also be opportunity to consider the translation of the series into film. 0.5 course\n\nFall 2024 2092F / 001 G. Ceraldi Syllabus\n\n2100-2999 Level Courses\n\n2000-level courses welcome students into the community of literary scholarship. Literary surveys focus on the development of textual traditions across time while courses in theory introduce students to the multitude of tools available for text analysis. Developing research skills and methods of investigation will allow students to begin to articulate their own questions and to situate their own analysis within the discourse of previous scholarship. Assignments will demand independent study in which students develop and explore their own areas of interest and grapple with the difficulties and challenges of the discipline. For students in an English module, 2000-level courses provide the basic tools necessary for more advanced and independent study. For non-English students, 2000-level courses are an excellent way to complement other modules while indulging in some of the great literature available in the language.

Students are responsible for ensuring that they have successfully completed all course prerequisites and that they have not taken an antirequisite course, as stated in the Academic Calendar.\n\n2112F - Adapting Across Page, Stage, and Screen (cross-listed with Film 2212F and Theatre Studies 2212F) How does the shape an artwork takes contribute to its aesthetic and political power? When artworks flex across form and media how do their messages change? What did Marshall McLuhan mean when he said “the medium is the message”? How do genre and form shape social and political discourse? In this course, students explore these questions and more as they investigate texts that assume multiple cultural forms and represent a diversity of perspectives. 0.5 course\n\nFall 2024 2112F / 001 B. Diemert Syllabus\n\n2191G - Arts for a Damaged Planet - CANCELLED Global heating, species depletion, non-renewable resource dependency, sustainable energies – solutions to these pressing issues will require not just advances in science, new economic policies, and political will. Resolving each of these also will require changes in vision, new stories, and new ways of imagining the present and the future. The arts help us to document and understand the damaged planet we live on, and contribute to transitioning to a future earth we aspire to see. This class introduces students to a wide range of arts for a damaged planet. We will study recent works of fiction, non-fiction, graphic novels, film, and photography that helps to make legible our current planetary condition. This is also a kind of “maker class,” in that we will have short hands-on assignments, creative proposals, and experiential learning practices that involve ourselves in thinking and connecting to our environs in new ways. Our overall goal in this class is to use the arts to develop new ideas and tools to repair the damaged planet. 0.5 course\n\nWinter 2025 2191G / 001 J. Schuster DRAFT Syllabus\n\n2200F - History of Theory and Criticism\n\nThis course offers an introduction to some of the most influential ideas in and about literature and the arts from Plato to the turn of the twentieth century. It will try to take a step back and ask fundamental questions about literature and the arts, as well as about what we are doing when we study them. To quote the German Romantic poetic Friedrich Hölderlin, “Wozu Dichter in dürftiger Zeit?” (“What are poets for in wretched times”—a question for today!).\n\nSo, we’ll ask what literature is for. Why does it matter? Why does studying it matter? What is the nature of truth in literature? What is beauty? How are such central concepts arrived at? What are their implications? 0.5 course\n\nFall 2024 2200F / 001 J. Plug Syllabus\n\n2200G - History of Theory and Criticism JUST ADDED!\n\nAn introduction to important issues in the history of literary criticism and theory from Plato to the twentieth century. 0.5 course\n\nWinter 2025 2200G / 001 J. Schuster Syllabus\n\n2201G - Contemporary Theory and Criticism\n\nThis course builds on the historical foundations of English 2200F/G to concentrate on important issues in contemporary literary theory and criticism. English 2200F/G is recommended as preparation for English 2201F/G. 0.5 course\n\nWinter 2025 2201G / 001 A. Pero Syllabus\n\n2202F - Studies in Poetics\n\nAn introduction to important issues and concepts in the theory and analysis of poetry from different periods. 0.5 course\n\nFall 2024 2202F / 001 N. Joseph Syllabus\n\n2203G - Studies in Narrative Theory\n\nAn introduction to important issues and concepts in the theory and analysis of narrative from different periods. 0.5 course\n\nWinter 2025 2203G / 001 B. Diemert Syllabus\n\n2301E - British Literature Survey\n\nThis survey course charts the history of British and Irish literature through study of its major authors, from the anonymous poet who wrote Beowulf to the very recent Irish novelist Claire Keegan. Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales), John Donne's love poetry and devotional verse, Shakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth, Jane Austen (Sense and Sensibility, Emily Brontë, (Wuthering Heights) and T.S. Eliot are read along the way. 1.0 course\n\nFall/Winter 2301E / 001 J. Doelman Syllabus\n\n2337F - J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis and Friends\n\nThis course explores the popular fiction of J.R.R. Tolkien (The Lord of the Rings) and C.S. Lewis’ Narnia Chronicles and Out of the Silent Planet in relation to the western literary tradition. Both Tolkien and Lewis were highly esteemed literary scholars and their knowledge of classical, medieval and renaissance themes and conventions deeply influenced their major works. At the same time, these novels were very much of the twentieth century, and thus responded to such conflicts as the two world wars and the accelerated pace of technological, social, and cultural change. Their works also draw on the conventions of genre fiction of the twentieth century (science fiction, fantasy and children’s literature). The wider circle of Tolkien and Lewis (sometimes called ‘The Inklings’) also used genre fiction (the detective novel and thriller) to explore deeper issues, and the last weeks of the course will consider works by Charles Williams and Dorothy L. Sayers. 0.5 course\n\nFall 2024 2337F / 001 J. Doelman Syllabus\n\n2401E - American Literature Survey\n\nA survey of American literature from the period of imperial exploration and contact in North America to the postmodern era. In this class, we will read some of the most fascinating literary works of the United States in a variety of modes and genres. We will consider the aesthetic and formal properties of each text and consider how writers were shaped by the social conditions, ideological conflicts, economic forces, and political developments of their times, such as the forced removal of Native Americans and the practice of chattel slavery. As we study the evolution of major artistic movements and periods, we will also trace the development of important assumptions, myths, and fundamental beliefs about the United States that still influence American discourse today.\n\nIn this survey, we will also pay close attention to the voices that are heard—and not heard—in different moments of US history. The pressure of attempting to read 400 years of literary history will force us to pose questions about the limits of the American literary canon. Why do we read what we read, and who benefits from that? How have ideas of what constitutes “literature” (or “America,” for that matter) changed over time? What could lesser-known writers contribute to our understanding of the US nation and its literature? And is it possible to read so-called canonical writers in a way that produces new kinds of knowledge?\n\nReadings will include novels such as Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter, Ernest Hemingway’s In Our Time, and Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar; short fiction by Herman Melville, Henry James, and Leslie Marmon Silko; personal narratives such as Harriet Jacobs’ Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Zitkala-Sa’s Impressions of an Indian Childhood and Henry David Thoreau’s Walden; and poetry by Anne Bradstreet, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Langston Hughes, and Allan Ginsberg. Assignments will include 4 essays, participation quizzes, a library assignment and a final exam. 1.0 course\n\nFall/Winter 2401E / 002 A. MacLean Syllabus\n\n2501E - Canadian Literature Survey\n\nWhat does literature tell us about the making of a nation and its citizens?

Students will encounter a diverse range of genres and authors, from accounts of early explorers to current internationally acclaimed and award-winning writers. 1.0 course\n\nFall/Winter 2501E / 001 M. Jones Syllabus\n\n2601E - Global Literatures in English Survey\n\nThis course offers students a great opportunity to survey of the links between and among different literary traditions and innovations across such diverse geographic regions as Asia, Africa, Australia, South America, and the Caribbean. Through close reading of literary texts written in English, students will explore how cultures produce different--often competing--ways of making meaning. 1.0 course\n\nFall/Winter 2601E / 001 (Evening) N. Bhatia Syllabus\n\n3000-3999 Level Courses\n\n3000-level courses allow students to focus on topics, whether an historical period, a cultural tradition or a literary theme, which pique their own critical curiosity. Class discussions will address the interactions of texts with one another, with their historical moment or with larger social trends. Students will also explore how scholarship has evolved over time and learn how to place their own thought and writing within a developing and ongoing critical tradition. Advanced research skills, tailored to specific critical problems, will allow students to develop habits of independent exploration and analysis which will lead to nuanced and persuasive written work which fully participates in the discipline of English studies. Typically, students in an English module will be enrolled in 3000-level courses in their third and fourth years. A reasonable amount of choice in the modules will allow English students to pursue their own interests while becoming members of an academic community. Students not in English modules will find courses which stimulate their critical imaginations while complementing their own module offerings. Learn more >>\n\nThese courses require prerequisites. Students are responsible for ensuring that they have successfully completed all course prerequisites and that they have not taken an antirequisite course, as stated in the Academic Calendar.\n\n3200F - Feminist Literary Theory\n\nAn introduction to critical debates in twentieth-century feminist literary theory.

Emberley Syllabus\n\n3203G - Human, All Too Human\n\nThis course considers the figure of the posthuman as it emerges in the work of contemporary theorists. Beginning with an attempt to define the posthuman, it will then move to answer a series of critical questions regarding what is at stake in posthumanism’s critique of the humanist subject. 0.5 course\n\nWinter 2025 3203G / 001 J. Boulter Syllabus\n\n3204F - Critical Race Theory (cross-listed with GSWS 3324F)\n\nThis course explores key concepts in critical race theory, focusing on: cultural constructions of race and their connection to settler colonialism and imperialism; the links between race, class, gender, and sexuality; processes of racialization; whiteness as an “invisible” category; the hypervisibility of racialized subjects; and anti-racist cultural production. 0.5 course\n\nFall 2024 3204F / 001 E. Lawson Syllabus\n\n3300 - History of English Language\n\nA study of the historical development of English phonology, morphology, orthography and syntax from Old English to the modern period.

Moll Syllabus\n\n3315E - Disenchanted Chaucer: Authority and Literature in Medieval England\n\nPlague, famine, and rebellion marked the 1300s in England. In this time of crisis, many people questioned the authority of the institutions, church and crown, that governed daily life and the social order. This course will explore the idea of authority and the many ways in which authority was criticized, challenged, and subverted in the writings of Geoffrey Chaucer and his contemporaries, in a wide range of genres, including romance, dream vision, drama, and satire. 1.0 course\n\nFall/Winter 3315E / 001 A. Schuurman Syllabus\n\n3320F - Desire in the Renaissance (cross-listed with GSWS 3324F)\n\nThis course will examine the profuse complexity of Renaissance love poetry. Love poems were transgressive, fantastical, and even political. They allowed both men and women to break through cultural and religious restrictions on the expression of desire, and gave them a language to discuss gendered and political dynamics of dominance and submission.\n\nIn this course, I’m especially interested in the idea of “writing back.” While we’ll take care to establish the normative language of desire, we’ll also think extensively about how writers transgress that language. We’ll ask questions such as: How do women writers establish themselves as desiring subjects using the patriarchal discourses of Petrarchism and Neoplatonism? How do both male and female writers destablize normative gender hierarchies, express same-sex desires, and even gesture towards non-binary identities? How do Renaissance writers respond to and reshape traditional narratives of desire in ways that allow us, today, to reflect on our own increasingly multidimensional experience of desire, gender, and sexuality? 0.5 course\n\nFall 2024 3320F / 001 M. Bassnett Syllabus\n\n3326G - Death in the RenaissanceDrawing on poetry, drama and prose, this course will consider a range of literary responses to death during the period 1590 to 1670. It will begin with discussion of the period’s funeral and mourning customs, and then turn to such works as Shakespeare’s Hamlet, John Donne’s devotional poetry and his “Death’s Duel” (described by some as his own funeral sermon), a range of funeral elegies (including John Milton’s “Lycidas” and selections from Paradise Lost) and Sir Thomas Browne’s meditation on ancient Roman burial urns Urn Burial. As student interests lead, we may also relate these literary works to depictions of death in the visual arts and to funeral music from the period. 0.5 course\n\nWinter 2025 3326G / 001 J. Doelman Syllabus\n\n3330E - Shakespeare\n\nShakespeare has inspired poems, novels, films, and new drama, and his plays remain a touchstone of artistic achievement, both on the stage and the page. There is also much to interrogate about Shakespeare’s place in the canon of literature in English. This course, taught by one of the department’s awarding-winning professors, will introduce you to twelve of Shakespeare’s plays. We will study comedies, histories, and tragedies, beginning with Richard II, which we will see at the brilliant new Patterson Theatre at the Stratford Festival. There will be emphasis on the plays in production and students will be given the interpretive tools and confidence to make Shakespeare their own. 1.0 course\n\nFall/Winter 3330E / 001 J. Purkis Syllabus\n\n3331G - Adapting Shakespeare\n\nShakespeare invented few of the plots of his plays; instead he used others’ writing. Later artists (including stage and film directors, playwrights, and novelists) have likewise drawn on Shakespeare's plays as inspiration. This half-course explores this range of “Shakespearean adaptation” through close study of two or three major plays. 1.0 course\n\nWinter 2025 3331G / 001 J. Purkis Syllabus\n\n3341F - Sex, Death, and Philosophy: Libertinism and Eighteenth-Century British Literature\n\nThe restoration of the monarchy in 1660 ushered in a new and sometimes frightening era of philosophical, social, and sexual freedom. This course explores Libertinism, a subversive doctrine that challenged cultural and sexual norms, through the poems, plays, and prose of the late 17th and early 18th centuries. 0.5 course\n\nFall 2024 3341F / 001 M.

What shadows did revolution cast upon the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries? This course examines a range of texts that reflect Romantic and post-Romantic transformations, upheavals, and reversals in aesthetic, socio-political, scientific, and/or psychological thought and writing. 0.5 course\n\nWinter 2025 3351G / 001 M. Lee Syllabus\n\n3352G - Am I to Be the Hero of My Own Life? Nineteenth-Century Fictions of the Individual and the World Nineteenth century philosophers celebrated the individual, but the period also saw the emergence of new forms of social control in politics, the market, and the workplace. This course examines the individual’s relation to society and the world in nineteenth-century English literature. Besides fiction, it may include poetry, drama, and non-fiction. 0.5 course\n\nWinter 2025 3352G / 001 J. Devereux Syllabus\n\n3362F - Endless Forms: Life Sciences and Nineteenth-Century Literature\n\nThis course will study the changing relation between human and non-human animals in the nineteenth century and the emergent concept of history as driven by competition between species. Our key texts will take up this topic in very different ways. We will study Charles Darwin’s The Origin of Species (1859), one of the most important scientific works ever published. We will examine fantasy and nonsense literature by Lewis Carroll (Alice in Wonderland) and Edward Lear (Nonsense Verse) published after Darwin’s book that enters the changed terrain of human-animal relations. And we will finish with a late-Victorian Gothic novel that imagines history as a contest for supremacy between biological populations, Bram Stoker’s pathbreaking Gothic novel Dracula (1897). We will also study contextual material on the species debate and on Victorian theories of race and gender. 0.5 course\n\nFall 2024 3362F / 001 M. Rowlinson Syllabus\n\n3371F - Contemporary Experimental Literature (cross-listed with ARTHUM 3393F) - CANCELLED Several contemporary poets and fiction writers express a profound dissatisfaction with traditional literary genres, preferring to focus on radical innovations in technique. This course examines a range of texts that offer a more clinical approach to writing, inspired by such structures as dreams, arbitrary constraints, and game theory. 0.5 course\n\nFall 2024 3371F / 001 J. Boulter Syllabus\n\n3480F - Reading (North) America Now: What is Literary Activism? (cross-listed with ARTHUM 3393F) Can literature help us confront the most urgent injustices and pressing crises of our time? Can aesthetic responses to racial, colonial, and ecological violence motivate interventionist action? Is there such a thing as “literary activism”? These are some of the questions that will guide our study of art and activist movements in Canada and the US. In this course we will examine aesthetic strategies employed by authors, artists, and critics who frame their creative work in activist terms. In particular, we will ask what applicable resources North American literary history can offer when confronting structural inequality, systemic racism, and climate upheaval as interconnected humanist failures. Drawing on such resources, we will endeavour to test both the limits and possibilities of literary activism in the context of climate justice. 0.5 course\n\nFall 2024 3480F / 001 K. Stanley Syllabus\n\n3490G - American DramaWhat is America, as a theatrical idea? How does the stage reflect the nation, its myths and aspirations? This course explores theatre as a “public art” form in the modern and contemporary United States, reading a variety of dramatists that may include Hansberry, Kushner, Miller, O’Neill, Parks, Williams, and Wilson. 0.5 course\n\nWinter 2025 3490G / 001 A. MacLean Syllabus\n\n3579F - Topics in Canadian Literature: Theatre Ghosts (cross-listed with Theatre Studies 3951F) Did you know the theatres in Southwestern Ontario are haunted? This region of the country is particularly famous for its gothic narratives. In this welcoming and open fall class, we'll discuss the ghosts of the area's past and explore SWO’s most notable gothic playwrights. We'll read and go see productions in Stratford, London, and Blyth –as well as meet the artists behind their creation. Drawing from materialist, decolonial, and feminist theories, we’ll examine the spookiest corners of Western theatre archives. Join us as we capture a few spirits to better understand the diversity of voices found among the farms, along the lake shore, and on SWO stages. 0.5 course\n\nFall 2024 3579F / 001 T.

Emberley Syllabus\n\n4000 Level Courses\n\n4000-level courses are designed for Honours students (whether those in an HSP or a Double Major). Fourth-year, non-Honours students with a 70% average may also enroll in 4000-level courses. These courses typically explore narrowly defined topics: a particular work or author, a brief historical moment, or a clearly defined theoretical issue. Students and faculty will engage with the texts at hand and the surrounding critical tradition. Deploying and expanding their critical skills, students will find and explore their own research questions while situating their argument within an ongoing conversation. 4000-level seminars are an opportunity for sustained, independent study within the structure of a communal seminar. The small, seminar setting prepares English students for continued study at the graduate level. 4000-level courses are typically not suitable for students not in English modules unless the topic specifically compliments the student’s work in their home module.

MacLean Syllabus\n\n4472F - Seminar in American Literature: Give Me Liberty, Or Give Me Death: 20th Century American Novels (Huron University College)\n\nThe most infamous line of the Declaration of Independence sets up a quintessential paradox within the American imaginary that all people “are created equal,” and, yet, that citizens also possess the “unalienable Rights” of “Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” While equality and liberty might seemingly appear to be mutually compatible (and desirable) goals, this seminar examines influential 20th century American novels that take up the fight for equality and the dangers of unfettered liberty. It will examine the ways in which rhetoric of liberty has shifted from Patrick Henry’s notorious call to “Give me liberty, or give me death!” in 1775 during the Revolutionary War to Malcolm X’s declaration that 1964 was the year of “the Ballot or the bullet” to former President Donald Trump’s claim in 2020 that “Republicans are the party of Liberty, Equality, and Justice for All.” How is discourse of liberty used to both promote civil rights’ agendas and to counteract them? This seminar explores the tension between equality and liberty by considering novels that are both catalysts for, and products of, the major socio-political transformations of the 20th century in the United States, including the women’s liberation movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the gay liberation movement, the Native American Renaissance, and the Mad movement. Students will be introduced to some of the major thematic concerns of American literature, as well as study the formal elements of the novel as a medium, in order to develop their own individualized research project on a topic of their choosing. Potential authors to be included on the syllabus include, but are not limited to: Malcolm X, Kate Chopin, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Toni Morrison, Sylvia Plath, James Baldwin, Leslie Marmon Silko, W.E.B. DuBois, and Viet Thanh Nguyen. 0.5 course\n\nFall 2024 4472F / 550 S. Blanchette See HUC\n\n4771G - Seminar in Literary Studies: Making Decolonial Shakespeares (cross-listed with ENGLISH 9224B) This half-year graduate seminar will introduce students to the “decolonial turn” in Shakespeare and early modern cultural studies, with a specific focus on the contributions of women-identifying artists (including AFAB, trans, Indigenous, POC, Black, and disabled artists). We will begin by unpacking what we talk about when we talk about “Shakespeare”, examining the ways in which that figure became central first to the labour of the British Empire, including the creation of “white” identities, and then through the long 20th centuryl to the Anglo-American cultural economy. We will then look to recent explorations of Shakespeare and race, Indigeneity, ability, gender identity, and more – both in the scholarly literature and, more importantly, in contemporary performance work.\n\nCase studies will include Adjua Andoh and Lynette Linton’s Richard II at Shakespeare’s Globe (2019); Emma Frankland’s Galatea at the 2023 Brighton Festival; WhyNot Theatre’s Prince Hamlet (2019), and Jani Lauzon and Kaitlyn Riordian’s 1939 at the Stratford Festival (2022). In addition to reading literature and viewing performances, students can expect to hear directly from artists about their work, their rehearsal and creation processes, and their political projects, as well as to learn some of the processes, both ethical and scholarly, associated with ethnographic research in the arts and humanities.

We study the development and characteristics of different forms of popular music, including blues, jazz, folk, punk, and hip hop. We look at how popular music and musicians have been represented in other cultural media, including literature, film, and critical theory. 0.5 course\n\nWinter 2025 4851G / 550 J. Vanderheide See HUC\n\n4871F - Creative Writing Seminar (cross-listed with Writing 4880F)\n\nTheory meets creative writing. We will read passages from over 2000 years of theoretical work, ranging from such thinkers as Aristotle and Longinus to Gerard Genette, from classical considerations of rhetoric to discussions of what constitutes the fantastic (no prior theoretical knowledge is required). The readings will be grouped into four modules: defamiliarization or estrangement, language as material, and détournement; Todorov’s definition of the fantastic, his notion of hesitation, and the uncanny; the sublime; and narratology, specifically focalisation and different kinds of discourse. Using the readings as constraints, we will write four creative pieces in different genres. The objective is to become better writers by having more tools at our disposal. 0.5 course\n\nFall 2024 4871F / 001 M. Fox Syllabus\n\n4880F - Seminar in Literary Studies: Disruptive Bodies: Movement as Metaphor (King's University College)\n\nWhy were traditional dances suppressed by colonial regimes? Why are dances reclaimed at moments of cultural renewal? What are the connections between the choreography of social dances and bids for cultural and political power? Reading fiction (written in English) from different cultures, students will examine how gender and racial identity are represented through the movements of dancing bodies, and how dance as a trope can express reinforcement of the social order as well as its disruption. 0.5 course\n\nWinter 2025 4851G / 570 S. Natarajan See KUC\n\n4881F - Seminar in Literary Studies: Stratford as Hub of Canadian Literature and Drama (King's University College)\n\nThis course will begin by considering the massive impact of the Stratford Festival Theatre, the Stratford International Film Festival, and the Stratford Music Festival on the post-Second World War circuits of festival culture. Our class will travel to the Stratford Festival to attend same-day performances of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet and Andrea Scott’s Get That Hope, the world premier of a play about Jamaican Canadians. We will explore the tensions between cosmopolitanism, nationalism, and localism in theatre criticism about the Stratford Festival. Subsequently, we will examine how Stratford became a focal point of two intersecting literary traditions in Canada, the Shakespearean (J.D. Barnett, Kathleen and Robina Lizars, Timothy Findley) and Southern Ontario Gothic (James Reaney, Margaret Atwood, Alice Munro, Adrew Pyper). We will also investigate the less canonical contributions of Indigenous, Black, and Jewish artists to this cultural hub. 0.5 course\n\nFall 2024 4881F / 570 I.
