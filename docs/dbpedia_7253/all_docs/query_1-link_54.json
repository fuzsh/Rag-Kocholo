        "text": "There are dozens of different book genres, from adventure fiction to self-help books. Many books fall into multiple or crossover genres, such as fantasy and science fiction, or crime and mystery novels.\n\nEach type of book or book genre has a different audience, ideal word count, and price point. If youâre thinking about writing genre fiction, itâs a good idea to know the conventions for your chosen genre before you start writing or planning your book.\n\nHereâs everything you need to know about the different types of books.\n\nWhat are the different types of books?\n\nHereâs a rundown of every main book genre, including 19 fiction and 5 non-fiction book types:\n\nFiction\n\nAdventure stories\n\nClassics\n\nCrime\n\nFairy tales, fables, and folk tales\n\nFantasy\n\nHistorical fiction\n\nHorror\n\nHumour and satire\n\nLiterary fiction\n\nMystery\n\nPoetry\n\nPlays\n\nRomance\n\nScience fiction\n\nShort stories\n\nThrillers\n\nWar\n\nWomenâs fiction\n\nYoung adult\n\nNon-fiction\n\nAutobiography and memoir\n\nBiography\n\nEssays\n\nNon-fiction novel\n\nSelf-help\n\nWhatâs the most popular book genre?\n\nAll readers have different tastes, so itâs tricky to determine which book genre is most popular. However, taking a look at the all-time bestseller list (excluding religious texts) sheds some light on book genre popularity:\n\nâ*Figures taken from Wikipedia in December 2023. Rounded to the nearest million books sold.\n\nWith nearly half of these bestsellers falling into the fantasy genre, this is arguably the most popular type of book among readers. This is backed up by the popularity of series like Harry Potter, Lord Of The Rings, and A Song Of Ice And Fire.\n\nUnderstanding the importance of book genres\n\nGenre is essential information for readers and publishers. It helps readers know at a glance if theyâre interested in reading a book, and helps publishers understand the marketability of a book. Itâs even important for categorising your book when it eventually hits bookshop shelves.\n\nAs a writer, you need to understand the different types of books so you can:\n\nFulfill reader expectations â Each genre comes with specific expectations (for example, mystery books must include a puzzle that needs to be solved). Donât leave readers disappointed by mischaracterising your book.\n\nWrite something new â Getting a good grounding of other books in your genre will help you write an original story that doesnât follow the same old tropes.\n\nGet published â Knowing which genre(s) your book falls into will help you sell it to publishers (or readers if youâre self-publishing).\n\nEvery book genre, explained\n\nLetâs take a look at each of the major types of books in more depth, with key information for writers looking to explore each genre including bestselling book examples and the average price for each kind of book.\n\n1. Adventure stories\n\nAdventure novels whisk readers off to faraway lands. Unlike fantasy novels, they tend to stay in the real world (although thereâs often a lot of crossover between these genres). Childrenâs novels often fall into the adventure category, since theyâre designed to spark imaginations.\n\nAdventure story bestsellers:\n\nThe Little Prince â Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry\n\nShe: A History of Adventure â H. Rider Haggard\n\nThe Alchemist â Paulo Coelho\n\nNumber of adventure books available on Amazon: 60,000+\n\nAverage word count: 96,000 words\n\nAverage price for a paperback adventure book: Â£8.99\n\n2. Classics\n\nClassics encompass a range of book genres, but they always stand the test of time. Classics include centuries-old stories like Homerâs Odyssey, but also more modern novels that have drawn significant acclaim and attention, such as Margaret Atwoodâs The Handmaidâs Tale and George Orwellâs 1984.\n\nClassic fiction bestsellers:\n\nA Tale Of Two Cities â Charles Dickens\n\nDream Of The Red Chamber â Cao Xueqin\n\nThe Catcher in the Rye â JD Salinger\n\nNumber of classic books available on Amazon: 60,000+\n\nAverage word count: 96,000 words\n\nAverage price for a paperback classics book: Â£6.88\n\n3. Crime\n\nFrom murder mysteries to true crime stories, crime is an ever popular genre of books. It tells sinister stories of wrongdoing, and the search for justice. This genre can be very lucrative, with many authors becoming household names, such as Agatha Christie, Val McDermid, and Harlan Coben.\n\nCrime bestsellers:\n\nAnd Then There Were None â Agatha Christie\n\nThe Godfather â Mario Puzo\n\nGone Girl â Gillian Flynn\n\nNumber of crime novels available on Amazon: 70,000+\n\nAverage word count: 89,000 words\n\nAverage price for a paperback crime novel: Â£8.94\n\n4. Fairy tales, fables, and folk tales\n\nFolk tales date back to ancient times, with Aesop being perhaps the most famous curator of these short-form stories. Many fairy tales are of unknown origin, but have survived through retellings down the generations. Modern fairy tale writers like Angela Carter put a contemporary spin on traditional tales.\n\nFairy tale bestsellers:\n\nThe Adventures of Pinocchio â Carlo Collodi\n\nJonathan Livingston Seagull â Richard Bach\n\nâNumber of fairy and folk tale anthologies available on Amazon: 3,000+\n\nAverage word count: 30,000 words\n\nAverage price for a paperback book of fairy tales: Â£10.66\n\n5. Fantasy\n\nFantasy may be the most popular modern book genre. Thanks to series like Harry Potter and Percy Jackson, itâs particularly popular with young adult readers, although more and more fantasy novels are written for adults (George RR Martin, weâre looking at you). These stories take readers on a journey beyond the known world, to places conjured in the authorâs imagination.\n\nFantasy bestsellers:\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone â JK Rowling\n\nThe Hobbit â JRR Tolkien\n\nThe Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe â CS Lewis\n\nNumber of fantasy books available on Amazon: 60,000+\n\nAverage word count: 109,000 words\n\nAverage price for a paperback fantasy book: Â£10.44\n\n6. Historical fiction\n\nAuthors like Hilary Mantel and Toni Morrison have popularised the historical fiction genre in recent years. These books give readers a glimpse into the past, with many stories set in times of great conflict and change.\n\nHistorical fiction bestsellers:\n\nA Tale Of Two Cities â Charles Dickens\n\nBen-Hur: A Tale of the Christ â Lew Wallace\n\nThe Name of the Rose â Umberto Eco\n\nNumber of historical fiction books available on Amazon: 70,000+\n\nAverage word count: 102,000 words\n\nAverage price for a paperback historical fiction book: Â£8.99\n\n7. Horror\n\nPeople never tire of being terrified â so horror novels remain some of the bestselling books in the world. While the genre has origins in Gothic stories like Mary Shelleyâs Frankenstein, authors like Stephen King and R L Stine have modernised horror for adults and children alike. The genre has also spawned hundreds of popular horror movies based on books.\n\nHorror bestsellers:\n\nFlowers in the Attic â VC Andrews\n\nRebecca â Daphne Du Maurier\n\nJaws â Peter Benchley\n\nâNumber of horror books available on Amazon: 70,000+\n\nAverage word count: 102,000 words\n\nAverage price for a paperback horror novel: Â£8.89\n\n8. Humour and satire\n\nFrom dark dystopian satire like A Clockwork Orange to comedic memoirs, the humour genre of books spans a range of titles. Comedy writing is a real art, so this genre can be hard to pull off for new writers â but a funny book is truly unputdownable.\n\nHumour bestsellers:\n\nAnimal Farm â George Orwell\n\nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn â Mark Twain\n\nThe Good Soldier Å vejk â Jaroslav HaÅ¡ek\n\nNumber of humour books available on Amazon: 70,000+\n\nAverage word count: No data available\n\nAverage price for a paperback humour novel: Â£8.89\n\n9. Literary fiction\n\nLiterary fiction is reserved for books that donât slot neatly into more traditional genres, although it can also be used to differentiate from lighter fiction. Most literary fiction books are character-driven rather than plot-driven, so they tend to be more introspective and meandering.\n\nLiterary fiction bestsellers:\n\nThe Catcher in the Rye â JD Salinger\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird â Harper Lee\n\nWar and Peace â Leo Tolstoy\n\nNumber of literary fiction books available on Amazon: 80,000+\n\nAverage word count: 98,000 words\n\nAverage price for a paperback literary fiction novel: Â£8.99\n\n10. Mystery\n\nMystery is often seen as a subset of the crime genre, but itâs so popular and enduring that it deserves a category of its own. Agatha Christie, master of the whodunit, is the second best selling author in history, after William Shakespeare. Mysteries are full of suspense, and usually keep the reader guessing until the last moment.\n\nMystery bestsellers:\n\nAnd Then There Were None â Agatha Christie\n\nThe Da Vinci Code â Dan Brown\n\nAngels & Demons â Dan Brown\n\nNumber of mystery books available on Amazon: 70,000+\n\nAverage word count: 91,000 words\n\nAverage price for a paperback mystery novel: Â£8.99\n\n11. Poetry\n\nPoetry is completely different to novels in form, structure, and style. It contains a wealth of genres in itself, from nonsense verse to war poetry. Poetry has fallen somewhat out of favour in modern book sales, though poets like Amanda Gorman and Ocean Vuong are repopularising the form.\n\nBestselling poets:\n\nWilliam Shakespeare\n\nAlexander Pushkin\n\nRoald Dahl\n\nNumber of poetry books available on Amazon: 30,000+\n\nAverage word count: No data available\n\nAverage price for a paperback poetry collection: Â£10.19\n\n12. Plays\n\nPlays are written to be performed rather than read, but theyâre still seen as a key literary genre. This is largely due to the enduring popularity of Shakespeareâs plays, as well as other theatrical greats like Tennessee Williamsâs A Streetcar Named Desire and Oscar Wildeâs Salome.\n\nBest selling playwrights:\n\nWilliam Shakespeare\n\nAlexander Pushkin\n\nNumber of playscript books available on Amazon: 60,000+\n\nAverage page count: 90-130 pages\n\nAverage price for a paperback playscript: Â£11.36\n\n13. Romance\n\nEveryone enjoys a good love story â which is why romance novels are one of the most popular types of books. Romance authors Barbara Cartland and Danielle Steel are the third and fourth bestselling fiction writers, with more than 2 billion book sales between them. Even non-romance novels often have a romantic arc at their centre, proving that love and relationships are central to many great stories.\n\nRomance bestsellers:\n\nThe Bridges of Madison County â Robert James Waller\n\nLove Story â Erich Segal\n\nThe Fault in Our Stars â John Green\n\nNumber of romance books available on Amazon: 60,000+\n\nAverage word count: 91,000 words\n\nAverage price for a paperback romance novel: Â£8.99\n\n14. Science fiction\n\nFrom Stan Lee to Ursula K Le Guin, thereâs no shortage of famous sci-fi writers. The genre has grown in popularity thanks to the boom in science fiction films based on books, such as Dune and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Sci-fi is often combined with fantasy, and there are some similarities between these types of books. But sci-fi books are usually bound by the laws of science as we know them in the real world.\n\nSci-fi bestsellers:\n\nNineteen Eighty-Four â George Orwell\n\nDune â Frank Herbert\n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy â Douglas Adams\n\nNumber of sci-fi books available on Amazon: 60,000+\n\nAverage word count: 98,000 words\n\nAverage price for a paperback sci-fi novel: Â£8.16\n\n15. Short stories and novellas\n\nShort stories are often found in anthologies or collections, which can be by the same or a variety of authors. Like poetry, short stories tend to be less popular with modern readers, though they remain popular with writers.\n\nShort story bestsellers:\n\nJames Bond stories â Ian Fleming\n\nPerry Mason stories â Erle Stanley Gardner\n\nJack Reacher â Lee Child\n\nNumber of short story collections available on Amazon: 60,000+\n\nAverage word count: 30,000 words\n\nAverage price for a paperback short story collection: Â£10.19\n\n16. Thrillers\n\nThrillers are your typical page-turners. Full of action and suspense, thrillers can also often cross genres, particularly with crime and mystery. John Grisham, Stieg Larsson, and Gillian Flynn are some of the most popular thriller authors writing today, with Flynnâs Gone Girl among the top three bestselling books in the genre.\n\nThriller bestsellers:\n\nThe Eagle Has Landed â Jack Higgins\n\nThe Girl on the Train â Paula Hawkins\n\nGone Girl â Gillian Flynn\n\nNumber of thriller books available on Amazon: 60,000+\n\nAverage word count: 91,000 words\n\nAverage price for a paperback thriller novel: Â£8.99\n\n17. War\n\nWar is a formative experience on an individual, national, and international level. Perhaps thatâs why stories of war fascinate readers the world over, and remain such an enduring theme in modern fiction. War stories are often (though not always) a subset of historical fiction.\n\nWar bestsellers:\n\nThe Eagle Has Landed â Jack Higgins\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front â Eric Maria Remarque\n\nAll the Light We Cannot See â Anthony Doerr\n\nNumber of war novels available on Amazon: 40,000+\n\nAverage word count: 102,000 words\n\nAverage price for a paperback war novel: Â£8.99\n\n18. Womenâs fiction\n\nWomenâs fiction describes books that centre on the experiences and actions of female characters. It can be a controversial term â not everyone agrees with generalising fiction on a gendered basis â but itâs a common way for publishers to market these books. So authors should be aware of it as a genre in its own right. Womenâs fiction encompasses books as wide-ranging as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichieâs Americana to Jojo Moyesâs Me Before You.\n\nWomenâs fiction bestsellers:\n\nThe Women's Room â Marilyn French\n\nPride and Prejudice â Jane Austen\n\nFear of Flying â Erica Jong\n\nNumber of womenâs fiction novels available on Amazon: 60,000+\n\nAverage word count: 94,000 words\n\nAverage price for a paperback womenâs fiction novel: Â£8.99\n\n19. Young adult fiction\n\nDespite being targeted at 13-18 year olds, young adult books have sold more than perhaps any other genre in recent years. This is thanks to hugely popular series like Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, and Twilight. YA books often have a secondary genre, too â Harry Potter and Twilight, for example, are fantasy novels, while John Greenâs The Fault In Our Stars is a romance.\n\nYA fiction bestsellers:\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone â JK Rowling\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets â JK Rowling\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban â JK Rowling\n\nNumber of YA fiction novels available on Amazon: 70,000+\n\nAverage word count: 70,000 words\n\nAverage price for a paperback YA fiction novel: Â£9.39\n\n20. Autobiography and memoir\n\nMemoirs and autobiographies are popular among self-publishing writers who have incredible life stories to share. Many famous figures also write autobiographies, or hire a ghostwriter to write one on their behalf, giving fans a glimpse into their lives.\n\nAutobiography and memoir bestsellers:\n\nThe Diary of Anne Frank â Anne Frank\n\nAutobiography of a Yogi â Paramahansa Yogananda\n\nWolf Totem â Jiang Rong\n\nNumber of autobiography books available on Amazon: 70,000+\n\nAverage word count: No data available\n\nAverage price for a paperback autobiography: Â£9.99\n\n21. Biography\n\nThere are millions of real-life stories out there just waiting to be told. Unlike autobiographies and memoirs, which the author writes about themselves, biographies tell the story of someone elseâs life. These are often famous people â Irving Stoneâs Lust For Life, for example, is a biographical novel about Vincent Van Gogh â but they can also be people you know, or lesser-known individuals of interest.\n\nBiographical bestsellers:\n\nLust for Life â Irving Stone\n\nDiana: Her True Story â Andrew Morton\n\nWild Swans â Jung Chang\n\nNumber of biography books available on Amazon: 80,000+\n\nAverage word count: No data available\n\nAverage price for a paperback biography: Â£9.99\n\n22. Essays\n\nEssays are more academic than other forms of writing. They tend to follow a thesis set by the author, and elaborate on their perspective on a particular topic or theme. Essays can be book-length (such as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichieâs We Should All Be Feminists), or part of an essay collection (such as James Baldwinâs Notes of a Native Son).\n\nEssay collection bestsellers:\n\nThe Hite Report â Shere Hite\n\nA Message to Garcia â Elbert Hubbard\n\nNumber of essay collections available on Amazon: 60,000+\n\nAverage word count: No data available\n\nAverage price for a paperback essay collection: Â£9.07\n\n23. Non-fiction novels\n\nNon-fiction novels blur the line between fiction and reality. While the facts stay intact, the form and style is closer to that of a traditional fiction book. Non-fiction novels use character and other literary devices to tell a true story. Truman Capoteâs In Cold Blood is a classic example of a non-fiction novel.\n\nNon-fiction novel examples:\n\nHelter Skelter â Curt Gentry and Vincent Bugliosi\n\nIn Cold Blood â Truman Capote\n\nBury My Heart at Wounded Knee â Dee Brown\n\nNumber of non-fiction novels available on Amazon: 50,000+\n\nAverage word count: No data available\n\nAverage price for a non-fiction novel: Â£9.99\n\n24. Self-help books\n\nSelf-help books are probably the most popular modern non-fiction genre, since they offer the promise of self-improvement and healing. This also tends to make them a little more expensive than other genres. Books like Dale Carnegieâs How To Win Friends and Influence People have become part of the modern self-help canon.\n\nSelf-help book bestsellers:\n\nYou Can Heal Your Life â Louise Hay\n\nThe Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care â Benjamin Spock\n\nYour Erroneous Zones â Wayne Dyer\n\nNumber of self-help books available on Amazon: 70,000+\n\nAverage word count: No data available\n\nAverage price for a paperback self-help book: Â£12.27\n\nWhich book genre should you write?\n\nMost writers naturally gravitate towards writing in a genre they enjoy reading. And while being well-read in a genre is important, itâs also helpful to learn more about the commercial aspects of your chosen type of book. This includes marketability, competition, and price points.\n\nFor example, non-fiction novels have fallen out of favour in recent years, but similar categories like historical fiction and autobiography are still very popular. So think about how you want to position your book, and the nuances of your chosen genre.\n\nLearning more about your preferred genre helps you understand the market for your book, which is especially important when it comes to self-publishing your work.\n\nNow you know a little more about your chosen genre, itâs time to plan your new book. Find out how to write a book outline â itâs a failsafe way to plan a book in any genre.\n\nFor the average price per paperback we calculated the average price of the top 10 featured books in the category."
