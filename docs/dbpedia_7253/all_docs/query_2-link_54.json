        "text": "Research from Catalyst and around the world has found that diversity and inclusion benefit individuals, organizations, teams, and society. The following data and findings are selected from a vast body of research on the benefits of diversity and inclusion in the workplace, with an emphasis on studies published in the last few years. This list is not exhaustive. For a selection of earlier research on this topic, see: Catalyst, Why Diversity Matters (July 23, 2013).\n\nCatalyst has organized these findings into four areas in which diversity and inclusion have significant impact: talent, innovation and group performance, reputation and responsibility, and financial performance.\n\nTALENT\n\nDiverse Organizations Are More Successful at Recruiting and Retaining Talent\n\nCompanies with higher levels of gender diversity and with HR policies and practices that focus on gender diversity are linked to lower levels of employee turnover.\n\nWomen are more likely to express interest in an organization and perceive it as fair when women are highly represented in top management positions.\n\nAn inclusive environment is especially important for employees of color. Fifty to sixty-nine percent of professional Canadians of color who anticipate or consciously prepare for potential bias report a high intent to leave their jobs.\n\nEmployee experiences of inclusion contribute to engagement and retention.\n\nThirty-five percent of an employee’s emotional investment to their work and 20% of their desire to stay at their organization is linked to feelings of inclusion.\n\nInclusive Workplaces Maximize Talent and Productivity\n\nOrganizations with strong “diversity climates” (i.e., inclusive work cultures characterized by appreciation of individual differences and the adoption of practices to advance underrepresented groups) are likely to increase employees’ job satisfaction and commitment to the company.\n\nStrong diversity climates are also associated with reduced instances of interpersonal aggression and discrimination.\n\nWomen experience less discrimination and sexual harassment in inclusive workplace cultures.\n\nWhen employees feel both included and that their employer supports diversity, they report experiencing trust and increased engagement at work.\n\nA 10% increase in perceptions of inclusion improves absenteeism, adding nearly one day a year in work attendance per employee.\n\nINNOVATION AND GROUP PERFORMANCE\n\nDiverse Teams Are Critical for Innovation\n\nWhen companies establish inclusive business cultures and policies, they are more likely to report:\n\n59.1% increase in creativity, innovation, and openness.\n\n37.9% better assessment of consumer interest and demand.\n\nDiverse management teams are innovative and earn a premium for their innovation. According to one recent study, over a period of three years companies with higher diversity in management earned 38% more of their revenues, on average, from innovative products and services than those companies with lower diversity.\n\nDiversity in gender, country of origin, career path, and industry background among managers are all highly linked to innovation.\n\nDiversity Reduces Groupthink and Enhances Decision-Making\n\nDiversity is a key ingredient for better decision-making among teams. Homogenous groups may be susceptible to groupthink, while diverse teams can leverage a greater variety of perspectives and are likely to consider information more thoroughly and accurately.\n\nTeams that include different viewpoints or thinking styles (cognitive diversity) solve problems faster and produce more and higher-quality intellectual property such as patents.\n\nMixed-gender teams can better manage group conflict compared to homogenous teams and can better maximize creativity among team members.\n\nInclusion Is Key to Team Performance\n\nIncreasing the representation of women on sales teams contributes to improved team performance through enhanced relational skills and organizational citizenship behaviors, among other factors. However, teams are more likely to reap the benefits of diversity on team performance when inclusion is part of the organizational culture.\n\nEmployees experience inclusion at work when they feel valued, trusted, authentic, and psychologically safe.\n\nOverall experiences of inclusion explain:\n\n49% of team problem-solving.\n\n18% of employee innovation.\n\nOrganizations can maximize the benefits of diversity in teams by cultivating “diversity mindsets,” defined as the shared understanding of a team’s diversity and its positive benefits to group performance.\n\nKey characteristics of effective diversity mindsets include cultural intelligence, openness to different ideas and experiences, multicultural experiences, and work climates that emphasize the value and potential of diversity.\n\nREPUTATION AND RESPONSIBILITY\n\nInclusion Boosts Company Reputation\n\nOrganizations with inclusive business cultures and practices are 57.8% more likely to improve their reputations.\n\nConsumers are more likely to purchase, or consider purchasing, a product after viewing an advertisement perceived to be diverse or inclusive.\n\nEmployees who view their workplace as inclusive are also likely to consider their organization to have ethical value.\n\nIn economic downturns, companies recognize that investment in diversity contributes to public goodwill. An analysis of organizations during the Great Recession of 2008 found that investment in diversity tended to increase, even when other Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities decreased.\n\nMixed-Gender Boards Have Fewer Instances of Fraud\n\nGender-diverse corporate boards are associated with:\n\nEffective risk-management practices. Adding women to a board can improve investment efficiency and prevent risky overinvestment decisions as well as reduce the overconfidence of male CEOs.\n\nIncreased engagement among board members, including behavior like requesting additional information or updates on subjects being discussed and acting on specific tasks after board meetings.\n\nFewer financial reporting mistakes and controversial business practices such as fraud and earnings manipulation.\n\nInvestment in higher-quality audits.\n\nCompanies with gender-diverse management teams experience fewer operations-related lawsuits.\n\nBoardroom Diversity Strengthens Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Performance\n\nWhen corporate boards include members with diverse backgrounds and experiences, they are better able to recognize the needs and interests of different stakeholder groups.\n\nGender-diverse boards outperform non-diverse boards in ESG activities.\n\nWomen board directors are more likely than men to identify social issues like human rights, climate change, and income inequality as critical to corporate strategy.\n\nGender-diverse boards also tend to adopt more progressive organizational management practices, such as work-life support programs, which increase employee satisfaction.\n\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n\nA Note About the Business Case and Financial Performance\n\nAlthough Catalyst has produced research and tools about making the case, more recently, Catalyst and others have encouraged companies to “get beyond the business case for diversity.” The business case grew out of a need to explain the business benefits—especially financial benefits—of diversity to stakeholders. However, the connection between financial rewards and diversity is impossible to prove because research can only establish correlation, not causation, between the two. Further, even though the business case for diversity has been documented by Catalyst, McKinsey, Credit Suisse, and others for two decades, it never seems to be enough. Some people still ask for more proof that gender diversity is “good for business,” yet it never occurs to them to ask for the business case demonstrating that the status quo or all-male leadership teams and boards are good for business. Recent research even suggests that managers are more likely to take action on social issues when they are presented in moral terms—aligning with the organization’s values and mission—rather than in economic language.\n\nInstead of trying to seek that elusive “proof” that diversity causes improved business performance, companies should focus on diversity as a talent issue, and recognize that to be an industry leader, it is critical to tap into the full talent pool. By hiring a limited group of people, companies are missing out on significant segments of talent, so they should be putting energy and resources toward recruiting and retaining diverse employees and creating inclusive workplace cultures where everyone has an equal opportunity to contribute and succeed.\n\nFor more information about financial performance research, see: Catalyst, Why Diversity and Inclusion Matter: Financial Performance (June 24, 2020).\n\nDiversity Is Associated with Improved Financial Performance\n\nMany studies link diversity to indicators of profitability and financial health, including:\n\nCash flow return on investment\n\nEarnings Before Interests and Taxes (EBIT) margins\n\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) margins\n\nGross and net margins\n\nInternal rate of return\n\nInvestment performance\n\nMarket value\n\nOperating profit margin\n\nReturn on Assets (ROA)\n\nReturn on Equity (ROE)\n\nReturn on Sales (ROS)\n\nRevenue\n\nSales performance\n\nStock returns\n\nTobin’s Q\n\nInclusion Can Help Organizations Thrive During Economic Recessions\n\nCompanies with consistent, inclusive workplace cultures—especially as experienced by historically underrepresented groups—also outperformed the S&P 500 in average annual stock returns during the Great Recession (measured from 2006-2014).\n\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES\n\nNext Steps\n\nCatalyst, Creating a D&I Strategy: Ask Catalyst Express.\n\nCatalyst, Microlearning: Knowledge Bursts.\n\nCatalyst, Vital Signs.\n\nThe New York Times, “From Inclusion to Support: How to Build a Better Workplace,” June 17, 2019.\n\nFrances Taplett, Matt Krentz, Justin Dean, and Gabrielle Novacek, “Diversity Is Just the First Step.
