Its loud and strong beats make it popular among the youths. Some of the rock stars who have popularized the culture include Little Richard, Bill Haley and Chuck Berry while rock bands like Pink Floyd, The Doors, Metallica, Nirvana and Megadeth are the modern bands who have taken the culture by storm.\n\n3. Jazz:\n\nIdentified with swing and blue notes, Jazz has its roots both in the West African and European culture.
