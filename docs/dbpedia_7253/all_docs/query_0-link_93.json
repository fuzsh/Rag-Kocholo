        "text": "LE MONDE's OPINION - WORTH SEEING\n\nWith such a title, the first thought of the hardcore cinephile when they learn about the new film Tirailleurs (Father & Solider for the English release) will go to Indigènes (Days of Glory) by Rachid Bouchareb (The so-called Senegalese tirailleurs were the West African soldiers fighting in the French army; indigènes was the legal designation for colonized peoples who did not have the rights of French citizens). In that spectacular and edifying 2006 film, the director evoked the history of a few soldiers from the colonies and protectorates of North Africa who in 1944 took part in the liberation of occupied France. On that occasion, Bouchareb assembled the stars of the North African immigrant community (Sami Bouajila, Jamel Debbouze, Samy Naceri and Roschdy Zem) for a difficult task, in which the burden of remembrance and the desire to educate weighed a bit on characters' already heavy load.\n\nThe aforementioned cinephile, a maniac afflicted with a certain morality, will nevertheless make a point of discovering these Tirailleurs. Even if it means readily acknowledging that this film – undoubtedly based on the same historical and political conditions – is in many ways different from the previous one.\n\nFirst of all, the period: the Great War, and a no less sacred slaughter, on the Ardennes front. Next, the memory of a different Africa, sub-Saharan and Black, notably embodied here by Omar Sy playing the role of a Senegalese rifleman (\"tirailleur\").\n\nFinally, the personality and style of the director. Assistant to Raymond Depardon and cinematographer for Idrissa Ouedraogo (Samba Traoré, 1992); Jacques Audiard (Sur mes lèvres, Read my Lips, 2001); and Olivier Nakache and Eric Tolédano (Intouchables, 2011), Mathieu Vadepied's first feature depicted an against the grain suburbia (La Vie en grand, Learn by Heart, 2015). He takes the same liberties with Tirailleurs. He subordinates without eliminating the specifications inherent to the subject (the fate of Black troops in the French army) and to the genre (the war film) and makes them purely narrative challenges.\n\nFrom Senegal to the Ardennes front\n\nThe film could just as well be called \"Father and Son,\" like the Ivan Turgenev novel. In this instance, Bakary and Thierno Diallo. The father (played by Alassane Diong) is forcibly conscripted from his village in Senegal and immediately sent to the Ardennes front in northeastern France in 1917. His son (Omar Sy) voluntarily joins him in an attempt to save him from certain, or at least likely, death. (During World War I, 200,000 Senegalese riflemen were drafted, 30,000 of whom lost their lives).\n\nThe film has two false beginnings. The first takes place in the vicinity of Verdun, where the soil is virtually transformed into an ossuary and where men in fact dig up the remains of a corpse. We sense that we will return there. The second is a sort of prologue in the form of a Senegalese pastoral, too brief to give any depth or authenticity to the main characters who appear in it – Sy as a Fulani shepherd. Given his childhood in the Paris suburb of Trappes and background on the sketch comedy show Service après-vente des émissions, it's asking a lot of the spectator. But it is sufficient, and this is undoubtedly its true function, to show the violence of the French conscription.\n\nThe core of the film unfolds between the village transformed into a camp for African troops and the steady ascent to the front. The unceasing resourcefulness and harshness of life give way to scenes of murderous madness, eroding confidence and the smoky chaos of the trenches and assaults. All of this is filmed up close, without much artifice, in tracking shots, favoring the feverish presence of the characters in the world around them.\n\nHeartbreaking and tragic\n\nThe dramatic stakes are nonetheless elsewhere, in the disagreement that will soon separate the son from the father concerning the legitimacy of their presence in this place.\n\nNew\n\nLe Monde’s app\n\nGet the most out of your experience: download the app to enjoy Le Monde in English anywhere, anytime\n\nDownload\n\nBakary, watching over his son as if he were the apple of his eye, deploys endless schemes to get the hell out of this country and this war in which he feels he has no part. Thierno, on the other hand, speaks French (unlike his father, who speaks Fulani throughout the film) and is befriended by the young lieutenant Chambreau (the son of a general, he himself has something rather massive to prove). Chambreau instills in Thierno his fervor for patriotic combat and the bloody feeling of brotherhood that weapons provide. He ultimately takes on the status of a substitute father.\n\nIt is this intimate, heartbreaking and tragic plot that holds the film together and proves to be doubly clever. First, because it structures the story around a purely fictional objective. But also because that objective in a way intersects with the political ambiguity of African fighting in France's more or less legitimate battles. This force distinguished itself with valor and bravery not only on the European fronts but in all the colonial conquests of the empire and then of the republic (from sub-Saharan Africa to Indochina to Algeria), while itself being a victim of colonialist violence. In a word, this is a non-Manichean film, memorializing the terrible complexity of the world.\n\nJacques Mandelbaum\n\nTranslation of an original article published in French on lemonde.fr; the publisher may only be liable for the French version."
