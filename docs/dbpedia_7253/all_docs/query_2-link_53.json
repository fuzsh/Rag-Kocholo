        "text": "See the Assessment section of the Fluency Disorders Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/caregiver perspective.\n\nScreening\n\nScreening is conducted whenever a fluency disorder is suspected or as part of a comprehensive speech and language assessment. The purpose of the screening is to identify individuals who require further speech-language assessment.\n\nSee ASHA’s resource on assessment tools, techniques, and data sources.\n\nComprehensive Assessment\n\nIndividuals are referred to a speech-language pathologist (SLP) for a comprehensive assessment when disfluencies are noted and when one or more of the factors listed below are observed along with the disfluencies.\n\nThis list is not exhaustive, and not all factors need to be present for a referral to an SLP (e.g., Guitar, 2019; Yaruss et al., 1998).\n\nThere is a family history of stuttering or cluttering.\n\nThere is parent/individual concern.\n\nThe person exhibits negative reactions (e.g., affective, behavioral, or cognitive reactions) to their disfluency.\n\nThe person is experiencing negative reactions from others (e.g., peers, classmates, coworkers, family members).\n\nThe person exhibits physical tension or secondary behaviors (e.g., eye blinking, head nodding) associated with the disfluency.\n\nThe person is having difficulty communicating messages in an efficient, effective manner.\n\nOther speech or language concerns are also present.\n\nConsistent with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework (ASHA, 2023; Coleman & Yaruss, 2014; Vanryckeghem & Kawai, 2015; WHO, 2001; Yaruss, 2007; Yaruss & Quesal, 2004, 2006), a comprehensive fluency assessment is conducted to identify and describe\n\nimpairments in body structure and function, including frequency and severity of disfluencies, presence of physical concomitant behaviors and learned avoidance behaviors, and presence of tension and effort while communicating;\n\ncomorbid deficits or conditions, such as speech sound disorders and language disorders;\n\nlimitations in activity and participation, including functional communication and interpersonal interactions at home, in social settings, at school, or at work;\n\ncontextual (environmental and personal) factors that serve as barriers to or facilitators of successful communication and life participation; and\n\nthe impact of communication impairments on quality of life of the individual.\n\nSee ASHA’s resource on assessment of fluency disorders in the context of the WHO ICF framework. See also ASHA’s resources titled Person-Centered Focus on Function: Preschool Stuttering [PDF], Person-Centered Focus on Function: School-Age Stuttering [PDF], and Person-Centered Focus on Function: Adult Stuttering [PDF] for examples of assessment data consistent with the ICF framework.\n\nSymptoms and severity of stuttering and cluttering can vary (Davidow & Scott, 2017; St. Louis & Schulte, 2011). For example, cluttering symptoms may decrease during a formal speech evaluation—due to increased self-monitoring—but increase in more comfortable situations where the person is less likely to self-monitor. On the other hand, stuttering symptoms may decrease in more comfortable situations. In addition, some persons who stutter substitute words, omit words, or use circumlocution to hide stuttering symptoms (B. Murphy et al., 2007). Therefore, a comprehensive assessment for fluency disorders should include assessment of both overt and covert features. Additionally, the affective, behavioral, and cognitive features of stuttering are important components of the assessment (Vanryckeghem & Kawai, 2015). Clinicians need to be observant of indicators, such as stuttering avoidance or social isolation, that clients/patients/students may be internalizing negative stereotypes about stuttering (Boyle, 2013a).\n\nFor an accurate evaluation, it is ideal to collect samples of speech across various situations and tasks, both inside and outside the clinical setting (Yaruss, 1997). Audiovisual recordings of speech can provide useful information to supplement direct clinical observations. Cluttering and stuttering do not need to occur in all situations or even a majority of the time to be diagnosable disorders.\n\nA comprehensive fluency assessment typically includes the following:\n\nRelevant case history (as appropriate for age), including\n\nmedical history;\n\ngeneral development;\n\nspeech and language development;\n\nspeech and language concerns;\n\nfrequency of exposure to all languages used by the child and their proficiency (comprehension and production) in each language;\n\nfamily history of stuttering or cluttering;\n\ndescription of disfluency and rating of severity;\n\nage of onset of disfluency and patterns of disfluency since onset (e.g., continuous or variable);\n\nprevious fluency treatment and treatment outcomes;\n\nexploration of parental reactions to the child’s moments of disfluency or speaking frustration; and\n\ninformation regarding family, personal, and cultural perception of fluency.\n\nConsultation with family members, educators, and other professionals regarding fluency variability (when disfluencies are noticed most and least) and the impact of disfluency.\n\nReal-time analysis or analysis based on an audiovisual recorded speech sample demonstrating representative disfluencies beyond the clinic setting.\n\nReview of previous fluency evaluations and educational records.\n\nAssessment of speech fluency (e.g., frequency, type, and duration of disfluencies), speech rate, speech intelligibility, and the presence of secondary behaviors in a variety of speaking tasks (e.g., conversational and narrative contexts).\n\nAssessment of awareness in young children of disfluencies and difficulty in speaking.\n\nStimulability testing (e.g., person is asked to increase pausing and/or decrease speech rate in some other way)—a reduction of overall speech rate typically helps in reducing cluttering symptoms.\n\nAssessment of the impact of stuttering or cluttering—including assessment of the emotional, cognitive, and attitudinal impact of disfluency.\n\nAssessment of other communication dimensions, including speech sound production, receptive and expressive language, pragmatic language, voice, hearing, and oral–motor function/structure.\n\nDetermination of individual strengths and coping strategies.\n\nAssessment may result in\n\nthe diagnosis of a fluency disorder (stuttering, cluttering, or both);\n\na differential diagnosis between fluency disorders and reading disorders, language disorders, and/or speech sound disorders;\n\ndescriptions of the characteristics and severity of the fluency disorder;\n\njudgments on the degree of impact the fluency disorder has on verbal communication and quality of life;\n\na determination if the person will benefit from treatment;\n\na determination of adverse educational, social, and vocational impact;\n\nrecommendations for treatment;\n\nparent or family counseling to determine optimal responses to the child’s speech and stuttering; and\n\nconsultation with and referral to other professionals as needed.\n\nSee ASHA’s resource on assessment procedures: parallel with CPT codes for a breakdown of pre-evaluation, intra-service, and post-service procedures.\n\nSpecial Considerations: Assessment of Preschool Children\n\nThe purpose of assessing fluency in a preschool child is to determine\n\nif a child has typical disfluencies or a fluency disorder (see ASHA’s resource on characteristics of typical disfluency and stuttering) and\n\nif monitoring or treatment (direct or indirect) is recommended.\n\nIf treatment is warranted, it is necessary to determine the timing for intervention and to set out a plan for parent education and counseling. If treatment is currently not warranted, the SLP educates the family about how to monitor the child’s fluency to determine if and when the child should be reevaluated.\n\nFor stuttering, the assessment will identify risk factors associated with stuttering, the severity of stuttering, and the presence of other speech and language concerns.\n\nAlthough cluttering has been reported in children as young as 4 years of age, the diagnosis is more commonly made at about 8 years of age (Ward, 2006), when a child’s language becomes lengthy and/or complex enough for symptoms to manifest themselves.\n\nSpecial Considerations: Assessment of School-Age Children and Adolescents\n\nThe purpose of assessing school-age children and adolescents for fluency disorders is to determine the presence, the extent, and—most importantly—the impact of the fluency disorder and the potential benefit from treatment.\n\nAs children who stutter get older, they may become adept at word and situational avoidances that result in a low frequency of overt stuttering. However, these compensations may compound the negative experience of stuttering over time. Some children who stutter or clutter may only experience symptoms situationally. However, even when children show little observable disfluency, they may still need treatment because of the negative impact of stuttering or cluttering on their lives.\n\nA comprehensive assessment for persistent stuttering should include a self-assessment of the experience of stuttering. However, a school-age child or adolescent who stutters may not report their experience accurately, possibly due to a lack of awareness or a desire to appease the clinician (Adriaensens et al., 2015; Erickson & Block, 2013). Therefore, clinicians may want to ask open-ended questions to assess communication across specific situations (e.g., “How do you participate in class?” “How do you talk to strangers?” “Please describe a situation when you ordered food from a restaurant.” “How did it feel?”). Clinicians also should attempt to better understand how the person experiences the moments before, during, and after stuttering. SLPs may want to relate personal experiences when asking clients to share such vulnerable information.\n\nSpecial Considerations: Assessment of Adults\n\nAdults are likely to have been living with stuttering for a long time. Therefore, as with school-age children and adolescents, the purpose of the assessment for adults typically is not to diagnose stuttering. Rather, the purpose is to determine the extent and impact of the fluency disorder on the individual, the potential benefit from treatment, and the individual’s desire and willingness to change.\n\nStuttering severity may vary dramatically by speaking situation. Therefore, when conducting an assessment with an adult, it is crucial to understand\n\nthe individual’s lived experiences with stuttering,\n\nthe perceived impact of these experiences with stuttering, and\n\ntheir reason for seeking treatment at the current time.\n\nExperiences with stuttering can affect an individual’s employment, job satisfaction, personal and romantic relationships, and overall quality of life (Beilby et al., 2013; Blood & Blood, 2016).\n\nCultural and Linguistic Considerations\n\nBilingual children are assessed in both languages to determine stuttering profiles in both (Finn & Cordes, 1997). Bilingual children who stutter typically do so in both languages (Nwokah, 1988; Van Borsel et al., 2001). Empirical research on whether bilingual individuals who stutter are more disfluent in one language than the other is sparse and based on small case studies (Tellis & Tellis, 2003), but many bilingual individuals who stutter report this to be the case (Nwokah, 1988). Differences in fluency across languages may be due to the social context in which the language is used (Foote, 2013), as well as the proficiency of each language spoken.\n\nMoments of stuttering or disfluency may be difficult to distinguish from typical disfluency or reduced language proficiency, especially for a person unfamiliar with the language (Shenker, 2011). It is helpful to know that typical bilingual or multilingual children tend to produce higher rates of monosyllabic word repetitions, sound repetitions, and syllable repetitions than monolingual speakers. The differences between disfluencies stemming from reduced language proficiency and stuttering are evident in lack of awareness, struggle, tension, blocking, and lack of self-concept as a person who stutter, which are not seen in typical second language learning profiles (Byrd, 2018).\n\nEnlisting the help of a person familiar with the language and rating fluency in short speech intervals also may help to accurately and reliably judge unambiguous stuttering (Shenker, 2011). Parents of bilingual children easily can be trained to provide perceptual ratings of fluency in any language spoken by the child (Shenker, 2013). Parents can also report if secondary behaviors are present in both languages.\n\nBilingual SLPs who have the necessary clinical expertise to assess the child—and are familiar with the languages they speak—may not always be available. When a bilingual SLP is not available, using an interpreter is a viable option. See ASHA’s Practice Portal pages on Multilingual Service Delivery in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology and Collaborating With Interpreters, Transliterators, and Translators.\n\nAs is the case with any communication disorder, language differences and family/individual values and preferences are taken into consideration during assessment. Languages differ with regard to developmental milestones, and direct comparison of scores across languages can be misleading, even if the assessments appear similar (Thordardottir, 2006). It is not appropriate to determine a standard score if the norming sample of the assessment is not representative of the individual being assessed.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis\n\nDifferentiating between typical disfluencies and stuttering (i.e., ambiguous and unambiguous moments of stuttering) is a critical piece of assessment, particularly for preschool children (see ASHA’s resource on characteristics of typical disfluency and stuttering). It is important to distinguish stuttering from other possible diagnoses (e.g., language formulation difficulties, cluttering, and reading disorders) and to distinguish cluttering from language-related difficulties (e.g., word finding and organization of discourse) and other disorders that have an impact on speech intelligibility (e.g., apraxia of speech and other speech sound disorders).\n\nPart of the diagnostic process is also to distinguish between stuttering disfluencies and disfluencies that occur when learning a new language. For example, English language learners may have word-finding problems in the second language. Tellis and Tellis (2003) caution clinicians not to confuse these word-finding problems with stuttering.\n\nDisfluencies noted in bilingual children and adults are similar to those found for monolingual speakers (Shenker, 2013). Mis- and overidentification of stuttering in bilingual speakers may occur due to typical disfluencies observed in development, code switching, and wording changes to maintain the grammatical integrity of the dominant language. However, these disfluencies are typical and not indicative of a disorder (Shenker, 2013).\n\nStuttering/Cluttering\n\nAlthough cluttering and stuttering can co-occur, there are some important distinctions between the two (see Scaler Scott, 2010). Individuals who stutter are more likely to be self-aware about their disfluencies and communication, and they may exhibit more physical tension, secondary behaviors, and negative reactions to communication. Individuals who clutter may exhibit more errors related to reduced speech intelligibility secondary to rapid rate of speech.\n\nStuttering/Reading Disorders\n\nChildren who stutter typically know how to read (decode) the printed form of words, but they may not be able to speak the printed form fluently. In contrast, children with reading disorders are likely to have difficulty decoding the printed form, which, in turn, has a negative impact on oral reading fluency (Kuhn & Stahl, 2003).\n\nWhen reading aloud, children who stutter\n\nmay show increased disfluency rates (decreased reading fluency) because they cannot change the words to avoid moments of stuttering as easily as they can in conversation, and\n\ntheir disfluencies may be accompanied by physical tension and secondary behaviors.\n\nOral reading may not be a valid measure of reading fluency for children who stutter, as fluency breakdowns will slow reading rate. Reading slowly may be perceived as a reading problem, even though the underlying cause is stuttering. The validity of reading assessment tools for children who stutter is questionable because it is difficult to differentiate the cause (decoding or stuttering) of oral reading fluency problems. Alternative measures of reading fluency—such as tests of silent reading fluency—may be more valid measures for children who stutter. See an article by ASHA’s Ad Hoc Committee on Reading Fluency For School-Age Children Who Stutter (ASHA, 2014).\n\nIt can also be challenging to assess the reading fluency of bilingual students who stutter. For example, when selecting reading passages, it may be difficult to determine the linguistic complexity of a text in a language unfamiliar to the clinician. In addition, clinicians need to avoid using religious or highly familiar texts that individuals may know by rote.\n\nFluency Disorders/Language Difficulties\n\nChildren with language difficulties at the sentence, narrative, or conversational discourse level may exhibit increased speech disfluencies. They are likely to use interjections, repeat phrases, and revise what they are saying. However, their disfluencies are not likely to involve prolongations, blocks, physical tension, or secondary behaviors that are more typical for children who stutter (Boscolo et al., 2002).\n\nWord-finding problems can also result in an increase in typical disfluencies that are similar to those observed in cluttering. Specific standardized tests can be used to rule out word-finding difficulties. Assessing organization of discourse also can help rule out verbal organization problems that might be mistaken for cluttering (van Zaalen-Op’t Hof et al., 2009).\n\nCluttering/Other Disorders of Speech Intelligibility\n\nOther disorders, such as apraxia of speech and/or articulation and phonological disorders, can affect speech intelligibility; assessment of speech production can be used to rule out these causes of reduced speech intelligibility. See ASHA’s Practice Portal pages on Childhood Apraxia of Speech and Speech Sound Disorders: Articulation and Phonology.\n\nImpact of Fluency Disorders\n\nWhen assessing fluency, it is important to consider the impact of fluency disorders on participation in everyday activities. Fluency disorders can interfere with play, school, work, or social interactions (Yaruss & Quesal, 2004). Individuals may experience stuttering in different ways with siblings, their spouse, or other family members.\n\nIndividuals may experience the impact of fluency disorders in social and emotional, academic, and vocational domains.\n\nSocial and Emotional\n\nexpressing wants and needs\n\nhaving conversations or telling stories\n\nforming friendships\n\nregulating emotions\n\nshowing confidence\n\nconveying truthfulness\n\nAcademic\n\nreading aloud\n\nanswering questions in class\n\ngiving class or work presentations\n\nparticipating in class discussions\n\nIndividuals who stutter may report fear or anxiety about speaking and frustration or embarrassment with the time and effort required to speak (Ezrati-Vinacour et al., 2001). Children who stutter also may be at risk for experiencing bullying (Blood & Blood, 2004; Davis et al., 2002; Langevin et al., 1998).\n\n“For students who stutter, the impact goes beyond the communication domain. In fact, stuttering can affect all areas of academic competency, including academic learning, social-emotion functioning, and independent functioning” (Ribbler, 2006, p. 15). Fluency disorders do not necessarily affect test scores or subject grades. It is incumbent upon the SLP to help the individualized education program (IEP) team determine the academic and social impacts of stuttering on students in the school setting.\n\nWhen determining eligibility for speech and language services through the public school system, SLPs need to document the “adverse educational impact” of the disability using a combination of standardized test scores when available and a portfolio-based assessment (Coleman & Yaruss, 2014; Ribbler, 2006). This includes the impact on functional communication in key school situations and on quality of life (Beilby et al., 2012b; Yaruss et al., 2012). The Present Levels of Academic Achievement and Functional Performance statement, which serves as the baseline for the IEP, refers to other areas that are not necessarily academic and can include information about communication skills, social skills, and other activities of daily living. The Present Levels of Academic Achievement and Functional Performance statements are based on objective data.\n\nSchool-based SLPs and IEP teams should resist pressure to minimize the impact of stuttering on educational achievement for the purpose of disqualifying students from speech-language pathology services.\n\nVocational\n\nThe interview process and work environment can be challenging for individuals who stutter. Stuttering may influence an individual’s perception of their career possibilities and professional limitations (Klein & Hood, 2004). Coworkers may have negative attitudes toward individuals who stutter, and the individual may feel excluded because of this. Time pressures for verbal communication and requirements to use the telephone may lead to stress and discomfort. Individuals who stutter consistently report experiencing limitations, discrimination, and glass ceiling–like effects at their jobs and within their careers (Bricker-Katz et al., 2013; Cassar & Neilson, 1997; Klein & Hood, 2004).\n\nHelping individuals who stutter become more accepting and open about their stuttering may help them have workplace conversations about it, advocate for themselves, and build support systems within the workplace (Plexico et al., 2019).\n\nSee the Treatment section of the Fluency Disorders Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/caregiver perspective.\n\nClients often report successful stuttering therapy as a transformational experience progressing from avoidance to acceptance and openness, increasing self-confidence and self-efficacy (Plexico et al., 2005; Tichenor & Yaruss, 2019a). However during treatment and forming a new, more congruent identity, clients may progress through some of the stages of grief (e.g., 1. Shock, 2. Denial, 3. Anger/Resistance, 4. Bargaining, 5. Sadness/Depression, 6. Testing, and 7. Acceptance; Constantino et al., 2017. There are several indicators of positive therapeutic change.\n\nIndicators of positive therapeutic change may include\n\nincreased self-confidence/self-efficacy;\n\nmore positive identity and congruence;\n\nbeing more comfortable and open with stuttering and pseudostuttering;\n\ntalking with others about stuttering;\n\ndisclosing stuttering;\n\nadvocating for oneself;\n\nreporting experiencing decreased anxiety while communicating;\n\nreporting less adverse psychological, emotional, social, and functional impacts;\n\nreporting enjoying social communication, including with strangers; and\n\nincreased social communication participation (Manning & DiLollo, 2018).\n\nTreatment for fluency disorders is highly individualized and based on a thorough assessment of speech fluency, language factors, emotional/attitudinal components, and life impact (Byrd & Donaher, 2018). The speech-language pathologist (SLP) uses linguistically and culturally appropriate stimuli and is sensitive to the unique values and preferences of each individual and their family to create a treatment plan (Sisskin, 2018).\n\nThe clinician (a) considers the degree to which the individual’s disfluent behaviors and overall communication are influenced by a coexisting disorder (e.g., other speech or language disorders, Down syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) and (b) determines how treatment might be adjusted accordingly. Clinicians need to understand the interaction of symptoms and the strategies that are most effective for dealing with stuttering and cluttering when they occur together. The ultimate goal is for individuals to understand these interactions and how they can manage the disfluencies and their reactions.\n\nConsider the individual’s age, preferences, and needs within the context of family and community when selecting and adapting treatment approaches and materials. For a discussion of a process for selecting evidence-based approaches based on individual needs, see Yaruss and Pelczarski (2007).\n\nTreatment is sensitive to cultural and linguistic factors and addresses goals within WHO’s ICF framework (ASHA, 2023; Coleman & Yaruss, 2014; WHO, 2001; Yaruss, 2007; Yaruss & Quesal, 2004, 2006). See ASHA’s resource on treatment goals for fluency disorders in the context of the WHO ICF framework. See also ASHA’s resources titled Person-Centered Focus on Function: Preschool Stuttering [PDF], Person-Centered Focus on Function: School-Age Stuttering [PDF], and Person-Centered Focus on Function: Adult Stuttering [PDF] for examples of treatment goals consistent with the ICF framework.\n\nPerson- and Family-Centered Practice\n\nPerson- and family-centered practice is a collaborative approach that fosters an alliance-style partnership among individuals, families, and clinicians. Each party is equally important in the relationship, and each party respects the knowledge, skills, and experiences that the others bring to the process. This approach to care incorporates individual and family preferences, priorities, and desired outcomes in the selection of treatment goals and treatment methods.\n\nPerson- and family-centered practice offers a range of services, including counseling and emotional support, procuring information and resources, coordinating services, teaching specific skills to facilitate communication, and advocating for or with the individual and their family. See ASHA’s resource on person- and family-centered care.\n\nConsistent with a person- and family-centered approach to stuttering treatment, the SLP\n\neducates the individual who stutters and their family members about stuttering and communication and\n\nfacilitates conversations between the individual and their family about the experience of stuttering, the individual’s communication expectations, their life goals, and how to holistically support communication (see, e.g., Berquez & Kelman, 2018; Millard et al., 2018; Rocha et al., 2019).\n\nMotivational interviewing is a person-centered approach that can be useful in developing functional goals and enhancing readiness for change (Miller & Rollnick, 2013; Rollnick & Miller, 1995). It incorporates techniques such as open-ended questions, feedback, reflective listening, affirmations, and summarizing to resolve resistance or ambivalence to therapy. Motivational interviewing may be used to help individuals who stutter better understand the thoughts and feelings associated with their stuttering and make positive changes to improve communication. When speakers are able to participate in decisions about treatment goals and select goals they consider important, they may be more motivated to take part in therapy (Finn, 2003; Sønsterud et al., 2019).\n\nFocus of Treatment\n\nMost individuals who stutter demonstrate both observable disfluency and negative life impact (Beilby et al., 2012b; Ribbler, 2006; Tichenor & Yaruss, 2019a; Yaruss et al., 2012). When developing treatment goals, the clinician takes a holistic approach and considers the extent to which stuttering affects the individual’s entire communication experience. Goals that focus on minimizing negative reactions to stuttering and difficulties communicating in various speaking situations may help the individual reduce the effort used to hide or avoid their disfluencies and communicate with more ease. An increase in observable disfluent behaviors may occur as the individual communicates more freely.\n\nPreschool Children Who Stutter\n\nTreatment approaches are individualized based on the child’s needs and family communication patterns. A comprehensive treatment approach for preschoolers includes both parent- and child-focused strategies. The goals of treatment may be (a) to eliminate, greatly reduce, or help the child manage their stuttering and (b) to help them not develop negative emotional reactions related to their stuttering (H. S. Arnold et al., 2011; Yaruss et al., 2006). For preschool children who stutter, parent and family involvement in the treatment process is essential, as is a home component (Kelman & Nicholas, 2020). The SLP works with parents and families to create an environment that facilitates fluency and that helps them develop healthy and appropriate communication attitudes (Onslow et al., 2003; Yaruss & Reardon-Reeves, 2017).\n\nYoung children may or may not verbalize their reactions to stuttering. Clinicians and parents also look for reactions, such as avoidance of words or speaking situations, increased physical tension or secondary behaviors, reduced utterance length, or slight changes in pitch or loudness during stuttering episodes. It is important that parents and clinicians acknowledge and respond to a child’s verbal and nonverbal reactions in a supportive manner; this helps to minimize the likelihood that the child will develop negative reactions to stuttering.\n\nTreatment Approaches: Preschool Children Who Stutter\n\nTreatment approaches for preschool children who stutter include the following.\n\nIndirect\n\nIndirect treatment focuses on counseling families about how to make changes in their own speech and how to make changes in their child’s environment. These modifications are used to facilitate speech fluency and may include\n\nreducing the communication rate,\n\nusing indirect prompts rather than direct questions,\n\nrecasting/rephrasing to model fluent speech or techniques (Millard et al., 2008; Yaruss et al., 2006), and\n\nresilience building within the child and family (Berquez & Kelman, 2018).\n\nDirect\n\nDirect treatment focuses on changing the child’s speech, attitudes, and beliefs in order to manage stuttering or facilitate fluency (Yaruss et al., 2006). Direct treatment approaches may include speech modification (e.g., reduced rate of speech, prolonged syllables) and stuttering modification strategies (e.g., modifying a stuttered word, “pulling out” of a stuttered word) to reduce disfluency rate, physical tension, and secondary behaviors (Hill, 2003). Direct treatment approaches can also target resilience and effort control in the child and family (Caughter & Crofts, 2018; Druker et al., 2019; Kraft et al., 2019).\n\nOperant\n\nOperant treatment (e.g., Palin Parent–Child Interaction Therapy, Kelman & Nicholas, 2020; Lidcombe Program, Onslow et al., 2003) incorporates principles of operant conditioning and uses a response contingency to reinforce the child for fluent speech and redirect disfluent speech (the child is periodically asked for correction). With this approach, parents are trained to provide verbal contingencies based on whether a child’s speech is fluent or stuttered (M. Jones et al., 2005; Onslow et al., 2003). In this way, positive reinforcement is used to increase or strengthen the response of fluency (the desired behavior). Operant approaches operate within a framework of stuttering as a learned behavior (for a discussion, see Conture, 2001; de Sonneville-Koedoot et al., 2015, p. 334; Onslow & Yaruss, 2007).\n\nSchool-Age Children, Adolescents, and Adults Who Stutter\n\nA comprehensive treatment approach for school-age children, adolescents, and adults includes multiple goals and considers the age of the individual and their unique needs (e.g., communication in the classroom, in the community, or at work).\n\nTreatment is focused on\n\nincreasing effective and efficient communication,\n\nincreasing acceptance and openness with stuttering,\n\nreducing secondary behaviors and minimizing avoidances,\n\nimproving social communication,\n\nincreasing self-confidence and self-efficacy,\n\nmanaging bullying effectively, and\n\nminimizing the adverse impact of stuttering (Yaruss et al., 2012).\n\nDisfluent behavior becomes more complex as fear of speaking, anxiety, and resulting avoidance increase. Communication apprehension, loss of control, and shame may also develop as individuals experience greater difficulty with communication. Treatment may include strategies to reduce negative reactions to stuttering in the individual and others (Yaruss et al., 2012). For example, clinicians may use treatment strategies to reduce bullying through desensitization exercises and by educating the individual’s peers about stuttering (W. P. Murphy et al., 2007a, 2007b). Integrated treatment focused on parental involvement, self-regulation, and fluency may also be beneficial (Druker et al., 2019). Effortful control, an aspect of temperament that supports self-regulation, may be predictive of stuttering severity and may facilitate positive change in treatment (Kraft et al., 2019).\n\nChronic problems associated with illness, injury, or other traumatic events can have a negative impact on an individual’s emotional health and quality of life (e.g., Bonanno & Mancini, 2008). Resilience—the ability to adjust and cope in the face of adversity—can help lessen the negative impact (e.g., Coifman & Bonanno, 2010). Resilience has been examined in the stuttering literature as one factor that may protect people from the adverse effects of chronic stuttering (Craig et al., 2011; Freud & Amir, 2020).\n\nTreatment Considerations for Adolescents\n\nTreatment for adolescents who stutter poses a particular challenge because of the issues related to this developmental stage. Typical adolescent experiences of emotional reactivity, resistance to authority, and social awkwardness may be exacerbated in adolescents who also experience stuttering (Daly et al., 1995; Zebrowski, 2002). Adolescents also may be particularly susceptible to peer pressure and bullying at this time. The attitudes of high school peers toward stuttering and toward persons who stutter can be improved through education in the form of classroom presentations about stuttering (Flynn & St. Louis, 2011). Students who improve their attitudes toward stuttering tend to maintain these views years later (St. Louis & Flynn, 2018).\n\nIn addition to the challenges associated with typical adolescent experiences, treatment may not be a priority for some adolescents because of other academic and social demands, denial of a speech problem, and concern about the stigma of seeking treatment. Building trust by following the student’s lead, finding out what experiences may be motivating, and bringing together peers for support are treatment options to consider (Hearne et al., 2008).\n\nDespite these challenges, some of the therapy that applies to adults can be just as effective with teens/adolescents. They also can benefit from groups and intensive programs (Fry et al., 2014).\n\nTreatment Considerations for Adults\n\nAdults with fluency disorders have likely experienced years of treatment with varied outcomes. They have long-held beliefs about stuttering that positively or negatively affect self-perceptions about their communication skills and their motivation for change (Daniels, 2007). Some adults lack communication confidence as a result of negative self-perceptions about their stuttering (Beilby et al., 2012a) or due to repeated exposure to people holding stereotypes about stuttering, which, in turn, may create self-stigmatization (Boyle, 2013a).\n\nAdults who stutter may be dealing with years of shame or stigma (Boyle, 2013a), and they can experience elevated levels of negative mood states (e.g., interpersonal sensitivity and depressed mood) when compared to adults who do not stutter (Tran et al., 2011).\n\nThe impact of fluency disorders often extends to social and vocational aspects of the individual’s life. For example, stuttering has been associated with higher levels of social anxiety in adults who stutter (Blumgart et al., 2010), and this can lead to fear and avoidance of social interaction (see Craig & Tran, 2006, for a review research on this topic). Adults who stutter also may experience job discrimination and occupational stereotyping, including an earnings gap, especially for females (Gerlach et al., 2018).\n\nA clinician’s first responsibility when treating an individual of any age is to “develop a thorough understanding of the stuttering experience and a speaker’s successful and unsuccessful efforts to cope with his or her communication problem” (Manning & DiLollo, 2018, p. 370). Consistent with treatment approaches for children and adolescents, treatment for adults needs to be individualized, dynamic, and multidimensional. The clinical process for an adult involves\n\nproviding information,\n\ntaking time to build a relationship,\n\ndiscussing the rationale for treatment decisions, and\n\nhaving flexibility based on individual needs and desired outcomes (Amster & Klein, 2018).\n\nOften, the main reason for seeking advice from an SLP and initiating services is to eliminate or greatly reduce disfluent speech. However, the clinician needs to consider the impact of disfluency on communication and quality of life as a whole. Treatment should consider not just the overt stuttering behavior but also the affective and cognitive reactions to stuttering. Increasing fluency may not be a goal for an adult or may be only one aspect of a comprehensive and multidimensional approach (Amster & Klein, 2018).\n\nRecurring themes of successful stuttering management in adults have been described as\n\nself-acceptance and fear reduction,\n\nunrestricted interactions,\n\na sense of freedom,\n\noptimism, and\n\ncontinued management (Plexico et al., 2005).\n\nTreatment Approaches: School-Age Children, Adolescents, and Adults Who Stutter\n\nBelow is a list of approaches commonly used with school-age children, adolescents, and adults who stutter. All approaches should include a plan for generalization and maintenance of skills involved in activities of daily living.\n\nApproaches may vary by therapeutic philosophy, goals and activities, duration and intensity, and age of the individual. Treatment approaches for adults should take into consideration career and workplace factors.\n\nMany clinicians use an integration of approaches to achieve optimal outcomes. For example, counseling an individual to accept or tolerate embarrassment can facilitate desensitization. Desensitization can help decrease word avoidance and reduce fear. As fear reduces, physical tension and struggle decrease, fluency is enhanced, and the individual is better able to communicate effectively.\n\nNot all of these approaches are appropriate for the treatment of cluttering (see Cluttering Treatment below).\n\nStrategies for Reducing Impairment in Body Function\n\nStrategies for reducing impairment in body function have been separated into two categories—speech modification and stuttering modification, both of which are described below. Clinicians do not have to choose one approach or the other. A treatment plan that involves both speech and stuttering modification techniques may be necessary to achieve optimal outcomes.\n\nOther treatment approaches described below also may be incorporated as part of a comprehensive treatment approach.\n\nSpeech Modification Strategies\n\nSpeech modification (including fluency shaping) strategies (Bothe, 2002; Guitar, 1982, 2019) include a variety of techniques aimed at making changes to the timing and tension of speech production or altering the timing of pauses between syllables and words. These modifications are used regardless of whether a particular word is expected to be produced fluently.\n\nStrategies aimed at changing the timing and tension of speech production include\n\neasy/gentle onset—the gradual onset of voicing (e.g., on initial vowels),\n\nlight articulatory contact—using easy articulatory postures (e.g., on plosives),\n\ncontinuous phonation—maintaining voicing throughout utterance,\n\nprolonged syllables—“stretching” each syllable in words/utterances, and\n\nrate control—slowing the overall rate of speech.\n\nStrategies aimed at altering the timing of pausing are used to increase the likelihood of fluent speech production and to improve overall communication skills (e.g., intelligibility, message clarity). In addition to being used for improving communication skills, pausing is also an effective method of rate control.\n\nJust as individuals may experience feelings of shame or fear associated with showing stuttering, individuals also may experience negative feelings associated with using speech modification strategies, which often make their speech sound different from “natural” speech (Ingham & Onslow, 1985; Martin et al., 1984).\n\nStuttering Modification Strategies (Reducing Physical Tension/Struggle)\n\nStuttering modification strategies, originated by Van Riper (1973), have four stages: (1) identification, (2) desensitization, (3) modification, and (4) generalization and aim to reduce associated physical tension and struggle by helping individuals\n\nidentify core stuttering behaviors,\n\nrecognize physical concomitant behaviors,\n\nlocate the point of physical tension and struggle during moments of disfluency, and\n\nultimately reduce that physical tension.\n\nThese strategies help individuals learn about the speech mechanism and how it operates during both fluent and disfluent speech so they can modify it. Increasing the individual’s awareness and self-monitoring skills helps to reduce unproductive behaviors that interfere with speech, and it may allow them to alter moments of stuttering so that they have decreased tension, are shorter, and are less disruptive to communication.\n\nTraditional stuttering modification strategies (Manning & DiLollo, 2018) include the following:\n\nPreparatory set—The speaker anticipates a moment of stuttering before it occurs and then uses stuttering modification strategies (e.g., volitional prolongation of a sound and light articulatory contact) to more effectively manage the moment of stuttering while producing the word.\n\nPull-out—During a stuttered word, the speaker “slides out” of the stuttered word by adjusting airflow, voicing, and the vocal tract to stutter smoothly through the word.\n\nCancellation—After a stuttered word, the speaker pauses for a few seconds to examine and rehearse the physical features of the stuttered word and then adjusts airflow, voicing, and the vocal tract to produce an easy version of the stuttered word.\n\nThese strategies require an individual to identify a moment of disfluency before, during, or after it occurs and to make adjustments to reduce tension and struggle. The specific strategy they select will depend on when the client “catches” the disfluency—in anticipation of the moment of disfluency, in the moment, or following the moment (Van Riper, 1973).\n\nThese strategies, like speech modification strategies, are introduced along a hierarchy of speaking situations that varies both with linguistic demands and with the stressors of the environment.\n\nIncreasing Speech Efficiency (Reducing Word Avoidance)\n\nSome individuals develop speech habits to escape or avoid moments of overt stuttering, such as changing words or using interjections (e.g., “um,” “uh”), and they may become so skilled at hiding stuttering that their speech appears to be fluent (covert stuttering; B. Murphy et al., 2007). The cost of such avoidance can be great because of the resulting impact on the person’s ability to say what they want to say, when they want to say it.\n\nSuch individuals may benefit from treatment strategies that focus on improving speech efficiency by reducing word avoidance and increasing spontaneity in communication. When being spontaneous and saying “all they want to say,” individuals may exhibit more surface-level stuttering. However, as they learn to reduce reactivity (see below), they develop greater comfort while speaking, they assume more positive attitudes about their ability to communicate, and they are better able to accept and manage moments of disfluency as they occur.\n\nStrategies for Reducing Negative Reactions (Personal and Environmental Context)\n\nNumerous treatment approaches and strategies have been developed in an attempt to help speakers reduce the negative reactions associated with stuttering (e.g., W. P. Murphy et al., 2007a). These may include stuttering modification (described above) in addition to awareness, desensitization, cognitive restructuring, self-disclosure, and support.\n\nAwareness\n\nAwareness and identification helps speakers better understand communication, speech, and stuttering along with their attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Clinicians may provide education about the speech systems and processes (e.g., respiratory system, phonatory, articulation/resonance, and nonverbal features) and that communication includes both verbal and nonverbal aspects, pragmatics, sender–receiver dynamics, and interpersonal relational features, which may be a target in treatment.\n\nSome examples of these are to openly discuss experiences with stuttering (from the client and the clinician with pseudostuttering or as described by previous clients who stutter) and model pseudostuttering and techniques, attitudes, and beliefs across speaking situations (Manning & Quesal, 2016; Watson, 1988). Discussions about the physical experience of anxiety and ways to reduce it and the sense of loss of control and time pressure may be of further benefit (e.g., mindfulness and grounding; Beilby et al., 2012a; Boyle, 2011; Harley, 2018). Other identification strategies may include video or pseudostuttering analysis or tallying/freezing. Clinicians may start with the client observing videos of others who stutter (or a puppet for children) to help them identify patterns, attitudes, and beliefs about communication and stuttering. This may progress to the client analyzing the clinician’s or their own pseudostuttering, to analyzing a video of their own stuttering to real-time analysis (Bray & Kehle, 2001; Bray et al., 2003; Cream et al., 2010; Harasym et al., 2015; Prins & Ingham, 2009). Tallying has the client stop directly after a moment of stuttering to tally or bring awareness to it while not attempting to escape by continuing to talk. Freezing is similar to tallying but has the client/clinician stop, freeze, during a moment of stuttering to perform a self-scan. Both procedures help the client decrease the sense of loss of control experienced during moments of stuttering by demonstrating their ability to stop and modify moments of stuttering, anxiety, and other emotional reactivity.\n\nDesensitization\n\nDesensitization strategies are strategies that help speakers systematically desensitize themselves to their fears about speaking and stuttering by facing those fears in structured, supportive environments. One example of a desensitization activity is pseudostuttering—the use of voluntary stuttering behaviors—in different, and increasingly more difficult, situations where the individual might fear the occurrence of real moments of stuttering (e.g., Reardon-Reeves & Yaruss, 2013; J. G. Sheehan, 1970).\n\nOne example of a treatment approach that incorporates desensitization is Avoidance Reduction Therapy for Stuttering (Sisskin, 2018). The goal of Avoidance Reduction Therapy for Stuttering is to decrease fear of stuttering that leads to “struggle.” Disfluencies are not directly targeted; however, the frequency and intensity of disfluencies decrease as struggle is reduced. The individual who stutters becomes desensitized to their fears by performing activities (e.g., self-disclosing, going to a place where they fear speaking) using a “fear hierarchy.” This hierarchy represents situations or activities that range from low risk to high risk. The individual learns strategies for generalization of skills to the classroom, workplace, and community.\n\nCognitive Restructuring\n\nCognitive restructuring is a strategy designed to help speakers change the way they think about themselves and their speaking situations. Individuals learn to identify the thoughts underlying their negative attitudes and emotional reactions and examine the link between these thoughts, attitudes, and emotional reactions and their speech. Through a process of identifying the assumptions underlying their thoughts, they can evaluate whether those thoughts are helpful (or valid) and ultimately adopt different assumptions or thoughts. Cognitive restructuring can be combined with the desensitization strategies described above (W. P. Murphy et al., 2007a).\n\nOne example of an approach that incorporates cognitive restructuring is Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; Beilby & Brynes, 2012; Beilby et al., 2012a; Palasik & Hannan, 2013). ACT is a holistic, person-centered approach that allows individuals to alter the relationships they have with their emotions and thoughts. One of the core principles of ACT is mindfulness. Mindfulness is an intentional awareness of the present moment (e.g., through meditation) to help disengage from automatic thoughts and redirect attention, de-escalate emotions, and increase self-acceptance (Boyle, 2011; Harley, 2018).\n\nAnother example is Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT; Menzies et al., 2019, 2009). The purpose of CBT is to modify current negative thoughts, emotions, and/or behaviors and replace them with positive ones through identification of thought patterns and challenging cognitive distortions in real time. More recently, CBT and mindfulness have been applied to stuttering therapy and may support that CBT+mindfulness is more beneficial to clients who stutter than CBT alone (Gupta et al., 2016; Harley, 2018).\n\nSelf-Disclosure\n\nSelf-disclosure involves communicating to others information that reveals one’s identity as a person who stutters. Often referred to as “advertising” in the stuttering community, self-disclosure can involve\n\nrevealing that identity directly,\n\ntalking about stuttering or treatment of stuttering,\n\nexplaining or interpreting symptoms of stuttering,\n\nproviding advice on how to respond to someone who stutters, or\n\nadvertising through a classroom presentation with the guidance of the SLP or classroom teacher in the case of school-age children (W. P. Murphy et al., 2007b).\n\nDisclosing a fluency disorder has many benefits on both the speaker (Boyle & Gabel, 2020; Boyle et al., 2018; Mancinelli, 2019) and the listener (Byrd, Croft, et al., 2017; Byrd, McGill, et al., 2017; Ferguson et al., 2019; Healey et al., 2007). Persons who stutter may appear “friendlier” when they self-disclose their stuttering, and self-disclosure may help put listeners more at ease (Healey et al., 2007). Disclosing a fluency disorder may be done a number of ways, such as verbally stating “I stutter/have a speech disorder” or by pseudostuttering or openly stuttering, while doing so confidently (McGill et al., 2018).\n\nSupport\n\nSupport (both giving and receiving) can be valuable for improving attitudes, boosting self-confidence, and reducing feelings of isolation (Yaruss et al., 2007). Partners may be sources of support for treatment of stuttering (Beilby et al., 2013).\n\nTreatment approaches that incorporate support activities also can provide venues to practice learned strategies in a safe environment and help promote generalization. Support activities can be incorporated into group treatment and through participation in self-help groups (Trichon & Raj, 2018), attendance at self-help conferences (Boyle et al., 2018; Gerlach et al., 2019; Trichon & Tetnowski, 2011), and participation in summer camp programs (Byrd et al., 2016).\n\nExamples of support groups and activities include FRIENDS: The National Association of Young People Who Stutter, the National Stuttering Association, and SAY: The Stuttering Association for the Young; online groups (e.g., online chats); and social media (e.g., blogs; Reeves, 2006).\n\nTechnological advances and the expansion of social media outlets have increased opportunities for adults who stutter to connect, share, and gain information through the Internet (Fuse & Lanham, 2016; Raj & Daniels, 2017) and stuttering-related podcasts (Dignazio et al., 2020). It is important for clinicians to verify online sites and virtual support groups recommended to clients and their families. SLPs also need to discuss with persons who stutter and their families how to evaluate the veracity and trustworthiness of sites claiming to “cure” stuttering that they may find on their own. See What To Ask When Evaluating Any Procedure, Product, or Program.\n\nStrategies for Reducing Activity Limitations and Participation Restrictions\n\nGeneralization Activities\n\nThe ability to use speech strategies; to make choices to speak and participate, regardless of the level of fluency; and to take risks is greatly reduced outside of the treatment setting when time pressure and conditioned negative feelings may trigger fear and old behaviors. To facilitate generalization of skills, the clinician can help the individual use a variety of therapeutic activities outside of the treatment room, such as\n\nbringing peers into the treatment setting;\n\nplanning strategies to use in the classroom, cafeteria, or playground or at work;\n\ntaking outings to stores and other businesses; and\n\nmaking telephone calls.\n\nThe SLP can use audio- or videoconferencing to augment this type of treatment.\n\nPrior to developing generalization activities, the SLP needs to consider the individual’s profile.\n\nTo foster generalization, assignments adhere to a hierarchy of linguistic skills and environmental stressors. The assignments begin in supportive, low-fear situations and slowly evolve to more challenging situations and settings as the individual demonstrates the ability to accept or tolerate potential negative reactions.\n\nReasonable Accommodations\n\nChildren and adolescents with fluency disorders may qualify for accommodations whether or not they have an active individualized education program (IEP). Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (United States Department of Labor, n.d.) protects qualified individuals from discrimination based on their disability via a 504 plan. The plan outlines reasonable accommodations for speaking or reading activities to help ensure a student’s academic success and access to the learning environment in school. This law also applies to organizations that receive financial assistance from any federal department or agency.\n\nReasonable accommodations include\n\nusing audio/video recording,\n\nincreasing the time provided for an oral reading or presentation,\n\nproviding an alternative assignment to oral reading, and\n\naltering the size of the group or audience.\n\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 also applies to individuals with disabilities in a work setting. It applies protections to ensure that programs and employment environments are accessible and to provide aids and services necessary for effective communication in these settings. Reasonable accommodations would vary by work setting and type of work.\n\nSee ASHA’s Practice Portal resource on Postsecondary Transition Planning.\n\nCluttering Treatment\n\nBecause the theory behind cluttering is that speakers are talking at a rate that is too fast for their systems to handle, techniques that help regulate speech rate, such as increased pausing, often are helpful. In fact, increased pausing alone may increase speech fluency and intelligibility for those who clutter (Scaler Scott & Ward, 2013). However, fluency shaping approaches, such as easy onset or continuous phonation, may not be appropriate for the treatment of cluttering.\n\nThere has been some documentation of the use of stuttering modification strategies to help those who clutter (Ward, 2006). Such strategies include simulating a fast rate of speech and applying pausing and/or simulating overarticulated speech and applying increased emphasis to increase intelligibility. These simulations and applications of strategies might be most likened to cancellation and pull-out techniques used in stuttering.\n\nOther strategies for treating cluttering include overemphasizing multisyllabic words and word endings, increasing awareness of when a communication breakdown occurs (e.g., through observation of listener reactions), and increasing self-regulation of rate and clarity of speech.\n\nSome people who clutter tend to decrease volume at the ends of sentences or phrases and, therefore, can benefit from learning to keep a steady volume throughout their utterances.\n\nCultural and Linguistic Considerations\n\nIndividuals and families may have a wide range of beliefs about the best way to treat fluency disorders, ranging from medical and therapeutic intervention to prayer. Some families may decide to send children to live with relatives or ask children not to speak in public (Shenker, 2013). Clinicians need to be mindful of different beliefs and the stress imposed on the individual and family during treatment. See ASHA’s Practice Portal page on Cultural Responsiveness.\n\nBehavioral treatments that address improved speech fluency appear to be effective across a range of cultures and languages (Finn & Cordes, 1997). Improvements in fluency may generalize spontaneously from a treated language to an untreated language in bilingual speakers (Roberts & Shenker, 2007).\n\nTreatment outcomes for bilingual children who stutter do not appear to be different from those of monolingual children who stutter (Shenker, 2011). Parent involvement may be a beneficial approach for addressing fluency issues in a bilingual child. Engaging parents in treatment helps to achieve carryover in the home environment and helps with treatment across languages (Shenker, 2013).\n\nTreatment for all communication disorders, including fluency disorders, may necessitate adjustments to protocols, processes, and approaches for bilingual individuals. Adjustments can include\n\nmodifying instructions to accommodate the home language,\n\nusing exemplars in audio or video format in the home language, and\n\nproviding opportunities to practice fluency in linguistically and culturally relevant contexts and activities.\n\nFor bilingual individuals, it is important for the clinician to consider the language or languages used during intervention. As indicated in the ASHA Code of Ethics (ASHA, 2023), SLPs are obligated to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services, regardless of the clinician’s personal culture, practice setting, or caseload demographics. Bilingual clinicians who have the necessary clinical expertise to treat the individual may not always be available. When a bilingual clinician is not available, using an interpreter is a viable option. See ASHA’s Practice Portal pages on Collaborating With Interpreters, Transliterators, and Translators and Multilingual Service Delivery in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology.\n\nCounseling\n\nCounseling is an integral part of the assessment and treatment of individuals who stutter or clutter. SLPs’ counseling skills should be used specifically to help speakers improve their quality of life by minimizing the burden of their communication disorder. The use of counseling in other areas of the speaker’s life—that is, those not directly related to communication—is outside the scope of practice for SLPs (ASHA, 2016). Referral to another helping professional should be made if a condition or situation falls outside of the SLP’s scope of practice.\n\nCounseling allows the clinician who works with those who stutter or clutter to practice within the ICF framework by targeting all aspects of the disorder—not just the surface behaviors. Effective counseling is important for encouraging individuals with a fluency disorder to share information in the affective, cognitive, and social domains.\n\nCounseling helps an individual, a family member, or a caregiver of a person of any age who stutters move from the current scenario to a preferred scenario through an agreed-upon action plan (Egan, 2013). An effective client–clinician relationship facilitates the identification of potential roadblocks (Plexico et al., 2010). This relationship is recognized as one of the common factors that account for the effectiveness of counseling (common factors theory; Wampold, 2001).\n\nClinicians need to be familiar with various counseling principles and approaches (Luterman, 2006; Zebrowski & Schum, 1993). Counseling begins with active listening and continues with microskills (Egan, 2013) that emphasize attending, showing empathy, demonstrating shared interest in the individual/family, and working to build trust.\n\nSee ASHA’s Practice Portal pages on Counseling For Professional Service Delivery and Cultural Responsiveness for more information related to counseling.\n\nTreatment Readiness\n\nTreatment for fluency disorders helps the individual make changes that will facilitate communication in a variety of settings. One of the most widely used models of change is the transtheoretical or “stages of change” model (Prochaska & DiClemente, 2005). This model describes stages in the process of behavioral change, and it can be used to determine an individual’s readiness to make a change.\n\nThe model describes the following stages of behavioral change:\n\nPrecontemplation—not intending to take action and may be unaware of the problem.\n\nContemplation—starting to realize there is a problem and considering taking action.\n\nPreparation—intending to take action and may start taking small changes to change behaviors.\n\nAction—making specific overt changes to change behaviors.\n\nMaintenance—sustaining changes and working toward preventing relapse.\n\nTermination—having no temptation to return to older habits.\n\nSee Manning and DiLollo (2018) and Floyd et al. (2007) for a description of how the “stages of change” model can be applied to fluency therapy. Their description details the characteristics of each stage, along with treatment goals and processes appropriate for each stage.\n\nTreatment Progress\n\nClinicians can help clients progress to active stages through building self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is a positive belief in one’s own ability to successfully accomplish a set goal that is task dependent, which comes from (a) past experiences of mastery, (b) vicarious experiences, (c) verbal persuasion, and (d) emotional/physical states (Boyle, 2013a, 2013b, 2015; Boyle et al., 2018; Carter et al., 2017).\n\nOften, there are pivotal points during treatment that indicate progress (T. K. Anderson & Felsenfeld, 2003; Plexico et al., 2005).\n\nThese include when the individual who stutters\n\nis more open and willing to disclose and talk about their stuttering;\n\nreports effectively modulating anxiety;\n\nexperiences reduced impact from stuttering;\n\ngeneralizes attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors across contexts;\n\nreports feeling more authentic and enjoying social conversations; and\n\nreports changing conception of stuttering from exclusively negative to having positive features.\n\nOverall, these indicators demonstrate progression from avoidance and negative impact to acceptance, openness, and increased socialization (V. M. Sheehan & Sisskin, 2001).\n\nService Delivery\n\nSee the Service Delivery section of the Fluency Disorders Evidence Map for pertinent scientific evidence, expert opinion, and client/caregiver perspective.\n\nService delivery for fluency disorders encompasses, among other factors, treatment format, provider(s), dosage, timing, and setting. Fluency treatment is a dynamic process; service delivery may change over time as the individual’s needs change.\n\nFormat\n\nFormat refers to the manner in which a client receives treatment—individually, as part of a group, or both. There are benefits of both individual and group treatment.\n\nIndividual treatment allows for\n\nfocused teaching of new skills and\n\ndiscussion of personal issues (e.g., prior to, or in addition to, targeting generalization of skills in a group setting).\n\nGroup treatment allows the individual to\n\npractice treatment targets with more listeners,\n\npractice monitoring each other’s speech and secondary behaviors,\n\nhave a sense of belonging and experience less stigma,\n\ngain insights from others who may be further along in treatment,\n\nhave opportunities to gain self-confidence from mentoring others, and\n\nprovide and receive support from others who share the experience of stuttering.\n\nProvider\n\nProvider refers to the person providing treatment (e.g., SLP, trained volunteer, family member, or caregiver). The primary provider of fluency treatment is the SLP.\n\nParental involvement is an integral part of any treatment plan for children who stutter. The SLP can instruct parents in how to modify the environment to enhance fluency and reduce communication pressure. Parents can also learn about how to help their child generalize skills from the treatment room to different settings and with different people. SLPs can include teachers in the treatment process by educating them about fluency disorders, involving them in treatment sessions, and having them assist with assignments outside of treatment sessions.\n\nAdults also may want to involve family members, friends, or coworkers as part of a treatment plan. For example, an individual might elect to self-disclose in a workplace and educate coworkers about fluency disorders via a group presentation followed by a question-and-answer period.\n\nDosage\n\nDosage refers to the frequency, intensity, and duration of treatment.\n\nDosage depends largely on the nature of the treatment (e.g., direct, indirect), age group, and the task level (e.g., learning basic skills requires more clinic room practice than does generalization).\n\nShort-term intensive treatment programs have been used for some individuals to reduce disfluency and address negative attitudes. Time and expense are considerations along with attention to generalization and treatment needs following an intensive program (Cooper, 1979).\n\nScheduling concerns, cost, and insurance reimbursement also are likely to be factors affecting dosage. Given these potential issues, determining dosage often comes down to the professional opinion of the SLP and the needs of the individual.\n\nTiming\n\nTiming refers to the initiation of treatment relative to the diagnosis.\n\nFluency treatment can occur at any point after the diagnosis. In general, the earlier preschool stuttering is addressed (relative to its onset), the easier it is to manage (Onslow & O’Brian, 2012).\n\nFor school-age children and adolescents, initiation of treatment depends, in large part, on their motivation, which, in turn, is dependent on factors such as their perceived needs, the degree of adverse impact they experience, and their previous treatment experiences.\n\nWith adults, initiation of treatment depends on the individual’s previous positive or negative intervention experiences and current needs pertaining to their fluency and the impact of their fluency disorder on communication in day-to-day activities and participation in various settings (e.g., community or work).\n\nSetting\n\nSetting refers to the location of treatment (e.g., home, community-based [including work settings], school environments, clinic room).\n\nIndividuals with disfluencies are seen in all of the typical speech-language pathology service settings, including private practices, university clinics, hospitals, and schools.\n\nTechnology has been incorporated into the delivery of services for fluency, including the use of telepractice to deliver face-to-face services remotely.
