        "text": "A rather underwhelming filmography in the end. An unforgettable title, a few pearls, and one or two amusing curiosities. This is how one could describe the career of the English director Mike Hodges, who died on December 17, at the age of 90, in the county of Dorset in the southwest of the United Kingdom.\n\nBorn in Bristol on July 29, 1932, Hodges started his career as a chartered accountant before serving two years in the Royal Navy where he was involved in minesweeping operations in numerous ports in the north of the UK. Here he encountered a world of scarcity and misery which, as he recounted later in life, would turn him into an angry young man. He went on to enter the world of television, working initially as a teleprompter operator. He soon climbed up the ranks and found himself writing scripts, producing and directing documentaries on political and cultural affairs. It was in 1971, after seeing Rumour, a television drama that Hodges had directed for the ITV Playhouse, that Michael Caine, who had started producing with Michael Klinger, decided to offer him the film adaptation of a novel he had bought the rights to, Get Carter by Ted Lewis (published 1970).\n\nA tale of revenge\n\nGet Carter, Mike Hodges' first feature film, is considered to be one of the great British gangster films of all time. It is a gritty tale of revenge set in the harsh world of Newcastle gangland. Michael Caine plays a cold and emotionless character, a pure machine devoid of empathy, guided by his libido and a kind of cold and cynical rage and determined to track down those responsible for his brother's death. The pounding beat of Roy Budd's music provides the soundtrack to this journey into the hell of this northern England industrial city. After the film's box office success, Hodges went on to make another film with Michael Caine in 1972. Pulp, which was again produced by Michael Caine and Michael Klinger, was a kind of ironic introspection (perhaps a little too much) telling the story of a detective novel writer trying to piece together the mystery of who killed a man, played by Mickey Rooney, an actor known for portraying gangsters, who had hired him to ghostwrite his autobiography.\n\nIn 1974, the science fiction thriller adapted from a Michael Crichton novel, The Terminal Man, was a flop at the box office but earned him the admiration of Stanley Kubrick. Hodges was then asked to direct the sequel to Richard Donner's horror hit, The Omen. He began shooting Damien: The Omen II before being fired by producer Harvey Bernhard and replaced by Don Taylor. The reasons for the dismissal were unclear: \"artistic\" differences, the director's contemptuous attitude towards the team, and heated discussions with a producer who could have very well pulled a gun from his pocket.\n\nIndustrial accident\n\nIn 1980, Dino De Laurentiis, who had already approached Federico Fellini, Sergio Leone and five other filmmakers without success, offered Mike Hodges the chance to adapt Alex Raymond's science fiction comic book Flash Gordon. The filming was so hectic that Hodges referred to Flash Gordon as \"the only improvised 27 million dollar movie ever made.\" What had once been a sort of opportunistic attempt to speculate on the science fiction movie craze after the success of Star Wars became a cult movie for fans of droll kitsch and campness. The rock band Queen provided the soundtrack, which obviously contributed to the paradoxical posterity of what was originally an industrial accident.\n\nAfter the comedy science-fiction film Morons from Outer Space, in 1985, Hodges returned to what he knew best. Violent gangster films such as A Prayer for the Dying (1987), based on the Jack Higgins novel, which he disowned as he was unable to oversee the editing, Croupier (1998) and I'll Sleep When I'm Dead (2003), with Malcolm McDowell as an impressive brute. How is it that nothing really followed on from Mike Hodges' initial masterstroke at the start of his cinematographic career? That the man who wrote Get Carter only sporadically had that one opportunity to prove his talent? The filmmaker's strong and honest personality, a man who often fought the system to the point of breaking it, could perhaps explain why.\n\nJean-François Rauger\n\nTranslation of an original article published in French on lemonde.fr; the publisher may only be liable for the French version."
