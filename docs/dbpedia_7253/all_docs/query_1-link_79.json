        "text": "The Room is awful. Absolutely terrible. Probably one of the worst movies ever made. It's incompetently made, incompetently put together, with some of the worst acting, writing, editing, music, directing and probably even set design in recent memory. It should be reprehensible, but instead it is somehow one of the most hilarious movies I've ever seen, and may very well be a contender for the movie I've seen more times than any other.\n\nI guess this requires some explanation.\n\nA friend of mine, Mario Lanza (one of the funniest guys alive, in this humble author's opinion), had been spreading the word about The Room for some time before I truly knew its greatness.\n\nNo, he's not this Mario.\n\nI was told time and again that it was hilarious and life-changingly bad, and being a person who rarely listens to such suggestions, I more or less just let it roll off my shoulders and continued following whatever empty pursuits I had going on at the time. Fast-forward a ways to Fall of 2011, Fiona and I get married. A good time was had by all, and in attendance was Mario. He's always had a fairly unique sense of humor, so of the three presents he gave us (wrapped in hot pink paper and SpongeBob Squarepants stickers), one of them was a book I had loaned him a few months prior, one was a copy of A Fish Called Wanda (one of the greatest movies ever), and the other was a copy of The Room. Once the honeymoon was over and we started going through our gifts properly, on a whim, we popped in The Room.\n\nAnd our lives were changed.\n\nWatching this movie for the first time is like a surreal drug trip of hilarity. People don't talk or act as they should. Plotlines are introduced to be immediately forgotten moments later, which is impressive because some of them do seem quite important. Half of the movie is made of stock footage establishing shots, another quarter from poorly-choreographed softcore sex scenes. All of this is led by director/writer/lead actor Tommy Wiseau, who is clearly quite mad and desperate to convince everyone that he is an average American Joe, when he looks, sounds and acts like he only recently came to Earth after intercepting an intergalactic transmission of one of Ed Wood's movies and thinking, \"Hey, I think I can do this movie-making thing too! That's the idea!\"\n\nHow hard can it being?\n\nHe advertises the movie as a riveting black comedy, when in reality it's clear he was trying to film a melodrama, probably trashing an ex-girlfriend and trying to make him look as awesome as possible (SPOILER ALERT: He fails). It is inept in every way possible, and yet this ineptness has formed a great cult following, full of parodies and midnight showings (where it is customary to throw verbal abuse, and plastic spoons, at the screen) that have gained a near Rocky Horror style following. My wife and I have actually attended a midnight showing of this film with Tommy Wiseau himself in attendance, and let me say that it is truly an experience of a lifetime (if this article gets a good response, I'll probably post some of my long, rambling notes on this experience).\n\nI have made it my goal in life to share with everyone I know the greatness of this movie, so, all terrible rambling aside, let me share with you, dear readers, 10 of my favorite things about The Room.\n\nOnce this has been seen, it can't be unseen.\n\n1. The Constant Establishing Shots\n\nClose to 30% of the movie is made up of shots like this. I am not exaggerating.\n\nThe movie was filmed in Los Angeles on a soundstage, but was supposed to take place in San Francisco. How to fix this? Why, with constant establishing shots forcing the viewer to see that yes, this is supposed to take place in San Francisco! And some terrible rooftop green screen work showing the San Francisco skyline (with absolutely no wind, of course). And why not show Johnny (our lead vampire Tommy Wiseau) doing such traditionally San Francisco things as riding the cable cars! Regular non-tourists do that, do they not?\n\n2. Claudette's Admission\n\nJohnny's future-wife (never fiancée) Lisa's mom, Claudette comes over periodically to try to meddle with her daughter's life. On one random visit, we get this gem of a conversation.\n\nCLAUDETTE: I got the test results back - I definitely have breast cancer.\n\nLISA: Don't worry about it, mom. They're curing people all the time.\n\nCLAUDETTE: Oh, I know.\n\nThis plotline is never mentioned again. Fiona and I like to believe that this is due to Claudette being a pathological liar and people have learned to ignore her.\n\n3. The 90's Sex Scene Music\n\nThere are four frighteningly long sex scenes in the room, two between Johnny and Lisa, two between Lisa and Johnny's best friend, Mark. They're all clumsily put together, mostly since the actor for Mark, Greg Sestero, was nervous and refused to remove his pants, and the actress for Lisa, Juliette Danielle looks absolutely terrified to be around a naked Tommy Wiseau (so terrified that most of the footage from their second sex scene was recycled from the first). These are baffling enough on their own, but the fact that each of them is the exact length of a perfectly generic, mid-90's sounding smooth jazz song (this movie was filmed and released in the early 2000's, making this weirdly anachronistic), has always led me to believe that Tommy Wiseau didn't know how to edit music, or had some deal with the artists, where the music had to be played in full or else.\n\nThis picture doesn't come from one of the film's main sex scenes, nor does it contain any characters of consequence or music, but holy hell is it one of the most hilariously awkward faces to be put on screen in a love scene. I could not not include it.\n\n4. The Thing on Lisa's Neck\n\nNow as a general rule, I try not to make fun of people for any physical traits as that is not cool, and is usually unrelated to the quality of the movie itself. I also try not to make fun of Juliette Danielle because she clearly had a really hard time with this movie, and from what I've been able to gather has really made the best of a bad situation after having been forced through this movie. All that being said... WHAT THE HELL IS THAT THING ON THE SIDE OF HER NECK?!?!?\n\n5. The Chris-R Subplot\n\nJohnny's a really nice guy. How do we know that? Because among his many other great deeds, he has taken in a mentally handicapped boy, Denny, given him a place, put him through college, etc. However, at one point in the movie Denny gets in trouble with local drug dealer Chris-R, and that is when the magic happens. Chris-R confronts Denny on the roof of the apartment complex and threatens to shoot him in the head. Naturally, Johnny and Mark fly to his rescue, beating Chris-R up and saying they will take him to the police. Lisa and Claudette magically appear on the roof to criticize Denny's life choices (it's a deep movie), and not 30 seconds later, Johnny and Mark magically appear back on the roof with no sign of Chris-R.\n\nMy leading theory? They killed Chris-R offscreen and disposed of his body and vowed to never speak of it again (since this subplot never comes up again in the course of the movie). This in turn leads to the dissolving of their friendship.\n\nLike I said, this is a deep movie.\n\n6. The Peter Switcheroo\n\nFor half of the movie, Johnny and Mark have another friend spending time with them named Peter. He's the awkward-looking guy with the glasses right above. Halfway through film production, the actor for Peter had to leave, and so Tommy Wiseau replaced him with another actor. The guy in the photo below.\n\nThis replacement is seamless, if you ask me. (Also, yes, I am aware that he technically plays a different character, \"Steven\", but the replacement is still obvious and awkward and since his new name is unmentioned it's still really weird.)\n\n7. Tossing the Old Pigskin Around\n\nIn a constant bid to impress upon us how regular and American Johnny and his friends are, they are constantly playing catch. However, in a bid to keep all the characters in frame, they're usually playing catch from about five feet away from each other. And they still manage to fall out of frame most of the time.\n\nBrilliant filmmaking.\n\n8. Mark\n\nJohnny's best friend, Mark (we know they're best friends because this fact is mentioned close to 20 times throughout the movie), is played by producer Greg Sestero (seemingly against his will much of the time), and though his role is as poorly done as anything else in the movie, I gotta give him a lot of credit for being a good sport. His character is the most wildly all over the place, seemingly an idiot one moment and a devious mastermind the next, boiling with rage and sadness and constantly commenting on how \"people are very strange these days\" and asking things like \"Do you think girls like to cheat just like guys do?\", and yet he brings an odd charm to the character that makes him very hard for me to hate. Having met both Tommy Wiseau and Sestero at the midnight showing we attended, I was impressed by how genuinely nice Sestero was, and how apologetic for Wiseau he seemed. Later this year he's putting out a book on the insane making-of story of this movie, and I cannot wait to get a copy of it.\n\n9. The Stairway to Nowhere\n\nIn a movie full of baffling, weird goofs, this one is my personal favorite.\n\nAs stated earlier, the rooftop of the apartment building this magical film takes place in was actually a set on a soundstage with a green screen providing the skyline. This provides a rather interesting goof, as the orientation of this stairway, which clearly goes down to the left, would actually end just outside the building, presumably sending characters to their death every time they try to go downstairs. In the universe of The Room, this makes perfect sense, and is probably expected.\n\n10. The Tommy Wiseau Experience\n\nHis accent is mysterious, his dialogue is almost all dubbed, and he looks like he's probably a vampire. It's impossible to accurately encapsulate the greatness of The Tommy Wiseau Experience in a blog, so instead I'll just treat you to some of my favorite quotes of his throughout the movie.\n\n#\n\n(In casual conversation in a coffee shop, Mark asks Johnny about a new client of his)\n\nJOHNNY: I cannot tell you, it's confidential.\n\nMARK: Aw, come on, why not?\n\nJOHNNY: No, I can't. Anyway, how is your sex life?\n\n#\n\n(Johnny goes to the rooftop to think after Lisa falsely accuses him of hitting her, only to find Mark there.)\n\nJOHNNY: I did not hit her, it's not true! It's bullshit! I did not hit her! I did naaaaaaaaaaaaaht! Oh, hai Mark!\n\n#\n\n(Johnny and Mark are talking about women.)\n\nMARK: Yeah, man, you'll never know. People are very strange these days. I used to know a girl; she had a dozen guys. One of them found out about it... beat her up so bad she ended up at a hospital on Guerrero Street.\n\nJOHNNY (laughing hysterically): What a story, Mark!\n\n#\n\n(Johnny is talking to Peter.)\n\nJOHNNY: I have a serious problem with Lisa. Um, I don't think she's faithful to me. In fact, I know she isn't.\n\n#\n\n(Johnny arguing with Lisa.)\n\nJOHNNY: YOU ARE TEARING ME APART, LISA!\n\n#\n\n(Johnny overhears Claudette and Lisa talking about him.)\n\nJOHNNY: How can they say this about me? I don't believe it. I show them. I will record everything.\n\n#\n\nAnd for my personal favorite quote...\n\n(At Johnny's birthday party.)\n\nJOHNNY: Thank you, honey, this is a beautiful party! You invited all my friends. Good thinking!\n\n#\n\n\"Hai doggie!\"\n\nLike I said, this movie is awful, but it is amazing in its awfulness. If you think you're ready for an experience of complete madness and insanity like this, I cannot recommend The Room highly enough.\n\nStill, consider yourself warned.\n\nIf you now need a palette cleanse after this madness, please check out my 10 Random Things I Love About Jurassic Park and 10 Random Things I Love About Back to the Future lists. These are much better movies. And if you've seen The Room, please sound off in the comments with your favorite moments & quotes!

Yeah, I know, it's not one of my favorite months either. It's one of the hottest and ugliest stretches of summer, and it always brings back memories from when I was a kid, as this was the point that I'd usually realize that the fabled season of summer was about to come to an end.\n\nBut, now that I'm an employed adult and summer is completely irrelevant, I can look at it with a healthy sense of humor and cynicism; a healthy sense of humor and cynicism that tells me, \"Hey, you can probably make a list out of this!\" And so, in honor of the disappointing end of summer, I am going to dedicate the month of August to five of my least favorite endings in pop culture. As always, I must note that this is hardly going to be a comprehensive list, because let's face it, there's a lot of lousy endings out there. These five moments are ones that I've found disappointing, confusing, and in a couple cases even downright infuriating, and with one exception they all come from pieces of pop culture I've really enjoyed.\n\nI also shouldn't have to tell you that this list is going to have SPOILER ALERT at the top of pretty much every entry, so take that as a warning now for this one.\n\nSo sit back, relax, and let us begin our # 5 moment with...\n\nI came into the Harry Potter series fairly late in the game. My future wife, Fiona, got me a copy of the first book for my 21st birthday, and though I was hesitant to touch it at first, at her insistence (and, well, we were still just friends at the time, and I thought she was really cute, and I wanted to get in good with her...) I gave it a shot. Within three chapters I was hooked. I wound up flying through the first six books in about two months (the seventh having yet to be released), and loving almost every minute of it. Sure, there were more than a few slow spots here and there, and some plot contrivances that were pretty extreme...\n\n\"Let us never use this to fix things ever again!\"\n\n...but all in all I loved the series. Naturally, with anything you love and don't want to let go, I reread the series once or twice soon after, and though little of the magic had rubbed away, the way Rowling used some rather flimsily explained magic to rationalize almost every ending soon became apparent. But it's magic, so I excused it. However, when rereading the fourth book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, I could suspend disbelief no longer at how little sense the evil plot actually made.\n\nMostly because of this guy. More on him later.\n\nFor a quick rundown of the plot, Harry has been forced into a magical tournament that will almost certainly get him killed. Through a fair amount of cheating and outside help, he has made it to the final round of the tournament in an excellent position. In the final stretch, he and another competitor, Cedric Diggory, grab the Triwizard Cup to claim a mutual victory, however the cup soon turns out to be a Portkey (magical teleporting device) that transports them to a graveyard. Death Eaters show up, Voldemort is brought back from the grave, Harry escapes back home and finds out before too long that a teacher he's trusted throughout the year was actually another Death Eater in disguise.\n\nAlso Edwa-err, Cedric dies.\n\nNow, on paper, reading this the first time, this was all suitably dramatic and seemed to make perfect sense. However, hidden by the shock of Voldemort finally coming back from the dead is how very little sense all of this evil scheme makes.\n\nFirst and foremost, why was it necessary to put Harry in the deathsport competition in the first place? Voldemort claims to need Harry alive in order to be resurrected, wouldn't putting him through a series of trials that could very well kill him (as it is acknowledged by multiple characters this tournament is quite good at doing) kind of defeat this purpose? And what if, heaven forbid, Harry actually loses, as he was very well about to when Cedric came along?\n\nThis is a perfectly sane part of an evil scheme to kill someone, not a scheme to keep them alive!\n\nSecond, there is the issue of Mad-Eye Moody, a.k.a. Barty Crouch Jr. With the help of the shapeshifting Polyjuice Potion, Death Eater Barty Crouch Jr. impersonates Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Mad-Eye Moody and becomes fairly friendly with Harry throughout the course of an entire school year. On several occasions, he is even alone with Harry for extended periods of time. Why did he have to wait until the end of the school year to get Harry out of the school when he could have just easily stunned Harry and kidnapped him on at least a half dozen separate occasions? (And don't say anything about Hogwarts not allowing apparition, that school has more security flaws and secret ways out than it has in). Why does he spend so much time in Hogwarts surrounded by people who actually knew Mad-Eye beforehand and would be likely to figure out he's not who he says he is the longer he stays?\n\n\"My lord, can't I just stun him and-\"\n\n\"NO! THAT WON'T NEARLY LOOK COOL ENOUGH!\"\n\nI know all of this boils down to Voldemort being obsessed with making a spectacle of it, but when resurrection is on the line, being showy should really take a backseat to executing a plan with a high chance of succeeding.\n\nThe first three books had well-executed twist endings, and I think in this event, Rowling tried to outdo herself. In crafting an ending that looked cool, coherency was put by the wayside, and an already overlong and plot-hole-riddled book gets a few more massive holes punched in it. I won't necessarily call it a bad ending, but I will call it a very disappointing one.\n\nBut hey, at least Voldemort looks creepy.\n\nSo what do you think? Do you agree with my sentiments, or are you fine with the ending as is? Do you also think the Harry Potter books endings could have used less deus ex machine and a little more logic?

If you haven’t read the first two parts, it’s probably because you were one of the first to fall at the hands of some blade-wielding maniac.\n\nLike this guy.\n\nIf, however, you’re just late to the party, please be sure to check out Part 1 and Part 2 before going any further. Seriously, your life may depend on it. Go back and read those parts and then we’ll continue.\n\nAll right, you’ve read them, right? If you haven’t, I’ll know and I’ll just turn this car around and head back home without stopping for ice cream.\n\nOK, that’s better. Now, by this point you and your assorted, multiethnic collection of associates that would look good in a program broadcast on The CW have taken your shoddy car overstuffed with beer and condoms to an empty cabin in an isolated section of the woods. Now what do you do? Well, the obvious answer is “party”, and this covers most bases when considering a road trip. However, occasionally you might have to head into a populated area for supplies and more beer, and then you’ll have to deal with meeting new people. What will you do then?\n\nThis is not the right answer to that question.\n\nYes, this final chapter of our how to guide covers the ever-important guide of Road Trip Etiquette! I don’t like writing about it any more than you like reading about it, but we’ll get through it together, and then you can get back to beer and pre-marital intercourse.\n\nHooray!\n\nDEALING WITH LOCALS\n\nMost of the places that apply to the F.I.L.C.H. System of determining optimal road trip destinations will be surrounded by a group of people who, for lack of a more politically correct term, can be dubbed backwoods hicks. Normally a kind, docile people, if you show them some basic common courtesy they may very well share their love of moonshine and firearms with you. If you are nice enough, they may even invite you in for dinner!\n\nLooks delicious!\n\nHowever, if you feel the need to act unkind or the urge to show your brilliant college student superiority to them, feel free to act on these instincts. You have earned your degree and your superior understanding of the English language, this certainly makes you morally superior to them! This will certainly help you win any arguments you may have!\n\nWell, most arguments.\n\nOccasionally (but more often than you’d think) you might run across curious strangers in the woods who claim to have an understanding of mystic arts and will offer their services to you. They may be gypsies, or they may practice Voodoo or Hoodoo or one of many other old mystic arts. Feel free to disbelieve them and deride their beliefs at the top of your lungs. There’s no way that curse they just put on you could be real.\n\nThis is not the face of someone who could put a real curse you. This is the face of your grandmother after one too many martinis.\n\nSOUVENIRS\n\nWhat road trip would be complete without picking up a few souvenirs to immortalize the memories? Lots of small towns near F.I.L.C.H. appropriate areas have small curio shops that hide a lot of hidden gems! I personally recommend looking for old, leather-bound diaries that have curious drawings and occasional passages written in Latin (having something with Latin in it will really impress houseguests!), or quaint old dolls and ventriloquist dummies whose eyes curiously follow you as you walk around a room, or even old, slowly playing music boxes! Those will always impress the girls back at the cabin!\n\nThese are pretty neat and rare! Think you could solve it?\n\nLOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT\n\nLet’s face it, you’re probably going to run into a crisis on your trip where you might have to deal with local law enforcement. Maybe someone you brought along got caught shoplifting, or drunk driving, or maybe you’re being chased by an escaped lunatic who wants to kill you and wear your skin because he thinks you look like his sister who died in the tragic kiln explosion that horribly disfigured him.\n\nThis is surprisingly common.\n\nIf you’re stuck in a crisis situation, your first instinct may be to call the police. First and foremost, you should know that any place where the F.I.L.C.H. system applies won’t have cell phone reception, and any land lines that might exist have already been cut. Secondly, this would require dealing with local law enforcement, which is always a big road trip no no. Nothing ruins a weekend of debauchery and depravity faster than inviting a narrow-minded buzzkill with a badge to your party. Because of this, we recommend taking care of any crises yourself. After all, there’s nothing a few jocks armed with screwdrivers can’t fix, right?\n\nOf course, if you’re in one of those former situations where the police have caught you for some misdemeanor, we recommend lying to them. Odds are if they’re small town cops, they probably are not exceptionally bright and you can talk your way out of this trouble with ease. There is no way this will affect your chances of receiving their help should you ever need it somewhere down the line.\n\nSO YOU'VE ACCIDENTALLY KILLED A LOCAL\n\nShit.\n\nIt’s bound to happen in every road trip: you’re driving down the road blindfolded and with a blood alcohol content that would put Keith Richards into a week-long coma on a dare from your friends when you accidentally run someone down, splattering them all over the road.\n\nA lot like this.\n\nFear not, your life may not be over yet! While swearing and screaming are good first instincts to follow, an even better one would be surveying the area. Look around, see if there are any witnesses who aren’t a part of your trip. If there are many, then yes, your lives are over, get used to a jail sentence. If there are one or two, get the loudest and angriest member of your group who “can’t go to prison again!” to kill them, though by now he probably already has. If there are no witnesses, you’re one cover-up away from continuing on the vacation of a lifetime!\n\nFind a nice section of the forest, or a deep dark part of the lake, and dispose of the bodies however you can (also, make sure they’re actually dead first, this is a problem more often than you’d think). Swear all your associates to secrecy, and continue on with your trip as planned! Remember, this is your trip, never let anything get in the way of your fun!\n\nThe odds of a vengeful family member coming after you or summoning an ancient demon to kill you are pretty slim, I’m told.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nThank you for taking the time to read our valuable how to guide. We hope this has been informative and will help provide you with the best, most affordable, and most casual nudity and alcohol filled trip possible. If you happen to make it back to civilization after following this guide (doubtful though it may be), please be sure to tell everyone where you got all these awesome tips!\n\nThese guys will be thankful you’re sending new friends for them to meet.\n\nSo, has this How-To guide helped improve your summer vacation ideas?

It's overrated.\n\nHello boys and girls and all your surviving parts, welcome back to our continuing guide on having the best summer road trip possible with the help of horror movies. Hopefully by this point you have read Part 1 in our series (and if you haven't, shame on you, check it out here and report back once you have finished), and your shoddy old car is filled to the bursting point with nubile coeds and enough alcohol to paralyze a herd of elephants.\n\nIt's not as easy as it sounds.\n\nNow that you are ready to go on your road trip, it would probably be a good idea to decide on a destination. Conventional wisdom tells you that research, either online or through picking up a travel guide at your local bookstore (should one still exist), but since when has conventional wisdom been fun? Since when has conventional wisdom gotten you laid? Since when has conventional wisdom gotten you hung from the ceiling by a bunch of redneck cannibals?\n\nSuck it, conventional wisdom!\n\nLet's take a look at choosing a destination the horror movie way!\n\nUsing The \"F.I.L.C.H.\" System\n\nRight now, make a list of every major city or tourist attraction you have ever wanted to visit. Do not take your trip there. Why? Because that is where everybody else is planning on taking their trips. Tourist destinations have crowds, they have traffic, they have overpriced souvenirs, and no matter what you plan to do, by the end of the day you won't get to do it. Besides, after a long day of walking and traffic jams, you'll be too tired to take part in binge drinking and pre-marital sex!\n\nThe hallmark of any successful road trip.\n\nNo, if you want to have a memorable, and more importantly fun road trip with the ragtag group of vaguely attractive acquaintances, it's best that you apply The F.I.L.C.H. System to all of your road trip planning needs.\n\n\"Gee, Mr. Carter, what's F.I.L.C.H. stand for?\"\n\nWell, I'm glad you asked that, Billy. Though what are you doing here? I keep telling you to stay off my property. Go on, shoo!\n\nAnyway, F.I.L.C.H. stands for Forest, Isolation, Lake, Cabin and History, all of which, when applied correctly, will help create memories for a lifetime!\n\nMemories!\n\n(AUTHOR'S DISCLAIMER: For reasons not quite clear to me, almost all ideal summer road trip locations look vaguely like the area surrounding Vancouver, B.C. Science has yet to determine why this is, but I am told Canadians know how to party, so for the purposes of this article I can only assume this to be a good thing.)\n\nForest\n\nToo often in this workaday world we forget what it's like to take a breath of fresh air, and until they start marketing a brand of overpriced, country fresh canned air for the ignorant, city-dwelling masses to huff, getting out into the great green American wilderness will have to suffice. As well, a weekend in the country saves valuable money that can be better put toward stocking up your trip with alcohol and various other substances that will better enhance your road trip experience. Now in this economy, that's just good thinking!\n\nA lot of people will also tout the values of the forest, mentioning things like \"hiking\" and \"camping\" and \"wildlife.\" These people are hippies, and should be ignored. However, occasional wildlife experiences can certainly liven up an otherwise dull weekend! I recommend them only sparingly.\n\nWildlife experiences may vary from location to location.\n\nIsolation\n\nNow that you've decided to check out the forest, make sure you find an isolated location! Nothing ruins a good trip like having annoying locals, law enforcement or vital emergency personnel crash your party! A good way to tell if you've found a properly isolated location is to scream bloody murder at the top of your lungs. If nobody comes to your rescue, you've found the right place!\n\nLake\n\nThe easiest way to get your collection of road trip attendees out of their clothes and into their skimpy bathing suits is to have a body of water nearby (or tell them they're auditioning for a reality show). Because of this, I cannot recommend highly enough making sure you pick a destination near a lake. Still water, the perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes, brain-eating parasites and frequent dumping ground for experimental mutagens, is usually your best bet, as it is warmer than anything attached to a river, and as you know, warm water = skinny dipping!\n\nSome people are bigger fans of skinny-dipping than others.\n\nCabin\n\nUnless you brought an RV or are really big into camping, you're going to need a roof over your head for the duration of your trip. Thankfully every isolated forest you will come across is literally riddled with rustic cabins that you'll be able to better enjoy your vacation in. Consult a travel agent to rent a good one, or to skip the money part of the equation entirely, just settle in the first empty cabin you come across! I'm sure its owners won't mind in the slightest! Of course, you can never guarantee you'll get a cabin that's in mint condition, so there may be some necessary repairs, and the wind sneaking in through the corners may very well sound like low voices telling you to \"join them\" or to kill all your friends with a hacksaw and a sack full of lemons.\n\nThis is perfectly normal and best to be ignored.\n\nHistory\n\nNow, if you're one of the unfortunate few out there who wants to do more than just teenaged to mid-20-something debauchery on your road trip, the easiest and cheapest method is to travel to some place that has a history you can explore. Thankfully, history is easier to find than you think. Search your forest hard enough and you'll likely find a building or series of buildings that can best be described as \"abandoned\". While some find that word a little ominous, \"abandoned\" should translate to you as \"a gateway to history!\" Feel free to explore these buildings to your heart's content to better absorb the local color! And remember, because they're abandoned, it means it belongs to nobody so it's perfectly acceptable to pick up and take anything you find that you may like. Abandoned hospitals and mental institutions often have cool medical equipment/experiments to play with, abandoned summer camps often have firearms, canoes and rusty cutlery, and do I really need to spell out for you the kind of fun that can be had at abandoned cemeteries/Indian burial grounds? Really, let history stimulate your imagination!\n\nOf course, The F.I.L.C.H. System is more a set of guidelines than a hard set of rules that must be followed to have a fun road trip experience. Throw a little imagination into it. The forest not your thing? Why not check out some of America's empty stretches of desert? Or how about checking out an abandoned island? Or why not check out that science lab your old uncle works at that has mysteriously gone silent a few days ago? Honestly, as long as you can keep the beer flowing, the pre-marital sex pre-marital, and your road trip associates in a state of perpetual argument, you'll be fine.\n\nIsn't that right, Cropsy?\n\nThis concludes Part 2 of our ongoing series. Keep an eye out in the near future for Part 3, where we will be discussing Road Trip Etiquette!\n\nSo, has this How-To guide helped improve your summer vacation ideas?

Don't worry, there's still plenty of unnecessary pop culture analysis mixed in here as well.\n\nIn writing the third book of The Prospero Chronicles, I've met the challenge of playing with a character archetype I never really thought I'd get around to: the bully. Having been mostly invisible in my school days I never really encountered that many bullies in real life, and I've never found that many of the ones in pop culture to be particularly compelling. Oh sure, there's plenty of iconic and entertaining ones out there if you look around a little (just pick a random 80's teen movie, any one, you'll find one), like Biff Tannen, Nelson Muntz, Draco Malfoy, Douglas C. Neidermeyer...\n\nOgre...\n\n...the list goes on. However, with very few exceptions I can't say I've ever found most bully characters to be particularly interesting. Sure, you can get a good actor in their shoes and these deficiencies can be ignored, but until I started writing a bully I could never really put my finger on just what my problem with bully characters was, but now I think I've got it. By the very nature of storytelling conventions, most bullies border on completely insane.\n\nMaybe not meme-level insane, but you get the idea.\n\nIn most stories, bullies fill an antagonist's role, where their goal is to make the main character's life a living hell. This is fine and all, bullies do do this in real life, and yay for realism, right? However, given the narrow perspective of fictional stories, far too often we are just given a thinly drawn character whose antagonism for the hero borders on a level of obsession that H.P. Lovecraft would call excessive.\n\nFor a good example of this, let's take a look at Draco Malfoy.\n\nHi Draco!\n\nHe's in the Harry Potter series from the very beginning, and is ostensibly a rival of Harry's, but at best he only ever rises to the level of annoying tertiary antagonist, and at worst he's an annoying borderline stalker. Notice the word annoying in both parts. Instead of ever proving to be a serious danger to Harry, Draco spends most of his time obsessing about how much he hates Harry, or what Harry is doing, or what Harry's friends are doing, until it makes you start to wonder if he's got Harry Potter posters covering his room in Slytherin house. We know he even fumes over him in private, as we sneak into what he thinks is a private conversation in Chamber of Secrets and he's talking about... yup, Harry Potter. He follows Harry everywhere, he harasses Harry and his friends every chance he gets, is ridiculously popular (for some reason, we never see why even the other Slytherins tolerate him), and up until the last two books of the series, when he is developed some, dedicating most of his free time toward making Harry's life a living hell. On top of that, regular jokes are made of his cowardice, and he's physically hurt and/or mutilated as a punchline fairly regularly.\n\nHow he spends the other half of the books when not harassing Harry.\n\nIn small doses, any number of these behaviors are perfectly acceptable in a fictional bully. However, when your bully solely exists as a distorted mirror of your hero, where he's there only to show you what the hero is not and has no real character to him otherwise, you've got a problem. For a bully to be a real threat to the hero, they need to be more than just an obstacle; they need to be a character who has reasons for doing what they're doing. They can't just bully because they like doing it, or because they're just plain evil. They should actually get something out of the act of bullying, or at the very least have a rationalization for their behavior that works in their own twisted mind. Or take a page from the real world where they bully because they get even worse treatment at home and this is their easiest path to power (it's depressing, but if done well it's effective).\n\nAs well, their relationship to the hero needs to be taken into consideration. It's fine for them to butt heads occasionally, or even often, but unless you're writing a horror story about dangerous obsession, the bully would still have a life outside of harassing the hero. The hero cannot be their entire life. Show me the bully hanging out on the street, or walking his dog, or going to the grocery store, or, shocker of all shocks, DOING SOMETHING NOT EVIL! (Not that I'm implying that hanging out, walking the dog or going to the grocery store are inherently evil). It's unheard of, I know, and it may take up a few valuable words, but developing a bully even just a little beyond how they relate to the hero can really expand them as a character.\n\nI hope I'm doing this right. The bully character we just introduced into The Prospero Chronicles is so far proving a lot of fun to write for. He's loud, he's abrasive, and he spends a lot of time making one character's life hell, however we've made it clear that he does have other interests in life and lives by an odd code of honor and morality that doesn't always make sense, but always makes sense to him. Whether or not he actually works out is for the readers to decide, but I think he'll prove fun at the very least.\n\nAs for the rest of those fictional bullies out there... I just want to see a little respect thrown their way. I want to see them as more rounded out characters and not just straw men. I want to see them actually work with the story instead of having them just be a crutch for it. I want to see them be as dangerous as their stories demand they be.\n\nExcept you Stan Gable. You stay magnificently blonde and douchey.\n\nSo what do you think, dear readers and fellow authors? What are your thoughts on the bully dilemma ?

It's summer here in the good old U-S-of-A, an important time in all young people's lives. It is a time for celebration, a time for relaxation, and a time for one of those most important of young human rituals: the great American road trip. Now, you will find all sorts of guides that will help you have a perfectly peaceful trips, but where is the excitement? Where's the adventure? Where's the wildly dangerous risk-taking that could end with an unintentional body count? No, this guide isn't for those who want just another boring, old trip. This guide is designed for those of you out there who can't have a good time without fleeing from a deranged maniac wielding a chainsaw and wearing the skin of your best friend or awakening an eldritch horror with a thirst for the blood of the innocent from its ancient slumber.\n\nOr one of these. I have no idea what the hell this is.\n\nThroughout the month of July I will be posting a series of how-to guides to better help you plan a thrilling, once-in-a-lifetime summer road trip! Part 1 in our series covers the necessary step of pre-trip planning.\n\nBEFORE ANYTHING ELSE, ASK YOURSELF, \"WHY AM I TAKING THIS TRIP?\"\n\nNow, a lot of people will tell you to know why you are taking your trip and plan accordingly. They'll tell you all sorts of things about \"sightseeing\" or \"relaxation\" or \"family fun\". These people are boring. Real trips are about the journey, not the destination. Why make great plans for a trip when you can just randomly show up at your destination and let nature take its course?\n\nNature!\n\nCHOOSING YOUR VEHICLE\n\nTypical wisdom says that, when planning a road trip, make sure your car is in proper, working order. Take it into a shop before you leave for your trip, and always make sure you've got a fresh battery, air in the tires, and a tank full of gas. Now where's the fun in that? Doing these things before you head out takes up valuable time that could instead be spent on life's finer pursuits, namely underage drinking and premarital intercourse. And taking a new car? New cars lack space. I recommend taking the oldest, most beaten-up looking vehicle you can find. Not only can you fit more people in these, generally, but they're a lot less likely to get stolen! It's win-win!\n\nSure, your car will probably break down or fail to start when you need it most, but the memories of what you did instead of getting your car taken care of will last a lifetime, however long that may be!\n\nInstances of this happening are pretty rare, I'm told.\n\nPACKING FOR YOUR TRIP\n\nSpace will always be at a premium in your car on this road trip, so remember to reserve as much of it as possible for alcohol. You never know when you'll be able to find another liquor store in whatever abandoned stretch of the middle of nowhere you decide to have your trip, so remember to BYOB! Not enough room? No problem! Feel free to eliminate other unnecessary items that you may or may not have already packed, like clothing, spare tires or sensible footwear!\n\nRepeatedly tripping in a comical manner will make you the life of the party!\n\nIn this day and age where everyone and everything has a video camera somewhere in it, also be sure to bring along with you plenty of extra memory/film and batteries. You never know when you're going to want to film 8-72 hours straight, even past the point where recording everything seems like a sensible idea!\n\nThese kids sure knew how to have fun with a camera!\n\nWHO TO BRING\n\nTip: Be sure to bring people with lots of personality, as defined in this picture.\n\nWhen deciding who you wish to take your road trip with, first make a list of all of your close friends and family. Do not invite any of these people. What fun is it traveling with people you already know and trust? You already know and trust them. Why not take your trip with a bunch of good-looking, near-interesting, casual acquaintances? By taking your trip with relative strangers, you always stand a chance at making new friends and even more exciting memories. If you're having trouble thinking of anyone to bring, consider the bringing one (or all) of the following types of people you probably already know!\n\nThe Jock\n\nYou never know when you'll need to do some heavy lifting, so it is always important to have at least one of these around, and in a crisis they often think they are great leaders! As a general note, the louder and dumber they are, the stronger they are. Consider this when choosing your jock.\n\nThe Practical Joker\n\nThey keep things interesting, even if their jokes aren't particularly funny. If one of these cannot be found on short notice, they can be easily substituted with \"The Nerd\" or \"The Slacker\" or, if you are truly desperate, \"The Hippie.\" Though the last one might not be easy to find in this day and age, consider yourself lucky if you can as they often have stores of certain illegal substances that can really liven up the trip.\n\nIf you're truly lucky, you'll find someone who fits all these types.\n\nThe Bombshell\n\nYou do plan on \"getting some\" on this road trip, as the kids today say, right? Well, stock up on some bombshells! Often blonde, often cheerleaders, and often prone to screaming and exploring strange noises while scantily clad, they are a welcome addition to any great road trip. Did I mention they're often scantily clad? Feel free to bring as many as can be fit into your vehicle without losing necessary alcohol space!\n\nThe Heartthrob\n\nSee \"THE BOMBSHELL\", replace blonde with \"dreamy\" and cheerleaders with \"struggling musicians\". All other text remain the same.\n\nThe Bad Boy\n\nHis eyes are soulful, his past is troubled, and he may or may not give into his dark urges with the proper push. He'll add a necessary air of mystery and possibly even some excitement should anything unplanned occur!\n\nThe \"Why Did We Bring Them Along?\"\n\nNobody knows them and nobody even knows who invited them, but nobody will be able to ignore their presence. Every road trip should have one person everyone constantly questions why they were brought, be it due to obnoxiousness, kleptomania, debilitating fear of moths or rank body odor (preferably all of the above). By bringing someone like this along, any mistakes you make will be readily forgotten.\n\nThe Good Girl\n\nEven if your trip is mostly an excuse for debauchery, it's never a bad idea to bring along a quiet, virginal girl. She's sweet, she works as a solid moral compass and is good at dispensing sensible advice. As a general rule, the more of her advice you ignore, the more fun your trip will be.\n\nThe Hitchhiker\n\nNever be afraid of picking up hitchhikers. After all, what's the worst that could happen?\n\nSo ends Part 1 of our special How-To guide! Stay tuned for our next entry, \"Choosing a Location\"!\n\nBack to the Future is one of my all time favorite movies, which is probably for the best considering how weirdly tied to my life it has always been. First, there's the fact that it was released on July 3rd, 1985, which just so happens to be the day I was born (so, yeah, today both Back to the Future and me turn 28, woo!) Second, and perhaps weirder, is the fact that when I was 3, dad and I moved onto one of the main streets that Back to the Future was filmed on (Bushnell Avenue in South Pasadena, CA for those of you who are interested). Remember the scene where George falls out of the tree while spying on Lorraine? Yeah, I used to walk by that tree and that house every day on the way to high school.\n\nThough the view wasn't always this good.\n\nSo, much as I did for another of my childhood classics, Jurassic Park, today I shall honor 10 Random Things I Love About Back to the Future.\n\n1. The Unexplained Giant Amplifier\n\nI love the fact that Doc Brown has a giant amplifier in his lab for no particular reason, and that Marty, heedless of the fact that Doc's not had the greatest track record as an inventor, turns the amp up to levels that should probably have killed him and plugs his guitar into it. Destroying the (presumably very expensive and time-consuming to build) amp and being blown across the room was really the best case scenario here.\n\nAlso, obscure Stanley Kubrick references for the win!\n\n2. Damn! Damn, Damn!\n\nI couldn't find a good picture of Doc saying his favorite swear word while cursing Marty's timing at the end, but still... say it with me people...\n\n3. Old Man Peabody's Farm & Causality\n\nOne of my favorite little time travel jokes in the movie comes from the mention of how the test site at the beginning of the movie, the parking lot for the Twin Pines Mall, used to be a farm run by an old crazy man named Peabody who had a thing for growing pine trees. Well, when Marty travels back in time, he accidentally runs over one of the twin pines out in front of the farm.\n\nLater, when Marty comes back to the future, without any fanfare whatsoever, the mall's name has suddenly changed to:\n\nA simple little joke that never ceases to make me laugh.\n\n4. How Differently This Movie Plays When You're a Kid and an Adult\n\nBack to the Future is widely considered one of the greatest family movies of all time if the fine people at ABC Family are to be believed, and if they don't know family I don't want to know who does. I can see why this is the case; it's got some great jokes, some physical comedy (hey, look at Biff getting covered in crap!), and some of the most iconic adventure scenes of all time.\n\nWhat's often ignored, however, is that much of this plot hinges on attempted incest, voyeurism and rape that very nearly undoes the fabric of the universe. Sure, when you're a kid it's funny to see Michael J. Fox's mom trying to make out with him, but when you're an adult and realize the implications it suddenly gets a lot weirder than funny. George is also made out to be a peeping tom, which is more or less shrugged off as a joke even though I'm pretty sure it was still illegal back in 1955. Then there's the fact that, right up until the point that George comes to the rescue, it's made pretty clear that Biff was going to rape Lorraine in the car. Now, I love a good heroic arc as much as anyone, but was it really necessary to go *this* far? Couldn't George have just impressed Lorraine by beating up Biff because he was just a jackass?\n\nNo matter. Watching this movie as a kid and then rewatching it as an adult really adds to the experience, even if that experience is now filled with occasional awkward silences.\n\nHey look! Biff's gang is being casually racist again!\n\n5. Biff\n\nReally, is there a better 80's teen movie villain than Biff Tannen? He's rude, he's violent, and the way that he messes up every clichéd joke he ever attempts to say is still makes me laugh like hell. Thomas F. Wilson brings a tremendous amount of charm to what would otherwise be a generic bully character, and proves himself to be a great sport after letting his character's trademark be that he will be buried in manure at some point during every Back to the Future movie. I remember back just after we'd moved down to South Pasadena, they were filming part of Back to the Future Part II on our street. We got a chance to watch them film the scene where Biff tosses a kid's ball up onto a nearby balcony, and between takes he would come out and say hi to all the neighborhood kids who'd come to watch. Though I didn't get to say hi myself (I was a shy kid, what can I say), I was told he was a really nice guy.\n\n\"Now why don't you make like a tree... and get the hell out of here.\"\n\n6. Your Cousin? Mar-vin Ber-ry?\n\nThough this joke is kinda awesome, at the same time it creates a rather odd time travel paradox where the song Johnny B. Goode apparently only exists because of time travel. Though this probably should have done some damage to the space-time continuum, it's still a fun gag.\n\n7. Doc's Model\n\nLike any good mad scientist obsessed with accuracy, Doc likes to make models to demonstrate his plans. Of course, also like any good mad scientist, his models rarely work properly, and occasionally burst into flames. Watching Doc go from \"confident scientist\" to \"guy trying to make sure his garage doesn't burn down\" is one of the great little comedy moments in this film.\n\n\"You're instilling a lot of confidence in me, Doc.\"\n\n8. Darth Vader From the Planet Vulcan\n\nI can relate to George McFly. While I can't claim to have been as awkward as he was in high school, I was pretty close there, and if the fate of the universe rested on my successfully having to ask the prettiest girl in school out to prom... yeah, I'd probably have needed someone posing as an alien threatening to melt my brain to get me to do it, and even then that'd probably have been after I asked him how much melting my brain would hurt. Marty's combination of pop culture references, a radiation suit and some torture by 80's heavy metal will always make this one of the great 80's movie scenes.\n\n9. The Finale\n\nA lot of films like to end with a race against time, but very few of them are quite as literal as Back to the Future's. In order to get back to 1985, Marty has to get the time machine up to 88 miles per hour and strike a wire at the precise instant a bolt of lightning hits the clock tower, all while Doc struggles to keep the wire in place in the middle of a violent windstorm. You know everything is going to work out, but it is all so tightly paced and the music so thrilling that it keeps you on the edge of your seat up until the last moment.\n\n10. Roads? Where We're Going, We Don't Need Roads!\n\nGreatest. Closing. Line. Ever.\n\nBONUS 11th ENTRY:\n\nYeah, you'll never watch the series the same way again, will you?\n\nSo, can anyone truthfully tell me that they wouldn't want a time-travelling DeLorean?

For the most part I have embraced moments that have made me laugh as much as they made me recognize the awesomeness of the zombie subgenre of horror (and, on occasion, proved pretty damn scary). I would like to end this month, however, with what I want to recognize as a moment that is both underrated and tremendously sad from one of the new classics of the genre, 28 Days Later... . (For another tremendously sad zombie movie moment, please check out my wife Fiona's blog here, as she takes on one of the all-time classic moments from Night of the Living Dead)\n\n28 Days Later... takes place in an England ravaged by a virus called Rage that transforms people into bloodthirsty cannibals. While not strictly dead (they can be killed by pretty much any conventional means), they are fast, vicious and mindless and are among the creepiest zombies put onscreen.\n\nThe bright red eyes help a lot in this department.\n\nMost of the attention that is paid to this movie are to the first and third acts, and deservedly so. The first act, featuring our protagonist, Jim, who has missed the apocalypse thanks to a coma and wakes up in a completely abandoned London, is one of the creepiest extended scenes in movie history. Having actually been to London and seen a lot of the places featured in this film, it is truly amazing and eerie to see them completely abandoned (without the aid of visual effects to boot!). The third act, after Jim has joined up with a small band of survivors, is perhaps the best-executed \"man is the real monster\" endings in zombie movies, as the military men who save our heroes show their true colors and their true desires for how they want to live in a post-apocalyptic world.\n\nI know it comes as a huge surprise that a guy who looks like this proves untrustworthy.\n\nOften ignored, however, is the film's second act, which despite having the odd Rage Zombie pop up here and there, is actually kind of a sweet, family road trip style diversion.\n\nThey could almost be the Griswolds, if the Griswolds offed zombies with machetes.\n\nAt this point in the movie, Jim and another survivor he's met, Selena, run into a father and daughter, Frank and Hannah, living in apartment tower in London. They're good-hearted people, but not as well-suited for the zombie apocalypse as they could be. Though they're reluctant to join forces, the fact that Frank has access to a cab and they have a working radio that has picked up a broadcast from a military unit promising safety in the countryside, Jim and Selena decide to tag along. The middle act of this movie, after a thrilling escape from the city, then becomes something of a road trip adventure, where we see this group bond and really come to like each other as they loot grocery stores and have some small side adventures. They even allow themselves to relax for a short while, breaking through the shells of most of the survivors. Jim no longer feels alone in the world, tough and stoic Selena starts cracking a smile, Hannah can start acting like a kid again, and Frank, despite his responsibilities to the group and his daughter, allows himself to see the beauty that still exists in the world.\n\nStopping to watch some wild horses frolicking across the moors is not something you usually see in a zombie movie.\n\nHowever, the peace and beauty of this little trip isn't to last. When they reach the roadblock where the military is supposed to be waiting, they find it abandoned, save for a few dead bodies. Frustrated that this journey had been for naught, Frank yells at his daughter and storms off. Seeing a crow on a platform above him, munching on the dead body of one of the infected, Frank yells at it and kicks the platform, causing the crow to fly off, and a single drop of blood to hit him in the eye.\n\nDamned crows.\n\nHe knows this is a death sentence, and that he has, at best, 30 seconds before he joins the infected and tries to kill his newly formed family. Hannah comes to him, and sadly he apologizes for yelling at her a few moments before. At that he starts yelling and shrieking for her to keep away as he starts seizing and spitting, shrieking the whole way as he is transformed, while Selena pleads for Jim to kill him in front of his daughter before he completely turns and comes after them. Jim hesitates, because he likes Frank and doesn't want to scar his daughter for life, but he prepares to kill him just as Frank turns completely... and is promptly shot to death by the military who had been hiding and watching this whole scene go down.\n\nIt's a sad turn of events leading into a dark, twisted path of an ending, in one of the best zombie films in recent memory, and a completely deserving contender for my # 1 favorite zombie moment.\n\nGoodbye, Frank, you will be missed.\n\nSo has a zombie movie ever made you cry? What is your favorite zombie movie moment? Sound off in the comments!\n\nAs always, please take the time to like me on Facebook or follow me on Twitter! I’m big into liking/following back, so just drop me a line!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/mattcarterauthor\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MCarterAuthor\n\nWhenever I go into a movie I’m pretty sure I’m not going to like, or that has received some pretty awful reviews, I go in telling myself, “I’m going to see this with an open mind.” Ideally this should be the mindset of any reviewer, because if you go into a movie knowing exactly what you’re going to think of it going out, then why bother going in the first place? Still, though, over time this saying has gone from something I say to actually open my mind, to something I say defensively, something that protects me in the event I actually don’t like what I’m watching so I can say, “Well, I gave it a fair chance, AND IT FAILED ME!!!” It’s stupid, it’s childish, and it is probably something I will do until the end of time.\n\nI only start with this semi-crazy-sounding rant because I don’t believe there’s ever been a movie I have done that more for than World War Z. Going in, it had a lot that made me nervous. First, it was an adaptation of what might be my favorite book of all time, and a very, very loose-looking adaptation at that if the running, swarming zombies were any indication. Second, it had a very troubled, very public production, with numerous problems and a complete third-act reshoot that very rarely bodes well for a movie. Third… PG-13! Who the hell makes a PG-13 zombie movie? I mean, The Walking Dead gets away with this, barely, but… come on! Zombies! Blood!\n\nSo what I’m saying is, I was a bit nervous going into it. By all rights I probably should have stayed away, but it has zombies, and it has Brad Pitt, both of which are things I enjoy in a movie, so I wanted to give it a chance. So I sat down with my wife at the wildly overpriced 3D showing of the movie, I unplugged my brain for a while, and I watched World War Z.\n\nAnd you know what? I enjoyed the hell out of myself. I could point out everything wrong with the movie (and boy there is a lot of that), but like a low-quality roller coaster I still found myself exhilarated and thrilled by the experience just enough that I could excuse the fact that the lapbar kept disengaging during some of the loops.\n\nDespite the grand scope of the movie, the plot is very slight. Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former UN Investigator, now a family man (not that they matter much) who is called upon to find out just what caused a worldwide epidemic of the undead in the hopes of finding a cure. The next 90 minutes are basically a series of excuses to show us just how awesome and capable Brad Pitt is, mostly in his ability at saving people’s lives, being an awesome zombie slayer, and just how noble he is in willing to sacrifice himself at a moment’s notice. This is fine and all, for a while, but toward the end it became something of a running joke between my wife and myself, where we would say, “We already know Brad Pitt is awesome, you don’t have to keep shouting this at us!”\n\nStill, Brad Pitt and his greasy haircut aside, this is a very enjoyable movie. The scale of the first two acts is impressive, while the third act’s more restrained, more classic zombie movie tone is a bit jarring, I think it worked overall as it built tremendous tension. Honest to god, this movie’s a lot scarier than I expected and a lot scarier than it had any reason to be. While a good chunk of this came from some very well-executed jump scares, the constant, unending nature of the zombie hordes (which have been reimagined here as fast-moving, swarm insect-like creatures) is truly frightening, like watching a force of nature at work. The viral nature of these zombies is more present than ever, as they aren’t really interested in eating people, but rather just biting people and moving on so they can spread the virus to as many as possible. Though this is a bit jarring at first to the zombie media soaked mind, seeing them take running leaps at people, unmindful of their own safety is a pretty cool, creepy image.\n\nAs well, the setpiece sequences of this movie are well-executed as they should be in any blockbuster. The early sequences of Philadelphia quickly being overrun are creepy and awful in a traditional zombie movie, end of the world sort of way, while the zombie hordes breaking into the walled cities of Israel really allowed the film to show off what kind of zombie movie could be made with a really huge budget. Again, the third act, taking place in a World Health Organization facility in Wales, is a bit slower, a bit more traditional zombie movie than the global scale of the rest, but is tremendously creepy when it wants to be.\n\nSo, it’s an enjoyable movie, which is great. Now for the problems.\n\nMore than anything, World War Z reeks of a movie that doesn’t know what it wants to be. At first it seems to want to just use the title to tell the story of a global zombie epidemic but with a unique story all its own, but then we get some heavy callbacks to the book including a character who actually recites a few paragraphs of dialogue. Then, when it tries to tie itself into the book, it breaks with the story and creates a zombie plague that is nothing like what the book tried to portray, nor a comparable world response.\n\nAs well, I have to put a complaint out there about Brad Pitt’s family in the movie, that complaint being that he shouldn’t have had one in the first place. His wife and children offer nothing to the plot other than something for him to occasionally angst over at best, or something to actively put them in danger (repeatedly) at worst. The fact that they’re sidelined for two-thirds of the movie and we’re still forced to check in with them every so often even though they are doing nothing of consequence is, from a storytelling standpoint, weird.\n\nAlso, I will say that the movie didn’t take the greatest advantage of its attempt at a global scale. While the attacks we see are big, many of the international locations (including a South Korean army base, in a rainstorm, at night, and Wales) are not the most exotic to look at, and kind of squander its global potential. The Israel stuff was pretty cool though, I’ll give them that.\n\nAnd for that ending, we’re going to have to enter… THE SPOILER ZONE!\n\n(SPOILERS AHEAD)\n\n(SPOILERS AHEAD)\n\n(SPOILERS AHEAD)\n\nAll right, about that ending. In this movie, Brad Pitt, because he’s awesome ya know, quickly deduces that the zombies in this movie only infect healthy targets and will actively pass by people with any chronic or potentially life-threatening medical conditions, and with the help of some World Health Organization scientists figures out that by purposefully infecting ourselves with a fatal disease and then curing it, we can make ourselves invisible to zombies. On paper, I gotta say this sounds kinda cool and at the very least sounds like it has some basis in science. The more I think about it, however, the more it seems to unravel.\n\nIf anyone with a life-threatening illness is ignored, we probably would’ve seen a lot more people being passed up by the zombies. Chronic smokers and drinkers would probably be ignored, not to mention anyone with cancer, or heart disease, or any number of other conditions. Large portions of the world infected with HIV and AIDS would be immune. I’m pretty sure any leading minds with a set of eyes and a cell phone would have figured this solution out a lot sooner than Brad Pitt, who doesn’t have a medical degree as far as we know.\n\nIt also adds a rather sad tone to the orphan Brad Pitt rescues, Tomas. One of the first times we see this boy, he’s in an apartment with its door being knocked down by the living dead, and he is trapped inside with his parents. The next time we see him, he’s running to Brad Pitt completely ignored by the zombies, and his parents are chasing the rest of them down, now firmly among the ranks of the living dead. While it’s possible that Tomas may just have been faster than the zombies (which seems unlikely), it might be wise of Brad Pitt to tell the boy that he probably has cancer.\n\n(END SPOILERS)\n\n(END SPOILERS)\n\n(END SPOILERS)\n\nAll griping aside, I gotta say I enjoyed the hell out of World War Z. It’s got its problems and it’s nothing like the book, but as summer popcorn movies go, you could do a lot worse.\n\nAnyone else out there see the movie? Have any thoughts on it?\n\nAs always, please take the time to like me on Facebook or follow me on Twitter!
