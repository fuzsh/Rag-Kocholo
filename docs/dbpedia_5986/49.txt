Femme fatales, hard-boiled detectives, and dark story lines. These gritty films the 1940s were the beginning of the film noir era. With their distinctive low-key lighting, filmed in black and white, (though some were filmed in color) reflected the insecurities and tensions of the World War II era.

â€‹A familiar theme involves the pursuit of a duplicitous dame and her twisted schemes who would invariably lead our doomed hero into committing robbery or murder in the name of passion or unrequited love.

Perhaps unlike any other era, this genre featured critically acclaimed films featuring both A and B-list actors with large and small, shoestring budgets. Many of these actors, though successful in multiple genres, will be best remembered for their Film Noir performances: Elisha Cook Jr., Edmond O'Brien, Dennis O'Keefe, Robert Cummings, Robert Ryan, Rita Hayworth, Ann Savage, Hugh Beaumont, George Raft, Dana Andrews, Ray Milland, Dan Duryea, Chester Morris, Alan Ladd, Veronica Lake, Lawrence Tierney, Faye Emerson, and John Garfield.
