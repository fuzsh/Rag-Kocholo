Budd Boetticher

Budd Boetticher directed many Hollywood films. He is famous for his Westerns, and for three films he made about bullfighters. He worked steadily in film and television (1944 - 1961), then made a handful of films later.

Articles on Boetticher:

Horizons West (1969) by Jim Kitses is a landmark study of the Western, with chapters on the films of Anthony Mann, Budd Boetticher and Sam Peckinpah.

There is a lively biographical survey of Boetticher by Sean Axmaker in Senses of Cinema (2006).

Andr√© Bazin's pioneer article on Seven Men from Now, "An Exemplary Western" (1957), is reprinted in English translation in Cahiers du Cinema: Volume I: The 1950s. Neo-Realism, Hollywood, New Wave (1985), edited by Jim Hillier.

Richard T. Jameson's article on Seven Men from Now is reprinted on-line.

Andrew Sarris' article on Boetticher in his book The American Cinema (1968) is brief, but both insightful and influential.

One Mysterious Night

One Mysterious Night (1944) is Boetticher's first feature (or at least the first one where he gets onscreen credit). It is part of the long running series of Boston Blackie films, about a reformed thief who tries to track down crooks. Like most such Hollywood series, it has quite a bit of comedy, and is low budget and short - just over an hour. The title has little to do with the actual movie: much of the action takes place during the day, and certainly transpires over more than a 12 hour period! Like most Hollywood crime series films, One Mysterious Night is definitely NOT a film noir, a movement then gathering steam in Hollywood. It does not resemble film noir, in either style or content.

Boston Blackie is a master of disguise, like many sleuths. This is part of his characterization throughout the series. Boetticher includes plenty of disguise in One Mysterious Night. Disguise is used by the crook in The Killer Is Loose.

Camera Movement

The most notable feature of One Mysterious Night is the large amount of camera movement. In scene after scene, Boetticher's camera is swooping around.

The camera movements tend to have a left-to-right or right-to-left motion.

The movements often go from one side of the set to another, and then often back again, in the reverse direction - all in the same shot. Some shots, such as one in the inspector's office, or the shot after the shooting on the street, involve more than two movements back and forth across the set. Boetticher can follow characters, as they move back and forth from one side of the set to the other. Or he can simply have the camera explore the scene.

Sometimes, Boetticher uses simple pans to move back and forth across the set: the early shot of the police crossing the street to get into the hotel, the back-and-forth panning in the inspector's office. Other times, Boetticher can combine panning with tracking, as in the first shot in the Chinese restaurant, in which a back-and-forth pan seems to give way to tracking that follows the waiter.

Boetticher can use a slightly elevated angle for his pans and tracks, that reveals the layout of the sets, and makes clear the motion of his characters through it. The elevated angle is steepest in the scene near the end, in which Blackie and the police arrive at the crooks' hideout. He can also pan or track head-on, with a non-tilted camera.

Boetticher can also move his camera forward, often to frame his characters more tightly. This can occur alone, or as part of an otherwise panning-based sequence. More rarely, he can move his camera straight back a little, also to reframe.

Both at the apartment, and at the pawnshop, Boetticher includes camera movements that sweep behind walls of the sets, following the characters from room to room. These are relatively common in movies. Still, such shots can have a non-realistic quality, and are quite conspicuous. These do not seem like "invisible" camera movements. They were a form of "Hollywood magic" that might be noticeable even to naive audiences. These room-to-room tracks also move from left to right, and right to left, like most of the camera movement in One Mysterious Night.

There are also some vertical camera movements. Boetticher moves up from the police playing cards, to the crooks hidden above them, pretending to be tailor's dummies. And Boetticher moves straight up, following his heroes' attempt to escape from the Murphy bed.

Young Punks and Strong Decent Women

The young hotel assistant manager who is involved with the theft seems to be the first of the no-good young man characters who get involved with crime, and who wind up dead, caught in the crosshairs of intrigue involving older, tougher and smarter men: see Buchanan Rides Alone. This is a common Boetticher character type.

The women, who work on terms of equality in a man's world, anticipate the later women in Boetticher's Westerns. The emotionally strong switchboard operator, and her brother, the weak-kneed punk who gets involved in the robbery, anticipate the strong decent woman-lesser crooked male husband and wife of Seven Men from Now.

Male Groups

In later Boetticher films, crooks often have entourages, young men who largely dress alike. Although they are not crooks, or followers of a leader, One Mysterious Night has some striking male groups. One Mysterious Night opens with police walking in a V-wedge on a city street. They seem ominous, a tough looking, all-uniformed group. We only gradually learn they are on the way to guard a jewel exhibit. A later scene with the police in the pawnshop, has all the policemen carrying nightsticks. This adds a striking visual note.

A group of reporters hang out at police headquarters gathering crime news. They are dressed in similar suits, that are well groomed, but which have a working-man feel to them.

The police Inspector Farraday and Blackie have a close relationship. The dialogue refers to it as "a beautiful friendship". This phrase has overtones of special male bonding. It is used in this sense in Ellery Queen's mystery novel The Dragon's Teeth (1939) (Chapter 1), and at the end of the film Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1941). Farraday keeps threatening Blackie with arrest, something which Blackie makes clear he enjoys, in dialogue at the end of the film. It is part of the men's duel of wits, a game they play.

Dialogue emphasizes the close bond between Blackie and his assistant Runt, characters who are familiar from previous Boston Blackie movies. Not only do the two men work together, but they sleep together in the same room. They are together 24 hours a day. Sleeping scenes run through later Boetticher, often showing people sleeping in a group. After this dialogue about sleep early in the film, later we see Blackie and Runt sleeping in bed together.

A Working Class Film

One Mysterious Night is unusual among series crime films in that everyone in it seems so working class. Men stay in suits throughout the film: there are no evening clothes, which were de rigueur in many crime series movies. The cop uniforms are standard, if sharp, and there are no motorcycle cops or fancy police uniforms that run through other entries in the Boston Blackie series. These look like regular working cops, and they talk with each other about how tiring their work shifts are. Both of the female leads are conspicuously working women: a switchboard operator, and a reporter, the only female among the otherwise all-male crime reporters. There are other female switchboard operators who work with the heroine, and a woman who runs a cigar stand in the hotel. There is also a dignified Chinese waiter in a Chinese restaurant, who is seen briefly. Even the relatively affluent patrons of the restaurant, and visitors to the jewel exhibit, are firmly middle class people in suits and ties, not the rich society people who so often show up in Hollywood movie series.

Some earlier episodes of Boston Blackie had bits of left-wing politics. Confessions of Boston Blackie (Edward Dmytryk, 1941) talks about Boston Blackie stealing pearls from the rich, and handing them out to people on bread lines. One wonders if the relentlessly working class nature of One Mysterious Night is designed to make it a "proletarian film".

The jewel exhibit is to raise money for the war effort of the United Nations, a favorite term among left wingers to refer to the Allies as a group (this is not what we today think of as the UN, which had not yet been formed.)

Blackie himself is working for a tool manufacturing company. He is depicted as a "businessman", so the film is not anti-business.

Leather Jacket

Many Hollywood films, especially musicals, have the hero in ordinary clothes at the start, and get him increasingly dressed up through the course of the film, ending with the hero in evening clothes. Boetticher's One Mysterious Night (1944) takes a parallel but different approach. Blackie wears a suit in most of the film, but disguises himself as a uniformed messenger in a leather jacket at the end. The leather jacket is glamorous, like the evening clothes of a conventional film: but it is also distinctly working class looking.

The anonymous costume designer of One Mysterious Night must have liked the look, because a very similar leather jacket is worn by guest star Steve Cochran in Boston Blackie's Rendezvous (Arthur Dreifuss, 1945). Both jackets have a series of button fastenings up the front, and diagonal pockets; neither has any zippers.

Leather jackets were just becoming popular for men in this era, and One Mysterious Night (1944) is one of the earliest films known to me where it is worn as a fashion statement (as opposed to occasional jackets worn by cab drivers, pilots, fisherman, etc.). They are largely worn by tough working class good guys on the edge of the law, like Boston Blackie himself. There are hints in most of these films that there is something exciting and not quite respectable about men wearing such jackets - which probably made them more popular than ever in real life. Blackie is a reformed crook, the heroes of Railroaded! and 99 River Street are innocent but tough working men falsely accused of crimes, the hero of The Street With No Name is a government agent going undercover as a crook in a gang, etc. For a detailed list and history, see the article on Leather Jackets in Film.

In the pawnshop, a ground-level scene shows people's shoes. One can tell when shots of the killers' shoes are replaced by shots of the police: the police's black leather uniform shoes are shinier. It is an aspect of how spiffy the police uniforms as a whole are.

Revolving Poles

One Mysterious Night opens with a strange figure of style. A static street sign suddenly begins to revolve, then sinks down out of sight. I have never seen anything like this in any other film. It is really cool. It is a non-naturalistic effect, something that "stylizes" reality.

The street sign is on a large crossroads-style pole. And it gives way to a street scene that soon will be full of police, in striking formation. There are two other images in the film that also combine poles, revolving objects, and glamorized police.

At the gem show, the crooks steal a kid's pinwheel. This is a revolving object on a tall, pole-like stick. A kind-hearted and handsome policeman tries to help the kids out.

At the pawnshop, the police carry really long, black nightsticks. Once again, these include some good looking cops, in spit and polish police uniforms. The police do not spin these nightsticks at the pawnshop. They do have the nightsticks grasped in their hands.

But soon, in an alley, the crooks see and are scared by a giant shadow of a policeman. This shadow is indeed spinning his nightstick. It makes for an archetypal image of a policeman, gigantic, and with the pole-like nightstick in full rotary motion. This too is a figure of style, on the borders of non-naturalistic imagery.

Open Areas: Large Street Scenes and Rooms

Much of the action of One Mysterious Night takes place in large scale, open places. These include city streets, large exhibit rooms, the hotel assistant's large office, the pawnbroker's, and apartment living rooms. These open spaces, while purely urban, anticipate the large scale open landscape arenas of Boetticher's Westerns. They give plenty of room to stage action, have his characters move around, and allow sweeping camera movements with no obstructions.

Street scenes will recur in The Killer Is Loose and Buchanan Rides Alone, which also involve rapid movements of individuals along the streets.

Strange Shaped Spaces

Boetticher films often contain small, box-like spaces, which contain the characters. There are a few of these in One Mysterious Night, right at the start of Boetticher's career.

The newsstand at the hotel contains the woman who runs it.

The desk at the women's hotel contains the clerk.

The Chinese restaurant has a booth, built into the wall. Blackie and the switchboard operator have dinner there, seated inside the booth.

The woman reporter uses a phone booth.

At the end, the police ascend to the crooks' apartment through the hall staircase. This staircase is not shown through overhead or tilted angles, the way stairs are frequently (and gloriously) depicted in film noir. Boetticher instead uses a radically different approach. He shoots the upstairs hall and the staircase from the front. We see the hall, and we can see down the stairs, in a deep focus shot. Soon the staircase fills up with climbing policemen. The stairway forms a "box", a container for the men in it. This is one of Boetticher's boxes, three-dimensional spaces that contain people. And it is a strange shape: a hallway with a staircase leading down from it: a familiar sight, but actually geometrically quite odd and complex, once you come to think of it.

The fire escape down which the crooks flee is in a box shaped alley, tall and narrow. It connects with the rest of the world through a brick wall, joined at a non-90 degree angle. Boetticher will include more odd shaped alleys in The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond: another giant "box". The alley in The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond will also turn on a polygonal corner, rather than a 90 degree right angle. It too will feature a fire escape.

Blackie and his assistant get tied up by crooks, upside down on a Murphy bed. We see them hanging there, in the closet that contains the Murphy bed. In later Boetticher films, Rock Hudson will get tied up in Horizons West, and there are lots of captives in other Boetticher Westerns. Earlier, Blackie had been handcuffed to a chair at the police station by the inspector; and Blackie and the Inspector get tied up a third time, at the film's climax. Blackie himself uses handcuffs on his friend the police inspector, in the taxi.

Overhead Camera Angle

The Murphy bed scene includes an unusual overhead camera angle, something that will recur in later Boetticher films.

The Missing Juror

The Missing Juror (1944) is a mystery-suspense film.

Its plot about a crazed killer trying to murder twelve jurors, anticipates a bit the quest of the hero to kill seven murderers in Seven Men from Now. Another convict with murder as his goal will appear in The Killer Is Loose.

Plots about killing off jurors occurred in earlier prose mystery fiction: John Rhode's novel The Murders in Praed Street (1928), Stuart Palmer's short story "The Riddle of the Hanging Men" (1934) in his Hildegarde Withers: Uncollected Riddles.

Camera Movement

The Missing Juror contains several scenes in which the camera seemingly "goes through a wall" moving from room to room:

At the heroine's office.

Leaving the police line-up room;

In and out of the massage Rubbing Room at the steam bath.

Leaving the police interrogation room where the crank is confessing.

Boetticher sometimes repeats the wall-movement, for example, at the steam bath. These movements are clearly designed to be exuberant.

Other camera movements have an "in and out" effect, moving to and from the viewer:

The first scene of Macready in the death cell has the camera back away from him, so we can see a procession to the gallows pass over him as shadows; then moves back in towards him - all in one shot. (The shadows in the procession are identifiable by the silhouettes of their headgear. First we see a priest. At the end, two cops wear enormously high-peaked caps. Even as shadows, they seem dressy.)

The comic last scene of the film, at the restaurant, is one long take, in which Boetticher moves the camera in and out, as well as other movements, to focus on different parts of the action.

Some camera movements in the courtroom are also notable:

A complex pan first shows the defendant and lawyers entering the courtroom from a left hand door, then keeps moving to the right as the jury files in from a second door. The camera movement underscores and counterpoints the movements of the characters.

A shot behind the jurors as the verdict comes in has a nice propulsive quality.

Boetticher has one of his stop and start camera movements, going from a witness to one juror, then moving on to stop again at a second juror.

A shot moves into the lawyer and defendant talking, stops, then after their conversation keeps moving inward to the witness seen between them.

A camera movement from a moving train is outstanding. We see through a door of a train, slowly pulling out of the station; the shot keeps the heroine walking on the platform outside of the train in view.

The shooting of the lying private eye is also in one long take, which has him going up to a corner, then moving back down the street again.

Technology

The hero uses a Dictaphone to record his news stories. The witnesses in the courtroom speak into a microphone they hold. Both are examples of Boetticher's interest in sound technology. The Dictaphone horn also seems like a phallic symbol.

The newspapermen get stories off a teletype.

The villain sets fire to his asylum room. This seems like a direct ancestor of a similar scene of "fire in an asylum room" in Behind Locked Doors (1948).

Boxes Containing Men

The Missing Juror has a number of Boetticher's box-like containers:

The front area of the courtroom, where the lawyers, jury and witness work, is fenced off from the spectators' seats. Boetticher repeatedly has long shots showing this area as a "box" that contains the characters.

There are two jail cells: one for the villain on Death Row, and later a comic one containing the hero in a rustic jail.

The hero uses a phone booth.

The hero enters the closet of his hospital room to get dressed.

The steam room perhaps might be viewed as a large box. The hero is trapped inside.

None of these are irregular-shaped spaces, the way they often will be in later Boetticher.

Thirst

Boetticher characters are always drinking liquids: they have an especial fondness for coffee. The Missing Juror shows female secretary Tex making and serving coffee to a group. It also has a scene at restaurant-bar Wally's Grotto, in which the hero has coffee, and a villainous private eye has liquor. One suspects there is a bit of an anti-alcohol statement in this.

The hero is attacked in a steam room, nearly killed, and winds up in the hospital. We see him drinking water, and his dialogue points out how much water he's been drinking. Although there is no further explanation, one suspects this refers to him being dehydrated by the steam room, and needing water. This is an extreme, and interesting, example of thirst in Boetticher.

Not Quite a Trickster

The early scenes have the hero negotiating with his former editor, getting stuff. The hero is depicted as a sly fox, who knows how to extract goodies. He has the "feel" of one of Boetticher's trickster characters. However, the reporter is not actually tricking the editor. He has simply brought the editor a good news story, and is using it to negotiate benefits. There is nothing actually tricky or dishonest about that.

Cast

Leading man Jim Bannon has a voice and demeanor that remind one of cowboy actor William "Wild Bill" Elliott. Both are highly macho men, who speak slowly and emphatically, and with the same sort of timbre to their voice.

One brief scene features giant William Hall as a cop guarding the villain. Hall, who once had a role as a leading man in The Spy Ring (Joseph H. Lewis, 1938), was now reduced to this sort of cameo. He looks great in his police uniform.

Costumes

The reporter hero is in single-breasted, solid color suits throughout the film. He looks good in them, but his neat appearance is still less dressy than the double-breasted pinstripes we associate with 1940's noir. Like the hero of One Mysterious Night, the protagonist is dressed in a way that does not make him look upper class or well-to-do.

Escape in the Fog

Escape in the Fog (1945) is a spy thriller.

Race and Politics

The heroes of Escape in the Fog are trying to destroy the Japanese Occupation of China. Many Boetticher films feature heroes who are fighting against dictatorial control of towns, whether modern day or in the old West. Escape in the Fog extends this to a whole country.

The dignified, non-stereotyped Chinese agent is notable. Also unusual: although the heroes are working against the Japanese Occupation, no Japanese villains or characters are seen at all. Instead, the villains are all white: mainly Nazi agents, with a few American traitors. The filmmakers are making an unusually successful attempt to avoid racist stereotypes, and project positive images.

The heroine is also one of the good women in Boetticher who work on equal terms in a world of men. She was working on a hospital ship before it was blasted. Her trenchcoat looks a bit like men's clothing: something not uncommon in Boetticher heroines.

The heroine as played by the talented Nina Foch conveys intelligence. She is courageous, and morally committed. She also shows admirable determination. Perhaps most important, she eventually does some real detection, in her noticing that a ship passed under the bridge.

The sympathetic woman taxi driver is another working woman. She is played by a very young Shelley Winters, who projects personality in her brief role.

Psychological Warfare

The hero is a specialist in psychological warfare. He works on radio broadcasts fighting against Axis occupations in World War II. This perhaps links him to War of the Silver Kings, and its hero's public relations campaign against the town boss.

It also anticipates some deceptive ways in which the police use the media in The Killer Is Loose.

Unfortunately, the hero's actual mission in Escape in the Fog has nothing to do with these interesting skills.

The Spy Master

The good guy spy master is played by Otto Kruger, a patrician actor most often cast as smooth, wealthy villains. He was the rich, upper class American who was eager to support the Nazis in Alfred Hitchcock's Saboteur (1943). Here once again he is playing a wealthy man who is plainly a representative of America's Old Money WASP elite. While Saboteur suggested that such men were right wing monsters and fascist sympathizers, Escape in the Fog implausibly implies such men are patriots, ready to do battle with America's enemies, and socially accept Chinese good guys into their palatial homes. No mention is made of all the well-to-do US businessmen whose financial dealings with Nazi Germany in the 1930's speeded Hitler's rise to power.

Kruger's wealth plays a role in the plot: only such a patrician would have a grandfather clock in his living room, and a butler who maintains it. Perhaps the character's wealth is mainly included, so that such a clock is plausible.

There is a long tradition in spy books and films: the hero is a virile young man who gets his orders from an upper class, older man who represents the patriarchal elite who runs society. The hero is therefore supposed to represent both Society and "good over evil" - or perhaps white male power. For example, see James Bond getting his orders from spy master M. Or the young spy hero who gets orders from the head of the Secret Service in Spione (Fritz Lang, 1928). I have always found this tradition morally, politically and socially dubious. It equates Society with wealth and patriarchy: a bad idea.

The scene with the hero getting his mission from Otto Kruger, seems like a direct expression of this tradition. However, Escape in the Fog does complicate this tradition, by showing a good guy Chinese agent in the conference with Kruger. This does affect the core tradition, which more ordinarily celebrates upper class white patriarchal power in its most naked form.

The scenes throughout Escape in the Fog, with the heroine trying to get male authority figures to take her ideas seriously, also complicates the traditional spy film idea of social goodness being represented by a patriarchal member of wealthy white male elites.

Escape in the Fog contains an allegory: traditional American social power, centered in wealthy WASP male elites like Kruger, needs to broaden itself to include other races and women. This liberal, integrationist point of view will run through Boetticher's work.

Escape in the Fog uses a traditional scene in spy films, the hero getting his orders from a wealthy elite male - but insistently complicates this tradition to convey new ideas about racial and sexual integration.

Sexuality and Social Power

I mentioned earlier that in traditional spy films, the hero is a virile young man. For example, such virility is an important part of the characterization of James Bond and the young spy hero of Spione. Traditionally, the hero's male sexual potency is implicitly blessed by his patriarchal boss, in the scene where the hero gets his orders from the spy chief. The idea is that his sexuality is endorsed by the patriarchy that runs society. It becomes part of the patriarchy's power.

Aspects of this idea survive in Escape in the Fog. The hero is indeed sexually virile. And he first meets the heroine, by breaking down the door of her bedroom while she is sleeping: surely, a scene that relates male sexuality to male power.

However, in James Bond films, women are sex objects whom the hero uses for sexual pleasure. They are not seen as having human dignity or value.

By contrast, the heroine of Escape in the Fog repeatedly asserts herself as an agent, not an object. She has brains, and uses them to perform detective work: a key definition of intelligence and human dignity and agency in detective films.

Once agin, Escape in the Fog is re-using a traditional trope of spy films, only to subvert it and broaden it, to suggest that women have brains and a role in running society.

Escape in the Fog is integrationist: it doesn't attack male virility, or try to strip the male hero from his good guy status. But it insists that male power must be shared, with women getting a role in running society. Similarly, it insists that other races, such as the Chinese, be given a role in the running of society.

Headquarters and Social Power

In traditional spy films, the elite spy chief's headquarters is seen as the ultimate safe, protected place, and a symbol of Government and social power and organization. It is deep in the center of some very secure government location. The spy chief gives his orders there to the young spy hero, remote from harm. Then the young hero goes out into the world, where he faces danger from enemy agents.

For example. the Wikipedia article on M (James Bond) states: "Academic Paul Stock argues that M's office is a metonym for England and a stable point from which Bond departs on a mission, whilst he sees M as being an iconic representative of England and Englishness." It cites: Stock, Paul (2009). "Dial 'M' for metonym: Universal Exports, M's office space and empire". In Lindner, Christoph. The James Bond Phenomenon: a Critical Reader. Manchester: Manchester University Press.

At first, Escape in the Fog seems to embody the same idea. But this turns into another traditional spy concept that gets subverted in Escape in the Fog. The Port Authority chief's office looks like at first precisely like one of these ultra-safe locations where Government and Societal authority issues its orders.

SPOILERS. But later on in the film, the Nazi villain sneaks into the office at night, and uses the chief's desk and phone to impersonate the Port Authority chief.

Perhaps I am pushing the idea too far, but Escape in the Fog might be suggesting that what looks like a center of power, a chief's office, might actually be a point of weakness and vulnerability. There is perhaps an allegory here suggesting that concentrated power in a point of weakness, not strength. By contrast, spreading power among many different people (inevitably which would include women and many races), will be a source of social strength.

MacGuffin

The packet is an archetypal MacGuffin: something key to the plot, but whose contents don't really matter. It perhaps relates to the big sums of money that drive other Boetticher plots, such as the strongbox filled with gold in Seven Men from Now.

The plot suffers from being a series of episodes, in which both sides keep battling for possession of the all-important packet. This construction keeps the story from building any momentum or flow, or involving the viewer with any substance attached to the events. Still, many of the events are interesting, even if they are thinly connected. The events are also richly plotted, full of detail. A lot happens, for an hour of film.

In other Boetticher, the big sums of money are just subplots, that are integrated into more complex stories. The strongbox in Seven Men from Now is an example. It plays a key role, but it is also part of a mix that involves the hero's murdered wife, and intricate personal relationships.

Technology

Escape in the Fog is a highly technological film. The hero is a specialist in radio, then among the most advanced technology of the day. We see a police radio room. The Navy is experimenting with a radio-controlled ship.

The bad guys employ bugging. They also know how to spy on telephone numbers others dial.

The lens projection is a cool device.

The numerous clocks are interesting imagery.

Information Centers

The good guys have a series of headquarters. These headquarters are filled with information, and also ways to communicate information:

Kruger's living room is full of books: a key source and symbol of information. It also has a grandfather clock.

The Port Authority office has a globe. And a telephone used by the Intelligence chief, that will play a key role in the plot.

The police work in a room that contains a radio center: the ultimate high tech information-communication technology of the era. The room also include a desk with telephone used by the policeman in charge to communicate information. A map hangs on the wall over the radian station: maps, like globes, embody information.

The bad guys hang out in a room that seems like a parody of such information centers: a shop filled with hundreds of clocks. This seems like a surrealist variant on the information centers used by the good guys. This bad guys' room is less functional than the heroes' information centers - but it is impressive anyway.

Boxes Containing Men

Escape in the Fog has a number of Boetticher's box-like containers:

There are not one, but three telephone booths: one at the resort, a pair outside a naval office.

The area for the clerk in the clock store. This is closed in by racks filled with watches, a visually spectacular effect.

The restaurant contains both a region for the bartender, and a booth for the hero and heroine.

The good guy spy leader's porch is a frequent setting. It is photographed sometimes so that characters seem contained in it.

The alley at the end.

The underground passage leading off from the alley, through a manhole.

The spy master's living room has bookcases on angles in the corners. This gives it the shape of a large polygonal box.

Phallic Objects

There are fewer poles in Escape in the Fog than in other Boetticher. The flashlight carried by the cop on the bridge, and the candles used as sealing wax by the good guy spies, might be examples. Although they are a bit smaller than most Boetticher poles.

The putters carried by two golfers at the resort might also be examples, although they play no role in the plot. The golfers are a male-female couple, rather than a group of men, which would be more typical of Boetticher.

The inn has a lamp post out front.

Camera Movement

Some of the most complex camera movements occur in the good guy spy master's living room:

We follow the butler into the room, then back, with lateral moves. Then the camera moves forward to the clock.

When the heroine leaves, a long take follows the characters in the room, then watches them go out into the hall, through the door. The camera then follows the spy master even further to the left, to the telephone.

Vertical camera movements show the bad guy adjusting the bugging in the clock. One such movement goes both down and up.

The camera also oscillates with the hero in his room, as he walks back and forth to the telephone.

Some camera movements go from left-to-right:

Across the inn lawn, winding up at the couple's table. This movement partly follows some men walking.

Across the clock store interior, the first time the clock store is shown.

From the desk where the villain puts together the torn paper, across the back room to where the heroine is tied up.

Down the hallway where the villain enters by flashlight at night.

When the cops perform the final rescue, first a camera movement follows them down the street. Then a second brief movement is inside the shop, following the cops crossing it.

Some camera movements with the villains go from right-to-left:

In front of the police station outside, after the good guys finish their business, the camera pans to the left, revealing a hiding bad guy.

The camera follows the villains across the roof, in a brief movement.

A shot moves left-to-right from a phone booth across a hall, finds the couple entering on the right, then moves right-to-left, following them walking to the phone booth.

Vertical camera movements go from the hero down to the message on his table, then back up to the hero again: all in one shot.

Paranormal

Escape in the Fog has some problems. The dream prophecy promotes paranormal ideas. Science has thoroughly discredited paranormal concepts.

Uniforms

Columbia Pictures B-movies of the era liked to show men in dressy, fancy uniforms. Escape in the Fog keeps to this tradition. First we see a doorman in a spiffy uniform. Then sailors and Naval officers. Finally, there are large groups of policemen, including a motorcycle cop. While the doorman is a solitary figure, the sailors, Naval officers and police form men in groups.

The motorcycle cop's tall boots are among the few leather clothes in the movie. He wears leather gloves too. The policeman on the bridge wears one of the black rain slickers that run through Boetticher.

Assigned to Danger

Assigned to Danger (1948) is a crime thriller.

The Facade

The opening (right under the initial credits) shows a rectilinear facade of buildings on a city street. The facade makes a fascinating series of rectangular patterns, like other such Boetticher facades.

Soon, the camera will shift to another location, to the right. But after some action, we will return to the original street and facade. Now it is framed differently, so that just a subsection of it appears. And it is crowded into a somewhat different region of the screen. This produces another interesting, Mondrian-like composition of rectangles. It is related to the opening shot - but different.

Capture and Shooting: Staging

When the police corner the criminals, we see them in a large empty street. The camera is at a a slightly elevated angle.

The Young Doctor

The young doctor is an enterprising man, who is trying to make himself known to everyone in the small town. The film pokes fun at his eager self-promotion.

In a benevolent way, the doctor anticipates Robert Ryan's villain in Horizons West, who is trying to take over much of Texas. Both are ambitious young go-getters, who are trying to take over a territory.

Both men have geographical information about their territory:

Ryan has a big map of Texas on his wall.

The young doctor has file cards with the addresses of nearly everybody in town.

However, the doctor is a strictly benign person, not a crook like Ryan. He is simply trying to take over from an older doctor who is retiring, and with the retiring doc's permission. He is a comic-but-honest man on the make, not a criminal.

The noble doctor in Decision at Sundown leads a revolt of the good townspeople against the evil town dictator. Like the young doctor in Assigned to Danger, he too is trying to "take over" a town, in a benevolent way.

Uniforms

Some of the police are in black leather uniform jackets, during the scene where Nip is shot.

The young doctor (future writer Dean Riesner) wears a white medical uniform.

Power Centers

Assigned to Danger has a number of offices, where good-guy men exercise social power:

The boss at the insurance company.

The young doctor.

The District Attorney at the finale.

The hero gets his orders from the older, patriarchal authority figure in the insurance office, at the film's start. Such orders from authority figures are common in spy dramas and many thrillers.

Long Takes

When the surviving crooks go to the woman's apartment, the scene inside is shot in one long take. The camera eventually moves to the left, then back to the right, then to the center again, then to the right. It is a complex piece of staging.

Other long takes:

The doctor's office.

The first scene of the hero in his room at the inn.

The breakfast scene. This has the camera moving from the inn lobby to the dining room.

The scene where the couple discover Frankie is dead, is shot in two long takes. There is a quiet break to a second shot, right after the discovery.

Behind Locked Doors

Behind Locked Doors (1948) is a mystery thriller set in an insane asylum.

Behind Locked Doors recalls Escape in the Fog:

Both are moody suspense films, with characters wandering around in dangerous situations at night.

Both have men in danger, rescued and protected by the heroine: a reversal of film cliches.

Both have their leads locked up and imprisoned in their finales.

The opening of Behind Locked Doors walking along the asylum wall, recalls the opening of walking on the bridge of Escape in the Fog. Both take place at night, both feature women.

The asylum wall also anticipates the wall of the farm family the escaped convict will kill in The Killer Is Loose. Both are lonely walls with a closed door in them. Both are the setting of eerie suspense scenes.

Dictatorship and Revolt

The asylum has features of some of the dictatorial regimes regularly criticized in Boetticher:

It is under dictatorial control by authority figures, who mistreat the inmates.

It is run by a crooked judge, anticipating the crooked government officials in Buchanan Rides Alone.

The inmates are exploited as forced, unpaid labor, anticipating the underpaid exploited miners in War of the Silver Kings.

People are unable to leave, also recalling the hostage Mexican in Buchanan Rides Alone.

As in other Boetticher, the protagonists work to undercut the regime. Behind Locked Doors is unusual in that both a man and a woman are lead figures, attacking the regime.

When the heroine goes to a social authority figure for help, the state medical examiner, he refuses to help. Instead, support actually comes when a decent worker at the asylum revolts. One suspects there is a political allegory in this, with worker resistance being a key to social change - and recognizing that the upper classes will stick together and resist change.

The hero's roommate and fellow inmate is the main source of information about conditions in the asylum. He can stand for political dissenters in society. He anticipates the honest doctor who criticizes the town boss in Decision at Sundown.

Tricksters

The hero and heroine both have trickster features, running deceitful scams to gain entrance into the asylum. The hero also manipulates the firebug to search the asylum, in another "trick".

The heroine is another Boetticher character who uses disguise.

Women and Gender Roles

The heroine is one of the strong working women in Boetticher, who take part in a man's world in a position of equality.

The crooked judge's girlfriend is likely a woman he financially supports as a mistress, although this is not discussed explicitly. She is wearing the fur coat that was a film indicator of a "kept woman" in that era, whether a mistress or a rich man's trophy wife. Boetticher tends to disapprove of women who are "personal property of wealthy men".

Men in Groups

The hero and his two roommates at the asylum are examples of Boetticher men who sleep in groups.

Both the asylum inmates and guards have common uniforms, also a Boetticher tradition. So do the police who appear at the end.

Box-Like Spaces for Men

The rooms at the asylum are examples of Boetticher's box-like spaces containing men. This is especially true of the cells in the Violent Ward upstairs. All of the rooms seem simple geometrically, unlike some of the regions in other Boetticher.

Staircase

The staircase is the entrance to the Violent Ward, which contains the key information about the crime plot. So the staircase is closely linked to the plot: any time someone gets close to the Violent Ward, they have to pass through the staircase. This is true of both crooks and good guys. So there are several dramatic scenes on the staircase.

Staircases are also a central film noir image. The prominence of the staircase in Behind Locked Doors helps establish the movie as firmly linked to film noir traditions. At the finale, the shadows from the staircase grillwork are prominent on the walls: also a film noir tradition.

Long Takes

The hall scene outside the hero's office near the start, is shot in one take. It's medium-length.

Much of the early scene between the hero and heroine in her hotel room, is shot in a long take. A high point is when the hero turns around, then lights his lighter for her in a sexy gesture. Having the hero turn around also highlights his broad shoulders and back, duded up in his sharp pinstripe suit.

When the heroine goes back to the state psychiatrist for help, the scene is in one take.

Poles

The door-letterer who paints the hero's name on his office door, carries what seems to be a yardstick, perhaps used in his work. Signs, especially in bars, are conspicuous in some other Boetticher movies. Here we have a man who makes them.

Leather Furniture

Some Boetticher films show swaggering men sitting in leather chairs. The leather furniture in Behind Locked Doors is not as linked to such swaggering characters. The state psychiatrist's office is full of it - but he is a subdued, professional acting man. It does give the swaggering private eye hero a chance to sit on his leather couch, and make cheeky gestures of peering out under his hat.

The sinister doctor who runs the asylum also has a leather chair.

Richard Carlson

Richard Carlson is best known for his 1950's work, where he played mature, thoughtful, intelligent men, often in responsible positions, such as scientists. In Behind Locked Doors, we first see him in a decidedly different kind of role, as a smart-aleck private eye. He seems to be enjoying himself, or at least acting that way, all dressed up in one of the sharp 1940's pinstriped suits of a film noir hero. He flirts with the heroine, makes wisecracks, and in general behaves like one of Boetticher's comic tricksters. These scenes seem designed as a wish-fulfillment fantasy for the audience, suggesting how much fun it would be to be a private eye.

However, once the hero takes on his undercover role at the asylum, this aspect falls away. The hero gets in sober clothes, and what seems to be Carlson's real screen persona emerges: sober, intelligent and responsible.

Dickie Moore

A young resident at the asylum who doesn't speak is played by former child star Dickie Moore, who played a mute character just a year before in Out of the Past (Jacques Tourneur, 1947). While the resident conspicuously doesn't speak in Behind Locked Doors, the film does not make clear whether he is mute, or too emotionally traumatized to speak.

Killer Shark

Killer Shark (1950) is about shark fishermen. It is grim, repulsive, uninventive, and just plain awful: likely Boetticher's worst film.

Links to The Bullfighter and the Lady

Killer Shark anticipates The Bullfighter and the Lady:

It features men battling fierce killer animals.

The protagonists are young men trying to learn the fighting skills from experienced older males.

The protagonists are refined, even patrician, young Americans, decent, respectful and polite.

The young men are from America, and the action takes place in Mexico.

Really bad things happen to the characters in both films.

Boetticher Subjects: The Opening

Before the action of Killer Shark descends into total grimness, the opening contains some relatively light-hearted events that recall Boetticher traditions:

The men all sleep together in a common bunk room on ship: communal sleeping being a Boetticher image.

The heroine walks into the cabin while the hero is changing his clothes, thus causing the naive young man to panic. This anticipates the comic scenes in Stopover where the naive young man is forced to share a bedroom with a sexy older woman, much to his embarrassment.

A trickster character lures the young hero into climbing up to the ship's crow's nest. We get a steep overhead view shot.

The father wears a shiny black slicker on ship.

The cantina is another Boetticher saloon.

Towards the middle of the film, an evil barman in a sinister cantina serves as another trickster, supplying the hero with a rotten crew. He is much more evil than the more light-hearted trickster who lures the hero up to the crow's nest.

Throughout the film, financial negotiations play a role, both in hiring and paying fishermen, and timing the sale of sharks to market prices. Aside from the hero and his father, the fishermen are all working class men.

Cooking and Gender Roles

Killer Shark has no less than two men who cook. Both are professional cooks: one is the ship's cook, the other runs a small cantina. They even have a discussion, in which the ship's cook denounces the cantina owner's food as lousy.

The ship's cook is called Maestro. As he explains, it is a term of respect.

Box-Like Spaces Containing Men

The dock has a stairwell. It is a box-like space enclosing the outdoor stairs.

The bunks on ship are also box-like spaces containing men. So is the entire cramped cabin room containing the bunks. This room has a ladder along one wall, ladders and steep stairs being fairly common in Boetticher's box-like spaces.

The Bullfighter and the Lady

The Bullfighter and the Lady (1951) is the first of three films Boetticher made about bullfighting.

Curved Shapes

In The Bullfighter and the Lady there is a restaurant with many curved arches. These low, wide arches are constantly kept in the background of the shots, adding to the composition. Other shots show the circular corrida itself. The arches seem parabolic; the angled shots of the corrida form an ellipse on the screen. This fondness for conic sections is a structural motif of the film.

Finale

There is a camera movement near the end, when the hero moves forward endlessly down the tunnel, on the way to the arena. He passes many other bullfighters. They are a Boetticher group of men dressed alike.

Soon, the matadors enter the arena, in a geometric procession.

There is a striking overhead pan, showing the car leaving the arena. This is one of several Boetticher shots from a steep overhead angle - at its start, at least.

The Cimarron Kid

The Cimarron Kid (1952) is Boetticher's first Western.

The Stables

The scene in the stables is one of Boetticher's tense, suspenseful confrontation scenes.

The stable stalls where the gang hides out, are some of Boetticher's box-like structures containing men.

Boonesville

The hero and heroine walk down the sidewalk of a street in the town of Boonesville. This is one of Boetticher's gently sloping streets. Periodically, they step down to lower and lower levels of the sidewalk.

Eventually they reach a store that sells ladies' goods. This has a tilted shop window, that reflects the street.

Two men pursue them. These a are small group of men who dress alike. a Boetticher tradition. These men wear dark, three-piece suits with vests, similar string ties with white dress shirts, and different but "serious looking" hats.

Eventually the hero and heroine leave the store, and follow the reverse path back up the sidewalk by which they arrived.

The Plummer Hotel and Round House

The round house sequence is a brilliant scene. It is notable for its visual style.

It starts in the street in the front of the Plummer Hotel (first half of the sequence). Then it moves to the railroad Round House (second half of the sequence).

The setting embodies many of the architectural motifs and approaches that run through Boetticher's films:

The porch of the Plummer Hotel is one of the box-like structures containing men.

The trap is set on an open space in the street.

Deep perspective views down the street show the wagons used to block off the street.

The front of the round house is a rectilinear building facade, making a complex geometric pattern.

The door makes complex rectilinear geometry out of a bolt.

The back side of the round house is also a rectilinear building facade. Like many in Boetticher, it is full of recessed spaces leading into the building, here spaces for the trains. (It lacks the porticos often found in such facades though.) Next to the building are two other buildings with peaked, slanting roofs. Such diagonal, slanting lines are NOT part of Boetticher's usually purely rectilinear facades.

A huge circular space is behind the round house.

It has a moveable set of railroad tracks, that form a sort of bridge over which the heroes hope to escape.

The train engines can be considered as very large poles. Poles in Boetticher are sometimes either revolving objects, or linked to revolving objects: here the turntable.

When the Sheriff and his men emerge and march down the street towards the trapped heroes, they form one of the organized processions in Boetticher.

Red-Green Color in the Plummer Sequence

The events just before the round house take place in the porch of the Plummer Hotel, and the street in front of it. They are largely designed in a red-and-green color scheme. Red and green are Complementary Colors, and are widely used together in design, including film.

Much of the Hotel porch is painted green. There are also green trees and vegetation.

The road is red: perhaps it has been painted. The hay wagon in the distance looks reddish; so do some of the wagons in the distance, pulled across the road. One of the wagons has red wheels.

Rose is in a pink blouse. Her outfit will soon color-harmonize with the striking shade of off-red with which the round house is painted. It is an eye-pooping display of color.

A man on the porch wears a blue shirt. This is an exception to the dominant red-and-green color scheme.

Red-Blue Color in the Round House Sequence

The Round House sequence is mainly in a dazzling bright off-red, with which the buildings are painted.

But it also draws on blue clothes worn by some of the law men. Audie Murphy's gray shirt can also seem a bit blue-ish in this context.

The "bridge" with the tracks, has red streaks, perhaps painted into the wood.

The green trees, so prominent in the Plummer Hotel road just before, largely are absent in the Road House episode.

Horses and Color

Heroes Audie Murphy and James Best ride horses that have very similar markings and colors. Such matched costumes or horses are a Boetticher motif.

James Best is in shades of brown, that color-harmonize with his horse. Brown is not a dressy color, and the brown outfit suggests (accurately) that Best is not the film's hero.

Audie Murphy, the film's lead, is in a dressier gray shirt and black hat.

Horizons West

Color

The great beauty of Horizons West (1952) as a color film can not be overemphasized. Both the clothes and the sets are richly colorful. The subtle colors make harmonies with each other. As in the musical, the Western offers a chance to escape into a different world, one in which every color is rich and vibrant. Whether it's Julie Adams' fiery red dress and headdress, or Rock Hudson's purple leather vest, the colors are at the center of visual interest at all times. They are the most important things on the screen at any moment. It is not individual colors alone, but their combination into color harmonies and compositions that is striking.

The General's comic opera uniform is in red and blue. "Red and blue" make a vibrating color scheme, one that is busy-looking and flamboyant to the eye. Rad-and-blue is not seen that often in films, or real life clothes, because it tends to overwhelm the eye and everything in sight. However, it is comically appropriate for the character. It gives him genuine flair, making a real splash.

Civil Rights

Robert Ryan's gray underscores his pride in being a former Confederate officer, a pride the film constantly suggests is misplaced. Boetticher's films offer a consistently liberal commentary on Civil Rights, the most important political and social issue of their day. We see the US Army's prideful, disastrous attack on wronged Native Americans in Seminole, and the discrimination against the youn
