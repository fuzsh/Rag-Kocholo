        "text": "When HBO Max debuted in May 2020, subscribers rightfully expected (and got) the formidable catalog of prestige television associated with the HBO brand. But its movie library drew from a much deeper well. Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns HBO, is a huge conglomerate, and its premiere streaming service comprises decades of titles from Warner Bros., Turner Classic Movies, Studio Ghibli and more. Viewed in that light, its recent rebranding as Max seems fitting.\n\nThat means a lot of large-scale fantasy series and selections from the DC extended universe. Max is also an education in Golden Age Hollywood classics and in independent and foreign auteurs like Federico Fellini, Satyajit Ray and John Cassavetes. The list below is an effort to recommend a diverse range of movies — old and new, foreign and domestic, all-ages and adults-only — that cross genres and cultures while appealing to casual and serious movie-watchers alike. (Note: Streaming services sometimes remove titles or change starting dates without notice.)\n\nHere are our lists of the best movies and TV shows on Netflix, the best movies on Amazon Prime Video and the best of everything on Hulu and Disney+.\n\n‘Love Lies Bleeding’ (2024)\n\nAfter reinventing the demon possession movie in her striking debut film “Saint Maud,” the director Rose Glass revs up the neo-noir with potent black comedy and Sapphic eroticism in “Loves Lies Bleeding,” a fiendishly entertaining love story gone sideways. Set in a Southwest backwater in the late ’80s, the film details the relationship between a bored lesbian gym manager (Kristen Stewart) and a would-be female bodybuilding champion (Katy O’Brian) on her way to a big-city competition. Ed Harris does sinister work as the manager’s father, a local crime boss who operates a gun range on the edge of town. Manohla Dargis called Stewart “one of the more interesting attractions in American film.”\n\nStream it on Max\n\n‘Brokeback Mountain’ (2005)\n\nThe ghost of Matthew Shepard, a gay American student who was tortured and killed near Laramie, Wyo., in 1998, lingers over Ang Lee’s heartbreaking adaptation of Annie Proulx’s short story about cowboys (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal) whose illicit relationship comes to a tragic end. Yet “Brokeback Mountain” belongs firmly in the tradition of romances like “All That Heaven Allows” and “In the Mood for Love,” where societal forces exert pressure on a forbidden love that cannot flourish out in the open. The leads are superb, but Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway are equally good as the wives of men whose feelings they cannot command. Stephen Holden called it “a moving and majestic film.”\n\nStream it on Max\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
