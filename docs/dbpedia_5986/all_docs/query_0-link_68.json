        "text": "I am afraid that there are more people than I can imagine who can go no further than appreciating a picture that is a rectangle with an object in the middle of it, which they can identify. They don't care what is around the object as long as nothing interferes with the object itself, right in the center. Even after the lessons of Winogrand and Friedlander, they don't get it. They respect their work because they are told by respectable institutions that they are important artists, but what they really want to see is a picture with a figure or an object in the middle of it. They want something obvious. The blindness is apparent when someone lets slip the word 'snapshot'. Ignorance can always be covered by 'snapshot'. The word has never had any meaning. I am at war with the obvious. (11)\n\n1. Kodachrome is a discontinued and now itself somewhat legendary film (what other film stock has a hit song about it?) that was manufactured by Kodak from 1935 to 2009, and for some time it was the only color film available in the US in 35mm format. As opposed to color negative film, which is developed into a negative image and can be readily used to create prints, Kodachrome was a transparency or slide film, meaning that when the film was developed, it formed positive color slides. These were typically projected, but could also be made into prints through a handful of now obsolete processes such as Cibachrome or dye transfer. Kodachrome used a complex and lengthy development process called K-14, and by the end of its run was developed by only one lab in the US. Kodachrome was known for its saturated colors, minimal grain, excellent sharpness and detail, and its longevity and resistance to fading. Slide film in general is known for less grain, higher saturation and a narrower dynamic range (its ability to capture a span of light intensity) than color negative film. It was the dominant type of color film used in many professional applications including landscape and fashion photography. Other slide films besides Kodachrome are still made, but slide film is much less popular and usually more expensive to process than color negative film today.\n\n2.
