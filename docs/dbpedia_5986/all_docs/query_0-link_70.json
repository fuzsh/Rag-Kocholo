        "text": "Issa López loves a good murder—though not just any whodunit will do. “I’m not so much of a fan of the cozy mystery,” she explains. “I like the dark, fucked-up mystery.”\n\nThat’s what makes the Mexican filmmaker such a good match for True Detective, which is finally returning to HBO for its fourth season this January, after a nearly five-year hiatus. López loved the show’s critically adored first season—the complementary energy of Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey, the slightly supernatural flavor of the central crimes, the deep mythology (remember Carcosa and the Yellow King?). Like the rest of us, she was less all-in on seasons two and three. “And I never thought a fourth season was going to happen,” says López.\n\nThen the show was revived, and López was asked to steer it—replacing original True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto, who retains an executive producer credit on the new series. Her winning idea, as she told journalists at an HBO event on November 2, was to create a “dark mirror” of season one. “Where True Detective is male and it’s sweaty, Night Country”—season four’s subtitle—“is cold and it’s dark and it’s female.”\n\nLópez trades humid Louisiana swamps for the frigid black skies of a fictional Alaska town called Ennis, where the sun sets on December 17 and won’t rise again until after the New Year. On the third day of night, police chief Liz Danvers (Jodie Foster) is called to the scene of a strange maybe-crime: the Tsalal Arctic Research Station, home to eight scientists who spend their days investigating arctic biology, geology, and the impacts of climate change. But when Danvers arrives, all eight are missing. They’ve left behind their access passes, their cell phones, an uneaten sandwich; it’s as if the entire group has simply vanished into thin air.\n\nTrue Detective’s new showrunner was inspired by a pair of mysteries that have haunted her since childhood. In the curious case of the Mary Celeste, an American vessel’s entire crew apparently up and evaporated while en route to Italy in 1872. There was also the similarly baffling Dyatlov Pass incident, in which nine Russian hikers abandoned their campsite for unknown reasons, then froze to death in the nearby wilderness.\n\nThe latter enigma has since been blamed on a possible avalanche. But López isn’t buying it. “An avalanche doesn’t explain a lot of the details I think,” she tells me the morning after the HBO event. “Even if it did, I prefer the strange, incomplete answer. I think there is a fascination with puzzles that are still missing a couple of pieces, and that obsess us, and make us angry, and make us not stop thinking about them.”\n\nSuch a statement may trigger alarm bells for TV audiences still smarting over the threads left dangling by shows like the famously divisive final episode of Lost. But though López admires this sort of storytelling, True Detective: Night Country isn’t that kind of show.\n\n“Not all of the details, not all of the questions are clarified at the end” of this tight six-episode mystery, she says. But the show does give enough hints that even the questions it doesn’t expressly answer can be resolved by a viewer who’s willing to comb through the first five episodes for clues.\n\nAs much as she loved True Detective’s first season, López admits that its resolution—which hinged on a character who was only briefly glimpsed early in the series—was a bit of a cheat, since the audience couldn’t solve the mystery merely by watching the show. “I didn’t do that,” she says. “I took the risk of putting everything on the table.” And the character, or characters, “that committed the deed are right there in front of you through the entire series,” if you only know where to look.\n\n“I thought that because we were going to be dealing with the very delicate subject—a little overused lately—of murdered and missing Indigenous women, that at least one of the detectives in the series should belong to the culture. Because having white characters to come figure out what went wrong in there, I just don’t believe in that.”\n\nReis, a champion boxer turned actor, floored López and casting director Francine Maisler with her Independent Spirit–nominated performance in the 2021 thriller Catch the Fair One. Though López says the HBO brass were skeptical about the character shift at first, “the moment they saw even the photographs of Kali—the power and the majesty of Kali Ries—they immediately stopped talking.”\n\nMuch like McConaughey’s Rust Cohle and Harrelson’s Marty Hart, Danvers and Navarro—who had a falling out sometime before the events of the season, a thread that’s gradually explored as Night Country goes on—represent two sides of the same coin. López describes Foster’s character, the prototypical great cop with a messy personal life, as the left brain, with the right brain belonging to Reis’s character, an Army vet who sometimes has mystifying visions. “One is utterly rational and verbal and works in deduction, and the other one is instinctual and knows how to relate to people,” says López. Time, it seems, really is a flat circle—particularly since unlike the second season of True Detective, Night Country explicitly takes place in the same universe as the show’s first season.\n\nThere aren’t as obvious analogues for Night Country’s other main characters: Hank Prior, a less than scrupulous cop played by Oscar nominee John Hawkes, and Peter Prior (Finn Bennett), his idealistic son, who struggles to juggle the demands of the Tsalal case (and Danvers) with the needs of his young family. He’s sort of like Clarice Starling if her crucible had been Alaska instead of a Baltimore maximum-security prison.\n\nThere’s an Oedipal undertone to Hank, Peter, and Danvers’s dynamic—“That was not in the script,” López laughs—as well as a depth that the showrunner credits largely to Hawkes. By the time he boarded the show, she says, “Hank had become something much more complex—someone craving love, but incapable of receiving it.”\n\nLoss, murder, precarious mental health, historic racism, the effects of climate change on the Arctic—it’s heavy stuff, particularly placed against a backdrop of endless night and temperatures that sometimes plummeted to -23 degrees Celsius. (On the plus side, López says her actors relished the show’s grueling 120-day shoot in Iceland because “they love the opportunity of not having to pretend they were cold.”) But Night Country often has a surprisingly light touch, as well as a vein of dark humor that, if not wholly missing from the original True Detective, is certainly more foregrounded here.\n\nThat, too, came easily to López, who got her start writing telenovelas and romantic comedies. “As a Mexican, our survival tool in the face of horror is both beauty and laughter,” she says. “That’s how we cope with it…. The most salient feature of Mexican culture is how we laugh and celebrate death and bones.”\n\nHer background also informs Danvers and Navarro’s relationship—which, like Rust and Marty’s, is really what Night Country is all about. “When I talked to HBO about the first draft, I was like, deep down, this is a rom-com,” she says. “These are two characters that love each other, found each other and fell in love, and then fell out of love terribly. Now they’re enemies. And that’s when we meet them. And the show is the story of how they fall back in love. This is friendship. But in the end, it’s the same thing.”"
