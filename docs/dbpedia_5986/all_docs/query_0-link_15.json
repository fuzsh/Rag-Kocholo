        "text": "[SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] “I’m Robert Eggers, the director of ‘The Lighthouse.’” [FOG SIGNAL SOUNDING] “This is the evening of Robert Pattinson’s character’s first night working as an assistant lighthouse keeper on a mysterious and remote island. And he’s not used to the loud sound of the incessant fog machine.” [FOG SIGNAL SOUNDING] “After having a tense dinner with Willem Dafoe, he cracks a little— perhaps his first crack in the movie. We built every building in the film, including a 70-foot working lighthouse. That was partially because we couldn’t find locations that served the story, but also for control. Some of the dramatic camera movements in the film are written into the script as is. And the lighthouse being so tall, and our location being so remote, and our budget being modest, we weren’t able to get a tall enough techno crane to do a lot of the shots we wanted to do. So Craig Stewart, the key grip, had to invent various camera equipment with ropes and pulleys to execute these shots that were designed by me and Jarin Blaschke, the photographer.” “But this boom shot up the center of the lighthouse is the first of the moments that might suggest that there is or could be something supernatural happening. And we wanted to create a mystery around the light, around the Fresnel lens— the jewel inside the beacon of the lighthouse tower.” [MUSIC CONTINUES] “To ye, ye beauty.” “The intention behind the cinematic language of this sequence is to be somehow dreamlike and one image leads to another in an elliptical fashion. We learn, as the film goes along, that the machine room where Rob is stoking the fire is not at the bottom of the lighthouse. But because we wipe from black to black, you might get that impression, that it’s like literally at the base of the lighthouse. But it’s more conveying the feeling that he’s sort of in hell, where Willem is sort of in heaven. And these panning into black and then dollying out of black or pushing into black and then pulling out of black are devices we use in sequences like this often to sort of get inside our characters’ heads, hopefully.” [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING]"
