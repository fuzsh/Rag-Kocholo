        "text": "The Emory Cinematheque, a series of free, professional film screenings offered by the Department of Film and Media and Emory College of Arts and Sciences, is back for its 43rd season. For Fall 2024, we are pleased to present “Southern Gothic,” curated by Assistant Professor in Theater Studies, Lydia Fort.\n\nAll screenings are on Wednesdays at 7:30 p.m. in White Hall, Room 208. The Cinematheque runs from September 4 until December 4 and is free and open to the public.\n\nThe Emory Cinematheque, a series of free professional film screenings offered by the Department of Film and Media and Emory College of Arts and Sciences, is pleased to present “The Cinematic Worlds of David Lynch.” One of the most significant, eccentric, challenging, debated, and multifaceted American filmmakers still working today, Lynch has long operated on the fringes of Hollywood and his directorial career has been marked by several highs and lows. Although none of Lynch’s films have been massive hits, his name alone conjures the surreal peculiarity, dark humor, and ambivalent audiovisual tone defining his cinematic signature, a sensibility and atmosphere that many simply call “Lynchian.”\n\n\"In many ways, David Lynch’s filmmaking career has been distinguished by the consistency of his vision—even as he moves through different media, genres, and platforms—and the inconsistency of critical and commercial success,” remarks Dr. Timothy Holland, Assistant Professor in the Department of Film and Media, who curated the series. “He remains a remarkable figure in the world of cinema not only for his ability to create unforgettable films and those ‘Lynchian’ scenes and characters he’s famous for, but also his ability to keep creating on his own terms. His films belong neither to the mainstream nor the avant-garde, but occupy a space in relation to both, a space unique to his imagination, artistic output, and hold on our cultural consciousness.\""
