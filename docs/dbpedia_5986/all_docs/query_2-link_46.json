        "text": "Teenage brothers EARL and ANTOINE are making an unusual late-night drop. On the eve of their GRANDFATHER’s funeral, they’re tasked with delivering his MASON RING to the funeral home in a last-ditch effort to get it on his finger before the service the next morning. Their GRANDMOTHER has bestowed them with this sacred mission. To the boys, this will certainly ensure that older brother Earl inherits Grandfather’s sweet Cadillac (the one they pull up in) which is their real want. Upon arriving at the funeral home they learn that their point of contact MR. BRICKER has stepped out to deal with an emergency. Instead, they’re met by NATHANIEL a mysterious night security guard who tests the boys, not only to see how badly they want the car but also to learn how well they knew their grandfather and what being a Freemason meant to him as a Black man."
