Find out more today!\n\nNote: Full episode streaming is only available within the United States.\n\nContemporary Mysteries\n\nAnnika, Seasons 1-2 | Watch Now\n\nIn this Scottish noir crime drama with a wry wit, Unforgotten‘s Nicola Walker trades in cold cases for maritime murders in six riveting, unexpected episodes.\n\nInvestigator: DI Annika Strandhed is the droll and dry-witted skipper of Glasgow’s newly-formed Marine Homicide Unit, who drops literary references, breaks the fourth wall, and keeps viewers guessing through twists and turns galore.\n\nCrime Scene: Glasgow’s River Clyde and its banks are the site of the unlikely, and even baroque, murders that Annika and her team are tasked with solving.\n\nTime of Death: While literary sources inspiring Annika range from classics to classical mythology, the show is firmly rooted in 21st century Glasgow—especially so for Annika’s rebellious teenage daughter!\n\nDNA: Annika is based on the BBC Radio 4 drama Annika Strandhed, which also starred Nicola Walker in the title role, but was set in Oslo.\n\nGuilt, Seasons 1-3 | Watch Now\n\nTwo bickering, mismatched siblings haplessly attempt to cover up a deadly accident in four gripping episodes that make for a high wire balancing act between pitch-black comedy and a suburban noir thriller.\n\nThe Suspects: Guilt‘s two guilty brothers are polar opposites: the affluent, short-tempered, take-charge lawyer Max (Mark Bonnar, Unforgotten Season 2, Home Fires, Catastrophe), and the affable former musician who’s failed to launch, Jake (Jamie Sives, Chernobyl, Game of Thrones).\n\nCrime Scene: Edinburgh’s sleepy suburbs and its hipster neighborhood of Leith\n\nTime of Death: While Guilt‘s surveillance technology places it squarely in the present moment, Jake’s vinyl record store and the show’s amazing music add a rich texture of roots and rock.\n\nVan der Valk, Season 1-3 | Watch Now\n\nIn three seasons of gripping mysteries, Van der Valk and his colleagues face a trio of challenging cases set in Amsterdam, a city of bikes, boats…and bodies.\n\nInvestigator: Steely-eyed, street-smart, and unapologetic, detective Piet Van der Valk (Marc Warren, The Good Wife, Beecham House) investigates high profile cases and gritty murders\n\nCrime Scene: Amsterdam’s canals, galleries, bars, and industrial areas, where the city’s stylishness and toleration go hand in hand with murder.\n\nTime of Death: This is decidedly 21st-century Amsterdam: more prosperous, cosmopolitan, and crime-prone than ever!\n\nDNA: Van der Valk reboots the wildly popular series original series, which ran on British television from 1972 to 1992, and was based on author Nicolas Freeling’s legendary crime thrillers.\n\nBaptiste, Season 1-2 | Watch Now\n\nThe case of a missing person is not what it seems in this gripping, plot-twisting procedural that brings French detective Julien Baptiste (Tchéky Karyo) to Amsterdam for one last case.\n\nInvestigator: Retired detective Julien Baptiste, recovered from a brain tumor and walking with a limp, claims he’s “not the man I used to be.” But will his transformation hinder—or help—him to find the truth?\n\nCrime Scene: The seedy criminal underbelly of Amsterdam’s Red Light district.\n\nTime of Death: With society’s maladies like drug and human trafficking thrown in sharp relief, this mystery couldn’t be more contemporary.\n\nDNA: Baptiste is a spinoff of The Missing, in which Julien Baptiste worked to find a missing child. The Missing‘s many loyal fans will relish seeing the stubborn, stolid detective return, but new viewers need not have watched a single minute of The Missing to fully appreciate the intense experience of Baptiste.\n\nUnforgotten, Seasons 1-5 | Watch Now\n\nCan anyone escape the past, or can it resurface to engulf you at any time? In this totally unique, slow burner mystery, DCI Stuart and DI Khan investigate core suspects whose lives have—until now—moved on from the sins of the past.\n\nInvestigators: Detective duo DCI Cassie Stuart and DI Sunil “Sunny” Khan are determined and, for the most part, demon-free. She’s clever and canny, but it’s Cassie’s stillness and deep dedication to solving cold cases that make her an archeologist of the buried secret and human heart.\n\nCrime Scene: The investigation unravels in locations as diverse as the suspects themselves, from the cellar of a demolished building to the halls of Westminster.\n\nTime of Death: This contemporary whodunit has all the current forensics and technology, but flashbacks take you back to a gritty ’70s counterculture and the coke-fueled hedonism of the ’80s, with gangsters, skinheads, and IRA plots stirring up suspects’ and victims’ lives.\n\nDNA: Unforgotten shares DNA with Cold Case in its reopening of old murders, but has more in common with mysteries like Broadchurch and Happy Valley in their exploration of the lives of suspects with secrets…although detectives Stuart and Khan are, happily, dysfunction-free.\n\nMagpie Murders | Watch Now\n\nIn a beguiling twist on the traditional whodunit, murder and mayhem go meta with a delightfully suspenseful mystery-within-a-mystery in Magpie Murders, which centers on an unfinished mystery manuscript that plunges its editor into a shocking case concerning the book’s unpleasant, prima donna author.\n\nInvestigators: Susan Ryeland, book editor turned amateur sleuth, and fictional detective Atticus Pünd, “the world’s greatest detective.”\n\nCrime Scene: The cozy fictional village of Saxby-on-Avon and the bustling city of London.\n\nTime of Death: Magpie Murders weaves expertly between two interlocking time periods: the 1950s and the present day.\n\nDNA: Magpie Murders was adapted from author Anthony Horowitz’s bestselling book by the author himself.\n\nPostwar Mysteries\n\nGrantchester, Seasons 1-8 | Watch Now\n\nAmateur sleuth and vicar Sidney Chambers, and later, his successor, Will Davenport, solve murders alongside Inspector Geordie Keating in the bucolic village of Grantchester.\n\nInvestigators: Jazz-loving Reverend Sidney Chambers (James Norton) can’t help but fall into more worldly habits as he assists friend and actual detective Inspector Geordie Keating (Robson Greene) in solving murders, all the while searching for justice, spiritual fulfillment, love, and a really hip jazz club. After Sidney’s (Season 4) departure from Grantchester, his successor, Will Davenport (Tom Brittney), arrives via motorcycle, ready don the “dog collar” but keep his leather jacket—and his vows of celibacy—as he reluctantly finds himself helping Geordie unravel yet another mystery!\n\nCrime Scene: Grantchester, the picturesque village on the river Cam.\n\nTime of Death: The series is soaked in the 1950s, from the fabulous clothes to the swinging jazz to challenges of adjusting to life post war.\n\nDNA: Grantchester is based on The Grantchester Mysteries, a series of acclaimed novels by James Runcie.\n\nEndeavour, Seasons 1-9 | Watch Now\n\nBefore his signature red Jaguar, before Inspector Morse, there was Detective Constable Endeavour Morse, conducting his dogged, incorruptible pursuit of justice from the shadows of Oxford and the fringes of the police force.\n\nInvestigator: The cerebral, solitary DC Endeavour Morse (Shaun Evans) solves crossword puzzles and grisly murders in an unlikely partnership with DI Fred Thursday (Roger Allum).\n\nCrime Scene: Oxford’s spires and grassy quads, often its pubs, and all too often, its morgues.\n\nTime of Death: The 1960s, replete with miniskirts, trippy parties, counter-culture demonstrations, and an anachronistic, straight-laced police force.\n\nDNA: Twenty-five years after the debut of Inspector Morse, writer Russell Davies (also the screenwriter behind the Morse spinoff Inspector Lewis) penned the prequel Endeavour, with the input and blessing of Morse creator Colin Dexter. So strong is the Morse DNA in this show that Oxford’s intrepid journalist Dorothea Frazil is played by Abigail Thaw, daughter of the original Morse actor John Thaw; plus, every episode has a hidden Colin Dexter Easter egg, for fans who, like their favorite detectives, miss nothing.\n\nPrime Suspect: Tennison | Watch Now\n\nBehind every great detective is a backstory.
