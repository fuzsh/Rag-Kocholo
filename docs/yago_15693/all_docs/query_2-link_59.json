        "text": "The austrian habsburg court under Empress Maria Theresa has been characterized as combining an informal domesticity with a rigid ceremonial structure inherited from her predecessors. In this picture of life at the Habsburg court, the strict protocol and elaborate calendar of ceremonies only partially designated how the imperial family structured its time; protocol and ceremony coexisted, it would seem, with more casual and relaxed forms of familial interaction. Popular Austrian writing on Maria Theresa has stressed the image of the empress as mother, and the maternal quality of this portrait has colored some modern notions of how her palaces were occupied and used. Tourists visiting Schönbrunn palace, for example, are often told that many of its rooms were designed with familial contact in mind, and the resulting picture of the palace's use and habitation is curiously modern. The notion that an “imperial domesticity” governed actions at Maria Theresa's Schönbrunn has found its way into scholarly literature as well; one scholar has gone so far as to describe Schönbrunn's admixture of ceremonial and intimate spaces as vorbiedermeierlich, that is, prefiguring the family-oriented, bourgeois culture of nineteenth-century Vienna. The instigator of this myth may be Stefan Zweig, who in 1932 described Marie Antoinette's childhood at Schönbrunn as one filled with carefree play, personal freedom, and adventure, all of which prepared her inadequately for her future role as queen of France. The modern visitor to Schönbrunn might be forgiven for thinking that, despite the palace's sumptuous rooms and elegant decoration, it differs minimally from the modern single-family home.\n\n13 Contemporaries considered the Spanish protocol to be the strictest and most elaborate in Europe, and for this reason also the most unpleasant and uncomfortable. For its early history, see Hoffmann, Christine, Das Spanische Hofzeremoniell von 1500–1700 (Frankfurt, 1985)Google Scholar. Although Maria Theresa and particularly Francis I both disliked the Spanish protocol, its grandeur and pomposity effectively conveyed the dynasty's high status. Francis simplified protocol slightly, yet neither ruler changed it drastically. Instead, as I will demonstrate, they sought ways to escape or excuse themselves from ceremonies whose complexity required hours of preparation and participation. See Beales, Derek, Joseph II, vol. 1, In the Shadow of Maria Theresia, 1741–1780 (Cambridge, 1987), 32–33.Google Scholar\n\n19 On the spatial organization of the imperial apartment, see Raschauer, Oskar, “Zur Geschichte der Ausstattung des Schlosses Schönbrunn zur Zeit Maria Theresias,” in Josef Strzy-gowski. Festschrift zum 70. Geburtstag (Klagenfurt, 1932), 137–41Google Scholar; and for a comparative study of the Hofburg's imperial apartment, which paralleled Schönbrunn's arrangement, see idem, “Die kaiserlichen Wohn- und Zeremonialräume in der Wiener Hofburg,” Anzeiger der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften. Philosophisch-Historische Klasse 95 (1958): 283–91Google Scholar. The following discussion takes as its subject the appearance and arrangement of the imperial suite as it stood in 1765. It should be noted, however, that the suite was renovated in two building campaigns: the first from 1743–49, which initially rendered it inhabitable for the new empress's court, and another beginning in 1754 that involved renovation of several spaces, including the Grosse Galerie. Furthermore, Maria Theresa left some spaces at Schönbrunn deliberately unaltered, most notably the Blaue Stiege, whose ceiling fresco by Sebastiano Ricci dates from 1701–2. My focus here is less the building history of these spaces than the conceptual frameworks suggested by the arrangement of palatial space before and after 1765.\n\n36 Numerous references to Maria Theresa's habit of sequestering herself from public view or living in isolation are documented in Khevenhüller-Metsch's diary, as the following samples demonstrate. 15 October 1765: “[A]ls an Theresiae Tag ware zwar die Kaiserin-Königin invisible und hatte sich schon seither gestern auf acht Tage eingesperret.” 18 May 1770: “[V]erblibe die Kaiserin wegen der heutigen Epoque des achzehntenden Tag des Monats gewöhnicher-massen retiriret und speiste allein in die Cammer.” On occasion, remaining alone required the empress to abandon Schönbrunn in favor of the Hofburg, as on 31 August 1771, when Khevenüller-Metsch reports the following: “[An diesem Tag] übernachtete die Kaiserin in der Statt, weil sie wegen der traurigen Epoque du jour niemand sehen wollen.” “Epoque” seems to be Khevenüller's gently sarcastic shorthand for those times when the empress entered a state of prolonged isolated mourning.\n\n40 Unfortunately, we lack a modern study of this building that would allow precise comparisons between it and Schönbrunn. Christian Witt-Dörring briefly mentions Maria Theresa's renovations there in the context of furniture design at court, and records indicate that court artists were active at Hetzendorf between 1743–45. Witt-Dörring further cites Khevenhüller-Metsch's diary from 11 July 1743, in which the author writes that Maria Theresa gifted this palace to her mother because of its healthy surroundings and because it lay a short ride from Schönbrunn. Witt-Dörring, Christian, “Die Möbelkunst am Wiener Hof zur Zeit Maria Theresias (1740–1780)” (Ph.D. diss., University of Vienna, 1978), 12.Google Scholar\n\n46 For the history of earlier imperial widows and their architectural activities, see Iby, , Schönbrunn, 40–42, 44–45, 72Google Scholar. The modern palace, begun by von Erlach, Fischer in 1696Google Scholar, was built on the site of an earlier structure destroyed during the Turkish siege of 1683. This earlier building shared similarities with its eighteenth-century successor, serving intermittently as a hunting lodge and widow's retreat. Recent research has shown that this earlier palace was built on the ruins of considerably humbler structures, some dating to the twelfth century, and that Eleonora Gonzaga was largely responsible for its architectural reconfiguration in the 1640s.
