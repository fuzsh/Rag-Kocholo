At the Ballantyne Pram w Digitized by VjOOQIC THE EDITOR'S PREFACE TO THE FIFTEENTH EDITION Tbk Fifteenth Edition of \" Men and Women of the Time \" contains 1660 new biographies. Very many of the old Uvea have been re-written or greatly extended, and the volume is longer than its predecessor by nearly three hundred pages. It is, therefore, no exaggeration to speak of it as almost one half new. The Editor in his long labour of love has had much encouragement from his many correspondents, notably from experts in biography, whose candid estimate of \" Men and Women of the Time,\" especially in its connection with the \" Dictionary of National Biography,\" has been in the nature of a vote of confidence in the book. He desires to offer his sincere thanks to these gentlemen, and to couple with them all those who have assisted in the work of production. Especially is the Editor indebted to the late Mr. Edmund Boutledge, whose sudden and pathetic death occurs on the eve of publica- tion, and who in 1898 gave him much advice and assistance, particularly in the compilation of lists of new biographies, and allowed him to make use of his well-known \" Book of the Year,\" and the materials employed in its compilation ; to his venerable friend Sir John Simon, K.C.B., for permission to use a privately circulated pamphlet; to Mr. Auberon Herbert, ex- Governor Eyre, Dr. Haffkine, Mr. James Knowles, and a number of others, for important but hitherto unpublished matter ; to Mr. Mackenzie Bell for a revision, from personal knowledge, of the life of Mr. Swinburne; to the Rev. R. C. Fillingham for personally interviewing Count Okuma on behalf of the book; to his American Editor, Dr. Winkelmann, for Transatlantic memoirs and additions; to Mr. Payen- Payne, and his collaborator, Mr. Holford Knight, for undertaking all lives, both new and old, of foreign celebrities ; to Mr. C. R. Hewitt, of the Royal College of Surgeons' Library, for memoirs of soldiers, sailors, and such statesmen as Ijords Salisbury and Boeebery, of Mr. Cecil Rhodes, Dr. Jameson, and leading members of the Boyal Family; and to Mr. F. W. Walton, M.A, Librarian of King's College, London, for various biographies and considerable sub-editorial assistance. The book has necessarily been long in the press, and it has therefore been found impossible to note some of the changes of the last nine or ten Digitized by Google vi PREFACE months in their proper places. Among these mention should be made of Mr, Justice Bucknill's elevation to the Bench, and Sir Joseph Russell Bailey's elevation to the Peerage as Lord Glanusk, under which title he should properly appear. Sir Henry Hawkins also should be under \" Baron Brampton,\" Sir L. Alma-Tadema, R.A., should appear as a Knight, and Prof. Sir Michael Foster as a KC.R (both created June 1899). Sir David Barbour's recent services and honour should have been mentioned, as also Sir Godfrey Lushington's G.C.M.G. (June 1899), and the G.C.B.'s of General Sir Robert Biddulph, Admiral the Hon. Sir E. R. Fremantle, and Admiral Sir John Ommaney Hopkins (June 1899), while to the name of Sir F. M. Hodgson the birthday honour of K.C.B. should have been added, and E^rl Beauchamp's appointment to be Governor and Commander-in-Chief of New South Wales in succession to Viscount Hampden (Janaary 1899), and his creation to be K.C.M.G. should also have been recorded. Dr. William Selby Church became President of the Royal College of Physicians, London, in March 1899, Dr. Lewis-Lloyd of Bangor is deceased, the young Duke of Albany, as heir-apparent to the Grand-Duke of Saze-Coburg and Gotha, was taken by his mother, H.R.H. the Duchess of Albany, to complete his education in Germany (August 1899), and Maitre Labori was dangerously wounded on his way to the daily sitting of the Rennes court-martial (August 15). A short Appendix at the end of the book contains lives unavoidably omitted in the body of the work, in which the memoir of Jules Ferry should not, of course, appear. The List of Assumed Names has been doubled, and the Classified Index has been entirely re-cast, care having been taken to repeat individual names under all the necessary categories. A Subject Index, such as that attached to Mr. Boase's dictionary of deceased celebrities, would undoubtedly have added to the value of a work which is a storehouse of historical details as well as of biographies. The Editor sometimes thought of compUing such an Index, but found that even a scanty one would have proved inordinately long. The reader who is in search of movements rather than of men will doubtleSs know under what names to look for his facts, e.g., for \"Lancet Commission\" see \"Twining, Louisa,\" and for ''Jamaica Revolt\" tee \" Eyre.\" During the passage of \"Men and Women of the Time\" through the press the following have died :— Latimer Clark, F.R.S.

Daniel Lewis-Lloyd (Aug. 1899). Mention of these names will be found in the Obituary, which has been broaght down to the end of July 1899. Some 370 biographies have, in fact, lapsed out of Edition Fifteen. But though the average of distinguished mortality in the period 1895-99 has been less than in that between 1891—95, scantier losses have been well-nigh counterbalanced by the importance of those lost. One need only cite at random such names as Bismarck, Gladstone, Alphonse Daudet, Lord Leighton. The death of Mr. Gladstone, whose biography was the lengthiest in the book, removes one of the survivors of the 1st Edition of \"Men of the Time,\" published in 1852. These survivors now^ only number seven. They are Queen Victoria, the Emperor of Austria, the Prince de Joinville, the Duke of Argyll, Mr. T. Sidney Cooper, H.A., Mr. Frederick Gk)odall, R.A., and Mr. Philip James Bailey, author of \" Festus.\" Kknbihotok. Ait!n**t 1899.

Digitized by Google MEN AND WOMEN OF THE TIME ABBAS PACHA, Khedive of Egypt, KG.C.B., is the eldest son of the late Tew6k Pacha. He was bom on July 14, 1874, and succeeded bis father in January 1892, when he was eighteen years of age. He had previoDsly studied with his brother, Hehemet Ali, at the Theresiannm Aca- demy, in Vienna, and was still there at the time of his father's death. He studied law and politics, for which he displayed great aptitude. Prince Abbas Pacha was made Hon. K.G.C.B. by the Queen in 1892. His attitude towards Great Britain is not considered a friendly one, he having early in 1893 substituted statesmen' of anti- Snglish sympathies for those appointed by England. Lord Cromer remonstrated with him, and the Khedive was persuaded to compromise ; but he is still not really friendly towards England. In July 1893 he paid a visit of homage to the Sultan of Tnrkey. In 1895 a daughter was born to him in his harem, and he afterwards mairied the mother. ABBE, Oleveland, bom in New York City, Dec. 3, 1838, is the son of George Waldo Abbe and Charlotte Colgate, both natives of the United States of America, and of purely English ancestry. The earliest American ancestry of this family was John Abbey, of Salem, Massachusetts, in 1637.

(Michigan University) 1889, Ph.D. 1892; was Director of the Cincinnati Obser- vatory, 1868-74, Professor of Meteorology in the Signal Service, and Assistant to the Chief Signal Officer, 1871 to 1891, and is now (1893) Senior Professor of Meteorology in the \"Weather Bureau of the Department of Agriculture.\" He is a Member of the National Academy of Sciences, and of numerous other scientific societies in America and Europe ; author of \"The Weather Bulletin of the Cin- cinnati Observatory,\" 1869 ; \" Annual Summary and Review of Progress in Meteorology,\" 1873 annually to 1889 ; \"Report on the Signal Service Observa- tions of the Total Eclipse of 1878\"; \" Treatise on Meteorological Apparatus and Methods,\" 1887 ; \"Preparatory Stndies for Deductive Methods in Storm and Weather Predictions,\" 1890; \"The Mechanics of the Atmosphere,\" 1891 ; and numerous smaller memoirs. He was Delegate to the Intemational Convention of 1893 in Washington on Prime Meridian and Standard Time ; and to the International Conference of Meteorologists in Munich, 1891. As Meteorologist to the United States Scientific Expedition to the West Coast of Africa, 1889-90, he made the first extensive set of accurate observations at sea of the movements of upper and lower clouds — using a marine nephroscope devised by him for this purpose. ABBBT, Edwin Austin, R.A., RI., was born April 1, 1852, at Philadelphia, U.S.A., and was a pupil of the Pennsyl- vania Academy of Fine Arts. In 1871 he began drawing for the publications of Harper Brothers. In 1876 he became a Member of the American Water-Colonr Society. In 1878 he removed to England.

After practising that profession for a short time he abandoned it for the study of theology, and was ordained a Congregational Minister in 1860. He was pastor of various churches until 186S, when he was appointed Secre- tary of the American Union (Freedmen's) Commission, a position retained by him until 1868.

He had charge of the \" Literary Record \" in ffarper't Magazine for several years, at the same time con- ducting the lUuilrated Christian Weekly. Subsequently he was associated with Mr. Beecher in editing the Ckrittian Union, now called The Outlook, of which be later became (and still is) the senior editor. On Mr. Beecher's death he was invited to fill temporarily the pulpit of Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, and in 1889 was settled permanently over that church. In con- junction with his brothers Austin and Benjamin he wrote two novels, \"Cone-cut Comers,\" 1865, and \"Matthew Caraby,\" 1868, which were published under the pseu- donym of \" Benanly, \" formed from the ini- tial syllables of the authors' names. He is the author also of \" Jesus of Nazareth, His Life and Teachings,\" 1869; \"Old Testament Shadows of New Testament Truths,\" 1870; \"A Dictionary of Bible Knowledge,\" 1872; \"A Layman's Story,\" 1872; \"Illustrated Commentary on the New Testament,\" 4 vols., 1875-87 ; \" Life of Henry Ward Beecher,\" 1883; \"For Family Worship,\" 1883 ; \" In Aid of Faith,\" 1886; \"Signs of Promise,\" 1889; \"The Christian Workers,\" \"Dlustrated New Testament Commentary,\" 1896; \"Chris- tianity and Social Problems,\" 1896 ; \"The Theology of an Evolutionist,\" 1897 ; in addition to which be has published a number of pamphlets, among them \"The Results of Emancipation in the United States,\" 1867 ; and has also edited two volumes of sermons of Mr. Beecher, and a selection from Mr. Beecher's writings, entitled \"Morning and Evening Exer- cises,\" as well as \" The Soul's Quest after God.\" The degree of D.D. was conferred upon him by the University of the City of New York in 1876, and by Harvard University In 1890.

Bom on Dec. 20, in London, in 1838, he was educated at the City of London School (1850-57), and at St. John's College, Cambridge, of which he became a Fellow (B.A., 7th Senior Optime and Senior in the Classical Tripos, 1861 ; first- class in Theological Tripos, 1862; M.A. 1864). He was Assistant Master in King Edward's School, Birmingham, from 1862 to 1864, and subsequently at Clifton Col- lege till 1866, when he was appointed Head Master of the City of London School. This school was at this time in Milk Street, Cheapside ; it now possesses sumptnons new buildings on the Embankment at Blackfriars, and under the Head Master's guidance has taken a position as one of the most efficient day schools in England. Dr. Abbott was twice Select Preacher at Cambridge; Hulsean Lecturer in that University, 1876; also Select Preacher at Oxford, 1877. The Archbishop of Canter- bury conferred on him the degree of D.D. in 1872.

ABD-TTIi-HAKCD IL, Sultan of Turkey, was bom Sept. 22, 1842, being a younger son and the fourth child of Abd- oI-Medjld, the Saltan, who died in 1861. On Angnst 31, 187S, he succeeded his brother, Monrad V., who was deposed, on proof of his insanity, after a reign of three months. Abd-ul-Hamid was solemnly pit with the sword of Othman in the Syoub Mosque. Constantinople, on Sept 7. He is a Turk and a Mussulman of the old ichool, and though without allies, he fought Bossia rather than submit to any conditions which should bring about a disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. On April 21, 1877, Boasia declared war against the Porte, and in February 1878, after the fall of Plevna and the passage of the Balkans, the I'urks were compelled to sue for peace. Since the Treaty of Berlin, in 1878, the Saltan has shown no great anxiety to carry out the reforms, either in Europe or in Asia, which were therein stipulated. though in r^iard to Bulgaria and Eastern Roumelia he has been rairly loyal to that treaty. He was often praised by Iiord Beaeonsfleld for his courage and ability ; but of brte years he has been given over to the fear of assassination, and his dis- trost of his ministers is proverbial. He has been at various times under English, Oerman, and Russian influence ; the last seems to be now prevailing, although his conduct towards Sir Philip Currie has been most flattering. The Sultan ha* never ceaaed to protest against the pro- ceedings of England in Egypt, ana is believed to have secretly stimulated the rebellion of Arab!. His treatment of bis Christian subjects in Armenia and Crete during the past tliree yean has stirred up against him an almost universal feeling of contempt and execration. In August 1896 an outbreak took place in Constantinople itself, which resulted in the mnrder of thousands of Armenian Christians in the city. The Sultan was directly accused by the ambassadors of the Powers of having instigated the perpetration of this massacre. No further steps, however, were taken, and he succeeded in emptying the city of nearly 30,000 Armenians by expulsive measures. Amongst his own Turkish subjects the snccessful issue of the war vrith Greece, in the early part of 1897, lias placed him on a more secure footing. On the occasion of the marriage of his daughter, the Princess Naime, in March 1898, the Sultan arranged that dinners should be given at his expense at different points throughout Constantinople, in order that rich and poor should share in the festivities. ABSTTXAAHICAII' or ABDUB- RAHHAN KHAN, Ameer of Afghani- stan, is a Barakzai, and was bom about 1830. He is the eldest son of Afznl Khan, and nephew of the late Ameer Shere AIL During the oivil war in 1864 Abdurrahman played a leading part on the side of his father against his uncle, and gained several battles. The great victories of Shaikbabad and Khelat-i-Ohilzai were mainly due to his ability. He was entrusted with the Governorship of Balkh, where he made himself popular by his moderation, and by marrying the daughter of the chief of Badakshan. In 1868 he was unable, how- ever, to offer a succe.'ufal resistance to his cousin, Yakoub Khan, son of Shere Ali, who defeated him at Bajgah, near Bamain, and also finally at Tinah Khan. Abdur- rahman then fled from the country, ulti- mately reaching Russian territory. General Kaufmann permitted him to re- side at Samarcand, and allowed him a pension of twenty-five thousand roubles a year. He remained in Turkestan until Digitized by Google ABDY— A. BECKETT 1879, when he slowly made his way throQgh Balkh to the Cabul frontier, and in July of the following year he was for- mally chosen by the leading men of Cabal, and acknowledged by the British Indian Government, as Ameer of Afghanistan. It has been pointed out by an eminent orientalist, \"that he not only occupies the throne by right of heredity and national election, but that he is also a religious Snnni ruler, who reigns orer a 'God- S'ven ' country by the <!on««>Mut fiddium,\" e has still farther strengthened this strong position by the firmness and vigour of his administration. From the British Govemuient he receives a regular subsidy of £160,000 a year, with large gifts of artillery, rifles, and ammunition to improve his military force. On Dec. 26, 1888, be was shot at by a Sepoy at Mazar-i-Sherif, but without injury. In September 1893 the Ameer cordially received a British mission headed by Sir Mortimer Durand. His sympathies are British rather than Russian, and in letters written both before and after the Durand mission, to his friend Dr. Leitner, and published by the latter, he has expressed warm friendship for England. He suffered from a serious illness in the autumn of 1891, which caused considerable anxiety in England and India. He was made a G.C.S.I. in January 1894, and was invited by the Queen to visit En^iland. Being, however, unable to come himself, he sent bis second son, the Shazada NasruUah Khan, who received a warm welcome, in 1895. He was sus- pected of conniving at the rising of the tribes along the Indo-Afgban frontier in July 1897, and he was requested by the Indian Government to prevent his subjects from participating in these revolts. His answer showed him to be thoroughly friendly to the British Government, and he gave further proof of this disposition when he refused in September to receive a deputation of Afridis which had set out for Cabul in order to beg for his aid against the English.

Sir John Emerich Edward Dalbergr Acton, Bart., D.C.L., son of Sir Ferdinand Richard Edward Acton, Bart., of Alden- ham, Shropshire, by the only daughter of the Duke of Dalberg (afterwards wife of the second Lord Granville), was bora at Naples in 1834, and when about three years of age succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father. For a few years he was a student in the Catholic College of St, Mary's Oscott, at the time when Dr. (afterwards Cardinal) Wiseman was at the head of that institution ; but his education was mainly due to the re- nowned ecclesiastical historian Dr. D61- linger, of Hanich, with whom he lived for a considerable time. Sir John Acton re- presented Carlow in the House of Commons from 1859 to 1865. In the latter year he stood as a candidate for the borough of Bridgnorth, when he announced in a speech delivered to the electors that he repre- sented not the body, but the spirit of the Boman Catholic Church. He was success- ful at the poll by a majority of one, but on a scrutiny was unseated. In 1869, on the recommendation of Mr. Gladstone, he was created a peer of the United Kingdom by the title of Baron Acton of Aldenham. In the same year he repaired to Rome, on the assembling of the CBcumenical Council, and while there rendered himself conspi- cuous by his hostility to the definition of the doctrine of Papal Infallibility, and by the activity and secrecy with which he rallied, combined, and urged on those who ap- peared to be favourable to the views enter- tained by Dr. Dollinger. It is believed that he was in relation with the AW/emeine Zeitung, and that much of the news pub- lished by that journal on the subject of the Council was communicated by his lordship.
