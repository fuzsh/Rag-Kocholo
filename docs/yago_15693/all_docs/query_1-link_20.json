        "text": "Prince Karl Adolf Andreas of Hesse, the third of five children of the late Prince Christoph of Hesse and Princess Sophie of Greece and Denmark died on March 23 at his home in Munich, Germany. He was 84 years old.\n\nThe prince was born in Berlin on March 26, 1937. His civil marriage to Countess Yvonne Margit Valerie Szapáry von Muraszombath, Széchysziget und Szapáry took place in The Hague on 26 March 1966.\n\nThe couple had two children, Prince Christoph (1969) and Princess Irina (1971) who in 1999 married Count Alexander von Schönburg-Glauchau. The children were baptized in the Lutheran church.

The suffering of innocent people, so many lives lost and destroyed, from the terror that was imposed upon all our citizens, keeps wounds hurting and the memory of this tragedy fresh.\n\nThis was an unprecedented event of total aggression in Europe since World War Two, that was not authorized by the United Nations. Once again, regrettably, it is confirmed that violence only produces more violence and pain. And innocent people are those who always suffer the most.\n\nThe memory of this aggression needs to remain alive and fresh; we must never forget all those that tragically fell as victims of this madness. They always must be in our minds, our hearts, and our prayers. We owe it to them, but also us, so that tragedy like this can never happen again”, said HRH Crown Prince Alexander in his message.\"\n\nCountess Margherita of Arco-Zinneburg married Charles Douglas Green on March 19 at the Asam Basilica of St Margaretha in Altenmarkt, near Deggendorf, Bavaria.\n\nRoyal Musings broke the news of their engagement in December.\n\nhttps://royalmusingsblogspotcom.blogspot.com/2021/12/countess-margherita-von-und-zu-arco.html\n\nThe Roman Catholic service was officiated by Father Alessandro Prince of Bourbon-Two-Sicilies, and St. Margaretha's priest, Father Emanuel Hartmann.\n\nFather Alessandro, a member of the Legionaries of Christ, is the son of Prince Casimir of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, and a first cousin of the bride's mother, Archduchess Maria Beatrice of Austria.

He \"waved a cheerful greeting\" to the German naval attache, Capt. Koeper and other friends went out to \"the steamship on the company's tender.\"\n\nThe voyage was \"pleasant and uneventful,\" although Prince Henry was \"tired out\" during the first few days of the trip across the Atlantic.

Her younger brother, Prince Charles Edward, Duke of Albany, is also the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. As he is a minor, Car Eduard, as he is known in Germany, reigns under a regency headed by the Hereditary Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, who is married to Princess Alexandra of Edinburgh, third daughter of the late Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who died in 1900, a year after his only son, Hereditary Prince Alfred. In a family agreement, he was succeeded by his young nephew, Prince Charles Edward, who with his mother, the Duchess of Albany, moved to Germany, where he could be raised as a German sovereign.\n\nPrincess Alice, Kaiser Wilhelm II and the Hereditary Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg are first cousins, all grandchildren of Queen Victoria.\n\nEdward Charles Rolle Fane Trefusis is second in line to the Barony of Clinton, the seventh oldest barony in the peerage of England. He is the elder son of the Hon. Charles Patrick Rolle Trefusis and Rosanna (Rosy) Izat.\n\nCharles is the heir apparent to the Clinton barony as he is the only son of the 22nd Lord Clinton, Gerard Neville Mark Fane, later Fane Trefusis after changing his surname by Deed Poll in 1959. The name change took place two years after the death of his great-grandfather, Charles Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis, 21st Lord Clinton. That same year, Gerard married Nicola Harriet Purdon Coote.\n\nEdward was born on February 16, 1994.\n\nWhen the 21st Lord Clinton died on July 5, 1957, the barony went into abeyance as he had only two daughters, the Hon. Harriet Fane (1887-1958) and the Hon. Fenella Fane(1889-1966).\n\nHarriet married in 1910 to Major Henry Neville Fane. They were the parents of seven children, including Charles Neville Fane (1911-1940). He was killed in action, leaving behind a widow, Gladys Lowther, a young son, Gerald (1934), and two daughters, Carol and Fiona.\n\nIt was Gerard's Aunt Fenella, who played a role in making sure her nephew inherited the peerage. In 1914, she married the Hon. John Bowes-Lyon, 2nd son of the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. John (1886-1930) was an older brother of the late Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother.\n\nIt was on March 18, 1965, that Gerard received the Writ \"summoning him to the House of Lords,\" which had been \"passed under the Great Seal.\" He told The Times that his Aunt Fenella had \"had let it go to me,\" the new Lord Clinton. \"I shall take my seat in the House of Lords as soon as it is practicable.\"\n\nThe new Lord Clinton was the senior male descendant through the female line of the 21st Lord Clinton.\n\nFenella and John were the parents of five daughters, including Anne Bowes-Lyon who married twice, first to Viscount Anson, and following their divorce, she married Prince Georg of Denmark.\n\nA genetic defect in the Clinton family was in the family's DNA and affected male and female descendants. The children of Harriet and Fenella were the most affected. Three of Harriet's daughters, Idonea (1912-2002), Rosemary (1914-1972), and Ethelreda (1922-1996), and two of Fenella's daughters, Nerissa (1919-1986) and Katherine (1926-2014) were all born with severe mental disabilities. Rosemary's twin brother, Edmund lived for only 11 months. Fenella's first-born daughter, Patricia, was also 11 months old when she died in June 1917.\n\nIn the 1930s Lord Clinton arranged for his five granddaughters to be placed in the Royal Earlswood Hospital in Redhill, Surrey, where the family believed the young girls would receive proper care.\n\nH Ill H Countess Caroline Anna Amalia zu Solms-Sonnewalde is the second of three daughters of the late H Ill H Count Alfred Otto Friedrich zu Solms-Sonnewalde (1932-1922) and Christine Hüsmert (1964) She was born in Weldam in the Netherlands on August 13, 1994.\n\nThe marriage of Count Alfred zu Solms-Sonnewalde and Christine Hüsmert, MD\n\nCount Alfred died on February 11, 2022, at Schloss Wurschen in Weissenburg, Germany, where he and his wife and three daughters lived after the fall of communism.

Other rooms including the ballroom are available for rent.\n\nThe late Count's estate was divided between his three daughters. The eldest daughter, Countess Charlotte has taken over the Dutch estate, including Schloss Weldam, while the youngest sister, Countess Isabelle, inherited Schloss Wurschen and other German properties.\n\nCountess Caroline is the heir to her father's properties in Scotland.\n\nCount Alfred was the last male in the Solms-Sonnewalde line, which means this title is extinct.\n\nEdward will eventually inherit the family seat at Heanton Satchville in Okehampton, Devon. He has a BS in Agricultural Management and an MBA in Advanced Farm Management from the Royal Agricultural University. He currently works as a trader at ADM Agriculture Ltd in London.\n\nHis grandfather is the largest private landowner in Devon.\n\nhttps://clintondevon.com/\n\nThe wedding will take place on May 23, 2023"
