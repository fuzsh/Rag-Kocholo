        "text": "Princess Robijn said:\n\nhi, does anyone have information/pictures of the Grand Duke of Tuscany and his family..\n\nIf I am correct, he is also Archduke of Austria\n\nThe Grand Duke of Tuscany and Head of the Grand Ducal House is Sigismund, born 1966.\n\nHe is also an Archduke of Austria, Prince of Hungary, Prince of Bohemia and Prince of Tuscany, with the style Imperial and Royal Highness.\n\nHe succeeded his father, Grand Duke Leopold Franz in 1993 when his father renounced his rights as Head of the Grand Ducal House on his second marriage.\n\nArchduke Sigismund married in 1999 a Scottish aristocrat, Elyssa Edmonstone (b 1973), daughter of Sir Archibald Edmonstone, 7th Baronet Edmonstone. This marriage was fully recognised by Archduke Otto, Head of the House of Habsburg, as 'equal'. They have three children:\n\nArchduke Leopoldo-Amedeo (b 2001), Grand Prince of Tuscany\n\nArchduchess Tatyana (b 2003)\n\nArchduke Maximilian (b 2004)\n\nHere is a pic, courtesy Corbis.\n\nArchduke Sisigmund & Archduchess Elyssa of Tuscany - Wedding 1999\n\nfrank22 said:\n\nCheck this article about the interest of Mrs. Francesca Thyssen and husband to be presidents of Austria\n\nThe same can be found here, in English, minus Archduchess Francesca who doesn't appear to have any relevance to the news report but has been included in the Spanish version for no particular reason:\n\nFrom the EarthTimes.org\n\nHabsburgs fight for right to run for Austrian president : World\n\n16 September 2009\n\nMembers of the former imperial Habsburg family are fighting to win the right to be elected Austrian president, by ending a constitutional ban of such nominations, they confirmed Wednesday. \"That is a human rights violation of the worst kind,\" Ulrich Habsburg-Lothringen told the German Press Agency dpa. The 68-year old agricultural expert and his daughter-in-law have filed their case with the Constitutional Court in early September and hope for a decision before next year's presidential polls.\n\nAustria's constitution states that for presidential elections, \"members of ruling families or families that ruled in the past are excluded from being eligible.\"Habsburg-Lothringen said he was \"definitely\" interested in running for Austria's head of state, but that he was also working in the interest of other members of his family.\n\nHabsburg-Lothringen serves as a councilman for the Green party in the town of Wolfsberg in Austria's south. He is a third-degree nephew of Otto von Habsburg, the son of the last emperor Charles. The lawyer who represents the two Habsburgs said that the Constitutional Court has the power to strike the words \"or families that ruled in the past\" from the constitution, if it finds that they conflict with democratic principles.\n\n- - -\n\nCount Ulrich is a descendant of Archduke Heinrich Ferdinand, a son of Ferdinando IV, the last reigning Grand Duke of Tuscany (1835-1908).\n\nThe Archduke married morganatically in 1919.\n\nâ€‹"
