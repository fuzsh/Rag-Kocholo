It surrounds a Benedictine abbey (Kloster) which is one of the most popular pilgrimage destinations in Bavaria.\n\nOn the north (left) side of the abbey church, immediately across from the main entrance is the Schmerzhafte Kapelle (Chapel of Sorrows). Here are buried the remains of Prince Heinrich (younger son of King Rupert and Queen Antonia. On the left wall of the chapel is a marble tablet with the coat-of-arms of Bavaria on the left, and a German inscription on the right:\n\nHEINRICH\n\nKOENIGLICHER PRINZ\n\nVON BAYERN\n\nGEBOREN AM 28·3·1922\n\nIN HOHENBVRG·LENGGRIES\n\nGESTORBEN AM 14·2·1958\n\nIN BARILOCHE·ARGENTINIEN Henry,\n\nRoyal Prince\n\nof Bavaria,\n\nborn March 28, 1922,\n\nat Hohenburg, Lenggries,\n\ndied February 14, 1958,\n\nat Bariloche, Argentina\n\nSeveral members of the Royal Family were married in the abbey church: Princess Maria-Theresia (eldest daughter of Prince Rasso) and Count Thomas Kornis in 1977; Prince Luitpold (son of Prince Ludwig and Princess Irmingard) and Beatrix Wiegand in 1979; Antonia Brunetti (daughter of Princess Editha) and Erich Graf von Waldburg zu Zeil und Trauchburg in 1982; Princess Gisela (youngest daughter of Prince Rasso) and Alexander Prinz von Sachsen-Gessaphe in 1987.\n\nSunday masses are celebrated in the abbey church at 9.00, 10.15, and 11.30 a.m., and at 6.00 p.m. Daily mass is at 7.15 a.m.\n\nFrom the main entrance of the abbey church one can take the right path and walk down the hill to the Wittelsbacher Friedhof (Wittelsbach Cemetery). The cemetery was established by King Albert in 1980. 1 It lies in a walled compound which was formerly part of the monk's garden. The key to the cemetery can be requested at the Klosterpforte (abbey porter's lodge).\n\nThe remains of King Albert lie on the far side of the cemetery between those of his first wife Queen Marita and of his second wife Queen Marie Jenke. Each grave is marked by a rectangular stone border which encloses some plants. On the wall behind each of the graves grow rose bushes between which are German inscriptions:"
