OL LECTORS of Engravings, more . especially of Portraits, will readily understand that the task of compiling a Catalogue of the dimensions of the present volume, is one which entails a vast amount of labour, and absorbs a very considerable amount of time. At the outset we would state that whilst we have aimed at accuracy with regard to the dates of birth and death of the persons mentioned, we disclaim any great research in this direction. Our effort has been, not to compile a biographical dictionary, but to give only such particulars in respect to dates, as will enable an intending purchaser to determine whether the print described is that of the person whose portrait he desires. What we have endeavoured to do, however, is to give as accurate a description of the state of the print as is possible in the limited space at our disposal. In a Catalogue containing upwards of 1 4,000 items, there must of necessity be many portraits which have no claim to the description \" scarce.\" But the age of copper and steel plate engraving having all but passed away, many portraits now regarded as common must, in process of time — and that time not very far distant — inevitably become difficult to procure. The following pages contain a vast number of portraits, the rarity of which is proved by their absence from the majority of the catalogues of prints which have appeared for many years past. The enormous increase in the value of mezzotint portraits has been very marked for some considerable time ; and the tendency is still distinctly upward. To such an extent, indeed, have prices risen and so largely increased is the demand, it may reasonably be anticipated that in the near future, mezzotint portraits will be outside the reach of all but the wealthy. A large number will be found in these pages, many in early and rare states, worthy a place in the portfolio of the most fastidious collector. These were purchased long before the rise in value took place, hence the extremely moderate figures at which they are priced. 4 PREFACE. There will also be found many fine productions by the earlier engravers, viz., the Passes, Elstracke, Delaram, and others, as well as fine examples by Faithorne, Faber, Edelinck, Bartolozzi, etc., the whole forming a combination of artistic, historical, and biographical interest not found in any other pursuit. Collectors of portraits for that most edifying and intellectual recreation \" extra-illustrating,\" will find an immense number suitable for their purpose, including a very large selection of the fine plates executed for the standard historical works published by Messrs. Bentley, the engraving of which was entrusted to such men as Greatbach, Joseph Brown, G. Cook, and others ; and the entire existing stock of which we acquired, when that firm retired from business. And in this connection we might state, that in addition to those contained in this Catalogue, we have in stock many thousands of » useful 8vo Portraits, as well as a vast number of Topographical Views. A feature not to be overlooked is the number of characteristic portraits of modern notabilities issued as cartoons by \" Vanity Fair,\" and not to be found in any other form. Many of these are out of print, and will become increasingly difficult to obtain. We solicit correspondence from collectors in respect to any portraits required and not mentioned in the following pages, fresh purchases being added to the stock daily.
