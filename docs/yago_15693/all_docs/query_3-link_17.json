        "text": "The Kingdom of Bavaria was abolished in 1918. The current head of its formerly ruling House of Wittelsbach is Franz, Duke of Bavaria.\n\nThe succession is determined by Article 2 of Title 2 of the 1818 Constitution of the Kingdom of Bavaria, which states, \"The crown is hereditary among the male descendants of the royal house according to the law of primogeniture and the agnatic lineal succession.\"[1] The succession is further clarified by Title 5 of the Bavarian Royal Family Statute of 1819.[2]\n\nIn 1948 and 1949 Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria, with the agreement of the other members of the house, amended the house laws to allow the succession of the sons of princes who had married into comital houses.[3] In 1999 Duke Franz, with the agreement of the other members of the house, amended the house laws further to allow the succession of the sons of any princes who married with the permission of the head of the house.[Citation needed]\n\nFranz has never married. The heir presumptive to the headship of the House of Wittelsbach is his brother Prince Max, Duke in Bavaria. Because Max has five daughters but no sons, he is followed in the line of succession by his and Franz's first cousin (and second cousin in the male line) Prince Luitpold.[4]"
