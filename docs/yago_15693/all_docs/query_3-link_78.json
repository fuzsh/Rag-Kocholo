        "text": "Chapter 729: Bahama Mama\n\nThe Bahamas served as a base and airstrip for the United States Navy at George Town on Great Exuma, thanks to the Destroyers for Bases Agreement of 1940. Some Bahamians also enlisted in the Caribbean Regiment and other British Units. The Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII was installed as the Governor of the Bahamas in August 1940. As it was widely believed that the Duke and Duchess sympathized with fascist monarchism before and during the war, and were moved to the Bahamas to minimise their opportunities to act on those feelings in England and be of purpose to the Axis Central Powers. The Duke was praised for his efforts to combat poverty on the islands, although he was as contemptuous of the Bahamians as he was of most non-white peoples of the Empire. He was also praised for his resolution of civil unrest over low wages in Nassau in June 1942, when there was a \"full-scale riot\", even though he blamed the trouble on \"mischief makers – communists\" and \"men of Central European Jewish descent\". In April 1942 the United Kingdom asked Canada to provide military support in Nassau, in part to protect the Duke. A company of the Veterans Guard of Canada therefore served in the Bahamas, followed by a company of the Pictou Highlanders. The Canadian garrison left Nassau in 1946 after the Duke resigned from his Post. Further more the Bahamas served as a important allied base against German, Italian, Royal French and Spanish Merchant Raiders and submarines during the Battle of the Atlantic and the Battle of the Caribbean that was a part of that naval campaign. On side of the Allies the Americans, British and Free French did everything they could to prevent the Axis Central Powers from intercepting their trade and gain basis in the Caribbean. The Axis Central Powers had hoped to disrupt the Allied supply of oil and other materials by sinking shipping in the Carribean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, alongside attacks on coastal targets in the Antilles and along the United States Coast. Because of this dangerous threat the Allies increased their anti-submarine warfare in the region, to drive out the Axis Central Powers ships and submarines as fast as they could.\n\nThis naval raids and the attempt of the Germans, Fascist French and Spanish to establish their own bases on some of the Caribbean Islands lead to extensive air recon missions in the area and lead to the stationing of more police, local militia and regular Allied soldiers as garrisons along many ports, towns and cities in the area in fear of a Axis Central Power invasion and landing to establish bases closer to the United States and North America after a German transport convoy escorted by some Axis Central Powers ships and a airship that served as a aircraft carrier (one of the German Zeppelin Carriers, the Theoderich) had been engaged in battle and forced back eastwards afterwards. However the incident made it clear that the Axis Central Powers had not only the intention and goal, but the overall capacities and ambitions to follow trough with these plans. Therefore the Allies own increasing garrison and patrols in the areas seamed more then justified, but truly the Axis Central Powers would never try again during the Second Great War as long as America and Britain dominated the Americas and it's coastal regions. The massive amount of resources like planes, ships, fuel and soldiers however used for this endeavor however meant that all of them could not be used in other theaters of the Second Great War, where the truly were needed like Africa, Europa, Asia and the Pacific. Still the Americans, even after the Second Great War would defend the decision, saying that the chance of Axis Central Powers being in range of American cities and heavily bombing them would have changed the American perspective of the war even earlier and because of that would have lead to a earlier defeat of the Allies as a whole the Americans claimed. Many British and Free French historians however would oppose such a statement, while the Imperial German historians would agree to this American statement, even if it was simply for the fact that it allowed for the German Empire and it's Axis Central Powers to look even more threatening then they truly were during the Second Great War and therefore would boost their prestige and status, at least that was what they believed would happen with this historic revisionism.\n\nChapter 730: The Sun Bomb\n\nWith the largest and bloodiest war in human history, the Second Great War continuing, all sides involved tested out new weapons to end the war quickly and in their favor. This also included nuclear research in hopes for a atomic bomb. Lead by physicist Yoshio Nishina and General Takeo Yasuda alongside Tatsusaburo Suzuki they were intrigued by the discovery of nuclear fission and believed it would be possible to construct an atomic weapon. Even at that early stage, uranium procurement was identified as a crucial problem. Yoshio Nishina, who had studied under Niels Bohr in Copenhagen. Nishina worked at the institute known as Riken, near Tokyo. He succeeded in building the first cyclotron outside the United States in 1937 and would complete a larger one in 1944, both with the assistance of Ernest Lawrence. The IJA officially authorized Nishina’s lab to research an atomic bomb in April 1941. The project became known as Ni-Go. Ni-Go itself had five research themes: atomic bomb theory, separation of uranium-235, production of uranium hexafluoride, measurement of physical constants, and analysis of isotopes. Nishina’s team’s initial conclusion was that an atomic bomb was theoretically, but not technically, feasible. Still they continued to pursue uranium enrichment via gaseous thermal diffusion, to create an atomic bomb. A test side and research facility was build in Konan, Chosen headed by Bunsaku Arakatsu and staffed by about 40,000 Japanese workers, of whom approximately 25,000 were trained engineers and scientists. The organization of the plant was set up so that the workers were restricted to their areas. The inner sanctum of the plant was deep in a cave. Here only 400 specialists worked. In 1943 they believed it would take Japan roughly ten years to build a functional sun bomb as they would later call it, or Genzai Bakuden (Japanese for new bomb, or modern bomb). This meant the device could not be used for defensive purposes against the United States Navy, or to bomb the United States West Coast to enforce them to accept a surrender to the Japanese demands. The main problem remained the Uranium necessary for the bomb, but by 1952 the Japanese had found desposits of Uranium in Yankoku, National Han China, western Mengjiang, western Tibetan Empire (both in central Asia) and Australia (Ōsutoraria, also Australasia, Australian South Asia, Asia Meridianam, Minamiajia the newest member of the Co-Prosperity Sphere with increasing majority numbers of Japanese settlers thanks to political, economic and military pressure that transformed it into another “Yellow” continent) as well as later Afghanistan and parts of former India. The first successful Japanese nuclear tests however would be concluded in 1944 and 1948 when they first tested the Genzai Bakudan or Sun Bomb. The observers of said test were 20 miles away. This waiting was difficult and strange to men who had worked relentlessly so long and hard on the project. Suddenly the light in the east where Japan lay grew brighter. The moment the sun peeped over the sea there was a burst of light at the anchorage blinding the observers who wore welders' glasses. The ball of fire was estimated to be 1,000 yards in diameter. A multicolored cloud of vapors boiled toward the heavens then mushroomed in the stratosphere. Amaterasu had granted Japan her sun powers. The Empire of Japan and it's Co-Prosperity Sphere would later become one of the largest nuclear superpowers of the century.\n\nKnown as the Uranproject by the Germans the German Empire started with it's own research just months after nuclear fission had been discovered in December 1938. At first many notable physicists were drafted into the Wehrmacht, but by 1942 those still alive were reordered to the project because the increasing losses on the Eastern Front and the massive American buildup in Britain and Africa. The programm was continued with the goal to build a nuclear reactor which could sustain a nuclear fission chain reaction for a significant amount of time and to achieve the complete separation of at least tiny amount of the uranium isotopes. The program eventually expanded into three main efforts: the Uranmaschine (nuclear reactor), uranium and heavy water production, and uranium isotope separation. Eventually it was assessed that nuclear fission would not contribute significantly to ending the war, and in January 1942, the Imperial High Command turned the program over to the Imperial Research Council (Reichsforschungsrat) while continuing to fund the program. The most influential people in the Uranverein were Kurt Diebner, Abraham Esau, Walther Gerlach, and Erich Schumann; Schumann was one of the most powerful and influential physicists in Germany. Diebner, throughout the life of the nuclear weapon project, had more control over nuclear fission research than did Walther Bothe, Klaus Clusius, Otto Hahn, Paul Harteck, or Werner Heisenberg. Abraham Esau was appointed as Imperial Air Admiral Hermann Göring's plenipotentiary for nuclear physics research in December 1942; Walther Gerlach succeeded him in December 1943. Imperial Air Admiral Göring believed that with such a bomb, his bombers and missiles could easily and quickly end the war for the German Empire. By then the politicization of the German academia under the National Socialist regime had driven many physicists, engineers, and mathematicians out of Germany as early as 1933. Those of Jewish heritage who did not leave were quickly purged from German institutions, further thinning the ranks of academia. The politicization of the universities, along with the demands for manpower by the German armed forces (many scientists and technical personnel were conscripted, despite possessing useful skills), substantially reduced the number of able German physicists. Later in 1942 some were allowed to return but even those who by then wished to return to Germany from foreign exile (and had not already done so) were unable to because of the Second Great War. Another problem for the German Empire was that they had only a limited supply of Uranium at first, that used for their bomb tests of the Heisenberg Device/ Uranbombe in 1946 had been mined in Belgian Congo and it's ore in Belgium fell into German hands after the invasion and occupation of the region in 1940. After the Second Great War the main Uranium used by the German Empire would come from Mittelafrica (northern in the Niger region as well as from German Congo and former German Southwest Africa) as well as mines in Saxony and Silesia, Bulgaria and Romania (were Austria-Hungary also tried to gain Uranium for their own program later on) alongside other mines in the Russian Empire (near the Baltic Duchy) and the Ottoman Empire (Central Asia). The later two however also tried to use these mines for their own ambitions of political and military power. Germany soon lead the nuclear race thanks to their research of SRBM (Short Range Ballistic Missiles) and the SLBM (Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles) of the A4/V2 program they had tested during the Second Great War (A4 to A8), that in theory allowed them to reach large parts of the world (especially Europe, North America, Africa and western Eurasia). Began in 1940 and finished in 1944 the German Empire also had the first ICBM (Inter Continental Ballistic Missiles) with the A9 and the A10 at the End of the Second Great War. Also called the Amerika Rakete (America Rocket), the A10 was later increased in the 1950ies and 1960ies to create the A11 and A12 as the Japan Rakete (Japan Rockets) that would be able to reach East Asia.\n\nOther Nuclear Programs and Prijects included the Manhattan Project in America, from 1942 to 1946 were 130,000 people worked that would cost nearly US$2 billion. Over 90% of the cost was for building factories and to produce fissile material (uranium-235 and uranium-238), with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons that managed to produce the first American nuclear bomb in 1945, to late for the Second Great War that had already ended by then. United States President Thomas Edmund Dewey who had always told his generals that he would not use the bomb against Berlin, St. Petersburg or Paris because “we are not like these Huns” still allowed for the continuation of the project as he knew that if the Germans or Japanese had the device the only thing allowing for a survival of a independent and free America would be their own atomic bombs. When the Untied States divided in 1948 the nuclear bombs remaining in the Southern States created a crisis as the Confederates in Dixieland refused to give them to the north in fear of being forced to join the Union by the threat of nuclear power otherwise, creating a nuclear stalemate between both American Nations. The United Kingdom would start to rise as it's own nuclear power by 1952 thanks to American help to secure the Anglo-Allied world against the Axis Central Powers, the Co-Prosperity Sphere and other threats. They would get their uranium from the Northeastern United States and Eastern Canada.\n\nThe French Empire ever ambitious itself, would try their own attempt to gain the nuclear bomb with three tests in Imperial French Algeria in 1960; \"blue\" (Gerboise Bleu), \"white\" (Gerboise Blanche) and \"red\" (Gerboise Rouge). Similar to the Austria-Hungarian nuclear program, the German Empire tried to stop the French Imperial attempt to gain the atomic bomb too, even if France claimed it was only targeted against the Anglo-Alliance Powers and to fully regain it's own former status as a Great Power. The need to import Uranium from Germany, Ukrainia and Russia however had the French turn to the Second Ottoman Empire and also increase their ambitions to regain Quebec as a French Colony for the Franco-Canadian population and the Uranium mined there. The Soviet Union's own nuclear project would last from 1942 to 1948 perused by the NKVD, NKGB, GRU, MGB and PGU led by the Russian physicists Andrei Sakharov and Igor Kurchatov. However the balkanized fall and dissolution of the Soviet Union during the Second Great War and afterwards in the continuing Second Russian Civil War would ultimately end the project and lead to the Nuclear Siberia Crisis, when Red Army Warlords in Siberia tried to take over the nuclear facilities and force the scientists to finish the atomic bomb for them to remain independent from incoming Imperial Russian Forces, leading to Imperial German and Imperial Japanese intervention to prevent the Red Army warlords from getting the atomic bomb. It would be one of the first major international crisis between the Axis Central Powers and the Co-Prosperity Sphere.\n\nChapter 731: Co-Prosperity Sphere Inter Continental Transport Planes and Bombers\n\nBeginning in 1942 the Empire of Japan and their Co-Prosperity Sphere started the development of their long range transports and bombers, meant to supply their forces far away from supply lines and hit the enemy were he truly was vulnerable. Originally believed to be a project of the Imperial Japanese Navy, the creative minds behind the idea were in reality from the Imperial Japanese Army, who believed this way they could better supply their thinly spread forward frontlines. This way the Imperial Japanese Army hoped that the Siberian Front against the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic, as well as for the Chinese Civil War Front against the Chinese United Front and in British India against the Allies. Some time later, the Imperial Japanese Navy called for their own long range transport planes and bombers to reinforce and supply their most far away and isolated island bases, as well as to hit all of Australia, the Indian Coast and mainly the American mainland. To archive this goals, both projects were partly combined to a extent and the Tachikawa Ki-77 was planned as a long-range experimental transport and communications aircraft, a ow-wing cabin monoplane with twin piston engines and a tailwheel undercarriage. It had it's first flight on 18 October 1942 and would later on 2 June 1944 break a record, by flying circuits over a triangular route off Manchuria, landing 57 hours 9 minutes later and covering 16,435 km (10,212 mi) at an average speed of 288.2 km/h (179.1 mph), 3,499 km (2,174 mi) more than the SM.75's 12,936 km (8,038 mi) record. The Ki-77 landed with 800 liters remaining in the tanks of the 12,200 l (2,700 imp gal; 3,200 US gal) it began with, so the maximum endurance was around 18,000 km (11,000 mi).\n\nThe Ki-77's endurance record was first exceeded in October 1946 by a Lockheed P2V-1 Neptune in a flight from Perth, Australia to Columbus, Ohio in the American midwest, of over 18,083.6 km (11,236.6 mi). Both records were internationally recognized and officiated after the Second Great War. The distance record set by the Ki-77 meant that it was the perfect craft for the demands of both the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy. The two projects were known as the Ki-77 A (A for Asia) the Continental variant and Ki-77 P (P for Pacific) the Oceanic variant of the Ki-77. While both variants proved to be successful and did what they were build for, both types and other transports, bombers as well as fighter transports carrier planes all came to late to greatly influence Japans performance during the Second Great War. They would however be of massive importance later, both during the last phase of the Chinese Civil War, as well as for more civil use in connecting the vast Co-Prosperity Sphere in terms of civil transportation and also the transportation of goods and resources. While this meant civil and military transports of people, goods, equipment and resources overall in East Asia and Southeast Asia in the Pacific Region this mainly included the supply of military bases, as well as the founding and supply of new plantations, mines and nearby cities for the people working their and their families that came to said areas as colonists. The majority of Japanese and other Co-Prosperity Sphere colonists and settlers however still came per ship, no matter if they settled in mainland Asia, the Southeast Asian and Pacific Islands, or the West Coast of North America and South America. This way the Ki-77 and other planes developed under the project, while not serving to help in Japan's victory in the Second Great War, they would play a important role to secure the conquered and liberated territories and therefore the power the Japanese Empire and the Co-Prosperity Sphere had gained during the Second Great War. This way the Inter Continental Transport Planes and Bombers of the Japanese Empire played a vital role in securing and strengthening the overall Japanese position in Asia and the Pacific.\n\nChapter 732: The Barbarian Peninsuala\n\nDuring the Second Great War the Second Ottoman Empire started a campaign of resettling and ethnic cleansing again, mostly targeted against minority groups like Armenian and Kurd's that they had already mistrusted during the First Great War. Many of them were simply resettled into other regions outside the core Ottoman Empire into puppet, vassal and buffer states in the Caucasian Region. Others however like the Arabs who had so deeply betrayed their Ottoman Masters and Mohammedan Brothers during the First Great War (according to the Ottoman's own view on history) were seen as traitors to the Ottoman Sultanate and the later Ottoman Caliphate. Therefore they were forcefully resettled down south by the Ottomans and put into internment and concentration camps for said purpose, before being forcefully resettled, others simply fled from the Ottoman Armies south on their own. As the Second Ottoman Empire was greatly overburdened with the task of feeding and supplying so much people many died from starvation or because of the bad hygiene in these camps. The fact that the Ottomans did not ask for German Army help and couldn't care less if these Arabs were dying in their camps or resettled during or after the war did not truly help the overall situation. More then ironic and macabre was in this context the fact that the Ottoman Leadership called the Arabian Peninsula the Barbarian Peninsula during the Second Great War and portrayed the royal Saudi Dynasty and the Arab Kingdom as a primitive, savage tribe of desert nomads. One of the main reasons for this harsh treatment and the Ottoman hate was clearly the fact that the Saudi's had gained riches thanks to the oil and that they controlled Mecca, the holy city of all Mohammedans. Something the Ottoman Empire could not accept if their own Sultanate and their claim to the Caliphate rule over all Mohammedans should ever be secured. The main oil region of Saudi Arabia was discovered in 1938 in the Al-Hasa region along the Persian Gulf coast. Prior to the discovery of oil, the main source of income for the government depended on the pilgrimage to Mecca, which was around 100,000 people per year in the late 1920s.\n\nIn the 1930s, Abdul Aziz granted an economic concession to the Standard Oil Company of California to drill for oil in his kingdom, after oil was found in nearby Bahrain in 1932. Oil wells were constructed in Dhahran in the late 1930s, and by 1939, the kingdom began to export oil. During and the Second great War, production of Saudi oil expanded, with much of the oil being sold to the Allies. Aramco (the Arabian American Oil Company) built an underwater pipeline to Bahrain to help increase oil flow in 1944. However with the Second Ottoman Empire taking over the region this riches soon would flow into the Sultans/ Caliphs pockets, helping him stabilize his multi-ethnic mohammedan ottoman ruled nation state the best way money allowed. From 1939 to 1949 oil revenues from the Peninsula increased from $7 million to over $240 million, and the Ottoman Empire began to greatly dependent economically on oil income. Saudi Arabia itself had severed diplomatic contacts with Germany at the start of the Second Great War in Europe, and with Japan in 1941. Although officially neutral, the Saudis provided the Allies with large supplies of oil. Dhahran was bombed by Italian planes in October 1940, targeting the oil refineries and continued Axis Central Power raids on the Saudi oil refineries and pipelines would continue throughout the Second Great War. Diplomatic relations with the United States were established in 1943. King Abdul Aziz Al-Saud was a personal friend of Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Americans were then allowed to build an air force base near Dhahran. While Saudi Arabia declared war on Germany, the Ottomans (and therefore the Axis Central Powers) and Japan (as well as the Co-Prosperity Sphere), but no military actions resulted from the declaration. By 1948 oil production in the newly renamed Ottoman Peninsula (or Turkish Peninsula) was in full swing and the Ottoman Empire became a massive supplier of the Axis Central Powers, mainly Germany, France and Russia.\n\nChapter 733: The most modern superior Army of the Middle\n\nIn a attempt to modernize their forces the best they could the Imperial Han Chinese Government in Nanjing under Wang Jingwei the Imperial Han China Army was build up as one of the most of their time. Part of this was thanks to Chiang Wei-kuo (or Jiang Weiguo/ Wego), son of a Chinese journalist Tai Chi-tao and Kuomintang member and a Japanese woman, Shigematsu Kaneko that was the adopted son of Chiang Kai-shek. Having thrained in the Wehrmacht/ Imperial German Army during the German Coup of 1938, Wei-kuo became fascinated by the loyality the Germans had to their Emperor, their Empire and their people as a whole even if they were a young nation with much different local ethnics and groups of Germans forming it. Later Wei-kuo went to the United States, to train there as well. He learned about the use of machine-gun lead infantry forces, mountaineers, motorized and tank forces. After seeing how the Communist took more and more control of the Chinese United Front and how the Japanese had liberated Chosen, Manchuria, Yankoku, National Imperial Han China and Taikoku, Wei-kuo switched sides to the Shanghai and later Nanjing Government of Wang Jingwei and changed his name to Tai Wei-kuo in honor of his true father (he had until now claimed to be his uncle). To the Japanese however he was known as Shigematsu Hiroi. Together with Japanese advisers he helped model the new Imperial Han Chinese Army after the Imperial German, Imperial Japanese and partly the American ones. Thanks to his remodeling of this new Chinese Army under Wang Jingwei their forces were trained in incorperating machine-gun crews into their battallions and train in mountainer warfare, so they would be able to better face the Chinese United Front with their guerillia warfare against Wang's government in central China. This modernisation, as well as the use of transport trucks, trains, armored cars, armored trains and tanks meant that the Imperial Han Chinese Army was soon very well equipped to face the United Front under Chiang and Mao the best they possible could. Encouraged by the Imperial Japanese Army operating alongside them, this Imperial Han Chinese Army and Wang's Government soon begann to build the equipment and weapons they needed in China themselves.\n\nBeside this increasing equipment and weapons modeled or copied from Japanese variants, large parts of the Imperial Han Chinese Army also used German equipment, especially helmets and rifles that the Germans no longer used after the First Great War and therefore they sold large amounts of their old equipment to the Chinese and other places around the globe were nation states hoped to gain more military power by growing their own armies, or were regional conflicts and civil wars forced them to do so. This German-Japanese support and build-up of the new Imperial Han Chinese Army and the victory of the German Empire led Axis Central Powers and the Japanese Empire led Co-Prosperity Sphere during the Second Great War allowed for the Imperial Han Chinese Army to rise in fame for being one of the best trained, best equipped and most modern forces in the world. With the breakthrough and victories in the campaigns of 1943 and 1944 that would lead to Wang Jingwei winning the Chinese Civil War after the Second Great War this legacy and myth was further cemented, even if their victories were largely because of Japanese, Yankoku, Taikoku, Yikoku and Mengjian support in this fight. This legacy would even survive the split up of Imperial National Han China in a northern successor state and the new Tang Empire or Tangkoku created out of the south of the former Imperial Han Chinese State by the Buddhist General Tang Shengzhi. Most of his Imperial Tang Forces had before served, trained or learned in the Imperial Han Chinese Empire and thereby much of the same military traditions and equipment then the northern successor state on Imperial Han China too. Together they formed two of the strongest new nation states in the former Chinese Empire, even if Yankoku and Taikoku alongside Manchuria had very modernized armies with large militarized societies as well."
