        "text": "The phrase \"the Royal Family\" is a rather imprecise one which can mean different things in different situations. Here it is taken to include those who bear the princely title and their spouses, as well as the King's nephews and nieces and their spouses.\n\nThis calendar lists:\n\nthe birthdays of all living members of the Royal Family;\n\nthe marriage anniversaries of all living members of the Royal Family if their spouses are still living;\n\nthe anniversaries of the deaths of all former sovereigns and their spouses (from the personal union of England and Scotland onwards);\n\nother significant historical anniversaries.\n\nA genealogical table showing the descendants of Queen Mary IV and III may be of help in identifying those included in this calendar.\n\nSince the death of King Henry IX and I in 1807 no member of the Royal Family has publicly used his English or Scottish titles. The English and Scottish titles accorded to members of the Royal Family in this calendar are those used for them by the Jacobites.\n\nJAN - FEB - MAR - APR - MAY - JUN - JUL - AUG - SEP - OCT - NOV - DEC\n\nJanuary 1 King James III and VIII died, King Charles III ascended the throne, 1766 January 9 H.I. and R.H.
