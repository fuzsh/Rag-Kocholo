        "text": "On Friday, Maria Teresita arrived at the Hofkirche in Dresden for her wedding to a French aristocrat, Béryl-Alexandre de Saporta. The bride was escorted by her father, Alexander, who is one of two people who claims to be the head of the House of Saxony. Alexander is a great-grandson of King Friedrich August III, the last King of Saxony, through his mother, Princess Anna of Saxony.\n\nIn 1999, Alexander was adopted by his childless uncle, Prince Maria Emanuel, so that he could inherit the headship of the house, a decision that was agreed to at the time by the other dynasts of the family. Later, though, Alexander’s uncle, Albert, retracted his agreement, as did two other family members who had previously signed on. Instead, Albert decided to support the claim of a cousin, Rüdiger (who died last year). There are all sorts of questions involved in this regarding equal marriages and dynastic qualifications. Ultimately, the two men who argue that they are the Head of the House of Saxony are Alexander, father of the bride at this weekend’s wedding, and Rüdiger’s eldest son, Daniel.\n\nThis is all a family matter, of course. There hasn’t been a King of Saxony since 1918."
