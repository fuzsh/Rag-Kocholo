        "text": "Howdy. French President Emmanuel Macron’s snap election strategy appears to be evenly dividing the Brussels Playbook audience this morning, based on the results of our highly unscientific X poll. Slightly more than half of you say it’s a suicidal move, akin to David Cameron’s Brexit gambit — but a good chunk reckon he just might have outsmarted Marine Le Pen. On verra.\n\nThe inexhaustible Eddy Wax is on deck as your Playbooker for Thursday.\n\nDRIVING THE DAY: PARTIES CRASHING\n\nKNIVES OUT FOR RÉPUBLICAINS BOSS: What does it feel like to have the weight of the entire European mainstream bearing down on you? Just ask Eric Ciotti, head of French center-right party Les Républicains (LR). His embrace of a possible united front with Marine Le Pen’s National Rally infuriated not only his fellow LR members, but also other camps in the broader European People’s Party.\n\nJust a sampling: “Never, never” can an alliance with a “a populist and anti-European party be the solution,” said LR stalwart Michel Barnier, who also happens to be the EU’s former Brexit negotiator, in an X post. Barnier also said Ciotti had “lost the legitimacy” to speak for the party, and he faces heavy pressure to resign. Victor Goury-Laffont has more.\n\n**A message from Novo Nordisk: Team Novo Nordisk are racing to drive change in diabetes. Innovation has made this possible. As one race ends in the EU and another begins at the Baloise Belgium Tour today, the team aims to inspire European policy action to ensure all people with diabetes can access innovative care.**\n\nBeyond the Hexagon: An alliance with RN is “obviously incompatible” with the EPP, Thanasis Bakolas, its secretary-general, told Playbook. “But I seriously doubt [Ciotti] has his party behind him,” Bakolas hastened to add. Germany’s CDU would also move to kick LR out of the EPP if they crossed the cordon sanitaire with Le Pen, Euractiv reports.\n\nNo love lost: Granted, LR’s relationship with the broader EPP hasn’t been great, with its MEPs expected to vote against Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for a second mandate.\n\nDISSEMBLEMENT NATIONAL: Le Pen’s budding alliance with another wing of the French right, Reconquest, appears to be withering as well. Apparently there’s still a cordon around Eric Zemmour, specifically.\n\nLeft alliance also falters: While it looked like MEP Raphaël Glucksmann’s center-left Place Publique party had signed onto a left-leaning alliance (along with Greens and the leftist France Unbowed), he threw cold water on the idea Tuesday.\n\nLIBERALS FRAYING: Macron might be looking at these hapless efforts to defeat him with a satisfied chuckle — until he looks in the mirror. As Clea Caulcutt, Victor, Sarah Paillou and Pauline de Saint Remy report in this morning’s must-read, he’s increasingly seen as a loose cannon, out of touch and deluded about his own appeal. So toxic is he, his own Renaissance party doesn’t want to campaign with him. Yikes.\n\nHayer under pressure: Macron could soon see control of the Renew Group in the European Parliament slip through his fingers. Valérie Hayer, who led Macron’s list in the European election, is currently in charge of the group. But the ALDE party is agitating to replace her, Eddy Wax reports. One name he keeps hearing as a possible successor: Ex-Belgian PM Sophie Wilmès.\n\nLE PEN, SALVINI, WILDERS IN BRUSSELS: Some of Europe’s main far-right leaders, including France’s Marine Le Pen, Italy’s Matteo Salvini and the Netherlands’ Geert Wilders will descend on Brussels today for a hush-hush meeting to chew over the election results and the future of their Identity & Democracy group in the European Parliament, five sources tell Eddy and our Berlin Playbook colleague Pauline von Pezold.\n\nAfD wants back in: The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which was kicked out of ID, has not been invited. But according to a source close to the AfD, Austria’s Freedom Party will advocate for the German party to be allowed to rejoin the group, with some in ID arguing the AfD had done enough by excluding troublemaker-in-chief Maximilian Krah from its ranks. It will largely be up to Le Pen to decide.\n\nSpeaking of Wilders: The four parties negotiating to form a Dutch coalition government have reached agreement on their Cabinet ministers, Wilders said Tuesday. De Telegraaf has info on who might get which post.\n\nMEANWHILE, BACK IN BERLIN … Time is running out for Chancellor Olaf Scholz, writes my colleague Matthew Karnitschnig. While all eyes are on the snap French election, Germans too may soon face an early vote, after Scholz’s Social Democrats were beaten into a humiliating third place by the AfD. “The fact is the coalition government has been voted out, and Olaf Scholz must call for new elections like Macron,” said Bavaria’s premier, Markus Söder.\n\nTOP JOBS\n\nMERRILY WE FLOAT ALONG: Despite all the chaos described above, the ritual of doling out Brussels leadership posts amongst the political families looks smoother than ever. It’s almost as though the weekend’s election was totally irrelevant to the process …\n\nFamiliar shortlist: The names being floated for the EU’s most important jobs are the ones you’ve been hearing all along. Thanks to extensive reporting from Barbara Moens, Aitor Hernández-Morales, Jacopo Barigazzi and Eddy, here’s the crystallized list, with your Playbooker’s ratings for the suspense factor, out of four drumrolls.\n\nCommission president … 1 drumroll … Ursula von der Leyen, EPP, Germany\n\nCouncil president … 2 drumrolls … António Costa, Socialists, Portugal\n\nParliament president … zero drumrolls, utter silence … Roberta Metsola, EPP, Malta\n\nForeign policy chief … 3 drumrolls … Kaja Kallas, Renew, Estonia\n\nRead the rationale and caveats here.\n\nDIPLOMATS RESCUE MICHEL FROM ‘DINNERGATE’: European Council President Charles Michel’s attempt to shut his Commission counterpart out of a key top job discussion did not go over well with capitals, Barbara Moens hears.\n\nICYMI: Michel had been plotting to keep Ursula von der Leyen off the guest list for the June 17 dinner with EU leaders, the first post-election gathering of the EUCO.\n\n‘Unanimous’: At a meeting of European ambassadors on Tuesday, the envoys made clear that they expect von der Leyen to be invited — the opinion was “unanimous,” as one diplomat put it.\n\nApéro only: That said, since one of the top jobs that leaders are discussing is, well, hers, von der Leyen will likely be expected to excuse herself before leaders get down to the meat-and-potatoes of negotiations.\n\nFIGURATIVELY DRIVING THE DAY: ELECTRIC VEHICLES\n\nBRUSSELS TO BRAKE (HARD) ON CHINESE EVs: The big day when the European Commission is set to announce provisional duties on Chinese electric vehicles producers is upon us.\n\nIt won’t land well in Berlin: Germany has launched an 11th-hour bid to avert a full-scale trade war between Europe and China, resisting French calls to hit Chinese electric vehicles with punitive duties. Both Paris and Berlin have ramped up their lobbying efforts — with conflicting messages on just how tough Brussels should get on Beijing.\n\nTimeline: The EU executive is expected to inform Chinese EV-makers today of temporary duties resulting from its probe into unfair state subsidies. EU member countries would then vote this fall to confirm the duties — making it vital for von der Leyen to pitch them at a level that the bloc’s two heavyweights can live with.\n\nWhat Berlin wants: The EU now charges a 10 percent tariff on all car imports — below China’s 15 percent. Realizing that it won’t be able to avert the tariffs, Berlin is now pushing to keep them as low as possible, ideally on a reciprocal level that China also imposes on the EU — meaning 15 percent.\n\nWhat Paris wants: France lobbied hard for the probe, which was announced by von der Leyen in her set-piece annual address last fall. And, despite Beijing’s threat to hit back at French cognac makers in an anti-dumping investigation, Paris wants much higher duties on Chinese EVs.\n\nRead POLITICO’s tour-de-force reportage on the Franco-German face-off here.\n\nNOT DRIVING THE DAY (BUT MAYBE SHOULD HAVE BEEN)\n\nWHAT’S NOT ON THE AGENDA AT COREPER: Sometimes the news is what’s left unsaid, Barbara Moens writes in to report as EU ambassadors meet this morning.\n\nNot on today’s agenda 1: The Belgian presidency has postponed a discussion on accession talks for Ukraine and Moldova, given lack of headway on Hungary’s objections on the draft negotiating framework. The Belgians will make another attempt next week amid a looming June 25 deadline, on which the EU hopes to formally kick off the negotiations with the two countries.\n\nNot on today’s agenda 2: EU countries have not yet received the text of the strategic agenda from Council chief Charles Michel, which ambassadors were set to discuss today. The strategic agenda lays out the priorities from EU leaders to the next European Commission.\n\n**Please complete this quick survey to help us understand the political and policy issues you most care about and how you use this information professionally.

It’s a reasonable ask — but an awkward one for an EU institution whose raison d’être is increasingly in doubt. Even more awkward: the plan to hike the pay for Zooming in.\n\nWhat even is the EESC? It’s a full-fledged, Treaty-defined EU institution made up of civil society, trade unions and employers, set up to weigh in on Brussels’ plans. Lawmakers have increasingly questioned whether its worth the budget of more than €150 million annually. (Read my colleague Hans von der Burchard’s seminal reporting on the EESC from 2020.)\n\nMeetings meetings meetings: Members aren’t paid, but they do get allowances for attending meetings. Arguing that this allowance hadn’t been increased since 2013, EESC President Oliver Röpke asked the Council for an adjustment last year — arguing that real costs have gone up by around 23 percent over a decade. The Belgian presidency is now proposing increasing the allowance for attending in-person meetings from €290 to €367, according to Council documents viewed by Playbook.\n\nCovid cost-savings: During the pandemic, members met virtually and everyone agreed that the teleconferences should become a permanent thing. Members still get an allowance for Zooming in: €145. That’s set to be increased to €149.\n\nRefusing to rubber stamp: Austria, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden will abstain from the proposed raise, the countries said in a joint statement. They cite the “already considerable” payouts and an agreement not to increase non-salary spending by more than 2 percent. Finance ministers are nonetheless expected to greenlight the measure on June 21.\n\nLobby subsidy? On the one hand, EESC members don’t get paid a salary. On the other hand, lobbying and advocacy is, in many cases, part of their day jobs, and meetings are held during business hours.\n\nALSO COSTING THE EU TAXPAYER: The European Commission often trumpets that its massive antitrust fines feed into the EU budget, potentially cushioning the burden on taxpayers. A Tuesday court ruling raised the prospect of this going the other way around when officials were ordered to pay Deutsche Telekom an extra €1.8 million in punitive interest on top of a penalty they had to return after a (partly) successful appeal.\n\nBallooning bill: Deutsche Telekom is just the start of a longer line of headaches for the EU executive; companies sought more than €750 million in interest last year. Fortunately for the Commission, it can rewrite the EU’s reimbursement rules, and it’s in the process of doing just that. But the changes won’t enter into force until later this year.

France and Germany reject the U.S. proposal for Europe to act as guarantor for the loan, report Gregorio Sorgi and Jakob Hanke Vela.\n\nFear and loathing in Europe: There’s palpable anger about the U.S. plan, which the Europeans argue would put them on the hook to pay the loan back if anything goes wrong ― while American companies would reap most of the benefits from Ukraine’s reconstruction contracts. “We might be stupid but we’re not that stupid,” said one senior European diplomat.\n\nTrump looms large: But negotiators are running out of time, not just because Ukraine desperately needs the money, but because there’s no certainty that a Donald Trump presidency would back the initiative.\n\n**French President Emmanuel Macron’s unexpected snap election announcement follows a crushing defeat to the far-right National Rally, potentially paving the way for Jordan Bardella to become France’s youngest prime minister.

One in three people living with diabetes are undiagnosed [2]. 35% show signs of complication at diagnosis [3]. Once diagnosed, approximately 50% of people with diabetes are not achieving their blood glucose targets [4], leaving them at increased risk of diabetes-related complications – including cardiovascular disease [5] and chronic kidney disease [6]. All of this has an enormous impact on every element of people’s lives. But it doesn’t have to be that way. With every race, Team Novo Nordisk aims to inspire people with diabetes to demand better care, improve education and reduce stigma about the disease and drive policy action to change the world for the better. It’s time for Europe to lead the pack on health innovation to make sure people with diabetes have access to the innovative care they deserve.
