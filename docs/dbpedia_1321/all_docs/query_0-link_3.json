        "text": "Zoya I. Ivanova is the author of a number of monographs and scientific articles on immunogenetics of the native Yakutian cattle and works for its preservation and study of the gene pool on the level of DNA. She taught genetics 20 years at the University and the Agricultural Academy of the Sakha Republic (Russia). For 20 years she lives on two continents - a citizen of the world, in love with her Homeland - Sakha and her new Home - America. She wrote and published two non-fictional book about the genetic history, ancient Faith and culture of the Sakha people; both books contains stores told by author's mother about the life of the Sakha family during Revolution, WWII and GULAG times. Her book \"Sarga - megalith of the Sakha people\" was published in 2013 in two languages and received the interest of the readers and is acquired by several libraries, including of Princeton University, USA. The same book in English entitled \"Sakha's Sarga, Totem Pole and Stone Age Megalith are from One Family\" was published in 2015 and now available in Amazon Kindle. According to the rating of the BookAuthority the book is one of the best about the Neolithic Age and listed as the book everyone should read at least once in their lifetime. The book “Progenitor of the Sakha people - ANE - Ancient Northasian Europoid” touching the pain points of Eurocentric interpretations of the scientific facts, aims racism, fights for the unity of all mankind. that indigenous peoples themselves should carefully study there own history, \"filtering\" and carefully rechecking Eurocentric interpretation of the scientific data, I can attest to the experience of my own life, which began on the shores of the Arctic Ocean, and then continued in mining town Sangar, right by the great expanse of the Lena river, then at the university and academic centers of Yakutsk, Moscow, Novosibirsk and Seattle. From the little barefoot Sakha girl, running on the coal dumps of the former gulag, to research scientist working on the super-modern genetic analyzer at the University of Washington. Indigenous peoples, in fact, must rise to educate themselves and get the best education, to rediscovery the trues about their own history, their dignity and serve the betterment of the world, as well as the healing of indigenous peoples from the effects of the discrimination and racism. The recent genome-wide study of the international teams of the paleogeneticists almost cleared those curtains that prevented me to see a more accurate picture of the genetic history of the Sakha people from the Paleolithic to the Iron Age. The name of my new book is “Progenitor of the Sakha people - ANE - Ancient Northasian Europoid”. The abbreviation ANE is used as the name of an ancestral component related genetic line of mammoth hunters from the archeological culture Mal’ta-Buret’ near Lake Baikal of North Asia. Paleogenetics decipher abbreviation ANE bit different than me; they call the ancestral genetic component of all people living in Eurasia - Ancient North Eurasian or ancient northern Eurasian. I reinterpret this abbreviation \"ANE\" as Ancient Northasian Europoid\" not by accident. The scientific fact that Paleolithic and Mesolithic Europeans have no relation to Paleolithic hunters on the mammoths, living on Baikal’s archaeological site Mal’ta-Buret’ \"induced\" it to me to do. Europeans did not cross throughout of Eurasia in the Paleolithic time from the west to the east and did not discover America, according to claims of the Eurocentric Solutrean hypothesis. Recent full-genomic research hammered the last nail into \"coffin\" of this hypothesis. Modern Europeans received so-called “European-like” features from northern Asians when riders-nomads of the Eurasian steppes began to expand to Europe since the Neolithic era and in a Bronze Age replaced with their genetic lines 90% Paleolithic gene pool of Britain and 50% of the Central Europe. Relying on full-genomic researches of ancient DNA, across all Northern, East, Southern Asia, and also Glacial and Neolithic Europe, I justify the origin of the Sakha people, all Eurasians and native American peoples from a common protomorphic North Asian Ancestor who lived in Altay, Lena River’s and Baikalia’s valleys, since a Paleolithic time. In my book I give my own definition to the terms \"Mongoloid\" and \"Europeoid. The book offers a non-racial vision of the ethnogenesis of all people in the Earth. My hypothesis lean mainly on the recent 2015-2019 paleo-DNA researches and I include to my new book the second part of my mother’s stories and they are from time around WWII. Also I included some stories from my childhood. Right now I am translating my new book in English language. Thank you for your interest!\n\nRead full bio"
