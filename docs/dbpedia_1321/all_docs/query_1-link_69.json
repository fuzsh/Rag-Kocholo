        "text": "Music, and especially song, have been the means by which Sakha communities in northeastern Siberia have interacted with their environment over the centuries. And this environment has incorporated an enormous pantheon of deities, area spirits, ancestors, ghosts, and demons, particularly in the years before Soviet-era modernisation began in earnest. These entities and their relationships with Sakha communities were and are voiced through sung Olongkho epics, algys prayers, chabyrghakh chants, and Ohuokhai choral dances. Sakha men and women praised or petitioned deities and spirits through these musical genres. However, modernisation and urbanisation have radically changed Sakha peoples' relationships with their environment, in transformations replicated throughout the Circumpolar North. During the mid-twentieth century, Sakha people moved fi rst into Russian-style villages and then urban settlements-and in particular to Yakutsk, their Republic's capital. Modernised farming and industry have taken root in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), bringing their associated environmental challenges. And with modernisation and urbanisation have come a plethora of new musical genres, often emerging out of the adaptation of mainstream Russian or global musical forms. Soviet-era Estrada music has given way to Sakha-language rap, pop, and rock. In this chapter, we chart the Sakha people's changing interrelation with their environment, through a history of twentieth-and twenty-fi rst-century popular music. In doing so, we show how Sakha people have incorporated music into the articulation of new identities and relationships, in addition to ways of combating the negative impact of modernising change.\n\nPart of a Special Issue on Ethnomusicology edited by Valentina Süzükei. This article explores some of the relationships between ideology, aesthetics, circulation, and agency in productions of “traditional music” and “world music” made by musicians from Tuva, a Turkic-speaking republic in Inner Asia that is now a part of the Russian Federation. This article contends that the conditions surrounding the dissolution of state socialism in the former Soviet Union laid the groundwork for the meaning and value of culture and identity in post-Soviet Tuva, including traditional music, to be renegotiated. The intentions of actors and interest groups involved in renegotiating the aesthetics of Tuva’s traditional music were diverse and not always consistent. Nonetheless, their efforts in combination had the effect of rejecting Soviet state-sponsored folkloric models as overly mediated and embracing global music industry models as more representative of “authentic” Tuvan musical practices. Neoliberal “branding” of xöömei throat-singing and Tuvan traditional music within the world music industries produced new forms of meaning and value for Tuvan people in the post-Soviet era. It also gave legitimacy to local projects of postcolonial historiography and precipitated a reevaluation of indigenous culture, language, and identity. This article traces and attempts to disentangle the work of some of the agents who were instrumental in shaping Tuvan musical aesthetics during the 1980s and 1990s, which are foundational to understanding Tuva’s contemporary music scenes based in the republic’s capital city of Kyzyl.\n\nThis paper explores the spiritual geography of the Upper Kolyma region, Sakha Republic (Yakutia), Russia through the songs of shamans and others recorded in the field by the author at the turn of the 21st century. The historic near-extinction of the Yukaghir, demographically one of the smallest of the “Small Peoples of the North,” contrasts with their adaptation and perseverance through the Soviet era. The role of the Yukaghir shaman suggests a spiritual parallel to the secular authority of the state. The masters of the earth—local animal and nature spirits—perform surveillance and act as informants, telling the shaman about the people and their activities while acting as guardians and enforcers. Shamans communicate with their spirits by means of sounds, musically mediating between the worlds of nature and supernature. But the source of the Yukaghir shaman's power is ecological, residing in sacred elements of the environment beyond the reach of bureaucrats and apparatchiks. Like the people themselves, the spirits belong to the land and are thus inalienable. In their magical otherness, shamans acted as historical conduits for resistance and provided a secret counternarrative to Soviet domination. The militant wave of atheism following collectivization brought public ceremonies to a halt. Despite the fierce anti-shaman repression campaigns, well-known Sakha (Yakut) singers preserved sacred vocal knowledge in the north by performing and recording as secular folk artists. Shamans' songs were also presenced in outbreaks of involuntary singing diseases which periodically swept through the native settlements, triggered in part by the imposing presence of Russian authorities. The psychopathology and behaviors of these echolalic nervous afflictions are documented in rare eyewitness accounts by a Soviet doctor in Kolyma during the 1920s, and in contemporary oral testimony from the author's field research. Soviet medical policies focused on collectivization and re-education as therapeutic tools to cure the singing diseases linked in native consciousness to ancestor spirits haunting and inhabiting the landscape. In the acoustemology of place, certain forest zones thick with trees are known as deep or \"deaf\" taiga. Sounds are muted in such densely wooded areas; their deathly silence is a source of fear in the popular imaginary. Because of their remoteness, they became sites of prisons and death camps in the Stalinist gulag. Songs rooted in historic Russian melodies tell of doomed souls and the return of the dead encountered in these far-off places. In later Yukaghir songs the stark landscape serves as a metaphor of love and loss, geopoetically marking the spatial and temporal distance between souls through lyrical images of distance and longing. The members of what Nikolai Vakhtin has called the \"rupture generation\" suffered the erasures of tradition and identity, undergoing the displacements of collectivization, purges, famine, and war. Through these deeply personal songs resonating with the collective memory of deprivation and persecution, the narratives of their experiences survived the Soviet epoch. At once autobiographical and rooted in folkloric motifs, they incorporate distinct influences from Russian, Sakha (Yakut), Tunguso-Manchurian, and ancient Kolymian tales and melodies in a fluid style unique to the region. The presentation includes excerpts and analysis of melodies and texts, recorded in the field by the author, showing how spiritual power was encoded in music to modulate secular Soviet authority.\n\nThe present collection examines the ways Indigenous peoples across the Eurasian North—Sámi, Nenets, Khanty, and Tyva—deal with the past and how their conceptualizations of the past are entangled with dominant ideologies in Russia and Finland, human-environment relations, and the colonial experiences they went through. The authors operate with the notion of historicity, which is understood in François Hartog’s terms as a 'temporal experience'. In the present collection, we expand this notion towards a relational nature of 'temporal experiences' where 'their' and 'our' historicities are not necessarily 'the same' or culturally determined but have been situated in long-term peaceful and conflictual encounters. Through those encounters, the diversity of meanings of the past has been shaped and developed within and between local communities and communities of scholars. The collection comprises the work of scholars from Folklore studies, Ethnology, Cultural studies, and History, who analyse Indigenous historicities through deep archival and field research."
