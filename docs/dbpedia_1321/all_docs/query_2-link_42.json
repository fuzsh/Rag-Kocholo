        "text": "R & R under the cut!\n\nDesign Critique:\n\nFirst of: she looks like she needs several dozen hugs. I am more than happy to provide some of them. Second of all, here hair is Aranea’s.\n\nAnd looking further I find it kinda apparent you just used a base sheet not as a base, but rather as a copy paste resource. That’s pretty bad form. While it’s fine if you just want to be able to point out her “general look” to friends, you shouldn’t have it be her “official” sprite. I’m just gonna give you a few general pieces of advice about her sprites though:\n\nOn her default sprite, the shirt is too short which makes it look very out of place. The symbol also needs a black outline of at least one pixel, and could use some refining. I’m also not too sure what it is.\n\nHer Rose pallet swap dress is mostly good colour scheme wise, but the red straps and dull purple rope don’t work together I’d advise changing the rope to red as the purple isn’t that visible.\n\nThe angle dress-thing / Kanaya recolour has a really nice colour scheme though. So nice.\n\nThis here is Zoya Ivanova.\n\nIs she Ukrainian, please be Ukrainian ;-;\n\nSorry about the multitude of sprites, the extra outfits and the angel corruption were me experimenting.\n\nI do have an explanation for the angel one, though.\n\nAnyway, back to this kid.\n\nZoya is fifteen and, if it wasn’t obvious by her name, Russian. Her family had decided to move not long after she was born (around the time of the dissolution of the Soviet Union). However, when Zoya was about six they decided that they really disliked the US, and they moved back– her parents did, at least. Her sister, who was old enough to live on her own by then, didn’t want to go and left her in custody of the younger sibling in a fairly-large home in Temple, Texas.\n\nSo close…\n\nIf she ends up playing SBURB you’ll have to reconsider this. Because of how ectobiology works, I can’t see this famliy working unless she was adopted. Which leads the question of where her ectoparents are.\n\nShe was homeschooled for the next few years, meaning that she still kept a thick Russian accent, and still had trouble speaking English. She’d also been raised on her home country’s culture and folklore.\n\nShe also happens to have a Samoyed named Shchenka. She was young and had no idea what to call the dog besides Puppy, and the name just happened to stick.\n\nHeh heh. That’s pretty adorable.\n\nOf course, most people care more about the “playing Sburb” part.\n\nSee above on ectoshenanagins\n\nHer chumhandle is cheerfulCynic, although she changed it to clockworkClairvoyant once she figured out her mythological role, as she thought it fit better. If it weren’t obvious already, she’s the Seer of Time. Her typing colour is a purplish-blue (with the hexcode being… #98aed9, I think?), and, of course, her eyes are the same colour.\n\nChanging chumhandles is pretty rar[e, and most charcters seem not too care too much about their actual titles. I’d personally stick with cheerfulCynic the whole way through.\n\nOn the left here is the colour you mentioned, which is pretty drab. While you could stay with it, keep in mind that making it more saturated and/or lighter, like on the right, is a possibility.\n\nHer typing quirk gets a bit complicated, though. Despite writing in English, she uses Russian grammar rules (capitalising “you” but not “I,” not capitalising anything after the second word in holidays and such (like “Christmas eve”), using double negatives, no contractions, etc). Occasionally, she throws in Russian words if she can’t think of the English equivalent, and she uses bracket-only smileys (the Russians I’ve conversed with online have used “)” instead of “:)” before, so I’m basing that off them.\n\nSeems good. Remember that humans don't have quirks, they just have general typing styles that aren’t strict rules.\n\nHer symbol, as you could hopefully tell, is a water droplet. Yeah…a black outline would help here.\n\nIn Russian folklore, water is the most revered element. Up until the nineteenth century, people would make sacrifices to the “living water,” also known as springs. Her world within the game is the Land of Tides and Clogans [ is this supposed to be cogs? ], relating to both the water and time themes.\n\nI really like that. The whole rhythmic water combined with mechanical time keepers dealio.\n\nHer strife specibi are Bookkind (after all, Crime and Punishment is fairly thick), Woodwindkind (she’s fairly average at the flute), and Bladekind (she tends to use Szablas and Shashkas).\n\nWoah woah woah holy avalanche of strifekinds batman!\n\nI’d advise sticking to just BOOKKIND here, as WOODWINDS seem hardly an instrument of mass destruction, and the BLADEKIND is pretty out of no where.\n\nHer fetch modus is the Sketch Modus. Like Jade’s Pictionary Modus, she has to draw a basic sketch of the item. If she makes a mistake, a random item (sometimes multiple) get thrown out.\n\nMeh.\n\nLater, she changed to the Chess Modus. Each item was assigned to a piece, and to get a certain item, they have to capture a certain piece. However, the modus is playing against her; if it captures one of her pieces, the item is forcefully ejected. If her king is captured, all items go flying.\n\nNow this I like! I’d stick with the CHESSMODUS and toss the SKETCHMODUS. This one’s pretty unique and I really like the idea behind it. Has tonnes of potential.\n\nThe denizen of her land, if I’m allowed to use canon, is Hephaestus. If not, it’s Koschei the Deathless. His soul is kept in a needle, in an egg, in a duck, in a hare, in an iron chest, buried under a green oak tree, on an island in the middle of nowhere. If you possess the needle, you have control over him.\n\nDenzins seem to be aspect based, so her having Hephaestus makes the most sense.\n\nHer guardian, obviously is her sister, Anna Ivanova, although she tends to call her Sestra/Ses.\n\nGuardians tend not to have revealed names in the universe where they are the guardian. Bro =/= Dirk and all that. You could probably just make her SIS her full out guardian and drop the parent part.\n\nAngel corruption is based off the Replay Value AU. Within the Underworld of every land, there are angels. Just as with the Others, they’re game abstractions, and you can be corrupted by them. Symptoms include speaking with flowery sentences, a goldish glow preaching about the Apocalypse, having a huge ego, and occasionally a halo. They tend to be drawn to those who’ve gone Grimdark, which tends to start lots of fights.\n\nI remember that thing…\n\nI know there’s more I need to add, but this is all I have for now.\n\nOver all rating: 7/10"
