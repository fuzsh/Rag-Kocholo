Her mother Svetlana Ivanova (Gurskaya before marriage) was a musician. She played piano, violin, flute and she had released a singing album, her daughter inherited her singing talent. Zoya began to learn to play piano at a young age of 6. Living in a small town of Tomsk, in Sibir, Zoya was able to develop her talent in the local music school named after Shubin. At the age of 13, Zoya and her family moved to Moscow due to the father’s promotion to the first secretary of the Perovski district committee of the CPSU ( Communist Party of the Soviet Union). Zoya went to the prestigious gymnasium #26 named after Aleksander Sergeevich Pushkin with a certificate of excellence.\n\n1937- was accepted to the Medical School in the capital of The Soviet Union, which she was not able to finish due to the beginning of World War 2.\n\nIn 1941, the first year of the war, her father went as a volunteer to the Soviet army, and on September 12, Grigoriy Ivanov had died in the military hospital due to gunshot wounds.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1945, despite her mother’s caveat, Zoya went as a volunteer to the hospital near the province of Moscow, Naberezhnye Chelny. Due to staff shortages, Zoya quickly learned medical skills and started doing surgeries. During her time working there, she has committed more than 80 life-saving surgeries and took care of about 500 patients.\n\nIn 1946, Zoya was awarded the medal of Hero of the Soviet Union ( the most prestigious rank at that time).\n\nZoya Ivanova died 4 years after, in 1950, at the age of 31, due to lung disease."
