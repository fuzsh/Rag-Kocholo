Zoya Ivanova, leader of the Eclipse Syndicate, holds the designation of an A-Rank Villain as assigned by the Super Hero Organization due to her impactful actions that directly challenged their interests. Her strategic maneuvers and influence within the Syndicate have disrupted the established order, leading to her classification as a high-profile antagonist by the governing Super Hero Organization.

After the Eclipse Syndicate collapsed (an act created by zoya and the others), she formed a gang called Legion as a front while continuing to develop the new Eclipse Syndicate.

Shackle Mastery[]

Shackle Manipulation: Zoya can materialize and control chains or ethereal shackles made of pure energy. These shackles can ensnare adversaries, restricting their movements and abilities. As Zoya's determination intensifies, these shackles become more binding and harder to break.

Shackle Transference: Zoya can transfer physical or metaphorical restraints from herself or others onto adversaries. She can absorb and redirect limitations or weaknesses represented by shackles, bestowing them upon her enemies, temporarily limiting their powers or rendering them vulnerable.

Liberation Surge: Zoya can absorb the essence of confinement and convert it into a surge of power. This energy provides her with temporary enhancements, empowering her abilities, strength, or speed, symbolizing breaking free from limitations.

Shackle Sight: Zoya possesses the unique ability to see metaphorical shackles binding individuals. This power grants her insight into their limitations or vulnerabilities, enabling her to strategize and exploit weaknesses in adversaries or offer guidance for their liberation.

Boundless Resolve: Zoya's connection to shackles grants her resilience against attempts to bind or confine her. She can resist external efforts to impose limitations on her abilities, making her incredibly resilient against constraints.

Empowering Chains: Zoya harnesses the energy of shackles to create protective barriers or constructs. These ethereal chains can form shields, barriers, or weapons, providing defense or offense to herself and her allies, symbolizing the transformation of confinement into strength.

This power symbolizes Zoya's ability to manipulate and transcend limitations represented by shackles. It transforms these symbols of confinement into sources of empowerment and strength, reflecting her resilience and determination within the Syndicate's complex landscape.
