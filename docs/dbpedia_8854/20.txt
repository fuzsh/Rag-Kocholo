Vietnam

On March 11, 1945, the Empire of Vietnam was established as an independent monarchial state under Japanese protection.[3][4] It did not include Cochinchina, as it was under Japanese military administration.[5] The Empire would see Emperor Bảo Đại serve as the last emperor of the Nguyễn Dynasty. The Empire was dissolved after Đại abdicated the throne on August 25, 1945 at the urging of Ho Chi Min himself.[6] August 25 would also give way to the de facto partition of northern Vietnam and southern Vietnam which was effectuated as the Viet Minh had the same day secured control of the north.[7][8][9] Five days later, on August 30, 1945, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which would claim authority over all of Vietnam but only exercise control in the north, was established.[10] However, a full declaration of independence would be released only on September 2, 1945.[11]

History[]

Japanese encroachment in French Indochina (officially the Indochinese Union) was gradual yet intricately-coordinated. On September 22, 1940, at the last minute, Governor-General of Indochina Jean Decoux, fearing substantial destruction were he to refuse or fail to answer, agreed to a Japanese ultimatum granting the Japanese military the right to establish military units in the colonial federation wherever it wished, and the Japanese moved in on this date. All effective French resistance was subdued by September 25, 1940.[12] Thus Japanese military establishment in northern Indochina commenced from September 22, 1940, and was later extended in parts of the southern territory on July 28, 1941.[13] The coming of March 9, 1945 ushered in outright occupation, and the Empire of Vietnam would be proclaimed as an independent kingdom (though nevertheless a Japanese protectorate) on March 11, 1945.[14] After the collapse of the Empire and Japan's own imminent collapse, Japan's policy towards the Viet Minh reversed, and they provided them with crucial weapons and military training. The Japanese were opposed to the reestablishment of the control of a Western power in Vietnam, though its occupation-era government would be forced to support it after its surrender to the Allied Powers.

Cultural relations[]

As the occupation continued, Vietnamese interest in learning the Japanese language increased, and Japanese language schools were opened in Hanoi, Huế, and Saigon.[15]
