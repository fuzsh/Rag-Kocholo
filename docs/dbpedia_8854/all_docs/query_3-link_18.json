        "text": "Resonating across our sales and trade show talks is something we have taken on with velocity: the concept of offering 𝗯𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗸𝗲 𝘃𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗮𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝘂𝘀𝗲𝘀.

The all-inclusive concept of divine space to unwind and be cared for from sunrise to sunset is emerging as a long-term trend.

Away from it all, its coastline is scattered with secret bays and the unimaginable for that overdose of the tropics. Sabah reigns somewhat supreme here. 𝗦𝗹𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘃𝗲𝗹 from Kota Kinabalu via the unparalleled landscape of the Danum Valley and ending at Semporna; seeing this scene awaiting your arrival should be ample enough to stimulate the senses and make Malaysia a top contender for a total Asian experience. Slow travel, infused with a strong sense of environmental and cultural consciousness, is the trend that is currently driving the 𝘀𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 in our beloved Borneo.

It also involves celebrating wins and showcasing the outcome of their learnings. The first edition of Kaura’s 𝗣𝗲𝗸𝗮𝗻 𝗥𝗮𝘆𝗮 𝗞𝗮𝘂𝗿𝗮 was all about community, connections, and celebrations. With a large crowd making a difference, the Kaura team smiled in abundance, and to this day, the positive impact of our collective efforts continues to reverberate across the Manggis grounds. Keen to become a part of the next one? https://hubs.ly/Q02LDjWR0 #Community #Manggis #ConsciousTravel #EducationalTravel Ni Putu Ari Sintya Dewi Peter Christiansen Ayu Kristiana\n\nConsistent education is critical for Sokhoeun Bout. His remarkable success as a guide in Cambodia is a testament to his unwavering dedication and passion for education. He has led countless clients through the captivating history and culture of his beloved country, earning their trust and admiration. His story is a remarkable and enlightened one, definitely worth sharing: https://hubs.ly/Q02JHBDy0 #GuideAcademy #WorldofDifference #Cambodia\n\nThe only way the promises of giving back to the community are fulfilled is when you consistently involve the community in whatever must be done. To let them decide the ins and outs of the intangible aspect – culture, heritage, stories, sagas, and traditions. We merely gave them our helping hand with the process of bringing visitors and the Manggis people together on the how, what, and why Kaura exists as it is now. Through our training and professional recommendations - to guarantee an income for generations to come - it is knowing that security and assurance of a more stable source of income are the cornerstones to thrive. The story of why Kaura and Manggis are a match made in Balinese heaven. https://hubs.ly/Q02J_smx0 #ConsciousTravel #CommunityBased #Manggis Cross Hotels & Resorts\n\nToo many may not be aware of what goes below the kaleidoscope of LED lights and culturally enthralling insights in the Japanese capital. Yet, it is part of our educational endeavours under the so-called STEM principles (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). Tokyo's flood prevention system is a testament to human ingenuity. It is a sophisticated network designed to mitigate the risks of tsunamis and typhoons. This vast underground infrastructure, comprising 50-meter-deep tunnels and storage chambers, is a marvel of engineering. It has been constructed to temporarily accommodate excess rainwater, thereby safeguarding the metropolis from inundation. It's happening below street level and educational from the first vertical step. More STEM ideas needed? https://hubs.ly/Q02JlGc00 #EducationalTravel #JapanTravel #WorldofDifference\n\nThe inauguration of the rail service between Bangkok and Vientiane is a significant milestone in the development of Southeast Asia's regional railway infrastructure. This new route provides a direct overland connection between the two capital cities, enhancing connectivity and reducing journey times to approximately 10 hours. The newly constructed railway segment linking Nong Khai, Thailand, to Khamsavath Station in Vientiane, will take approximately 20 minutes. Downtown Vientiane is located a further eight kilometres from the station. https://hubs.ly/Q02JHQDr0 #TrainTravel #WorldofDifference #ConsciousTravel\n\nThe Mighty Mekong is an Asian must. From cruise opportunities to watching how life unfolds and carries on for generations to admiring sunrises and sunsets from different vantage points, it’s time to think about Southeast Asia’s longest river differently. Taking a bike tour to explore the islands of the Mekong is an immersive way to see Cambodia, that is still unknown to many. Departing from Phnom Penh, this 20-kilometre leisurely ride allows one to engage with local communities, whose way of life is entirely dependent on the Mekong River. Silk farms, fruit plantations, and lush orchards are eye-openers for those who believe they have seen it all.
