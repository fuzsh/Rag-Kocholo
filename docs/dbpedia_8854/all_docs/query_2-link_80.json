As a UNESCO World Heritage Site, this ancient complex offers a glimpse into the rich history and cultural heritage of Vietnam.\n\nI spent several days here exploring the city and traipsing out to the abandoned waterpark and the incense village and these are absolute must visit spots if you’re in the area!\n\nLocated in the central part of the country, Hue was once the capital of the Nguyen Dynasty and is home to some of Vietnam’s most remarkable architectural wonders. If you’re searching for things to do in Hue, then look no further, you’ll not be bored in Hue Imperial City.\n\nYou might be interested in some of my other Vietnamese travel guides:\n\nFull guide to the Hoi An Lanterns\n\nThings to do in Da Nang\n\nWhere to stay in Da Nang\n\nBest Cafes in Hanoi\n\nHanoi Train Street: you must visit!\n\nHo Chi Minh City – Things to do\n\nThe Ha Giang Loop: Northern Vietnam\n\nHue things to do – The Imperial City\n\nFull travel guide on Hue Imperial City in Central Vietnam. If you’re looking at things to do in Hue, the forbidden purple city, or Ho Thuy Tien, the abandoned waterpark, Thuy Xuan Incense village or taking a sunset dinner cruise on Perfume River, we got it all!\n\nExplore The Hue Imperial Citadel\n\nThe Imperial City of Hue, located in the heart of the city, played a vital role as the political centre during the Nguyen Dynasty. This is a favourite of mine, it’s absolutely stunning!\n\nHue Citadel tells a fascinating story that reveals the intriguing history of modern Vietnam. Gia Long, the first emperor of the Nguyen Dynasty, established this imperial lineage through military conquests.\n\nHe took control of territories that were previously ruled by self-proclaimed emperors and local leaders from different regions. These regions, once claimed by Siam (Thailand) or Khmer (Cambodia), gradually became part of Gia Long’s united empire.\n\nThis significant event occurred in 1802, shaping the foundation of modern Vietnam and beginning the rule of the Nguyen Dynasty, which lasted for 143 years as the country’s final ruling dynasty.\n\nHo Thuy Tien, The Abandoned Water Park Hue\n\nIf you’re looking for things to do in Hue, this is probably the most iconic and impressive.\n\nExplore the weirdly eerie beauty of the abandoned water park, Ho Thuy Tien (Thùy Tiên Park). You can see why this waterpark was abandoned; all the attractions are spaced quite far apart with not a lot to do in the actual park… besides this incredible dragon you can enter!\n\nThe dragon sits on an island in the middle of Thuy Tien Lake with an entrance via some platform bridges.\n\nThis is certainly one of the most photogenic places in all of Asia.\n\nIt’s one of those cool abandoned places you need to visit; no need to worry about safety, it’s a regular spot for tourists and although there is some broken glass, as long as you’re careful it should be fine.\n\nThere are also some decaying water slides but I didn’t go on any of those; it’s a unique spot for photographers and it’s not hard to see why, right?\n\nIt’s also super popular for schools, and the national university as it’s been much featured in the news.\n\nYou will need to tip the security guard that patrols the park. In our case, he was pretty relaxed. You will need to tip anywhere between 20,000-50,000 VND. He told us to tip him 20,000 VND (around 67p or $1 USD).\n\nVisit Thuy Xuan Incense Village Hue\n\nYou must stop by Thuy Xuan Incense village of Hue City, known for as the legendary incense making village the whole village is filled with a vibrant display of coloured bamboo incense sticks. This colourful activity is iconic, and shouldn’t be left off your Hue travel guide!\n\n‘You can definitely smell it; the traditional craft includes scents of sandalwood, cinnamon, lemongrass, and more. Most villages engage in the art of incense making. The bunches of incense sticks are incredible and are made into incredible art formations.\n\nIt’s perfect for photographers and and anyone looking for something unusual to do in Hue City. It’s worth visiting these craft villages; you might be lucky enough to watch locals actually making incense too.\n\nLegend says that this is the best incense in all of Vietnam; it was said to be exceptional by the Nguyen Dynasty. It held a distinct position as the only village entrusted with supplying the fragrant frankincense to the royal court, officials of the dynasty, and the whole country. Make sure that Thuy Xuan Incense making village is on your list!\n\nPull up to Xuan Village at any time during daylight hours and there will be plenty of photo opportunities for you. They often rent traditional Vietnamese attire for you to wear (for around 50,000 Dong – £1.75 or $2USD) along with the famous conical shaped hats.\n\nThe Hue incense village is about 7km from Hue city centre (maybe a 20 minute drive) on Huyen Tran Cong Chua Street (Huyen Tran Princess) road and it’s well worth your time! We rented our own scooter, but you can take a private car, book yourself a car rental or order a Grab (Asia’s equivalent to Uber). You might be able to book onto a tour too that will take you to Thuy Xuan Village.\n\nVisit the Purple Forbidden City\n\nIf you love history, you must visit the final stronghold of Vietnam, in the centre of the Thua Thien Hue province in central Vietnam. This citadel has a 2000-year-old history filled with fascinating facts and mysterious tales that can be discovered through its artifacts and buildings. Known as the Purple Forbidden City or Tu Cam Thanh, it is a captivating testament to the past. Get ready to explore this amazing historical site in Hue, Vietnam.\n\nDuring the feudal era in Vietnam, many significant events took place, but the Nguyen Dynasty stands out for its importance.\n\nIn 1789, Nguyen Anh became the ruler and made Hue the capital city. This lasted until 1945 when the Democratic Republic of Vietnam declared independence. In 1804, Nguyen Anh ordered the construction of the Imperial City, which was a massive project involving thousands of workers. Surrounded by a 10 kilometre moat and strong brick walls, the citadel had three layers.\n\nThe outermost layer, called Kinh Thanh, was for ordinary people, while the middle layer, Hoang Thanh, held important structures and hosted important ceremonies. The innermost layer, Tu Cam Thanh or the Purple Forbidden City, was exclusively for the royal family, concubines, and servants.\n\nThe Purple Forbidden City has similarities to Beijing’s Forbidden City, but it has its own unique characteristics. Unfortunately, it suffered a lot of damage during wars, namely the conflicts with the French and the 1968 Rebellion. Today, only a few ruins, palace grounds, and pictures are left. The Vietnamese government is working hard to restore and preserve these artifacts, aiming to provide an authentic and educational experience of the citadel.\n\nA visit to the Purple Forbidden City in Hue allows you to step back in time and immerse yourself in the captivating history of Vietnam’s imperial past. As restoration efforts continue, the site offers a glimpse into a bygone era, inviting visitors to explore its remaining structures and reflect on its former magnificence.\n\nTake a Boat Ride on the Perfume River\n\nTaking a Perfume River cruise is a super popular thing to do, particularly at sunset. What makes it special is that you get to sail on a dragon boat, which used to be only something the king was allowed to sail on. These boats were originally used for royal activities like hunting, visiting tombs, or going on pilgrimages to sacred places upstream. Now, anyone can enjoy riding these boats since the Nguyen Dynasty ended. Travelers love this experience as they explore the enchanting charms of Hue on their own exciting journey.\n\nYou can do some unique tours of the city by these beautiful dragon boats, or you can take day trips from nearby places like Da Nang and Hoi An to enjoy them. The most popular trip is from the centre of Hue to the revered Thien Mu Pagoda, the oldest Buddhist temple in the area, or the other way around. It’s peaceful and refreshing sitting in the gentle breeze on the river; the days can get very hot. From this spot, you’ll witness a stunning view of the Imperial City of Hue.\n\nVisit the Tomb of Tu Duc\n\nThis tomb is the final resting place of Emperor Tu Duc, known for his poetry and philosophical writings. It was finished in 1867 and is the most famous, grand, and remarkable among the royal mausoleums. It was designed by Emperor Tu Duc himself before he passed away. The tomb cost a lot of money to build, and many people were forced to work on it, which led to a failed plot to overthrow the emperor. Tu Duc lived a luxurious life as an emperor, with 104 wives and many concubines, but he didn’t have any children. The tomb is located 5km south of Hue, on Van Nien Hill in Duong Xuan Thuong village.\n\nThe tomb is surrounded by a wall and is located on the opposite side of a small lagoon. It is a plain and unimpressive monument, and the emperor was never actually buried there. The exact location of his burial site, which also holds great treasures, remains unknown. In order to keep it hidden from grave robbers, all 200 servants were beheaded who were involved in burying Tu Duc.\n\nExplore Khai Dinh Tomb\n\nThis was an interesting tomb based simply on how deeply unpopular it was.\n\nAlthough it has the smallest area, the Khai Dinh tomb is the most effort-consuming and expensive tomb of the Nguyen Dynasty. King Khai Dinh asked the government to increase the tax to 30% nationwide to build the tomb. King Khai Dinh was severely condemned by history for his frivolous spending habits.\n\nDiscover Minh Mang Tomb\n\nAnother impressive royal tomb is Minh Mang Tomb, dedicated to Emperor Minh Mang. Wander through the huge grounds and admire the symmetry of the gardens, pavilions, and statues. This serene and picturesque setting provides a peaceful retreat from the bustling city.\n\nEntry costs around 20,000 VND. King Minh Mang, the second ruler of the Nguyen Dynasty, governed southern and central Vietnam from 1820 to 1840. He implemented an impressive construction program, which included his own funeral complex in the southwest corner of the city.\n\nExperience Local Life at Dong Ba Market\n\nThe markets in Vietnam are super diverse and they sell everything from food, to souvenirs, local crafts, produce, clothes and more. It’s 100% worth visiting a Vietnamese market and stopping for a bite or two.\n\nMy favourite thing here is the coconut ice creams, they are incredible! Be sure to barter and haggle, because it’s part of life at Dong Ba Market.\n\nLearn about the Vietnam War at the War Remnants Museum\n\nAlthough not directly related to Hue Imperial City, a visit to the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon – but yes, it IS in HUE) provides a deeper understanding of Vietnam’s turbulent past. It can be quite shocking. The museum exhibits some pretty graphic photographs and artifacts from the Vietnam War.\n\nTake a Cyclo Ride\n\nFor a unique way to explore Hue, hop on a cyclo—a traditional Vietnamese bicycle taxi. Sit back and relax as your cyclo driver takes you on a leisurely tour through the city’s streets, allowing you to appreciate the sights and sounds at a more relaxed pace.\n\nAttend a Traditional Vietnamese Theatre\n\nMake sure you see the best of Vietnamese culture by attending a traditional music and dance performance. The Hue Royal Court Music, recognized as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage, is a must-see. Experience the enchanting melodies and graceful movements that have been passed down through generations.\n\nExplore Thien Mu Pagoda\n\nLocated on the banks of the Perfume River, Thien Mu Pagoda is one of the oldest and most iconic pagodas in Hue. Marvel at its seven-tiered tower and serene surroundings, and enjoy panoramic views of the river and city. TIP: Go at sunset for some spectacular views.\n\nStreet Food Tour: enjoy Traditional Vietnamese Meals\n\nHue is known for its unique culinary delights, so don’t miss the chance to savour authentic Hue cuisine and the best way to do it is by booking a tour. You’ll get to try the famous “bun bo Hue” (spicy beef noodle soup) or indulge in other local specialties like banh khoai (Hue-style pancakes) and banh bot loc (translucent shrimp and pork dumplings).\n\nRelax with a Spa Treatment\n\nAfter days of exploring, treat yourself to a rejuvenating spa treatment in one of Hue’s wellness centers. Enjoy a traditional Vietnamese massage or immerse yourself in a herbal bath for a truly relaxing experience. There are massage parlours all over town, pick one, and treat yourself!\n\nAttend a Traditional Craft Workshop\n\nHue has a rich tradition of handicrafts, including silk weaving, conical hat making, and woodblock printing. Participate in a workshop and learn from local artisans, creating your own unique Vietnamese craft as a souvenir.\n\nExperience a Royal Dinner\n\nIndulge in a royal dining experience fit for emperors and empresses. Enjoy a sumptuous meal prepared with traditional recipes from the Nguyen Dynasty, served in an elegant setting reminiscent of the imperial era. Try a Cyclo Tour and a Dinner, or a Sunset Dinner Cruise along Perfume River.\n\nHue Imperial City is definitely the most underrated by travellers in Vietnam, skipping it for some of the bigger cities, but it really shouldn’t be missed.
