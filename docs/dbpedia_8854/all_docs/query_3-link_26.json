        "text": "The New York State Vietnam Memorial commemorates the military service of New York State residents who served their country in Southeast Asia between 1961-1975, including more than four thousand who lost their lives or were declared missing in action. Dedicated in 1984, the memorial was one of the first such state efforts in the nation. The gallery was created to serve as a “living” component of the memorial, offering exhibits, and programs intended to increase public understanding of the Vietnam War and to continually honor those who served."
