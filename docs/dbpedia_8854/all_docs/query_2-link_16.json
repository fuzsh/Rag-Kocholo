See our Privacy Policy for details.\n\nThis post was crafted with care and occasional typos by Colleen (and not AI)\n\nWe knew that Hue had an interesting history and the city was ideally located for us, sitting nicely between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh. Imperial City Hue is a UNESCO World Heritage site and highly rated as a destination, so Hue was promptly added to our Vietnam itinerary.\n\nWe opted for a walking tour of the Imperial City; read on and we’ll explain the logistics of our visit and why we think using a guide is a great idea.\n\nExploring The Citadel And The Imperial City Of Hue\n\nBefore we start, are you like me, thinking what is the Citadel, what is the Imperial City and are they different places? The answer is yes they are different (sort of) but they are both found at the same site.\n\nThe Citadel is the fortified wall that surrounds the Imperial City. The walls are 2 kilometres long in each direction, on every side of the complex and they are surrounded by a moat. Inside the Citadel (walls) you’ll find the Imperial Residence, the Imperial City and the Forbidden Purple City as well as several other buildings and spaces and what remains of administrative and military structures.\n\nThe site is very large and we recommend that you set aside half day to explore without having to rush. And accept that you’ll not see everything, but you can discover the most important sights.\n\nWhere Is The Citadel And The Imperial City in Hue?\n\nWithin the Citadel, the walled fortress, you’ll find the Imperial City and Palace complex.\n\nThe Citadel, known as Kinh Thanh Hue, is situated on the northern bank of the Perfume River in the central area of Hue city.\n\nYou enter the Imperial City is through the Noon Gate which faces the Flag Tower. You can see this flag tower across Hue.\n\nThe History Of The Imperial City In Hue\n\nThe Imperial City is a huge complex of palaces, temples, walls, gates and gardens but it’s not as old as I had originally thought. In June 1802, after more than a century of war, Nguyen Anh became Emperor and unified Vietnam. His Empire stretched from the Red River Delta in the north (now Hanoi) and the Mekong Delta in the south. The new Emperor made Hue his capital and construction began on his Citadel and Imperial City in 1803.\n\nThe complex was designed to serve as the political, cultural, and religious centre of the Nguyen Dynasty. The designs were heavily influenced by the Forbidden City in Beijing, China and incorporated both Chinese and Vietnamese architectural elements.\n\nI was surprised to learn that the last Nguyen emperor remained in residence until in 1945 when he was forced to resign by the French Colonialists. There are photos of this event inside the Pavilion above the Noon Gate.\n\nAbandoned, the buildings fell into disrepair and also suffered incredible damage during both the war of independence from the French and the Americans. Battles left many buildings in ruin and the Imperial Palace was burned.\n\nIn 1993 the entire site was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site and the buildings that remained were restored and preserved. Out of the original 160 structures that once existed only 10 remained. Since that time there has been an ongoing project to restore and protect the site.\n\nLogistics For Visiting The Citadel and The Imperial City\n\nWithout doubt this is a vast site and having a plan of what to see, will certainly help you make the most of your visit. Information boards were lacking when we visited and this is where a guide will really help you make the most of your time.\n\nImperial City Hue Opening Hours\n\nThe Citadel and Imperial City are open to visitors year round but hours vary depending on the season. According to the official website the opening hours are :\n\nI have read on several different websites (including trip advisor) that it is possible to visit the Imperial City at night. Indeed on the official website there are special events and festivals which allow visitors to explore in the cool of the evening.\n\nIf this appeals I would recommend that you check with the local tourist office for when you can visit and specifically ask if there are performances at night in the Imperial City or theatre. Alternatively ask your hotel concierge if they can confirm for you.\n\nTop Tip : I have read a range of different opening hours for the Imperial City which don’t match with those on the Imperial City website. My advice is to confirm times and events in advance to ensure your visit goes smoothly.\n\nWhere Do You Buy Tickets For The Imperial City\n\nAs you approach the Citadel and Imperial City you will see the flag pole to your left and the mighty walls ahead of you. Just before the walls and the entrance you’ll see a small hut on the right hand side. There will always be a queue here but it moves quickly.\n\nThe ticket office follows the same opening hours as the Imperial City but closes 30 minutes earlier.\n\nTop Tip : They only accept cash and there is no online option\n\nHow Much Are Tickets For The Imperial City?\n\nIf you only wish to visit the Imperial City the price currently is :\n\nIf you plan on visiting other sites like the Royal Tombs there are combination tickets which will be cheaper. All the prices are displayed at the ticket booth and our guide explained which option would be preferable for us.\n\nAll prices are also shown on the Imperial City Hue website.\n\nIs There An Audio Guide For The Imperial City?\n\nThere are audio guides available for a small fee (150,000 VND) at the ticket office. We didn’t use them but you have the choice of different durations. I read you can opt for a 4 hour tour or a 6 hour tour.\n\nImportant Sights In The Imperial City\n\nThe Imperial City offers a glimpse into Vietnam’s imperial past. Regardless that so much has been lost, you’ll still find a rich history and stunning architecture. Our guide provided a commentary of the major attractions and talked about their use and their historical significance.\n\nRegardless of whether you go alone or with a guide, there are several key sites within the complex that shouldn’t be missed.\n\nNgo Mon Gate (Noon Gate)\n\nThis is the main entrance to the Imperial City. It features five entrances, topped with an elaborate pavilion. You can visit the pavilion, used by the emperor for ceremonial purposes and where he abdicated in 1945.\n\nThai Hoa Palace (Palace of Supreme Harmony)\n\nThis palace was the emperor’s throne room and used for important state ceremonies. The building is notable for its grand architecture and adorned with intricate lacquer work and regal decorations.\n\nForbidden Purple City\n\nThis was the private residence of the emperor and his family and was restricted to all except a few servants. Though many structures were damaged during the wars, ongoing restoration efforts have brought some parts back to their former glory.\n\nThe Mieu and Hung Mieu Temples\n\nThese temples are dedicated to the worship of the Nguyen emperors and their ancestors. They feature intricate altars, ancestral tablets, and statues of the emperors. The buildings themselves are beautiful and well worth exploring, I loved the light and the shadows made by the doors and windows. Modest dress will be expected and no shoes are allowed inside.\n\nDien Tho Residence (Residence of Longevity)\n\nThis residence was used by the empress dowagers. It is one of the best-preserved buildings within the complex and showcases the luxurious living quarters and gardens for the royal women.\n\nRoyal Theatre (Duyet Thi Duong)\n\nOne of the oldest surviving theatres in Vietnam, used for performances for the royal family. Still in use today, visitors can enjoy traditional Vietnamese music and theatrical performances in this historic venue. I didn’t know about the theatre until our tour, if I’d known in advance I would have loved to watch a performance.\n\nThe Nine Dynastic Urns\n\nThese massive bronze urns are dedicated to different Nguyen emperor and adorned with intricate carvings depicting various landscapes, animals and symbols. The number 9 is a sacred number in Eastern belief and the urns were cast by master craftsmen in 1835 and it took artisans a year to carve.\n\nHien Lam Pavilion\n\nThis tall, three-story pavilion stands as a memorial to the Nguyen Dynasty emperors. It is the tallest structure in the Imperial City and offers impressive views of the surrounding complex.\n\nChanging Of The Guards\n\nIf you’re looking to see a glorious spectacle when you visit Hue then make sure you’re at the Imperial City for 8:30am. Changing of the Guards takes place every morning at the entrance.\n\nFestivals At The Citadel And Imperial City\n\nThere are several festivals throughout the year and they are shown on theImperial City website.\n\nThese events are listed on the Imperial City Website but I would also recommend that you ask your accommodation to confirm or recommend any events. We visited some of the art installations during our time in Hue but they weren’t highly visible; we happened to walk by on our first day in town and returned for a closer look.\n\nCan You Join A Guided Tour Of The Imperial City?\n\nYes! We did. Sometimes we like to explore on our own (such as Taragarh Fort at Bundi in India) but for such an important (and huge) UNESCO site like this, we felt a guided tour would offer us much greater insight and ensure that we visited the most important buildings.\n\nIt is possible to find a guide when you arrive at the Citadel, but I prefer to do a little research in advance to ensure that I’m getting a great guide and that I’m seeing the sites that I wish to visit and explore. I would recommend that you book ahead; you only need to reserve your spot 24 hours in advance.\n\nTours are very reasonably priced. Our go-to choice is very often GuruWalk as the guides are local and really know their stuff. There is no set fee for GuruWalk but there is a recommended minimum, which is usually 10$. You’re welcome to give more, especially if the tour group is small and the guide goes above and beyond like ours.\n\nOur tour was scheduled for 3 hours; we did go over this time but the guide seemed happy to keep talking.\n\nIf you prefer to book with more familiar booking sites I would recommend one of the following highly rated guided walks.\n\nTop Tip : Your tour price does not include your entrance fee. You will still need to purchase your ticket when you arrive with cash. Going with a guide ensures that help is at hand if needed.\n\nDIY Or Guided Tour Of The Imperial City?\n\nWhether you opt for a guided walk explore alone is going to be down to personal preference and maybe, budget and timescales.\n\nFor this kind of historical monument we chose a guide. We learned to much more about Vietnam and her history than we would have ever learned from a book or the audio guide.\n\nI do feel it’s important to research and check reviews of guides and tours in advance. We’ve seen guides that simply led their group to a building and pointed. I should stress, we’ve never had this with GuruWalk). But. Do your research.\n\nPros Of Visiting With A Guide\n\nCons Of Visiting With A Guide\n\nHow Long Is The Tour Of The Imperial City?\n\nMost tours range from 2.5 – 3 hours. I would also allow a little more time to explore alone if you would like to spend longer. We had one guy leave our tour early as timescales for him were very tight.\n\nIt is a large site with a lot to see; I’m pretty sure you could spend a whole day here if you wanted to see every corner.\n\nTips For Visiting The Imperial City\n\nWe visited Hue In February and it was very hot. There is limited shade in the Imperial City, although the guides were great at finding the best spots. But make sure you are prepared for a lot of time in the sun.\n\nWhat To Wear At The Imperial City\n\nIt’s probably going to be hot so wear loose fitting, light comfortable clothing BUT do remember that you’ll be visiting temples, so you will need to keep shoulders and knees covered.\n\nYou will be walking a lot. The walking is not fast and you spend a lot of time meandering or standing, so comfortable shoes are a must.\n\nWhat To Bring\n\nYou need very little but the obvious items would include :\n\nI’d also recommend a bag, we have a small over the shoulder bag which contains phones, scarf, sunscreen, hat and water and things like paracetamol or anti-histamine and any other emergency first aid items. It’s a convenient way to carry your things. It seems like an obvious choice but often we head off and I only take my camera and always regret not having a bag with supplies.\n\nHow To Get To The Imperial City In Hue\n\nWe took a taxi; we use Grab (it’s an Asian version of Uber). Our tour started early and we didn’t fancy the 30 minute walk from our hotel.\n\nIf you’re happy to walk the Vietnamese flag flies proudly at the entrance of the Imperial City and can be seen from most spots along the river. If you are walking bear in mind that you will probably have to cross the Perfume River first, so ensure your route takes you to one of the city bridges.\n\nFinal Thoughts : Is It Worth Exploring The Imperial City Hue?\n\nYes, it was so much bigger and better than we anticipated. The Imperial City is a must for anyone visiting Hue. It’s a UNESCO world heritage site for good reason and whilst it may have suffered terrible damage during the war, it is being painstakingly restored to its formal glory. And I say again, the site is huge.\n\nOur visit never felt hurried or busy and the time passed quickly. It was a good idea of our guide, to pause partway for an cold drink in the little on-site café, but if your tour doesn’t allow for this perhaps retrace your steps at the end and take a pause."
