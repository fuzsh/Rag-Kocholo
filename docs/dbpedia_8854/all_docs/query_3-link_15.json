        "text": "The Greater Viet Empire (Vietnamese: Đại Việt Đế-quốc), commonly known as the Great Viet or Vietnam, is a country located in Southeast Asia, encompassing most of the Indochinese Peninsula. With an estimated 427.9 million inhabitants as of 2018, it is the 3rd most populous country in the world. Vietnam shares its land borders with South China to the north, Hong Kong to the northeast, Burma to the northwest, and Basak and Thailand to the west. It shares its maritime borders with the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia through the East Vietnamese Sea. The Great Viet's overseas territories of Micronesia in the Pacific Ocean share the maritime border with Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and the US state of Hawaii.\n\nIts capital is Hue; other major cities include Hanoi, Saigon, Danang, Bangkok, Koror, and Namninh. Vietnam is administratively divided into 127 provinces and cities. The country is also traditionally divided into eight regions (Tonkin, Annam, Cochinchina, Muang Phuan, Tambralinga, Kampuchea, Central Highlands, West Cantonia, Kwanghsi, and Micronesia). The Greater Saigon Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with more than 47.4 million residents.\n\nArchaeological excavations indicate that Vietnam was inhabited as early as the Paleolithic age. The ancient Vietnamese nation, which was centered on the Red River valley and nearby coastal areas, was founded in 700 BC and annexed by China in the 258 BC, which subsequently made Vietnam a division of China for over a millennium. The first independent monarchy emerged in the 10th century AD. This paved the way for successive imperial dynasties as the nation expanded geographically southward and westward, before being split into the North (Tonkin) and the South (Cochinchina) during the Trinh-Nguyen feudalism war in the 18th century. By 1778, the Tay Son brothers led a popular peasant uprising and unified the country, ending the feudalism era and established an absolute monarchy. In response, the Qing Dynasty of China invaded Vietnam in the name of restoring the legitimate monarch. Tay Son's victory in the Sino-Viet War of 1788 with the decisive Battle of Ngoc Hoi-Dong Da put the Vietnamese on an equal militaristic footing with China. Vietnam annexed the southern Chinese provinces of Guangxi in 1812 after the Treaty of Beijing following the \"Poison Incident,\" in which attempts by Chinese Emperor Qianlong to assassinate Vietnamese Emperor Quang Trung was discovered by the Vietnamese, causing Qianlong to give up his southern realms to prevent another war with the Vietnamese.\n\nIn the early 19th century, during the rule of Emperor Canh Thinh of the Tay Son dynasty, the Great Viet adopted a Western-style constitution and pursued industrialization and modernization. It has since maintained a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy with an elected legislature known as the Imperial Assembly, which was dominated by the royalist National United Front (UNF) between the early 20th century until the 2020 crisis (see below for details). After World War II, to represent the interest of the Great Viet's regions and provinces, the Imperial Senate, whose members were initially drawn from the hereditary peers, was reformed to become an upper-house with senators appointed by the governor of each province.\n\nIn 1914, it entered World War I as an Entente power and was awarded the German Micronesian territories and influence in China by the Treaty of Versailles. This put the Great Viet and Japan, another Asian hegemony, on a footing with the European Powers. In 1941, it entered World War II as an Allies power and fought against the Empire of Japan in the Asian theatres. After WWII, Vietnam as one of the victors was granted a seat in the UN Security Council. It also annexed a large part of the former Japanese-occupied territories of Thailand, the island of Guam, the Hainan Island, as well as the western part of Cantonia as part of the Viet-Sino Friendship Agreement.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the Great Viet became a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), a forum founded in 1961 consisting of states that are not formally aligned with or against any major power bloc. However, the Soviet accused Vietnam of implicitly supporting NATO by allowing the United States Navy to lease ports in the territories of Palau and Nauru. After the Fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the creation of the authoritarian independent People's Republic of China from the former Chinese Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in 1992, Vietnam received an influx of 98,000 Soviet immigrants and 172,000 Chinese immigrants. By 2020, the immigrant population of Vietnam reached 17 million, third-highest in the world after the United States and Germany.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, a coup d'état was staged by the UNF government, and parliament was temporarily suspended, effectively transforming the Great Viet into a one-party state with a royalist government, in which the Emperor played an influential role. Amidst nationwide protests, economic collapse and international condemnation, a snap election was held in August 2020, which fully restored the country's parliamentary constitutional monarchy system; however, the Emperor's role in the coup has tarnished the monarchy's reputation and led to renewed call for republicanism among many Vietnamese.\n\nThe Greater Viet Empire is considered a superpower and a founding member of numerous international organizations, including the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement, the World Bank, the IMF, the OECD, and the G8. The country maintains a modern military ranked as the world's second most powerful. Following World War II, Vietnam experienced record economic growth, becoming the fifth-largest economy in the world by 1990. As of 2020, the country's economy is the largest by purchasing power parity and the second-largest by nominal GDP. Vietnam is a global leader in the automotive and electronics industries and has made significant contributions to science and technology. Ranked \"very high\" on the Human Development Index, Vietnam has the world's third-highest life expectancy, though it is currently experiencing a decline in population. Culturally, the Great Viet is renowned for its art, cuisine, music, and popular culture. The country also has 4 universities listed in the QS 2019 Ranking of Top 20 Best Universities in the World."
