        "text": "Owning the charm of Perfume River, Hue is a conservative city with exotic cultures. Being well-known as Vietnam’s ancient capital, where located Nguyen Dynasty’s citadel.\n\nThe city represents a demonstration of the vanished Vietnamese feudal empire. Visiting Hue, you can not only learn about the citadel’s history and exhibition but also get the chance to visit many historical attractions such as tombs, pagodas, monuments, etc. The beautiful landscape and the tranquil atmosphere would bring about a relaxing journey while discovering the city.\n\nTruong Tien Bridge\n\nHue was founded as Vietnam capital by Gia Long – the first King of the Nguyen Dynasty in 1802. Constructed in 1804, the Hue Imperial Citadel was Vietnam’s last royal dynasty’s residence for 143 years. It held the royal position for nine Nguyen Dynasties until 1945. The ancient Citadel was severely damaged during skirmishes with the French in 1947 and destroyed by American forces during the Tet Offensive (a major military campaign of America – Vietnam War in 1968). Including more than 160 buildings originally, only 20 buildings survived from severe damages under French rule and Vietnam War. Fortunately, in 1993, UNESCO designated the Citadel as one point of the World Heritage List, which enhanced Hue and the Citadel’s position in Vietnam tourism development.\n\nNowadays, Hue city does not attract tourists thanks to the ancient citadel, but also due to many historical attractions, tranquil landscape beauty, and local specialties.\n\nHue Citadel\n\nTop recommended attractions in Hue\n\nHue Citadel: Seek more information and experience about the Vietnam royal dynasty? Hue Imperial Citadel is exactly where you need to come. The Complex of Hue Citadel is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which consists of a massive complex featuring hundreds of monuments and ruins from the Vietnam War. Entering Hue Citadel, travelers may visit the Forbidden Purple City, the Imperial City, royal tombs, flag tower, pagodas, temples, library, and museum, which offer much interesting information and experience.\n\nMinh Mang’s Tomb: Also known as \"Hieu Mausoleum\", Minh Mang's tomb is one of the most mystical tombs of the Nguyen Dynasty, which is a complex system of 40 beautiful constructions, including temples, pavilions, palaces, etc. Combined with landscape and architecture buildings, the tomb can be considered as a microcosm of Hue Citadel, which is a perfect combination of the manmade and natural beauty of Hue.\n\nThien Mu Pagoda: Considered as Hue’s iconic symbol, Thien Mu Pagoda and its surroundings comprise a perfect harmony of ancient architecture, natural landscape, and religious atmosphere. Being the oldest pagoda in the ancient capital, Thien Mu has a long history through wars and dynasties, with an interesting legend coming along.\n\nThien Mu Pagoda in Hue\n\nThuy Bieu Village: If you are too familiar with sightseeing and historical attractions in Hue, visiting Thuy Bieu Village is definitely a good choice for travelers who seek to explore the city’s culture and people, especially when Hue is also famous for rustic and simple features of old villages. The village is, in fact, one of the most attractive destinations of Hue.

They can be really nice to you as guests, but sometimes they may be shy or quiet.
