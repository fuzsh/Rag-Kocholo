        "text": "*Note: This should have been published on July 7th, but I did not have internet access at the time, and have been busy and distracted since then.\n\nI am sitting on a train that is traveling from Hue to Da Nang, where I will begin my odyssey back to America. I am a little sad, a little excited, and very much dreading the 40 plus hours of travelling that lie ahead of me. Instead of dwelling on the great change and aching back that is coming, I will take this time to write my LAST blog post about the place I am leaving: Hue.\n\nHue was the imperial capital of Vietnam from 1802 to 1945, but in order to understand how it came about, we have to back track. The last time I wrote about Vietnamese history, I left off with the Lý dynasty, which is a pretty good place to start this story. The Lý dynasty ruled from Hanoi (then Thanh Long), and at the time, Vietnam, or as it was then known – Dai Viet – only encompassed what is today northern Vietnam. Vietnamese kings had been trying to conquer the Champa empire to the south for centuries, but it was not until the Trần dynasty that they began to succeed.\n\nAll good things must come to an end, and such was the case with the Lý dynasty, when a court minister named Trần Thủ Độ engaged in some tricky political maneuvering, including dethroning the last Lý king and marrying his nephew to a princess, thus effectively beginning the Trần Dynasty. While the Trần Dynasty made quite a lot of political and cultural achievements, their main contribution to this story is their continuation of the great tradition of invading the Champa Empire to south. Starting in 1312, the Trần dynasty made the Champa Empire a tributary state, which made the land which is now Hue part of Dai Viet for the first time. The Champa did not go down without a fight, though. They successfully invaded the then capital Thang Long (Hanoi) twice.\n\nJust as an aside, I cannot write about this period in Vietnamese history without mentioning Trần Hưng Đạo, one of the greatest military leaders of all time. He successfully resisted no less than 3 invasions by the Mongols, led by Kublai Khan, using both brilliant and brutal tactics. For example the Mongols tried to attack by sea at the 3rd battle of the Bach Dang River, Trần Hưng Đạo repeated the pole and tide tactic, but upgraded it by sending in fire boats to burn the entire fleet.\n\nAlright, back to the story of how Hue came to be. During all this chaos of being invaded by the Champa and the Mongols, the Trần dynasty was overthrown by a court official, who was in turn overthrown by the invading Chinese Ming Dynasty after only 7 years. Not wanting another long Chinese occupation, a farmer by the name of Lê Lợi led a successful uprising against the Ming, and took the thrown in 1428 to begin the Lê dynasty. Living in Hanoi, Lê Lợi has special significance for me, since as the legend goes, a turtle rose out of Hồ Hoàn Kiếm to bestow upon Lê Lợi the sword that would lead him to this victory.\n\nAnyway, where the Lê Dynasty fits into the story of Hue is that they were the ones who conquered the Champa once and for all, and the Khmer empire even further south, so that the Dai Viet empire looked like what it is today for the first time in history.\n\nBut the story doesn’t end here. The Lê were overthrown by their general, Mạc Đăng Dung, which began the short-lived Mac dynasty in 1527. This is where it gets very confusing. This country that is not yet Vietnam goes through a series of civil wars between the north and the south. First, another official of Lê dynasty, Nguyễn Kim, revolted against the Mac and restore the Lê dynasty in the South (although the Lê were essentially figureheads). Then, Nguyễn Kim was assassinated, and his son-in-law, Trịnh Kiểm, assumed military power and his son, Nguyễn Hoàng, moved further south to govern. The Trinh lords eventually overthrew the Mac in the north, at which point, Nguyễn Hoàng declared himself ruler in the south and stopped supporting the north. So now the civil war has switched from the Mac against the Le/Trinh to the Trinh against the Nguyễn. After about 50 years of fighting, they finally called a truce, whereupon “Vietnam” was divided into two countries.\n\nBut the story doesn’t end here either. About a hundred years after that, in 1771, the Tây Sơn rebellion, led by three Nguyễn brothers entirely unrelated to the Nguyễn lords in the south launched an attack against the royal Nguyễns, occupying all of their land and killing all but one of them by 1776. This last Nguyễn, Nguyễn Phúc Ánh, fled to Siam, but was not out of the fight for good. A lot of military and political maneuvers happened over the next 30 years, but the summary is this: the Tây Sơn take over all of Vietnam, including the Trinh domain in the north, but weakened by political infighting, Nguyễn Phúc Ánh is able to come back and conquer them.\n\nNguyễn Phúc Ánh was now in control of the whole country, which he named Viet Nam. He proclaimed himself Emperor Gia Long and moved the capital to the more central location of Hue. Thus Hue was born as the imperial city of a nascent Vietnam.\n\nEmperor Gia Long set to work at building a grand imperial city, suitable for the son of heaven, and impenetrable to enemies.\n\nThe reason that Hue is so famous is that they left behind a legacy of art and architecture and grand imperial living for us to enjoy today. The imperial citadel has been greatly damaged by two wars, but it is impressive nonetheless.\n\nIt is surrounded by a moat and guarded by a great gate. Within its walls lie temples, theaters, and palaces.\n\nThere are special residential areas for the Queen Mother, the First Wife, the concubines, the eunuchs, and the princes.\n\nAnd within the heart of the citadel lies the Forbidden City, the emperor’s own private residence, accessible only to him and his eunuchs and concubines.\n\nIf you are paying attention to the dates, you might have noticed that this empire was founded in 1802, which is only about 50 years before the French come and colonize. So despite being the dynasty to create this grand empire, they were also the last dynasty. The French allowed them to stay in power, and the dynasty did not end until Ho Chi Minh asked the last emperor, Emperor Bao Dai, to abdicate in 1945, however many of the emperors were little more than puppets or figure heads.\n\nIn this powerless position, many emperors devoted their time and money to creating elaborate tombs for themselves. The emperor Tu Duc’s is the largest and grandest, having used it as both a personal pleasure retreat and a tomb. He had an entire section built just for his concubines. This guy had 104 official wives and countless other concubines, and yet did not produce a single heir. I am sure if you asked him, he would have blamed the hundreds women who failed to get pregnant.\n\nNot everyone was so pleased about its construction. He used so many resources and so much slave labor to build it, that a revolt was actually planned, but was discovered before it was implemented and quickly squashed. Despite the brutality and excess that may have gone into its construction, this tomb and others are today some of the best representations of Vietnamese art and architecture.\n\nTake for example the tomb of Kinh Dinh, which is arguably the flashiest and most elaborate of the tombs. Outside is exquisite carving and blackened concrete, but on the inside, every square inch is covered in colorful porcelain mosaic. It is really beautiful and magical to see.\n\nThis emperor’s son, Bao Dai, was the last Nguyen to rule. He left quietly, and although he did not disappear from Vietnamese politics for a while, it marked the end of this imperial era. Ho Chi Minh, of course, moved the capital of Vietnam back to Hanoi, so this also marked the end of Hue as a political center. However, despite the destruction that two successive wars wrought to much of the history and culture in Vietnam, much of the splendor and beauty of the Nguyen dynasty’s empire remains, which is what makes Hue so special."
