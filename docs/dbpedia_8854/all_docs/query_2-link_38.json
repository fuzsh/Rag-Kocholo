        "text": "So, we are in the third leg of our 5 H trip. We woke up early to catch the bus to Hue from Hoi An. Check out Hoi An trip Here\n\nHue is known as the home of the emperors and it is the Empire capital of Vietnam. It was once a capital city of Nguyen Dynasty 1802-1945.\n\nWe just spent one full day in here before taking train to HÃ  Ná»™i. Main place want to see is the Perfume river and the 19th century citadel.\n\nWe tried the sleeper bus from Hoi An to Hue about 4-5 hours.\n\nI love this trip, its very comfortable.. the scenery was very green with a lots of mountains. As my usual thing, its time for me to just stare at this view for hours while playing my itunes playlist. We also Pass by the famous Vinh Moc Tunnels.\n\nView while travelling to Hue from Hoi An\n\noverlooking the perfume river. What a pretty river name. we pray together hereðŸ˜Š\n\nWe just reached Hue and our bus drop us near this beautiful park, we dont even know the name as the signs was all in viet.\n\nThe heat of the sun was scourging but it didnâ€™t hinder us to stop and take a look for a while.\n\nTook our lunch first as its already 12 noon. and we are starving!! Iâ€™m excited to try different viet dish again.\n\nOf course, my coffee again, with this special drip they commonly use here, I JUST LOOOOVED VIETNAM COFFEE!\n\nThis is Banh Xeo, delicious viet crepe with pork, shrimp and bean sprout , plus of course their usual mix of herbs that always amazes me, makes me think viet people must be very healthy.. im imagining this herbs as anti cancer, anti aging agents..lol.\n\nSo here we go, took a taxi from where we had our lunch and went straight to the former Palace for Emperors, this is the south entrance if im not wrong. I was a huge place and you should be ready to walk the whole day.\n\nThis was the place where the emperors appear to the public . That terrace itself or whatever they called that. My bad I should have documented it.\n\nLotus pond in the entrance of palace..\n\nSince itâ€™s a huge place they provide this team for a minimal fee.\n\none of the throwns..inside the palace\n\nthe end of the palace is this pavilion turned to a restaurant, we didnt eat here. After exploring the palace of the emperors, It just occur to me that maybe, just maybe why people present their food very nicely is because they are from rulers of emperorsâ€¦the grandeur, the royalty..whatever it is.. Like they are making every food for the emperors..Just a thought.\n\nSo as usual, we again found a place wherein we could sing songs and pray to Godâ€¦ In the middle of the palace and pavillions and concubine houses tombs etc, we found this empty garden.. its amazing â€¦ we are seeing again the benefit of having August as non peak month for our anniversary.\n\n.\n\nThis flower symbolizes the peace ive found in this quiet place..\n\nRealization: Seeing how grand this kingdom was before, just makes me think no kingdom in this world last forever no matter how powerful that was.. no ruler will last..only one kingdom stands forever, kingdom that is in the heart, kingdom that God promise to endure forever thats kingdom of Christ.. ruling in our hearts..\n\nThe only retreat I have was that we should have stayed longer. One day is not enough thatâ€™s for sure:)\n\ntook this train from hue to Hanoiâ€¦it was a last minute purchase so we didnt get the sleeper train.. sad, my advise book it ahead.\n\nTIPS FOR BACKPACKERS GOING TO HUE:\n\n1. Make sure your back ainâ€™t too big and huge, the imperial city is a biggg place to explore by foot.\n\n2. Bring lots of water, sunscreen, umbrella/ hat and shades you will thanks me!!(so hot in Hue)\n\n3. Book your train /bus ticket early and not last minute booking.\n\n4. 1 day ainâ€™t enough in my opinion. This place is big and Hue has lots of interesting places. At least have 1 night stay.\n\nNext stop check our trip here. HÃ  Ná»™i and Halong Bay\n\nEnjoy!\n\nxoxo, J\n\nP.S. Tired of booking hotels? Iâ€™m such huge fan of local home stays so Why not try Airbnb or Book here with HomeAway!"
