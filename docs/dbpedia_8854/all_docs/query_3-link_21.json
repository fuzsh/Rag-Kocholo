        "text": "This book was written by Phan Bá»i ChÃ¢u at the suggestion of Liang Qichao.\n\nIn 1904, Phan smuggled himself out of Vietnam and arrived in Japan via China. He met and talked with Liang Qichao, a Chinese politician who lived in Yokohama. During the period of the Qing government, Liang Qichao was one of the leaders of a political reform movement to modernize the country which had been once defeated in the Sino-Japan War. This movement gained the strong support of the Emperor. However, in 1898, the reformist movement was overthrown by conservatives, and Liang defected to Japan.\n\nThrough his conversations with Phan Bá»i ChÃ¢u in Yokohama, Liang came to know of the distressed condition of Vietnam under French colonial rule. He encouraged Phan to write a book which was printed by Guang Zhi Shu Ju (å»£æºæ¸å±), the same publishing house in Shanghai that had published Liangâs books. The facts imply that Liang supported Phanâs publication.\n\nThe book contained detailed descriptions of the causes leading to Vietnamâs colonization by the French, the biographies of Vietnamese patriots who sacrificed themselves for the country, and the difficulties faced by the Vietnamese under a French domination that included 19 types of heavy taxation. He also called for his Vietnamese compatriots to stand up for the future of the country. At the end of the book, he added a section entitled âViá»t Nam Tiá»u ChÃ­ (è¶åå°å¿),â which summarized the history of Vietnam.\n\nSome pages of the book, including the title page, a foreword by Liang Qichao, and its colophon, are shown here.\n\nThis letter written by Phan Bá»i ChÃ¢u at the beginning of the 20th century evoked the heroic past of Vietnam and described the humiliation as well as the painful situation of the country under French domination. In the letter, Phan also discussed the reasons why, despite the similarities between Vietnam and Japan, only the latter nation was able to maintain its sovereignty and become prosperous. The patriot Phan encouraged Vietnamese youth to go to Japan for study, aiming to pursue national liberation, and called for his Vietnamese compatriots to create agricultural, industrial, and commercial associations that would provide overseas students with financial support.\n\nThe letter is preserved at the Institute of HÃ¡n-NÃ´m studies (Hanoi), Vietnam Academy of Social Sciences.\n\nThis book is a Vietnamese chronicle written in Chinese script. Originally, NgÃ´ SÄ© LiÃªn and others assembled this record in response to a mandate by the fifth Emperor ThÃ¡nh TÃ´ng as an official history spanning the time from the birth of the country to the year before the establishment of the LÃª Dynasty (1428â1527). Later, sequels of the LÃª Dynastyâs history up to the late 17th century were added to the original document.\n\nThis book was distributed only in Vietnam for a long time. When Toshiaki Hikida, a military officer of the General Staff Office of the Japanese Imperial Army, was assigned his post in Vietnam in 1883, he obtained the book from an official in Hanoi and published a reprint in 1884 upon his return to Japan. Afterward, Hikidaâs book was widely circulated outside of Vietnam.\n\nThe pages depicted here are his foreword and the description of a historic event in 1010: a year after LÃ½ CÃ´ng Uáº©n (LÃ½ ThÃ¡i Tá») established the NhÃ LÃ½ Dynasty, he moved his capital to ThÃ nh Äáº¡i La (å¤§ç¾ å). A yellow dragon appeared at his ship side, and he therefore named the new capital âThÄng Longâ (æç«, a rising dragon). The place is now Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam.\n\nA collection of Nguyá» n Dynastyâs records that include 773 volumes containing about 85,000 documents created under 11 out of 13 reigns spanning from 1802 to 1945 is preserved at National Archives Center No. 1 under the State Records and Archives Department of Vietnam.\n\nThe manuscripts were written on dÃ³ (poonah) paper, a special type of paper made manually from the bark of dÃ³ (poonah) trees in some Vietnamese traditional craft villages. Imperial records were handwritten with a brush using traditional manually made ink. They were drafted by clerks who were examined and recruited for their talent with words and for their calligraphic expertise.\n\nThis collection of Nguyá» n Dynastyâs records is the only archival holding of a feudal regime that exists in Vietnam and is among the very few documents in the world that contain signatures of the Emperors. They are valuable original materials that facilitate research initiatives that seek to understand the political, economic, cultural, and social systems as well as the people of a nation through a period of history.\n\nThe record introduced here is the report of the Privy Council dated the 10th day of the 11th month of the 2nd year of Kháº£i Äá»nhâs reign (1917), concerning the submission to the Emperor of a textbook of the Tokyo College of Law translated into Chinese. The textbook was offered by the Governor-general of French Indochina.\n\nThis visual contains a material created by the Production Bureau of the Headquarters for Economic Stabilization with regard to the import of anthracites and is dated 13th November, 1947. The above-mentioned agency was established in August 1946, with the prime minister as its president. It aimed at the economic revitalization and stabilization of Japan after the end of World War II. The office was perceived to be the most powerful economic authority in Japanese administration after the War.\n\nThe âFrench Indochina Anthracitesâ mentioned in this report refer to a high quality of coal containing over 90% carbon content, mined from the Quáº£ng YÃªn coalfields (traditionally called as the Há»ng Gai coal fields in Japan). The Há»ng Gai anthracites were imported by Japan since Vietnam was under French control and were widely used as briquettes and as varied industrial materials. According to a reference document cited by the âEconomic Plan for the fiscal year of 1948,â generated by the Headquarters for Economic Stabilization, ensuring fertilizer stocks to enhance food supply was an enormous challenge for the Japanese government of that time.\n\nThe report shown here is the result of a comparative investigation of French Indochina Anthracites and domestic coke as energy sources used in the process of producing calcium cyanamide, an agricultural fertilizer. The report concluded that in conditions of power shortage, French Indochina Anthracites were desirable for import because they were more efficient than domestic coke.\n\nThis document proves that the Japanese government had interest in trading with North Vietnam and in importing Há»ng Gai Anthracites since immediately after WWII. Private trade between Japan and North Vietnam became full scale after the middle of the 1950s, and the Há»ng Gai Anthracites were always among Japanâs main imports from Vietnam.\n\nThis report was created by the Party Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Trade to analyze VietnamâJapan trade relations from 1962 to 1964. The four-page report was signed on March 19, 1964, and was sent to the Central Party Committee and the Party Liaison Committee. The document originally belonged to the collection of the State Planning Committee. Now, it is preserved in National Archives Center No. 3 under the State Records and Archives Department of Vietnam.\n\nBesides quoting statistics on the trade turnover between Vietnam and Japan from 1961 to 1963, the report provided a detailed assessment with regard to the countryâs trading position vis-a-vis Japanese companies and the strategic exporting of goods, especially coal, which was the dominant commodity in the export turnover. The report also examined the prospects of trade cooperation with Japan as the Japanese Government expanded its dealings with the socialist countries.\n\nThe determination to institute a VietnamâJapan Friendship Association was adopted by the Minister of the Interior on June 4, 1965. The record belongs to the collection of the Prime Ministerâs Office and is now kept at National Archives Center No. 3 under the State Records and Archives Department of Vietnam.\n\nThe JapanâVietnam Trade Association and the JapanâVietnam Friendship Association established in 1955 contributed to the promotion of commerce as well as general non-official relations between the two countries. The bodies also raised social awareness in Japan with respect to the anti-Vietnam War movement. In reciprocal recognition, the VietnamâJapan Friendship Association was founded on June 4, 1965, under Decision No. 207-VN signed by the Minister of Interior. The VietnamâJapan Friendship Association has always been pivotal in promoting cultural, economic, scientific, technical, educational, and other exchanges between the two countries.\n\nMr. Ryotaro Sugi, a well-known Japanese singer and actor, was awarded the Friendship Medal by the President of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam for his active contribution to cultural exchange between Japan and Vietnam. The decision was signed by Vice President Nguyá» n Thá» BÃ¬nh on November 19, 1992. The record of the decision belongs to the Presidentâs collection, which is now preserved in National Archives Center No. 3 under the State Records and Archives Department of Vietnam.\n\nThe photos of the certificate and the ceremony are provided by Sanyu Co., Ltd. The award ceremony was held at the Municipal Theatre in Hanoi. Nguyá» n Khoa Äiá»m, the Minister of Culture and Information, handed the decoration to Mr. Sugi on behalf of the President.\n\nMr. Ryotaro Sugi was the President of the JapanâVietnam Cultural Exchange Association. He is also the first ever foreigner commissioned to be a Special Ambassador for VietnamâJapan Relationships by the Government of Vietnam. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also appointed him a JapanâVietnam Goodwill Ambassador from 2005 to 2008, and he has been assigned the position of JapanâVietnam Special Ambassador since 2008."
