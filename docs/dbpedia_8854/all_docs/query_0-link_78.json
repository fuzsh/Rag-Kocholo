        "text": "The Kings of the Nguyen Dynasty built their feudal capital along the fertile banks of the Perfume River, whose steady flow, centuries on, still sets up a languid pace that the rest of the city is happy to follow.\n\nSituated within the walls of the Royal Citadel, The Imperial City in Hue is one of, if not the most prominent landmark in Vietnam, renowned for its wonderful collection of oriental architecture. Constructed in 1803 under Emperor Gia Long, it served mostly ceremonial function during the French colonial period.\n\nAfter the end of the monarchy in 1945, the complex suffered heavy damage during the Indochina and then Vietnam wars and was largely neglected throughout the 1980s. Many of the former royal buildings, museums, libraries, and Buddhist shrines, including the Temple of Heaven, were subsequently rebuilt, and in 1993 earned Hue the title of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nThe Site mainly comprises the Citadel, complete with the Imperial City and the Forbidden Purple City (once the emperor's home) separated by seven barriers, plus some other related buildings in the immediate vicinity. At the entrance to the Citadel is the Ngo Môn gate, where the emperor announced his decisions; the Palace of Supreme Harmony, throne room with purple and yellow lacquered columns; and the Imperial Museum which houses royal clothing, furniture and porcelain. The Forbidden Purple City also includes the Royal Theater where traditional Vietnamese performances are still given today.\n\nTo get acquainted with the legacy of Vietnam’s last royal family and explore the surviving evidence of their 143-year long reign, follow this self-guided walking tour."
