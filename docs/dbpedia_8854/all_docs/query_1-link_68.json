        "text": "I don’t normally interact with the operators Helen introduces me to other than during the face to face during the site and trip. However, I just had to write you about my experience in Vietnam. Thank you for indulging me for the next few minutes.\n\nFirst, despite a semi-reluctant agreement to do it—your recommendation for Vietnam and Siem Reap ended up being fantastic. You were right on many points including the food, the hotels and the people.\n\nSecond, your Vietnam team is incredible. I genuinely love the people you have there. Cindy is a solid leader and very hospitable. Linda was so attentive to all of our needs and thoughts. I made significant change requests at 8:30 pm at dinner and by 9:00 am the next morning…done! As for Hanna…my wife and I adore her. She is sweet, kind and has a heart to help others like nobody I have met.\n\nHaving forgotten to gather some dolls Hanna had provided—we were on our way to the airport. Hanna called to find out where we were. There was no time to turn around—so she decide to scooter it out to us. I don’t have to tell you about traffic—but somehow she made up the 10-15 minute lead we had, got off her scooter and ran the dolls to our van. Her smile was so beautiful. She walked to the side of the road and waved to us until we were out of sight. At that moment, Jen and I decided to make her our Honorary Daughter. I don’t know exactly what that means now—but she has two brothers that want to meet her!!\n\nIn addition to the doll driving spectacular, Hanna’s English is near perfect and her ability to translate what we wanted to others seemed to be spot on. And when I say “translate” I don’t just mean English to Vietnamese—I mean from “what does this blabbering—can’t make up his mind—crazy guy saying” to “yes, sir—here you go!”\n\nIn addition to the team, we had super guides—each with their unique strengths and capabilities:\n\nQuyen’s English is very good -but still has an excellent accent which I believe is part of the experience. His knowledge of military, family and religious matters is impeccable. We really enjoyed Quyen and our time with him. He has a good sense of humor and understood my sarcasm (a staple of my personality) perfectly. I think Quyen’s biggest opportunity to improve is learning to read people. With his incredible knowledge came some long-winded monologues on various subjects. I mentioned this to him. Sometimes it is hard to read groups because some may be interested. However, my experience leads me to believe two things about leading group tours. 1. Once you get to 10% of the group looking less interested…move on—those interested will ask questions. 2. Always leave people wanting for more. Think about a meal—sure I could eat a 16 oz steak—but how would I feel afterward. 10 oz—is perfect—I’m not hungry, but I am looking forward to another sooner than later. If Quyen can master these ideas he becomes one of the best guides in the World—not just Vietnam. Again, still one of the best I have worked with and on a personal one-on-one note—I love this guy and related really well to each other. I’d like him to lead in Ha Noi and be on the guide team in Hoi An as well.\n\nTra. His knowledge was deeper than imagined and it only took a bit of time to hear him clearly. More, he, like Hanna, has a big heart. He shared his story as a child in Vietnam and it blows be away. The resiliency of this guy is incredible. Despite such turmoil in his life he has built a happy life and has helped his children build a great future--I truly admire this. Not a minute went by that he didn’t do whatever it took for us to be happy—including taking us to see fireworks well after the originally stated end time for the day—and at a time he would have much rather have been watching World Cup action. He is a class guy and our guests will enjoy him as much as I did. In fact, I can say we bonded as friends in the short time we were there and I intend to stay in touch with him. I’m sorry I can’t recall the drivers name—and I should—he was very gracious, drove safely and had an excellent demeanor. I want him with our group too.\n\nThank you for a great trip. In fact, I have told many people that I intend to return on my own in the not too distant future. I’ve been all over the world and to some of the most sought after destinations and hotels, etc, I’ve never felt that way before. It’s never been a MUST.\n\nMy family of four just completed a 14 day excursion with 365 Travel that included 4 days in Thailand, 3 days in Cambodia and 7 days in Vietnam. I worked with an amazing trip planner Hanna Doan who was extremely accomodating to all of our requests and allowed us great flexibility to make changes sometimes necessitated by air travel changes. She was a great resource when we chose to make some of the hotel arrangements on our own. I had the chance to meet Hanna in Hanoi and she was a lovely person who even gave us beautiful souvenier gifts from her country.\n\nI will start by saying that our family has traveled throughout the world with a number of great tour operators and the level of customer service focus of this company is about as good as it gets. At each of our stops, we were met by wonderful guides who were kind, passionate, informed and friendly and drivers who were not onlyexcellent drivers in navigating through an amazing web of traffic at many large cities but were always courteous and giving us water and facial wipes along the way. The guides responded to all of our questions, gave us suggestions and even treated us to local food and drink for tastings. They were also very patient with us waiting sometimes hours at the airport due to flight delays or visa issuance delays in Ho Chi Minh city. They made sure at hotels and airports that everything was in order before leaving us even though we had made some of these arrangements on our own.\n\n365 Travel was extremely helpful in designing itineraries that met our needs in terms of the number and types of places we wanted to visit. Never did they say no to something or indicate that our requests were not reasonable. The lunches and dinners that were included were all very good with restaurants that provided good food and service by our standards. I can't say enough great things about their attention to detail and making sure their services were always to our satisfaction.\n\nBefore the trip, I had considered 3 other recommended tour operators, which were larger and had more reviews. I went with 365 Travel mostly because of the attention Hanna provided and their great flexibility and knowledge. I found their pricing to be very fair. I am truly glad that I went with 365 Travel and recommend them without any reservation. A friend of mine who also used them on a Vietnam trip during the same period we were in were also very pleased with their services.\n\nThe happy memories we created through this trip we owe in great part to the great attention and services we received from 365 Travel and Hanna.\n\nVisited December 2015"
