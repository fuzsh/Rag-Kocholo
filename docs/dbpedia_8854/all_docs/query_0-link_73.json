He is also good at english and is very knowledgeable in Vietnamese history, my family and I learned a lot from him during the tour. If you are in the Da Nang area and want to go on tours book with Thong you will not regret it!\n\nTrip to Hue Imperial City with Happy was amazing.

He was a super devoted and friendly guide who made sure to answer all our questions and gave us many historical details. Relaxed pace when touring. Also, it was a super nice small group, which was nice to integrate with, especially during lunch. The lunch food could have been a bit better but other than that, amazing and would definitely recommend.\n\nOur group of 12 really enjoyed the trip with Phước. It was a super hot day but he did a good job of keeping us moving and not spending too much time in the sun. He also was very knowledgeable about the area and made the trip interesting for history fans. He even helped us make a quick stop to try...\n\nOur group of 12 really enjoyed the trip with Phước.

He even helped us make a quick stop to try some Hue salted coffee :)\n\nThinh gave us a great tour of hue. He also gave us a mini Vietnamese lesson on the way. He is very knowledgeable not just about hue, but the entire area. He included scenic stops on the way, and lots of stories about the Nguyen dynasty, and the reactions of regular people to them.\n\nThinh gave us a great tour of hue.
