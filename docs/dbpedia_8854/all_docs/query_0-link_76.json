In the past, Hue was the capital of Dang Trong (from 1738 to 1775) and the administrative capital of Vietnam under the Nguyen Dynasty (from 1802 to 1945). During the French Indochina period, Hue functioned as the administrative capital of the Annam protectorate. Nowadays, the city is dedicated to tourism by preserving the UNESCO-inscribed complex of Hue monuments. Tourists visit Hue not only because of the ancient royal monuments but also the romantic landscape and laid-back lifestyle of the Hue residents, which bring them peace of mind. Oftentimes, the tour to Hue is combined into the tour packages of Da Nang – Hoi An – Hue, which are best-sellers in recent times. The three destinations become the must-sees in central Vietnam. The two neighboring provinces of Hue are Da Nang and Quang Tri. In addition, Hai Van Pass connects Hue to Da Nang and serves as a border of climates between the two regions. Hue nowadays functions as the center of culture, tourism, medicine, and education in central Vietnam. Also, this city is a critical Buddhist center as its adjacent corners are filled with dozens of age-old Buddhist sites. It is the only city in Vietnam that retains the style of a medieval city and the intact architecture of a monarchy.

Other months are good to go too as per your preferences.\n\nHue History and Development\n\nLocated in central Vietnam and being one of the economic centers, Hue city is also a center of culture, tourism, and festival in Vietnam. It was the last feudal city of Vietnam, which was linked to its long-lasting history and royal culture. The history of Hue could be described as follows:\n\nThe Thuan Hoa-Phu Xuan regions\n\nThe old documents wrote that this region had existed under the reign of the Hung King. During the northern domination of the Han Dynasty, it belonged to Nhat Nam, one of the three wards of the Au Lac Country. In 192, it was of Lam Ap country, and then Champa kingdoms for the continuous 12 years. In 1306, after the marriage of the princess Huyen Tran, O-Ri sectors were transferred to the Tran Dynasty, who later changed them to Chau Thuan and Chau Hoa. In 1636, Lord Nguyen Phu Lan moved the capital to Kim Long, which was the beginning of the urban development of the region. A century later, in 1687, Lord Nguyen Phuc Thai transferred the capital to Thuy Loi, which was later renamed Phu Xuan, in the southwest of the present Citadel of Hue. Under the reign of Lord Nguyen Phuc Khoat, Phu Xuan developed into a prosperous capital city. Later, during the Tay Son empire (1788-1801), Phu Xuan remained the capital city of the Dai Viet country and the capital city of Vietnam for nearly 1,5 centuries under the Nguyen Dynasty (1802-1945).\n\nThere have been no exact records confirming the time when the name “Hue” was first used. Nonetheless, here is significant information:\n\nOn 20 October 1989, Thanh Thai King ordered to establish Hue town. On 12 December 1929, the Hue town was leveled to Hue City.\n\nAfter the April Evolution, Hue included the urban and suburban regions, as the district of Thua Thien.\n\nIn 1956, the Ngo Dinh Diem government performed administrative modifications, then Hue City was on the same level as Thua Thien.\n\nIn 1975, Hue City consisted of 18 wards and 22 communes.\n\nIn 1898, Hue became the city of Thua Thien Hue.\n\nNew era of Hue\n\nFrom 1990 to 2010, Hue City went through several times of administrative divisions into many wards and communes. By early 2021, Hue city has 27 wards including An Cuu, An Dong, An Hoa, An Tay, Huong Long, Huong So, Kim Long, Phu Binh, Phu Cat, Phu Hau, Phu Hiep, Phu Hoa, Phu Hoi, Phu Nhuan, Phu Thuan, Phuoc Vinh, Phuong Duc, Tay Loc, Thuan Hoa, Thuan Loc, Thuan Thanh, Thuy Bieu, Thuy Xuan, Truong An, Vinh Ninh, Vy Da, and Xuan Phu. The expansion of Hue city was a milestone in the history of its formation and development and also a great opportunity for Hue to transform. Going through several times of administrative divisions and merges, Hue today has 29 wards and 7 communes. That could be said that Hue has been developing sustainably and correspondingly to its potential and position.\n\nWhether it is the Capital, Citadel, Town, or City, Hue plays an important role as the center in various aspects. Nowadays, only after Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, Hue is a critical center of politics, culture, tourism, education, training, science, and technology in Vietnam. With the long records of history and royal culture during its formation and growth, Hue has formed its own identity, which attracts visitors domestically and internationally. People might refer to Hue with numerous beautiful names, such as the National Green City, the Festival City, the Romantic City, ASEAN Cultural City, and more.\n\nIntroduction to Hue Means of Transport\n\nYou can get to Hue by plane, train, and public coach. First of all, the plane is the most convenient and fastest way to reach Hue from other big cities namely Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Most domestic airlines run direct flights to Phu Bai International Airport of Hue. The public coach and private car options are suitable for those who are staying in the nearby provinces like Da Nang. And, if you have abundant time and enjoy the long ride, then traveling by train to Hue might be an option; sightseeing the sceneries from the train windows is enjoyable and the train ticket is affordable.\n\nTo get around Hue, it’s super easy to choose a wide means of transport from the taxi, motorbike (if you can drive a motorbike with a valid license in Vietnam), motorbike taxi, cyclo, and rental car. Among these, the taxi is the popular choice for groups of travelers or when the weather is unfavorable. Besides, a cyclo trip toward the Dong Market and past the Truong Tien Bridge is a must-have experience. In case you want to combine several attractions into a Vietnam tour, it’s smart to rent a car (with a driver) to move between the sites.\n\nIntroduction to Hue’s Best Tourist Attractions\n\nThe Citadel of Hue\n\nThe Citadel of Hue is located on the northern bank of the Perfume River. It has an area of 500 hectares and three rampant circles: 1) Capital Citadel (Kinh Thanh), 2) Imperial City (Hoang Thanh), and 3) Forbidden City (Tu Cam Thanh). The royal complex was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993. Exploring from the outside to the inside of the complex, tourists will visit the three rampant circles in sequence. Interestingly, the Forbidden City was once “forbidden” but is now open to tourism. In this royal spot, guests can try dressing like the Kings and the Queens for memorable photographs. The service’s cost is reasonable; with this, you receive instant pictures. Besides, you can pay more to have customized souvenirs like cups with your pictures printed on them. The Citadel is best for a walking tour where you can feel and touch the 19th-century relics and listen to the stories of the Nguyen Dynasty. In the past, the forbidden city was only accessed by the emperors, concubines, and their families. Those without the granted permission but tried to trespass would be punished to death. Today, the vast complex is open to all guests so you can admire the ancient moats, royal pavilions, galleries, and more. Wearing “Vietnamese Ao Dai” and taking pictures in front of the Citadel are the big musts. That said, Hue is home to Ao Dai and is where this kind of traditional Vietnamese dress can shine. If interested, you can further reach a local tailor shop and ask them to make your own “Ao Dai.”\n\nDong Ba Market\n\nOn a par with the Ben Thanh Market of Saigon and Dam Market of Nha Trang, the Dong Ba Market is a symbol of Hue. The market was opened under the reign of Emperor Gia Long and went through many ups and downs. Then, it was finally changed to Dong Ba Market in 1887 by Emperor Dong Khanh. Dong Ba is the oldest and largest wholesale market in Hue, where people find a myriad of local ingredients, fruits, and food. The market is also the ideal spot to watch the locals’ activities and trading vibe. You’re likely to come across many attractive street vendors that sell the local iconic dishes. A cyclo tour to the Dong Ba Market gives you precious opportunities to feel the idyllic and fresh atmosphere of Hue, which is hard to find in any other city. Make sure you have your camera fully charged to capture the riverscape, the chronicled Truong Tien Bridge, etc., before you reach this market.\n\nTruong Tien Bridge\n\nTruong Tien is a 402,60 m long bridge designed in Gothic architecture. It crosses over the Perfume River. The northern bridgehead is in Dong Ba ward while the southern bridgehead is in Phu Hoi ward. The bridge has a long history linked to the history of Vietnam and the French colonial era. In Festival Hue 2002, Trang Tien Bridge was installed with the modern color-changing electric system. In almost any Vietnamese literature about Hue, the name Trang Tien was incorporated. As a famous site, it has become a subject of many arts from poems to literature and songs. Nowadays, under the bridge, you can find many booths that sell souvenirs and there is a pedestrian night market filled with yummy food. When walking in the area, make sure you enjoy Trang Tien ice cream. Together with Dong Ba Market, Truong Tien Bridge is the iconic and historical image linked to the Hue identity.\n\nThe Perfume River\n\nIt is wonderful to promenade along the banks of the Perfume River, one of the most famous waterways in Vietnam. Another perfect option to enjoy the charm of the river is to take a boat trip in the evening. Oftentimes, the dinner cruise on the Perfume River also offers live performances of the local artists who are dressing the “Ao Dai” and singing the local songs. It is called the “Hue identity” which is hard to experience elsewhere. While the Perfume River is very scenic and calm, the Hue food and the local songs make up the great pastime at night. The name “Song Huong” has been linked to the Hue identity ensuring its position in the locals’ beliefs and tourism symbol of Hue.\n\nThien Mu Pagoda\n\nThien Mu is the largest and most important pagoda in Hue. It is also the official symbol of the city. In any talk about Hue City, people won’t miss the name of the ancient Thien Mu Pagoda. The site has an irreplicable role in the locals’ beliefs. Make sure you won’t ignore the famous and important Thien Mu Pagoda (another name is Linh Mu), which is located on the hill of Ha Khe, on the left side of the Perfume River, Kim Long Ward, and is around 5km to the west of Hue City. The beautiful reflection of Thien Mu Pagoda appears peacefully on the Perfume River and has been a popular image for both locals and visitors who get there to pray for all the best. This was the oldest pagoda in Hue, founded around 1601. In any talk about Thien Mu Pagoda, people often think of the Phuoc Duyen Tower which was erected in 1844 by Emperor Thieu Tri. The tower was 21m high, in an octagonal shape, and had seven floors. Each floor was dedicated to worshipping a Buddha. In front of the tower is the Huong Nguyen shrine. From the tower, you can enjoy sightseeing the romantic Perfume River for precious peace of mind. Besides the historical, cultural, and spiritual values, Thien Mu Pagoda is also a symbol linked to the peaceful charm of Hue, which makes it a must to visit during any Hue Tour. A trip to Hue without a visit to Thien Mu Pagoda is an incomplete trip, agreed by numerous tourists.\n\nTomb of Emperor Khai Dinh\n\nSituated along the Perfume River is a myriad of the kings’ tombs, namely the tombs of Minh Mang, Khai Dinh, and Tu Duc. Among these, the tomb of Emperor Khai Dinh stands out as a must-see with the impressive structure and interesting story linked. At the first sight, the gate to the tomb tells its ancient history and upon your arrival at the main ground, the stone statues of the mandarin soldiers provide a unique look.

When getting inside the property, you will be astonished by the porcelain art carved in many details. Besides, the ceiling of the palace was adored by the nine intricate dragons. The rear room of the property contained a temple dedicated to Khai Dinh’s grave and his altar. History lovers should always include this palace on the list of attractions to see in Hue.\n\nTomb of Emperor Tu Duc\n\nAlso called “Khiem Mausoleum,” the Tomb of Emperor Tu Duc took three years to complete, from 1864 to 1867. The palace was divided into a temple and a tomb. Note that Emperor Tu Duc had the longest reign in the history of all monarchs of the Nguyen Dynasty; he ruled from 1848 to 1883. This means the tomb was planned and completed under his reign. Upon completion of the construction, the emperor used the tomb’s palace as his place of residence for the rest of his life. The retreat featured the pavilion and lotus pond where the Emperor Tu Duc enjoyed reclining, reciting, and composing poetry. The emperor even enjoyed the boat trip on the lake. In the tomb area, there were three tombs of Tu Duc, his son, and his primary wife. There have been stories about the emperor’s life, the location of his real tomb, and more, which will interest the modern tourists.\n\nTomb of Emperor Minh Mang\n\nAround 14km from Hue City and situated in Cam Ke Mountain, Minh Mang Tomb (also called Minh Menh or Hieu Tomb-filial piety) was constructed under the reign of emperors Minh Mang and Thieu Tri, from 1840 to 1843. During the construction of the property, emperor Minh Mang passed away in 1841, then under the reign of Thieu Tri, the work was continued in accordance with the plan left by the emperor’s father. In 1843, the construction was complete, which transformed the wild hill into a sacred and solemn palace, which was outstanding in architecture, being friendly to nature, and reflected the deep ideological values. Together with a series of architectural works with aesthetic and artistic values, there preserve nearly 600 poems carved, which are priceless masterpieces to learn about the early 19th-century Vietnamese poems.\n\nPhu Cam Cathedral\n\nAs one of the largest and oldest churches in Hue, Phu Cam Cathedral (Immaculate Heart of Mary Cathedral) is a must to visit if you’re seeking the best church to do your religion or just wanting to witness the 17th-century construction. The site is impressive with beautiful architecture, and two giant bell towers (of which each tower has 12 floors). The Cathedral looks eye-catching with the Western classic arts. During Christmas Eve, this church is a popular gathering place, and the parish also gives food and gifts to the poor. Erected on a hill, the Cathedral has a panoramic look.
