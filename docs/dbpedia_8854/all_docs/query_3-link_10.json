        "text": "Ngo Quyen (born 897?—died 944) was a Vietnamese liberator, known for his military tactics, who founded the first enduring Vietnamese dynasty and laid the foundation for an independent Vietnamese kingdom, which he called Nam Viet.\n\nNgo Quyen was prefect, under Chinese domination, of Giao Chau province in the valley of the Red River in what is now northern Vietnam. In 938–939 he defeated the Chinese at the Bach Dang River north of modern Haiphong and declared an autonomous kingdom. He established his capital on the Red River at Co Loa, believed to have been the capital of Vietnam’s legendary Au Lac dynasty. Ngo Quyen could maintain only a tenuous control over his domain because feudal lords, known as su quan, refused to cooperate with his centralized authority. They tried to wrest power from Ngo Quyen, who barely managed to save the throne for his successors.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz\n\nNgo Quyen’s military tactics, used to expel the Chinese in 939, were imitated by later generals in the course of Vietnamese history. His reign marked a turning point for Vietnam. Although China attacked repeatedly in the centuries to come, the kingdom of Nam Viet remained autonomous until the French seized control in the 19th century."
