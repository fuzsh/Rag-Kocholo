The ancient Hue, located on the bank of the Huong River, was recognized by UNESCO as one of the World Heritage Sites. This city is the cradle of Vietnamese culture and used to be the national capital, educational, cultural and political center of Vietnam under the Nguyen Dynasty.

Hueâ€™s unique history is appealing to any history buff.

Home to national treasures, including complex of temples, pagodas, tombs, and monuments, this riverfront town welcomes millions of tourists arriving annually to see these fascinating sites. Although the American troops had destroyed many historic structures in the past, Hue does retain its charming beauty.

Besides antique sites, Hue also offers some exquisite beaches like Lang Co and Thuan An. A few mineral hot springs available are My An and Thanh Tan. Hue deserves at least a couple of days to visit.
