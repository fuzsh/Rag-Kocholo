Something we love to do is create a team relationship among the owners, engineers architect, builder and the other creative entities. This is sometimes difficult to accomplish in this type of business because of the many potential lawsuits that can arise. Although each entity needs to protect their own interests, we have found the team mindset establishes a winning position for everyone at the onset of a church construction project.

Using the team concept, everyone works for the owner. Each decision is made primarily in light of the owner’s desires and needs. In the planning stage, maximum effort is expended to ensure all the owner’s ideas are considered, digested and implemented to the greatest extent possible. This allows for engineers and contractors to evaluate all the details before the plan’s completion. Team concept not only encourages the subcontractors involvement before the plans go out to bid, but it also allows input from every area to insure the owner optimizes his construction dollars.
