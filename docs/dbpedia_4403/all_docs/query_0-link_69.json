        "text": "A buddy of mine named Larry once said, “Guys need to go through adolescence and their early 20s in a band, on an athletic field or in a military setting; nothing lets off steam and helps a person grow like those three team-concepts.” Like most things I hear, it was food-for-thought and I enjoy being around solid company because folks say some pretty smart things if one makes the effort to listen.\n\nAnd while I know he was talking about young men, mainly, I feel the same way about any young person … regardless of gender. But like quantum mechanics, it’s the empty spaces that fill up the rest of the conversation while a person can figure out what statements like that mean to them, individually.\n\nI don’t do well in stir, either of the mind or in my outward, personal life and being part of a “team” always has been in my nature. Therefore, I immediately saw the wisdom of what Larry had said (and it was mildly iconoclastic, if you think about it): That we become better as individuals when we work in concert with one-another. Few of us are virtuosos at anything — much-less EVERYTHING — and the drums work in concert with the guitars in the same way the shortstop feeds the second-baseman as the infantry sets the stage for armor.\n\nThey’re all individual puzzle pieces that require others to fully form the picture in question when combined together, and when each one plays their part it makes for a very fine product on the other end. Sometimes, that single piece is sublimated and subsumed into the larger operation … but that doesn’t last forever and — eventually — each component will play their role in the success or failure of the effort-in-question.\n\nSo, it takes some humility to prepare for the moment when the occasion is risen-to and knowing that day will come. The patience and preparation that is required to instinctively respond also is a question of training and teamwork, itself. Knowing your teammates are there in the event of error or malfunction provides comfort and relief just-as-much as excellence demands leaders assume command of the situation-at-hand.\n\nMy buddy certainly wasn’t wrong, and where the “Band, athletic-field and military” component comes in is the natural rapidity of the growth encouraged through being a part of those constructs. When you play sheet music, practice/play sports or train in the field every day, the improvement happens quite fast. Not only are you under the pressure of being accountable to the team, but you also learn how you fit into the machine. There are few environments that push such a dynamic as naturally and efficiently as the aforementioned, so it’s a matter of “when” the improvement(s) happen and rarely “if.”\n\nAnd they simultaneously occur through a symbiosis whereby the cogs in the wheel know the motor won’t work AT ALL in the grand scheme of things without their proper functioning. It’s a matter of assuming the responsibility for that subset-of-demand and acting accordingly.\n\nThat’s why it’s so much fun to watch young people participating in athletics at such a young age as they do: It’s because — on a long-enough timeline — you get to see some initial signs of what they might be capable of and their acumen combined with the unremitting improvements that come with repetition and the success that commonly follows.\n\nRegardless, the entire conversation is some pretty solid food-for-thought as we drift towards autumn and the resumption of high-school athletics and other activities for the young people in Southwest North Dakota. For another example, if you have a couple of spare minutes early next week, the Coca-Cola Tournament for Dickinson Mustang baseball will be out at the complex from July 15-18 and you can get a small glimpse of what I’m talking about (if you don’t believe me) and see everybody from 7-8, 9-10, and 11-12 year-olds while maybe reflecting on where they were and yet how far they might go in the sport.\n\nOne thing I can guarantee: They’ll eventually be better for the competition, teamwork and growth and it all starts with that combination of effort with individual impetus, which will lead to a lifetime of lessons."
