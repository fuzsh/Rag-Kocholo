        "text": "At some point, you have likely seen an organizational chart for your company. And we can probably guess what it looked like.\n\nThe typical org chart looks like a pyramid, your C-level executives at the top with lines stretching down to middle management and finally staff-level employees.Â\n\nBut not every company functions best with a hierarchical organizational structure. Many types of organizational charts exist because many types of organizational structures exist.Â\n\nIn this post, we go through the 10 common types of org structures and reasons why you might consider each of them.\n\n1. Hierarchical org structure\n\n4. Divisional org structure\n\nIn divisional organizational structures, a companyâs divisions have control over their own resources, essentially operating like their own company within the larger organization. Each division can have its own marketing team, sales team, IT team, etc. This structure works well for large companies as it empowers the various divisions to make decisions without everyone having to report to just a few executives.Â\n\nDepending on your organizationâs focus, there are a few variations to consider.\n\nMarket-based divisional org structure\n\nDivisions are separated by market, industry, or customer type. A large consumer goods company, like Target or Walmart, might separate its durable goods (clothing, electronics, furniture, etc.) from its food or logistics divisions.Â\n\nA circular organizational structure puts leaders of the organization at the center rather than the top so they can share information outward rather than pass it down a chain of command. Employees in different departments are also seen as part of a larger whole rather than siloed off by department.\n\nPros\n\nPromotes the flow of information across the organization\n\nPromotes communication and collaboration between employees and departments\n\nCons\n\nCan cause confusion around who to report to, especially for new employees\n\nCan take longer to make decisions\n\n10. Line structure\n\nA line structure is one of the simplest organizational structures as authority flows from top to bottom. Each department is ran by a manager and works toward a common organizational goal.\n\nPros\n\nReporting structure is clear\n\nStable environmentÂ\n\nCons\n\nCan be inflexible\n\nCan limit innovation and specialization\n\nCan lead to managers having a lot of power"
