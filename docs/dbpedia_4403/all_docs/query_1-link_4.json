        "text": "What Is a Company?\n\nA company is a legal entity formed by one or more individuals to engage in and operate a business. A company may be organized in various ways for tax and financial liability purposes, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction where it is formed.\n\nThe line of business a company is in will often determine which structure it chooses, such as a sole proprietorship, a partnership, or a corporation. Here is what you need to know about how these different types of companies work and how to start one if you'd like to.\n\nHow a Company Works\n\nCompanies are generally organized to earn a profit from business activities, but some may be structured as nonprofit charities. They may have a single owner or many thousands of owners.\n\nA company has many of the same legal rights and responsibilities as a person does, such as the ability to enter into contracts, borrow money, pay taxes, own assets, sue (or be sued), and hire employees.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Starting a Company\n\nThe personal benefits of starting a company include income diversification, a strong correlation between effort and reward, creative freedom, and flexibility. Creating a company can also leave a legacy for future generations.\n\nA societal benefit is that companies create jobs. If an individual starts a company and it grows, most often they have to hire employees, reducing unemployment and bringing wealth into the economy.\n\nThe potential drawbacks of starting a company include increased financial responsibility, often-long workdays, health risks due to stress, responsibility for managing employees, and dealing with government regulations and tax issues.\n\nDespite the difficulties, however, it's worth noting that many of the world's largest personal fortunes have been amassed by people who started their own companies.\n\nTypes of Companies\n\nIn the United States, companies are formed on the state level and subject to state, as well as federal, laws. The most common types include:\n\nSole proprietorships are one-owner businesses and the way that many companies start out.\n\nPartnerships are formal arrangements in which two or more parties cooperate to create and manage a business.\n\nLimited liability companies are much like partnerships but provide some of the legal liability protections of corporations.\n\nCorporations are legal entities that insulate their owners from personal legal liability for the company's actions.\n\nCompany vs. Corporation\n\nWhile all corporations are companies, not all companies are corporations. Common types of corporations include S corporations and C corporations.\n\nA corporation is a type of business that is legally distinct from its owner or owners. In the case of large, publicly traded corporations, those owners may number into the thousands or even millions of shareholders.\n\nSome of the most successful corporations in the United States include Amazon, Apple, McDonald's, Microsoft, and Walmart.\n\nPublic vs. Private Companies\n\nCompanies can be divided into two distinct categories for both legal and regulatory purposes: Public and private.\n\nPublic, or publicly traded, companies are held to strict reporting and regulatory requirements by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under these rules, they must file financial statements and reports annually. This is intended to prevent fraudulent activity and protect investors.\n\nPrivate companies, on the other hand, are held under private ownership, sometimes by a single person or family. They may have shareholders, but their shares are not traded on an exchange, as with public corporations. Private companies vary in structure and size and are not bound by all the regulations and reporting requirements to which public companies must adhere.\n\nSome well-known private companies today are Koch Industries, the candy maker Mars, and Elon Musk's SpaceX.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nA company is a legal entity created by an individual or group of individuals to conduct a business. Companies come in many different forms, from one-person shops to huge international corporations. Starting a company comes with risks but, if things go well, can also be the path to wealth."
