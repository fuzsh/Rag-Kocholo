        "text": "Friendships and relationship subsets within a group can drastically affect the dynamics of the team; they can be either strengths or weaknesses depending on the natures of the relationships themselves, the number of individuals involved in the relationships and the perceived power of the employees in the relationships. For example, a group of four friends in a relatively small team might be enough to sway the vote, driving the internal agenda of the team. Co-workers who are not a part of the inner circle might feel excluded and left out, leading to resentment and a lack of communication with members of the \"in crowd.\" Conversely, though, existing friendships can help a team work more cohesively, providing a friendly and inclusive atmosphere that improves the morale of members and increases productivity.\n\nA team consisting of several different cultures will often be able to think of a variety of different approaches to solving a problem, which is a great team strength. However, combining multiple cultures in a team can also have a negative impact upon group dynamics -- in particular, communication, which is critical for team success. This is particularly true when the members of a single team are multinational or based in different countries. Norms and expectations about how the members of a team should operate, who will act as the informal leader and how information should be shared among the members are all culture-specific. Managers should outline clear guidelines for each of these factors from the start, to minimize any miscommunication.\n\nTrust is an essential component of a successful team. Teams with participants who trust each other's decisions and actions can work faster to accomplish goals, whereas teams whose members do not trust each other will waste time discussing next steps and micromanaging each others' ideas. Team members who trust each other have nothing to fear from healthy conflict and challenge, which reduces the likelihood that people will agree to an idea just because they are afraid of the consequences if they disagree. It takes time to build trust in a team, so what may start as a weakness can become a strength over time.\n\nStrong business teams have clearly defined roles and responsibilities. Each participant knows what her own duties are and understands which team members she can rely upon for help carrying out the task. Although the division of labor among team members often will determine itself naturally over time, managers can facilitate this process by assigning tasks and roles to the participants within a team. Consider rotating the duties among team members to prevent internal jealousy."
