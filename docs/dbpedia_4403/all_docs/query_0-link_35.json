        "text": "Concept design services are the most exciting part of product development. It’s when your concept, the idea that has been floating around in your brain, finally becomes something real.\n\nHere, you begin to actually see your product and lay the foundation for everything that will come afterward. In addition to visualizing the product, this step opens doors to many other real-world applications.\n\nPrototyping, market research, and the first public “teasers” are all new phases in launching a product that can begin after an industrial concept design company has finished its work. There is a lot of room for creativity here, and, within reason, we encourage ambitious brainstorming.\n\nIn all of the steps in between imagining a product and launching it onto the market, theconceptual design phase is the most valuable. This is when you share your ideas about your product with our team, and we create virtual models based on your ideas. Depending on your product, we may use Computer-Aided Design (CAD) to create three-dimensional models or sketch with pencil and paper.\n\nEither way, our concept design company sends these visualizations of your idea back to you for feedback, and we make revisions based on your ideas until you’re happy with your product’s design. There are usually two or three iterations of feedback and revisions before this phase is complete.\n\nAs a concept design company, we never attempt to make your idea conform to our routine or preconceived notions of what a product should be. We know how to listen, and we put forth all our efforts and resources toward accomplishing the end result you want while still accommodating any practical limitations such as manufacturing feasibility, cost, and user experience.\n\nLA NPDT is also a unique because our services are applicable to a diverse set of industries. When you choose us, you will have access to a wide range of knowledge we have acquired from experience dealing with different kinds of products.\n\nFor example, the knowledge we have gained developing a medical device could potentially apply to children’s toys or sunglasses. A concept design company that specializes in developing products for only one of those industries would be more constrained to the typical solutions of their specific field.\n\nLA NPDT’s concept design services aren’t constrained in this way; on the contrary, our flexibility allows us to think critically and creatively about industrial with different kinds of information at our disposal.\n\nGiving your product a practically feasible and creatively ambitious from the start is especially significant for us as a “one-stop-shop” for product development because our concept design company will be responsible for carrying the design through the phases that come after this one.\n\nWhen services in product development are divided between industrial concept design companies and other prototyping or marketing companies, the disconnect between the multiple teams taking on different phases can create difficulties.\n\nHowever, our team of experts is keeping your long-term success in mind even as they work on this first step."
