TaskLite is a CLI task manager built with Haskell and SQLite and you can check it out at tasklite.ad-si.com.

Since this is my first post announcing it here, let me give you some more background infos on why I built it:

Taskwarrior has been the gold standard for CLI task managers so far.

However, I repeatedly lost tasks due to weird bugs and syncing issues.

I also found several UI decisions inept and wanted something with a better workflow.

But probably most importantly I couldn’t see myself contributing to a C++ project.

I had been working with C++ at university and it wasn’t pleasant.

To sum it up: I finally wanted something which I could fully own

and use until the end of days.

That means:

Does not suddenly get bought by a bigger fish and get closed down

or made unusable (looking at you Wunderlist)

Is written in a high-performance programming language,

yet gives me lot’s of guarantees about the code’s stability

and makes it easy for other developers to contribute

Free software

With a stable, future proof, powerful, and fast backend

(currently [SQLite], but support for plain files and Git is planned)
