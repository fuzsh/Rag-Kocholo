Many thanks, taskwarrior works great! But the is no package to install the current version of taskwarrior on Debian Linux "jessie". And there is no package on jessie-backports availabled. So I write a little script that makes the job: http: //sourceforge.net/projects/taskwarrier-debian/

it's a great tool
