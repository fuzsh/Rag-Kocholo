But the is no package to install the current version of taskwarrior on Debian Linux \"jessie\". And there is no package on jessie-backports availabled. So I write a little script that makes the job: http: //sourceforge.net/projects/taskwarrier-debian/\n\nit's a great tool\n\nRead more reviews >\n\nAdditional Project Details\n\nOperating Systems\n\nCygwin, Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Mac\n\nIntended Audience\n\nAdvanced End Users, System Administrators, Developers, End Users/Desktop\n\nUser Interface\n\nConsole/Terminal, Command-line\n\nProgramming Language\n\nC++\n\nDatabase Environment\n\nFlat-file\n\nRelated Categories\n\nC++ Calendar Software, C++ To-Do Lists Software, C++ Project Management Software, C++ Productivity Software\n\nRegistered\n\n2009-08-13"
