        "text": "If you have a file called todo.txt on your computer right now, you're in the right place.\n\nSo many power users try dozens of complicated todo list software applications, only to go right back to their trusty todo.txt file.\n\nBut it's not easy to open todo.txt, make a change, and save itâ€”especially on your touchscreen device and at the command line. Todo.txt apps solve that problem.\n\nSimplicity is todo.txt's core value.\n\nYou're not going to find many checkboxes, drop-downs, reminders, or date pickers here.\n\nTodo.txt apps are minimal, todo.txt-focused editors which help you manage your tasks with as few keystrokes and taps possible.\n\nIn Any Text Editor\n\nCountless productivity apps and sites store your tasks in their own proprietary database and file format. But you can work with your todo.txt file in every text editor ever made, regardless of operating system or vendor.\n\nThe todo.txt format is a simple set of rules that make todo.txt both human and machine-readable. The format supports priorities, creation and completion dates, projects and contexts. That's all you need to be productive. See an example Todo.txt file.\n\nWhat Users Are Saying\n\nThe easiest to-do list I ever used. -Dennis\n\nBrilliant... the \"cool\" factor is off the charts. -John\n\nSo simple, yet also very versatile and flexible.
