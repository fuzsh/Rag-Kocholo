Suggested values for arguments are dynamically displayed in a list. Type less, reduce mistakes and save yourself from having to memorise thousands of commands. It integrates with tldr and cheat.sh to get content, but you can also import other cheatsheets, or even write your own\n\n{% embed https://asciinema.org/a/406461?speed=2 %}\n\ntransfer.sh - Fast file sharing\n\ntransfer makes uploading and sharing files really easy, directly from the command line. It's free, supports encryption, gives you a unique URL, and can also be self-hosted.\n\nI've written a Bash helper function to make usage a bit easier, you can find it here or try it out by running bash <(curl -L -s https://alicia.url.lol/transfer)\n\nsurge - Deploy a site in seconds\n\nsurge is a free static hosting provider, that you can deploy to directly from the terminal in a single command, just run surge from within your dist directory! It supports custom domains, auto SSL certs, pushState support, cross-origin resource support - and it's free!\n\nwttr.in - Check the weather\n\nwttr.in is a service that displays the weather in a format that's digestible in the command line. Just run curl wttr.in or curl wttr.in/London to try it out. There's URL parameters to customise what data is returned, as well as the format\n\nCLI Fun\n\ncowsay - Have an ASCII cow say your message\n\ncowsay is a configurable talking cow. It's based off the original by Tony Monroe\n\nfiglet - Output text as big ASCII art text\n\nfiglet outputs text as ASCII art\n\nlolcat - Make console output raibow colored\n\nneofetch - Show system data and ditstro info\n\nneofetch prints distro and system info (so you can flex that you use Arch btw on r/unixporn)\n\nAs an example, I'm using cowsay, figlet, lolcat and neofetch to create a custom time-based MOTD shown to the user when they first log in. It greets them by their name, shows server info and time, date, weather and IP. Here's the source code.\n\nInstallations and Management\n\nMost of us have a core set of CLI apps and utils that we rely upon. Setting up a new machine, and individually installing each program would get tiresome very quickly. So the task of installing and updating your terminal apps is the perfect candidate for automation. Here are some example scripts I've written, which can be easily dropped into your dotfiles or just run independently to ensure you're never missing an app.\n\nFor MacOS users, the easiest method is using Homebrew. Just create a Brewfile (with touch ~/.Brewfile), then list each of your apps, and run brew bundle. You can keep your package list backed up, by putting it in a Git repo. Here's an example one, to get you started: https://github.com/Lissy93/Brewfile\n\nOn Linux, you usually want to use the native package manager (e.g. pacman, apt). As an example, here's a script to install the above apps on Arch Linux systems\n\nDesktop apps on Linux can be managed in a similar way, via Flatpak. Again, here's an example script :)\n\nConclusion\n\n... So that's it - a list of handy CLI apps, and a method for installing and keeping them up-to-date across your systems.\n\nHopefully some of these will be useful to some of you :)\n\nWhat wasn't included\n\nThis list doesn't include the basics, like Vim, Tmux, Ranger, ZSH, Git, etc - which you're likely already using\n\nI've also not included anything too niche, or only specific to a small number of users\n\nNothing system-specific, or that isn't cross-platform (Linux/ Unix, MacOS) is included\n\nAnd I've not included apps which relate to the terminal, but are not CLI apps (like terminal emulators)\n\nFor most of the projects listed, there's a plethora of alternatives that achieve similar things, for brevity those also weren't included\n\nCredit\n\nHuge kudos to the authors, and communities behind each of these apps. Without them and their hard work, our life in the command line would be much less awesome. Where possible, I've tried to credit the authors, but if I've missed any - let me know below, and I'll push an update\n\nFind More\n\nIf you were enjoying this, I recommend also checking out:\n\nterminals-are-sexy by Nikolaos Kamarinakis\n\nawesome-shell by Caleb Xu\n\nawesome-cli-apps by Adam Garrett-Harris\n\nIf you're new to the command line, then The Art of Command Line by Joshua Levy is an excellent resource, as is the Bash Guide by Adnan Ahmed.\n\nAnd if you are looking for inspiration, you'll love r/unixporn âš¡"
