Come to hear some first-hand details about project launches, spectacular success, and how our biggest failures can sometimes become our best experiences.Raphael FinkelFaculty, CSAugust 28, 2013The SUDA on line: using XSL and FOAbstract: The SUDA is is a massive 10th century Byzantine Greek historical encyclopedia of the ancient Mediterranean world. The purpose of the Suda On Line is to open up this stronghold of information by means of a freely accessible, keyword-searchable, database with translations, annotations, bibliography, and automatically generated links to a number of other important electronic resources. As the project nears completion, we have begun to look at XML, XSL, and XSL-FO formatting of the results; I will introduce you to these useful tools.Navjeet SandhuMS Student, CS (Finkel)September 4, 2013Getting started with HUBzeroAbstract: While working on creating a new website for dissemination of tools, data and other resources generated by our project group, we were facing an important question, \"Is there a platform we can use to jump-start our website development instead of starting from scratch?\" The answer was HUBzero, an open-source software platform for creating websites for scientific research and education. I will give a short introduction on HUBzero followed by a demo on how to start using HUBzero for creating your own website.Ahmed IbrahimPhD Student, CS (Manivannan)September 4, 2013Challenges of sharing electronic health record across different healthcare providersAbstract: The electronic health record (EHR) is a longitudinal collection of electronic health information about individual patients and populations. It provides an opportunity for healthcare organizations to integrate health care information, currently collected in both paper and electronic medical records (EMR), to improve quality of care and patient safety. EHR systems are widely used by healthcare providers. EHRs requires long-term preservation and storage. Developing a secure framework for EHR that facilitates sharing of information among different healthcare providers is a challenging problem.Greg WasilkowskiFaculty, CSSeptember 11, 2013Multivariate and â-variate integrationAbstract: We will introduce basic notions of Information-Based Complexity and illustrate them by recent results on the complexity of numerical integration for functions with many or infinitely many variables.Ping YiPhD Student, CS (Fei)September 11, 2013Responsive Web DesignAbstract: Every day more smartphones are activated, and more websites produce smartphone-optimized content. Itâs impractical to create a website version for each resolution and new device. This talk introduces Responsive Web Design, a design approach aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing experience â easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling â across a wide range of devices. The talk also introduces related technologies and frameworks.Victor MarekFaculty, CSSeptember 25, 2013Some applications of Victorian science to modern Constraint SolvingAbstract: We discuss one of the discoveries of Victorian science (during the reign of Queen Victoria of Britain) and its application in modern Constraint Solving over finite domains. This discovery and modern consequences of thereof play an important role in Computer Engineering.Hui Lin and Jizhou GaoPhD students, CS (Yang)September 25, 2013Semantic Decomposition and Reconstruction of Residential Scenes from LiDAR DataAbstract: We present our recent work to build a complete software system to semantically decompose and reconstruct 3D models from point clouds. Unlike previous urban-modeling approaches, our algorithms are designed for residential scenes consisting mainly of low-rise buildings that do not exhibit the regularity and repetitiveness of high-rise buildings in downtown areas. We present a novel building model decomposes and fits the building point cloud into basic blocks that are blockwise symmetric and convex. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on various datasets and compare our building modeling scheme with other state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms to show its advantage in terms of both quality and speed.Dinesh ManochaCS Professor, UNC-Chapel HillOctober 2, 2013Velocity-space planning techniquesAbstract: This is a department colloquium, not a Keeping Current seminar. I will give an overview of how to use velocity-space planning techniques to compute cooperative motion paths for a group of independent entities sharing the same physical space. I will focus on the special case of simulating human-like crowds, with applications to computer animation and architectural analysis. Specific topics will include optimization-based strategies for distributed collision avoidance, uses of the principle of least effort for simulating crowds, and data-driven strategies for modeling differences in personalities. The talk will also cover related techniques needed to achieve accurate simulations of large-scale crowds such as efficient parallel/SIMD compute models and methods of validating simulations against real world data and will discuss how velocity-space motion planning can be applied to collision avoidance for distributed robotic systems.Xuzi ZhouPhD student, CS (Griffioen)October 9, 2013Cyber Infrastructure for the VOEIS ProjectAbstract: The goal of the Virtual Observatory and Ecological Informatics System (VOEIS) project is to improve our understanding of lakes, rivers and streams. Our team has developed the cyber infrastructure, the Data Spoke, for two biological stations, Hancock Biological Station (HBS) on Kentucky Lake and Flathead Lake Biological Station (FLBS) in northwest Montana, that significantly expands their ability to collect, store, monitor and visualize the deluge of data being collected on nearby water bodies.Robert CassUndergrad, CS (Wasilkowski)October 9, 2013Implementing a randomized method for approximating a class of multivariate integralsAbstract: We provide an analytic formula for a randomized method of approximating multivariate integrals of a certain class of functions over the n-dimensional unit cube. We discuss the error associated with this method, and we describe how to generate the random numbers required to implement this method. Finally, we compare numerical results for this method and the classical Monte Carlo method.Shufeng HuangPhD student CS (Griffioen)October 16, 2013Software-Defined NetworkingAbstract: Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a promising way to deploy new services and protocols in networks. SDN networks enable users and applications to define every aspect of the network architecture, but at a cost that might significantly limit their adoption. First, SDN networks provide low-level APIs on which almost any type of service can be written, which can make it more difficult to implement the higher-level services needed by future networks. Second, SDN networks exhibit too much heterogeneity, limiting the ability to piece together various SDN platforms. In this talk I present a way to construct networks consisting of multiple SDN providers offering virtualizable networking resources across the Internet. Our approach introduces a Network Hypervisor service capable of internetworking various SDN providers. The Network Hypervisor builds on the low-level APIs to create a unified set of high-level APIs to simplify building and deploying complex network services.Frank RobertsCS MS grad, 2013 (Finkel)October 16, 2013Useful web sites for technology and news (PDF)Abstract: I discuss the motivation for leveraging the Internet to follow events in Computer Science and Technology. I present methods to effectively find and follow new sources of information, as well as methods to filter the most valuable items from the voluminous streams these sources produce. I present and discuss several of the sources that I follow.Tom AllenPhD student, CS (Goldsmith)October 23, 2013CP-nets with IndifferenceAbstract: Conditional-preference networks (CP nets) can represent qualitative preferences in a compact way. Much of the research on CP nets is limited to strict preferences over binary variables. I will discuss how CP nets can model preferences over multi-valued variables over some of which the preference holder may be indifferent. I will show how to employ SAT solvers to learn and reason with such CP nets. Finally, I will discuss the worry about exponentially long flipping sequences and show why in practice they are unlikely to be problematic.Ramakanth KavuluruFaculty, CS and BioStatisticsOctober 23, 2013Supervised Extraction of Diagnosis Codes from Electronic Medical RecordsAbstract: We will introduce the problem of extracting diagnosis codes from EMRs, an indispensable task in all healthcare facilities. Using two different datasets with contrasting characteristics, we map the problem into multi-label text classification and explore different approaches that involve feature selection, training data selection, and probabilistic thresholding for assign codes to EMRs.Mark HaysPhD student, CS (Hayes)October 30, 2013Statistical Analysis for Traceability or Other ExperimentsAbstract: An important aspect of research into traceability is the ability to compare techniques. In order to assure proper comparison, it is necessary to perform statistical analysis of the dependent variables collected from technique application. Currently, TraceLab lacks components to support such analysis. The Software Verification and Validation Research Laboratory (SVVRL) and the Statistics Department of the University of Kentucky have developed a collection of such components as well as a workflow for determining what type of analysis to apply (parametric, non-parametric). The components use industry-accepted R algorithms. The components have been validated using independent standard statistical algorithms applied to publicly available datasets.Fuhua ChengFaculty, CSOctober 30, 2013New 3D pointing technology with applications in remote control, presenting, and 3D mouseAbstract: This talk presents technology for the post-touch-panel era: a 3D human-computer interaction system that performs 3D pointing based on passive light detection using only one camera. This technology has many applications. This presentation will present and discuss applications in remote control, presenting, and 3D mice.Mirek TruszczyÅskiFaculty, CSNovember 6, 2013Preferences in AI and Social ChoiceAbstract: Representing and reasoning about preferences in qualitative settings is an important research area for social choice, knowledge representation and decision making. The main objectives are to design expressive yet intuitive languages to model preferences and to develop automated methods to reason about formal representations of preferences in these languages. This talk introduces material discussed further in talks by Xudong Liu (today) and Ying Zhu (Spring 2014). I will define basic concepts and formulate the main problems. I will also briefly mention some recent results on the equivalence of preference theories obtained with my Austrian collaborators, Wolfgang Faber and Stefan Woltran.Xudong LiuPhD Student, CS (TruszczyÅski)November 6, 2013Aggregating Lexicographic Preferences Over Combinatorial DomainsAbstract: When alternatives are combinations of values from domains, the space of alternatives is often too large for agents to express their preferences as strict total orders (or votes) over all alternatives. I will discuss a preference formalism, lexicographic preference trees (LP trees), that is an intuitive and compact representation of preferences over combinatorial domains. I will define two preference-aggregation problems based on positional scoring rules (such as k-approval and Borda) when preferences are represented as LP trees. I will show computational complexity results as well as experimental results using Answer-Set Programming and Weighted MAXSAT tools.Daniel HarrisPhD student, CS (Jaromczyk, Todd Johnson)November 13, 2013An Introduction to DELVE: Document ExpLoration and Visualization EngineAbstract: We present DELVE, a prototype for performing literature-based searches with the aid of interactive visualizations and a framework for quickly implementing such visualizations as modular web applications. Linked, interactive visualizations help satisfy the diverse information needs of researchers. I will demonstrate our DELVE prototype, currently implemented with two years of biomedical literature, targeting biomedical researchers.Paul MihailPhD student, CS (Goldsmith)November 13, 2013A CRF Approach to Fitting a Generalized Hand Skeleton ModelAbstract: I will present a new point distribution model capable of modeling joint subluxation (shifting) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and an approach to fitting this model to posteroanterior view radiographs. We formulate this shape-fitting problem as inference in a conditional random field. This model combines potential functions that focus on specific anatomical structures and a learned shape prior. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: one containing relatively healthy hands and one containing hands of rheumatoid arthritis patients. We provide an empirical analysis of the relative value of different potential functions. We also show how to use the fitted hand skeleton to initialize a process for automatically estimating bone contours, which is a challenging, but important, problem in RA disease-progression assessment.Ken CalvertFaculty, CSNovember 20, 2013Should you trust the padlock? Web Security and the HTTPS Value Chain (PDF)Abstract: The Web is a critical component of the global economy, with millions of transactions each day carried out using the standard security protocols (SSL/TLS). When you're buying something on the web and your browser displays a padlock, what does it really mean? More importantly, who has an interest in getting you to rely on that signal, and who is at risk if something goes wrong? This talk will present an overview of the SSL/TLS ecosystem and highlight some interesting recent results from an wide-ranging analysis of certificate authorities (CAs).Raphael FinkelFaculty, CSNovember 20, 2013Successors to TeX (PDF)Abstract: Since TeX was finalized around 1989, various improvements have been made to the underlying engine, in addition to packages such as LaTeX. I will present some of those newer versions, such as pdfTeX, luaTeX, and XeTeX. I will also discuss some of the remaining problems with the TeX-like implementations.Matthew SpradlingPhD student, CS (Goldsmith)January 15, 2014Roles and Teams Hedonic GamesAbstract: In hedonic coalition formation games, an agent's utility for a partitioning is based upon utility for her own coalition and not the coalitions of others. In this talk, I will present a brief overview of coalition formation games and the sub-category of hedonic coalition formation games. I will present a new variant of hedonic coalition formation games in which agents have two levels of preference on their own coalitions: preference on the set of \"roles\" that makes up the coalition, and preference on their own role within the coalition. This new work has previously been presented at M-PREF'13 and ADT'13. I will provide an overview of several stability notions and optimization problems for this model. I will present the results of a heuristic optimizer we developed for coalition formation in this setting.Paul LintonStaff, CSJanuary 15, 2014Unix setup and administration toolsAbstract: I will discuss the methods and applications (including SAT and Pulsar) we use to maintain computer systems in the cs.uky.edu and csr.uky.edu domains. The methods cover system installation and configuration as well as day-to-day handling of users, hosts, and printers. Next I will discuss the potential use of Puppet to further automate common tasks.Ken CalvertFaculty, CSJanuary 22, 2014What's all the fuss about Bitcoin? (Video) (PDF)Abstract: Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer payment system and \"cryptocurrency\" that has been in the news a good deal recently. After a brief introduction to digital payment systems, I will describe the history of bitcoin and the salient aspects of its open-source protocol. I will also present some considerations regarding the valuation of bitcoin and its suitability as a vehicle for commerce.Dave MobleyPhD student, CS; IBMJanuary 22, 2014How Watson Works (Video) (PDF)Abstract: Nearly 3 years ago, IBM unveiled Watson, a computer capable of answering challenging questions that were thought to only be possible for humans on the game show Jeopardy!. IBM called this new way of using computers for business \"Cognitive Computing\" and is now pushing it forward into a multitude of fields. In this presentation you will see and discuss what makes up Watson and why it is different, understand the types of questions it was designed to handle, and hear about the progress of Watson technology from the time since Jeopardy!Julia RubinPhD student, University of Toronto; IBM research\n\nFaculty candidateJanuary 29, 2014To Merge or Not to Merge: Managing Software FamiliesAbstract: Software surrounds us and drives our lives. A demand for highly customized products leads to the creation of software product lines â families of software variants with similar, yet not identical functionality. For example, Samsung's Galaxy S line includes over two dozen smartphone models, each with its own variation of software. Developing and maintaining such a large set of software variants is a challenging task. In the last two decades, numerous approaches have been proposed to help develop product lines in an efficient manner. Surprisingly, they are rarely used in practice. In this talk, we investigate reasons for this lack of adoption. Focusing on the technical perspective, we identify and organize the support required for improving existing product line management practices in real-life organizations. We map the identified support to software analysis and transformation tasks. We show that some of the identified tasks are barely studied by existing works and look in detail into one of them: merging artifacts of multiple products (also known as n-way merge). We explain why the n-way problem is NP-hard, explore possible approximate solutions, and propose our own heuristic n-way merge algorithm that is superior to other practical approaches in terms of its accuracy. We conclude the talk by outlining future research agenda.J. David SmithCS JuniorFebruary 5, 2014Clojure: Lisp on ALL the Things! (PDF) (Video)Abstract: Clojure is a dialect of Lisp designed and implemented by Rich Hickey beginning around 2005. The original implementation was released in 2007 and ran on the JVM, but it has since been extended to run in web browsers and on the .NET platform. It allows the usage of Lisp-ish ideas of code-as-data, and functional programming with the bulk of libraries and compatible devices that the JVM, .NET and web platforms provide. I present some advantages of using Clojure over the native languages of its respective platforms.Blake HallCS undergraduateFebruary 5, 2014GitHub (Video)Abstract: GitHub has become the go-to service for hosting and managing open-source software. Plenty of companies depend on it for code hosting and organize their workflows around it. Come see why it has taken off and how you can use it to get involved in the open source community.Ken CalvertFaculty, CSFebruary 12, 2014Bitcoin, part two (Video) (PDF)Abstract: After a brief recap of how the shared public ledger (the guts of the system) works, we'll talk about the Bitcoin ecosystem, valuation of Bitcoin, some issues both technical and otherwise, and some interesting possible futures.Pengpeng LinPhD student, CS (Zhang)February 12, 2014Basic usage of Dreamweaver (Video)Abstract: Dreamweaver is a popular and common tool for designing web pages as well as for maintaining websites. Many advanced web designers use it on a daily basis. This talk will demonstrate Dreamweaver and discuss some of its basic usage, including \"workspace\", layout with AP div or div tags, tracing images, defining or linking an external css sheet, and finally uploading a web page to a server for testing.Gregory GayPhD student, University of Minnesota\n\nFaculty candidateFebruary 19, 2014Improving the Effectiveness of Testing by Leveraging Artifact RelationshipsAbstract: A typical software testing framework consists of four artifacts: the specification, system, test suite, and test oracle. The specification is the blueprint from which the system is built, the test suite is a set of stimuli to the system, and the test oracle is a judge on the resulting execution of the system. Typically, testing research focuses on one of these artifacts, and treats the other artifacts as though they are independent. Such an assumption limits the potential effectiveness of the testing process. In fact, the artifacts of the testing process are often highly coupled. For example, an effective test suite has been found to be one where the tests have been built to account for the structure of the system and the execution points monitored by the test oracle. In this talk, I will discuss two projects that improve the cost, time to complete, and fault-finding effectiveness of the software testing process by leveraging the connections between artifacts and using the information learned to improve test suite and oracle composition.Tingting YuPhD student, University of Nebraska-Lincoln\n\nFaculty candidateFebruary 26, 2014An Observable and Controllable Testing Framework for Modern Software SystemsAbstract: Modern computer software systems are prone to various classes of elusive faults due to their reliance on features such as multi-core processors and peripheral devices such as sensors. Testing remains a common method for uncovering faults in these systems. However, commonly used testing techniques that execute the program with test inputs and inspect program outputs to detect failures are often ineffective on these systems. In addition, existing testing techniques focus primarily on single applications, neglecting elusive faults occur at the whole-system level due to complex system events interactions. In this talk, I present an approach that allows engineers to effectively test for elusive faults in modern software systems by providing them with deep observability and controllability. I propose a testing framework that first employs dynamic analysis techniques to observe system execution and identify program locations of interest. Next, the framework employs virtualization to achieve fine-grained controllability, allowing it to exercise event interleavings that are likely to expose faults. The ultimate benefit of this approach is its ability to test entire systems for broad classes of elusive faults. I illustrate the generality of the framework by discussing two of its instantiations: detecting process-level races and estimating worst-case interrupt latencies. I conclude by sharing my vision for new research directions related to the approach and to other aspects of software reliability and software security.David KnoesterPostdoctoral Fellow, Michigan State University\n\nFaculty candidateMarch 5, 2014Engineering by Natural Selection: Automatically building software and shedding light on collective behaviorAbstract: Engineering large-scale distributed computing systems that are fault-tolerant, self-healing, self-organizing, and self-adaptive is a challenging problem. While difficult to build, many biological systems already exhibit these behaviors, even when faced with a dynamic (and often hostile) environment. In this talk, I will present an approach to building distributed systems that takes inspiration from evolution, the process that produced these behaviors in nature. In particular, I will show how a combination of high performance computing and evolutionary algorithms can be used to automatically engineer software for distributed systems. Compared to traditional techniques, this approach enables us to specify the desired global behavior directly, and leverage evolutionary search to discover the mechanisms by which that behavior can be realized. Additionally, I will show how evolutionary algorithms form a foundation for digital environments that recreate the conditions under which biological collective behaviors may have evolved. Such computational systems enable us to study foundational questions in biology related to swarming, cooperation, altruism, and self-organization--how they function, under what conditions they evolve, how hazardous environments are dealt with, and when they fail. Ultimately, this combination of techniques will help us to engineer the next generation of distributed computing systems while simultaneously granting insight into the biological process that shaped the world around us.Hunter MoseleyFaculty, Molecular & Cellular BiochemistryMarch 12, 2014Informatics and Modeling Platform for Stable Isotope-Resolve Metabolomics (Video)Abstract: Recent advances in stable isotope-resolved metabolomics (SIRM) are enabling orders-of-magnitude increase in the number of observable metabolic traits (a metabolic phenotype) for a given organism or community of organisms. Analytical experiments that take only a few minutes to perform can detect stable isotope-labeled variants of thousands of metabolites. Thus, unique metabolic phenotypes may be observable for almost all significant biological states, biological processes, and perturbations. Currently, the major bottleneck is the lack of data analysis that can properly organize and interpret this mountain of phenotypic data as highly insightful biochemical and biological information for a wide range of biological research applications. To address this limitation, we are developing bioinformatic, biostatistical, and systems biochemical tools, implemented in an integrated data analysis platform, that will directly model metabolic networks as complex inverse problems that are optimized and verified by experimental metabolomics data. This integrated data analysis platform will enable a broad application of SIRM from the discovery of specific metabolic phenotypes representing biological states of interest to a mechanism-based understanding of a wide range of biological processes with particular metabolic phenotypes.Spring BreakMarch 19, 2014Anthony RiosPhD Student, CS (Kavuluru)March 26, 2014Multi-Label Collective Classification (Video)Abstract: I will present a paper on multi-label collective classification (Kong, Shi, & Yu 2011). Collective classification allows us to take advantage of groups of linked instances that need to be predicted simultaneously. Collective classification has been explored in the single-label setting, including binary and multi-class problems. This paper proposes a novel method to classify instances with a set of labels that can take advantage of instance and label based correlations.Jim GriffioenFaculty, CSMarch 26, 2014What can GENI do for you? (Video)Abstract: The Global Environment for Networking Innovation (GENI) â a national testbed network for experimenting with new network protocols and services â has been in development for several years, and has now matured to the point of being a very useful platform for building radically new networked applications. This talk will describe the current status of the GENI network and present some of the tools/features that make it the unique testbed that it is. In particular, we will describe the GENI Desktop, an interface to the GENI network being developed here at UK.Jeremy ReedPhD Student, CS (Finkel)April 2, 2014OCR magnitudes faster than usual (Video) (PDF)Abstract: This presentation looks at utilizing commodity graphical processing unit (GPU) hardware and the CUDA C programming language extension to increase efficiency and throughput for optical character recognition (OCR), a precursor to efficient analysis of dead-tree data. The current focus of this research is to complete the core functionality of an OCR engine as a proof of concept for further enhancement. The core functionality of an OCR engine can be defined as the ability to find and isolate blocks of text, lines and, finally, the character glyphs on an image, and then to quickly and correctly identify those glyphs. The research suggests the ability to sustain a rate of 1,000 pages of text per 3-4 seconds, per 1GB of memory on a GPU card, an speed-up to 500x when compared to current enterprise OCR solutions.Wenbin LiPhD Student (Hayes, TruszczyÅski)April 2, 2014Answer set tools and temporal consistency (Video)Abstract: The presentation is about the applicability and effectiveness of answer-set programming tools in the task of checking consistency of temporal software requirements. I present a translation from a formal language to the logic formalism that is accepted by the ASP solver, and the performance of the translation.Tariq IslamPhD Student (Jacobs)April 9, 2014Geo-Dependence of Human Face Appearance (Video)Abstract: The expected appearance of a human face depends strongly on age, ethnicity and gender. While these relationships are well-studied, our work explores the little-studied dependence of facial appearance on geographic location. To support this effort, we constructed GeoFaces, a large dataset of geo-tagged face images and applied different statistical tools to understand the geo-dependence of human faces.Yajie ZhaoPhD Student (Yang)April 9, 2014Video face beautification (Video)Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for face beautification. Unlike prior work that deals with single images, the proposed new framework is designed for video. It is able to improve both the appearance and the shape of a face. It adopts a state-of-the-art algorithm to synthesize and track 3D face models using blendshapes. The personalized 3D model can be edited to satisfy personal preference. This interactive process is needed only once per subject. Based on the tracking result and the modified face model, we present an algorithm to beautify the face in the video efficiently and consistently. We also develop a variant of content-preserving warping to reduce warping distortions along the face boundary. Finally, we adopt real-time bilateral filtering to remove wrinkles, freckles, and blemishes. This framework is evaluated on a set of videos. The experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate consistent and pleasant results over video frames while the original expressions and features are preserved.Ying ZhuPhD Student, CS (TruszczyÅski)April 16, 2014On Optimal Solutions of Answer Set Optimization Problems (Video)Abstract: Answer set optimization problems consist of two components: a logic program and a set of preference rules. Answer sets of the program represent possible outcomes, preferences determine a preorder on them. Of interest are answer sets of the program that are optimal wrt the preferences. In this work, we consider computational problems concerning optimal answer sets. We implement and study several methods for the problems of computing an optimal answer set; computing another one, once the first one is found; and computing an optimal answer set that is similar to (respectively, dissimilar from) a given interpretation. For the problems of the existence of similar and dissimilar optimal answer set we establish their computational complexity.Billy KidwellPhD student, CS (Hayes)April 16, 2014Clustering Software Fault Fixes: Toward Automated Fault Classification (Video)Abstract: Software fault classification is a widely used tool in software process improvement. We aim to improve software fault classification by developing a decision support system. This research extends an existing source code change taxonomy that was designed to analyze change coupling. The extension expands change types related to statements in order to achieve more granular data about the type of statement that is changed. The extended taxonomy is evaluated to determine if it can be applied to software fault analysis and become the input to a decision support system. We found that the extended change types occur consistently and with high frequency in fault fixes for Eclipse 2.0 and 3.0. Faults were then clustered according to the source code changes and analyzed. We found that the types and sizes of clusters are highly correlated, indicating some consistency in the patterns of the fault fixes. Finally, we performed an initial investigation to determine whether faults in the same cluster have similar characteristics. Our results indicate that many of the change types can be used to characterize the type of fault that has been fixed. However, some of the change types obfuscate the true nature of the fix. Ideas for improving the taxonomy based on these findings are provided.Beth WeeksEngineering Hall of Honor; ZilliantApril 23, 2014The Price is Right (Video)Abstract: Solving complex pricing decisions in the cloud with big data, science and business intelligence. A Business trifecta which delivers 5-10% improvement to the top and bottom line!Frank RobertsCS MS grad, 2013 (Finkel)April 23, 2014Concurrency model in Go (Video) (PDF)Abstract: I present Go's concurrency model and the tools the language provides to support it. I also present and discuss several Go concurrency idioms. I provide code examples and explain why I believe Go's model is a step forward in concurrent programming practice. Go's concurrency primitives are language-level. \"Share by communicating\" concisely expresses Go's concurrency model, which encourages composition of independently executing processes. Go's concurrency primitives provide a level of abstraction above the details of concurrent execution, communication, and synchronization, allowing the programmer to focus on a high-level model of a system. Concurrent designs that employ these tools and adhere to Go's concurrency model are often correct by construction.Brent SealesChair, CSAugust 27, 2014Welcome to the CS Department! (Video)Onur AscigilPhD student (Calvert, Griffioen)August 27, 2014Balancing Accountability and Privacy in the Network (Video)Abstract: This paper, by David Naylor et al, won the best-paper award at SigComm 2014. It introduces the Accountable and Private Internet Protocol (APIP), which splits source addresses into two separate fields â an accountability address and a return address â and introduces independent mechanisms for managing each. Accountability addresses, rather than pointing to hosts, point to accountability delegates, which agree to vouch for packets on their clients' behalf, taking appropriate action when misbehavior is reported. With accountability handled by delegates, senders are now free to mask their return addresses.Jinze LiuFaculty, CSSeptember 3, 2014Algorithms, Big Data and Personalized Medicine (Video)Abstract: The talk will present an example of a biomedical application on genomic biomarker discovery that ties together three areas of research: Algorithms, Big Data and Personalized Medicine.Zachary MayCS MS studentSeptember 3, 2014Amazing aspects of the Haskell Programming Language (Video)Abstract: I will introduce Haskell, a functional programming language with an emphasis on pure functions.

Current high-bandwidth data center network architectures often use rigid topologies. Recent studies propose to use random interconnects to provide growth flexibility. However, none of the existing solutions satisfies all three requirements well. We present a novel flexible data center network architecture, Space Shuffle (S2), which applies greedy routing on multiple ring spaces to achieve high-throughput, scalability, and flexibility. The proposed greedy routing protocol of S2 effectively exploits the path diversity of densely connected topologies and enables key-based routing.Ruigang YangFaculty, CSOctober 8, 2014Android and iOS programming (Video)Abstract: This talk gives a cursory overview of programming apps for the two main types of smartphone.Brent FarrAzure Solutions Specialist, MicrosoftOctober 15, 2014Microsoft Azure Cloud Overview (Video)Abstract: Websites, virtual machines, remote apps, storage, machine learning, and SQL in the cloud are just a few of the services being offered up by Microsoft's Azure cloud service. This session will consist of a demonstration of Microsoft Azure components and how they will impact future developers and IT professionals as they build and manage apps for mobile first, cloud first users.Mike LongAzure Technical Specialist, MicrosoftOctober 15, 2014An Historic View of High Performance Computing (Video)Abstract: Take a brief stroll through time and see how HPC, High Performance Computing, has changed your life and will continue to change your life. Multi-million dollar single processor Cray supercomputers were first used to pioneer automotive crashworthiness, aircraft design, drug design, weather forecasting, and espionage. Many of these same applications are run today on high end servers and clusters in on-premises datacenters , but are finding their way onto servers/clusters hosted in the cloud. Come learn about how this latest shift in computing paradigms will again change your life, and possibly your career.October 22, 2014October 22, 2014Jim Griffioen, Hussamuddin NasirFaculty, CS\n\nStaff, CSOctober 29, 2014Introduction to the ChoiceNet Future Internet Architecture (Video)Abstract: This talk will provide a brief introduction to the ChoiceNet Internet Architecture. ChoiceNet is designed to incentivize ISPs to develop and offer new innovative network layer services, and to be compensated for offering such services. We will demonstrate an early implementation of ChoiceNet in the context of the GENI network, and will show how users can make their own cost/benefit decisions using ChoiceNet.Ramakanth KavuluruFaculty, Biomedical informaticsOctober 29, 2014Algebraic classifiers (Video)Abstract: This talk is based on a 2013 ICML paper that shows how to use abstract algebraic structures for machine learning.Weihua LiuPhD Student (Klapper)November 5, 2014Rational approximation algorithms for analog feedback shift registers (Video)Abstract: Pseudo-random sequences are ubiquitous in modern electronics and information technology. High-speed generators of such sequences play essential roles in various engineering applications, such as stream ciphers, radar systems, multiple access systems, and quasi-Monte-Carlo simulation. Given a short prefix of a sequence, it is undesirable to have an efficient algorithm that can synthesize a generator that can predict the whole sequence. Otherwise, a cryptanalytic attack can be launched against the system based on that given sequence. So finding such a synthesis algorithm is an interesting problem in cryptanalysis. Algebraic feedback shift registers (AFSRs) are pseudo-random sequence generators that generalize linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) and feedback with carry shift registers (FCSRs). We describe an approximation algorithm that solves the AFSR synthesis problem based on low-dimensional lattice basis reduction. It works for AFSRs over quadratic integer rings with quadratic time complexity.Tingting YuFaculty, CSNovember 5, 2014Debugging virtual machines (Video)Abstract: Virtual machines are widely used for various kind of activities such as testing and malware analysis. However, little effort has been invested to test if the environment they provide is semantically equivalent to the environment found on real machines. This talk will present recent research on testing system virtual machines with specially crafted test cases.Anthony RiosPhD student (Kavuluru)November 12, 2014Data Science Workflow with IPython NotebookAbstract: IPython Notebook has become very popular in the data science community. It provides a web-based environment for editing/executing your code, displaying plots, and rich text editing. I will give an overview of IPython Notebook and discuss why you should use it for data science. I will also give a demo demonstrating many of the basic features of IPython Notebook.J. David SmithUndergradNovember 12, 2014Programming Languages and Code Quality (slides)Abstract: This talk describes a paper to be published in ACM SIGSOFT 2014. The paper uses a variety of statistical methods, including machine learning, to classify commit messages on GitHub in order to measure defect generation.Haden Pike\n\nStanley RosenbaumUndergrad\n\nMasters studentNovember 19, 2014Cocoa, Swift, and Playgrounds (Video)Abstract: Swift is a new programming language designed by Apple to be the successor to Objective-C on MacOS and iOS. Playgrounds are a tool to allow one to experiment and visually observe the operation of an algorithm. Most interesting about these new technologies is how they interact with existing Objective-C code. This talk will give an overview of these tools and features. We also discuss why Objective-C is not going away just yet.Xiongqi (Wesley) WuPhD student (Griffioen)November 19, 2014A Network-Path Advising Service (Video)Abstract: Unlike the current Internet where applications have little control over the path that their data travels, emerging network architectures enable applications to control the path their packets/flows take. Although an application can select its paths, providing an application with the up-to-date information needed to make an informed decision is a difficult problem. To tackle this problem, we introduce a new network path advising service (NPAS) that helps applications choose network paths.Radhakrishnan NagarajanFaculty, Biomedical InformaticsDecember 3, 2014Precision Medicine: Deciphering Patient-Specific Signatures (Video, Slides)Abstract: Several studies have successfully demonstrated marked variation in critical molecules across distinct disease groups. However, a majority of these studies implicitly subscribe to a \"one-size fits all\" norm that assumes the members within each of the disease groups to be homogeneous. Heterogeneity is ubiquitous and manifests across multiple scales. This presentation will investigate the choice of an ensemble classification approach that incorporates two-dimensional projections (convex hulls) of the molecular expression profiles in deciphering patient-specific signatures. Network abstractions of the ensemble sets will also be discussed.Hank DietzFaculty, ECEJanuary 14, 2015A little goes a long way (Video)Abstract: Didn't receive enough toys during the giving season to keep you busy playing throughout the new year? Did you spend most of your money? Here are a bunch of cool computer things to play with that you probably can still afford.Raphael FinkelFaculty, CSJanuary 14, 2015Quick guide to HTML (Video)Abstract: This light talk shows you the rudiments of building and verifying web pages. We'll touch on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, online validators, and developer tools in the browser.Judy GoldsmithFaculty, CSJanuary 21, 2015Using Science Fiction to Teach AI Ethics (Video)Abstract: The cultural and political implications of modern AI research are not some far-off concern; they are things that affect the world in the here and now. From advanced control systems with advanced visualizations and image processing techniques that drive the machines of the modern military to the slow creep of a mechanized workforce, ethical questions surround us. Part of dealing with these ethical questions is not just speculating on what could be but teaching our students how to engage with these ethical questions. We explore the use of science fiction as an appropriate tool to enable AI researchers to help engage students and the public on the current state and potential impacts of AI.Paul EberhartPhD Student, CSJanuary 21, 20153D printing for fun and profit (Video) (Slides)Abstract: In the last decade, the cost and complexity of 3D printing has come down from the realm of exotic industrial prototyping to something any hobbyist or researcher can do on the desk. This talk presents a review of the available 3D printing technology and a primer on the tools adequate to start planning to make your own objects.Zongming FeiFaculty, CSJanuary 28, 2015OpenFlow and Controller Programming (Video)Abstract: OpenFlow is an open standard that allows a controller to communicate with OpenFlow-enabled switches. The OpenFlow protocol defines messages such as packet-received, sending-packet-out, modifying-forwarding-table and getting-stats. In this talk, we will give an introduction to the OpenFlow protocol and how to program an OpenFlow controller to process packets and modify the fowarding ruls at the switches. We will briefly touch the current efforts in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) research to develop higher-level programming languages for OpenFlow controllers.Jacob ChappellCS JuniorJanuary 28, 2015JavaScript Minus the DOM (Video)Abstract: The Document Object Model (DOM) is an API for accessing and modifying the underlying structure of a Web page. JavaScript is a programming language that implements the DOM API. Unfortunately, JavaScript and the DOM are often misconstrued as one and the same. As a result, developers often blame JavaScript for problems that really arise from the DOM. But what happens when we step away from the DOM and focus on JavaScript as a language? In this talk, I will present several simple examples highlighting various features of the JavaScript language.Bill KidwellPhD student, CS (Hayes)February 4, 2015Toward a Learned Project-Specific Fault Taxonomy: Application of Software Analytics (Video)Abstract: Software analytics is a data-driven approach to enable software developers and software project managers to explore and analyze data. The goal of such analysis is to improve software products and processes. In this talk, we discuss some decisions where software analytics can be applied, and demonstrate that fault classification data can aid in this analysis and decision making. In addition, we argue that fault classification should be automated. We provide anecdotal evidence from our research where we cluster faults by syntactical change data. Finally, we present possible areas of research for software analytics using classified fault data and for improving the automation of fault classification.J. David SmithCS SeniorFebruary 4, 2015JavaScript and the Node.js runtime (Video)Abstract: I will demonstrate using JavaScript as a general-purpose scripting language using the Node.js runtime. I will show two scripts: one that automates interaction with the UK Secure WiFi login portal, and one that transforms images using FFI bindings to OpenCV. This talk is a followup to Jacob Chappell's talk on January 28.Jurek JaromczykCS FacultyFebruary 11, 2015What makes a good E-Day presentation (Video)Abstract: E-Day is an annual event that comes at the end of Engineers Week, founded by the National Society of Professional Engineers in 1951. The purpose of the Engineers Week is to celebrate the engineering profession and its contributions, but more importantly the entire week and the E-day are dedicated to promoting engineering and technology careers and to increase the public understanding of the role engineering plays in today's society. Our Computer Science department has been a part of the E-Day since joining the College of Engineering in 1994, so it is our 20th year of promoting Computer Science this way. In this talk, I will present the general structure of the computer science E-Day showcase, describe a few of many successful demos, and discuss our preparations for February 28th, 2015, this year's E-Day.Hamid HamrazPhD Student (Zhang)February 11, 2015Forest Modeling using Airborne Laser Scanning (Video)Abstract: Performing forest management activities manually through field work and interpreting aerial imagery is costly and labor-intensive. Airborne lidar technology is capable of building a 3D point cloud from the top surface of the objects on the ground. Modeling urban areas from lidar data has been successfully accomplished. However, in a heterogeneous wild forest, unlike an urban landscape, tree formations do not conform to a predefined geometric shape and size, and their spatial distribution is not uniform. In order to build a model containing individual-tree-level information, segmentation of individual trees within the point cloud is the critical starting point. After that, we can build a model for each individual tree based on its canopy shape and structure. For performing tree segmentation, previous work has focused on special types of forests and/or terrain conditions; these approaches are neither sufficiently robust nor generalizable. The current work starts by a novel tree-segmentation approach: any two distinct objects on the ground, if distinguishable from above, are likely to have horizontal spacing in between. The proposed approach tries to detect the gaps and extend them in order to segment individual trees. It completes the segmentation by finding the local maximum (the tree apex) and following the local maximum down the hill to reach the tree canopy borders.Wenbin LiPhD Student (Hayes, TruszczyÅski)February 18, 2015Towards More Efficient Requirements Formalization: A StudyAbstract: Validating natural-language requirements is an important but difficult task. Although there are techniques available for validating formalized requirements, the gap between natural language requirements and formalism is huge. As part of a larger piece of work on temporal requirements consistency checking, we have developed a front end to semi-automatically translate natural-language requirements into an formal language called Temporal Action Language or TeAL. This work is based on an underlying assumption that human analysts can assist us in filling in the missing pieces as we translate natural-language temporal requirements to TeAL. We performed a study to validate this assumption. We found that using the statements generated by our front-end tool appears to be more effective and efficient than a manual process.Richard SouvenirCS Faculty, UNC/CharlotteFebruary 25, 2015Supporting Large-Scale Ethnography with Automated Human Activity AnalysisAbstract: This is a department colloquium, not a Keeping Current seminar. Current approaches to evaluating designed spaces are limited by the time and expense of manual observation. In collaboration with architects and ethnographers, we are developing a system for sensing, storing, and analyzing human activity data over long time scales using a network of indoor cameras. The system relies on automated methods for people tracking and action recognition. In this talk, I will describe our approach to human detection and action recognition in multi-camera networks, which is a hybrid between (efficient) single-camera approaches and (accurate) multi-view methods. Our work is motivated by the observation that not all viewpoints in a multi-camera network are equal for recognizing actions and introduces dynamic viewpoint selection to improve processing time without sacrificing accuracy.Jeannette SuttonFaculty, CommunicationMarch 4, 2015Designing for disaster (Video)Abstract: Technological innovation can be designed for disaster, or it can become a disaster due to its design. I will discuss recent advances in alerts and warnings addressing the question: How can emergency risk information be effectively relayed via short messaging or social-media channels? Two research projects will be highlighted that demonstrate the links between the social and behavioral sciences and technological innovation.Chen QianFaculty, CSMarch 4, 2015A Customer Behavior Identification System using Passive RFID Tags (Video)Abstract: Different from online shopping, in-store shopping has few ways to collect the customer behavior before purchase. In a recent project, we design and implement an on-site Customer Behavior IDentification (CBID) system based on passive RFID tags. By collecting and analyzing wireless signal features, CBID can detect and track tag movements and further infer corresponding customer behaviors. We model three main objectives of behavior identification by concrete problems and solve them using novel protocols and algorithms. The design innovations of this work include a Doppler-effect based protocol to detect tag movements, an accurate Doppler frequency estimation algorithm, an image-based human count estimation protocol and a tag clustering algorithm using cosine similarity. We have implemented a prototype of CBID in which all components are built out of off-the-shelf devices. We have deployed CBID in real environments and conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of CBID in customer behavior identification.Haden PikeUndergrad, CSMarch 11, 2015CAPTCHA and Accessibility (Video)Abstract: Differentiating humans and computers is an important task for a web service to perform with high reliability. In this talk, I argue that the current methods for this task are flawed, firstly from a business perspective, but mainly from an accessibility viewpoint. This discussion also outlines a general framework for evaluating accessible applications and services.Frank RichardsonPhD Student, CS (Finkel)March 11, 2015Picking a Perfect NCAA Bracket (Video)Abstract: Every year, thousands of college basketball fans predict the outcome of the NCAA tournament in the hopes of obtaining bragging rights or even monetary gain. In recent history, Warren Buffet has offered one billion dollars to anyone who could predict the winner of every game of the NCAA tournament. So far, there have been no known instances of anyone accomplishing this task. In truth, the only \"perfect\" NCAA brackets are those created after the tournament is over. Using simulation software, a fan can \"play\" each game prior to the actual tournament and generate a bracket based on the results. This presentation will demonstrate the process that I followed in developing my own simulation software. The techniques I used can also be utilized in data mining, game development, sales forecasting, and other applications.Ting GuPhD Student, CS (Klapper)March 25, 2015Distribution properties of FCSR sequences (Video)Abstract: Pseudo-random sequences have a wide area of applications to spread-spectrum communication systems, radar systems, signal synchronization, simulation, and cryptography. The pseudo-random sequences in a good family should (a) be easy to generate (possibly with hardware or software), (b) have good distribution properties that make them appear (statistically) to be random, and (c) arise from some underlying algebraic structure so they can be analyzed using standard mathematical tools. (Of course other properties are desired as well, depending upon the application.) This talk introduces two types of sequences that enjoy the above properties. They are the maximum-period linear-feedback shift-register sequences (m-sequences) and the maximum-period feedback-with-carry shift-register sequences (l-sequences). At the end of the talk, I will briefly describe my paper on the distribution properties of half-l-sequences.Raphael FinkelCS FacultyMarch 25, 2015Reasoning about Conditional Constraint Specifications (Video)Abstract: Conditional constraint satisfaction problems (CCSPs) and feature models (FMs) have been developed to represent configuration problems in a natural way. CCSPs include potential variables, which might or might not exist in any given solution, as well as classical variables, which are required to take a value in every solution. CCSPs model, for example, options on a car, for which the style of sunroof (a variable) only makes sense if the car has a sunroof at all. FMs are directed acyclic graphs of features with constraints on edges. We show that existing techniques from formal methods and answer set programming can be used to naturally model CCSPs and FMs. Our configurators automatically reason about the model itself, enumerating all solutions and discovering several kinds of model flaws.Sifei HanPhD Student, CS (Kavuluru)April 1, 2015On Assessing the Sentiment of General Tweets (Video)Abstract: With the explosion of publicly accessible social data, sentiment analysis has emerged as an important task with applications in e-commerce, politics, and social sciences. Researchers have largely focused on sentiment analysis of texts involving entities such as products, persons, institutions, and events. A significant amount of chatter on microblogging websites may not be directed at a particular entity. On Twitter, users share information on their general state of mind, details about how their day went, their plans for the next day, or just conversational chatter. We look into assessing sentiment in the publicly available general stream of tweets. We can then assess the overall sentiment in a geographic location or for a set of users (scoped through some means), which has applications in social sciences, psychology, and health sciences. We first determine the proportion of positive/negative/neutral tweets from a set of 1000 randomly curated tweets. Next we use a combination of an existing dataset with our dataset and conduct experiments to achieve new state-of-the-art results using a large set of features. Our results demonstrate that methods that work best for tweets containing popular named entities may not work well for general tweets.Maria Ramos-MoralesMS Student, CS (Kavuluru)April 1, 2015Identification of Useful User Comments in Social Media (Video)Abstract: This talk presents a paper by Elaheh Momeni, K. Tao and B. Haslhofer that focuses on creating an automated approach for identifying useful user comments in a social media website. They use a machine learning classification algorithm (supervised learning) for this, and most of the paper talks about what features to pick for the algorithm. The authors focus on the website Flickr: The Commons, which is a website where people and organizations post historic photographs for which it is hoped that the website's users may comment useful information that they may know about the photo, such as the people in it, the place it was taken, and what event happened in it. In the paper it is stated that 'useful' comments will vary among websites. In their case study, a comment is useful if it adds supplemental information to an existing digital resource, which might be interesting for other users.Jacob ChappellCS UndergraduateApril 8, 2015Middleboxes: Love 'em and Hate 'em (Video)Abstract: The Internet has come a long way. Unfortunately, the model in which an end user connects to the Internet via an ISP still stands. ISP monopolies like Time Warner therefore hold all the keys to your traffic. In recent years, packet-inspecting and -modifying devices known as \"middleboxes\" have begun to pop up. Come learn about how middleboxes inhibit progress in the Internet and how users and protocol developers are fighting back.Tingting YuCS FacultyApril 8, 2015Guided Test Generation for Finding Worst-Case Stack Usage in Embedded Systems (Video)Abstract: Embedded systems are challenging to program correctly, because they use an interrupt-programming paradigm and run in resource-constrained environments. This situation leads to a class of faults for which we need customized verification techniques. One such class of faults, stack overflows, are caused when the combination of active methods and interrupt invocations on the stack grows too large, and these faults can lead to data loss and other significant device failures. Developers need to estimate the worst-case stack usage (WCSU) during system design, but determining the actual maximum value is known to be a hard problem. The state of the art for calculating WCSU uses static analysis; however this analysis has a tendency to over-approximate the potential stack, which can lead to wasted resources. Dynamic techniques such as random testing often under-approximate the WCSU. In this work, we present SimStack, a framework that utilizes a combination of static analysis and a genetic algorithm to search for WCSUs.Xin LiPhD student, CS (Qian)April 15, 2015Low-Complexity Multi-Resource Packet Scheduling for Network Function Virtualization (Video)Abstract: Network functions are widely deployed in modern networks. Various virtual network function instances can be consolidated into one physical middlebox. Packet processing for different flows consumes different hardware resources in the middlebox. Based on the fact that most Internet traffic is contributed by a small fraction of \"elephant flows\", a novel low-complexity and space-efficient packet-scheduling algorithm, Myopia, is proposed to support multi-resource fair sharing.Sumaira ShamimMS student, CS (Griffioen)April 15, 2015Virtualization Technology and Docker (Video)Abstract: This talk is an overview of different virtualization technologies and Docker. We describe how Docker works and how it differs from Virtual Machines.Brian Asher, Jason Bishop, Mark Calchera, Taylor Mitchell, Ashley PoeCS499 studentsApril 22, 2015Measuring patient progress using a \"Smart Chair\"Abstract: Over 330,000 THAs (hip replacements) and 710,000 TKAs (knee replacements) are performed each year. A difficult problem is finding objective measurements of progress or regression before and after these surgeries. The \"Smart Chair\" aims to solve this problem. The Smart Chair is a joint project sponsored by the University of Kentucky Hospital Center for Biomedical Engineering, split between two student teams. A team of five mechanical engineering students is responsible for designing the physical chair and sensors. This talk describes the work of the computer science team designing an embedded system to harvest the data and a front-end client system to process it.Thomas Loy, Stephen Parsons, John WalkerCS499 studentsApril 22, 2015Visualizing layered image setsAbstract: Inspired by a need to better understand how ancient manuscripts physically degrade over time, we are developing a tool to visualize layered sets of tiled images. Multiple layers, or photographs of the same object, can be viewed simultaneously. Previously when observing changes in between image layers, users had to flip between images. With only two layers, some side-by-side comparison is useful through a slider interface. However, such direct comparison is not possible with three or more layers. Our novel interface allows a user to visualize changes among any number of layers easily and without needing complex software tools such as Adobe Photoshop. The \"flashlight\" concept allows intuitive viewing of layered sets of tiled images.Brent SealesChair, CSSeptember 2, 2015Welcome to the CS DepartmentAbstract: Dr. Seales will give a talk on the state of our department.Anthony RiosPh.D. student (Kavuluru)Convolutional Neural Networks for Biomedical Text Classification: Application in Indexing Biomedical ArticlesAbstract: Building high accuracy text classifiers is an important task in biomedicine given the wealth of information hidden in unstructured narratives such as research articles and clinical documents. In this presentation I will discuss how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can outperform traditional approaches in biomedical text classification.Jane HayesFaculty, CSSeptember 9, 2015Inherent Characteristics of Traceability Artifacts -- Less is MoreAbstract: This paper describes ongoing work to characterize the inherent ease or âtraceabilityâ with which a textual artifact can be traced using an automated technique. Software traceability approaches use varied measures to build models that automatically recover links between pairs of natural language documents. Thus far, most of the approaches use a single-step model, such as logistic regression, to identify new trace links. However, such approaches require a large enough training set of both true and false trace links. Yet, the former are by far in the minority, which reduces the performance of such models. Therefore, this paper formulates the problem of identifying trace links as the problem of finding, for a given logistic regression model, the subsets of links in the training set giving the best accuracy (in terms of G-metric) on a test set. Using hill climbing with random restart for subset selection, we found that, for the ChangeStyle dataset, we can classify links with a precision of up to 40% and a recall of up to 66% using a training set as small as one true candidate link (out of 33) and 41 false links. To get better performance and learn the best possible logistic regression classifier, we must âdiscardâ links in the trace dataset that increase noise to avoid learning with links that are not representative. This preliminary work is promising because it shows that few correct examples may perform better than several poor ones. It also shows which inherent characteristics of the artifacts make them good candidates to learn efficient traceability models automatically, i.e., it reveals their traceability.Sergio Rivera P.Ph.D. student (Fei and Griffioen)Providing a High Level Abstraction for SDN Networks in GENIAbstract: One problem in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is that the end users need to map high level abstractions -- like the path a flow should take -- to a set of low level forwarding rules tailored to, and installed at, every switch along the path. Installing such rules manually is tedious and error prone, and writing a controller program to do it is equally, if not more, challenging. We propose a new set of tools that allow users (experimenters) to easily map their high level routing policies to low level OpenFlow rules, and to help users reverse engineer high level policies from the installed set of low level flow rules. The tools provide users with the abstraction of end-to-end flows that users can install, list, and delete. The tools automatically handle the details of computing and installing all the rules needed to implement end-to-end flows, and are also capable of identifying flows and, if desired, removing flows that already exist. The tools have been implemented as modules in the GENI Desktop providing users with a graphical interface to their flows. In addition, we have implemented a module to monitor the performance of flows that have been installed. We describe our prototype implementation and present performance numbers obtained via the service.Brian PulitoIBM (hosted by Griffioen)September 16, 2015WebRTC: Real-Time Communications at Internet SpeedAbstract: What if real-time communications was born on the web? Would we use context instead of telephone numbers to initiate real-time interactions? Would quality and ubiquity be less important than flexibility and differentiation? WebRTC is changing the way people communicate in real-time. Whether it be Google Hangouts or a web startup, WebRTC is free, simple and coming to a web page near you. This discussion will focus on this emerging HTML5 standard, providing insights into how developers and businesses are using WebRTC to drive innovation in their Systems of Engagement.Antonio CarzanigaUniv. of Southern Switzerland (hosted by Calvert)September 23, 2015Measuring the Mixing Time of a NetworkAbstract: Mixing time is a global property of a network that indicates how fast a random walk gains independence from its starting point. Mixing time is an essential parameter for many distributed algorithms, but especially those based on gossip. In this talk I will present a completely decentralized algorithm to measure the mixing time of a network. The algorithm is based on an interesting application of a classic control-theoretic algorithm. In particular, the algorithm models the diffusion of information seen from each node in the network as the impulse response of a particular dynamic system. I will present the essential ideas behind the algorithm, as well as practical aspects of its design and implementation.Frank A. RichardsonPh.D. studentDefense Strategies for Sybil Attacks on Social NetworksAbstract: Sybil defense schemes work by detecting local communities (i.e., clusters of nodes more tightly knit than the rest of the graph) around a trusted node. Networks with well-defined community structure, such as social networks, are inherently more vulnerable to Sybil attacks. Sybils can carefully target their social network links in order to make their attacks more effective. This presentation will briefly describe some recent tools for defending against Sybil Attacks.Rama KavuluruFaculty, Biomedical Informatics & CSSeptember 30, 2015Analyzing the Moving Parts of a Large-Scale Multi-Label Text Classification Pipeline: Experiences in Indexing Biomedical ArticlesAbstract: Multilabel classification deals with the problem of assigning multiple categories from a fixed label space to each input instance. In this talk I will discuss our experiences in configuring various components of a large scale multi-label text classification pipeline and the corresponding effects on its classification performance. Our final system came in 2nd place in one of the batches of the recently concluded BioASQ competition: http://bioasq.org/participate/third-challenge-winnersHuazhe WangPh.D. student (Qian)Practical Network-wide Packet Behavior Identification by AP ClassifierAbstract: Identifying the network-wide forwarding behaviors of a packet is essential for many network management applications, including rule verification, policy enforcement, traffic engineering, and fault localization. Current tools that can perform packet behavior identification either incur large time and memory costs or do not support real-time updates. In this talk, I will present AP Classifier, a control plane tool for packet behavior identification. AP Classifier is developed based on the concept of atomic predicates which can be used to characterize the forwarding behaviors of packets. Experiments using the data plane network state of two real networks show that the processing speed of AP Classifier is faster than existing tools by at least an order of magnitude. Furthermore, AP Classifier uses very small memory and is able to support real-time updates.Zhaohong WangPh.D. student (Samson Cheung)October 7, 2015Secure Multiparty Computation and ApplicationsAbstract: In this talk, we provide a short tutorial on secure multi-party computation or Secure MPC for providing privacy protection of sensitive information in distributed processing of multimedia signals. Secure MPC is an active area of research in cryptology. In recent years, it has been successfully applied to solve many privacy protection problems in distributed signal processing, including face recognition, iris matching, image denoising, video surveillance, visualization, information retrieval, etc. Our goal is to introduce the core building blocks of Secure MPC that can be used to build sophisticated signal processing algorithms.Zongming FeiFaculty, CSHeader Space Analysis: Static Checking For NetworksAbstract: This is a paper by Kazemian, Varghese and McKeown (Stanford & UCSD). Todayâs networks typically carry or deploy dozens of protocols and mechanisms simultaneously such as MPLS, NAT, ACLs and route redistribution. Even when individual protocols function correctly, failures can arise from the complex interactions of their aggregate, requiring network administrators to be masters of detail. Our goal is to automatically find an important class of fail- ures, regardless of the protocols running, for both operational and experimental networks. To this end we developed a general and protocol-agnostic framework, called Header Space Analysis (HSA). Our formalism allows us to statically check network specifications and configurations to identify an important class of failures such as Reachability Failures, Forwarding Loops and Traffic Isolation and Leakage problems. In HSA, we look at the entire packet header as a concatenation of bits without any associated meaning. Each packet is a point in the {0,1}^L space where L is the maximum length of a packet header, and networking boxes transform packets from one point in the space to another point or set of points (multicast). We created a library of tools, called Hassel, to implement our framework, and used it to analyze a variety of networks and protocols.Xudong LiuPh.D. student (Truszczynski)October 21, 2015Personalizability of Trip PlanningAbstract: I will talk about, on a high level, the R&D internship I had last summer in the Representation and Planning area at the Palo Alto Research Center. My work there was focused on the personalization aspect of trip planning, i.e., representing and reasoning with user constraints and preferences in a trip planner, and it was related to my graduate research here at UK. I will also talk about my experience in the bay area outside of the company.Xinxin ZuoPh.D. student (Yang)Interactive Visual Hull Refinement for Specular and Transparent Object Surface ReconstructionAbstract: 3D reconstruction of specular or transparent objects is still a challenging problem in computer vision. Due to their non-Lambertian surface reflectance properties, establishing correspondences becomes difficult. Instead of using additional active illumination, I will present our method using multi-view images captured with a hand-held camera. Since stereo correspondences are no longer valid in this case, we have developed a novel method based on visual hull. In this talk, I will introduce the basic geometric analysis of our method and the whole pipeline for 3D reconstruction of specular or transparent objects.Clinton Woodson & Xue HanPh.D. students (Hayes and Yu)October 28, 2015Measuring Requirement Quality to Predict TestabilityAbstract: Software bugs contribute to the cost of ownership for consumers in a software-driven society and can potentially lead to devastating failures. Software testing, including functional testing and structural testing, remains a common method for uncovering faults and assessing dependability of software systems. To enhance testing effectiveness, the developed artifacts (requirements, code) must be designed to be testable. Prior work has developed many approaches to address the testability of code when applied to structural testing, but to date no work has considered approaches for assessing and predicting testability of requirements to aid functional testing. In this work, we address requirement testability from the perspective of requirement understandability and quality using a machine learning and statistical analysis approach.Qing ZhangPh.D. student (Yang)Fast Human Body Scanning and Auto MeasurementAbstract: In this talk, I will introduce a human 3D full body scanning system with a medical application for auto body measurement. Although acquiring high quality 3D data is not a novel research topic and can be achieved using various existing techniques, it is still nontrivial to build up a complete 3D human model without any user intervention, due to the body movement, data incompleteness and occlusions. To overcome such problems, our system uses a surrounding setup consisting of multiple high-speed structured-light scanners to take an almost complete scanning in one shot and then handles the data misalignment in a global non-rigid registration scheme, which provides a visual plausible 3D model with high resolution textures. Moreover, we developed a statistically human template fitting approach to fill missing data, and the fitted parametric model also provides robust human body measurement and landmark detection. Our qualitative and quantitative results will be shown in my talk.GQ ZhangDirector, Institute of Biomedical InformaticsNovember 4, 2015From Computer Science to Translational Informatics: Examples and Lessons LearnedAbstract: This talk will present the defining characteristics of translational informatics, illustrated using specific research program examples. Thoughts on opportunity, value, challenge and potential pitfalls of team science, a key mode of operation for translational science, will be shared. Interfaces and synergies around the emerging topic of data science, from a translational and team science point of view, will be discussed. Relevant UK campus resources and infrastructure for advancing translational science will be overviewed.Judy GoldsmithFaculty, CSNovember 11, 2015The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing 2015Abstract: The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing is an annual conference, started in 1994. In 1994, 500 women attended. In October 2015, 12,000+ people attended. Wikipedia quotes the conference website as saying âThe Grace Hopper Celebration consists of a combination of technical sessions and career sessions and includes a poster session, career fair, awards ceremony, and more. The conference features 650 presenters. Potential presenters submit proposals for panels, workshops, presentations, Birds of a Feather sessions, New Investigators papers, PhD Forum, and Poster Session, including ACM Student Research Competition.â\n\nDr. Goldsmith was one of the 12,000+ attendees. She will describe the conference, give highlights of a few presentations, and describe the experience.\n\nThe Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing is presented by the Anita Borg Institute for Women in Technology and the Association for Computing Machinery.Nathan Jacobs, Ryan Baltenberger, Mohammad T. Islam, Scott Workman and Tawfiq SalemFaculty and Ph.D. students, CSNovember 18, 2015Computer Vision Applications of Deep Convolutional Neural NetworksAbstract: For the past 5 years Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been dramatically improving the state-of-the-art on a wide variety of computer vision problems, approaching, and often exceeding, human accuracy. These advances have been made possible by a combination of factors: massive datasets, faster processing hardware, larger memories, (relatively) easy-to-use software abstractions, and some seemingly simple low-level components. There are many exciting research directions currently being pursued: how do we design and train CNNs for specific tasks? how can we understand what these networks are really learning? and how can we make training CNNs easier? This talk provides a broad overview of CNNs and their use in computer vision, as well as several examples of research being conducted at the University of Kentucky Department of Computer Science.Mirek TruszczynskiFaculty, CSDecember 2, 2015The Winograd Schema ChallengeAbstract: I will discuss an alternative to the Turing Test, known as the Winograd Schema Challenge. It shares some similarities with the original and it also has important differences. It involves responding to English sentences, and English-speaking adults have no difficulty with it. However, unlike the original, the subject is not required to engage in a conversation, and having access to a large corpus of English text might not be of help. In the talk, I will define the schema and present arguments suggesting its weaknesses. The presentation will be based on two papers,\n\nThe Winograd Schema Challenge, by Levesque, Davis and Morgenstern (Proceedings of KR 2012), and\n\nThe Winograd Schema Challenge and Reasoning about Correlation, by Bailey, Harrison, Lierler, Lifschitz and Michael (unpublished manuscript).Ray HyattPh.D. student (Marek)A Current Security Threat Survey based on two prominent Security BloggersAbstract: A survey of current security threats for a six month period in 2015 as chronicled by two prominent security researcher's online blogs: Schneider on Security (Bruce Schneider) https://www.schneier.com/ and Krebs on Security (Brian Krebs) https://krebsonsecurity.com.James HunsuckerM.S. student (Jaromczyk)January 27, 2016Making Modern Web ApplicationsAbstract: At this talk I will discuss the Single Page Application design model and the technologies behind it. We will also look at how this design is implemented in my masters project The Great Smoky Mountains Mobile Backcountry CompanionXin LiPh.D. student (Qian)An NFV Orchestration Framework for Interference-free Policy EnforcementAbstract: Network functions virtualization is a new paradigm to offer flexibility of software network function processing on demand. Policy enforcement satisfies network function policies that requires flows to traverse through given sequences of network functions. We summarize three desired properties of virtual network function placement, namely policy enforcement, interference freedom, and resource isolation. However, none of existing solutions can satisfy all of them. In this paper, we present a novel SDN-based NFV orchestration framework, called APPLE, to enforce network function policies while providing the above properties.Licong CuiDivision of Biomedical Informatics, UK, Faculty candidateFebruary 3, 2016Ontology Quality Assurance and Data Integration in Biomedicine ( Video Part 1, Part 2)Abstract: Health-related data is growing rapidly and represents a valuable source of under-utilized biomedical knowledge. Such data includes structured phenotypic data and signal data captured in clinical settings, free-text clinical notes, and unstructured and semi-structured health-related information on the web. In order to take advantage of such data to advance biomedical discovery and improve health care, we must overcome challenges in translating such data into actionable information. Methods and techniques for addressing such challenges include but are not limited to biomedical ontology quality assurance, information extraction and text mining, data integration and management, information retrieval, and evaluation of information retrieval interfaces. In this talk, I will focus on two themes: (1) quality assurance of biomedical ontologies; and (2) biomedical data integration, management, and retrieval. First, I will introduce a big data approach to auditing 'big biomedical knowledge' such as the Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) and mining abnormal patterns. Second, I will present an ontology-guided approach to integrating and retrieving biomedical data for an informatics infrastructure used in two NIH-funded national centers.Gokhan BakalPh.D. student (Kavuluru)February 10, 2016Predicting Treatment Relations with Semantic Patterns over Biomedical Knowledge GraphsAbstract: In this talk, we will present an intuitive approach that exploits path patterns over imprecise biomedical knowledge graphs to predict treatment relations between biomedical entities. Our results show that graph based approaches can strongly complement natural language processing techniques in biomedical relation extraction.Dean CrockettUndergrad (Jaromczyk)The UK ACM: Bringing Code Out of the ClassroomAbstract: The UK chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery is a student organization, dedicated to building a culture on campus for computer science students. Over the past year, our members have made enormous strides bringing developers and engineers together into an active and passionate community. Since last spring, our chapter has more than doubled in size- now over 50 students strong. Our members form a collaborative group dedicated to bettering themselves as students, as programmers, and as employees. In this talk, I will cover the programs and events that have led to our chapter's successful year, and how they have made an impact on the computer science community here at UK. These events include Startup Weekend, Local Hack Day, and CatHacks, Kentucky's only national college hackathon. I will also discuss the coming events with which we hope to continue our expansion, and the reasons why we encourage students to get involved with our chapter.Juw Won ParkUniv. of Louisville (hosted by Liu)February 17, 2016Big Data and Systems Biology Approaches to Explore Transcriptome and RNA Regulatory NetworksAbstract: The high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has provided a powerful tool for transcriptome analysis. Due to the dramatic decrease in cost, it became quite common to generate millions and billions of sequence reads from a given RNA sample to identify/quantify the abundance of mRNA isoforms across the entire transcriptome. Large consortium projects also started generating massive RNA-seq data on tens of thousands of samples along with various other genomic/phenotypic measurements. However, the extraordinary potentials embedded in these large, complex datasets cannot be fully recognized without the development of proper methods for analyzing these big transcriptome and genome datasets. In this presentation, I will discuss my recent efforts in developing computational and statistical methods for the analysis of transcriptome isoform complexity and RNA regulatory networks using RNA-seq datasets.Jamie PaytonUniversity of North Carolina at Charlotte, faculty candidateFebruary 24, 2016, 3:00pmPervasive Sensing: From Protocols to PeopleAbstract: Pervasive sensing can enhance our understanding of the world around us and enables a wide range of context-aware applications. Applications that rely on such data should be provided with an understanding of the quality of information acquired from remote sensors. In the first part of my talk, I will describe our self-assessing query protocols, which report the fidelity achieved during distributed execution over a wireless sensor network. In the second part of my talk, I will describe how the vast mobile sensor network of people with smartphones can be used to collect, analyze, and share data about the surrounding environment and human experiences at an unprecedented scale, without requiring the purchase of specialized sensors or the installation, administration, and maintenance of a wireless sensor network infrastructure. This introduction of humans into the pervasive sensing loop brings new research challenges. I will address the issues of characterizing the quality of information received from people in crowdsensing campaigns and motivating users to contribute data that meets quality of information requirements.Richard SouvenirUniversity of North Carolina at Charlotte, faculty candidate4:00pmWeakly Supervised Learning for Image and Video AnalysisAbstract: Many modern computer vision methods rely on large-scale labeled datasets to train supervised algorithms. Due to the proliferation of cameras and ease with which images and videos can be stored and shared, amassing large datasets for a variety of problems is relatively easy. However, obtaining ground truth annotations at a large scale usually involves crowdsourcing or other expensive and/or potentially inaccurate methods. In some cases, we can take advantage of the inherent structure of natural image sets and sidestep the costs of curating large, annotated datasets. In this talk, I will describe problems that can be addressed in weakly supervised settings, where the data labels are missing, noisy, and/or ambiguous. This talk will cover three of our recent methods for image and video analysis: (1) human action recognition in multi-camera networks that leverages ambiguous data for recognizing actions and dynamic viewpoint selection; (2) label correction for large-scale image sets; and (3) semi-supervised multi-output image manifold regression for segmentation and pose estimation. These methods are components of interdisciplinary collaborative projects with architects, ethnographers, and physicians.Neil MooreCS, First-Year Engineering Program FYE faculty candidateMarch 2, 2016Why the Grass is Greener: Bioinformatical Analysis of Fungal Endophytes of GrassesAbstract: Fungi in the genus EpichloÃ«, because they form symbiotic relationships with grasses used as crops, as forage, and as ornamentation, have a great agriculturally significance. EpichloÃ« festucae in particular has a unique connection to agriculture in Kentucky: It is responsible for the notable hardiness and drought-tolerance of the grass strain 'Kentucky 31 Tall Fescue' (which you may well have in your lawn), but also for the initially unexpected toxicity of this grass to cattle and other livestock.\n\nIn an effort to understand the biology behind E. festucae and other fungal endophytes of grasses, the Fungal Endophytes Genome Project was establised as a large-scale collaborative project to investigate the molecular biology, host interactions, and evolution of EpichloÃ« and related genera. The project, which includes researchers in Plant Pathology, Computer Science, Statistics, and other fields both at UK and throughout the world, has sequenced the genomes of over fifty different strains of fungi. Collecting data is not enough, though: bioinformatical analysis is vital for bridging the gap between sequencing and understanding. In this talk I will discuss my work as a bioinformaticist with the Endophytes project, including but not limited to ongoing research on analyzing evolutionary relationships among organisms and among those organisms' genes.Nivan FerreiraUniversity of Arizona, faculty candidateMarch 9, 2016Interactive Visualization Techniques for Urban Data AnalysisAbstract: The explosion in the volume of data about urban environments has opened up opportunities to better inform both policy and administration, and thereby to help governments to overcome constant challenges of improving/increasing the quality of public services and promoting sustainable development. By taking advantage of the modern computer graphics and the power of the human visual system, interactive visualization techniques have been shown to be powerful tools that help making sense of large collections of data. In this talk, I will describe recent data visualization techniques designed to allow analysts to interactively explore and analyze large collections of urban data. These techniques include visual and algorithmic aspects and have been applied to help domain experts in the fields of urban planning, transportation engineering, and architecture.Ye YuPh.D. student (Qian)March 23, 2016Fast Hashing and CONCISE Forwarding Information BaseAbstract: We propose a Concise hashing scheme that can be used for the classification query problem: maintain a group of disjoint sets, for each query, given a particular element that belongs to the union of the sets, return the index of the set that contains the element. Compared to other solutions such as stl::map and Cuckoo Hashing, our algorithm uses much smaller memory and only requires worst case constant lookup time. Using this algorithm, we develop and implement a forwarding information base (FIB) of location-independent names. Experimental results show that Concise uses significantly smaller memory to achieve faster name query speed compared to existing FIBs for name switching.Zongming FeiFaculty, CSGo & AlphaGoAbstract: In March 2016, the AlphaGo program developed by Google DeepMind in London beat Lee Sedol of South Korea in a five-game match (4 to 1). This is the the first time a computer program has beaten a 9-dan prefessional Go player and has reignited the debate of whether machine intelligence will surpass human intelligence. This talk will give an introduction to the game of Go and the AlphaGo program. It will discuss the search architecture and deep convolutional neural networks used by the AlphaGo program. Here is a link for playing Go http://playgo.to/iwtg/en/ .Pat WhitlowDirector, Office of Nationally Competitive Awards, UKMarch 30, 2016External Scholarships for Undergraduate and Graduate StudentsAbstract: In this talk, Dr. Whitlow will tell you how to get external money to support your undergraduate and graduate studies. There are many nationally competitive scholarships and fellowships that are funded by sources independent of the University of Kentucky including non-profit groups, government agencies, and companies. They are definitely some valuable resources you should explore.Christina Campbell, Mami HayashidaUndergrad and M.S. StudentsTRIWIC Conference 2016Abstract: The Tri-State Women in Computing Conference (TRIWIC) is a a regional ACM-W Celebration of Women in Computing. It is a small conference that has been growing in popularity and attendance for a few years. The goal of the conference is to provide an opportunity for women from Kentucky, greater Cincinnati and surrounding areas to meet women in their fields and receive mentoring and leadership from senior women.\n\nChristina Campbell and Mami Hayashida were among the six UK students who attend the conference in late February. They will discuss the conference, their reasons for attending, notable speakers, and their personal takeaways from the experience.Xue HanGrad Student (Hayes and Yu)April 6, 2016, 4:00-4:30Predicting Testability of Concurrent ProgramsAbstract: Concurrent programs are difficult to test due to their inherent non-determinism. To address the nondeterminism problem, testing often requires the exploration of thread schedules of a program; this can be time-consuming for testing real-world programs. We believe that testing resources can be distributed more effectively if testability of concurrent programs can be estimated, so that developers can focus on exploring the low testable code. Voas introduces a notion of testability as the probability that a test case will fail if the program has a fault, in which testability can be measured based on fault-based testing and mutation analysis. Much research has been proposed to analyze testability and predict defects for sequential programs, but to date, no work has considered testability prediction for concurrent programs, with program characteristics distinguished from sequential programs. In this talk, we present an approach to predict testability of concurrent programs at the function level. We propose a set of novel static code metrics based on the unique properties of concurrent programs. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we build a family of testability prediction models combining both static metrics and a test suite metric and apply it to real projects. Our empirical study reveals that our approach is more accurate than existing sequential program metrics.Clinton WoodsonGrad Student (Hayes and Yu)4:30-4:45An Introduction to TraceLabAbstract: I will show a brief overview of the TraceLab workbench for Software Engineering tracing experiments, including a demo and talk about component creation.Tarannum ZamanGrad Student (Hayes and Yu)4:45-5:00An Introduction to PIN instrumentation frameworkAbstract: Pin is a dynamic binary instrumentation framework for the IA-32 and x86-64 instruction-set architectures that enables the creation of dynamic program analysis tools. The tools created using Pin, called Pintools, can be used to perform program analysis on user space applications in Linux and Windows. The instrumentation is performed at at run time on the compiled binaries and thus requires no recompiling of source code. Pin provides a rich API that abstracts away the underlying instruction-set idiosyncrasies and allows context information such as register contents to be passed to the injected code as parameters. In this talk, we will demo several examples on how to write Pintools to instrument and monitor program executions. We will then show our recent work on using Pin to detect system-level data races.Roman YampolskiyUniv. of Louisville (hosted by Goldsmith)April 13, 2016Cyber Security and Artificial IntelligenceAbstract: This is a department colloquium, not a Keeping Current seminar. Dr. Roman Yampolskiy, an Associate Professor at the Computer Engineering and Computer Science department of the University of Louisville, will introduce audience to his research on current and future Cyber Security challenges. Particular topics covered in the lecture will include: 1) Biometrics - Human identity recognition and verification. 2) Artimetrics - a field of study aimed at identifying, classifying and authenticating robots, software and virtual reality agents for security, customization and other purposes. 3) Forensic recovery of data encoded in DNA. 4) Bot prevention via reversed Turing Tests. 5) Security and Safety of Artificially Intelligent Systems.Victor MarekFaculty, CSApril 20, 2016Partition Property for Pythagorean TriplesAbstract: A Pythagorean triple is a triple of positive integers (x,y,z) so that x^2 + y^2 = z^2.\n\nAn old conjecture of Erdos and Graham was that for any coloring of the set of all integers, N, into a finite number of colors, there is a monochromatic Pythagorean triple.\n\nThe conjecture is not settled as yet after something like 50 years of being proposed. However, if we limit the number of colors to two (i.e. decompose N in the union of N1 and N2) this limited conjecture turns out to be true. Specifically, the number 7825 has the property that for any coloring of [1..7825] with two colors there is a monochromatic Pythagorean triple. Moreover there is a coloring of [1..7824] with two colors without a monochromatic Pythagorean triple.\n\nErdos and Graham offered $500 for the solution of full conjecture. When this did not happen, R. Graham offered $100 for solving the 2-coloring problem described above. Now, this limited conjecture is solved in positive.\n\nDistinction between the result described above and similar results on so-called Ramsey numbers and van der Waerden numbers (obtained previously by McKay and Radziszowski and by Kouril) is that the reported work is done using so-called SAT solver, and is suppo"
