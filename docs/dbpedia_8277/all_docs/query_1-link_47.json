        "text": "pydo is a free software command line task manager built in Python.\n\nWhy another CLI Task Manager?\n\nTaskwarrior has been the gold standard for CLI task managers so far. However, It has the following inconveniences:\n\nIt uses a plaintext file as data storage.\n\nIt stores the data in a non standard way in different files.\n\nIt's written in C, which I don't speak.\n\nIt's development has come to code maintenance only.\n\nThere are many issues with how it handles recurrence.\n\nIt doesn't have friendly task identifiers.\n\nThere is no way of accessing the task time tracking from the python library.\n\nAnd lacks the following features:\n\nNative Kanban or Scrum support.\n\nTask estimations.\n\nEasy report creation.\n\nEasy way to manage the split of a task in subtasks.\n\nFreezing of recurrent tasks.\n\nMost of the above points can be addressed through the Taskwarrior plugin system or udas, but sometimes it's difficult to access the data or as the database grows, the performance drops so quick that it makes them unusable.\n\ntasklite is a promising project that tackles most of the points above. But as it's written in Haskel, I won't be able to add support for the features I need.\n\nA quick demonstration\n\nLet's see pydo in action. We'll first add three tasks to our list.\n\n$: pydo add Buy milk [+] Added task0: Buy milk $: pydo add Buy eggs [+] Added task1: Buy eggs $: pydo add Bake cake [+] Added task2: Bake cake\n\nNow let's see the list.\n\n$: pydo list ╷ ID │ Description ╺━━━━┿━━━━━━━━━━━━━╸ 0 │ Buy milk 1 │ Buy eggs 2 │ Bake cake ╵\n\nSuppose we bought our ingredients and wish to mark the first two tasks as done.\n\n$: pydodo01 [+] Closed task0: Buy milk with statedone [+] Closed task1: Buy eggs with statedone $: pydo list ╷ ID │ Description ╺━━━━┿━━━━━━━━━━━━━╸ 2 │ Bake cake ╵\n\nThose are the first three features, the add, list and done commands, but they represent all you need to know, to get started with pydo.\n\nBut there are hundreds of other features, so if you learn more, you can do more. It's entirely up to you to choose how you use pydo. Stick to the three commands above, or learn about sophisticated agile support, custom reports, user defined metadata and more.\n\nInstall\n\nTo install pydo, run:\n\npip install py-do\n\nThe installation method will create a new pydo database at ~/.local/share/pydo/database.tinydb.\n\npydo reads it's configuration from the yaml file located at ~/.local/share/pydo/config.yaml. The default template is provided at installation time.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nProbably the most important next step is to start using pydo. Capture your tasks, don't try to remember them. Review your task list to keep it current. Consult your task list to guide your actions. Develop the habit.\n\nIt doesn't take long until you realize that you might want to change your workflow. Perhaps you are missing due dates, and need more defined deadlines. Perhaps you need to make greater use of tags to help you filter tasks differently. You'll know if your workflow is not helping you as much as it could.\n\nThis is when you might look closer at the docs and the recommended Best Practices.\n\nIf you want to contribute to the project follow this guidelines."
