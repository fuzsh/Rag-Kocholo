        "text": "Terminal productivity software are applications designed to run within the constraints of a text-based terminal window that are typically associated with GUI-based office productivity software.\n\nThe reasons for preferring a terminal application to a graphical one are varied and numerous. Sometimes this can be for practical reasons, for example vision impaired users may find terminal software easier to integrate into their screen readers. Alternatively, a user may simply find the terminal less distracting than a graphical environment, find the keyboard interface more productive, or just prefer the simple aesthetic a terminal offers.\n\nSome activities are strongly associated with one or more human readable text file formats and others are not. The following is not a complete list, but represents a sampling of terminal based productivity software.\n\nAdding to this page\n\nThe applications listed here should be widely useful, and of sufficient quality, to merit inclusion.\n\nIf you regularly use a desktop software package from the Gentoo repository and can confirm it is of excellent quality, stable and of broad appeal for common tasks, please add it to the list! The software should at least be maintained (i.e. relatively recent commits to the source; have periodic releases; not have too many reported bugs; most bugs should be getting fixed rather than accumulating, etc.), and preferably be well documented and from the stable branch. Please don't use this page just to promote a package because you like it, are an author or have other interest, etc.\n\nIt is good practice to create a stub article for any package added here that does not have a page already, as anything notable enough to be listed here is notable enough to have a dedicated page.\n\nAdding New Terminal Productivity eBuilds to Portage\n\nIf you have the skills to maintain ebuilds and want to see Gentoo support more terminal productivity applications:\n\nCheck the GURU repository to see if there is anything that can be stabilized and brought over to the Portage tree.\n\nCheck this list of Awesome TUIs and other similar lists on web.\n\nWord processing, text editing, and document creation\n\nName Package Description asciidoc Converts AsciiDoc formatted text files to DocBook XML or HTML. asciidoctor A processor for converting AsciiDoc to HTML 5, XHTML 5, DocBook 5, or manpage. asciidoctor-pdf dev-ruby/asciidoctor-pdf (GURU) A native PDF converter for AsciiDoc based on Asciidoctor and Prawn. emacs Extensible text editor. glow app-misc/glow Read, organize and render Markdown documents. joe Text editor with key bindings very similar to the first generation word processor WordStar. m4 A powerful macro processor that can be used with any markup language or even plain text.
