        "text": "As developers, we‘re always looking for ways to be more productive and efficient in our work. While graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are great for many tasks, the command line interface (CLI) remains an enormously powerful and flexible environment that every developer should be comfortable with.\n\nMastering the CLI and taking advantage of the wide variety of tools available can supercharge your development workflow and make you a more effective programmer. In this post, we‘ll take a look at some of the best CLI tools across a range of categories that are worth installing and learning.\n\nTask Management & Productivity\n\nStaying organized and on top of your todos is critical for any productive developer. While there are plenty of web and GUI-based task management tools, here are some great CLI options:\n\nTaskwarrior\n\nTaskwarrior is a flexible command line task manager that uses a simple plain-text file format, so your data is portable and not locked into any proprietary system. Adding and completing tasks is quick, and Taskwarrior supports advanced features like tags, recurring tasks, scheduling, and robust filtering/querying to slice and dice your task list.\n\nTodo.txt\n\nTodo.txt is another plain-text task manager, designed to be as simple as possible. It‘s easy to integrate with your favorite text editor, and there‘s a large ecosystem of user-created add-ons that extend its functionality.\n\nOrg-mode\n\nOrg-mode is a powerful outlining and task management system built into the Emacs editor. It supports hierarchical tasks, scheduling/deadlines, time tracking, agenda views, and tons more. If you live in Emacs, it‘s a great way to track tasks without leaving your editor.\n\nText Editing & Manipulation\n\nAs a developer, you spend a huge amount of time working with text. Leveling up your text editing skills will pay dividends over your career. Here are some CLI tools to add to your text editing toolbox:\n\nVim/Neovim\n\nVim hardly needs an introduction – it‘s the ubiquitous CLI text editor installed on almost every Unix/Linux system. It has an admittedly steep learning curve, but once the key commands become muscle memory, you can edit text at the speed of thought. Neovim is a modernized fork of Vim that adds some great features like asynchronous plugins and a built-in terminal.\n\nEmacs\n\nThe other venerable CLI text editor, Emacs, takes a different approach than Vim‘s modal editing, but is no less powerful. Emacs is also infinitely extensible and customizable, and has a massive library of user-created packages that add capabilities for almost any task imaginable.\n\nsed\n\nsed is a \"stream editor\" that allows you to programmatically transform text input using pattern matching rules. It‘s a standard Unix utility and very useful for batch editing files or processing data streams as part of a command pipeline.\n\nawk\n\nawk is a full-fledged text processing programming language that is great for extracting, transforming, and reporting on structured text data like TSV or CSV files. Whenever you need to slice and dice a text dataset, awk is a great tool to reach for.\n\nSystem Monitoring & Performance\n\nKeeping an eye on system resources and application performance is important for any developer, especially when troubleshooting. Here are some handy CLI monitoring tools:\n\nhtop\n\nhtop is an enhanced version of the classic top utility for monitoring system resources and running processes. It has a user-friendly ncurses interface that uses color to highlight resource usage and provides many configuration options.\n\nglances\n\nglances is a cross-platform system monitoring tool that displays a broad overview of useful system metrics in a customizable ncurses or web-based interface. It can also export metrics to external monitoring systems for alerting and visualization.\n\niotop\n\niotop provides a htop-like view of disk I/O usage by process, helpful for diagnosing an application‘s storage activity or tracking down disk bottlenecks.\n\nDevelopment & Debugging\n\nWhen it comes time to write code, debug problems, or dive into an unfamiliar codebase, there are some great CLI tools to aid development:\n\ngit\n\ngit is the defacto standard for version control and found in pretty much every developer‘s toolbox these days. While there are many great GUI clients for git, knowing your way around the core CLI commands is invaluable.\n\ntig\n\ntig is a text-mode interface for git that allows you to explore a repo‘s history, diffs, and branches with fewer keystrokes. It‘s a nice middle-ground between the raw git CLI and a full-fledged GUI.\n\ngdb\n\nThe GNU Debugger, gdb, is a portable debugger that supports a wide variety of programming languages. While GUI debuggers are often nicer, getting comfortable with gdb will allow you to debug almost anything.\n\nvalgrind\n\nValgrind is a suite of tools for debugging memory management and threading bugs, as well as profiling for performance. It has tools that can detect memory leaks, race conditions, and other difficult-to-trace issues.\n\nstrace\n\nstrace allows you to trace system calls and signals in a running process, which is useful for debugging how an application is interacting with the OS or diagnosing tricky failures.\n\nNetworking & Security\n\nDevelopers also need to be well-versed in networking and security for building and operating applications. Some CLI tools to have in your kit:\n\nnmap\n\nnmap is a powerful network scanning and discovery tool. It can identify hosts, ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities on a network. Very useful for understanding your network attack surface or investigating issues.\n\ntcpdump\n\ntcpdump is the classic CLI packet analyzer. It allows you to capture and display data from a live network interface, or analyze captured pcap files. Invaluable for network troubleshooting and security analysis.\n\nwireshark\n\nWireshark is a more user-friendly protocol analyzer that has both CLI and GUI interfaces. It can capture packets and let you visualize, filter, and drill-down on all aspects of network traffic.\n\nopenssh\n\nOpenSSH provides secure remote CLI access between machines using the SSH protocol. The ssh CLI tool lets you open an encrypted shell on a remote system to execute commands or tunnel services. The related scp tool allows you to securely copy files to/from remote hosts.\n\nMiscellaneous Useful Tools\n\nIn addition to all the above, there are countless other CLI gems out there that can make your life easier. A few more to check out:\n\ntmux\n\ntmux is a terminal multiplexer that allows you to manage multiple shell sessions from a single screen. You can split panes, detach/reattach sessions, and customize your shell environment. Pair programming over ssh + tmux is a popular workflow.\n\nfzf\n\nfzf is an interactive fuzzy file finder that integrates nicely into your shell. It provides quick keyboard-driven selection of files, folders, command history, and processes that feels like magic once you get used to it.\n\nripgrep\n\nripgrep is an extremely fast alternative to the grep family of search tools. It has sensible defaults, respects .gitignore, and does smart recursive directory searching. A worthwhile upgrade to a classic tool.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CLI certainly has a learning curve compared to GUI tools, but the productivity gains are immense for those who take the time to master it. By adding some of these power tools to your CLI toolbox and building the habit of reaching for them, you can work more efficiently, solve problems faster, and level up your skills.\n\nWe‘ve only scratched the surface here of all the amazing CLI tools out there. What are some of your favorites that we missed? Share them in the comments!\n\nInvesting in your mastery of the command line will pay dividends throughout your career as a developer. Don‘t be afraid to dive in and start building your own custom toolkit of sharp, powerful utilities. Happy CLIing!"
