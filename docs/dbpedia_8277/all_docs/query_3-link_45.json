        "text": "If you’re looking to stay productive at the command line you’ll want to check out Taskbook.\n\nTaskbook is a terrifically well made terminal tool that lets you create todo lists, jot down notes, and organise your tasks using boards, all from the command line.\n\nHacker News described it as “Like Trello but for the Terminal”, a description that isn’t entirely accurate.\n\nTaskbook is more akin to a plain text to-do list tool rather than a Trello analog for the terminal.\n\nFor instance, it lacks the spatial flow of Trello, i.e. being able to see all of your columns side by side. And there’s no team collaboration features, tagging, or other advanced features.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean it’s not useful — nn the contrary!\n\nUsing Taskbook you can create, edit, search for and manage your everyday tasks, notes, and boards tasks using multiple boards.\n\nThe app is also incredibly easy to use thanks to memorable set of commands (-t for new task, -c for checking an item, -l for list, etc).\n\nBy default Taskbook shows tasks and notes in a board view.\n\nThe alternative “timeline” view switches to a date-based grouping, listing your tasks based on when you added/created them.\n\nYou can quickly list items based on their status, priority or other attributes, e.g.,tb -l incomplete shows you all incomplete/pending/unchecked items from all of your boards, while tb -l my board starred will only list starred items from the ‘my board’ board.\n\nThere’s little else to say; Taskbook works exactly as designed, and extremely well — even for a relative terminal-shy nerd like me.\n\nQuickly add tasks & notes to boards\n\nMove tasks between boards\n\nChoice of board and timeline views\n\nSet task priority/star\n\nSearch & filter tasks, notes and boards\n\nArchive, delete and restore tasks, notes and boards\n\nEasy to learn syntax\n\nThe app is configurable through the ~/.taskbook.json file in your homer folder, with data stored in a JSON file at ~/.taskbook/storage (though you can choose you own storage location).\n\nSummary\n\nIf you’re regularly at the command line then something like Taskbook is a must (though admittedly you’re spoilt for choice as there are a lot of todo list terminal apps out there).\n\nInstall Taskbook on Linux\n\nTaskbook is relatively easy to install using NPM (once you’ve got that installed and set-up) though there’s no denying that the Snap app (see below) is simpler to use.\n\nTo install Taskbook on Ubuntu (and most other Linux distributions) using npm you need to run the following command:\n\nsudo npm install --global taskbook\n\nSudo shouldn’t be necessary if you set your environment up correctly, but I haven’t.\n\nSnap app is easier\n\nIf you’re on a recent version of Ubuntu you may prefer to install the Taskbook Snap:\n\nsudo snap install taskbook\n\nRegardless of which way you choose to install Taskbook, to can run the app with the help file shown, enter:\n\ntb --help\n\nCheckout the flight manual\n\nThe app also has a superb ‘flight manual’ that walks through each and every command in turn, from how to create a board and move items between boards to how to star items, check them off, or restore ones you delete.\n\nReading the guide saved me a lot experimentation so I do recommend that you check it out.\n\nP.S: If you’re looking for something similar but with a GUI, I highly recommended checking out Notion. It doesn’t have a Linux client (yet, please go bug them about it) but it does have a web interface and clients for Windows and macOS.\n\nThanks Yan, John & Paul\n\nNotepad image credit: Moz.com"
