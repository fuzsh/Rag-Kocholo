        "text": "Day-to-Day Work\n\nThere are many different day-to-day work management techniques and tools and no silver bullets. It is often not productive to attempt to religiously follow a particular methodology, or particularly to spend a great deal of time churning through different tools. No tool is perfect; each will let you down somehow, sometime. And they cannot solve everything.\n\nAlso, different roles require different workflows and task management systems. Many systems and books are primarily oriented towards white-collar knowledge and executive workers, particularly those with management responsibilities. They have some overlap with academic work but often need adaptation. A grab bag of techniques may work best for you.\n\nThe important thing is to be able to record the things that you need to do, in a reliable medium, and work on them. Many people are very productive with a spiral notebook.\n\nI have written a series of articles about my own approach to planning and managing work, and include there a number of links to other resources.\n\nIf you want to read one productivity book, I recommend The One Minute To-Do List.\n\nThere are also a million software tools that may or may not help, such as Logseq, Todoist, Toodledo, Microsoft To Do, OmniFocus, TaskPaper, Emacs org-mode, and TaskWarrior.\n\nPlanning Projects\n\nItâs really easy to spin your wheels in research. Itâs even easier if you donât have a clear idea of what it is that you are trying to do.\n\nTherefore, itâs important to be able to plan a project (or subproject) to give it a clear direction and to help structure your work. Even in the fairly open-ended world of academic research, it is important to have clear direction.\n\nEarly on, your adviser will help a lot with this. But as you progress through your research career, you need to be able to do an increasing amount of project planning yourself. By the time you complete a Ph.D, you should be able to plan out a research project that is at least one paperâs worth of work, and ideally more.\n\nOne of the key things to do in planning a project is to determine its intended outcome. If the project is successful, what will you have at the end? It does not matter much what you call this â âDefinition of Doneâ from SCRUM, a âDesired Outcomeâ, or whatever â the important thing is to define success. The desired outcome may just be âwe have an evidence-based answer to research question $FOOâ. Then you can work on determining how to move towards success.\n\nOnce you have a concrete goal, or an idea that you are considering developing into a concrete goal, it is useful to be able to iterate quickly on early ideas to filter out infeasible solutions and identify a promising path forward. Minimum Viable Research is one way of thinking about this."
