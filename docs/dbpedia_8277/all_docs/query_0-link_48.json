        "text": "I have been using minimal templates for some months now. I have set up all the sys-* qubes to use their debian-minimal equivalents, by consulting the guide in the docs. The resulting sys-* qubes are good, they work, and they use minimal amount of debain packages along with minimal amount of RAM.\n\nNow, I find it difficult to employ same absolute barebones of minimal-templates for my daily work (along the lines of reading rss feeds, reading pdfs, journaling on the command line, managing the calcurse/taskwarrior, reading manpages, writing some scripts, etc.) extreme. I need a more “complete” debian setup than the debian-minimal one.\n\nOn the other hand, I also find the fully-fledged debian to be bloated. It is full of packages that my “study” focused qube won’t need, such as firefox, or multimedia players (these will have their own isolated qubes).\n\nSo, I have come to realise that I would be more content with having the debian setup which is analogous to its netinst install with only “standard system utilities” packages installed:\n\nSuch a lean-debian would be a better bedrock for other derivative qubes for specific job domains (such as web browsing, or watching videos/music on mpv, or reading pdfs and journaling, or writing scripts, or writing blog posts under anonymous identities).\n\nSo the discussion for this thread is, how to get the debian-minimal to such a “debian-lean” state with regards to the packages and programs installed. I would like to hear your opinions about which packages to install in order to get that. Meanwhile, I will be setting up a debian netinst install on a standalone qube and documenting the packages it is going to have installed with “standard system utilities.” I plan to replicate the resulting list of packs to be installed debian-minimal in order to convert it to “debian-lean.”\n\nHowever, I have some question marks about this plan: for example, there might be packages that the standard system utilities provide that are unnecessary or even dysfunctional within the qubes os virtualization framework. If this indeed is, how would I discern such packages from the other useful ones.\n\nLastly, here is a usfeul stack exchange question that might be helpful for other people with similar goals: What packages are installed by default in Debian? Is there a term for that set? Why some of those packages are `automatically installed` and some not? - Unix & Linux Stack Exchange\n\nTo keep my names short, any template I base on debian-minimal is named deb11m; e.g., deb11m-sys-net. But deb11m is basically a clone of debian-minimal, so anything with that “stem” in the name is debian-minimal plus the bare minimum to make it functional for whatever it is it’s supposed to do.\n\nBut then, I take off my Linux geek hat and put on my “I want to use an app” hat. I will want more things (like a text editor that isn’t vi, GUI based file managers, and the like)…so I created deb11a…which is debian-minimal plus some user conveniences (a is for “app”). [Incidentally I’ve noted that vi on dom0 tolerates arrow keys a lot better than vi on deb11m based qubes.] Basically deb11a is everything I’d want to have in common between a, say LibreOffice qube and a GIMP qube; which is still a LOT more than I’d want in sys-net!\n\nSo basically I have two “basic” templates, one for “low level” stuff, and one that has a few things a user (as opposed to an administrator) might want, before installing, say, LibreOffice or Gimp, or media players on it. Each is minimal in that I don’t install extraneous software on it, but they are different, because they’ll have different roles.\n\nI guess what I’m driving at is that I don’t see one “minimal” template satisfying everyone; heck I can’t get along with one just by myself.\n\nI know there’s also a “core” out there that’s supposed to be more stripped down than deb11m–I mean debian-minimal–but I haven’t played with it much; it may be a suitable substitute for deb11m."
