He likes time traveling movies.\n\nC++ is still a widely used programming language, so learning it is beneficial in 2023. However, newer languages like Python and Java may be more in-demand in the future.\n\nThe best free IDE for C++ is Visual Studio. It provides a full-featured development environment for C++ with an integrated debugger and many tools to help you manage your project.\n\nThere is no definitive answer to this question as it depends on the programmerâ€™s experience and expertise. However, some that are considered to be more difficult to learn are Assembly and Lisp.\n\nIDE stands for integrated development environment. It is a software application that provides tools that programmers can use to develop software applications in various languages, including C++.\n\nElon Musk started coding at a very early stage in his life. He handled the backend with C and worked with Python as well. But as of 2022, Musk is not a developer, so he likely does not know C++, specifically. However, he is a technology entrepreneur and has experience in development and a considerable understanding of programming."
