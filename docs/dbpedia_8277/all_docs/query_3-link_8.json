Setting up a new machine, and individually installing each program would get tiresome very quickly. So the task of installing and updating your terminal apps is the perfect candidate for automation. Here are some example scripts I've written, which can be easily dropped into your dotfiles or just run independently to ensure you're never missing an app.\n\nFor MacOS users, the easiest method is using Homebrew. Just create a Brewfile (with touch ~/.Brewfile), then list each of your apps, and run brew bundle. You can keep your package list backed up, by putting it in a Git repo. Here's an example one, to get you started: https://github.com/Lissy93/Brewfile\n\nOn Linux, you usually want to use the native package manager (e.g. pacman, apt). As an example, here's a script to install the above apps on Arch Linux systems\n\nDesktop apps on Linux can be managed in a similar way, via Flatpak. Again, here's an example script :)\n\nConclusion\n\n... So that's it - a list of handy CLI apps, and a method for installing and keeping them up-to-date across your systems.\n\nHopefully some of these will be useful to some of you :)\n\nI'd love to hear what you're favourite CLI apps are, let me know in the comments below!\n\nAdditional Info\n\nWhat wasn't included\n\nThis list doesn't include the basics, like Vim, Tmux, Ranger, ZSH, Git, etc - which you're likely already using\n\nI've also not included anything too niche, or only specific to a small number of users\n\nNothing system-specific, or that isn't cross-platform (Linux/ Unix, MacOS) is included\n\nAnd I've not included apps which relate to the terminal, but are not CLI apps (like terminal emulators)\n\nFor most of the projects listed, there's a plethora of alternatives that achieve similar things, for brevity those also weren't included\n\nCredit\n\nHuge kudos to the authors, and communities behind each of these apps. Without them and their hard work, our life in the command line would be much less awesome. Where possible, I've tried to credit the authors, but if I've missed any - let me know below, and I'll push an update\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat have I missed? I'd love to hear your favourite CLI apps, especially if there's something awesome that I've missed!\n\nI'd also like to hear your thoughts and suggestions - I'm always looking to improve :)\n\nBadges\n\nHere's the script that I made to generate the author, language and GitHub star badges:\n\nRepo Badge Generator\n\nLissy93 / repo-badge-maker\n\n🛡️ Very, very quick script to generate repo badges for blog posts\n\n🛡️ Repo Badge Generator\n\nQuick script to generate embedable badges for a repository\n\nrepo-badges.as93.net\n\nAbout\n\nI made this to quickly generate the project links, for this post: CLI tools you won't be able to live without 🔧\n\nJust a simple script to quickly generate embedable markdown badges to show repository info.\n\nData is fetched from the GitHub API, and badges are served up using the Shields.io API.\n\nIncludes a badge for + link to: the author, the repo + star count, and the language used.\n\nPaste in the URL to a repo, hit 'Generate', and results will be copied to your clipboard.\n\nDeployment\n\nIt's just a static HTML page, so serve it with any web server, CDN or static host.\n\nThere's a demo hosted on GH Pages, at: lissy93.github.io/repo-badge-maker\n\nReport an Issue\n\nFound something that's not working? Open an issue, and describe the problem, steps to reproduce alond with…\n\nView on GitHub\n\nFind More\n\nIf you were enjoying this, I recommend also checking out:\n\nterminals-are-sexy by Nikolaos Kamarinakis\n\nawesome-shell by Caleb Xu\n\nawesome-cli-apps by Adam Garrett-Harris\n\nIf you're new to the command line, then The Art of Command Line by Joshua Levy is an excellent resource, as is the Bash Guide by Adnan Ahmed."
