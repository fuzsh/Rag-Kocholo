Instead, the recommended solution is a cloud-storage backend, although `taskchampion-sync-server` is also available. * The Taskwarrior build no longer requires GnuTLS. The build option `ENABLE_SYNC=OFF` is also no longer supported; sync support is always built in. * Fix urgency inheritance for negative-urgency tasks. * `task show` now shows `hooks.location. * Fix leading space before urgency value in `task info`. * Fix formatting of countdown-style dates * Fix issue with filter not applied correctly during `task _tags` command * Parsing of timestamp values now uses 64-bit integers, avoiding issues in the year 2032. * Fix fish completion. * Wed Feb 21 2024 Michael Vetter <mvetter@suse.com> - Use %autosetup macro. Allows to eliminate the usage of deprecated %patchN. * Wed Apr 13 2022 Ferdinand Thiessen <rpm@fthiessen.de> - Update to 2.6.2: * Fix sequence of IDs doesn't work with attribute \"depends\" * Fix the bulk removal of depends: and tags: is ignored * Fix tag exclusion should be detected as invalid write context * Fix the value of soww named date is incorrect * Fix corruption of the depends attribute upon syncing with taskd 1.1.0 * Fix assigning dependencies via ID ranges * Fix recurring report does not include parent tasks * Sun Nov 28 2021 Dirk MÃ¼ller <dmueller@suse.com> - update to 2.6.1: - The logic behind new-uuid verbosity option changed. New-uuid now overrides new-id if set and will cause Taskwarrior to display UUIDs instead of IDs for new tasks (machine friendly). - If ~/.taskrc is not found, Taskwarrior will look for its configuration in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/task/taskrc (defaulting to ~/.config/task/taskrc). This allows users to setup their Taskwarrior to follow XDG standard without using config overrides. - Newer Unicode characters, such as emojis are correctly handled and displayed. Taskwarrior now supports all Unicode characters up to Unicode 12. - Datetime values until year 9999 are now supported. Duration values of up to 1 000 000 years are now supported. - 64-bit numeric values (up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807) are now supported. - Later/someday named datetime values now resolve to 9999-12-30 (instead of 2038-01-18). - Calendar now supports displaying due dates until year 9999. - Calendar now displays waiting tasks with due dates on the calendar. - Calendar supports highlighting days with scheduled tasks. - Multi-day holidays are now supported. - Holiday data files for fr-CA, hu-HU, pt-BR, sk-SK and sv-FI locales are now generated and shipped with Taskwarrior. - The task edit command can now handle multi-line annotations and UDAs in a user friendly way, withouth having to handle with JSON escaping of special chars. - A large portion of currently known parser-related issues was fixed. - The taskrc file now supports relative paths, which are evaluated with respect to (a) current directory, (b) taskrc directory and (c) now also the installation directory of configuration files. - The currently selected context is now applied for \"task add\" and \"task log\" commands. Section on contexts in the manpage was updated to describe this functionality. - Users can specify per-context specific overrides of configuration variables. - The `task import` command can now accept annotations with missing entry values. Current time will be assumed. - The new 'by' filter attribute modifier compares using '<=' rather than '<' as 'before' uses. This allows the last second of the day to match with 'due.by:eod', which it would not otherwise. It also works with whole units like days, e.g. 'add test due:2021-07-17' would not match 'due.before:tomorrow' (on the 16th), but would match 'due.by:tomorrow'. - Waiting is now an entirely \"virtual\" concept, based on a task's 'wait' property and the current time. Task is considered \"waiting\" if its wait attribute is in the future. TaskWarrior no longer explicitly \"unwaits\" a task (the wait attribute is not removed once its value is in the past), so the \"unwait' verbosity token is no longer available. This allows for filtering for tasks that were waiting in the past intervals, but are not waiting anymore. - The configuration file now supports environment variables. - Taskwarrior can now handle displaying tasks in windows with limited width, even if columns contain long strings (like URLs). - The nag message is emitted at most once per task command, even with bulk operations. Additionally, the urgency of the task considered is taken before the completion, not after. - The export command now takes an optional argument that references an existing report. As such, \"task export <report>\" command will export the same tasks that \"task <report>\" prints, and in the same order. - The burndown command now supports non-cumulative display, where tasks only get plotted within the interval segment when they got completed. * Mon Jan 25 2021 Michael Bryant <shadow53@shadow53.com> - 2.5.3 - Update to 2.5.3 upstream release 2.5.3, skipping 2.5.2 Refer to /usr/share/doc/packages/task/Changelog for full list of changes * Deprecated the 'DUETODAY' virtual tag, which is a synonym for the 'TODAY' virtual tag. * Removed deprecated 'alias._query' setting. * Fixed ambiguity in the esp-ESP localization * Deprecated the 'new-uuid' verbosity option, since its functionality can be removed by merging with 'new-id'. * Correct a false-positive warning when a due date is removed and a wait is added. * Added 'QUARTER' virtual tag. * Fixed unquoted glob in bash completion script * Deprecated use of alternate Boolean configuration settings. Use values \"0\" for off, and \"1\" for on. Avoid used of \"on\", \"off\", \"true\", \"t\", \"false\", \"f\", \"yes\", \"y\", \"no\", \"n\". * Improved certificate validation diagnostics * Updated the 'timesheet' command with a more compact report * Added 'history.weekly', 'history.daily', 'ghistory.weekly', 'ghistory.daily' report variations, with code refactoring. * New DOM references: annotations.count, tw.syncneeded, tw.program, tw.args, * tw.width, tw.height, tw.version. * The message telling you to sync now indicates how many local changes will be synced. * Workaround for alias grep=rg in fish * Sat Mar 05 2016 sleep_walker@opensuse.org - update to 2.5.1 (bugfix and performance release) - refresh task-skip-INSTALL.patch, remove also LICENSE from the list, which is just duplicate of COPYING * Sun Dec 13 2015 mimi.vx@gmail.com - update to 2.5.0 release - drop taskwarrior-gcc47.patch * Fri May 29 2015 mvyskocil@opensuse.org - Update to 2.4.4 bugfix release - Drop taskwarrior-no-return.patch * Mon Feb 16 2015 mvyskocil@opensuse.org - Use standard %cmake and %cmake_install macros * Tue Jan 13 2015 mvyskocil@opensuse.org - add taskwarrior-no-return.patch to shut up gcc's complaining about no return in non-void function - replace __DATE__ and __TIME__ by values from source tarball\n\nFiles\n\n/usr/bin/task /usr/share/bash_completion.d /usr/share/bash_completion.d/task.sh /usr/share/doc/packages/task /usr/share/doc/packages/task/AUTHORS /usr/share/doc/packages/task/COPYING /usr/share/doc/packages/task/ChangeLog /usr/share/doc/packages/task/LICENSE /usr/share/doc/packages/task/README.md /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/dark-16.theme /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/dark-256.theme /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/dark-blue-256.theme /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/dark-gray-256.theme /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/dark-gray-blue-256.theme /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/dark-green-256.theme /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/dark-red-256.theme /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/dark-violets-256.theme /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/dark-yellow-green.theme /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.cs-CZ.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.da-DK.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.de-AT.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.de-BE.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.de-CH.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.de-DE.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.el-GR.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.en-CA.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.en-GB.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.en-NZ.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.en-US.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.es-CO.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.es-ES.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.es-US.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.fi-FI.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.fr-BE.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.fr-CA.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.fr-FR.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.hr-HR.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.hu-HU.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.is-IS.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.it-IT.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.nb-NO.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.nl-BE.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.nl-NL.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.pl-PL.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.por-PRT.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.pt-BR.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.pt-PT.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.ru-RU.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.sk-SK.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.sv-FI.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.sv-SE.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/holidays.tr-TR.rc /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/light-16.theme /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/light-256.theme /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/no-color.theme /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/refresh /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/solarized-dark-256.theme /usr/share/doc/packages/task/rc/solarized-light-256.theme /usr/share/doc/packages/task/scripts /usr/share/doc/packages/task/scripts/add-ons /usr/share/doc/packages/task/scripts/add-ons/README /usr/share/doc/packages/task/scripts/add-ons/update-holidays.pl /usr/share/doc/packages/task/scripts/bash /usr/share/doc/packages/task/scripts/hooks /usr/share/doc/packages/task/scripts/hooks/README /usr/share/doc/packages/task/scripts/hooks/on-add /usr/share/doc/packages/task/scripts/hooks/on-add.the /usr/share/doc/packages/task/scripts/hooks/on-exit /usr/share/doc/packages/task/scripts/hooks/on-exit.shadow-file /usr/share/doc/packages/task/scripts/hooks/on-launch /usr/share/doc/packages/task/scripts/hooks/on-modify /usr/share/doc/packages/task/task-ref.pdf /usr/share/fish /usr/share/fish/completions /usr/share/fish/completions/task.fish /usr/share/man/man1/task.1.gz /usr/share/man/man5/task-color.5.gz /usr/share/man/man5/task-sync.5.gz /usr/share/man/man5/taskrc.5.gz /usr/share/vim/site/ftdetect/task.vim /usr/share/vim/site/syntax/taskdata.vim /usr/share/vim/site/syntax/taskedit.vim /usr/share/vim/site/syntax/taskrc.vim /usr/share/zsh/site-functions /usr/share/zsh/site-functions/_task\n\nGenerated by rpm2html 1.8.1"
