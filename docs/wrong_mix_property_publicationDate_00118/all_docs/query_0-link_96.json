        "text": "The Road\n\nBy Cormac McCarthy,\n\nFrom my list on dystopian and sci-fantasy novels.\n\nBy Stephen M. Sanders Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve been a sci-fi/fantasy fan ever since my dad introduced me to the original Star Trek (in reruns) and The Lord of the Rings in my youth. I’ve always loved thinking about possibilities—large and small—so my work tends to think big when I write. I also write poetry, which allows me to talk about more than just the everyday or at least to find the excitement within the mundane in life. These works talk about those same “possibilities”—for better or worse, and in reading, I walk in awareness of what could be.\n\nStephen's book list on dystopian and sci-fantasy novels\n\nWhy did Stephen love this book?\n\nCormac McCarthy does the impossible in this book—he writes an emotionally satisfying, literary-minded travelogue of horrors. It shatters the reader but then lifts them up with its beautifully wrought prose.\n\nBe patient: the novel gets brutally dark before the light.\n\nBy Cormac McCarthy,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n31 authors picked The Road as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nNATIONAL BESTSELLER • WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE • A searing, post-apocalyptic novel about a father and son's fight to survive, this \"tale of survival and the miracle of goodness only adds to McCarthy's stature as a living master. It's gripping, frightening and, ultimately, beautiful\" (San Francisco Chronicle).\n\nA father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don't know what, if…\n\nPreview\n\nI Am Legend\n\nBy Richard Matheson,\n\nFrom my list on dystopian novels to make you cling to your duvet and worship your walls.\n\nBy C.L. Lauder Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am a young adult fantasy author and paranoid survivalist. I have spent years curating items for my end-of-days go-bag, and nothing gives me greater pleasure than hanging out in universes that are about to go bang!\n\nC.L.'s book list on dystopian novels to make you cling to your duvet and worship your walls\n\nWhy did C.L. love this book?\n\nLegends are made of powerful stuff, and nothing has greater power than a total flip in perspective. I still recall the gut-punch end to this book, though it’s been decades since I read it.\n\nRobert Neville is a vampire hunter by day and a tormented man by night. As seemingly the only living human in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, Robert faces depression, isolation, alcoholism, and his undead neighbor, Ben Cortman, who appears outside Robert’s front door each night chanting, \"Come out, Neville.\"\n\nBut when Robert is finally captured, and the truth of his situation is revealed, he gets a good look at the world through the eyes of the undead and is forced to ask himself, who am I? What have I become?\n\nBy Richard Matheson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n17 authors picked I Am Legend as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAn acclaimed SF novel about vampires. The last man on earth is not alone ...Robert Neville is the last living man on Earth ...but he is not alone. Every other man, woman and child on the planet has become a vampire, and they are hungry for Neville's blood. By day he is the hunter, stalking the undead through the ruins of civilisation. By night, he barricades himself in his home and prays for the dawn. How long can one man survive like this?\n\nPreview\n\nThe Left Hand of Darkness\n\nBy Ursula K. Le Guin,\n\nFrom my list on fantasy that takes you from reality to imagination.\n\nBy Verlyn Flieger Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI love fantasy novels because they highlight the disparities between reality and individual perception, whether between the reader and the text or among the characters within it. All the books I listed pull the reader from the actual into the fantastic world I prefer! This is probably why I spent my time as an author, editor, and professor in the Department of English at the University of Maryland, teaching courses in comparative mythology, medieval literature, and the works of J. R. R. Tolkien.\n\nVerlyn's book list on fantasy that takes you from reality to imagination\n\nWhy did Verlyn love this book?\n\nUrsula Le Guin’s book uses gender identity to address reader estrangement. I love that Le Guin ruthlessly runssacks all our preconceptions, interrogates the assumptions we mistake for laws, and deconstructs conventional notions of what makes a viable society.\n\nThe locale is the planet of Winter, where it is always either cold or colder. There is sex but no gender, and individuals can father a child or give birth to one. This circumstance becomes endlessly confusing to Genly Ai, the male visitor from planet Earth, who doesn’t know how to respond to his guide and benefactor Estraven or even what pronoun to use.\n\nIt isn’t that he gets the signals wrong, it’s that there are no signals and he doesn’t know how to navigate without them—learning how to respond to people as individuals instead of gendered types.\n\nBy Ursula K. Le Guin,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n16 authors picked The Left Hand of Darkness as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n50TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION-WITH A NEW INTRODUCTION BY DAVID MITCHELL AND A NEW AFTERWORD BY CHARLIE JANE ANDERS\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin's groundbreaking work of science fiction-winner of the Hugo and Nebula Awards.\n\nA lone human ambassador is sent to the icebound planet of Winter, a world without sexual prejudice, where the inhabitants' gender is fluid. His goal is to facilitate Winter's inclusion in a growing intergalactic civilization. But to do so he must bridge the gulf between his own views and those of the strange, intriguing culture he encounters...\n\nEmbracing the aspects of psychology, society, and human emotion on an…\n\nPreview\n\nOryx and Crake\n\nBy Margaret Atwood,\n\nFrom my list on seeking hope after the end of the world.\n\nBy Lauren Yero Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nCan stories bring a human scale to something as all-encompassing as climate change? In 2011, I began an MA in Literature and Environment with this question weighing on my mind. I finished my degree two years later with a draft of my debut novel, Under This Forgetful Sky. I’ve come to understand the climate crisis, in many ways, as a crisis of imagination. Its enormity tests the limits of the imaginable. What if the world as we know it ends? What would life look like on the other side? The books on this list reckon with the fears these questions bring while also gesturing beautifully, unsentimentally, courageously toward hope.\n\nLauren's book list on seeking hope after the end of the world\n\nWhy did Lauren love this book?\n\nThis book is light on hope, but if you’re on the hunt for cli-fi dystopias, Oryx and Crake is a must-read.\n\nThe novel’s protagonist, Snowman (previously known as Jimmy), finds himself alone (sort of) after a global societal collapse. His story unfolds on either side of this collapse as he searches for answers about what has happened to the world and why.\n\nThis book brings together runaway climate change, an apocalyptic pandemic, uncontrolled genetic engineering, mass extinction, and more, dealing with nostalgia for what’s been lost and reckoning with each person’s individual culpability for that loss. And yet it somehow manages to also be a thrilling puzzle box of a story that ends on a note of cautious hope.\n\nBy Margaret Atwood,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n8 authors picked Oryx and Crake as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nBy the author of THE HANDMAID'S TALE and ALIAS GRACE\n\n*\n\nPigs might not fly but they are strangely altered. So, for that matter, are wolves and racoons. A man, once named Jimmy, lives in a tree, wrapped in old bedsheets, now calls himself Snowman. The voice of Oryx, the woman he loved, teasingly haunts him. And the green-eyed Children of Crake are, for some reason, his responsibility.\n\n*\n\nPraise for Oryx and Crake:\n\n'In Jimmy, Atwood has created a great character: a tragic-comic artist of the future, part buffoon, part Orpheus. An adman who's a sad man; a jealous…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Stand\n\nBy Stephen King,\n\nFrom my list on that were adapted into worse movies.\n\nBy Christopher Calvin Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI grew up a child of the movies, open to watching anything at least once and countlessly rewatching the movies I loved. When not in front of a television, I was instead in front of a book, playing the words of the page out in my imagination. Now I write thrillers of multiple varieties (action, techno, paranormal, etc.), still visualizing words as movies playing out in my mind. Over the years, I’ve seen the quality of novel adaptations grow (e.g., Harry Potter, The Martian, etc.), and yet these staples of my youth have always stuck with me as lost opportunities to deliver a superior work to the general movie-watching audience.\n\nChristopher's book list on that were adapted into worse movies\n\nWhy did Christopher love this book?\n\nAt a whopping 1,152 pages, Stephen King’s The Stand was just too much to capture in a single movie.\n\nThat’s why, in 1994, CBS adapted it across four, ninety-minute episodes of a limited run “mini-series” (a fancy way of saying “a really long movie”). In all fairness, it had a great cast and was better than it had any right to be, and was far more enjoyable than CBS’s 2020 attempt at a do-over.\n\nBut even with a total six-hour runtime, it couldn’t capture all the story, heart, and nuance that made the book so incredible. It’s a feat to read, one I did to pass the time when bored in school, and one I will surely do again in the future.\n\nBy Stephen King,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n19 authors picked The Stand as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nStephen King's apocalyptic vision of a world blasted by virus and tangled in an elemental struggle between good and evil remains as riveting and eerily plausible as when it was first published.\n\nSoon to be a television series.\n\n'THE STAND is a masterpiece' (Guardian). Set in a virus-decimated US, King's thrilling American fantasy epic, is a Classic.\n\nFirst come the days of the virus. Then come the dreams.\n\nDark dreams that warn of the coming of the dark man. The apostate of death, his worn-down boot heels tramping the night roads. The warlord of the charnel house and Prince of…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Fellowship of the Ring\n\nBy J.R.R. Tolkien,\n\nWhy did Verlyn love this book?\n\nWhen I first read this book in 1957, I had the now-impossible experience of reading a book I had never heard of by an unknown author. It was an unforgettable and unrepeatable experience, and I’ve never lost the sheer wonder of that discovery, even though it has now become the unintended inspiration for all of the sword-and-sorcery fantasies and little-guy-with-a-big-mission sagas that weigh down the shelves of today’s bookstores.\n\nSeveral things distinguish it from its hapless descendants. 1. It's writing: Tolkien’s ability to change the tone from down-to-earth vernacular to the language of high medieval romance cannot be matched by his successor. 2. Its integrity: the book draws on his own previously created and entirely consistent Silmarillion legendarium mythology to create a different yet familiar world the reader can enter. 3. Its range moves seamlessly from low comedy to high tragedy and effortlessly mixes the mundane with the mysterious.\n\nReaders…\n\nBy J.R.R. Tolkien,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n17 authors picked The Fellowship of the Ring as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 12, 13, 14, and 15.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis brand-new unabridged audio book of The Fellowship of the Ring, the first part of J. R. R. Tolkien's epic adventure, The Lord of the Rings, is read by the BAFTA award-winning actor, director and author, Andy Serkis.\n\nIn a sleepy village in the Shire, a young hobbit is entrusted with an immense task. He must make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy the Ruling Ring of Power - the only thing that prevents the Dark Lord Sauron's evil dominion.\n\nThus begins J. R. R. Tolkien's classic tale of adventure, which continues in…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Borrowers\n\nBy Mary Norton, Beth Krush (illustrator), Joe Krush (illustrator)\n\nWhy did Verlyn love this book?\n\nI loved Mary Norton’s book for its narrative hook: size. This is Gulliver’s Lilliput without the satiric political overtones. The main characters are a miniature Edwardian family called the Clocks because they live underneath one. The father, Pod, his wife, Homily, and their daughter, Arietty, are so small they fit under the floorboards of a human-sized house.\n\nAll their ingenuity is devoted to adapting their smallness to the world of Big People while preventing them from being “seen” by them. Everything they use must be “borrowed” from the bigger world and adapted to their circumstances. Matchboxes become dressers and chests of drawers; postage stamps serve as wall hangings and pictures; a thimble does duty as a soup tureen, while an actual tureen becomes a bathtub.\n\nThe discovery of a fully furnished doll’s house has become an occasion for wholesale redecoration. A crisis comes when Arietty is “seen” by the human…\n\nBy Mary Norton, Beth Krush (illustrator), Joe Krush (illustrator)\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Borrowers as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 8, 9, 10, and 11.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nPuffin Classics: the definitive collection of timeless stories, for every child.\n\n'Don't move!' said a voice, and the voice, like the eye, was enormous but somehow, hushed - and hoarse like a surge of wind through the grating on a stormy night in March. Arrietty froze. 'So this is it,' she thought, 'the worst and most terrible thing of all: I have been \"seen\"!\n\nThe Borrowers live in the secret places of quiet old houses; behind the mantelpiece, inside the harpsichord, under the kitchen clock. They own nothing, borrow everything, and never forget their most important rule: you must never,…\n\nPreview\n\nA Fish Dinner in Memison\n\nBy E.R. Edison,\n\nWhy did Verlyn love this book?\n\nWith E.R. Eddison’s book, the hook is identity. I love that the major characters are all avatars, manifestations of each other, and that they don’t know it is the underlying mystery Eddison wants the reader to discover without being told.\n\nAll of his men derive from the godlike Mezentius, and all his women derive from the Goddess. Their lives and characters intertwine the real and imaginary worlds of Earth and Zimizmvia. The human Lady Mary is the real-world avatar of the Zimiamvian goddess Fiorinda, who is the lover of Duke Barganax, who is the otherworld personification of the real-world Lessingham, widower of Lady Mary and lover of the Zimizmvian princess Antiope.\n\nIf you start to get confused, you are on the right track! Eddison aims to confuse, mystify, and enter you all simultaneously.\n\nBy E.R. Edison,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked A Fish Dinner in Memison as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn this second book of the Zimiamvian Trilogy, the royal guests at A Fish Dinner in Memison amuse themselves with the creation of a sadly flawed world … and in an instant spend a lifetime in it.\n\nPreview\n\nMara, Daughter of the Nile\n\nBy Eloise Jarvis McGraw,\n\nWhy did Roy love this book?\n\nI value this book as a lesson in engrossing story-building.\n\nWhile ostensibly 'a young Egypt read,’ this novel is a consuming and thrilling read for anyone who loves intrigue and historical adventure. It's about a slave girl hungry for her freedom. Mara is a spy story of dangerous love and a central character torn by a monstrous dilemma.\n\nIt's a gem to discover.\n\nBy Eloise Jarvis McGraw,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Mara, Daughter of the Nile as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 10, 11, 12, and 13.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThis compelling story of adventure, romance, and intrigue, set in ancient Egypt, was written by the three-time Newbery Honor and Edgar Award winning author Eloise Jarvis McGraw.\n\nMara is a proud and beautiful slave girl who yearns for freedom in ancient Egypt, under the rule of Queen Hatshepsut. Mara is not like other slaves; she can read and write, as well as speak the language of Babylonian. So, to barter for her freedom, she finds herself playing the dangerous role of double spy for two arch enemies-each of whom supports a contender for the throne of Egypt.\n\nAgainst her will,…\n\nPreview\n\nTrouble The Water\n\nBy Rebecca Dwight Bruff,\n\nFrom my list on civil war novels and histories on global tensions.\n\nBy Henry G. Brinton Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI am saddened and frustrated by polarization in American life today, and I believe that the Civil War has lessons to teach us about how we can avoid deeper divisions in our country. I grew up in Maryland, a border state, and have relatives that fought for the North, as well as relatives who fought for the South. In addition, I have Quaker ancestors who hated slavery and supported the Union, but who would not fight because they were pacifists. I am passionate about understanding the tensions that have always run through American life, and want to explore the topic deeply in my reading and writing.\n\nHenry's book list on civil war novels and histories on global tensions\n\nWhy did Henry love this book?\n\nI love that the author introduced me to Robert Smalls, whose story has rarely been told. An enslaved man in South Carolina, he stole a Confederate ship and sailed to freedom, later becoming a member of the US Congress.\n\nI was angry that I had never known about Smalls, and this book has turned me into an evangelist for him. The author’s choice to tell his story in the first person was a risky move, but it paid off beautifully, allowing me to enter deeply into the life of a truly great man.\n\nBy Rebecca Dwight Bruff,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Trouble The Water as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n\"Before this decisive night, I’d not fully appreciated the subtle line between inspiration and insanity. But now, with all our lives at risk, I found myself navigating that most perilous edge . . . \"\n\nInspired by the life of an unsung American hero and slave, Trouble the Water navigates the rich tributaries of courage, betrayal, and redemption. In his inspiring journey, Robert Smalls witnesses great privilege and suffering alongside his owner’s daughter and the dangerous son of a firebrand secessionist. At the age of twelve, he’s sent to work in Charleston, where he loads ships and learns to pilot…\n\nPreview"
