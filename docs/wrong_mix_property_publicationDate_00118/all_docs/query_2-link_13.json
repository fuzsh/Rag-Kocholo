Unfortunately in the transition to the new version the italics were lost. I may try to restore these eventually, but it will take some time. In the meantime you will probably have no difficulty discerning which words make up the book titles.\n\nA\n\nAarons, Edward S. “The Makers of Destiny.” Fantasy and Science Fiction, September 1959.\n\nMutants with psychic powers are persecuted as sorcerers in 2065, long after the Ten Day Atomic War. The protagonist discovers that he has repressed the knowledge that it was his ancestor who mistakenly reacted to a French atomic power plant explosion by hitting Russia with an H-bomb, setting off the holocaust. Both the superpowers have declined into primitivism, with the United States torn by a new civil war. The other nations, led by China, seek to keep the United States backward. In this regard, compare with Kim Stanley Robinson, The Wild Shore, and Whitley Strieber and James Kunetka, Warday.\n\nAbbey, Edward. Good News. (Portions previously published in somewhat different form in New Times, Tucson Weekly News, and Tri-Quarterly.) New York: Dutton, 1980.An ill-assorted group of rebels battles a military tyrant in this above-average postholocaust adventure tale set in a time when civilization has collapsed from ecocatastrophe and the limited use of nuclear weapons in local conflicts. The most striking character is a wonder-working Indian shaman, but all the characters are vividly depicted and memorable. Abbey is the well-known author of The Monkey-Wrench Gang (1975).\n\nAbbey, Lloyd. The Last Whales. New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1989. London: Bantam, 1991. New York: Ballantine, 1991.\n\nNuclear winter and the end of humanity from the point of view of whales and dolphins. Filled with remarkably convincing details about the lives and deaths of sea mammals with very few human beings actually depicted. Killer whales share the role as villains with humans.\n\nAbe Kobo. The Ark Sakura. (Originally Hakobune no Sakura. Tokyo: Shinchosa, 1984.) Trans. Juliet Winters Carpenter. New York: Knopf, 1988.\n\nAn oddly-assorted group of people seeking shelter from the threat of nuclear war in a huge underground complex talk and quarrel about their situation and the invaders penetrating their stronghold. Their leader gets his foot stuck in a giant toilet, which seems to symbolize death. A huge dynamite explosion fools most of the people into believing a nuclear war has occurred, and they set about the grim business of surviving underground; but the fellow whose idea the ark was in the first place struggles out to the surface to find the city around him oddly transparent. It is not clear what this means, but perhaps a nuclear war really has happened. There is a mention of EMP knocking out computers. By the author of Woman of the Dunes and other well-known fiction.\n\nAbernathy, Robert. “Heirs Apparent” (Fantasy and Science Fiction, June 1954). In Anthony Boucher, ed.

Fine, 1985.\n\nDespite the original editor’s introduction scorning ordinary simple-minded anti-Soviet stories and noting that the author has a Ph.D. in Slavic from Harvard, this is a simple cold war parable. In post-World War III Russia, an isolated village struggles to survive, with a stranded American agricultural expert named Smith guiding it. When a dogmatic Communist Russian army colonel shows up, he asks the American what sort of infiltration he has been conducting. Replies our hero, Smith: “I was trying to beat part of a gunmounting into a plowshare.” He points out to the belligerent colonel that his multiple skills are the result of the free market economy in which he was raised, which allowed him to move from job to job. Although the colonel demonstrates his own skill in helping to fight off a marauding band of robbers, his un-American mentality leads him to endanger everyone by insisting on keeping the village’s cache of weapons under lock and key. Smith argues for the wisdom of the U.S. Constitution’s clause establishing the right to keep and bear arms. The wily villagers smuggle the weapons into their homes and are prepared for the next attack. The colonel is killed, and the robbers–believing that towns attract atomic bombs and that safety lies in perpetual nomadism–force the villagers to leave. A new dark age is beginning: “In the West the light faded, and night fell with the darkness sweeping on illimitable wings out of Asia.”\n\n___. “When the Rockets Come.” Astounding, March 1945.\n\nAtomic bombs are being used by the Earth army against Martian villages. One soldier is a particularly enthusiastic combatant. His colonel compliments him, saying his sort of spirit is rare in modern times: “The fighting blood!–humanity has bred it out and killed it out with machines. The last group of men on Earth who were selected and bred to fight was the flying aristocracy of the airplane age, and most of that strain was wiped out when the atomic blast was invented, because the fightless people–the soft people, if you like–could still hate and press buttons.” The soldier is captured, witnesses the effects of the bombing first hand, and is appalled, finally identifying with the Martians. Rather remarkable as a pre-Hiroshima story.\n\nAckerman, Forrest J. “The Mute Question” (Other Worlds, September 1950). In K[endell] F[oster] Crossen, ed. Adventures in Tomorrow.

Also in Robert Silverberg, ed. Mutants: Eleven Stories of Science Fiction. Nashville: Nelson, 1974.\n\nA one-page trifle in which two mutants speculate on their origin, recalling the myth that “Man’s son, Adam, created us all with the Adam bomb.” It ends with: “The muties have a proverb: Two heads are better than none.” Since in the body of the story the mutants are called “muties,” the title presumably involves a pun on “moot.”\n\nAdams, Ian. The Trudeau Papers. Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1971.\n\nA crazed Russian starts a nuclear exchange with the U.S.; but the missiles are exploded in mid-flight over Canada instead. The U.S. then occupies a devastated Canada.\n\nAdams, John. When the Gods Came. London: John Spencer, 1960. New York: Arcadia House, 1967.\n\nMutants and humans battle savagely on an Earth largely destroyed forty years earlier in a short atomic holocaust. Despite antiscientific bias on the part of the public, a remnant of the government has kept research going and is preparing a devastating nuclear attack on the last stronghold of the enemy. The hero, a telepathic astronomer, is suspected of being a mutant, but he proves to be a descendant of an alien race which landed on Earth five thousand years earlier. Under duress, he helps the government destroy the enemy, then flees Earth with others of his kind in a rocket fortuitously uncovered by the explosion of an enemy atomic bomb.\n\nAdams, Robert. The Coming of the Horseclans, Horseclans #1. Los Angeles: Pinnacle, 1975. New York: Signet, 1982.\n\nIt is 2550 A.D., six hundred years after the two-day war which plunged humanity back into barbarism. Most of southern California was tumbled into the Pacific, and various geologic upheavals have occurred since. Mutant telepaths who can communicate with jaguars and horses roam the plains and do battle with each other. There are lots of battle scenes, torture, and rape (especially rape of children). Mutant immortals called the “Undying” struggle against evil scientists from the prewar era who have perpetuated their minds by switching from body to body over the centuries. The mutant leader, Milo, aided by his wife (the short but sexy and mighty-in-battle Mara), takes the long view of rebuilding civilization: a few more centuries of barbaric combat will be necessary, enough to fill several books, at least. Other volumes in the series continue relentlessly portraying slaughter, torture, rape, incest, cannibalism, bestiality, necrophilia, etc. Adams emphasizes viciousness and obscenity to an extreme degree, only seldom touching on the theme of nuclear war. In volume 8 Adams kills off his favorite hero, but lets him linger on his deathbed reminiscing about past battles for four more volumes. Most of the sequels require no separate: treatment.\n\n___. #2: Swords of the Horseclans. Los Angeles: Pinnacle, 1976. New York: Signet, 1981. 3\n\n___. #3: Revenge of the Horseclans.

New York: Paperback Library, 1957.Battle against an interstellar monster named Karkong which feeds on nuclear power plants. Friendly aliens called the “Grid,” whose planet has been ravaged as a result of their refusal to use violent forms of assault on the beast, warn Earth. Although a macho admiral is frustrated in his desire to A-bomb the invader, the Russians do so, giving it vastly increased power. Finally Karkong is destroyed by penetrating its electric barrier with an advanced vehicle, allowing the Grid ship to strike it with lightning bolts. In exchange for their aid, the Grid are given Earth’s nuclear power secrets.Agawa Hiroyuki. Devil’s Heritage. Trans. John M. Maki. Tokyo: Hokuseido Press, 1957.Seven years after the war the protagonist is compiling a report on the casualties of the bombing of Hiroshima. A bitter, ironic attack on the American role in dropping the bomb and their later treatment of the Japanese. Some of those he interviews attack the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission for its failure to treat the injuries it studies and for what is seen as the callous and racist attitudes of some of its staff. Members of a group of bomb victims called the “Willow Society” recount various horrors: the deaths of school children, revolting wounds, bizarre symptoms of radiation poisoning. The bombing of Nagasaki is criticized as unnecessary; ABCC findings that mutation rates were not above normal are questioned. It is noted that General MacArthur’s wife helped to found a Japanese SPCA, but that the Americans displayed no comparable sympathy for human suffering. Some members of the Willow Society, however, argue that the Japanese themselves were partially responsible for the catastrophe that ended the war, and that they probably would have used the bomb themselves had they had it. According to one story, there was a rumor circulating in the hospitals that the Japanese did in fact have the bomb, had previously refrained from using it out of humanitarian considerations, but after the bombing of Hiroshima, had used it to destroy San Francisco and Los Angeles. Even deathly ill patients cheered at this news. The Japanese are not depicted as saintly victims: some of them cheated to get extra rations and insurance payments they were not owed, some stole watches and gold teeth from the dead. In general, however, the novel is intensely critical of the Americans, in contrast to the tone of Ibuse’s Black Rain, with which it should be compared. Agawa lacks Ibuse’s art, and a disproportionate amount of the book is dedicated to criticism of the ABCC, giving the work an odd focus which weakens its impact. The author credits two published nonfiction sources: Hachiya Michihiko’s Gembaku Zatsawa (translated as Hiroshima Diary [1955]) and Hayashi Yoshiro ‘s Ichiro (1951).\n\nAhern, Jerry. The Survivalist, #1, Total War. New York: Zebra, 1981. Former medical student, ex-CIA agent, soldier of fortune, and survivalist John Thomas Rourke battles his way through war-wasted America. A relentlessly brutal chain of scenes of bloody combat focuses much attention on equipment, as in the first scene where the author notes his hero stabs his opponent with an “A. G. Russell Sting IA boot knife.” Returned from Pakistan, where the Russians have invaded to protect the Afghanistan frontier, Rourke’s wife Sarah is deeply troubled by his obsession with violence, but still loves him. A world crisis looms, however, and she allows him to tell her for the first time about the elaborate mountain shelter he has built; but, unfortunately he doesn’t get around to telling her where it is. Interwoven with tales of love between individuals of the East and West, a confrontation over the Pakistan invasion builds toward war. The Russians destroy a U.S. submarine, then attack American military targets, trusting their newly perfected beam weapon to defend them from incoming missiles. When this news is announced, one of the passengers on Rourke’s plane (diverted from the now-destroyed Atlanta airport) has a heart attack, and Rourke shocks her heart into beating again with an electric hair dryer, then takes over the plane and crash-lands it. Meanwhile Sarah and the kids, having survived the initial attack, flee their house where leaking gas threatens an explosion, take up residence in the barn, and are promptly attacked by a band of would-be rapist-looters. Although she’s scarcely handled a gun before, she picks off three of them handily and incinerates the other two by firing bullets into the gas-saturated house. On the national scene, things are not going so well. The president, faced with incoming missiles, feels he has no choice but to order an attack. He then recites the Twenty-third Psalm and shoots himself to prevent the Russians from using him during the coming invasion. With four-fifths of the U.S. population and two-fifths of the Russians dead or dying, Britain has been destroyed and Western Europe invaded. (France is relatively intact for some reason; perhaps Ahern wished to avoid the tedium of repeating its experience of the first two world wars.) Most spectacularly of all, the bombs on the West Coast have caused half of California to fall into the ocean, just like those hippies used to say it would. In Chicago, which has been hit by “clean” neutron bombs, the Russians are landing. The midsection of the country will be an uninhabitable radioactive wasteland for a century or more, and the Earth may have been tilted off its axis, but only slightly. Meanwhile, Rourke treats as many of the wounded plane passengers as he can, and goes for help in a nearby city with four other men, three of whom desert. The exception is a young fellow named Rubenstein who will shed his citified naivete and learn to enjoy slaughtering his fellow citizens like his mentor. Rourke and Rubenstein find a Geiger counter, strip off their radioactive clothes, and Rourke shoots a pack of attacking dogs. Comments Rubenstein: “That was spectacular. . . . You would have made one hell of a great cowboy in the old west, John Rourke.” (Get along, little doggies?) Nine parts killer and one part lover, our hero unselfishly labors over the wounded in a makeshift hospital, returning to the plane to find the other passengers slaughtered by a gang of bikers. He kills all twelve of them, including a woman. (Ahern likes to include a token woman in his vicious gangs.) Rourke and Rubenstein recite the Twenty-third Psalm, torch the bodies, and slaughter forty more bikers from another gang. [46, 89-90]\n\n___. The Survivalist, #2, The Nightmare Begins. New York: Zebra,While the KGB is shooting teenage resistance fighters in Chicago, Rourke and Rubenstein are battling a paramilitary group and grimly eating their iron rations: baby food they’ve found in a truck, along with plenty of exactly the sort of ammunition they need. The two encounter a group of teenagers, all dying of radiation disease, who are bent on defending the town until their parents return. Rourke and Rubenstein rescue a beautiful KGB agent named Natalia whom Rourke eventually recognizes from a previous encounter in Latin America. Naturally she falls for Rourke, and when they are captured, helps them escape with the new president. Meanwhile Rourke’s wife has killed the black and white members of the gang who seized and tortured her neighbor. (Ahern practices nondiscrimination: his villains are frequently black, female, or very young.) She buries the victim, then falls ill from drinking contaminated water. Finally arriving back home, Rourke finds her message tacked to the barn door telling him she has left with another family, kills four marauding youths, and takes off.\n\n___. The Survivalist, #3, The Quest. New York: Zebra, 1981.Rourke gives Rubenstein a tour of his Retreat, an impregnable fortress hidden in a mountain cave, with special emphasis on weapons (enumerated by make) and books (unnamed). His shelter contains the stocks of food, clothing, and tools one would expect; it also includes a machine shop, a distillery for making alcohol fuel for his vehicles, and an artificially lit greenhouse. On his list of necessities is “one item that made his skin crawl because it represented something he couldn’t combat head-to-head: ‘Geiger counter’.” Indeed, although Rourke worries about radiation from time to time, he encounters none; a happenstance which lends support to his theory that survival is simply a matter of will power. Meanwhile, Natalia’s husband, General Karamatzov, has jealously beaten and raped her, and her uncle, seeking vengeance, arranges to have Rourke ambushed and captured so he can kill the general. Rourke, having promised Natalia that he would spare Karamatzov, strikes a compromise by gunning the Russian down in a Western-style duel. Meanwhile Sarah and the kids have made it to safety. Rourke and Sarah glimpse each other in the distance, but fail to connect. For no apparent reason, she decides she needs to move on looking for him just hours before he succeeds in tracing her to her retreat. Poor at getting together, the couple excels at faithfulness: both resist adulterous overtures.\n\n___. The Survivalist, #4, The Doomsayer. New York: Zebra, 1981.\n\nRelations between Russians and Cubans are strained; but a greater danger threatens Florida than armed combat. A beautiful young seismologist Rourke rescues from a gang of Brigands tells him that a new geological fault formed during the war threatens to dump the entire state into the sea in the near future. The story takes a science fictional turn as hints turn up of a mysterious “Eden Project” launched by NASA when the war began. Sarah has proven herself a true survivor by knifing a Russian soldier to death and hijacking the boat he has been guarding. Meanwhile, Rubenstein, off to St. Petersburg to visit his parents, discovers and breaks into one of the concentration camps set up by the vicious Cubans to whom Florida has been ceded. At the last moment before Florida collapses, he finds his parents. Much activity by the hapless resistance occurs in this novel. Rourke briefly joins the official army, though bitterly critical of the government officials who caused the war.\n\n___. The Survivalist, #5, The Web. New York: Zebra, 1983.\n\nRourke and his wife blast their way through the landscape, continually missing each other, although everyone else keeps stumbling into acquaintances in the most unlikely fashion. Florida is evacuated. Natalia turns renegade, and gives Rubenstein photographs of the captured plans of the Eden Project. Meanwhile Sarah exchanges favors with a Russian officer. It is clearer as these books go on that the professionals on both sides have far more respect for each other than for their less disciplined comrades. The outstanding episode of this volume is Rourke’s encounter with the nonsurvivalists of the little town of Barrington, Kentucky, where the main industry is the manufacture of fireworks. In a plot reminiscent of Jonestown, these folks give their kids one last whale of a Fourth of July and blow themselves up. An attractive librarian with spiderlike propensities keeps Rourke tied up and drugged in her basement so they can die together. Through a combination of martial arts and vitamin B-complex shots, Rourke escapes.\n\n___. The Survivalist, #6, The Savage Horde. New York: Zebra, 1983.\n\nA reunited team of Natalia, Rubenstein, and Rourke is coerced into helping a fanatical military leader battle fanatical Wildmen in order to secure atomic missiles to be used against Russian headquarters in Chicago. Meanwhile Sarah continues to fight Brigands with the aid of her eight-year-old son, who is developing into quite a promising killer.\n\n___. The Survivalist, #7, The Prophet. New York: Zebra, 1984.\n\nRourke defeats the Wildmen with Sidewinder missiles fired from an experimental fighter and thwarts the schemes of the renegade sub commander (who compares himself to the hero of On the Beach) to bomb Chicago. The weather turns ominous as the Russians continue to explore the military shelter known as “The Womb.”\n\n___. The Survivalist, #8, The End Is Coming. New York: Zebra, 1984.Rourke is reunited with his family and learns new respect for Sarah as she and their son join in a shootout with some Brigands. (The family that slays together, stays together.) Meanwhile, the Russians have discovered the secret of the mysterious Eden Project. The aftermath of the war is about to annihilate all life on Earth save that protected by a special serum and frozen for five hundred years. The Eden Project is a group of 120 humans with associated animal embryos which have been launched into orbit to await Earth’s rebirth. The Russians plot to seal themselves in The Womb (which turns out to be the former NORAD headquarters) and inherit the Earth themselves. Natalia’s guardian, a decent Russian, offers serum to Rourke’s fam fly in return for safe delivery of her to him in Chicago.\n\n___. The Survivalist, #9, Earth Fire. New York: Zebra, 1984.Rourke and his companions foil the Russian plot to destroy the Eden Project by wrecking their particle beam weapons and plundering their secret base. They take enough supplies to preserve themselves in the Retreat for five hundred years, unfortunately leaving behind with the evil KGB commander one vial of serum. The commander is apparently killed in a final assault on the Retreat, just as the sky catches fire and exterminates all animal life on Earth.\n\n___. The Survivalist, #10, The Awakening. New York: Zebra, 1984.Exactly 481 years later, Rourke awakes, trains his kids for five years in the art of killing, then puts himself back in suspended animation for sixteen years so that he, they, his wife, Natalia, and Rubenstein will all be of roughly the same age. Just before the others are due to awaken, son Michael goes exploring, discovers cannibals and a group of vicious survivors from a huge supershelter (it features a nine-hole golf course!) who have rigidly limited their numbers through ritual killing. He rescues a young woman with whom he plans to mate, but is captured. They are rescued by Rourke, Natalia, and Rubenstein in a bloody battle. At the end of the novel the Eden Project is sighted returning, and we learn that the KGB commander has survived after all and is still seeking vengeance on Rourke.\n\n___.

New York: Berkley, 1964.It’s Munich revisited as a cowardly British government abrogates its treaties and declares neutrality in an American-Russian conflict which began in Sumatra. The Chinese claim they have hit Hong Kong with a nuclear bomb by accident. Satellite warfare rages. A British Communist party member assassinates a NATO deputy supreme commander. Russia launches an allout strike against the United States, but a new “geogravatic flux shield” stops all the missiles. The American president calls upon the Russians to give in, noting that peace is possible only because the British have remained neutral. Most of the story is a preachy critique of the disarmament movement, and the ending portrays a prime minister determined to cling to power.

This effect is used mainly to create various incongruities after the manner of Aldiss’s postpsychedelic war novel Barefoot in the Head (1972). The Danube, blocked by a bomb, creates a European inland sea. The subtitle is a pun referring both to the nature of the plot and to the fact that the characters burst into song at intervals.\n\n___. “FOAM,” New Worlds, 1 (1991). Rpt. in A Tupolev Too Far.

The USSR has also attacked China.\n\n___. Moreau’s Other Island. London: Jonathan Cape, 1980. Retitled An Island Called Moreau. New York: Timescape, 1981.\n\nDuring a nuclear war between the United States and China on one side, and the USSR on the other, an undersecretary of state crash-lands in a space shuttle near a South Pacific island where a thalidomide victim named Dart continues the experiments of H. G. Wells’s Dr. Moreau in the creation of half-human monsters. After various adventures and a frolic with supersensual Japanese seal-people, the undersecretary discovers that the island is a secret project of his own department intended to design a radiation-resistant race of humanoids for life after nuclear war. As in Wells’s Island of Dr. Moreau (1896), the beasts revolt, and their creator is killed. In an epilogue, the war goes on, but whether the ocean’s recuperative powers can cope with this disaster is unknown.\n\nAlexander, David. Phoenix #1: Dark Messiah. New York: Leisure, 1987.

New York: Avon, 1969.\n\nA ruthless “loner” wanders through a wasted landscape, battling savage “flockers” (settlers) and “neanderthals” (crazed nomads), in quest of the perfect female. He joins an isolated settlement in an abandoned department store and duels with its ruler for possession of his woman. His ideal proves illusory, however, and he plunges back into the wilderness with an earthier female companion, seeking the fabled northern settlement of peace and progress called Genesis. For some reason, the nuclear bombs have prevented any rain from falling for years, but at the end of the novel hope is signaled by the onset of a shower. Basically a simple action yarn with very stereotyped manipulative, predatory women (although you can buy any of them for a piece of a tube of lipstick). The hero, however, is considerably more thoughtful and complex than the average pulp hero. Alvarez, John. See under del Rey, Lester.\n\nAmen, Carol. “The Last Testament.” St. Anthony Messenger, September, 1980. Also in Ms., August, 1981.\n\nThis story, in the form of a journal, describes the suffering and death of a suburban family when the world is destroyed by nuclear war. At first people try to deny that the ill effects they experience are caused by fallout, even when babies begin to die. There is hoarding, but no rioting, looting, or rape. Source of the script for the 1983 film Testament. Compare with Clarkson, The Last Day, and Merril, Shadow on the Hearth.\n\nAmis, Martin. “The Little Puppy That Could,” in Einstein’s Monsters. British edition? New York: Harmony, 1987. New York: Vintage, 1990.\n\nThe story begins deceptively as a sentimental tale of a frolicsome puppy befriending a young girl; but it soon becomes apparent that humans fear and distrust dogs since a nuclear war has made the dogs human-eaters and rendered the humans defenseless. Mu tated humans are in fact ceremonially fed to a dog-beast. Women are now stronger than men. The days of the week have been renamed Sunday, Moonday, Tearsday, Woundsday, Thirstday, Fireday, and Shatterday.\n\n___. “The Time Disease,” in Einstein’s Monsters. New York: Harmony, 1987.\n\nTime is a debilitating disease which haunts a crowded and polluted world where the sky is discolored by the aftermath of limited nuclear wars. Sex is rare because of fear of disease and widespread depression. People live vicariously through television actors who write their own lines.\n\nAmrine, Michael. Secret. Cambridge, Mass.: Houghton Mifflin, 1950.\n\nA middle-aged scientist becomes involved in the Manhattan Project and works at Oak Ridge, witnesses the Trinity test, and investigates the after-effects of radiation in Hiroshima (this phase of his career is skipped over quickly). Little detail is provided about the bomb; the novel is mainly concerned with the security problems of its protagonist, which mirror those of Robert Oppenheimer. Clearly, the author is attacking Oppenheimer’s persecutors. Deeply troubled by the moral implications of his involvement with the project, the scientist becomes active in advocating international control of atomic energy along the lines proposed by the Baruch Plan. Finally cleared by an investigation, he is asked to join a research project, headed by an ex-Nazi, to build a new radiation superweapon. He is ambivalent, but about to begin work, when the novel ends. He is said to have been a fan of “Astounding Fiction.” A very serious if somewhat ineptly written meditation on the responsibility of scientists for the bomb. Anderson, Andy.

London: Panther, 1965.\n\nThree hundred men aboard an interstellar ship return to Earth to find it has been destroyed by an unknown enemy and that they themselves are under attack from a barrage of nuclear missiles. They go in search of the culprits and of a European ship crewed by women. The men rage, the women take tranquillizers to combat hysteria; the men fight, the women engage in trade. Finally it is revealed that a renegade world is responsible for Earth’s death–it will be horribly punished by the rulers of an interplanetary federation. Meanwhile, men and women are reunited, but since there are more women than men, they will practice polyandry, except for the leaders, who prefer monogamy.\n\n___. “A Chapter of Revelation.” In Lester del Rey, ed. The Day the Earth Stood Still: Three Original Novellas of Science Fiction. Nashville: Nelson, 1972.One of three stories (the others are Robert Silverberg’s “Thomas the Proclaimer” and Gordon R. Dickson’s “Things Which Are Caesar’s”) based on a common premise: that a miracle causes the sun to stand still. In Anderson’s tale, the miracle halts the threat of a nuclear war which had begun with an exchange of bombs between the United States and China. The Russian and Chinese armies dissolve, but the Israelis attack Jordan and Syria. The garage owner who had originally thought of the idea of praying for such a miracle cannot think of any appropriate response to its occurrence; disillusioned mobs destroy his property and kill him. There is only muted hope for something better to emerge out of what seems to be the collapse of civilization.\n\n___. “Cold Victory” (Venture Science Fiction, May 1957).

Maurai and Kith. New York: Tor, 1982.\n\nThree stories from the Maurai series together with two stories related to each other but without any bearing on nuclear war: “Ghetto” and “The Horn of Time the Hunter.”\n\n___. “The Sky People” (Fantasy and Science Fiction, March 1959).

New York: Dell, 1962.\n\nThe Maurai, descendants of New Zealand’s Maori, are the most powerful race in a world devastated by nuclear war. With a near- monopoly on technology, they ceaselessly strive to enforce an ecologically sound way of life, banning the use of nonrenewable resources and nuclear technology. In this story they use flame-throwers to battle pirates flying in blimps, asserting their control over international trade. As is true of many of these stories, the superiority of high technology over traditional Maurai culture is argued.\n\n___. “Progress” (Fantasy and Science Fiction, January 1962). Also in The Horn of Time. New York: Signet, 1968.Two hundred years later, a Maurai spy mission to India uncovers the secret construction of a fusion reactor and tries to destroy it.

Aliens manipulate the course of history, setting up a fake group of “espers” supplied with advanced technology, pressuring the human race toward a communitarian, non-materialistic culture, fearing that belligerent humans once more equipped with nuclear weapons will invade the galaxy Emphasis is on battle. Humans–as in most such stories–reject their guardianship; but, in a surprise ending, the hero’s daughter decides to ally herself with the alien cause.\n\n___. Orion Shall Rise. New York: Timescape, 1983. New York: Pocket Books, 1984.\n\nA long, complex novel set in the world of Anderson’s Maurai stories, centuries after the devastating war known variously as “The Doom War,” “The Downfall,” and the “Death Time.” Among other matters this work details a plot by the Northwest Union (the northwestern portion of the former United States) to develop spacecraft powered by nuclear explosives to challenge the domination of their benevolent rulers who have restricted the development of technology. Although Anderson argues here in favor of nuclear power, limited nuclear war, whaling and space colonization, and against gun control, he is careful not to portray any one side of the several-sided conflict as wholly good or evil, and it is difficult to guess which will emerge triumphant–unless one already knows the author’s politics. A superior political thriller with some fairly good characterization and at least one strong female character, although most of the women function primarily as lovers. Note that the NASA proposal to use small nuclear bombs to propel a space rocket was called the “Orion Project.” [More]\n\n___. Shield.

Series of linked stories: “Prologue” as “Tomorrow’s Children” in Astounding, March 1947 (see below, under Anderson and Waldrop); “Chain of Logic” as “Logic” in Astounding, March 1947; “The Children of Fortune,” and “Epilogue,” new to this edition.”Prologue” is set two years after the war. Europe has been devastated, but parts of the Soviet Union (now dissolved into smaller states) and the United States are slowly recovering. A census is to be conducted to find out how many people have survived. Meanwhile it is becoming apparent that radioactive fallout has created a far greater number of mutations than might have been expected. In “Chain of Logic” eugenics is discussed and discarded and the possibility of the emergence of beneficial mutations discarded, yet at the story’s end a super-logical mutant boy saves a town from bandits. More such favorable mutants are gathered together in “The Children of Fortune,” and together they build a spaceship and take off to colonize Mars. There they encounter and battle their Siberian (i.e., Russian) counterparts, who wish to kidnap them and use them in a breeding program to create a super-race which will rule over the rest of humanity. The Siberians are defeated. In “Epilogue,” set some thousands of years later, Earth is a barren wasteland, investigated by archeologists descended from the original mutated settlers of Mars who have moved on to colonize Jupiter’s satellite Ganymede and other bodies. As in his other works, Anderson relies on high technology to solve problems. These stories fit in with the general theme of sympathy with homo superior.\n\n___. Vault of the Ages.

Beyond Armageddon: Twenty-one Sermons to the Dead. New York: _3 Donald I. Fine, 1985.After a two-year war involving atomic and bacteriological weapons, few people survive, and the majority of births are abnormal. A mild form of nuclear winter is described: “The last three winters had come early and stayed long. Dust, colloidal dust of the bombs, suspended in the atmosphere and cutting down the solar constant by a deadly percent or two.” A general who argues in favor of eugenic sterilizations must be convinced that there is no future for the unmutated human race. The story implicitly criticizes simplistic stories of survival, but is not entirely pessimistic. The general comments, “You were right. We should never have created science. It brought the twilight of the race.” The protagonist replies, “I never said that. The race brought its own destruction, through misuse of science. Our culture was scientific anyway, in all except its psychological basis. It’s up to us to take that last and hardest step. If we do, the race may yet survive.” This was Anderson’s first published story, and was later incorporated into Twilight World as “Prologue” (see above).

New York: Doubleday, 1990.\n\nA history professor travels back in time and strives to prevent the nuclear bomb from being dropped on Japan, but what he experiences in World War II teaches him instead the necessity of the atomic destruction of Hiroshima. The Japanese, it seems, besides carrying out inhuman experiments on captive subjects and developing a jet engine with the help of Amelia Earhart were developing the atomic bomb themselves. Modern Japanese are also depicted as corrupt and malevolent. A powerful anti-Japanese tirade presented as an adventure story.\n\nAriss, Bruce. Full Circle. New York: Avalon, 1963.Almost the only survivors of the War of Poisoned Lightning are a million Indians scattered across the New World. Even the larger mammals are extinct. The Indians have banned all explosive weapons and the use of their simpler ones against each other, outlawed technology of all sorts, and alcohol. Atomic research is particularly taboo. Yet these are no simple primitives: their rejection of earlier technology comes from a sophisticated understanding of history. But trapped deep beneath Mount Rushmore one young man and eight women and girls survive, descendants of TOAD (Take Over After Destruction Project). When they emerge, all of them die of poison ivy except for the young man and his sister. He insists on following his orders to explore the world for surviving enemies in order to exterminate them with stored nuclear weapons, but finally learns there is no one left to fight. Then he plays a tape which reveals that the holocaust was mistakenly set off by the misinterpretation of a gigantic meteor impact. The two whites marry Indians and adopt their ways. Although some technology may be reintroduced into their culture, precautions will be taken to prevent a recurrence of the ancient tragedy.\n\nArmbruster, Frank E., et al.

One chapter, “The Vens Get a Nuke,” in Fantasy and Science Fiction, August 1987.\n\nA bizarre adventure story inspired by the common antiwar argument that if the button to launch a nuclear attack were implanted in the heart of a human being, a leader would be deterred from doing so. This thought experiment is emptied of all its meaning as five years after The Zap a group of nukers roam Alaska in an old Wonder Bread blimp, handing out what they claim are small nuclear devices and installing nuclear bomb triggers in the chests of the recipients’ loved ones. Although the bombs turn out to be fakes, the point of the exercise remains unclear. The Zap was a violent burst of EMP which scrambled the brains of the surviving people in various weird ways, including loss of memory. In the end, the protagonist realizes that he was the creator of the Zap Bomb whose effects he detests so much.\n\n___. Agviq. New York: Popular Libary, 1990. Expanded from Going After Arviq.

New York: Ballantine, 1983. London: Corgi, 1958. London: Sidgwick & Jackson, 1968. Also in Triangle. Garden City: New York, Doubleday, 1961.A freak atomic accident transports the hero from 1949 thousands of years into the future to a time when Earth is largely a radioactive wasteland, populated by a few million inhabitants who are discriminated against by the rest of the galactic empire which has forgotten that Earth was humanity’s original home. The hero foils a plot by xenophobic rebels to spread “radiation fever”–evolved in the hot zones created by the ancient holocaust–throughout the empire, killing everyone else. In a 1982 afterword, Asimov acknowledged that he no longer believed humans could survive on a radioactive Earth such as that depicted in this novel.\n\nAsterley, H[ugh] C[ecil]. Escape to Berkshire. London & Dunmow: Pall Mall, 1961.In this artless but effective picture of London in ruins, Asterley uses far more Hiroshima-style details than most writers: peeling strips of flesh, terrible sores, nakedness, etc. Yet he also introduces fantastic elements: the enemy is a dark-skinned race of unknown nationality, and the major threat to life in the countryside is a poisonous mycospore which grows over everyone and everything not treated with an antidote. The narrator (Tom, a former soldier) and his fiancée (Jill, a devout Christian who abhors violence) were trapped in an underground station when the H-bomb went off. The perimeter of the enormous crater which once was London has been dusted with radioactive elements beyond 150: neronium, rhadamanthium, satanium. After Tom saves Jill, he is almost forced to kill an old woman who insanely blames him for the death of her three children, but she providentially falls to her death. A man who has been robbing the dead takes Jill’s crucifix and engagement ring, but a cockney paracommando kills him, allowing Tom to have the thief’s nuclear pistol. Tom tries to free a group of people trapped underground, but succeeds only in blasting a hole through the crater wall, releasing a torrent which will eventually flood the London crater. A blind man asks whether he is dead, and Tom wants to put him out of his misery, but Jill rejects the idea. They find Tom’s father dead, his house looted. They are caught between the vicious invaders who seem bent on exterminating the inhabitants, and the ruthless army patrols who shoot everyone suspected of looting. The heads of government are safely and ineffectually stowed on a submarine offshore. At Jill’s suggestion, she and Tom set out for the home of a Berkshire priest with whom they had previously become acquainted. When Jill is seized by the enemy, Tom kills most of them, rescues her and forces their hovercraft to take them on their way. From the dying pilot they acquire the mycotoxin antidote which will save their lives. They find a pair of children and take them with them.\n\nAustin, Richard (pseud. of Victor Milan). The Guardians. New York: Jove, 1985.At the climax of international tensions partly caused by increasing U.S. covert military involvment in other nations, the USSR and her allies invade Western Europe, but the Polish, Czech, and Hungarian armies rebel, China and the Arab nations separately invade the Soviet Union, and other Eastern bloc nation’s break away. In desperation, the USSR launches a nuclear strike in Europe, leading to a full-scale nuclear exchange which is referred to as the One-Day War. Civil defense plans on both sides fail, although shielding is used against EMP. 110 million Americans and 130 million Russians die. Unusually for this sort of action story, there is a great deal of attention paid to depicting the gruesome wounds of the bomb victims. The elite Guardians are a group of highly-trained military men whose mission is to escort the President to a midwestern supershelter known as Heartland. Their leader, McKay, is rescued from a menacing gang of street toughs near the beginning of the novel when a last H-bomb explodes over Washington D.C. Corrupt CIA men make a treasonous attempt to kidnap the president to make him a puppet of the mysterious European dictator Maximov; but the Guardians defeat them and drive the President in their heavily armored vehicle across the radioactive countryside. The National Guard creates a dictatorship which must be crushed in a bloody battle. At the end of the novel, it is revealed that their next important task is to find the missing “Blueprint for Renewal” which will enable the country to rebuild in the wake of the holocaust.\n\n___. The Guardians [#2], Trial by Fire. New York: 1985.Two weeks after the holocaust, conflicts are spreading around the globe. In the chaos of fallen America survivalists are especially targeted by the population as enemies. A sinister International Council rules Europe while the corrupt chief of the CIA rules the U.S. The Russians have landed in Alaska. A cult of antitechnological fanatics led by a villainous right-wing preacher is assaulting a nuclear research center in Kansas City, and the Guardians must rescue from it a crucial scientist who has some knowledge of the vital “Blueprint for Renewal”; but he is immediately killed, muttering the mysterious word, “Mahal,” and the center falls to the mob. They discover that the Federal Center outside Denver has been taken over by cultists who seize two of the Guardians. The latter are tortured by a demonic figure clearly modelled on William F. Buckley. They are destined to die by radiation exposure in a bomb crater on Cheyenne Mountain when they are rescued at the last moment by their comrades. They then discover the last living expert on the Blueprint (a female economist) living in a libertarian freehold which is invaded by cultists using nerve gas. The cult leader is killed and the townspeople avenged. Chapter 1 begins with a character playing the nuclear war video game, Missile Command. There are references to the Mad Max films, to similar postholocaust films, and to The Day After.\n\n___. The Guardians [#3], Thunder of Hell. New York: Jove, 1985. London: Pan, 1990.The Guardians battle their way past cannibals to California, where the former lieutenant governor has set up a dictatorship headquartered at the old Hearst castle of San Simeon. The plot is complex, with many rival political groups struggling for power. The dictator has begun a collaboration with a group of Russian renegades under the mistaken impression that they represent the Soviet government. A right wing general sets himself up as a rival dictator. California is full of cultish groups, including a vicious offshoot of the United Farmworkers called the California Liberation Front. Leftists who have acquired an H-bomb kill each other off in a factional dispute; but a surviving leader takes the bomb to Disneyland and tries to set it off–unsuccessfully, because it has been sabotaged by one of the Russians. Road gypsies inspired by the Mad Max films are depicted. The nuclear winter theory is criticized. The author refers to Larry Niven and Jerry Pournell’s Lucifer’s Hammer (1977).\n\n___. The Guardians [#4], Night of the Phoenix. New York: Jove, 1985. London: Pan, 1990.The President turns up, asserting his authority, and accusing the Guardians and the Vice-President of treason. However, the Guardians discover that it is the President himself who is the traitor, for he has become a tool of the evil Federated States of Europe (FSE). They invade Heartland, seize the information it holds on the Blueprint, and destroy the complex. In the process they are joined by a new ally: a muscular black woman.\n\n___. The Guardians [#5], Armageddon Run. New York: Jove, 1986.The Guardians take the former Vice President, now President, to Kansas city where they discover that its black mayor is yet another traitor fronting for the FSE’s world government plot, which is being assisted by Soviet troops.

Toronto: Gold Eagle, 1986.\n\nNuclear winter still grips Alaska nearly a century after Doomsday: June 20, 2001. The west coast fell into the ocean. A brutal band of barbaric Russians called Narodniki invade Alaska, pursued by regular Russian troops, and battle a band of heroic Ameri cans led by Ryan Cawdor. They must also deal with bizarre mutants living in a deep supershelter. They encounter a tribe which worships nuclear war a nd practices human sacrifice and destroy it using a leftover nuclear missile. After the Narodniki are destroyed, the Russians return to Russia.

When Palestinian terrorists hijack a plane containing the families of the crew of a nuclear submarine and land it at a Russian base in Ethiopia, the sub crew decides on its own to use nuclear blackmail to force the Russians to allow the marines to rescue their families. First the Russians try to eliminate the sub, but they are defeated by its superior defenses. In the process, a nuclear bomb on board a Russian helicopter is accidentally detonated, but fails to damage the sub. The crew and captain are given presidential pardons for their mutinous independent action.\n\nBalabukha, Andrei. “Appendix.” Originally “Appendiks” in Fantastika-67. Moscow: Molodaia Gvardiia, 1968.

One such was wrecked by thermonuclear bombs. Using a device which allows travel into the past, they send an agent to assassinate the scientist who would otherwise have gone on to invent the bomb. The planet, which turns out to be an alternative version of our Earth, is allowed peacefully to develop and spread its civilization into space. However, the explorers lament the killing which they have had to commit, even though it was done for the best of motives.\n\nBalint, Emery. Don’t Inhale It! New York: Gaer, 1949.A satire on international tensions by a self-proclaimed leftist in which the Earth is accidentally split in two by a bomb test, and the Eastern and Western hemispheres become separate planets. Animosity between North and South America leads to a war which in turn splits that planetoid into two smaller fragments, then the Northern Hemisphere is split again. Presented as a parable of the danger of the atomic bomb.\n\nBalizet, Carol. The Seven Last Years. Lincoln, Va.: Chosen Books, 1978.A fictionalized version of the Apocalypse, based on the author’s interpretation of biblical prophecies. Armageddon consists of a three-sided war: Israel versus an Arab-African coalition versus the Russians. The U.S. Iaunches its nuclear weapons against the USSR, China retaliates, and the result is a massive holocaust, producing clouds which blanket the sun. Devastating earthquakes are triggered as well. One old couple is depicted dying of radiation disease. The nuclear phase of the Apocalypse is only briefly dealt with in this fairly effective, earnestly Christian novel.\n\nBall, Florence E.

They succeed brilliantly, meeting Marco Polo at Kubla Khan’s court before subduing China. With the aid of the mystical powers of powerful Tibetan lamas, the crusaders are enabled to destroy Baphomet and claim the fruits of their victory.

Paris: Presses de la cité, 1968. Trans. Charles Lam Markmann. London: Hart-Davis, 1970. New York: Morrow, 1971. New York: Pyramid, 1973.In this old-fashioned fantasy, two survivors of a 900,000-year-old atomic war–caused by overpopulation–are discovered frozen in Antarctica. The world of the frame story is divided into the evil Ensorians with Asian features and the good, blond Gondawans. The survivors tell of a series of world wars, the last of which destroyed their civilization, despite massive student protests (clearly reflecting Paris in 1968). They offer the world future technology to create paradise, but governments sabotage the deal and the couple dies in a Romeo-and-Juliet style tragedy of errors. Contains a warning that the building of the ultimate deterrent may prompt a preemptive strike. Very fantastic, unrealistic.\n\nBarnes, John. The Man Who Pulled Down the Sky. New York: Congdon and Weed, 1986. City?: Worldwide Library, 1988.Following the catastrophic troubles of the nineteen-nineties and twenty-thirties, a 2034 limited nuclear war in the Middle East led to the destruction of two-thirds of the ozone layer, and the burning of the oil fields increased atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide enough to alter the weather. Most of Earth’s inhabitants have died, and the rest are short-lived, often succuming to ultraviolet radiation-induced cancer. Space colonies orbiting near the Earth rule the rest of humanity. The plot concerns a joint rebellion of the outer space colonies and subject surface-dwellers against the dominant space colonies. At one point the latter use a tactical nuclear weapon to destroy their own soldiers who have been captured in an attempt to make it appear that the rebels have used the bomb. This will discredit them, since the use of nuclear weapons is powerfully tabooed. A fairly routine combat story, but with an interesting pro-collectivist bias.\n\nBarnwell, William. The Blessing Papers. New York: Pocket Books, 1980. Sequels: Imram and The Sigma Curve.Long after the Fires and the Falling of 2020, the hero seeks in a neobarbarian world to recover the box of papers which contain the secrets of earlier wisdom.

He also begets a son whose genes have been altered by the Gort.\n\n___. The Sigma Curve. New York: Timescape, 1981. Sequel to Imram.It is revealed that the Falling of 2020 was deliberately caused by a conspiracy to save humanity from an otherwise inevitable apocalyptic ending. In none of these volumes is the Falling unambiguously stated to be a nuclear war, but it seems likely. Turly’s son reestablishes communication with a satellite which will begin humanity on the road to rebuilding civilization.\n\nBarr, Densil N[eve] [pseud. of Douglas Norton Buttrey]. The Man with Only One Head. London: Rich & Cowan, 1955. London: Digit, 1962.A cobalt bomb detonated under mysterious circumstances by the U.S. creates a blanket of fog around the entire Earth which destroys all insects and renders all men sterile except a reclusive millionaire named Vince Adams. Lacking the deterrent of unwanted pregnancy, the World Federation of Nations makes adultery a capital crime and stupidly condemns the one man who can perpetuate the race. He escapes to live secretly in Brazil, and fertility is restored to all men by the discovery of a new medical treatment. This is a less coy reworking of the theme of Pat Frank’s Mr. Adam (1946). The book is essentially a satire, particularly ridiculing a big newspaper editor who says, alarmed: “Every man, woman and child has lived for nearly a month in an atmosphere lousy with atoms. . . .” Rejects the notion that “atomic secrets” can be hidden. The book contains a very brief mention of a subsequent World War III, “sometimes called the Six Hour War.” Later, lead–useful as shielding–is more valuable than gold. The author also mocks the notion, common to several other novels, that the world will be improved by a nuclear catastrophe.\n\nBarr, Tyrone C. The Last Fourteen. London: Digit, 1959. London: Chariot, 1960.When the rest of humanity is destroyed in a nuclear war, five women and nine men survive aboard an experimental space station called the “wheorld” (for “wheel world”). The captain forstalls problems by rigidly separating men and women for three years until Earth has recovered sufficiently to land. He then rather surprisingly promulgates a set of utopian regulations requiring nudity, free sex, communal child-rearing, a deistic civil religion, and an ideal communist economy. Traditional religions are banned, as are competitive sports and gambling. Breaches of the law are to be punished with death. It is hoped that the ruthless execution of all violent individuals will result in the breeding of a new, peaceful race of humanity. The only dissenter to these proposals is a priest who later turns out to be the murderer of two of their number. (He is trying to keep secret the fact that he once raped a child.) Most of the narrative focuses on the sexual tensions and jealousies of the survivors, who quickly revert to monogamy (the captain first of all, oddly enough). Earth has been transformed: giant grasses which taste like melons thrive; there are mammoth shrimp, amphibious salmon, and gigantic toads. The planet now resembles the land of Oz in that almost everything they encounter is good to eat. The most dangerous animal they find is a huge, unfeathered duck. At the novel’s end, a crude, bullying fellow has declared himself dictator and the survivors have split into two rival factions; but a woman insists that they must not repeat the mistakes of the past in reinventing war. This summary may give the impression that the work is a simple anti-utopian satire, but the impression one gets from reading it is more ambiguous. One of the more implausible and poorly written of these books.\n\nBarrett, G[eoffrey] J[ohn]. City of the First Time. London: Robert Hale, 1975.Three thousand survivors of a March 2001 Armageddon are threatened in their deep underground shelter by the progressive failure of seals in layers above them. They explore a connecting network of caves, stumbling upon a subterranean city of telepathic survivors of an ancient atomic war predating humanity. Both races were planted on Earth by spacefaring aliens. Fighting breaks out and all seems lost, but the hope is asserted that in the distant future–even though yet another race will probably fight yet another apocalyptic atomic war–the path to peaceful coexistence will be discovered.\n\nBarrett, Neal.

London: Granada, 1983.Conflicts in Central America and the Mideast lead to a nuclear war and the collapse of civilization. A veteran of the Marine Air Corps struggles his way though the skeleton-littered ruins in search of his ex-wife and children, killing feral cats and dogs and savage humans. In New Orleans he battles the black supremacist leader of a cannibalistic cult which blames whites for the war. Radiation “mutates” people into monsters with whom the hero allies himself against the blacks. Consists mainly of brutal combat scenes featuring bizarre opponents: “Something with too many teeth and too much hair was doubled over, spilling entrails as it cannoned against a figure that would have been normal had it not stood over seven feet tall with a hump reaching another foot above its head.”\n\n___. Wasteworld 2: Resurrection. London: Granada, 1983.Having defeated a black racist cult, the hero now battles a white racist dictatorship led by his former father-in-law. He also encounters giant tarantulas, gila monsters, and bizarre mutants called “Nightmen” who dwell in bomb craters and worship radioactivity. He organizes a Nightmen army to destroy the dictatorship.\n\n___. Wasteworld 3: Angels. London: Granada, 1984.Besides destroying a band of Nightmen, his former allies, the hero must deal with the bizarre Church of Christ Without Christ, a motorcycle gang (hence the book’s title), and mutants and giant rabid bats in the Carlsbad Caverns as he seeks for gasoline to continue his quest. At the end of the novel he is joined by an Apache woman who promises to become an interesting companion.\n\n___. Wasteworld 4: My Way. London: Granada, 1984.\n\nBasile, Gloria Vitanza (pseud. of Michaela Morgan). Eye of the Eagle: Global 2000. New York: Pinnacle, 1983.This absurd thriller details an enormous conspiracy which culminates in the obliteration of the Middle East through nuclear bombing. Practically no attention is paid to the consequences of the bombing, and those consequences mentioned are absurd: the Persian Gulf is evaporated into desert and half of Africa is destroyed. The narrative is unusual in that the holocaust is presented first, in a prologue, followed by the intrigue which leads up to it. Reads like a parody of the typical macho thriller, peppered with violence, obscenities, and ersatz French and German. This is the first in a series of thrillers by Basile with the overall title Global 2000. The second volume, The Jackal Helix (1984), is a “prequel” detailing the background of the conspiracy of the first, and has no relevance to nuclear war.\n\n___. The Sting of the Scorpion, Global 2000, Book III. New York: Pinnacle, 1984.This concluding volume of the trilogy begins during World War 11. An ominous supercomputer named “Colossus” (like that of D. E Jones) is mentioned in passing but never dealt with. The last part of the novel is set shortly after the limited nuclear war of Eye of the Eagle, and deals with the crushing of a world-spanning conspiracy. Very little more is said about nuclear war.\n\nBear, Greg. Eon. New York: Bluejay, 1985. New York: Tor, 1986. London: Legend, 1987.In 1993 a limited nuclear war called the “Little Death” involving strategic defense space weaponry leads to an all our-war with four million casualties. “The Death” proper ensues, killing two and a half billion of Earth’s inhabitants and bringing in its wake the Long Winter. A cult called the retreatists arises which reveres Ralph Nader and opposes high technology. On the eve of the Death, an international expedition is sent to explore a mysterious asteroid, which turns out to come from the future, bearing a warning of the holocaust about to occur. Efforts to avert the impending catastrophe fail because of international distrust in particular the stubborn dogmatism of the Russians. However, the asteroid also turns out to be a gateway linking the solar system to a vast intergalactic network, and also providing access to alternate worlds. Although the destruction of our Earth cannot be prevented, various characters are able to escape to alternate worlds at the end of the novel. A spectacular high-tech space adventure reminiscent of Rendezvous with Rama, but with more memorable characters, including its intelligent and capable female protagonist. Sequel: Eternity.\n\n___. Eternity. New York: Warner, 1988. New York: Science Fiction Book Club, 1989. London: Gollancz, 1989. Sequel to Eon.This novel’s complex plot involves the threat of the destruction of the entire universe, a disaster which dwarfs the nuclear holocaust which has blighted but not entirely destroyed Earth. The holocaust is almost skipped over; and in the end powerful aliens undo it, so that all is as if it had never occurred.\n\n___. The Forge of God. New York: Tor, 1987.\n\nAlien robotic invaders destroy the Earth, partly by using thousands of thermonuclear bombs to split the planet’s crust. Nuclear weapons used by humans against the invaders have little effect.\n\nBeauSeigneur, James. Birth of an Age (The Christ Clone Trilogy, Book Two). New York: Warner Books, 2003.This second volume of a Christian apocalyptic fantasy trilogy begins by repeating the account of the Indian-Pakistani one-day nuclear war depicted at the end of the first volume.\n\n___. In His Image (The Christ Clone Trilogy, Book One). New York: Warner Books, 2003.At the end of the first volume of this Christian apocalyptic fantasy series, an attempt by Russia to launch an all-out strike against Israel and most of the rest of the Middle East is miraculously foiled—the missiles detonate over Russia instead. The explosions are vividly described. “The death toll in the first fifteen seconds alone was over thirty million” (p. 214). In the book’s last chapter, Pakistan launches a nuclear strike against New Delhi, which retailiates by essentially obliterating Pakistan. Over 420 million die.\n\nBecker, Stephen. “The New Encyclopaedist” (Fantasy and Science Fiction, May 1964). In Judith Merril, ed. I0th Annual Edition: The Year’s Best S-F. New York: Delacorte, 1965. New York: Dell, 1966. Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1966. London: Mayflower 1967.A sketch in the form of three biographical entries. The first–and the only one to deal with nuclear war–tells of how a group of protesters called “the Irreconcilables” refused to enter fallout shelters during the First Great Alert of 1973, and enjoyed life aboveground while the war scare passed. During the Second Great Alert of 1977, the rest of the population refused to go below, but the Irreconcilables did so and led a life of luxury underground while the world above was devastated. “From these groups sprang our present highly literate, healthy and peaceable world population of 12,000,000, including only three psychiatrists and no soldiers.” A wave of puritanism is ended by the Great Holocaust “during a Senate debate on the appropriation for anti-missile missiles.”\n\nBell, Neal. Gone to Be Snakes Now. New York: Popular Library, 1974.In a degraded postholocaust community, a rebellious young boy flees the tyranny of his elders and the cruelty of a mutant monster to seek out the mysterious Technologists who drop supplies from time to time. He encounters the mad Dr. Strontium and his half-snake assistant and learns a good deal about nuclear war and the effects of fallout. He fails in his quest for the Technologists, finding only a pitiful handful of elderly refugees instead. Cancer is depicted as commonplace and dealt with at length.\n\nBellany, fan. “Doomsday.” See under Bidwell, Shelford, et al.\n\nBelove, B[enjamin].
