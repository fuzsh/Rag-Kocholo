        "text": "Landscape from a Dream (1936–38) by Paul Nash.\n\n• “I was telling a close friend recently, ‘at my funeral, please play this record…’” Yu Su on her love of Laurie Anderson’s second album, Mister Heartbreak.\n\n• “Surrealism is more of an attitude than an art movement,” says Mark Polizzotti, talking about his new book, Why Surrealism Matters.\n\n• New music: Spinning by Julia Holter; The Night Dwells In The Day by Jozef Van Wissem; and The River Of Light And Radiation by Ben Frost.\n\n• The late David J. Skal, author of Hollywood Gothic and others, is remembered at Swan River Press.\n\n• At Colossal: Dizzying gifs by Etienne Jacob infuse mathematical equations into endless loops.\n\n• At Public Domain Review: Charles Rabot’s Arctic photographs (ca. 1881).\n\n• At Unquiet Things, S. Elizabeth says “Help me downsize my library!”\n\n• Drone footage of the recent volcanic eruption in Iceland.\n\n• Mix of the week is a mix for The Wire by Kavari.\n\n• At Dennis Cooper’s: Robert Bresson Day.\n\n• Dance On A Volcano (1975) by Genesis | Volcano Diving (1989) by David Van Tieghem | Eye Of The Volcano (2006) by Stereolab\n\nFire, Red and Gold (1990) by Eyvind Earle.\n\n• Roger Penrose won a Nobel Prize recently for his work in physics. I read one of his books a few years ago, and was intimidated by the “simple” equations, but I always like to hear his ideas. This 2017 article by Philip Ball is an illuminating overview of Penrose’s life and work.\n\n• At Dangerous Minds: Joe Banks on the incidents that led to Lemmy’s dismissal from Hawkwind in 1975, an extract from Hawkwind: Days of the Underground. The book is available from Strange Attractor in Europe and via MIT Press in the USA.\n\n• “Not married but willing to be!”: men in love (with each other) from the 1850s on. It’s always advisable to take photos like these with a pinch of salt but several of the examples are unavoidably what they appear to be.\n\nMost of all, this resolutely collaborative production stood against the vanity and careerism of individual authorship; Breton called it the first attempt to “adapt a moral attitude, and the only one possible, to a writing process.” The text itself is peppered with readymade phrases, advertising slogans, twisted proverbs, and pastiches of such admired predecessors as Rimbaud, Apollinaire, and Lautréamont, whose pluralistic credo, “Poetry must be made by all. Not by one,” anticipates the sampling aesthetic by a century. But the intensity was draining, and as the book moves toward its final pages and the writing becomes increasingly frenetic, you can almost feel the burnout taking hold. After eight days, fearing for his and Soupault’s sanity, Breton terminated the experiment.\n\nMark Polizzotti reviews a new translation by Charlotte Mandell of The Magnetic Fields by André Breton and Philippe Soupault\n\n• The hide that binds: Mike Jay reviews Dark Archives: A Librarian’s Investigation into the Science and History of Books Bound in Human Skin by Megan Rosenbloom.\n\n• “A photographer ventures deeper into Chernobyl than any before him.” Pictures from Chernobyl: A Stalker’s Guide by Darmon Richter.\n\n• John Van Stan’s reading of Frankenstein by Mary Shelley uses my illustrations (with my permission) for each of its chapters.\n\n• Susan Jamison, one of the artists in The Art of the Occult by S. Elizabeth, talks to the latter about her work.\n\n• William Hope Hodgson: The Secret Index. A collection of Hodgson-related posts at Greydogtales.\n\n• Gee Vaucher talks to Savage Pencil about her cover art for anarchist punk band, Crass.\n\n• Weird, wacky and utterly wonderful: the world’s greatest unsung museums.\n\n• Tom Cardamone chooses the best books about Oscar Wilde.\n\n• At Dennis Cooper’s: Jean-Pierre Melville Day.\n\n• You by The Bug ft. Dis Fig.\n\n• Magnetic Dwarf Reptile (1978) by Chrome | Magnetic Fields, Part 1 (1981) by Jean-Michel Jarre | Magnetic North (1998) by Skyray\n\nA drawing from Bestiario Moderno by Domenico Gnoli (1933–1970).\n\nRIP Russell Hoban. Nina Allan celebrates a favourite writer while David Mitchell, writing in 2005, pays tribute to Riddley Walker. For me the gulf between Hoban and many of his contemporaries could be measured by his entry in the Writer’s Rooms feature the Guardian Review was running for a couple of years: Hoban’s room was the only one that admitted to being cramped and chaotic.\n\nA wristwatch could be “a tiny flowering hell, a wreath of roses, a dungeon of air” and still tell time. A short story could take the shape of an instruction manual for the most routine of tasks (crying, singing, winding said dungeon, killing ants in Rome), or a compendium of tales about fantastical but oddly familiar species. A novel didn’t have to progress from the first page to the last, hung on a rigid skeleton of plot: it could proceed in oblong leaps and great steps backward, like a game, say, of hopscotch. “Literature is a form of play,” said Cortázar. […] It is perhaps because he so stubbornly resists categorization, as much as for the ludic complexity of his work, that Cortázar is in these parts more admired than he is read. The Anglophone literary imagination (or perhaps just its material substrate: the market) appears to have room for only one Latin American giant per generation—Borges, García Márquez, the freshly beatified San Bolaño. Cortázar was too weird, too difficult, too joyously slippery to make the cut.\n\nEels Über Alles: Ben Ehrenreich on Julio Cortázar\n\n• Alfred Jarry is another writer the Anglophone world has often found “too weird, too difficult”. Jarry has been dead for over a century but Alastair Brotchie’s recently-published full-length biography is the first such work in English. Mark Polizzotti reviews a life of “the poster boy for literary cult figures” at Bookforum.\n\n• “A Beautiful Trip”: Frances Morgan interviews David Lynch about music and sound. And Robert Wyatt talks for 95 minutes to Tony Herrington about his favourite music.\n\n• Twilight Science: Paul Schütze presents solo musical work and various collaborative projects in new digital editions.\n\nJonathan Barnbrook‘s logo design for Occupy London.\n\n• Winter reads: Myths of the Norsemen by Roger Lancelyn Green. Related: What became of illustrations in fiction?\n\n• The White People and Other Weird Stories by Arthur Machen is a new Penguin Classic out in January.\n\n• “This Christmas, why not give Viriconium, city of sex, syphillis & consubstantiation?”\n\n• The Casual Optimist announces its Favourite Book Covers of 2011.\n\n• The Collect Call of Cthulhu\n\n• Living with Burroughs\n\n• Function (2011) by Emptyset | Aftertime (2011) by Roly Porter with Cynthia Miller on the Ondes Martenot."
