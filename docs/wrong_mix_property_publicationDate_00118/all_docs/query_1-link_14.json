I am only the person who doesn’t like Ali Smith. I mean, this was fine but, eh.\n\nOvid’s Metamorphoses – Genevieve Lively. This is readings of the complete work, which was really interesting and did help me a lot in understanding the structure of Met. as well.\n\nA Room Full of Bones – Elly Griffiths (audio). I’m slowly working my way through the Ruth Galloway series, so great to discover that I like them on audio as well. Gotta say, the supernatural elements of this one have me raising a quizzical eyebrow (Cathbad venturing into the Dreaming to save Nelson, who’s been cursed and is in a coma that is baffling the medical profession), but hey, at least the drug smuggling, horse training plot is ok.\n\nDying Fall – Elly Griffiths (audio).\n\nThe Outcast Dead – Elly Griffiths (audio).\n\nBrilliance – Markus Sakey\n\nThe Ghost Fields – Elly Griffiths (audio).\n\nThe Woman in Blue – Elly Griffiths (audio).\n\nA Darker Shade of Magic – V.E.

Because it turns out I didn’t want to read anything on my TBR pile, I wanted to read about Modesty Blaise instead\n\nReal Tigers – Mick Herron. These are all fab.\n\nAmy & Isabelle – Elizabeth Strout.\n\nSnow Blind – Ragnar Jonasson. For me, this suffered from being a first novel and in translation. It was good but a bit thin.\n\nAmerican Housewife – Helen Ellis.\n\nDaughter of the Wolf – Victoria Whitworth.\n\nWatch Her Disappear – Eva Dolan.\n\nA Dance to the Music of Time (vol 1) – Anthony Powell (audio).\n\nHaunted Castles – Ray Russell. A lovely collection of Gothic tales, how had I never heard of him before?\n\nThe Last Voice You Hear – Mick Herron (audio). Second in the Oxford series and I’m thoroughly enjoying it. There’s always the nice Oxfordness, of course (namecheck of Borders! I liked that Borders), and Zoe is an indomitable character.\n\nGiving up the Ghost – Hilary Mantel. In a lovely, pale yellow, clothbound Slightly Foxed edition that is the perfect size for one’s hand. I feel, when reading it, that I should be on a steam train somewhere in the 40s, possibly at risk of getting a smut in my eye.\n\nAll Passion Spent – Vita Sackville-West.\n\nThus Was Adonis Murdered – Sarah Caudwell.\n\nTinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy – John Le Carre.\n\nThe Smell of Summer Grass – Adam Nicolson.\n\nLittle Men – Louisa May Alcott.\n\nThe Wrong Knickers – Bryony. In all honesty, I went to London and forgot to take a book and this was what I could find in Smith’s at Marylebone for the return journey.\n\nDiamond Star Halo – Tiffany Murray. I didn’t even know she’d written more than Sugar Hall. Loved the characters and the prose of this but actually would have liked more of it, as a great big sprawling family saga.\n\nResistance – Owen Sheers. I heard the movie being discussed on Front Row years ago, but never saw it playing anywhere. Not a huge fan of counter-factual stuff but the small scale of this sounds interesting. And it was, although tending inevitably to tragedy.\n\nHarriet – Jilly Cooper. I don’t even remember when I last romped through all these quick romances. This was a junk food snack.\n\nDaughter of the Empire – Raymond E. Feist and Janny Wurts – Much as above. Surprised by how much I remember as I went along. Don’t need to read the rest of the trilogy.\n\nNight Waking – Sarah Moss.\n\nThe Bird Tribunal – Agnes Ravatn. Lordy.\n\nMothering Sunday – Graham Swift.\n\nSt Clare’s – Enid Blyton. Picked up a three vols in one and had a happy hour or so on Sunday afternoon revisiting my youth. Remembered very little of it, I always preferred Malory Towers.\n\nSummertime, All the Cats Are Bored – Philippe Georget. A grand thing about a day out on your own is all the reading time you get as well as being out. Consequently, I read on the train, over lunch, during the interval at the theatre so there were only a handful of a pages to get through when I got home. Loved this, character driven police procedural.\n\nMadame Solario – Gladys Huntington. This is dragging for me, so I’m going to have to blitz it to get through it.\n\nGood Clean Fight – Derek Robinson.\n\nSkating to Antarctica – Jenny Diski.\n\nSpook Street – Mick Herron. Another outing for Jackson Lamb, another day survived for the Slow Horses. Well, most of them. I’m glad to see Catherine Standish back.\n\nAnd the Rest Is History – Jodi Taylor (audio). There are times when all the driving that my job brings with it is a good thing, and those times are mostly when there’s a good audiobook to be listened to.\n\nThe Dry – Jane Harper (audio).\n\nA Dance to the Music of Time, 2nd movement – Anthony Powell. I listened to vol 1 again on audio and fell straight back under the spell, so I shall work my way through the rest.\n\nThe Gone-Away World – Nick Harkaway.\n\nA Dance to the Music of Time, 3rd movement – Anthony Powell. On audio.\n\nEvery Dead Thing – John Connolly. My first foray into the Charlie Parker novels, and I liked it but it didn’t quite live up to expectations.\n\nDie Trying – Lee Child. My second foray into Jack Reacher novels, and I’m firmly hooked on these.\n\nThe Water Rat of Wanchai – Ian Hamilton. Which I had to import from Amazon US, which means that these are going to be tiresomely tricky to get hold of. I liked it, Ava Lee is actually a nasty piece of work, accomplished and ruthless.\n\nThe Girls – Emma Cline. This one did live up to the hype, perfectly encapsulating that teenage need to be seen, and the blind gratitude that can go along with that.\n\nThe Stopped Heart – Julie Myerson. God, it took me weeks to read this. It was the sense of impending tragedy that did it, which must mean the author was successful in building up the suspense. I just didn’t want to know what happened, so I resisted the book. So then that meant that I read it in a really disjointed way, so it never came alive for me. Effectively I read it doing there reading equivalent of sticking my fingers in ears and singing ‘La la la, I can’t hear you’.\n\nFull Dark House – Christopher Fowler (audio). The first in the Bryant & May series, and the last for me. I did like the idea that it started at the end, with one of the now elderly detectives investigating the presumed death of t’other one (I’m afraid I couldn’t remember which was which). Meanwhile, it also replayed their first case together, with the two stories intertwining. But blimey, there were some real pacing issues, at least to my ears. Bloody great long bits that went nowhere at all. Plus there were some really obvious overlooked clues (the door that’s always locked and yet you’ve got a mysterious character prowling around the theatre, oh give me a break). And Fowler did that thing when, in order to avoid too much repetition of a character’s name, he used a noun instead. So, ‘the chorine’ or ‘the tycoon’. I hate that. Yeah. No.\n\nThe Clocks in This House all Tell Different Times – Xan Brooks.\n\nA Dance to the Music of Time, vol 4 – Anthony Powell.\n\nHeliopolis – James Scudamore.\n\nAutumn, All the Cats Return – Philippe Georget.\n\nBoy A – Jonathan Trigell.\n\nCrisis – Frank Gardner. I was on holiday and ran out of books and had to read the boyfriend’s.\n\nBetrayal – Will Jordan. As above.\n\nThe Power – Naomi Alderman (audio).\n\nTripwire – Lee Child.\n\nThe Shepherd’s Crown – Terry Pratchett.\n\nWho Killed Sherlock Holmes? – Paul Cornell.\n\nFreya – Anthony Quinn.\n\nA Way through the Woods – Nigel Balchin.\n\nMaplecroft – Cherie Priest.\n\nDarkness Falls from the Air – Nigel Balchin.\n\nRather Be the Devil – Ian Rankin. I’m enjoying Malcolm Fox’s gradual falls from grace the more time he spends with Rebus. Also, oddly glad to see Big Ger out of retirement.\n\nShelter – Sarah Franklin.\n\nThe Widow’s Confession – Sophia Tobin (audio).\n\nThe Crimes of Winter – Philippe Georget.\n\nThe Land of the Green Man – Caroline Larrington.\n\nThe Letter of Marque – Patrick O’Brian.\n\nA Presumption of Death – Jill Paton Walsh (audio). A faux Peter and Harriet book, and tempting thought it is to want their story to continue, Walsh is not Sayers and knows it. This was tethered to previous characters, notably from Busman’s Honeymoon but it was still only a faint echo of the real thing.\n\nA Woman Looking at Men Looking at Women – Siri Hustvedt. I’ve read a couple of her novels but hadn’t realised she was also a lecturer in psychiatry. The introduction to the book is intimidating enough, so I’m thinking I’ll be dipping in and out of this one.\n\nThe Thirteen Gun Salute – Patrick O’Brian.\n\nThe Nutmeg of Consolation – Patrick O’Brian.\n\nThe Children of Cherry Tree Farm – Enid Blyton.\n\nThe Curious Affair of the Somnambulist and the Psychic Thief – Lisa Tuttle.\n\nClarissa Oakes – Patrick O’Brian.\n\nThe Commodore – Patrick O’Brian.\n\nSeven Days of Us – Francesca Hornak.\n\nThe Hundred Days – Patrick O’Brian.\n\nThe Gunslinger – Steven King. Meh. First vol in the 7-book Dark Tower series, which I was pretty excited about. But, I had to force myself through this like I was doing homework. So nope.\n\nThe Tidal Zone – Sarah Moss.\n\nThe Cuckoo’s Calling – Robert Galbraith. Well, I watched the first episode on TV and thought re-reading it would be quicker. But I may watch the rest as well, if I remember.\n\nThe Silkworm – Robert Galbraith. Inevitable, after the above.\n\nUprooted – Naomi Novak.\n\nLove and be Wise – Josephine Tey. How came an unread Tey to be hiding on the bookshelves?\n\nSylvester – Georgette Heyer (audio). Which I liked much better this time around although somewhat disconcerted at first when I realised the narrator was Adam from The Archers.\n\nWhy We Die – Mick Herron (audio). The penultimate Zoe Boehm story and I like her very much.\n\nThe Long and the Short of It – Jodi Taylor (audio). Hurrah, the St Mary’s short stories all collected in one volume.\n\nThe Disciples of Las Vegas – Ian Hamilton. The second in the Ava Lee series, and really, she’s getting tougher. Not sure I like Ava, but she is ruthlessly effective at getting information out of people. I didn’t really think she’d start cutting off fingers…\n\nThe Visitor – Lee Child. My birthday read, on the train, over brunch, over a sneaky mid afternoon glass of champagne.\n\nEcho Burning – Lee Child. Because one dose of Jack Reacher isn’t enough… Not my favourite but still unputdownable.\n\nWhisky from Small Glasses – Denzil Meyrick. The first DCI Daley book, and probably the last for me. I found it perfectly competent but there’s nothing new here.\n\nThe Last Act of Hattie Hoffman – Mindy Mejia. A somewhat desperate airport buy that turned out to be a surprisingly good read. I’ve got more of a soft spot for the buried secrets of small American towns than small Scottish ones, it seems.\n\nSmoke and Whispers – Mick Herron. The last Zoe Boehm novel and it’s not a spoiler to say that I don’t know if she’s dead or not. The book starts with a body in the Tyne that is near enough in appearance and wearing Zoe’s clothes, with Zoe’s belongings. But, Zoe’s old friend Sarah starts digging… I’m mid way through and I can’t call it.\n\nThe Found and the Lost: The Collected Novellas of Ursula K Leguin – Ursula K LeGuin.\n\nTales from Earthsea – Ursula LeGuin.\n\nThe White Silence – Jodi Taylor (audio). Oh, sigh. I really wanted to like this and it started off as promising. But. It was a mess. I get that Elizabeth Cage is on a journey of self-discovery, but did she have to be such a pathetic character to start with? And then there was a whole chunk of dream sequence following a bang on the head. Twists within twists, fine but the ole’ Dallas approach? Sigh again.\n\nThe Party – Elizabeth Day (audio). Oh I do love an unreliable narrator, and this novel had one, plus his wife whose own story acted as a bit of a corrective.\n\nWithout Fail – Lee Child.\n\nSwing Time – Zadie Smith.\n\nHouse of Birds – Morgan McCarthy.\n\nElectric Dreams – Philip K Dick.\n\nDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? – Philip K Dick. Well, with a new Bladerunner movie coming out, what was I supposed to do?\n\nSirens – Joseph Knox (audio).\n\nCrazy, Rich Asians – Kevin Kwan. Birthday present from Marcy, nice, fun read for a wet Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe Way of Kings – Brandon Sanderson. Borrowed it from a colleague at work and while it’s been a bit slow going, now I have to read the rest of the trilogy.\n\nWords of Radiance – Brandon Sanderson. Which I romped through and am now waiting for my colleague to catch up, and for vol 3 to come out.\n\nThe Silent Companions – Laura Purcell. Huge, gothic sigh. My pet hate in historical novels is when the characters seems like modern day people dropped in to a rickety historical setting. Before anyone writes a novel in an historical setting, they should read Hilary Mantel. Then, most of them should give up. This could have been creepy enough except that both the narrative and the meta-narrative felt as flat as the boards on which the companions were painted. Great production values for the hb though, it’s a beautiful looking book.\n\nThe Vanishers – Heidi Julavits.\n\nBridge of Birds – Barry Hughart. Oh, how many times have I read this? I gave my copy to a charity shop years ago, and had to buy a second hand edition as a replacement. I almost expected to see my own name in the front of it. A satisfying Chinese fairy tale.\n\nOathbringer – Brandon Sanderson. So that wrapped up that trilogy, not exactly neatly. Felt like one took a long time to get going, and also that a load of minor characters introduced in the first couple of volumes then also had to be shoehorned into the grand finale. Still, all jolly entertaining stuff.\n\nWinter Warriors – David Gemell. Unaccountably, this was my first Gemell and lent to me by a colleague (who also introduced me to Sanderson). I had a timely return train trip to Cardiff, which allowed me the perfect amount of reading time. Liked this, it is just me who appreciates it when not every one of the plucky band of unlikely heroes survives?\n\nSister – Rosamund Lupton (audio). A nicely done thriller, with Beatrice called home from the US because her younger sister, Tess, is missing. Tess is subsequently found to have committed suicide – or was it murder? Well, of course it was, but as the police don’t think so it falls to Beatrice to investigate. There are plenty of red herrings, Beatrice is a potentially unreliable narrator and a good twist at the end. I did get a bit fed up of their amazing sisterly bond, but maybe that’s realistic.\n\nHow to Find Love in a Bookshop – Veronica Henry (audio). Started off promisingly, degenerated to a very weak story. Charming naif inherits bookshop from unworldly father, mean local property developer wants the premises and bribes his handsome-but-weak stooge to somehow seduce her into selling. That sub-plot never gets going but is held in the wings until needed. Meanwhile, various local inhabitants find love via some vague connection with the bookshop. Eyeroll,\n\nThe Tollgate – Georgette Heyer (audio). Ages since I read this one and it’s not her strongest but setting that aside, it does have some great characters and pleasingly cold blooded solution to the problem of the dodgy ones.\n\nThe Collected Memoirs – Julian MacLaren-Ross. Who was the model for X Trapnel and apparently did indeed always carry a cane. Great, engaging stuff, about his unconventional boyhood, early years trying to write, time in the army and life in Soho. 40s and 50s London always sounds glamorously seedy, suspect it was just plain seedy. Some of the army stuff reminds me of both Greene and Powell, possibly unsurprising since he was definitely a fan of Greene.\n\nFlaneuse – Lauren Elkin\n\nWomen & Power – Mary Beard. Well, obviously. And yes, the ways that women are silenced and have been date back to the Romans and beyond absolutely stacks up for me. Hard for it not to when simply by being a woman you get to live the experience.\n\nDifferent Class – Joanne Harris. I had no idea she wrote ‘literary psychological thrillers’ but there you go. I found that the character of Straitley undercut the thriller bit somewhat, but I’m always disturbed by characters who like killing animals and particularly so when you get their narration. The twist was a bit meh but this was fine.\n\nThe Dark is Rising – Susan Cooper.\n\nHouse of Cards – Michael Hobbs.\n\nThe Chronicles of Chrestomanci – Diane Wynne Jones.\n\nThe Chronicles of Chrestomanci vol 2 – Diane Wynne Jones.\n\nThe Shepherd’s Crown – Terry Pratchett.\n\n2016\n\nEarly Warning – Jane Smiley.\n\nSlade House – David Mitchell. Better than Bone Clocks.\n\nThe French Lieutenant’s Woman – John Fowles.\n\nThe Loney – Andrew Michael Hurley.\n\nThe Ministry of Fear – Graham Greene.\n\nThe Children Act – Ian McEwan.\n\nTroubles – J. G. Farrell. I didn’t realize this was the first volume in the Empire trilogy. I read The Siege of Krishnapur (vol 2) years ago, and I can see the relationship between them, in tracking the ending of an era and the head in the sand blindness to reality of some of the representatives of Empire. Troubles has the same dark, deadpan humor I remember, without quite the same level of tragedy.\n\nLove All – Elizabeth Jane Howard. I think Picador are doing the author a disservice by blurbing her books as though they’re chicklit. I raced through this, which was a pleasingly complex and beautifully written discourse on love, family relationships and sacrifice.\n\nTell No Tales – Eva Dolan. Bought this in pb, entirely forgetting that at some point last year I bought and read the hb. I must have lent it to someone. As soon as I started reading, I knew it was familiar, but a good set up to go into vol 3!\n\nVenetia – Georgette Heyer. Comfort reading.\n\nDevil’s Cub – Georgette Heyer. Ditto.\n\nOver Sea, under Stone – Susan Cooper. Ditto.\n\nAfter you Die – Eva Dolan. Third in the Zigic and Ferreira series and I think it’s my favourite so far. Good to see the Hate Crimes Unit dealing with something other than racially motivated attacks, and also to see them broadening their area of operations to a more rural spot.\n\nPost Captain – Patrick O’Brian. Took a day off and visited old ships at Portsmouth; I hadn’t read Aubrey/Maturin when I visited before, so I immediately headed back to the series. And once you’ve started, it’s hard to stop…\n\nHMS Surprise – Patrick O’Brian.\n\nThe Mauritius Command – Patrick O’Brian.\n\nDisclaimer – Renee Knight. Ok, I didn’t so much read this as force my way through the first 57 pages and then give up in total despair. It is so, so bad.\n\nCurtain Call – Anthony Quinn.\n\nThe Sword of Shannara – Terry Brooks. Because the way trailers work for me is: ‘Oh, I think that’s based on a book’. Watches trailer. ‘That looks good, I think I’ll read that.’\n\nAmerican Gods – Neil Gaiman.\n\nJust Between Us – Um, don’t remember the author. Just bought it to read on the ‘plane and forgotten it already.\n\nThe Lie Tree – Frances Hardinge. Wow, was this disappointing. I just never bought into it, and I always struggle with literature set in an historical period that then has characters who seem totally out of place.\n\nFront Lines – Michael Grant. Loved this counter-factual history that assumed women got to fight in WWII. Looking forward to the rest of the trilogy.\n\nThe Long Life – Elizabeth Howard. Howard never disappoints and I particularly liked the structure of this, as each section went further back in time throughout the heroine’s life. It’s a painful story of a painful marriage, but lays bare the realities of women’s choice, and lack of choice, at the time.\n\nA Sort of Life – Graham Greene. My Blackwell’s book of the month, and a nice bit of biography. Very surprising to me that Greene wasn’t successful – I’d always assumed his place in the canon had been contempory with his writing career, but not at all.\n\nReady Player One – Ernest Cline. Fun read about a dystopian future where everyone spends most of their time in the OASIS, a virtual paradise that’s an escape from everyday life. A teen hero has to track the clues to win ownership of OASIS after the creator’s death, and save it from the evil corporate that wants to take it over. Lots of 80s references and heavily gaming influenced but I’m interested to see what’s made of it in film.\n\nThe Woman in Cabin 10 – Ruth Ware. This is the second novel from this author that I’ve read, and I’ve been lucky enough to score both in ARC copies. I thought this was better. It had the hallmarks of a classic whodunnit, set on a cruise ship with a limited cast of characters. Throw in a narrator who may or may not be unreliable and I stayed up until I’d finished it. I had my suspicions, but there was a suitable tense ending. I can see the film already…\n\nCatullus’ Bedspread: The Life of Rome’s Most Erotic Poet – Daisy Dunn. The author was speaking as part of the Oxford Literary Festival, so I went along and was very pleased to dip a toe back into classical waters. I quite liked the book but I did feel that the author had let her theory run away with her, and some of the translations of the poems feel a bit clunky. Still, it was good to read more about Catullus as a person than I have before, and it was good to have a reminder of what exciting times he lived in. It may be time to revisit Syme.\n\nDune – Frank Herbert. I first read this when I was in my mid teens and I’m interested to see if it stands the test of time. I was also shocked to find out how early it was written: 1968, predating not only Neuromancer, but Star Wars!\n\nJust One Damned Thing after Another – Jodi Taylor. Audiobook. I don’t even remember how I stumbled across this series, it might have been an Audible recommendation. As can be seen from the list below, I’m hooked.\n\nA Symphony of Echoes – Jodi Taylor. Audiobook.\n\nA Second Chance – Jodi Taylor. Audiobook.\n\nA Trail through Time – Jodi Taylor. Audiobook.\n\nNo Time Like the Present – Jodi Taylor. Audiobook.\n\nThe Woman Who Ran – Sam Baker.\n\nGolden Age – Jane Smiley.\n\nWhat Could Possibly Go Wrong? – Jodi Taylor. Audiobook.\n\nFoundation – Isaac Asimov.\n\nTreasure Island – R.L. Stevenson.\n\nThe Nether World – George Gissing.\n\nLies, Damned Lies and History – Jodi Taylor. Audiobook.\n\nThe Penguin Book of Short Stories – Philip Hensher (ed.). Dipping in and out of this.\n\nThe Ocean at the End of the Lane – Neil Gaiman. Just like first time round, heartbreaking.\n\nThe Hive – Gill Hornby\n\nGods Behaving Badly – Marie Philips.\n\nLondon Falling – Paul Cornell.\n\nGreengates – RC Sheriff.\n\nThe Janus Stone – Elly Griffiths.\n\nBecause of the Lockwoods – Dorothy Whipple.\n\nThe Severed Streets – Paul Cornell.\n\nThe House at Sea’s End – Elly Griffiths.\n\nSwan Song – Edmund Crispin.\n\nThe Virgin in the Garden – AS Byatt.\n\nStill Life – AS Byatt.\n\nLightning Rods – Helen Dewitt.\n\nThe Woman Upstairs – Claire Messud.\n\nThe Wolf Border – Sarah Hall.\n\nUprooted – Nina Lyon.\n\nInglorious -Joanna Kavenna.\n\nThe Shepherd’s Crown – Terry Pratchett.\n\nThe Past – Tessa Hadley.\n\nThree Wishes – Liane Moriarty.\n\nBabel Tower – AS Byatt.\n\nI See You – Clare Mackintosh.\n\nThe Camomile Lawn – Mary Wesley.\n\nThe Whistling Woman – AS Byatt.\n\nRagnarok – AS Byatt.\n\nA Field Guide to Getting Lost– Rebecca Solnit.\n\nMen Explain Things to Me – Rebecca Solnit. The title essay of which should be required reading for everyone. Because, seriously, is there a woman alive who has not experienced that?\n\nEven Dogs in the Wild – Ian Rankin.\n\nMagician – Raymond E Feist. I thought I’d just read the first one again. Nope.\n\nSilverthorn – Raymond E Feist.\n\nA Darkness at Sethanon – Raymond E Feist.\n\nThe Good Liar – Nicholas Searle.\n\nDid You Ever Have a Family? Bill Clegg.\n\nLabyrinth – Kate Mosse.\n\nScruples – Judith Krantz. Because I had a sudden urge to re-read it and a friend found it for me for my birthday. Trashtastic.\n\nHope in the Dark – Rebecca Solnit.\n\nThe Magus – John Fowles.\n\nSharpe’s Tiger – Bernard Cornwell.\n\nThe Secret of Nightingale Wood – Lucy Strange.\n\nThe Philosophy of Law: Very Short Introduction\n\nThe Trespassers – Tana French.\n\nThe Outrun – Amy Liptrott.\n\nThe Girl with all the Gifts – M.R. Carey\n\nThe Coffin Trail – Martin Edwards.\n\nThe Grown Up – Gillian Flynn.\n\nA Kestrel for a Knave – Barry Hines.\n\nBorn to Run – Bruce Springsteen.\n\nDown Cemetery Road – Mick Herron.\n\nMoskva – Jack Grimwood.\n\nThe Hanging Tree – Ben Abraamovitch.\n\nThe Blood Card – Elly Griffiths (audio).\n\nMissing, Presumed – Susie Steiner (audio).\n\nThe Rule of Law – Tom Bingham.\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone – J.K. Rowling (audio).\n\nThe Summer before the War – Helen Simmons (audio).\n\nReaper Man – Terry Pratchett.\n\nSlow Horses – Mick Herron.\n\nDead Lions – Mick Herron.\n\nHolding – Graham Norton (audio).\n\nGoodwood – Holly Thursday (audio).\n\nThe Dark is Rising – Susan Cooper. Traditional Christmas read.\n\nGreenwitch – Susan Cooper.\n\nHarry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone – J.K. Rowling.\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets – J.K Rowling.\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban – J.K. Rowling.\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire – J.K. Rowling.\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix – J.K. Rowling.\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince – J.K. Rowling.\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – J.K. Rowling.\n\nThe Crystal Singer – Anne McCaffrey.\n\nKillashandra – Anne McCaffrey.\n\nCrystal Line – Anne McCaffrey.\n\n2015\n\nPatience – John Coates. This was a lovely, gentle re-read to ease me back into actually using my brain. Along with Maureen Lipman, who wrote the introduction, I am hopeful that Persephone will bring more of Coates’ work back into print.\n\nThe Old Wives’ Tale – Arnold Bennett. Well, this was a treat. It’s the story of Constance and Sophia, two young girls in the C19th who, on the face of it, have very different lives. Constance stays at home, marries the assistant and inherits the family shop, never leaving her home town. Sophia runs away with a wastrel seducer, and lives her life in Paris until she’s reunited with her sister. The novel deals with their histories independently until they’re back together in old age. It’s small lives, rich in detail.\n\nMrs Hemingway – Naomi Wood. Enjoyed this very much, and I could care less about Hemingway. It has a section from the perspective of each of his wives, and EH himself doesn’t come out of it particularly well.\n\nTristram Shandy – Laurence Sterne.\n\nSkylight – David Hare. Quick scamper through the text after enjoying the play so much. I can still hear Bill Nighy saying his lines.\n\nStation Eleven – Emily St John Mandel. Which was great, if rather distressingly believable and did make me wonder if a survival skills course would be a good idea? I liked the way the before the ‘flu and after the ‘flu stories joined together.\n\nLife after Life – Kate Atkinson. I’d heard and read so many good things about this book and yet I was quite resistant to the concept of it. And then it turned up as my January book from Blackwell’s and I read it in a day, most of that a single sitting. I did think it was great, although I did get a bit bored with the war chapters. But the concept was fascinating, and I liked the changes wrought on Ursula as her lives began to clash.\n\nSlowly down the Ganges – Eric Newby. I’m dipping into this and enjoying it so far, but appear to be reading it at the same pace as he travelled the river. Update: I gave up about 50pp from the end because it was all getting a bit samey. Newby isn’t for me. He comes across as mostly just grumpy and dissatisfied with everything (fair enough, under the circumstance, India sounds horrible) but then, don’t go on trips like it.\n\nA God in Ruins – Kate Atkinson. See review.\n\nWilkie Collins – Peter Ackroyd. Delightful, although slight autobiography. Got to admire a man who kept two mistresses\n\nHens Dancing – Rafaelle Barker. The first in a run of quick re-reads while I was tired and trying to decide what to read next.\n\nStrong Poison – D L Sayers.\n\nThe Grand Sophy – Georgette Heyer.\n\nFrederica – Georgette Heyer.\n\nNumber 9 Dreams – David Mitchell.\n\nUnnatural Death – Dorothy L Sayers\n\nThe Unfinished Clue – Georgette Heyer.\n\nThe Guermantes Way – Marcel Proust.\n\nThe Beast Must Die – Nicholas Blake.\n\nA Little Princess – Frances Hodgson Burnett.\n\nThe Shiralee – D’Arcy Niland. Put back into print by Fox, Finch & Tepper, the new imprint launched by Mr B’s Emporium in Bath, and a fine job they’ve made of it. The shiralee (burden) of the title is a 4 year old girl, whose father took her away from her adulterous mother, more with the intent of punishing the mother than out of any love for his daughter. Now she walks with him from town to town, as he sees it getting in his way and slowing him down. He’s tough on her, forcing her to keep walking when she can barely stand; and yet, despite himself, he begins to admire the way she does keep up with him. Her absolute dependence on him and faith in him gradually win him over. It’s an unsentimental story, very redolent of place and time, with a genuinely tense ending.\n\nThe Silver Bough – Lisa Tuttle. Small Scottish town of Appleton, which has an odd historical past with strong themes of folklore and magic running through, reaches some point of crisis due to the return of Ronan Wall to his home town. Ronan was supposed to marry Euphemia about 50 years ago, when she was crowned Apple Queen, and they should have shared the magical apple in a ritual that would have tied them together and secured the town’s ongoing prosperity and happiness. They didn’t, both left the town and it’s been downhill ever since – the apple orchards on which the town’s success were founded withered and were eventually dug up. But now Ronan is back, trying to mend old wrongs; Ashley, Euphemia’s American grand daughter has arrived in town; and there are a couple of other ‘incomer’ women, also likely candidates for latest Apple Queen. I kind of liked this but it felt a bit lightweight and predictable. I didn’t really feel the dread and menace that the town’s drifting into a magical realm was meant to evoke, probably because there was never any doubt that the resolution would be positive.\n\nThe Ship – Antonia Honeywell.\n\nDuring the Reign of the Queen of Persia – Joan Chase. A matriarchal clan in Ohio in the 50s, consisting primarily of a mother, her daughters and their daughters, seen through the eyes of the four youngest members of the family. It’s told in the first person plural and the collective ‘we’ voice doesn’t fragment even when describing the actions of individuals within the group. To me this felt as though ‘we’ included the reader but also became something like a Greek chorus observing and commenting. At the heart of it is the illness and death of Aunt Grace, but as a counterpoint, the book is as much an exploration of America’s shift from farming to commercial enterprise as it is a slice of family history.\n\nSome Luck – Jane Smiley. Galloped through this, the first part of Smiley’s proposed trilogy that will cover the last 100 years of American history. I enjoyed it and I really like the episodic structure, but I think the downside is that I feel I’m getting snapshots, rather than really understanding the characters.\n\nThe Paying Guests – Sarah Waters (audio). Which I’m enjoying for the period detail but I’m finding the whining annoying. Update: Ugh, abandoned this with hours left, because the characters were just too stupid to be born.\n\nCarpe Jugulum – Terry Pratchett. Well, it had to be done, and I realised I’ve been out of the Discworld for too long. In this one, Verence invites a family of vampires to his daughter’s christening, and they turn up planning to take over Lancre. Granny Weatherwax has something to say about that.\n\nThinking of You – Jill Mansell. Just a quick Saturday morning re-read.\n\nExcellent Women – Barbara Pym. Re-read.\n\nWhispers Underground – Ben Aaronovitch. Re-read.\n\nBroken Homes – Ben Aaronovitch. Re-read.\n\nFoxglove Summer – Ben Aaronovitch. Re-read. Better second time round, actually.\n\nLady of Quality – Georgette Heyer. Been wanting to read this one again for ages, so finally succumbed and picked it for a lazy Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe Village – Marghanita Laski. Re-read.\n\nThe New House – Lettice Cooper. Re-read.\n\nMiss Pettigrew Lives for a Day – Winifred Watson. Re-read.\n\nThe Husband’s Secret – Liane Moriarty (audio). I don’t know why it is that the blurbs of her books always put me off, because I always enjoy the books themselves. I should start picking them up without bothering to check.\n\nLess than Angels – Barbara Pym.\n\nA Glass of Blessings – Barbara Pym.\n\nNo Fond Return of Love – Barbara Pym.\n\nWitches Abroad – Terry Pratchett.\n\nLords and Ladies – Terry Pratchett.\n\nMaskerade – Terry Pratchett.\n\nIsland Summers: Memories of a Norwegian Childhood – Tilly Culme-Seymour.\n\nAnna of the Five Towns – Arnold Bennett.\n\nAstonish Me – Maggie Shipstead.\n\nThree Strange Angels – Laura Kalpakian.\n\nAnno Dracula – Kim Newman.\n\nA Change for the Better – Susan Hill.\n\nLadies and Gentleman – Susan Hill. Some monstrous characters in both of these books.\n\nTell No Tales – Eva Dolan. This series is building so well.\n\nThe Secret Place – Tana French. I listened to this when it came out but was happy to grab it in pb.\n\nPride and Prejudice – Jane Austen.\n\nThe Talisman Ring – Georgette Heyer.\n\nHow to Build a Girl – Caitlin Moran. A couple of very funny lines, but mostly meh.\n\nA Dark Anatomy – Robin Blake. Had high hopes of this C18th crime duo but just couldn’t get into this and then found the solution entirely unbelievable.\n\nThe Wake – Paul Kingsnorth. Loving this so far. Astonishing achievement and not even having to read it out loud to myself to get my head around the ‘shadow tongue’.\n\nA Song for Issy Bradley – Carys Bray.\n\nDevil’s Cub – Georgette Heyer.\n\nThe Rosie Project – Graeme Simsion.\n\nThese Old Shades – Georgette Heyer (audio).\n\nPrivate Life – Jane Smiley. Found this disappointing, in that it didn’t seem to go anywhere although the historical background was good.\n\nThe Incarnations – Susan Barker. Ditto.\n\nIn a Dark, Dark Wood – Ruth Ware. Really liked this, even though I guessed the murderer and victim fairly early on. It kept me reading to find out how it was going to play out.\n\nThe Bees – Laline Paull. So far, so ok, but I think I need to give it a solid block of reading time. Nope, forced myself through to the end but meh.\n\nStonemouth – Iain Banks. Great stuff, must read more Banks.\n\nThe Third Wife – Lisa Jewell. Bit of a departure from Jewell’s standard chicklit fare (which I regularly acquire and enjoy), with far darker undercurrents. I liked it but I do think the ending was rather trite. Maya, who was the third wife, became more of a plot device than a character and it felt like she deserved more than that.\n\nLife Drawing – Robin Black. Loved this, and the ending was totally unexpectedly chilling.\n\nThe Table of Less Valued Knights – Marie Phillips. Which was ok but not as funny as Gods Behaving Badly.\n\nMirror Sight – Kristen Britain. I’ve abandoned this some not very many pages in. I can’t remember what happened in the previous books and I don’t care.\n\nSo Much for That – Lionel Shriver. When I started this I thought it was going to be good but relentlessly depressing, given that it’s about one woman’s battle with cancer at the expense of her husband’s lifelong dream and roughly $2 million; while his best friend’s life goes very wrong at the same time. In fact, it was oddly uplifting, despite also being a deep dive into the horrors of American healthcare (familiarity with which is one of the reasons I’m so keen on the NHS) and the ultimate unfairness of a system that really does seem to punish the good guys who play by the rules. It was also a close look at a far from perfect marriage that is nevertheless reforged in its final year.\n\nLove and Fallout – Kathryn Simmonds. I picked this up because of the Catherine O’Flynn quote on the cover, and I only read O’Flynn because she was so charming at Stories Aloud. I liked the flipping back and forth from the Greenham Common days to present day, and the clear prose. On the strength of this I’d pick up more by Simmonds if I saw it.\n\nTreasure – Clive Cussler. Oh, Dirk Pitt. If only you were a character, instead of a collection of impossible attributes. Suspension of disbelief is vital to make it through a Dirk Pitt novel. Also, suspension of critical faculties. I’d have been more bothered by the sexism if any of the characters were other than stereotypes, but as the whole thing is an hilarious male fantasy, the women didn’t get treated any worse than the President. Although I’d still like to know: what does ‘she moved with a sensual vivacity’ actually mean?\n\nBodies of Light – Sarah Moss. I keep seeing that she’s an under rated novelist and based on what I’ve read so far, that’s true. This feels as though it’s heading into dark family territory.\n\nThe Good Son – Paul McVeigh. Got this as a Not the Booker recommendation and raced straight through it. Great narrative voice, draws you straight in. Some very funny moments, some tragic moments, all beautifully balanced.\n\nRiders – Jilly Cooper. How long has it been since I first read Riders? I don’t remember but all the furore over the new cover made me nostalgic. It’s more horses and less sex than I remembered and I still wouldn’t go near Rupert Campbell-Black.\n\nStill Midnight – Denise Mina. Bought this in Glasgow, realizing I had no real literary associations for the city and couldn’t recall having read anything set there. I found this disappointing, very slow going, usual unliked DC being misunderstood and shot down at every turn, un-engaging characters and a wholly unlikely romance at the end of it. I had to force myself to finish it when I was only 60pp from the end. But: the writing was good, it was the first in a series, and Mina has great review so I’m minded to suspend final judgment until I’ve tried out another.\n\nThe Big Music – Kirstin Gunn. I’m worried that this might be a bit non-linear and steam of consciousness for me, but I do really want to give it a go. Update: no, abandoned this.\n\nKitchens of the Great Midwest – J Ryan Stradal. Blackwell’s sent me this as a treat, and I loved it.\n\nA Little Life – Hanya Yanagahira. So, this has turned out to be a real Marmite book for people, with Scott Pack getting so annoyed he’s decided he won’t even read reviews by critics who liked this anymore. I’m on the pro side. I can see, and agree with some of the criticism that has been made: it’s overlong (although I love a long novel and am more apt to decry modern authors’ tendency to go short); Jude suffers so much abuse it must be more than is realistic for one person; at least a couple of the four friends are sketched in rather than being rounded characters. It’s not the great American novel. And yet, I was totally gripped when reading it and on a couple of occasions so upset that I had to put the book down and walk away.\n\nWise Children – Angela Carter. An engaging romp of a novel, that I’m still thinking about a few days later. I particularly liked the way Uncle Perry would swoop in, the deus ex machina, and resolve the situation just as tragedy threatened. Dora’s narrative voice was funny and ribald.\n\nThe Cold Dish – Craig Johnson. Apparently this series is the basis of a TV show, which I may even dig out and watch. Cold Dish is the first in the series and I’ll definitely be reading more. Walt Longmire fulfils some of the characteristics of the archetypal detective: when the novel opens he’s a loner (widowed 4 years’ previously), cutting himself off from his friends and living in semi-squalor in a half-complete house. He’s laconic in a way that is reminiscent of Marlowe, and he’s a tough guy who doesn’t know when to quit. As this novel develops, he starts to turn his life around, and his support network starts to confirm itself around him: his deputy, Victoria, and his best friend Henry Standing Bear. The murders are almost incidental to Walt’s own character development, and this is a great introduction to a series.\n\nI Remember – Joe Brainerd. Such a simple concept and so effective. The book is literally a collection of incidents, places, people, things, sensations, experiences etc that Brainerd remembers, and each sentence begins ‘I remember’. It’s simultaneously lulling, because that repetition sets up something of a rhythm but also nostalgic or funny, or dirty as well. The book was published in 1975 and yet there are examples that made me think ‘I remember that too!’, or which I’d heard American friends reminisce about (Oreo cookies and milk). So the particular becomes general and then a window into shared experience.\n\nThe Girls – Lisa Jewell. (Audio). Jewell is clearly shifting genres and fair play to her for trying. But The Girls felt like it was trying to do too much at once: explore the murky world of teens, the reality of their emotions that are often written off by adults, the state and compromises of grown up relationships, mental health, the elderly, the peculiarly public life of living in those particular flats… Alright, already, pick a theme, lady! This didn’t work for me in a number of ways, but mostly because of the structure. Starting with the discovery of Grace’s body, it then tracked back to explore what led to that situation. Which. Took. Ages. And then the whole mystery was solved in about a day. So the structure seemed used solely to bring some suspense into an otherwise not all that suspenseful story. It felt gimmicky, and if you need that gimmick then your story isn’t up to it. The second major off-putting element was the inclusion of Pip’s letters to her father, and it may be that this played fine in print and it may be that they’re authentic. I don’t have kids so I can’t tell. But the audio version was painful and if I hadn’t been driving most of the time, I’d have skipped those bits. What Jewell does so well is the relationships and secrets within families. There was a lot of that here, and it was actually more absorbing than the ‘mystery’. A fined down version could have done without Clare and her family entirely and focused on Adele and her lot. Now those girls were odd, and a long, hot summer in which Adele’s world crumbled as past secrets came to light would have been more compelling. I think Jewell could write it – so is she keeping herself in the disposable fiction section, or are her publishers reining her in?\n\nPattern Recognition – William Gibson.\n\nSamuel Pepys: The Unequalled Self – Claire Tomalin. I liked the first half of this but found that the material from the diary was over-stretched by being handled chronologically and then thematically. Pepys doesn’t come out particularly well but I’d like to read the diaries themselves, and it did get me interested in that particular historical period.\n\nQuiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking – Susan Cain. This was basically a history of my people and I found it illuminating. A lot chimed with what I’ve figured out for myself along the way, or suspected, e.g. the need for quiet time for sustained thinking, in fact the very preference for sustained thinking being at odds with current working environments. It was interesting to read about about why the ‘hail fellow, well met’ type became the epitome of what a successful business person looked like. (There are a lot of plausible sounding males around my current job, who talk a good game and deliver jack shit, which leaves the rest of us scratching our heads a bit.) I also remember the pain of the forced joining in I was made to do a child, when I’d much rather have been lot to my own devices. So it all stacked up for me.\n\nBroken Homes – Ben Aaronovitch. Re-read.\n\nThe Glass Ocean.\n\nWe Are Now Beginning our Descent – James Meeks\n\nThe Man in the High Castle – Philip K Dick.\n\nThe Crooked House – Christopher Kent.\n\nThe Fantastic Book of Everybody’s Secrets – Sophie Hannah.\n\nThe Shepherd’s Life – James Rebanks.\n\nWinter Street – Elin Hildebrand.\n\nA Place Called Winter – Patrick Gale.\n\nSend for Paul Temple – Francis Durbridge.\n\nThe Crossing Places – Elly Griffiths.\n\nThe End of Vandalism – Tom Drury.\n\nI, Robot – Isaac Asimov.\n\n2014\n\nRough Shoot – Geoffrey Household. Rogue Male was better, and now I think I’ve read enough Household to be going on with.\n\nBlackveil – Kristen Britain. Because despite the fact that I don’t love this series and I find the heroine annoyingly uneven, so that she makes obvious mistakes solely to forward the plot, I still kind of want to know what happens.\n\nThe Hundred Days – Patrick O’Brian\n\nKing of the Badgers – Philip Hensher. Which was quietly terrific, and creepy and sad and now I’ll really never trust Neighbourhood Watch again.\n\nWhat Alice Forgot – Liane Moriarty (audio). I almost abandoned this because at the beginning, I wanted to smack Alice. Then I got drawn in. I still found her annoying but the idea of forgetting 10 years of your life was interesting. Would it be that you’d just lost the information, or that you lost the aspects of your personality that those years had formed?\n\nBedsit Disco Queen – Tracey Thorn. I was never a huge fan of EBTG, but this got reviews on Twitter so I was waiting for the pb. I ended up reading aloud the bits that made me laugh, and thoroughly enjoying the rest.\n\nOne Fine Day – Mollie Panter-Downes. I found this oddly dense for such a very short novel, which I think is down the disjointed way in which I read it. It ought really to be tackled in a single sitting. All the action, which is mostly internal and dialogue anyway, takes place in a single hot summer’s day, soon after the end of WWII. Stephen and Laura are adjusting to being back together, and to the reality of a house that’s too big to manage without servants.\n\nThe Examined Life – Stephen Grosz. A rare foray into non-fiction, but Vintage have come up with the Shelfhelp scheme, a reading list of 12 books for the year with the aim ‘New year, same you – just slightly better read’. This was January’s book, and for me it was a quick read, but I envisage going back to it. It’s slices of case history from the author’s psychoanalytical practice, and as such there’s no story and there are no final resolutions. I found if fascinating to dip a toe in the water of so many people’s lives at their variously troubled times. Grosz doesn’t pretend to have all the answers, is sometimes stalled and has his own problems to deal with too, which makes the interplay also of interest. I find it oddly comforting that there aren’t any answers.\n\nA Commonplace Killing – Sian Busby. Apparently based on a true crime, and it was ok as an immediate post-WWII thing but if you want the real tawdry unpleasantness, then Patrick Hamilton is your man.\n\nSaints of the Shadow Bible – Ian Rankin (audio). Rebus back on form, reporting to Siobhan and working uneasily with Malcolm Fox. Wouldn’t have seen that one coming, and if anything I felt as though there was more character development for Fox in this novel than in his stand-alones.\n\nBlue at the Mizzen – Patrick O’Brian.\n\nThe Unexpected Consequences of Love – Jill Mansell (audio).\n\nThe Last Banquet – J C Grimwood\n\nThe Shock of the Fall – Nathan Filer\n\nBlack Swan Green – David Mitchell.\n\nOrkney – Amy Sackville.\n\nFive Days – Douglas Kennedy (audio). This is so, so good that I might buy it in print as well so I can enjoy reading it. The writing is articulate and precise, piling up in sub-clauses that intensify rather than mystify meaning. I’m recommending it to everyone. Update: Except that it kind of fell off a cliff half way through. Curses.\n\nFallen Blade – Jon Courtenay Grimwood.\n\nThe London Train – Tessa Hadley.\n\nNight Film – Marissa Pessl\n\nNever Mind Miss Fox – Olivia Glazebrook\n\nPicnic at Hanging Rock – Joan Lindsay\n\nBoy, Snow, Bird – Helen Oyeyemi\n\nThe Owl Who Like to Sit on Caesar – Martin Windrow.\n\nMisfortune – Wesley Stace\n\nThe Harpole Report – J.L. Carr\n\nClever Girl – Tessa Hadley. Completely different to the Hadley I read last month, and much more interesting than the blurb makes it sound, because that only covers the beginning of the story. The confusions and messes of ordinary life are all laid bare, but with understanding. Reminded me slightly of the tim, An Education, although that protagonist avoided early pregnancy skewing her life’s direction.\n\nThe Dynamite Room – Jason Hewitt. Not your average first novel and for my money, better than Nathan Filer’s The Shock of the Fall (both authors are alumni of the Bath MA in Creative Writing),The opening is eery and gripping, nicely setting the sense of isolation that pervades throughout. This is a different take on WWII, with a mystery at its hear that gradually unfolds and is more surprising in its ‘why?’ than it’s ‘how?’. It’s a poignant reminder of how war changes individuals, and how desperately they may want to get away from what they’ve become. I don’t know if the echo of The Return of Martin Guerre was intended, but that was a different war in a different time.\n\nTis Pity She’s a Whore – John Ford. Not the lightest holiday reading but prep before seeing the play. I liked it but I still found the characters easy fall into incest unlikely. The performance helped, by casting Annabella as a heedless teenager (and by cutting the dodgy sub-plots). As with Joss Whedon’s Much Ado about Nothing where everyone is drunk and it all makes a lot more sense, Annabella as teenager thinking only of the moment and then unable to find her way out of trouble except by presumably hoping that ‘something will turn up’, both made sense of her actions and underlined the tragedy.\n\nThe Autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini – Benvenuto Cellini. This was the fun holiday read, the first autobiography to be more than a dry list of deeds. I’m sure no more accurate than contemporary autobiographies but Cellini recounts his training, travels, commissions, work and travails with gusto. He’s always the maestro, and he’s always right, making him a hard artist for any prince or king to put up with.\n\nAll the Birds, Singing – Evie Wyld. The first delivery from my Blackwell’s curated TBR list! I liked the structure of this, shifting back and forth in time and unwinding back to the even that started Jake on her path to the current isolated island and a few sheep to farm. It’s brutal in places, plain prose leaving the reader nowhere to hide, and Jake both tough and vulnerably paranoid. Lloyd, a figure with his own burden that is too heavy for him to carry, staggers into her life accidentally but ultimately fortuitously.\n\nThe Last, Unfinished Voyage of John Aubrey – Patrick O’Brian. I didn’t read the manuscript part but I’m content leaving Jack and Stephen looking forward to further travels and their families. All good things must come to an end.\n\nWildwood: A Journey through Trees – Roger Deakin. Part diary, nature, social history and folklore, ecology notes, travel writing. Deakin has a great way with metaphor, and with piling up his nouns in some of the pieces. I was flicking to the internet for visuals to match the descriptions of Paul Nash’s works, and noting fellow authors to follow up on.\n\nSandman 1: Nocturnes and Preludes – Neil Gaiman. I don’t have a great track record of making it through comic books, but Sandman just seems like something I ought to read. So I gave it a go. The usual problems were there, but mitigated a bit, so I could follow the text and I didn’t pay much attention to the artwork. I liked the quick change of genres throughout, but by the end I felt I’d snacked rather than consumed a meal. Still, I’m interested enough in Morpheus, and particularly in Death, to read more over time.\n\nThe Human Comedy: Selected Stories – Honore de Balzac. From which so far I have read ‘Facino Cane’, ‘A Passion in the Desert’ and ‘Sarrasine’. This will be one to dip in and out of, but of course a great reminder that I ought to read more Balzac.\n\nWhat I Loved – Siri Hustvedt. Which I loved, and am so pleased to have found a new author.\n\nThe Wild Places – Robert MacFarlane. Serendipitous reading, as it’s dedicated to Deakin and he crops up as one of MacFarlane’s friends. There’s a chapter investigating holloways too, and I’m interested in those ever since reading Rogue Male (which also gets a mention). I do feel that MacFarlane has a bit of a tendency to make assumptions about how ‘we’ all feel, and he can be a bit over-written for my taste, so sometimes I thought he was finding his way via the writing. I am also comforted by his conclusion, though: that the wild, harsh landscapes have a daunting and frightening implacability about them and that, when human life disappears from the earth, the wild will take over again.\n\nThe Beautiful Indifference – Sarah Hall. (The Blackwell’s Curated Reading List #2) I had womanfully resisted what was, after all, a very slight paperback, but I really wanted to read these stories. So I was delighted when it turned up in this month’s surprise package. The stories were terrific, all very different settings and voices in such sharp, sparse writing. I felt that the namelessness of places and often the women too, lent a dreamlike quality and I kept reaching for a pen to note some of the language: the ‘wet crackle’ of champagne, the ‘benthic silence’ of a lake. Now I’m very keen to try one of her novels.\n\nThe Secret Hangman – Peter Lovesey. A lazy afternoon re-read, which I pretty much romped through.\n\nThe Outcast Blade – Jon Courtenay Grimwood. vol 2 of the Assassini. Starting to feel as though the story is coming together a bit more. Also, liking that some formerly powerful characters are dead.\n\nThey Were Counted – Miklos Banffy.\n\nThe Hive – Gill Hornby.\n\nDeath on the Cherwell – Mavis Doriel Hay. A nice, classic murder set in Oxford.\n\nThe Exiled Blade – Jon Courtenay Grimwood. vol 3 of the Assassini, which wrapped things up neatly, if a bit abruptly.\n\nThe Bone Season – Shannon Stone. Interesting concept and totally fine, but really, I think I am done with the feisty, outsider heroines who have special skills and battle against the odds and for whom the regular narrative realities break down so that they don’t die way too early in the franchise. I mean, series.\n\nSixty-One Nails – Mike Shevdon. Perfectly competent trashy fantasy lit, in an ‘Ooh, I’ve read Neverwhere, I can totes riff on that’ kind of way. Main stumbling block for me is that the hero is a twit and there is absolutely no reason that Blackbird would be interested in him at all. Vol 1 in I don’t know how many and it doesn’t matter because I have no need to read further.\n\nThe Unknown Ajax – Georgette Heyer. Well, I needed something to read while I was figuring out what to read.\n\nThe Long Dark Night – Peter Lovesey. Found three Loveseys for a fiver. Bought them. I never know what’s going on in a Peter Diamond mystery. Good, now I know where Julie went.\n\nNatural Causes – James Oswald (audio). Which I liked, except for the supernatural element which I thought was going to be explained away as not being supernatural and then wasn’t. Which provoked my ‘No, really?’ response to the ending, because it seems a cop out.\n\nThe Vault – Peter Lovesey. Good, now I know how Ingeborg ended up on the force.\n\nThe Tooth Tattoo – Peter Lovesey.\n\nFevre Dream – Georg R R Martin. GRR does vampires.\n\nThe Deaths – Mark Lawson. How the other half lives (in a shitload of debt and precariously), this was like the dirtier, nastier version of The Hive. Lawson neatly skewers any number of pretensions. In one lovely little scene, a character does a victory dance of schadenfreude, because their delivery of ridiculously over-priced coffee for their ‘CappucinGo’ machine includes some of the limited edition special, whereas a neighbor missed out. Middle class problems laid bare.\n\nWhen We Were Orphans – Kazuo Ishiguro. Which I liked more for the writing than the story. I wasn’t sure how seriously I was supposed to take Christopher’s obsession with finding his parents, it was like a grown up version of the fascination he and Akira had with the servant’s room. They concocted an unbelievable story that each half-believed in, enough to continue convincing the other. The characters around Christopher seemed complicit in encouraging him to investigate the obviously ridiculous theory about his parents’ disappearance. The truth, when finally discovered, was as prosaic as a room simply containing an old servant’s belongings.\n\nThe Man in the Queue – Josephine Tey.\n\nDon’t Point that Thing at Me – Kyril Bonfiglio. I am grateful for any book that gives me the expression ‘a traffic warden’s catamite’ and the word ‘ecdysiast’. Art theft, thuggery, bluffing, double bluffing, secret services and insults to his bespoke tailoring. It’s a wonder Charlie Mortdecai survives it all.\n\nAn Education – Lynn Barber. What fun times Lynn Barber has had. I enjoyed the film An Education, and on reading the memoir remain equally baffled as to what her parents were thinking.\n\nOlive Kitteridge – Elizabeth Strout. I actually meant to buy Amy & Isabelle, but came out with this by mistake. All I vaguely knew was that Olive was a horrible character, which, although there are examples of her compassion and understanding, on balance I think she was. But I like episodic novels and I liked the snapshot views of the other characters in town, and the way that Olive and Henry’s story was interweaved.\n\n& Sons – David Gilbert.\n\nThe Silkworm – Robert Galbraith. I liked The Cuckoo’s Calling, and I liked this too. I think Rowling writes a good detective story and I’ll be happy to see more of Cormoran Strike.\n\nKai Lung’s Golden Hours – Ernest Bramah. Whenever people have asked what I’m reading and I say this, they give me blank looks. But it’s such a treat, such delicious, sly humor that is all about the language.\n\nThe Years – Virginia Woolf. Which I bought while visiting Charleston, as I’d been put under the Bloomsbury spell again. I wasn’t optimistic because I struggle with Woolf, but actually, I finished it, and actually, mostly I enjoyed it. And when I wasn’t enjoying it, I still admired the writing.\n\nMiddlemarch – George Eliot. The first Eliot that I remember and it was great, so now I shall embark on my Eliot. I moved from hating Dorothea to feeling very sorry for her. Nicely done, George!\n\nDo No Harm – Henry Marsh. Non-fiction sent me by Euan as a wild card for this month’s Blackwells delivery. Marsh was a brain surgeon so this is a collection of his cases. It’s good but rather bleak, so I’m interspersing it with cheerier stuff.\n\nHens Dancing – Raffaella Barker. Picked up because I was attracted by the title and the cover, turned out to be superior chicklit that made me giggle around. I read it mostly sitting in London sunshine, sipping white wine and feeling like summer.\n\nThe Faerie Queen – Edmund Spenser. So, I have committed to reading this at the rate of one canto a day, and I’m already four cantos behind. It’s been a busy week. The good thing is that I am hooked, and so it’ll be no chore to catch up today. If only the damn thing weren’t so huge, I’d carry it around with me for lunchtime reading.\n\nSpeak, Memory – Vladimir Nabokov. I started underlining the good bits and great words, and then gave up because I’d have underlined the whole thing. Must now read more Nabokov and probably re-read Lolita again.\n\nAugustus – John Williams. Well, this was brilliant, for me better than Stoner. I was gripped from the opening pages and I loved the multiple perspectives, so that it wasn’t a straightforward and chronological narrative. Also, great to be reminded of names I haven’t thought of in years – Tibullus, Propertius, Maecenas. So, I bought some Livy and I will have to read Virgil’s Eclogues.\n\nA High Wind in Jamaica – Richard Hughes. Not as disturbing as Lord of the Flies, until the completely chilling bit at the end. In essence, children captured by ‘pirates’. Which group is the most morally deficient?\n\nFrench Decadent Tales, trans. Stephen Romer. Oh those French and their decadence. This was a good mix of the mad (man falls in love with hair. Yes. Hair.), spooky, the odd and the people getting their deserved comeuppance. I particularly liked ‘The Bath’ by Octave Mirbeau. Chap decides he needs a wife because he’s basically too lazy to get his arse out of an armchair in the evening and she would be able to bring him things and look pretty. Carefully chosen wife watches him drown in an over-heated bath. You go, girl!\n\nSwitch: How to change things when change is hard – Chip and Dan Heath. Ok, I’m reading a business book by someone called ‘Chip’ and it says New York Times No 1 Bestseller on the front. I know, I know. It talks about the elephant, the rider and the path. It’s a short step from here to Chicken Soup for Those Who Broke a Nail. But, this was recommended by a friend of mine who is not a whack job so I will give it a fair hearing. I will.\n\nDay of the Triffids – John Wyndham. I find The Midwich Cuckoos far more unsettling, but this was good stuff, of course, throwing up some interesting questions.\n\nBig Little Lies – Liane Moriarty (audio). I’m forcing myself to take a break between Wolf Hall and Bring up the Bodies on audiobook, to break my guilty lit crush on fictional Thomas Cromwell (I know, morally v dodgy etc). So, I’m liking this much more than What Alice Forgot, I think mostly because Madeline is a great character and Alice was bloody annoying. Also, of course, there’s a murder to be revealed and that’s much more interesting than finding out if someone gets their memory back.\n\nBring up the Bodies – Hilary Mantel (audio). After my brief back, I was straight back in there with Thomas Cromwell. I actually didn’t love this narrator as much as the one for Wolf Hall, but I still raced through the audiobook.\n\nWaterlog – Roger Deakin. Very much like Wildwood, except about water.\n\nThe Secret Place – Tana French (audio). I’m a fan of Tana French and this didn’t let me down. I liked the structure of the alternate chapters from past and present weaving the narrative together, and that familiar theme of a special relationship breaking down. I just about remember the powerfully enclosed relationships girls can have, how impossible it seems that anything can break them. Good to see more of Frank Mackie as well, I hope he’ll be back in future novels.\n\nThe Girl on the Train – Paula Hawkins.\n\nDaughter – Jane Shemil. So, ok but I’m still not sure that the narrative structure was necessary to add to the tension. Particularly as it was clear from the outset that the missing daughter wasn’t dead, because if she had been then there’s no way a narrator couldn’t mention it without being unbelievable. But, I did like the way the cosy, family life just unravelled when under investigation.\n\nMy Brother Michael – Mary Stewart. This so did not stand the test of time. More of a love story than a detective story, but not much of either.\n\nCloud Atlas – David Mitchell. Fab, loved all the stories and twists and interweavings.\n\nFangirl – Rainbow Rowell. Meh. A version of Penelope for a slightly younger audience.\n\nThe Weissmans of Westport. Sort of a reworking of Sense & Sensibility but not totally faithful, which made it more interesting.\n\nThe Invisible Ones – Stef Penney. This was disappointing, because I loved The Tenderness of Wolves so much. I felt that the poisoning was pointless and didn’t really go anywhere, and the surprise wasn’t much of one, in the end. Too many clues all the way through.\n\nThe Hypnotist’s Love Story – Liane Moriarty (audio). I have accidentally become a Moriarty fan. I like this, particularly because there seemed a real chance that it might not work out, only partly because of Saskia.\n\nThe Professional – Robert B. Parker.\n\nThe Cutting Season – Attica Locke. I finished it, but I didn’t really get into it because of the boneheadedness of the main character. Yes, the police were being idiots and didn’t trust her, but that’s because she kept not telling them information that was vital to the investigation apparently so she could sort the whole thing out herself, in order for a dramatic but surprisingly tension free denouement. Pfft.\n\nShotgun Lovesongs – Nicholas Butler. Fabulous, I want to move to that town and hang out with Lee, Hank and Beth.\n\nThe Amber Fury – Natalie Haynes. This was a bit disappointing, after all the reviews, and seemed somehow too unlikely and too much of a set piece. I think also, I’m just about out of patience with multi-part narratives and non-linear chronologies and diary extracts and it’s all starting to feel a bit gimmicky. Could someone just write a straightforward novel?\n\nThe Bone Clocks – David Mitchell. I liked the first half, and particularly Holly Sykes. But the Crispin Hershey chapter almost made me lose the will to live, and the whole battle between the good eternals and the bad eternals was WTF, and the last chapter was depressing. Although probably also predictive. So, on balance, disappointing.\n\nThe Miniaturist – Jessie Burton. What? No. Well reviewed all over the place, I thought it was kind of a mess.\n\nThe Dogs of Littlefield – Suzanne Berne.\n\nThe One Plus One – Jojo Moyes (audio). Absolutely fine, should have read it rather than listening to it because it didn’t need that much time devoting to it. A book for a rainy afternoon when you want a bit of troubled romance en route to happily ever after.\n\nA Breach of Security – Susan Hill. A Simon Serrailler short, filling a gap while I either wait for the latest in pb or get it on audio.\n\nChoral Mediations in Greek Tragedy – Gagne and Hopma (eds). Dipping a toe back in the bracing waters of academic writing, and I could feel lazy brain muscles being stretched. On balance, I think I disagree with Bierl’s confusion in his chapter on the maenadic chorus in Bacchae. But Laura Swift on the chorus in Medea and Ion gave me a lot to think about; and now I must re-read Ion.\n\nThe Soul of Discretion – Susan Hill (audio). This went into extra bleak territory of both child abuse and rape, and in places it made for some tough listening. But it was good, if haunting and I suddenly realized I had no confidence about how the ending would work out, so that made it really tense. This is such a consistently strong series.\n\nThe Mystery of Mrs Blencarrow – Mrs Oliphant. Of the two novellas in this slim volume, I preferred the second, Eleanor and Rose. I knew what was happening in both the stories but the how it unfolded worked.\n\nAphrodite’s Workshop for Reluctant Lovers – Marika Gobbold. Trash read, and not a patch on Marie Philips when it comes to introducing Greek gods into contemporary life. It was a perfectly acceptable way to spend an afternoon, and I can’t really add more than that because I don’t remember anything much about it.\n\nThe Flame Trees of Thika – Elspeth Huxley. Yes, fine, I bought this partly because it’s a glorious orange cloth-covered hardback from Slightly Foxed. One of those books you eventually get around to reading because you’re surprised you haven’t already.\n\nHer – Harriet Lane (audio). My problem with this was that while Nina was a horrible nutter, Emma was such a total drip that I didn’t have a lot of sympathy for her. The story was told from both perspectives, which led to a lot of repetition; and it didn’t get going until about the last 10 minutes. And then the ending was ambiguous.\n\nVince & Joy – Lisa Jewell. Emergency re-read.\n\n30 Nothing – Lisa Jewell (audio).\n\nA Wreath of Roses – Elizabeth Taylor. I really thought I hadn’t read this but then it seemed vaguely familiar all the way through. Beautifully written as ever from Taylor, but massively depressing.\n\nI Let You Go – Clare Mackintosh. Small print: Clare is a friend of my sister’s. I’ve met her once and we occasionally tweet each other. This is Clare’s debut novel and of course I had to support her and buy the book. The set up is straightforward: 5 year old boy killed in hit and run, in which the driver doesn’t stop. Or is it straightforward? Of course, there’s more than meets the eye and I really didn’t see the twist coming. I started reading this on the train, was annoyed when I had to put it down for the evening, picked it up as soon as I could and went to sleep thinking ‘But it couldn’t be her… so is it him?… or wait, was it…?’ Then I got up in the morning and polished off the rest. I had some quibbles, and I didn’t quite buy the Ray & Mags relationship, which seemed a bit sketched in. But the book kept me reading, and provided a satisfactorily tense ending. I’d buy more.\n\nFoxglove Summer – Ben Aaronovitch. Skipped happily through this one Saturday morning, nice to see Peter finally getting it together with Bev, and to see an answer to the question, ‘What have the Romans done for us?’ Kept the fae at bay with their nice straight roads, that’s what. This was fine but it felt like an interlude, and it didn’t seem to do much to move the main story arc along. Either the next book will prove this one was crucial, or the cynical might think the publishers are eking out the series for the dosh.\n\nMystery in White – J. Jefferson Farjeon. Which I sort of thought I might keep for my Christmas read, but it became my Sunday afternoon read instead. Assorted group of travelers on a train heading to their various places for Christmas get stuck in a snowstorm. They leave the train to try to get to a branch station, but only make it as far as welcoming, but mysterious house. Why are the fires lit and tea ready but no one there? And who left the bread knife on the kitchen floor? The mysteries and atmosphere pile up with the snow.\n\nLong Way Home – Eva Dolan. I’ve wanted to read this since I saw Eva Dolan at Stories Aloud, so was glad I finally found the pb. It’s a good crime novel, very well constructed and without the maverick, loner cop at the heart of it. It’s also a window into a sub-culture that doesn’t get a lot of attention, that of the immigrant workers suffering misery at the hands of those willing to exploit their vulnerability. Dolan writes with assurance and fluidity, and I’m interested to see where Zigic and Ferreira go next.\n\nGrass Green – Raffaella Barker.\n\nBalancing Act – Joanna Trollope. This felt a bit lightweight to me, I think because the device of the long lost father turning up felt contrived. It seemed that the family set up could have imploded without him saying things like ‘Maybe I’m just what you all need’. I found I couldn’t tell the daughters and their husbands apart and there wasn’t space to go into their lives enough to make them interesting.\n\nVenetia – Georgette Heyer (audio). Newly available on audio and Damerel is my favourite rakish hero, so I couldn’t resist.\n\nSugar Hall – Tiffany Murray. Proper creepy stuff.\n\nThe Sleeper and the Spindle – Neil Gaiman, ill. Chris Riddell. Great re-telling of both Snow white and the Seven Dwarves and Sleeping Beauty, and beautifully illustrated. The book is a lovely object.\n\nCount the Stars – Helen Dunmore. I thought this started really well and then went nowhere and it didn’t add anything to what is known of Catullus’ relationship with Lesbia from his poetry. He loved her, he hated her, she was bewitching, she was a bitch.\n\nNorthanger Abbey – Val McDermid. I have recently had a conversation with Mr W in which we decry the fake Austen industry, and then I went and fell for this. I will say that I find Catherine Morland hard work anyway, but when she’s moved to modern day, her nitwittery becomes unforgivable.\n\nThe House in Norham Gardens – Penelope Lively.\n\nDragon’s Claw – Peter O’Donnell\n\nEleanor & Park – Rainbow Rowell\n\nSense & Sensibility – Joanna Trollope\n\nArabella – Georgette Heyer (audio)\n\nNos4R2 – Joe Hill. Abandoned c. 150pp in because it’s just not working for me.\n\nThe Financial Lives of the Poets – Jess Waters. Abandoned about a third in because it’s not gripping me.\n\n2013\n\nParade’s End – Ford Madox Ford. Easing in the new year with a light read, then. I have all 4 vols in one, and I’m not sure I can cope with too much of WWI, so let’s just start with Some Do Not… and see how it goes. I’m kinda hoping this will be the WWI equivalent of Sword of Honour.\n\nThe Surgeon’s Mate – Patrick O’Brian. I’d forgotten about Jagiello, bless him.\n\nAncient Greece in Film and Popular Culture – Gideon Nisbet. Kind of fun, and sort of a primer in ‘reading’ film and TV. Am now very relieved I don’t have to watch Alexander, or 300.\n\nPatience – John Coates.\n\nSmall Gods – Terry Pratchett.\n\nFirst among Sequels – Jasper Fforde.\n\n1974 – David Peace. Gripping from the first page, but only one for those who like their violence, racism, sexism, corruption, and police brutality. Welcome to the 1970s.\n\nWreath of Roses – Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nReligio Medici – Thomas Browne.\n\nThe Ionian Mission – Patrick O’Brian\n\nThe Court of the Air – Stephen Hunt.\n\nThe Woman Novelist and Other Studies – Diana Gardner\n\nMiss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children – Ransom Riggs. One of those gimmicky books that’s pretending to be good, but isn’t. Although, there were some good lines buried in there, and I wouldn’t automatically discount any future books by Riggs. But y’all skip this one.\n\nThe Light Years – Elizabeth Jane Howard. First in the Cazalet chronicles, and I’ll certainly be reading the rest of them.\n\nThe Northern Clemency – Philip Hensher\n\nTreason’s Harbour – Patrick O’Brian. Am fairly sure some dastardly French person is plotting horribly against Stephen in this one; but even more sure he will see through the plot and problies turn it against them. Jack will make the occasional dodgy quip.\n\nTake a Chance on Me – Jill Mansell. I’d have liked this more if all the characters hadn’t been in their 20s and 30s and still acting like teenagers.\n\nSimonetta Perkins – L. P. Hartley – Is kind of Lucy Honeychurch’s story, if she had been more self-aware.\n\nThe Making of a Marchioness – Frances Hodgson Burnett. This was on TV around Christmas, and I watched part of one episode and then decided I’d rather re-read the book. So I did.\n\nPersuasion – Jane Austen. It was an Austen kind of day.\n\nDon’t Want to Miss a Thing – Jill Mansell. Audiofroth. Mansell is penalised for over-use of the word ‘starfish’ to describe a baby’s hands. One of the sub-plots was a bit weak and unnecessary but hey, it kept me listening.\n\nThe Out of Office Girl – Nicola Doherty. Print froth. Asst editor Alice is sent to Sicily to work on a celeb book with a Hollywood star. Of course. She gets the book, she gets the man, no surprises here but decently done and as light as a souffle.\n\nA Question of Identity – Susan Hill. The latest Serrailler, on audio.\n\nThe Dwarves of Death – Jonathon Coe. Bought this for the title, thoroughly enjoyed it. Engaging narrative voice, and a surprise ending.\n\nThe Standing Pool – Adam Thorpe. Which I was kind of expecting to be much nastier than it was.\n\nDolly – Susan Hill. Another good, spooky tale. As if dolls aren’t creepy enough anyway.\n\nGold – Chris Cleave.\n\nNeverwhere – Neil Gaiman. On audio, read by Neil. You can tell it’s an early work but it still stands up. Switched to finishing in print for the last 100pp.\n\nBlack Narcissus – Rumer Godden. The first of Godden’s adult novels that I’ve read and I liked it a lot. Reminds me of Warner’s Mr Fortune’s Maggot for the effect of place on those who go there with a mission.\n\nThe Land of Decoration – Grace McKeen.\n\nA Time of Gifts – Patrick Leigh Fermor\n\nBricks and Mortar – Helen Ashton.\n\nThe Ballad and the Source – Rosamund Lehmann. Nice old Virago Modern Classic I got from the Slightly Foxed bookshop. Sybil Anstey is a monster.\n\nQuicksilver – Neal Stephenson. In an attempt to slow myself down I know have the entire Baroque Cycle. Let’s see how this goes.\n\nThe Far Side of the World – Patrick O’Brian.\n\nA Monster Calls – Patrick Ness. This was several shades of awesome, multi-layered and tragic.\n\nUnicorns vs Zombies – Holly Black and Justine Larbalastier (eds). I guess it’s a handy gimmick for the YA market to pitch one supernatural thing against another. Doesn’t work for me, but maybe unicorns don’t sell on their own? Anyway, some good stories in here: Garth Nix, Margo Lanagan. Worth a flick through.\n\nThis Isn’t the Sort of Thing that Happens to Someone Like You – Jon McGregor. Picked this up at Stories Aloud in Oxford, after a reading of the first story from the collection.\n\nThe Everyman Book of Ghost Stories – This has been by my bed, so I can dip into it before I go to sleep. ‘Ghost’ seems to be shorthand for any story in which there’s some sort of supernatural influence, but this is a great collection.\n\nThe Poison Tree – Erin Kelly (audio). I’m not sure if it was the audio that made this feel particularly tortuous, or if the print would have been just as bad. But generally I find that audio magnifies the problems with the print: the spoken word seems to highlight just how unlikely the dialogue is, or how unnatural the characters’ actions are. I like novels that are set across split times, but weaving together past and present narratives and sustaining suspense without being too heavy-handed is a tough call. Kelly’s not up to the job. The foreshadowing was in neon, and the sequence of events leading up to both crises was clearly set out, step by painful step. Even more annoying, neither had to happen; they were provoked by characters making stupid, plot-driven decisions at key points. This is the kind of novel that only works when the inner works are not so apparent.\n\nThe Closed Door and Other Stories – Dorothy Whipple. The title story is just heart-breaking, in that particularly Whipple way. Several of the stories are a reminder of just how limited women’s lives were, dependent at the very least on family not getting in their way.\n\nLevels of Life – Julian Barnes. I will probably be the only person in the world not to have loved this; but I didn’t. I thought it was thin.\n\nDuplicate Death – Georgette Heyer. A re-re-re-read, but I was sick.\n\nA Blunt Instrument – Georgette Heyer. See above.\n\nThe Reverse of the Medal – Patrick O’Brian. This is where the series really gets going, for me, oddly enough when Jack gets kicked out of the Navy. Two great scenes in this book: the first, where Jack’s illegitimate son turns up, and despite being African is clearly his spitting image; the second, when Jack is in pillory, with a crowd of sailors from across the country protecting him and cheering him on.\n\nWhat was Lost – Catherine O’Flynn. Picked up recently at Short Stories Aloud, on the recommendation of Ms G and because the author was there and I liked her. Under normal circumstances I’d have ignored this entirely, which would have been a shame. The two, connected narratives are simply and deftly handled, with episodic interludes adding an additional layer to the story. Girl detective, Kate Meaney, goes missing when she’s 10; 20 years later, two workers at a shopping mall where Kate used to do a lot of her detecting, are reminded of her story. Both frozen in their own lives, their meeting is a catalyst that jolts them back into action, and in doing so provides the key to solving the mystery of Kate’s disappearance.\n\nSidney Chambers and the Perils of Night – James Runcie. Of which I saw the elegant spine in someone else’s TBR list and was immediately interested (nice job, Bloomsbury!). Bless the lovely Ms F, she lent it to me. Second in the Grantchester Mysteries.\n\nBurning Bright – Ron Rash. A short story collection from the other author at the recent Stories Aloud. Terrific stuff.\n\nThe Cove – Ron Rash. Enjoyed the stories, so straight on with the novel. Goodness, but this had a heartbreaking ending.\n\nMay We Be Forgiven – A.M. Homes. Unputdownable, and now I’ve finished I need to read everything else she’s written.\n\nThe Daylight Gate – Jeanette Winterson. Witchcraft. Always madness about men’s fear of what they don’t understand, especially when embodied by women. This was great, I hope Hammer do justice to the film. The Woman in Black didn’t exactly fill me with confidence.\n\nThe Beginner’s Goodbye – Anne Tyler.\n\nUlverton – Adam Thorpe. Damn, I’d forgotten how good this is. Take a bow, Mr Thorpe.\n\nLetter of Marque – Patrick O’Brian. Oh, this is a good one. It is around book 11 that the series really gets going; this is book 12, and after Jack hit his lowest point by being dismissed the naval lists in the last one, all is recovered: reputation, post-captaincy and fortune. Plus, Stephen’s on again, off again marriage with Diana is back on; which, while I hate Diana, makes me happy for Stephen.\n\nThe Orphan Choir – Sophie Hannah. Which was proper spooky, and which I liked because I couldn’t tell if Lou was nuts to start with, going nuts or normal. And then because I couldn’t tell where the threat was coming from, or even if there really was one. This was another one from the new Hammer/Random House imprint, which I’ve been enjoying so far, and has therefore become that rare thing: an imprint to pay attention to.\n\nThe Panopticon – Jenni Fagan.\n\nFludd – Hilary Mantel. I remembered really enjoying this but I thought it was darker and more elemental. What I hadn’t remember was that it’s very funny.\n\nThe Village School – Miss Read.\n\nBrother of the More Famous Jack – Barbara Trapido. Which I have read a bazillion times before, but I went out without a book, then I bought this for Marcy, then I found myself somewhere with a glass of wine. So I re-read the Trapido and it’s still really good.\n\nA Month in the Country – JL Carr. Odd little masterpiece that it is. I picked it up again as a re-read while I’m trying to figure out what to read next.\n\nApple Tree Yard – Louise Doughty. So, the Twitter was alive with recommendations for this, and like an idiot I went and read the prologue in the store. And then had to buy it and read it. Suspense, crime, courtroom drama and so well done. Couldn’t put it down.\n\nBefore I Met You – Lisa Jewell.\n\nDissolution – C J Sansom\n\nThe Revenge of the Middle Aged Woman – Elizabeth Buchan\n\nThe Swimming Party – Madeline Wickham\n\nNow and Then – Robert Parker\n\nThe Godwulf Manuscript – Robert Parker\n\nJoyland – Stephen King. ‘When you’re twenty-one, life is a roadmap. It’s only when you get to be twenty-five or so that you begin to suspect you’ve been looking at the map upside down, and not until you’re forty are you entirely sure. By the time you’re sixty, take it from me, you’re fucking lost.’\n\nBeautiful Ruins – Jess Walter\n\nThe Ocean at the End of the Lane – Neil Gaiman. Just do yourself a favour, and read it. Plan for one sitting.\n\nThe Thirteen Gun Salute – Patrick O’Brian.\n\nWhere D’You Go, Bernadette? – Maria Semple.\n\nGaudy Night – DL Sayers\n\nThe Nutmeg of Consolation – Patrick O’Brian\n\nThe Carrier – Sophie Hannah\n\nBroken Homes – Ben Aaronavitch\n\nThe Cuckoo’s Calling – Robert Galbraith\n\nOur Spoons Came from Woolworths – Barbara Comyns\n\nAngelmaker – Nick Harkaway. Which definitely stood up to a second reading but I demand more Mercer Cradle.\n\nMr Penumbra’s 24 Hour Bookstore – Robin Sloan. Booky, geeky fun. Best not to pay too close attention to the central craziness and just go along for the ride.Stoner – John Williams. Brilliant stuff.\n\nThe Red House – Mark Haddon. Fine at the time, forgettable.\n\nThe Shining Girls – Lauren Beukes Meh. I require a little more information on how the time travel thing works, and how the talismans manage to keep taking Harper back to the same girls. All a bit glossed over for my liking, and therefore unconvincing. Kept waiting for it to do something interesting, but it didn’t.\n\nClarissa Oakes – Patrick O’Brian. I found I remembered absolutely nothing about this at all. Not one of the liveliest but still perfectly readable.\n\nWreckers Must Breathe – Hammond Innes\n\nIn the Spring Time of the Year – Susan Hill\n\nWild Strawberries – Angela Thirkell\n\nThe Black Moth – Georgette Heyer (audio)\n\nMaking Time – Elizabeth Jane Howard. Vol 2 of the Cazalet chronicles, which I’m really enjoying.\n\nThe Wine Dark Sea – Patrick O’Brian.\n\nThe House We Grew up In – Lisa Jewell.\n\nNaked Heat – Richard Castle. Couldn’t quite resist this, but don’t think I’ll be reading more. Rather just watch Castle.\n\nInstructions for a Heat Wave – Maggie O’Farrell. Perfectly drawn.\n\nThe Commodore – Patrick O’Brian.\n\nBlack Sheep – Susan Hill. Brief and tragic.\n\nPolgara the Sorceress – David Eddings. Yes, things are precisely that bad that I took refuge for a day in dodgy fantasy.\n\nThe Headhunters – Peter Lovesey\n\nThe Black House – Peter May (audio)\n\nConfusion – Elizabeth Jane Howard. Vol 3 of the Cazalet chronicles, which are all I really want to read at the moment.\n\nCasting Off – Elizabeth Jane Howard. Vol 4 of the Cazalet chronicles.\n\nA View from the Harbour – Elizabeth Taylor\n\nFirst Rider’s Call – Kristen Britain\n\nThe High King’s Tomb – Kristen Britain\n\nThe Yellow Admiral – Patrick O’Brian\n\nRogue Male – Geoffrey Household. And why did I not know of this before? Hats off to Mr B’s Emporium for getting it back into print, and in a very nice edition, too. It’s a small classic of the spy-suspense genre. Compelling, chilling, claustrophobic and pitiless.\n\nThe Wolves of Willoughby Chase – Joan Aiken\n\nThe Dark is Rising – Susan Cooper\n\nAll Change – Elizabeth Jane Howard. And thus ends the Cazalet chronicles, leaving me with a big reading hole to fill.\n\nLasting Damage – Sophie Hannah\n\nThe Goldfinch – Donna Tartt\n\nPenelope – Rebecca Harrington\n\nAll My Friends are Superheroes – Andrew Kauffman.\n\n2012\n\nAny Human Face – Charles Lambert. Crime novel set in ‘the Rome that tourists don’t see’. Which, pretty much makes it anywhere, really. It was fine, but the bits I really liked were the sub-plot stuff. I want to know more about Alina! More on Alex and Roger! Oh, I guess we’re back to the photos.\n\nThe Somnambulist – Essie Fox. I’m abandoning this at p. 261 because it is melodramatic awfulness conveying no real sense of the period it’s supposed to be set in. And the heroine is a nitwit and the other characters are made from cheap cardboard. And I’ve read versions of the same thing at least 3,759 times before. I want my fucking money back but I wouldn’t sell this to anyone.\n\nDiary of a Nobody – George and Weedon Grossmith. Ah, bless Charles Pooter and the long-suffering Carrie.\n\nBlindfold Games – Alan Ross. I seem to be reading an awful lot about cricket, and how the wonders of cricket can be expressed in poetry. But we’re building up to WWII.\n\nGeorgette Heyer: Biography of a Bestseller – Jennifer Kloester. It has taken me a week to drag myself through this not very weighty item, all the while feeling very sorry for Heyer that she hasn’t had a better biographer. The only reason I finished the book was that I wanted some of the information in it to be transferred to my head; but I resented that actually reading it was the only way for that to happen. As it turns out, Heyer doesn’t provide much material for a biographer to work on, and when the writer is as dull and plodding as Kloester she could use all the help she can get. Stick to the novels.\n\nThe Risk of Darkness – Susan Hill. Book the third in the DCI Simon Serrailler series, and jolly good too. I like the way the series is unfolding and not just in the stock ways, either. Lots of good characters who get as much attention as Serrailler.\n\nBefore I Go to Sleep – SJ Watson. Not a bad debut mystery thriller; the destination becomes obvious but the journey is still good.\n\nDetection Unlimited – Georgette Heyer.\n\nDeath in the Stocks – Georgette Heyer.\n\nThe Duke’s Children – Anthony Trollope. So far, I am feeling very sorry for the Duke, who is a jolly decent old stick. I hope his children buck their ideas up. So, now I’ve finished this, I’m thinking old Planty Pall is going to wind up pretty happy with Frank and Isobel joining the family. And I suspect even Gerald will turn out ok. The question is – what can follow the last of the Pallisers?\n\nUncivil Seasons – Michael Malone. As a fill in re-read, but damn, I’d forgotten how good Malone is. Probably because I found his last novel, The Four Corners of the Sky, very disappointing. Can’t go wrong with Justin and Cuddy, though.\n\nAngelmaker – Nick Harkaway.\n\nThe Lottery – Shirley Jackson. Book of short stories, and good lord that woman knows creepy.\n\nThe Evolution of Inanimate Objects – Harry Karlinsky.\n\n11/22/63 – AKA That Stephen King book that has an American style date as its title, making it impossible for me to remember. But I’m enjoying it, nonetheless. It seemed to take me an age to read this, and I put it down to the fact that I’m not all that interested in Kennedy’s assassination. So I enjoyed this for the writing and the sub-plots but in honesty I’d have preferred a novel about the town of Jodie, with Deke and Ellie, Jake/George and Sadie. I thought they were such great characters.\n\nFirst Lady – Michael Malone.\n\nTime’s Witness – Michael Malone.\n\nNights at the Circus – Angela Carter. For book club and about the first book I’ve read for it that I’ve liked. Fevvers is a great character, hatched not born, spinning her own fairy tales of which to be heroine, creating her own fate, child and maiden to Lizzie’s crone. A confidence trickster whose glory is renewed by its reflection from those around her.\n\nThe Sea, The Sea – Iris Murdoch. Another book club book. It’s been years since I read any Murdoch, and I like this so far. The narrator is such an awful, pompous ass I am really hoping he’ll get some kind of comeuppance.\n\nRaffles: The Amateur Cracksman – A.W.Hornung. Just dipped in again because I was in between books. Realised that there is something disturbingly amoral about Raffles, and for all he’s the gentleman thief, he’s not to be trusted an inch.\n\nThe Vows of Silence – Susan Hill. There were times when I almost didn’t want to keep reading, didn’t want to know about any more murders because the vignettes of the victims made them so real. They could have gone off to have novels of their own, so there’s a real sense of lives brutally cut short. In this one, a gunman is terrorising the women of Lafferton, while Simon is also dealing with a family tragedy. Again, Hill does that thing where she keeps her plot lines neatly balanced between the personal and the professional.\n\nThe Sense of an Ending – Julian Barnes.\n\nThe Snow Child – Eowyn Ivey. Marvellous sense of place, loved the retelling of the fairy story and enjoyed how the story balanced on the magical realism line.\n\nRiddley Walker – Russell Hoban.\n\nCrampton Hodnet – Barbara Pym. Quick re-read while wondering what to read next. I’d forgotten how funny it is, and how spot on about North Oxford.\n\nBone & Cane – David Belbin. Which was fine but I didn’t love it, and I didn’t really buy the relationship between Nick and Sarah. The whole early Blair thing was good but the sum of the novel wasn’t enough for me to want to read more. Can definitely see this as a TV series, though.\n\nThe Outcast – Sadie Jones. Large print, wide spaced on thick paper to bulk out the book, which if anything, could have done with being shorter. It was ok, but however relentlessly miserable you’ve got to read real 50s novels for the genuine sense of inescapable claustrophobia.\n\nThe Mystery of the Butcher’s Shop – Gladys Mitchell. I forced myself through this but didn’t like any of the characters (least of all Mrs Bradley) and the murder was entirely far-fetched. Mitchell goes on the pile of classic crime I don’t like, along with Ngaio Marsh.\n\nThe Lost Art of Keeping Secrets – Eva Rice. Galloped through this, all the while feeling as though I’d read it before. Mostly because it’s entirely derivative, so pretty much, I have. But there’s a host of books do the ‘quirky heroine comes of age in the 50s’ thing better and less forgettably.\n\nThe One You Really Want – Jill Mansell. Of the 5 books I read last week, this was the one I enjoyed most while I was reading. Mansell is becoming my default writer of chicklit. I’ve read 4 or 5 and they are reliably good, with real characters and just the right level of unbelievable romance about them. Pure froth, and that’s exactly what I needed.\n\nGaudy Night – DL Sayers. And yes, I have read this a bazillion times but it was one of those days when Peter Wimsey is exactly the right company. And I still envy Harriet her ivory chessmen and am gutted that they are trashed. Also, I play a secret game of measuring my literateness by the number of quotes I can recognise in a Wimsey novel. It is not many. I am not very literate. Sigh.\n\nThe Parasol Protectorate – Gail Carriger. This book was rubbish, but even more annoyingly it didn’t need to be quite so rubbish. If the author had canned the whole faux 19th century thing, it might have worked much better and I wouldn’t have been subjected to her leaden attempts at amusing, coy or, Gods help me, amusingly coy 19th century style prose. It’s as though she couldn’t bear to let go of the idea of the parasol, and then had to find an historical setting so she could include it. Other than that, werewolfy, vampirey nonsense, with a squabbling couple at the center who have all the emotional maturity of grapefruit.\n\nEvery Contact Leaves a Trace – Elanor Dymott. I thought this was great. Richard’s wife, Rachel, is brutally murdered one night when they’re visiting their old Oxford college. The novel is both Richard’s attempts to find out what happened, and also to come to terms with it. It’s told in a mostly first person narrative, in long sentences, with a seeming rambling structure that actually holds together very well. Stories unfold, loop round on each other, intertwine and meander quite definitely to their end point.\n\nBusman’s Honeymoon – DL Sayers. Well, obviously, having just re-read Gaudy Night!\n\nUnseen Academicals – Terry Pratchett. Gosh, it’s been ages since I read a Pratchett. There was a time when I was a regular but I gave up around Moving Pictures, I think. So I borrowed this from a friend on a whim, and it was delightful. I’d forgotten that TP is just downright good with words, and wordplay. More Pratchett, please!\n\nRivers of London – Ben Aaronivich. A detective story with a bit of magic to it, you say? Oh, go on then. Peter Grant, just off being a probationary constable and therefore lowest of the low in the Met, is standing watch over a murder scene in Covent Garden one night when he sees a ghost. Who witnessed the murder. Cue a fair amount of supernatural activity + regular policing and all put together reasonably well. Plus, one of the heroes got seriously hurt in a not-the-usual-plot-direction kind of way, and when authors are willing to do that to their main characters they’re usually going to do other interesting stuff as well.\n\nMoon over Soho – Ben Aaronovitch. So that was enough to make me read book 2 in the series (of course it’s a series), in which it turns out that something is feeding off jazz musicians in Soho and in which the evil magician who may be the Big Baddy for some novels to come is introduced.\n\nThe Pledge – Friedrich Durranmatt.\n\nPilcrow – Adam Mars-Jones. Which I found out about here: http://dovegreyreader.typepad.com/dovegreyreader_scribbles/2012/03/-pilcrow-adam-mars-jones.html, and then @john_self chimed in, so that was that. It was terrific, such a solid and sustained piece of writing that I have to keep reminding myself it’s fiction. I’ve read less convincing autiobiographies. You’d think that a book that started with its protagonist, John Cromer, on complete bed rest for a couple of years would be dull, and yet I found it a page turner from the start. The best news is, there are two more volumes to come.\n\nSword of Honour – Evelyn Waugh. I have the all-in-one Penguin Classic hardback edition, so it’s difficult for me to tell where the breaks in the trilogy are. I’m just reading the whole thing straight through, and it’s a triumph of that sort of dark comedy, to which military bureaucracy lends itself so well and easily. And yet I can’t quite figure out Guy Crouchback, who is a thoroughly decent chap and at the same time, almost a "
