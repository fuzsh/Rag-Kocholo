After a weekend in Wiślica last year.\n\nOP pawian 220 | 24430\n\n6 Aug 2012 / #1574\n\nWarneńczyk!\n\nStill another one! :):):):)\n\njon357 73 | 22493\n\n6 Aug 2012 / #1575\n\nI dont think it's Władysław III, so that only leaves Waza. The costume looks the right period too.\n\nOP pawian 220 | 24430\n\n6 Aug 2012 / #1576\n\nYes. Number IV.\n\nBTW, where can you see them and others?\n\nWhat is interesting about it?\n\npolishmama 3 | 279\n\n8 Aug 2012 / #1577\n\nNo adult tooth sockets. Which is weird, btw.

Which is weird, btw\n\nThere's a display of skulls in the Museum at Płock - I wonder if that's one of them.\n\npolishmama 3 | 279\n\n8 Aug 2012 / #1579\n\nVery interesting. I guess that's a gene mutation?\n\nOP pawian 220 | 24430\n\n8 Aug 2012 / #1580\n\nNo adult tooth sockets.\n\nYes!\n\nThere's a display of skulls in the Museum at Płock - I wonder if that's one of them.\n\nNo, it`s Archeo Museum in Gdańsk. There are more deformated specimen.\n\nNext:What is it?\n\nboletus 30 | 1356\n\n10 Aug 2012 / #1581\n\nWhat is it?\n\nAre we now in National Museum in Gdańsk? They have some still life paintings over there: Jan Brueg(h)el the Younger, Joris van Son, Simon Luttichuys, Franciscus Gijsbrechts, Willem van Leen and Andreas (Andrzej) Stech.\n\nOP pawian 220 | 24430\n\n10 Aug 2012 / #1582\n\nAre we now in National Museum in Gdańsk?\n\nYou mean the pic above?\n\nNope.\n\nThey have some still life paintings over there: Jan Brueg(h)el the Younger, Joris van Son, Simon Luttichuys, Franciscus Gijsbrechts, Willem van Leen and Andreas (Andrzej) Stech.\n\nYes, I know, I saw them: But the object in the pic isn`t still life painting.\n\nCome on, you are playing with me. :):):):)\n\nBad boy.\n\nboletus 30 | 1356\n\n10 Aug 2012 / #1583\n\nNo, really. I am transfixed; I give up. :-)\n\nOP pawian 220 | 24430\n\n10 Aug 2012 / #1584\n\nLook closely. Surely it isn`t a painting! Can you see the reflection of the object in the background? What does it mean?\n\nLook closer. What is that object made of? What colours can you see? What do they remind you of?\n\nThink about it all.\n\nHint:\n\nGdańsk, Gdańsk, Gdańsk....... .\n\nPlease, don`t think I am playing with you. :):):):)\n\nboletus 30 | 1356\n\n10 Aug 2012 / #1585\n\nSo suppose this is a table decoration of some sort, sprayed in some silver and amber colours. That does not bring me any closer, because my head hurts, even though I have not a trace of hangover, a.k.a. kociokwik (catlike squeak). Good idea: I am going for a drink where nobody will torture me.\n\n:-)\n\nOP pawian 220 | 24430\n\n10 Aug 2012 / #1586\n\nsprayed in some silver and amber colours.\n\nYes!!!!!\n\nWhat do I mean????\n\n:):):):)\n\njon357 73 | 22493\n\n10 Aug 2012 / #1587\n\nHint:\n\nGdańsk, Gdańsk, Gdańsk....... .\n\nIt can't be amber and I've seen something very like it.
