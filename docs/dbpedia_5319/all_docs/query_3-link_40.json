        "text": "During the early 1650s in the Netherlands and other parts of northern Europe, trompe l'oeil paintings were sought after by collectors and princely patrons who admired the skill and sophistication of these \"praiseworthy deceptions\".1 As the audience for them grew, a number of different variants evolved, including cut-outs, letter boards and open or closed cupboards, such as the present work.\n\nHere we see a glass-windowed cupboard, its door ajar. Tucked behind a horizontal metal bar and into the wooden frame are various written and printed documents and writing implements, while dimly visible within are stacks of coins, eye glasses, sticks of sealing wax and a wooden box. On the door itself, at the very center of the composition, is a small sheaf of prints, stitched together in the upper margins. The etching on top -- the only one visible to the viewer -- is a small head of a man in profile based on a print by Jan Lievens,2 but Gijsbrechts has added his own signature underneath and the date 1665. To the left is a 1657 almanac from Liège, which partly obscures a newspaper with the headline \"Victor...\". This latter has been identified as referring to the English victory over the Dutch in the Battle of Lowestoft , June 1665.3 The other elements of the still life are more generic in nature and have not been linked to any known pamphlets or books.\n\nGijsbrechts painted very few cupboard still lifes. He was undoubtedly inspired by Hoogstraaten, who began painting similar wall cupboards with glass windows in the early 1650s. The present work and a painting of a closed cupboard in the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Rouen, both dated 1665, are the earliest known. Another closely related picture, dated 1666 was with Noortman Master Paintings, Maastricht.4 Unlike the later works that Gijsbrechts painted while in the service of the Danish King Frederick III, now in the Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen, which include small bronzes and other elements familiar to curiosity cabinets, these three works all feature more mundane elements. It is Gijsbrechts' masterful arrangement of these ordinary materials that attracts and excites us. Using the small etching as an anchor, he fans out the letters and pamphlets around it, curling the edges of the sheets and tilting them just out of the vertical plane so that they catch the light and our eye. Completing the circle at the bottom is a quill pen, whose shadow falls on the cabinet door, which appears to have just swung open."
