        "text": "COLNAGHI - one of the oldest commercial art galleries in the world and one of the leading galleries in Old Master paintings - is presenting Less is More: Redefining the Kunstkamer, a pop-up exhibition from April 19 to April 30, 2023. A temporary space will redefine the concept of Kunstkamer, which appeared in Flanders in the early 17th century, and contrasting with the aesthetic canons of today.\n\nTherefore, the exhibition will be hosted in an exceptional space in Brussels on rue Américaine, just in front of the Horta Museum. The minimalist architecture of the building will enable the viewer to take a fresh look at a concept that has evolved over the past 300 years.\n\nFrom richly ornated collectors cabinets to the simplicity of post-war void spaces, the exhibition aims to question the way our interaction with art and architecture is changing over time.\n\nThe exhibition will showcase a selection of the finest old and modern master works amongs which a masterpiece by the Antwerp baroque painter Cornelis Norbertus Gysbrechts After the Falcon hunt. His work is a perfect example of northern trompe l’oeil painting, illustrayting the rich iconography of Flemish kunstkamers. This remarkable large-scale painting will generously be loaneed by the Musée d'Ixelles for the exhibition and consequently highlighting the quality of the museum's art collection.\n\nThe gallery has branches in London, New York and Madrid, but none in Belgium yet. Still, COLNAGHI has strong ties with Belgium, both because of Belgium's rich art history and its many collectors and museums of ancient art. The decision to open a representative office in Brussels in 2022 leads to events and temporary shows like the one Colnaghi is presenting this Spring.\n\nCOLNAGHI Gallery\n\n​ Less is More: Redefining the Kunstkamer\n\n​ 19 April - 30 April 2023\n\n​ ​\n\n​ Location: ​\n\n​ New Hope Gallery\n\n​ 26 – 28, Rue Américaine\n\n​ 1060 Brussels\n\nArtists:\n\nThe exhibition will open for a Preview on Wednesday April 19. Please confirm your attendance to the preview via micha@clubparadis.be\n\nThe exhibition is generously supported by Banque Transatlantique Belgium.\n\nMore info via colnaghi.com\n\nPress contact\n\nMicha Pycke\n\n​ Club Paradis\n\n​micha@clubparadis.be\n\n​ +32 (0)486 680 070\n\nAbout COLNAGHI\n\nFounded in 1760, COLNAGHI is one of the oldest commercial art galleries in the world and one of the few to specialize in works of art from antiquity to the modern era.
