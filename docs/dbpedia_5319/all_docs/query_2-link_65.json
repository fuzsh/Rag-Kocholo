One of the boys sheds a tear as he rocks the baby’s cradle; the other plays marbles at the foot of a spiral staircase. In an open room leading off the landing a man in side-profile plays a recorder, right hand uppermost.\n\nYoung Man in a Study (1640–1650), oil on panel, 100 × 76 cm, Adriaen van Gaesbeeck (1621–1650). Amsterdam: Rijksmuseum. Ref. Website: gallica (2012, b&w); Website: Wikimedia Commons (2014, col.) A young lad strikes a pose in his father’s study which is lit by a large window. He leans on a table dangling one of his gloves by a finger – he seems to have lost the other one – holding a hat in against his hip with the other hand. On the table an open book leans against an up-turned lute, lying on a map with an inkwell and a slender recorder of alto or tenor size, the beak, window/labium and seven finger holes clearly visible, the lowermost offset, but the foot out of view behind the book. Behind the lute are a globe and a statue of Aphrodite without her nightie, but just managing to cover her nether parts modestly with a drape. A second globe, more books, a conch, and a roll of paper are on a high shelf and other books and maps are scattered about the room. In the background, a maid descends a spiral staircase carrying a file of papers. On a pillar supporting the stair hangs an oval portrait of a young girl holding a basket of fruit.\n\nJoannes [Jan] Galle – see Martin de Vos\n\nFlemish engraver, publisher and print dealer; although various engravings have been attributed to him, he was probably only their publisher; born and died Antwerp (1600–1676); son of Theodor Galle.\n\nFernando Gallego\n\nSpanish painter, generally regarded as Hispano-Flemish in style, worked throughout Castile and Extremadura, most notably in Ciudad Rodrigo, Plasencia, Toro, and Zamora; his paintings are confused with those of Francisco Gallego (possibly his older brother) with whom he shared a workshop; most of his output consists of small panels of religious scenes, often used to make up altarpieces, or retablos – a notable exception is Sky of Salamanca, located at the University of Salamanca, a vast ceiling mural which depicts astronomical scenes and constellations probably born in Salamanca (ca 1440), died 1507.\n\nCoronation of Mary (? 1480), Fernando Gallego (ca 1440–1507).

Beside him a putto (possibly his son, Orpheus) holds a cylindrical pipe, only the upper five finger holes of which are visible (the area where the embouchure hole of a flute or the window/labium of a recorder might be is covered by his hands). Orpheus father is usually said to be Oeagrus, a Thracian king, but, according to another account, it was the god Apollo. Similarly, his mother was Calliope (Muse of epic poetry) or a daughter of Pierus, son of Makednos. Apollo became fond of Orpheus and gave him a little golden lyre and taught him to play it; Orpheus’s mother taught him to make verses for singing.\n\nTwo Muses, fresco, Lattanzio Gambara (ca 1530–1574).

He worked as court musician to the Doge of Venice Andrea Gritti, to whom Fontegara is dedicated, but also as a member of an independent company of instrumentalists formed completely or in part by family members, as a virtuoso of the viola da gamba and lute engaged in the ridotti promoted by the noblemen and intellectuals of the city, and as a teacher of music. In addition to all this, he also successfully practised the art of painting. Ganassi was born in Fontego (1492) and died in ? Venice (after 1571).\n\nTitle page: La Fontegara (1535), woodcut, Silvestro Ganassi del Fontego (1492–p. 1653). Published by the author, Venice. Ref. Linde (1991: 49); Fraenkel (1968: pl. 10); Slim (1985: 405, fig. 6); Thomson & Rowland-Jones (1995: 121, fig. 29); Lyndon-Jones (1996: 18–28); Hijmans (1995: 223); Darmstädter & Brown (2006: 53, fig. 8); Website: Lute Iconography LI-661 (2023, b&w.) Shows three near-cylindrical recorders accompanying a singer, whilst a fourth recorder-player is unoccupied; three viols and a lute hang on the wall, and a cornetto and lysarden lie on the window-ledge in front of the music table. Interpreting these illustrations as Virdung/Agricola rather than Ganassi-bore, Rowland-Jones (1994, 1995) has argued that Ganassi’s high-note fingerings are most unlikely to have worked with recorders of the kind depicted in his book. However, Marvin (1978) presented an illustrated and detailed article on making recorders extrapolated from the Fontegara frontispiece, estimating measurements from other details depicted to produce an instrument that worked well with Ganassi’s fingerings. See Loretto (1995). Reiners (1997) has pointed out that certain makers marks are referred to by Ganassi; indeed three of these makers marks are clearly reproduced in Ganassi’s fingering charts. Of these, two are strikingly similar to those associated with the Schnitzer family (all born in Munich and mostly working in Nuremberg), and Rauch of Schrattenbach (a small town 10 miles S of Memmingen, SW of Munich) respectively. The third, a ‘B’, may refer to the Venetian Bassano family. However, none of the surviving recorders bearing these marks or attributed to these makers exhibit the range and fingering characteristics described by Ganassi. Lyndon-Jones (loc. cit.) has suggested that some or all the musicians depicted are members of the Bassano family.\n\nGaetano Gandolfi\n\nItalian painter, draughtsman, sculptor and etcher; a successful artist, whose oeuvre includes paintings, terracotta sculptures, etchings and a huge number of drawings; born S Matteo della Decima, near Bologna, (1734), died Bologna (1802); brother of Ubaldo Gandolfi (1728–1781).\n\nMarriage at Cana (1775), oil on canvas, 530 × 679 cm, Gaetano Gandolfi (1734–1802). Bolgona: Pinacoteca Nazionale. Ref. Anthony Rowland-Jones (pers. comm.); Website: Getty Images (2016, col.) This enormous work was originally painted for the the refectory of the convent of San Salvatore, Bologna. It occupied Gandolfi for some ten years and contains more that 40 figures situated in an elaborate architectural setting. The focus on the composition is the resplendent figure of Christ, whose gesture to the stewards across the table changes the water in the amphorae into wine. On a balcony above the feast, six musicians play harp, straight trumpet, syrinx, cornetto, cymbals and a duct flute with a beaked mouthpiece and window/labium area visible. There is possibly a single finger hole showing; the right hand is uppermost, but the hand and the rest of the instrument is obscured between the skirt of the woman player. The duct flute could be of tenor size; its head end is cylindrical and fairly wide.\n\nUbaldo Gandolfi\n\nItalian painter, draughtsman and sculptor; painted frescoes, altarpieces and mythological scenes; his vast output of drawings includes both religious and mythological subjects and studies from the nude model; born San Matteo della Decima, near Bologna (1728), died Ravenna (1781); brother of Gaetano Gandolfi (1734–1802).\n\nMercury Lulling Argus to Sleep, ca 1770–1775, oil on canvas, 218.4 × 136.9 cm, Ubaldo Gandolfi (1728–1781).

Commissioned to adorn the walls of the palace of the Marescalchi family in Bologna, this painting originally formed part of a series of six works illustrating classical myths, including the story of Jupiter and Io. Here, Mercury – wearing a winged helmet and ankle bracelets – lulls Argus to sleep by playing his small slender duct flute (flageolet or recorder – only the lower holes are visible before a slight bell flare and, since he is slightly turned away, his lips and the upper part of the instrument are not visible). In one of the companion paintings, Gandolfi represents the imminent dispatch of Argus with a touch of humor, as Mercury gestures for the viewer to be quiet so as not to wake the sleeping giant.\n\nMercury about to Behead Argus (ca 1770–1775), oil on canvas, 218.4 × 136.9 cm, Ubaldo Gandolfi (1728–1781).

A wild-eyed young woman with curly hair and wearing an elaborately embroidered gown plays a broadly conical duct flute. The beak and window/labium are clearly depicted, the player has two holes covered and another five open ones can be seen, so this is probably intended to represent a recorder. However, the little finger of the player’s lowermost (right) hand is held beneath the instrument in the many often adopted by flageolet players.

A tribute to Raphael. From the Church of Santa Maria Nuova di Ferrara, Rome. St Cecilia, holding an organetto, looks up at a heavenly choir which, unlike Raphael’s, is supported with instruments (lute, viol, psaltery). Her organ (about to be dropped, perhaps) rests at a precarious angle on a marble ledge, its pipes in clusters rather than in a row. At her feet on stony ground lie a tambourine (with jingles) with torn skin, the broken scroll of a viol, and two black cylindrical duct flutes (probably recorders) of alto size, the window/labium of one of which is just visible. The latter instrument has six finger holes in line and one little finger hole offset to the player’s right; the other has six finger holes visible after the point where the other instrument crosses it. Garofolo clearly understood Raphael’s symbolism of “marriage abjured and unconsummated”. St Anthony of Padua holds a palm frond and his book of psalms; St Anthony Abate holds a dolphin (instead of the usual pig, perhaps) and there is a bell at his feet.\n\nVirgin and Child in Glory (ca 1535), painting on wood, 39·4 × 26.0 cm, Il Garofalo (ca 1481–1559).

Around an elaborate balcony, putti musicians play ?bassoon, harp, violin, coiled horn, and cello. Scattered about are coiled horns, violin, timpani, cello, harp, harpischord, and four baroque recorders two of which are hanging upside down. This image seems to combine elements of King David (Plate 61/100) and King Ahaziah (Plate 46/100) from Historiae Biblicae Veteris et Novi Testamenti engraved and printed by the Klauber Bros (1748), a major resource and inspiration to many of the artists in colonial South America.\n\nBernardino Gatti (il Sojaro)\n\nItalian painter whose style was strongly influenced by Correggio although it was blended with Lombard archaisms; he later refined his style to achieve a somewhat weak sentimentality; born Pavia (ca 1495), died Cremona (1576).\n\nThe Ascension of Christ (1549), fresco, Bernardino Gatti (1495–1576). Cremona: Chiesa di San Sigismondo, ceiling. Ref. Marconi, Cenova: postcard (col.); Anthony Rowland-Jones (pers. comm.) Christ is lifted up to heaven surrounded by a host of cherubim in the shape of a mandorla in the midst of a cloud on which angels are seated and winged putti gambol. One of the angels at the top right of the panel plays lute; at the top left of the panel another angel musician plays psaltery (in the shape of a figure eight), and two more hold cylindrical pipes with slightly flared bells. One of the latter has what appears to be a window/labium and is thus probably a duct flute. The upper part of the second pipe is hidden from view. Below, on earth, the apostles (11 at this stage) gaze up in awe at the departing figure or kneel in prayer.\n\nPaul Gauguin\n\nFrench painter, print-maker, sculptor and ceramicist; his style developed from Impressionism through a brief cloisonnist phase towards a highly personal brand of Symbolism, which sought to combine and contrast an idealized vision of primitive Polynesian culture with the sceptical pessimism of an educated European; his use of non-naturalistic colour and formal distortion for expressive ends was widely influential on early 20th-century avant-garde artists; born Paris (1848), died Atuona, Marquesas Islands (1903).\n\nThe Flageolet Player on the Cliff (1889), oil on canvas, 73 × 92 cm, Paul Gauguin (1848–1903). Indianapolis: Indianapolis Museum of Art, Inv. 1998.168. “In October 1889, Gauguin left Pont-Aven, the artists’ colony in Brittany where he had developed his revolutionary approach to painting, in favor of the more remote village of Le Pouldu. There he painted this panoramic view of the rugged Atlantic shoreline. The canvas is a powerful application of his ideals, particularly the assertion that the artist should reinterpret nature according to his own imagination. With his bold pairings of near and far, steep and flat, Gauguin merged distant beaches and craggy cliffs into a nearly abstract surface pattern. The image, however, is based upon details of the actual site. Period photographs show that the waves at the upper left do meet the beach in a broad arc, and Gauguin wrote that the sands of Le Pouldu looked rose, not yellow. At the right is a girl with her scythe and a boy playing a Breton instrument known as a flageolet, or flute” (Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection, 2005). Actually, the instrument has a distinctly flared bell and a pirouette and reed and is far more likely to represent a Breton bombarde, an instrument related to the oboe (NSL).\n\nGiovanni Battista Gaulli [called il Baciccio, Baciccia]\n\nItalian painter; a celebrated artist of the Roman High Baroque; his frescoes, altarpieces, mythological scenes and portraits are distinguished by the warm, glowing colour that reveals his Genoese origins; born Gênes (1639), died Rome (1709).\n\nBacchanal, drawing in ink and pencil on plain and coloured paper, 25.1 × 29.4 cm, Giovanni Battista Gaulli (1639–1709).

Commissioned by the wife of James Duke of York (later King James II) for the private chapel in St James’ Palace, London. The picture shows Joseph lifting Jesus to feed at Mary’s breast. Above, an angel choir with two singing, sharing a book, one playing a violin, and another playing an alto-size pipe which touches his lips, but is held obliquely, perhaps to enable him to look down at the Holy Family. the pipe, which shows no sings of a window/labium (or the embouchure hole of a flute) is slender and very slightly conical to a stronger bell flare which reveals a wide bore opening. But the mouthpiece end is slightly beaked. The angel has his right hand lowermost. Above the left hand two finger holes are visible and also perhaps two more beneath the right hand, one of which is offset. Bearing in mind the date, place and subject, the artist might have had a recorder in mind rather than flute or flageolet.

In 1699/1700 Wren completed the new King’s Apartments for William III, and called in Grinling Gibbons for wood-carving work, including the fireplace surround in what has now been called “The Music Room”. At the upper left of the surround is an exquisitely carved trophy crossing an oboe and a recorder. The latter is pure Hotteterre with the slightly curved-over beak. The wood is not lime (Gibbons’ usual and favourite) probably because that was too delicate near the fire and at waist level, but was originally lime-washed to give a lime-wood effect. In the recent restorations the ugly lime was removed revealing what might be dark oak. The recorder is shown side-on, therefore no finger holes are visible.

One of Gibbons’s most elegant compositions. The fire surround would have been in carved stone or marble and the cherub probably in limewood; the glass or porcelain vases would have been real examples and the drapery would probably have been trompe l’oeil carving, again in limewood.

Along the length of the painting are several groups of angel musicians. Near the centre an angel holds a bass recorder. The bocal and window/labium are very clear. The player has the first two fingers of his left hand on the body of the instrument, but two fingers are beneath. Below that there are three quite widely-spaced finger holes, followed by the right hand with the first finger presumably on a hole. The other fingers of the right hand point downwards, but the rest of the instrument is hidden in a Baroque cloud.” At the North (far) end a rather feminine looking angel, without wings, holds another bass recorder with a strongly S-shaped bocal, and the window/labium quite near the cap at the top of the instrument. The player has her left hand against the side of the body of the instrument, with the first finger extending towards the window/labium. Two finger holes are then visible lower down, before the edge of a balcony and another Baroque cloud cut off the rest of the instrument.”Another group close to the centre of the composition includes a flying angel in red playing a lute, with another winged angel behind playing a recorder of alto size. The right hand is upper, and all the fingers except the first of the right hand are down, presumably covering holes. The lower part of the body and the bell end are then visible. There is a further bass recorder, again with a strongly curved bocal, with the player’s left hand close to the window/labium. The upper central part of the body is hidden, but five finger holes are shown before the player’s lower right hand. The end is unflared, with a very clear bore opening. Bass recorders often look like dulcians, but I believe that these are all clear examples of recorders.”On a balcony at centre side of the composition a small angel plays a pipe, but with insufficient details for recognition” (Rowland-Jones, loc. cit.)\n\nFour Women Making Music, oil on canvas, 57.2 × 101.6 cm, Luca Giordano (1632–1705).

Detail. Baltimore: Walters Art Museum, 37.261. Three wise men, or magi, from the East are described in the Gospels as having seen a new star and journeyed to pay tribute to the child marked as divine by the heavens. The wise men were often depicted as kings, and, by the Renaissance, the youngest was frequently depicted as an African, here holding a gold vessel containing myrrh, a precious resin from Arabia and Africa used for perfume. His portrayal reflects both the ethnic diversity encountered by Renaissance painters in a port like Venice, frequented by African traders, and also the concept of Christ’s promise of salvation for all people. The splendor of the kings contrasts with the simplicity of the Holy Family. Winged putti sing the words inscribed on the scroll “Glory to God in Heaven and Peace to Men on Earth,” accompanied by others playing rebec and two flared-bell pipes, possibly recorders.\n\nCornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts = Cornelis Norbertus Gysbrechts\n\nNicolaes de Giselaer\n\nDutch artist; born Dordrecht (1583), died ?

Miller Collection, 0073/V; London, British Museum, Inv. 1855,0609.359. Ref. Advertisement for Sydney Society of Recorder Players (ca 1975); Lancaster (2007: 22, fig.) A melancholy young man holds a cylindrical soprano recorder, right hand uppermost. His torso is turned to the right, but he gazes directly at the viewer. His expression seems mournful or melancholy. His eyes are large, his hair is long, and the light coming from the right creates strong light and dark contrasts in his face, hair, and hands. From a three-volume folio of etchings and engravings after paintings in the collection in the Palais Royal of the Duc d’Orleans, the cousin of Louis XVI, who was guillotined in 1793. The collection was dispersed in 1798, at which time the painting was thought to have been by Caravaggio. Although the original painting on which the Miller print was based has yet to be traced, the etching is somewhat reminiscent of an anonymous painting entitled Boy with a Flageolet in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (Accn. WA1851.12), now thought to be by a Northern Italian artist but formerly attributed to Caravaggio, amongst others. However, the boy in the painting wears a hat and different clothing; his face is angled slightly differently, and he does not look directly at the viewer as does the boy in the print. The fingers on the upper hand are also placed slightly differently.\n\nJohannes [or Jan] ‘Polidoro’ [Polidor, Polidoor or Polydore] Glauber\n\nDutch painter, draughtsman and print-maker of German descent; copied Italian paintings for the Amsterdam art dealer Gerrit Uylenburgh; travelled extensively in Italy where he became a member of the third generation of Dutch Italianates in Rome, receiving the nickname ‘Polidor’ in recognition of his artistic debt to the landscapes of Polidoro da Caravaggio; born Utrecht (1646), died Schoonhoven, near Gouda (1726).\n\nLandscape with Shepherd and Flute Player, oil on canvas, 195 × 249 cm, Johannes Glauber (1646–1726).

Beside a rough road leading through a clearing amongst wooded hills a young man plays to his girlfriend on his pipe, probably a duct flute (possibly a recorder). On the hillside opposite sits a shepherd minding his flock. Along the path walks a young woman carrying a bundle on her head.

Anthony Rowland-Jones (pers. comm., 2001). “Most of the picture is of craggy mountains, but there is one flat area, a green meadow by a torrent, where a shepherd with six sheep, sits piping on what is probably a duct flute. The position is alright for a recorder – no puffed cheeks, left-hand lower near the bell; and the instrument seems to be of alto size” (Rowland-Jones, loc. cit.)\n\nThe Invention of Music (ca 1820–1825), etching & engraving, 23.0 × 15.2 cm, Samuel Amsler after Johannes Glauber (1646–1726).

Beside a hut in the forest a bare-chested young man playing slender pipe (possibly a duct flute) is embraced by his plump female companion who wears nothing but a very short skirt. She points to a bird on a tree-branch above her. Between them, an infant sleeps in a rustic cradle.

Schnifis was an eminent late baroque preacher, lyric poet and storyteller who wrote religious works in the tradition of baroque emblematic literature and pastoral romances, influenced by popular literature. In this illustration, Christ hangs on the cross (made from an upside-down anchor) at the prow of a boat with female passenger sitting aft. In the distance a city burns. In the foreground a shepherd with his dog and sheep sits beneath a tree playing a duct flute with quite enough finger holes to represent a recorder. He has a second pipe beside him.

Watched by Io (as a heifer), Argus is lulled asleep by Mercury who plays a flared-bell pipe. Although no beak or window/labium can be seen, three fingers of the player’s top (right) hand and all four of the lower hand cover their holes, indicating that the instrument might represent a recorder.\n\nImero Gobbato\n\nContemporary Italian-born neo-impressionistic painter, etcher, engraver, book illustrator, yacht designer, musician (piano, guitar, violin, accordion and recorder); lived and worked in Argentina, Guatemala, Italy, Florida, California, Connecticut and finally in Camden, Maine (USA) where he remained from 1965; born Milan (1923); died Penobscot Bay (2010).\n\nBeany and his New Recorder by Carol Panter, Four Winds, New York (1972) – an illustrated children’s story in which the recorder figures prominently:\n\nDust jacket, coloured print, Imero Gobbato (1923–2010). In a forest, beside a stream, Beany sits playing his recorder to his cat, Pomponio\n\nFrontispiece, coloured print, Imero Gobbato (1923–2010). A bass viol leans against a chair on which lies an alto-sized neo-baroque recorder. Scattered around the chair are an instrument case, a tambourine, a psaltery and some sheet music. Behind the viol is a music stand from which a triangle is suspended.\n\nPage 13, b&w print, Imero Gobbato (1923–2010). As Beany Parker practices in the laundry his father interrupts him to compliment him on his recorder playing and offers to buy him a better instrument. Meanwhile, the family cat, Pomponino, climbs in and out of pile of folded ironing.\n\nPage ?, b&w print, Beany pensively holds his new recorder in his right hand while looking for “one of his favorite places to sit, a smooth flat rock that jutted out of the trees.” Beany recognizes that this “fine forest seat for a boy and a cat ” would enhance his practice sessions and nurture his musical abilities. The cat is walking across the rock, his tail held high.\n\nPages 20–21, b&w print, Imero Gobbato (1923–2010). The Parker family play some music by Handel on harpsichord, viol and two recorders. Their cat, Pomponino dozes underneath the harpsichord: “The music of Handel made him yawn.”\n\nPages 30–31, coloured print, Imero Gobbato (1923–2010). Underneath a spreading tree in the forest, Beany plays music by Bach on his recorder in an attempt to get a bird to join in. Perhaps the presence of Pompanino, the family cat, sitting beside Beany has something to do with it.\n\nPages 32–33, coloured print, Imero Gobbato (1923–2010). During some family music-making after dinner, it dawns on Beany that Pompanino the cat might indeed be the reason that the forest birds are not responding to his recorder playing. We see Beany holding his recorder, his father with a viol, and his brother at the harpsichord.\n\nPages 38–39, coloured print, Imero Gobbato (1923–2010). Beany sits comfortably on his rock in the forest and plays some Scarlatti which frightens Pompanino away. Perhaps this time there will be bird-song.\n\nTom Godin\n\nContemporary Canadian artist.

Two shepherds run towards the crib, falling over each other in their haste. Behind them a shepherd claps his hands to accompany his companion who plays on a small flared-bell recorder with what appears to be a metal-sheathed beak.

Then under this and being part of the main picture on the right-hand side are an ass and an ox, and an aged shepherd in a red robe praying at the crib. On the lower left side are two praying winged putti, and above them two shepherds, the younger praying, the older one with his right arm round his companion’s shoulder holding a shepherd’s hat. Stuck into the hat the upper part of a pipe protrudes, distinguishable only by the recorder-like shape of the mouth-piece end (no finger holes are visible).

London: Royal Academy of Music, Inv. 2003.2578. In this musical family scene, a popular subject for Dutch artists, a female lutenist and male violinist accompany three singers, a young man, woman and a child. The young man holds a recorder, with which he is beating time, whilst helping the child by pointing to the music. A feathered hat and glove lie centrally next to an inkwell and quill. The contemporary clothing and setting are opulent, conveying the family’s wealth. The violinist, who positions his instrument against his breast, is wearing a rapier. His informal pose is also interesting, with his left knee resting on a chair. The image is one of overall harmony – between the pair on the left, and of the family on the right, as well as the sweet harmony between the stringed instruments – the lute and the violin. The beating of time reflects temperance and virtue, as does the obedience of the child within the family, and the importance of education.\n\nChris Gollon\n\nContemporary English artist whose works range from classic surrealism to his own concepts in cubism; other influences include the German painters of the twenties and thirties as well as an interest in film, especially the work of Italian film director, Federico Fellini; born London (1953).
