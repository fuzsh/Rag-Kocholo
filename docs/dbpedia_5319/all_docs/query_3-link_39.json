Koester, Illusions: Gijsbrechts, Royal Master of Deception, exhibition catalogue Copenhagen, 1999, p. 152, reproduced.\n\nNOTE: During the early 1650s in the Netherlands and other parts of northern Europe, trompe l'oeil paintings were sought after by collectors and princely patrons who admired the skill and sophistication of these \"praiseworthy deceptions\".1 As the audience for them grew, a number of different variants evolved, including cut-outs, letter boards and open or closed cupboards, such as the present work.\n\nHere we see a glass-windowed cupboard, its door ajar. Tucked behind a horizontal metal bar and into the wooden frame are various written and printed documents and writing implements, while dimly visible within are stacks of coins, eye glasses, sticks of sealing wax and a wooden box. On the door itself, at the very center of the composition, is a small sheaf of prints, stitched together in the upper margins. The etching on top -- the only one visible to the viewer -- is a small head of a man in profile based on a print by Jan Lievens,2 but Gijsbrechts has added his own signature underneath and the date 1665. To the left is a 1657 almanac from Liège, which partly obscures a newspaper with the headline \"Victor...\". This latter has been identified as referring to the English victory over the Dutch in the Battle of Lowestoft , June 1665.3 The other elements of the still life are more generic in nature and have not been linked to any known pamphlets or books.\n\nGijsbrechts painted very few cupboard still lifes. He was undoubtedly inspired by Hoogstraaten, who began painting similar wall cupboards with glass windows in the early 1650s. The present work and a painting of a closed cupboard in the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Rouen, both dated 1665, are the earliest known. Another closely related picture, dated 1666 was with Noortman Master Paintings, Maastricht.4 Unlike the later works that Gijsbrechts painted while in the service of the Danish King Frederick III, now in the Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen, which include small bronzes and other elements familiar to curiosity cabinets, these three works all feature more mundane elements. It is Gijsbrechts' masterful arrangement of these ordinary materials that attracts and excites us. Using the small etching as an anchor, he fans out the letters and pamphlets around it, curling the edges of the sheets and tilting them just out of the vertical plane so that they catch the light and our eye. Completing the circle at the bottom is a quill pen, whose shadow falls on the cabinet door, which appears to have just swung open.\n\n1. C.

He moved to London in 1693 and had a prolific career there as a painter of vanitas and trompe l'oeil still lifes. These witty and highly decorative works, which were incredibly popular during the late 17th and 18th centuries, have found favor with collectors and connoisseurs in the present day due to their ability to blend reality with deception and their unique resolution to the question at the heart of painting's practice for centuries: how to depict the three-dimensional world on a two-dimensional surface.\n\nThe theme of the letter rack seems to have preoccupied Collier during his years in London; we know many examples of these works today – all dated 1693 and later – which can be generally divided into two groups: those with plain, dark, monochromatic backgrounds as seen in the present work, and those with faux bois backgrounds, as in the work sold New York, Sotheby's 28 January 2010, lot 262. Although all of the letter rack works in Collier's oeuvre are composed differently, they do tend to feature similar objects. Indeed, almost every object in the present work reappears elsewhere in other works by the artist. Particularly characteristic are the inclusion of the Apollo Anglicanus Almanac, which the artist often uses to date his works (here, 1698); the folded and dog-eared copy of the London Gazette; a royal speech before parliament (here by King William); and the hand-written \"Memory\" pad. Also typical is the way in which Collier has signed the work: on a letter tucked into the rack addressed to \"Mr. E. Collier Painter att. London\". During his time in London, Collier used both the Dutch and English versions of his signature interchangeably; thus, he was sometimes Edwaert or Edwaerd, other times Edward; sometimes Painter at London, others Schilder tot Leyden. A master of the trompe l'oeil genre, Collier's genius lay in his ability to make his carefully arranged and remarkably naturalistic works appear effortless, random and uncomposed.\n\nWe are grateful to Dr. Dror Wahrman for his assistance in cataloguing the present lot.\n\nFrench School, 19th Century, Trompe l'Oeil of a Barber's Cabinet. photo Sotheby's\n\noil on canvas, 25 3/8 by 21 3/8 in.; 64.5 by 54.3 cm.
