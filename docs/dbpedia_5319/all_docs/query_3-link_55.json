        "text": "The article gives an interdisciplinary overview of the rise of interest in the Orient and the changing interpretation of oriental figures in 16th–19th century Western European arts and popular culture. The iconography of the image of Turks is highlighted. The paper presents a broad outline of the emergence of one the most powerful iconic topoi of orientalism: the figure of oriental women, the so-called ’odalisque’, as represented in the european “visual environment” in the 16–19th centuries. Interplay between narrative and visual stereotypes is to be interpreted alongside the changing concept of orient through visual conventions. At the end of the paper, an actual ethnographic example is disscussed. Ethnographers who do fieldwork in the countryside of Transylvania encounter visual representations of oriental female figures on various media, such as prints, paintings, carpets in the homes of rural people. Kitschy harem scenes with reclining, dancing or bathing female figures are still surprisingly popular. in country fairs, machine-woven, fake-silk carpets with oriental themes can be bought new or used as well as framed pictures at junk or “antique” dealers. There is a surprising steadiness in the popularity of representations with oriental motifs. The author examines the origin of this long-standing popular interest and the obsession of people with the exoticism of oriental images.\n\nThis essay provides a comprehensive survey of the history of collecting early Sienese paintings (and early Italian paintings) in Hungary. It first discusses the history and character of the private collections of Johann Anton Ramboux (1790–1866), Arnold Ipolyi (1823–1886) and Raffaelle Bertinelli (1802–1878) that formed the basis of the later public collections. This is followed by an overview of the history of the two major public collections of early Italian art: the Museum of Fine Arts (Szépművészeti Múzeum) in Budapest and the Christian Museum (Keresztény Múzeum) in Esztergom. Particular emphasis is laid on the history of the paintings themselves: the circumstances of their acquisition, sale, transport, conservation, storage, and exhibition, and the history of their scholarly study and reception by the public.\n\nThe Uffizi Gallery in Florence holds the oldest, largest and most famous collection of self-portraits in the world: artworks by great artists of Europe and beyond, from Raphael to the present. Hungarian art is represented by 21 painters and 24 self-portraits. The earliest Hungarian self-portrait to be included in the collection (1872) is by Károly Markó, an artist who settled in Florence, and the latest is by László Lakner. Many factors have influenced the development of the collection – personal ambition, the art market and sometimes historic events. As a result, the pictures reflect a wide variety of styles, schools of painting and artistic viewpoints. Nearly every painting has found a different route to the Uffizi, and all have their own story to tell. What they all have in common is inherent in the self-portrait art form: the desire for recognition, reputation and immortality. So it is perhaps not surprising that most (20) of the Hungarian portraits have been donated to the gallery. Five of these were offered directly by the artists. The Hungarian self-portraits are very varied in terms of both the painters and their pictures. The painters include such towering figures of Hungarian art as Pál Szinyei Merse and József Rippl-Rónai, together with others whose names might not be so familiar. Although the paintings do not reflect the whole history of two centuries of Hungarian painting, they reveal how a museum collection is built up over a long time through a mixture of carefully-weighed decisions and surprising coincidences. Some artists were requested by the museum to send in their self-portraits, others offered up their portraits of their own accord. The Uffizi purchased some of the pictures, and others went to Florence through a collaboration between the gallery and the Hungarian National Gallery. There are some surprises among names in every group: the history of the pictures betray the relativity and variability of artistic reputation."
