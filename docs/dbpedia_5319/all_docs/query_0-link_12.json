(plate 6). Theatricality in Early Modern Art and Architecture Edited by Caroline van Eck and Stijn Bussels © 2011 Association of Art Historians.\n\nFrom its earliest beginnings, the theatre has borrowed elements from architecture, painting and other visual arts to stage and perform plays, ranging from the primitive wooden scaffoldings used in Athens in the fifth century BCE to perform Bacchic plays to the elaborate perspectival backdrops with their suggestion of infinite space developed in the eighteenth century by the Galli-Bibbiena family. Conversely, the arts have depicted theatrical actions such as the lifting of a curtain to stage what is represented in a painting, and imported gestures, costumes or entire stagings of a scene from the theatre.Venetian painting offers some of the best-known cases, for instance in Veronese’s use of Palladian architectural backdrops for his large Biblical scenes. His Feast in the House of Levi, painted in 1573 (plate 2) was described by Carlo Ridolfi in the seventeenth century as a ‘maestoso Teatro’, and in the nineteenth century the painter was still praised as a superb stage manager; Ridolfi also described the action of Titian’s Crowning with Thorns as taking place in a theatre.1 But already in the sixteenth-century plays and joyous entries in Flanders drew on famous paintings such as Jan van Eyck’s Lamb of God (1425–29) to provide a compositional framework for their staging of tableaux vivants. Such relatively straightforward cases of exchange and borrowing are well documented and the questions they have raised are mainly those of influence or adaptation of originals to new uses in a different medium. But the inclusion of theatrical elements in a work of art is rarely simply a matter of borrowing a costume, gesture or compositional feature. Even in Veronese’s Feast in the House of Levi the use of a stage, which at first sight seems to be a straightforward case of a painter employing a theatrical feature, fundamentally affects both the composition of the painting and the way it is viewed. The composition of Veronese’s paintings depicting feasts, weddings or the Last Supper use architectonic backdrops that are very close to reconstructions by Serlio and Palladio of Roman theatrical backdrops as described by Vitruvius (plate 2).2 These are not representations of actual buildings or urban spaces, because they cannot be reconstructed as such, but illusionist stage settings; they signal that the viewer is looking at the enactment of some drama.3 At the same time they are not simply dramatic scenes represented as if on stage: Veronese handled the sacred and the secular, the elevated and the mundane, in a subtle way that could not have been achieved on a real stage. In the Feast in the House of Levi there is no central, unified linear perspective; instead each zone of the painting obeys a different visual order, probably because a unified perspectival system imposed on such a vast scene would look very unnatural. The receding orthogonals are broken, 9\n\nThe Visual Arts and the Theatre in Early Modern Europe\n\n1 Sebastiano Serlio, Design for the scenery of a comedy, from Sebastiano Serlio, Libro I-VI d’architettura, Vicenza: Jac. de’Franceschi, 1584, f. 45v. Photo: Leiden University.\n\nwhich prevents the composition from being taken in at one glance; only once all parts of the scene depicted have been absorbed can the spectator form an idea of the composition as a whole. Thus the spatial, two-dimensional, pictorial representation of an event is transformed into a narrative unfolding in the spectator’s act of looking. The Feast in the House of Levi thus points to one important implication of the use of theatrical elements in a work of art: the use of a stage signals to the viewer that he or she should look at what is represented as a viewer of a play, that is, as somebody who watches the unfolding of a play in the course of an evening. It does not show the events it depicts as static, frozen in the eternal present of historia sacra in the way many late medieval crucifixions, pietàs or annunciations do, but as a narrative. Depicting a situation or event as if it takes place on a stage also stages the way the viewer looks at it. Introducing the visual arts in a theatrical performance is not a mere matter of mixing media or genres either. In the final scene of the opera La Torilda, first performed in Venice in 1648, the legendary musician Amphyon appears in a loggia near a marina, decorated with statues. He enters the stage riding a dolphin, singing praises to the goddess Venus and of love’s power to set stones afire. The statues in the loggia are brought to life by Amphyon’s song, and the work is concluded with a ballo delle statue – a dance of the statues. Thus, in an operatic realm in which everyday speech is elevated to song, statues express their inherent theatricality through the most sophisticated language of the body – dance. This example points to 10\n\nCaroline van Eck and Stijn Bussels\n\n2 Paolo Veronese, The Feast in the House of Levi, 1573. Oil on canvas, 555 × 1280 cm.Venice: Gallerie dell’Accademia. Photo: CKD Nijmegen.\n\ntwo recurring features of exchanges between the theatre and the arts: they undermine established distinctions between the arts, and they suggest transgressions of the boundaries between representation and presence. The inanimate statues in La Torilda become living beings, and their immobility is transformed into song. In Venetian early modern opera statues could become living and moving actors on the stage; but in the courtly theatres built in Florence, Parma and Vicenza in the sixteenth century, statues of rulers were placed in the theatrical space to observe both the play and the audience. In the Farnese theatre in Parma an equestrian statue of the prince was installed in the theatre. In Sabbioneta a statue of the emperor Vespasian was positioned directly behind the seat of the Gonzaga ruler who shared his name with the emperor, as a visual reminder of the model the prince claimed – or was expected – to follow. But sometimes the prince himself became a theatre, a place to view the enactment of princely virtue, as the dedication of the treatise by the architect Giovanni Battista Aleotti bears out: ‘As is well known,Your Highness is a living theatre’, he wrote to his patron Ranuccio I of Parma, ‘in whom all heroic virtues represent magnanimous and generous actions’.4 For human beings, being theatrical in this context meant literally that they were a theatre, a place where their character was on display for all to see. These examples all suggest that exchanges and borrowings between the visual arts and the theatre are not simply a matter of exchanges of media or genres. They affect the way a play, painting or statue is viewed, the relations between the media, genres and arts involved, and the characters on stage or represented in painting or sculpture. They raise questions about the ways genres are demarcated and defined, the relations between media, the way plays and art works are viewed, and ultimately the relation between representation and presence. The relations between the theatre and the visual arts have been studied mainly in two ways, one concentrating on the actual relations between these arts, the other taking its departure in the concept of theatricality. Inspired by the topos of the theatrum mundi and the paragone, the first, more historically oriented approach, has rarely moved beyond documenting and studying individual cases of the use of theatrical elements 11\n\nThe Visual Arts and the Theatre in Early Modern Europe\n\nin the arts. Architectural history illustrates this well: whereas it is acknowedged that there exist unmistakable connections between the work of Veronese and Tintoretto and the architectural designs of Peruzzi, Serlio and Palladio; between French eighteenth-century public architecture and the theatre; or between the stage designs of the Galli-Bibbiena and the etchings of Piranesi, research has rarely moved beyond documenting these similarities.5 Theatricality is a concept with many meanings; ambiguity is a constant feature of its use. On one side of its semantic spectrum it simply refers to anything pertaining to the theatre, from the props to the script; at the other extreme it is a heavily laden ethical and political term. Prior to the second century AD, the Greek thea (derived from the verb theaomai, to gaze with admiration or bewilderment, or to contemplate) and its cognate theatron were used to identify the distinctive visual characteristics of the theatre. Thea refers to the act of seeing something, including the act of seeing involved in attending a spectacle or performance, but also to contemplation (hence our term ‘theory’).6 The word was also used to name the actual spectacle or performance itself, whether staged in the theatre or elsewhere, and also the place from which a spectacle or performance is seen, such as a seat in the theatre or even the auditorium in general. From the second century AD, however, words derived from thea start to be used not only to point to the visual characteristics of the theatre, but also to refer to exaggeration, distortion and deceit. In his Anthologies, the Hellenistic astrologer Vettius Valens (c. 120–c. 175 AD) uses the term theatrodes pejoratively for persons of exaggerated behaviour (14.27).7 This negative understanding of the theatre has a long history. Ultimately it goes back to Plato’s famous anti-theatrical, or rather, anti-mimetic, arguments in the tenth book of the Republic. Plato attacked what he saw as the theatre’s distortion of reality. One of the greatest dangers of the theatre was that the audience might mistake the fictitious world of the tragedy for the truth. All artistic mimesis, but certainly the mimesis of tragedy, is for Plato, ‘a corruption of the mind of all listeners who do not possess as antidote a knowledge of its real nature’ (Republic 595B).8 The excesses shown on stage habituate the audience to them, and therefore affect the norms and values of the polis. Moreover, the audience is not conscious that their understanding is distorted. Its modes of evaluation and analysis militate against genuine philosophical understanding. The term theatricality is first documented in English in 1711, and in French somewhat later. From its introduction, it did not refer to such exchanges in a neutral way, but had clear moral connotations. In his instructions to the painter, published in 1711 in Characteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions,Times, Shaftesbury prescribes that he should start from observations when the subject is behaving in a natural way and thus not playing a social role: Such study’d Action, and artificial Gesture, may be allow’d to the Actors and Actrices of the Stage. But the good Painter must come a little nearer to Truth, and take care that his Action be not theatrical.9 In French, the term théâtral was used in the early modern period to name situations or objects directly related to the theatre. At the end of the seventeenth century it came to be connected with the exaggeration and affectation attributed to the theatre, and used in the sense of ‘amplifié, exagéré, comme ce qui se fait au théâtre’, the opposite of natural social interaction.10 Just as in the passage by Lord Shaftesbury quoted above, theatricality becomes associated with everything unreal and unnatural, with conscious deceit, not only of the audience in the theatre but of society at large, 12\n\nCaroline van Eck and Stijn Bussels\n\nand even with a loss of self. In his Lettre à M. D’Alembert of 1758, Rousseau made the influential argument that the middle classes and courtiers function as actors: they play a social role which they hope will promote their interests. However, these persons have to pay a very high price for such behaviour, since they tarnish their ‘pure’ and ‘natural’ self and ultimately risk isolation and mental derangement. They may lose not only their true self, but also all sense of true reality. The theatre, just as the visual arts, pretends to present something natural and therefore infects the true and natural by lies and deceit. This harms the psyche of both actors and audience.11 When German and Russian theatre historians introduced the term ‘Theatralität/ teatral’nost’, their approaches ranged from a narrow historical one to a wider, anthropological view. Two books published early in the twentieth century were fundamental for all subsequent analyses of theatricality. Georg Fuchs set out in Die Revolution des Theaters of 1909 to identify the elements that distinguish theatre from other art forms. Theatricality for him was the totality of material or sign systems used in a performance, apart from the text. But a year earlier Nikolai Evreinov had given a very influential definition of the other axis. In Apology of Theatricality he had developed a concept of theatricality as a pre-aesthetic instinct at work in all parts of society and culture. Whereas this definition is too wide to be useful, Evreinov was the first to think about ways in which the concept of the theatre can be defined and used as a cultural model. Concentrating on the work leads to a factual view along the lines of Fuchs, concentrating on the spectator to a wider, social or ethical notion of theatricality in the tradition of Shaftesbury or Evreinov.12 In art history the implications of thinking about a work of art in terms of a play performed in front of an audience have been the subject of many studies of theatricality over the past decades. Richard Wollheim for instance, in Painting as an Art (1987), offered theatrical concepts such as the external and internal spectator as ways of understanding what the viewer does. For him, theatricality functions as a heuristic device to help us understand the interaction between art and its viewers. Michael Fried’s Absorption and Theatricality of 1980, on the other hand, took a critical view of the interdependence between a theatrically conceived work of art and its viewers. Within theatre studies many attempts have recently been made to define theatricality, both in technical and disciplinary ways that stay close to the theatre as a medium, and in ways that present the theatre as a metaphor through which to study society as a whole.13 The general impression created by recent studies on theatricality, however, is that of a dead end. Either the term has become so wide and all-embracing that it has become meaningless, or it is too narrowly based on a critique of the literally spectacular character of art works conceived in theatrical terms, and hence too much connected to late-modernist critiques of such theatricality, to be a useful instrument to study other varieties of the interaction between the arts and the theatre.14 Depending on the meaning of the term one favours, even the theatre itself is not automatically theatrical, nor are works of art using elements taken from the theatre for that reason alone theatrical. As Josette Feral put it recently, to understand theatricality we need a double focus: the work on the stage and the spectator.15 In other words, a conceptual slippage tends to occur when a work of art is called ‘theatrical’: between its technical meaning as referring to all the elements that make up the theatre as a medium, and the wider social and moral phenomenon of theatricality as an awareness of acting a part or appearing in front of an audience, with all the connotations of unnaturalness, play-acting, lack of spontaneity, or artificiality this brings with it. This tends to affect current work, and in fact obscures much that distinguishes early modern uses of theatrical elements in the visual arts. But as the case 13\n\nThe Visual Arts and the Theatre in Early Modern Europe\n\nstudies collected in this book show, such use in works of art or buildings predating the 1750s rarely raises the issue of theatricality in the moral sense that subsequently became so conspicuous. It would exceed the boundaries of this book to investigate in depth the reasons for this discomfort with falsity, but the chapters by Hermans and Delbeke do give some precise indications of the actual manner in which such ethical concerns became attached to the theatre: because of the presentation of public figures such as princes or popes as public stagings of virtue in a rather literal way. Instead of taking a modern definition of theatricality as our point of departure we began here by studying the implications of the use of four elements that define early modern theatre: the scenario, the actor, the theatrical space, and the audience. The theatricality of art, we might say, resides in the implications of its use of theatrical elements. But unlike previous studies of such uses we did not stop by cataloguing and documenting them, but instead have taken them as the foundation for further inquiries. These include ontological issues of presence and representation; the poetics of pictorial narration; the boundaries between genres, media and arts; and virtually every use of theatrical elements presented here raises questions about the relations between works of art and their viewers, and about how the work of art stages the act of viewing. The Use of Theatrical Elements in the Arts and their Implications Theatrical Space\n\nExchanges between the theatre and the arts began at the very birth of Greek theatre, when architecture provided the scaffolding for the temporary stages on which comedies and tragedies were performed.16 In the sixteenth century Peruzzi and Serlio designed urban and pastoral views to serve as the backdrop for plays, and conversely, fifteenth- and sixteenth-century paintings used such architectural stage sets as the backgrounds or settings of the historia they put before the viewer.Veronese’s large Biblical scenes are probably the best-known instances of the use of architecture to provide a stage in this way. These paintings point to one important implication of the use of theatrical elements in a work of art: the use of a stage signals to the viewer that he or she should look at what is represented as a viewer of a play, that is, as somebody who watches the unfolding of a play. In his contribution to this book, Marc Bayard argues against an approach to the exchanges between theatre and the arts in terms of influence, originality and imitation or appropriation. The implications of the use of elements which constitute a theatrical space, such as the stage, a backdrop or proscenium, are further articulated by introducing a distinction between referential and processional theatricality. In referential theatricality scenic elements in a painting, in particular perspectival architectural backdrops, clearly refer to stage sets that were in existence before the painting was made, or to general types of stage sets, such as the backdrops designed by Serlio in the 1550s, for tragic and comic scenes (plate 2). In the second variety the viewing process is structured by the painting’s composition in a way that is similar to a theatrical mise en scène. The best-known and most evident instance of this is the figure of the witness or intermediary, a figure who looks out of the painting at the beholder, or points to what happens in the image. Alberti was the first Renaissance theorist to suggest in his De Pictura (1435/6) to include such a figure when depicting a historia, a story taken from the Bible, ancient history or classical mythology. In the near-contemporary Trinità by Masaccio in Santa Maria Novella in Florence (1425–28), Mary looks at the viewer\n\n14\n\nCaroline van Eck and Stijn Bussels\n\nwhile at the same time pointing at her crucified son. Alberti’s advice echoes the rhetorical doctrine that in the actio, the delivery of a speech, the orator should strive for maximum persuasiveness. Enargeia, vividness that makes what is represented in speech seem present before the eyes of the audience, could be achieved by words, but if the situation allowed, also by silent, visual, means such as gesture: ‘In gesture, the body talks’, as Cicero put it.17 At the same time, the use in paintings, buildings, or joyous entries of formal elements related to the theatre also suggests something further: that every space outside the theatre may be turned into a theatrical space. Already in ancient Greece, the architectural constructions on which the audience was seated were very similar to the scaffoldings for the participants in discussions concerning the polis. In late medieval and early modern Europe a parallel between the constructions of the theatre and public political discourse can be made too. No separate place was created as in ancient Greece, but during joyous entries where new political constellations were presented architectural constructions, such as triumphal arches, reshaped the city centre. This architectural framing of the city made clear that everyday reality was transcended and that a privileged locus of political negotiation had come into being. George Kernodle has suggested that the constructions for joyous entries heavily relied on architectural ‘showpieces’ such as funerary monuments. He puts the emphasis on a one-way communication from architecture to the theatre.18 However, it is more appropriate to see these architectural constructions as part of a concerted, multi-media effort to achieve the most effective communication, which is discernibly at work in both funerary monuments and ephemeral constructions for joyous entries. To put it more generally, the question which medium has historical priority in the use of a certain element for the first time, is often hard to solve and just as often irrelevant. Stijn Bussels’ chapter on the communicative power of tableaux vivants in joyous entries from the southern Netherlands makes clear that it is hard to label the characteristics of these tableaux ‘theatrical’ or ‘pictorial’, since in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the theatre, painting and tableaux vivants used similar features and attempted in related ways to persuade their onlookers as effectively as possible. Laura Weigert’s chapter raises a similar issue. She focuses on mystery plays and tapestries depicting the popular theme of the vengeance on Jerusalem for the crucifixion of Christ. Concentrating on both media, she does not identify influences and exchanges, but observes that they share a similar mode of representation. Weigert shows that the two media relied on a similar kind of participation by the beholder, and both called attention to their mimetic artifice. Even when there is a received opinion about a theatrical element that painters took over, it is much more productive to trace the resulting transformations than to debate questions of priority. In Emmanuelle Hénin’s chapter the pictorial use of the theatrical prop par excellence, the curtain, is reconstructed. She shows that the arts did not borrow the use of this prop from the theatre, but the other way around. From the 1550s, theatres took from painting the use of a painted curtain to unveil the space where the play was to be enacted. It served as a marker of fictional space. Sometimes, scenes within the play were unveiled to give particular emphasis to their fictional character, twice-removed from extratheatrical reality. Introducing painted curtains into a painting implies a certain auto-referentiality: the viewer is made doubly aware that what he or she is looking at is a representation rerepresented. But also underlined is the spectacular nature shared by the theatre and the visual arts and their common task of presenting a scene to the viewer. 15\n\nThe Visual Arts and the Theatre in Early Modern Europe\n\nThe Scenario\n\n3 Herri met de Bles, Landscape with the Journey to Emmaus, c. 1550.

Many early modern paintings also show clear similarities with theatrical scenarios in the way they build up a narrative. Traditionally, such pictorial use of narrative is discussed in terms of ut pictura poesis or the paragone, but the chapters by Kati Röttger and Bram Van Oostveldt addressing theatrical narrativity in the visual arts and gardening argue that this traditional contextualization should be reconsidered. In the 1750s and 1760s, the same period the term theatricality acquired a more or less stable ethical and moralistic meaning, the relation between painting and poetry was radically redefined. In his influential essay on the Laocoön of 1766, Lessing reacts against the doctrine of ut pictura poesis by focusing on the intrinsic differences between painting and poetry. He limits painting to spatial representations. Whereas poetry is an art unfolding in time – and as so often in comparisons of poetry and painting based on Horace, by poetry is meant above all dramatic poetry – a painting or sculpture can represent only one moment, and has to be comprehended in one glance. According to Lessing, choosing the ‘most pregnant moment’ is the only way to put a narrative before the viewer’s eye. By depicting an event carefully, its past and future can be suggested. In her chapter in this book, Röttger goes deeper into the consequences of Lessing’s thoughts. By focusing on his play Emilia Galotti, she shows how Lessing deals with the theatre and painting as rivals in performing and/or imagining Emilia. However, before Lessing, many visual artists experimented with ways to overcome this opposition by attempting to convey the temporal aspects of the events or situations they represented. Sixteenth-century landscape painters from the Low Countries, for example, constructed their compositions in such a way that the beholder was obliged to build up his observations in a temporal sequence. In the generation of Pieter Brueghel the Elder (and also of Italian painters like Veronese and their experiments with interrupted perspectives), landscapes directed the beholder’s gaze in time and led gradually to a final insight. Herri met de Bles’ Landscape with the Journey to Emmaus (c. 1550), for instance, shows an impressive landscape in which the beholder gradually discerns the path to Emmaus. The biblical journey is depicted in such a way that it suggests spiritual enlightenment (plate 3).19 In the same generation, graphic artists such as Maarten Van Heemskerck were inspired by the format of theatrical processions.20 Just as on the floats, an allegorical Everyman was represented in successive prints 16\n\nCaroline van Eck and Stijn Bussels\n\n4 Titian, Annunciation, 1562–64. Oil on canvas, 403 × 235 cm. Venice: San Salvatore. Photo: CKD Nijmegen.\n\nshowing the story’s most decisive moments. In his series The Miserable Fate of the Rich (1563), for example, Heemskerck is inspired by the Antwerp procession, the Ommegang, and similarly shows by means of personifications the different ways a rich man can be tempted to abuse his richness. Although Italian Renaissance painters rarely spoke of their work in theatrical or even poetical terms, the similarities between their work and the theatre were often noted. Titian’s San Salvatore Annunciation, painted in 1562–64 (plate 4), for instance, breaks with the Renaissance tradition of representing this event as a private encounter between Mary and the Angel by giving it a dramatic staging that is very close to Aretino’s description in his Vita di Santa Maria, a series of episodes from the life of Mary presented as tableaux vivants. There he wrote of the protagonists that they gesture as Titian would have painted them. In the Humanità di Christo (1539), a life of Christ in the form of a series of tableaux vivants, he even mentions a ‘theatre of clouds’.21 When discussing ordine, one of the main aspects of disegno or pictorial composition, the sixteenth-century Venetian art theorist Lodovico Dolce argued that painters should take care to observe chronological order in the istoria or narrative they depict. The classical authority quoted is Aristotle’s Poetics.22 Such Aristotelian reactions were not exclusively Venetian. In Il Figino (1591), the art critic Gregorio Comanini argued, following Aristotle’s Poetics, that both drama and painting should represent one single action or plot. The most highly regarded genres of painting (history and religious painting, not landscape, still-life or portraiture) resemble poetry because, like poetry, they represent plots or stories and offer visual narrative. As an example he took Raphaels fresco of the Fire in the Borgo in the Vatican (1514; plate 5), and argued that although Raphael included some details that recalled the fire of Troy, it did represent a unified narrative.23 In The Death of Actaeon (1562; plate 6), Titian did not depict separate scenes from the myth, but collapsed two successive moments into a single scene. On the left we see Diana shooting an arrow at Actaeon; her hand is still on the string of her bow but the arrow is already flying. In the centre, however, we see Actaeon already in the process of transformation: his head is changed into that of a stag, and Diana’s hounds are tearing at his legs, which are turning into those of the animal he is becoming. This distillation of a well-known myth into the pivotal moment of its plot, or its most pregnant and meaningful point, engages the spectator’s attention because it breaks with accustomed linear progress and thus becomes a rhetorically powerful means of visual persuasion. At the same time it helps the spectator to identify with what happens because Titian’s conflation of Diana’s shot and Actaeon’s transformation force the viewer to re-enact in his or her mind the process which is so selectively represented. Thomas Puttfarken argued that Titian, in representing these istorie, selected precisely those moments from the story that are the crucial moments of the 17\n\nThe Visual Arts and the Theatre in Early Modern Europe\n\n5 Raphael, The Fire in the Borgo, 1514. Fresco, width at base 670 cm. Rome: Vatican, Stanza dell’Incendio di Borgo. Photo: CKD Nijmegen.\n\nplot, scenes of recognition and periegesis. Such selection of pivotal moments may be read as corresponding to Aristotle’s analysis in the Poetics that Greek viewers of the tragedies were aware that they were looking at selected scenes from the myths on which they were based. 24 Such use of narrative devices, combined with staging, was not limited to the visual arts. As Sigrid de Jong shows in her chapter, early visitors to the ancient Greek ruins in Paestum used theatrical techniques of representation to record the buildings. They were highly selective in what they depicted, suggested the passing of time and the unfolding of a narrative: that of initial expectations, deception and even terror when confronted with these uncouth heaps of stone, followed by attempts to assimilate Paestum into the canon of classical architecture, or acceptance that the ruins were simply remains from a past that was now lost. Here as well, the way the representation is staged directs the way the viewer should look at the records made of the temples, just as there was a conventional sequence of observation and affect that visitors to the site itself were obliged to feel they had undergone. Sometimes, a painting could become part of an elaborate scenario that regulated the way it should be viewed. This scenario could become so detailed and rule-bound that it almost became a ritual, and the work of art could draw on already existing religious and political ritual practices. In the case of the portrait of the Venetian patrician Bianca Capello, which Elsje van Kessel discusses in her chapter, the owner of the painting Francesco Bembo developed an elaborate viewing scenario. It began with him gazing at the painting at set times; next he allowed his wife and relatives to view, touch, and kiss it; then it made an entry at his dinner table; finally, tours through the city were staged, ending with an official visit of the portrait to the Doge.\n\n18\n\nCaroline van Eck and Stijn Bussels\n\nThe Actor\n\n6 Titian, Death of Actaeon, 1562.

But it also points to another implication of the use of theatrical elements in a painting, since in painting, as in the theatre, the boundaries between representation and presence are less clear-cut than in ordinary life. Such ambiguity could be the result of the use of theatrical gestures like the lifting of a curtain to signal a new series within the action. This action paradoxically suggests that the play in the play thus indicated is somehow less real than the primary theatrical performance of which it is part. But more often the locus of this oscillation between presence and representation is the body of the actor. Actors both act their roles and in that sense offer a representation, but at the same time are present on the stage in their own bodies. In many respects Aby Warburg was the first art historian to consider interactions between the theatre and the visual arts from an ontological perspective, but he did not follow up the tantalizing remarks he made in his published works.25 The chapter by Lex Hermans reconstructs various degrees of ambiguity between bodily presence and theatrical representation. In the courtly theatres built in Florence, Parma and Vicenza in the sixteenth century, statues of rulers were placed in the theatrical space to observe both the play and the audience. In the Farnese theatre in Parma an equestrian statue of the prince was located in the theatre. In Sabbioneta a statue of the emperor Vespasian was positioned directly behind the seat of the Gonzaga ruler who shared his name with the emperor, as a visual reminder of the model the prince claimed – or was expected – to follow. But sometimes, as we have seen, the prince himself became a theatre, a place to view the enactment of princely virtue. Wendy Heller, too, discusses the use of statues in the theatre. She concentrates on performances with scenes, popular in seventeenth-century Venetian opera, in which statues dance, and argues that these statues were put on stage in order to present a repertory of mythological and historical personages, as well as to give the opera an aura of antiquity. But these scenes featuring actors performing the role of inanimate sculptures which come alive also inserted sculpture within discourses on the living presence of art. So once again, a theatrical ambiguity of the bodily presence of actors and the personages they perform was at stake. Maarten Delbeke also deals with statues, although in urban space. He shows that for Pope Alexander VII deciding whether to have a statue erected in his honour on the Campidoglio, or deciding whether to live not only in the Vatican but also in a town palace on the Quirinal, became primarily a matter of being seen to act in a certain way. Ultimately the question of both the Pope’s images and their physical presence in Rome was judged in terms of the way he played his papal role. Whereas the theatricality of Baroque Rome is usually conceived rather literally as a series of spaces presented as stage sets, of which Giambattista Falda’s Il nuovo teatro delle fabriche, et edificii, in prospettiva di Roma moderna (1665–69) is a prime example, Delbeke shows in a more finegrained analysis how Rome, and in particular the Campidoglio and Quirinal, became a silent actor in the performance of the Papal presence.\n\n19\n\nThe Visual Arts and the Theatre in Early Modern Europe\n\nWhen public life is considered as acting and being seen to act, the role proper to one’s station in life, having a portrait painted also becomes an intensely theatrical act. Like the urban spaces in which the pope performed his public roles, a portrait – as Hanneke Grootenboer puts it in her chapter – provides a space in which the sitter, placed in a mise-en-scène and surrounded by meaningful props, presents him or herself to the public as a subject, and a self that can be read. Hermans and Delbeke discuss cases of public role acting in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, where the focus is on the public persona, and a person’s function or position – as prince, pope or condottiere – takes precedence over the individual, let alone the private, self. But in Grootenboer’s analysis of seventeenth-century Dutch portraits the ultimate question is in what manner theatricality may help us to understand such presentation of the self as subject. Theatricality in her case refers to the performative character of self-presentation. Sitting for a portrait is a theatrical act in the original sense of the word thea, because one offers oneself to the gaze first of the painter and next of the viewer, but also in the sense that such sitting, like any act of theatrical representation, can be structured, ritualized and staged with varying degrees of consciousness and elaboration. The oscillation between presence and representation provides the conceptual space in which to elucidate how the self as the subject of a portrait is staged and understood. The Audience\n\nPerforming one’s social or political role and sitting for a portrait can be related to playing a role in drama, since they share its quality of unfolding over time and its fictional aspects. In all these cases the role-player takes on, selects, or constructs a role or public aspect that does not coincide entirely with what one might consider the core of one’s being. Acting on stage, playing a role, character or public function in public or private life, all share a certain degree of fictionality, in the sense that something is shaped, presented or made that is not real. The Latin root of fiction, fingere, means to shape, form or fashion, but also, in its extended sense, to contrive, devise or invent. The fictional character of performances on the stage, in public and private life, or in the arts, is often signalled by the use of framing devices. De Jong’s chapter on visual representations of Paestum using the conventions of theatre sets or landscape paintings documents a straightforward use of framing devices in the literal sense of selecting and fixating a viewpoint. Put in slightly different terms, if fiction is a way of organizing experience, theatricality may be said to be a way of organizing visual representation in relation to a viewer.26 But as the chapters by Röttger and Van Oostveldt show, from the 1760s onwards the fictional nature of theatrical performance became increasingly rejected as unnatural and therefore immoral. Another meaning of fingere can be invoked here: to pretend, to pose and to act insincerely.The overt organization of experience is evaluated as being ‘pure fiction’, too far removed from reality. Whereas for the Italian rulers and popes, or even the Dutch burghers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, playing a role was part of being a public being, eighteenth-century German and French audiences began to see such contrivance or artificiality as immoral because flouting a stable self, and as the symptom of the ultimate modern sickness: alienation from oneself. With regard to this issue, Denis Diderot strikes a completely different tone. By putting the emphasis on the active role of the audience, he moves the discussion from an ethical to an aesthetic context, most tellingly in the famous passage on Joseph Vernet’s landscape paintings shown in the Salon of 1767 (plate 7).27 Visitors to the popular biannual exhibition had to become absorbed in the works. They had to 20\n\nCaroline van Eck and Stijn Bussels\n\nabstract themselves from the overpopulated exhibition room, ignore the other paintings on the overloaded walls, and concentrate on a single one of the paintings by imagining that they were actually part of that painting. At that moment fictionalization comes in, for Diderot’s readers are urged to follow the example of the author who imagines himself walking in the depicted landscapes with a local abbé and his pupils (figures not represented in Vernet’s paintings). They might even try to enter into a fictive conversation with this interlocutor, which they often interrupt to admire the beautiful vistas. Diderot does not restrict himself to the two dimensions and the timelessness of painting. Instead, he becomes an actor who is looking and being looked at while walking in a natural setting. The fact that the philosopher chose landscape painting to explain this imaginary entrance into a landscape makes it part of the discussion, at the time, of landscapes and gardens in theatrical terms. Moreover, as Van Oostveldt makes clear, in real landscapes the onlookers are both actor and beholder, since they are both admiring their surroundings and at the same time aware of the gaze of others. This is also the case for the walkers in Diderot’s fiction, since in the Vernet passage the abbé says he is not only an onlooker, but exclaims he is Adrienne Le Couvreur, one of the most famous actresses of that time.28 7 Joseph Vernet, Shepherd in the Alps, c. 1760.

In the preceding section we have traced some of the implications use of theatrical elements had for paintings, statues, buildings, gardens, and urban ensembles. When we try to summarize these implications, a few points stand out that may also serve to indicate new avenues of research. The concept of theatricality is fundamentally unstable, but in the definitions specifically addressing relations between the theatre and the arts developed from the early decades of the eighteenth century, one element remains constant: that of duplication and self-referentality, self-consciousness or even an infinite regress. Duplication occurs because works of art use elements from the theatre that are in themselves visual, such as stage sets, gestures, or framing devices. But the implication of the use of such elements is another, more abstract duplication: representational elements from the theatre are represented in works of art. The chapters by Hénin, Heller and Bayard illustrate the meta-representational implications, mise-en-abyme or infinite regress to which such use can lead. Ultimately, this can lead to the same kind of reflexivity the term theatricality itself has when used to define the theatre. But one of the major implications of the use of theatrical elements in the arts and the duplication or reflexivity it brings with it, is that several boundaries and distinctions that we tend to consider as essential to the arts are undermined: that between the genres to begin with, but also that between the work 21\n\nThe Visual Arts and the Theatre in Early Modern Europe\n\nof art and the public, between representation and presence, and between fiction and reality. Looking more closely at the use of theatrical elements in the visual arts of early modern Europe therefore also leads to a revision of the significance of two concepts that have guided much research on early modern exchanges: the paragone and the theatrum mundi topos. Instead of reinforcing the similarity, or fundamental equivalence they both suggest between the theatre and the world outside it, the various contributions to this book point in another direction. They indicate that there is no equality or equal exchange between the two; rather the implication of the arguments offered here is that, at the moment theatrical elements are introduced into the arts, the ontological and generic status of the arts begins to slip. Theatrum mundi and the model of equal exchange associated with it therefore does not offer a sufficient guide for historical research into the use of theatrical elements in the arts and architecture. In a similar way, tracing the use of theatrical elements in the arts throws new light on the tradition of the paragone. Like the theatrum mundi topos, this presupposed a fundamental equivalence or similarity between the arts. In its formulations by Horace, and even more by Plutarch, the equation of poetry and painting rested on their equal power to achieve enargeia, lifelike, vivid representation. According to classical rhetoric this was one of the main instruments of persuasion.29 This equivalence was challenged by Lessing who argued in the Laocoön that the pictorial and text-based arts differ fundamentally. But at the same time, he returned in his plays to the issue of the fraught relation between representation and presence, not to revive the rhetorical view that the dissolution of representation into what it represents is the supreme means of persuasion, but to redefine such vividness and its effect on the public as an epistemological and moral problem. The issues that arise when theatrical elements are used in the visual arts and architecture force us to rethink the relations between the theatre, the visual arts, and the ways in which they represent the worlds outside their artistic domains.\n\nNotes We are very grateful to David Peters Corbett for inviting us to edit a special issue of Art History, and to Sam Bibby for all his practical assistance and guidance.

Theatricality in Early Modern Art and Architecture Edited by Caroline van Eck and Stijn Bussels © 2011 Association of Art Historians.\n\nHere we see, according to the inscription, ‘the theatre or stage as it was when the Passion of our Lord was performed in 1547’ (plate 1). 1 Indeed, Hubert Cailleau’s drawing offers a picture of the key sites included in contemporary Passion plays: God’s domain in heaven vies with limbo and an enormous hell mouth; the gates of Nazareth and Jerusalem identify the major cities; structures designated as the Temple, Herod’s palace, and the Golden Gate further localize the setting. The drawing also shows how geographically distant places appeared side-by-side and remained concurrently within the spectators’ visual field as the action moved from one location to the next. In these respects it visualizes important components of mystery play performance in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. As evidence for this distinct play-going experience, however, the drawing is both misleading and incomplete. Its inscription evokes for a modern reader an enclosed structure made to house plays and a performance area elevated and separated from the one reserved for the audience. The image corroborates these assumptions: the panorama of clearly identifiable buildings limits and demarcates the field of action; the ornamented frieze creates a barrier between this space and that of the audience. It was precisely the absence of such boundaries that defined the performance of large-scale urban religious drama. What type of image might actually provide evidence for the viewing experience of a mystery play has not been the preoccupation of scholars concerned with the relationship between the two forms of visual representation.2 Reception has been the focus of Pamela Sheingorn and Robert Clark’s recent work in which they characterize the reading experience of late medieval illuminated mystery play scripts as ‘performative’.3 However, the majority of the scholarship on mystery plays and visual representation has been interested primarily in their subject matter and remains beholden to the methodological assumption of a causal connection between the two media, even when this relationship is formulated as one of reciprocity.4 My goal here is to bring into focus a historical moment in which pictures and plays shared a representational mode and engaged their audiences in a similar way.5 I suggest that the viewing experience of mystery plays was in many ways homologous to that of contemporary tapestries and that isolating this similarity allows us to establish and appreciate the specificity of both media and the theatrical culture in which they participated. Historians of medieval drama have recovered the term ‘theatricality’ to move away from text-based analyses of plays to investigations of their performance and as a means to describe the distinct characteristics of a variety of dramatic events.6 25\n\n‘Theatricality’ in Tapestries and Mystery Plays and its Afterlife in Painting\n\n1 Hubert Cailleau,‘Stage’ for the 1547 Passion play in Valencienne (‘Le Mystère par personages de la vie, passion, mort, resurrection et ascension de Notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ en 25 journées’), 1577.

Photo: BnF.\n\nIn so doing, they have embraced those features of the term that have been traditionally denigrated: namely, a reliance on spectatorial participation and a recognition and exaggeration of artifice.7 Yet in most cases they have overlooked the evidence images provide for the nature of this form of dramatic artifice because they commonly attribute a documentary status to pictures.8 Art historians, on the other hand, have been more interested in the transmission of a tradition of classical illusionism that links art and theatre in the early modern period. This is due, in part, to the continued emphasis in the discipline on painting, sculpture, and architecture. Tapestries present an alternative to the classical mimetic model. For historians of medieval theatre, they offer clues as to how plays might have been experienced; for art historians, they broaden the criteria with which images can be compared to drama beyond their purported ‘lifelikeness’. Of all the forms of visual representation, surviving or documented from the late medieval and early modern periods, tapestry exhibits the most numerous and striking similarities with mystery plays. Indeed, the two media were mutually dependent. For instance, the municipal authorities of the Burgundian city of Nevers paid two of its members to travel to nearby Moulins to study the tapestry of the Nine Worthies in the collection of the count of Bourbon. Upon their return, they organized a performance on the same theme.9 Beyond instances of their direct exchange, the parallels between the two media can be seen more generally in the circumstances of their production and reception. The increase in quantity and scale of mystery plays within the realms of the French kings and Burgundian dukes from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century corresponded with the expansion of the tapestry industry.10 The same noble patrons commissioned tapestries and subsidized plays.11 Both media drew quite commonly on the same themes. Like a temporally defined performance, the display of a tapestry took place within, and was limited to, a particular ceremonial occasion, and the scale of its almost life-size figures resembled that of live actors. References to tapestries in inventory accounts can even be confused with documentation on the performance of a play or a script, since the language used for each is the same.12 26\n\nLaura Weigert\n\nMy focus in this chapter is on the visual and affective resemblance between the two media, using as an example the French plays referred to in textual scripts and documents as the ‘Vengeance of our Lord’, the ‘Vengeance of Jesus Christ’, or simply the ‘Vengeance’, and tapestries depicting the same theme. The play was popular in France and the Burgundian Netherlands, with over fourteen recorded performances between the end of the fourteenth and the mid-sixteenth centuries.13 At least six tapestry sets were produced at the height of the play’s popularity in the fifteenth century.14 A later set of paintings also survives, dating from the mid-sixteenth century, when royal and parliamentary legislation increasingly regulated the performance of mystery plays in Paris.15 I will describe the structural, affective, and aesthetic characteristics one of the surviving tapestry sets shares with the ‘Vengeance’ play. I will then demonstrate that the paintings of the same theme depart significantly from the tapestries and plays and reevaluate their status as visual evidence for contemporary performance practices. The earliest preserved French script of the ‘Vengeance’ play was composed before 1430 by Eustache Mercadé.16 Loosely based on Flavius Josephus’s version of events, it charts the episodes leading up to and surrounding the destruction of Jerusalem.17 The play is distinguished from the more general narrative of the destruction of Jerusalem by its incorporation of three series of events: the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus and Vespasian, the arrest and death of Pontius Pilate, and the conversion of Vespasian upon perceiving Christ’s face on Veronica’s veil. A contemporary prose ‘Vengeance’ also includes this series of events.18 However, the play differs from this version in terms of its sheer scale, number of characters, and its increased emphasis on Jewish depravity and guilt.The dominant theme of the play is the divine retribution for the death of Jesus, the responsibility for which, although Pilate’s fate is described in detail, is placed squarely on the Jews. As the character of the preacher, who signals the start of the play puts it: ‘We would like to play for you the vengeance of God to make known how the Jews were punished.’19 The episodes incorporated into the surviving tapestries of a set, currently distributed between New York and Tournai, parallel those in the French play and depart in the same ways from both Flavius Josephus’s account and the prose version of the ‘Vengeance’. In the left-hand section of one of the tapestries, now in New York, we witness Vespasian’s cure and conversion.20 The remaining tapestries of this set focus on events leading up to and including the siege and destruction of Jerusalem. Nero sends Vespasian and Titus to Judea in a fragment now in Tournai. Another fragment in the same museum depicts the assault on the city and the devastating impact of the siege on its citizens (plate 3). The New York tapestry incorporates the capture of the spoils and the murder and sale of the citizens of Jerusalem (plate 2). Stylistic criteria suggest that the set was produced in the Southern Netherlands in the 1460s.21 References to ‘Vengeance’ tapestries appear in numerous royal and princely inventories, including those listing the possessions of Philip the Good (1420) and Charles VIII, king of France (1494).22 Although any specific claims as to ownership and to the circumstances under which this particular set was displayed must remain hypothetical, it is clear that it was a product of the Franco-Flemish environment in which the urban performance of mystery plays flourished. The distinctive feature of the ‘alterity of medieval religious drama’, to use Rainer Warning’s term, is the lack of designated and fixed boundaries that have come to circumscribe the traditional modern theatre and the play-going experience it frames.23 Taking place outside, in a central marketplace and in the streets, the performance space merged with the space of the city. The period of time in which the play took place, 27\n\n‘Theatricality’ in Tapestries and Mystery Plays and its Afterlife in Painting\n\n2 Detail showing episodes from The Vengeance of Our Lord, Southern Netherlands, 1460–70.

Finally, the division between audience and actor often dissolved as actors moved into the locations occupied by spectators, who subsequently adopted roles as bystanders or as participants in the action of the play. Characteristics of these late medieval plays and how they were performed include excessive display, exaggeration, and the accumulation of a seemingly limitless quantity of disparate events, places, and characters. 24 If the productions of the ‘Vengeance’ play exhibit anything, it is excessive display and exaggeration. A production was no small undertaking: it required a substantial investment of resources by an individual city and at least a year of planning. Documented performances lasted between two and four full days, involved over 100 speaking parts, costumes, and elaborate stage design.25 The assault and conquest of Jerusalem in particular, to which at least a full day was often devoted, expanded the number of participants, incorporating horses and additional costumes.26 The ‘Vengeance’ play also demonstrates the principle of accumulation that structured the production of mystery plays, in which markers of location were added as needed over the course of an individual performance. The second day of the play, for instance, took place in Rome, Jerusalem, Heaven, Hell, Spain, Lyons, Hell, Armenia, and Jotapata, moving repeatedly back and forth between Jerusalem, Rome and Spain and then between Lyons and Rome. 27 As in other mystery plays, the locations were probably designated by wooden constructions or sets placed next to or across from each other.28 Following such a ‘Vengeance’ performance required establishing the connection between events in different places as the action moved quickly from location to location, or transpired simultaneously. Stephen Wright uses the apt analogy of a three-ring circus to describe the highlighting of one location, while the place marks and actors remained in other locations elsewhere within the viewers’ visual fields.29 In turn, the audience had to gauge 28\n\nLaura Weigert\n\n3 The Siege of Jerusalem, Southern Netherlands, 1460–70. Tapestry, 3.70 × 5.40 m.Tournai: Musée d’Histoire et d’Archéologie. Photo: IRPA.\n\nthe relationship between places, whose distance was conflated by the proximity of individual sets. The multiplicity of events and the number and intertwining of figures in the ‘Vengeance’ tapestry create a similar sense of highly structured excess. Each panel provides visual cues that both differentiate and link episodes within the densely packed compositions. The assault on Jerusalem depicted in one of the Tournai fragments captures the movement and confusion of a battle through the profusion of overlapping figures and their exaggerated gestures (plate 3). At the same time, the city walls and streets serve to organize these figures into discrete, although related, groups. Particularly effective is the curve of the wall that encircles the group of archers directing their arrows at the Temple. A serpentine street of dark grey stones parallels the wall and winds from the top to the bottom of the composition beneath the Roman soldiers, unifying them as a group and defining their actions as one distinct event within the broader assault on the city. The tapestry set as a whole would have presented viewers with an accumulation of episodes, rather than with a composition or series of compositions organized around a central event and characterized by structural balance or organic unity. Architectural structures or elements, like city walls, locate the events in specific places: they act as backdrops against which the figures are placed but which they do not inhabit. In turn, the placing of events along both vertical and horizontal axes denies the visual cues that might signal the temporal or geographic distance between events. We are often provided with multiple viewpoints onto a single place, as in the discrete events occurring simultaneously within the walls of Jerusalem (plate 3). 29\n\n‘Theatricality’ in Tapestries and Mystery Plays and its Afterlife in Painting\n\nA ‘Vengeance’ performance in Mons, roughly contemporary to the tapestries in Tournai and New York, provides an example of the fluidity between the spaces of the actors and the spectators of the play.30 Spectators gathered either on the ground, on raised scaffolds, or in the rooms of the houses with windows looking out onto the square, according to the entrance fee they had paid. The diversity of these viewing sites makes it difficult to designate a single space associated with the audience. Moreover, scenes like the battles that required more space and a greater number of actors, moved the action onto the square itself, effacing any clear distinction between individuals watching the play and those assuming the role of characters within it. In turn, the temporal limits of the performance were not strictly defined. Snacks and meals are included in the city’s accounts of expenses; they were distributed to the intermingled actors and audience. As in the plays, the boundaries between the space in which the woven action takes place and the one occupied by the viewer are permeable. The life-size figures often seem to spill over the edge of the fabric, unbounded by the barrier a border or frame would impose.Viewers of these pictures and plays were required to engage in interpretive work to situate events both temporally and spatially and to identify the relationships between what might appear initially to be a confusion of bodies. The scale of the tapestries and the urban performances, however, prevented the viewers from attaining a sufficient distance to allow them to obtain an overview of events or to perceive the story in its entirety. This engagement in both the tapestries and the plays of spectators, as potential participants in the action and producers of narrative coherence, implicated them in the violence depicted. Indeed, the ‘Vengeance’ is considered the most violent of the late medieval mystery plays on account of the extent and variety of the acts of violence, which highlight the excess of the play.31 Aside from Nero’s order to cut into his mother’s body, which is carried out live, the violence is focused in the final day or days of the performance and the battle in Jerusalem. This part of the play is filled with repeated and varied acts of violence performed on the Jews, described in detail by the characters enacting them. The tapestries give visual form to these diverse punishments inflicted on the Jews. In addition to the general goriness of the battle scenes, they emphasize the atrocious acts meted out by the victors after the fall of the city. The fragment at the Metropolitan Museum captures the death of soldiers in battle, as swords puncture chests and blood sprays, drips, and oozes. A similar fate meets Jews after the destruction of Jerusalem: in the lower section of the same panel, at the viewers’ eyelevel, blood streams from the wounds of men cut open to extract the gold they have swallowed in the hopes of preserving their wealth (plate 2). Finally, both the tapestry set and the play focus on the gruesome incident of a Jewish mother who kills and eats her child. The description of this event is one of the significant ways in which the ‘Vengeance’ play departs from the prose version of the story. In the latter, the children of Christian women die of starvation in Jerusalem. An angel appears to them, saying it is God’s will that the mothers nourish themselves on their children’s bodies.32 The surviving versions of the script follow Josephus’s original text more closely and transform the story into one of infanticide in which the perpetrator is Jewish.33 This atrocious act is given deliberate emphasis in the tapestry and in the script. The Tournai tapestry charts the episode in three stages: she eats a limb, while the body roasts on a skewer; a soldier accosts her; and she is dragged from her house (plate 3). The cluster of images devoted to her actions encourages the viewer to dedicate a prolonged look at this segment of the 30\n\nLaura Weigert\n\n4 First Cloth: View of Jerusalem, c. 1500.

Similarly, the lengthy monologues by Josephus and the four women involved in the acts of infanticide and cannibalism in the script would have captured the audience’s attention for the duration of the speeches. The structural and affective qualities of this tapestry set, which I contend resemble the set performance of the ‘Vengeance’, recall numerous other contemporaneous tapestries, many of which also highlight battle scenes. We must recognize, however, the variety of tapestries produced during this period, including those which incorporate a floral pattern (millefleurs), are typologically organized, or which adopt a unified system of perspectival illusionism. Moreover, the ‘Vengeance’ tapestries, unlike other tapestries with similar compositional features, have a particular connection to contemporary drama in that the events they represent were also seen in actual performances. Viewing a tapestry set might have recalled the experience of watching a play. The reverse was also the case, as we learned in the city of Nevers, where tapestries of the Nine Worthies provided a model for a civic performance on the same theme.34 Could it be that representatives from Mons, a city within the realm of Philip the Good, examined the tapestry listed in the 1420 inventory of the duke’s possessions in order to imagine the impact on spectators of their own ‘Vengeance’ play? In their attempt to recreate a ‘Vengeance’ performance, scholars have turned, instead, to a group of paintings in Reims. These seven water-based paintings on linen cloths, each one measuring approximately 3 by 3 metres, depict the key events in the ‘Vengeance’ story:Vespasian’s conversion, Pilate’s death, and the destruction of Jerusalem.35 An inscription on the first cloth, stating that: ‘Here follows the mystery of the Lord’s Vengeance’, has served as evidence for linking a performance of the play to the paintings, which were produced sometime in the first third of the sixteenth century. Conveniently, a nineteenth-century archivist discovered a reference to a performance in Reims in 1531; since then, scholarship on the paintings has assumed that they document this occasion.36 31\n\n‘Theatricality’ in Tapestries and Mystery Plays and its Afterlife in Painting\n\n5 Fifth Cloth: Scenes of Famine within the Walls of Jerusalem, c. 1500. Distemper on linen cloth, 3 × 3 m. Reims: Musée des Beaux-Arts. Photo: C. Devleeschauwer, Musée des Beaux-Arts de Reims.\n\nI have argued elsewhere that this association between the paintings and an actual performance has been falsely established. Whereas scholars have assumed that the word ‘mystère’ in the inscription refers specifically to a mystery play, at the time it could have described a wide range of representations of sacred events.37 Furthermore, despite the claims to the contrary, I have concluded that there is no evidence for a performance of the ‘Vengeance’ in Reims in 1531: the inclusion of the events from the play, and details such as inscriptions or gestures indicating a figure’s speech, were a result of the artists’ reliance on the printed script of the play, published in multiple editions between 1491 and 1539, rather than on its performance.38 But more important to my point here than the concrete particulars of the surviving evidence, is the way in which these paintings depart from the structural, affective, and aesthetic qualities that characterize the ‘Vengeance’ tapestries and plays. The Reims paintings do integrate key components of the staging of urban drama. The first cloth, which focuses on the Jews’ denial of their guilt and blindness to their impending fate, recalls the fluidity between performance and civic spaces (plate 4). As a chariot and sword, omens portending the destruction of the city, appear in the sky, they feast, dance, and talk. This takes place in a central square, surrounded by town houses, from whose windows spectators observe the action. In front of the houses in the left corner, inhabitants of Jerusalem take part in a meal on long tables. Discrete architectural structures frame individual events within the composition. On the righthand side, Pilate debates with his advisers who was responsible for Jesus’s death. The different stages of infanticide during the siege of Jerusalem are contained within such structures (plate 5). However, each composition isolates a fixed vantage point from which to observe the event it encompasses. The architectural structures incorporated into each composition provide a kaleidoscope of views, shifting the viewers’ perspective to focus on the individual events that transpire within. The figures inhabit the structures, and are thereby both spatially and temporally differentiated from those around them. In the fifth painting, for instance, we move from an image of a woman holding her son with a knife held to his belly on the right, to his roasting on a spit, to her eating 32\n\nLaura Weigert\n\nthe baby, and finally, to her sharing her food with soldiers (plate 5). The diminution in scale in the upper register of the composition signals both a geographic and temporal distance: the last event, in which a mother shares her child’s body with the soldiers, appears in the top right corner of the image. The viewers’ experience of the ‘Vengeance’ story is thereby controlled. On the one hand, they are invited to identify the places in which the action unfolds as ones that they might conceivably occupy. Each painting offers privileged views into the individual houses in which the crime of infanticide occurs. The allusions to civic topography and festivities recall the viewers’ own urban surroundings and civic theatre. On the other hand, however, the use of perspective determines the position from which the viewers perceive events. Moreover, the curious upward tilt of the centralized composition in the first cloth, or the bird’s eye perspective in the fifth cloth, remove the depicted spaces of the city from that of the viewers. Finally, the ornamented borders that frame each painting, and which double in width at the bottom, closest to the viewer, define each painting as a discrete and self-sufficient representational field that viewers perceive only from a distance. The viewers’ perception of the events as a whole is similarly guided and regulated. Each image focuses attention on an event or a series of events, which are, in turn, clearly isolated within the composition. Unlike the principle of accumulation that structured the events within mystery play performances, the series is organized with a clear beginning, the state of affairs in Jerusalem depicted in the first cloth, and a clear end, the sale and murder of its citizens, in the seventh. It offers a temporal, spatial, and thematic overview of the events of a ‘Vengeance’ play. To the extent that the Reims paintings offer a vision of a ‘Vengeance’ play that would be impossible to obtain in an actual performance, they resemble Hubert Cailleau’s drawing of the 1547 Passion play that took place in Valenciennes (plate 1). The drawing provides an overview of the sites at which the action occurred. Heaven and hell frame these locations and impose a boundary that adopts the compositional principle of Last Judgment scenes with heaven on the left, hell on the right. In both the Reims paintings and Cailleau’s drawing, the image delimits the scope of the play and fixes the vantage point from which viewers perceive events. The space the viewers occupy is, in turn, clearly designated and distinct from the spaces in which the action transpires. Moreover, the production of both the painted cloths and Cailleau’s drawing relied on an experience of a play that differed significantly from that of a performance in the central square of a city. The cloths draw on the script of the ‘Vengeance’, widely distributed in print to be read, rather than to be performed on a large scale. The script codified the text of the play and could be perused within the privacy afforded by a domestic context. 39 Cailleau’s drawing was made thirty years after the performance of the Passion play in Valenciennes, a performance that took place within the Hôtel de Croy, rather than on the public square previously used for mystery plays.40 The architectural frame of this structure enforced a physical boundary between the site of the performance and the city of Valenciennes. The theatrical activity that took place within an enclosed structure, as at the Hôtel de Croy, delimited the space and role of viewers in a way that the performances of mystery plays in city squares did not. Sixteenth-century legislation confirms that this type of limitation was not only common in the staging of religious drama but also intended and enforced. The Parliament of Paris’s support and protection of the Confraternity of the Passion provided a way to control the performance of religious drama: it identified the actors permitted to perform 33\n\n‘Theatricality’ in Tapestries and Mystery Plays and its Afterlife in Painting\n\nand restricted the locations in which their performances took place to a series of buildings the Confraternity rented.41 The large-scale performance of mystery plays within public squares continued through the end of the sixteenth century outside Paris, coexisting and, in some cases, conflicting with other forms of theatrical activity. The Parisian legislation makes clear, however, that the civic authorities were concerned by instances in which plays were not effectively confined by their architectural settings, arguing that the spilling of religious drama into the city streets led to social disruption.42 The historical record has depended on images like the Reims cloths and Cailleau’s depiction of the ‘theatre’ at Valenciennes to visualize the performance of mystery plays in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Consequently, we have not been able to appreciate the open-ended nature of their narratives, the excess and accumulation they convey, and the permeable boundary between spectator and action that defined their performance. It is, rather, to the tapestries that we should return for a vestige of the visual experience of these plays. These tapestries suggest, in turn, that the distinctive characteristics of large-scale urban drama cannot be represented visually but can only be enacted through the viewer’s participation.\n\nNotes Versions of this chapter, which draws on my larger study of the relationship between Franco-Flemish art and theatre in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, were presented at the Institute for Advanced Study (Princeton), Yale University (New Haven), Ruprecht Karls Universität (Heidelberg), Freie Universität (Berlin), and Fordham University (New York). I thank each audience for its input on these occasions. Reed College, the Institute for Advanced Study, the American Philosophical Society, and Rutgers University provided funding for my research. I am also grateful to Mario Longtin, Sarah McHam, Katherine Zieman, and the editors of the orignal journal, Stijn Bussels and Caroline van Eck, for their careful reading of the text.\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9 10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5 6\n\n‘Le teatre ou hourdement pourtraict come il estoit quant fut jouer le Mystere de la passion nostre seigneur Jesus Christ anno 1547.’ (Frontispiece of Paris,BnF, Ms. fr. Rothschild 3010(I.7.3); Elie Konigson, La Représentation d’un mystère de la Passion à Valenciennes en 1547, Paris, 1969.) Many authors have expressed doubts as to its ‘authenticity’, but Henri Rey-Flaud most forcefully argues that Hubert Cailleau did not base his drawing on the Passion play that took place in Valenciennes (Le Cercle magique. Essai sur le théâtre en rond à la fin du Moyen Age, Paris, 1973, 209–18). Since Emile Mâle’s publications (‘Le Renouvellement de l’art par les mystères’, Gazette des Beaux Arts, 3rd series, 31:1–3, 1904, 89–106, 215– 30, 283–301, 379–94), literature on the general topic has increased in sophistication and scope. It would be impossible to do justice here to the diversity of this scholarship. Robert L. A. Clark and Pamela Sheingorn, ‘Performative reading: the illustrated manuscripts of Arnoul Gréban’s Mystere de la Passion’, European Medieval Drama, 6, 2002, 129–54. Elina Gertsman adopts this model to describe the ‘performative reading’ experience to which late medieval dance of death paintings attest (‘Pleyinge and peyntynge: performing the dance of death’, Studies in Iconography, 27, 2006, 1–43). For a study that emphasizes the reciprocity between art and drama, see Martin Stevens, ‘The intertextuality of medieval art and drama’, New Literary History, 22, 1991, 317–37. In this respect my approach resembles that of Michael Fried (Absorption and Theatricality. Painting and Beholder in the Age of Diderot, Chicago, IL, 1980). For instance, Helen Solterer, ‘Performing the pasts: a dialogue with Paul Zumthor’, Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies, 27: 3, 1997, 595–7,622-5 ‘Theatre and theatricality’ in Simon Gaunt and Sarah Kay, eds, The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Literature, Cambridge, 2008,\n\n11 12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n181-94; and and Meg Twycross, ‘The theatricality of medieval English plays’, in Richard Beadle and Alan J. Fletcher, eds, The Cambridge Companion to Medieval English Theatre, 2nd edn, Cambridge, 2008, 26–75. For a summary of the negative associations of the term ‘theatricality’, see Tracy C. Davis and Thomas Postlewait eds, Theatricality, Cambridge, 2003, 4–5, 16–21.
