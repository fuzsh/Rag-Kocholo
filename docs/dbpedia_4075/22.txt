Biography

He was born in 1455 in Boveney. He died in 1520. His wife Elizabeth's identity is considered uncertain by some genealogists. The connection between Richard Montacute and Robert Montague was supplied by Robert Latane Montague III of Alexandria, Virginia [see Montagues in Virginia page]. He was Trustee of the Montague Memorial Association. It came from a Genealogical Chart hanging in the Urbanna, Virginia home of the late Governor of Virginia, Andrew Jackson Montague. The research and chart were commissioned by his son General Robert Latane Montague II.

The following paragraph may be inaccurate. Findagrave and LDS sources appear to confirm Robert's ancestry.

"..Edward Montague, born 1429, is listed as his father. But it's doubtful he even existed. Edward's father would have been Richard Montague of Salisbury as found at [1]. This Richard, however, most likely died unmarried and childless..."
