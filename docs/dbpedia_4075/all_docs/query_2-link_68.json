The task how- ever has been no easy one, obstacles arose at the start which seemed insurmountable. The first one hundred years of the Virginia colony [1620-1720] as far as family history was concerned, appeared to have passed into oblivion. No printed work was found which threw light upon family history during that period. Families had not to any extent moved from original homesteads, the generations had lived and died in the same neighborhood, and each generation seemed to have borne the same names, of William, Thomas, and Peter, of Eliz- abeth, Catherine and Frances. It seemed impossible to separate one from the other. Even when all the records of all the counties were in hand, it was found impossible to form from them a connected ped- igree. It was only when copies of the few vestry books of Christ Church, Middlesex, were used in connection with the various Co. records, that light began to appear, and the early branches began to assume the places they occupy in this work. And the record of them here given, however imperfect it may be considered, can only be regarded as facts snatched from the very verge of oblivion. The church records that have been saved from fire and war are few, and it has been impossible in some cases to obtain the full maiden name of the wives of the Montagues. The wills on Co. records give only the christian name, and the surname is in some cases lost. This is to be regretted, especially in the case of Cicely, the wife of the emigrant Peter Montague. Printed works of a genealogical character, that relate to Virginia families appear to be rare ; a few there are, which, although written for other objects, contain fragmentary notices of family history ; of such are the 13 Vols, of Hening's Va. law statutes, and Bishop Meades old churches and families of Va. Both of these works have 63625 2 PREFACE. been carefully collated page by page and the latter extensively quoted in this work. A more recent work, and by far the best ever published is \"Va. Genealogies\" by Rev. Horace Edwin Hayden, Wilkes Barre, Pa., 1891, a noble work, that ought to be in the library of every person in the country who is of Va. extraction, or interested in her people. By permission of Mr. Hayden, his work has been quoted, wherever it referred to any person in these pages ; and has been found specially valuable on the line of the Balls, Daniel and other families. The origin of family surnames has been taken from \" Patronimica Britannica \" by M. A. Lower, a standard English authority. The blazon of ancient coats of arms is principally from Edmondson's Heraldry, also a standard English work. The record of arrivals by ship, and early emigrants in the Va. colony is from \" Hottens Emigrant Lists.\" The historical account of the early set- tlements in Va., is taken from various authors and from Hists. of Va. both English and American. The Introduction, and also all that relates to different families in this work in ancient times in England, has been compiled from many hundred old, and rare books, and is the result of great labor cover- ing years of time and search. With the exception of the name of Montague, perhaps no name occurs so often in this book as the name of Latane. The mode of spelling used, is from the signature of Rev. Lewis Latane to his last will and testament, and the same spelling is used by Bishop Meade in his \" old families of Va.\" The accent is upon the final \" e \" which has the sound of a. The name \" Currie \" has been perpetuated, in many branches, and descendants have written it, both \"Curry\" and \" Cirney.\" The dates of birth and marriage of the children and grand-children of the emigrant Peter Montague, and of other early branches, against which is the word \" about \" are only approximate. No claim is made for their correctness except as qualified by the word \" about.\" Every possible effort has been made to avoid error, and yet no doubt errors will be found. A portion of the work consists of ground never before gone over with no guide except Co. records, and but few of them. Sources from which to seek information were few and uncertain. Parties written to were, in some cases slow to reply ; and the replies of different members of the same branch were sometimes contradic- tory. Those who discover errors, while they criticize, should remem- ber that if the work serves no other purpose, it will be a foundation PREFACE. 3 and guide to some historian of the family in the far distant future who may issue a second and more perfect edition, and correct the errors made in this. Many thanks are due to all those who aided the compiler by send- ing valuable records and other information. It is found that they are too numerous for special mention by name, but particular mention should be made in this connection of Hon. Wm. M. Flanagan [699], Miss M. Ellen Brown [241 1], Mr. and Mrs. Paul Caine [3376], Mr. and Mrs. Robert Daniel and family [1103], the venerable Judge B. J. Peters, Judge of the court of Appeals, Mount Sterling, Ky. and Rev. Horace Edwin Hayden of Wilkes Barre, Pa., the latter of whom has been a faithful friend during its entire compilation. Special thanks are tendered to all those who so nobly responded to the call for a fund in advance, to aid its publication, without which it could not have been issued. Many thanks are hereby tendered to all those who have furnished the beautiful portraits with which the work is embellished, and to the artists who made them Mr. W. P. Allen of Gardner, Mass., and the Suffolk Engraving Co. of Boston. Special thanks are due the venerable Dr. J. Packard, D. D., of Theological seminary, Fairfax Co., Va., for records of ancient Christ Church. Special thanks are due the various Co. clerks for Court House records and prompt attention to letters sent to them, of whom, special men- tion should be made, of Mr. Harrison Southworth of Essex, Mr. Samuel P. Gresham of Lancaster and Mr. B. B. drowning of Mid- dlesex, who generously gave both his office room, and his own time, for my use and benefit. Special thanks are tendered to Dr. Edmund J. Lee of Philadelphia, Pa., Mr. R. B. Lee of Richmond and Mr. J. Henry Lea of Fairhaven,Mass. for valuable Lee records. The descend- ants of Mickelborough Montague, No. 58 in this work was compiled by his grandson Mr. A. M. McClenny in 1884 and was published in 1886 in the work called \" The Montague Family of America.\" It has been revised and brought down to date for this work, as perfectly as has been possible. Finally, the compiler wishes to express his thanks to Messrs. Car- penter & Morehouse and their corps of able assistants, who printed the work, all of whom seemed to be inspired with an interest in the. undertaking almost equal to that of the compiler himself. George Wm. Montague. Amherst, Mass., Oct., i8g4. EXPLANATION. The index refers to the numbers, not to the pages. Thus, against the name of Joseph S. Montague in the index is the number 2658. Turn to small number 2658 in the book and it will be seen that he was the son of Archibald P., number 1253, who was the son of Sam- uel 396. Turn to small number 396 and it will be seen that Samuel 396 was the son of Young 117, who was the son of Latane34. Now turn to small number 34 and it will be seen that Latane was the son of Abraham 14 who was the son of William 10. Turn to small number 10 and it will be seen that William was the son of Peter 4, who was the son of Peter No. 1. By following this plan, any name can be traced forward, or back, at pleasure. To find the relationship existing between any two persons, trace the line of each back until they unite at the same ancestor. ABBREVIATIONS. Ae. — aged. H. — Va. Gen. by Rev. Horace E.

The beautiful plate of Arms which faces the title page is a copy of an oil painting in original colors made by Tiffany & Co., New York and owned by Mr. Henry Montague Robertson of New York City, who kindly permitted it to be copied for this work. It is not a fancy sketch prepared to please the eye, but it is the correct paternal coat of arms of every Montague descended from Peter No. i, and can be used by all of the female line [or collateral branches] by placing it as a quartering only upon their shield to indicate their descent from Montague. The word blazon in Armory means a written description so precise as to enable the reader to depict the escutcheon without other assistance. The blazon of these arms is as follows : Quarterly — first, argent, three fusils in fess gules between three pellets, for Peter Montague, No. i; the same being the paternal arms of his father Peter Montague of Boveney, Eng. Second — Azure, a griffin segreant, or. for original Montague arms. Thus borne by the first eight generations in England [A. D. 1066 to 1300]. Third — Gules, three legs, armed proper,, with banded mail of the 13th century, conjoined in the centre at the upper part of the thighs, flexiden, a triangle, garnished and spurred, or. for Fergus, King of the isle of Man. These arms are a Heraldic curiosity, and are inherited by Va. Montagues from their great ancestress Aufricia, wife of Sir Simon Montague [No. 8, in Introduction] and dau. of Fergus, King of Man. Fourth — Argent, three fusils in fess gules, for Sir Simon Montague of A. D. 1300, being the same as the first quarter without the pellets which were added for difference of families. The combination of these quarters, as here rep- resented, is well known and is not new. See plate of the coat of arms of the Duke of Manchester, see quarterings of Anthony Browne, Viscount Montagu, and quarterings of Hastings, Earl of Huntingdon, all in Edmondsons Peerage. See plate of Arms of Anne, wife of King Richard III, in Planche's Pursui- vant of Arms. Crest. — \" The head and wings erased of a griffin, segreant, or. placed over the helmet of an Esquire.\" From the shield of Drogo-de-Montacuto, and dating from the time of William the Conqueror, also similar to the crest found on the garter plate of the first Earl of Salisbury. It is the most ancient Montagu crest known. Supporters. — No degree below that of a Baron was in England entitled to bear Supporters, and although Peter No. 1, was descended from a Baron, 6 EXPLANATION OF FRONTISPIECE. yet it was through younger sons and Supporters were borne only by titled elder sons. But it has been considered appropriate that a purely American family may in America adopt the Segreant griffin of their first English ances- tor Drogo, to uphold their shield, though usually if the sinister Supporter be a griffin, the dexter is composed of some other device. Motto. — It is not known what the motto of the Boveney family was; proba- bly the family flourished in England at so early a date, that mottos had not come into general use; but it may be said that \" Disponendome, non mutando me \" dates back to the time of Henry VIII, and is the most ancient of all the Montagu mottos. It is used in England by the Dukes of Manchester, and is said to have originated with Sir Edward Montagu, the executor of the will of Henry VIII. He was lord chief justice of England. He was removed from that position by Queen Mary, who also imprisoned him in the Tower of Lon- don. After his release, it is said that he added the motto to his Arms in Latin, a free translation of which is, \"You may displace me but you cannot ^change me.\" PORTRAITS.

In the old Chronicles of France, mention is made of forty-seven different incursions by various Scandinavian bands called Northmen. The most important of these, under the command of Rollo the Dane, resulted in the permanent occupation of a large province which was. subsequently called Normandy. \" It was thus the settlement of these northern pirates,\" says Freeman, \" which finally made Gaul French in the modern sense. It was at the same time the alliance with Romanic France which brought the Northmen fully under the influence of French language, law and custom, which made them Normans, the foremost Apostles alike of French chivalry and Latin Christianity.\" In this province and of this people was born on the 14th of October 1024, William, Duke of Normandy, the bold leader in the Norman conquest of England \" the great turning point in the history of the English nation.\" In this province also flourished, one thousand years ago, the Norman family of Montagu. They were seated probably at Montagu- les-Bois in the district of Coutances of which place it was said \" Its ancient lords were famous in the middle ages.\" The name and family of Montagu was probably prominent and distinguished at that time, for we find mountains, castles, fortresses and towns bearing their name. History has at least recorded the name of one of the family who held at that time an important position of trust and honor. I. Drogo de Montagu (or as it was written in Latin, de Monte- acuto, and Montacute) was born about the year 1040. He became the trusted companion, follower, and intimate friend of Robert, earl of Moriton (or Mortain), the favorite brother of William, Duke of Normandy. IO INTRODUCTION. Drogo and the earl of Moriton were of the same age and both entered heartily into the plans of William in his proposed expedition against England. This expedition was in active preparation in the summer of 1066 and was composed of sixty thousand men and over three hundred ships. Drogo de Monte-acuto accompanied the expedition in the immediate retinue of Robert, Earl of Mortain. They landed at Pevensey upon the coast of Sussex, late in Septem- ber, 1066, and immediately burned and scuttled their ships, that their only hope might lie in their courage and resolution, their only safety in victory. * This marked the advent of the first Montague upon the shores of England, and as he marches on toward the plain near Hastings (where, upon the 14th of October, the battle of Hastings was fought and won), we note that he bears the kite shaped shield of the Norman invador, its color is cerulean blue, and upon it is the full length figure of a Griffin, segreant (rampant with wings spread), and painted a bright golden hue. This was the original Coat of Arms of the Montagues in England.^ William having conquered England and ascended the throne his followers were rewarded with large grants of land. Both his favorite brother the Earl of Moriton and his trusty follower Drogo de Monte-acuto received large possessions. Drogo obtained the grant of several Manors, particularly in the county of Somerset. The original castle or seat of Drogo was at Montacute, an eminence and parish in Tintinhull Hundred, Somer- setshire, four miles south from Ilchester. Its ancient name appears to have been Logoresburg and was also called Bishopston. Here the Earl of Mortain built a castle and named it after his friend Drogo de Monte-acuto. (Cappers Topog. Diet.). Camden says of this place that \"the Castle has been quite destroyed these many years and the stones carried off to build the Religious houses and other things, afterward on the very top of the hill was a Chapel made and consecrated to St. Michael, the arch and roof curiously built of hard stone and the ascent to it is around the mountain up stone stairs for near half a mile.\" * A gryphon (or griffin) was an imaginary animal devised by the ancients and consisted of the body and tail of a lion with the head and claws (or talons) of an eagle, thus denoting great strength united with great swiftness. ®tje ^trm« of -pvogi? be ^lonte-acnto, 31. 1>. 1066. \"A griffin of gold, segreant, upon a shield of blue.''' INTRODUCTION. 1 1 A later writer has this graphic description of this spot. \"Adjacent to the churchyard rises that noble mount called Montacute, the base of which contains near twenty acres. Its form is conical and its ascent very steep, the top terminating in a fiat of half an acre whereon stands a round tower sixty feet in height and crowned with an open ballustrade. On this tower is a flag-staff fifty feet high, on which a flag is occasionally displayed floating fifty-six yards in the air and exhibiting a grand and picturesque appearance. The summit of this tower, being so highly elevated above the level of the central part of the country, affords a rich and extensive pros- pect extending westward to the hills below Minehead and Blackdown in Devonshire and north eastward over Taunton, Quantock Hills, Bridgewater bay, the Channel, and coast of Wales. To the north, Brent-Knoll, the whole range of Mendip, the city of Wells and Glastonbury-Torr. Eastward, Creeche. Southward over the Dorsetshire Hills to Lamberts Castle near Lyme, the whole a circle of above 300 miles in which on a clear day 80 churches are distinguished. This hill is planted from bottom to top with oaks, elms, firs and sycamores the intermingled foliage of which (especially in the autumnal season) forms a rich and beautifully tinted scenery.\" While this was the original home of the Montagues, the seat of their barony was at Shepton Montacute a villa at no great distance from Montacute. This parish contains the hamlets of upper and lower Shepton,# Knolle, and Stoney Stoke, and was held by Drogo de Monte-acuto and his direct descendants until the time of King- Henry VIII. when Sir Thomas Montacute leaving no male issue, this estate was divided between three sisters. Drogo de Monte-acute also held of Robert Earl of Moriton, the following Manors. The manor of Yarlinton. (For description see at Sir Simon Montacute, 8th generation). Sutton Montacute, a small parish six miles east from Ivelchester, lying in a fruitful woody vale under the south west brow of Cadbury castle, with other high hills toward the east. It contains thirty houses which compose a long street in the turnpike road from Ivelchester to Castle Cary. Thulbeer, (ancient name Torlaberie). * In Drogo's time, in demesne are two carucates, 8 servants, 8 Villanes (farmers), 5 cot- tagers, 3 ploughs, 2 mills, one not rated, the other pays seven shillings and sixpence. There are 30 acres of meadow, and wood ten furlongs long and four furlongs broad. 12 INTRODUCTION. Drogo held this manor from the Earl of Moriton and it descended through a long line of ancestry together with the manor of Chidzoy, to the unfortunate Edward, son of George Duke of Clarence. Drogo also held of the said Earl one hide* of land in Montagud in this county. Revd John Collinson says, \" it is altogether probable that the Earl of Mortain — if he had any other reason than that of a Latin definition — imposed on his demesnes at Bishopton(Logoresburg) the appelation of Montagud in compliment to this Drogo, his favorite and confidential friend.\" But waving this matter, we find the said Drogo-de-Monte-acuto in possession of these estates until his death, which took place about the latter end of the reign of King Henry I. (about 1125). A curious fact may be here recorded, that upon the spot where the battle of Hastings was fought, William the Conqueror founded an Abbey which was called Battle Abbey, and in the words of his charter, \"Instituted a market to be kept there on the Lord's day free from all toll — \" and that Anthony Viscount Mountague, a lineal descendant of Drogo, about the year 1575 or 1600, built a fine house there and obtained authority of Parliament to have the market changed to another day. Drogo was succeeded by his son and heir — II. William Montacute, who erected a Monastery at Montacute Mountain and endowed it with the borough and Market of Montacute. An ancient record written about 1538 states, that — \" within the ruins of the Castle at Montacute is now a mean house for a farmer, the town hath a poor market and is builded of stone as commonly all towns thereabout be\" — (Leland's Itinerary, Vol. 1, Oxford, 17 10.\") But little is known with regard to this William Montacute except that, one author says — \" he was an only son \" — and that he took care of the estate left him by his father, and died leaving it entire to an only son. III. Richard de Monteacuto, probably the first Richard Montague who ever lived. It is recorded of him, that in the second year of Henry II. (1156) he paid ^20 into the King's exchequer for the ancient pleas; and * A hide of land was supposed to consist of 160 acres and was made up of the following' parts, viz. — ten acres make a ferundel, or fardingdeal, four ferundels make a yard land, and four yard lands make a hide, so four hides it is said, or 640 acres, make a Knight's fee. INTRODUCTION. 1 3 7th of Henry II. (1161) upon the collection of the scutage then levied, he paid 20 marks for the Knight's fees (a yard land of 40 acres paid two shillings and sixpence tax) which he at that time held, soon after which he died, leaving issue his son Drue, who was called \" Drogo Juvenis\" — or Young Drue. IV. Drue de Monteacuto, upon the assessment of the aid for marrying the King's daughter, 12th Henry II. (1167) certified his Knight's fees to be in number — nine, a half and a third part of the old feosment and one of the new* (640 acres made a Knight's fee). He married Aliva, dau. of Alan Basset, baron of Wiccomb in County of Buckingham. After his death she married second, Richard son of Gilbert Talbot, ancestor to the Earls of Shrewsbury. His eldest son, also named Drue, died during his father's lifetime, he married, however, and left two sons, — John and William de Mon- tacute. The younger, William, had no male issue, and but two daughters, namely, Margaret, married to William de Echingham ; and Isabel, married to Thomas de Audhamf . The elder son, John$, was seated at Marsh, in County Buckingham, a manor situated northwest from Alesbury and near the Oxford County line — he m. Lucy # # and had a daughter Katherine, who married Warine Bassett. Drue de Monteacuto and his wife Aliva (Basset) had an only daughter who became a nun at Shaftsbury, and a second son, — V. William de Montacute, who succeeded to the barony, and in the sixth year of Richard I. (1196) paid ^\"6-is-6d for his estates in the County of Somerset as scutage for the King's ransom. He was sheriff of Dorsetshire and Somersetshire in the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth years of King John (1 205-1 209) ; which fully proves his importance at that time, when none but persons of the greatest rank and property were admitted to that office. For the * The fees were thus held William Malherbe, 3 fees, Robert Fitz John 1 fee, Jordon Geul- hame 1 fee, Robert Fitz William 1-2 fee, Helias de Arden 1-2 fee, Hamo 1-2 fee, Thomas de Toire 1-2 fee, Richard Fitz Bernard 1-3 fee, and of the new feosment Will de Montacute 1 fee, Besides 1 fee in Dishcove whereof he was unwarrantably dispossessed by Henry Lovel.

Being one of the great barons of that reign who stood up for the liberties of their country, and being found (17th John) in arms with the rebellious barons against the King, he was stripped of all his lands in Counties of Somerset and Dorset, which were seized by the King and given to Ralph de Ralegh. He died 18th of King John (12 18). He married Isabel, dau. of * * * * and left an only son and heir who succeeded to the estate. VI. William Montacute. This son recovered all of 'the lands which his father had lost. But in the 17th of Henry III. (1233) he also had his lands distrained by Virtue of the King's precept for omitting to repair to Court at the feast of Whitsuntide, there to receive the dignity of Knighthood, as was required by law. But the next year on doing his homage he was by the Sheriff of Somerset and Dorset reinstated in his possessions. He died 31st of Henry III. (1247) leaving issue William his son and heir. VII. William de Montacute, (son of William No. VI.), had summons to attend the King into Gascony, against Alphonse 10th, King of Castile, who had usurped the province. The 41st of Henry III. (1257) he was summoned to be with the King at Chester on the feast day of St. Peter, ad vinculo, — well furnished with horse and arms, thence to march against Llewellin ap Griffith prince of Wales. 42 d of Henry III. he had a similar citation. By Berta his wife he left issue his son and heir, Simon. VIII. Sir Simon de Montacute (son of William No. VII.) was in several expeditions into WTales, particularly in that of 10th of Edward I. (1286) when Llewellen lost his territory and life. He obtained from Edward I. confirmation of the manor of Shipton Mon- tague in Somersetshire with the woods thereunto belonging in the forest of Selwood and a grant of several other manors in the same county and in those of Dorset, Devon, and Oxford. The same lord Montacute made several campaigns with reputation both in France and Scotland, in the reign of Edwd I., in which he was also Governor of Corffe Castle in Devonshire. In the Reign of Edward II. he again served in Scotland and was governor of the Castle of Beaumaris in the isle of Anglesey, and Admiral of the King's fleet.

The 7th of Edwd II. (13 14) he obtained a license of the King to fortify his Manor house at Yardlington. This Manor was very beautifully situated in a picturesque locality upon a very fine lawn, and remained in this family through many descents until, through the last Countess of Salisbury (who was beheaded at the age of 70 years by Henry VIII.), it passed to the Poles and thence to Henry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham. Sir Simon Monta- cute also owned the Manor of Goat-hill, granted to him by Edw(1 I., and it descended to Gen. Thomas Montacute 4th Earl of Salisbury, thence to Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, and to John Neville, Marquis of Montacute. He also owned the Manor of Laymore in Somerset. This Sir Simon Montacute bore as his Coat of Arms the original shield of his ancestor Drogo First, (Azure — a Gryphon Segreant, or, [gold] as also did his father and each of his ancestors. However, this Sir Simon changed the Arms to \"Argent (white) three fusils* in fess gules (red).\" See plate. It is however recorded that Sir Simon used both Coats of Arms, the one which he had made and the other which he received by inheritance. Fortunately we are not left in doubt as to what Arms he really bore, for the Pope had at that time made unwarranted pretentions with regard to Scotland and had issued an insolent bull, to which all the barons of England had made reply in a letter which was signed by all the Barons, who affixed to their names, as their seals, their Coat of Arms. This letter to Pope Boniface VIII. was written A. D. 1301, and was signed by Sir Simon de Montacute, with the other barons. A duplicate of this letter is preserved in the British Museum, and the plate of the Coat of Arms of. Sir Simon Montague, appended to this work, is copied from his Seal to that letter. These Arms, with some modification for differences in fami- lies, have been the arms of all the succeeding English families of Montague. Sir Simon married Aufricia, dau. of Fergusius, King of the isle of Man, descended from Orry, King of Denmark.

Island and enjoyed it in her right many years. (Camden says it was Simon's son William who recovered the Island.) He had been summoned to parliament from the 28th of Edward I. to the 8th of Edwd II. (13 15), soon after which he died. Their issue was William and Simon de Montacute, the former succeeded his father and continued the line, the latter was married to Hawise, daughter of Almeric lord St. Amand. Almeric de St. Amand was a great baron of that age whose chief seat was at Grendon Underwood, a parish in the hundred of Ashendon in Buckinghamshire ten miles west N. W. from Aylesbury. The male line became extinct and the property passed (through daughters) to other families. It would seem that Simon Montacute and Hawise de St. Amand, his wife, probably had a son whose name was William Montacute from the following passage taken from a very rare and ancient work.^ \" From thence he (the King) passeth on to the Castle of Salisbury which Castle belonged to William Montacute Earl of Salisbury in right of his wife but himself being then prisoner in France, onely his Countesse, and one William Montacute, a cousi?i of his was in the Castle.\" This William Montacute, who is called a cousin of the first Earl of Salisbury, was therefore a son of Simon and Hawise (Amand) Montacute, as it is recorded that the Earl's father had only two sons. As this Simon Montacute was the younger son, his subsequent history (and that of his son William) is unrecorded. IX. William, lord of Montacute, eldest son of Sir Simon de Montacute (No. VIII.), served in several expeditions into Scotland, both before and after his father's death, in the reigns of Edward I. and II. In the former he also received the honor of Knighthood, along with Edward prince of WTales ; and in the second year of the latter, he obtained the royal charter for free warren at his manor of Aston Clinton in Buckinghamshire, as he did afterward for those of Saxlingham, in the County of Norfolk, Knolle in the County of Som- erset, and Woneford in the County of Devon. In the same reign he was governor of Berhamstead Castle and steward of the King's household ; and had a grant of the bodies and ransoms of Rene ap Grenon, Madock ap Vaughan and Audoen ap Madock, Welsh barons who had rebelled and been taken prisoners. * The work referred to is, \"A Chronicle of the Kings of England by Sir Richd Baker, Knight.\" London, 1660.

In the nth and 12th of that reign he had summons to parliament and died in 1320 in Gascony, but was interred at St. Frideswide, now Christ Church Oxon.# By Elizabeth, dau. of Peter lord Montfort of Beaudefert in the County of Warwick, he had issue four sons and seven daughters. Of his four sons the eldest died in the life time of his father, the second succeeded him, Simon the 3d son in the 8th of Edward III. was made Bishop of Worcester and in 1336 was translated to Ely. He was a great benefactor to the University of Cambridge and laid out a large sum on the fine Lady Chapel, on the north side of the Cathedral of Ely, though he did not live to finish it. Sir Edward Montacute, the 4th son, was governor of the Castle of Werk. He served afterward in the French wars with great reputation. In the 23d of Edward III. (1330), he had livery of all those lands which descended to his wife Alice, dau. and co-heir of Thomas Brotherton, Earl of Norfolk, fifth son of Edward I., and Marshal of England. He died in 1342. * \" William de Montagu, who held the Manor of Aston Clinton, in the County of Bucking- ham, held it of our Lord the King, by grant of Sergeanty, viz.— by the service of finding for our lord the King a lardinerat his own proper costs.\" Harl.

However, Mary, the daughter of Reginald King of Man, addressed her self to the King of England for justice in her case.

Her grandchild, John Waldebeof , notwithstanding this, sued again for his right in Parliament, held 33d of Edward I., urging it there before the King of England as Lord Paramount of Scotland, yet all the answer he could have was that he might prosecute his title before the Justices of the King's Bench ; let it be heard there and let justice be done. But what he could not effect by law his kinsman Sir William Montacute (for he was of the royal family of Man) soon did by force of arms. For having raised a body of English, he drove the Scots out of the Isle with these raw soldiers. But, having plunged himself into debt by the great expense of this war, and become insolvent, he was forced to mortgage the Island to Anthony Bee, Bishop of Durham and Patriarch of Jerusalem ; and make over all the profits thereof to him for seven years, and quickly after, the King gave the Island to the said Anthony for term of life. Afterward King Edward II. gave it to his great favorite Peter de Gaveston. Soon after this the Scots recovered it again under the Conduct of Robert Brus.

X. William Montacute, eldest surviving son of William lord Montague (No. IX.), was made a banneret in the end of the reign of Edward II. In the first of Edward III. (1327) he was present at the expedition then made into Scotland, and in the 3d of same reign attended the King when he was summoned to do homage to the King of France for his duchy of Aquitaine. In the 4th year of same reign he again attended the King to France, and had also the honor to wait on his holiness the Pope with Bartholomew de Burgherth, as Edward's ambassador, to thank him for confirming a bull of his predecessor Honorius, in favor of the Monks of Westminster^ But the best service, perhaps, which this brave man ever performed for his master, was his bringing the famous Mortimer Earl of March the Queen's gallant, to punishment* A parliament being held the same year it was enacted that William lord Montacute and all others with him, at the apprehension of the Earl of March and others, since what they did was authorized by the King's command, should be — \"wholly acquitted thereof and of all murders and felonies they have done.\" This act of indemnity was not only passed in his behalf, but many manors and lands forfeited, by the attainder of the Earl of March and others, were bestowed upon him. In the same year (1330) he was also appointed governor of Sher- bourne Castle in the County of Dorset, and of the Castle of Corffe with the Chace of Purbeck. In the 5th of Edward III. he had a charter of free warren in all his lordships of Cookham in County of Berkshire, Swyneston in County of Southampton, Fulmere in County of Bucks and of Cat- sound and Lewisham in Kent. Likewise wreck, waif, stray goods of felons and fugitives, with fines and forfeitures of his tenants in his manors of Christ-church, Twyneham, Ringwood, and Swyneston, in. the Isle of Wight and County of Southampton. Next year he * The lord Montacute, having laid before the young King the infamy which the course of the life of the Queen, his mother, had brought upon his family, and the dangers which Mor- timer's greatness threatened to the Crown, met with a favorable hearing from his Majesty, who ordered him to associate himself with such of the nobility as he could trust, and then apply to Sir William Eland, Constable of the Castle of Nottingham, in which the Queen and Mortimer had shut themselves up for defence. As the Keys of the Castle were brought every night to the Queen and nobody permitted to come in or go out without her knowledge, Sir William Eland directed Montacute and his associates to a private passage, by which they entered the Castle and marched directly to Mortimer's apartment, where the lord Montacute before he could seize his prisoner, was forced to kill Sir Hugh Turplington, steward of the household, and Sir John Monmouth. Mortimer was then made prisoner and carried before the King, and a short time after he was with his chief friends and abettors put to death. INTRODUCTION. 1 9 obtained for John, his son-in-law, a grant of the Castle of Werk, on condition of his fortifying it and keeping it in repair ; and for himself a release of all his Majesty's claim, right and title, in the isle of Man, and its appurtenances for him and his heirs forever. In 1335 he was constituted governor of the Isles Guernsey, Jersey, Sark, Alder- ney, and Seul. In 1336 he was made Constable of the Tower of London, and in consideration of his great expenses in divers services obtained a grant of the forest of Selkirk and Ellerick, with the town and County of Selkirk in Scotland to hold in farm to him and' his heirs. In the same year he also obtained a grant in fee of several manors, lands, and hundreds lying in the Counties Somerset, Dorset, Wilts, and Buckingham. In 1337 he was constituted Admiral of the King's fleet, from the mouth of the Thames westward, and the following year in considera- tion of his faithful services in the Scottish wars, and otherwise, he was advanced to the title and dignity of Earl of Salisbury, with a grant of the annual rent of ^20 out of the profits of that County. The same year he was one of the Commissioners that were sent to the duke of Bavaria to engage him on behalf of Edward against Philip, King of France. Upon his return he was immediately joined with Richard, Earl of Arundel, in the command of a body of troops designed for Scotland, in consequence of which he was present at the memorable siege of the Castle of Dunbar. The same year he attended the King to Brabant and obtained several more grants of lands, castles, fairs and advowsons in the Counties of Oxford, Wilts, Dorset, Somerset, Chester, Norfolk, Suffolk and Lincoln. In 1339 he obtained the King's precept to the lord treasurer and barons of the exchequer for an allowance of five marks each day while he was abroad on his service, and for the reimbursement of all the expenses he was put to thereby. The same year, in consideration of his services both in the field and cabinet, he obtained a grant of the office of Earl Marshal of England. In 1340 he had the command of the army jointly with the Earl of Suffolk. These two commanders having laid siege to Lisle, then in possession of the French, were both unfortunately made prisoners by the besieged, who sallied out and drew them after them into the town. During their captivity they suffered great indignities ; and upon their arrival at Paris would certainly have been put to death, had not the King of Bohemia (possibly a relative of his wife) interposed in their 2 0 INTRODUCTION. behalf. Upon a conclusion of a truce with France they were exchanged for the Earl of Murray and ^\"3000 in addition. The Earl of Salisbury, immediately after his release, went with many other English Knights into Spain and joined the army of Alphonsus against the Saracens. In 1 341 he was again in Flanders, and in 1342 in France. In 1343 he served upon the borders of Scotland with the Earl of Ulster. And about this time he conquered the isle of Man, when King Edward (having before given him the inheritance thereof) crowned him King of Man. In conjunction with Robert of Artois, he had the command of the forces sent to France in aid of the Countess of Mountfort, by sea and land ; where, after defeating the French fleet, they took Vannes, but a truce having been concluded for three years the Earl returned to England, where he exercised himself so immoderately, in justs and tournaments, that he fell into a fever of which he died in the forty- third year of his age, January 30, ^44, and was buried at the White Friars in London^ (Vol. 1, p. 51, Edmondson's Heraldry). He was possessed at his death of a vast estate and bore the titles of Earl of Salisbury, King of Man, and lord of Denbigh. Vol. 1, p. 51, Glover's ordinary of Arms, Edmondson's Heraldry, says, this earl owned Fulmere in Buckinghamshire. Lipscombe's Hist, of Bucks says, he sold it, in or before 1335. This was a hamlet and Chapelry of Datchet in Stoke Hund. Bucks, near Stoke Poges and not far from Boveney. This great man, who died so young and who also accomplished so much in his busy career, also found time to establish at Bisham in Berkshire, on the banks of the Thames 4 miles from Maidenhead, a Monastery, and he also founded a priory (in 1338) for Canons of the order of St. Augustine, in the words of his charter, \" dedicated to Our Lord and the Virgin.\" This priory was re-founded by Henry VIII. for an abbot and 13 Benedictine Monks. Here Henry VIII. * Some authors state, that this great man was buried at Bisham priory which he had founded. This error probably was caused by the fact that his son built a magnificent monu- ment to his memory, in that Abbey, which was however demolished by Henry VIII. at the dissolution. Not only Edmondson's Heraldry but Glover's Ordinary of Arms, and also the very high authority of Dugdalc, assert that he was buried at White Friars, London. Ed- mondson's Heraldry, Vol. i, 51, states that he became 21 years old in the 19th of Edward II., which would place his birth A. D. 1304; the same authority also states, that he owned the Manor of Cookham in Berkshire. Lipscombe's Bucks states that the hamlet of Boveney anciently belonged to Cookham in Berkshire, and the inference is that this Earl of Salisbury may have been possessed of Boveney also. INTRODUCTION. 2 I « confined one of his wives; afterward, it was a favorite resort of Queen Elizabeth ; here was buried the wife of the founder, Katherine de Grandison, the Countess of Salisbury, and the inscription upon her tomb stated, that her father was \" descended out of Burgundy, cousin german to the Emperor of Constantinople, the King of Hun- gary and Duke of Bavaria.\" Here William Montacute, the 2d Earl of Salisbury (son of the founder), was interred. By his will he directed that a monument should there be erected to the memory of his father, which was done upon a magnificent scale. * His wife Catherine was daughter of William (and sister and heir to Otho) lord Grandison by Sibylla, dau. and heir of John de Tregoz, a great Baron. She was a brave woman, worthy of such a brave and noble man as was her husband the Earl of Salisbury. Shef nobly defended and aided with heroic valor the defence of the castle of Werk, with her husband's brother, Sir Edward Montacute, who was its Governor, and also bravely defended her own Castle of Salisbury from King David of Scotland, with the aid of William Montacute, her husband's cousin, while her husband was a prisoner of war in France as before mentioned in the history of Sir Simon No. IX. They bad seven children, three sons and four daughters. Of the sons, William, the eldest, succeeded his father and became the second Earl of Salisbury, but was killed in a tilting match at Windsor.

Knighthood by Sir N. Nicholas. Rambles about Eton and Harrow, by Alfred Rimmer, London, 1882, et al. 2 2 INTRODUCTION. XI. William Montacute, second Earl of Salisbury, eldest son of William the first Earl, was born in June, 1328. Before he was of age he was Knighted when Edward landed at La Hague. He after- ward served at the siege of Caen, and at the glorious battle of Crecy. When the Order of the Garter was instituted he was the seventh of its original knights, and when the Black Prince obtained Aquitaine he attended him to France and served under him in all his excursions and expeditions. At the battle of Poitiers he commanded the rear of the English army, and was highly instrumental in gaining that famous victory. In short, almost his whole life was a perpetual campaign under Edward III. and his son, the Black Prince. In the succeeding reign, he was continued in all his posts and preferments, and also made governor of Calais, whence he harrassed the French with continual excursions. In the fifth of that reign he convoyed to England the King's intended Consort, daughter of Charles, King of the Romans, and in the seventh and eighth he served against the Scots. In the ninth, a grant was made to him during life, of the custody of the Isle of Wight and Castle of Caris- brook. In the twentieth, the year 1397, he departed this life, having ordered by his will, that every day until his corpse should be interred at Bisham, distribution should be made of one pound five shillings to three hundred poor people ; likewise that twenty poor men should bear torches on the day of his funeral, each torch eight pounds weight, and each of them wearing a gown of black cloth with a red hood ; also, that there should be nine wax lights about his corpse, and upon every pillar of the church there should be fixed banners of his arms ; moreover that £30 should be given to the religious, to sing trentals and pray for his soul. He first married Joan, who by way of distinction was called Fair Maid of Kent, daughter to Edmund Plantagenet, Earl of Kent, but having been separated from her upon a petition from Sir Thomas Holland to the Pope, in which he alleged that she had been pre-con- tracted to him, his lordship married second, Elizabeth, dau. and co-heir of John lord Mohun, one of the original Knights of the Garter by whom he had a son who died without issue, having been accident- ally killed by his father in a tilting at Windsor in the year 1383. This son was named Sir William Montague and married Elizabeth, dau. of Richard Fitz Alan, Earl of Arundel. His widow married in 1388 Thomas lord Mowbray, Earl Marshal of England. INTRODUCTION. 23 Sir John Montacute, the brother of this Earl, married Margaret, dau. and heir of Sir Thomas Monthermer son of Joan of Acres, dau. of King Edward L, in whose right he had summons to Parliament from the 31st of Edward to the 13th year of Richard II., when he died. He had three sons, John his heir (who became 3d Earl of Salisbury), Thomas Montague, Dean of Salisbury, and Richard Montague, of whose issue there is no trace. This Richard lived about the year 1400. None of the English genealogies make any further mention of him except to state his name. It is claimed that there was also a fourth son, whose name was Simon Montague, and from him the nobility of England of this name claim descent. Collins' Peerage, however, states that there is no evidence that this Simon ever lived, and is inclined to the belief that the nobility are descended from James Montague, a natural son of Gen'l Thomas Montacute, 4th Earl of Salisbury. This James Montague had large possessions in County Kent, where he was a man of distinction, and is buried in the Church of Ludsdown in Kent. Sir John Montacute had also three daughters, Sybil, Catherine and Margaret. XII. Sir John Montacute, third Earl of Salisbury (and eldest son of Sir John), was thirty-nine years of age at his father's decease, and forty when his uncle died. He was early engaged in a military life and had been in most of the memorable battles during the reign of Edward III. In the 15th year of Richard II. he obtained leave to serve in Prussia and from the 16th year until he became Earl of Salisbury, was summoned to parliament as a baron, after which he not only had livery of all the lands of which his Uncle died possessed (as he had before of those of his mother, dau. and heir of Thomas lord Monthermer), but also obtained a grant to himself and his heirs, of several Manors in the Counties of Worcester and Norfolk. This Earl of Salisbury was the only temporal Nobleman, who remained firm to King Richard's interest after the invasion of the duke of Lancaster, and even when Richard was deposed, and the duke had mounted the throne, he joined in a plan for the murder of the latter, which being discovered, he and the earl of Kent were pursued to a village near Cirencester where the rabble struck off their heads and sent them to London. His body was buried at Bisham Abbey (which his ancestor the first Earl had founded) by the side of the second Earl of Salisbury, having been removed thither by order of his widow. 24 INTRODUCTION. He married Maude, dau. of Sir Adam Francis, Knight (she was the widow, first of John Aubrey, second of Sir Allan Boxhull, Knight of the Garter). Their children were, Thomas, the eldest son, who was afterward 4th Earl of Salisbury, Richard, who died without issue, and three daughters, Anne, (3 times married) Margaret, and Elizabeth. XIII. Sir Thomas Montague, Fourth Earl of Salisbury and eldest son of the 3d Earl, was only twelve years of age at his father's death. Though the great estate, of which the last earl had been possessed, was now forfeited, yet a considerable part of it was recov- ered before his son became of age and at last, in the reign of Henry V., he retained a reversion of his father's attainder and was restored in blood. This noble Earl was concerned in so many military exploits, that to give an account of them all, would be to write the history of the reign of Henry V. Suffice to say, that as he lived so he died in the service of his Country, for, having been mortally wounded by a stone, shot from a cannon at the siege of Orleans, he was carried to Meun on the Loire where he departed this life in November, 1428. He was twice married. First to Eleanor, dau. of Thomas Holland, sister of Edmond, Earl of Kent. Second to Alice, dau. of Thomas Chaucer. He had but one child, a daughter Alice. His body was brought to England and interred by the side of his ancestors in the Abbey at Bisham. XIV. Alice Montague, dau. of General Thomas above men- tioned, became at his death Countess of Salisbury. She m. Sir Richard Nevil, who in her right became Earl of Salis- bury. He was the eldest son of Ralph, first Earl of Westmoreland. He followed the York party, was taken prisoner in a battle at Wake- field and beheaded. At his death, their eldest son, Richard Nevil, succeeded to the title of Earl of Salisbury, and, in right of his father, Earl of Warwick. He was that Earl of Warwick, to whom the House of York owe their ascent to the throne. He also bore the titles of lord Monther- mer, great chamberlain and High Admiral of England, lord Warden of the north marches toward Scotland and High Steward of the Duchy of Lancaster, and among his many titles, was also known as \" the King maker.\" He was a man of invincible courage and took delight in dangers, engaged his country in a fresh civil war in which he lost INTRODUCTION. 25 his life. He was slain at the battle of Barnet, 14th April, 1471, though some authors affirm that he was murdered by his own party. John Nevil, the younger of the two sons of Richard and Alice (Montague) Nevil, Earl of Salisbury, was 1st of Edward IV. created Baron Nevil of Montague, and 10th of the same reign, Marquis of Montague. He was slain at the battle of Barnet, (some say murdered) 14717 while endeavoring to succor his brother Richard, Earl of Warwick. They were both laid in state at Westminster, London, and afterward were carried to Bisham Abbey and buried among their ancestors. Richard Nevil, Earl of Salisbury and Warwick, had two daughters, namely, Isabel, married to George, Duke of Clarence, and Anne, married first to Edward, Prince of Wales, son of Henry VI.; second to King Richard III. George, Duke of Clarence, was murdered in a hogshead of wine, leaving his wife Isabel with an only son Edward who was beheaded on Tower hill at the age of fifteen by order of Henry VII., and an only daughter Margaret who became Countess of Salisbury in right of her mother. She was the last Countess of Salisbury and with her death the title became extinct until revived in the person of Cecil, in the year 1605 by King James. The title of Countess of Salisbury had been restored to Margaret by Henry VIII. in full parliament about the fifth year of his reign. Both George, Duke of Clarence, (who was a brother of both King Richard III. and Edward IV.) and his unfortunate son, the young Edward, were taken to Bisham Abbey and buried among their ancestors. Margaret the last Countess of Salisbury, married Sir Richard Pole (also often spelled Poole), and had four sons and one daughter. Ursula, married Henry Stafford, son of the Duke of Buckingham. She was beheaded 27th of May, 23d of Henry VIII. The sons were, Henry Pole, created Baron Montague, Sir Arthur, Sir Jeffray, and Reginald Pole who was Dean of Winburne, then made a Cardinal by Pope Paul III., and afterward Archbishop of Canterbury. He was, for his religion, banished from England by King Henry VIII. He went to Rome and became eminent with Pope Paul III., at whose death he was unanimously chosen Pope, as. his successor. This he refused to accept. \" Thereupon, one night Note.— Page 21, ninth line from bottom of page, \"Sir Simon No. IX.\" should read \" Sir Simon No. VIII.\" 2 6 INTRODUCTION. the Cardinals came unto him, being in bed, and sent him word they came to adore him (which is one special kinde of electing the Pope) but he being awakened and made acquainted with it was firm in his refusal.\" — (Baker's Chronicles). The Cardinals remained with him all night. Her son, Henry Pole, was made Baron Montague in 1504 by King- Henry VII. He married Jane, dau. of Sir George Nevil, lord of Abergeveney. Being connected with a plot to re-instate his brother, Reginald, Cardinal Pole, he was beheaded upon Tower hill in 1538, together with his co-plotters and relatives, Henry Courtney, Marquis of Exeter, and Sir Edward Nevil. Sir Jeffry Pole was concerned in the same plot but gained his pardon by becoming informer. Sir Reginald the Cardinal was chosen to become the husband of Queen Mary (Bloody Mary) to whom he was much attached. He died the 1 8th November, 1558, on the next day after the death of Queen Mary. The mother, Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, now at the age of seventy years, was beheaded by Henry VIII. in the year 15 41. Anne, the other daughter of Richard Nevil, Earl of Salisbury, and Warwick, married as before stated King Richard III. They had one only son Edward whom his uncle, King Edward IV., in the 17th year of his reign created Earl of Salisbury, and Richard his father, usurping the Kingdom, made Prince of Wales. He died young and his mother soon after died, not without suspicion of poison. While King Richard himself perished upon the field of Bosworth. Thus in darkness and blood, and in a violent manner, upon the scaffold, perished the descendants of Alice Montague the gentle and only daughter of General Thomas Montague, fourth and last Earl of Salisbury of the name of Montague, and this branch so prolific in great men, who bathed all England in blood during the dissensions of the Houses of York and Lancaster, became extinct. Their lineage has thus .been traced to its final ending, not because it is supposed the American family were lineally descended from any of these personages who are so well known in history, but because they all lived previous to the year 1550, at which date the will of William Montague, from whom it is known that the American family are descended, was proved, and therefore it would not be out of place to mention their history as descendants of the Earls of Salisbury. Attention will now be directed to the immediate branch of Monta- gues, whose descendants peopled America, and whose names will be found in the body of this work. INTRODUCTION. 27 From the year 1500 to the year 1550, two brothers lived in the County of Buckingham and Parish of Burnham, England. Their names were , William Montague, and John Montague. The younger brother John Montague married Cecily # # # , his will was proved Dec. 26, 1552. His children were Thomas, Edmund, Ursula. Thomas the eldest, called Thomas of Phalley, married Elizabeth #. * * #. His will was dated Jan. 14, 1599. His sons were Abraham, John of Penn (who married Katty) and Thomas. Abraham the eldest was Vicar of Stokes Poges, Buckinghamshire, in 1620. His will was dated in 1629. He had a daughter Elizabeth, m. to Robert Foord, a son Abraham baptized 29 Jan., 1627', buried 4th Jan., 1628. John of Penn had a son William, who married Agnes, and a daughter Ann, who was married in 161 7. The elder brother, I. William Montague, was the ancestor of the Virginia family. He resided at Boveney, parish of Burnham, Buckinghamshire, a hamlet on the Thames, just above Eton college and twenty-three miles from London. He married Joan # *. His will was proved March 21, 1550. His children were (1 .) William Montague (of Bray), whose son was William Montague of Waldeston, Bucks, (2.) Robert, (3.) Alice, (4.) Katherine. II. Robert Montague, the second son, married Margaret, dau. of Roger Cotton of Wardville (probably Warneld), Berkshire. He was buried Jan. 10, 1575. He left two sons, (1.) Lawrence, and (2.) William. Lawrence Montague, the elder, was Vicar of Dorney,# Bucking- hamshire. He vi. Joan, dau. of * * Radcliffe of Wycombe, Bucks. * Dorney is i\\ miles west of Eton, and was an adjoining manor to Boveney, both of these manors seemed to have been owned by the \"Girrard family, and afterward by Charles H. Palmer, whose ancestor, Sir James Palmer, Knight, married the daughter of Sir William Garrard who died in 1607.\" Lysons Magna Brit. Vol. 1, 530. The parish of Burnham was 28 INTRODUCTION. His son, Richard Montague, was born about 1578 at Dorney, educated at Eton and King's college, Cambridge. Having entered into holy orders he was presented to the living of Wotten Courtney in Somerset, afterward became rector of Stamford Rivers in Essex. In 16 16 he was made Dean of Hereford. In 1628 he was consecrated Bishop of Chichester, and translated in 1638 to the See of Norwich, \" Together with his fellowship at Eaton, he held by dispensation a Canonry of Windsor. In the Chapel there, he preached the theolog- ical lectures for eight years successively.\" Wood's Ath. Oxe. He was also for a time Parson of Petworth. He was chaplain to King James I., who remained his firm friend. His published works were numerous. As a churchman, he opposed both Puritans and Roman Catholics. In one of his controversies he wrote a book \" Appello Caesarem,\" for which he was summoned before the House of Commons on a charge of maintaining Arminean and popish errors. He was censured by the Speaker and was obliged to give bail of ^2000, for his appear- ance. His books were ordered to be burned by the common hangman. His bail bond was signed by the Duke of Buckingham and his sister. Though prosecuted by parliament, the King (James) remained his friend and patron and continued to advance him to higher preferments. At Eton college he assisted Sir Henry Savile and in 16 10 edited several orations of St. Gregory Nazianzen which were published that year. The history of Eton college says of him, \"that he was admitted Fellow in 16 13, was connected with the Greek press at Eton, and revised the proof sheets of St. Chrysostom.\" Laud describes him as a \" very good scholar and a right honest man, a man every way able to do God, his Majesty, and the church of England great service.\" James I., no mean judge, considered him competent to enter the lists against such formidable opponents as Cardinal Baronius and John Selden, at different times. The last years of Montague's life were spent in what he describes divided into five districts called \"liberties,\" namely Brightwell, Chippenham, Boveney, Wood and East Burnham. After the dissolution of Monasteries by Henry VIII., Boveney was united to the Paules of Braywick. It appears to have been well wooded with trees as it is recorded that much of the timber for building Eton College mostly Elm was obtained there, and at a later date, Lipscombe says, \" The woods of Boveney were sufficient for 60 hogs, there was land for one team which was kept there, with one Villein (farmer) and a car- acate of pasture which was estimated always at 10 shillings.\" INTRODUCTION. 29 as the effort \" to stand in the gappe against Puritanisme and Popery, the Scilla and Charybdis of ancient piety.\" A sermon preached by him as Canon of Windsor, before the King in 162 1, aroused the suspicions of the Puritan party who accused him of supporting the Invocation of Saints. His vindication of the sermon showed that he was not to be daunted by threats, and he wrote to his friend Cosin : \"Me temerarhim, that provokes enimyes on all sides, Puritans, Papists, Lawyers, hell and all. ' Dulichii Samiique et quos tulit alta Zacynthus, Turba ruunt in me.' So you heare, so you say .... I am redy not only to be bound but sw ®ew to dye for the church. I shall never faile the church of England but usque ad aras do my best to uphold the doctrine and discipline ther.\" Three years later Montague fell into controversy with the Roman- ists, in consequence of his having found some of their emissaries attempting to make proselytes in his county parish. Fuller says of him, that \" his great parts were attended with a tartness of writing ; very sharp the nib of his pen, and much gall mingled in his ink, against such as opposed him. However such the equability of the sharpness of his style, he was impartial therein ; be he ancient or modern writer, papist or protestant, that stood in his way, they should all equally taste thereof.\" In speaking of the Roman \"Gag for the new Gospell,\" Montague says, \"answere it I have, bitterly and tartly I confesse, which I did purposely, because the asse deserved so to be rub'd.\" It so happened however that his mode of conducting the controversy infuriated the Puritans even more than his Romanist antagonists, as he surrendered, without a blow, many positions which had hitherto been warmly contested. Like the earlier English Reformers, he appealed to Holy Scripture as interpreted by the Primitive church and General Councils, but he did so with a wider knowledge of Patristic theology than any of them had possessed. He refused to brand th^ Pope as Antichrist ; he defended the use of the sign of the cross, of images, and of auricular confession ; and he maintained high views as to the efficacy of the Sacraments. Montague was protected from his enemies by the influence of the King and by the dissolution of Parliament. His utter repudiation of Calvanism would at one time, have got him into trouble at Court, but, such is the irony of fate, he was appointed Bishop of Chichester in 30 INTRODUCTION. 1628, on the death of Carleton. This was four years after his resignation of the Eton Fellowship.\" He was an excellent scholar, and Selden himself, his great antag- onist, owns him to have been a man well skilled in ancient learning. He died of the ague, April 13, 1641, and was buried in his own Cathedral at Norwich. He had a son Richard, and a daughter married to D. Stokes, D. D. They had a son Richard Stokes, M. D. III. William Montague, second son of Robert, and brother of Lawrence, married Margaret, dau. of John Malthouse of Binfield, Berkshire. Their children were : (1.) William Montague of Boveney, M.

INTRODUCTION. 3 1 It will be noticed that the arms of the Boveney family are the same as the arms of Sir Simon Montacute who signed the Baron's letter (compare plates of both arms), except that to the former there have been added three ogresses. The ogresses may have been added for difference in family, or they may (as it has been expressed by a gentleman in London who bears the name) have been added to mark some deed done at some time, such as a large donation of land to the church, as the church at Boveney bears such a record. Perhaps they may have been added as a part of the maternal arms of William Montague, son of Robert, for his mother was Margaret, dau. of Roger Cotton. And the Arms of one family of Cotton were, \"Argent a bend Sable between three ogresses.\" Whatever may have been the origin of these pellets, the fact still remains, that the Boveney family bear the Arms of Sir Simon Mon- tague of A. D. 1300, which Arms were also borne by his son lord William Montacute and by his grandson the first Earl of Salisbury. Heraldry, or more properly Armory, is the short hand of History, its purpose wras to identify persons and property and to record descent and alliance. Hundreds of persons may be entitled to the same initials, may possess precisely the same names ; but only the members of a particular family can lawfully bear certain armorial ensigns, and the various branches of even that family have their separate differences to distinguish one from the other. The Boveney family bear the same name as the descendants of Drogo. They were residing in A. D. 1500 in the same locality and county of England where the descendants of Drogo had held possession and manors in A. D. 1400 and for centuries before. They bear the same Arms which alone would seem to silently but surely denote that they are a branch of the same family. Where and when the separation took place is not known, but it would seem whose will was proved A. D. 1550, down to Richard and Peter who went to America, was obtained by Mr. William H. Montague of Boston — one of the founders, and for many years Secretary of the New England Historical and Genealogical Society, to whose early labors, in behalf of this work, which date back as far as 1847, the American family must ever be indebted. For he employed at considerable expense H. G. Somerby, Esq., an eminent genealogist, and an American resident in London, who made verbatim copy of the Pedigree of this family from 1550 from the Records in the Herald's College, London, and also went to Boveney, Buckinghamshire, and compared and copied the Parish Records, thus bringing the pedigree down to the year 1634. 32 INTRODUCTION. probable that the Boveney branch left the main stem, after the year 1300 and before the year 1400, or between those dates, for their Coat of Arms was not in existence until adopted by Sir Simon Mon- tacute A. D. 1300, and had they separated previous to that date, their Arms should have been \"Azure a griffin segreant, Or.\" Again the Arms of the Montagues, after A. D. 1400, who were descended from the 3d Earl of Salisbury, have been quartered with those of the Monthermers, which were \"an eagle displayed, vert,\" while the Boveney branch retains the ancient shield of Sir Simon Montacute There are several places where such separation seems possible. At Simon (9th generation from Drogo), who married Hawise de St. Amand and had a son William Montague. Again at the third and youngest son of the first Earl of Salisbury, namely Robert Montague, of whose history nothing has been found. The pedigree is clear and perfect from the American branch (1634) back to A. D. 1500 and lacks (from there) two generations, possibly three, to make a perfect record back to the conquest of England, A. D. 1066. Montagu, a Royal Name. Many branches of the Montagues in America, have the tradition that the name Montague is a \" royal \" name. There is some truth in the tradition. The name in England, however, has not only been descended from royalty, but it has a higher and more lofty signifi- cance, for the Montagues were the parents and ancestors of Kings. As it way be of interest to many of the name and blood, to know exactly how the name has been connected with royalty in ancient times, the following has been carefully compiled, and will be found sufficiently complete to justify the tradition. Sir Simon Montagu, the 8th in lineal descent from Drogo, (the first, of the name in England) married Aufricia, dau. of Fergus, King of the Isle of Man, descended from Orry, King of Denmark. He became in her right King of Man, and both the isle, and the title as King of the isle, descended to his son and grandson. Sir Edward Montagu, one of the grandsons of Sir Simon, was a great warrior of his day, was Governor of the Castle of Werk, when \"Argent, three fttsils in fess gules, betrveen three pellets {or ogresses).^ THESE ARMS FROM THE HERALDS VISITATION OF BUCKINGHAMSHIRE, HERALD'S COL- LEGE, LONDON, BY RICHARD ST. GEORGE CLARENCEUX, A. D., 1634. The Blazon of these Arms may be found in Edmondson's Heraldry, in Burke's Encyclo- pedia of Heraldry. Burke's Ordinary of Arms, and in almost any Dictionary of Arms or Heraldry. INTRODUCTION. 33 that Castle endured a memorable siege by King David of Scotland in 1342. He married Alice, dau. of Thomas Plantagenet, Earl of Norfolk, son of King Edward I. by his second Queen, Margaret, dau. of Philip III., or the Hardy, of France. He was called Thomas of Brotherton, because he was born at Brotherton in Yorkshire. Having received, with his title of Earl of Norfolk, the Vast Estates of Roger Bigod the last Earl of Norfolk, he was one of the richest men in Eng- land, and his Estates were divided at his death between his two daughters [his only children] Margaret and Alice. He was the founder of Reddenhall church, Earsham Hundred, Co. Norfolk, built of free stone, which in 1770 had the finest Tower of any Co. Parish church in England. His younger daughter, Alice, was born in 1323 and married Sir Edward Montagu in 1344. She brought as her marriage portion to Sir Edward, (among other manors) the manors of Reddenhall, and also Ditchingham Hall, Lodden Hund, Norfolk. Their issue was Edward Montague who held Reddenhall Manor in 1360, but died in 1365, and Etheldred his sister possessed the manor. She married in 1390 Sir Hugh Strauley, Kt. The eldest dau. of Edward and Alice Montagu was Joan. In 1360 she was the wife of William de UfTord, Earl of Suffolk. He was the son of Robert UfTord, Earl of Suffolk, who was the son of Robert steward of the King's House under Edward II. by Cecillia de Valoniis, Lady of Orford. William and Joan had four sons, all died by an untimely death, and William de UfTord himself, in 138 1, as he was going to report the opinion of the House of Commons in Parliament, suddenly fell down dead as he was going up stairs to the Upper House. Margaret, the other dau. of Thomas of Brotherton, and sister of the Lady Alice Montagu, was called Lady Marshall and Countess of Norfolk, she was created Duchess of Norfolk for life, by King Richard II. She married John, lord Segrave, with whom she lived unhappily and traveled all the way to Rome to see the Pope and obtain a divorce. She married (2) Sir Walter Manney, Knight of the Garter, and died March 24, 1399. By her first marriage, Thomas, lord Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk in 1401, was her grandson; he was beheaded at York, with Richard Scrope Archbishop of Canterbury in 1405, but from him was descended the Lady Anne Bolin, wife of King Henry VIII. and mother of Queen Elizabeth. Anne Bolin was thus lineally descended from King Edward I. She was also a Mon- tagu, by the following line of descent : Anne, dau. of Sir John 34 INTRODUCTION. Montagu, 3d Earl of Salisbury, married Sir Richard Hankford and had a dau. Anne, who married Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond, whose dau. Margaret became the wife of William Bolin, and the mother of Sir Thomas Bolin who was the father of Anne Bolin wife of King Henry VIII. and mother of Queen Elizabeth. This Queen was then of Montague blood both through her father Henry VIII. and also through her mother Anne Bolin. The following is from Hasted's Hist, of Co. Kent, Vol. XL, p. 92 : \"Queen Elizabeth was in 1 56 1 presented with a pair of silk stockings by her silk woman, Mrs. Montague, and afterward she never wore cloth ones again.\" Who this Mrs. Montague was it is difficult to say but it is known that Sir Edward Montagu, Chief Justice of the King's Bench and Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, was one of the Executors of the will of King Henry VIII. and also guardian of his son Edward who succeeded him as King Edward VI. This Edward Montague was three times married, and the father of seventeen children. The elder brother of Sir Edward Montagu (who married Alice) was Sir William Montagu, Ambassador to the Pope, Baron of Denbeigh, Governor of Sherburn and Corrle Castles, Governor of the isles of Guernsey, Jersey, Sark and Alderney, Constable of the Tower of London, and had his crest of an eagle given him by the King*. See Note. Admiral of the fleet, Earl of Salisbury, Ambassador to the Duke of Bavaria, Appointed Earl Marshall of England for life, King of Man, Member of Parliament, and one of the founders of the Royal Order of Knights of the Garter. This great man married Catherine, dau. of William, lord Grandison, descended out of Burgundy, cousin german to the Emperor of Constantinople, the King of Hungary and Duke of Bavaria. She was a lady of great beauty, and history records that she was as good as she was beautiful. Upon one occasion while attending a feast at Windsor Castle she was dancing with King Edward III. and lost her garter which the King took up from the floor. Some of the Nobles that stood around were seen to smile, whereupon the King remarked \" that the time should shortly come * The crest of Edward III. was a lion, which has remained the Royal Crest to the present day. The Eagle was a crest which Edward III. distinguishes as his own personal decoration and the granting of it to William Montague was a neat compliment, and kind expression of regard and royal favor, on the part of the King. The Earl Montague, with that delicate sense of honor and the fitness of things which has distinguished the Montagues from that period to the present, immediately re-granted the Eagle crest with great form, to the Young Prince Lionel, his godson, son of the King, and afterward, that Duke of Clarence whose daughter married the Earl Montague's grandson. INTRODUCTION. 35 when the greatest honor imaginable should be paid to that Garter.\"' Thus originated the Royal order of the Knights of the Garter with its motto in French \" Honi soit que mal y pense.\" This order con- sisted of 26 Knights, and the mightiest Princes of Christendom have reputed it a very great honor to be chosen as a member. Lady Sibyl Montagu, eldest dau. of this great Earl of Salisbury, married Edmund, son of Edmund Earl of Arundel. He was of royal blood being descended through Hamlyn Plantagenet and thence from William the Conquerer through his dau. Gundred. Lady Philippa Montagu, second dau. and sister of Sibyl, married Roger Mortimer Earl of March. He was son of Edmund, and grand- son of that Roger Mortimer Earl of March who was put to death by Edward III. as related in another part of this introduction. The son. of Lady Philippa Montague by this marriage, also named Edmund Earl of March, married Philippa, only daughter of Lionel, Duke of Clarence, [third son of King Edward III.] by Lady Elizabeth de Burgh, dau. of William Earl of Ulster. Their son Roger Mortimer Earl of March was direct heir to the Crown of England and was- designed by King Richard as his successor, but he died before the King, leaving issue Edmund and Anne. Edmund was thrown into prison by King Henry IV. who had usurped the Government, and feared Edmund's title to the Crown, where he died of grief and dis- content, leaving his sister Anne to inherit the Crown. Lady Anne Mortimer married Richard Plantagenet, Earl of Cambridge son of Edmund of Langley who was the fifth son of King Edward III. They had an only son, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York, Protector of England, who fell at the battle of Wakefield 1460, leaving the following children (all of Montagu blood) by his wife Cicily, dau. of Ralph Nevill, Earl of Westmoreland, viz.: Edward IV. King of Eng- land; Edmund Earl of Rutland, slain at WTakefield when only 12 years old ; George Duke of Clarence who married Isabel, grand dau. of Alice Montague [dau. of Gen'l Thomas Montagu] and was drowned in a barrel of wine; Richard III., King of England; Anne, married to the Duke of Exeter; Margaret, married to Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy ; and Elizabeth, married to John De-La-Pole, Duke of Suffolk, who had by her, two sons ; John, Earl of Lincoln, Lord Lieut, of Ireland, who was declared heir to the Crown by King Richard III. but lost his life in the battle of Stoke, 1487 ; Edmund Delapole who succeeded his father as Duke of Suffolk in 1491. He 30 INTRODUCTION. being an heir to the Crown was artfully secured in the Tower by King Henry VII. and at last was beheaded in 15 13 by Henry VIII. The Princess Elizabeth, dau of King Edward IV., of Montagu blood as above stated, married Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond, who became Henry VII., King of England, thus uniting the Houses of Lancaster and York, the red rose and the white. She became the mother of King Henry VIII.; also the mother of Margaret, married to King James, IV. of Scotland, who became the grandmother of Mary Queen of Scots ; and also the mother of Elizabeth, married to Lewis the XII, King of France. Thus from the marriage of Philippa Montagu to the Earl of March, there was descended a long line of royal personages that includes the Kings and Queens of England more remote of course, to the present day. Sir William Montagu, eldest son of the great Earl of Salisbury, became the second Earl of Salisbury at the death of his father. He married Joan, dau. of Edmund Plantagenet Earl of Kent, 3d son of King Edward I. This great Earl of Kent, and son of a King, was beheaded at Winchester in 1380, after he had remained upon the scaffold from noon until five o'clock in the evening, waiting for an executioner ; he was so loved by the people that no one was willing to undertake the horrid office, till a malefactor from the Marshalsea was procured to perform it. His daughter Joan was a lady of incom- parable beauty, and on account of her extraordinary beauty was styled \"the Fair Maid of Kent.\" She did not long remain the wife of William Montagu, however, for Sir Thomas Holland sent a petition to Pope Clement VI. alleging that he had a prior contract from her, and that the Earl of Salisbury uujustly withheld her from him, where- upon the Pope gave judgment against the Earl, and the \" Fair Maid of Kent \" was transferred to Sir Thomas Holland who was soon after beheaded, and she became the wife of that immortal hero Edward the Black Prince, eldest son of King Edward III. and by him she became the mother of King Richard II. William Montagu, after his divorce from the \" Fair Maid of Kent,\" married Elizabeth, dau. of John Lord Mohun, one of the Founders of the Knights of the Garter. She was sister of Philippa de Mohun who married Edward Planta- genet, 2d Duke of York, son of Edmund of Langley, 5th son of Edward III. The Lady Mohun, mother of the above Elizabeth, .obtained from her husband so much good ground for the common, or INTRODUCTION. 7>T park, of the town of Dunstor, as she could in one day compass about, going on her naked feet. Sir John Montagu, [brother of Philippa Montagu who married the Earl of March], was Steward of the Household of King Richard II. He was buried in Salisbury Cathedral. He married Margaret, dau. of Thomas Monthermer, grand dau. of Joan of Acres, dau. of King Edward I. Joan of Acres was so called because she was born at Aeon in the Holy Land. She was the dau. of Edward I. by Eleanor, dau. of Ferdinand III. of Spain. There is a romance con- nected with the marriage of Joan of Acres. She married first, Gilbert de Claire the red Earl of Gloucester, after his death she secretly married Ralph de Mont-Hermer who occupied an inferior position in the King's household. The King, her father, was very angry, threw Ralph into prison, but finally forgave him and made him Earl of Gloucester. Their son Thomas was slain in a sea fight in 1340, leaving one only dau. Margaret who became the wife of Sir John Montagu as above stated. Margaret died March 24, 1394, leaving three sons and four daughters. Two of the daughters became nuns ; of the third son Richard Montagu no record has been found. The second son Thomas became Dean of Salisbury and was buried in the Chapel of the Virgin Mary in Salisbury Cathedral. The eldest son Sir John Montagu, became the 3d Earl of Salisbury, and was Earl Marshall of England but at last beheaded. His eldest son Sir Thomas Montagu, Knight of the Garter, became the greatest General of his age. He was the 4th and last Earl of Salisbury and he became such a terror to the French that upon one occasion the entire French army, including the King of France, were put to flight by the mere cry being raised that \" Le-Salisbury is coming! \" He married Eleanor dau. of Thomas Holland, Earl of Kent, she was a grand-daughter of the \" Fair Maid of Kent.\" By this marriage he had an only child, a daughter Alice Montagu who married Richard Nevill Earl of Salis- bury in her right, and she became the mother of that great Earl of Warwick called the \"King-maker\" and \"Whirlwind of England,\" also of John Nevill Marquis of Montagu. She was the grandmother of Isabel, wife of George Duke of Clarence, and of Anne, wife first of Edward son of Henry VI., second, of King Richard III. From her also was descended Edward Earl of Warwick, beheaded at the age of 15 by Henry VII. ; Margaret Countess of Salisbury, beheaded at the age of 70 by Henry VIII., Cardinal Reginald Poole, who was- 3& INTRODUCTION. elected Pope at Rome, and others. Among the descendants of Philippa Montagu not mentioned above, were the two young Princes, sons of King Edward IV., smothered in the Tower of London by order of their Uncle King Richard III. They were Edward, born in the Sanctuary at Westminster and proclaimed King Edvard V. [but never crowned] at the death of his father, though only eleven years old ; and Richard Duke of York, born at Shrewsbury. Various branches of the Montagues in America have the name in their families of \"Mary Wortley \" or the name '\" Wortley \" among .some of their children. It is derived from the celebrated literary lady in England — the lady Mary Wortley Montagu. It becomes of interest, in connection with this work, to know something of this lady, to what family of Montague she was a member, and in what way the Wortleys were connected with the Montagues. On the river Don, in the West-riding of Yorkshire is the town of Wortley, the ancient seat of that family ; the male issue of which expired in Sir Francis Wortley, who devised the greatest part of his estate to Anne New- comen, supposed to be his natural daughter, [Camden p. 723.] She married Sidney Montagu, second son of Edward first Earl of Sand- wich, and brother of Edward Montagu the second Earl of Sandwich. In right of his wife he became lord of Wortley and took the name of Wortley. They had only one son (who lived to manhood) whose name was Edward Wortley Montagu ; he was lord of the Treasury in 1714, also was Ambassador in Turkey and died in 1762. He was a gentleman of great political knowledge and influence, and distin- guished not only as an eloquent and upright member of parliament, but as a friend of Addison. He married in 17 12 Lady Mary, eldest dau. of Evelyn Pierrepoint, Earl and Duke of Kingston. This lady became the celebrated lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Her mother was Mary dau. of William Fielding 3d Earl of Denbigh by a dau. of Sir Robert King, widow of Sir William Meredith. She was not of Montagu descent as far as can be traced. She was born in 1690, received a very learned education in the Greek and Latin classics. In 1 7 16 she accompanied her husband in his embassy to Constanti- nople. To her discernment, Europe is indebted for the introduction of smallpox by inoculation, but before she recommended it she made INTRODUCTION. 39 the first experiment upon her own son, and its success proved the means of disseminating the blessings and the continuation of life to thousands. Upon her return to England she became a great friend of the poet Pope. The letters of Lady Montagu appeared before the public in 1763. She possessed great talent, and inexhaustible powers of language. She died in 1762, leaving one dau. Mary Mon- tagu, Baroness Mountstuart, married to John Stuart, Earl of Bute ; and one only son Edward Wortley Montagu. He was remarkable for his eccentricities. He ran away from school and became a chimney sweep, was restored by accident to his parents, but again he left them to join himself to a fisherman, after which he embarked as a cabin boy for Spain, and hired himself there as a servant to a muleteer. Here he was discovered and prevailed upon to return to his friends, who placed him under the care of a tutor, and with him he visited many foreign countries. On his return he was elected member of parliament, and conducted himself with a propriety becoming his birth and fortune. But soon he again embarked for the East. At Constantinople, he adopted the dress and the manners of the Turks ; he kept a numerous seraglio of wives, he sat cross- legged, he wore a long beard, and behaved with all the pomp of oriental consequence. He died in Italy in 1776 aged about 62. He was an author of books of merit — among them, An Examination into the Causes of Earthquakes — Observations on the Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire — Account of the Mountains of Arabia — besides some interesting papers inserted in the Philosophical transactions. Origin and Antiquity of the Name Montague. The name came into England in the year 1066 from Normandy, and originated in the Latin de monte acuto, meaning \" of or from a sharp or pointed mountain\" [a mountain peak]. It has been written in various forms as de Monte Acuto, Monteacuto, Montacute, Mont- agute, Montaigut, Montaigu, Montagu, Mountagu, Mountague, Montague. There is a mountain in the Pyrenees of considerable height called Montacuto. In the Department of Aisne, in Franc"
