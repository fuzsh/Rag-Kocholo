        "text": "It was mainly through the efforts of Captain Bartholomew Gosnold that an attempt at colonization was made which resulted in making the final first permanent settlement in Virginia, he “having made former voyages (in 1602) to the northern parts of Virginia, and was so pleased with the places he saw, that he solicited all his friends and acquaintances to join with him in an attempt to settle that country.” He finally “prevailed upon Capt. John Smith, Edward Maria Wingfield, Reverend Robert Hunt, and divers others to join with him in the undertaking.” Several of the noblemen, gentry, and merchants joined in the enterprise. Letters patent were obtained from King James I, bearing date 10th of April, 1606, naming certain persons for the “Southern colony,” which settled in Tidewater Virginia, and certain other persons for the “Northern Colony,” which finally settled in New England.\n\n“The Southern,” or “London,” Colony was designed for the city of London, and such as would adventure with them to discover and choose a place of settlement between the degrees of 34th and 41st parallels of latitude. “The Northern,” or “Plymouth,” Company, was appropriated to the cities of Bristol, Exeter, Plymouth, and the western parts of England, and all that would adventure with -them, to make their choice between the degrees of 38th and 45th parallels of latitude, provided there should be at least one hundred miles between the two colonies.\n\nThe Charter from James I, dated April 10, 1606, begins by naming certain “loving and well disposed subjects * * * * that we would vouchsafe unto them our license to make Habitation, Plantation, and to deduce a Colony of sundry of our people unto that Part of America either appertaining unto us, or which are not actually possessed by an Christian Prince or People”\n\nIt granted all the territory between the 34th and 45th degrees of north latitude, and all islands within one hundred miles of coast. The 34th to the 45th parallels extend from a short distance south of Columbia, S. C., to the dividing line between what we know as Vermont and Canada. The strip from the 38th to the 41st parallels, comprising between the mouth of the Potomac to the southern end of Long Island Sound, was embraced in the charters of both the Southern and Northern Companies, and was thus open to settlement by both. Conflict of jurisdiction was avoided by the proviso that neither colony should establish within one hundred miles of any actual occupancy by the other. Half of this territory could be secured to the first who settled upon it and yet there would be one hundred miles left. The actual settlement of the Jamestown colony was begun near the 37th parallel, while the Plymouth colony first settled at the 42nd parallel.\n\nThe Companies were to be governed each by a Council of thirteen persons resident in England. There was likewise to be a council in each colony to govern according to the laws, ordinances and instructions of the King,-he to appoint the Royal Council in England. They had the power to work mines, paying the King one-fifth of the gold and silver, and one-fifteenth of the copper mined. They had the power to coin money, and to levy duty on King’s subjects trading with them.\n\nThe Council in England was empowered to name the Council to reside in Virginia. The President and Council in Virginia were constituted the supreme tribunals in all cases.\n\nMay 23, 1609, a second charter was granted to the London (Virginia) Company, by which it became an entirely distinct corporate body, and was under the management of a Special Royal Council in England, which included individual and corporate bodies of wealth and power.\n\nBy it the power which had formerly been reserved to the King was transferred to the Company-the power of choosing the Supreme Council in England, and also of legislating for the colony. It became a corporate body known as the “Treasurer and Company of Adventurers and Planters of the City of London for the First Colony in Virginia.” The incorporators were fifty city companies of London, and nearly 700 persons, of whom there were knights, peers, ministers, doctors, esquires, gentlemen, captains, merchants, and others.\n\nIt gave the company “all those Lands, Countries, and Territories situate, lying and being in that part of America called Virginia, from the Point of Land called Cape or Point Comfort, all along the sea coast to the Northward 200 miles, and from said Point of Cape Comfort, all along the Sea Coast to the Southward 200 miles, and all that space and circuit of Land, lying from the Sea Coast of the Present aforesaid, up into the land, throughout from Sea to Sea, West and North West, and all the islands lying within 100 miles along the coast of both Seas of the Precinct aforesaid.”\n\nThis charter extended the limits of Virginia to the Pacific Ocean. It embraced the entire northwest of North America; granting 400 miles along the coast-200 miles each way from Old Point Comfort. It supplanted the former president and council, and provided a governor and council instead, and gave them full power to correct, punish, pardon, govern and rule “all subjects as shall adventure in any voyage, or shall inhabit on the Precincts of the said Colony.”\n\nA third Charter by James I, dated March 12, 1612, confirmed and enlarged the privileges which had been granted under former charters, and extended the territory and jurisdiction to all islands and settlements withing 300 miles of the coast of the main land. This added the Bermuda islands, which were soon thereafter sold to some of the members of the Company.\n\nThe colony when first started was a “proprietary” enterprise, and so continued until the second charter-1609-when it became a “corporation,” and so continued under its third charter until the year 1624, when the corporation or company was declared null and void, the corporation dissolved, and the colony placed under the Royal Government of the King of England, and so it continued as “a Royal Province,” until the Revolution, with the exception of the period when it was attempted to grant the whole of Virginia for a period of thirty-one years to a few of the favorites of the Crown, and the period during the short interval of Cromwell’s reign.\n\nOn December 19, 1606, the colonists, composed of men and boys left Blackwalls, England, in three small ships, the Susan Constant, Godspeed and Discovery to make their future home in the wilds of America. They were detained on the coast of England by contrary winds about six weeks. Their voyage to America was by the southern route.\n\n“Your course securely steer,\n\nWest by south forth keep,\n\nRocks, lee shores, nor shoals\n\nWhere Eolus scowls,\n\nYou need not fear,\n\nSo absolute the deep.”\n\n“And cheerfully at sea\n\nSuccess you still entice\n\nTo get the pearl and gold\n\nAnd ours to hold\n\nVirginia,\n\nEarth’s only Paradise.”\n\nThe voyage was long and tedious, consuming more than four months from the start at Blackwalls to the landing at the Capes of Virginia, April 26, 1607.\n\nThomas Studley, one of the “Gentlemen” colonists gives the following list of “names of the first planters left in Virginia,” when Captain Newport returned to England, June 15, 1607.\n\nEdward Maria Wingfield, Capt. John Radcliffe, Capt. John Martin, Capt. Bartholomew Gosnold, Capt. John Smith, Capt. George Kendall. These were the council appointed by the London Company. Winfield was selected as President by this Council for a year.\n\nMr. Robert Hunt, Preacher.\n\nThose listed as “Gentlemen” were George Percie, Anthony Gosnall, Capt. Gabriell Archer, Rob. Ford, William Bruster, Dru Pickhouse, John Brooks, Thos. Sands, John Robinson, Ustis Colovill, Kellam Throgmorton, Nathaniel Powell, Robt. Beberbland, Jeremy Alicock, Thos. Studley, Richard Crofts, Nicholas Houlgrave, Thos. Webbe Jno. Walco, Wm. Tankard, Francis Scarsborough, Edward Brooks, Rich. Dixon, Jno. Martin, Cxeo. Martin, Anthony Gosnold, Thos. Wotton, Surg. Thos. Gore, Francis Midwinter.\n\nThe Carpenters were:\n\nWm. Laxon, Edward Pising, Thos. Emery, Rob. Small.\n\nThe others were listed as follows: Anas Todkill, Jno. Capper, (no occupation indicated).\n\nJames Read, blacksmith; Jonas Profit, sailor; Thos. Cooper, barber; John Herd, bricklayer; Edward Printo, mason; William Love, tailor; Nic Skol, drum.\n\nThe laborers were: John Laydon, Win. Cassen, Geo. Cassen,[5] Thos. Casson, Wm. Rods, Wm. White, Ould Edward, Henry Tauin, Geo. Golding, Jno. Dods, Win. Johnson, Will Unger.\n\nWill Wilkinson, Surgeon.\n\nThe boys were: Sam’1 Collier, Nat. Pocock, Richard Mullin, Jas. Brumfield.\n\nStudley ends the list with the statement that there were “divers others to the number of 105.”\n\nThey were accompanied by between forty and fifty sailors, who were the crews of the three ships.\n\nWhen the colonists embarked upon their journey, they knew not who would be their rulers in the new world. They only knew the expedition was to be in charge of Capt. Newport until Virginia was reached. Sealed orders from the Company naming the first president and council for the colony were given Newport. The evening of their arrival within the Capes of the Chesapeake, the box containing the orders was opened and read, and no doubt great surprise was manifested by some upon reading the name of Capt. John Smith as one of the first Council. During the voyage he had been accused of mutiny by Wingfield and others, and had since then been a prisoner. His trial took place after the colony was established at Jamestown. He was honorably acquitted and his accuser ordered to pay him a large sum of money, which Smith refused to accept for his personal use, and donated to the colony.\n\nThe size of the ships in which these colonists ventured across the wide Atlantic Ocean, indicates the meagre accomodations of the colonists during the four months cruise. A vessel’s tonnage is estimated as 100 cubic feet to the ton, a little less in size than a cord of wood which is 128 cubic feet.\n\nThe tonnage and capacity of each of the three ships were as follows “Susan Constant,'” 100 tons burden, capacity to hold 78 cords of wood.\n\n“Godspeed” 40 tons burden, capacity to hold 31 cords of wood.\n\n“Discovery,” 20 tons burden, capacity to hold 151/2 cords of wood.\n\nFew sailors of the present day would have the temerity to attempt to cross the Atlantic ocean in a vessel of but 20 tons burden.[6]\n\nAn interesting account of this memorable expedition was written by George Percy, or Pereie, a brother of the Earl of Northumberland, in whose honor a county in the Northern Neck of Virginia was named. He was a member of this first expedition to form a permanent settlement. When Captain John Smith returned to England in 1609, Percy was president in his stead, which office he held during “The Starving Time,” in 1610, and later was Lieutenant-Governor. The history of the colony during the days they were seeking a final seating place can best be told in his own recital of those events.\n\nHe described the voyage to Virginia as beginning on Saturday, Dec. 20, 1606, (other writers, Dec. 19), “the fleet fell from London, and the first of January we anchored in the Downer but the winds continued contrarie so long, that we were forced to stay there some time.” He gives an interesting description of the places where the fleet stopped en route to Virginia, and the habits of the aborigines whom the colonists met, and with whom they exchanged trinkets for food. They left the West Indies on the tenth of April, and all went well with the fleet until “the one and twentieth day about five a clocke at night there began a vehement tempest, which lasted all the night, with winds, raine, and thunders in a terrible manner. Wee were forced to lie at Hull (bare poles) that night because wee thought wee had beene neerer land than wee were.” The next three days they sounded the lead for land “but wee could find no ground at a hundred fathom.”\n\n“The sixth and twentieth day of Aprils, about fours a clock in the morning, wee descried the Land of Virginia; the same day wee entered into the Bay of Chesupioc directly, without let or hinderance; there wee landed and discovered a little way, but we could find nothing worth speaking of, but faire meddowes and goodly tall Trees, with such Freshwaters running through the woods, as I was almost ravished at the sight.”\n\n“At night, when wee were going aboard, there came the Savages creeping up on all foures, from the Hills like Beares, with their Bowes in their mouthes, charged us very desperately in the faces, hurt Captaine Gabrill Archer in both his hands, and a sayler (named Mather Morton) in two places of the body very dangerous. After they had spent their Arrowes, and felt the sharpnesse of our shot, they retired into the Woods with great noise, and so left us.”\n\nThe first settlers probably cast their first anchor in Virginia waters some two or three miles westward of the present location of Cape Henry Light House, within the Chesapeake Bay, and nearly on a south line with the inland waters of what is now known as Broad Bay, end its adjoining waters, known as Lynn Haven Bay. This latter named place lies directly south of this anchorage, some seven or eight miles, where on the second day of their arrival they “marched 8 miles up into the land and came to a place where the Indians had beene newly a roasting oysters.”\n\nOn April 29, 1896, the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities put upon the old light house at Cape Henry a bronze tablet with these words upon it:\n\n“Near this spot landed April 26, 1607, Capt. Gabriell Archer, Hon. Geo. S. Percy, Christopher Newport, Bartholomew Gosnold, Edward Maria Wingfield, with 25 others, who calling the place Cape Henry, planted a cross April 29, 1607.\n\n“Del gratis Virginia condita,”\n\nThe “Savages” who gave the colonists this ungracious reception were of the (Chesapeake) Chesupioc tribe whose seat was near the head waters of Lynn Haven Bay. Their hostility was no doubt induced by the belief that the colonists were of the same class of white men who had made prior visits to these shores:[7]\n\n“The seven and twentieth day we began to build up our Shallop: the Gentlemen and Souldiers marched eight miles up into the Land, we could not see a Savage in all that march, we came to a place where they had made a great fire, and had beene newly a roasting Oysters: when they perceived our coming, they fled away to the Mountaines, and left many of the oysters in the fire: we eat some of the oysters, which were very large and delicate in taste.”\n\n“The eighth and twentieth we launched our Shallop, the Captaine and some Gentlemen went in her, and discovered up the Bay, we found a River (Lynn Haven Inlet) on the South side running into the Maine; we entered it and found it very shoal water, not for any Boats to swim: Wee went farther into the Bay, and saw a plaine plot of ground where we went on Land, and found the place five mile in compass, without either Bush or Tree, we saw nothing there but a Cannow, which was made out of the whole tree, which was five and fortie feet by the Rule. Upon this plot of ground we got good store of Mussels and Oysters, which lay on the ground as thick as stones: wee opened some, and found in many of them Peerless. We marched some three or four miles further into the Woods, where we saw great smoakes of fire. We marched to those smoakes and found that the Savages had been burning down the grass, as wee thought either to make their plantation there, or else to give signs to bring their forces together, and to give us battel. We past through excellent ground of Flowers of divers kinds and colours, and as goodly trees as I have ever seen, as Cedar, Cypresse, and other kindes, going a little further we came into a little plat of ground full of fine and beautiful Strawberries, foure times bigger and better than ours in England. All this march we could neither see Savage nor Towne.”\n\nThe same evening towards dusk while attempting to enter James River they struck “Willoughby Spit,” the eastern end of Hampton Roads, where they “found shallow water for a great way,” which put them out of all hopes for getting any higher with their ships, which then “road at the mouth of the River.”\n\nThey rowed to a point of land on the opposite side of Hamton Roads, where they found a channel “with 6, 8, 10, or 12 fathom ,” which put us in good comfort. Therefore we named that point of Land Cape Comfort.”This is now known as” Old Point Comfort,”situated at the entrance to Hampton Roads.\n\n“The nine and twentieth day we set up a crosse at Chesupioc Bay, and named the Cape Henry.\n\nThe colonists brought their ships into the James River and were the invited guests of the Indians to a feast, a dance, and a “smoker,” at the village of Kecoughtan, now the town of Hampton. Here the colonists for the first time came in friendly contact with their new neighbors, and witnessed many strange things. To men reared in the civilized precincts of London, these must have been novel scenes.\n\nThe thirtieth day, we came with our ships to Cape Comfort; where we saw five Savages running on the shoare; presently the Captaine caused the Shallop to be manned, so rowing to the shoare, the captaine called to them in signe of friendship, but they were at first timersome until they saw the Captaine lay his hand on his heart: upon that they laid down their Bowes and Arrowes, and came very boldly to us, making signes to come a shoare to their Towne, which is called by the Savages Kecoughtan (now Hampton). Wee coasted to their Towne, rowing over a River running into the Maine, where these Savages swam over with their Bowes and Arrowes in their mouthes.\n\n“When we came to the other side, there was a many of other Savages which directed us to their Towne, where we were entertained by them very kindly. When we came first a Land they made a doleful noise, laying their faces to the ground, scratching the earth with their miles. We did thinke that they had beene at their idolatry. When they ended their Ceremonies they went into their houses and brought out mats and laid upon the ground, the chiefest of them sate all in a rank: the meanest sort brought us such dainties as they had, and of their bread which they make of their Maiz or Genne wheat, they would not suffer us to eat unlesse we sate down, which we did on a Mat right against them. After we were satisfied they gave us of their- Tobacco, which they tooke in a pipe made artificially of earth as ours are, but far bigger, with the bowie fashioned together with a piece of fine copper. After they had feasted us, they shewed us, in welcome, their manner of dancing, which was in this fashion: one of the Savages standing in the midst singing, beating one hand against mother, all the rest dancing about him, shouting, howling, and stamping against the ground, with many anticke tricks and faces, making noise like so many Wolves or Devils. One thing of them I observed; when they were in their dance they kept stroke with their feet just one with another, but with their hands, faces, and bodies, with another, but with their hands, heads, faces, and bodies, every one of them had a severall gesture: so they continued for the space of an houre. When they had ended their dance, the Captaine gave them Beades and other trifling Jewells. They hang through their eares Fowles legs: they shave the right side of their heads with a shell, the left side they wcare of an ell long tied up with an artificial knot, with a, many of Foules feathers sticking in it. They goe altogether naked, but their privities are covered with Beasts skinnes beset commonly with little bones, or beasts teeth: some paint their bodies blacke, some red, with artificiall knots of sundry lively colours, very beautifull and pleasing to the eye, in a braver fashion than they in the West Indies.”\n\nNotwithstanding this hospitable welcome and generous entertainment by these Indians to the white strangers, Sir Thomas Gates in 1610 drove all this tribe from Kecoughtan (Hampton), and took their lands for the use of a colony which he settled there.\n\nAside from St. Augustine, Florida, and Santa Fe, New Mexico, Hampton is the oldest continuous settlement of a town in America.\n\nThe colonists next met with the king of Paspiha who lived in what is now James City County, and who later gave the colonists the land of Jamestown. While in his company the king of Rappahanna, hearing of the strangers, came in his canoe to extend an invitation to them to visit his town. They visit the king next day, and for the first time in the new world, as they heard an Indian playing a flute, and they learned much of the customs of their new neighbors during this visit.\n\n“The fourth day of May, we came to the King or Werowane of Paspihe: where they entertained us with much welcome: an old Savage made a long Oration, making a foule noise, uttering his speech with a vehement action, but we knew little what they meant. While we were in company with the Paspihes, the Werowance of Rappahanna came from the other side of the River in his Cannoa: he seemed to take displeasure at our being with the Paspihes : he would faine have had us come to his Towne, the Captaine was unwilling: seeing that the day was so far spent he returned backe to his ships for that night.”\n\n“The next day, being the fifth of May, the Werowance of Rappahanna sent a Messenger to have us come to him. We entertained the said Messenger, and gave him trifles which pleased him: Wee manned our shallop with Muskets and Targatiers sufficiently; this said Messenger guided us where our determination was to goe. When we landed, the Werowance of Rappahanna came downe to the water side with all his traine, as goodly men as any I have scene of Savages or Christians; the Werowance coming before them playing on a Flute made of a Reed, with a Crown of Deare’s haire, colloured red, in fashion of a Rose fastened about his knot of haire, and a great Plate of Copper on the other side of his head, with two long Feathers in fashion of a paire of Hornes placed in the midst of his Crowne. His body was painted all with ,Crimson, with a Chaine of Beads about his necke, his face painted blew, besprinkled with silver Ore as we thought (mica dust probably), his cares all behung with Braslets of Pearle, and in either care a Birds Claw through it beset with fine Copper or Gold, he entertained us in so modest a proud fashion, as though he had beene a Prince of Civill government, holding his countenance without laughter or any such ill behaviour; he caused his Mat to be spred on the ground, where bee sate downe with a great Majestic, taking a pipe of Tobacco: the rest of his company standing about him. After he had rested awhile he rose, and made signos to us to come to his Towne. Hee went formost, and all the rest of his people and ourselves followed him up a steepe Hill where his Palace was settled. We passed through the Woods in fine paths, having most pleasant Springs which issued from the Mountains: We also went through the goodliest Corne fielder that there ever seene in any countrey. When we came to Rappahannas Towne, he entertained us in good humanitie.”\n\nThe chief of the Appomattox tribe who lived at what is now Bermuda Hundred, Chesterfield County, bade them defiance, demanding their business upon his territory and desired that they should be gone, but at last permitted their “landing in quietness.”\n\n” The eight of May wee discovered up the River. We landed in the countrey of Apamatica, at our landing, there came many stout and able Savages to resist us with their Bowes and Arrowes, in a most warlike manner, with the swords at their backes beset with sharpe stones, and pieces of iron able to cleave a man in sunder. Amongst the rest one of the chiefest standing before them crosse legged, with his Arrow readie in his Bow in one hand, and taking a Pipe of Tobacco in the other, with a bold uttering of his speech, demanded of us our being there, willing us to bee gone. Wee made signs of peace, which they perceived in the end, and let us land in qnietnesse.”\n\nThey were almost determined to settle at Archers Hope, but finally decide upon a point of land which they afterwards named Jamestown.\n\n“The twelfth day we went backe to our ships, and discovered a point of Land, called Archers Hope, which was sufficient with a little harbour to defend ourselves against an enemy. The soile was good and fruitfull, with excellent good Timber. There are also stores of Vines in bignesse of a mans thigh running up to the tops of the Trees in great abundance. We also did see many Squirrels, Conies, Black Birds with crimson wings, and divers other Fowles and Birds of divers and sundrie colours of crimson.”\n\n“We found store of Turkee nests and many Egges, if it had not beene disliked, because the ship could not ride neere the shoare, we had settled there to all the Collonies contentment.”\n\nThe thirteenth day, we came to our seating place in Paspihans Countrey, some eight miles from the point of Land, which I made mention before; where our shippes doe lie so neare the shoare that they are moored to the Trees in six fathom water.”\n\nThe fourteenth day they completed the landing of men and stores and set to work building fortifications “which they did not finish until the middle of June following.\n\nThus began at Jamestown on May 14th, the first permanent settlement of English speaking people upon the continent of America, and with this small beginning, and upon this small plot of ground sprang the first aspirations for the freedom which culminated in our present form of government.\n\nThey took possession of this land without leave, or license, other than their doubtful chartered authority from the King of England, notwithstanding the lands were occupied by a nearby tribe, known as the Paspihas, whose chief or king generously sent them word by his messengers, who were gorgeously decorated by him for the occasion, that he was coming to visit his white neighbors, and bring them a fat deer and be merry with them.\n\nWhen he last met them, on May 4th, he did not know they would settle upon his lands, nevertheless it does not appear that he objected, for on the fourth day after their seating, Paspiha came to Jamestown accompanied by one hundred of his scantily clothed warriors, but each of them gorgeous with feathers, and paint, to make merry with the whites. The colonists mistrusted the object of the visit because they came armed and instead of making merry with him and his followers, they soon quarreled with one of his men, and beat him severely because he picked up one of their hatchets, perhaps from curiosity. Their treatment so disgusted Paspiha that he “went suddenly away with all his company in great anger.” Before leaving, however, he “made signes that he would give as much land as we would desire to take.” Two days later he sent them a deer. A trick was played upon one of the Indians who came with the deer, by one of the whites setting up a target of wood through which he boastfully shot his arrow; they next set up a target of steel, and upon shooting again he “burst his arrow all to pieces,” at which he was so maddened that he drew another arrow and “bit it in his teeth, and seemed to be in a great rage, so he went away in great anger.”\n\nThis hospitable Savage subsequently, at the instigation of Powhatan, and because of some injustice inflicted upon his tribe by the colonists, laid in wait at the glass house near Jamestown for the purpose of assassinating Captain John Smith. On this occasion, Paspiha nearly succeeded in drowning Smith, but the latter finally conquered the Indian, and was upon the point of running his sword through him, when the savage begged piteously for his life. Smith forced him to march to Jamestown, where he was put in prison, but in a few days he effected his escape.\n\nIn 1610, the colonists under Lord Delaware drove the tribe of Paspiha off their lands, burnt their houses, took the wife and children of this chief prisoners and slew them.[8]\n\nThe Colony selected an inland seating place according to “Instructions.” The colonists overlooked and passed by regions of plenty, where the lands were fertile, and the forests were filled with wild game, and the salt waters teemed with the bounteous stores of nature, and seated instead upon a barren island where the surrounding waters were neither salt nor .fresh. They doubtless were guided in their selection of this seating place by their “Instructions” from the Company, “to be followed on landing.”\n\nWhere it shall please God to send you on the Coast of Virginia, you shall do your best endeavour to find out a safe port in the entrance of some navigable river, making choice of such a one as runneth farthest into the land. When you have made choice of the river on which you mean to settle, be not hasty in loading your vituals and munitions, but first let Captain Newport discover how far that river may be found navigable, that you make selection of the strongest, most wholesome and fertile place, for if you make many removes, besides loss of time, you shall greatly spoil your vituals and your casks.\n\n“But if you choose your place so far up as a bark of 50 tons will float, then you may lay all your provisions ashore with ease, and the better receive the trade of all the countries about you in the land, and such a place you may perchance find a hundred miles from the rivers mouth, and the further up the better, for if you set down near the entrance, except it be in some island that is strong by nature, an enemy that may approach you on even ground may easily put you out; and if he be driven to seek you a hundred miles the land in boats, you shall from both sides of the river where it is narrowest, so beat them with your muskets as they shall never be able to prevail against you.\n\n“Neither must you plant in a low or moist place, because it will prove unhealthful. You shall judge of the good air by the people, for some part of the Coast where the lands are low have their people blear eyed, and with swollen bellies and legs, but if the naturals be strong and clean made it is a sign of a wholesome soil.”\n\nJamestown Island, the final seating place, and the first capital of the colony,[9] lies on the north side of James River, in James City County, within the Tidewater Division known as “The Peninsula,” about thirty-two miles from the mouth of the river. It averages two and a half miles in length and three-quarters miles in breadth-about 1,700 acres. It is surrounded on three sides by James River, and on the north side by Back River, which separates it from the mainland. The island itself, and the surrounding country contains little evidence of the struggles of its early inhabitants. There is standing the ruins of the brick church; a lonely monument to the drudgery, the toil, and the labors of the ninety-one years spent by the colonists in their endeavors to build up and maintain a capital city.[10]\n\nIt was in the “Peniusula Division” of Tidewater Virginia that the colonists laid their greatest hardships and struggles, and the most depressing as well as the most successful and joyous periods of their early history as a colony. It was while Jamestown was the seat of government that they experienced all the sensations of famine, disease, despair, and massacre by the savage natives, to which was added civil war amongst themselves through Bacon’s rebellion which destroyed many homes and made the town a waste place.\n\nCaptain John Smith in one of his narratives, describes the first days of settlement upon Jamestown island: “When I went first to Virginia, I well remember we did hang an awning which is an old sail to three or four trees to shadow us from the sun; our walls were rails of wood, our seats unhewed trees till we cut planks; our pulpit a bar of wood nailed to two neighboring trees; in fine weather we shifted into an old rotten tent, for we had no better. The best of our houses were of the like curiosity but for the most part, much worse workmanship that neither could well defend wind or rain.”\n\nThe great abundance which the colonists found in their new home was described by George Percy, one of the gentlemen colonists in his letter relative to the James River:\n\nThis river which we have discovered is one of the famousest Rivers that ever was found by any Christian, it ebbes and flower a hundred and three score miles where ships of great burthen may harbour in safetie. Wheresoever we landed upon this River, we saw the goodliest Woods as Beach, Oke, Cedar,[11] Cypress, Walnuts, Sassafras, and Vines in great abundance which clusters on in many Trees, and all the grounds bespread with strawberries, mulberries, Rasberries, and Fruits unknowne, there are many branches of this River which runne flowing through the Woods with great plentie of Fish of all kinds, as for Sturgeoon, all the World cannot be compared to it. There is also a great store of Deere both Red and Fallow. There are Bearer, Foxes, Otters, Beavers, Muskrats, and wild beasts unknowne.” Notwithstanding this great abundance, the colonists during their first few years of settlement suffered much for want of food. This was due to the fact that the greater number of them were unfitted by experience, or inclination, to the new surroundings. The majority of them was brought up in cities or towns of England, with no experience in rural life. Many of them were registered as gentlemen-a class between the nobles and peasants,-some of wham were too proud to work and too poor to live without labor. Others were named as mechanics or laborers, but none were experienced in woodcraft, nor in the labors of rural life, nor as sailors nor fishermen.[12]\n\nWhen Smith became president, he put the gentlemen and others to work. He told them “the sick shall not starve, but equally share of all our labours, and every one that gathereth not every day as much as I doe, the next daie shall be set beyond the river and be banished from the fort and live there or starve.”\n\nOne of the colonists, himself a gentleman no doubt, describes the pleasure, and recreation which some of the gentlemen colonists who came with the second expedition to Jamestown, had in chopping trees in the woods under the chosen direction of Captain Smith.\n\n“Amongst the rest he (Smith) had chosen Gabriel Beadell and John Russell, the only two gallants of this last supply, and both proper gentlemen; strange were these pleasures to their conditions, yet lodging, eating, drinking, working, or playing they doeing but as the President, all these things were carried on so pleasantly as within a weeke they became masters (proficient), making it their delight to hear the trees thunder as they fell, but the axes so oft blistered their fingers that every third blow had a loud oath to drowne the echo, for remedy of which sin the President devised how to have every man’s oath numbered, and at night for every oath to have a can of water poured down his sleeve, with which every offender was so washed (himself and all) that a man should scarce hear an oath in a week.”\n\nSir George Percy wrote more of conditions at Jamestown:\n\n“Our men were destroyed with ceverell diseases as Swellings, Fluxes, Burning Fevers, and by Warres, and some departed suddenly, but for the most part they died of famine. There were never Englishmen left in a foreign Countrey in such miserie as wee were in this new discovered Virginia. Our food was but a small can of Barlie sod in Water to five men a day, our drinke cold water taken out of the River, which was at a flood verie salt, at a low tide full of slime and filth, which was the destruction of our men. Thus we lived for a space of five months in this miserable distress. It please God, after a while, to send these people which were our mortall enemies to relieve us with victuals, as Bread, Corne, Fish and Flesh in great plentie, * * * otherwise we had all perished.”\n\nOut of 105 colonists living in June, 1607, sixty-seven died during the following six months. Out of the total of more than 14,000 persons who came to Virginia, from the years 1607 to 1622, only 1,258 were surviving at the time of the Indian massacre by Opechancanough, in 1622. This massacre reduced the colony from 1,258 persons to 911, who survived it.\n\nThey drank the briny, sickening waters from the James River for more than twelve months before digging a well. Their failure to guard and take care of their ship’s cargo of food resulted in its destruction by decay and by rats, and their consequent starvation followed. They paid little or no attention to sanitary precautions within the town, and diseases followed their neglect. They were totally lacking in the experiences required in their new surroundings.\n\nThe origin of government, and of the courts of law from their first beginning in Virginia is a lengthy and interesting study for the student at law, and because of its voluminous proportions will not be closely followed by the writer. It is said that, “as every new law is made to remove some inconvenience the State was subject to before the making of it, and for which no other method of redress was effectual, the law itself is a standing, and the most authentic evidence we can require of the state of things previous to it.”\n\nFrom the very beginning of the settlement, and for at least five years following, the colonists were but the servants of the London Company who transported them to Virginia in its own vessels, and maintained them there at its cost. When they reached Virginia they were divided into groups to work under the supervision of men chosen to direct them in their labors. They were to carry out the orders of the Company “To build and fortify the town, to clear and prepare ground for planting, to explore the rivers,” etc. The advice was: “The way to prosper and achieve good success is to make yourselves all of one mind for the good of your country and your own.” The colony was begun “a kingdom without written laws,” and so continued until the meeting of the first House of Burgess in 1619. Until then they were supposed to be governed by the laws of England, but when the three ships conveying the colony weighed anchor and set sail from Black= wells, the laws of England like many other home comforts were left behind.\n\nFrom 1607 to 1609 the colony was under the immediate control of a president and a council who administered such justice as their wills dictated. The great power vested in this first council and president was manifest upon the return of Captain John Smith to Jamestown after his rescue from death by Pocahontas, in January, 1608. The council then held him responsible for the death of his crew by the Indian Chief Opechanchanough; for this the council condemned him to die, and but for the timely arrival of Capt. Newport from England upon the morning set for smith’s execution, they would have carried their design into effect.\n\nUntil the colony increased red in numbers and expanded in territory, and the individual member could lay claim to the products of his own industry, there was no need for courts of justice such as now exist, because there were neither property nor individual rights to settle.\n\nThe colony from its first settlement in 1607, up to the year 1624 was under the control of the Virginia Company of London-a proprietary government. After that it was a royal government under the control of the Crown of England.\n\nIn 1609 the Company chose the first governor and lieutenant-governor, who superseded the former president; there was also a council. The Company continued to appoint governors until the revocation of its charter in 1621, after which the Executives of Virginia were appointed by the Ding, excepting during the period from 1652 to 1660 when they were elected by the house of Burgesses. The Council were the governor’s advisers in executive matters. They constituted the General Court-the Supreme Court of the Colony-and were also members of the General Assembly, corresponding to the present Senate of the Mate. Sometimes they acted as county lieutenants or commanders-in-chief of their county.\n\nThe first election for a legislative body on the American Continent was held in Virginia, in 1619, when the planters were given a hand in governing themselves through the election of Burgesses-the lower house of Assembly.\n\nIn 1619 Governor Yeardley issued a proclamation in accordance with his “general instructions establishing a Commonwealth,” known as the “Great Charter:” “That all those that were residents at the departure of Sir Thos. Dale (April 1616) should be freed and acquitted from such publique services and labours which formerly they suffered, and that those cruel laws by which we had so long been governed were now abrogated by these free laws which his majesties subjects live under in Englande.” And that they might have a hand in the governing themselves, it was granted that “a general assembly should be held yearly once, whereat were to be present the Governor and Counsell, with two Burgesses from each Plantation freely to be elected by the inhabitants thereof; the Assembly to have power to make and ordaine whatsoever laves and orders should by them be thought good and profitable for our subsistence.”\n\nThe exact date of this first election in America is not known; it is supposed to have been some time in June, 1619.\n\nIn 1619 each town, hundred and plantation was to be incorporated into one body corporate (a borough), and each borough had the right to elect two Burgesses to the General Assembly, hence their name of Burgesses, from Borough.\n\nOne of the Burgesses describes this first meeting of the General Assembly at Jamestown on July 30, 1619, as follows:\n\n“The most convenient place we could find to set in was the Quire of the Church, where fir Geo. Yeardlcy, the Governor, being sort downe in his accustomed place, those of the Council of Estate sat nest him on both halides, except only the Secretary, then appointed speaker, -who sat right before him: John Twine, clerk of the General Assembly, being placed next the Speaker; and Thos. Pierce, the serjeant, standing at the bane, to be ready for any service the Assembly should command him. All the Burgesses took their places in the Quire till a prayer was said by Mr. Bucke, the minister, that it would please God to guide and to sanctifie all our proceedings to his owne glory and to the good of this Plantation. Prayer being ended the Burgesses retired to the body of the church, where they were called by order and by name, and so every man (none staggering at it) took the oath of Supremacy, and then entered the Assembly. The Council had been previously sworn, the first business before the Assembly was to decide who were entitled to sit as members. The Speaker, John Pory was one of the Council of State.”\n\nThe General Assembly consisted of the House of Burgesses and the Council together with the Governor. They sat as one body until the time of Lord Culpeper who brought about the separation of the Council from the Burgesses. They all kept their hats on in session in token of authority. All the acts of Assembly during the control of the London Company were first sent to England for their approval before they became laws. The Company lad the power to confirm or annul the acts of the Assembly.\n\nThe legislature of Virginia has ever been free from scandal excepting during the short period of “Reconstruction,” when there were some adventurers, known as “carpet buggers,” seated in that body. The members from the rural districts are chosen from the more intelligent and highly respected classes, many of whom are lawyers, or country gentlemen. Such men as have no political axes to grind, and who would scornfully refuse to turn the “grindstone of legislation” for purposes of sharpening the venal tools of others, are the men as a rule, selected for the legislature from the county districts.\n\nFrom its first session to the present day, its membership has had upon its rolls the names of men famous as orators, statesmen, and jurists. It has often been made the school through which were graduated some of the Nation’s most distinguished citizens.\n\nCounty Courts had their origin in 1623 when commanders of plantations first held court under Act of Assembly passed in that year, empowering them to hold monthly courts in the corporations of Charles City, and Elizabeth City. The commanders were styled “judges” of monthly courts. In 1628, Commissioners succeeded commanders as judges of monthly courts. County Courts were first established by Act of Assembly in 1642. The jurisdiction of the Court was then further extended to sixteen hundred pounds of tobacco, and the monthly courts were to be thereafter called “County Courts.” By Act of November, 1615, because of the great distance of many parts of the colony from James City, where the (quarter Courts were held, jurisdiction was given to the County Courts, in all cases of law and equity, and trial by jury secured to those who desired it.\n\nIn 1661 the office of Justice of the Peace was first named such by Act of Assembly. They were originally called Commissioners. The County Courts continued under the jurisdiction of justices of the peace until after the Civil War. The justices of the peace prior to and during the Civil War, were selected from the best citizens of the county-the dignified, educated and often wealthy gentlemen.\n\nDuring Reconstruction days pending the adoption of a new Constitution, the old Court System was continued, but the justices were appointed by the military officer in charge of the State. Owing to the disfranchisement clauses in these acts, which disqualified many of the most intelligent men of the State, it was difficult in some neighborhoods to obtain suitably intelligent men to fill these offices.\n\nThe writer was present at a trial conducted during Reconstruction Days before a justice of the peace who received his appointment from General Canby, then commanding in Virginia. The case was a trivial assault upon a constable, by throwing a bucket of slop water upon his head from a second story window as he was about to enter a carriage maker’s shop to serve a summons. The trial was an amusing instance of ignorance of law by all parties engaged in it. The justice before whom the trial was held lived in a two-room weather-boarded log house. This dwelling was in the midst of a big corn field through which a narrow road led from the main highway.\n\nAt the appointed hour all parties interested in the case, together with numerous friends of the defendant, presented themselves at the door of the justice’s dwelling, where it was ascertained that he was “out in the low ground a’ grubbin’ an’ burnin’ bresh.” The party were cordially invited into the house and told to “rest your hats upon the bed.” The crowd filled the small room and overflowed to the threshold upon which two or three found a resting place.\n\nThe hostess said she would call her husband, and thereupon blew two long blasts in a “conch shell horn” which she took from a shelf close to the doorway. Soon thereafter the man of law made his appearance with a grubbing hoe under his arm, his hat in one hand, and a big, red cotton bandanna handkerchief in the other with which he mopped the sweat o f honest toil from a bald head. He cordially shook hands with each one-all of whom be knew personally-and civilly inquired about the health of their families.\n\nThis gentleman was a typical poor white man of Tidewater Virginia; an honest, industrious, independent, orderly citizen, but totally illiterate, and therefore unfitted for the responsible position assigned him. During the trial, his opinion was asked in a certain matter of law, and he humorously replied: “I don’t know much about the book laws. I never went to school but two days in my life. It rained like all scissors both days, and the teacher didn’t come nary day of the two, so I quit wastin’ time and went to work, and I’ve been at work ever since. I’ll think this thing over, an’ let ye know,”\n\nHe was the owner of a considerable number of acres of poor land which had been in the possession of his ancestors for generations and was worked by all of these several generations without adding anything to improve the soil. He made a living for himself and wife by his own industry and frugality, but was too poor to own servants. He took no part in the war, and was not an advocate of secession; neither did he hold office before the war; therefore he was eligible under the Reconstruction Acts.\n\nThe Commonwealth attorney who represented the plaintiff in the case was also a military appointee; a native of a western State, fresh from his graduating class in a law school, and without knowledge of law other than “book larnin’.” This was his first case in a “real court of justice:’ Unfortunately for him, his” law library “consisted of his answer to the” Quiz “of the Court before whom he was first licensed, together with a copy of” Blackstone’s Commentaries,”and a book on” Evidence:’\n\nAs the weather was warm and pleasant outdoors, and accommodations within the house were too limited for the assemblage, it was suggested that the trial be held in the shade of a big pine tree that stood nearby and adjoining the “worm fence” which enclosed the “cuppen.” ‘ The top rails were withdrawn from the fence and inserted between the lower rails which form “the worm” of the several panels, and the crowd was then invited to seat themselves upon these rails where they could rest their backs against the fence. The justice, in his shirt sleeves, sat himself upon the front board of a “steer kyart” which stood under the pine tree. As soon as he steadied himself with his feet upon the tongue of the cart, the Court was in session and ready for business regardless of a crier.\n\nThe case was opened by the young Commonwealth attorney who stated that “the assault was made by wilfully and maliciously casting upon the garments which the plaintiff then wore, upon his head and body, the contents of a” soak bucket,”in v-hick a painter used to soak his brushes. He declaimed in earnest voice upon the respect due an officer of the law, and called upon the constable to exhibit the hat and coat which he wore upon the occasion of the assault. The hat–an old time straight sided beaver-shoved up like a barber’s pole, with alternate streaks of red, white and red, and red, white and blue paints upon it. The colors on the coat were so closely blended and widely spread about as to unfit that garment for future wear.\n\nThe defendant was not represented by a loyal attorney, but trusted to his assembled friends, one of whom ;vas the brother of the former Commonwealth’s attorney, and because of this close kinship alone, he was accredited with much knowledge of law. He bravely and vigorously maintained his suddenly acquired fame as a “horseback lawyer,” by interrupting and correcting the prosecution as frequently as opportunity offered, but his greatest success was made when the young attorney proceeded to quote from his copy of “Blackstone.” At once objection was made to quoting “Blackstone on the laws of Virginia.,” and the Court was told that “everybody in the county knows that Blackstone is no lawyer, but only the keeper of a summer resort on Blackstone’s Island, up the Potomac River, on the Maryland side,” and the Court was appealed to for confirmation of this fact. To this the justice assented, as he had often passed Blackstone’s Island in his trips up and down the Potomac while on his way to and from town.\n\nThe young prosecuting attorney was too much dazed by this unlocked for and sudden turn in the case to discover the humor in it, and before he could recover his wits and make reply, the attention of the justice was called to the fact that his wife was making frantic efforts to drive back six young, lively shoats which had broken loose from their pen, and were working destruction in the young corn patch. Here was the golden opportunity for the defendant and his friends, and after a hasty whispering, they suggested to the justice that he adjourn court awhile and they would “run the shoats down and pen them.” To this proposition he thankfully agreed. Fearing that the prosecution might benefit by their absence, they appointed one of their number to aid the justice in building anew the pig pen, and shedding their coats, they gave chase to the fleety shoats. Of all the domestic animals with which man is blessed, or distressed, there are none so difficult to catch and hold, as young, healthy shoats when loose in a big level field. It is said “they can beat a streak of greased lightning in zigzagging,” and are as difficult to lay hold of as the Irishman’s proverbial flea. After repeated trials to corner and capture all six shoats at once, the crowd finally centered their chase upon one animal at a time, and after numerous upsets, and tumbles over one another, and amusing slips of “tail holds,” the six shoats were at last landed within the pen by the perspiring crowd amid the grateful acknowledgments of his honor, the justice, who was not aware of the fact that the men had done more damage to the young corn than did the shoats.\n\nAs it was then late in the afternoon, and all parties to the trial were several miles from their respective homes, it was suggested to the justice that the case be postponed until some more convenient date. To this the obliging magistrate readily agreed, much to the disgust and annoyance of the prosecution, and thus ended one of the trials before a justice of the peace during Reconstruction days, in one of the counties of the “Nor thorn Neck of Virginia.” The young “carpet bag” Commonwealth attorney, when the State was readmitted into the Union, returned to his western home, and was last heard of as a candidate on the Democratic ticket for Commonwealth attorney. The old, obliging “scalawag” justice of the peace has long since passed to the Higher Court, and it is yet undecided whether the assault was accidental, or with malice aforethought.\n\nAfter the State was re-admitted, County Judges were elected by the legislature. In some instances they had more than one county within their jurisdiction. In the year 1904, the system was changed to a meeting once in every two months-six courts a year, under the jurisdiction of a Judge of the Circuit Court.\n\nThe custom of holding court in each county every month was a great advantage to the people of Tidewater Virginia. As stated elsewhere, these several counties are intersected by numerous rivers, creeks, or coves, which extend far into their interiors, and divide the lands into peninsulas, great and small. Very few of these streams are crossed by bridges, or have regularly kept ferries, and can therefore be crossed only at their heads by long detours. Therefore, the county court days, and the “Court House Bounds” were most frequently selected as the more convenient times and places to meet the many with whom to transact business.\n\nThe “Court House Bounds” is usually the largest village of a county, and generally contains at least one or two, or more taverns, several stores, and blacksmith, wheelright and harness shops. These conveniences, together with the business of the court, brought together vast assemblages of the inhabitants of the respective counties, and many others from the adjoining counties where they were sure to meet neighbors, friends and acquaintances from far and near. They came from all directions and in all kinds of vehicles, some afoot and many on horseback.\n\nOn court days, the “Court House Bounds” looked like a cavalry camp. Many of the riders came there with their animals’ noonday rations of ten bundles of fodder and six ears of corn tied behind their saddle. They “hitched” their horses or mules to the fences and “horse racks” in the village. In the summer months many of the ne-roes came to court in their bare feet, with their footwear slung over their shoulder, and when within sight of the “Bounds” would halt by the roadside and “shoe up.”\n\nIt was a holiday for the people generally, especially before planting time, in the spring, and after the harvests, in the fall. It was entertaining to a stranger to see this great assemblage of decent, orderly citizens, conducting their several transactions in the most quiet, deliberate manner, without show of haste, or nervousness, or disorder. Perhaps nowhere else in America could such a sight be witnessed of gentlemanly order amongst all classes.\n\nThis custom of meeting monthly was in practice from the earliest years of the settlement of the respective counties, and therefore was an important, time-honored factor in the business life of these people. While the business of the Court was being held inside the Court House, the “Court green” was occupied by the multitude assembled in small crowds throughout the whole village, some of whom were buying or selling their lands, timber, and other commodities, paying off old debts, or contracting new ones; others with more leisure were discussing important events, or telling yarns-humorously denoted as “swapping lies.”\n\nCandidates for office met on these occasions and greeted the voters, and debated with one another in the Court house, if the business before the court was not too urgent to adjourn, and if so, the candidates were provided with an improvised platform of dry goods boxes, turkey coops, or barrels. Candidates readily accommodate themselves to any emergencies when seeking the suffrage of their fellow citizens. The improvised platform was not always constructed with due regard to the avoirdupois of the occupant, or the tests to which he might put it, and there were numerous instances of amusing, though not fatal casualties resulting therefrom. During one of the exciting elections, a candidate of heavy weight was making his speech from the head of a whiskey barrel, across which was placed a narrow board for his safety. In his ardor to impress a certain fact upon his hearers, which he emphasized by the statement: “As sure as I stand upon this barrel-,” and with this sentence unfinished, he leaped with both feet from the narrow plank upon the yielding barrel head, and disappeared “up to his neck in spirits” which the anxious crowd had hoped to put into their own necks, and to test in a more convivial manner. Through this awkward incident of his canvas, he lost his election, but thereby acquired fame as “Old Soak,” which name ever afterwards identified him. A Virginia audience listens well, is courteous to strangers, and appreciative of humorous wit or salient points of speech, even though it be at their own expense. They love to “see the fur fly.”\n\nThe following lines express the sentiments of a freedman voter:\n\nLOOKIN’ FO’ DE CANDEEDATE\n\nJes’ befo’ de ‘lection\n\nHe cum soon an’ late,\n\nNow I’se gittin’ lonesome\n\nWa.itin’ at de gate.\n\nMistuh! can yo’ tell me\n\nWhar is dat Can-dee-date?\n\nHope de Lawd will spar’ him,\n\nHis talk was powerful great.\n\nI ‘sped he’ll do a heap\n\nNow fo’ dis of state.\n\nMistuh! please do tell me\n\nWhar is dat Can-dee-date?\n\nPublic vendues (auctions) were held out in the open court green, where horses, oxen, mules, cows, and “busted merchants”‘ goods were bid upon by the many, and but few of whom knew their intrinsic value. Auction bids are seldom correct indexes of values. Snits of clothing were purchased on these occasions without opportunity to “try the fit,” and therefore without due regard to the size of the contemplated wearers, the result of which was that the purchaser of a suit of vendue clothing attended the following Court in a coat he could not button around him, and a pair of “high water pants,” too sheet by many inches.\n\n“Swapping” horses is a custom which is almost exclusively confined to the rural sections of the United States. This custom prevails to a greater extent in the States south of Mason and Dixon’s line than elsewhere. In the sections of Virginia remote from a railroad, nearly every man, white and colored owns either a horse, or male, or yoke of steers, and the majority of the owners will make a swap of either animal, if good opportunity offers.\n\n“The swapping” was conducted usually in the tavern “horse lot,” after score “sharp talk,” and a few gallops of the animals, up the road and back again. A wily “swapper” from an adjoining county, would ride though the “Court House Bounds” upon his “new, jaunty tail, frisky hoss,” that betokened “go in him,” and “hard to hold.” Such a swapper was sure to attract act the attention of the younger owners of horses. None but the poor animal., and its shrewd rider knew that a dried chestnut burr under the crupper was the main cause of its frilliness, and if a. “swap” were made and the dried chestnut burr were shed, the animal’s sudden loss of friskiness, and an inspection of his mouth, would disclose the fact that he had “cat leis eye teeth” many moons antedating the birth of his new owner. The loser in a horse swap at one court was a winner at the next court, else he had made such a “bad swap” that it “broke him up.” Every young horse owner, at some time or another, is desirous to make a swap. The earlier in life he makes the swap and “gets stuck good” the more he may profit in after years by this experience. The “Court House Bounds” on a court day, is a good place for the young swapper to begin, for there he is sure to meet with friends who will do for him that which his newly swapped horse may refuse to do-carry him home.\n\nIt is said there are tricks in all trades, and a few in horse swapping. Here are some of the tricks of unscrupulous traders. To make a true pulling horse balk, mix corrosive sublimate and tincture of cantharides and apply it to his shoulders. To make a sound horse appear lame, a single hair is taken from his tail and run through the eye of a needle; the front leg is lifted, the skin pressed between the middle and outer tendon, and the needle shoved through. The horse will go lame in twenty minutes. To make a horse stand by his food and not eat it, grease his front teeth with tallow, and he will not eat until it is washed out. A fine wire fastened tight around the fetlock between the foot and heel will make a horse appear as if badly foundered. When a horse goes dead lame in one shoulder, it is disguised by creating a similar lameness in the corresponding leg by taking off the shoe and inserting a bean between it and the foot. Black spots are put on a horse by applying a mixture of lime and litharge. To put a star on a horse, a piece of cotton cloth the size of the star desired, is spread on the part and warm pitch applied. After two days it is washed until the hair grows out white.\n\nCourt day was a holiday for many of the negroes, especially for those living nearby the Court House village. The young negroes had no serious cares for the future, and therefore enjoyed themselves in wrestling, and kicking bouts, and in dancing “Juba patted tunes,” and keeping step to the lively “hoe down” tunes played upon a jewsharp.\n\nThe elderly and thrifty negroes-some of whom their masters permitted to “fish for themselves” brought fresh fish, oysters, and chicken to supply the hungry crowds. Their wives did the cooking in the open Court House green, upon a fire of dry “light wood knots” and faggots which they carried in ox carts from their homes for the occasion. Every Court was attended by several “black mammies,” who came in “steer kyarts,” loaded up with fish “jes’ fum de watah dia mawnin’.”\n\nOysters fresh from their watery beds: “I ‘clay sub, dey didn’t hav’ time to dry darselves ‘fore I fotch ’em yere.” They had young tender chickens “dress’d by can’el light dia mawnin’, so nice dar mammys wouldn’t know ’em suh.”\n\n“Cose I fix yo’ one!” “Honey, yo’ sot yo’se’f down on dat bog dar, an’ yo’ won’t stahve to death waitin’ wile I’se fryin’ dis yere one fo’ yo’. Does yo’ laik ash cake or co’n pope wid yo’ chicken? We mos’ in gin’ral eats ash cake wid our fried chicken, an’ an’ co’n pope wid our b’iled wittlea. Yas suh ! Dats de way of Missus she fotch us up suh.”\n\n“It’s heap o’ wuck to raise chickens; dey needs lots of nussin’ ‘fore dey’s able to care fo’ deirselves. Dey has a sight o’ pips, an’ gapes, an’ wums a troublin’ ’em. We mos’ in gin’ral makes ’em swaller dar pips, an’ den dey won’t hev’ gapes so bad. An’ yo’ got to watch out fo’ dem prowlin’ ornary chicken hawks Vat flies ’bout in de yair, an’ pounces down ‘pon de little ones ‘fore yo’ ‘spects dey’s any whar’s ’bout yo’ place. W’en dey grabs a chicken, ‘taint no use fo’ de of hen to make a racket, kase dat chicken’s sho’ gone fum ’bout yere.\n\n“My of man Isaac he fixes contraptions to skeer de hawks, but, Honey, dey aint no good, dem hawks cum an’ sot down an’ res’ darselves right dar on top o’ Isaac’s fixins laik it war made fo’ dem to res’ on. Ef Isaac evah seed one o’ dem hawks a settin’ dar, I ‘spect he’d cuss ef he warn’t a church member, kase he’s mighty easy upsot.”\n\nThe rumor that the dry goods box, which an obliging storekeeper loaned for the occasion as a “dining table,” was covered with “Aunt Tilda’s” clean, bed sheet, in lieu of a table cloth, did not appear to diminish her trade. The food and cooking of these “black mammies” was excellent. They were patronized by white and colored.\n\nCrime and commerce are the principal subjects which bring business to all courts. Owing to the general orderly condition of its people, the courts have few cases of crime upon their dockets, and seldom are these of a seriously vicious character.\n\nDuring the first few years after the Civil War, there was some petty pilfering by a few of the negroes. They would take a few fowls, or a “turn of fodder” or corn, or some trifling amount of food to tide them over some “resting spell,” during the period they were determining whether freedom meant all play or some labor. The white people who suffered from these annoyances were generally lenient when the culprit was detected and often would go bail for the release and future good behavior of the prisoner. Some of the magistrates’ trials of these offences were amusing instances of the simplicity of Tidewater Virginia justice, and of the forbearing nature of the whites toward the colored kindly, during these years.\n\nA certain negro named “Major”-no one ever knew him by any other name-was haled before a magistrate for stealing a turkey, and when confronted with the evidence of his guilt, the magistrate said: “Well boy, (forty years old,) what have you to say about this?” to which Major replied:\n\n“Jedge, it happen’d dis yere way. I was tukken down wid a misery in ma side, an’ I want able to go to cuttin’ no co’d wood laik I’d bin a doin’, an’ jus as I wuz a gwine to de sto’ to ax Mistuh B_____ to lemme hav’ a few poun’s o’ bacon ’twill I gits rid o’ de misery in ma side, an’ den as I cu ms pas’ Mistah C -‘s cuppen fence dar sot dis yere young turkey right dar, suh, and I sez to mase’f, ef de Lawd me I shore gwine cut Mistah C _____ a co’d an’ a ha’f uv good wood fo’ dis yore tukkey. Dat’s jes’ wat I say, I aint tellin’ yo’ no lie, suh. I suttinly will wo’k out dat tukkey, shore’s I live. W’en I tuk dat tukkey I didn’t hav’ grease enuff in ma cabin to grease a spider. I don et it all up ‘fore I seed dat tukkey. Dat’s how cum I taik dat tukkey. I clar ‘fore de Lawd dis is de fust time I evah was kotched takin’ tukkey in ma life.”\n\nMajor’s bail for future apearance at court when called and for his future good behavior, was fixed at a small sum, and an old ex-Confederate soldier-who knew that turkeys roosting on a nearby fence are great temptations-joined in the bond, and Major was again a free man and his future trial was never fixed. He “fined” the church, and ever after was an orderly citizen. In recognition of his future good behavior, the writer loaned him a newly painted wheelbarrowto which he had taken a great fancy-to wheel his child to “‘traded meetin’,” some four or five miles distant. Thus it is that virtue receives its reward in Tidewater Virginia.\n\nThe judges of the courts are selected from amongst the members of the local bar. They are usually natives of that section over which they have jurisdiction, and are therefore well informed as to the character of its people, and conversant with their daily modes of life. In the administration of justice, information of such character is an aid to a judge in tempering justice with mercy, especially if the Court has the heart like unto a Tidewater Judge. All courts of law are hedged with technicalities more or less, but the people of thin section, and the courts are more anxious to reach the truth of a legal problem by a just and righteous inquiry than through technicalities of law which may distort and pervert the ends of justice.\n\nThere is a genteel, quiet dignity in the Virginia Judge, but it partakes nothing of the overwise, and solemn countenance which so often betokens the “man of law” in many other sections of the United States. “The judge” is one of the people’s choice, and respected accordingly. When not in his court “he is one of the people.” In addition to his court duties he is frequently the owner of lands which claim his attention, and often his personal aid in their cultivation.\n\nThe laws are administered in Virginia with the least degree of harshness, and to all classes alike. No taint of dishonor has ever been justly made against the judiciary of this section.\n\nThe Tidewater Virginia Judge of the rural districts, is well-known and readily recognized by all persons, white and black, young and old, within his circuit, and when passing along the public highways, he is constantly being saluted by the passers-by as “Judge.”\n\nTo one accustomed to such familiar and friendly recognition it is a shock for him to reach a place where he is totally unknown and the oldtime friendly recognition ceases.\n\nOne of those courtly Virginia judges, named C-1 from one of “The Peninsula” counties, had occasion to visit New York City, and upon his return to his native heath was asked how he liked the big city, to which he replied New York City, suh ! I was there nearly two days, sub, and not a single person stopped to say “Howdy” to me, nor even recognized me. I want nothing more to do with such an uncivil place, suh! I’m glad to be back amongst people who have time and inclination to be decent.”\n\nThe lawyers and doctors of Virginia, outside of the cities, are usually land owners, and like the judges, they may be found with their hands to the plow, or in directing their employees where to “run the furrow.”\n\nThe country lawyer, and country doctor need to be generally well informed in their respective professions. The “specials ties” of law, or of physic in that section are not of sufficient magnitude as to induce one to confine himself to “special practice.” The rural life, therefore, forces the practitioner to efforts which city life does not demand.\n\nCountry lawyers, and country doctors, unlike their city brothers, take active parts in the social and industrial conditions which surround them, and are, therefore, useful members in the life of their respective communities for advice, counsel, and aid in matters of import outside of their respective schools of thought.\n\nThe doctor seldom engages in political debate; he leaves that field open to his more combative brother of the bar. The doctor will draw blood only in the effort to save life. The lawyer will seek eye for eye, and tooth for tooth when hip client is wrathy and demands the Levitical law.\n\nThe lawyers of America, especially those born and reared within the rural sections, and in the smaller towns, and who might be classed as “country lawyers,” have taken prominent places in the councils of this nation from its foundation to the present day. They were signers of the Declaration of Independence, and many of them have filled the chair of the Chief Executive of this nation.\n\nNearly every lawyer in Tidewater Virginia is a politician, at least to the extent of speech making for their political party. They are the class of men from amongst whom came Patrick Henry, Henry Clay, Henry A. Wise, and other orators, and statesmen, as well as jurists of historic renown. The lawyers frequent many county courts. They “ride the circuit” in search of business, and it is of frequent occurrence that upon entering a distant court house, they may be engaged to take charge of a case in court without a moment’s preparation, other than a hurried consultation, but their wide and extensive acquaintance with the people of all classes resident within their practice, together with their general knowledge of law, are their aids in such emergencies. They are usually good judges of human nature, and can lay bare its frailties and weaknesses in open court with eloquent tongue. As a rule they reside at the court houses.\n\nThe lawyer of early years of the colony was paid his fees in tobacco, and when he got a case in court, he probably tried to “make things smoke.”\n\nIf the court session was prolonged until late in the evening, the members of the court and bar spent the night at the village tavern.\n\nBefore the introduction of stoves-they were not in general use in the rural sections until several years after the Civil War-the big fire place of the tavern, which emitted bright and cheerful glows, was the scene of much comfort and enjoyment during the winter court nights. Then it was that the judge, the lawyers, the summoned jurymen, and officers of the court, and persons whose business detained them over night, assembled around the capacious hearth and engaged in friendly discussions, and relations of witty and humorous stories. Every Virginian is fond of a story, provided it is devoid of gross vulgarity. The lawyers are usually good story tellers, and it is said the judges of Virginia are able to hold their end up when occasion arises. It was rumored that the late hours of the nights spent at the tavern were often enlivened by “a gentleman’s game” of draw-poker-played for sport and not for gain.\n\nIt is said there is a chapel in Rome dedicated to one Saint Evona, a lawyer. He came to Rome to entreat the Pope to give the lawyers of Brittany a patron. The Pope replied that, he knew of no saint but what was disposed of to other professions, and he had none to spare for the lawyers, at which Evona was very sad, and begged so earnestly that at last the Pope proposed to him that he should go around the church blindfolded, and after he had said so many prayers, that the first saint in the group which he might lay hold of while blindfolded, should be the patron of lawyers. The good old lawyer started in his round, and at the end of his prayers he stopped at an altar, reached out his hand and laid hold of the image of the devil which lay at the feet of St. Michael, and cried out in his blindness “This is our Saint; let him be the patron of my profession-the law.” Upon the removal of his blindfold, and observing what a patron he had chosen, he was shocked to death, and coming to Heaven’s gate, he knocked hard, whereupon St. Peter asked “who it was that knocked so loudly;” he replied that it was “Evona the advocate.” “Away, away,” said St. Peter, “there is but one advocate in Heaven; there is no room for you lawyers.” “O! but,” said Evona, “I am that honest lawyer who never tools fees on both sides, or ever pleaded in a bad cause, nor did I ever set my neighbor by the ears, or lived by the sins of the people.” “Well then,” said St. Peter, “come in,” and thereupon St. Peter sent an angel to the earth to inscribe upon the tombstone of St. Evona:\n\n“God works wonders now and then,\n\nHere lies a lawyer, an honest man.”\n\nIt is agreed that this epitaph is suited to Virginia lawyers. In 1643, the first act was passed for regulating lawyers. No attorney was permitted to plead without a license, which was granted by the court in which he practiced. Their fees were twenty pounds of tobacco in the county courts, and fifty pounds in the (quarter Courts, and no attorney could refuse to be retained unless employed on the other side.\n\nIn 1647, that act was amended by adding a clause to it declaring that no attorneys should take any fees, and if the Court should perceive that either party, by their weakness, was likely to lose his case, they themselves should either open the case “or appoint some fit man out of the people to plead the cause, and allow him a reasonable compensation.” No other attorneys were admitted. This act was repealed in 1656.\n\nAct of 1680 declared that “no licensed attorney should demand or receive for bringing any cause to judgment in the general court, more than 500 lbs. of tobacco and cask; and in the County Court, 150 lbs. of tobacco and cask; which fees are allowed him without any pre-agreement.” “If any attorney shall refuse to plead any cause in the respective courts aforesaid, for the aforesaid fees, he shall forfeit as much as his fees should have been.”\n\nThe attorneys of those days could hardly “pocket their fees;” they had to “bag them.”\n\nIn many of the counties are preserved curious wills and orders of Court. The following copy of a will for probate in York County, Virginia, in 1637, is interesting:\n\n“At a court holden att ye house of Mr. Richard Townsend Ye 25th day of May 1637. Present Capt. Christopher Wormsley, Capt. Robt. Fellgate, Mr. John Chew, Mr. Richard Townshend, Mr. John Cheeseman, Mr. Will Pryor, Mr. Hugh Owen.\n\nIn the name of God Amen. This will and Testament being the last Will and Testament of Andrew Whorvell, made the tenth of March 1631, being in his perfect senses as ever he was in his life time. Witnesseth That I make Christopher Stokes my lawful overseer to see that the tendure of this my will be performed as followeth\n\nFirst. I bequeath my soul to Almighty God, my maker, and my body to be buryed in the Ground and for my worldly Wealth that itt hath pleased God to endow me with as followeth\n\n–Item. I give unto my brother Nathaniell Clarke one sow pig the whitch my father doth owe me and one Barrel of Corn when he is one and twenty years of age and two hens presently.\n\nItem. I give unto my Sister Bettie Clarke three barrels of Indian corne and one pullett and one sow.\n\nItem. I give unto my father Joseph Jolly one sow pigg, and one barrow pigg.\n\nItem. I give unto my mother Margaret Jolly one barrow pigg.\n\nItem. The three barrels of Corne that I give unto my Sister Bettie Clarke is to be put to use till that she cometh to age and the sow that I give her they that keep her till that she cometh to age are to have of the increase all the bore piggs and the sow piggs to be putt to the best use till that she cometh of age. Witness my hand this day and year first above written.\n\nAndrew Whorvell, his X mark.”\n\nWill of Richard Coles of Westmoreland, proved in 1674.\n\nItem. It is my will and desire that my body be interred upon Poynt Pleasant, upon my plantation, in a neat coffin of black walnut, if conveniently be had, and that a grave stone of black marble be with all convenient speed sent for out of England, with my Coat of Arms engraven in brass, and under it this epitaph:\n\nHere lies Dick Cole, a grevious sinner,\n\nThat died a little before dinner,\n\nYet hopes in Heaven to find a place\n\nTo satiate his soul with Grace.\n\nItem. I will that my grave stone be raised with Dutch brickes above three foot from the ground, and my grave be paled in with posts and rails of locust, and white oke boards of a double substance, and under them locust sills, and if my wife think it expedient to sell ye land that the vendee or vendees be obliged forever to keep my grave in repair.”\n\nThe following order, celebrating the birth of a Prince of Wales, in Old Rappahannock County, now Essex and Richmond counties, is interesting:\n\n“At a court held for Rappahannock County the 2d day of Jany Anno Dom, 1688.\n\nPresent-Col. Jno. Stone, Capt. Geo. Taylor, Capt. Saml. Blumfield, Mr. Jno. Rice, Justices.\n\nIt having pleased Almighty God to bless his Royal Majesty with the birth of a son and his subjects with a Prince of Wales, and for as much as his Excellency hath sett apart the 16th day of this inst. Jany, for solemnizing the same; To this end, therefore, that it may be done with all expression of Joy this county is capable of, This Court have ordered that Capt. George Taylor do provide and bring to the North Side Court House for this County (now Richmond) as much Rum and other strong liquor, with Sugar proportionable, as shall amount to six thousand five hundred pounds of Tobacco, to be distributed amongst the Troops of horse, company of foot and other persons that shall be present at the solemnitie, and that said sum be allowed him at the next laying of the levy; as also, that Cap. Saml. Blumfield provide and bring to the South Side Court House for this County, (now Essex) as much Rum or other strong Liquor, with sugar proportionable, as shall amount to 3500 lbs. of Tobacco, to be distributed as above, at the South Side Court House and the said sum to be allowed him at the next laying of the levy.”\n\nNote also the following:\n\n“A court at James citty the 17 Sept. 1627 present Sir George Yeardley, Knt, Governor, Dr. Pott, Capt. Smyth and Mr. Secretary, Divers examinations being taken and had concerning the unquiett life wch ye people of Archers Hope lead through the scoldinges raleings and failings out vath Amy the wife of Christopher Hall and other abominable contentions happening between them to the dishonour of God and the breach of the Kings peace, the Court hath thereupon ordered that the said Amy shall be toughed (towed) round about the” Margarett and John “and ducked three times.”\n\nThe “Margaret and John” was a vessel anchored near Archers Hope, the place where the colony would have first settled upon but for the shallow waters near the shore.\n\nSome of the laws of the early days are also interesting:\n\n“The court in every county shall cause to be set up near the Court house, a pillory, a pair of stocks, a whipping post, and a ducking stool, in such place as they shall think convenient.”. . . . Laws of 1662.\n\n“In actions of slander occasioned by a man’s wife, after judgment passed for damages the woman shall be punished by ducking, and if the slander be such as the damages shall be adjudged above 500 pounds of tobacco, then the woman shall have ducking for every 500 pounds of tobacco adjudged against her husband; if he refuse to pay the tobacco.” Laws of 1662.\n\nLord Culpeper, writing in 1683 said the Secretary (of State) was a patent officer, from the first seating of the country, the very next in dignity to the Governor, or Commander-in-Chief. He had the right to appoint all County Clerks. He was keeper of the colonial seal and exofficio clerk of the Council and General Court, though the duties of these offices were actually performed by the titular clerks of the respective bodies. The clerks of the courts in Tidewater Virginia are among the most competent and obliging of its officials, and mainly for these reasons are the less affected-of the county officers-by the political changes which occur at the regular elections. Many of them went into these offices as deputies to their fathers in their first years of manhood, and were continued there as long as they lived.\n\n“Well done thou good and faithful servant” can truthfully be inscribed upon the tombs of the clerks of courts in Virginia.\n\nThe old time court house buildings which were usually but one story in height are being supplanted either by entirely new structures, or by additions to them of modern improvements and shapes, which in many cases have obliterated all semblance of their original style of architecture. The court rooms of the old time buildings were upon the first floor, large and airy in summer, and cold and draughty in winter. In the improved buildings,. the court rooms are generally situated upon the upper floors, which are well lighted and heated, and comfortable during all seasons. The walls of some of the court rooms are decorated with tablets of stone and portraits, containing the names and services of local officials; they also contain the portraits of many distinguished men of both state and national fame, who were born within these several counties, or who made their homes therein during a period of their lives.\n\nThe judicial circuit presided over by Hon. Judge T. R. B. Wright, which comprises the counties of Lancaster, Northumberland, Richmond, and Westmoreland, in the “Northern Neck” peninsula, and the county of Essex, in the “Middlesex” peninsula, contains the largest collection of tablets and portraits perhaps, of any circuit in the State. The collections within this circuit include Presidents of the United States, Cabinet officers of the Chief Executive, Judges, Jurists, and Statesmen of renown. There are also portraits of distinguished soldiers of every war in which the nation has been a participant, from the Revolutionary to the Civil War.\n\nAmong the more prominent portraits are those of George Washington, and Robert E. Lee, upon the walls of Westmoreland Court House.\n\nRoger Jones, Adjutant General of the United States Army, and Edwin Bates, Attorney General in President Lincoln’s Cabinet, are found upon the walls of Northumberland Court House.\n\nUpon the walls of Essex Court House are many tablets of stone containing the names of soldiers of the Confederacy, among whom are several of Pickett’s famous Division. Among the portraits is that of Hon. R. M. T. Hunter, a distinguished member of the United States House of Representatives for many years, and a member of the United States Senate from his native State (Virginia) when the Civil War began. Whilst a member of Congress, he originated the bonded warehouse system, under which imported goods were permitted to remain in Government warehouses until the owners desired to put them upon the market, paying the duties at the time of withdrawal. He was a prominent candidate for the Presidency in 1860. When Virginia seceded, he resigned his seat in the Senate and was afterwards Secretary of State of the Confederacy in President Davis’ Cabinet. He was one of the three Confederate Commissioners appointed by President Davis to treat for peace with President Lincoln and Secretary Seward at the Fortress Monroe Convention. In 1874 he was elected Treasurer of Virginia. He died in Essex County, July 18, 1887.\n\nWhen the colonists reached Virginia there were no roads, public or private, laid out upon this continent. There was no necessity for such openings through the lands and forests of America as are now known as public roads or highways. The Indians trafficked only in such articles as they could shoulder. They did not know the use of metals and therefore had no weighty material to transport such as at the present day, and if necessity arose for roadways they had no implements with which to construct them. They were content to march in single file when journeying. They had no draft animals, nor vehicles for carriage or transportation other than boats, many of which were constructed of material so light in weight as to admit of their portage from stream to stream upon the shoulders of men.\n\nWhen the colonists extended their settlements into the interiors of the peninsulas, away from the navigable streams, and when public places were established, such as churches, court houses, and grist mills, there arose a necessity for roads, but such roads as were constructed in the early years of the settlement, though their construction was forced by acts of assembly, were, nevertheless, nothing more than bridle paths.\n\nAct. L, 1632 provided: “Highwayes shall be layd out in such convenient places as are requisite accordinge as the Governor and Council, or the Commissioners for the monthlie cons shall appoynt, or according as the parishioners of every parish shall agree.”\n\nAct IX, 1657 provided for surveyors of “High Waise.” “That surveyors of highwaise and maintenance for bridges be yearly kept and appointed in each Countie Court respectively, and that all generall wages from county to county and all churchwaies to be laid out and cleered yeerly as each county court shall think fit, needful and convenient; respect being had to the course in England to that end.”\n\nIn 1661 Act LXXXIX provided for the yearly appointment of surveyors of the highways by the justices of the peace to “lay out the most convenient wages to the church, to the court, and make the said wages 40 foote broad, and make bridges where there is occasion.”\n\nThe surveyors were also directed to keep the “wages” clear from fallen logs, and the bridges in good repair. They were empowered “to order the parishioners everyone according to the number of tithables he bath in his family, to send upon the dayes by the surveyors appointed to help them in cleering the wages and making and repairing the bridges according to the intent and purpose of this act” There were penalties attached payable in tobacco for neglect to perform these duties.\n\nBuilding roadways through the primeval forests, and over low bottom lands, and marshy grounds, and bridging numerous streams, was a mighty laborious undertaking at the early period of Virginia’s settlement, especially if this task were to be done by the single individual and not by the collective community.\n\nAs a matter of fact, each seating place of a planter when first settled upon was devoid of any passageway or roadway to or from his home in the primeval wilderness connecting him with the outside world, and because of the gigantic task of road building many of the settlers postponed this work, thus placing their homes remote from all intercourse with the public highways and beyond the reach of their fellow man. So common was this condition that the general assembly deemed it necessary to enact laws compelling the opening of roads to “houses and plantations.” Such was Act V, 1667, “For Roades to Houses.” “Whereas the despatch of business in this countrey is much obstructed for want of bridlewayes to the several houses and plantations: It is enacted by this grand assembly and the authority thereof, that every person haveing a plantation shall, at the most plaine and convenient path that leads to his house make a gate in his ffence for the convenience of passage of man and horse to his house about their occasions at the discretion of the owners.”\n\nIn 1705, there was passed an act for constructing roads “to and from city of Williamsburg, the court house of every county, the parish churches, and such public mills and ferries as now are, or hereafter shall be erected, and from one county to another county, at least 30 ft. wide.” All male tithables when called upon by the surveyor were to assist in the work. The condition of the public roads of Tidewater Virginia were never a source of very grave anxiety to its people until very recent years. So long as there was a hard spot in the road to straddle upon, or a rut so shallow that its bottom was within reach of the cart-hub, the repairing of the road was postponed.\n\nThis condition was owing mainly to the fact that the largest shipment of agricultural products, were usually from the wealthier planters located convenient to some stream where a vessel or lighter could be reached by a short haul. Many planters had vessel landings upon their own lands. The farmers located at the greater distance from rivers or creeks, were generally the less wealthy class. Their main products for shipment were such as “could walk off” horses, mules, cows, calves, yearlings, steers, hogs and sheep. What corn or wheat they raised was consumed at home, or trafficked with neighbors who were engaged in occupations other than tilling the soil.\n\nIncluding the high and dry and level areas, there are hundreds of miles of the roads throughout that whole section which need no work upon them other than to trim out the intruding bushes, which, if left to thrive, would eventually narrow the roadway beyond usage. The hills and the soft bottom places in the “low grounds” have ever been a source of much labor to keep in good order.\n\nThe public highways of Virginia were formerly worked by the inhabitants living within the several road precincts, who were “called upon the road” by the overseer of the roads, an elective officer who was empowered by law to summon the residents of his district to work the roads a certain number of days during each twelve months. Those who failed to put in an appearance when called, either sent a substitute or paid a certain sum of money to the road-fund. This mode of repairing roads was unsatisfactory, and they are now worked by contract and paid for by a road-tag fund.\n\nOwing to the fact that many of the road-beds are composed of sand or clay, with few or no stones or gravel, the heavy rains rapidly form deep gulleys on the sand hills, or quagmires on the clay hill roads.\n\nThere are hundreds of thousands of acres of Tidewater Virginia lands that do not contain a stone large enough to “chunk a squirrel.”\n\nClay hills and boggy bottoms are usually corduroyed for want of better material. A corduroy road is made by laying a bed of poles across it, side by side, and covering them slightly with soil. In the event of rains washing the soil from the poles, the vehicle traveling over such road is jostled, bumped, and jerked across a small pole, and against a larger one alternately, with an up and down and sidewise motion, like a small boat in a “choppy sea.” A fractious horse driven on a dark night down a steep corduroy hill road, after a heavy rain storm, is apt to alarm the driver lest he be thrown upon his head; it will at least force him to make uncomplimentary remarks about the road overseer.\n\nThere are many small streams “Runs” crossing the roads, which are not bridged. During very heavy rains, these streams widen out suddenly, and cover the road bed, and the surrounding lowlands, with a wave of w water which greatly confuses the stranger on a dark night, and I. ay put him in a plight of “landing up the creek” in some boggy, oozy bottom to sink beyond the sound of Gabriel’s horn. Even though it be a dark night, an experienced traveler will discover by the movements of his horse’s feet when the animal leaves “hard bottom,” and by a speedy pull of the proper rein, may save himself from a muddy grave.\n\nSome of the “Runs” between low banks are narrow, and during heavy rains, wash out “chuck holes” across the roads, which are at least alarming to the stranger traveler in a dense piney woods road v, hen the stars are hidden by lowering clouds. Meeting one of such places, his horse and vehicle, without warning, suddenly plunges through the darkness with an abrupt jolt into the water almost oat of sight-he imagines. At this stage of Isis journey, the traveler is undetermined whether he kept the “straight road,” as directed-notwithstanding its many twists and turns-or whether he is on his way across some deep mill pond, or navigable stream whose pitying waters may wash his remains to its distant shores, to form a fit subject for the “coroner to sit on,” and determine whether the “stranger committed suicide,” or was waylaid and dropped in the stream. Before he has located himself, or determined in his mind as to where his remains may be found, his horse gives a snort and a bound, and carries vehicle and traveler on dry ground. Just then he forgets his former peril in giving vent to his former nervousness by saying something about the people in that neighborhood being “too lazy to mend the roads.”\n\nIt is frequently found that a darn across a mill pond is used as a public road. Many such dams are winding, and thus obstruct the view of the road from end to end, and such road beds are often too narrow to admit of vehicles passing each other upon the dam.\n\nBefore the Civil War, very many persons, male and female, rode horseback, and thus could shun the worst parts of the road. The more wealthy rode in their family coach; the doctors and lawyers used gigs, a two wheeled vehicle now entirely out of usage.\n\nA clipping from “The Free Lance,” a newspaper published in the city of Fredericksburg, Virginia, shows the condition of some of the public roads at the present day.\n\n“DUNNSVILLE, ESSEX COUNTY, Oct. 23, 1906\n\nThe roads are continued mud holes, and the creeks swollen above the bridges over them. The water was nearly knee deep on Ware’s creek bridge Saturday, and the cause-way leading to it almost past fording. Trible swamp, on the road from Dunnsville to Cox’s store, is a menace to life and limb, and should be bridged at once. Mr. E. M. W., Jr., reports that the water was up to his buggy body even before the last heavy rain. With such conditions before us at this season, what may we expect the roads to be by Christmas, and for patience sake, what in February? The mail driver from Tappahannock to Walkerton had to swim his horse today, and the same may be said of the driver from Dunnsville to Daisy.”\n\nDeep sandy roads during a dry spell are as tedious and tiresome to travel through as would be a deep bed of snow. Roads of this character are sometimes corduroyed.\n\nThe roads containing the deepest sand beds are more frequently found in the interior of the peninsulas, remote from the navigable streams. There is one such noted place in Caroline County, humorously nicknamed “Sandy Lane.” A traveler passing through that section asked an old negro resident whom be met on a hot summer’s day, laboriously plodding through its deep, dry sands: “How come so much sand here, Uncle?”\n\n“Well, Boss,” said he, “I’ve hearn it happen’d dis yore way: On de Saturd’y evenin’ w’en de worl` wuz mos’ finish’d dar wuz a right smaht heap o’ san’ lef’ ovah dat want no use, an’ de Lawd He say to Rime% ‘I mus’ fin’ a place fur d is yore heap o’ San’; an’ w’en He look down ‘pon de yearth, lie spied a right smaht big hole right yere. (fell, sub, dey say de Lawd sot up all dat Saturd’y night shuv’lin’ san’ right yore in Sandy Lane, an’ w’en Sund’y mornin’ cum, Ile wuz tired an’ He say to Hisse’f ` I mus’ take a res’ dis day shore.’ I tells yo’ Boss, ef it hadn’t bin Toy Sandy Lane in of Kal-line County, de wite folks would a wucked us poh Di09g seben days in ev’ry week, an’ dar wouldn’t bin no Sund’y but Toy Sandy Lane. Dat’s how cum Sund’y ‘pinted de day to res’ yo’se’f. Thank de Lawd To’ Sandy Lane.”\n\nWhere the public roads lead across rivers and deep creeks, they are crossed in many places by means of “flat boats,” which are propelled by a rope stretched across the stream from bank to bank, and fastened to stakes or logs embedded in the earth. The flat boats have two parallel upright standards at either end, and some of them a wheel or block between the standards upon which the rope “travels” as the boat is pulled from shore to shore.\n\nTo permit a ready entrance of vehicles and animals into the boat, it is provided with an “apron” at either end. The aprons are hinged platforms attached to the ends of the boat, and projecting outward from the ends several feet. When the boat reaches the shore, the outer side of the apron is lowered until it reaches the earth, thus affording a gradually inclining passage to and from the boat. While crossing the stream, the aprons, are held up above the water by means of “sweep poles” run through rings upon each of the outer sides of the aprons, and through other rings upon the floor of the boat. The aprons are swung, as it were, upon the ends of the sweep.\n\nOn the country roads of Tidewater Virginia, no one passes another without some show of courtesy, or familiar recognition. Acquaintances exchange greetings by inquiry about each other’s health, and that of their families, and engage in discussing the latest important or interesting event relative to their section, state or nation. This takes time, but every Tidewater Virginian has time alw"
