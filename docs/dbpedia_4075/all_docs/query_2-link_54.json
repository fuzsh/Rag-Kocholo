        "text": "Christchurch School celebrated its 101st graduation exercises on Saturday, May 28, 2022, at 9 a.m. under the great oak tree on Bell Tower Hill, overlooking the Rappahannock River. Head of School John E. Byers delivered the commencement address. In what has become a hallmark of the ceremony, he closed by addressing every one of the fifty-four graduates personally, remarking on the special gifts and talents that each brought to the school community.Â\n\nThis was the final graduation for Christchurch's 16th Head of School who will retire at the end of June as the longest-serving head in school history. CCS Board of Governors President Lynne Little presented Byers with a resolution from the board. The flag that flew over the ceremony will be presented to him as a parting gift.\n\nMr. Byers opened by reminding the graduates of all the people invested in them: parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, cousins, friends, faculty, and staff. \"There may never be a time when so many people are so focused on you and your success in life. So soak it in. You are loved.\"\n\nByers also reminded the graduates that it is by grace that they have this experience here, in this place, with each other. \"As the Gospel of John says, we all have received grace upon grace. Have we not had this privilege that only a few in our world can imagine? Will you share your gifts with the world? Will you give of yourselves to something greater than just you? So, understand your power to do great things because of the grace you have received. Imagine greatly where such grace and such gifts will take you â¦ refuse to settle â¦ your destiny is greater than that. Believe in a YOU that you may not yet see completely.Â\n\nSo how will you return such grace and such gifts as you have been given? First, acknowledge your grace, and your gifts, and rejoice with thanksgiving. Second, you serve others and multiply your grace and gifts. Third, you reject the superficial and the shallow by getting literally and symbolically outdoors, out in the world, where the great needs of the world will call you to make a life of consequence.\"Â\n\nByers closed by encouraging the graduates to \"give back. Give of yourself. And the rewards will lift you to heights unimaginable.\"\n\n\"We are one, you and this family â¦ and Christchurch is forever.Â\n\nGodspeed, 2022.\"\n\nMr. Byers, Associate Head of School Dr. Neal Keesee, and Chair of the Board Mrs. Lynne Little conferred diplomas. Following the ceremony, each graduate rang the Second Century Bell and passed through the Bell Tower to be received by the faculty.Â\n\nGraduates included Progress Award winner Cameron Carlstedt DeVries of Urbanna and Chaplain's Award winner and legacy Robert Latane Montague, V of Alexandria.Â\n\nThe school's highest honor, the Bishop's Award, went to Majesty Sari Wilson of Sandys, Bermuda. The Valedictorian's Award was earned by legacy Jackson Edward Kiland (Ing Kiland '92) of Christchurch.Â\n\nOther awards were presented to seniors the previous evening at the Senior Awards Ceremony. Recipients included the following students: Outstanding Student Award (female): Taylor Berry of Saluda; Outstanding Student Award (male): Jackson Kiland; Best All-Around Male Athlete Award: Jaxon Gill of Ontario, Canada; Best All-Around Female Athlete Award: Taylor Berry; Student Life Award: Aidan Iaconis of Marco Island, FL;"
