William died 20 Mar 1594 in Boveney, Berkshire, England.\n\nPeter’s mother Margaret Malthouse was born 15 Feb 1559 in Binfield, Berkshire, England. Her parents were John Malthouse and Margaret Bullock. Margaret died 1594 in Binfield, Berkshire, England\n\nPeter’s grandfather Robert Montague was born between 1505 and 1528 in Boveney, Berkshire, England, His parents were William Montague and Joan Grow. He married Margaret Cotton. Robert died 10 Jan 1575 in Boveney, Berkshire, England.\n\nPeter’s grandmother Margaret Cotton was born 1528 in Wardville, Berkshire, England. Her parents were Roger Cotton and [__?__]. Margaret died in 1575 in Boveney, Berkshire, England.\n\nPeter’s great grandfather William Montague was born in 1485 in Buckingham, Berkshire, England. He married Joan Grow. William died 21 Mar 1555 in Boveney, Buckinghamshire, England.\n\nJoan Grow was born in 1489 in Wardville, Berkshire, England. Joan died in 1540 in Boveney, Buckinghamshire, England.\n\nThe starting point for documentation of the Montagues of Boveney is the Visitation of the County of Buckingham made in 1634, referred to hereinafter as “the Visitation”. The Visitation begins with Robert who married Margaret Catton of Wardville Berks. producing two children, Laurence and William.\n\nThe lineage continues through William who married Margaret Malthaus of Pynfield Bucks (Berks) from which issued five children. The youngest of these five, Peter, married Ellen Allen of Burnham, to become the parents of Richard Montague of Massachusetts and Peter Montague of Virginia. Except for the statement “Peter now in Virginia 1634”, there are no other dates recorded on the Visitation. As an aside, it should be noted that the Visitation pedigree shows a line drawn from “Peter now in Virginia 1634”, up to Peter’s Uncle George. Subsequent research to supply dates to the pedigree has determined that the visitation scribe, or perhaps the printer, drew the line to the wrong father for that group of children.\n\nHGPM, p. 27, asserts that from 1500 to 1550, two brothers (William and John) lived in the County of Buckingham and Parish of Burnham, England. William, the eldest of the two, had four children–one of them named Robert. Without offering any evidence, the author, Mr. Montague “anoints” this Robert as the Robert described in the Visitation. While he states that William’s will was proved March 21, 1550, he does not provide its contents. Here, reprinted with permission from The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, Vol. 142, p. 152, of Ms. Hydes’ article are the contents of that will:\n\n“A photocopy of the original has been procured (Buckingham Record Office, Archdeaconry of Buckinghamshire Wills, March 1550/51). Dated 16 March 1550/51 and probated 21 March 1550/51, it calls him “Will’m Mountaguewe the Elder of Boveney in the p’r’she of Burnh’m, Fyssherman.” “Will’m Mountaguewe of Bray my eldyst sonne” was to receive the messuage at Bray where he was living, over the river northwestward in Berkshire. “Jone my wyffe duringe her lyffe” was to have the family dwelling in Boveney with ten acres and another lease of land. “Robt’e Mountagewe my yongist Sonne” was eventually to have Jone’s legacy and also a messuage called “Durdants w’t syxtene akers of arable lande medowe & pasture” that William had purchased. William additionally named daughters Alice and Katherine. Executors were to be his wife Jone and “Robt’ Mountague my youngiste sonne, Robt’e noneage [a minor].” Overseers were to be Thomas Grow and “Robt’e Mountagewe of Bovney.” As William’s son Robert was a minor in 1551, he cannot be the Robert born about 1505. Probably the overseer Robert Montague of Boveney was the Robert born about 1505. Possibly he was William’s brother.”\n\nThe de facto authority on the pre-colonial ancestry of Peter Montague of Boveney, England is History and Genealogy of Peter Montague of Nansemond and Lancaster Counties, Virginia, and His Descendants, 1621-1894 by George William Montague (1894) (HGPM). This authority has remained mostly unchallenged since publication, but more recent researchers have questioned some of its assumptions and conclusions.\n\nFor example, HGPM presents a careful, detailed review of the lineage of Drogo de Montagu, the forefather of all English Montagues – famous, royal, and commoner alike. Against this backdrop, HGPMhypothesizes, but does not prove, that the “pedigree [of the Montagues of Boveney] is clear and perfect from the American branch (1634) back to A.D. 1500 and lacks (from there) two generations, possibly three, to make a perfect record back to the conquest of England, A.D. 1066.”\n\nOver the past ten decades, this hypothesis quietly became a “well-known” fact as those missing “two generations, possibly three” got found (WARNING: speculative material posted here — > Montague Proposed Noble and Royal Lines). However, some contrary conclusions of more recent research have been compiled and published by Robert Vaughan Montague III on the website of House of Montague, an organization which he created to be a centralized, authoritative repository for the Montague families that immigrated to and colonized America before the 20th century. English, French, German, Irish and Scottish branches of the family are examined. The thesis of House of Montague is that the Montagues of Boveney “appeared” on the scene circa 1505 without portfolio or, if one prefers, pedigree. While the pre-1500 “roots” of the Montagues of Boveney may ultimately prove to be royal, it is as likely to prove otherwise. The earliest ancestor of the Virginia immigrant who can be positively identified is a Robert Montague who was probably born about 1505.\n\nChildren\n\n1. Peter Montague\n\nPeter Montague came to Virginia in 1621, when sixteen years of age. He settled first on the plantation of Samuel Matthews.\n\nThe elder Samuel Mathews was the first of the Mathews family to emigrate from England to Virginia, arriving at Jamestown by 1619. He eventually had several other land holdings, including one near Henricus and another at Old Point Comfort. Known as Colonel Mathews, the elder Samuel became one of the most prominent men in the colony. He was a member of the Governor’s Council and was actively involved in conflicts with the Native Americans. In 1635, he was one of the leaders of the popular mutiny that ousted Royal Governor Sir John Harvey. Upon returning to England, the elder Mathews was eventually cleared of any charges; upon returning to Virginia, he resumed service on the Governor’s Council until 1644\n\nPeter Montague afterwards removed to Upper Norfolk (Nansemond), which he represented in the House of Burgesses in 1652 and 1653. About 1654, probably, he removed to Lancaster (then including Middlesex), and represented that county also from 1651 to 1658.\n\nIn the “Adventures of Purse and Person, pg 40, Peter Montaque he is listed as a servant, age 21, on the Charles in 1621.\n\nFrom the narrative by George W. Montague in 1894, “There is a tradition in one branch of Peter’s descendents which can be traced back as far as 1730, to the effect that ‘Peter was rather wild, that he ran away from home, went to America, and not being in funds had not the cash to pay for his passage and was sold for his passage money. The first half-day’s work he did ruin his hands so that he had to rest. To pass the time he began to read his master’s books, who caught him reading Latin, and soon obtained for him the position of a school teacher.\n\nHe was a large landowner and a leading citizen, and was styled “Col. Peter Montague,” from his rank in the militia. His will, proved May 27, 1659, is on record in Lancaster.\n\nAs described in the 1894 compilation (HGPM), Peter’s gravesite was identified on the north side of the Rappahannock river, “much defaced by the hand of time”. A new monument was erected on this location in Oct, 1903, by then Governor of Virginia, Andrew Jackson Montague–sixth great grandson of Peter. The grave site is now maintained by the Montague Memorial Association, and as of 2003 was being overseen by the Governor’s grandson, Robert Latane Montague, of Urbanna, Middlesex Co., VA\n\nAmong his most prominent descendants prominence were Col. Philip Montague, who served actively in various commands in the Middlesex militia during the Revolution; Lewis Montague, sheriff of Middlesex, 1762; Col. James Montague, of Middlesex, member of the Convention of 1776, and County Lieutenant during the Revolution; Rev. Philip Montague, a distinguished Baptist minister; Richard Montague, Lieutenant State Navy in the Revolution; General Chas. P. Montague of Maryland; Lieutenant Walter P. Montague, C.S.N.; Prof. Andrew P. Montague, Columbia University; Judge Robert Latane Montague, Lieutenant-Governor of Virginia, member of Confederate Congress (of whom there is a portrait); Edgar Burwell Montague, colonel 32d Va. Infantry, C.S.A.; Lieutenant Wm. L. Montague, C.S.A., mortally wounded at the Crater, and Capt. Thos. B. Montague, C.S.A., also injured at the Crater.\n\nPeter first married Hannah [__?__] about 1629.\n\nPeter’s second wife Cicely Reynolds (wiki) was born about 1605 in Dorset, England. Her parents were Thomas Reynolds and Cicely Phippen. Her grandparents were [our ancestors] Christopher REYNOLDS and Clarissa HUNTINGTON Cicely died 12 Sep 1660 in Charles City, Charles, Virgina.\n\nAlternatively, Peter’s second wife was Cecily Matthews, daughter of Samuel Matthews, the owner of the Virginia plantation where Peter first worked. Cecily’s brother was Samuel Mathews Jr. (1630–1660), of Warwick County Virginia, a member of the House of Burgesses, the Governor’s Council, and Royal Governor of Virginia from 1656 to 1660.\n\nCecily Reynolds first married Thomas Bailey (b. 1580 in England d. 20 Sep 1620 in Jamestown, Charles City, Virginia. Next she married Samuel Jordan (wiki) (b. 1578 in England d. 1623 in Virginia). She married third to William Farrar. She married our Peter Montague fourth around 1645. After Peter died, she married Thomas Parker (b. 1600 in Burnham, Buckinghamshire, England d. 1663 in Isle Wight, Virginia. Cicely died 12 Sep 1660 in Charles City, Virginia.\n\nCicely’s parents died before 1611 when Cecily traveled to Virginia with her aunt and uncle Joan Phippen and Capt. William Pierce. Joan was her mother’s twin sister.\n\nWilliam Pierce was born about 1570. He may have died in the Indian massacre on Mar 22, 1622. According to John Smith’s list of the dead of that massacre, it says that “at Apamatucks River, at Master Peirce his Plantation, five miles from the College.”\n\nCaptain Pierce came to Virginia in 1610 on the ill-fated “Sea Venture” with Capt. Thomas Gates. Jone, his wife, children (William, Joan, Jr., and Thomas) came in 1611 on the “Blessing“. She also brought with her a young niece, Cicilly Reynolds, age 10, probably to help care for the younger children.\n\nCapt. Pierce had a home in James Cittye and a plantation on Mulberrie Island. In addition to the lands named above, Capt. Pierce owned large holdings in various sections of Virginia. On June 22, 1625, he received grant of 2,000 acres for transporting into Virginia 50 persons. May 1623 Gov. Francis Wyatt appointed him Capt. of the Guard and Gov. of the City.\n\nIn that year, as Lt. Gov. of James Cittye he led an expedition against the Chickahominy, in retaliation for the 1622 Massacre, falling on them on July 23rd, with no small slaughter. Shortly thereafter, George Sandys, Treasurer of Virginia, wrote to England that Capt. William Peirce “Gov. of Jamestown” was inferior to none in experience, ability and capacity, recommending him for appointment to the Council, which appointment was made 1631, at which time he was living in Surry County. [It was Capt. Pierce who transported to Virginia the renowned Capt. John Rolfe, soon to become his son-in-law] In 1629/30 he was in England, and while there prepared a “Relation of the Present State of the Colony of Virginia”, by Capt. William Pierce, and Ancient Planter of 20 years standing. His wife, Mrs. Jone Pearse accompanied him and was known in England as an honest, industrious woman, who after passing 20 years in Virginia, on her return to England reported that “she had a garden at Jamestown containing 3 or 4 acres,where in one year she had gathered an hundred bushels of excellent figs, and that of her own provisions she could keep a better home in Virginia than in London – for 3 or 4 hundred pounds a year, although she had gone there with very little.”\n\nThey returned to Virginia, and while in the Council, Dec. 20th he signed an Amity Agreement between that body and Gov. John Harvey. He was displeased with Harvey’s governing of the colony and was one of the Councillors who arrested and disposed him in 1635, leading the Musketeers who surrounded his house. Capt. Pierce went on an expedition to the Northern Neck, called “Chicoan” in 1645. Surry County, Va. records, 21 Jan. 1655, Book 1, p. 116: Capt. William Pierce, his son, Thomas and grandson William Peirce were living on Mulberry Island, Warwick Co., VA.\n\nCicely’s aunt Joan Phippen was born about 1578 and died 1650. In A Durable Fire, the following comments were made about Joan:\n\n“Joan Pierce, brisk blackhaired young woman, who shared the house with Meg Worley and Temperance Yardley (during the Starving Time) had taken her 4 year old daughter and her servant girl to stay at another house , so as not to see Sarah’s last dying moments. Joan Pierce hated Jamestown even more than Temperance did. “There’s nothing here but sickness and laziness.”‘\n\n“Tempers were short these days. Even the soft spoken were sharp, and those with a cantankerous nature, like Joan Pierce, were as easily provoked as hornets.”\n\n“Joan Pierce, who lived next door to Governor Yeardley, had put on weight after the Starving Time. She took pride in her cooking and equal pleasure in eating.” She had plump hands.\n\nChild of William Pierce and Joan Phippen\n\ni. Jane Pierce b. 1588; d. 1625-35 Jamestown; m1. John Rolfe (Yes, that John Rolfe) m2. Roger Smith\n\nRolfe’s second wife was the Indian Princess, Pocahontas, daughter of the great Chief, Powhatan.\n\nOn what, in modern terms, was a “public relations trip” for the Virginia Company, Pocahontas and Rolfe traveled to England in 1616 with their baby son, where the young woman was widely received as visiting royalty. However, just as they were preparing to return to Virginia, she became ill and died. Their young son Thomas Rolfe survived, and stayed in England while his father returned to the colony.\n\nIn 1619, Rolfe married Jane Pierce. They had a daughter, Elizabeth, in 1620. Rolfe died in 1622 after his plantation was destroyed in an Indian attack. It remains unclear whether Rolfe died in the Indian massacre or whether he died as a result of illness\n\nCapt. Rolfe made his will in 1621 shortly after daughter Elizabeth was born. It was probated in London 1630, (copy in Va.) by his father-in-law, Capt. William Peirce. However, Capt. Rolfe was deceased. before 1625, as the Surry Co. Va muster of 1625 shows Capt. Roger Smith residing at his plantation on James Island, with wife – Mrs. Jone Smith, who came on the “Blessing”. Living with them was Elizabeth Rolfe, age 4, b. in Va.\n\nCicely’s first husband Thomas Bailey\n\nCicely Reynolds and Thomas Bailey were married in Virginia when she was at the tender age of 15. He was killed by Indians 20 Sep 1620.\n\nDespite her young age, legend says that she was spoken of as a “a notorious flirt” and “the Glamour Girl” in the colony. Within a few years she married her first husband Thomas Baley and–apparently before she was 17–bore their only child, Temperance.\n\nCicely’s second husband Samuel Jordan\n\nCecely and her daughter were living on their property that adjoined that of the commander of the local militia, Captain Samuel Jordan. A union of convience was entered into in which the property inherited by Mrs. Bailey reverted to her daughter when she married but until then it would be tended by Capt. Jordan. She then married Capt. Jordan. Today, Jordan Point is a small unincorporated community on the south bank of the James River in the northern portion of Prince George County, Virginia.\n\nOn 2 Jun 1609 the Sea Venture sailed for the first surviving English settlement in America. Among the 150 or so Adventurers and Planters aboard were Sir Thomas Gates (newly appointed Governor of the fledgling Jamestown Colony), Sir George Somers, John Rolfe (soon to be wedded to Pocahontas), Rolfe’s ill-fated first wife, and our young man, Samuel Jordan wiki .\n\nOn June 2, 1609, the Sea Venture set sail from Plymouth as the flagship of a seven-ship fleet (towing two additional pinnaces) destined for Jamestown, Virginia as part of the Third Supply, carrying 500 to 600 people. On July 24, the fleet ran into a strong storm, likely a hurricane, and the ships were separated. The Sea Venture fought the storm for three days. Comparably-sized ships had survived such weather, but the Sea Venture had a critical flaw in her newness: her timbers had not set. The caulking was forced from between them, and the ship began to leak rapidly. All hands were applied to bailing, but water continued to rise in the hold.\n\nThe ship’s guns were reportedly jettisoned (though two were salvaged from the wreck in 1612) to raise her buoyancy, but this only delayed the inevitable. The Admiral of the Company, Sir George Somers himself, was at the helm through the storm. When he spied land on the morning of July 25, the water in the hold had risen to nine feet, and crew and passengers had been driven past the point of exhaustion. Somers deliberately drove the ship onto the reefs of what proved to be Bermuda in order to prevent its foundering. This allowed all 150 people aboard, and one dog, to be landed safely ashore.\n\nThe survivors, including several company officials and Samuel Jordan were stranded on Bermuda for approximately nine months. During that time, they built two new ships, the pinnaces Deliverance and Patience, from Bermuda cedar and parts salvaged from the Sea Venture, especially her rigging. The original plan was to build only one vessel, the Deliverance, but it soon became evident that she would not be large enough to carry the settlers and all of the food (salted pork) that was being sourced on the islands. While the new ships were being built, the Sea Venture’s longboat was fitted with a mast and sent under the command of Henry Ravens to find Virginia. The boat and its crew were never seen again.\n\nSome members of the expedition died in Bermuda before the Deliverance and the Patience set sail on 10 May 1610. Among those left buried in Bermuda were the wife and child of John Rolfe, who would found Virginia’s tobacco industry, and find a new wife in Powhatan princess Pocahontas. Two men, Carter and Waters, were left behind; they had been convicted of unknown offences, and fled into the woods of Bermuda to escape punishment and execution. The remainder arrived in Jamestown on 23 May.\n\nThis was not the end of the survivors’ ordeals, however. On reaching Jamestown, only 60 survivors were found of the 500 who had preceded them. Many of these survivors were themselves dying, and Jamestown itself was judged to be unviable. Everyone was boarded onto the Deliverance and Patience, which set sail for England. The timely arrival of another relief fleet, bearing [our ancestor] Governor Thomas WEST, 3rd Baron de la Warr, which met the two ships as they descended the James River, granted Jamestown a reprieve. All the settlers were relanded at the colony, but there was still a critical shortage of food. Somers returned to Bermuda with the Patience to secure provisions, but died there in the summer of 1610. His nephew, Matthew, the captain of the Patience, sailed for England to claim his inheritance, rather than return to Jamestown. A third man, Chard, was left behind in Bermuda with Carter and Waters, who remained the only permanent inhabitants until the arrival of the Plough in 1612. The ordeal was recounted by William Strachey, whose account is believed to have influenced the creation of Shakespeare’s play The Tempest .\n\nVery soon after arrival, Samuel Jordan carved out a place on land up the River from Jamestown and very near the present town of Hopewell VA. His land jutted out into a great James River curl he named “Jordan’s Point“. On this plantation he called “Jordan’s Journey” he built his manor house, “Beggar’s Bush”. The fact that he started quickly was probably a major reason he was prepared for the harsh winter that followed and was able to build a very substantial plantation.\n\nOn the day of the Great Indian Massacre March 22, 1622, Capt. Jordan at once ganthered all the men, women, and children into his home at “Begger’s Bush” , known later as Jordan’s Journey, and defended that place so resolutely that not a single life was lost; however, Capt. Jordan died before the census of the “Living and Dead in Virginia” was taken in February of 1623. The muster of the living at Begger’s Bush was: Sisley Jordan 24, Temperance Bailie 7, Mary Jordan 3, Margery Jordan 1, and William Farrar 31.\n\nA failed courtship\n\nJordan died a year later, and there was a rush for the hand of his beautiful young wife, led by the Rev. Greville Pooley. Jordan had been in his grave only a day when Pooley sent Capt. Isaac Madison to plead his suit. Cecily replied that she would as soon take Pooley as any other, but as she was pregnant, she would not engage herself she said, “until she was delivered.”\n\nBut the amorous Reverend could not wait, and came a few days later with Madison, telling her “he should contract himself to her” and spake these words: “I, Greville Poooley, take thee Sysley, to be my wedded wife, to have and to hold till death do us part and herto I plight thee my troth.” Then, holding her by the hand he spake these words, “I, Sysley, take thee Greveille, to my wedded husband, to have and to hold till death do us part.” Cicily said nothing, but they drank to each other and kissed. Then, showing some delicacy about her condition and the situation she found herself in, she asked that it might not be revealed that she did so soon bestow her love after her husband’s death.\n\nPooley promised, but was soon boasting of his conquest. Mrs. Jordan resenting this and chose to exercise her woman’s privilege to change her mind and said that “he could have fared better if he talked less.” She immediately announced her engagement to Capt. William Farrar, one of the Deputy Treasurer’s younger brothers, and member of the Council.\n\nEnraged, Pooley brought suit for breach of promise. When the Parson sued, 14 June 1623, Capt. William Farrar, trained for the law in England and now the attorney who administered her husband’s estate, successfuly defended Mrs. Jordan in what was the first breach of promise suit in America, winning not only the suit but his client in matrimony. The Governor and Council could not bring themselves to decide the questions and continued it until 27 Nov., then referred the case to the Council for Virginia in London, “desiring the resolution of the civil lawyers thereon and a speedy return thereof.” But they declined to make a decision and returned it, saying they “knew not how to decide so nice a difference.”\n\nAt this point Rev. Pooley was persuaded by the Rev. Samuel Purchase to drop the case. Cecily and William were finally free to marry, which they did sometime before May 2, 1625, when his bond as overseer of Samuel’s estate was canceled.\n\nPoole signed a formal release to the Widow Cecily bonding himself in the sum £500 never to have any claim, right or title to her, the Governor and Council of the Colony were so stirred by the extraordinary incident that they issued a solmn proclamation against a woman engaging herself to more than one man at a time. And there is not in Virginia any known record that this edict has ever been revoked.\n\nThe jilted Pooley soon found solace in a bride, it appears, but met a tragic death in 1629, when Indians attacked his house, and slew him, his wife and all his family.\n\nCecily’s third husband William Farrar\n\nIn 1625 Charles I appointed William Farrar to his King’s Council – a position of great responsibility which he held for over a decade.\n\nHolmes writes, “It was during this critical period, 1625-1635, that William Farrar served on the Council, considered by historians the most important in the government of the colony, for laws were passed and the representative form of government which we have today became well established, based on the liberal charter, which [Sir Edwin] Sandys and Nicholas Ferrar are said to have written.”\n\nIn 1626 William was also appointed commissioner “for the Upper Partes kept above Persie’s Hundred,” and given the authority to hold a monthly court at either Jordan’s Journey or Shirley Hundred.\n\nSometime before November 1627, William’s father died, leaving him a fairly large inheritance. This may have been what enabled him to apply for a patent on 2,000 acres of choice land on a bend in the James River, formerly the site of Henrico Towne.\n\nHenricus the second settlement in the colony, was established in 1611 and was the proposed site for the University of Henricus which was to be the first English university in America. The fortified settlement was burned to the ground in 1622 during the “Greate Massacre” and wasn’t opened up for resettlement until 1628 when William applied for the patent. [The area, which is still known as “Farrar’s Island,” is located 12 miles south of present-day Richmond and is the site of a state park.]\n\nSome researchers believe William and Cecily moved their family to Farrar’s Island at this time. Others have them remaining at Jordan’s Journey until 1631, the year in which William returned to England and disposed of his entire inheritance. He sold his Hertfordshire properties to his brother Henry and his annuities from the Ewoods to his brother John for a total of 240 pounds. The agreement he made with his brothers gave him the option of buying back the property at its sale price, but he never invoked the privilege, remaining in Virginia the rest of his life.\n\nIn May of 1636, Nathan Martin patented 500 acres, 100 of which was due “by surrender from William Farrar Esquire for transportation of two servants.” William died sometime between this date and June 11, 1637, when the patent to Farrar’s Island was granted to “William Farrar sonne and heire of William Farrar Esquire deceased, 2,000 acres for the transportation of 40 persons [indentured servants] at his own cost.”\n\nHolmes writes, “His land extending to Varina, the county seat, and his duties as “chief” justice of the county made him a close neighbor and associate of the leading families of Henrico, as well as of Charles Citty county. Continuing as a member of the Council until shortly before his death at the age of 43, he attended quarterly court at Jamestown and was closely associated with the governor, councilors and burgesses.”\n\nCicely’s fourth husband Peter Montague\n\nWhat became of Cecily after William’s death is unclear. She was only 36 when William died, so it seems likely that she remarried. She may have been the “Cecily” who married and had five children with Peter Montague. Peter died in July 1659, after which another “Cecily” was married to Thomas Parker of Macclesfield. Parker had come to Jamestown in 1618 on the “Neptune” with William Farrar.\n\nTo have withstood the perils of the New World took endurance enough, to do so while bearing eleven children and burying five husbands took fortitude and courage. Cecily Bailey-Jordan-Farrar-Montague-Parker was, at the very least, a survivor.\n\nPeter Montague’s Will dated 27 Mar 1659 and proved 25 May 1659\n\n“In the name of God amen, I Peter Montague being weak in body and perfect memory do make this my last will and testament, this the 27th of March 1659 in name and form following,\n\nFirst I bequeath my soul into the hands of my redeemer Jesus Christ, and my body to be buried.\n\nItem, my debts being first paid I give to my loving wife Cicely one third part of all my real and personal estate according to law.\n\nItem, I give to my two sons Peter and Will Mountague all my land lying on Rappahannock river to them and their heirs forever, and the land being divided it is my will, that the elder is to have the first choice, and in case of want of heirs of either, the survivor to enjoy all the land, and in case both of them shall depart this life without heirs, lawfully begotten, then my will is that the said land be sold by the commissioners of this county after public notice given either at an outcry, or by an inch of candle and the produce thereof to be equally divided between my three daughters Ellen, Margaret, and Elizabeth, and the child of Ann late wife of John Jadwin, and in case of any of these shall died without issue, then the produce of the said land to be divided between the survivors.\n\nItem, I give the other two thirds of my personal estate to my four children Peter, Will, Margaret, and Elizabeth to be equally divided among them.\n\nItem, I give to my daughter Ellen, the wife of Will Thompson, one thousand pounds of tobacco, and cask to be deducted, of a bill of thirteen hundred pounds of tobacco now due to me by the said Will Thompson. Lastly I ordain my loving wife cicely and my son Peter jointly Executrix and Executor of this my last will and testament. In witness of the previous I have hereunto set my hand and seal the day and year above written 1659 interlined before the signing and sealing therof. (Signed) Peter Mountague, (Ye seal)\n\nChecking Our Facts\n\nWhile the above stories are lots of fun, despite calims that may be made to the contrary, at this time the maiden name of Cicely is not proven by any documentation that is available to us, and such documentation may never be found.\n\nIt has been suggested that Cicely Farrar might have outlived her third husband and gone on to marry other men, including Peter Montague as her fourth husband and his second wife. Despite the fact that Peter is known to have been married to a woman named Cecily at the time he wrote his will in 1659, no definite evidence has emerged to substantiate this theory and connect him positively with this Cicely. Only the first three marraiges are well-documented. By the time of William Farrar’s death, she was a wealthy woman. The Farrars were so prominent that if she had married again, some record would surely show it, although given the appalling state of Virginia records in the colonial period, it may not have survived. Her death date is also undocumented. Apparently no lineage society (such as Jamestown Society, Ancient Planters, or Colonial Dames, etc.) accepts any other marriages for Cecily except (1) a man probably named Baley, (2) Samuel Jordan and (3) William Farrar, due to documentation requirements.\n\nJohn Frederick Dorman (in Adventurers of Purse and Person, pp. 926-929) suggests it is “More likely, but unproved, that … [Cicely Montague] was Cicely, widow of Robert Jadwin, who later married Nicholas Jernew and left will dated 30 Jan. 1667/8 (Westmoreland Co. Deeds, Patents &c 1665-77,pp.32-32a) naming her Jadwin children, including son John [who married Peter Montague’s daughter Anne] and grandson Bartholomew Jadwin [son of John Jadwin and Anne Montague].” Therefore, another possibility is that Peter‘s presumed second wife, Cecily, was the daughter of William and Cecily Farrar, also named Cecily, who was born about 1625. Of this Cicely no further records have been found. Based on her age (20 years old in 1645 when the marriage likely occured), she was almost certainly not the mother of Peter’s last two children (William and Elizabeth). Also, this Cicely is definitely not the mother of Peter or his older siblings Anne and Ellen, as documented in Lancaster County Court Orders, 12 Sep 1660, stating,Cicely Montague Widdow of Mr. Peter Montague decd. & Peter Montague her Sonne in law Exors. to divide the Est.\n\nAn alternative theory posits that Peter’s second wife may have been Cecily Matthews, daughter of Samuel Matthews, the owner of the Virginia plantation where Peter first worked. Cecily’s brother was Samuel Mathews (Jr.) (1630–1660) of Warwick County, Virginia, a member of the House of Burgesses, the Governor’s Council and Royal Governor of Virginia from 1656 to 1660..\n\nChildren of Peter and Cicely\n\ni. Ann Montague b. 1630 in Virginia; d. 1659 Westmoreland, Virginia; m. John Jadwin (b. 13 Apr 1634 in London, England; d. May 1707 in Talbot, Maryland)\n\nJohn Jadwin born before 1638 at London, England; died after 31 Oct 1700 at Talbot Co, MD. He was the only one of the three grandsons of the “Virginia Adventurer” Thomas Jadwyn – to have male issue. “Robert and Jeremiah were Episcopalians (Anglicans). John was a Quaker. England at the time was Puritan, and all the Jadwins enumerated above were persecuted and left England on that account. Robert and Jeremiah. . .found themselves at home among friends in the province of Virginia, for Virginia received Episcopalians throughout Cromwell’s rule. But John, being a Quaker, had to ‘leave.’ John’s wife, Ann Montague Jadwin, died before 1659, he returned to England. John then married Hannah (surname unknown), and then settled in Talbot Co, MD.” Cornelius Comegys Jadwin, in HJ 47. With his two wives, John Jadwin sired an enormous family!\n\nii.

Mary Doodes/Marie Minor (b. 1642 in Christchurch, Middlesex, Virginia d. 1682 in Middlesex, Virginia)\n\n“Peter Mountague (1603-1659) was an active merchant in Virginia as his then deceased father and uncle had been in England. It may have been in connection with his merchant business with Holland that he first met the Sea Captain, Meindert Doodes, in Nansemond Co., Virginia. The two families of Mountague and Doodes (later transliterated to Minor) probably moved together in mid to late 1656 to Lancaster Co., Virginia, where Doodes Minor married Elizabeth Mountague around 1671 and Peter Mountague (ca. 1638ca. 1682) married Mary Minor by 1665.”\n\nA fair number of researchers believe that Mary Montague, daughter of Peter & Mary (Doodes/Minor) Montague, may have been the widow Mary Johnson, 2nd wife of Col. Joseph Ball. Why is this particular fact interesting? Because Joseph and Mary Ball’s daughter Mary Ball Washington was the mother of George Washington.\n\nAt the heart of this issue is the maiden name of Mary Johnson. What follows is a complete, source-based presentation of the facts surrounding the issue. It includes all documentation known to this writer, as of this writing, concerning Mary Montague, Joseph Ball, Mary Johnson, and Mary Ball. Unfortunately these facts are not sufficient to know her maiden name. For now, we can only judge the relative probability of Mary’s maiden identity from a limited number of potential candidates. We open this treatment with the earliest known documented discussion of George Washington’s presumed maternal grandmother from George William Montague’s, History and Genealogy of Peter Montague of Nansemond and Lancaster Counties, Virginia, and His Descendants, 1621-1894. (Amherst, Massachusetts: Carpenter & Morehouse, 1894, p. 48 (Hereinafter cited as HGPM)\n\n“A tradition has existed for fifty years or more, that George Washington was of Montague descent, through his mother Mary Ball. It probably originated from the fact that William Montague married, 1727, a dau. of Capt. Richard Ball, who was Mary Ball’s cousin [their fathers were brothers]. This subject has been thoroughly investigated by Rev. Horace E. Hayden in his Va. Genealogies, published Wilkes-Barre, Pa., 1891. The compiler also has made a thorough search, and left no means untried to obtain the truth. The result is, that the only place where such descent could be possible, was through Mary Ball’s mother who was, before Col. Ball married her, a Mrs. Mary Johnson, a widow, of Lancaster Co., Va. A tradition exists in the Ball family that Mrs. Mary Johnson was born in England. This tradition has been traced to Mrs. Ann Shearman, whose mother was Esther Ball, the half sister of Mary Ball. If it is true, that she was born in England, then – any descent from Peter Montague was impossible. No record has been found to show the maiden name of Mrs. Mary Johnson, or who she was before her marriage to Johnson. If she was a Miss Montague, she would have to be a daughter of one of the sons of the emigrant Peter Montague. One of his sons did have a daughter whose name was Mary Montague, but church records prove that she married, Oct. 24, 1682, Thomas Payne, and no record exists to show that she ever afterward married any one else. Records of that time and locality are lost, and the maiden name of Mrs. Mary Johnson [Washington’s grandmother] will probably never be known.”\n\niv.
