        "text": "MONTAGUE, MI – The president of the Montague school board resigned this week following infighting about whether the district should keep its varsity boys basketball coach.\n\nAfter a contentious special meeting on Monday, May 20, the board president is leaving, and the basketball coach is staying.\n\nThe board vice president submitted his resignation on Tuesday, May 14, which leaves the remaining five trustees to appoint two new board members.\n\nFormer president Chris Stark submitted her resignation, effective immediately, after the meeting Monday that included motions seeking to keep the coach and to remove her from the president role.\n\n“My resignation was more a result of realizing that the board is choosing to micromanage rather than support its administration,” Stark told MLive/Muskegon Chronicle on Thursday, May 23.\n\nStark was in the minority on Monday when she supported the administration that had already requested Varsity Basketball Coach Dave Osborne’s resignation.\n\n“It is not our job to micromanage our administration, but to support them and their choices,” Stark said regarding the basketball coach. “The administration made a decision, based 100 percent on unemotional facts that were documented -- and 1 percent of the community spoke up, which was 100 percent emotional.\n\n“I was not going to allow public comment, gossip or slander of board members to persuade me to not trust our administration,” she added.\n\nThe documented facts are in Osborne’s personnel file, Stark said.\n\nMLive/Muskegon Chronicle requested the file through a Freedom of Information Act request on Thursday. The district has not yet released the file.\n\nThe administration “was looking to move in a different direction,” Montague Area Public Schools Superintendent Jeffrey Johnson said in a statement following the board decision to keep Osborne. On Tuesday, he told MLive Muskegon Chronicle that retaining Osborne would “be a positive thing in the long run.”\n\nA motion to have Stark resign as president was made during the meeting Monday by then-vice president Amanda Unger, who became defacto board president after Stark’s resignation.\n\nUnger’s motion was not seconded and there was no vote, according to the draft meeting minutes. Nonetheless, Stark announced her resignation at the end of the meeting.\n\nThe motion was not a surprise, although it was based on “rumors and not facts,” said Stark, who had been on the board since 2007.\n\nEarlier in the meeting, the board voted to make Unger vice president in the wake of former vice president Michael Moore’s resignation. According to board policy, the vice president assumes the role of president if the president resigns.\n\nUnger’s husband, Mark Unger, is the junior varsity boys basketball assistant coach.\n\nAmanda Unger’s motion to remove Stark from the presidency came after Stark was in the minority in the 4-2 vote to retain Osborne, according to draft minutes. The motion regarding the coach was made by secretary Cindy Francis and seconded by trustee Tom Johnson, and was supported by Unger and trustee Scott Beishuizen. Stark and treasurer Blair Moreau cast the dissenting votes.\n\nUnger didn’t answer questions from MLive Muskegon Chronicle regarding her motion to remove Stark and her vote to retain Osborne. Instead she emailed the following statement:\n\n“It is the MAPS board’s position that rather than revisiting recent board discussions, all parties are committed to moving forward to building relationships and working to provide the best educational experiences we can for our students.\"\n\nWhile most board members went against the administration’s wishes to remove Osborne from his coaching job, the board seems to be supportive of Johnson. The superintendent received a 3.5 out of 4 in his annual evaluation, which the board approved on May 13.\n\nMoore submitted his resignation letter on Tuesday, May 14, after serving on the board for about six years. It was considered by the board on Monday.\n\nHis resignation was indirectly related to the basketball coaching dispute, as the matter required time and attention that he could not give after taking on a second job title at West Shore Community College, Moore told MLive Muskegon Chronicle on Thursday. He is the facilities and recreation director for the college in Mason County.\n\n“I know it’s not really good timing with some of the stuff going on,” Moore said.\n\nMoore is supportive of the administration and said Johnson has “done a great job.”\n\nThe remaining five board members are expected to appoint replacements for Stark and Moore in June.\n\nCitizens older than 18, who live in the Montague school district, may apply to fill a board vacancy by submitting a letter of interest to the board by 4 p.m. on Thursday, May 30, according to a news release. Letters should be sent to Montague Area Public Schools with attention to the board of education at 4882 Stanton Blvd., Montague, MI 49437.\n\nThe board will hold interviews with top candidates during a special meeting at 6 p.m. on Monday, June 3, at Montague High School, 4900 Stanton Blvd. in Montague.\n\nThe board is expected to select new trustees on June 3, but will refrain from formal votes until the regular board meeting on Monday, June 10, according to a district official.\n\nThe appointed trustees will fill the vacancies until trustees are elected on Nov. 3, 2020, and then sworn onto the board.\n\nStark’s term ends at the end of 2020 and Moore’s term goes through 2022. That means candidates could run in 2020 for either a full term or a partial term ending in 2022."
