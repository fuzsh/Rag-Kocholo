        "text": "If you take a passing casual interest in philosophy, there are probably at least two things you know about David Hume.\n\nOne thing — most recently in the news — is that he was a racist. In fact Hume's views on race were so objectionable that in September last year, the University of Edinburgh renamed its David Hume Tower after a storm of public protest.\n\nThe other thing you probably know about Hume is that he was a radical sceptic. He cast doubt on not only the existence of God, but also the supremacy of human reason, thus scandalising both the Christians and the Enlightenment humanists of his day.\n\nBut how accurate are these assessments of the 18th century Scottish philosopher? Let's take the scepticism first.\n\nA radical sceptic?\n\nThere's no question that Hume was a sceptic when it came to religion. He subjected both the Protestant and the Catholic Christianity of his day to deep and sustained criticism, and while he wasn't an atheist of the strident, dogmatic variety, he lived the life of an unbeliever.\n\nThis gained him a good deal of notoriety. In 1756, there was an effort to excommunicate him from the Church of Scotland. Hume's contemporary, the diarist James Boswell, called him \"the great infidel\", and even went to visit Hume on his deathbed in order to witness the amazing spectacle of an atheist approaching the end of life.\n\nSurely, Boswell thought, the terror of annihilation would prompt Hume to recant his views. He was wrong; Hume died in a state of cheerful and unrepentant godlessness.\n\nHume's scepticism also extended to the world of what we would today call science. One of his most famous claims had to do with cause and effect, and placed in a modern context it goes as follows:\n\nIf I'm careening downhill in my car and there's a stop sign at the bottom, I'm going to hit the brakes, which will make the car stop. I press down on the pedal, which engages the brake pads, which clamp onto the rotors, which force the car wheels to stop turning: a simple chain of cause and effect.\n\nBut how can I be sure about this?\n\nIf my car were made of glass and I could see all these mechanical processes taking place, what I observed would simply be a sequence of events — the actions of the brake pedal, then the pads, then the rotors and wheels. What I wouldn't observe would be incontrovertible evidence of any one thing causing any of the other things.\n\nSo how do I know that cause and effect is real?\n\nAccording to Hume, I don't — which is a little mind-bending to contemplate.\n\nHume on causation\n\nChains of cause and effect seem to be everywhere. Stubbing my toe causes pain; clapping my hands makes a noise; poking a bear provokes it to eat me.\n\nBut Hume's analysis says otherwise. Stubbing my toe, from a Humean perspective, is a bit like lighting a cigarette at the bus stop: just as the lit cigarette only appears to make the bus arrive, so stubbing a toe only appears to cause pain.\n\nAll I can say with any certainty is that in my experience thus far, every time I've stubbed a toe it has hurt. But that doesn't determine anything necessary about the future, and it certainly doesn't stack up to an ironclad universal law.\n\nAs Helen Beebee, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Manchester, puts it: \"It's certainly Hume's view that we can't prove any connection between events. There's no 'sensory impression', as Hume would put it, of causation. When you look at two billiard balls, you just see the one hitting the other and then the other one moving, you don't see any connection\".\n\nThis leads Hume to the conclusion that causation, far from being one of the fundamental laws of the universe, is more a projection of the human mind.\n\n\"As far as we can know, all that's out there in the world is just one thing happening, and then another\", says Professor Beebee.\n\n\"But then we have this impression of necessary connection, which we somehow impose upon reality. So in a sense, we invent the causal structure of the world\".\n\nThis sort of analysis has fixed Hume in the popular imagination as an arch sceptic. But was he really?\n\nAccording to the British philosopher and author Julian Baggini, we need to be careful when we apply the S-word to Hume.\n\n\"In some ways, yes, he was a radical sceptic. He didn't believe that by the use of reason alone, one can establish any of the most fundamental truths required for living — in particular, the existence of cause and effect\".\n\nBut this doesn't mean that Hume was the kind of sceptic who simply suspends judgement about the existence of any and every natural phenomenon.\n\n\"You still find philosophy textbooks that say 'Hume did not believe in cause and effect as a real power in nature'. And I think that's just obviously not true\", says Baggini.\n\n\"What Hume doesn't believe is that by observation or by logic we can prove that causation exists. It's something that reason can't establish — but it has to be taken as true nonetheless. Experience tells us that we're right to take it as true, even though our arguments are weak\".\n\nPast values vs the present\n\nSo much for the scepticism. But what about the racism?\n\nHume's birthplace, the city of Edinburgh, has a large statue of the philosopher on one of its famous cobblestone streets. In June last year, during a Black Lives Matter demonstration, protesters hung a placard around the statue's neck. On the placard was written \"I am apt to suspect the Negroes to be naturally inferior to the whites\" — words that appear as a footnote in Hume's 1753 essay \"Of National Characters\".\n\nIt wasn't long before the winds of protest were blowing in the direction of Edinburgh University, which had named one of its buildings David Hume Tower. By September, the building had been re-christened with a less contentious name: 40 George Square.\n\nThe whole affair gave rise to one of those perennial debates around how we should deal with the legacy of thinkers from the past whose views are offensive.\n\nShould Hume be given a pass, given that the vast bulk of his writing is eminently reasonable stuff, and he was only articulating the conventional wisdom of his time? Or should he be cancelled, consigned to the sin bin of history?\n\nAccording to Julian Baggini, both views are too simplistic.\n\nSome of Hume's contemporaries — in particular, his fellow Scottish philosopher James Beattie — challenged him on his racist views, to no apparent effect.\n\nBut whether or not this means we should condemn Hume's entire philosophical output is less clear, as it is with many philosophers whose work promotes ideas that today we find offensive.\n\nThe British classicist Edith Hall has claimed that the notorious misogyny of Aristotle, for example, can't simply be explained away. But his broader philosophy — based as it is on a fundamental respect for evidence and experience — is arguably not sexist. Hall believes that the ethical roots of Aristotle's work are egalitarian, and that were he alive today, he would readily accept the full humanity and equality of women.\n\nJulian Baggini sees Hume in a similar light. Some philosophers of the past, he says, espouse racist and sexist views that are not merely incidental to their work, but point to an inbuilt structure of imperialism and patriarchy. Hume, he says, is not one of these.\n\n\"If you look at all the major principles that Hume advocates, there is no doubt that he would reject any belief that was clearly in contradiction to the evidence. This means he would say today that so-called 'scientific racism' — which he seemed to be endorsing at the time — just doesn't stand up\".\n\nA philosopher, in other words, who embraced some of the worst ideas of his time — but whose work as a whole suggests he might well have embraced some of the better ideas of the present."
