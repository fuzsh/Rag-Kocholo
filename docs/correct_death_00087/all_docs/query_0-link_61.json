        "text": "A Scottish university is celebrating the 300th anniversary of the birth of philosopher David Hume with a year-long series of events.\n\nSpeakers from Europe and the US will speak at the University of Edinburgh, where Hume studied.\n\nThe programme of lectures, exhibitions and activities, beginning on Tuesday, will explore Hume's legacy and his ties to the university.\n\nHume and his associates were at the heart of the Scottish Enlightenment.\n\nDuring the 18th Century, Edinburgh became the focus of an outpouring of intellectual, literary and scientific achievements by figures such as Hume, economist Adam Smith and the physicist and chemist Joseph Black.\n\nMany of the key Enlightenment academics promoted a belief in the ability of people to think for themselves rather than simply believing what they were told.\n\nDavid Hume began his studies at the university in 1723, at the age of 12.\n\nHe initially considered a career in law, having been encouraged to do so by his mother, who came from a family of lawyers."
