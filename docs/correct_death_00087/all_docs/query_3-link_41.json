        "text": "1874 Â· Patronage abolished in theÂ Church of Scotland.\n\nThe Church Patronage Act 1874 was passed by Parliament and amended and altered the laws relating to the Appointment of Ministers to Parishes in Scotland. Paragraphs spelled out definitions to prevent the Act being subverted by processes used by Patrons and clarified that the Church of Scotland would decide on the qualifications required for Ministers.\n\n1878 Â· Collapse of theÂ City of Glasgow Bank.\n\nBecause of a discovery of a Â£7,000 deficit, City of Glasgow Bank halted operations from November to December 1877. After 10 months after reopening, the bankâs directors announced the bank, itself, had filed bankruptcy. The closure showed a net liability of over Â£6 million. The bank was so successful with telling people that it wasnât in error, that the Bank's shares were selling for more than double of what they were actually worth. The bankâs directors were arrested and tried at the High Court. All were found guilty and sentenced to terms of imprisonment. Many Glasgow businesses failed as a result of the bankruptcy and shareholders were called to replenish the bank's losses. One shareholder argued that he had become a shareholder unknowing the fraudulent actions of the bank. Wide effects of the collapse have been seen in limited growth in liability and extensive problems with temporary banking liquidity."
