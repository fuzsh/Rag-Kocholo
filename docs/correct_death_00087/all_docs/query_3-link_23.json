        "text": "Hello, friends of Ordinary Philosophy! I’m pleased and excited to announce my upcoming adventure: my first philosophical-historical themed adventure, and my first trip to Edinburgh, Scotland!\n\nHere’s my plan:\n\nI’m taking a series of trips to places around the world, where I explore the lives and ideas of great thinkers in the places where they lived and worked. I’ll follow in the footsteps of thinkers who are no longer alive, since those who are still telling their own stories. But those who are no longer alive in the body live on in the ideas that they pass on, and in the example they provide for us to follow.\n\nI’ve decided to start with the philosopher I most admire as a person as well as a thinker, the great David Hume. He was not only revered for the brilliance of his ideas and his honesty in presenting them, but also as a premier example of a genial, generous, great-hearted person; so much so, in fact, that one of his closest friends nicknamed him ‘Saint David’.\n\nHume is often described as the greatest philosopher to write in English and among the greatest philosophers of all time, period. He was a central figure in the Scottish Enlightenment, and a profoundly influential empiricist and moral philosopher\n\nSo off to beautiful Edinburgh I go! There, I’ll visit the places where he worked, thought, wrote, studied, and rested. I’ll be traveling there in the first two weeks of May, and will be writing throughout the trip. I’ll be writing in this blog not only about his ideas, but about what I can discover about his everyday life, and whatever feeling of his time and place I manage to uncover in my time there.\n\nIf you have any questions for me to answer while I’m there, or pictures you’d like me to take for you, or any information you have that could help me with this project, I’d love to hear from you!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHere are my essays on Hume as I discover him in my travels, in (roughly) chronological order:\n\nFirst Day in Old Edinburgh: Hume Sites and Monuments\n\nHume’s New Scene of Thought, and, It’s Good to Be Able to Say ‘I Don’t Know’\n\nHume Sites and Monuments, Part 2\n\nThe Consolations of Philosophy, and A Death Free from Fear\n\nScotticisms\n\nHappy 303rd Birthday, David Hume!\n\nCycling Through Edinburgh, First Time\n\nThe Debate Over Government and Freedom\n\nThe Tale of the Magic Toe – Superstition? Or What?\n\nHume Sites and Monuments, Part 3\n\nWater of Leith\n\nLast Day in Edinburgh, May 13th, 2014\n\nHume, Aristotle, and Guns\n\nand a memory quilt I created for my 2014 Edinburgh trip: A Hill and a Wall in Edinburgh, 2015, 102″ x 69″\n\nChirnside and Ninewells, Scottish Borders, Childhood and Summer Home of David Hume"
