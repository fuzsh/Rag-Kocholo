        "text": "Old Calton Burial Ground, 27 Waterloo Pl, Edinburgh EH1 3BQ\n\nDavid Hume’s two key works, A Treatise of Human Nature (1739–40) and An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (1748), are still studied by students of philosophy today. Although he is now best known as a philosopher, in his own day he was equally famous as a historian. While his genius was universally acknowledged, his sceptical philosophy was extremely controversial and led to him being passed over for professorships at the Universities of both Edinburgh and Glasgow. Instead he found a job as librarian at the Faculty of Advocates. His Essays on Natural Religion were so provocative that he never dared publish them in his lifetime.\n\nFind out more\n\nThe University of Edinburgh, Philosophy – David Hume\n\nStanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy – David Hume\n\nFor International Women’s Day on March 8, we are launching a new tour featuring locations in Edinburgh connected to amazing women in STEM.
