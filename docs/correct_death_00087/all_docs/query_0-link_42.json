        "text": "(1711–76). A Scottish philosopher and historian, David Hume was a founder of the skeptical, or agnostic, school of philosophy. He had a profound influence on European intellectual life.\n\nDavid Hume was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on April 26 (Old Style), 1711. His father, Joseph Hume (or Home), and his mother, Katherine Falconer, had grown up together as stepbrother and stepsister on the family estate of Ninewells in Berwickshire. Under the system of primogeniture Hume’s older brother was heir to the estate.\n\nDavid Hume was expected by his family to follow a traditional career in law. By the age of 18, however, after attending the University of Edinburgh from 1724 to 1726 and finding law distasteful, he enthusiastically plunged into the study of literature and philosophy. Hume later observed that his studies were “the ruling passion of my life, and the great source of my enjoyments.”\n\nFrom 1734 to 1737 Hume lived in France. There he wrote his first work, A Treatise of Human Nature. He was disappointed by its hostile reception and later dismissed it as an immature work that did not accurately reflect his views. In spite of this, the part on understanding continues to be widely read. Hume’s more immediately successful Essays, Moral and Political was published in 1741–42 after he had returned to Ninewells.\n\nFor a while Hume worked as a tutor. In the late 1740s he served as secretary to General James St. Clair on military missions in Brittany, Vienna, and Turin. With the publication of Political Discourses in 1752, he began his rise to international fame.\n\nIn 1751 Hume had been appointed keeper of the library of the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh. Using its historical collection for his research, he wrote his spectacularly successful A History of England, published in four volumes between 1754 and 1761. For decades this history, or a shortened version of it, was used as a standard text in English schools.\n\nHume served for some years as secretary and then as chargé d’affaires in the British embassy in Paris. He returned to London in 1766 and worked for a while as undersecretary of state. In 1769 Hume retired to live with his sister. In 1775 he was stricken by an incurable intestinal cancer. Upon learning of his illness Hume wrote, “I now reckon upon a speedy dissolution.” He coolly added, “. . . a man of sixty-five, by dying, cuts off only a few years of infirmities.” Hume died in Edinburgh on Aug. 25, 1776.\n\nHume’s philosophical writings cast doubt on the truth of church-supported dogmas. Charges of religious heresy permanently barred him from appointment as a professor in Scottish universities. Not only did he deny miracles and other religious dogmas, but his theory of knowledge seemed to undercut the reality of the world itself. He maintained that knowledge came from observation and experience. These, however, were purely individual. A person’s perceptions of objects were just that—perceptions. No underlying reality could ever be proved, because every individual’s perceptions are his alone—even if they agree with someone else’s. The “someone else” is also only a perception of the senses.\n\nIn his political writings Hume held that government organization, though basically evil, is necessary to guarantee human happiness. In economic theory Hume argued that goods rather than money are the basis of wealth. He believed that each part of the world has special products or services to offer and was an early advocate of increased trade among the nations of the world. Despite the intellectual controversy he aroused, Hume was admired and loved by his many friends, which included members of the clergy. He never married but contented himself with assuring the education of his brother’s children."
