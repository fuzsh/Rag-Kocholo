Early Origins of the Pietsch family

The surname Pietsch was first found in Silesia, where the name is thought to have entered into Germany from Poland. The personal name could be found in Silesia as early as 1372, when Petsche Seiler was recorded to be living in Liegnitz. The first records of the surname are slightly more recent; Bartel Pitsch was a resident of the city of Görlitz in 1504. The young Pietsch family was instrumental during this early period, and contributed greatly to the development of medieval Silesian society.
