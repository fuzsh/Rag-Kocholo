        "text": "JOSEPH, Chief Judge.\n\nPlaintiff (Sabre) was created in 1973 by three Montana ranchers who envisioned the conversion of eastern Oregon desert land into productive farmland with irrigation from the Columbia River. Sabre's primary cash crop was potatoes. At the relevant times, H.C. Jordan was chairman of Sabre's board and its treasurer. Pitsch was controller from April, 1977, to May, 1980, and became assistant secretary in August, 1978. Reid was president from March, 1977, until May, 1980, and Davidson was secretary and corporate counsel. The other defendants are all alleged to have been involved to a greater or lesser extent in the activities giving rise to the claims.\n\nPlaintiff makes two fundamental claims. The first is that Jordan and Reid breached their fiduciary duty to Sabre and usurped a corporate opportunity when they purchased Oregon Potato, Inc. (OPI), another large potato farming operation. Plaintiff also claims that Reid and Pitsch usurped a corporate opportunity for a lease of a potato storage shed and that, through various outside ventures, they breached their fiduciary duties by self-dealing. Plaintiff claims that the other defendants breached their fiduciary duties by aiding and abetting the officers' usurpation of Sabre's corporate opportunities.\n\nAfter a trial to the court, all of plaintiff's claims against each defendant were dismissed with prejudice in part on account of plaintiff's laches, and a judgment was entered. The court also entered judgment in favor of Jordan, Reid, Pitsch and Davidson on their counterclaims for indemnification of attorney fees and expenses for their defense.\n\nWe will only summarize the facts which led to this litigation. On March 20, 1978, Jordan announced to Sabre's board of directors that OPI was interested in selling its land, potato storage space and potato processing and flake plants. He said that he and Davidson had talked to OPI's president about the sale as individuals and not as representatives of Sabre. Muir, a director, also said that he had met with the OPI president concerning the same matter. Jordan explained that, if the circumstances were to develop favorably, the matter would be presented to the board for consideration. On October 12, 1978, Jordan and Reid disclosed to the board that they had entered into a memorandum of intent to purchase OPI. The full terms of the agreement were not disclosed at that time, because Jordan and Reed said they had agreed with the president of OPI to keep them confidential. Jordan did explain that they did not intend to grow potatoes on OPI land in 1979 and instead planned to develop an industrial facility to lease to a new french fry processor. Those plans were presented as representing a benefit to Sabre, because they would reduce competition and provide a new market for potatoes.\n\nThe board specifically discussed whether the acquisition was a corporate opportunity for Sabre and whether Jordan and Reid had a conflict of interest between their OPI plans and their duties to Sabre. After a discussion, the disinterested directors voted unanimously that Sabre was not interested in investing in OPI, that the acquisition was not a corporate opportunity, that Jordan and Reid could continue with the acquisition on their own behalves and that the board believed that the officers' involvement in OPI would not prejudice Sabre's operations. (The purchase would remove 8,000 irrigated acres from the real estate market at a time when Sabre was negotiating the sale of its own operations because of its very serious financial problems.) Jordan and Reid's acquisition of OPI closed on January 29, 1979.\n\nSabre's board meeting minutes for March 30, 1979, the next meeting, indicate that Jordan explained in substantial detail the investment that he and Reid had made in OPI and that the board took no further action. The board members also had available to them a written explanation of the terms and conditions of the transaction. At that meeting considerable attention was given to questioning Reid about his leasing, for himself, a potato storage shed owned by OPI and about various transactions which later led to the self-dealing claims. Reid explained in response that Sabre was committed to a lease of another storage shed, so he did not believe that he was interfering with a Sabre opportunity. He also discussed some of the transactions between others of his outside ventures and Sabre and explained that he thought they were fair to both parties. The board was sufficiently concerned at the time to order further investigation of the transactions. A report by Sabre auditors detailed every transaction and concluded that they had resulted in no financial harm to the corporation. The report was presented to the board in June, 1979, and the Board took no further action.\n\nPlaintiff contends that the trial court, having determined that plaintiff's claims are primarily equitable, erred in ruling that the claims of usurpation of its corporate opportunities are barred by laches and the two-year Statute of Limitations, which is applicable by analogy \"as a yardstick.\" Albino and Albino, 279 Or. 537, 553, 568 P.2d 1344 ( ). The trial court concluded that the limitation in ORS 12.110(1) 1 applies to Sabre's usurpation claims, that Sabre had full knowledge of all material facts by March 30, 1979, at the latest, and that more than two years passed between the acquisition of that knowledge and the filing of this action. Plaintiff argues that the six-year Statute of Limitations 2 should apply, because of the supposed contractual nature of defendants' obligations. Plaintiff relies on federal cases that predate Oregon's relevant case law.\n\nIn Securities-Intermountain v. Sunset Fuel, 289 Or. 243, 258, 611 P.2d 1158 ( ), the Supreme Court noted:\n\n\"Given the need under ORS 12.080 and 12.110 to characterize an action commenced after two years as either contractual or noncontractual, Dowell v. Mossberg [226 Or. 173, 355 P.2d 624 ( ) ] and its sequels were concerned to forestall the transformation of actions based on liability independent of any specific agreement into actions for breach of contract for the sole purpose of circumventing the two-year limitation of ORS 12.110.\"\n\nThe court further explained:\n\n\"If the alleged contract merely incorporates by reference or by implication a general standard of skill and care to which the defendant would be bound independent of the contract, and the alleged breach would also be a breach of this noncontractual duty, then ORS 12.110 applies.\" 289 Or. at 259, 611 P.2d 1158.\n\nIn this case, plaintiff claims that all of the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by usurpation of alleged corporate opportunities and by self-dealing. Those duties are binding by reason of the relationships between the parties, independently of contract. Therefore, under Securities-Intermountain, the two-year limitation would apply. Moreover, the claims here do not involve a direct physical injury to personal property which could make ORS 12.080(4) applicable. U.S. Nat'l Bank v. Davies, 274 Or. 663, 665, 548 P.2d 966 ( )."
