He was previously married to Lorraine Schuh Coenen and Beulah Buelow Coenen; both of his wives preceded him in death. Harvey was employed by Thilmany Pulp and Paper for over forty years, and was a member and former president of the Quarter-Century Club there. He was also a past-president of the union local #147 and of the Kaukauna Rod and Gun Club. Harvey enjoyed spending time at Lake Poygan and in Phoenix, Arizona. He loved fishing for perch, playing sheephead, and visiting with family and friends.\n\nHarvey is survived by his four children: Nancy (Roger) Noonan of Kaukauna; Carol Noonan of Kaukauna; David (JoAnn) Coenen of Kaukauna; Donna (David) Lund of Gillett, Wyoming; two step-sons: Leroy (Margaret) Buelow of Menomonee Falls and Dick (Chick) Buelow of Phoenix, Arizona; twenty-three grandchildren; thirty-seven great-grandchildren; a sister: Loretta Jansen of Menasha; two sisters-in-law: Beverly School of Kaukauna and Ellie Demerath of Wrightstown; and a brother-in-law: Melvin Buelow of Fond du lac. Harvey was preceded in death by his wives Lorraine Schuh Coenen and Beulah Buelow Coenen, a granddaughter Paula Coenen; eight brothers: Joe (Laura) Coenen, Peter (Lillian) Coenen, Henry (Nettie) Coenen, Bill (Mary) Coenen, Walter Coenen, Ray (Lindy) Coenen, Richard Coenen, and urban (Jeanette) Coenen; four sisters: Nell (Fred) Baumgart, Anne (Peter) Pynenberg, Ceil (Al) Pierre, and Hattie (John) Pitsch; and a brother-in-law Henry Jansen.\n\nThe funeral liturgy for Harvey will be held at 4:00 PM on Friday, April 20, 2001 at ST. MARY CATHOLIC CHURCH, 119 West 7th Street in Kaukauna with Fr. Robert Udulutsch, OFM Cap. officiating. Interment will be in Kelso Cemetery. Friends may call directly at the church on Friday from 2:00 PM until the hour of services.\n\nThe family would like to extend a special thanks to those people who showed such a wonderful level of concern for Harvey. They include Greg and Kathy Noonan, Bev School, Don and Joann Coenen, and the entire staffs at St. Paul Villa and St. Paul Home. Your kindness will never be forgotten."
