H.H. DeGarmo assisted by Revs. C.J. Hendley and T.B. Dooley, Rev. Stephen W. Frisbie of Platteville, Wis. and Miss Alphine Barnes. A gay and mirthful company assembled in the parlors of our well known and esteemed fellow citizen, Dr. C.C. Barnes to witness the ceremony which united for life, and happiness let us hope, our young friend FINNIE to the choice of her heart. The occasion was one long to be remembered by those who participated in its festivities. As we entered the gate and passed up the walk toward the mansion, a delicious fragrance from lilac trees and other shrubs and flowers, made all the more fresh and sweet by the shower of the morning previous, greeted us with a hearty welcome. Beneath the hospitable roof we found acquaintances and friends whose merry peals of laughter and self satisfied manner proclaimed that the way was open for a pleasant time. Entering the parlors a beautiful arch adorned with evergreens and flowers, extending from floor to ceiling, was the first object which met the vision, while back of it on the wall was the inscription in Latin, \"In Nomine Patris, et Filii et Spiritus Sancii. Amen.\" and over the entrance from the front hall was the quotation, \"Glory be to God on high.\" From the ceiling connecting with the arch and around the wall graceful festoons of evergreen hung. Windows and doors were adorned with living green, fresh from the woods. The large and handsome rooms seemed like a bower of hemlock and cedar. It is most fitting on such occasions to be surrounded by evergreens and flowers, emblems of the eternity of love. The ceremony was performed according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. The bride and bridesmaids were arrayed in white; if our lady readers wish a more explicitly account, they must see someone who knows more about the \"latest style\" than the writer hereof, suffice it to say, they made a charming appearance. The friends of the bride manifested their appreciation of her goodness of heart by an imposing array of bridal gifts. They were worthily bestowed. We have said nothing of the table loaded down with its choice delicacies, which was greatly admired. The table is not the least interesting part of an entertainment; in fact it is where very much of the wit and fun of an evening is produced. This supper was all that could be desired. Music followed and an hour or so was most agreeably spent in this manner when the guests took their carriages for home, wishing the happy couple whom they had just seen taking the first step on the highway of active life, all the success and happiness their hearts could desire.
