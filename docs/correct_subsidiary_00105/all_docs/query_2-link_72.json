        "text": "OMG specifications are developed and maintained by our members: vendors, users and subject-matter experts with a vested interest in the specification. Membership is open to all organizations, whether small, large, public, private, from government or academia.\n\nThe OMG technology adoption process is well-documented, mature, open and fair. OMG has deep archives and documentation of the process as well as each step that was taken within the process. Anyone who wants to participate can join. Our process has been used more than 1,000 times to develop standards; many accepted through the ISO fast-track process. The OMG technology adoption process enforces equality to ensure that timelines and requirements can not favor or handicap any specific companies.\n\nContents"
