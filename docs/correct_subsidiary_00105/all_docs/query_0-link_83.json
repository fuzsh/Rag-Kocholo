This thesis examines popular architectures of component software which can be scaled to handle large scale distributed systems. These architectures include OLE by Microsoft, CORBA by the Object Management Group, and Java Beans by Sun. Many issues need to be examined, such as what platforms will the system run on and the size of the network the system will run on. The decision of what architecture is suitable for a given complex system is crucial. This thesis provides a comparative analysis to provide a rational basis for selection."
