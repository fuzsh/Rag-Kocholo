BUSINESS\n\nOverview\n\nWe are a leading global provider of software development and deployment solutions that are designed to accelerate the application development lifecycle. We provide our customers solutions that help them deliver better software faster and manage software development projects from beginning to end. By connecting managers, testers, designers and developers, our solutions are designed to improve software quality, accelerate the delivery of software, lower the cost of ownership and reduce risk. We have an installed base of over three million global users that includes leading high technology, telecommunications, government contracting and financial services enterprises.\n\nBusinesses use technology to maximize their productivity, and thereby increase the enterprises profitability. Enterprises are increasingly demanding more speed, more reliability and a higher return on investment from the software that facilitates their businesses. In this environment of heightened expectations, existing point solutions that help developers only with a particular aspect of the application development lifecycle or solutions that rely exclusively on one technology platform are proving inadequate for the complex needs of development teams. We believe enterprises are turning to integrated development solutions that help development teams deliver high quality software quickly.\n\nWe believe that our customers turn to us because our products and services offer the following benefits:\n\n Greater Development Team Productivity. Our integrated suite of solutions helps our customers in each of the major phases of the application development lifecycle, and consequently maximize developer productivity by simplifying the process of defining, designing, developing, testing and deploying software applications and by providing teams with valuable software configuration management capabilities. As a result, our customers can create and deploy higher-quality applications faster.\n\n Quality Enhancement. Our products are designed to enhance the quality of the applications our customers produce. Various products in our suite help developers audit the quality of the code that they produce, enhance the performance and efficiency of their code, re-use existing code for new applications, and assure higher-quality code by testing it for defects and against required parameters.\n\n Increased Manageability. We offer our customers one resource to resolve most of their critical software development challenges, from requirements management to code modeling to code programming to testing. We believe this integrated approach to the needs of software development teams provides our customers with greater ability to manage their software development project by providing resources for collaboration among team members, offering managers visibility into the progress of a development project and helping the development teams deliver better, more predictable code.\n\n Freedom of Choice. Our suite of products is designed to support all major platforms. Unlike software solutions from major system vendors that force customers to purchase all of their technology infrastructure on a particular platform, our products are designed to provide interoperability between competing platforms. This allows our customers to achieve a fully integrated solution for software implementation while retaining the flexibility to choose the best vendors and technologies for new applications.\n\n2\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOur goal is to become the leading provider of technology solutions for the rapid and effective creation and implementation of software applications. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal include:\n\n delivering our comprehensive application lifecycle management solutions to large enterprises;\n\n delivering products for the development of cross-platform applications, and thereby providing our customers with greater freedom to choose the best solutions available regardless of platform and to utilize legacy investments to address new technological challenges;\n\n maintaining our leadership in Java development solutions;\n\n developing leading solutions for the .NET Framework;\n\n capitalizing on the strength of the Borland brand and our worldwide distribution network to sell our new solutions to a broader base of potential customers; and\n\n focusing on the needs of our customers.\n\nIndustry Background\n\nBusinesses use technology to maximize productivity, and thereby increase profitability. As a result, operational success can depend on the strength of a businesss information technology assets, particularly its software. In such an environment, the ability to develop and deploy software efficiently and effectively becomes increasingly important. To assist in the development process, developers initially turned to multiple, non-integrated development tools that helped with discrete aspects of the definition, design, development, testing, change management and deployment of software. Software application development is growing increasingly complex due to shifting standards and increasing requirements, and businesses are more frequently operating in heterogeneous computing environments. As a result, businesses are demanding development software that simplifies the application development lifecycle, reduces the time-to-market of deploying applications, facilitates deployment across multiple platforms and causes minimal disruption to the enterprise.\n\nIn addition, enterprises are focused on maximizing their investment in existing information technology. To do so, developers must integrate and enhance the scalability, reliability and manageability of existing information technology and utilize it when introducing new technology platforms. However, this process is among the most complex and costly parts of the software deployment. As a result, development teams are seeking application development software that re-purposes existing software code for deployment to new platforms and uses existing software and hardware in the deployment. Technology facilitating interoperability between new platforms and functioning legacy systems helps enterprises overcome this challenge.\n\nIn this environment, we believe enterprises value application development solutions that:\n\n accelerate application development and deployment by providing an integrated suite of technologies addressing every phase of the application development process;\n\n are platform-neutral, facilitate interoperability and allow for maximum flexibility and freedom of choice in an increasingly cross-platform world;\n\n lower the cost of ownership and enhance the return on investment from existing technology infrastructure by integrating it with new software applications; and\n\n provide the simplicity and developer control needed to maximize developer productivity through a comprehensive, integrated solution.\n\n3\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOur Integrated Suite of Products\n\nOur integrated suite of products is designed to assist in the rapid and effective development and deployment of software applications critical to our customers businesses. Our integrated development solutions are designed to address the various dimensions of an applications lifecycledefinition, design, development, testing and deploymentand to provide valuable software configuration management capabilities. We believe our integrated suite enhances development team productivity, ensures higher-quality code and reduces the total cost of ownership.\n\nDefinition Products. CaliberRM is our web-based requirements management system that manages the evolution of software requirements as well as the relationship between requirements and documentation, tests, models and code. Once the requirements are captured in CaliberRM, the development, documentation, test creation and project management processes can begin in parallel. With CaliberRM, requirements volatility is made evident, teams can avoid working from stale requirements, developers avoid costly and time-consuming rework, and as a result, developers can build the desired features to meet business needs.\n\nDesign Products. Our Together family of products provides modeling capabilities to help create and communicate better software architecture throughout the application development lifecycle. The Together family of products includes live synchronization between the UML model and the application code to ensure that changes made to the application code are immediately reflected in visual model designs. This enables developers to collaborate across modeling and code development disciplines, and consequently enables improved developer productivity, reduced development time and higher quality applications. Supporting most leading Java 2 Enterprise Edition, or J2EE, platform environments, including IBM WebSphere, BEA WebLogic, Sun, Apple and Jboss, Together products also perform integrated model-to-code audits that assist developers in building maintainable and higher-quality code.\n\nDevelopment Products. For the development phase, we offer integrated development environments, or IDEs, for the following platforms: Java, Windows/.NET, Linux and C++. Our IDEs are designed to provide easy-to-use aides, templates and utilities for developers to rapidly build and troubleshoot complex software applications.\n\nJava Solutions. JBuilder is a leading cross-platform environment for building industrial-strength Java applications. JBuilder is designed to speed the development of Java applications, deliver web applications faster, increase code reliability and develop applications for deployment on Windows, Linux, Solaris or Mac OS X platforms.\n\nWindows/.NET Solutions. We provide a number of IDEs designed to support the rapid delivery of high quality Windows applications as well as applications designed for the .NET Framework. Delphi is\n\n4\n\nTable of Contents\n\ndesigned to allow developers to deliver high quality Windows applications quickly and to port those applications to the .NET Framework. C++Builder is our C++ language development environment that is designed to provide American National Standards Institute, or ANSI, standard development of high-quality Windows applications. C#Builder is our IDE focused on the needs of developers designing software for the emerging .NET Framework.\n\nLinux Solutions. Kylix is our Linux IDE that is equipped with C++ and Delphi languages to assist developers in building rapid application development solutions and to port those applications cross-platform to Linux.\n\nTesting Products. Our Optimizeit family of performance management solutions is designed to improve the quality of the code developed by providing profiling and memory debugging to help eliminate performance bottlenecks, thread debugging to detect code deadlocks, and code coverage to locate untested code and identify dead code. Our Optimizeit family of solutions includes Optimizeit Suite, which is designed to identify performance and testing problems in Java applications; Optimizeit Enterprise Suite, which is designed to isolate performance hazards during the development of J2EE applications; Optimizeit ServerTrace, our pre-deployment phase testing solution designed to help customers identify performance hazards before they deploy J2EE applications; and Optimizeit Profiler for .NET, which is designed to provide performance management capabilities such as CPU and memory usage analysis for .NET managed code.\n\nSoftware Configuration Management, or SCM, Products. To manage the particular tasks of the application development lifecycle, we offer our customers StarTeam, a leading SCM and change management solution that puts control of the development process in the hands of project teams. By providing users with access to all project assets through a central repository, StarTeam allows teams to manage development projects by providing them with a single repository for managing requirements, resources and changes, tracking defects and threaded discussions, and managing the tasks required for effective project management. With its web-based architecture, data encryption and compression capabilities, we believe StarTeam is a particularly well suited for managing increasingly dispersed development teams.\n\nDeployment Products. We provide our customers with solutions that help them deploy and manage their e-business applications by providing them with embedded databases and allowing personal digital assistants, or PDAs, and other devices that incorporate embedded computers to be integrated with enterprise applications. Our deployment solutions include VisiBroker, our common object request broker architecture (CORBA) solution for distributed object computing; Borland Enterprise Server/AppServer Edition, our J2EE 1.3 compliant application server; VisiBrokerRT, our CORBA solution for embedded devices; Janeva, which provides customers with secure, high performance interoperability between .NET and CORBA/J2EE technologies; and Deployment OpCenter, a deployment solution designed to provide the bridge between development and deployment in the complex, distributed production environment.\n\nProfessional Services\n\nIn addition to our award winning products, we offer consulting, training and certification services, as well as comprehensive technical support capabilities. Services provided by our Professional Services Organization include:\n\nConsulting services. We offer a variety of both packaged and custom consulting services that include architectural assessment, prototyping, legacy migration, application integration, performance evaluation, application deployment and data conversions. In addition, we work with third-party consulting firms and systems integrators that provide reengineering, technology assessments, customization, project management and implementation services.\n\n5\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTraining services. We offer education and training services to assist customers in learning about current technology trends and our products. These programs range from introductory sessions to highly advanced seminars.\n\nSupport services. We provide a range of support services covering application development, deployment and integration issues. We offer such services on site or remotely from our support centers in the U.S., Singapore and the Netherlands. Customers can choose the level of supportfrom personalized support for large corporations to minimum assistance levels for small businesses.\n\nCertification services. Our certification program permits individuals and companies to become Borland Product Certified or a Certified Borland Instructor. The product certification exam tests for knowledge of a Borland products features and associated technologies and its use in developing software applications.\n\nCustomers\n\nOur customers range from leading Fortune 1000 and Global 2000 companies to individual developers. We are increasingly targeting enterprise customers and count as our customers leading financial services, high technology, government contractors and telecommunications enterprises. No customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2003. Ingram Micro, a reseller, accounted for approximately 12% and 13% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We have a number of separate agreements with various regional Ingram Micro distributors to act as a distributor of our products to resellers. Each agreement is non-exclusive. The agreements generally renew on an annual basis unless prior notice is given.\n\nAs we generally ship products upon receipt of orders, our backlog is not significant.\n\nSales and Marketing\n\nOur sales strategy combines a direct sales organization with an established indirect sales channel. We have recently reorganized our sales and marketing organizations. Sales resources have been allocated to one of three sectors according to opportunity:\n\n management of major accounts by named sales representatives;\n\n management of smaller accounts by sales personnel on the basis of geography; and\n\n leveraging of our traditional strength in the indirect channel by marketing and distributing products worldwide through a network of independent distributors, dealers, value-added resellers, or VARs, specialty catalogue vendors and independent software vendors, or ISVs.\n\nWe also market our products through our own e-commerce Internet site. This balanced effort allows us to target both large enterprises with our comprehensive solutions and small-to-medium size businesses and individuals with our discrete products.\n\nWe permit our distributors to balance their inventories by periodically returning unsold Borland products in exchange for other Borland products. Accordingly, we maintain allowances for product returns to cover their entire reported inventory.\n\nWe conduct operations and sell a substantial portion of our products outside the U.S. In support of those efforts, we maintain overseas offices in a number of foreign countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, France, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. International sales accounted for 56%, 62% and 61% of our total revenues in the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Additionally, we market and sell our products in international territories not covered by any of our foreign offices through independent distributors and sales agents, VARs and ISVs.\n\n6\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOur activities in support of our direct and indirect sales efforts, both domestically and internationally, and our ongoing efforts to improve the visibility of our brand include, among other things:\n\n creation of sales brochures and other marketing materials;\n\n extensive sales training;\n\n user conferences, including our own series of Borland conferences, or BorCons;\n\n appearances at industry trade shows;\n\n technical seminars;\n\n cooperative marketing programs;\n\n advertising in trade and technical publications;\n\n industry analyst briefings;\n\n trade and industry association activities;\n\n sales promotions; and\n\n targeted mailings and emails to current and potential customers.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nOur competitive position has developed to a large extent because of our emphasis on research and development, and we believe that our success will continue to depend heavily on our ability to develop new products and upgrades to meet the requirements of our customers and the market. Current research and development efforts are directed at enhancing our current technology and products and on developing new products. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were $64.3 million, $50.8 million and $46.1 million, respectively, representing 22%, 21% and 21% of our net total revenues in those years.\n\nIn addition to domestic research and development facilities in Cupertino, California; Scotts Valley, California; Santa Ana, California; Atlanta, Georgia; and Raleigh, North Carolina, we also maintain research and development facilities internationally in St. Petersburg, Russia; Prague, Czech Republic; and Singapore.\n\n7\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCompetition\n\nThe market for application development technologies is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid change due to new and emerging technologies. We face intense competition in the development and marketing of our software products and services. Following is a brief summary of our major products and their main competitors:\n\nProduct\n\nCompetitive Products\n\nCaliberRM\n\nIBMs Rational Requisite Pro and Telelogics DOORS\n\nTogether ControlCenter\n\nIBMs Rational Rose and Rational XDE, and Embarcaderos Describe\n\nJBuilder\n\nEclipse, IBMs WebSphere Studio Application Developer, BEA Systems Workshop, Oracles JDeveloper, JetBrains IntelliJ and Sun Microsystems Sun One Studio\n\nDelphi/C++Builder/C#Builder\n\nMicrosofts Visual Studio and Visual Basic\n\nOptimizeit\n\nIBMs Rational Purify Plus and Quests JProbe\n\nOptimizeit ServerTrace\n\nQuests PerformaSure and Mercury Interactives Optane\n\nStarTeam\n\nTelelogics CM Synergy, Merants PVCS, IBMs Rational ClearCase and ClearQuest and MKS Source Integrity\n\nEnterprise Server, VisiBroker Edition\n\nIonas Orbix\n\nEnterprise Server, AppServer Edition\n\nBEA Systems WebLogic, IBMs WebSphere, Oracle 10g and Sun Microsystems ONE\n\nEnterprise Server, Web Edition\n\nMicrosofts Content Management Server and providers of the Apache Web Server\n\nJaneva\n\nIntrinsic Janet\n\nSome of our competitors, particularly those that are primarily hardware vendors or platform providers, generate a substantially greater proportion of their sales in markets in which we do not directly compete. We believe a number of these competitors view sales of software development technologies as important for enhancing the functionality of, and demand for, their core products. As a result, some companies may bundle software development products that compete with our offerings with their other products, such as application servers, work stations, personal computers, operating systems and databases. When competitors do so, the effective price for software development products that compete with our products may be heavily discounted, nominal or free.\n\nHowever, we believe that our product quality, performance, price, Borland brand, vendor and product reputation, and product architecture make us competitive. In particular, we believe that our platform-independent positioning and interoperability capabilities, including our ability to integrate with many existing technologies and systems (including, in many cases, those of our competitors), give us an important source of competitive strength.\n\nManufacturing\n\nOur product development groups produce a set of master CD-ROMs or diskettes and documentation for each of our products which are then sent to manufacturing. All of our manufacturing and order fulfillment is performed by outside contractors, under the supervision of our domestic logistics organization, and includes replication of CD-ROMs or diskettes, printing and production of documentation and packaging materials and\n\n8\n\nTable of Contents\n\nassembly of final product packages for shipment to customers. Our products are principally sold in CD-ROM format together with user documentation. We believe that there are adequate supplies and sources for the raw materials used in our products and that there are multiple sources available for CD-ROM replication, printing and production of packaging materials and printing of documentation. We also deliver some of our products directly to our customers via electronic download from the Internet.\n\nWe have final quality control tests performed internally on our products that we believe effectively accomplish our product quality assurance goals.\n\nIntellectual Property\n\nOur success depends upon our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws and non-disclosure and other contractual agreements to protect our intellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, it may be possible for an unauthorized third party to copy certain portions of our products or to reverse-engineer or obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of many foreign countries do not protect rights in intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized third-party copying or use which could adversely affect our competitive position.\n\nFrom time to time we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of third-party patent, trademark and other intellectual property rights. Regardless of the merit of any such claim, responding to these claims could be time consuming and expensive, and may require us to enter into licensing or royalty agreements which may not be offered or available on terms acceptable to us. If a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology, our business could be materially and adversely affected. We expect that our software products will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products in our industry increase, the functionality of products overlap and industry participants become more aggressive in using patents offensively.\n\nOur product development depends, in part, on licenses received from third parties. Our Java products require proprietary technology made available by Sun Microsystems, Inc. We license the J2SE, J2EE and J2ME specifications from Sun Microsystems under a license agreement that provides for a five-year term and that expires on December 28, 2005. Our Together Java products require proprietary technology made available to us under a separate J2EE commercial use license agreement, which provides for a three-year term expiring on May 21, 2004. In addition, our C++Builder and C#Builder products require proprietary technology made available by Microsoft Corporation, and we license the Open Tools software, Windows Platform SDK, and related technology from Microsoft Corporation under one or more license agreements, one of which expires on May 2, 2004. While we would expect to renew these agreements, neither Sun nor Microsoft is obligated to do so. Upon expiration of these licenses, we will continue to have the right to distribute our software products containing the version of Java technology incorporated at the time of expiration (in the case of the Sun agreements), and to distribute those versions of our software products containing the Microsoft technology that we distributed prior to expiration (in the case of the Microsoft agreement). However, in the event of termination of the Sun license due to material breach of the terms of the license or upon an action for infringement of intellectual property rights relating to the Java technology by us against Sun Microsystems or any of its other licensees, we are required to return or destroy all copies of the Java technology, including derivative works. Similarly, in the event of termination of the Microsoft license due to a material breach of its terms (or termination in the event that our insolvency or bankruptcy becomes likely), we are required to return or destroy all full or partial copies of the Microsoft technology in our possession or under our control. If either Sun Microsystems or Microsoft Corporation stops making this proprietary technology available to us on commercially reasonable terms, and we are unable to develop or otherwise identify effective alternatives to licensing this technology, our business could be substantially harmed.\n\n9\n\nTable of Contents\n\nEmployees\n\nAs of February 29, 2004, we employed approximately 1,358 employees, of which 485 are engaged in research and development. From time to time, we have also engaged temporary contract employees both in foreign countries and within the United States. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union, and we have experienced no work stoppages.

These facilities comprise approximately 150,000 square feet of space and were constructed in 1988. We lease office space in other cities in the United States as well as in Europe, Canada, Latin America and various countries in Asia Pacific. Our existing facilities are adequate to meet our current and projected needs. We presently have excess facilities under lease, and we are actively negotiating the termination of some of our lease commitments.\n\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nOn November 27, 2002, a stockholder class action and derivative lawsuit, Dieterich v. Harrer, et al., Case No. 02CC00350, was filed against Starbase Corporation, or Starbase, and five former directors of Starbase in the Superior Court of the State of California for Orange County, claiming that the former directors had breached fiduciary duties owed to Starbase and stockholders of Starbase. We are paying the costs of defending this litigation pursuant to indemnification obligations under the merger agreement relating to our acquisition of Starbase. Following a series of motions, the case was dismissed without prejudice on August 20, 2003. On October 28, 2003, a stockholder class action relating to the same matter, Dieterich v. Harrer, et al, Case No. 024-N, was filed against the former directors of Starbase in Chancery Court of the State of Delaware, alleging breach of fiduciary duties by the former directors of Starbase, Borland, Dale L. Fuller, Keith E. Gottfried, Frederick A. Ball, and Doug Barre. We have submitted a motion for summary judgment in the State of Delaware, and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously. There is no indication at present whether the lawsuit will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in other lawsuits, claims, investigations, proceedings, and threats of litigation consisting of intellectual property, commercial, employment and other matters. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, we make a provision for a liability when it is both probable\n\n12\n\nTable of Contents\n\nthat a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us, as well as adequate provisions for any probable and estimable losses. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations for that period. We believe that, given our current liquidity and cash and investment balances, even were we to receive an adverse judgment with respect to litigation that we are currently a party to, it is likely that such a judgment would not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\n\nITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS\n\nNo matters were submitted to a vote of our stockholders, through a solicitation of proxies or otherwise, during the quarter ended December 31, 2003.\n\n13\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPART II\n\nITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS\n\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol BORL. According to the records of our transfer agent and registrar, Mellon Investor Services, L.L.C., we had approximately 2445 stockholders of record of our common stock as of February 29, 2003. Because many of such shares are held by brokers, institutions and other nominees on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial owners represented by these record holders. We have not paid dividends since 1988. We intend to retain future earnings for use in our business, and therefore, do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe following table sets forth the high and low sales price per share of our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market for the calendar quarters presented below:\n\nHigh\n\nLow\n\nFiscal Year Ended December 31, 2002\n\nFirst Quarter ended March 31, 2002\n\n$ 18.40 $ 11.29\n\nSecond Quarter ended June 30, 2002\n\n$ 13.04 $ 8.78\n\nThird Quarter ended September 30, 2002\n\n$ 11.50 $ 6.48\n\nFourth Quarter ended December 31, 2002\n\n$ 14.85 $ 7.55\n\nFiscal Year Ended December 31, 2003\n\nFirst Quarter ended March 31, 2003\n\n$ 14.47 $ 8.80\n\nSecond Quarter ended June 30, 2003\n\n$ 12.05 $ 8.01\n\nThird Quarter ended September 30, 2003\n\n$ 11.17 $ 8.56\n\nFourth Quarter ended December 31, 2003\n\n$ 9.93 $ 8.19\n\nAs of March 11, 2004, the most recent practicable date prior to the filing of this Form 10-K, the closing sale price of a share of our common stock was $8.95.\n\nOn January 7, 2003, we reserved 395,149 shares of our common stock for issuance upon exercise of stock options as partial consideration for Starbase Corporation.\n\nOn January 24, 2003, we issued 7,817,043 shares of our common stock, and reserved an additional 1,181,585 shares for issuance upon exercise of options, as partial consideration for our acquisition of TogetherSoft Corporation, or TogetherSoft. On January 7, 2003, the Commissioner of Corporations of the State of California held a public hearing regarding the acquisition of TogetherSoft and issued a permit, pursuant to which the issuance of Borland securities to TogetherSoft security holders is exempt from registration with the SEC under Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion includes a number of forward-looking statements and, with respect to this section, the cautionary language applicable to such forward-looking statements described above in A Caution About Forward-Looking Statements found before Item 1 of this Form 10-K is incorporated by reference into this Item 7. Basically, forward-looking statements are managements best estimates and actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nOverview\n\nWe are a leading provider of software development and deployment solutions designed to improve software quality, accelerate the delivery of software, lower the cost of ownership and reduce the risk of errors by helping customers manage software development projects from beginning to end.\n\nWe believe a full understanding of our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2003 requires an understanding both of the elements that drove our company performance and of the macro-economic conditions that affect our business. First, total revenues increased primarily as a result of two substantial acquisitions in January 2003. Second, the market for software development tools that has been our historical revenue base continues to mature, particularly Java development tools. This maturation has put pressure on the pricing of products that constitute much of our historical revenue base, and as a consequence, pressure on our financial results for 2003. Finally, as a result of poor sales execution in 2003, we failed to generate the revenues necessary to support the cost structure in place at the time. As a result, we carried excess costs throughout 2003, which harmed our financial performance throughout the year. In addition to these company-specific factors, we believe our operating results were further affected by the continuing weakness in the software development and deployment solutions market in which we operate, with our potential customers showing a general cautiousness in capital spending on software.\n\nIn response to these conditions, particularly the maturation of our traditional market, we have recently begun transforming the company from one focused on selling individual development tools to one focused on selling multi-product enterprise solutions that span the application development lifecycle. As part of this transformation, in 2003 we acquired two companies that provide us with the requirements management, modeling and software configuration management capabilities needed to fill out our suite of application development solutions. We realigned our management and sales organization to support the strategic direction of the company. We restructured many of our operations and conducted reductions in force in an effort to improve organizational efficiencies, control our expense structure, increase sales productivity and drive to a more profitable long-term financial model. Finally, we are in the process of upgrading our marketing and selling efforts to address enterprise opportunities. We expect to continue all of these activities over the next several quarters, and doing so may put pressure on our financial results and operations as we go through this transformation.\n\nIn 2004, we will continue to focus on increasing sales force productivity by generating more sales of our multi-product solutions to enterprise customers. As we do so, we expect to compete more directly with larger companies and expect to experience longer sales cycles (which is typical for sales of larger solutions). In addition, in 2004, we will seek to contain departmental spending to levels more consistent with those of other software companies.\n\nWe achieved the following financial results during the year ended December 31, 2003:\n\n For the year ended December 31, 2003, our consolidated net revenues grew 21% to $295.2 million, from $244.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, $74.1 million of which were generated by products acquired from Starbase and TogetherSoft and services related to those products.\n\n18\n\nTable of Contents\n\n Licenses and other revenues increased 7% to $219.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $204.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.\n\n Service revenues increased 90% to $76.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $40.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.\n\n Gross margins decreased to 81% for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 85% for the year ended December 31, 2002.\n\n Operating expenses increased 47% to $277.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $188.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, of which $4.5 million and $0.6 million relate to the amortization of other intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.\n\n We had a net loss of $40.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to net income of $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.\n\n Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased $93.5 million to $202.6 million as of December 31, 2003 from $296.2 million as of December 31, 2002. The decrease is primarily attributable to cash expended in connection with the acquisitions of Starbase and TogetherSoft.\n\n We repurchased 1,983,505 shares of our stock under our stock repurchase programs for a total cost of $18.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2003. This brings the total purchased under our stock repurchase programs to 3,180,705 shares for a cost of $29.1 million.\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and the application of GAAP requires us to make estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In many instances, we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates, and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by us. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations will be affected.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns, fair value of investments, fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, restructuring obligations, and contingencies and litigation, among others. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies, which are discussed further below.\n\nIn addition to these estimates and assumptions that are utilized in the preparation of historical financial statements, the inability to properly estimate the timing and amount of future revenues could significantly affect our future operations. We must make assumptions and estimates as to the timing and amount of future revenue. Specifically, our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals, including the estimated closing date and potential dollar amount of such transaction. We aggregate these estimates periodically to generate a sales pipeline and then evaluate the pipeline to identify trends in our business. This pipeline analysis and related estimates of revenue may differ significantly from actual revenues in a particular reporting period as the estimates and assumptions were made using the best available data at the time, which is subject to change. Specifically, the slowdown in the global economy and information technology spending has caused and may continue to cause\n\n19\n\nTable of Contents\n\ncustomer purchasing decisions to be delayed, reduced in amount or canceled, all of which have reduced and could continue to reduce the rate of conversion of the pipeline into contracts. A variation in the pipeline or in the conversion rate of the pipeline into contracts could cause us to plan or budget inaccurately and thereby could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, because a substantial portion of our software license contracts close in the latter part of a quarter, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to respond to a variation in the conversion of the pipeline in a timely manner, and thereby the delays may adversely and materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nWe believe the following are critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nWe derive revenues from licenses of our software and sales of related services, which include assistance in implementation and integration, post-contract customer support, training and consulting.\n\nWe recognize license fees on contracts that do not involve significant implementation or integration essential to the functionality of our products upon delivery when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is probable. For arrangements with multiple elements, we determine the value for services and post-contract customer support based upon vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position, or SOP, No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, or SOP 97-2, and related accounting literature. VSOE for the services element is based upon the standard hourly rates we charge for services, given the complexity of the services and experience of the professional performing the services, or the amount charged on similar transactions. VSOE for annual post-contract customer support is established with the stated future renewal rates included in the contracts or the amount charged on a similar transaction. We recognize revenues for the license portion of a multiple element arrangement based upon the residual contract value as prescribed by SOP No. 98-9, Modification of SOP No. 97-2 with Respect to Certain Transactions. We assess collection based on a number of factors, including past transaction history with the customer and the credit-worthiness of the customer. We do not generally request collateral from our customers. If we determine that collection of a fee is not probable or there are extended payment terms, we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable, which is generally upon receipt of cash. We recognize revenue for software licensed for a specific time period, or term license, ratably over the term of the license.\n\nIncreasingly, we are selling more comprehensive enterprise software solutions. These solutions often involve significant implementation or integration essential to the functionality of our products. We recognize license and service revenues associated with contracts involving significant implementation or integration, either on a percentage-of-completion basis or a completed-contract basis depending on whether or not we can obtain reliable estimates of the costs to complete the work. We classify revenues from these arrangements as license and/or service revenues, based upon the estimated fair value of each element based upon VSOE. Provisions for estimated contract losses are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with SOP No. 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts.\n\nWe recognize revenues upon shipment to our distributors. Due to the level of historic returns and willingness to accept returns from our major distributors, we maintain allowances for product returns from our distributors to cover their unsold reported inventory. Additionally, we maintain allowances for product returns from our channel resellers and end users based upon historical return rates, current economic trends, changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products. We make complex accounting decisions in our percentage-of-completion accounting, involving judgements and estimates as to future costs and recoverability of unbilled amounts. Significant management judgment and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing our sales returns and other allowances with our channel resellers. The provision for sales returns and rebates amounted to $6.3 million in 2003, as compared to $12.4 million in 2002 and $14.1 million in 2001, reflecting a greater emphasis on direct sales to end users in 2003. We offer return rights to end users only in limited circumstances. If future returns increase over historical levels, additional allowances may be required.\n\n20\n\nTable of Contents\n\nOther service revenues from consulting and training services are recognized as such services are performed. Service revenues from post-contract customer support are recognized ratably over the support period, generally one year.\n\nAccounting for Acquisitions\n\nOn January 14, 2003, we completed the acquisition of privately-held TogetherSoft for approximately $82.5 million in cash, 9,050,000 shares of Borland common stock and the assumption of TogetherSofts stock option plans. Approximately $22.8 million of the total consideration is being held in escrow to indemnify us against and reimburse us for certain events and cover certain liabilities and transaction costs. Unused funds will be released from escrow at certain times between 2004 and 2007.\n\nPursuant to a merger agreement, by and between Borland, Starbase and Galaxy Acquisition Corp., on October 11, 2002, we commenced an all-cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Starbase for aggregate consideration of approximately $24.0 million and $2.0 million in bridge financing that was forgiven upon the consummation of the transaction. In the initial tender offer, which expired on November 22, 2002, we purchased approximately 78.9% of the outstanding Starbase shares for approximately $19.0 million. Upon the completion of the initial tender, we began consolidating the operating results of Starbase. On January 7, 2003 we purchased the remaining shares outstanding for approximately $5.0 million.\n\nDuring 2002, we also completed the acquisitions of Boldsoft, VMGear and Highlander. We accounted for these acquisitions as purchases in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. As such, we have reported all the acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities of the acquired companies at fair value. Our determination of the values of our acquired intangibles was based on the discounted cash flow method. We recognize the fair value of the purchased identifiable intangibles as an operating expense over the estimated useful life of the identifiable intangible, unless the identifiable intangible is determined to have an indefinite life. We recognize the fair value associated with in-process technology as an operating expense during the period the transaction is consummated. We value employee stock options assumed as part of the acquisition using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The value of all vested awards and the value of unvested awards in excess of the intrinsic value of the unvested awards are included as part of the purchase consideration. We report the intrinsic value of the unvested awards as deferred compensation and record it as an operating expense over the remaining vesting period of the award. We value our stock issued as part of the purchase consideration based upon the average of the closing price for the five-day trading period surrounding the transaction. We report total consideration in excess of the fair value of the acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets, net of assumed liabilities, as goodwill.\n\nIn accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangibles, or SFAS 142, we evaluate the goodwill for impairment on an annual basis. Impairment of goodwill is performed in two steps. First, the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to the fair value of the reporting unit including the goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is greater than the fair value of the reporting unit, then we move to the second step of the impairment test. The second step of the impairment test, used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, the impairment loss shall be recognized as an operating expense in an amount equal to that excess. We performed our evaluation of the goodwill during the quarter ended September 30, 2003 and determined that we had a single reporting unit and that there was no impairment. The market capitalization method was the primary method used to determine the fair values for SFAS 142 impairment purposes. The assumptions supporting the cash flows, including the premium for control, which was assumed to be 25-30%, were determined using our best estimates as of the impairment review. We did not record a loss on impairment of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for further discussion of the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets.\n\n21\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe may incur substantial liabilities connected to the termination of employees, asserted claims or litigation, impairment of assets or termination of leases in connection with our acquisitions that are accounted for as purchases. We have incurred such liabilities with the acquisition of Starbase in the year ended December 31, 2002 and TogetherSoft in the year ending December 31, 2003. We estimate merger-related costs at the time of the acquisition and accrue these costs, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue No. 95-3, Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination, or EITF 95-3, with an offsetting entry to goodwill. These accruals involve estimates regarding future events, sometimes several years in the future. We may make revisions and adjustments to the accrual and the related goodwill based on actual events.\n\nRestructuring\n\nWe report costs associated with employee terminations and other exit activity in accordance with SFAS No. 112, Employers Accounting for Postemployment Benefits, an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 5 and 43, and SFAS No. 146 Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, or SFAS 146. We record employee termination benefits as an operating expense when the benefit arrangement is communicated to the employee and no significant future services are required beyond a minimum 60-day retention period from the employee to earn the termination benefits. We recognize facility lease termination obligations, net of estimated sublease income, and other exit costs when we have future payment with no future economic benefit or a commitment to pay the termination costs of a prior commitment. These termination and other exit costs are reported at fair value.\n\nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts\n\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Management specifically analyzes accounts receivable, historical bad debt patterns, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Our gross accounts receivable balance was $71.8 million and $64.8 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $7.6 million and $5.6 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.\n\nStock Based Compensation\n\nWe account for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, or APB 25, and related Interpretations. Under APB 25, compensation cost is measured as the excess, if any, of the closing market price of our stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the option granted. We recognize compensation cost for stock options, if any, ratably over the vesting period. Generally, we grant options with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our stock on the grant date. We granted restricted stock to certain employees and officers during the year ended December 31, 2003. Compensation expense for restricted stock issued was not material in the year ended December 31, 2003. We provide additional pro forma disclosures as required under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, or SFAS 123.\n\n22\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPro Forma Net Income (Loss) and Net Income (Loss) Per Share\n\nHad we recorded compensation costs based on the estimated grant date fair value, as defined by SFAS 123, for awards granted under our stock option and stock purchase plans, our pro forma net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 would have been as follows (amounts in thousands, expect per share data):\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n2003\n\n2002\n\n2001\n\nNet income (loss):\n\nAs reported\n\n$ (40,544 ) $ 17,360 $ 23,106\n\nStock compensation adjustmentintrinsic value\n\n$ 124 $  $ \n\nStock compensation expense, net of tax\n\n$ (18,880 ) $ (24,843 ) $ (24,985 )\n\nPro Forma\n\n$ (59,300 ) $ (7,483 ) $ (1,879 )\n\nNet income (loss) per share:\n\nAs reported basic\n\n$ (0.51 ) $ 0.24 $ 0.34\n\nAs reported diluted\n\n$ (0.51 ) $ 0.23 $ 0.31\n\nPro Forma basic\n\n$ (0.74 ) $ (0.10 ) $ (0.03 )\n\nPro Forma diluted\n\n$ (0.74 ) $ (0.10 ) $ (0.03 )\n\nThe pro forma amounts include compensation expenses related to stock option grants and stock purchase rights for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. In future years, the annual compensation expense will increase relative to the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights granted in those future years.\n\nWe account for stock options issued to non-employees, excluding non-employee directors, under SFAS 123 and EITF No. 96-18, Accounting for Equity Instruments with Variable Terms that are Issued for Consideration Other Than Employee Services under SFAS 123, or EITF 96-18. We record the expense of such services based upon the estimated fair value of the equity instrument using the Black-Scholes pricing model. Assumptions used to value the equity instruments are consistent with equity instruments issued to employees. We charge the value of the equity instrument to earnings over the term of the service agreement.\n\nImpairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\n\nIn accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, or SFAS 144, we evaluate the accounting and reporting for the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of. SFAS 144 requires recognition of impairment of long-lived assets if the net book value of such assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets. If the carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived asset for assets to be held and used, or the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value less cost to dispose for assets to be disposed. Fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. No impairment was recorded during 2003, 2002 or 2001.\n\nIn accordance with SFAS 144, we account for property held for sale at the lower of the carrying value or the fair market value less selling costs, based on an independent appraisal. At December 31, 2002, we classified an office building we own and lease to a third party with a book value of $9.9 million as property held-for-sale, as we were actively seeking a purchaser for the property. At December 31, 2003, this asset was classified as a depreciable asset as we were unsuccessful at selling the property. When the property was put back into service, it was at its prior cost basis, reduced for depreciation expense that would have been recorded during the period the asset was removed from service, as required by SFAS 144.\n\n23\n\nTable of Contents\n\nInvestments\n\nFrom time to time we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus. We record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in the current carrying value of an investment, thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future. In 2002, we recorded a charge of $2.4 million to write-down our investment in Trolltech A.S. and $0.5 million to write-down our loan to AppForge, which was subsequently recovered and recorded as a gain on investments in the year ended December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2003, we do not hold a minority interest in any company.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes.\n\nDeferred income taxes are recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, or SFAS 109. Under SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using the tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. SFAS 109 provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not to occur. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generating sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net operating loss carryforwards. Based on the weight of the available evidence, we have provided a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred tax asset. Management will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax asset and its related valuation allowance. If our assessment of the deferred tax assets or the corresponding valuation allowance were to change, we would record the related adjustment to income during the period in which we make the determination. Our tax rate may also vary based on our results and the mix of income or loss in domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we operate.\n\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and to the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be.\n\nContingencies\n\nOur current estimated range of liability related to some of the pending litigation is based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss. We have recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims, where there is a range of loss. Because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation, management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome. As additional information becomes available, we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position. As of December 31, 2003, we have accrued approximately $6.9 million for professional service fees and other settlement costs.\n\nFrom time to time we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of third-party patent, trademark and other intellectual property rights, disputing royalties, or disputing other commercial\n\n24\n\nTable of Contents\n\narrangements. Regardless of the merit of any such claim, responding to these claims could be time consuming and expensive, and may require us to enter into licensing or royalty agreements which may not be offered or available on terms acceptable to us. If a successful claim is made against us, our business could be materially and adversely affected. We expect that our software products will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment increases, the functionality of product overlap and industry participants become more aggressive in using patents offensively.\n\nDetermining Functional Currencies for the Purpose of Consolidation\n\nWe have several foreign subsidiaries which together account for approximately 56% of our total net revenues, 24% of our assets and 30% of our total liabilities as of December 31, 2003.\n\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from their functional currencies, generally the local currency, into United States dollars. This process results in exchange gains and losses, which are included as a separate part of our net equity under the caption Cumulative Comprehensive Income (Loss).\n\nUnder the relevant accounting guidance, the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon our managements determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary. The functional currency is determined based on management judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary. Generally, the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions, including billings, financing, payroll and other expenditures is considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiarys operations is also considered.\n\nCumulative translation adjustments include any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiarys financial statements when the functional currency of any subsidiary is the local currency. However, if the functional currency is deemed to be the United States dollar then any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements would be included within our statement of operations. If we dispose of any of our subsidiaries, any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized and recorded within our statement of operations in the period during which the disposal occurs. If we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the United States dollar, any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our statement of operations.\n\nBased on our assessment of the factors discussed above, we consider the relevant subsidiarys local currency to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries. Accordingly we had cumulative translation gains of approximately $8.1 million and $4.6 million, which were included as part of cumulative comprehensive income within our balance sheet at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, translation adjustments of $3.5 million, $2.0 million and ($2.3) million, respectively, were included under cumulative comprehensive income (loss). Had we determined that the functional currency of our subsidiaries was the United States dollar, these gains and losses would have been included in our results of operations for each of the years presented.\n\nThe magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the United States dollar and the significance of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies. These currencies include the Japanese Yen, the Euro, the United Kingdom Pound Sterling, Singapore dollar, Hong Kong dollar, Chinese Yen, Korean Won, Brazilian Real, Russian Ruble, Indian Rupee, Mexican Peso and Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars. Any future translation gains or losses could be significantly higher than those noted in each of these years. In addition, if we determine that a change in the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries has occurred at any point in time or we sell or liquidate one of our subsidiaries, we would be required to include any translation gains or losses from the date of change in our statement of operations. Hedging activities are discussed under Foreign Currency Risk in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\n\n25\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nSee Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition.\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following table presents our Consolidated Statements of Operations data and its percentage of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (in thousands, except percentages):\n\n* During the year ended December 31, 2003 we reclassified from operating expense to cost of revenue the amortization of purchased technology and maintenance contracts for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001. The reclassification did not change total revenue, net income (loss), or net income (loss) per share. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nTotal Net Revenues\n\nThe following table presents our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, and dollar and percentage changes from the prior year (in thousands, except percentages).\n\nWe derive revenues from licenses of our software and the sale of related services.\n\n26\n\nTable of Contents\n\nLicenses and Other Revenues\n\nThe following table presents our licenses and other revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, and dollar and percentage changes from the prior year (in thousands, except percentages).\n\nIn 2003, we began aligning our presentation of licenses and other revenues to better reflect our Application Lifecycle Management, or ALM, strategy. Specifically, we have three major product categories: Design, Develop and Deploy. Design includes the products from our recent acquisitions of TogetherSoft and Starbase: StarTeam, CaliberRM, Together and other related design and management products. Develop includes two major categories: Java, which includes JBuilder, Java Studio and Optimizeit, and .NET, which includes Delphi, C#Builder, C++Builder, Kylix and C++ Mobile Edition. Deploy is comprised of our Borland Enterprise Server products, InterBase, Janeva and other enterprise products.\n\nCompared to our reporting for the year ended December 31, 2002, Design is a new category, Develop encompasses our former Java and RAD product lines, and Deploy encompasses the products that we previously described as the Enterprise product group. We have sought to provide comparability between historic product groups, while updating our nomenclature to reflect new platforms and our ALM strategy.\n\nLicenses and other revenues represent amounts for license fees and royalties earned for granting customers the right to use our software products. Licenses and other revenues were $219.0 million, $204.5 million and $187.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and represented 74%, 84% and 84% of net revenues for the years then ended, respectively.\n\nThe following table presents our licenses and other revenues by product category and its percentage of total licenses and other revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (in thousands, except percentages):\n\n2003\n\n2002\n\n2001\n\nDesign\n\n$ 50,489 23 % $ 3,600 2 % $  \n\nDevelop\n\n124,662 57 % 153,855 75 % 137,396 73 %\n\nDeploy\n\n43,893 20 % 47,026 23 % 49,648 27 %\n\nNet licenses and other revenues\n\n$ 219,044 100 % $ 204,481 100 % $ 187,044 100 %\n\nDesign. There were no licenses and other revenues from our Design product group for the year ended December 31, 2001. We completed the acquisitions of TogetherSoft and Starbase and began consolidating their results in January 2003 and December 2002, respectively. In the future, we expect the license revenues from the Design product group to represent a larger percentage of our total license revenues as these products will represent more significant components within our ALM solution.\n\nDevelop. Licenses and other revenues from our Java product lines represented $77.3 million, $94.1 million and $77.0 million of licenses and other revenues from our Develop product group for the years ended December 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The 18% decrease in licenses and other revenues in our Java product lines during the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared with the same period in 2002 was due to lower revenues from our JBuilder product line partially offset by growth in our Optimizeit product line. We believe the market growth in adoption of new Java development technology has slowed, and consequently our sales of JBuilder have\n\n27\n\nTable of Contents\n\nslowed. Additionally, as more of our Java customers have purchased maintenance contracts that provide them with upgrades, we believe we will generate less revenue from product upgrades. We believe that revenue growth from our JBuilder product will be dependent upon the expansion of the Java development market and the success of our ALM solutions in the Java market. The 22% increase in licenses and other revenues in our Java product lines during the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared with the same period in 2001 was primarily due to growth in the Java market and, to a lesser extent, to the introduction of Optimizeit into our product offerings.\n\nLicenses and other revenues from our .NET product lines represented $47.4 million, $59.8 million and $60.4 million of licenses and other revenues from our Develop product group for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The 21% decrease in licenses and other revenues from our .NET product lines during the year ended December 31, 2003 was primarily attributable to the lack of a major product version release earlier in the year. Delphi 8 was released in the last half of the fourth quarter of 2003, as compared to 2002, which included the releases of Delphi 7 in the third quarter of 2002 and C++Builder 6 in the first quarter of 2002. The growth in our .NET product lines will be dependent upon the rate of adoption of the .NET Framework and our ability to provide compelling development solutions that compete with, complement or enhance offerings from Microsoft. Also, we expect to benefit from offering design and deployment solutions that complement the Microsofts existing development solutions, as we do not compete directly against Microsoft in these areas. The 1% decrease in licenses and other revenues from our .NET product lines during the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared with the same period in 2001 was primarily due to the general economic conditions, the maturation of our products and the timing of new product releases as mentioned above for C++Builder and Delphi 7.\n\nDeploy. The 7% decrease in licenses and other revenues from our Deploy product group for the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared with the same period in 2002 was due to lower revenues generated from our VisiBroker and application server products. The 5% decrease in licenses and other revenues from our Deploy product group for the year ended December 31, 2002 as compared with the same period in 2001 was due to lower revenues generated from our VisiBroker server product. We believe that these reductions in licenses and other revenues from our Deploy products were a result of recessionary economic conditions, especially in the telecommunications and financial sectors, and geopolitical uncertainty. Revenue growth from our Deploy products category will depend upon the recovery in corporate spending for deployment solutions, our ability to capture a greater portion of government spending on technology, our ability to provide compelling technical solutions for software deployment to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and our ability to integrate our Deploy products with our Design and Develop products.\n\nService Revenues\n\nThe following table presents our service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, and dollar and percentage changes from the prior year (in thousands, except percentages).\n\nService revenues represent amounts earned for technical support, consulting and training services for software products. The increase in service revenues in the year ended December 31, 2003 from the year ended December 31, 2002 was primarily a result of an increase in technical support revenues and, to a lesser extent, an increase in consulting revenues.\n\n28\n\nTable of Contents\n\nThe following table presents our services and other revenues by service category and its percentage of total services and other revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (in thousands, except percentages):\n\n2003\n\n2002\n\n2001\n\nTechnical support\n\n$ 53,108 70 % $ 25,148 63 % $ 22,507 65 %\n\nConsulting and training\n\n23,084 30 % 14,950 37 % 12,220 35 %\n\nServices and other revenues\n\n$ 76,192 100 % $ 40,098 100 % $ 34,727 100 %\n\nThe 111% year to year growth in technical support revenues from 2002 to 2003 was due to the acquisitions of TogetherSoft and Starbase, and a larger percentage of our customers purchasing support contracts. Historically, a greater percentage of TogetherSoft and Starbase revenues were from larger enterprises, therefore a greater percentage of their customers purchased support contracts. With the acquisitions completed in 2003, our support revenues benefited from the fair value of support contracts assumed in the acquisitions and the annual renewals of those contracts. The 12% growth in technical support revenues in 2002 from 2001 was due to increased sales of our enterprise-level support offerings, principally due to the increased demand for our Java products in 2002 when compared to 2001. The 82% increase in consulting revenues for the year ended December 31, 2003, when compared with the same period in the prior year, was due to an increased emphasis on products with a greater process focus (our Design products) and approximately $3.8 million in consulting revenue recognized from large development projects with three technology partners. The 25% increase in consulting revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002, when compared with the same period in 2001, was due to the timing of the completion of certain consulting engagements.\n\nOver the longer term, we expect growth, if any, in our support revenues and our consulting and training revenues to depend on our success in sellin"
