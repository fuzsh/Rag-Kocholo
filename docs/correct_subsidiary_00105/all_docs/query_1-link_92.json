        "text": "California History: Golden Opportunity\n\nDid the discovery of gold in 1848 ensure that California would become one of the world’s largest economies? Yes and no. We must give credit to all the people who came from around the world and the East Coast and the Midwest. Without these pioneers, California wouldn’t be what it is today.\n\nFrom Prunes to Processors\n\nOne can pose a similar question about Silicon Valley, the state’s 20th-century Gold Rush. After Santa Clara Valley’s orchard production peaked in 1950, it was on its way to becoming the technology capital, a transformation set in motion when local engineers worked on then-state-of-the-art wireless technology at least 40 years earlier: radio. By the mid-1960s, the former prune capital of America had the largest concentration of microelectronics companies in the world. The name “Silicon Valley” was coined by a journalist in 1971.\n\nMany of California’s high-tech companies are founded or led by immigrants and transplants from other states. The story seems to repeat itself. It’s not just individuals who flock to Silicon Valley; large corporations have always established a presence in this technology mecca—from IBM and Lockheed in the 1950s to Xerox and Nortel Networks in the 1970s and more recent arrivals such as Wipro Technologies and Infosys Technologies.\n\nBeyond the Valley of Semiconductors\n\nNot only are there low-key computer software and hardware companies all over the Bay Area today, the Peninsula, for example, is home to the country’s largest biotechnology concentration. Aerospace companies and defense contractors were some of the major employers during the 1960s and 70s. The Bay Area also has a long history of working with the entertainment industry in areas such as gaming, computer graphics, and computer animation. And the Internet has made several local companies household names."
