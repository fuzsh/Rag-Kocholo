        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (The Red Herring) - Critical Path, a San Francisco-based email infrastructure provider, has added two industry luminaries to its board of directors: Christos Cotsakos, president and CEO of ETrade, and Lisa Gansky, a partner at Trading Fours and former CEO and founder of Global Network Navigator. The 55-person firm is growing fast after signing deals for $17 million in financing in March.\n\nHow did Critical Path CEO David Hayden get two busy executives on his board? \"It wasn't a real arm-twisting thing,\" he says. Benchmark Capital, one of the company's venture backers, also funded ETrade, and when word came around that the online stockbroker was considering another firm to host its email operations, Benchmark partner and CP board member Kevin Harvey helped arrange a visit. \"It started as a sales call,\" Hayden notes dryly. \"And turned into a board relationship.\"\n\nDoes Hayden's name ring a bell? Critical Path, whose other venture backers include Mohr, Davidow Ventures and Softbank, is his second online venture; he was also CEO of McKinley, the online reviews site sold to Excite in 1996, whose dealings with Wolff New Media are chronicled in Michael Wolff's new-media tell-all Burn Rate.\n\nSee ETrade's Digital Universe profile.\n\nWeb-tracking company taps software veteran for board\n\nRoger Sippl, who has founded three software companies, has signed up to guide another one. Andromedia announced last week that the founder of Informix, Vantive, and Visigenic will join its board of directors.\n\nAccording to Andromedia CEO Kent Godfrey, persuading Sippl to become a director didn't take \"much persuading -- just timing.\" Godfrey notes that he's known Sippl for 15 years. \"Selling Visigenic to Borland created the opening,\" says Godfrey. Sippl Macdonald Ventures had already invested in the startup earlier this year.\n\nAndromedia has ventured far afield to land big funding deals.\n\nEpiphany for KPMG executive\n\nEpiphany, a Kleiner Perkins-backed \"enterprise relationship management\" software firm, has landed Roger Siboni, formerly chief operating officer at giant consultancy KPMG Peat Marwick, as its new president and chief operating officer. \"Roger was our first and only choice,\" said Kleiner Perkins partners John Doerr. \"We're thrilled Roger is coming back home to the Valley.\"\n\nFor Doerr, getting the new recruit may also be sweet revenge on KPMG, which famously dissed Doerr-backed Netscape in favor of Microsoft on a gigantic sales deal in 1997. Not that Doerr's averse to raiding within his ranks, either; Epiphany also tapped a senior Netscape exec, Karen Richardson, as its executive vice president of sales.\n\nLosing the KPMG deal was the first of many events that sent Netscape veering off course.\n\nTalent pool\n\nNeoMagic has hired Amnon Fisher away from LSI Logic's consumer products group to head up a new consumer division in the multimedia chipmaker as senior vice president ... Motive Communications rounded out its startup team with two new vice presidents: Doug McNary for sales, and Pat Motola for product development ... CrossWorlds software hired Kevin FitzGerald away from Netscape to be its new vice president of sales in the Americas ... Daryoush Paknad -- another Netscapee -- is Glyphica's new chief technology officer and VP of development ... Michael Dunn, former president and CEO of Context Integration, was abruptly booted out; he was recently replaced by Norm Smith, who had been serving as chief operating officer of systems integrator Racotek ... Adauction.com appointed former Ziff-Davis exec J. Scott Briggs as chairman and added Ron Conway and Chris Redlitz to its board (Conway also serves on the board of Red Herring Communications) ... Steven Rubinow has joined AdKnowledge as chief information officer; he comes to the ad-serving firm from Fidelity Investments."
