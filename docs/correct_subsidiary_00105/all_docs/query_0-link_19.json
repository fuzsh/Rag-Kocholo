        "text": "Borland Enterprise Server Windows Unix\n\nBorland Enterprise Server was Borland's Java EE Application Server. The product was developed in 1999 within the team of former Visigenic company that was acquired by Borland in 1997. Borland's Java Studio was supposed to have BES and JBuilder tightly integrated, but in reality this integration never happened. BES suffered compatibility problems even with Borland's own products (JDataStore, OptimizeIt). The appearance of free commercial grade (and more mature) application servers, like JBoss, made BES unattractive and unable to really compete with the former.\n\nFoxPro DOS Windows Unix MacOS\n\nFoxPro, originally from Fox Software and later Microsoft, is a relational database that clones the functionality of dBase IV, but offers vast speed improvements. It was based on Fox Software's FoxBASE (a dBASE II clone) and FoxBASE+ (a dBase III Plus clone). It adds a new mac-like user interface that was first developed for FoxBASE+/Mac.\n\nIBM VisualAge C++ Windows OS2 Unix\n\nIBM VisualAge C++ is a set of development tools that include an IDE, compiler, debugger, code browser, and on-line help. VisualAge C++ is the successor of IBM C Set\n\nIBM VisualAge Smalltalk Windows OS2 Unix\n\nVisualAge Smalltalk is a powerful application server and development environment based around the Smalltalk language.\n\nMicro Focus Cobol DOS Unix\n\nMicro Focus COBOL is a powerful high-speed COBOL language compiler that supported cross platform development between DOS, Windows, OS/2 and Unix. It features an interface developer for both GUIs and text mode, a code debugger, a code analyzer, and later versions included support for object oriented code development. It claimed it made COBOL programmers more efficient, while speeding up migration from mainframes to personal computers.\n\nMicrosoft BASIC DOS CPM OS2 Unix MacOS\n\nAlthough Microsoft did not invent BASIC, their founding product was a BASIC interpreter for the Altair computer. The descendants below includes Microsoft's BASIC-80 (MBASIC), BASIC-86 (pre-GWBasic), BASIC for Mac, BASIC Compiler 86/88, Basic Compiler for Mac, and Professional Development System 7.x. IBM Personal Computer Basic Compiler, GW-BASIC, QuickBasic, and Visual Basic are listed separately.\n\nOpen Genera Unix\n\nGenera is a commercial operating system and integrated development environment for Lisp machines developed by Symbolics. It is essentially a fork of an earlier operating system originating on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) AI Lab's Lisp machines which Symbolics had used in common with Lisp Machines, Inc. (LMI), and Texas Instruments (TI). Genera is also sold by Symbolics as Open Genera, which runs Genera on computers based on a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) Alpha processor using Tru64 UNIX. the programming language Lisp. software using a mix of programming styles with extensive support for object-oriented programming.\n\nSun Java Workshop Windows Unix\n\nSun's Java WorkShop is a powerful, visual development tool for professional Java programmers. Java WorkShop offers a complete, easy-to-use (for bizarre masochistic definitions of easy) toolset for building JavaBeans, Java applets and applications faster and easier than ever before.\n\nSybase Adaptive Server Enterprise Unix\n\nSybase Adaptive Server Enterprise 11.9.2 for Solaris Released in 1998 by Sybase For Solaris Server, is a powerful relational database primarily used on Unix systems.
