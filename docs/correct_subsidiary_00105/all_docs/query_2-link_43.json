        "text": "Easy setup and support for the latest CORBA and J2EE standards help make Borland AppServer 4.5 suitable for any smaller to midsize Web initiative. Though AppServer lagged in our performance testing, it offers several strengths, including excellent interoperability with other systems and the industry-leading developer tool, JBuilder.\n\nInstalling the application server was a simple matter of running a setup program and configuring our test machines using the Java-based AppServer Consoleâ€”no tweaking of text files. Administrators can use this same management console (similar to IBM's WebSphere) on multiple platforms. The console can import the J2EE JAR, WAR (Web archive), and EAR (enterprise archive) files necessary to deploy a site as well as view and edit EJB descriptors. As with most of the products here, when EJB deployers import an archive, its integrity is checked. AppServer's interface and the quality of its verifier's feedback are outstanding. It checks for missing bean interfaces and classes, as well as incompatible XML descriptor settings (such as transaction and security options).\n\nWizards make generating client-side EJB JARs (which programmers need in order to create clients) a far less painful task than it might otherwise be. We also liked the clear and comprehensible online help and tutorials, which walked us through basic administration tasks and introduced the big picture of creating and using EJBs in Web applications.\n\nUsing the AppServer Console, administrators can manage multiple server nodes easily. We liked that it lets you view server activity for all of the EJBs on each server, and finding log and error files was easy. When it comes to load balancing, AppServer is capable, though perhaps not as powerful as some of the others we tested. Borland offers a separate product, AppCenter ($4,000 per CPU list), which provides better control of load balancing and improves availability.\n\nThough the console isn't Web-based, you can perform all administrative tasks remotely via the command line. In testing, we used the command line to generate text-based reports on bean and memory usage to help tweak configuration settings. Alternatively, the Java-based console provides several precanned simple graphical reports.\n\nBecause it is based on the underlying Visigenic ORB 4.5 and CORBA standards, Borland's strengths (like Sybase's) include excellent interoperability with legacy systems, including those written in C++ and Borland Delphi. Through its partner Tibco Software, Borland offers a variety of separately priced connector solutions, which can get your system to interoperate with more than 100 legacy APIs and systems (such as PeopleSoft and SAP). AppServer's CORBA support makes it easy to integrate new and old systems. The product is also J2EE branded, with full support for today's Java standards and APIs.\n\nJBuilder 4 Enterprise Java IDE has first-rate EJB development features and a powerful modeling wizard that can generate components based on database tables. We liked its ability to join EJB components. Besides targeting Borland AppServer EJBs, JBuilder can also target JAR files for BEA's WebLogic 5.1 (with support for IBM's WebSphere and other app servers in the works).\n\nThere's excellent support for end-to-end debugging, including a nifty feature that generates code for testing all your EJBs before integrating them into a Web application. One missing item, however, is a visual interface for creating JSPs. Though they can target other application servers with JBuilder, developers will appreciate the integration between this Java IDE and AppServer.\n\nWhen it comes to raw performance, Borland's AppServer suffered from a lack of scalability on our tests. According to Borland, our tests exposed a problem with the integrated Tomcat JSP container. Calls between the EJB container and Tomcat were not located in the same process, and this slowed the server down. Borland say this limitation will be fixed in a maintenance release.\n\nAppServer also had trouble performing effective load balancing on our tests. Borland claimed the product would scale better with a single, multiprocessor box rather than with clustered servers. Administrators of large server farms will want the separate AppCenter product for more capable load balancing and failover."
