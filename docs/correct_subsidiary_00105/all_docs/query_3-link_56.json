Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.Find sources: – ( June 2015) The 1980s: Foundations Three Danish citizens, Niels Jensen, Ole Henriksen, and Mogens Glad, founded Borland Ltd. In August 1981 to develop products like Word Index for the operating system using an. However, response to the company's products at the CP/M-82 show in San Francisco showed that a U.S.\n\nCompany would be needed to reach the American market. They met, who had just moved to Silicon Valley, and who had been a key developer of the. The three Danes had embarked, at first successfully, on marketing software first from Denmark, and later from Ireland, before running into some challenges at the time when they met Philippe Kahn. Kahn was chairman, president, and CEO of Borland Inc. From its inception in 1983 until 1995. Main shareholders at the incorporation of Borland were Niels Jensen (250,000 shares), Ole Henriksen (160,000), Mogens Glad (100,000), and Kahn (80,000). Borland developed a series of well-regarded software development tools.\n\nIts first product was in 1983, developed by (who later developed.NET and C# for Microsoft) and before Borland acquired the product sold in Scandinavia under the name of Compas Pascal. 1984 saw the launch of, a time organization, notebook, and calculator utility that was an early and popular (TSR) for operating systems.By the mid-1980s the company had become so successful that it had the largest exhibit at the 1985 other than IBM or AT&T. Reported that 'the legend of Turbo Pascal has by now reached mythic proportions, as evidenced by the number of firms that, in marketing meetings, make plans to become 'the next Borland'.\n\nAfter Turbo Pascal and Sidekick the company successfully launched other applications such as SuperKey and Lightning, all developed in Denmark. While the Danes remained majority shareholders, board members included Kahn, John Nash, and David Heller. With the assistance of John Nash and David Heller, both British members of the Borland Board, the company was taken public on London's Unlisted Securities Market (USM) in 1986. Was the lead investment banker. According to the London IPO filings, the management team was Philippe Kahn as President, Spencer Ozawa as VP of Operations, Marie Bourget as CFO, and Spencer Leyton as VP of sales and business development, while all software development was continuing to take place in Denmark and later London as the Danish co-founders moved there.\n\nA first US IPO followed in 1989 after Ben Rosen joined the Borland board with as the lead banker and a second offering in 1991 with Lazard as the lead banker. All offerings were very successful and over-subscribed.In 1985 Borland acquired Analytica and its database product. The engineering team of Analytica, managed by and including Reflex co-founder, became the core of Borland's engineering team in the USA. Brad Silverberg was VP of engineering until he left in early 1990 to head up the Personal Systems division at. Adam Bosworth initiated and headed up the project until moving to Microsoft later in 1990 to take over the project which eventually became.In 1987 Borland purchased Wizard Systems and incorporated portions of the Wizard C technology into. Bob Jervis, the author of Wizard C became a Borland employee.\n\nTurbo C was released on May 18, 1987, and an estimated 100,000 copies were shipped in the first month of its release. This apparently drove a wedge between Borland and Niels Jensen and the other members of his team who had been working on a brand new series of compilers at their London development centre. An agreement was reached and they spun off a company called Jensen & Partners International(JPI), later.\n\nJPI first launched a MS-DOS compiler named JPI Modula-2, that later became TopSpeed Modula-2, and followed up with TopSpeed C, TopSpeed C and TopSpeed Pascal compilers for both the MS-DOS and OS/2 operating systems. The TopSpeed compiler technology exists today as the underlying technology of the 4GL programming language, a Windows development tool.In September 1987 Borland purchased Ansa-Software, including their (version 2.0) management tool. Richard Schwartz, a cofounder of Ansa, became Borland's CTO and Ben Rosen joined the Borland board.The spreadsheet was launched in 1989 with, at the time, a notable improvement and charting capabilities. Lotus Development, under the leadership of sued Borland for copyright infringement (see ). The litigation, brought forward Borland's open standards position as opposed to Lotus' closed approach. Borland, under Kahn's leadership took a position of principle and announced that they would defend against Lotus' legal position and 'fight for programmer's rights'. After a decision in favor of Borland by the, the case went to the United States Supreme Court.\n\nBecause Justice had recused himself, only eight Justices heard the case, and it ended in a 4–4 tie. As a result, the First Circuit decision remained standing, but the Supreme Court result, being a tie, did not bind any other court and set no national precedent.Additionally, Borland was known for its practical and creative approach towards and (IP), introducing its 'Borland no-nonsense license agreement'. This allowed the developer/user to utilize its products 'just like a book'; he or she was allowed to make multiple copies of a program, as long as only one copy was in use at any point in time.\n\nThe 1990s: Rise and change In September 1991 Borland purchased, bringing the and databases to the house, in an all-stock transaction. Competition with Microsoft was fierce. Launched the competing database and bought the dBase clone in 1992, undercutting Borland's prices.\n\nDuring the early 1990s Borland's implementation of and outsold Microsoft's. Borland survived as a company, but no longer had the dominance in software tools that it once had. It has gone through a radical transition in products, financing, and staff, now a very different company from the one which challenged Microsoft and Lotus in the early 1990s.The internal problems that arose with the Ashton-Tate merger were a large part of the fall.\n\nAshton-Tate's product portfolio proved to be weak, with no provision for evolution into the GUI environment of Windows. Almost all product lines were discontinued. The consolidation of duplicate support and development offices was costly and disruptive. Worst of all, the highest revenue earner of the combined company was dBASE with no Windows version ready. Borland had an internal project to clone dBASE which was intended to run on Windows and was part of the strategy of the acquisition, but by late 1992 this was abandoned due to technical flaws and the company had to constitute a replacement team (the team, redeployed) headed by to redo the job. Borland lacked the financial strength to project its marketing and move internal resources off other products to shore up the dBASE/W effort. Layoffs occurred in 1993 to keep the company afloat, the third instance of this in five years.\n\nBy the time dBASE for Windows eventually shipped, the developer community had moved on to other products such as Clipper or FoxBase, and dBASE never regained significant share of Ashton-Tate's former market. This happened against the backdrop of the rise in Microsoft's combined Office product marketing. A change in market conditions also contributed to Borland's fall from prominence. In the 1980s, companies had few people who understood the growing personal computer phenomenon, and so most technical people were given free rein to purchase whatever software they thought they needed. Borland had done an excellent job marketing to those with a highly technical bent. By the mid-1990s, however, companies were beginning to ask what the return was on the investment they had made in this loosely controlled PC software buying spree.\n\nCompany executives were starting to ask questions that were hard for technically minded staff to answer, and so corporate standards began to be created. This required new kinds of marketing and support materials from software vendors, but Borland remained focused on the technical side of its products.During 1993 Borland explored ties with as a possible way to form a suite of programs to rival Microsoft's nascent integration strategy. WordPerfect itself was struggling with a late and troubled transition to Windows.\n\nThe eventual joint company effort, named Borland Office for Windows (a combination of the WordPerfect word processor, Quattro Pro spreadsheet and Paradox database) was introduced at the 1993 Comdex computer show. Borland Office never made significant in-roads against Microsoft Office. WordPerfect was then bought. In October 1994, Borland sold Quattro Pro and rights to sell up to million copies of Paradox to Novell for $140 million in cash, repositioning the company on its core software development tools and the Interbase database engine and shifting toward client-server scenarios in corporate applications. This later proved a good foundation for the shift to web development tools.and the Borland board disagreed on how to focus the company, and Kahn resigned as chairman, CEO and president, after 12 years, in January 1995. Kahn remained on the board until November 7, 1996.\n\nBorland named as CEO, but he resigned in July 1996. Was interim CEO until September of that year, when became interim president and CEO (along with other executive changes), followed by a succession of CEOs including and.The (RAD) environment was launched in 1995, under the leadership of.In 1996 Borland acquired Open Environment Corporation, a Cambridge-based company founded by.On November 25, 1996, was hired as Borland CEO and chairman.In 1997, Borland sold to, but retained all development rights for the core. In November 1997, Borland acquired, a middleware company that was focused on implementations of.Inprise Corporation era On April 29, 1998, Borland refocused its efforts on targeting enterprise applications development. Borland hired marketing firm to come up with a new name for the company. Yocam explained that the new name, Inprise, was meant to evoke 'integrating the enterprise'.\n\nThe idea was to integrate Borland's tools, and with enterprise environment software, including Visigenic's implementations of CORBA, for C and Java, and the new product,.For a number of years (both before and during the Inprise name) Borland suffered from serious financial losses and poor public image. When the name was changed to Inprise, many thought Borland had gone out of business. In March 1999, dBase was sold to KSoft, Inc. Which was soon renamed to dBASE Inc. (In 2004 dBASE Inc.\n\nWas renamed to DataBased Intelligence, Inc.).In 1999, Dale L. Fuller replaced Yocam. At this time Fuller's title was 'interim president and CEO.' The 'interim' was dropped in December 2000. Served in senior executive positions with the company from 2000 to 2004.A proposed merger between Inprise and Corel was announced in February 2000, aimed at producing -based products. The scheme was abandoned when Corel's shares fell and it became clear that there was really no strategic fit.6.0 was made available as in July 2000.Borland Software Corporation era In January 2001, the Inprise name was abandoned and the company became 'Borland' once more.Under the Borland name and a new management team headed by president and CEO Dale L. Fuller, a now-smaller and profitable Borland refocused on Delphi, and created a version of Delphi and C Builder for Linux, both under the name.\n\nThis brought Borland's expertise in to the Linux platform for the first time. Kylix was launched in 2001.Plans to spin off the division as a separate company were abandoned after Borland and the people who were to run the new company could not agree on terms for the separation. Borland stopped open-source releases of InterBase and has developed and sold new versions at a fast pace.In 2001 Delphi 6 became the first integrated development environment to support web services. All of the company's development platforms now support web services.was released in 2003 as a native development tool, competing with. As of the 2005 release, C#Builder, Delphi for Win32, and Delphi for.NET have been combined into a single IDE called 'Borland Developer Studio' (though the combined IDE is still popularly known as 'Delphi'). In late 2002 Borland purchased design tool vendor TogetherSoft and tool publisher, makers of the configuration management tool and the requirements management tool (eventually, CaliberRM was renamed as 'Caliber' ). The latest releases of and Delphi integrate these tools to give developers a broader set of tools for development.Former CEO Dale Fuller quit in July 2005, but remained on the board of directors.\n\nFormer COO Scott Arnold took the title of interim president and chief executive officer until November 8, 2005, when it was announced that would take over as CEO effective November 9, 2005. Nielsen remained with the company until January 2009, when he accepted the position of at; CFO Erik Prusch then took over as acting president and CEO.In early 2007 Borland announced new branding for its focus around open application life-cycle management. In April 2007 Borland announced that it would relocate its headquarters and development facilities to. It also has development centers at, and, Austria.On May 6, 2009, the company announced it was to be acquired by for $75 million. The transaction was approved by Borland shareholders on July 22, 2009, with Micro Focus acquiring the company for $1.50/share.\n\nFollowing Micro Focus shareholder approval and the required corporate filings, the transaction was completed in late July 2009. It was estimated to have 750 employees at the time. Subsidiaries.
