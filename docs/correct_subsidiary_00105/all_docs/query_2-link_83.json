In this paper, we present a survey of some of the most important features for Java, Web, and distributed object technologies. We begin with a description of two key issues in Java technology, including Java component models (i.e., JavaBeans and Enterprise JavaBeans), and Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). We then describe the relevant techniques on advanced Web documents: Dynamic HTML (DHTML), Document Object Model (DOM), and Extensible Markup Language (XML). Further, distributed object standards are reviewed, including OMG’s CORBA and Microsoft’s COM/DCOM/COM+. Finally, we explore Java distributed objects, which represents an integration of Java and distributed object technologies to provide a new and promising paradigm for software applications and development."
