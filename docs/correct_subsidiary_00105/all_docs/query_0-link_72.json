Source Code Control Operations from within the Visual C++ IDE\n\nThe Configuration Manager is a complex system that allows developers to work\n\non different versions of projects. So multiple teams of developers can use different\n\nversions of the project in different stages of development. The tool also allows the\n\ndevelopers to compile & build projects using different compilers and for different\n\nplatforms. The application uses the PVCS Developers Toolkit to perform SCC Operations.\n\nThere are many classes written from scratch that encapsulate the functionality of the\n\nsystem which is about 10k lines of C++ code.\n\nThe Architecture of the Configuration Manager is as follows :\n\na. The Environment Module which is a MFC extension DLL.\n\nb. The Source Code Control Module which is also a MFC extension DLL.\n\nc. The Visual C++ Plug - In Module that is a MFC regular DLL.\n\nd.
