So if the OS uses a signed\n\nlongword for file pointers, you get a 2GB limitation.\n\nOn NT, we support 4GB files because the OS uses unsigned longwords for\n\nfile pointers, and hence gets 4GB of addressable file space.\n\n57\n\nAage Johansen replied on 02-Aug-1999:\n\nBill Karwin wrote:\n\n(snip)\n\n4GB InterBase works OK, but I don't think you will be able to run the 'Database\n\nStatistics' of the IN Server manager.

Two ways 1) is to do it\n\nprogrammically or 2) create an instance during design time. Creating\n\nan (field)instance is using the fields editor. To do this, put a query\n\nstatement in the SQL property of TQuery, ie - select * from sometable.\n\n60\n\nHoward Roscoe replied on 17-Sep-1999:\n\nHi,\n\nAssuming your TCP/IP network bits and pieces are set up correctly, and\n\nassuming your using WISQL, when you go into the connect Dialogue, the server\n\ntype should be local and the path to your database would be\n\n:\\\\YourGDB.Gdb\n\n60"
