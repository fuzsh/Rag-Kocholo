        "text": "Actor Windows\n\nActor, released by The Whitewater Group, Inc. and later Genesis Development Systems, is an object oriented programming language and environment similar to Smalltalk. It is a completely Windows-native environment, and was among the early applications written for Windows. Actor 2 ran under Microsoft Windows 2, and Actor 1.0 runs under Windows 1.\n\nAlpha Four / Alpha Five DOS Windows\n\nAlpha Four and Alpha Five, from Alpha Software, are a relational database management system and rapid application development platform. It is now known as \"Alpha Anywhere\".\n\nBorland C++ DOS Windows OS2\n\nBorland C++ targeted the professional application development market, while Turbo C++ targeted the home and hobbyist market. Borland C++ included additional tools, compiler code-optimization, and documentation to address the needs of commercial developers. In 1997 Borland C++ was replaced with Borland C++ Builder.\n\nBorland C++ Builder Windows\n\nFirst released in 1997, Borland C++ Builder is a Rapid Application Design environment that uses the C++ language, but includes the same GUI IDE as Borland Delphi. It includes the Delphi compiler and can make use of Delphi code in C++ projects. Borland C++ Builder replaces Borland C++ product. This product was targeted at business and enterprise customers. Current supported versions are sold by Embarcadero Technologies.\n\nBorland Delphi Windows\n\nBorland Delphi is a Windows based Object Pascal development environment. It was based on the earlier Borland Pascal product and adds a GUI IDE geared towards Rapid Application Development. Some of its functionality was merged in to Borland C++ Builder but both continued to be sold alongside each other. Current supported versions are sold by Embarcadero Technologies.\n\nBorland Enterprise Server Windows Unix\n\nBorland Enterprise Server was Borland's Java EE Application Server. The product was developed in 1999 within the team of former Visigenic company that was acquired by Borland in 1997. Borland's Java Studio was supposed to have BES and JBuilder tightly integrated, but in reality this integration never happened. BES suffered compatibility problems even with Borland's own products (JDataStore, OptimizeIt). The appearance of free commercial grade (and more mature) application servers, like JBoss, made BES unattractive and unable to really compete with the former.\n\nBorland Pascal Windows\n\nBorland Pascal is basically a \"professional\" version of the Turbo Pascal product that was introduced after Turbo Pascal 6. It includes both the DOS IDE and compiler as well as the Windows IDE from Turbo Pascal For Windows. Borland Pascal was succeeded by Borland Delphi\n\nBorland Turbo Assembler DOS Windows\n\nTurbo Assembler is an x86 16-bit assembler from Borland. It competed against, and was often cited as faster than Microsoft Macro Assembler.\n\nBorland Turbo C++ DOS Windows\n\nAfter Turbo C, Turbo C++ was Borland's home and entry level offering for a C/C++ compiler for MS-DOS and Windows. For a time, it was sold along side their professional Borland C++ product line.\n\nBorland Turbo Pascal DOS Windows MacOS\n\nBorland Turbo Pascal is a Pascal programming language compiler with an Integrated Development Environment targeted at the hobbyist and entry-level market. There were versions for CP/M and DOS. For a time, it was sold along side their professional \"Borland Pascal\" product line. Borland also produced a set of \"toolbox\" libraries along side their earlier versions.\n\nClipper DOS Windows\n\nClipper, from Nantucket Corp and later Computer Associates, started out as a native code compiler for dBase III databases, and later evolved in to a full fledge database language and application development environment.\n\nCrystal Reports Windows\n\nCrystal Reports, from Crystal Services/Seagate Technology Inc., is a powerful visual report creation tool for Microsoft Windows. Rather than a specific product, it is designed to work with almost any existing database product. reports from directly from within their applications. Crystal Reports was sometimes bundled with Microsoft Visual Basic. And it can be used with Crystal Reports Server for scheduled report generation.\n\ndBFast Windows\n\ndBFast is a dBase application compiler for DOS, the Microsoft Windows environment, and Macintosh. The DOS version was considered very limited and buggy. The Windows version was first released in 1989 for Windows 2.x, and supposedly the first \"relational\" database for Windows. changes. Windows specific features include support for mouse, buttons, menus, Dynamic Data Exchange, graphing, and graphics data fields.\n\nDigitalk Smalltalk/V DOS Windows OS2\n\nSmalltalk/V was the first widely available version of Smalltalk.

It was based on Fox Software's FoxBASE (a dBASE II clone) and FoxBASE+ (a dBase III Plus clone). It adds a new mac-like user interface that was first developed for FoxBASE+/Mac.\n\nIBM DB2 Windows OS2\n\nIBM DB2, or Database 2, is a relational database originally developed for IBM's mainframe systems, and targeted at enterprise customers.\n\nIBM VisualAge C++ Windows OS2 Unix\n\nIBM VisualAge C++ is a set of development tools that include an IDE, compiler, debugger, code browser, and on-line help. VisualAge C++ is the successor of IBM C Set\n\nIBM VisualAge for Basic Windows OS2\n\nIBM VisualAge for Basic delivers a suite of application development tools built around an implementation of the BASIC programming language for developers creating GUI clients and for DB2 application programmer who want to use BASIC to create GUI clients, DB2 stored procedures and user-defined functions. VA Basic is compatible with early Microsoft Visual Basic versions and was available in versions for both 32 bit OS/2 and MS Windows.\n\nIBM VisualAge Smalltalk Windows OS2 Unix\n\nVisualAge Smalltalk is a powerful application server and development environment based around the Smalltalk language.\n\nInfoMaker Windows\n\nInfoMaker is a comprehensive reporting and data-analysis tools for rapidly unlocking business information.
