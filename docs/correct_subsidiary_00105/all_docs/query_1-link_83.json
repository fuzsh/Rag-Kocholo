        "text": "The Corel-Inprise merger: a union of software chameleons\n\n(IDG) -- In the wake of this week's announced union of Corel and Inprise, software pundits and users alike are scratching their heads over a merger that can seem confusing.\n\nThe merger, which could signal yet another change for the chameleon that is Inprise, is raising questions about the company's commitment to Windows development tools and generally to platforms other than Linux.\n\nPartly as a result of layoffs during lean times and partly due to attrition tied to the company's instability, Inprise's product development has lagged in recent years, according to some observers.\n\nThat drop-off is one reason the combined company is pinning its hopes on the contributions of the Linux community.\n\nIt is unclear, however, how the company will handle its many tools and middleware partnerships with the likes of Oracle and Novell.\n\nMORE COMPUTING INTELLIGENCE IDG.net home page Corel and Inprise to support Linux Corel's Office versus Microsoft?

People [like Corel and other Linux distributors] with server operating systems seem to have this death wish to compete head to head with Windows. No one has ever done it successfully,\" Tarter said.\n\n\"Corel does have a serious support problem. Not sure how well it is known. Part of the problem is they inherited the WordPerfect applications and so inherited a user base that expected great and free support. But what did they do? They started charging for it and producing [inadequate] support. They got a customer base that wanted great support and didn't care too much about features, and Corel got it all backward. Their support is miserable,\" Tarter said.\n\nAlso, in light of Corel's emphasis on desktop Linux, the extent to which server-side Linux and attendant middleware and tools receive their due becomes questionable, according to observers.\n\nIn other words, they question whether Corel will vigorously promote Inprise middleware and enterprise tools, such as the tools that facilitate the coexistence of Microsoft's COM and the Object Management Group's CORBA architectures.\n\nOnly the VisiBroker ORB seems safe in any post-merger stock-taking, according to some observers who noted that Corel stands to gain by bundling its eventual Linux server with Inprise tools and middleware.\n\nConsidering the storied paths of these two companies, both of which have undergone numerous transformations and rebirths, the merger warrants a look at the partners' lineage.\n\nOver the past decade Corel has shed its skin several times to better fit in with whatever operating environment was in fashion. While its current hardcore drive into the Linux market looks promising, the company has never quite broken into the top tier of desktop applications players despite fervent attempts on multiple operating system platforms.\n\nFounded by Michael Cowpland in 1985, Corel made its first breakthrough with a version of CorelDraw in 1989 for DOS. However the company did not begin to make any significant headway until 1992 when it delivered the industry's first all-in-one graphics suite, CorelDraw 3.0 for Windows 3.1.\n\nDuring this time the company dabbled in some fringe markets delivering versions of its core products for IBM's OS/2 and Unix-based desktops, but had little success there. Corel also delivered the first graphics suite for the Macintosh in 1996, Corel Draw 6.0 for the Power Macintosh, which fared better.\n\nAgain trying to be first to market on a new platform, the company in the summer of 1995 launched the first major 32-bit application for Windows 95, CorelDraw 6.0.\n\nThe following year Corel made a bold move attempting to get into the office productivity market by acquiring the almost legendary WordPerfect series. The company put a lot of marketing muscle behind the venerable product, which many observers even then thought had seen its best days, particularly in light of the rocketing sales of Microsoft's desktop Office suite.\n\nCorel then added Borland staples Quattro Pro and Paradox to its productivity suite, which represented the first dealings between the two companies, but those additions did little to help build momentum against Office, keeping the company's market share percentage well down in the single digits.\n\nThe company then shifted gears in an effort to capitalize on Java's popularity, announcing a couple of years ago its intention to deliver a pure Java version of its productivity suite. The company delivered the product to beta testers, but just before it was to launch the finished version, it cancelled the project, selling off pieces to GraphOn. This was perhaps a prescient decision given that the market for pure Java-based versions of major applications has failed to materialize.\n\nFinally, after trying on a variety of operating systems in an effort to find its niche, the company seems to have settled on Linux.\n\nWith a firm commitment both at the desktop operating system and applications levels, Corel appears to have its best chance yet at grabbing significant market at both. The company reported Monday that it has recorded just over 1 million downloads of Corel WordPerfect for Linux. It has also generated over $3.2 million in sales for the desktop version of its Linux operating system just since November.\n\nWhile not exactly a giant-killer, Corel has proven to be a worthy adversary to Microsoft, according to Tarter.\n\n\"Much of the time they [Corel] behave like a plausible number two company in some of these markets. They will never displace Microsoft, but they are generally good at going places where Microsoft can't go,\" Tarter said. \"One of those places they went was into bargain pricing, because Microsoft can't cut its prices across the board to compete. They continuously find points of vulnerability at Microsoft. Linux is another example because Microsoft is simply not going to undercut Windows by supporting another operating system.\"\n\nHowever, Corel faces a tough challenge in head-to-head competition for customers, according to Tarter.\n\n\"It isn't always about market share. You can always win market share by picking up customers that the number one company doesn't want. The question is can you make a living from that: picking up and servicing marginal users but at a profit. It is like running a delivery service, making sure you go to places that FedEx doesn't -- like Indian villages, hermits in cabins out in the woods,\" Tarter said.\n\nInprise, formerly Borland International, is another company that has reinvented itself frequently during the last half-dozen years, mirroring many of the major shifts in the software industry that have also altered Corel's course.\n\nThe company was founded in 1983 by flamboyant mathematician and jazz musician, Philippe Kahn.\n\nBut management has never been seen as the company's strong suit, and Kahn was eventually forced out as president and then board member. The move, which was attributed to Kahn's lack of business acumen, may have been an early sign that the company would have a hard time blending in to a turf coveted by Microsoft.\n\nFrom its beginnings as a tools, database, and spreadsheet company, through its acquisition of enterprise middleware and focus on Java and Linux, the Scotts Valley, Calif.-based software firm has won praise for the quality of its products, and has engendered strong customer loyalty, while frequently suffering defeats in the marketplace.\n\nBorland was credited with helping to pioneer visual development and client/server models of programming, with tools such as Delphi, dBase, and Paradox.\n\nAfter suffering at the hands of Microsoft in the desktop productivity and visual development tools markets, the company acquired middleware vendors Open Environment and Visigenic Software. The moves signaled a turn upstream into the enterprise development and infrastructure space, and the company found success with Visigenic's VisiBroker object request broker (ORB), which has been licensed by numerous vendors and commands a significant installed base.\n\nBorland/Inprise has also seen the insides of numerous courtrooms, typifying the industry's litigious side.\n\nThe company fought well-publicized cases against Lotus (concerning spreadsheet menu commands) and Microsoft (over the latter's energetic recruitment of Borland/Inprise talent) and defended shareholder litigation.\n\nOne user organization that is pleased with the merger is the Ohio State Department of Transportation (ODOT), which has been moving off of mainframe development and using Inprise's Jbuilder product as a way to ensure it does not get locked into a single development environment.\n\n\"We've pretty much come to the conclusion that this is not an abandonment of Windows but an affirmation that they'll be able to hit multiple operating systems,\" said Angelo Serro, a technical lead at ODOT, in Columbus, Ohio. \"We still know their products are very solid on the Windows side of the fence.\"\n\nIn addition to an affirmation of Inprise's strategy to branch out beyond Windows, Serro said, the merger affirms his commitment to the company's Jbuilder product.\n\n\"This merger has made our management a little more comfortable with the direction of our development,\" Serro said. \"We know now that if the government were to step in on Windows and make it untenable to us, we could pick up our Jbuilder development on Solaris or on Linux, it gives us yet another choice, another parachute.\"\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nCorel Linux OS ideal for desktops\n\nFebruary 2, 2000\n\nOpinion: Who invited the pirates to the Linux party?\n\nFebruary 3, 2000\n\nCorel Linux will run Windows apps\n\nJanuary 10, 2000\n\nCreative Computers to launch Linux portal site\n\nJanuary 27, 2000\n\nRELATED IDG.net STORIES:\n\nInprise touts new services\n\n(IDG.net)\n\nCorel and Inprise to support Linux\n\n(Network World)\n\nSun, Inprise to bring Java 2 Platform to Linux\n\n(InfoWorld.com)\n\nCorel gambles on Linux payoff\n\n(PC World)\n\nCorel Linux will run Windows apps\n\n(Network World)\n\nCorel's Office versus Microsoft?\n\n(PC World)\n\nInprise & Microsoft may license each other's technology\n\n(Computerworld Australia)\n\nCorel and Inprise to merge\n\n(IDG.net)\n\nNote: Pages will open in a new browser window\n\nExternal sites are not endorsed by CNN Interactive.\n\nRELATED SITES:\n\nCorel\n\nInprise\n\nNote: Pages will open in a new browser window\n\nExternal sites are not endorsed by CNN Interactive.\n\nLATEST HEADLINES:"
