        "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The world of data management is facing the biggest technological shift since the advent of relational databases and client/server computing some 30 years ago. Today, unprecedented volumes of structured and unstructured data are generated at high velocity via Web, social and mobile interactions and sensors. This is giving rise to new applications that respond immediately to what people, devices and systems are doing now. And it is driving the demand for new highly distributed databases optimized for both DRAM and fast, stable flash-based storage.\n\nIn the wake of these tectonic shifts, Aerospike, Inc. has attracted Silicon Valley pioneer Roger Sippl to join the real-time database company as an advisor. Sippl, a leader in the last database revolution as founder and CEO of Informix Software, will play a strategic role in helping Aerospike to build on its technology leadership and rapid market adoption.\n\nSpearheading the Future of Database Design\n\nAlready, customers have the Aerospike real-time hybrid memory and flash database in production within some of the world’s most data-intensive environments. These companies’ real-time big data platforms rely on Aerospike to consistently respond within milliseconds, even while scaling to hundreds of thousands of transactions per second (TPS) and managing billions of objects and terabytes of data—all with 100% uptime. In three years of production, no customer using Aerospike’s ACID-compliant database has ever experienced downtime.\n\n“Databases designed around the limitations of the disk drive have served us well for the last few decades, but the emergence of Internet-scale Web applications requires a fundamentally different approach to database architecture,” Roger Sippl said. “I have seen a lot of great database companies working to address this challenge, but very few have proven their claims in real-world implementations. Aerospike clearly stands apart from the crowd with unique, groundbreaking use of DRAM and flash memory technologies and customer deployments at the forefront of managing Internet-scale data in real time. It is an exciting time to work with the Aerospike team in building on this traction.”\n\nTeaming with a Leading Entrepreneur and Innovator\n\nRoger Sippl, the managing member of Sippl Investments, LLC, is a Silicon Valley software pioneer, entrepreneur and innovator. His 30 years of contributions have helped shape the enterprise software technology landscape of today. As founder and CEO, Sippl led Informix Software in pioneering SQL relational databases and took the company public; it is now part of IBM. He then was co-founder and chairman of The Vantive Corporation, a leader in customer relationship management (CRM), which went public before becoming part of PeopleSoft/Oracle. As founder and CEO of Visigenic Software, he helped pioneer distributed object computing and the concept of the application server; Visigenic was acquired by Borland after becoming a public company. Since founding his venture capital firm in 1998, Sippl has invested in several successful software companies including SolarWinds Inc., Illustra, Broadvision, SupportSoft, and Red Pepper. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in computer science from the University of California at Berkeley.\n\n“I have long been inspired by Roger’s vision and innovation in shaping the market for enterprise software as we know it today, and it is an incredible honor to have him join Aerospike as an advisor. His insights into the database wars 30 years ago and long string of successes in building software start-ups into public companies will be invaluable as we enter our next stage of growth,” said Bruce Fram, Aerospike CEO. “With Roger joining Don Haderle, father of IBM DB2; Aerospike founders Brian Bulkowski and Srini Srinivasan; and Russell Sullivan, who previously founded AlchemyDB, we now have an incredible team of luminaries to help us navigate the current database revolution being fueled by the Internet economy.”\n\nAbout Aerospike\n\nAerospike, Inc. offers the only real-time Internet-scale database that delivers predictable high performance for mission-critical applications. Aerospike’s hybrid memory (DRAM and native flash) architecture scales up and out, consistently processing over 500k transactions per second per node with sub-millisecond latency. With automatic fail-over, replication, and cross data center synchronization, the Aerospike database reliably stores billions of objects and terabytes of data—while providing 100% uptime and 17x better TCO than other NoSQL databases. Customers accelerating their business with Aerospike include adMarketplace, Bluekai, Chango, eXelate, Federated Media, The Trade Desk and [x +1].
