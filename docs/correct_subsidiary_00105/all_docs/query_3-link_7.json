        "text": "8086 Forth 83 DOS\n\nThis is an implementation of the Forth 83 programming language for 8088/8086 computers running DOS. Forth contains many unique features and paradigms not found in modern languages.\n\nActor Windows\n\nActor, released by The Whitewater Group, Inc. and later Genesis Development Systems, is an object oriented programming language and environment similar to Smalltalk. It is a completely Windows-native environment, and was among the early applications written for Windows. Actor 2 ran under Microsoft Windows 2, and Actor 1.0 runs under Windows 1.\n\nAddin Development Kit for 1-2-3 DOS\n\nThis is a software development kit that assists developers in making add-ins for Lotus 1-2-3 4.x for DOS. Add-ins are binary programs that extend and enhance the functionality of the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet without having to change the Lotus program itself.\n\nAlpha Four / Alpha Five DOS Windows\n\nAlpha Four and Alpha Five, from Alpha Software, are a relational database management system and rapid application development platform. It is now known as \"Alpha Anywhere\".\n\nApple Lisa Pascal Workshop Other\n\nThe Apple Lisa Workshop is a set of development tools and a command-line oriented operating environment that was used to develop all software for the Apple Lisa computer. It had variants for multiple languages including Pascal, Cobol, and Basic. Although it was mostly text-based, it did use a GUI code editor. The Workshop ran separately from the Lisa Office System, and developers would switch back and forth while developing their programs.\n\nApple Macintosh 68000 Development System MacOS\n\nThis was Apple's development system for m68k based Macs that ran natively on Macintosh computers. Prior to this product, Macintosh software had to be developed on Lisa machines.\n\nArity Prolog Compiler DOS\n\nThe Arity Prolog Compiler is an implementation of the Prolog language. It features a compiler that creates high speed executables in addition to an interpreter. It competed against the less expensive Borland Turbo Prolog.\n\nASSIST/I DOS\n\nASSIST/I, by BDM Software, is an IBM Mainframe Assembler/Interpreter. It allows IBM mainframe assembler language programs to be written assembled, and executed in an interactive, non-IBM-mainframe environment.\n\nAztec C DOS\n\nAztec C is a fast and efficient C language compiler that produced compact, fast code. Its featured support for many platforms including MS-DOS, Apple II DOS 3.3 and ProDOS, Commodore 64, Macintosh, CP/M-80, CP/M-86, TRS-80, Amiga, and Atari ST. Cross compiler hosts also included VMS and Unix. It competed against Microsoft C, Apple MPW C, Lattice C, and many others.\n\nBABY/36 DOS\n\nBABY/36 is an IBM System/36 RPG (Report Program Generator) programming language clone for the IBM PC.\n\nBASIC Development Tools DOS\n\nThis is a development library, from Sterling Castle, Inc., for BASIC that includes a screen builder for developing entry forms, a data manager database, a window manager that provides windowing functions, and a help message system.\n\nBorland C++ DOS Windows OS2\n\nBorland C++ targeted the professional application development market, while Turbo C++ targeted the home and hobbyist market. Borland C++ included additional tools, compiler code-optimization, and documentation to address the needs of commercial developers. In 1997 Borland C++ was replaced with Borland C++ Builder.\n\nBorland C++ Builder Windows\n\nFirst released in 1997, Borland C++ Builder is a Rapid Application Design environment that uses the C++ language, but includes the same GUI IDE as Borland Delphi. It includes the Delphi compiler and can make use of Delphi code in C++ projects. Borland C++ Builder replaces Borland C++ product. This product was targeted at business and enterprise customers. Current supported versions are sold by Embarcadero Technologies.\n\nBorland dBase Compiler DOS\n\nBorland dBase Compiler is a dBase add-on that enables developers to create standalone high speed compiled dBase application. Developed by Ashton-Tate, the creators of dBase, it guarantees 100% compatibility with existing dBase applications. Applications built with the dBase Compiler do not require that the dBase product be installed, nor does it require any distribution royalties. Compiled applications will run many times faster than in dBase's interpreted environment. It includes support for 386 systems.\n\nBorland Delphi Windows\n\nBorland Delphi is a Windows based Object Pascal development environment. It was based on the earlier Borland Pascal product and adds a GUI IDE geared towards Rapid Application Development. Some of its functionality was merged in to Borland C++ Builder but both continued to be sold alongside each other. Current supported versions are sold by Embarcadero Technologies.\n\nBorland Enterprise Server Windows Unix\n\nBorland Enterprise Server was Borland's Java EE Application Server. The product was developed in 1999 within the team of former Visigenic company that was acquired by Borland in 1997. Borland's Java Studio was supposed to have BES and JBuilder tightly integrated, but in reality this integration never happened. BES suffered compatibility problems even with Borland's own products (JDataStore, OptimizeIt). The appearance of free commercial grade (and more mature) application servers, like JBoss, made BES unattractive and unable to really compete with the former.\n\nBorland Pascal Windows\n\nBorland Pascal is basically a \"professional\" version of the Turbo Pascal product that was introduced after Turbo Pascal 6. It includes both the DOS IDE and compiler as well as the Windows IDE from Turbo Pascal For Windows. Borland Pascal was succeeded by Borland Delphi\n\nBorland Turbo Assembler DOS Windows\n\nTurbo Assembler is an x86 16-bit assembler from Borland. It competed against, and was often cited as faster than Microsoft Macro Assembler.\n\nBorland Turbo Basic DOS\n\nTurbo BASIC is a version of Basic sold by Borland. It features an IDE similar to later Turbo Pascal/C products. After Borland stopped selling it, it was purchased back by the original author and continued under the name PowerBASIC. Borland also released a set of Turbo Basic Toolboxes\n\nBorland Turbo C DOS\n\nTurbo C is an Integrated Development Environment and compiler for the C programming language from Borland. First introduced in 1987, it was noted for its integrated development environment, small size, fast compile speed, comprehensive manuals and low price. After 2.0 it this product was replaced with Borland Turbo C++. It competed against, Microsoft Quick C and was generally considered faster and more successful.\n\nBorland Turbo C++ DOS Windows\n\nAfter Turbo C, Turbo C++ was Borland's home and entry level offering for a C/C++ compiler for MS-DOS and Windows. For a time, it was sold along side their professional Borland C++ product line.\n\nBorland Turbo Pascal DOS Windows MacOS\n\nBorland Turbo Pascal is a Pascal programming language compiler with an Integrated Development Environment targeted at the hobbyist and entry-level market. There were versions for CP/M and DOS. For a time, it was sold along side their professional \"Borland Pascal\" product line. Borland also produced a set of \"toolbox\" libraries along side their earlier versions.\n\nC Professional Development System\n\nCBASIC DOS CPM\n\nDigital Research CBASIC is a BASIC implementation that \"compiles\" basic code in to interpreted byte code that is run using a royalty-free runtime. BASIC source code is not needed to run a program. CBASIC was a popular programming language under CP/M. There were also versions for MS-DOS. MBASIC's rounding errors that were sometimes troublesome for accounting. machine code. Later versions also included support for GSX graphics extensions."
