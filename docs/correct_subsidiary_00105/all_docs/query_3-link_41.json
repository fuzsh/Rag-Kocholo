        "text": "With no new information about dBase and months of unfulfilled promises\n\nof some kind of announcement, materializes one is left ponder the future\n\nof Visual dBase. On thing is clear the future of dbase looks\n\nbleak indeed.\n\nAfter the announcement in June 98 that dBase would be transferred to\n\nInterbase, a transfer which has never taken place, neither Inprise nor\n\nInterbase has ever made another announcement concerning dBase.\n\nIn the wake of recent shake up of Inprise into two concerns, Inprise and\n\nBorland.com there has yet to be an announcement of the direction dBase.\n\nIn fact dbase is no longer on Inprise's list of products and while you\n\ncan find it on the site you will have to do some digging before it can\n\nbe located. On the list of product where it can be found it is the\n\nvery last item on the list, this position though could be a result of\n\nthe alphabetical sorting of the list, but I digress.\n\nIs dbase being setup for a big fall?\n\nIs the treatment of dbase by the power that be a message to dbase\n\nusers and supporters that we can do without you and that dbase is on the\n\nsoon to be extinct list and there is nothing you can do about it?\n\nI think we deserve better than this. Thanks to team B for the great work\n\nthey are doing, I respect and appreciate all the help and energy you\n\nhave provided to countless dbase users, a special thanksto Alan and Ken\n\nwho have pretty much taught me all I know and love about dbase.\n\nThe promises though of an impending annoucement has lost it appeal. It\n\ndoesn't work any longer. There is a well known aphorism\n\n\" A promise is a comfort to a fool\".\n\nInprise we are not a bunch of fools. Come clean with us. Tell\n\nus now about the future of dbase.\n\nPersonally I am not waiting for such an annoucement, I may be wrong but\n\nI don't believe there is one forthcoming. What I can see possibly\n\nhappening is an annoucement that dbase has died of natural causes (old\n\nage) and that all users of dbase may upgrade to one of another of\n\nInprise/Borland/Interbase product at a reduced price.\n\nI hope that I am wrong but I believe dBase is dead and Inprise is now\n\nusing team B to buy them time to come up with a strategy to allow them\n\nto convert the majority of dBase users to some other of its product.\n\nThis is my two cents worth. Feel free to agree or disagree with my\n\nopinions.\n\nJamDown Dread\n\nAs much as I hate to agree in this position I have to say I totally agree\n\nwith what you wrote <g>. The writing has been on the wall for a long\n\ntime. Inprise seems like a company that is floundering and the way they\n\nhave been chopping and changing their strategies it seems they are in\n\ntheir death throes.\n\nPutting all their eggs in a Java basket could really hasten their demise\n\nin my opinion. I don't think Java is living up to it's initial potential.\n\nI know that if I go to my technical bookstore, maximum discounted Java\n\nmanuals are sitting in a pile like unwanted children.\n\nIMO there is NO way that they can get rid of 20% of staff and leave any\n\nresources for further development of VdB. Who ever would authorise this\n\nwould have to be mucho macho IMO and the current climate in Inprise would\n\nsuggest that mucho machoness would be very unwise. <g>\n\nAnyhow they need a big kick in the rear end for starting this Interbase\n\nBS and keeping us in the dark for six months. That should have been\n\ncleared up one way or another ages ago even if they admitted that they\n\ndidn't have a clue what they were doing <g>.\n\nI think the best that can happen is that someone outside takes VdB over\n\nbut once again I wouldn't hold my breath. Call me cynical but the last\n\nsix months have been farcical and falling for more rumours that VdB is\n\nbeing resurrected by Inprise/Borland would be just silliness.\n\nJust my opinion.\n\nRegards,\n\nVic\n\nIn article <36B674DD...@home.com>, rsaul...@home.com says...\n\n>\n\n> With no new information about dBase and months of unfulfilled promises\n\n> of some kind of announcement, materializes one is left ponder the future\n\n> of Visual dBase.

I would suggest that these billions\n\nof lines of code gets rewritten rather than converted.

How long people will wait in silence without\n\none official peep from a company on where there development tools that\n\nthey rely for their livelyhood are going. Last June or whenever the big\n\nannouncement was made re Interbase it seemed like something would happen.\n\nIf it was predicated back then that there would not be ONE official word\n\nand by January 99 things would even be more unclear than then, I'm sure\n\nthe majority would have said that they would walk. But instead here we\n\nare advising each other to be patient and the 'sun will shine in our back\n\ndoor some day'. Meanwhile a deafening silence from Inprise/Borland,\n\nInterbase or whoever. I may be sensitive but I take it as an affront to\n\nmy intelligence to be left in the dark for so long. Go to the Delphi NGs\n\nand the other Borland tools NGs right now and the Borland spin doctors\n\nare falling over each other to put a positive spin on things and placate\n\nthe masses. Not one little peep on here on what may or may not happen. It\n\nis to Borland's advantage to drag this out for as long as possible. As\n\nlong as no one makes a big noise they can still make some revenue and\n\npossibly if they try and sell VdBase in the future it can be shown that\n\nthere is still a market.\n\n>\n\n> If I have the choice, I would rather see Inprise use their limited resources\n\n> to make a better VdB than loosing their time talking about it.\n\nWell that's great. I bet you anything you like that is Inprise's\n\npreferred choice as well (Not having to lose time talking about it that\n\nis <g>). My choice would be to be told what is going on if anything and\n\nif no forseeable future move on.\n\nI'm curious on how long the majority on these NGs will stick it out\n\nwithout some official sense of direction on whether VdBase has some\n\nfuture. Another month, three, six I don't know. Borland has really jumped\n\nin on any negative feedback on other NGs but here I guess they don't have\n\nto worry. Everyone is too civilised and calm <g>. These NGs might be used\n\nto more advantage by kicking up some dust IMO instead of discussing\n\nrumours every few weeks on the next big development that never get\n\nofficial sanction. And stirring the pot has helped get some reaction on\n\nthe other NGs regardless of what people may think. It may be argued that\n\nthe responses may be just a lot of blah blah blah but it's still a lot\n\nmore than what we have here.\n\n> Am I outrageous enough?\n\nMinor league compared to Inprise management IMO.;-)\n\nRegards,\n\nVic\n\nIn an e-mail posted from Argentina, Jose Fitanovitch from Argentina asked\n\nme, 2 weeks ago, what I was thinking about the future of Visual dBase. Since\n\nit is precisely the title of this thread, this is what I replied:\n\nWhen dBase for Windows 5.0 was released, everybody agreed: it was an\n\nextraordinary piece of technology, released too late. All other releases\n\nsince are based on this solid ground.\n\nVdBase 7.x is a turning point. OODML is a radical departure from the\n\ntraditional dBase language. Inprise forced dBase programmers to take this\n\nnew road to bring us elsewere, to bring us on new grounds.\n\nMore precisely, they gave VdBase to Interbase with the goal to bring VdBase\n\non the ground Interbase is very good at: making computers from different\n\nplatforms, computers using different database softwares, speaking together.\n\nWe all know it: the Internet is a giant pot of gold. VdBase must become\n\n_the_ data publishing software on the Internet. If you allow me to\n\nspeculate, I believe that the next version of VdB will be a clear step in\n\nthat direction. But not _the_ final step. Retroactively, all changes made\n\ninto version 7 will appear logical. (SQL, OODML, etc.). If someone wants to\n\nbet on this, I am ready to travel anywhere to make excuses on my knees if I\n\nam wrong. But if you loose, be prepared to come in Montréal offering your\n\nexcuses to me (our winters are very, very cold...).\n\nInprise is only a small warrior in a technological war. Their strengh is a\n\nsolid technology. Their luck is the mediocre technology in Access.\n\nThe future of VdB is us, programmers. If we roll up our sleeves and create\n\nprograms based of this solid technology, the future is bright. If we keep\n\ncomplaining about how imperfect this World is, then VdB will be like Apple\n\nbefore the return of Steve Jobs.\n\n\n\n\"Romain Strieff [TeamB]\" wrote:\n\n> I and 99.5% of the population consider COBOL dead since 20 years,\n\n> nonetheless all my banks use it and hire cobol programmers. <G>\n\n>\n\nI'll agree with that and even though I consider Dbase to be dead that\n\ndoesn't mean I and other users still won't continue to use it. I just don't see\n\nwhy Inprise would waste resources they don't have on a product that isn't\n\nselling, regardless of how we may feel about it. Obviously Inprise feels the same\n\nway since they have putting zero resources into Dbase for quite awhile now. Its\n\nnot about if Dbase is a good or bad product, it's about profit. Inprise like most\n\ncompanies is in business to make money if they aren't making money on a product\n\nline then they have to decide how to make it profitable or cut it. If Dbase was a\n\nprofitable item I doubt this thread would have ever been here, so the question is\n\n\"fix it or cut it\". Based on Inprise's current situation I can't see them risking\n\nmore money to try to make it profitable.I understand the fact that Dbase\n\nprogrammers may not like this decision but how many Dbase programmers do you\n\nthink would drop Dbase if they found another language that they could make more\n\nmoney in. Just comparing the number of posts on these newgroups to two years ago\n\nshould tell you how many people already jumped ship.\n\n> > Inprise would be\n\n> > foolish to waste resources on Vdbase, I don't claim to have the figures but\n\n> > how much money do you think they lost on Vdbase7.\n\n> ---\n\n> None, they gained million bucks every year, because dBasers buy dBase.\n\n>\n\nAlthough, I could believe Inprise sold a million dollars worth of Vdbase7\n\n(hell 5000 upgrades at $200 per is a million).

With no marketing, Inprise sells a large number of copies of\n\nthis software.\n\nWill Inprise release an upgrade to VdB 7.01 or is VdB a dead end? The answer\n\nis obvious. Inprise will offer an upgrade because it needs money. In this\n\nbusiness, if you don't sell software, you don't get money. Unless there is\n\nsuddenly an infatuation for VdB, the only way to sell more copies, is to\n\noffer upgrades to your customer base. And it is easy to offer upgrades\n\nbecause even if VdB is an outstanding piece of technology, there is still\n\nroom for amelioration.\n\nOODML is a work in progress. The 7.01 upgrade gave us the rowset.findKey()\n\nmethod. For this amelioration alone, this upgrade was indispensable. I\n\nwouldn't be surprised to see Inprise offering us a _useful_ rowset.rowNo(),\n\na rowset.fields[\"nField\"].sum() and .average(), in the near future.\n\nAnd frankly, if Inprise would offer to its programmers, some extraordinary\n\nnew tools to help us publish data on the Internet, would you resist and say\n\nno? Certainly not me. And certainly not the majority of us reading this NG.\n\nThe message I published earlier at 13:53 seems a little bit speculative at\n\nfirst sight. But if you read the lines published one hour later by Alan\n\nKatz:\n\n> There's not a reason in the world why an industry hungry\n\n> for fast, dependable, easy tools to develop the millions\n\n> of Web and Windows applications that will be required\n\n> for the e-commerce and e-business revolution won't\n\n> jump at one of the best technologies in the world.\n\nyou will have a glimpse of what, I think, Inprise have in stock for us.\n\n\n\nPeter give me a break,\n\nDo you honestly really truely expect that anything we say on this forum\n\nwill make the slightest difference to the outcome at this stage .\n\nI tell you what is worse on this forum than spelling out a few home\n\ntruths and surmising the future. The fact that many people have been led\n\naround for so long on this NG expecting something positive by rumours\n\netc. and putting there arses on the line regarding VisualDbase all for\n\nzilch.\n\nJust saying that VdB is going to survive will not make it survive. The\n\nrumours and empty promises regarding VdB have done more damage to the\n\nusers of VdB than any of what you call 'rants' have done.\n\nIf a product is in such a pathetic state that we have to go around saying\n\n'sssshhh don't say anything bad or it might go away', I think it is time\n\nto start looking at alternatives quite frankly.\n\nRegards,\n\nVic\n\nIn article <36B716B4...@InjuryTracker.com>, pe...@InjuryTracker.com\n\nsays...\n\n> JamDown Dread wrote:\n\n>\n\n> > I am not waiting for such an annoucement, I may be wrong but\n\n> > I don't believe there is one forthcoming.

But, in that case, they should sell it to some company\n\nwilling to do it. What is inacceptable in their treatment of us, dBase developpers,\n\nis their decision to keep killing dBase by not supporting it nor selling it.\n\nJust my 2 cents...\n\nA.A.Katz (Alan) wrote:\n\n> I don't believe anyone has ever lost a dime on any version of dBASE.

Innovation is what what American's do best. I\n\nsuspect that the R&D you are talking about has to do with the materialist\n\nsuperstitions of the industrial revolution (i.e. manufacturing). An in\n\nterms of manufacturing, the US is still, by far, the most productive (in\n\nterms of personal productivity) and the only country that is even within\n\nspitting distance of the US is not Japan and not Switzerland, it is Canada\n\n(whose personal productivity in the manufacturing sector is about 93% of the\n\nUS's. Japan is 86% and Switzerland is 71%).\n\nArguably, the primary areas of innovation are all coming from the US. The\n\nInternet is many times bigger in the US than anywhere else. There are\n\ncertainly global elements to this innovation, primarily in the manufacturing\n\nand design segments, but the engine for the innovation is the healthy\n\nAmerican economy and, to a lesser degree, the European economy.\n\nYou make a good point about the legal system here, but you have to realize\n\nthat the by-product of all this litigation are safe products. The cost is\n\nhigh, but so is the value. Our job is keep the costs in line with the\n\nbenefits.\n\nOr so it seems to me,\n\nGeorge Burt\n\nCouldn't agree with you less :-)\n\nI program in a number of languages (including some, like Clipper that have come and\n\ngone).\n\nAnd, IMHO, there are unique features to dBASE that are shared only by other\n\nXbase-derivative languages, such as an interactive real-time environment (I spent\n\ntwo hours in the Command Window today testing out an extraordinarily difficult\n\nlooping construct with filters, ranges and the like that would have taken me five\n\ntimes as long if I had to write and compile an application for each test I ran in\n\nthe CW), the VM and tiny executables that deliver blazingly fast CGI, one of the\n\nmost robust data object paradigms in the industry, a stunningly productive\n\nuser-interface (when it gets fixed), incredible back-end performance, native support\n\nfor almost every graphic standard known to humankind :-) and lots more unique\n\nfeatures that I miss every time I dabble in, or start to move projects to another\n\nlanguage out of frustration.\n\nPlus, I find the OOP model in VdB superior to all the other OOP models (I'm partial\n\nto the dynamic object model).\n\nTo be quite honest, I can't give it up. I'm hooked! :-)\n\nAnd, perhaps more important, many of us have a long-term investment in our\n\nknowledgebase and object libraries and legacy code that we'd be loathe to give up.\n\nAnd as far as I can see at the moment, I don't think any of us will have to give it\n\nup.\n\nSo, before you cry \"doom and gloom\" and \"everyone should switch to Delphi or\n\nDataFlex\" (DataFlex - are they still around? Worked with their first Windows version\n\nand it was an extraordinary dog, IMHO :-)\n\nEveryone should just chill out for a few more days and let's see what happens. I've\n\nnever misled the dBASE community as a member of TeamB or as editor of the Web\n\nmagazine. I promise you, I wouldn't be posting \"false hope\" at this late date and\n\nrisking my hard-earned reputation.\n\nPotentially terrific things are happening behind the scenes. We'll just have to hang\n\nin a little bit longer to see if they come to fruition. And we can all hope they\n\nwill.....\n\nKen Rinaman wrote:\n\n\n\n> trying to push Pascal as the greatest language every written, I am just trying\n\n> to figure out why Dbase users seem to despise it so much.
