        "text": "Success\n\nWhat is success? Does becoming rich make one successful? How about earning a degree from an ivy league or even winning a lottery? How about building a drinking water well in your village? Is it success? Success means an accomplishment of an aim or purpose. Success doesn’t necessarily turn one into rich. It turns one into an accomplished person. If someone is successful, does it means she is intelligent? Having intelligence would definitely help. Intelligence is our ability to acquire a skill or knowledge and apply it. Even awareness that one is not intelligent helps her achieve her goal and hence be successful. such awareness helps her bring people more smarter than her on board.\n\nImage Source: ‪theimpactnews.com\n\nOne neither need to be intelligent nor needs to be entrepreneurial to accomplish her goal. All IITians are highly intelligent by the virtue of their admission into these ivy leagues of India. Does it mean, IITians have greater success? You may say 13 IITians run India’s billion-dollar startups. Yes, those 13 IITians have accomplished their goals. It doesn’t make a non-IITian working for a non-profit less successful. The sense of achievement one gets after she meets her goal or purpose makes her successful. It is not relative and is very subjective. Success is not a quantitative number but a qualitative feeling. One may see you as highly successful but if you feel internally miserable, then you are not successful yet.\n\nIITian or not, Unicorn or not, Startup founder or not, if one can hit the bed with the feeling of a sense of achievement and fulfilment of her goal, she is successful. She may wake up the next day with a new goal and chase it. Success is a continuous process. Success begets success. One goal leads to the next. Don’t quantify your success with the success of others. Instead, question the goal you have set for yourself first. Sometimes, there is a success remorse. After accomplishing what she wanted, when she looks back, if she finds the journey was not worthy of her time, then it would be too late.\n\nSuccess will come. Success will come to you, your driver, that poor boy on the street side. The question one needs to ask is “what goal shall I choose?”. I read a story where a poor protagonist visits a filthy rich estate and sets his goal to build an estate much filthier than that. In the end, he achieved the goal he has set for himself. The story ends where the protagonist sits in the middle of his mile-long estate as a very lonely person sans smile in his face.\n\nFirst, choose the right goal or purpose. This is a crucial step. Choose a goal worthy of you. Value is the key here. Then give your best and reach the goal. Cherish the success thoroughly on the day you achieve it and wake up the next day morning with a newer goal. With each success, make sure your happiness quotient goes higher and higher. What defines happiness is an entirely new topic for another day.\n\nA Versatile Entrepreneur…\n\nAn hour into the conversation with Suresh Challa, I wondered to myself, “how can he be in a perfect storm, every time?” It may have been coincidence or pure timing, but every time Suresh started a new venture, he found himself in a perfect storm.\n\nHe knew how to navigate his entrepreneur-ship out of those storms and into blue oceans. When he returned to India in 1989 the first time, India was going through the storm of twin deficits at that time. Right in the turbulence, Suresh took Asian Coffee Limited, a pioneer in coffee exports, public in 1991, and successfully exited it to the Tata’s in 1993.\n\nSoon after, back in the Silicon Valley to start Post Modern Computing, which went public on Nasdaq in 1996 as Visigenic at a $120 million valuation, later acquired by Borland. He ventured into health-tech to found Neotrax, that automated personal health records. Once again he navigated it through the dotcom bubble and exited successfully in 2003. Forget top business schools, Suresh didn’t even have an MBA degree. Yet, he mastered “Start, Scale, Succeed and Exit” mantra by learning on the go.\n\nSuresh’s business acumen is exemplary, and he prefers an uncluttered life. Spending time between Orange county and Hyderabad, Suresh is on a mission to visit 100 countries, he is 10 shy. When not traveling, he spends his free time honing his only passion – golf.\n\nCurrent Engagements:\n\n– SSPDL Ventures Pvt Ltd, part of SSPDL Group, a construction services and Real Estate company.\n\n– Vista Pearson school (under Pearson management) is into K-12 education\n\n– Fortune Biotech manufactures neem-based bio-organic pesticides.\n\nStartup portfolio: Invested in 15 startups including GreyCampus, Thrillophilia, India Money, Pathasala and more.\n\nFamily: Wife Sridevi is a homemaker and Suresh is proud that she brought up the kids very well. His daughter, Sandhya, is an architect based in Orange county, California. Suresh said happily, “she is a dream child. Not a single day or moment that I recall where we were concerned about her. Sandhya is very mature and exactly knows what she wants.” His son Sanjay goes to University of California at Irvine.\n\nSuresh Challa was born and brought up in Hyderabad to parents who hailed from Anantapur. His dad served as the chief justice in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh. After schooling at St. Paul’s and mechanical engineering from JNTU Hyderabad in ’82, he earned his masters in 1984 in Industrial Engineering from University of Texas, Austin.\n\nAfter landing in USA\n\n“When I landed in USA, after the first semester, I wanted to earn money and pay for myself. I joined a bookstore. My job was to refurbish old books. We worked so hard that we completed a six-week job in three weeks and we got fired. I chose to work as a janitor for the remaining three weeks. Instead of mopping the floor, I left puddles all over and got an earful from the supervisor.”\n\n“My first job was at National Semiconductor (now Texas Instruments). The first day was into fabrication and I was given a toolkit and made me an apprentice under a technician for six months. That technician was reluctant to share his knowledge with me as I was a high-paid engineer. I took a graveyard shift to work with the night-shift technician who was more helpful.”\n\nStory of Asian Coffee\n\nSuresh’s brother started Asian Coffee, manufacturing instant coffee in India and he was persuaded into joining the company. Asian was the first coffee company to export soluble instant coffee. India grows both globally popular flavours – Robusta and Arabica. Asian processed green coffee and was a 100% export oriented unit, globally supplying coffee to companies like Nestlé. The company grew rapidly and went public in 1991 and was eventually acquired by what is now known as Tata Coffee 1993 at a valuation of Rs.190 crores, 5 times the top line. Tatas and ITC got into a bidding war, which helped a higher valuation, resulting on one of the first Indian exits. People didn’t know one can exit a business and move on for good reason.\n\nBack to USA again\n\nPost the sale of Asian Coffee, Suresh went back to the US and started Post Modern Computing (PMC) with a childhood friend Prasad to develop components for application interoperability using C++. PMC talked to systems at the app level instead of TCP level. We created a library that helped us customize applications for interaction. Two of the co-founders were Stanford grads. Suresh led the business development among the four founders, the other three being quintessential techies.\n\nWhile they figured out how to get there, CORBA had emerged as an interoperability solution. “I would go to the Stanford library to search for communications related information in those pre-internet days.” Information superhighway was coming and Post Modern Computing positioned themselves as the “on-ramp” to the information superhighway. “I began to write spam emails to influential people from the Stanford library as there was limited email service.” He connected with Iridium Communications, a Motorola company and the world’s first satellite communications company, through a professor at the University of Arizona.\n\n“They wanted to visit us, seven of them, but we were working out of an office for four. So booked a conference in Palo Alto community center. The meeting lasted all day. We gave solutions to whatever problems they threw at us. Our licensing model was per user and the opportunity was huge.”\n\n“Towards the end of the meeting, they asked us our views on CORBA, we bragged that we were better. That lost the deal for us. They instead chose to go to Dublin to meet with Iona Technologies who had a CORBA-based product.” Motorola focused on standards and chose Iona. “If we had agreed to work with CORBA, that contract was ours,” Lessons learned.\n\nOne of the founding Java software developers was a good friend of a co-founder and that helped Prasad port the C++ code to Java, creating the first Java ORB in the market. Post Modern Computing got a lot of attention in universities as we gave away free licenses.\n\n“Distributed Object Technologies were very new, but ours was easier to work with.” The CORBA version was called Orbilean and the Java version BlackWidow. Blackwidow became popular at an event organised by the Object Management Group. “They created a game that players could start in one booth and continue to play at another booth and so on. We were the hub.”\n\nNetscape was the rising star in 1994 and Marc Andreesson looked to acquire Post Modern Computing and offered to buy it $14 million. “When Netscape embedded our ORB in their browser, we got the maximum visibility. Informix was keen to acquire us.\n\nWe still had just five people.”\n\nWhile talking to a senior executive at Informix, he figured Netscape was likely to acquire Post Modern Computing. Informix offered $17 million in cash to acquire the company. “We hired Hambrecht & Quist as our investment banker, who advised us to play big and introduced Visigenic, founded by Roger Sippl, who also founded Informix and Vantive Software.”\n\nVisigenic sold ODBC drivers after buying licenses from Microsoft and built a huge team. They had everything except a product and we had the product. Roger valued Post Modern Computing at $30 million and offered to merge with Visigenic to create a $90 million company. “We wanted cash, but he convinced us and took the company public in August 1996 at valuation of $120 million. The world had begun to move to web servers and Visigenic was acquired by Borland.”\n\nTip: When there is a buyer, find out who else is interested. Then things move really fast. Always have a competing bidder.\n\nPersonalMD\n\nHuge opportunities were emerging with the Internet, but there weren’t enough smart people. The outsourcing boom had begun. Around this time, Suresh was offered an opportunity by his president at Borland (Inprise), Mark Hansen to provide support services, which prompted Suresh to become – Inprise’s consulting arm and founded Neotrax to focus on healthcare technology. “Our first large project was for Kaiser Permanente to unify the clinical information of all their customers. We offered to build a connect between different sets of information, but they wanted to build it on their own. This got him interested in medical records, and Neotrax created a medical information portal called PersonalMD.\n\nPersonalMD was the first online system that allowed an individual to take control of “his/her” medical records by “having the ability to access his/her medical records anywhere in the world and the best part was they could access their records even if they didn’t have any internet connection – all within a few seconds with the help of an automated system”.\n\nPersonalMD offered data services to insurance companies. “An interesting anecdote made us popular. We got a call from a person in Atlanta who told us we had saved his life. He met with an accident. The EMT used the victim’s Personal MD card and accessed the records. The EMT guy gave a TV report mentioning how PersonalMD helped save the victim. EHG, an insurance company that focuses on insuring fortune 500 executives acquired Neotrax in 2003 post the dot-com bust. “The system still exists. Some of my employees still work there.\n\nSuresh was an early investor in Vijay and Vishal Sikka’s company called iBrain software. Vishal was 27 when Suresh invested $75,000 in the company.\n\nInteresting fact: “One investor told us that consulting revenue was a distraction. I will fuel you but you do innovation. Then the same investor flipped on us.”\n\nBhat: What would be your lifelong dream?\n\nSuresh: Be a happy guy. I have done moderately well in financial stability. Relations matter to me the most. At this point in life, I am living the dream. The ability to do what you want to do when you want to do. I am doing that just now. I am blessed that I could do it now. Things fell in right place very early in my life so I could do what I am doing today.\n\nBhat: If you are stranded on an island, what two things would you take with you?\n\nSuresh: Fishing rod and golf club.\n\nBhat: What compliments do people give you the most?\n\nSuresh: “I smile a lot” is what people say.\n\nBhat: What have you done that you are most proud of?\n\nSuresh: All the companies i have built are still in existence and are doing well.\n\nBhat: Leader or a follower?\n\nSuresh: More of a leader. I don’t follow others in doing things, in that sense.\n\nBhat: Define happiness?\n\nSuresh: Ability to do what you want to do when you want to do.\n\nBhat: When was the last time you laughed out loud?\n\nSuresh: Every day. As early as yesterday, I had a good time with my childhood friend and reminisced past experiences and had great time.\n\nBhat: Four things you would change about yourself?\n\nSuresh: I wish I could learn new skills at this time. I am having hard time. Better public speaking. I wish I picked golf early, something that looks very simple but is frustratingly hard.\n\nBhat: What is the first thing you think of in the morning?\n\nSuresh: Things do for the day come to my mind. Read three newspapers for couple of hours.\n\nBhat: What will you never do?\n\nSuresh: I never talk behind people’s back.\n\nBhat: Who instilled in you to go big?\n\nSuresh: My dad was a huge influence. Humble background of farming “family”. He was a self-made man – became a leading lawyer and went on to become the Chief Justice of AP”\n\nBhat: The next big thing?\n\nSuresh: Way of living. Designer drugs, 3D printing, how we manage our free time and virtual world.\n\nBhat: What do you fear the most?\n\nSuresh: Political environment not just within India but globally.\n\nBhat: One final message for first-time entrepreneur.\n\nSuresh: Have the risk taking appetite. Don’t shy away from failure. Product is only 30%, selling is 50% and finances are 20%. Stop polishing that apple. Take it to the market. Bring complimentary teams."
