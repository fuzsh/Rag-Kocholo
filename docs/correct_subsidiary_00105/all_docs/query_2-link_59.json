        "text": "AMID the generally enthusiastic reception for Bank of Ireland's recent sparkling set of interim results, Goodbody stockbrokers stand out as the only major Dublin-based brokerage not to issue a strong buy recommendation.\n\nCynics may argue that this reflects to some degree the fact that Goodbody is owned by the bank's arch rival AIB. But that viewpoint would do little justice to analyst Oliver O'Shea's central argument, an argument which in fairness he has been making for well over a year.\n\nWhile most commentaries have highlighted the impact on Bank of Ireland's earnings potential of continued domestic margin pressure (as interest rates converge ahead of EMU) and the loss of non-sterling related foreign exchange revenue, these challenges will be faced by all the major banking institutions.\n\nWhat concerns O'Shea in general terms is what he sees as Bank of Ireland's strategic focus on the UK market as a priority area for future development.\n\nHis specific concern centres on the fact that through its recent Â£600m acquisition of the Bristol & West building society and its declaration that it is seeking other building societies to acquire, the bank is placing a significant amount of its eggs in a sector where competitive pressures on margins are likely to get more intense.\n\n``B&W, which will account for 23pc of the group's pre-tax profits in 1998, currently holds approximately 2.5pc of the outstanding mortgage asset in the UK. By any standards this is a very low share in a consolidating market where the cost of establishing a significant presence is very high relative to its resources,'' he notes.\n\n``More particularly, we have already warned of the potential for those institutions which have committed themselves to remain as mutuals to substantially reduce their margins and take a significantly increased share of the commoditised mortgage and savings market.\n\n``The recent September net lending data released for the UK, which excluded the converted societies from the mutual sector for the first time, showed the remaining mutuals which represent 25pc of all outstanding mortgage loans, taking 60pc of incremental net lending.'' The Goodbody report also points out that the remaining UK mutuals are likely to try to further enhance their attraction for consumers and boost their market share, by sacrificing their net interest margins to reduce mortgage lending rates and raise deposit rates.\n\nAverage net interest margins in the sector now lie between 1.3pc and 1.9pc. O'Shea feels the British building societies can actually reduce this margin to 1.1pc and still survive.\n\nHe acknowledges that if the key remaining building society in Britain, the Nationwide converted to a bank in the future, then the mutual sector could be fatally undermined thus changing the overall market.\n\nHe also argues there seems very little potential downside risk to the Bank of Ireland's overall earnings outlook. He's just not as optimistic as his peers about its projected rate of growth. For the year to March 1999, he predicts eps of 69.2p; Riada forecast 72.2p and NCB 72.5p.\n\n******************\n\nINTEREST in shares in Irish technology company Iona may increase on the back the acquisition of one of its major competitors.\n\nWhile analysts say there is little likelihood of Iona management selling out in the next three years, the takeover by Borland International of Visigenic Software for Â£69m has raised the possibility that Iona could be acquired.\n\nBoth Visigenic and Iona operate in the `object middleware' market which makes different software programmes compatible with each other.\n\nThis is a fast growing sector and there has been speculation that big computer corporations are keen to move into the area.\n\nAlva DeVoy, an analyst with Goodbody Stockbrokers, said the Visigenic deal made Iona ``look more positive as a take-over prospect'' in the long term.\n\nThis week Iona's shares pushed ahead strongly and gained $3 to close at $17.68 on the Nasdaq market last night.\n\nNCB has recommended Iona as a ``buy'' and forecast that the pretax profits would rise from $8.7m to the year ened December 1997 and increase to $18.3m the following year. Analyst Enrique Curran forecasts earnings per share will be $.37 for the current financial year and $.74 for 1998.\n\n*******************\n\nTHE Irish stock market yesterday rose modestly, and like the London market, it was encouraged by a rebound in Asian markets. The ISEQ index rose up 0.77pc, or 28.45 points, to close at 3741.\n\n``We've seen reasonable two-way trade in the banks and Anglo-Irish Bank is slightly higher ahead of next week's results, but the rest of the leaders are a little flat,'' a dealer said. ``We're still waiting for recent nervousness to ease.''\n\nIn London, the FTSE 100 rose to finish 0.65pc down from an earlier high as Wall Street pulled back from an expected firm opening. Markets were reassured by a jump in the Hang Seng index which was up over 5pc.\n\nAIB rose 3p to close at 590p, CRH was up 5p at 775p and Greencore gained 4p to finish at 313p.\n\nAnglo Irish Bank rose 4p to 118p ahead of full year results next Tuesday, which are expected to be ahead of forecasts. Some sources said pre-tax profits may be as high as Â£33m. Recently floated Marlborough International rose by 2p to close at 117p, and Independent Newspapers rose by 5pc to close at 370p."
