        "text": "Diva for Java provides Java developers with class and project management capabilities, and creates both applets and standalone applications. According to Jim Friskel, QOI’s founder and CEO. “Diva has many advantages, one of which is that it is a standalone environment. Since it is not an add-on to an existing IDE, it has very little overhead. The entire product compresses down to under a half of a meg.”\n\nAvailable for Windows 95 and Windows NT, Diva for Java is priced at 9. Details are available at QOI’s web site: http://www.inch.com/~friskel/. –Max Airborne\n\nBlackWidow lets applets talk to CORBA objects\n\nMarch 8 — Post|Modern Computing has announced the availability of the BlackWidow Java Object Request Broker. The beta version of BlackWidow can be downloaded and used freely from https://www.pomoco.com.\n\nBlackWidow is a complete CORBA 2.0-compliant implementation written in Java, providing full client- and server-side functionality. Since the ORB runtime is written completely in Java, applets using BlackWidow can be downloaded into a Java-enabled Web browser (such as Navigator 2.0) and can communicate with any other CORBA 2.0-compliant object running anywhere on the Internet or within an intranet.\n\nBlackWidow uses the Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (IIOP) as its on-the-wire format, allowing any client or server object written in Java to interoperate with any CORBA 2.0-compliant objects. For example, a Java client can talk to a C++ server by using BlackWidow and Post|Modern’s C++ ORB, ORBeline 2.0. Or a Smalltalk client can communicate with a Java server by using a commercially available Smalltalk ORB. BlackWidow objects can run on Windows 95, Windows NT, Mac OS, Solaris, SGI, and Linux, as well as many other platforms. The BlackWidow development environment is currently supported only on Windows 95, Windows NT, and Solaris. –Kieron Murphy\n\nTeamJava registers experts and enterprises\n\nMarch 8 — TeamJava has announced the availability of its new public registry of consultants and consulting companies specializing in the Java platform. A link to a registration form can be found at Review Registry Questions off of the company’s home page at https://teamjava.com.\n\nTeamJava states, “Our mission is to promote and advance Java and assist Java consultants the world over in locating and completing contract work.” Its site, while quite new, includes registries of individuals and companies, as well as Java FAQ Archives and Java Links. For more information about TeamJava, contact James A. Squires via his Web site at https://www.jas.com or email jas@jas.com. –Kieron Murphy\n\nJAVelin offers graphical development environment\n\nMarch 7 — Step Ahead Software of Sydney, Australia, has released the Java development environment JAVelin. A time-limited evaluation version is available at https://www.ozemail.com.au/~stepsoft.\n\nChris Coleman, Step Ahead’s technical director, said, “The JAVelin tool basically says to developers that this is the ’90s. Java is a ’90s language. Why should you be focused on opening, editing, and closing an unruly bunch of text files when the ’90s focus is on classes?” With JAVelin, the focus is unashamedly on classes — their data and methods and the relationships between classes. All of these are shown graphically in front of the programmer, and access to details such as field types, method codes, and so forth is never more than a few clicks away.\n\nAccording to the company, a built-in, intelligent editor provides editing facilities to modify source code for individual methods. A right-click menu in the editor offers quick access to other components, which can then be pasted directly into the editor to save typing and remembering the names of classes, fields, or methods. At the user’s request, JAVelin will automatically invoke the Java compiler (from Sun) to compile the underlying Java code.\n\n“Practicing what we preach meant applying object-oriented methods to the development of our tool,” said Coleman. “The upshot of this is that incorporating support for the Java language took only about two weeks.”\n\nJAVelin runs on Windows 3.1, Windows 95, and Windows NT. To compile and test code, users will need Sun’s JDK. The full price for JAVelin will be US 99; but as an introductory offer for a short time, the price is 49, including shipping to anywhere in the world. –Kieron Murphy\n\nJava applets worth a look\n\nCreative Media Cauldron (https://www.brainlink.com/~cauldron/) has released a suite of “Plug-in Playlets,” which currently consists of tools for Streaming Animation, Hot Button Panels, Temporal Imagemaps, and Invisible Download.\n\nSteve Christensen’s Java Lava Lamp (https://smc.vnet.net/javalamp.html) is an animation generated with Mathematica and a Java animation applet. Steve provides full details on the Lamp’s creation.\n\nACupOfCoffee to go for NeXT’s InterfaceBuilder\n\nMarch 6 — According to its developer, Ralf Suckow of melonSoft in Berlin, ACupOfCoffee is the first full-featured Java GUI Builder for Sun’s Abstract Windows Toolkit (AWT). Officially out of beta, ACupOfCoffee is implemented as a palette for the NeXTStep InterfaceBuilder. With ACupOfCoffee, users can implement all the features of InterfaceBuilder: drag and drop of components and their parts; direct manipulation of component attributes; alignment of functions; individual object inspection; creation of customized palettes of frequently used arrangements; and so forth. ACupOfCoffee turns InterfaceBuilder into a native Java AWT development tool that offers WYSIWYG interface design capabilities.\n\nSuckow said, “The unique, flexible architecture of NeXT’s InterfaceBuilder allows full customization for the Java AWT. You arrange a UI for Java applets with full comfort. Also, ACupOfCoffee supports the interaction between the user interface and your application objects. It generates variables that allow you to access the interface objects, as well as generates an event handler that will call your application object methods in response to user actions.”\n\nACupOfCoffee is available via anonymous ftp at ftp://next-ftp.peak.org/pub/next/submissions/aCupOfCoffee.1.0.NIHS.tar. gz. It is free for any noncommercial use. For more information, contact Ralf Suckow at suckow@contrib.de. –Kieron Murphy\n\nLow-cost Java processors cast Sun technology in silicon\n\nMarch 13 — In an effort to extend their reach into the low-cost consumer and enterprise marketplace, Sun Microelectronics (formerly SPARC Technology Business), a division of Sun Microsystems Inc., announced last month a microprocessor family optimized for Java. With estimated application performance many times that of general purpose processors at a fraction of the cost, Sun Microelectronics officials claimed, the new class of low-cost Java processors will lead to a networked microprocessor market topping 5 billion by the year 2000.\n\n“Java software, Java processors and Java systems are central to Sun’s inter- and intranet strategy,” said Scott McNealy, chairman and CEO of Sun Microsystems, Inc. “Creating low-cost Java processors will take this powerful technology directly to the consumer, and takes the consumer directly into the new paradigm of network computing.”\n\nSun plans to offer a full range of Java-optimized component- and board-level products. According to Chet Silvestri, president of Sun Microelectronics, Sun will license the technology to third party developers “who can embed the technology into the wide range of products that will be enabled by the rapid growth of the internet and Java.”\n\n“Industry analysts estimate that the overall microprocessor and microcontroller market will top 0 billion by the year 1999,” stated Rajesh Parekh, Sun Microelectronics’ Embedded Products Group vice president and general manager. “Today the average business person [utilizes] more than 10 microcontrollers. By 1999, the average home will contain between 50 and 100 microcontrollers. And worldwide there will be more than 145 million cellular phone users — each with at least one microcontroller. The result? Millions of cellular phones, security systems, entertainment systems, low-cost network terminals, and other internet appliances operating within a network and highly optimized for small applications or applets running at top speed. We believe our Java processors can provide a more optimum solution in a quarter of these applications.” –Max Airborne\n\nMany Java and JavaScript security issues remain unsolved\n\nJava and JavaScript continue to be plagued with the discovery of security flaws. Most recently, Lincoln Stein, MIT Genome Center’s director of informatics, documented a bug in JavaScript, a series of HTML extensions native to Netscape 2.0. The bug allows private information, such as a user’s email address, to be gathered and sent along with data submitted in an on-line form, without the knowledge of the user.\n\nStein is the author of the WWW Security FAQ, available at\n\nhttp://ww w-genome.wi.mit.edu/WWW/faqs/www-security-faq.html. According to Stein, the best way to avoid JavaScript security bugs is to “use Netscape 1.1 or another vendor’s browser.” Stein also emphasizes that turning off Java in Netscape’s Security Preferences dialog box has no effect on JavaScript.\n\nOther bugs in JavaScript have been documented. One tracks a user’s browsing activity and sends a report back to a remote server, and another allows JavaScript to gather and transmit recursive directory listings of a user’s local disk and any network disks that are mounted.\n\nSeveral days prior to Stein’s discovery, computer scientists at Princeton University uncovered a problem with the Netscape 2.0 implementation of Java. The flaw involves the Java Applet Security Manager, which, after DNS subversion, allows an “attacker” applet to connect to the victim’s machine after they’ve downloaded an “innocent” applet. The attacker applet then proceeds to attack the victim’s machine or, in a more sophisticated implementation, all the machines in the victim’s local network. According to the Princeton report (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/ ~ddean/java/), the victim’s firewall is helpless to prevent the attack and, in effect, “the attacker causes the victim’s web browser to attack the victim’s own machines.”\n\nNetscape has issued a patch that solves the Java problem, which users can read about and download at\n\nhttp://home.n etscape.com/newsref/std/java_security.html. –Max Airborne\n\nHere’s a related article published February 26 in JavaWorld‘s sister publication, Macworld Online: “Bug in Java Security Enables Malicious Applets to Attack.”\n\nAT&T researchers track favorite Java resources\n\nMarch 8 — A team of AT&T Research employees has been keeping tabs on the most popular subjects on the comp.lang.java newsgroup. Team spokesperson Loren Terveen said, ” We have created Web pages that summarize the most frequently and recently mentioned resources on comp.lang.java during the last few months. This is part of our research in supporting online communities.”\n\nAccording to the team, the top five resources of interest are: Java Programming for the Internet (43); Gamelan (17); Frequently Asked Questions (7); Java and Cosmo Code Development Kits (6); Teach Yourself Java Errata (5), Natural Intelligence Inc. (5), and Java-Linux (5). Links to these and other relevant resources can be found at http://www.phoaks.com/pho aks/comp/lang/java. For more information, contact Loren Terveen at terveen@research.att.com. –Kieron Murphy\n\nMitsubishi Electric, NTT Data reveal Java plans\n\nTOKYO, March 8 — Electronics equipment giant Mitsubishi Electric Corp. confirmed today that it will license the Java network programming language. Meanwhile, Japanese systems integrator NTT Data Communications System Corp. has disclosed plans to develop a Java-based data retrieval system. –Rob Guth, IDG News Service\n\nBell Labs developing Java rival\n\nMarch 13 — AT&T’s Bell Laboratories division has spent the last 10 months secretly developing a direct competitor to Java, while leaving other major projects on the back burner. Code-named Inferno, the project has the devotion of much of the Bell Labs team, and Sun has not been invited to collaborate.\n\nInferno was announced somewhat inadvertently by AT&T’s Dennis Ritchie at last month’s UniForum in San Francisco. During a session speech, Ritchie, father of Unix and the C programming language, said he didn’t want to criticize Sun, but feels Java is both becoming unwieldy and doesn’t go far enough, according to a San Jose Mercury News report. Ritchie also suggested that Inferno would be useful for televisions, appliances, and other machines, not just computers.\n\nPanic in the Java community was tempered by several additional facts about the Inferno project. Ritchie admitted that it has not been decided whether Inferno will become a commercial product. But Ritchie said AT&T management has shown a great interest in the project from the beginning, to the point where Inferno development has superseded development of Plan 9, AT&T’s post-Unix operating system on which Ritchie and his team have been working for years. Inferno’s future direction is likely to remain in question pending the AT&T reorganization that recently led to massive layoffs, and the expected transfer of the Inferno team to one of the operations being spun out of AT&T. In addition, AT&T is expected to buy a license for rival Java. –Max Airborne\n\nnone Kieron Murphy is a freelance writer based in New York City.
