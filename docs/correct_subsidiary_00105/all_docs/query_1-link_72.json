        "text": "Othar Hansson: Curriculum Vitae\n\nOthar Hansson is a managing director of Thinkbank, Inc. Prior to co-founding Thinkbank, Othar was VP Research at Heuristicrats Research, Inc.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2001, Othar was also managing director and Principal Developer at WR Hambrecht + Co, LLC, a San Francisco investment bank. Together with the Director of Technology, Othar was responsible for the design, development and deployment of several innovative online securities auctions, including the OpenIPO and OpenBook systems, and he is an inventor on the OpenIPO patent.\n\nOthar's research interests are in core artificial intelligence issues, such as search, problem-solving, constraint-satisfaction and planning. He has worked extensively on planning and scheduling applications for over ten years, and on game theory and auction design for the past five years. For the past year, he has been a Visiting Researcher at CMU working as the Integration Lead for the RADAR project.\n\nOthar has a long history of effective teaching, beginning as an undergraduate at Columbia, where he was a TA and Head TA for 11 courses spanning the full range of computer science. At UC Berkeley, Othar served as TA for the CS150 Digital Design Lab.\n\nWhile a Master's student at UCLA, Othar taught two UCLA Extension courses several times: Introductory AI and an advanced course in Search & Problem Solving. These courses were offered both at UCLA and on-site at companies such as Rockwell, TRW, etc. Othar taught the graduate AI class at USC's Electrical Engineering Department during Summer 1989. Othar taught Berkeley's \"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence\" course (CS188) as a Visiting Lecturer for the spring semester 1997.\n\nCurriculum Vitae\n\nDate of Birth: February 27, 1965\n\nAddress:\n\n881 Markham Terrace\n\nSunnyvale, CA 94086\n\nVoice: 650-906-8642\n\nInternet: OTHAR @ THINKBANK.COM\n\nEducation:\n\nA.
