        "text": "Digital Transformation and emerging technology can be filled with buzzwords and jargon, cut through it all and find the real meaning here. Click here to see how training can help your organisation.\n\nAdvanced Technology\n\nA technology that is still immature but promises to deliver significant value, or that has some technical maturity but still has relatively few users. Among current examples: artificial intelligence, agents, speech and handwriting recognition, virtual reality and 3D visualization, smart cards, real-time collaboration, enhanced user authentication, data mining, and knowledge management.\n\nAgile\n\nAgile is a development approach that delivers software in increments by following the principles of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development.\n\nAlgorithmic Business\n\nAlgorithmic business is the industrialized use of complex mathematical algorithms pivotal to driving improved business decisions or process automation for competitive differentiation.\n\nApplication Programming Interface (API)\n\nAn application programming interface (API) is an interface that provides programmatic access to service functionality and data within an application or a database. It can be used as a building block for the development of new interactions with humans, other applications or smart devices. Companies use APIs to serve the needs of a digital transformation or an ecosystem, and start a platform business model.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) applies advanced analysis and logic-based techniques, including machine learning, to interpret events, support and automate decisions, and take actions.\n\nAugmented Reality (AR)\n\nAugmented reality (AR) is the real-time use of information in the form of text, graphics, audio and other virtual enhancements integrated with real-world objects. It is this “real world” element that differentiates AR from virtual reality. AR integrates and adds value to the user’s interaction with the real world, versus a simulation.\n\nBalanced Scorecard (bsc)\n\nA balanced scorecard (BSC) is a performance measurement and management approach that recognizes that financial measures by themselves are not sufficient and that an enterprise needs a more holistic, balanced set of measures which reflects the different drivers that contribute to superior performance and the achievement of the enterprise’s strategic goals. The balanced scorecard is driven by the premise that there is a cause-and-effect link between learning, internal efficiencies and business processes, customers, and financial results.\n\nBatch Processing\n\nBatch processing is the processing of application programs and their data individually, with one being completed before the next is started. It is a planned processing procedure typically used for purposes such as preparing payrolls and maintaining inventory records.\n\nBehavioral/gestural Analytics\n\nBehavioral/gestural analytics reflects the automated analysis of real-world human activity captured by video systems to track human movement and gestures to assess intentions and to identify specific behaviors.\n\nBenchmarking\n\nBenchmarking is defined as the comparison between vendor performance and designated benchmark organizations or indexes. An index is a publicly available indicator for a factor that is associated with a pricing element.\n\nBest Practice\n\nBest practice is a group of tasks that optimizes the efficiency (cost and risk) or effectiveness (service level) of the business discipline or process to which it contributes. It must be implementable, replicable, transferable and adaptable across industries.\n\nBeta Testing\n\nBeta testing is the stage at which a new product is tested under actual usage conditions.\n\nBig Data\n\nBig data is high-volume, high-velocity and/or high-variety information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing that enable enhanced insight, decision making, and process automation.\n\nBlockchain\n\nA blockchain is an expanding list of cryptographically signed, irrevocable transactional records shared by all participants in a network. Each record contains a time stamp and reference links to previous transactions. With this information, anyone with access rights can trace back a transactional event, at any point in its history, belonging to any participant. A blockchain is one architectural design of the broader concept of distributed ledgers.\n\nBlog\n\nA blog, which derives from the term “weblog,” is a website designed to make it easy for users to create entries in chronological order. The entries are then displayed in reverse chronological order (most recent entry first) and are generally archived on a periodic basis. Blogs are mostly used to express opinions on topical events such as sports, music, fashion or politics, but in the past three years, they have emerged as established communication channels for businesses as well as individuals. “Microblogging” has emerged via a platform such as Twitter, which not only allows users to write 140-character posts and share them with humanity, but also serves as an impressive news- and taste-sharing vehicle too, because a blog author or journalist can use it to drive awareness of new posts, articles and so on.\n\nBrand Extension\n\nBrand extension is the expansion an existing “house” (or “master”) brand to cover a new category of solution. The brand becomes an umbrella brand for all the company’s offerings. The alternative is to create sub-brands for each individual proposition.\n\nBusiness Application Programming Interface (BAPI)\n\nA Business Application Programming Interface (BAPI) is a set of documented, server-side interfaces to one or more R/3 processes, from SAP. BAPI packages multiple internal functions to enable programmatic access to such higher-order tasks as checking customer numbers, providing product descriptions, selecting products, creating quotations or creating orders.\n\nBusiness Capability Modeling\n\nBusiness capability modeling is a technique for the representation of an organization’s business anchor model, independent of the organization’s structure, processes, people or domains.\n\nBusiness Intelligence (BI) Platforms\n\nBusiness intelligence (BI) platforms enable enterprises to build BI applications by providing capabilities in three categories: analysis, such as online analytical processing (OLAP); information delivery, such as reports and dashboards; and platform integration, such as BI metadata management and a development environment.\n\nBusiness Process\n\nGartner defines business process as an event-driven, end-to-end processing path that starts with a customer request and ends with a result for the customer. Business processes often cross departmental and even organizational boundaries.\n\nBusiness Process Modeling (BPM)\n\nBusiness process modeling (BPM) links business strategy to IT systems development to ensure business value. It combines process/workflow, functional, organizational and data/resource views with underlying metrics such as costs, cycle times and responsibilities to provide a foundation for analyzing value chains, activity-based costs, bottlenecks, critical paths and inefficiencies.\n\nBusiness Process Re-engineering (BPR)\n\nBusiness process re-engineering (BPR) is defined as an integrated set of management policies, project management procedures, and modeling, analysis, design and testing techniques for analyzing existing business processes and systems; designing new processes and systems; testing, simulating and prototyping new designs prior to implementation; and managing the implementation process.\n\nC (Programming Language)\n\nThe C programming language was created by Dennis Ritchie at the former Bell Laboratories in 1972. C provides very precise control of the computer’s operation.\n\nC++\n\nC++ is an extension to the C language defined by Bjarne Stroustrop at Bell Laboratories in 1986. As a superset of C, it provides additional features for data abstraction and object-oriented programming. C++ can be used to develop programs for almost all computers. Together, C and C++ are the among the most common programming languages in use today.\n\nCache\n\nA cache is defined as a temporary storage area for instructions and data near a computer’s central processing unit (CPU), usually implemented in high-speed memory. It replicates information from main memory or storage in a way that facilitates quicker access, using fewer resources than the original source. Because data is closer to the CPU, it can be retrieved more quickly.\n\nCategory Management\n\nPodcast\n\nAudio (or audio and video) content specifically designed for synchronizing and playback on mobile audio players, such as Apple’s iPod and MP3 playback-enabled mobile phones. Much of this content is highly topical, derived from radio or TV broadcasts, and it is often free. Podcasts are an example of “sticky” content: listeners are encouraged to subscribe to a podcast “channel” that typically is updated with new content daily or weekly. See also mobisode.\n\nPoint To Point\n\nDescribes a circuit that connects two points directly, where there are generally no intermediate processing nodes, although there could be switching facilities.\n\nPortal"
