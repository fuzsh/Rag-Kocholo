Borland Software Corporation (formerly Borland International, Inc.) is a software company, located in Austin, Texas, United States. It was founded in 1983 by Niels Jensen, Ole Henriksen, Mogens Glad, and Philippe Kahn.

Borland was born in 1983 when the young Dane Anders Hejlsberg reached an agreement with Philip Khan to sell the Pascal compiler that Anders had created for personal computers. Turbo Pascal was a compiler with an "environment" concept, revolutionary at the time. It cost around US$50 and had exceptional capabilities at the time: it included extensions that eliminated all the drawbacks that caused Brian Kernighan's essay Why Pascal Isn't My Favorite Language. Especially all the limitations to direct memory access and to the machine (embedded assembler).

Borland later released compilers for other languages such as Prolog (Turbo Prolog) and Basic (Turbo BASIC). But the most popular and the one that took root was that of the C programming language, Turbo C. In competition with Microsoft, Borland came to be placed in the top positions in the compiler sector.

It lost that place before Windows 95 came out. The Windows version of Turbo Pascal was considered a good product. But programming for Windows was crying out for a more comfortable environment. Meanwhile, Microsoft was eating up the market with Visual Basic. When Delphi came out in the spring of 1995, it had already lost a lot of ground.

Just as Delphi emerged as the evolution of Turbo Pascal for MS Windows, the same thing happened with Turbo C that gave rise to C++Builder. The company also released JBuilder, a Java IDE (1996).

Several Borland products are also available for GNU/Linux, including Interbase, JBuilder, and Kylix which integrated Delphi and C++Builder (although Kylix was dropped after version 3.0).

In September 2006 the Turbo product range (Turbo C++, Turbo C#, Turbo Delphi) was relaunched, as reduced versions of its flagship tools (Delphi, C++Builder) for Windows

Acquisitions and mergers

In 1991, Borland acquired the Ashton-Tate company, from which it continued to market its flagship products, dBase and Interbase.

Around 1993-94 there were agreements with WordPerfect for cooperation in office automation, jointly marketing their products.

After the purchase of Visigenic (company specialized in CORBA and creator of VisiBroker) in 1997, it changed its name to Inprise.

In 1999 Microsoft made an investment in the company, 2 months after having caused the departure of the main managers of Inprise.

In 2000 there was a failed merger attempt with Corel.

In 2001, Inprise resumed its famed name, since then being called Borland Software Corporation.

On November 14, 2006 the IDEs and compilers department (Borland Developer Tools Group) was separated from Borland forming a new subsidiary (whose sole shareholder was Borland), called CodeGear. Parent company Borland Software Corporation will focus on "application lifecycle management" (Application Lifecycle Management, ALM).

In May 2008 Borland Software Corporation reached an agreement for the sale of CodeGear to Embarcadero Technologies for $23 million.

In May 2009, software developer Micro Focus purchased Borland Software Corporation for $75 million.
