        "text": "L. Sprague de Camp was born 27 November 1907 and died 6 November 2000.\n\nQuotes\n\nIt does not pay a prophet to be too specific.\n\nThere is no mistaking the dismay on the face of a writer who has just learned that his brain child is a deformed idiot.\n\nIn writing a series of stories about the same characters, plan the whole series in advance in some detail, to avoid contradictions and inconsistencies.\n\nThe story of civilisation is, in a sense, the story of engineering – that long and arduous struggle to make the forces of nature work for man’s good.\n\nTherefore, no matter how the world makes out in the next few centuries, a large class of readers at least will not be too surprised at anything. They will have been through it all before in fictional form, and will not be too paralysed with astonishment to try to cope with contingencies as they arise.\n\nL. Sprague de Camp was an American author. He wrote over 100 books, including science fiction and fantasy novels, and works of non-fiction, such as biographies of other fantasy authors. His works include The Compleat Enchanter, H.P. Lovecraft: A Biography, and Lest Darkness Fall. He was a major figure in science fiction in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nSource for image\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:L._Sprague_de_Camp.png\n\nCimon Avaro, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nby Amanda Patterson\n\nAre you interested in more authors’ birthdays?
