        "text": "MOUNTAINSIDE, N.J., July 12—John. W, Campbell, editor of Analog, a leading science fiction and fact magazine, who was also a writer and antholo gist, died, yesterday of a heart ailment at his home, 1457 Or chard Road. His age was 61.\n\nInfluence on the Field\n\n“No other man has had so profound an influence on the development of modern science fiction as John W. Campbell,” the late Anthony Boucher wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1967.\n\nMr. Campbell, he said, “de veloped a truly astounding stable of writers—Robert A. Heinlein, A. E. Van Vogt, L. Sprague de Camp, Theodore Sturgeon, and many others— who brought science fiction out of the era of gadgetry and converged it into a vehicle for mature speculation, not only about science but about peo ple.”\n\n‘Mr. Campbell had been editor of Analog (formerly called As tounding Science Fiction) for 34 years. He began when the mag azine was an adventure pulp and transformed it Into a respected specialized publication with a heavy readership among engi neers and scientists.\n\nHis magazine had won the Hugo award nine times since 1953 as the best science‐fiction magazine of the year. In 1970 Mr. Campbell gained entry into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame, an honor awarded by committee of writers and read ers of science fiction, called First Fandom, for his contribu tions to science fiction.\n\nBefore he became editor in 1937, Mr. Campbell was leading writer of science fic tion. The motion picture, “The Thing From Outer Space,” was made from his 1938 novelette “Who Goes There?”\n\nMr. Campbell, a brawny, crew‐cut, 6‐footer, predicted edi torially in 1939 that atomic energy would come about through the release of the en ergy, in Uranium 235.\n\nPredicted Bigger Bomb\n\nIn 1945, after the United States had dropped its first atom bomb., he predicted that the next big weapon would be powered by hydrogen.\n\nDuring. World War II, his stories on atomic energy were so specific and accurate that the Federal Bureau of Investi gation swooped down on him. They decided, however, to let him continue publishing his predictions since discontinu ance would arouse suspicion.\n\nIn his monthly publication Mr. Campbell offered an edi torial on one of his pet theories, many of which were controversial. A’ favorite sub ject was What he considered so ciety's tendency to subvert democracy by overdoing things.\n\n“Our present cultural pat tern is dominated by the con cepts of ‘togotherness,’ con formity, hyperdemocracy and a general nitwitted ‘everybody's equal to everybody’ philoso phy,” he once wrote. In the evolution of organic life — billion years ago—there was real honest‐to‐God, egalitarian or anization of individuals.\n\nWe call them slime molds; every cell was equal to every other cell. They continue to exist, of course, in out of the way places, under clamp and rotting logs, and so on. But they do not appear to have achieved any notable ac complishment.”\n\nAnother favorite cause was the importance of the amateur. Professional scientists, in his opinion, were apt to think along established lines too often to make break‐throughs in their fields.\n\nMr. Campbell was born in Newark on June 8, 1910, the son of an electrical engineer,) who interested him in science at the age of 3. He attended’ the Massachusetts. Institute of Tech nology and received a B.S. de gree in physics from Duke University.\n\nHe started to write science fiction during the Depression and soon came to the fore front of the field. The result was that when an editor was sought in 1937 for Astounding Stories, a predecessor of Ana log, he got the job.\n\nHe was the author of “The Atomic Story,” an account of the development of atomic en ergy, published in 1947. Annu ally, he anthologized the best stories of Analog.\n\nSurviving are his widow, Margaret; three daughters, Mrs. James Hammond, Mrs. James Randazzo and Mrs. Ian Robert son; a sister, Mrs. William Krieg, and two grandchildren.\n\nA memorial service will be held Wednesday at 11 A.M. at the Gray Funeral Home in Westfield, N.J."
