Items may be reserved for a period not exceeding seven (7) days, pending receipt of payment.\n\nCONDITION: We pride ourselves on the exceptional quality of our stock in terms of �condition�. The vast majority of our books are �very fine� or 'as new'. The qualitative differences of those items that do not conform to the �very fine� criterion are described accurately and in great detail.

We, therefore, urge our customers to use a service of registered mail, with the option of additional insurance, depending on the shipment's value. In March 2014 the 'International Signed For' (registered mail) service - used in connection with overseas surface mail shipments - was withdrawn by the overseas postal authorities, meaning that surface mail shipments can no longer be registered or insured. To enjoy the security of registered/insured mail, the air mail AIRSURE service must be used at the appropriate additional cost. Although air mail is more expensive than surface mail, it is also a great deal safer and faster.\n\nPLEASE NOTE THAT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RECOMMENDATION RECEIVED FROM ABEBOOKS WITH REFERENCE TO THE CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S RETURN POLICY EFFECTIVE 23 JULY, 2015, ALL FUTURE SHIPMENTS FROM US TO DESTINATIONS OUTSIDE THE UK WILL BE SENT BY TRACKED AIR-MAIL AT THE APPROPRIATE EXTRA COST. THE ADDITIONAL POSTAGE WILL BE QUOTED."
