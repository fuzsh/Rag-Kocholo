        "text": "The official film adaptation, this faithful rendition captures the brutality and violence of this classic. Bearing all the hallmarks of Robert E. Howard, the authors have recreated the character with an eye for detail and a deft touch.\n\nAs a huge fan of the 1982 film, this novelisation of the screenplay was a joy to read. Though the language was slightly dated in places, it speaks to that lineage of Howard and all the other authors who have had a hand in shaping Conan. As an origin story, it brilliantly explains what made Conan such a terrifying warrior, not just in physicality but also mentally. Indeed, the opening gambit with his father is crucial to his survival and growth.\n\nBut, when raiders murder his parents and cast him into slavery, it’s Conan’s fury that initially keeps him alive. Working the wheel at a mill, becoming almost superhuman in strength, he attains manhood only to then be sold to a pit fighting master. It’s here he hones his prowess as a warrior until his escape. with his freedom, he really begins to learn, especially from those he encounters. Learning tricks and stealth, as well as caution, from his companion, Subotai, a thief, Conan tempers some of his rage. The adventures the two embark on see them joining another thief, Valeria, to steal a vast jewel from the evil cult of Set.\n\nAll the while though, Conan keeps revenge upon his mind. When he learns that the leaders of the cult are the very same that killed his parents, his tasks are aligned, culminating in a series of brutal and vicious battles. Capturing the cruel and savage nature of this world, where magics exist and monsters roam, Conan the Barbarian is an excellent adaptation. It’s dark and barbaric and, in that, it’s almost a precursor of modern Grimdark fantasy. However, whilst its violent and unforgiving, there’s much to consider as Conan develops, understanding of his father’s words and the importance of forging his will and character even as he wields a sword.\n\nAn almost timeless character, Conan is a relentless force and his adventures are as epic as any fantasy tale told. Fun, fantastical and ferocious, Conan the Barbarian is a quick (potentially nostalgic) and captivating read.\n\nReview copy\n\nPublished by Titan Books"
