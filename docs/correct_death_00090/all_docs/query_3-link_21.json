        "text": "(November 27, 1907 – November 6, 2000)\n\nAn aeronautical engineer by training, Lyon Sprague de Camp took up writing sf and fantasy in the late 1930s and was one of the mainstays of both Unknown and Astounding under Campbell. Lest Darkness Fall, an alternate history novel written in 1939, is considered to be among his best works, as well as one of the best (and earliest) examples of the alternate history genre. Another famous work is The Incomplete Enchanter, written with Fletcher Pratt.\n\nHe married Catherine Crook de Camp in 1939. During World War II, de Camp joined the U.S. Navy Reserve and worked at the Naval Air Experimental Station in Philadelphia, recruited on the recommendation of Robert Heinlein, then a civilian engineer for the military.\n\nAfter the war, he continued to write sf and fantasy, as well as a considerable amount of non-fiction, particularly history. He traveled extensively around the world. He was a member of the Trap Door Spiders and the Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America. He lived in the Philadelphia area for most of his life.\n\nThough not primarily a fan, he was a very fannish pro. He wrote extensively for Amra and was one of the founders of the Hyborian Legion. Along with Fritz Leiber, he helped get Discon I off to a good start (see Discon 1 Guide: The First Day). He was parliamentarian of the WSFS Business Meeting in 1960 (see the meeting minutes from Amra).\n\nTime and Chance, his autobiography, was published in 1996 by Donald M. Grant. It was edited by Catherine Crook de Camp, and dedicated to her. The 444-page book contains 63 photographs in a section titled \"My Photo Album.\" It won the 1997 Best Non-Fiction Book Hugo.\n\nEntry in The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction.\n\n“Veteran of the Day: U.S. Navy Veteran L.
