        "text": "Rodel M. Acdal\n\nActive\n\nPhilippines\n\nBaguio Episcopal Area\n\nBishop Rodel M. Acdal is an active bishop of The United Methodist Church, elected on November 25, 2022, during the Special Session of the Philippines Central Conference held at Wesleyan University-Philippines.<br /> <br /> Prior to his election, Bishop Acdal served as the President of John Wesley College since 2009, Administrative Assistant and Property Development Adviser to the Bishop of the Baguio Episcopal Area, Chairperson of the Division of Ordained Ministry in the Philippines Central Conference, and member of the Board of Trustees of Philippine Christian University, Union Theological Seminary, and the Philippines Central Conference.<br /> ----------<br /> <br /> <strong>Early Life</strong><br /> Bishop Acdal was born in Sanchez Mira, Cayagan, Philippines, and raised by his parents, who are farmers. His ultimate dream during childhood was to become a soldier; however, due to his height, he was unable to pursue it. He may not have become a member of the armed forces, but he answered the call to become God&rsquo;s soldier.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>Education and Ordination</strong><br /> Bishop Acdal holds a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Civil Engineering, a Master of Divinity (MDiv) from Wesley Divinity School, Wesleyan University-Philippines, and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Education major in Education Management from Cagayan State University, Tuguegarao City.&nbsp; He also finished the Haggai Institute Advanced Leadership Training in Maui, Hawaii way back 2015. &nbsp;He was ordained as an Elder on May 1999 by Bishop Daniel Arichea in the Northern Philippines Annual Conference.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>Ordained Ministry</strong><br /> He pastored several local churches in his earlier years of ministry. During his time as Administrative Pastor, there was a notable increase in membership and stability of finances in his church appointments. He ensured that manpower was maximized by actively involving lay people in various church work and activities. The physical structures of the churches where he was appointed were improved, and facilities and equipment were purchased. He was also tapped as a regular speaker and lecturer in different local churches, institutions, and community programs and activities. He actively participated in all church activities and held key positions in the district and conference level. He joined community programs and activities, including ecumenical gatherings and events, and was even elected as President of the Provincial Ecumenical Association of Cagayan. Additionally, Bishop Acdal was consistently elected as a principal delegate to the Central Conference right after his ordination and became a General Conference delegate in May 2008 in Fort Worth, Texas, USA.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>Superintendency</strong><br /> Bishop Acdal was appointed District Superintendent of the South Cagayan &ndash; Kalinga Apayao District, Northern Philippines Annual Conference from June 13, 2003, up to May 2010. As District Superintendent, he organized several local churches and worshipping congregations and initiated programs and major Income Generating Projects (IGPs) to boost the district&#39;s finances. With all these efforts, he was able to help increase the membership of the district. He encouraged, supported, and motivated workers and lay leaders to attend various seminars and conferences, thus, making them more effective and productive church workers.<br /> <br /> After his superintendency, Bishop Rodolfo A. Juan appointed him as President of John Wesley College, Tuguegarao City.

At the age of thirteen, while reading the New Testament, he felt a call to serve. He began preaching as a youth and was encouraged to continue doing so. As a young adult, he attended the University of Maryland, (B.A. in Sociology, 1969.) He also graduated from Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, DC with a Master of Divinity degree.<br /> <br /> In 1973 Warner was ordained deacon in the Baltimore Annual Conference by Bishop James K. Mathews. Yet his movement west had already begun with a pastoral appointment in the Western Pennsylvania Annual Conference as both the pastor of a church and Director of Bethany House Ministries in Pittsburgh, a social service ministry for two housing projects. While serving in western Pennsylvania, he was ordained elder in 1975 by Bishop Roy C. Nichols. In 1979, he answered a national search for an associate conference staff position in the California-Nevada Conference and transferred there. Once in California, it was only six months later that he was asked to serve as Conference Council Director.<br /> <br /> From this role of program and administrative oversight for the Conference, Warner was appointed just four years later to the Superintendency of the Golden Gate District, the richly diverse area including San Francisco and several rural and suburban counties along the Pacific Coast. Four years after that, he was given the charge of the Taylor Memorial UMC in Oakland, CA. While serving this significant congregation, the community was then assaulted by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and two years later the holocaust of fires in the Oakland hills. As chairperson of the Oakland Inter-religious Network for responding to this disaster, Warner led the community&#39;s ecumenical disaster response.<br /> <br /> Throughout these years, Warner has been active in the social justice ministries and programs of those communities and church connections where he has been appointed. To list but a sampling: Volunteer Police Chaplain, Trustee of the Glide Foundation, vice-chair of the Community Advisory Commission for Alameda County Medical Center, member of the Governing Board of United Way for Kern County, a member of the. Board of Directors for the Bakersfield Homeless Shelter, recipient of the 1996 Outstanding Leadership and Service Award for Emergency Response Ministries, given by UMCOR, and recipient of a 1998 Special Congressional Recognition from Congresswoman Barbara Lee.<br /> <br /> Warner&#39;s leadership in the church has included service as a delegate to General Conference twice, member of the General Commission on Religion and Race, a faculty member for New DS/CCD training, Harry Hoosier Member of and twice the host for the National Black Methodists for Church Renewal, chair of the Board of Missions in California-Nevada Annual Conference as well as numerous other conference boards and agencies, adjunct consultant to the Alban Institute, and a Wesley Seminary Distinguished Alumni.<br /> <br /> Following a successful eleven-year pastorate in Oakland, Warner was given a new challenge as Senior Pastor of the predominantly white yet multi-ethnic First UMC of Bakersfield, CA. Only two years into this pastorate, he was nominated and endorsed by his conference for the episcopacy: at the Western Jurisdiction Conference Sessions in Casper, Wyoming, and in July of 2000 he was elected to the episcopacy on the 19th ballot and assigned to the Denver Area. He retired in July 2016.<br /> <br /> Bishop Brown is married to Minnie Jones Brown; their family includes Catina Marie Harvin, Warner III, and Calvin Brown.&nbsp;</p>\n\nLawson Bryan\n\nRetired\n\nUnited States\n\nSoutheastern Jurisdiction\n\n<p>Bishop Lawson Bryan is a retired Bishop in The United Methodist Church, serving from 2016-2021.&nbsp;<br /> ------------------------<br /> <br /> Born:&nbsp;June 13, 1950 in Quincy, Florida&nbsp;<br /> Raised in Dothan, AL<br /> Graduated from Dothan High School, 1968<br /> Bachelor of Science, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA,&nbsp;cum laude<br /> Master of Divinity, Emory University, Atlanta, GA,&nbsp;cum laude<br /> <br /> Doctor of Ministry, Emory University, Atlanta, GA<br /> <br /> Married to Sherrill O.

Bishop Dottie calls for &ldquo;heretics&rdquo; to lead the&nbsp;church forward. As the ones who create movements, as the ones who see clearly the&nbsp;Church&rsquo;s true vision, edge-dwellers are now recognized and rewarded by society, while&nbsp;at the same time rejected by the Church. Now is the time, she says, to push these new&nbsp;leaders, these edge dwellers, to the forefront of church restarts.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Worship, preaching, justice, mercy, and creating space for revolutionary change define&nbsp;Bishop Dottie&rsquo;s work and passion. She is full of hope that the Holy Spirit is leading the&nbsp;Church in the present and into the future, and calls on churches to develop communities&nbsp;of true disciples of Jesus Christ who participate in this transformation.<br /> &nbsp;\n\nRuby-Nell M.
