        "text": "by Brian Kunde\n\nIn the course of writing my review of the Laughlin/Levack de Camp bibliography, I got side-tracked into researching Charlotte Laughlin, the principal bibliographer. The resulting sketch goes well beyond the scope of the review, and as I thought it might not be devoid of interest to readers of this blog, I present the same separately here.\n\nDr. Charlotte Laughlin was born Charlotte Gay Laughlin in Brownwood, Brown County, Texas, on August 18, 1951, the daughter of Billy Roy and Mildred Fay (Wise) Laughlin. Raised in Brownwood, she attended Brownwood High School, where she served on the student council and was salutatorian of her graduating class. At eighteen she moved to Austin to attend the University of Texas. There she earned her M.A. and Ph.D.\n\nShe has a number of academic publications to her name, including her M.A. thesis The Conventical Courant: an Example of Political and Religious Journalism (1974) and Ph.D. dissertation A Catalogue of the Denton Welch Collection at the University of Texas (1975), and the article “Mazeppa and the Bride of Abydos: a Comparison of Title-Page Variants” (Library Chronicle of the University of Texas n.s. no. 9, 1978), all issued by the University of Texas at Austin. She is also responsible for the privately printed monograph on the Goggin-Camp Home in Brownwood, Texas, date unknown.\n\nShe married Billy Charles Lee on May 24, 1973 in Austin, Texas. When Charlotte was twenty-four, they returned to Brownwood, where she taught English at Howard Payne University. The Laughlin-Lees continued to reside there at least into the mid-1990s.\n\nBy the 1970s at the latest she had developed a keen interest in the works of Robert E. Howard and the history of the American paperback. With Billy Lee, Charlotte edited Paperback Quarterly, A Journal for Paperback Collectors, issued by the American Paperback Institute and published by Pecan Valley Press from Brownwood starting with v. 1, no. 1, Spring 1978. The magazine ran through v. 5, no. 4, winter 1982, with which it apparently ceased. Wildside Press has reprints of most issues available.\n\nRobert Hauptman of the University of Oklahoma assessed the journal thusly: “Paperback Quarterly is a small but lively journal that specializes in the history of the paperback book. Mystery, detective, and science fiction, as well as authors, illustrators, and many other topics turn up in articles such as ‘Dashiell Hammett in the Dell Mapbacks’ or ‘Paperback Postcards.’ Book reviews, correspondence, and numerous illustrations make this an appropriate title for bibliographic collections. G. Thomas Tanselle has indicated that Paperback Quarterly covers a previously neglected area.” (Library Journal, v. 107, no. 19, November 1, 1982, p. 2057)\n\nLaughlin’s acquaintance with Sprague and Catherine de Camp stems from their mutual enthusiasm for Robert E. Howard. In March 1978, while researching their biography of Howard, the de Camps came to Brownwood to examine the books from REH’s personal collection at the Howard Payne University Library. Learning of the visit, Laughlin soon tracked the couple down, and a meeting over dinner was arranged. Attending were the de Camps, their hosts Jack Scott (former editor of the Cross Plains newspaper) and his wife Juakana Scott, Laughlin and her husband Billy Lee, and Laughlin’s Howard Payne colleague Professor Bill Crider and his wife Judy. At the dinner, Laughlin surprised the de Camps by providing them copies of a number of REH documents they had been looking for.\n\nPer Laughlin, the de Camps in return “graciously consented to give an informal interview for the PQ and to speak to my English classes about writing and research.” These talks formed the basis of Laughlin’s article “A Conversation with the de Camps,” which appeared in (and made the cover of) the very first issue of Paperback Quarterly (v. 1, no. 1, Spring 1978, pp. 16-22). Sprague de Camp also got an article out of their early acquaintance; “American English from Central Texas,” including a transcription of Laughlin’s reading of Aesop’s “The North Wind and the Sun,” which appeared as a specimen of Texan dialect in the Journal of the International Phonetic Association (v. 8, iss. 1/2, June 1978, pp. 81-82).\n\nDe Camp was evidently taken with Laughlin’s appearance, later dedicating his poetry collection Heroes and Hobgoblins (Donald M. Grant, 1981) “to the prettiest professor: Dr. Charlotte Laughlin,” a description he repeats on describing their initial meeting in his autobiography Time and Chance (Donald M. Grant, 1996, p. 395), now qualifying it as “the prettiest professor of my acquaintance.” (Incidentally, on that same page he name-drops Phillip Sawyer as one of his bodyguards at the fourth World Fantasy Convention.)\n\nThe de Camps were also impressed by Laughlin’s bibliographical credentials. It can be no accident that her first major project of that nature after Paperback Quarterly was as principal compiler of De Camp: An L. Sprague de Camp Bibliography (Underwood/Miller, 1983). Her introduction notes that “[t]he attempt at completeness was greatly aided by the active help of Sprague and Catherine de Camp and by examination of their files, opus cards, and personal library.” The book was plainly a fully cooperative venture. I suspect the impetus for the project may have come from Catherine de Camp herself. Laughlin’s share of the book’s dedication page reads “For Catherine Crook de Camp / Without whom this book and many books / Herein described would not have been.” (Emphasis added.)\n\nOver the years the relationship deepened with the continuing visits of the de Camps to Texas, the residence of their sons in the region, and finally their own move to Plano in 1989. While the decision to archive the de Camp papers in the Harry Ransom Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin seems an obvious one, given its status as the principal academic research institution in the region, it may also have been facilitated by Laughlin’s past connection with the university. In a letter of 11 June 1994 Sprague referred to the Laughlin-Lees as “our main friends in Brownwood.”\n\nSince the de Camp bibliography Laughlin has published relatively little. In the early 1990s she wrote a couple “lift the flap” religious children’s books called Where’s Baby Jesus? and Where’s the Lost Sheep? While these come across as a departure from her other work, religion is more overt in Texas than some parts of the country. This was, after all, where Catherine de Camp, following her husband’s March 1978 talk in Laughlin’s English class, was greeted by a student with “Are you saved?”\n\nMore recently and more characteristically Laughlin turned to writing the sort of fiction she had previously written about; in 1994 she was working on a fantasy novel with the working title The Heart of Ahriman. This, of course, was the name of the magical artifact invented by Robert E. Howard in his Conan novel The Hour of the Dragon (or Conan the Conqueror, if you prefer). Laughlin’s novel seems not to have been published in full, or perhaps even finished. Still, a selection from it, “An Excerpt from The Stone of Namirha,” did later appear in Cross Plains Universe: Texans Celebrate Robert E. Howard, edited by Scott A. Cupp and Joe R. Lansdale (MonkeyBrain Books and Fandom Association of Central Texas, 2006).\n\nThis “excerpt” was written in collaboration with Bill Crider, a long-time professional associate of Laughlin’s, whom the sharp-eyed will note appears above as an attendee at that memorable 1978 meeting with the de Camps. He was a seasoned author in his own right, best known for his mysteries. He also wrote spy fiction, Westerns, horror novels, and children’s books, His expertise was doubtless helpful to first-time fiction writer Laughlin. Crider passed on in 2018 at the age of seventy-six. (Photo below of Bill Crider from http://www.billcrider.com)\n\nOne may wonder why the title shifted from The Heart of Ahriman to The Stone of Namirha. Gary Romeo, who called my attention to the connection of the excerpt with the novel, notes: “I’m pretty sure it had to be changed since CPI now owned Howard’s phrase ‘The Heart of Ahriman.’” While the name Ahriman itself, drawn by Howard from Zoroastrianism, can’t be owned, a need was evidently felt to forestall any possible legal dispute. So Heart became Stone and Ahriman became Namirha, which, as Gary also notes, is merely Ahriman spelled backwards.\n\nAnd what’s become of Laughlin since? These days, she continues to teach English, now at McLennan Community College in Waco, where she has the reputation of being personable and supportive but lecture-light and reading/writing-heavy in her teaching style.\n\n# # #\n\nBonus:\n\nBrian adds:\n\nFor those not acquainted with the International Phonetic Alphabet de Camp uses to transcribe Laughlin’s speech, we append a transcript in standard English and the standard alphabet. The text of the fable Laughlin reads, incidentally, is a common one used for phonetic demonstrations in comparative linguistics. Her reading deviates slightly from the prescribed script in a few instances.\n\nThe North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger,\n\nwhen a traveler came along wrapped in a warm coat. They agreed that\n\nthe one who first succeeded in making the traveler take his coat off\n\nshould be considered stronger than the other. Then the North Wind blew as\n\nhard as he could, but the more he blew, the more closely did the\n\ntraveler fold his cloak around him, and at last the North Wind\n\ngave up the attempt. Then the Sun shone out warmly, and immediately\n\nthe traveler took off his cloak. And so the North Wind was obliged to\n\nconfess that the Sun was the stronger of the two."
