        "text": "I don’t have signed firsts of all Neil Gaiman’s children’s books, but I’m closing in on it.\n\nGaiman, Neil, and Adam Rex (illustrator). Chu’s First Day of School. HarperCollins Children’s Books, 2014. First edition hardback (“First Edition” stated and numberline ending in “1”), a Fine copy in a Fine dust jacket, signed by Gaiman. Illustrated children’s book about a Panda, and a sequel to Chu’s Day, which I don’t have. Bought for $30 off eBay.\n\nI already had a first of The Seventeen Virgins, but not a signed first.\n\nVance, Jack. The Seventeen Virgins. Underwood/Miller, 1979. First edition chapbook original, a Fine- copy with one wrinkle to top corner and slight fading along spine, signed by Vance. Hewett, A58. Cunningham, B.70a. Chalker/Owings, pages 430-431 (where they note that only 400 were produced, not the 600 stated). Supplements an unsigned copy and the signed, limited hardback edition of The Seventeen Virgins & A Bagful of Dreams. Bought off eBay for $32 plus shipping.\n\nAnother Dragonstairs chapbook.\n\nSwanwick, Michael. The War with the Zylv. Dragonstairs Press, 2024. First edition chapbook original, #50 of 100 signed, numbered copies, a Fine copy. A story based on the piece of art used as the cover.\n\nI will have copies of this available in the next Lame Excuse Books catalog.\n\nHere’s a book I was tempted to pick up copies of when it was announced, but passed because I wasn’t sure how well it would sell. With The Day of the Triffids and The Midwich Cuckoos, Wyndham is probably considered a top 10 SF all time writer in the UK, but he’s less well known on this side of the pond.\n\nWyndham, John (David Dyte, editor). Logical Fantasy: The Many Worlds of John Wyndham. Subterranean Press, 2024. First edition hardback, #361 of 1,000 numbered copies, a Fine copy in a Fine dust jacket and publisher’s plastic bag, with bookmark laid in. Bought for $25 plus shipping during a Subterranean sale.\n\nAnother Swanwick book, this one from PS Publishing.\n\nSwanwick, Michael. The Sleep of Reason. PS Publishing, 2024. First edition hardback, #24 of 100 signed, numbered copies (the only hardback edition), a Fine copy in a Fine dust jacket. 80 short stories, each based on a Goya etching.\n\nThis hardback edition is now sold out from the publisher, but I will have a very small number available in the next Lame Excuse Books catalog.\n\nThese are the last two books from that estate auction I’m incorporating into my own library.\n\nDick, Philip K. Dr. Futurity with The Unteleported Man. Ace, 1972. First edition thus (each book previously published with other Ace Doubles), stating “Second Ace printing, September 1972,” a Near Fine copy with slight bumping at corners, slight wear along spine, foxing around edges of interior covers, and slight age darkening of pages. Levack, 14.c and 43.c. Wintz and Hyde, Precious Artifacts SF8.2 and SF29.2. Supplements the Ace PBO first of Dr. Futurity (back to back with John Brunner’s Slavers of Space), the Centipede Press first hardback of Dr. Futurity, the Ace PBO first of The Unteleported Man (back to back with Howard L. Cory’s The Mind Monsters), the Berkley PBO first of the expanded edition of The Unteleported Man, and the Gollancz hardback first of Lies, Inc. featuring the expanded text.\n\nDick, Philip K. The Golden Man. Berkley, 1980. First edition paperback original, a Near Fine copy with one spine crease and a trace of edgewear. Short story collection. Levack, 20.a. Wintz and Hyde, Precious Artifacts COL6.a. Supplements a copy of the SFBC (first hardback) edition.\n\nI picked up a lot of Dick paperbacks (among other books) that will be available in the next Lame Excuse Books catalog.\n\nThe first of these is a somewhat odd Lansdale item I passed up when first offered, while the other two are new books in from their publishers.\n\nLansdale, Joe R. Cold in July. Bantam, 1989. First edition paperback original, a Fine- copy with slight wear to top front corner, a P/C copy of 100 copies prepared for The Overlook Connection in a custom slipcase (this one Near Fine with a couple of faint spots to rear, one to back spine, and slight age darkening at top, bottom and left edge) with a custom signature page for Lansdale tipped in. I always thought the Overlook Connection aftermarket slipcased PBO limiteds were weird things, and didn’t pick them up when they came out. (I think this may have been offered at $50, and the Drive-In set (which I also have) at $100, but I might be misremembering.) Isakjanko A011.a (though he does not mention this Overlook Connection variant). Nova Express Lansdale bibliography, 1.5.a (and I did mention this version). Supplements multiple slipcase sets of the Ziesing Cold in July/Savage Season sets (a signed PC set I received for helping type this novel into a computer from galley proofs, a signed numbered set, and an inscribed “mock limited” set that Ziesing assembled and sold because he had extra slipcases left over). Bought online for $24.99.\n\nLansdale, Joe R. The Donut Legion. Short Scary Tales (SST) Press, 2024. First limited edition hardback, #101 of 500 signed, numbered copies, a Fine copy in a Fine dust jacket with tissue closure sticker and shipping card laid in. Supplements a copy of the first trade edition (which precedes) inscribed to me.\n\nLansdale, Joe R. The Unlikely Affair of the Crawling Razor. Subterranean Press, 2024. First edition hardback, #368 of 1000 signed, numbered copies, a Fine copy in a Fine dust jacket, in publisher’s plastic bag. Auguste Dupin investigate a case involving The God of the Razor.\n\nI will have copies of the SST Donut Legion and The Unlikely Affair of the Crawling Razor available in the next Lame Excuse Books catalog.\n\nOver the years I’ve tended to pick up fewer and fewer anthologies, mainly because I haven’t been reading them as much, and they’re almost always available in nice condition on the used market for considerably less than cover price. Such as these two anthologies, which I considered picking up when they came out but ultimately didn’t. These are the last two hardback books for my own library from that estate purchase.\n\nKessel, John, Mark L. Van Name and Richard Butner, editors. Intersections: The Sycamore Hill Anthology. Tor, 1996. First edition hardback, a Fine copy in a Fine- dust jacket with faint haze rubbing. Original anthology of Sycamore Hill participants, including Bruce Sterling’s award-winning “Bicycle Repairman.”\n\nRucker, Rudy, Peter Lamborn Wilson and Robert Anton Wilson, editors. Semiotext(e) SF. Autonomedia, 1989. First edition trade paperback original, a Fine- copy with slight bump to front corner. Anthology with both a lot of recognizable SF names (William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Lewis Shiner, Philip Jose Farmer, Robert Sheckley, etc.) and a lot of counterculture figures (William S. Burroughs, Ivan Stang, Kerry Thornley, etc.) Part of that Autonomedia/RE:Search/Fringeware axis of post-punk SF that flourished in the late 80s and early 90s. If you don’t own a copy of Modern Stories #1 (I do), this is the only place to find Gibson’s “Hippie Hat Brain Parasite.”"
