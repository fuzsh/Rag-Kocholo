        "text": "by Brian Kunde\n\nToday’s de Camp highlight is Antarctic Conquest: the Story of the Ronne Expedition, 1946-1948 by Finn Ronne, Commander, U.S.N.R. New York: G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1949. I know of only that one edition. This is a fine book on one of the last private expeditions to Antarctica before the 1957-58 International Geophysical Year and the wholesale takeover of research there by governments. But it was published seventy-five years ago. What reason would anyone have for reading it today? And what makes it relevant to L. Sprague de Camp?\n\nWell, it provides a window on times gone and places vastly changed from what they have since become. When we read of the post-World War II era these days, we’re generally looking at politicians or cultural figures and the unfolding of the Cold War, not at working scientists, and definitely not at Antarctica. Which is a shame.\n\nIt was an era of can-do people and a hands-on world, of slow, meticulous organization and, at need, rapid improvisation. It was, by and large, a world of men, in which women were secondary or marginalized, and yet one of gusto, verve and optimism. We often think the period after the advent of the atomic bomb one of unrelieved fear and gloom. Yet people could put such concerns aside and match themselves against nature in the pursuit of knowledge. It was a time recognizably still akin to our own, though rendered curiously remote by advances of technology. It was a machine age, a mass production age, but by our standards still a do-it-yourself one, not the online, automated, globalized one we live in now. With a certain nostalgia, we can recognize it as the world of our parents or grandparents. All this comes through in this book.\n\nAnd there’s more, notably a rather ill-kept secret that led me to seek it out in the first place. It is not, as it appears on the surface, the engaging memoir of chipper, indefatigable explorer Finn Ronne. Oh, it’s certainly his story, and that he was all that I’ve no doubt. What he wasn’t, evidently, was a very good writer. His book, however, is very well written. How can this be?\n\nHe had help. Specifically, help from speculative fiction and science writer L. Sprague de Camp, who was then struggling to restart a literary career sidelined by the war. His role in distilling Ronne’s reminiscences into a readable narrative is recognized … nowhere in the book. Here’s how it came about, per de Camp:\n\n“Another hack job was ghosting a book for the polar explorer Finn Ronne. A Norwegian-American, Ronne had returned from an Antarctic expedition to try to settle the question of whether Antarctica, beneath its mantle of snow and ice, was a single continent or an archipelago; and he wanted to make a book of it. Finding a mere transcript of his log unsalable, he appealed to his agent, who recruited me.\n\n“One time in New York, early in 1949, Finn, his wife, and I were walking up Broadway in a light snowfall. Jackie Ronne said: ‘We struggled so hard over that manuscript, and you make it seem easy!’\n\n“‘Well,’ I said, ‘if, having read your manuscript, I bought a fur coat and a pair of snowshoes and started out for the South Pole, you’d think I was a damned fool, now wouldn’t you? But I’ve been at the writing trade for fifteen years, learning it; and I’m still learning.’\n\n“In ghosting the book, my job was to get Finn to relax while I asked him: ‘Now, Finn, when McClary fell off the ice cliff, who first noticed that he was getting near it? Who said what?’\n\n“Finn would close his eyes, reliving the scene. ‘It vas Nichols and McLean who saw him. One of them yelled: ‘Yesus Christ, Mac, stop! Vatch out!’ But now, you vouldn’t vant to say ‘Yesus Christ’ in the book, vould you? That vouldn’t be nice!’ … Finn was a man of austere standards.”\n\n“I finished Antarctic Conquest in May 1949, and Putnam brought out the book late that year. It got excellent reviews but sold badly; people were not interested in polar exploration just then.\n\n“The original agreement was that my name should appear in the book as Ronne’s collaborator. But I was offered more money if my name were omitted; and being pinched, I accepted the offer. So you will just have to take my word that I did ghost this book.”\n\n—L. Sprague de Camp, Time & Chance, 1996, pp. 206-207\n\n(slightly condensed and rearranged for clarity).\n\nWe don’t entirely have to take de Camp’s word for it. One thing I was curious about going into the book was whether de Camp’s own voice had wholly been subsumed into Ronne’s persona, or if on the other hand any of his unique style would shine through. It does. In fact, he manages the nice feat of projecting what I take to be Ronne’s actual personality while simultaneously enriching the story with his own characteristic humor, instruction and breezy erudition.\n\nAntarctic Conquest thus engaged me on two levels, first as a straightforward autobiographical account of Ronne’s Antarctic expedition, and second as a scavenger hunt to uncover various Easter Eggs from his “ghost.” It was a run ride.\n\nBut more than that, it’s a fascinating read. It’s crisp and to the point, with little excess verbiage devoted to scene-setting; we get the context as we move along. Everything that’s said helps paint the picture of the era in which the expedition took place and was written. The mores, the culture, the physicality of the time all come through.\n\nContents at a glance: there’s a foreword by Dr. Isaiah Bowman, an introduction by Ronne (with or without de Camp), thirteen chapters forming the “meat” of the book; “We Shove Off,” “To the Bottom of the World,” “The Main Base,” “The Freeze-In,” “The Winter Night,” “Down a Crevasse,” “The Lost Fliers,” “Field Parties Away!,” “One Continent,” “The Last Unknown Coast,” “Back to Base,” “What We Accomplished,” and “Farvel!” (Farewell), plus an appendix and an index. Maps preceding and following the text show the Antarctic continent (shading the region explored and/or photographed by the expedition), and the Palmer Peninsula and areas to its south (the same region, enlarged). Additional maps and numerous photographs are liberally sprinkled through the text.\n\nIncidentally, forewordist Isaiah Bowman (1878-1950), was a Canadian American geographer who was a founding director of the American Geographical Society and president of Johns Hopkins University. Quite prominent in his own time, his present day reputation is marred by his virulent anti-Semitism and conduct as head of Roosevelt’s project to find refuge for Jewish emigrants from Europe during World War II; unsurprisingly, he was not the right man for the job, treating his assignment with a distinct lack of urgency, and in seeking out areas in which refugees might be resettled looked everywhere but the United States. Yeah, he was a real stinker. None of which is apparent in his unobjectionable foreword, which strikes the note of laudatory enthusiasm appropriate to such exercises.\n\nRonne and de Camp take us methodically through the preparations for the expedition with all the attendant snafus, complications, and bureaucratic entanglements. We chug with it down the coasts of the Americas to the Antarctic and experience with its participants the awe of their encounter with the frozen and unforgiving southern continent. We set up camp and experiment stations with them, dogsled and fly mapping planes with them as they penetrate and record pristine territory, suffer through weather that often upsets the most carefully laid plans, and worry over injured colleagues and lost scouting parties. We wonder at the sheer difficulty of life in Antarctica, how its climate makes the simplest things difficult, and how by pluck, ingenuity and perseverance such hazards are overcome.\n\nA host of little things remind as we are in a world history has left behind; the touchiness of Chileans and Britons in regard to their Antarctic land claims, for instance, which leads to objections from the latter to the Americans reoccupying an old American-built base and re-raising the flag there. Or the casual references to the recent privations of the war years, the taken-for-granted second class status of women, or the fact that almost everybody is a problem-solving, enthusiastic jack-of-all-trades. The evocations of time and place and descriptions of the Antarctic weather, sights and conditions are vivid and convincing.\n\nWe find out as we go along what the state of knowledge was on the region, and how much remained to be discovered, explored, or even corrected. Places had been mapped so poorly the Ronne Expedition had to re-chart locations previously deemed known. A major goal was determining whether the Palmer Peninsula was part of the main continent or a separate subcontinent. Weather, tides, geophysical activity, and cosmic rays had barely been measured or investigated previously; the yearlong timeframe of the expedition allowed it to accumulate fundamental baseline data on all of these. There were various firsts. For instance, two women were included among the participants, providing valuable contributions to the joint effort. They were wives of two of the male personnel, including Ronne himself, but you have to start somewhere.\n\nHere it might be well to mention that the other wife, Jennie Darlington, whose husband was pilot Harry Darlington, left her own memoir of the expedition, My Antarctic Honeymoon: A Year at the Bottom of the World, by Jennie Darlington as told to Jane McIlvaine (Doubleday, 1957). According to her Wikipedia article, “She and Ronne did not get on, although this may have been due to issues between their spouses.” Geologist John C. Behrendt, a later Antarctic explorer who knew Ronne, confirmed their animosity, noting that her book is “quite critical of Ronne,” who in turn objected to it being read or circulated on the continent, and mocked her for having resorted to a collaborator to tell her story. Now there’s irony… The general feeling I get from Behrendt is that he found Ronne personable and charming, but prickly on further acquaintance. (John C. Behrendt, Innocents on the Ice: A Memoir of Antarctic Exploration, 1957 (University of Chicago Press, 1998). But returning to this book, Ronne and de Camp express no animosity towards Darlington in it, or indeed any member of the expedition except one unnamed man who had to be let go “for cause.” Ronne may not have liked her, but he saw no need to express it—then.\n\nThere’s an authenticity of contemporary accounts by people who lived what they wrote that is missing from historical recreations. Antarctic Conquest has it. It comes from people of the time, writing for readers of the time. It is fresh, unselfconscious and unapologetic. These past voices aren’t attempting to justify their era to ours, but straight-forwardly presenting the mysteries of their own world to their own contemporaries.\n\nThat said, observations made at that time on occasion disturbingly in the present day. In one striking instance, we recognize that even in the late 1940s the effects of global warming in Antarctica were apparent to Ronne. On page 67 he compares landscapes observed in 1947-48 to the same locales as he had known them in 1939-41, on his previous Antarctic expedition, and likens the situation to the opposite hemisphere:\n\n“The retreat of the ice that they noticed, and which I had already observed in our local glacier, we found characteristic wherever we went. A similar shrinkage of glaciers and ice barriers has been noted in the Arctic, which points to a gradual warming of the earth’s climate. If this process ever gets to the point of melting the Greenland and Antarctic icecaps completely, the water thus released will so raise the sea level that all the world’s seaports will have to move miles inland. However, since such a change would take hundreds of thousands of years, it’s nothing for us to worry about.”\n\nFrom our perspective, we can see that Ronne’s confidence about timing was misplaced. But it’s unrealistic to expect of him the prescience to recognize the warming he perceived as an accelerating trend, much less anticipate the speed and magnitude at which it would develop.\n\nMoving on to the “Easter Eggs,” there are plenty of typically de Campian asides, such as a discussion on the history of the search for Terra Austalis Incognita before the actual, more circumscribed island continents of Australia and Antarctica were discovered. There are also some rather obtrusive footnotes clarifying this or that aspect of nautical or boreal terminology that the moderately well-educated reader may find annoying, and one better versed in such things exasperating. I’m not certain if de Camp or Ronne perpetrated these. Either might have assumed such cluelessness on the part of the intended audience that it would need to be told “topped off” means “filled to capacity,” a fathom is six feet, “calved off” means “broke off,” or “belayed” is “held down.” Fortunately, these taper off the further you get in the book.\n\nAfficionados of speculative fiction may be disappointed to learn that the Ronne expedition did not find the great city of the Old Ones while they were in Antarctica, or, if they did, they didn’t recognize it. Possibly the Old Ones’ devotees, cleverly disguised as penguins and seals, camouflaged the place as a conglomeration of ice formations. And I take it no Campbellesque shape-changing aliens were encountered, either!\n\nMy only real gripe is the story feels unfinished. In contrast to the detailed relation of the preparations for the expedition and the journey south, the end is truncated, coming to a close as soon as the ship carrying it north from the Antarctic reaches Puntas Arenas in southern Chile. What becomes of these people we have just spent a year with on the southern continent, and come to care about? We don’t know.\n\nFortunately, there are appendices—lists of accomplishments, publications and expedition members, with more information. Some of what the narrative denies us we find out there. But these don’t really counter the abrupt conclusion.\n\nSo, in conclusion, how is the book? I can only repeat what I said initially. Ronne has a great story, and de Camp does a good job with it. It’s a shame it didn’t get as big an audience as it should have, and (in my view) that the de Camp name didn’t get on it. But that makes for plenty of second-hand copies available online for reasonable prices.\n\nIt’s instructive to trace the effect de Camp’s peripheral and after-the-fact involvement in Ronne’s adventure had on his work. Other than a textbook and articles of varying length, this was his first extended venture into nonfiction. He carries it off with aplomb. Writing first person in Ronne’s voice suits de Camp quite well, and the personal touch carries over into much of his subsequent non-fiction. It’s rarer in his fiction aside from a few instances, as in “Aristotle and the Gun,” “Judgment Day,” and the Reginald Rivers tales, but he uses it effectively there as well.\n\nThe project itself also had an afterlife in his writings. Finn Ronne as a person seems to have made quite an impression on him—de Camp notes that Ronne was the basis of the Ivar Heggstad character in his novels of the planet Krishna. The professional relationship between Ronne and de Camp (as adventurer and hired ghost writer) is reflected in that of Igor Shtain and Dirk Barnevelt in the novel The Hand of Zei, and de Camp made use of the setting in the Krishna series too. In the same novel, Barnevelt and George Tangaloa assume the aliases of two famous personages from Krishna’s own Antarctic region, and the region itself is used in the short story “Calories,” the only Krishna tale set outside the Triple Seas region.\n\nSo Antarctic Conquest is not just enjoyable in its own right, as a narrative of adventure and polar exploration, but for its influence in de Camp’s literary career.\n\nNeed I add that I heartily recommend this book, old as it is, for your own perusal?\n\nAntarctic Conquest is dedicated “To my wife Edith, who was an anchor to windward and saw the whole expedition through with me.” This is Ronne’s dedication, of course; any by de Camp, as befits a proper ghost, is invisible.\n\n#\n\nAn earlier version of this review appeared on the d for de Camp Yahoo Group on March 14, 2024, and the L. Sprague de Camp- Enchanter of the Quill Facebook group on March 15, 2019. My thanks to Joseph T. Major for additional information on Jennie Darlington.\n\nby Steve Replogle\n\nA friend of mine says it’s easier to find a Howard tale that was adapted by Roy Thomas for Marvel’s Conan series than it is to find a tale that was left untouched. The Turlogh Dubh O’Brien stories are mostly in the first category. “The Grey God Passes,” “The Dark Man,” and “The Gods of Bal-Sagoth” were all adapted during the early years of Thomas’ run on Conan the Barbarian. For all I know, “The Shadow of the Hun” has been adapted, too, and I just missed it among the proliferation of titles, creators, and publishers that have contracted with Conan Properties, Inc. over the recent years.\n\nHow did Thomas originally come to adapt non-Conan stories into his Conan series? By following the example of L. Sprague de Camp. In The Chronicles of Conan, Volume One, Thomas tells us: “Howard had written… fine quasi-historical stories, many of which could easily be adapted into Conan tales. In fact, writer L. Sprague de Camp had already done precisely that with several REH stories in one of the Gnome hardcovers, and was doing more of the same in the paperbacks. I thought de Camp had a good idea there, so I suggested to Glenn [Lord] that I be allowed to do the same in the comics, and he agreed…”\n\nThe three Turlogh stories were adapted into Conan tales by Thomas with three of the best comic artists of their time: Barry Windsor-Smith, Gil Kane, and Neal Adams. This was during the period known as the Bronze Age of Comics, following the pop culture explosion of the Batman tv show in 1966 and the early 1970’s ascendancy of Marvel Comics on the newsstands and in the fledgling network comic-book shops. Kane and Adams have both passed on (Kane died in 2000, Adams in 2022), and Windsor-Smith, now 75, has retired from comics entirely.\n\nBut back in the olden days 1971, Barry Windsor-Smith was just emerging from the overwhelming influence of Jack Kirby and starting to develop his own style. Every issue improved upon the work he showed in the one before. There was a very decided leap in the quality between Conan #2 and his Turlogh adaptation in #3. This wasn’t, however, entirely due to Windsor-Smith’s evolution as an artist. Readers found out, years later, that Roy Thomas had switched the order of publication in several of those early Conan issues. They had been drawn in this order: 1, 2, 5, 4 and 3. The Turlogh adaptation was the fifth story drawn by Windsor-Smith, even though it was published in the third issue. When I bought the third issue of Conan the Barbarian, I was eleven years old – but even then I could see the difference.\n\nHere’s Thomas, again: “The story I adapted first was one called ‘The Grey God Passes,’ set in ancient Ireland—and the combination of Howard’s prose and the setting must have inspired Barry, because there is some beautiful, lyrical work in what became our ‘The Twilight of the Grim Grey God.’”\n\nThe artwork is indeed quite effective throughout the adaptation. The cover, while not accurately presenting any moment from the story, is vivid and powerful. It shows a gigantic Odin (called Borri in the comic) holding a beautiful woman in right hand while he towers over Conan, who is attacking him with a sword. For this illustration Windsor-Smith inked his own pencils, and a clue to his future artistic development can be found in the rings shown on Borri’s immense fingers. Each ring is drawn differently, with stylistic rendering. This shows the flair of an illustrator who is exploring and extending his craft.\n\nWindsor-Smith’s website has a revealing biography of the artist. It may have been written by Windsor-Smith himself; it certainly has his approval. Here’s how it describes his artist’s growth.\n\n“Forsaking the inspiration of Jack Kirby, Barry developed a style of thoughtful dynamism and art and design entirely unknown to American comic books… Incorporating his early influences of Art Nouveau’s organic flourishes, and the extraordinarily detailed naturalism of the Pre-Raphaelite school of painting, Windsor-Smith’s ever-evolving methods of storytelling brought a sense of ornate classicism to the monthly Conan comic books that even now, over thirty years later, remains without peer.”\n\nThat is all very true, whether it’s the artist saying so himself or not. The appearance of the Grim Grey God and his Choosers of the Slain (not Valkyries, in name at least) are the most beautiful images in the story.\n\nOther panels reveal the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites on Windsor-Smith. These emphasize the characters as part of a living, organic landscape, where trees and leaf-filled branches are just as important as the human figures in the scene.\n\nThe adaptation by Thomas is well-done. It maintains many of the conflicts, exchanges, and ironies of the original story. The pacing is quite condensed, of course, as the presentation had to fit into a mere twenty pages. The dialogue is more melodramatic, and sometimes awkwardly tailored toward moving the plot along from panel to panel. But the conversation between Borri and Conan at the beginning is properly mysterious, and properly compelling. The concluding pages strike the proper notes of irony, tragedy, and wonder.\n\nA little more than a year later, in May of 1972, Marvel published Conan the Barbarian #17, “The Gods of Bal-Sagoth.” This was the first part of an adaptation of the Turlogh O’Brien story, finished in the next issue, #18’s “The Thing in the Temple.” The adaptation is mainly faithful to the original story. It is drawn by Gil Kane, with moody, meticulous inking on Part One by Ralph Reese, an artist who often worked closely with Wally Wood. Gil Kane is known for his unusual page layouts and his remarkable figure drawing. He also rarely (maybe never) spotted blacks on his pages. The inking by Reese brought unusual depth to Kane’s work and lots and lots of black ink. The second part is inked by Dan Adkins, who does a fine job, as he has done with Barry Windsor-Smith – I just miss the dark moodiness of Reese’s work.\n\nGil Kane was a long-time admirer of Howard’s work. He was familiar with the Gnome Press editions and had even tried to create a new comic company to adapt the Conan stories to comics in the late 1950’s. It failed, but his enthusiasm for Conan continued unabated. He hoped to become Conan’s primary illustrator, after Barry Windsor-Smith stepped away from the job, but ultimately it did not pay him well enough.\n\nTwo year later, in 1974, came the last adaptation, “Night of the Dark God.” This was “The Dark Man,” adapted for Savage Tales #4, a black-and-white magazine, not the color comic. Gil Kane is back, but this time he’s inked by comics superstar Neal Adams with additional inks by Pablo Marcos, Vince Colletta, and Frank McLaughlin. Adams often had various inkers contribute to his projects, usually led by Dick Giordano and identified by the alter-ego of Crusty Bunkers, or sometimes as The Crusty Bunkers. With this work, Adams clearly inked the faces and major figures, and Pablo Marcos is noted for supplying the gray tones or wash throughout. Adams provided the cover illustration, and it is clearly only his own artwork.\n\nAdams specialized in a photorealistic approach, and his collaboration with the stylistic figures of Kane doesn’t quite come together, in my view. Some panels look like Kane panels, some look like Adams panels, but there is not often a sense that their two styles really mesh. Still, the art can be quite powerful. Adams portrays a Conan much in keeping with Frazetta’s depiction, and it is a treat to see a Frazetta-like Conan in a comic story. There are also two full-page illustrations that are striking, the opening splash page, and another splash taking up all of page five. This shows highlights from Conan’s previous battles and adventures. In the magazine’s letter column, Roy Thomas takes pains to identify Marcos as the inker for these two pages.\n\nThomas’ script makes adjustments so that the story fits the Hyborian Age. The Dark Man is now the embodiment of Brule the Spear-Slayer, from the Thurian Age, instead of Bran. The kidnapped woman is now Mara instead of Moira, and she is no longer a member of Turlogh’s family, but a lost love of Conan’s youth. The Christian priest is now a priest of Mitra.\n\nThe script makes other adjustments, too, as in the previous adaptations of the Turlogh stories – and indeed, as with all the Howard stories presented in Marvel Comics. Episodes are condensed, details are deleted. The tone or mood is flattened, or even simplified. There is a great richness in Howard’s narrative that is lost, although there is another kind of richness in seeing the narrative presented by such gifted artists. I wondered if the greater length available in a magazine would make a difference in the adaptations, which otherwise always seemed squeezed to fit into the color comics. Would Roy and the artists take advantage of the greater possibilities of a magazine, perhaps by creating a longer adaptation that retained more of Howard’s narrative? Well, they do a good job, but the story is still only 21 pages long, which is more or less the length of a color comic.\n\nThe story was actually reprinted in color in the tabloid-sized Marvel Treasury Edition #15 in 1977. The poor quality of paper makes both the blacks and the colors faint, but the larger size is nice. The best quality of reprinting that I have seen for this third Turlogh adaptation is in the Savage Tales of Conan Omnibus: The Original Marvel Years, Volume One. It collects the first eighteen magazines featuring Conan (and sometimes other Howard heroes) at 968 pages. The first printing is sold out, but a new printing is coming in September 2024 from Titan Books and will sell for $150.00.\n\nTitan Books is the most recent publisher to obtain the contract to Howard’s characters. Others have included, besides Marvel, Dark Horse Comics, Wandering Star, and Cross Plains Comics. In fact, Dark Horse published a color comic that has bearing upon this essay. It was Robert E. Howard’s Savage Sword, ten issues from 2010 to 2015. This anthology series featured not only Conan, Kull, and Bran Mak Morn, but Breckenridge Elkins, Steve Costigan, and the Sonora Kid. And one other hero – Turlogh Dubh O’Brien, not in the guise of Conan or some other hero, but the Irish warrior himself, in “The Gods of Bal-Sagoth, Part One.”\n\nThis most recent adaptation was written by Alex de Campi and illustrated by Marc Laming with colors by Warren Wucinich. The style is very different from the Marvel adaptations of the Seventies, almost forty years gone. The artwork is more loosely rendered, clearly influenced by recent trends in animation and illustration. The colors are more natural and more effective than the previous Marvel version.\n\nThe story is only eight pages long, beginning with Turlogh as a prisoner aboard the viking ship and ending as he and Athelstane save Brunhild from the carnivorous, twelve-foot-high bird. It’s too bad that almost an entire page is given up to a dramatic underwater fight with a shark, an expansion of a brief passage in the original story. But much of Howard’s dialogue is intact, and I find the lack of Thomas’ omniscient narration an improvement.\n\nThis generally faithful adaptation was never continued or concluded. The tenth issue of Robert E. Howard’s Savage Sword was the last. I do believe it is the only other adaptation outside those Marvel tales of the Seventies, although I could be wrong. Just recently, I became aware of a Barry Windsor-Smith art print of Turlogh O’Brien, a piece I had never known about. This is a possibly-unfinished work from a series that Windsor-Smith planned to create (but never finished) for ten Howardian heroes. It was created in 1978, and sold at auction in 2019.\n\nConan remains the most popular and famous character from Robert E. Howard, and he dominates all forms of narrative media: books, films, tv, and comics. Turlogh Dubh has nevertheless carved out a small but significant corner of his own in comics history, and it would not be surprising to find him in another comic in the future.\n\nby Brian Kunde\n\nToday’s de Camp highlight is GURPS Planet Krishna: Swashbuckling Adventure in Space, From the Classic “Viagens” Books by L. Sprague de Camp, by James Cambias, published by Steve Jackson Games in 1997. The order of the two subtitles is from the title page, where they appear in successively smaller print; they’re in reverse order on the cover, but since their relative print sizes remain the same, I’m taking the title page as authoritative. Which one should do in any case. (I’m a librarian. Trust me on this one.)\n\nThere was just the one edition, and it is currently out of print, though sample pages are available at sjgames.com. This is another de Camp-related book not actually by de Camp, but a must-have for anyone interested in the Viagens Interplanetarias series. Not only is it an encyclopedic examination of the Viagens setting and its history, planets, exobiologies, cultures and characters, it’s also a gaming guide to recreation therein using the GURPS role-playing game system (GURPS in fact stands for Generic Universal Role Playing System). Personally, I find the gaming aspect distracting, but given that it was the reason and excuse for the book in the first place, I can’t really knock it.\n\nIt’s actually not quite true to say this isn’t a book by de Camp. He may not have written it, but he did provide most of what’s in it, in one way or another—through his other writings and presumably communications between him and Cambias (who indeed acknowledges the assistance of both Sprague and Catherine de Camp in the text). And, while you inexplicably won’t find mention of it on the cover or the table of contents, de Camp also contributed one piece of writing to the book, a revision and updating of his essay “The Krishna Stories,” originally published in the fanzine New Frontiers, v. 1, no. 1, December 1959, which, parenthetically, you can find here:\n\nYet another version of the essay appeared as a sort of introduction to The Prisoner of Zhamanak (1982).\n\n“The Krishna Stories” essay is a brief account of how and why de Camp wrote the Viagens Interplanetarias stories, and also provides some useful in-universe background on the interstellar setting and the history of Krishna itself, along with how the stories all fit together. The three versions differ in ways both major and minor. In addition to adding material on stories he had not yet written in the 1950s, de Camp freely condensed and added to the material in his revisions. I should note also that the original one in New Frontiers included an added chronology of the then-extant stories, along with maps of Krishna and the city of Zanid. These additions are omitted from the later versions, but the GURPS book includes a “Timeline of Krishna” that is functionally equivalent to de Camp’s chronology, and its own maps of Nearby Stars, Krishna, Novorecive and Zanid. The Krishna and Zanid maps are based on de Camp’s versions, while the others are new.\n\nReturning to the book as a whole, it sports a cover by the legendary Frank Kelly Freas (1922-2005), who in an artistic career of over fifty years became lauded as the dean of science fiction artists and was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame. So his cover painting should be wonderful, right? Um, not so much. More like weirdly goofy, as if he kind of dashed off a study for a finished work and the publisher decided to use the study. He was capable of much, much better. It’s dramatic, at least, complete with fiendishly grinning green Krishnans and a brutal-looking, way too badass Terran. And what’s with all that crazy weaponry? Freas has fallen for the erroneous “all male Krishnans are bald” truism. And green. Though, to be fair, most artists have exaggerated the green aspect. His Krishnans are otherwise accurate, if a bit too smugly malevolent.\n\nThe back cover gives us a vignette of Freas’s chief crazy Krishnan to draw the eye as Steve Jackson Games oversells the content, and Krishna, as “space adventure the way it ought to be.” Hey, I agree, but I haven’t seen that many phrases concluded by exclamation points outside a comic book. You certainly can’t fault SJG for lack of enthusiasm. Note the bit about the intro by de Camp, which is the only place they see fit to mention it. Otherwise only the author statement and sign-off in the essay itself tells you there’s anything in the book by de Camp himself. We are also provided a roster of creatives who contributed to the book’s content; not just Cambias but his editor Sean Barrett, cover artist Freas, and the panel of artists whose work adorns the inside of the book; Dan Smith, Terry Tidwell, Arthur Roberg and Carol Scavella. This information is repeated inside, on the title page, with one addition; Ann Dupuis, who did the maps. And, further down, in finer print, credits for system design, managing editor, line editor, layout and typography, interior and color production, print buying, art direction, sales manager, director of marketing, and playtesters (these last in even finer print). But these are mostly for the company, and, if for the volume, pretty much invisible. For those reasons, and because I don’t want to be here all day, I’m not going to talk about the fine print people.\n\nInstead, let’s talk about those creatives. The credited author, James Cambias, is a native of New Orleans later based in western Massachusetts. He wrote numerous other role-playing game guides and other RPG materials from the mid-1990s onward, primarily for Steve Jackson Games and Last Unicorn Games, and has been a professional speculative fiction writer since 2000—mostly of short stories, but since 2014 of novels as well. His work has been nominated for the Tiptree Award, Locus Award, John W. Campbell Memorial Award, Compton Crook Award, and Kurt Lasswitz Prize; he himself was nominated for the 2001 John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer. At some point, one suspects, he may win something.\n\nEditor Sean Barrett (b. 1959), also known as Shawn Douglas Barrett, has lived in Alabama, New York, Washington state, and California. His field is nucleonics, in connection with which he has worked on the atomic submarine USS Ohio and been senior health physicist on the Three Mile Island Unit Two Recovery Team. Slumming in the RPG field, he authored GURPS Lensman: Starkly Astounding Space-Opera Adventure (2001), based on the works of E. E. “Doc” Smith, and GURPS Best of Pyramid, Volume 1 (also 2001), in addition to serving as Cambias’s editor here. He is also an Oz scholar, having contributed to The Baum Bugle, and is a former member of the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee.\n\nAs for the volume’s artists, Dan Smith (who signs his work SMIF) is well known for his RPG art. In the wider world of SF art, the Internet Speculative Fiction shows a number of credits for him from the 1993-1999 period. Per Wikipedia, Smith “has a variety of illustration styles [and h]is black-and-white work for GURPS became so prominent in the 1990s, he became the unofficial ‘house artist.’” He produced the majority of this book’s illustrations—unfortunately, often in the “style” of another guy entirely, comic artist Mike Mignola. He directly ripped off some of Mignola’s art from Epic Comics’s 1990-91 adaptations of Fritz Leiber’s Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories (now available in an omnibus from Dark Horse Comics). Smith alters Mignola’s images to the Krishnan context, but the originals can be easily identified. Only steal from the best, I guess. YouTuber blackraptor311 broke this story back in 2016, and you can find his video on YouTube.\n\nTerry Tidwell is an engineer, cartoonist and comic book artist native to Oklahoma. In addition to GURPS Planet Krishna, he contributed interior art to GURPS Magic Z (1989), GURPS Supers, 2nd ed. (1991), GURPS Basic Set, 3rd ed. (1992), and GURPS Space, 2nd ed. (1993). He has worked for Marvel, DC, and other comic book companies, drawing characters like Conan and the Green Hornet. His own comics include The Twilight Avenger and The Uncanny Man Frog. He has one credit in the ISFdb, for the cover art to Michael Vance’s The Thief of Two Worlds (2014). It’s of Albert Einstein, based on the famous “tongue out” photo.\n\nArthur Roberg seems to have done no GURPS work except for this volume; he is credited by the ISFdb with the cover of the September 2001 Asimov’s Science Fiction, and that of Bad News from Orbit (2004), a collection of short stories by Ken Rand. Elsewhere, like, on the web, this guy is all over the place as a general artist and other things, but since I’m not sure all those Arthur Robergs are the same guy and it would be exhausting to try to bring it all together, I’m not going to. Sorry.\n\nCarol Scavella, also known as C. Scavella Burrell, Carol M. Scavella Burrell, Carol M. Burrell, and Carol Burrell, is not just one of the artists, but one of those fine print people I wasn’t going to talk about, as she also appears there as one of two people responsible for art direction. (interestingly, under one of her alternative names, Carol M. Burrell). Kind of assuming Burrell is her married name. Anyway, away from GURPS, she’s a children’s book editor, videogame designer, RPG art director, and creator of the webcomic SPQR Blues. This gal does stuff! She also edited Abyss & Apex from 2004-2005, authored a couple spec fic short stories around the same time, and wrote the “Is That a Fact?” book Did Greek Soldiers Really Hide Inside the Trojan Horse? And Other Questions About the Ancient World (2010)—which, crazily, was illustrated by someone else!\n\nCartographer Ann Dupuis is a game designer who designed or contributed to numerous GURPS and Dungeons & Dragons publications and helped develop the Fudge RPG system, to which she later acquired the copyright, releasing games for it through her own company, Grey Ghost Press. GGP’s Deryni Adventure Game, based on the fantasy series by Katherine Kurtz, was nominated for the 2006 Origins Award for Role-Playing Game of the Year. Dupuis is also a certified pro dog trainer, and, yes, she has a company for that, too. Her maps in this book are useful, and the ones not appearing elsewhere are welcome additions to those previously known.\n\nAs a group, the interior artists contribute mostly unremarkable but adequate work to GURPS Planet Krishna. Some, like Freas, buy into the bald Krishnan theory and some the notion that female Krishnans typically go topless. (Both half-truths; only male Krishnans of the planet’s Antarctic regions shave their heads, and only (some) females of the tropics doff their tops—it has to do with local fashion and climate.)\n\nTime to go into the content. First, introductory matter, including the “Introduction” proper (with bits about the de Camps, the author and GURPs, as well as a list of works in the Viagens Interplanetarias series) and “The Krishna Stories” (de Camp’s contribution, though unattributed in the contents). It does what introductory material is supposed to do.\n\nThe meat of the book, made up of seven numbered sections, follows. The sections are worth detailing individually.\n\nThe Viagens Interplanetarias Universe. Here we are introduced to the future interstellar setting, with something on its history and background; how the former great powers were eclipsed by Brazil, information on the World Federation, the Viagens Interplanetarias organization itself, the Interplanetary Council, the various local star systems and their planets, and developments in technology, space travel, medicine and such. Dupuis’s Map of Nearby Stars accompanies this section.\n\nThe World of Krishna, A survey of the primary Viagens setting; the book is called Planet Krishna, after all. Details on the world, its moons, and its sister worlds Vishnu and Ganesha. A lot of details on the technological embargo and its rules. Local technology and weaponry, and how they have developed locally as Krishnans attempt to develop their own responses to advanced offworld tech. Like those “railways” with their Bishtar-drawn coaches! Culture and customs, writing systems and literature, religions, law, even a bit of history. Supplemented by Dupuis’s Map of Krishna, based on de Camp’s original. (It’s actually just of the Triple Seas region, where most of the action is set. But then, so was de Camp’s.)\n\nPlaces to Go. This gives you the two cent tour of settings on Krishna, starting with Novorecife Spaceport and continuing through the native nations; cities and other local settings are generally addressed within the entries for the nations in which they are found, the odd special cases like the Free City of Majbur and the Sunqar aside. So if you want to find out about Ruz you will find it in the entry for Gosashtand; if Zanid catches your fancy, it’s in the entry for Balhib. The Dupuis maps of Novorecife and The City of Zanid (this last based on de Camp’s original) appear here in the appropriate places.\n\nCharacters. A section devoted primarily to RPG purposes. This is not the section to find out about actual characters from the stories, but rather a guide to generating new characters to be role-played by prospective gamers. Possible professions are outlined for human character types, Krishnans, Osirians and natives of other planets, together with such additional factors to consider as economics and equipment. Discussions of non-human intelligent species also go into their unique biological characteristics and abilities.\n\nPeople to Meet. Characters for the rest of us; that is, the material you would have expected to find in Section 4, if you’re here for the guide to Krishna rather than as a gamer. This one has entries on actual characters from the books, such as Terran officials (Herculeo Castanhoso and the like), other Terrans (mostly protagonists like Dirk Barnevelt and Fergus Reith, but with some secondary characters as well), important Krishnans, like Queen Alvandi, Prince Ferrian, Gorbovast, and Yuruzh, and a few important aliens. For fans who want to know what some of them look like, we also get portraits of Chief of Security Cristovao Abreu, Judge Ram Keshavachandra, Alicia Dyckman-Reith, Percy Mjipa, and Commandante Georges Planquette.\n\nKrishnan Bestiary. Entries on the numerous animal species of Krishna, classed according to whether they are land animals, water creatures, or vermin. Need to tell an Aya from a Shomal from a Yeki? This is where you go. The faunal survey is rounded out by a brief survey of the planet’s flora, or plant life.\n\nCampaigning. Another section primarily devoted to the book’s RPG function, this time to working up gaming scenarios. But well worth reading, even if you have no intention of doing that, for its deep dive into conditions on Krishna anyone venturing there, whether as a game master, player, person within the Viagens universe, or reader, would need to contend with. The different periods in the planet’s recent history are discussed, together with the divergent challenges they feature. Topics covered include technology smuggling and legitimate trade, tourism, contending for power or simply blending in, diplomacy, war, and expeditions that might be mounted for one purpose or another. Some sample gaming scenarios and outlines of possible adventures are presented along the way.\n\nThe book is topped off with three concluding sections, unnumbered. A “Timeline of Krishna” leads off, based on a similar chronology that was part of de Camp’s original version of “The Krishna Stories,” but updated to incorporated subsequent stories and events. Next comes a “Glossary and Encyclopedia of Krishna,” handily listing unfamiliar words and terms and places (recapitulating “Places to Go,” but briefly). Finally, there’s the “Index,” which brings together the page references to each of the scattered names and topics and such that you probably expected to find in one place, but didn’t. It’s helpful.\n\nRegarding the text in general, it’s an open question at times as to how much of the data provided is de Camp-sourced and how much is Cambias extrapolating. All I can say is, where I’ve been able to check Cambias against the stories, he’s generally accurate; other material, such as the geometric basis of Nyamezde architecture, may not be as well-founded. Cambias’s Krishnan chronology departs in some respects both from de Camp’s original version and evidence internal to the stories. (But then, even de Camp’s version departed from the stories in at least one instance, putting “Calories” much too early.) Plainly, the Cambias “Bible” must be taken with a grain of salt. “Trust but verify,” as the saying goes.\n\nOne peculiar fault is Cambias’s failure to realize that de Camp’s two Kukulkan novels belong to the Viagens series, even though The Venom Trees of Sunga (1992), the second and last of them, was published some five years prior to the GURPS book. I can relate to the confusion, as only a single reference to Krishna in Venom Trees ties the Kukulkans to the other stories, Plus, Kukulkan is stated to be a planet in the Epsilon Eridani system, which contradicts previous series lore naming that system’s planets for Norse gods rather than Mayan. De Camp really nodded on this one. Perhaps Cambias just threw up his hands on the discrepancy—assuming he even knew of it. You don’t have to explain away conflicting data if you’re ignorant of it! Still… he consulted with the de Camps on his book. So he ought to have known of, and covered, the Kukulkan novels.\n\nAnother problem is that information retrieval can sometimes be difficult, as the text isn’t entirely linear; the sections split it up topically, and even within sections some features run alongside the main text as sidebars. A cluttered design that shoehorns in illustrations wherever there’s the least bit of space makes everything look jammed together. Not to mention all the gaming stats, which to my mind distract from character entries. From a reference standpoint, a straight alphabetic, encyclopedic approach would have served the material better.\n\nSuch caveats aside, GURPS Planet Krishna is an invaluable work of reference—I would even say an irreplaceable resource. You should be able to find whatever you’re looking for in it if you’re attentive enough. Want to find out more about Zir, Zinjaban, or Herculeu Castanhoso, without flipping through half a dozen books? Or more about the conquests of the dreaded hordes of Qaath? Want a better idea about the setting? Refresh your mind on the finer points of Varastou culture or the planets and alien races of Viagens space? It’s all here (Kukulkan aside). And if you want to run an RPG campaign on Krishna, then this is absolutely the book for you!\n\nThis book carries no dedication. Likely none was contemplated, but if it was, I truly believe there’s no remaining space in which they could possibly have wedged one. That said, author Cambias does make some acknowledgements in his “About the Author” statement on page 4, stating “[t]his book could never have been written without the help and encouragement of Sean Barrett, Diane Kelly, Joel Furr and Rob Furr,” and that “[t]he patience and assistance of L. Sprague de Camp and Catherine Crook de Camp were indispensable.” I should probably elucidate the references to Kelly and the Furrs here, but … don’t really want to. Kind of tired after talking up all those artists!\n\nIncidentally, there’s one other GURPS book of de Campian interest – GURPS Conan (1989), by Curtis M. Scott. It features a de Camp introduction, “Conan the Mighty” —a brief two page resume of Robert E. Howard’s fictional Hyborian Age, the career of Conan, the life and writing career of Howard, and the posthumous fortunes of his creation. One might expect the inescapable “A Probable Outline of Conan’s Career,” in one of its dozens of iterations, to have appeared there as well, but it didn’t, for a change. Though it was drawn on, both in the de Camp intro and the entries in the book. SJG also produced four shorter GURPS Conan books featuring individual campaigns rather than the setting. Unlike Planet Krishna, all the GURPS Conans remain available, digitally. Evidently because, SJG retained the license for them, unlike the de Camp volume.\n\n#\n\nAn earlier version of this review appeared on the L. Sprague de Camp- Enchanter of the Quill Facebook group on April 17, 2020.\n\nby Steve Replogle\n\nWhen Swords of the North was published in 2014, it marked the first time that all of Howard’s writings about Turlogh Dubh O’Brien were published under one cover. Before this a collector had to scramble regarding Turlogh. I still remember my feeling of surprise in 1977 when Zebra published The Sword Woman with “The Shadow of the Hun.” Here was a new Turlogh O’Brien tale! I had no idea that it even existed!\n\nThere have been a few well-written critical pieces about the Turlogh stories, but they are not always easy to find. The notable Howard scholar Joe Marek has a webpage, “Turlogh Dubh of the clan na O’Brien,” and it’s a very good resource. Marek covers the historical background of ancient Ireland, the character of Turlogh as envisioned by Howard, and the chronological order of the stories and fragments. Unfortunately, his review is unfinished – as is the webpage in general. My guess is that it was left unfinished sometime in 1999 or 2000. But it still makes for excellent reading. In his post, Marek praises another essay about Turlogh by Damon C. Sasser, titled “Echoes from Bal-Sagoth” and printed in REH: Two-Gun Raconteur #4, Summer 1977.\n\nMarek’s work can still be read at https://www.angelfire.com/tx3/robertehoward/turlogh1.html. Sasser’s essay is not available online, unfortunately. Like so many good pieces written over the decades, Sasser’s work only survives in the home libraries of collectors who have held onto their copies. 1977 was a long time ago!\n\nSasser’s article offers a thorough description of Turlogh’s character. Sasser writes: “Whether Turlogh is in a berserker rage slaying men like a bloody reaper of Death, or if he is waxing philosophically on the fates of man and civilization, he is a powerful character that seems to leap off the page and into full-blown life.” Then Sasser presents a detailed overview of each of the Turlogh stories, as well as their publication history. He then argues his case for how the stories should be organized in sequence.\n\nThe Turlogh O’Brien stories comprise one of Howard’s smaller or shorter series. It brings us only three complete stories, an unfinished story, a fragment of another story, and a long, long poem. This is perhaps not as short a run as Cormac Fitzgeoffrey or Agnes de Chastillon with their three stories each. But it is certainly no match for the stories of Kull, Solomon Kane, El Borak, or Conan (of course).\n\nTurlogh’s stories are relatively easy to arrange. Chronologically, his series begins with the Battle of Clontarf, presented in either “The Spears of Clontarf” or “The Grey God Passes.” After playing a supporting but notable role there, Turlogh takes center stage in three of his own stories, sequentially told: “The Dark Man, “The Gods of Bal-Sagoth,” and “The Shadow of the Hun.” There is also a fragment, a beginning of a story that is commonly identified by its first line “The Dane came in with a rush…” The chronological placement of this fragment is not so easy, although the setting is in Ireland, so it could take place before “The Dark Man,” or soon after. Finally, there is “The Ballad of King Geraint.” This poem could be categorized as a historical adventure, but Turlogh’s participation in it is clearly ahistorical. The real King Geraint died in the year 710, whereas Howard’s Turlogh was a young man at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, three hundred years later.\n\nHowardian scholar Joe Marek builds upon Damon Sasser’s work to put forth a strong case for Turlogh’s chronology. Marek’s chronology, incorporating Sasser’s views, goes like this…\n\nThe Grey God Passes/The Spears of Clontarf\n\nUntitled (“The Dane came…”)\n\nThe Dark Man\n\nSecond Flashback from The Shadow of the Hun – Turlogh captains a Danish galley he renames Crom’s Hate\n\nFirst flashback from The Shadow of the Hun – Turlogh among the Turgoslavs near the Caspian Sea\n\nThe Gods of Bal-Sagoth\n\nPrologue from The Shadow of the Hun\n\nThe Ballad of King Geraint\n\nMarek’s chronology is sensible, although not ironclad. The two flashbacks from “The Shadow of the Hun” could be placed before “The Dark Man,” and the untitled fragment could be placed after. My bias is for “The Dark Man” and “The Gods of Bal-Sagoth” to be next to each other chronologically. But it is true that Howard states – explicitly – that three years have passed between the end of “The Dark Man” and the beginning of “Bal-Sagoth.” These are years when Turlogh could have captained a ship to harry the Danes. It is a time when he could have wandered in the Caucasus and central Asia.\n\n“The Ballad of King Geraint,” as I noted above, is more tricky. Joe Marek places it at the end of the series, after all the other stories. Unfortunately, his post about Turlogh does not extend that far, ending after his review of “The Dark Man.” I’d like to know how he saw the poem. Did he consider it an ahistorical footnote to the main series? Did he think of it as a true epilogue, not historical, but a fitting conclusion? There is support for either argument.\n\nThis leads me to a favorite game among Howard fans, the imaginary book. Turlogh Dubh O’Brien has never been featured in a book of his own. Frankly, it is way overdue. Here is how I think such a book could be arranged.\n\nThe Grey God Passes\n\nThe Dark Man\n\nThe Gods of Bal-Sagoth\n\nThe Shadow of the Hun\n\nUntitled (“The Dane came…”)\n\nThe Cairn on the Headland\n\nThe Ballad of King Geraint (Turlogh excerpts only)\n\nOther Poetry (perhaps)\n\nI think “The Grey God Passes” is superior to “The Spears of Clontarf,” although I suppose a good editor might incorporate certain passages from “Clontarf” to make for a better, or at least bigger, story. Then again, that is the sort of posthumous collaboration that some Howard fans find objectionable, so maybe it is better to leave “Spears” out entirely. In my imaginary book, I would place “Untitled” after “The Shadow of the Hun,” because the unfinished nature of the fragment fits well, thematically, with the several unfinished episodes in that story.\n\nI’d include “The Cairn on the Headland” because it revisits Brian Boru, the Battle of Clontarf, and the enmity of Odin. There is no hint of Turlogh O’Brien, but the story offers a modern reflection on the central historical event of this series. It’s a satisfying story, a good way to end.\n\nAlthough, in my book, this isn’t quite the end. I’d include “The Ballad of King Geraint” as a thematic conclusion. I would not include it as a continuation of the other Turlogh stories, because I think that is too much of a stretch. It gives us a time-crossed Turlogh, the same man but in a different era, the same man but one who has been transported into an alternative timeline. Perhaps we could think that he’s like Kull in “Kings of the Night.”\n\nAnd I wouldn’t include the entire poem either, just the passages about Turlogh. That is still substantial – about 1,000 words, depending on how you edit it.\n\nA case could also be made for more of Howard’s poems to be included – “The Marching Song of Connacht,” “The Song of the Last Briton,” “Song Before Clontarf,” a few others. The recent edition of Clark Ashton Smith’s The Averoigne Chronicles positioned a poem in between each story to good effect. It would be easy to use that same method to organize this imaginary collection.\n\nThinking along these lines brings me back to reality, back to real books in the real world. After all, Swords of the North includes all the poetry and all the Turlogh stories. It even has the entirety of “The Ballad of King Geraint.” It is not Turlogh in a separate, dedicated volume, but it does have everything.\n\nI do wonder sometimes how a posthumous collaborator might handle the unfinished stories. It would be challenging, that’s for sure. “The Shadow of the Hun” starts over twice, maybe three times. I know such collaborations sometimes fail and can be overwhelmingly awkward and embarrassing. But there are some that I have found successful and satisfying. I liked Richard Tierney’s work on “Tigers of the Sea” and “Hawks of Outremer,” and I thought Andrew J. Offutt did well with “Nekht Semerkeht.” I also appreciated Lin Carter’s work on King Kull. I thought some of the posthumous collaborations by Carter and de Camp for Conan, based upon Howard’s fragments or outlines, were very good. Of course, they are not quite equal to Howard’s own work, but several came close.\n\nThese views may place me in a minority of Howard’s fans, but I think we all agree that the stories of Turlogh O’Brien are thrilling and satisfying. I believe when the next “Howard Boom” comes, a separate volume for Turlogh Dubh could very likely be among the new publications. I imagine it will indeed be an enjoyable book, a welcome addition to the canon, and greeted with enthusiasm by Howard’s many readers.\n\nHere are the best sites for information, analysis, or conjectures about Turlogh Dubh, aka Black Turlogh O’Brien. Most Howard fans will have come across some of these sites before, but they are included here for the sake of completeness. There may be one or two that are new to readers.\n\nThe World of Robert E.

Howard and the Heroic Tradition\n\nAnother valuable DMR posting, comparing “The Spears of Clontarf” and “The Grey God Passes.”\n\nhttps://dmrbooks.com/test-blog/2019/1/21/robert-e-howard-and-the-heroic-tradition\n\nby Steve Replogle\n\nMany of Robert E. Howard’s readers are fascinated by the stories of Turlogh Dubh, or Black Turlogh O’Brien. Perhaps this is because of the power of “The Dark Man,” a Turlogh O’Brien story that has always been seen as one of Howard’s finest tales. It may also be that readers are intrigued by the unfinished writings about Turlogh. All Howard’s heroes have such fragments attached to their narratives, and many are intriguing. Turlogh O’Brien is no different. Turlogh, however, is one of the very few Howard heroes to never receive a complete book collection of his own. And while virtually every other unfinished story by Howard has been completed by posthumous collaborators, the two unfinished Turlogh stories have remained untouched.\n\nUntil recently it’s been a challenge to find all the Turlogh stories. They have rarely been collected together. This was true even when Arkham House published a book in 1963 that took its title from a Turlogh O’Brien story. It was The Dark Man and Others and the “others” included “The Gods of Bal-Sagoth,” a direct sequel to “The Dark Man.” But the other Turlogh stories were nowhere to be found.\n\nThose other pieces were either unfinished (such as “Shadow of the Hun”) or existed in variant forms (as with “The Spears of Clontarf,” revised as “The Grey God Passes”). It may have been against Arkham House’s policy at that time to include unfinished work in their books. It wasn’t until the 1970’s that publishers realized fans wanted to read everything Howard wrote, finished or not. This shift was perhaps supported by the growth of fan publications, such as Glenn Lord’s The Howard Collector, which often featured Howard’s unfinished work. It may have even been encouraged by the widespread success of The Lord of the Rings, which included many tantalizing references to adventures and characters from the First and Second Ages of Middle-Earth.\n\nOne narrative featuring Turlogh wasn’t even known until the late 1980’s. That’s when the long poem “The Ballad of King Geraint” was published.\n\nHere are all of Turlogh’s stories – and the one poem – in order of their first publication.\n\nThe Gods of Bal-Sagoth in Weird Tales, October 1931\n\nThe Dark Man in Weird Tales, December 1931\n\nThe Grey God Passes in Dark Mind, Dark Heart, Arkham House, 1962\n\nThe Shadow of the Hun and Untitled (“The Dane came…”) in The Shadow of the Hun, George Hamilton, 1975\n\nThe Spears of Clontarf in The Spears of Clontarf, George Hamilton, 1978\n\nThe Ballad of King Geraint in The Ballad of King Geraint, Gibbelins Gazette Press, 1989\n\nThere are some interesting points to remember when reviewing this information. For example, it was odd that Farnsworth Wright ran “The Gods of Bal-Sagoth” in Weird Tales before he published “The Dark Man.” “Bal-Sagoth,” as noted above, is a direct sequel to “The Dark Man” and even refers to specific incidents in that story. Another point: three of the Turlogh O’Brien stories were first seen in alternative publications, not well-known outside of the comparatively limited circle of REH fandom. George Hamilton published two in his excellent series of chapbooks, and “King Geraint” was first published in a chapbook limited to 70 copies (!) that were distributed in REHUPA #100.\n\nThe first editions of the Hamilton chapbooks were likewise from small print runs. “The Shadow of the Hun” was limited to 318 copies, and “The Spears of Clontarf” was about half that number, at 152 copies.\n\nTurlogh Dubh’s bibliography can be complicated. “The Spears of Clontarf” was first written as straight historical fiction, then revised with added fantasy elements as “The Grey God Passes.” This story was republished as “The Passing of the Grey God” and also as “The Twilight of the Grey Gods” (in Eons of the Night, Baen, 1996). It was adapted in the Marvel comic Conan the Barbarian #3 as “Twilight of the Grim Grey God” (1971) – yet another title. That’s four title variations in all! Howard also rewrote the actual story a third time, as a modern horror tale, titled “The Cairn on the Headland.” Turlogh is neither present nor mentioned in the story, but many details of the Battle of Clontarf are revisited. The protagonist is James O’Brien, an Irish-American researcher; he may just possibly be a distant relative of Turlogh himself.\n\nIn either version, “The Spears of Clontarf” as well as “The Grey God Passes,” Turlogh O’Brien is not the main character, but present in a supporting role, a brother-in-arms to the protagonist, Conn. Turlogh’s appearances may be limited, but he is still a striking figure. There is much about him that seems fully realized, and it is easy to see why Howard would follow this character into other adventures. This is true in “The Ballad of King Geraint,” too. This work is quite long, about 7,000 words in 1,000 lines. Turlogh appears in it just as we have known him from the stories, both finished and unfinished. He is a man apart, grim and moody; he has a philosophical turn of mind. He is a fierce fighter. As at the Battle of Clontarf from “Spears/Grey God,” he is one of the few survivors.\n\nHoward found an enigmatic character in Turlogh O’Brien, and he was enthusiastic about writing adventures set in that time period. In 1930, Howard wrote to Tevis Clyde Smith: “I have created a new character to join Kull, Solomon Kane and Steve Costigan. His name is Turlogh Dubh O’Brien and I hope to have a series of stories dealing with him in the new magazine. This story was, of course, about him. He is an Irish outlaw whose adventures are laid in the half century preceding the battle of Hastings. That’s a period teeming with intrigue, war and battles and I ought to be able to spin dozens of yarns about it.”\n\nThe three primary stories, “Dark Man,” “Bal-Sagoth,” and “Shadow of the Hun” are so closely connected that they could easily be read as respective chapters in a novel. “The Dark Man” ends with Turlogh sparing the life of Athelstane the Saxon, and “The Gods of Bal-Sagoth” begins with the two men meeting again. At the end of that story, after their adventure on Bal-Sagoth, the warriors are once more at sea, and are taken aboard a ship under the command of the Spaniard, Don Roderigo del Cortez. “The Shadow of the Hun” begins with these three men – Cortez, Athelstane, and Turlogh – onboard the now-becalmed ship, talking about their travels and their past battles.\n\nThe continuity of this sequence is clear and closely-knit, more than any other story-cycle by Howard, with the exception perhaps of the stories of Breckenridge Elkins. But Howard did not easily find the right tone as he took Turlogh from one story to the next. The stories shift from genre to genre. Here is another overview that shows those changes:\n\nThe Spears of Clontarf – historical adventure\n\nThe Grey God Passes – fantasy, featuring Eevin, a woman of the mystical De Danaan, as well as Valkyries and the Viking god, Odin\n\nThe Dark Man – historical adventure with fantasy undertones\n\nThe Gods of Bal-Sagoth – a lost race adventure, with fantasy elements such as a large and carnivorous saurian bird, apemen, and powerful kind of hypnosis used by the villain\n\nThe Shadow of the Hun – historical adventure\n\nUntitled (“The Dane came…”) – historical adventure\n\nThe Ballad of King Geraint – historical adventure\n\nIt may be that “The Shadow of the Hun,” had it been completed, would have included fantasy elements. As the series stands, it seems that Howard never found the right genre for this character. Furthermore, the final story in the sequence, “The Shadow of the Hun” is a story that opens into a first and then even a second flashback – before ending without a conclusion. It seems as if Howard is having trouble settling into one plot.\n\nIn 1933, Howard wrote a well-known letter to Clark Ashton Smith about the Conan stories. In this excerpt, he discusses inspiration, and the experience of inspiration fading away.\n\nThis seems to be what happened with Turlogh O’Brien, and it may be that a reader can even see this process in the plot twists (or dangling plot threads) of “The Shadow of the Hun.” It is as though Howard is trying to follow the voice of his character, which begins clearly enough but then grows more and more faint. Eventually, Howard cannot hear him at all… and Turlogh is gone.\n\nSteve Replogle is a public-school teacher from Denver, Colorado. Steve is married to a Jungian psychoanalyst, and they share two grown kids and two grandchildren. His discovery of Lancer’s Conan of Cimmeria was one of the most profound and influential moments in his reading life. Other favorite authors include Sprague de Camp, Fritz Leiber, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Tanith Lee.\n\nby Terry Allen\n\nFirstly, how did an Englishman and his wife Kay, who does all the hard work getting us here, find themselves in the middle of nowhere in Texas?\n\nQuick history lesson. As a Marvel Comics reader I discovered Conan in the early 1970’s, moved on to the Conan books, being reprinted by Sphere in the UK, and also found that other Howard characters were being reprinted over here. Considering myself a Conan fan at first at the time I read the pastiches until Jordan’s put me off. Carried on reading the comics, well only the ones Roy Thomas was writing. In 1999 we bought our first computer and found various Howard Groups and found talk of something called Howard Days.\n\nFor any first-time travelers to the US a few tips. Visitors from the UK, and many other countries, apply for an ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization) prior to travelling. This allows you to travel to the US without a Visa. We have always found entry into the US easy, even the year after 9/11. The odd baggage check/pat down like anywhere, though I imagine the prospect of the full body scan can feel intrusive for some.\n\nFirst time driving out of the airport can be stressful, on the wrong side of the road in an automatic (in the UK stick driving is more common) especially if your Sat Nav isn’t working properly – been there! UK airports are usually outside the city. In the Dallas and Austin airports you find yourself suddenly on multi lane highways trying to get out of the cities. Once out though driving can be pleasant, miles of roads to get used to and not expensive as petrol/gas is around 4 to 5 times cheaper in the US than the UK!!!!!\n\nYou don’t need thousands of $’s in cash. Even if you don’t use one at home, shop around for a Travel Credit Card. They usually don’t charge a fee for use overseas – and they often offer excellent exchange rates. They may charge higher interest rates, but as long as you pay the balance off in full and on time each month, they can be an ideal option for holidays. Even then, with the growth of the Internet over the last 25 years, you can pre-book up nearly everything yourself without the need of a Travel Agent, flights – external and internal, car rental, hotel bookings etc. all the way through to booking a cottage in Cross Plains or, of course, registering for Howard Days.\n\nWe started visiting the US in 2000 and in 2006 made our first visit to Cross Plains, tagging it on at the end of our holiday. It was a surreal feeling driving in and seeing that Cross Plains sign and being welcomed by various folks I’d only “spoken” to online. Roy Thomas being GoH was a bonus, but the most inspiring time was spent talking to Glenn Lord. Dennis McHaney said we must come back within 5 years, but it ended up 10 in 2016 and this time we were welcomed as old friends rather than newbies.\n\nPlans were made to come back again for the cancelled 2020 event, and though 2021 went ahead we weren’t able to fly in from the UK. But finally, as other plans had been made for ’22 & ‘ 23, we returned this year.\n\nWe left Heathrow around midday on the Wednesday before Howard Days, landing in Austin late afternoon local time and after managing a few hours’ sleep picked up the car Thursday morning and we set off. First stop being Fort McKavett an American Civil War post best known to Howard fans as a site of one of Bob’s iconic photographs. After some wandering around we found, with the help of Rob Roehm’s Howard’s Haunts book, “the spot” and I had my photo took standing in the footsteps of a giant. After driving round the Texas countryside, we had lost wi-fi, we finally managed to get back on track towards Brownwood, visiting both Novalyne Price Ellis’ gravesite at Clear Creek and Bob’s at Brownwood Cemetaries to pay our respects. Then, after a call at Walmart to stock up on essentials – water, wine and beer, headed to Cross Plains.\n\nIt was a great feeling driving into town again, we stayed at one of the new Cottages in Cross Plains and after unpacking headed out to eat. Had a nice meal at Jean’s Feed Barn and then walked down to the Howard House. There were a few folks there and we were greeted with enthusiasm by Bill Cavalier and Mark Finn, and Bobby Derie gave us this year’s book on Novalyne’s Letters he’d prepared for attendees this year.\n\nFriday morning arrived with coffee and donuts at the Pavillion as we signed in and met old and new acquaintances. Toured the house, such a feeling being there again and actually being able to sit at the newly found desk recently returned to the house. Decided not to go on the bus tour of the area, we’d done it both times previously, and went into town to visit the library checking out the books and typescripts there, I bought a facsimile copy of “Sword Woman,” then onto the Cross Plains Review where they had a pair of boxing gloves on display supposedly owned by Bob.\n\nPicked up a couple of books, Letters Vol.3 and Post Oaks & Sand Roughs, thanks to John Bullard and Paul Herman. Then the first panel of the day at the Methodist Church, I won’t go into details as they’re now up on YouTube but it was nice to see Chuck Hoffmann on the 50th Anniversary of his groundbreaking essay on Conan on the panel.\n\nAfter the hot dog lunch at the Pavillion we attended two more panels, Rob Roehm’s about the places Bob visited and the Glenn Lord Symposium talking about Bob as a Southwestern writer, both fascinating followed by the REH Foundation Awards (congratulations to Gary and the other winners).\n\nThen we were off again to the Community Centre for the Silent Auction, we didn’t win, and the Banquet with Rob Roehm as GoH. As we sat outside, when the auction winners were picking up their goodies, we had the pleasure of dog sitting one of the attendees’ husky, Curv, a lovely dog that had us thinking of our boys at home. Final event of the night was listening to the Fists at the Pavillion boxing reading by Mark Finn, Chris Gruber and Jeff Shanks even if we were being attacked by massive Texas mosquitos!!!!\n\nAfter losing count of our bites Saturday morning , we met some other intrepid folks for the walking tour of Cross Plains at the Ice House on a very hot morning being led by Jack Baum who was certainly more used to the heat than some of us! Next was the REH in Pop Culture panel with Jim Zub and John Hocking. I’d had to buy another copy of Jim’s Conan #1 from one of the dealers for Jim to sign , as somehow I’d left my copy at home. Great to hear how committed Jim is to Heroic/Titan’s plans for Howard’s characters in the new comics and John finally having his Conan sequel published after so many years waiting.\n\nThe final panel of the weekend was discussing another two of Howard’s popular characters, El Borak and Breckenridge Elkins, then it was back to the Pavillion for the sunset barbeque and poetry reading in front of REH’s window. I managed to pluck up the courage to read Cimmeria, and although the microphone didn’t seem to be working too well, while also fighting the traffic noise and the wind causing me problems with the page, I was pleased I decided to do it.\n\nThen it was time to say our goodbyes for the final time. It was a really great week-end again. Special thanks to the ladies of Project Pride for everything they did , and for what they do all year for visitors.\n\nFinal thoughts, if you’ve thought about visiting Howard Days you really should make the effort. If you think it’s a long way to go for a weekend, add it onto to a longer visit to Texas or elsewhere in the US. You really don’t know what you’re missing.\n\nby Brian Kunde\n\nMy de Camp highlight under review this time around is The Enchanter Completed: A Tribute Anthology for L. Sprague de Camp. Now that’s a mouthful! This is another one not actually by de Camp, but don’t let that stop you. Personally, I love this book, and if I didn’t love this book, I would still love the idea of it, as spelled out in the subtitle. Not all authors get these tributes, but Baen Books kind of specializes in them. Baen has also put out anthologies honoring Rudyard Kipling, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Poul Anderson, David Drake, and likely others that have either slipped my mind or I don’t know about.\n\nTechnically, such compilations are known as festschrift, if they honor living authors, and gedenkschrift, for deceased ones. German terms: the Germans have words for everything other languages haven’t thought of yet, which is also, incidentally, why you send your children to kindergarten. The Enchanter Completed is of the gedenk variety.\n\nThere was only one edition, the Baen Books paperback issued in May 2005. These sorts of books tend not to have long shelf lives, alas. The front cover, a gorgeous creation by Tom Kidd, is rather in the vein of the cover of de Camp’s own autobiography, in that it pictures our author surrounded by some of his creations. Or, rather, the creations of his tribute bearers, in this instance—note the garden gnomes, which will be encountered again in Laura Frankos’s contribution. The figure of de Camp himself also recalls the autobiography, as his likeness hearkens back to the same source, a photograph of the man taken at the wedding of his fan and friend Phillip Sawyer. It turns up fairly often, and bids fair to becoming the definitive de Camp portrait.\n\nThe back cover gives us the inevitable blurb. “Top authors” is a bit of an exaggeration, as the contributions mixed top authors with others of less renown. Most are recognizable, at least. And we get quotes from Heinlein and Asimov, who weren’t around to contribute. Had they been, they undoubtedly would have. Asimov in particular.\n\nHarry Turtledove edited this book, which is appropriate, since, as he tells anyone who will listen, reading de Camp’s Lest Darkness Fall gave him his start both as a scholar (of Byzantium) and an author. He tells us again in his personal contribution to this volume, “Sprague: An Introduction.” (He also contributes a story, as we will see later.) Robert Silverberg also gets a chance to gush, in the endpiece, “Sprague: An Afterword.” I’m sure there would have been more gushes included from more of de Camp’s contemporaries, had the opportunity not been foreclosed by him outliving most of them. Lin Carter, long dead, is the most notable missing voice, but there are many, many others. Their absence may account in part for the again (I’m sorry) less than stellar cast of contributors. Another reason may have been the fact that de Camp had been gone five years when the book came out, and hadn’t put out a book of his own for four before that. (There had been a posthumous collection or two.) So, inconceivable as it may seem to us, there could have been a certain amount of “de Camp who?” going on.\n\nDon’t get me wrong; most of the contributors are very good indeed, and some not of the first rank have risen higher since this book appeared in 2005. It’s just not the company you would expect. Some top names are there, but there are others not so top. A few of the authors got in the book, I suspect, either because they knew Turtledove or he knew them. Like Laura Frankos, who happens to be married to him. But nobody phoned in their contributions, and most rose to the occasion.\n\nSo, what’s in it, aside from Turtledove’s and Silverberg’s nonfiction bookend pieces? Mostly stories of the sort de Camp himself commonly wrote, or that followed up on stories he did write, or that were inspired by what he wrote. Let’s have a look at the authors and their stories\n\nDavid Drake (1945-2023) gives us a parallel world story in “A Land of Romance.” It’s okay, but not his best work; he’s known primarily for his military science fiction, and I confess most of his occasional fantasies haven’t done it for me. Nor did this one, which (very) faintly echoes the Shea tales in that it sends its protagonist into a fantasy world by scientific means. Had this appeared as a novel, back in the day, I would likely have read, enjoyed, and then promptly forgotten it. What makes Drake de Camp-appropriate? Well, he was a fan, most notably of “A Gun for Dinosaur,” which he paid the ultimate tribute of imitation in his own story “Time Safari.” And he counted de Camp as one of the authors “who most formed my view of what science fiction was” when he first started reading SF. He was even something of a de Camp scholar, writing, for instance, a 2005 article on the man’s earliest short story (“The Hairless Ones Come” for The New York Review of Science Fiction). And, finally, he was Baen Books’ go-to man whenever they wanted to reissue one of de Camp’s early short novels, and needed a thematically similar story as filler! I suspect this one may have been commissioned for the same purpose, only to end up here instead. Drake’s filler pieces being (literally) de Camp-adjacent, I should probably review them as a group some day…\n\nMichael F. Flynn (1947-2023) contributes “The Ensorcelled ATM.” Now this is more like it! You can’t fault Flynn for lacking ambition; he’s playing right in de Camp’s own backyard, as it’s both a Gavagan’s Bar story and a W. Wilson Newbury tale! Meaning Willy Newbury goes into a bar after a harrowing experience, and it just happens to be Gavagan’s, where of course the familiar patrons are all too happy to hear of his woes. It’s well done, though it gets a bit muddled towards the end. Could have used better editing. Not to knock Turtledove, but an outside eye might have helped ensure everything held together.\n\nJudith Tarr provides “Penthesilia,” about what happens when Alexander the Great meets some Amazons, and, more importantly, what happens to him in consequence after his death. Alternate history that could be actual history, were the real world amenable to a supernatural touch, or two. The de Campian angle here is simply that the Hellenistic era was a particular preoccupation of his, one in which he set several historical novels. And of course he himself made Alexander a character in both An Elephant for Aristotle and “Aristotle and the Gun.” Tarr’s tale doesn’t really have a de Campian feel, but you can’t have everything. Good story.\n\n“Ripples,” a short piece which may have taken its title from that of a 1980 poem by de Camp, is Richard Foss’s contribution. It’s a straight alternate history story one might expect to have found in one of those Alternate Whatever anthologies Mike Resnick was putting out back in the 90s. Specifically Alternate Tyrants, since this is a “what if” about Socrates becoming a tyrannical philosopher king of Athens and offhandedly defeating an assassination attempt by his old pupil Plato (who, amusingly, he barely recognizes). A good argument against philosopher kings, a concept ironically favored by the historical Plato. Which makes it a neat dig against Plato, too. Good one, though lacking the whimsical de Campian touch.\n\n“Gun, Not for Dinosaur” is a Reginald Rivers tale not by de Camp, but by Chris Bunch (1943-2005). You’ll recall one premise of the original “Gun” was that the timestream abhors paradox; also that it doesn’t permit time travel too near the traveler’s own time, when paradox might become unavoidable. But what if, as the time theorists learn more about the so-called fourth dimension, these seeming natural laws turn out to be not quite true? We find out as Rivers has to contend with an attempt to prematurely wipe out Australopithecus Afarensis, then regarded as a direct human ancestor. Appropriately for an African-based time trip, Beauregard Black really comes into his own in this one. Pitch perfect!\n\n“Father Figures,” by Susan Shwartz, is based on the interesting premise that the Harold Shea Syllogismobile formula was a true thing, except that it was actually devised by Pratt and de Camp themselves rather than their fictional Reed Chalmers and Harold Shea, that it was the authors who really made all those parallel world trips, and that Sprague continued the world jumping after Pratt passed, now in the company of his wife Catherine. But they aren’t the main characters in this story, which is in fact about one Emrys, an inhabitant of post-Roman Britain. We soon discover him to have been the original Merlin and we learn the difference that an encounter with Sprague and Catherine makes in his career. (For one thing, it makes it possible.) Another good one. A shame Shwartz wasn’t on board for the “Enchanter” shared world anthologies of the 90s; she’d have been great for it.\n\nDark fantasy author and long-time de Camp friend Darrell Schweitzer blesses the book with a new entry in his “Tom O’Bedlam” series, “Tom O’Bedlam and the Mystery of Love.” Very Schweitzerian and not at all de Campian, but had de Camp been given his choice, I’m sure he would have preferred to read a story in Schweitzer’s own style rather than one that tried to pastiche his. Possibly Schweitzer felt the same. In any event, a welcome contribution.\n\n“One for the Record” comes next, from Esther M. Friesner, who had a head start on capturing the de Camp tone, since much of her work is also in a whimsically humorous vein. That said, she writes a Friesner, not a de Camp, and it works quite nicely. It’s a club tale told by a rather snooty narrator, the club in question being rather pinched for funds, as we’re reminded a few too many times, and it ventures into mythic territory through the involvement of a certain Orpheus. Echoes of de Camp and Pratt’s Gavagan’s Bar tales here (and Dunsany’s Jorkens), without any direct referencing of them.\n\n“The Haunted Bicuspid” is by Harry Turtledove; small-scale fantasy of the sort de Camp often got published in Unknown early in his career. In this instance, involving a nineteenth-century fellow whose false teeth evidently included one harvested from the deceased Edgar Allen Poe, whose influence, melancholy and spirit seem to come along for the ride. There’s some wryness, but not a lot of humor; reads rather like a de Camp pastiche of Poe, while being, of course, a Turtledove pastiche of a de Camp pastiche of Poe. But perhaps I’m reading too much into it. It’s very much the sort of story Turtledove might have written anyway; maybe he just figured it fit here. Which it does.\n\n“Return to Xanadu,” by Lawrence Watt-Evans, is an unapologetic pastiche of Pratt and de Camp’s Harold Shea tales, though Shea does not appear therein. Rather, Watt-Evans explores the fate of Dunyazad, a minor character from the world of Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s “Kubla Khan,” which Shea and friends visited early on in The Castle of Iron. Who turns out to be in the wrong world herself; a beneficent wizard very reminiscent of de Camp sends her back where she belongs–the universe of The Arabian Nights. This one would slot nicely into the Harold Shea saga itself.\n\n“The Apotheosis of Martin Padway” follows, by S. M. Stirling, who accomplishes the impossible; a satisfying sequel to Lest Darkness Fall. (Though others have since duplicated the feat.) Set in Padway’s old age, it simultaneously provides us a look at the world he altered centuries later, from which (intentional) time travelers have come back to resolve the mysteries surrounding the mysterious historical figure known as St. Martin of Padua. The long-term success of his intervention is made manifest; the travelers are from what would in our own world be the tenth century. Extraordinarily satisfying in every way.\n\nNext, inevitably, comes the 1964 Frederik Pohl (1919-2013) story “The Deadly Mission of P. Snodgrass,” the only reprint, which originally appeared, I believe, as a Galaxy editorial. Pohl was still around, and could have provided something new, but honestly, what else could have been more appropriate? It always was, and always would be, the ultimate parry to Lest Darkness Fall. (Together with Poul Anderson’s 1956 story “The Man Who Came Early,” of course.)\n\nThen there’s Laura Frankos’s “The Garden Gnome Freedom Front.” A good story, with an amusing title, though this is another one that didn’t quite do it for me as a de Camp tribute. But perhaps she’s to be commended for going her own way with her own sort of story.\n\nFinally (except for Silverberg’s concluding afterword) we get “The Newcomers” by Poul Anderson (1926-2001). One of the biggest of big names, and a de Camp-influenced author who outdid his model. He notably contributed the introduction to the best de Camp collection, appropriately titled The Best of L. Sprague de Camp (1978). Anderson’s most de Campian tale was Three Hearts and Three Lions (1961, expanded from a 1953 novella), but there was much, much else—even a Conan pastiche novel! While deceased by the time this tribute volume was published, I gather it was gestating when he was still around, as his piece was a new one, a minor fantasy set in the world of his Cappen Varra character. An Anderson story is always a fun read, but I found nothing particularly special about this one. Really, “The Man Who Came Early” would have worked a lot better here. Or perhaps “House Rule,” or “The Barbarian,” or one of his Time Patrol stories.\n\nAnd speaking of Anderson, I am reminded of one more missing voice here, Anderson’s friend and sometime collaborator Gordon R. Dickson (1923-2001), who also penned some very de Campian tales over the years, such as the Hoka tales (with Anderson), and the 1957 classic “St. Dragon and the George” (which he turned into a highly successful fantasy novel in 1976 and expanded into a series of novels in the 1990s). But it would be unrealistic to have expected him to contribute, as he was gone himself by the time this tribute was put together. He outlived de Camp, but not by much.\n\nOn that somewhat down note, I conclude this exploration. Overall assessment? A bit uneven, but there’s some marvelous stuff here, and, as I said, much to love about this book. If you can find it and feel you would (like me) enjoy a last romp or two in de Camp’s world(s) that he’s no longer present to bring us, give it a read. You won’t be sorry.\n\nThere’s no dedication. Probably because the dedication’s really in the title.\n\nAn earlier version of this review appeared on the L. Sprague de Camp- Enchanter of the Quill Facebook group on April 11, 2020."
