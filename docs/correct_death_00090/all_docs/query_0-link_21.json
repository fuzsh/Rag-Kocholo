        "text": "by Brian Kunde\n\nToday’s de Camp highlight is The Heroic Age of American Invention (Doubleday, 1961). Its bibliographic history is simpler than most de Camp books. Aside from the original edition, there was a 1993 Barnes & Noble reissue, retitled The Heroes of American Invention, and a Portuguese translation titled A história secreta e curiosa das grandes invenções, literally “The Secret and Curious History of Great Inventions” (Rio de Janeiro, Lidador, 1964), which I mention of the sake of completeness. Not one I intend to collect, nor, I suspect, one many other non-Portuguese readers would, either.\n\nThe covers are all fine, and suitable to the content. The Doubleday dust cover has a black front panel filled with colorful pictures of inventors and inventions, and a white back panel featuring a big, grinning photo of de Camp and some of his writing and scientific bona fides.\n\nThe Barnes & Noble takes a similar tack, but in keeping with its titular refocus on personalities over devices plasters its brown-tinted inventor portraits on a field of light blue inventions, front and back. The front flap tells about the book and the back flap de Camp. Stephen Morse designed the jacket, and was presumably the artist as well.\n\nThe Lidador, reflecting its refocus, concentrates on the inventions alone, doubtless on the theory that North American faces would mean comparatively little to a South American audience, or at least would not be as much of a draw. We get light yellow, green and black contraptions (mostly boats, but with one gun) over a tan field.\n\nYou may note that the scan of the 1993 Barnes & Noble reissue, which is the copy I have, doesn’t have the “The” in it, as above. That’s because B&N dropped it from the dust cover (and, underneath the dust cover, even from the spine of the book). But it does appear on the title page, and since what you find on a book’s title page is considered the book’s standard title, the version of the title with the article is official. We library-types are nit-picky that way.\n\nThis is a characteristic science book for our author. When not dealing with literary topics, de Camp specialized in explicating science and pseudoscience in his nonfiction. The golden age of his science writing extended from the late 1950s into the early 1970s. Not that it was a sudden thing; he had been writing science articles a lot earlier, and would continue to do so. But this was when he came out with most of his science books. Historical science books, if we want to be technical, because the history (and occasional prehistory) of whatever subject he was covering was often as important as the subject itself, if not more so. Heroic Age is a typical instance.\n\nHis other books along these lines include Lands Beyond (with Willy Ley, 1952), Lost Continents (1954), Engines (1959), Man and Power(1961), Energy and Power (1962), The Ancient Engineers (1963), Ancient Ruins and Archaeology (1964), Elephant (1964), Spirits, Stars, and Spells (1966), The Story of Science in America (1967), The Day of the Dinosaur (1968), The Great Monkey Trial (1968), Darwin and His Great Discovery (1972), and Great Cities of the Ancient World (1972). He would return to the field in one of his last books, The Ape-Man Within (1995), and in such late career collections as The Ragged Edge of Science (1980), The Fringe of the Unknown (1983), and Rubber Dinosaurs and Wooden Elephants (1996).\n\nLike some of the others, Heroic Age was originally billed as being for young readers, though my reissue says nothing about that, and the designation needn’t be taken seriously. Several of his books (most notably Engines and Energy and Power) really were for children, but this one is as enjoyable to the adult reader as the juvenile, and not at all dumbed down.\n\nParenthetically, the late 1980s and early 1990s could be seen as a sort of silver age of de Camp’s science writing, as a fair number of his earlier volumes were reprinted around then. Barnes & Noble, which of course is primarily a chain of bookstores rather than a publisher, seems to have been looking for titles to reissue at reasonable prices to fill its bargain shelves. The firm plainly struck a deal with the de Camps, and the result was a small flood of cheap, quality hardcovers of the pair’s nonfiction backlist. I was introduced to a fair number of them myself this way. The present book being one.\n\nL. Sprague de Camp had a strong interest in invention, going all the way back to his first book, Inventions and Their Management (1937). That one was a sort of handbook for inventors on how to handle their innovations and see them safely through the patent process. Here, of course, he delves into the history of American invention, concentrating on the era when the role of the individual inventor counted for something. This period he defines as the period from the 1830s to the advent of World War I, incidentally. “But wait!” you might protest. “Weren’t there American inventors before that? And after? What about Benjamin Franklin? What about Steve Jobs?”\n\nWell, Jobs didn’t make his mark until after the book was published. But, point taken. There were, earlier and later American inventors, as de Camp would have been the first to admit. But innovation got off to a slow start in this country. In the early days, people were more interested in clearing land, fighting off the people whose land they were clearing, and trying to grow enough to eat on said cleared land. You know, survival stuff. Plus, a good part of such innovation as there was we can’t always attach an innovator’s name to. It’s hard to make a hero out of someone we know nothing about, whose improvements happened we hardly know where or how. And later on, innovation became corporatized. A Steve Jobs may well have a vision for changing the world, but he’s more likely to be an organizer and coordinator of other people’s talents than a solitary genius. He depended on others to make his dreams a reality.\n\nDe Camp does not omit the Benjamin Franklins, nor does he pretend there were no innovations in the middle years of the twentieth century, but they aren’t his focus. His theme is the “great inventors” who transformed civilization, changing the agrarian world of the early nineteenth century into the industrial one of the twentieth. Heroic Age is a sort of collective biography of this squabbling herd of thinkers and tinkerers, and an account of their cumulative efforts.\n\nSupposedly, there are thirty-two of them. So the book blurbs and the bibliographies inform us. As far as I’ve been able to tell, though, we never actually get a list of who they all are. Maybe on the end flaps of the original edition—I don’t have reproductions of those. Otherwise, no. Four are pictured on the cover of the original edition, and eight are pictured (and named) on the reissue (and named on the back flap). Inside, the chapter titles name nineteen, while de Camp’s acknowledgements on the verso of the title page brings to light a few more. The index at the end of the book contains dozens and dozens of names. Rather than reread the whole text and tease out all the individuals covered most prominently, I’ll just fold together here those name-dropped in the spots noted, forming a list which, as you’ll observe, still falls well short of thirty-two. Twenty-three, actually. Digging out the remainder I leave as an exercise for any inspired to peruse the book.\n\nThe names I’ve extracted include: Robert L. Stevens, George Westinghouse, Joseph Henry, Samuel Morse, Samuel Colt, Hiram Stevens Maxim, Hudson Maxim, Cyrus McCormick, John Ericsson, William Kelly, Ottmar Mergenthaler, Christopher Latham Sholes, Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, Elihu Thomson, Nikola Tesla, George Baldwin Selden, Samuel Pierpont Langley, Wilbur Wright, Orville Wright, Reginald Aubrey Fessenden, Lee de Forest, and Edwin Howard Armstrong.\n\nHere are the chapter titles, to give you a sense of what these people did and the progression of the narrative, which the bare recitation of names may not. I. Invention Comes to America. II. The Heroic Age Begins. III. The Stevenses and Railroading. IV. Henry, Morse, and the Telegraph. V. Colt and Other Gunmakers. VI. McCormick and Farm Machinery. VII. Ericsson and the Modern Warship. VIII. Kelly and Steel Refining. IX. Mergenthaler, Sholes, and Writing Machines. X. Bell and the Telephone. XI. Edison and the Electric Light. XII. Thomson and Alternating-Current Power. XIII. Selden and the Automobile. XIV. Langley, The Wrights, and Flying. XV. Fessenden, De Forest, and Radio. XVI. The End of the Heroic Age.\n\nSome of the material in the book was repurposed from straight biographical articles of about 2000 words each that de Camp had previously written for the magazine Science Digest in the late 50s and early 60s under the collective title “A Science Milestone.” The journal was a popular science periodical of the era, and the article series, to which other authors also contributed, provided capsule biographies of numerous scientists and inventors the world over from antiquity to the present day. De Camp continued to contribute occasional articles to this series through the remainder of the 60s.\n\nWhen I referred to the inventors covered in Heroic Age as a squabbling herd, I meant it, and anyone who has read much de Camp will anticipate that his account dwells amusingly and tolerantly on their squabbles. Rest assured your anticipation will be appropriately rewarded. I think his examination of humanity’s foibles is half the fun for him, as well as his readers. It certainly is for me. The other half is educational. You will find innovations covered here you might not ordinarily think of, besides such obvious big ones of the cotton gin, the telegraph, the electric light, and powered flight. If you haven’t read this book before, you’re in for a pleasant progression of discovery as well as an entertaining set of irascible curmudgeons. Only you can say which you find more interesting.\n\nThe book is dedicated “To my sons Lyman and Gerard, who share with countless other young Americans a love of tinkering and invention.”\n\nThe dedicatees, Lyman Sprague de Camp and Gerard Beekman de Camp (“Gerry”), were born close to ten years and six months apart, on January 15, 1941, and June 12, 1951, respectively. De Camp highlights some of their “love of tinkering and invention” in several episodes of his autobiography, which I’m not even going try to hunt up right now because of that volume’s horrible index. (Lyman isn’t in the index at all, and Gerard rates just one entry, even though both appear at various points in the memoir.) Unsurprisingly, both boys became engineers, and as adults removed to the southwest. The elder de Camps also later did, as well, in part to be near their children.\n\nLyman married Mrs. Jacqueline Sue (Wanner) Rossman, formerly married to Donald Rossman; they are the parents of Michael Rossman, Patricia Chalstrom, and Veronica Delacroix de Camp (“Ronni”), and grandparents of Nicholas and Samuel Rossman. Now retired from engineering, Lyman lives in Garland, Texas. He was the executor of his father’s estate, and remains the agent of the De Camp Family Limited Partnership, incorporated in August, 1995. He has operated a recreational camp in Garland since about 2009.\n\nGerry lived for many years in Las Vegas, Nevada with his partner, Jocelyn Sprague Hazard Darling (also his second cousin, twenty years his senior); she was the dedicatee of The Purple Pterodactyls (Phantasia Press, 1980), both are discussed briefly in my review of that book. About eight years after Jocelyn’s death in 2005 Gerry married Keti Borislavova Hristova in Dallas, Texas, and has since lived in Houston and Plano, Texas. He remains active as a traffic signal engineer.\n\n# # #"
