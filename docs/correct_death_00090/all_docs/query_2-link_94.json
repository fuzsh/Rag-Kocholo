        "text": "So I have a couple of Conan-related blogs I want to get off my chest, about which I've been thinking for awhile. This first one may cause a bit of a controversy; we'll see.\n\nI'd like to defend L. Sprague de Camp for a moment. I'm sure others have done so before, and probably in a more eloquent and educated fashion than I am about to do, but this has been on my mind and I wanted to lay out at least the beginnings of a case to re-examine his association with Howard's writing, as well as--to a lesser degree and mostly by association--that of his associates Lin Carter and Bjorn Nyberg.\n\nMany articles and postings have been put forth claiming that de Camp, Carter, and Nyberg should never have written their pastiches because they didn't \"get\" Conan. I would argue that this is a matter of debate. I've seen some very convincing arguments insofar as this is concerned, but most of them come down to the personal opinion of the author writing the article in question. There is an article I read recently--I can't remember who wrote it or for the life of me where I read it--wherein the author paints the tendency of pastiche authors to turn Conan into a black-and-white hero as one of the primary errors of pastichists. On this I agree, though some of his points fall flat in my mind. For example, he claims that Conan didn't have a code of honor; that this was invented by later authors. He then proceeds to present elements in the stories that supposedly prove this. Of particular interest was the idea that Conan didn't kill women. Unfortunately, the various incidents from Howard's stories that he presents are rife with Conan saying things like, \"I generally don't kill women,\" and of Conan dumping women who have wronged him in the mud where if the perpetrator was a man, he likely would've felt Conan's sword in his gut. The instances where Conan does seem willing to kill a woman are those instances where the woman is somehow supernatural in nature, such as Akhivasha the vampire.\n\nIn any case, the point I'm making (and I do so wish I could remember the name, author and location of the article referenced above) is that many of these points against pastiche writers are entirely formed based on the personal opinion and interpretation of the article's author. I'm not saying such interpretations aren't valid--merely that the personal interpretations of those who would be apologists for certain pastichists are also equally valid. I personally think that de Camp, Nyberg, and Carter were the ones who did \"get it.\"\n\nIn the 70's and 80's, Mirage Press and Ace books put out a series of scholarly works (mostly edited by de Camp) revolving around the works of Howard. These were largely extractions from fanzines previously published and written by \"The Hyborian Legion,\" the first Howard fan club as well as a sort of informal scholarly Howard Studies society of the time. I have been fortunate enough to add two of these volumes to my collection: The Conan Grimoire and The Blade of Conan. In reading Blade, there is an article by de Camp entitled \"Editing Conan.\" In this article, de Camp essentially defends the choices he made in editing the Howard stories for their Ace publications and in undertaking the rewrites he did of non-Conan stories.\n\nI found the article intriguing and as I read, I found myself comparing some of the edits de Camp did in the Ace paperback series with those originals published in the recent 3-volume Ballantine series. In truth, I found de Camp's defenses to hold up overall. Certainly he did make a few changes that were unnecessary--the creation of an archenemy for Conan out of Thoth-Amon by inserting the sorcerer into stories where he did not appear comes foremost to mind. However, the vast majority of changes I noted in de Camp's edits of extant Howard prose are not, to my mind, egregious.\n\nConsider that in the era when Howard was publishing, editors didn't undertake the same role that they later did. Farnsworth Wright was more likely to cut chunks of text for space than he was to correct grammatical errors, make text flow more smoothly, or other such duties editors fulfill nowadays.\n\nI love Robert E. Howard's writing. He is in my top five favorite writers, alongside Mark Twain and Jack London. However, it's tough to argue the fact that in some places those original texts are a bit rough. The edits de Camp undertook, for the most part, are no worse than that any modern editor would take. They don't, to my mind, change the nature of the stories, or in any way lessen their quality. Even the certain omissions de Camp made, such as softening the supposed racist undertones (a subject for another blog) are forgivable, as they were done in effort to make the stories more accessible, and are also the sorts of alterations a modern editor would suggest. And in the end, does changing \"ape-like speech\" to \"guttural speech\" really make that massive a difference in the text? Not to my mind.\n\nNow, let's get to his completions and rewrites. In the 60's, when the Ace paperback series was being published, there was a hunger for swords and sorcery. As a luminary figure in the genre, Conan naturally generated a great deal of this hunger. de Camp and Carter fulfilled this hunger by completing several unfinished works of Howard's, and by rewriting some of Howard's non-Conan tales to be Conan tales.\n\nI do not consider these rewrites sinful.\n\nWhy? Look at the things Howard himself did--\"The Phoenix on the Sword\" is itself a rewritten Kull story--\"By This Axe I Rule!\" When the Kull adventure failed to publish, Howard revised it to be a Conan story: the first Conan story, in fact. Is it not possible--I'm not saying likely, mind you--just possible--that eventually \"Hawks Over Egypt,\" which was not published during Howard's lifetime, could've eventually also been rewritten? I disagree with de Camp's choice to make it \"Hawks over Shem,\" as \"Hawks over Stygia\" seems more accurate to the original text, but that's really a nitpick. Likewise could be said regarding \"The Bloodstained God,\" rewritten from \"The Crimson God,\" also not published during Howard's life. Likewise, \"The Three-Bladed Doom,\" rewritten to \"The Flame Knife,\" and \"The Road of the Eagles,\" which wasn't published in its original form until 2005, according to Sword Woman and Other Historical Adventures.\n\nThese tales translate well into Conan stories under de Camp's hand, and I think it quite possible that Howard himself may have rewritten them eventually, as he knew Conan was his bread and butter. There's no guarantee, of course, but it's a reasonable \"what if\" to present. Of course, he may not have as well: Kirby O'Donnel, the hero of \"The Road of the Eagles,\" was created in '34, and it's possible that by that time Howard was looking to move away from Conan (indeed, I seem to recall having read a letter from him indicating that was exactly what he wanted to do). Still, a cash cow for a writer is not an easy thing to leave behind, and as I said, Conan was Howard's bread and butter.\n\nAs for the pure pastiches, there are some issues in them that are hard to swallow, no doubt--the SCUBA gear in Conan of the Isles was a bit tough to buy, and seems more out of Carter's Thongor series than Conan, and nobody can forget the out-of-the-blue inclusion of Satyrs in Conan the Liberator. But overall, the \"earlier\" pastiches included in the Ace series are, in my opinion, pretty fine inclusions into the Conan mythos. They are well-written and enjoyable to read, and Conan feels like Conan to me in the stories. I actually am a big fan of The Return of Conan, also known as Conan the Avenger, and think it's a work of which Howard himself may have been proud, had he survived to give his blessing to it.\n\nde Camp's later efforts to take control and ownership of Conan and the Hyborian Age via Conan Properties, I think, are another issue entirely and are reflective of someone who has forgotten his place in the overall scheme of things. I won't deny these were shady acts at best that have damaged the property as time has gone on--see the fact that while many of the stories are in the public domain, the various elements of those stories have been trademarked by Paradox Entertainment; a clever loophole to retain ownership, which I think needs to be closed. But copyright law is another topic entirely.\n\nde Camp's uneducated attitudes about Howard himself are also not an issue at debate--he was wrong in most of his understandings about Howard's life and psyche.\n\nHowever, what he did do is resurrect Conan and keep him in print for many years, and I don't think he deserves the derision he gets for his efforts to pastiche, complete unfinished manuscripts, and edit extant ones for publication. His efforts were certainly no more egregious than any other editing job I've seen, nor of any other posthumous collaboration. As a member of the Lovecraft Circle, I'm not even 100% certain that Howard would've disapproved of new stories being written set in the Hyborian Age. Sharing story elements, after all, was part and parcel of that group. It may be going a bit to far to say he'd be so liberal with the character of Conan, but I certainly think that de Camp, Carter, and Nyberg did the things they did (at least, insofar as early pastiches, completions and revisions go) in the proper spirit of things, and I to this day enjoy reading the Conan stories as told in the old twelve-volume Ace paperback series, which sits on my shelf right next to the eleven Robert E. Howard Ballantine collections, from Kull to Conan to Crimson Shadows and Grim Lands to Sword Woman to Solomon Kane to El Borak and Horror Stories, and my collected letters of Robert E. Howard.\n\nThere have been those who dismiss the idea that de Camp resurrected Conan in publication, using the rationale that someone would've done so anyway, because the environment was right for it. This may be true, just as it may be true that had Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson not created D&D, someone else would've likely done so (or something similar) anyway, because the time was right.\n\nThe counter argument is this: it doesn't matter if someone else would have. de Camp is the one who did it. Certainly the actions the man took in the 70's and 80's with Conan and CPI were despicable in many ways--I'm not arguing that. What I am saying is that many of the assaults on de Camp for his Howard editing, pastiche work, and posthumous collaborations are, in my opinion, colored by the man's arrogance and his treatment of the property in other areas.\n\nStay tuned: Next up, I'm going to reconcile different presentations of Hyperboria in the various Conan pastiches and RPGs.\n\nThe Darkness Spell in 5e is Pointless\n\nHere's a fun observation. The spell darkness, in 5e, has absolutely zero mechanical effect in 5th edition D&D. Darkness creates a heavily obscured area . Creatures within that area effectively suffer from the blinded condition. Blinded characters suffer disadvantage on attacks, and creatures attacking them have advantage. The spell negates darkvision . All characters within the sphere of magical darkness have disadvantage to attack, but advantage to attack other creatures in the darkness. This advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out . All creatures within the space of a darkness spell battle as normal. The spell is, from a mechanical sense, pointless and negated. Certainly this discounts a proper GM who looks past it and says, \"no, that's stupid,\" but yeah, strictly BY THE BOOK it's a pretty gross oversight by the designers of the game from a mechanical standpoint. Also, I pointed this out to the Sage Advice people some time ago and they confirmed\n\nLembas - Elvish Waybread: a real-world recipe\n\nHere's a recipe I put together for Lembas bread. Didn't know I could bake, did you? Well, I can, and I'm pretty durned good at it when I want to be. Note: Okay, this isn't exactly directly related to OD&D, but we all know that there is a relationship between OD&D and Middle Earth, and this makes for a good holiday treat, or a nice, filling and fairly healthy snack at the gaming table. Here's how it came about: we were doing a Lord of the Rings marathon at my buddy Mike's house when the RotK extended edition came out. Mike has a 42\" widescreen and a really kick ass surround sound system, so we got together at 9:00 AM on Saturday and watched all twelve-plus hours of the epic trilogy back to back. It was awesome. Anyway, I wanted to contribute something so I started searching for recipes for Lembas bread. My efforts that year were futile, but flash forward to last Christmas. I got the hankering to try again, so I looked up some recipes onli\n\nPsionics in Dungeons & Dragons Part I: Original D&D\n\nI'd like to take a couple blog entries to explore the concept of psionics in the early editions of D&D--specifically, original D&D and AD&D first edition. Psionics, traditionally, have been a much-reviled part of the D&D opus, and those who do not include them in their game are certainly far more common than those who do include them. It's no secret that even Gary Gygax lamented and regretted their inclusion, and didn't use them himself. As with any aspect of the game, ask 100 players why they don't like psionics, and you'll get at least 50 different answers (if not more). The vast majority, however, will come down to one of two major points: They are science-fiction feeling and simply don't have a place in a fantasy game They are overcomplicated, confusing, and simply arcane and unworkable. I can't really address point one. If you simply don't like the idea of psionics, if you feel like they're not fantasy-feeling, and y\n\nPsionics in Dungeons & Dragons, Part II: Advanced D&D\n\nNow that we've looked at how Psionics work in original Dungeons & Dragons, let's examine how they work in Advanced D&D. Readers may be shocked to discover that psionics in AD&D are, in many ways, much easier and more straightforward than they are in OD&D. The two systems are very similar, but there are some important and notable differences. The next blog entry in this series will compare and contrast the two systems, but for now I want to focus on how they work to keep a clean exploration and explanation of these two rules sets, both of which offer a lot of fun and something different and mysterious for D&D games that have become a bit rote in their approach. Psionics can present an interesting approach to mysticism in an AD&D game, particularly one that seeks to represent certain styles of 1970s and 80s fantasy, particularly those of writers like Mercedes Lackey, Ursula K. LeGuin, Andre Norton, and Marion Zimmer Bradley, which in modern terms system\n\nTech Blog: Xiaomi Mi Box S vs NVIDIA SHIELD TV Android TV Boxes\n\nYeah, I know, this is an old-school gaming blog, but I needed somewhere to put this, and it's a bit of a ramble, so bear with me. If anyone is cutting the cord, this may come in handy for you. Juliette and I upgraded our streaming box today to an NVIDIA Shield TV. I had originally purchased a Xiaomi MiBox S as a test case for cutting the cord. I can now compare the two for anyone interested in going for an Android TV box. Note that I did NOT go with the $190-$200 SHIELD Pro, which is the high end gaming version of the Shield TV, and comes with double the memory and an extra USB port. I went with the NVIDIA SHIELD TV \"base\" model, which looks like a cylinder. Xiaomi Mi Box S NVIDIA SHIELD TV Price The MiBox S EASILY wins in this category, going for between $64 and $66 on Amazon. The Shield TV goes for $149 on Amazon and at Best Buy, where we bought ours. Looks Again, I have to give the edge to the MiBox, here. It's a very unassuming small, black, square box that sit\n\nWasted Lands - a Completely Customizable RPG\n\nHere we go, folks! The final blog before the Wasted Lands Kickstarter launches ! Stay tuned for more behind the curtain looks as the campaign progresses, but this one completes the big lead-up! Previous blogs in this series: Wasted Lands: The Dreaming Age is Imminent! Will Wasted Lands be a Retroclone? What Are Divine Touchstones? Races (Species) and Cultural Backgrounds How Do Tiered Abilities Work? Class Abilities in Wasted Lands For some time now we've been pushing \"Your Game, Your Way\" as a slogan for Powered by O.G.R.E.S. games , and many wonder what kind of meaning that carries. After all, everyone claims that their game is the one you've been looking for, and the concept of a universal game system has been around almost as long as RPGs themselves. Even the earliest versions of D&D had sci-fi elements and the first edition DMG discussed melding the system with a range of genres. So what do we mean exactly when we talk about O.G.R.E.S. as a customizable s\n\nReview: Original Dungeons & Dragons Premium Reprint\n\n(Stock Image) Source: http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/45390000 Introduction To put a crown jewel on their “Premium Reprint,” series, Wizards of the Coast has re-released the original Dungeons & Dragons rules. Specifically, this reprint is of the sixth printing, or “OCE” (Original Collector’s Edition) version of the rules. Like many fans of the old school, I was rather excited and more than a little nervous about this product. For $150, would they screw it up? Would it be handled properly? Would it, unlike the reprints for second and third editions, truly be premium? Yesterday, I headed to my FLGS and picked up my OD&D Premium Reprint. Here are my thoughts. Presentation This set is really nice. It comes in an actual wooden box, a nice nod to the original rules which came in a printed woodgrain box. The box construction is sturdy and just overall excellent. It has a nice velvet pad on the bottom to keep from scratching you\n\nMCU Films: Multiversal Order\n\nNow that we have the multiverse officially in place with the MCU, that makes pretty much every single media property throughout the history of the company part of the MCU. In case anyone was wondering, and just for fun, I’ve put together the correct chronological order of ALL of the Marvel films across the entire Multiverse, including all theatrical films since the 1990s. Here they are. All 64 of them so far, should you want to watch them in chronological order. I did not include the TV series in here because let’s be realistic. I have also added Earth designations from the official Marvel database, modified with additional designations where crossovers may theoretically exist. It is possible, for example, that the Deadpool movies take place in the X-Men universe, but by no means certain, and it is likely that the intent of Logan is to present an endgame for the Earth-10005 timeline, but it was given its own designation \"just in case\".) According to the Marvel Database, real\n\nGummi Bears - Bouncing Here and There and Everywhere\n\nI don't care what anyone says, Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears was a damn great fantasy cartoon back in the day, and it deserves a D&D treatment.
