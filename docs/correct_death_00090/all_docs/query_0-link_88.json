Maas, a highly accomplished and well known school and music teacher, died at the family residence in this city Monday night, after a long and painful illness, of cancer of the throat. For several years previous to his death he, with his family, had resided in old Mexico, returning to his home here, several months ago. During his residence here several years ago he was connected with the various schools of the city, and did excellent and satisfactory work. As a musician, he had much skill, and it was a treat to listen to his execution. He leaves a widow, and one little daughter, to whom our heartfelt sympathy is extended. The funeral took place Tuesday afternoon at the Odd Fellows [Masonic] cemetery. [An obit with additional information written by Rev.

Mr. Macha had not been sick long, and his death was caused from a complication in the nature of blood poisoning. He was a fine old gentleman, aged 70 years, and his popularity among all classes and nationalities was amply attested by the large crowd attending his funeral Sunday afternoon. Rev. C J. Benes performed the burial ceremony and his impressive utterances were listened to with closest attention. Prof. Schindler's baud was present and played the funeral march.

Returning home late in the evening, he carried with him a jug of liquor. He indulged in this liquor pretty freely that night, so much so that he was frenzied drunk. About 2 a.m. he got into an angry discussion with his wife, and when she remonstrated with him he pulled out a British bull-dog pistol and shot her in the left side just above the nipple. Hearing the angry discussion, his son ran into the room, when the old man turned the pistol on and shot him in the shoulder. Macha then locked himself in his room. The other members of the family, fearing he would kill some of them, carried the wounded mother and son to a neighbor's home, and left the old man alone in the room. After they left, it would seem from the evidence at hand, he ate a lot of London purple and Paris green, and then fearing that this would not kill him, secured a plow line out in the barn, threw it over a rafter and hung himself. He was found dead when the neighbors came over to the house the next morning. His remains were interred in the Odd Fellows cemetery Monday afternoon,. The woman and boy are pretty badly wounded, but will get well. Macha was very well fixed financially.\n\nWeimar Mercury, February 29, 1896\n\nMacha, Robert\n\nRobert Macha, a young man who formerly lived here and worked for John Mozicek in the blacksmith shop, died at Houston Wednesday of malarial fever, and was brought here for burial [St. Michaels Cemetery] Thursday afternoon.

Dear little Cara, so bright, so lovely, so eminently fitted to make life a joy to all within her circle, it is beyond mortal vision why she should have been called up higher with her early mission only just begun, but the stream of time hurried her in the portals of the sunset,\n\nWhere all crimson and gold,\n\nSlowly home to the fold\n\nThe fleecy clouds flock to the gateway of even,\n\nThen no longer brook-born,\n\nBut a way paved with morn,\n\nAye! a bright golden street to the city of Heaven!\n\nColorado Citizen, September 14, 1882, page 3\n\nMahon, Daisy\n\nDied in this city last Saturday night, of whooping cough, Daisy, infant daughter of Mr. and Mrs. F.

A painful loneliness, dark as night, coils itself round the desolated home and hearts, for the setting of a great hope is like the setting of the sun. Then stars arise and the night is holy. May the present night of sorrow soon be illumined by the stars of resignation, hope and trust, for even now little Felix\n\nOn tireless pinions, cleaveth the bright air\n\nOf an eternal heaven, untossed by storms,\n\nUndarkened eer by tempests, and secure\n\nFrom the dread Archers arrows.\n\n[Interment in Odd Fellows Rest]\n\nColorado Citizen, October 7, 1880\n\nMahon, Felix Grundy\n\nDEATH OF JUDGE F.

Malsch\n\nBurial services for Edwin E. Malsch, 82, a resident of the county poor farm, were at the Columbus City Cemetery February 24, Columbus Funeral Home in charge.\n\nMr. Malsch was born in Colorado county, March 15, 1856. He had formerly been a lawyer and had lived in Columbus 80 years.\n\nWeimar Mercury, March 17, 1939\n\nMalsch, Mathis\n\nMurder Most Foul!\n\nASSASSINATION OF M. MALSCH, ESQ.\n\nA Premeditated, Cinch?, Cowardly and Atrocious Butchery!\n\nOn Friday morning last, on the road leading from Columbus to Frelsburg, M. Malsch, Esq., an old resident of Frelsburg, in our county, was killed by E. Houillon, also a member of the Bar, who immigrated to this county a few years since from Louisiana. Conscious that the deed had been perpetrated with none but the eye of God to witness it, the prisoner returned to Columbus and gave himself up to the authorities, the following story of the killing: Houillon says he was going to Frelsburg to see some witnesses; procured a horse early and started, when about five miles from town, riding along the road, he saw somebody behind a tree, who fired upon him with a six-shooter. It proved to be M. Malsch, of Frelsburg, who came out from the tree. He then drew his pistol and fired, when Malsch came up and they grappled, and in the scuffle both were disarmed. H. then succeeded in getting his pocket-knife, with which he inflicted the fatal wound, having previously received a severe blow from M.s pistol over the head. The accused states that he has been afraid of an attack from Malsch for a good while, and was always prepared for it. [Illegible] ..dured considerable excitement in our city, and was the theme of universal comment. There were parties who credited it, and quite as many who did not.\n\nBut as murder will out, as it appears God intended it should there were living witnesses to this tragedy. Their story differs materially from that of the prisoner, and the worst part of it is they have plain facts and circumstantial evidences to prove that their statement is the correct one. The witnesses were the young Craig boys, who testify substantially as follows; Early in the morning they went out to their crib to harness up their horses to go to work on the farm. Houillon passed their crib about light, and a few minutes afterwards the young men heard a shot. Looking in that direction they saw Malsch running on foot and Houillon in pursuit on horseback. The route of the road here concealed the parties from where the witnesses stood, but in a very short while they heard another shot, and the cry of murder! murder! Presently all was still, and Houillon came out from behind the obstruction on horseback, and as he rode up to the field, threw something over the fence. As he passed the witnesses on his return to town, he told them he had a difficulty down there with Malsch, and asked them to go down there and see if he was hurt.\n\nThey went there and also to the field, where they found a large, bloody knife. Malsch was dead when they got to him, having a pistol shot in the hip, one in the back of his head, and three mortal stabs, two in the breast, and one in the left side, below the heart each of which the physicians said would have been mortal.\n\nThe road was soft ground, and showed where the parties had met and stopped in the road, where Malschs horse had wheeled and thrown him, the saddlebags being on the ground, and the route he ran in the woods. The circumstances are very strong against the prisoner, who, when they facts were developed by the Coroners jury, waived an examination and went to jail. The difficulty is the result of an old feud, and if we have made any error in this statement, we hope it is not against the prisoner. Excepting the murder of John [Illegible] here in 186__, by an armed mob, this murder appears to be the most distinguished ia? atrocity of any in the county within our remembrance.

Young Reissner’s examining trial was set for Monday afternoon, but he waived examination, and was bound over in the sum of $3000 to await the action of the grand jury. His bond was signed by Chas. Allen, Louis Hillje and H. J. Laas and he was released. This tragedy is indeed deeply regretted, and by no one more than young Reissner himself, who through a sudden burst of passion while under the influence of drink permitted himself to take the life of his fellow-man, thus casting a blight over his own life forever.\n\nWeimar Mercury, March 31, 1906\n\nMartens, Lara M.
