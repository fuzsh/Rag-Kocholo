        "text": "I was saying all these people who just disappear, they have slipped back down the suitcase.\n\nThe what?\n\nThe trunk, I mean. The trunk of the tree of time. When they stop slipping, they are back in some former time. But as soon as they do anything, they change all subsequent history.\n\nSounds like a paradox, said Padway.\n\nNo-o. The trunk continues to exist. But a new branch starts out where they come to rest. It has to, otherwise we would all disappear, because history would have changed and our parents might not have met.\n\nHe was living in the twilight of western classical civilization. The Age of Faith, better known as the Dark Ages, was closing down. Europe would be in darkness, from a scientific and technological aspect, for nearly a thousand years. That aspect was, to Padways naturally prejudiced mind, the most, if not the only, important aspect of a civilization. [...]\n\nSo what? Could one man change the course of history to the extent of preventing this interregnum? One man had changed the course of history before. Maybe. A Carlylean would say yes. A Tolstoyan or Marxian would say no; the environment fixes the pattern of a mans accomplishments and throws up the man to fit that pattern.\n\nYou never seemed very mysterious to me, in spite of your foreign background.\n\nThats great. Youre not afraid of me, are you?\n\nNot in the least. If you made a deal with Satanas as some people hint, Im sure the Devil got the worst of it.\n\nI dont know the pretty phrases. In fact, Ive never written a love letter in my life.\n\nIll help you out with that, too. Here, we can start right now. Padway got out writing materials, and they were presently concocting a letter to the princess. Lets see, said Padway reflectively, we ought to tell her what her eyes are like.\n\nTheyre just like eyes, arent they?\n\nOf course, but in this business you compare them to the stars and things.\n\nUrias thought. Theyre about the color of a glacier I once saw in the Alps.\n\nNo, that wouldnt do. It would imply that they were as cold as ice.\n\nThey also remind you of a polished sword blade.\n\nSimilar objection."
