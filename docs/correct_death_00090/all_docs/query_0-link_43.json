        "text": "Ninth of a series\n\nThis is the ninth in my review of the video production Does God Exist, brought to you by Focus on the Family, an agency for conservative Christian advocacy. The video is available on DVD from Amazon, and it is currently streaming on Amazon, free with Amazon Prime.\n\nThe previous episode dealt with the return of the God hypothesis. Creationist Stephen C. Meyer argued that public discourse should return to accepting the hypothesis that God is behind everything. In Episode 9 Meyer abandons science altogether and unfolds his inner core argument. Judeo-Christian (Muslim, too) religious dogma is the only right and acceptable basis for human morality. He states this up front. See the screen shot above.\n\nMeyer has formal education in science, a degree in physics and earth science, and he earlier worked down the street from where I used to work, in Plano, Texas. But then he earned a Ph.D. in history and philosophy of science at Cambridge University, and he has been involved in promoting religion since, with little attention paid to actual science. Here he waxes entirely philosophical and theological.\n\nWe are treated to the wisdom of that world-renowned thinker Fyodor Dostoyevsky.\n\nFyodor Dostoyevsky\n\n“If God is dead, then all things are permissible.”\n\nYes, there is a real question whether we should base our lives on the thoughts of a 19th century writer of fiction.\n\nMeyer illustrates with some sound logical inferences, using well-grounded philosophy.\n\nThe presentation foil says:\n\nIs ≠ Ought\n\nMurder hurts people.\n\nHurting people is wrong.\n\nTherefore, murder is wrong.\n\nThe first part I translate to “what exists is what should be.” Then comes a statement that responsible members of society will agree to, namely that killing people is bad for the people being killed. Meyer is presenting to some students, and he initially leaves the part about hurting people being wrong and just shows the last part, murder is wrong. He asks students to fill in the blank. A student provides the obvious and missing part: hurting people is wrong. The matter then lands on where we got the part about hurting people is wrong. That’s the basis of human morality. We need to figure out what is wrong and what is right. We need to figure out what we ought to do. Meyer is going to argue that this answer cannot come from logic and reason but must come from theism—from God.\n\nMeyer quotes a number of famous people. Here is one such.\n\nHere’s what it has to say:\n\nThere Are No Objective Standards of Morality\n\n“Morality … is merely an adaptation put in place to further our reproductive end… In an important sense, ethics as we understand it is an illusion fobbed off on us by our genes to get us to cooperate.\n\n[Attributed to Michael Ruse and E.O. Wilson]\n\nMichael Ruse is a retired professor of philosophy:\n\nMichael Ruse, FRSC (born 21 June 1940) is a philosopher of science who specializes in the philosophy of biology and is well known for his work on the relationship between science and religion, the creation–evolution controversy, and the demarcation problem within science. Ruse currently teaches at Florida State University. He was born in England, attending Bootham School, York. He took his undergraduate degree at the University of Bristol (1962), his master’s degree at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario (1964), and Ph.D. at the University of Bristol (1970).\n\nEdward Osborne Wilson is a biologist:\n\nEdward Osborne Wilson (born June 10, 1929), usually cited as E. O. Wilson, is an American biologist, researcher, theorist, naturalist and author. His biological specialty is myrmecology, the study of ants, on which he is the world’s leading expert.\n\nThe statement, attributed to the two of them together, seems brash on the surface, but it contains some embedded logic. There is a view, held by me and by others, that human morality is basic. I start by observing that mothers, with exceptions, do not kill their babies. Else there would be no human race. Further, there would be no human race prior to the rise of Judeo-Christian thinking. Hence, human morality existed at a basic level for a long time without benefit of Judeo-Christian morality. I extend this line of thought to higher levels of ethics and morality.\n\nYou don’t take other people’s stuff, because if you do, then that’s going to make them angry, and they’re going to come after you, and you are going to spend your time fighting to stay alive, whereas if you left other people’s stuff alone, and they left your stuff alone, then everybody would get along and we would all be more productive.\n\nAnd that’s the basis of the Ruse-Wilson argument, Stephen C. Meyer notwithstanding.\n\nMeyer cites additional examples. Here’s famous trial lawyer of 100 years ago, Clarence Darrow. In 1924 Darrow defended two privileged white kids who murdered a young boy in an exercise to demonstrate they were smarter than anybody else.\n\nWhat Darrow did is what any good defense lawyer does. There was no doubt the boys did it, and a guilty plea was entered. What Darrow did was to successfully argue before the sentencing judge that the boys were shaped by evolution and society and should not be executed for the crime.\n\nMeyer’s invoking of the Darrow defense might lend merit to his argument against innate morality, but he steps into a giant cow cookie while invoking Darrow. Specifically:\n\n[Darrow] was sent by the ACLU out to Chicago to defend [Leopold and Loeb].\n\nAbsolutely false, and I have to wonder where Meyer got this. The ACLU did not send Darrow to defend two murderers. Leopold and Loeb were from wealthy families, and they did not need a civil rights lawyer to defend them. They could afford the best lawyer in the country, and what happened, according to a biography of Darrow’s life, is that the uncle of one of the boys went to Darrow’s home and pleaded, promised to pay whatever was demanded, to get Darrow to take the case.\n\nCall me cynical if you wish, but Meyer’s reference to the ACLU appears to be a bit of Intelligent Design. The Intelligent Design folks are not known for stand-up honesty, and the temptation to suck the ACLU—which has confronted state-sponsored anti-evolution at every step—into the narrative was possibly too tempting to resist. Do I think Meyer and the other creationists were still smarting from the drubbing ACLU lawyers gave Intelligent Design in the Kitzmiller case? Inquiring minds would like to know.\n\nThe religious doctrine espoused by conservative thinkers, the Discovery Institute included, leans toward being highly-judgmental. The word on the street is these people recoil when they think somebody is having too much fun. “The Kinsey Reports” refers to two volumes published in 1948 and 1953 and based on interviews with a few thousands of subjects.\n\nWhat’s Natural is Good\n\n“The Kinsey Reports … have inspired sex education programs in high schools and encouraged several generations of sex therapists to tell their patients, ‘If it feels good, do it.’ [Attributed to] James H. Jones.”\n\nRegarding James H. Jones:\n\nJames H. Jones is a Professor of History at the University of Arkansas.\n\nHe is the author of Kinsey: A Public/Private Life and [also] Bad Blood: The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment.\n\nMeyer does not cite a reference for the Jones quote, but assume it is true for the sake of argument. A broad interpretation is that if nobody is harmed, then it is all right to do it. This is something religious fundamentalists seem to have issue with. Call me out on this if I am wrong, but my observation is that many conservatives in this country and elsewhere, in the interest of smaller government, want people to quit having fun wherever there are no consequences attached.\n\nMeyer invokes the United States Constitution, as it is based on religious morality.\n\nThis is possibly a misstep on his part, because the Constitution, as originally adopted, was not steeped in morality and human rights:\n\nSection. 2.\n\nThe House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.\n\nNo Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.\n\nRepresentatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons. The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one Representative; and until such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New-York six, New Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia three.\n\nWhen vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies.\n\nThe House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.\n\n[Emphasis added]\n\nYes, the Constitution, adopted in 1789, had no provision for protecting human rights, and it had text particularly worded to accommodate slavery.\n\nIn the video one student is seen bringing up the matter of slavery, and Meyer is quick to respond that that was then, and this is now (my words). Just because somebody else does it wrong, or just because everybody used to do it wrong, that doesn’t mean we should not presently be doing it right. He completely glosses over his wrong assertion that the Constitution was inspired by a Judeo-Christian morality.\n\nOnce again he invokes David Berlinski. I have to go back to the video to recall what this was about.\n\nAnd here it is. Berlinski is seen saying that no system that sought to ensure morality, absent religion, has been successful. Berlinski may have some support here. In a previous century I was acquainted with the late science fiction writer and acknowledged atheist L. Sprague de Camp. At a dinner gathering once he made this observation. We need religion, the fear of God, to make people do right.\n\nWhile I can possibly, based on observation, agree with Berlinski and de Camp, I have never found it necessary in my own life to require fear of the supernatural to keep me in line. That observation holds for a large gathering of my atheistic friends and family. On the other hand I note the great number of people being killed in the name of God. God’s ways are mysterious, to be sure.\n\nMeyer concludes.\n\nThree Key Conditions for an Objective Morality\n\nObjective standard\n\nFree will\n\nIntrinsic value of humans\n\nI find no fault with that position. How I differ with Meyer is that an imaginary God is not necessary to attain that objective.\n\nThis entire episode has been soaked in religion and philosophy, and Meyer’s presentation quotes a number of philosophical sources, including Berlinski and Dostoyevsky. And that is supposed to mean a lot. People who know me really well are acquainted with my view of philosophy as a study and philosophers in general. God put philosophers on this planet with an eye toward making used car salesmen look good.\n\nThat said, what to make of Meyer’s argument, specifically that we need a God, particularly we need a religion, to obtain morality? More specifically, people did not come up with morality, cannot come up with morality, on their own. There must have been some supernatural force to inject morality into the human consciousness. It’s a proposition that does not pass the Skeptical Analysis test.\n\nFirst, assuming the God to which Meyer refers is the source of this morality. Surprise! This God is a human invention. People existed many thousands of years before the Abrahamic God was introduced, and people had morality. Doubt me? Take note of this. The famous Ten Commandments existed in various forms prior to the time Moses was supposed to have brought them down from Mount Sinai. From all appearances, the writers of the story of Moses adopted these ideas, and placed them on the stone tablets.\n\nBut, let’s pretend that God really is the source of our morality. Then what a wonder of morality it is. Examples abound:\n\nDeuteronomy 21:18-21 King James Version (KJV)\n\n18 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:\n\n19 Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;\n\n20 And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.\n\n21 And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.\n\nSome more:\n\nExodus 12:29 King James Version (KJV)\n\n29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.\n\nMore:\n\nEphesians 6:5 King James Version (KJV)\n\n5 Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;\n\nMore:\n\n1 Timothy 6:1-2 King James Version (KJV)\n\n6 Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.\n\n2 And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.\n\nAnd I can go on ad nauseam. And I will if anybody from the Intelligent Design camp wants to challenge that I am picking and choosing from the Bible. Meyer might come back to me and remind me some of these quotes are from the Old Testament, before Jesus forged a more benign morality, but Timothy is New Testament, and the Old Testament is from the God of Abraham, who created the Universe and humankind, and imbued us with basic morality, which we would not otherwise have.\n\nAny distinction between Meyer’s presentation and a deceptive propaganda exercise is difficult to discern.\n\nThere is one more episode to review, and then there is the promised bonus extra. I should be finished in two more days.\n\nEpisode 10 is titled “The Moral Necessity of Theism, Part 2: We Need God.” From Amazon:\n\nDr. Meyer provides overwhelming evidence that the theistic worldview is the only one that can provide a coherent explanation for an objective and meaningful system of morality.\n\nI can hardly wait.\n\nHusband and wife writing team Sprague and Catherine de Camp moved to Plano, Texas, about 25 years ago in semi-retirement. We got to know them, and they joined our group, The North Texas Skeptics. This was Sprague’s next to last published book, and I received a copy in the mail for review. The following review appeared in the January 1996 issue of The North Texas Skeptic. It’s The Ape-Man Within.\n\nL. Sprague de Camp. Prometheus Books, Buffalo, 1995. 266 pages (bibliography). $25.95.\n\nReviewed by John Blanton\n\nWhere we came from has made us what we are. This is the theme of Sprague de Camp’s latest non-fiction work. Our ancestors were wild animals who somehow domesticated themselves and ratcheted their way up in steps to what we know as civilized society. We dress ourselves in fine silk and go to the opera and to the ballet, and we probe the depths of the atom and visit nearby planets, but our daily actions belie all this pretense and show us to be the product of our forefathers after all.\n\nThe “theratics” were the hunter-gatherers, little removed from roving packs of ground-dwelling apes. Next came the “georgics,” who improved their lot over the theratic existence by staying in one place and obtaining reliable sources of food from the land and from captive animals. Then came the “astics,” builders and inhabitants of cities. The development of crafts is prominent in this stage. Finally, we have become the “dynatics,” exerting our power over our environment. This progression has come as a consequence of, and often in spite of, the psyche we inherited from our unwashed predecessors.\n\nCritics of social Darwinism stand clear, for your nemesis runs free in this book. Darwinism explains all: love, jealousy, rage, hatred, racism, and even self-sacrifice. Whether the connections be cause and effect or just post hoc rationalization, the reader cannot deny the compelling arguments. Why do people kill without profit? Why do we divide ourselves by erecting artificial boundaries of race and culture? Why does belief in religion persist in the face of overwhelming counter evidence?\n\nIn this book we are pointedly reminded of much that we already know (or should know). There is less genetic difference between humans and chimpanzees than there is between chimpanzees and gorillas, and in the social and sexual antics of chimps and other apes we see reflections of our own society. Despite all this, the author emphasizes that heredity does not excuse antisocial activity; morality, after all, being a human invention. There are also some surprises for those of us who haven’t checked out the sections on archeology and anthropology in the library. For example, the tales of Moses and the exodus from Egypt seem contrary to evidence that the people involved really migrated down from the North. (Furthermore, if the Jews did migrate from Egypt, they forgot to tell the Egyptians they were leaving, or else the Egyptians forgot to write it down.) And finally we are told more about a certain female gorilla named Congo than we really wanted to know.\n\nDo not look here for hope and reaffirmation. On this matter the writer is gloomy and more pessimistic than I can allow myself to be. Sprague de Camp’s views on religion are no secret, and one would expect to find in him a general condemnation of it. However, with surprising cynicism he acknowledges its necessity. Never having inherited real altruism, we require an imaginary, authoritarian presence to continually threaten us with punishment and to cajole us with the promise of reward in order to keep us from seeking short term gain through socially destructive conduct.\n\nThis book is not based on objective science, though there are research citations aplenty to establish its modern knowledge base. Prominent Darwinists, Stephen Jay Gould included, will disagree with many of its conclusions. Instead, this is a statement of the philosophy, the observations, of a modern man. It is told, not in narrative form, but more as a diary, as though the author is gathering a lifetime of experience and revealing it in a conversation with the reader. Several points are restated frequently throughout the book whenever discussion of a new subject recalls them. Read this as the wisdom of one who has trod the length and breadth of the Twentieth-Century. You will hardly find a better perspective."
