        "text": "L. Sprague de Camp, who wrote over 100 science-fiction and fantasy novels and numerous short stories, died on Monday in Plano, Tex., where he lived. He was 92.\n\nMr. de Camp was widely regarded as an imaginative and innovative writer and was an important figure in the heyday of science fiction, from the late 1930's through the late 1940's.\n\nIn those years, John W. Campbell Jr. was the editor in chief of Astounding Science Fiction magazine and the dominant magazine editor in the science-fiction world. It has been said that Mr. Campbell pointed to Mr. de Camp's stories as the paradigm of the new kind of fiction he wished to publish in those early years.\n\nThat new kind of fiction, said David G. Hartwell, a senior editor at Tor/Forge Books who specializes in science fiction, ''was fiction that took place in seemingly ordinary settings except that they were completely imagined by scientific extrapolation.''\n\n''In other words, there was some radical difference from the present world caused by some idea based on a careful and reasonable extrapolation from contemporary science,'' he added.\n\nAs The Independent stated this year, Mr. de Camp was one of a half-dozen ''young, or youngish, writers who in the late 1930's transformed science fiction from tales of whiz-bang galactic pyrotechnics and 'crashing suns' into a genre of mood, character, subtlety, psychological development and reasonably sure-footed plotting.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
