        "text": "It may not be easy navigating the world of ownership and rights regarding Robert E. Howard’s legacy. Who owns the rights to his characters, and what are the different organizations and fan groups? Who is who and who did what?\n\nBut first, an interesting story about a missing Will who could have changed everything.\n\nWhen L. Sprague de Camp (see below) wrote his Howard biography ‘Dark Valley Destiny’, he made a point to interview people who actually knew Howard. Another discussion can be made since de Camp picked and chose how and what to present, but the point is the information that appeared during an interview with Kate Merriman, who was the last nurse for Hester Howard.\n\nShe said that after Bob and Hester were both dead, the very next day Doc Howard told her they had to straighten up REH’s room, sort out all the papers, so he could find things to sell to the pulps. Apparently, money was an issue for Doc Howard. She said papers were scattered everywhere, a real mess to sort out. As they were working their way through the papers she picked up one item, read it, and said “Look, Doctor Howard! It’s a will!”. She said it left everything to his friend Lyndsey Tyson who loaned him the gun, an Automatic Colt Pistol (.380 ACP) also called 9mm Browning Short.\n\nDoc Howard took the will, read it, got very angry, walked out of the room with it, and didn’t return for a few minutes. When he finally did, he no longer had the will, and he told her “Don’t you dare ever tell anyone about that!” And so she didn’t (she said), at least not till she talked to LSDC.\n\nWhat makes this even more interesting is that Howard at one point worked for a lawyer. And a generic Texas lawyer working in a small town does everything, including wills. And he could have told Howard that in Texas, a “holographic” will is valid. That is one that is handwritten and signed. They can be VERY simple that way, whereas a normal typed-out will require witnesses, notaries, much more extensive.\n\nAnd if the lawyer, Paul Harrell had Howard asking him about wills, he may have known about this will. And so it was that when Glenn visited with Lyndsey Tyson in the 1960s, Lyndsey told him that yes, the lawyer came to him a couple of weeks after Bob died, and said Bob had written a holographic will leaving all his rights to Lyndsey, and that Doc Howard was trying to take everything instead, and that Lyndsey needed to speak up at the court, to stop it from happening. Lyndsey told the lawyer Bob had used Lyndsey’s gun, he wanted nothing to do with any of it, and he was so upset. Decades later, when talking to Glenn, Lyndsey told Glenn that that was the dumbest thing he ever did, he should have taken all those rights when he had the chance, maybe he could have gotten rich.\n\nThe judge that was handling the estate of REH following his death delayed and delayed and delayed, perhaps because the lawyer told him what was happening, and the judge was giving Lyndsey time to come forward. Doc Howard wrote a couple of nasty letters to the judge asking him to hurry the hell up, he needed the money in the bank account to pay bills. Lyndsey never came forward back then, and so after way longer than necessary, perhaps as much as 9 months or even a year, the judge finally closed the estate and gave all the rights to Doc Howard as the nearest living kin, under the “intestacy” laws of Texas. (Intestacy is for when there is no will.)\n\nIf Howard had kids, they would have gotten all of it. Under Texas law, contesting the disbursement of an estate has to be done within either a certain time period (one or two years?) after which time it can no longer be contested. So it was long done and nothing can change it.\n\nA popular term to use is the Howard “estate”. This was something created out of Howard’s rights and property (like his books and swords) while the judge was deciding what to do with it. Once he gave it all to Howard’s father, the estate was closed and ceased to exist.\n\nPeople still use this word like it’s still something that exists, but that is the wrong term. Howard’s “copyrights” is likely a more accurate word for this use.\n\nBut let’s step back a few years. Who “owned” Robert E. Howard’s characters after his death?\n\nAlla Ray Kuykendall was only 18 the day Robert Howard, killed himself in Cross Plains, a small West Texas town 30 miles away from Ranger, Texas where she lived. The Kuykendalls met Howard’s father, by then in his 70s, during World War II. Alla Ray’s father had a small hospital and helped doctor Howard (Roberts’s father) who was unable to run a practice by himself. It helped her father and made it easier for dr. Howard. When dr. Howard tied four years later he left his entire state to Kuykendall. The doctor’s possessions consisted of a couple of thousand dollars in the bank, some manuscripts in a trunk — and the copyrights to Robert’s work."
