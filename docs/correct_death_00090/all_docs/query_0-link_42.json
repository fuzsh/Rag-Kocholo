Howard?\n\nO\n\nn myriad occasions people ask me to name some of my favorite authors. As I call out names—Charles Dickens, Jack London, Victor Hugo, J. R. R. Tolkien—their heads nod in recognition. Invariably, when I say “Robert E. Howard,” they furrow their brow and ask, “Who is Robert E. Howard?” Chances are, these same people will recognize his most famous character. So I ask if they’ve heard of Conan the Barbarian. Often this is followed by a tepid response, a nod or a simple “yes.” I then launch into a routine narrative: back in 1932, in Cross Plains, Texas, Robert E. Howard created Conan. They tilt their heads and gently nod as I gradually present my defense for enjoying this somewhat lesser known (to the general reading public) Texas writer and his globally famous barbarian character. On occasion, their faces reveal an uncertainty about why I would like such a thing. It’s an interesting look of confusion, surprise, and curiosity. Sometimes I defend my response with a hearty explanation that Howard wrote many different kinds of stories (and characters): western, horror, action adventure, historical fiction, and hundreds of poems. Their heads tilt in surprise, and they say, “Really?” And the conversation ends. I’m left wondering if they walk away better for having heard about Robert E. Howard. I wonder if they will actually attempt to read his work, if for no other reason than that he made the list of my favorite authors. That’s the thing about Robert E. Howard. He’s written all these wonderful stories and created fascinating protagonists, but the general public basically knows him for one character. And this character has gradually eclipsed his creator in familiarity via popular culture since his first appearance in print back in 1932. I don’t mean this as a pejorative strike against Conan. He was one of the first twentieth-century characters to\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 1\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\n«2»\n\nIntroduction\n\nloom large in the wider field of popular culture. The general public, especially in the United States, has grown accustomed to larger-than-life stories and characters. I’d say they’ve come to expect it and are disappointed when a story or character falls short of this expectation. Conan was fulfilling this need long before it became a criterion in today’s pop culture media, and that’s why Conan overshadows his creator: the public’s focus has been on the character, not the creator. When I ask people if they’ve ever heard of Conan, I wonder if images of Arnold Schwarzenegger in the 1982 film Conan the Barbarian come to their minds. Knowing that this is likely the case makes me wish they would read one of Howard’s Conan stories. I could certainly name a few that would give them a better idea of both the character and his creator. And then I realize that Robert E. Howard is perhaps the greatest unknown author in the state of Texas, maybe even the world. Practically everyone knows who Conan is, but few know the man behind the character. This is a bittersweet reality. Howard’s famous character and those stories have been critically important and trendsetting within the framework of fantasy fiction, as well as popular culture, and their influence has been incalculable. But there is so much more to Robert E. Howard’s literary oeuvre than merely his Conan stories. Considering all of Howard’s literary output makes me realize how important that question is: who is Robert E. Howard? Whether we as fans or scholars of the man and his work like it or not, Howard has too often been swept into a literary corner that is dismissed or overlooked because his stories originated in the pulp magazines of the 1920s and 1930s. Current academic pulp studies are gradually addressing this neglect, but to date, Howard’s work has not been presented as serious literature to the degree that the works of writers like Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, or even H. P. Lovecraft have. These three were popular fiction authors in the 1920s and 1930s who are now studied in literary circles. It’s been an uphill climb, but writers like Howard are finally gaining some of the same literary ground. With this in mind, it’s important that we understand Robert E. Howard, the man and writer, and what makes his life and work so important to both fans and scholars. Robert E. Howard was an enigma. At times even his closest friends and regular correspondents were left second-guessing him. Unpacking his life is a complicated task. Aside from what his stories tell us, much of what we know about Howard has been gleaned from his friends, via interviews and letters. Howard’s letters reveal much about his personality and provide a deep glimpse into his private life, thoughts, and ideas. In\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 2\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n«3»\n\nsome letters, he is at his most vulnerable, baring his real self, his real personality. Some of these letters, however, must be read with several grains of salt, since Howard was ever the storyteller. Sifting through his exaggerations and tall tales is an arduous task, but a necessary one. Even in those moments when Howard is showboating or spinning tall tales as if they are real, this behavior is a measure of his true nature. The greatest percentage of Howard’s letters were written to the pulp writer H. P. Lovecraft. Recently, through the work of S. T. Joshi and David E. Schultz in editing Lovecraft’s personal correspondence, we have obtained a glimpse of what Howard’s literary contemporaries said about him. Understanding his prowess as a writer, Lovecraft praised Howard’s ability to incorporate his own southwestern history into his stories, even certain Conan stories. He also called Howard a phenomenally gifted poet and had always hoped to see a collection of Howard’s poetry in print.1 Lovecraft told his fellow writer E. Hoff mann Price that Howard “had gifts of an order even higher than the readers of his published work could suspect, and in time would have made his mark in real literature with some folk-epic of his beloved southwest.”2 Lovecraft declared that no writers could excel at their craft unless they took their work seriously and wholeheartedly. And in terms of being able to communicate smells, fear, impending doom, brooding horror, or stark, living fear, “what other writer is even in the running with REH?”3 Fans of Howard’s works have known this for decades. Not until recently has the literary community finally caught up with the fans. New academic articles, university theses, and dissertations are now being written about Howard and his work. When Robert E. Howard died, buried with him was his assumption that his work would probably fade into obscurity. I don’t think he could have ever imagined his creations having the impact they have had. His life and work have been far-reaching, changing and influencing countless other writers. Almost one hundred years after his death, George R. R. Martin’s book series A Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) owes its chops in part to Robert E. Howard. Martin has admitted as much on talk shows and his own blog. Among other notable writers, Pulitzer Prize– winning author Michael Chabon, while visiting Dallas, Texas in 2017 to present his own work at the Dallas Museum of Art, made a five-hour round trip to Cross Plains, Texas, to visit the Robert E. Howard House and Museum, a trip Chabon declared he had wanted to make for some years. Interviewed in the Dallas Morning News, Chabon explained that he was a huge fan of Robert E. Howard and revisited Howard’s works\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 3\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\n«4»\n\nIntroduction\n\nevery couple of years.4 Chabon said that the experience of being in the room where Howard wrote his stories was quite moving. In the years since his death, a considerable amount has been printed about Howard’s life, some of it deprecatory, some of it exaggerated and misleading. And an inestimable amount of misinformation has circulated. I hope that this book will help remedy that. Utilizing newly discovered information about the Howards that has surfaced over the last decade or so—most of it previously revealed only on blogs for a handful of readers who are ardent fans of the writer—I hope this book will reach a wider audience, especially those who have perhaps heard of Conan but don’t really know the man behind the character. I’ve attempted to present this material in such a way that the seasoned fan of Howard, the newly introduced curiosity seeker, and those who have never heard of the man will all benefit from reading the book. Robert E. Howard is an important writer, in both early twentiethcentury literature and popular culture. He is especially important to the state of Texas, and being among the state’s earliest writers, he should be recognized as one of the state’s own. Howard’s works have reached millions around the world, been translated into multiple languages, and have had a great impact on popular culture. This is why, now more than ever, the question, Who is Robert E. Howard? is a critical question for us to ask. This book is my answer to it.\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 4\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\nChapter One\n\nPioneering Stories The Family of Robert E. Howard\n\nI suppose I’ve done less traveling than any of my family, for hundreds of years back. They were always a race of wanderers, all branches of my various lines, and seldom stayed long in the locality in which they were born. Robert E. Howard, in a letter to August Derleth, January 1934\n\nT\n\nhere are two roads one might travel to encounter Robert E. Howard.1 There is the shorter and more direct route, filled with tall tales and the typical family struggles, care, and protection. This road winds its way to Robert from his parents. The other, longer route runs through hills and plains, rivers and native people—the landscape of Texas, where Robert was born and raised. The first road is a private path, one that Robert for the most part kept to himself. He rarely lived apart from his parents. Family was an integral part of his life, and each parent contributed part of their own history, passions, and personality to their son. Those who are unable to visit or live in Texas can experience the second road through Robert’s stories. Texas was the architect that built Robert E. Howard into the person and writer we know today. Both roads provide a tumultuous, sometimes breathless, and always enthralling ride. And both help define the man and the writer. Almost from birth, Robert heard tales about his pioneering relatives. He was quick to repeat these stories later in life to friends and correspondents, and sometimes he used elements from them in his fiction. Many of these family stories were exaggerated in his various recitations, to which Robert brought a highly romanticized imagination. For him, the old sto-\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 5\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\n«6»\n\nRenegades and Rogues\n\nries provided a freedom he longed for but had never experienced. They recounted a way of life that seemed to him ideal but too far in the past to be realized outside of a vicarious participation in the hearing and retelling. These stories of Robert’s family and many of their Texas and southern settings shaped him and were embodied in the stories that he wrote. Robert’s mother, Hester Jane (Ervin) Howard, was born July 11, 1870, into a large affluent family in Hill County, Texas. She was the eighth child of “Colonel” George W. Ervin2 and his wife Sara Jane. All but one of her older siblings were born in Mississippi. Robert declared that his maternal grandfather “was a planter [farmer] and not a cattleman.”3 This was likely the case while the Ervins lived in Mississippi, but Mr. Ervin’s farming career was short-lived after the family moved from Mississippi to Texas in 1866. It is uncertain why they did so.4 Perhaps they were drawn there by the rapid expansion in Texas at the time, or simply by new opportunities. Whatever the reason, Mr. Ervin eventually became a businessman, operating stores and hotels, investing in real estate and mineral deposits, and for a time sitting on the board of directors for the Dallas and Wichita Railroad in Dallas. The tales that Robert told about his grandfather often portrayed a monumental character, and one wonders how much of them was true. In one account, Robert writes: My grandfather Colonel George Ervin came into Texas when it was wild and raw, and he went into New Mexico, too, long before it was a state, and worked a silver mine—and once he rode like a bat out of Hell for the Texas line with old Geronimo’s turbaned Apaches on his trail.5\n\nFor sheer action and adventure, this account is enthralling. Ervin did come to Texas with his wife and kids when it was “wild and raw” in 1866. He also owned a portion of a silver mine at Steins Pass near Steins, New Mexico, in 1889, prior to New Mexico becoming a state. The Lampasas Leader reported that Ervin took business trips to Hidalgo County, in New Mexico, to invest in a silver mine.6 This business venture garnered a modicum of fame in parts of West Texas. Even the El Paso Times reported the purchase.7 It is uncertain when Ervin began scouting Hidalgo County for silver mines. It is certain, however, that Geronimo and his Chiricahua Apache tribesmen were raiding, killing, and driving out miners in Hidalgo County and the surrounding areas. As it happened, Geronimo was captured in 1886 just forty-five miles, as the crow flies, southwest of Steins Pass. Whether or not his grandfather was actually\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 6\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\nPioneer ing Stor ies\n\n«7»\n\nchased out of the area by Apaches, Robert was captivated by the story. The circumstances and exhilarating nature of the tale are reminiscent of Howard’s action desert adventure stories featuring Francis Xavier Gordon (El Borak). It is likely that Robert heard this account about his grandfather from his mother or his step-grandmother, Alice Wynne. Robert never met his maternal grandmother, Sarah Jane Ervin. She died on June 2, 1874, possibly because of complications giving birth to her daughter Lizzie, who died shortly after Sarah.8 This was a terrible misfortune for Mr. Ervin and his family. Suddenly he became a single parent with four children still living under his roof. And on the brink of the tender age of four, Hester (Robert’s mother) lost not only a younger sister but also her mother. The burden of providing care for his children and remaining active in his business and community duties may have been softened by the older siblings’ willingness to help when they were able. George Ervin’s mother, Jane (Tennyson) Ervin, who had remained with the family after her husband died, most likely took over Sarah Jane’s role and helped raise Hester and her other grandchildren. Robert heard stories about his grandmother Sarah Jane from his mother, Hester. But the only maternal grandmother Robert knew and spent time with was Alice Wynne, Hester’s stepmother, whom George Ervin married in April 1875, about a year after Sarah Jane died. Robert had fond memories of his step-grandmother, whom he visited as a child. In a December 1932 letter to H. P. Lovecraft, he recalled one such visit: I remember the peach-cream I used to eat at my grandmother’s home, up in Missouri. She had a big orchard, including many fine trees of Elbertas, which, when allowed to ripe properly, are hard to beat. At night, when everything was still, I’d wake up occasionally and hear, in the quiet, the luscious squishy impact of the ripe peaches falling from the laden branches. These peaches, mushy-ripe, and cut up in rich creamy milk, made a frozen delicacy the like of which is not often equaled.9\n\nWhen Robert’s maternal grandfather remarried, he moved his family to Lewisville, Texas, and began investing in land with mineral deposits. It was in Lewisville that Hester began her education. Almost two years after the Ervins moved, “Lewisville opened two schools—one for whites and one for blacks—in 1877.”10 In Texas in the 1870s, children were required to begin public school, with free tuition, between ages eight and fourteen.11 Because of this law, Hester’s education began in 1878, when she was eight. Being female, she was not required, nor expected to for\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 7\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\n«8»\n\nRenegades and Rogues\n\nthat matter, to complete a public education through high school graduation. Since she could read and write, it is likely that she attended public school for at least six years, if not longer.12 However long her education, Hester was devoted to the task. She had a passion for literature, poetry, and especially drama and stage performance. Later in life, Dr. Howard recalled that “Robert’s mother was a poet. She also loved the stage. It was her ambition when a young girl to prepare herself for the stage, but her father opposed it. She often spoke of it as a great disappointment. I am sure she had the talent.”13 She instilled this passion in her son, reading and reciting literature and poetry to him as a child. “Written poetry by sheets and reams, almost books of it, was stored in her memory so that from Robert’s babyhood he had heard its recital. Day by [day,] he heard poetry from his mother.”14 Her devotion to poetry instilled a passion for the craft in her son. Robert penned over seven hundred poems, and many were published in various magazines and anthologies. In addition to reading poetry and literature to her son, Hester probably taught Robert to read and write early enough in his life that he was relatively proficient at both by the time he began his own formal education. In late 1885, a few months after Hester’s fifteenth birthday, the Ervins moved from Lewisville to Lampasas, Texas. There were any number of reasons for this move. Most likely, Mr. Ervin heard about the newly discovered Hancock mineral springs, which had made Lampasas a health resort town. His mother (Robert’s great-grandmother) was aging, so it is possible that the move was made so that she could benefit from the mineral springs. Shortly after relocating to Lampasas, Ervin, keeping to his typical business practices, invested in land. The family settled into a large two-story house where Mrs. Alice (Wynne) Ervin cared for her young children15 and her husband’s aging mother. Sometime later, at the age of seventeen, Hester lost her paternal grandmother, Jane (Tennyson) Ervin. This left the Ervin family with no real reason to remain in Lampasas, other than Ervin’s land investments, which were eventually sold. By 1890, when Hester was twenty years old, her family had moved to Exeter, Missouri. Up to this point, Hester’s family had moved four times, enabling her perhaps to cultivate a unique patience for the transient lifestyle that she would later experience with Robert’s father, Dr. Isaac Howard. In Exeter, Hester spent most of her time helping her stepmother settle into their house and caring for her younger stepsiblings. Between 1891 and 1904, she had no prospective suitors. She did, however, have robust\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 8\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\nPioneer ing Stor ies\n\n«9»\n\nfinancial support from her father and a substantial amount of freedom. Being a social butterfly, she took advantage of both and traveled to Texas to visit her siblings. Hester’s older brother, William V. Ervin, had married Ida Ezzell and, in doing so, inadvertently embarked on a career in journalism. In Robert Lee, Texas, he became the proprietor of the local newspaper, The Rustler.16 Sometime later, William and Ida moved to Ferris, Texas, where William purchased and operated another newspaper, the Ferris Wheel.17 On several occasions, Hester visited Ferris, Texas, and the friends she made there among her older brother William’s inlaws, especially Frank Ezzell, would have an indelible impact on her life. Her visits and relationships in Ferris would have a ripple effect later in her life on the Howard family dynamic. During her visits to Ferris, Hester befriended her brother’s sister-inlaw Lesta (Ezzell) McCarson and his business partner Frank Ezzell, who was Lesta’s brother. Her friendship with Lesta McCarson lasted the rest of her life. It was probably through Lesta that Hester met Frank. Beginning in May 1899,18 Hester stayed in Ferris for six weeks at Lesta McCarson’s home. During her stay, and most likely during her previous visits to Ferris, Hester spent large blocks of time with the Ezzell family. This included time spent with Frank Ezzell. Frank and Hester may have gone on several outings together or spent long hours at Lesta’s home conversing over tea or coffee. According to the “1900 census, Frank Ezell is found living at the house of his sister Lesta, in Ferris, in the very house Hester Jane had spent six weeks in the year before.”19 Frank was about the same age as Hester, and it is possible that a romance developed between them during this time. Years later, it was reported by Annie Newton Davis,20 a neighbor of the Howards in Cross Cut, Texas, that “Mrs. [Hester] Howard was in love with a friend, had been, a young man. And she expected to marry him.” While Annie Newton Davis could not recall the young man’s first name, she did declare that his last name was Ezzell, confirming the likelihood that it was none other than Frank whom Hester had expected to marry.21 In the summer of 1899, after her six-week visit, Hester left Ferris and traveled to see a sister in Abilene, Texas. She remained in Abilene a little over a year. By 1901, she had moved to Mineral Wells, Texas, to live with another relative. It is reasonable to think that while in Abilene and Mineral Wells, Hester corresponded with her good friend Lesta McCarson and kept up with the goings-on of Frank Ezzell and the Ferris Wheel. It is also conceivable that during this period Hester waited for Frank Ezzell to propose marriage. However, since no letters to or from Hester exist for\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 9\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\n« 10 » Renegades and Rogues\n\nthis period, and the only known surviving copies of the Ferris Wheel end with the September 9, 1899, issue,22 whether Frank intended to propose to Hester remains a mystery. By 1903, Hester was thirty-three and had never married. Socially she may have been feeling some pressure to tie the knot, especially since women in the late 1800s and early 1900s were typically married before their midtwenties. Even so, she enjoyed her freedom, her ability to travel, and her time spent with friends and family. She may have also still been waiting on Frank Ezzell’s proposal. Whatever the case, while Hester lived in Mineral Wells, Annie Newton Davis recalled, “this dashing young doctor came along, and she hurriedly married him. Then the rest of her life, she lived in disappointment.”23 To what degree Hester was unhappy in her marriage to Dr. Howard will never be known. Annie Newton Davis also reported that Hester spent time around Goldthwaite, Texas—more specifically, in a town between Goldthwaite and Lampasas called Lometa, where several of the Ezzell family members retired.24 This information certainly implies that Hester kept in contact with the Ezzell family. Moreover, it’s not known if Robert was aware that his mother was in love with another possible suitor before meeting his father. Robert never discussed the situation in any of his letters, not even with his closest friends. He may have simply never been told. Frank Ezzell remained single the rest of his life and did well for himself financially. He died in 1947. Is it possible that he intended to propose to Hester only to discover that she had married Dr. Howard? Did Hester simply tire of waiting for Frank to propose? Unfortunately, answers to questions regarding Frank and Hester were lost with their deaths. Hester did, however, maintain contact with the Ezzell family the rest of her life, and she and Lesta remained close friends. Through Lesta, Hester may have maintained contact with Frank or received updates about his life and whereabouts.25 Possibly testifying to Hester’s frustration was the report from neighbors that on certain occasions Dr. Howard declared that Hester had kicked him out of their home.26 If this is true, Robert must have known that something was amiss between his parents. And yet he remained silently stoic. Robert’s father, Dr. Isaac Mordecai Howard, was a persuasive and charming man who had a confident manner, good listening skills, and an acutely honed ability as a master storyteller. He easily adapted to almost any situation and was highly ambitious. All things considered, it is understandable that Hester fell so easily and quickly in love with him. However, unlike Hester’s father George Ervin, Isaac Howard was not\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 10\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\nPioneer ing Stor ies\n\n« 11 »\n\nan astute and savvy businessman. He remained poor his entire life, and Hester seems to have struggled with the lack of money in the household. Isaac Mordecai Howard was born on April 1, 1872,27 to poor struggling farmers in Ouachita County, Arkansas. Poverty and the struggle to overcome it would occupy the larger part of his entire life. Isaac’s parents, William Benjamin and Louisa “Eliza” (short for Elizabeth) Henry Howard, had nine children. Isaac was their eighth child and fift h son. All their children were born in Arkansas except their eldest, Mary Elizabeth, who was born in Mississippi. Writing about the paternal side of his family, Robert declared: My branch of the Howards came to America with Oglethorpe [in] 1733 and lived in various parts of Georgia for over a hundred years. In [18]49 three brothers started for California. On the Arkansaw River they split up, one went on to California where he lived the rest of his life, one went back to Georgia and one, William Benjamin Howard, went to Mississippi where he became an overseer on the plantations of Squire James Harrison Henry, whose daughter he married.28\n\nRobert’s paternal grandfather, William B. Howard, about whom Robert heard many a tale from his own father, began his farming career on his future in-laws’ plantation in Mississippi. It was there that he met and married Eliza Henry, while working for her father, James W. Henry.29 A few years after William and Eliza married, both the Henry and Howard families moved to Arkansas. The Howards stayed in Arkansas until Eliza’s father, James W. Henry, died in July 1884, leaving his family a small fortune, $30,000, to be split eleven ways, between his wife and ten children. With their portion of the inheritance, William and Eliza Howard moved to Hill County, Texas. Having heard, as a youngster, wild-eyed tales about his paternal grandfather working on a plantation, southern plantations would loom large in much of Robert’s horror and weird fiction. Her father’s experience and success in Texas was probably one reason Eliza Howard gave her husband the idea of moving to a still relatively feral state. Eliza’s father, James W. Henry (Robert’s great-grandfather), upon forced retirement from service in the Confederate Army during the Civil War,30 moved from Arkansas to Texas while it was still a frontier. “He took his slaves and went to Texas where he raised cotton until the end of the war, hiding bales so cleverly that even the carpet-baggers couldn’t find them.” Robert claimed that his great-grandfather was quite\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 11\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\n« 12 »\n\nRenegades and Rogues\n\nsuccessful at this cotton venture. It lasted several years, avoiding the Comanches who roamed the Texas countryside and potential revolts by his slaves because of the Civil War. James W. Henry “was the only Southerner I ever heard of who made more money at the close of the Civil War than he had at the beginning.”31 Though Robert was often prone to telling (and hearing) tall tales about his family, considering that James W. Henry moved back to Arkansas and had $30,000 to disperse among his children and wife upon his death, this story is likely for the most part true. William and Eliza, along with their kids, moved to Hill County, Texas, in 1884, when Isaac was twelve. A short time later, in 1887, Isaac lost his older brother, James H. Howard, and then his father, William B. Howard, died in late 1888.32 The causes of their deaths are unknown. With both men gone, his brother David Terrell Howard (born in March 1866), who was nearly six years older than Isaac, became the head of the Howard family. Eventually the Howards ended up in Limestone County, Texas, as farmers, and most of the family except Isaac remained there. It is uncertain what the relationship was like between David and Isaac at the time of their father’s death. David was “described by his family as ‘a very stern man and hard to work for.’”33 There was immense difference between David and Isaac Howard. When suddenly made head of the family at an early age, David quickly developed a stern sense of responsibility and a need to be firmly grounded, anchored in one place, in order to rise to the task of providing for his family. Isaac, even as a child, was always fiercely independent, a trait he later handed down to his son Robert. Discontented with the notion of being tied to one place or forced to do something undesirable, Isaac was consumed with wanderlust. According to several of his nieces and nephews, he was “not content on the family farm in Limestone County and decided, instead, to practice medicine.”34 In March 1885, Isaac struck a deal with his brother to sell his half of a hundred-acre tract of land for $140. David “put a down payment of ‘ten dollars cash in hand’ and agreed to pay the rest by November 1, 1895.”35 The interesting thing about this situation is that Isaac was thirteen years old in March 1885. At such a young age, he already had other plans besides farming. Isaac’s proclivity for adventure and regular change was beginning to germinate. But David did not fulfill his side of the agreement by the agreed-upon date. It took three additional years before the sale was completed and filed, on February 12, 1898, when Isaac was twenty-six. So what happened to Isaac in the years between these two documents?\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 12\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\nPioneer ing Stor ies\n\n« 13 »\n\nMarch 1885 to April 1899 was a critical time for Isaac. After agreeing to sell his portion of the family land to his brother, he probably finished his education and graduated from high school before turning his attention to his chosen profession. Where he studied medicine has garnered much speculation. It is often assumed that he went back to Arkansas to apprentice with his maternal uncle, J. T. Henry, “an 1873 graduate of the Medical Department at the University of Nashville [who] was practicing medicine in Eagle Mills, back in Ouachita County, Arkansas.”36 In those days, it was common for a young man to apprentice with a seasoned physician who was also a family member. And J. T. Henry had a good reputation and strong credentials. Since Isaac was fresh out of high school, it is possible that his mother helped him get a ticket on a coach or train and sent him to her brother in Arkansas to follow his dream of becoming a medical doctor.37 If this is what happened, then Isaac apprenticed with J. T. Henry for about eight or nine years, which is a long time to be an apprentice. Perhaps Isaac waited a year or two after high school before starting his apprenticeship. Isaac did have local apprenticeship options. In late 1893, when Isaac was twenty-two, David Howard married Fannie Elizabeth Wortham, who came from a family with several physicians. Fannie’s father was a medical doctor in Prairie Hill, Texas, where the Henrys and Worthams lived. She also had a sister whose husband was a medical doctor in the adjacent county. What this means is that “in the early 1890s we’ve got a young Isaac Howard, purportedly not interested in the family business of farming. He’s got a doctor uncle in far-off Arkansas who seems to be doing pretty well for himself, and his older brother Dave marries into a family with at least two doctors, one of whom is practicing in the very town in which they live, the other in a nearby county.”38 Keep in mind, during this same time Isaac and David were in the middle of their land agreement. And David may have been making incremental payments to Isaac, who could have used that money to pay David’s doctor in-laws to train him in the practice. Whether Isaac traveled to Arkansas or stayed in Texas, on “April 19, 1899, [he] was granted a ‘Certificate of Qualification to Practice Medicine in all its branches throughout the State of Texas’ by the Medical Board of Examiners, Fift h Judicial District, Texarkana, Texas.”39 With his freshly printed certificate and a sudden and vast amount of independence, Dr. Howard found himself free to navigate the map in search of people to help. Howard never settled down in a large city, such as San Antonio, Dallas, or Houston, to practice medicine. Instead, he moved from one\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 13\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\n« 14 »\n\nRenegades and Rogues\n\nsmall town to another, never really staying more than two or so years in a single place. He was a skilled doctor with a wonderful bedside manner, excellent people skills, and a healthy compassion for humanity. But these same traits often hurt him financially. Robert confirmed this when he declared, “There is no better physician in the state of Texas, though there are many who have made more of a financial success. The reason he is not a rich man is because he’s been more interested in humanity than in dollars.” Robert further explained that his father often refused money from his poorer farming clients in these smaller communities. “The charity work he’s done would run up into the hundred thousands, and the bills people have beat him out of would about equal that figure.”40 While that figure is probably exaggerated, the circumstances are not. Dr. Howard could have been wealthier had he demanded monetary payment from all his clients. But as Robert revealed, his father’s compassion for those in need outweighed his desire for monetary gain. Once Howard earned his state Board of Medical Examiners certificate, “the first place he appears is Freestone County, [Texas,] where he registers his new credentials on July 20, 1899.”41 Eventually, he worked between Freestone and Limestone Counties for about two years before he moved to Montague County, Texas, in May 1901. He had an uncle, George Walser, who lived in Montague County. Interestingly, Robert used that great-uncle’s last name as a nom de plume—Sam Walser—for several stories published in the spicy pulp magazines, like Spicy Adventure Stories. George Walser may be the reason Dr. Howard registered to practice medicine in that county. However, in the early twentieth century, the populations of several Texas counties that bordered the Red River were booming owing to railroads and the discovery of oil. His adventurous spirit and what he thought were open doors to opportunity led Dr. Howard to migrate to boomtowns. In addition to Montague County, the 1902 Polk’s Medical Register and Directory of North America shows Dr. Isaac Howard living and practicing medicine in Petersburg, Oklahoma, “just across the Red River in Indian Territory, and not far from where his sister Willie had moved after marrying Oscar McClung.”42 He very likely may have made this move to help his sister raise her children while her husband Oscar was in prison. By 1902, Dr. Howard was registered and practicing medicine back in Palo Pinto County, Texas. He practiced there for several years, making trips to Mineral Wells, Texas, the largest town in the county and a flourishing hot spot for tourists and businesses. On one of these visits to Mineral Wells between 1903 and 1904, Isaac Howard met the love of his\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 14\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\nPioneer ing Stor ies\n\n« 15 »\n\nlife, Hester Ervin. The two dated for a short spell and married on January 12, 1904. He was almost two years younger than Hester, as she probably discovered while they dated. At the time, patriarchal social conventions indicated that the male in a married couple ought to be older than the female. It is not known whether Hester revealed her actual age to her husband, but since neither of them was prone to convention, her age probably did not matter.43 Around the time Dr. Howard and Miss Ervin were married, the medical industry began to change, with “physicians in larger cities in Texas pushing for stronger regulation of medical education and licensure.” To strengthen his credentials and education, Dr. Howard began correspondence courses at Gate City College of Medicine and School of Pharmacy in Texarkana. In 1903, the Arkansas State Medical Association (ASMA) determined that Gate City College was a fraudulent school, merely a “diploma mill.” But before the ASMA could shut the school down, Gate City College relocated to Texas. Dr. Howard received a diploma from the school in 1905. The school continued to operate in Texas until “the newly created Board of Medical Examiners in November of 1907 [began] to bar graduates of the school from examination, and thus from licensure, in the state.” Fortunately for Dr. Howard, when the new Board of Medical Examiners in Texas was created, “doctors currently practicing were ‘grandfathered in,’ and he would have been no exception, but now he had a medical degree.”44 Being grandfathered in allowed Dr. Howard to continue his practice and have his medical degree recognized as legitimate. Even so, he would later attend reputable medical schools, such as the Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, to strengthen his education and credentials. On May 12, 1905, just weeks after receiving his medical degree from Gate City College of Medicine, Dr. Howard registered his new credentials at the Parker County courthouse in Weatherford, Texas. Parker County is adjacent to Palo Pinto County, so he could now work in both counties, which he did until 1908. While the Howards spent most of their early marriage living in Christian and Oran, Texas, by late 1905 they had settled, at least temporarily, in Peaster, Texas (Parker County), where they made plans to begin a family.\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 15\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\nChapter Two\n\nFrom Birth to Bagwell\n\nMy family has been prone to follow booms, and I have lived in oil boom towns, land boom towns, railroad boom towns, and have seen life in its crudest and most elemental forms. Robert E. Howard, Argosy All-Star Magazine, July 20, 1929\n\nT\n\nhe past few days have been so warm and pleasant that work is the only thing upon the minds of everybody. The rattle of the trace chains, the sound of corn dropping in the feed trough at daybreak, the clicking of the stalk-cutter, the fire and smoke leaping toward Heavens, the ‘clinking’ of the blacksmith hammer on the anvil, and the jolly ha! ha! of the country merchant, presents to one’s mind the sublimity of a country life.”1 So reported the special correspondent from Peaster, Texas, to the Weatherford Daily Herald on January 26, 1906. In this unseasonal warmth and bustle, Dr. Isaac M. and Hester Howard gave birth to an unexpected boy. And though Dr. and Mrs. Howard could have never known the fate of their child, each would play a pivotal role in who this boy became. In the first few years of their marriage, the Howards had trouble conceiving. Given Mrs. Howard’s age, there was probably some urgency on her part to have children right away. When the trouble ensued, the couple approached Dr. Howard’s brother, David Terrell Howard, who was still “farming in Limestone County at the time, some 125 miles southeast of Christian, and had quite a large family (six children in 1904, and twelve before he was finished having children in 1919).”2 The Howards asked David about adopting his youngest child, Wallace. As an adult,\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 16\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\nFrom Birth to Bagwell\n\n« 17 »\n\nWallace Howard confirmed that this happened when he declared, “They come to mama and papa and wanted to take me and raise me as their— their foster-son.”3 By 1905, while the Howard brothers were discussing the possible adoption, Mrs. Howard discovered that she was pregnant. And on January 22, 1906, in Peaster, Texas, the Howards received the pleasant surprise of the birth of Robert Ervin Howard, named after his great-grandfather, Robert Ervin.4 Mrs. Howard was approaching thirty-six years of age when she gave birth to her son. Besides being old enough to be at risk of medical complications, Mrs. Howard, in 1906, faced the even greater risk of being at the mercy of the archaic state of medicine and its practice in those days. Despite the risks, Robert was born without complications. There are various discrepancies regarding the actual date of Robert E. Howard’s birth on official state documents and landmarks.5 The attending physician in Peaster, J. A. Williams, recorded January 24, 1906, as the date of Robert’s birth on the birth certificate filed at the Parker County courthouse—the same date that is recorded on the Parker County birth registry. However, the Howard family Bible6 has Robert’s birth date as January 22, 1906. Robert himself indicated that his date of birth was January 22,7 and that same birth date appears on his death certificate. More than likely, J. A. Williams made a simple clerical error. Shortly before Robert was born, Polk’s Medical Register and Directory for 1904 listed the Howards’ place of residency in Christian, Texas, which no longer exists.8 A year later, the Weatherford Weekly Herald declared, “Drs. Blackwell and Howard will soon have under construction a nice office which will add to their convenience and that of the patient very much.”9 The implication is that, around September 1905, the Howards moved from Christian to Peaster so that Dr. Howard could partner with Dr. Blackwell. Around this same time, Dr. Howard began making land purchases in Oran, Texas. Hester probably planted this idea in her husband’s mind, inspired by her father’s tremendous success at land investments. In addition, the Texas and Pacific Railway had announced its intent to lay tracks from Mineral Wells to Salesville, Oran, and on to Graford in 1907. Anticipating that Oran would become a railroad boomtown, Dr. Howard had a potent incentive to buy land plots in those areas while he and Hester resided in Peaster. Peaster, Texas, was established as a single-family settlement in the 1870s when a pioneer from Georgia—H. H. Peaster—purchased 160 acres of land nine miles northwest of Weatherford. A small community rose up next to his land and called itself Freemont. Later, in 1885, the community\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 17\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\n« 18 » Renegades and Rogues\n\nchanged the name to Peasterville, in homage to its first settler. During the decade prior to the twentieth century, the town shortened its name to Peaster and established US postal service. The population of Peaster at the time was around 100 people.10 When Robert was born, Peaster had been a town for only thirty-six years but had grown to a population of 260. The town had a dozen businesses, a gristmill, several churches, and even a small school. It was an agricultural community producing mainly grain, wheat, and cotton. A month after Robert was born, the Weatherford Weekly Herald declared, “Dr. Howard is boasting of the only boy baby of Peaster in 1906.”11 It had appeared that Dr. Howard might keep his family in Peaster, but they moved thirty-five miles west to the Dark Valley region shortly after Robert’s birth. The move from Peaster to Dark Valley was unusual, especially since Dr. Howard had already established a partnering medical practice in Peaster. This move is a prime example of Dr. Howard’s restlessness. For the better part of Robert’s formative years, Dr. Howard’s wandering spirit would keep his family assiduously roaming. Even so, the proximity of Dark Valley to Peaster was such that Dr. Howard could travel between the two when necessary. Though Robert was just an infant when the Howards lived in Dark Valley, he claimed to have had ominous memories of the area, and he attributed the gloominess of his own nature to having lived there. Dark Valley was “a long, narrow valley, lonesome and isolated, up in the Palo Pinto hill country.”12 This description, from a letter to his friend H. P. Lovecraft, is accurate even today. Robert’s account became even gloomier. “So high were the ridges, so thick and tall the oak trees that it was shadowy, even in the daytime, and at night it was as dark as a pine forest— and nothing is darker in this world.” Trying to impress Lovecraft, Robert shifted his narrative of Dark Valley to one more akin to his horror fiction, exaggerating its dismal effect. “The creatures of the night whispered and called to one another, faint night winds murmured through the leaves and now and then among the slightly waving branches could be glimpsed the gleam of a distant star. Surely the silence, the brooding loneliness, the shadowy mysticism of that lonesome valley entered in some part into my vague-forming nature.”13 However embellished this account, it seems that Dark Valley did play a germane role in Robert’s life, since similar settings eventually appeared in his stories. While in Dark Valley, the Howards lived with W. H. Green and his wife Nora. Their house was nestled next to Dark Valley Creek, just northwest of the Brazos River.14 The Howards stayed with the Greens temporarily while their own house was being built in nearby Oran. A birth cer-\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 18\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\nFrom Birth to Bagwell\n\n« 19 »\n\ntificate is on file in the Palo Pinto County courthouse for the Greens’ daughter, who was born July 26, 1906, probably while the Howards were staying with the Greens. Dr. Howard’s signature confirms that he was the attending physician. Within eighteen months of Robert’s birth, he became restless, sickly, and cried relentlessly. Whatever Robert suffered from is not known since Mrs. Howard never revealed or even suggested what the issue might have been. Nonetheless, in the last few months of her life Mrs. Howard confessed to her caregiver, Kate Merryman, that the situation with Robert may have caused her to miscarry a second pregnancy. She explained that Robert would cry for hours and hours, and so she would “jiggle the bedsprings” and bounce him on the bed to soothe him.15 When she grew tired of bouncing him on top of the bed, she would place Robert on the bed, lie on her back, and use her legs and feet to bounce the bed. Mrs. Howard assumed that this caused her miscarriage. Of course, Dr. and Mrs. Howard probably never said as much to their son, not wanting him to blame himself. The experience certainly reinforced Mrs. Howard’s protective instincts for her only child. From then on, she vigilantly guarded her son, as any mother would have done under the circumstances. The Howards lived in Dark Valley for at least a year before moving to Oran, Texas, in late May of 1907. Having made multiple land purchases, they seemed to be preparing to settle down in Oran. And they did for a brief seven months—from May until early December—while Dr. Howard practiced medicine in and around the Oran area. His land purchases appeared to be sound investments. By this time, the T&P Railroad had laid tracks and the train was traveling from Weatherford to Oran. As people began to migrate into the area, the town grew. The area around Oran was conducive to cotton farming, and Oran soon gained a cotton gin, a livery stable, and even a weekly paper. But the growth would not last. The boll weevil destroyed the cotton crops, causing a small exodus of farmers from Oran to other more productive areas and leaving Oran with around forty people. If the land purchases had been closer to Mineral Wells or Weatherford, they would have been better investments. But since they were in Oran, a place whose agricultural fortunes had withered, they failed. On December 20, 1907, Dr. Howard reregistered his medical license at the Palo Pinto County courthouse to record his change of address to Oran, Texas. A few days later, and with payments still due on their land purchases, the Howards moved west to Seminole, Texas. At this time,\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 19\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\n« 20 » Renegades and Rogues\n\nRobert was approaching the age of two. On their way to Seminole, they took a slight southward detour to visit Hester’s older brother, William Vinson Ervin, in Big Spring, Texas.16 William Ervin was the editor of the Big Spring newspaper, the Enterprise. As folks were prone to do back then, Ervin announced Dr. Howard’s stay in Big Spring in the January 3, 1908, issue of the paper. He reported that Dr. Howard left for Seminole on the previous Monday, December 30, to determine if his family might settle there. In this same report, Ervin gave his readers a short description of Dr. Howard: “He is a polished gentleman, a fine physician and the people of that town will be fortunate if he decides to locate there.”17 A follow-up report published on January 24, 1908, explained that one or more of the Howards had become ill while Dr. Howard was in Seminole and that this was the reason for the three-week delay in their move. The Howards had finally left at the first of that week to relocate to Seminole.18 This would put the Howards in Seminole by the end of January 1908, the same month Robert turned two. From 1905 to 1906, a few years prior to the Howards’ arrival in Seminole, Gaines County was established and a group of New York investors purchased land in the area and donated it to the county, which divided it and sold it in small lots. There was no real reason to move to Seminole in the early 1900s other than western expansion in Texas and the availability of inexpensive land, but apparently this was enough for the hundreds of people who settled in the area. The news about inexpensive land in Gaines County spread far and wide. Over six hundred miles away, the Brownsville Daily Herald in Brownsville, Texas, announced on June 21, 1907, that state land was for sale in Gaines County. The article declared, “Because of the new land law, J. T. Robinson, chief clerk of the General Land Office, has had circulars printed, showing the procedure one must go through to acquire this land. There are now 1,000 sections which will go on the market.”19 The article reported that Gaines County had three sections of land that would be available in August and October of that same year. This was one of the final waves of western expansion in Texas and was set in motion primarily by the control and removal a few decades earlier of the Native Americans who once roamed and hunted over Texas and its neighboring states. Robert was raised listening to many accounts of Texas expansion and Native American stories. The Howards’ participation in that period of historical Texas expansion, with their move to Seminole, ultimately played a pivotal role in Robert’s life as a writer. The first wave of settlers, which included the Howards, suffered se-\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 20\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\nFrom Birth to Bagwell\n\n« 21 »\n\nvere hardship. Because water was scarce in the area, lumber had to be freighted in from nearby Big Spring and Midland, and there was little farming. Food, clothing, and most all other supplies had to be hauled to Seminole by freight wagons.20 The earliest industry in Seminole was cattle, which began almost simultaneously with the selling of land lots in the area. Several decades after the Howards had already left Seminole, irrigation was established, making the area safer and easier for farming and leading to a more substantial population boom than in the early 1900s. On February 3, 1908, a few weeks after their arrival, Dr. Howard registered his medical license with Gaines County.21 Almost immediately he was busy. The lack of water in the area was detrimental to early settlers, and the hot West Texas temperatures took a steep toll on some of the people. Several settlers became severely dehydrated. While growth in the area was steady, the poor conditions made Seminole’s future look bleak. The Howards stayed less than a year, probably owing to the harsh conditions and the delayed construction of a railway connection into town. The last known date for the Howards in Seminole is July 24, 1908, the day Dr. Howard filed a register of death for an infant at the Gaines County courthouse. Shortly thereafter, it is likely that the Howards traveled back to Big Spring to regroup and rest, but not for long. If they did in fact rest in Big Spring for a brief spell, it would certainly explain why they soon found themselves in Bronte, Texas. On September 14, 1908, Dr. Howard filed his medical license at the Coke County courthouse.22 This was followed by an indication in the Texas State Journal of Medicine of an address change for the Howards between February 15 and March 18, 1909.23 Dr. Howard moved his family from Seminole to Bronte in Coke County, north of San Angelo, shortly after Robert turned three. The likeliest reason the Howards chose to move to Bronte was news regarding completion of the Kansas City, Mexico, and Orient Railway in 1907, making Bronte a railroad boomtown. Hester’s brother in Big Spring, William V. Ervin, had once lived in the town of Robert Lee, just twelve miles west of Bronte. William may have informed the Howards about the potential boom in the area due to the upcoming railway service. The primary agriculture in the county—cotton—also brought a continuous flow of new people migrating to the area. To accommodate the railway, Bronte relocated a mile closer to where the tracks would be laid so that when the first train arrived the community would be prepared to use the railway for its cotton commerce.24 After Dr. Howard filed his medical license in Coke County, he\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 21\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\n« 22 »\n\nRenegades and Rogues\n\nwasted little time getting involved in the community. He was the attending physician for several births25 and provided other medical services when needed. By 1910, Bronte’s population was over six hundred, and the town had a bank, two cotton gins, and a newspaper. Even so, in predictable fashion, the Howards would stay there only about a year before uprooting and moving again. Robert mentioned the town only once in passing when he gave accounts of the various places where his family had lived in his early years. Apparently, the town left little to no impression on him. But as we will see, the incessant travel did. The Howards left Bronte in early September 1909.26 Their whereabouts up to November 20, 1909, remain, for the most part, a mystery.27 However, recent research seems to indicate that during this three-month hiatus the Howards were braving the length of the Nueces River in a covered wagon, traveling to Crystal City, Texas.28 This excursion—one of Robert’s earliest memories—instilled in him a romantic passion for pioneer life. The experience of the covered wagon, the river, the wildlife, and outdoor cooking and living carved a deep notch into the psyche of the young lad. In a nostalgic attempt to revive the romance of this early experience, Robert revisited the area as an adult, but was sorely disappointed. He briefly described both trips to his friend Lovecraft: And one of my earliest memories is being lulled to sleep in a covered wagon camped on the Nueces River, by the howling of wolves. When they built Crystal City twenty years ago in Zavalla county, some forty miles from the Mexican Border, the wolves came howling to the edge of the clearings. The woods were full of wildcats, panthers and javelinas, the lakes were full of fish and alligators. I was back there a couple of years ago and was slightly depressed at the signs of civilization which disfigured the whole country.29\n\nThe letter is dated October 1930, and Robert declared that the covered wagon trip occurred “twenty-years ago.” As people are often prone to do, Robert probably rounded his time frame to the nearest whole number, give or take a few years. This would make him three to four years of age at the time, and the year around 1909 to 1910. He thought it important to mention Crystal City by name, which is next to the Nueces River in the lower Rio Grande Valley. Another reason for the family to visit Crystal City was that Dr. Howard had a sister—Willie Price Howard McClung—who lived there. Her daughter, Fanny McClung Adamson, confirmed the Howards’ visit to Crystal City when she declared, “We must\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 22\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\nFrom Birth to Bagwell\n\n« 23 »\n\nhave moved there [Crystal City] in 1908 and it was either 1909 or 1910 when he [Dr. Howard and family] was there.”30 The experience in the lower Rio Grande Valley in the covered wagon is also found in a letter that Robert wrote to the editor of Dime Sports Magazine, published in June 1936: About the first half of my life was spent in various parts of West, East and South Texas and western Oklahoma, mostly following land booms and railroad booms. As a child I crossed the South Plains, not in a covered wagon indeed, but in a buggy, in what was about the last big colonization movement in Texas—the settlement of the Great Plains. (I did go down the Nueces in a covered wagon.) I also saw the beginning of the development of the Lower Rio Grande Valley. The last half of my life has been lived in the oil-belt towns of Central West Texas.31\n\nCrystal City was established in 1905 with the purchase of ten thousand acres of land by Carl F. Groos and E. J. Buckingham. The land was sold to buyers as farmland and the settlement was fully established by 1908 when the area received its US post office. Around 1909 or 1910—about the time the Howards arrived—people were coming from various locales to settle in and around the area. The town was incorporated in 1910, the same year that the Uvalde Railway established service to the area and the first school was being built. So Robert did in fact witness the beginning of the development of the Lower Rio Grande Valley. From November 20, 1909, to around the beginning of January 1910, the Howards stayed in San Antonio. On January 8, shortly before Robert’s fourth birthday, Dr. Howard registered his medical credentials in Atascosa County to practice medicine in the area. That registration indicated a mailing address in Poteet, just south of San Antonio. Additionally, according to the Texas State Journal of Medicine, a “J. M. Howard” changed addresses from Bronte to Poteet between January 20 and February 20, 1910.32 Following the paper trail, the family’s next appearance is in the May 16, 1910, census, which lists them as living back in Palo Pinto County (Oran, Graford, Dark Valley, and so on).33 Polk’s Medical Register for that same year has Dr. Howard listed as residing in Graford, Texas. So their stay in Poteet was a meager four months.34 In several of his letters, Robert mentions that as a child he lived on a ranch in south Texas.35 The location of this ranch has never been determined, but it is likely to have been close to Poteet in Atascosa County. By this time in the Howards’ nomadic lives, Robert was four years old\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 23\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\n« 24 »\n\nRenegades and Rogues\n\nand his family had moved six times, in addition to visits to several locales for brief spans. Robert was gaining a strong sense of freedom during this period of his life, and the nomadic lives of several of his most popular fictional protagonists would clearly reflect this part of his early life. These frequent changes of address and travels around Texas at such an early age inculcated in Robert a deep sense of adventure and a peripatetic spirit that would characterize his later stories. The likeliest reason for the Howards’ move back to Palo Pinto County in the late spring of 1910, aside from Dr. Howard’s incessant wanderlust, was its familiarity: they had lived there before. In addition, Dr. Howard still owned land in Palo Pinto County, and it was finally paid off in May 1908. In late December 1910, Dr. Howard’s name begins to appear on several birth certificates in Palo Pinto, listing his address in Oran. In January 1911, Robert would be five. Based on birth and death certificates and the “Purely Personal” section of Weatherford’s Daily Herald, the Howards stayed in Oran for nearly two years.36 The Howards had never lived this long in any one area since Robert’s birth. Being five to nearly seven years old at the time, Robert was old enough to recall details about Palo Pinto County and Oran. He had also heard fascinating stories and some tall tales about the pioneers and Native Americans in the region. Palo Pinto County was first settled by cattlemen who braved the frontier when it was largely populated by the Comanche and Kiowa. In 1857, a twenty-one-year-old open-range cattleman named Charles Goodnight settled in Black Springs (present-day Oran) in the Keechi Valley. Goodnight was “destined to become one of the most famous cattlemen in Texas, and one of the originators of the great cattle drives.” Soon after he settled in Black Springs, 1860 would go on record as one of the “bloodiest years on the frontier.”37 In the winter of that year, Goodnight would lead a posse of eight men in search of a band of Comanche raiders led by Peta Nocona. Nocona and his raiders had not only killed several settlers in the area but earlier that year may have killed another cattle rancher named John Brown. Brown had been the husband of Mary (Brown) Crawford,38 whom the Howards knew in Oran. In a letter to Lovecraft, Robert retold a story that Mary Crawford related to him when he was an impressionable six-year-old. “I remember the story she used to tell of the fate of her first husband, a Mr. Brown, in the year 1872.”39 He continued: “One evening some of the stock failed to come up and Mr. Brown decided to go look for them. The Browns lived in a big two-storied ranch-house, several miles from the nearest settle-\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 24\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\nFrom Birth to Bagwell\n\n« 25 »\n\nment—Black Springs.” Robert explained that Brown heard the sound of a horse-bell fastened to one of his horses. Knowing his horses must be close by, Brown walked in the direction of the sound: Mrs. Brown stood on the porch of the ranch-house and watched her husband striding off among the mesquites, while beyond him the bell tinkled incessantly. She was a strange woman who saw visions, and claimed the gift of second sight. Smitten with premonition, but held by the fatalism of the pioneers, she saw Brown disappear among the mesquites. The tinkling bell seemed slowly to recede until the tiny sound died out entirely. Brown did not reappear, and the clouds hung like a grey shroud, a cold wind shook the bare limbs and shuddered among the dead grasses, and she knew he would never return.\n\nJohn Brown, attacked by a raiding band of Comanches, was scalped and killed. The Comanches stole his horses and headed straight for the ranch house at full speed. In a panic, Mary Brown ran into the house, called for her servants—an African American woman and boy. She then “put buckets of water where they would be handy in case of fire, [and] she armed the terrified blacks, and led them into the second story of the ranch-house, there to make their last stand.”40 The Comanches approached the ranch house and shot arrows into the windows, all the while whooping at the top of their lungs. In the commotion, with a rifle steadily aimed at the Comanches, Mary Brown noticed that several of the Comanches’ horses were her own. She also heard the horse-bell that had lured her husband to his death. The Comanches circled the ranch house a few times and then rode away, disappearing over the horizon. As a child, Robert would hear this and other firsthand accounts from pioneers who settled the area as early as the 1850s. And while Robert sympathized with the Native Americans’ plight, the infringement upon their hunting lands and their way of life, he also had a passion for the pioneers, albeit a romanticized view of their bravery, struggles, and freedom. This sympathy for the Native Americans and romanticism about pioneer freedom would be sustained by Robert for the rest of his life, finding expression in stories such as “Beyond the Black River.” After two years in Oran, Dr. Howard decided that it was time to move. On October 18, 1912, he filed the last birth certificate for a birth he attended in Palo Pinto County. Two months later, his medical creden-\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 25\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\n« 26 » Renegades and Rogues\n\ntials were filed in Clay County with a post office address in Byers, Texas. Chances are that the family moved to Byers because of an oil boom in Clay County and several surrounding counties. Byers, Texas, is almost within walking distance of the Texas and Oklahoma state line. It sits next to the Wichita River, which flows into the Red River separating Texas and Oklahoma. When Dr. Howard filed his medical credentials on December 19, 1912, in Clay County, Robert was nearing his seventh birthday. Several booms had occurred in and around the Clay County area. Almost ten years prior to the Howards’ arrival in the area, the Wichita Falls and Oklahoma Railway connecting the city of Wichita Falls with Byers was completed. The area was also well known for cattle breeding, grazing, and marketing. Cotton crops were abundant, and Byers touted several cotton gins. With the aid of the railway, cotton dealers could easily sell and transport their cotton out of the area. There were almost six hundred people in Byers when the Howards arrived. The town had one bank, a weekly newspaper, a variety of shops, and even several furniture dealers. Additionally, Byers was “near the old North Texas oil-fields.”41 These oil fields lay beneath a small network of Texas towns in Wichita County (adjacent to Clay County) that included Electra, Old Burkburnett, Burkburnett Townsite, and Northwest Extension. In 1912, when the Howards lived in Clay County, these towns had recently struck oil and tens of thousands of people were moving to Wichita Falls and the surrounding area. Even though no record of medical registry for Dr. Howard exists in Wichita County, Byers was close enough that he could have practiced medicine in both Clay and Wichita Counties. And yet, despite the railroad, cattle, cotton, and oil booms in this area, after four months the Howards moved again. There was nothing remarkable about Bagwell, Texas, when the Howards arrived there in April 1913. The town was just under twenty miles from the Oklahoma border, and slightly less than one hundred miles from the Arkansas border. Originally settled by a blacksmith named Milas Bagwell, Bagwell was a crossroads for several small nearby towns. Not only did Bagwell use his blacksmith skills to help others in the area, but he also established a tannery for the local hunters. When the T&P Railroad built tracks through the county around 1876, farmers began to colonize the area to grow cotton and grain crops, and now the town needed a cotton gin and a gristmill. By 1914, the town population had surged to around three hundred. It had a district school, a church, and a sawmill.\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 26\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\nFrom Birth to Bagwell\n\n« 27 »\n\nWith the T&P Railway transporting lumber and cotton out of the area, Bagwell had a steady stream of income and soon established two banks. It is believed that Dr. Howard moved his family to Bagwell at the request of a Dr. Stephens, a friend from Gate City Medical College in Texarkana, though which friend is unclear: There were two doctors named “Stephens” in Bagwell, Dr. Willis Commodore Stephens and his son, Willis Walter Stephens. And it turns out both had attended the Gate City Medical College in Texarkana during the years that Isaac Howard was studying there—the younger Stephens graduated in 1904, Howard in 1905, and the elder Stephens in 1906.42\n\nIt is not known which Stephens invited Dr. Howard to the area. Even so, he registered his medical license at the Red River County courthouse on April 30, 1913, and the Howards established residency in Bagwell. Even though the Howards’ time in Bagwell was relatively short—a little over a year and a half—it would have a profound impact on seven-year-old Robert, who began his formal education there. The town’s population included a number of former slaves whose history, culture, and stories provided lively material for Robert in his writing career. This part of Texas has a rich pioneer history that begins in the early 1800s, when “the first Anglo-Saxon settlement in Texas was begun in 1814 in Red River County on what is now the western border of Bowie and the east border of Red River County.”43 Shortly thereafter, in 1833, James Clark settled the area and created a township. Through an act of the Texas Congress in 1837, Clarksville was incorporated and quickly became an agricultural and, eventually, educational center for the surrounding areas. Bagwell was later established eight miles northeast of Clarksville in the middle of what is known as the piney woods in Red River County. With agriculture being the primary source of trade and income in those pioneer days, slaves migrated with their owners to the area. When slavery ended, the African American population typically remained where they were living and continued to work on the farms and plantations. As a result, during the time the Howards lived there, Red River County had a diverse population. In Robert’s formative years, Bagwell was the first place where he experienced African Americans and their culture. The seven-year-old was entertained with an assortment of stories about ghosts, voodoo, and black magic by a former slave named “Aunt” Mary Bohannon. As\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 27\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\n« 28 »\n\nRenegades and Rogues\n\nan adult, Robert detailed these experiences in his correspondence with Lovecraft. “As regards African-legend sources, I well remember the tales I listened to and shivered at, when a child in the ‘piney woods’ of East Texas, where Red River marks the Arkansaw and Texas boundaries.”44 Born into slavery in Kentucky,45 Mary Bohannon was “brought to Texas sometime between 1850 and 1860, along with nine other slaves, by Henry C. Bohannon,46 who left his farm in Breathett [sic] County, Kentucky and relocated to a farm east of Clarksville.” Not too long after settling in Red River County, on March 31, 1861, Bohannon’s wife, Pauline Bohannon, died. She was forty-one. Just a few short years later, Henry C. Bohannon died as well, on July 14, 1863. This left their two children, daughter Mary F. and son Logan, with the slaves and land. “Upon his father’s death, Logan, then aged 18, accepted $1700.00 as his part of the estate and returned to Breathett [sic] County, Kentucky: he apparently never returned to Texas.”47 While the Civil War escalated and would soon be the central event in America’s consciousness, Mary F. Bohannon married William J. Swain, on December 24, 1861. William Swain thus became the executor of the Bohannon estate, retaining the land and the slaves. When the Civil War ended on May 9, 1865, and slavery in the United States was abolished in December of that same year, “Aunt” Mary Bohannon and her husband Wyatt (both were among the Bohannon slaves from Kentucky) were freed, but they continued to stay with the Swains and kept the Bohannon name. No record of marriage exists for Mary and Wyatt in Red River County. It is possible that they may have already been married when they moved from Kentucky to Texas with the Bohannons. By 1895, Wyatt seems to no longer be listed in the various federal censuses and county land deeds. However, in the details of an 1895 deed of land just north of the T&P Railroad in Bagwell from William J. Swain to Mary and Wyatt, Wyatt’s death is confirmed: “Wyatt Bohannon is dead and the said Mary Bohannon is still living and now resides on the said fift y acres.”48 After selling fift y acres of their land in Bagwell to Wyatt and Mary in 1895, the Swains had moved to Austin. Mary lived there until she sold it in 1907. When the Howards settled in Bagwell around 1913, “Aunt” Mary Bohannon lived with Joe and Lottie Dennis.49 Mary’s occupation was left off the 1910 federal census. However, a local historian writes that “Mary Bohannon cooked for the affluent white folks in Bagwell in the early 1900s.”50 It is unknown whether she helped the Howards with cooking and such. She may have on occasion. Based on Robert’s written account,\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 28\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\nFrom Birth to Bagwell\n\n« 29 »\n\nshe was acquainted enough with the Howards for young Robert to sit at her feet and listen to tales of her former life as a slave. Robert describes these stories in a letter: Old Aunt Mary had had the misfortune, in her youth, to belong to a man whose wife was a fiend from Hell. The young slave women were fine young animals, and barbarically handsome; her mistress was frenziedly jealous. You understand. Aunt Mary told tales of torture and unmistakable sadism that sickens me to this day when I think of them. Thank God the slaves on my ancestors’ plantation were never so misused. And Aunt Mary told how one day, when the black people were in the fields, a hot wind swept over them and they knew that “ol’ Misses Bohannon” was dead. Returning to the manor house they found that it was so and the slaves danced and shouted with joy. Aunt Mary said that when a good spirit passes, a breath of cool air follows, but when an evil spirit goes by a blast from the open doors of Hell follows it.51\n\nThe “fiend from hell” was Pauline Bohannon, the wife of Henry C. Bohannon. Apparently, Mrs. Bohannon was cruel to her slaves, and Robert got an earful about this as a child. Robert described Mary Bohannon as light-complected and attractive. Jealousy may have been the reason for Pauline Bohannon’s ill behavior toward Mary. In the same letter, Robert recalled several of Mary Bohannon’s other stories: She told many tales, one which particularly made my hair rise; it occurred in her youth. A young girl going to the river for water, met, in the dimness of dusk, an old man, long dead, who carried his severed head in one hand. This, said Aunt Mary, occurred on the plantation of her master, and she herself saw the girl come screaming through the dusk, to be whipped for throwing away the water-buckets in her flight.52\n\nThis tale would certainly make the hair rise on any eight-year-old. Such tales were imprinted on young Robert’s mind, and he would later use them as sources for several of his horror stories. Robert’s most famous horror story, “Pigeons from Hell,” was directly inspired by Mary Bohannon: Another tale she told that I have often met with in negro-lore. The setting, time and circumstances are changed by telling, but the tale re-\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 29\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\n« 30 » Renegades and Rogues\n\nmains basically the same. Two or three men—usually negroes—are travelling in a wagon through some isolated district—usually a broad, deserted river-bottom. They come on to the ruins of a once thriving plantation at dusk, and decide to spend the night in the deserted plantation house. This house is always huge, brooding and forbidding, and always as the men approach the high columned verandah, through the high weeds that surround the house, great numbers of pigeons rise from their roosting places on the railing and fly away. The men sleep in the big front room with its crumbling fireplace, and in the night they are awakened by a jangling of chains, weird noises and groans from upstairs. Sometimes footsteps descend the stairs with no visible cause. Then a terrible apparition appears to the men who flee in terror.53\n\nThough Robert changed some of the details in the story and added elements that made the tale more grueling and suspenseful, the gist of the story is still the same in his version of it. Stephen King declares that Robert E. Howard’s “Pigeons from Hell” is “one of the finest horror stories of our century.”54 For that, Robert has Mary Bohannon to thank. Mary Bohannon died on February 23, 1921, years after the Howards had moved away from Bagwell. She is buried in an unmarked grave on James Miller’s land just off County Road 2111, about two miles northeast of Bagwell in what is now known as the Bagwell Cemetery.55 Her influential tales, along with the piney woods area, can certainly be seen in several of Robert’s other stories, such as “The House of Suspicion” and “Black Canaan,” and they echo in some elements of “Kelly the Conjure Man” and his stories featuring Solomon Kane. Howard scholar Rusty Burke believes that they also make an appearance “in such early efforts as ‘The Hyena’ and ‘The Hand of Obeah.’”56 A Red River County historian also recognized the influence of Mary Bohannon on Robert: Mary was a story-teller, well versed in the legend and lore of her African heritage. She could not pass that lore to her own decedents since she seems to have had none who survived her. But she could and did implant those legends into the mind of an impressionable Robert Howard who, in turn, is said to have called upon them from time to time while creating his own unique form of literature.57\n\n“Aunt” Mary was not the only African American in Bagwell to make an indelible impression upon young Robert. He also recalled a laundress named Arabella Davis, whom he described as “going placidly about town\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 30\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\nFrom Birth to Bagwell\n\n« 31 »\n\ncollecting washing.” Robert claimed that Davis was a “black philosopher, if there was ever one.” He remembered that she had a granddaughter who shadowed her wherever she went, carrying Davis’s “pipe, matches and tobacco with as much pomposity as a courtier ever carried the train of a queen.”58 On several occasions when Arabella Davis stopped to talk with Robert, she told him a few stories about her former slave life and her conversion to Christianity. Robert, most impressed with Davis’s conversion story, conveyed it to Lovecraft: She often told of her conversion, when the spirit of the Lord was so strong upon her that she went for ten days and nights without eating or sleeping. She went into a trance, she said, and for days the fiends of Hell pursued her through the black mountains and the red mountains. For four days she hung in the cobwebs on the gates of Hell, and the hounds of Hell bayed at her. Is that not a splendid sweep of imagination? And the strangest part is, it was so true and realistic to her, that she would have been amazed had anyone questioned her veracity.59\n\nNot much else is known about Arabella Davis, other than Robert’s account of her. Aside from his encounters with former slaves in Bagwell, it was there that Robert would also begin his education. He was seven when the Howards moved to Bagwell, and “free tuition for Texas schools did not begin until age eight.”60 Even so, it is highly likely that Robert’s parents, especially his mother, would have ensured that by the time he entered first grade he could already read and write. A converted house with Victorian trim and a large L-shaped porch was used for the schoolhouse, which employed at least three teachers, two females and one male. The rooms in the house were classrooms designated for specific age ranges. Robert gave no account of the school in Bagwell, nor of any specific teachers or friends he may have had, except for one encounter involving a boy who was a playmate and an old woman whom the town considered to be a witch. Robert did not name either the playmate or the old woman, but he did explain that the old woman typically wandered around town, followed by several geese, and collected manure to fertilize her garden. Robert provides no details as to what his playmate did or said to this woman, but something occurred because she cursed him. Robert claimed that a few weeks after the woman cursed his friend, he died.61 By January 1915, the Howards had packed up and left Bagwell. Bag-\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 31\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\n« 32 »\n\nRenegades and Rogues\n\nwell, however, never left Robert. He took his experiences of the town, its people, and their stories with him. From birth to Bagwell—the first eight years of his life—Robert E. Howard experienced unrestricted freedom, which he would seek for the remainder of his life. Robert was raised and influenced not only by his parents but also by Texas. From one end of the state to the other, he experienced her people: pioneers, settlers, immigrants, small-town folk, and even former slaves. He experienced Texas expansion, various growth booms, Texas history, and a variety of tales. This freedom and these experiences would occupy his mind, fuel his desires, and permeate his writing until his final breath.\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 32\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\nChapter Three\n\nCross Cut and Burkett\n\nRobert and I were very close friends . . . in elementary school. He read a lot and had a great imagination. Austin Newton, letter to L. Spr ague de Camp (circa 1978)\n\nO\n\nn January 25, 1915, Dr. Howard brought his horse to a stop, stepped down from his buggy, and climbed the steps to the Brown County courthouse in Brownwood, Texas. He had arrived to register his medical credentials. At the time, the Howards lived in Putnam, Texas (Callahan County), north of Brown County. In 1915, rumors circulated that the T&P Railway would be laying tracks close to Putnam. As was their custom, the Howards may have moved to Putnam based on these rumors. While in Putnam, Dr. Howard was probably working with or learning from Professor J. H. Surles. Professor Surles ran the “largest drugless sanitarium in North Texas for several years.”1 Surles had recently taken charge of the Milling Sanitarium in Putnam and provided alternative medical therapies to new clients. In those days, a handful of licensed western doctors used alternative methods, many of which were more commonly practiced in the East. Most western professional practitioners considered some of these alternative methods mere hokum, primarily because they thought of them as unscientific. At the time, the Western medical industry was beginning to regulate the practice of medicine and frowned upon some of these methods. However, most alternative methods used in Dr. Howard’s day were biomedical practices that are used more commonly today. Dr. Howard was an advocate of alternative medical practices and often\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 33\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\n« 34 »\n\nRenegades and Rogues\n\nused them. Although it is uncertain how long the Howards were in Putnam, or whether they were there because of Professor Surles, it is certain that they moved from Putnam to Cross Cut sometime around January 29, 1915, which was just a few days after Dr. Howard’s trip to the Brown County courthouse.2 As was customary, Dr. Howard registered his medical license with that county.3 But why Cross Cut? This was perhaps the most unusual move the Howards made in those early years. In 1915, Cross Cut was tiny, and the area would not experience its first oil boom for another five years. Dr. Solomon Chambers, the family doctor in Cross Cut, was a good friend of Dr. Howard’s. Dr. Chambers very likely urged him to move to Cross Cut, since he provided services within a fifteen-mile radius and was probably overwhelmed and in dire need of help.4 If the rumors about the T&P Railway were true and Dr. Howard was in fact learning new methods from Professor Surles in Putnam, settling in Cross Cut also kept the Howards in close proximity to new opportunities in the area. Nine-year-old Robert was still in school when the Howards arrived in Cross Cut. At the time, the town had a small school building with three teachers who taught various grades, and Robert was soon enrolled. Eventually he met Austin Newton, a kid his age, and the two became good friends. The Newton and Howard families also became close friends while they all lived in Cross Cut. In fact, Dr. Howard was the attending physician at the birth of Austin’s younger brother, Howard, who was named for the doctor. On June 11, 1915,5 the Howards rented the Pentecost house from an E. DeBusk, who, according to land deeds, had bought the land and house in May of that same year.6 The R. W. Pentecost family had lived in Cross Cut for approximately thirty years but decided to move to southern Arizona.7 Their house (which is no longer standing) was a two-story farmhouse with several one-story rooms added onto the back. It sat about one hundred yards north of the Cross Cut cemetery. As the Howards settled into a daily routine in Cross Cut, they became more involved in the community. The tiny town had two churches: Methodist Episcopal (ME) and Baptist. The Howards may have attended both but spent more time at the ME church. And yet, during at least one evening service, Dr. Howard preached at the Baptist church.8 Religious studies had always been an interest of Dr. Howard’s, and at one time he had seriously considered preaching as an occupation. Dr. and Mrs. Howard were quite involved with their church. On one Saturday evening, “Dr. Howard gave the young folks a party” at their home. It was\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 34\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\nCross Cut and Burk ett\n\n« 35 »\n\nreported that “all present [had] a nice time.”9 More than likely, this was a gathering for the youth from their ME church. On a different evening, “the ladies of the ME Church entertained at the home of Dr. Howard.”10 This event was hosted by Mrs. Howard for her ladies’ church group, most likely because the size of their house made it easier to host social gatherings there. Mrs. Howard enjoyed these social activities. During this period, the Howards were known to invite several friends and other families to their home. On numerous occasions, Dr. Solomon Chambers traveled with Dr. Howard and regularly visited the Howard home with his family in tow. Mrs. Howard would prepare a tasty meal, and the Howards would entertain. Another of Mrs. Howard’s close friends in Cross Cut, Zettie Newton, made frequent visits, bringing her son Austin. Austin and Robert were inseparable. With Robert sporting a Bowie knife that his father carried and Austin packing a Civil War cap-andball pistol that belonged to his uncle, the boys would roam the countryside, engaged in high adventure for hours on end. On occasion they would play at the creek and get muddy catching fish. As an adult, Austin Newton proclaimed that young Robert was a voracious reader and had a wonderful imagination. The two boys would spend some of their time acting out adventure stories that Robert concocted. They also played cops-and-robbers or cowboys-and-Indians with several of the other local boys.11 At some point between living in Bagwell and moving to Cross Cut, Robert had developed a strong interest in boxing. It is uncertain how he acquired this interest—perhaps from boxing bouts he heard on the radio or boxing magazines he discovered in a drugstore. Whatever kindled his interest in boxing, by the time the Howards lived in Cross Cut, Robert had a profound passion for the sport. Austin Newton confirmed this when he revealed that when he first met the Howards, Robert was already studying the sport and its fighters. Austin and Robert sparred at times, both with and without gloves. One afternoon the two were bare-knuckle sparring. In an opportune moment, Robert managed to land a strong left jab to Austin’s Adam’s apple, sending the boy to the ground. That blow “ended the sparring for that day. But sparring continued to be one of our main past times,” Newton recalled later.12 Boxing would be critical for Robert as a young adult attempting to break into a variety of writing markets. His knowledge of the sport enabled him to create memorable boxing stories and detailed fight scenes that leapt off the page. Besides giving his stories an unprecedented energy, his interest in boxing also helped feed his passion for reading. Whenever Robert de-\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 35\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\n« 36 » Renegades and Rogues\n\nveloped an interest in a subject, he typically sought numerous books or articles about it, and as a result he acquired a substantial book collection over the years. Books were scarce in Cross Cut and the surrounding area, but the Howards managed to find them. Robert’s passion for books and stories stemmed from his mother’s practice of reading fiction and poetry to him in his formative years. However, in small Texas farming towns, a boy who spent most of his time reading often drew suspicious glares. Most nine- or ten-year-old boys were busy with their chores and learning skills that would enable them to eventually take over their family’s farm. Robert was the child of a medical doctor without a farm or land to work, so he spent much of his time with his nose in a book, feeding his imagination, a habit that earned him a reputation and set him apart from the other boys. While young Robert was not an outcast, he was viewed as different or odd. Regardless, Dr. and Mrs. Howard continued to buy him books, and Mrs. Howard encouraged her son’s imagination. The attitude of the locals, both young and old, toward his intellectual passions and activities may have caused a gradual change in Robert’s behavior toward the people around him. He did not dislike people—indeed, he would carry on conversations with complete strangers—but he became prudent about whom he would let into his immediate circle.13 In the summer months, when Dr. Howard was away making house calls, Mrs. Howard occasionally pulled Robert from his books to play catch in the yard. Other times Austin and Robert would hang out in town at the drugstore. The summer months in Cross Cut also brought in “tent revivals,” an assortment of religious revivals, usually of the Christian fundamentalist variety. These revivals were held so frequently that Cross Cut built an open-air tabernacle, which doubled as a picnic area for the townspeople. The music at these revivals was lively and vigorous, accompanied by exuberant hand-clapping and shouting. Austin Newton recalled: The sermons were always “hellfire and damnation” sermons with a sweating minister, screaming at the top of his voice, interspersed with many “hallalulias” [sic] “amens” and “yea verilles” [sic]. These were evangelical meetings and they were always bringing someone to God. In some groups there were seizures and speaking in tongues, which, of course, meant an unknown tongue. They rolled around on the ground during their estacy [sic]—hence the name “holy roller.”14\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 36\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\nCross Cut and Burk ett\n\n« 37 »\n\nSeveral of these revivals must have left an unforgettable imprint on the mind of young Robert. Coupled with his research on domestic and foreign religious rituals, these ritualistic religious experiences were often incorporated into various stories throughout his writing career. While the Howards lived in Cross Cut, Dr. Howard developed a strong reputation in his profession. He was a consummate extrovert who loved being able to help people. Dr. Howard also loved hearing their stories, but more than that, he loved telling his own stories. Because he was the family doctor for so many people, the community of Cross Cut held him in high regard as their doctor and as a friend. His reputation was far-reaching, as he practiced medicine not only in Cross Cut but also in several surrounding communities, such as Burkett. Throughout this period, the Howards owned two horses and a buggy, and it is reported that Dr. Howard made all his Cross Cut house calls in that buggy.15 During these same years, Dr. Howard studied in medical schools to update his credentials and improve his practice. From late June to early July of 1917, he traveled to New Orleans and attended four weeks of medical laboratory lectures.16 His trips to New Orleans continued until 1921.17 During these trips, Dr. Howard attended both Tulane University and Loyola University for postgraduate courses in advanced medical research. He also obtained an eyes, ears, nose, and throat certification.18 On one of the longer trips, Dr. Howard brought along Mrs. Howard and thirteen-yearold Robert. This trip was extremely beneficial for Robert. Most likely the Howards traveled on the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe (AT&SF) passenger train from Brownwood, Texas, to Lampasas, through Temple to Houston and then on to New Orleans.19 They arrived in New Orleans on March 10, 1919.20 New Orleans was reeling from a series of brutal murders. The New Orleans Times-Picayune reported the capture of an ax-wielding predator who had been breaking into people’s homes and killing his victims. Newsboys loudly proclaimed the man’s capture as they ran up and down the streets of New Orleans selling their papers. These events would linger in young Robert’s mind for years. Sometime between 1925 and 1928,21 he wrote an essay, later titled “In His Own Image,”22 that provided a few details about the “ax-man” of New Orleans: I remember strolling down a narrow street one day when the town was electrified by the shout of the newsboys: “They’ve got the ax-man!” The dirty ragged newsboys came scampering down the streets like\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 37\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\n« 38 »\n\nRenegades and Rogues\n\nwisps of grass blown before the wind. They seemed all animated by an urge of motion for they scudded along screeching at the tops of their voices, scarcely stopping to make sales. And it was momentous news they bore. For months the fear of the menace known as the ax-man had laid over the city like a fog. The morning I arrived in New Orleans, the morning papers were full of the latest atrocity, committed across the river among towns which so crowd the river bank that they are separated only by boundary posts.23\n\nAccording to Robert’s essay, the ax-man had broken into a house and killed an entire family, including a child who was only a few months old. These events were reported in the local New Orleans newspapers and in syndicated newspapers across the country. The family was reported to be Italian immigrants Charles and Rosie Cortimiglia and their two-yearold daughter Mary. In reality, Charles and Rosie survived the attack, but their daughter was killed. A grocer named Lorlando Jordano heard the Cortimiglias screams and ran across the street to investigate. Upon entering their home, Jordano saw Charles on the floor bleeding profusely, while Rosie was on the porch with a serious head wound clutching her dead child. Rosie later falsely testified that Lorlando Jordano and his son Frank were the perpetrators. She admitted two years later that she gave false testimony owing to spite and jealousy.24 In addition to details about the ax-man and his arrest, “In His Own Image” provides minutiae about Robert’s experience of New Orleans and its people. By this time in Robert’s life, he had witnessed new settlements in desolate Texas areas, oil and land booms, and listened to the fi rsthand accounts of Native Americans, pioneers, and former slaves, among a variety of others. And yet New Orleans showed him an entirely different ambiance. In 1919, the city and its people resembled something out of a Dickens novel, including Victorian attire and architecture. Within only a few blocks, Robert could see the dilapidated apartments of the poorest slums alongside upscale restaurants, hotels, and homes. The contrast did not escape him. The Howards stayed “just four blocks from the boundary of Storyville, New Orleans’ notorious red-light district. And while the prostitution that was Storyville’s raison d’être had been officially shut down in the fall of 1917, by no means had the district been shuttered.”25 If young Robert took the opportunity to roam in that direction, he would have seen “dance halls, cabarets, and restaurants which plied their trades le-\n\nVick_7008-final.indb 38\n\n9/28/20 12:27 PM\n\nCross Cut and Burk ett\n\n« 39 »\n\ngally.”26 And despite the fact that New Orleans was one of the first southern cities to enforce the Volstead Act, which established rules for various types of prohibited beverages,27 Storyville continued operating its saloons and gambling halls. When the laws of prohibition were officially enforced against those establishments, New Orleans responded with speakeasies. In New Orleans, the Howards rented rooms in a boardinghouse at 1904 Canal Street. It was owned by three sisters named Camille, Delphine, and Marie Durel. Robert described them as “gentlewomen of the old school, living in semi-seclusion and striving to maintain the standards of a faded aristocracy, and reconcile their natures with the necessity which forced them to run a rooming house.”28 It has been suggested that these three ladies “served as the inspiration for the Blassenville sisters” in Howard’s horror story “Pigeons from Hell.”29 One of the sisters (perhaps Camille, because census records indicate that she was the owner of a "
