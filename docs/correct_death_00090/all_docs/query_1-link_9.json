        "text": "by Gary Romeo\n\nLet’s start with an excerpt from Wikipedia about Fate magazine:\n\nFate is a U.S. magazine about paranormal phenomena. Fate was co-founded in 1948 by Raymond A. Palmer (editor of Amazing Stories) and Curtis Fuller. Fate magazine is the longest-running magazine devoted to the paranormal. Promoted as “the world’s leading magazine of the paranormal”, it has published expert opinions and personal experiences relating to UFOs, psychic abilities, ghosts and hauntings, cryptozoology, alternative medicine, divination methods, belief in the survival of personality after death, Fortean phenomena, predictive dreams, mental telepathy, archaeology, warnings of death, and other paranormal topics.\n\nGiven that description some might find it surprising that L. Sprague de Camp wrote several articles for this magazine.\n\nDe Camp’s first appearance in Fate was the inspiration for that issue’s cover illustration (albeit without the author’s name). The July 1953 issue featured his article, “Has Atlantis Been Found?”\n\nThe most likely candidate per de Camp is off the coast of Spain rather than under the ocean. “The likeliest of these is the mysterious city of Tartessos or Tarshish which stood about 20 miles northwest of Cadiz along the coast of southwestern Spain.”\n\nDe Camp tells the story of Phoenician sailors bringing back tales of Tartessos’ wealth. Later other countries elaborated on these stories and as sailing techniques improved there were other visits to this wealthy land. Eventually the city disappeared probably due to silting estuaries turning the place into a “malarial marsh.”\n\nWhen Plato began talking of Atlantis in The Republic, he was retelling the stories and myths about Tartessos. De Camp goes on to give further history and it all makes for a great historical article.\n\nFor the October 1956 issue de Camp’s article “The Mysterious Kaballah” received top billing.\n\nDe Camp defines what the Kaballah is right away. “The Kabbalah is the school of magical Jewish philosophy and also the group of books in which this philosophy is set forth.”\n\nDe Camp opines the all religion has some magic and gives examples for Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. “Hebrew magic differed from Christian magic in one curious way. Judaism tended to tolerate sorcery…” De Camp goes on to give a history of Kabbalah.\n\nThe article sums up: “… in occult matters, Hebrews can be just as foolish as other men. This is not exactly how most people set out to prove the brotherhood of man – but it is proof of a sort.”\n\nDe Camp’s article was once again the inspiration for the cover for the January 1957 issue. “Nan-matol: Lost City of the Pacific” was tailor made for a somewhat sexy cover.\n\n“Of all the world’s lost cities … none is wrapped in deeper mystery than Nan-matol on the island of Ponape in the Pacific Ocean. Yet even at Nan-matol, science has solved some of the enigmas that shroud this ruined metropolis.”\n\nDe Camp goes on to give a history of explorers visiting the island. The mystery of Nan-matol are fantastic ruins that are out of sync with the natives architecture.\n\nDe Camp is critical of explorers and missionaries, who forced their ways on the natives and gives some damning examples quoting a missionary, “Better that they should die and be saved than live and be damned.”\n\nThe conclusion is that the ruins were the work of a people called the Kusaeans who instituted a work project to build a religious center rather than a city. The ruins at Nan-matol are magnificent because of a natural prismatic basalt deposit to provide material.\n\n“The International Cotton Mystery” failed to make the July 1958 cover.\n\nThe world distribution of cotton is a real mystery according to de Camp. De Camp breaks down the various types of cotton and gives a history of its first use by civilization.\n\nThe mystery is “New World” cotton. New World cotton has twice the chromosomes in each body-cell. De Camp traces Indian cotton to Peru (where it hybridized with native cottons) to become the double chromosome cotton.\n\nThis article was perhaps too technical to make the cover. It is interesting but probably of more interest to a botanist than the average reader.\n\n“How the Pyramids Were Built” for December 1962 received second billing on the cover.\n\n“The most famous monuments in the entire world are the pyramids of Egypt. Of these, the most celebrated is the Great Pyramid of King Khufu…”\n\nDe Camp goes on to discuss pyramid mythology and gives technical details about the structures. De Camp states that “As engineering achievements, the pyramids are wonderful enough without bedecking them with whimseys.”\n\nThe last half of the articles goes into the details of how they were built. They were not built by slaves but mostly by peasant labor who were idle during the annual flood of the Nile. Egyptian tombs do show foremen carrying rods to whack the occasional laggerd but constant lashing would not have happened.\n\nThe September 1972 issue prominently featured “The “Wicked” City of Babylon” as the top article for this issue.\n\nThe “wicked” was certainly meant as an enticement but it fails to deliver. De Camp dismisses it in the first paragraph.\n\n“People think of Babylon as very large, very wicked and very colorful – but this impression is not quite right. Babylon was certainly large but no larger than several other great cities of the ancient world, no larger than Memphis, Athens, or Syracuse.”\n\nLater, “[Babylon] was no more sinful than other great cities.” According to de Camp, it was bad publicity from the Hebrews. Almost proving the point there is no such thing as bad publicity.\n\nThe article continues on in an interesting travelogue kind of way. De Camp used the same style (and probably this same article) in his “Great Cities of the Ancient World” book.\n\nMay 1974 had de Camp’s “The Glory That Was Athens” listed at the top of the articles list on the front cover but Fey C. Oliver’s “Harold Plume and His Team of Spirit Doctors” was the main feature.\n\nThis is another travelogue type article used in “Great Cities of the Ancient World.”\n\n“The history of most ancient cities – Athens among them – begins in a fog of myth and legend. Athenians believed that their city, named for her patron goddess Athena, and its surrounding province Attica had been unified by the hero Theseus, probably a mythical character as his contemporary, Hercules. When its history finally begins in the Seventh Century B. C. Attica already was united, probably by force rather than persuasion, as the legends relate.”\n\nThe article continues in this vein giving a detailed history in capsulized form.\n\nMarch 1978 was de Camp’s last appearance with “The Sinister Splendor of Carthage.”\n\nThe last of de Camp’s “Great Cities” pieces is another interesting historical overview.\n\n“According to tradition, Carthage was founded in 814 B. C. – 61 years before Rome – by Pygmalion of Tyre. But according to legend it was his sister, the Princess Elissa, who arrived at the site that year. Archaeology supports the date of 814 B. C. and it is quite possible the Princess Elissa had something to do with it, for the Carthaginians took her as their tutelar deity.”\n\n#\n\nFate skillfully placed materialist work along with magical thinking to create a magazine that could appeal to a variety of readers. I enjoy both types of articles and I am sure plenty of others did as well. If friends embarrassed you for reading the metaphysical articles you could point to the historical ones for balance.\n\nDe Camp was rock-solid in always promoting science and the scientific method. However de Camp did not seem out of place in Fate magazine even though his articles appeared in the Table of Contents with articles like, “Telepathy in Pets” and “I Practiced Black Magic.” There was enough variety to make it all work.\n\nDe Camp’s articles convinced me that aliens did not visit ancient civilizations. But I still think there is something to that “Telepathy in Pets” article.\n\nBONUS:\n\nA letter from the editor praising one of de Camp’s articles!"
