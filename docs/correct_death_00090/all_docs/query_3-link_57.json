        "text": "The Magical Misadventures of Harold Shea.\n\nThe humoristic fantasy novellas by American authors L. Sprague de Camp & Fletcher Pratt arose in a time in the 1940s from the well of inspiration that is old mythology. Being unfamiliar with Robert E. Howard’s Conan stories, and Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings not yet having been written, De Camp and Pratt instead looked to Norse mythology and Icelandic sagas, to Arthurian tales and old epic poems like The Faerie Queene and Orlando Furioso. With that source material in hand, they wanted to write something lighthearted and entertaining. Later, Poul Anderson would take inspiration from similar sources when writing The Broken Sword (1954) and Three Hearts and Three Lions (1953), but De Camp & Pratt were there earlier.\n\nDe Camp and Pratt brought a scientific sensibility to their fantasy stories that makes them something unique. The main character, Harold Shea, is a psychologist living in modern times, and together with his fellow researchers at their institute they write down a mathematical formula that states that when you adjust your sensory impressions of the world to that of another world with its own magic system, then you will be bodily transported to that world. Shea’s adventures therefore consist of him studying the magic systems of known bodies of mythology. Greek and Celtic myths, for instance. And then transporting to and surviving in those systems. Shea is seen as a wizard in the fantasy worlds he visits, but it is by employing reasoning and observation that he tries to survive. (Pratt stated that he disliked Howard’s Conan stories when he read them later on, because Conan only uses his mighty thews to hack his way out of trouble, instead of using his mind.)\n\nIn the first novella, The Roaring Trumpet (1940), things go wrong immediately. Shea aims to transport himself to the world of Arthurian myth, but miscalculates and ends up with the Norse gods right before Ragnarok. It is a world he is not familiar with and has to learn on the fly what is going on. Shea has a really rough time of it with the burly Norse gods. He finds out that the book that he brought with him changed from English to Runic, and his thoughts too, because all of that had to change to fit into the magic reality of this world. Chapters end with Shea lying in bed and puzzling like a university researcher over everything that is happing. One could almost call it science fiction.\n\nThe stories are mildly entertaining. The characters are a bit simple and the plots too, although it is interesting how De Camp and Pratt treat the original myths in their fantasy adventures if you are familiar with the source material. The second novella was my favourite, The Mathematics of Magic (1940), because it was the funniest. Shea’s older colleague Chalmers joins him as they travel to the fake medieval world of Edmund Spenser’s The Faerie Queene. Shea has to deal with easily offended knights and ladies who fiercely protect their chastity, while Chalmers tries to invent magic spells through a scientific approach. Shea tries to conjure a unicorn but ends up with a rhinoceros which he rides with a yeehaw into a bunch of druids. They both try to join a guild of sorcerers who hold conferences like university professors, and so the story treats magic as science and science as magic.\n\nOne gets the impression that De Camp and Pratt had a great time writing these, but I wouldn’t consider them essential reads from the genre’s history. The scientific magic system approach is clearly prescient and unique for the time, but the stories zigzag every which way and the characters are simple and old-fashioned. The third story, The Castle of Iron (1941) is especially convoluted, adding far too many characters and plot points before arriving anywhere. The humor wears thin quickly when a cocky, obnoxious student joins Shea on an accidental trip to Muslim Spain. All the faux-Medieval speech patterns start to become tiresome as well."
