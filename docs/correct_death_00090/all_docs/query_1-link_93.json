After one publisher who had contracted for it failed, it was published serially in the magazine Other Worlds Science Fiction in 1952-53 and then published (with revisions) as a clothbound book by Gnome Press (New York) in 1954.\n\nFor the present edition, I have corrected a number of minor factual and typographical errors and have interpolated a few new paragraphs to bring the work up to date. The main additions are the discussions of the revival and triumph of Wegener’s theory of continental drift (p. 162), the researches bearing on the eruption of the island of Thera (p. 204ff), and the Atlantean novels of Jane Gaskell (p. 274ff). Some of the end matter (notes and one appendix) has been deleted.\n\nI acknowledge with thanks the permission of Mr. Conrad Aiken to quote from his poems Priapus and the Pool and Senlin; that of the Macmillan Company to quote from John Masefield’s Fragments; that of the J.

SPRAGUE DE CAMP\n\n1970\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE STORY OF ATLANTIS\n\nThere was an island in the sea\n\nThat out of immortal chaos reared\n\nTowers of topaz, trees of pearl\n\nFor maidens adored and warriors feared.\n\nLong ago it sunk in the sea;\n\nAnd now, a thousand fathoms deep,\n\nSea-worms above it whirl their lamps,\n\nCrabs on the pale mosaic creep.¹\n\nAiken\n\nMEN have always longed for a land of beauty and plenty, where peace and justice reigned. Failing to make one in the real world, they have often sought consolation by creating imaginary Edens, Utopias, and Golden Ages. Formerly they located these ideal commonwealths in the distant past or in undiscovered parts of the world. Now, however, that the unexplored places left on earth are few and uninviting, and the history of the remote past is fairly well known, they prefer to place their utopias in the distant future or even on other planets.\n\nMany such dreams have been written up, and to lend extra interest to their stories the writers have sometimes pretended that their tales were literally true. This practice has had the unfortunate effect of convincing some readers (who have enough trouble distinguishing fact from fiction anyway) that such indeed was the case. For instance, when the noted sixteenth-century idealist Sir Thomas More published his famous Utopia—a story about an imaginary island where people led lives of simple virtue—the conscientious More was much disconcerted when one of his pious contemporaries, the learned Budé, wrote him urging that missionaries be sent to convert the Utopians to Christianity! And when G. B. McCutcheon wrote his Graustark novels, he was deluged with fan mail asking how to get to Graustark, or taking exception to the author’s statements about his imaginary Balkan kingdom. None of his correspondents, evidently, thought to look at a map.\n\nOf all these creators of imaginary worlds, the one with the widest and most lasting influence was the Greek philosopher Aristokles the son of Ariston, better known by his nickname of Plato, the inventor or historian of Atlantis. Although his Atlantis story made but little stir at the time he wrote it, it became so popular in later centuries that to this day the name Atlantis evokes a picture of a beautiful world with a high and colorful culture (now, alas, gone forever) in the minds of thousands of people who never heard of Plato.\n\nNearly two thousand books and articles have been written about Atlantis and other hypothetical continents, ranging in tone from the soberest science to the wildest fantasy. Explorers have travelled thousands of miles looking for traces of the Atlantean culture described by Plato, and geologists have devoted thousands of hours to study of the earth’s crust to find out whether continents do rise and sink, and if so when and why. And many plain men to whom it is no great matter whether\n\n. . . a strange city lying alone\n\nFar down within the dim West\n\never sank beneath the dragon-green, the luminous, the dark, the serpent-haunted sea have turned their attention to Atlantis.\n\nRecently a group of English newspapermen voted the reëmergence of Atlantis as the fourth most important news story they could imagine—five places ahead of the Second Coming of Christ. Astronomers have bestowed the name Atlantis (along with many others from Classical mythology) upon an area on the planet Mars. The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution calls the little ship it explores with the Atlantis, and the name has served as a title for several periodicals, a theatrical company, a hotel in Miami, and several establishments (a book shop, an engineering firm, and a restaurant) in London. Finally, in 1951 the Minsky’s Burlesque show at the Rialto Theatre in Chicago included an aquatic strip-act called Atlantis, The Sea-Nymph. Evidently the Atlantis theme has a grip upon the fancy all out of proportion to its practical importance—though I wouldn’t say it were entirely trivial, since the question of Atlantis does enter into the general problem of the origins of man and of civilization.\n\nPerhaps the very impracticality of Atlantism constitutes part of its charm. It is a form of escapism that lets people play with eras and continents as a child plays with blocks.\n\nAs many people have heard vaguely of the lost-continent theories, and as many seem interested in them without ever having looked into the historical and scientific sides of the question, I will try to tell the story of the Atlantis concept and its progeny such as Mu and Lemuria. Where did the Atlantis story originate? Is the tale fact, fiction, or fiction founded on fact? What is there to the various lost-continent theories? Did Atlantis or Lemuria ever exist? If not, what then is this curious hold that the idea of lost continents has upon the minds of men? I can’t t guarantee final answers to all these questions, but that is the chance you take.\n\nFirst, to consider the story of Atlantis in its earliest known form: About the year 355 B.C. Plato wrote two Socratic dialogues, Timaios and Kritias, wherein he set forth the basic story of Atlantis. At that time Plato was in his seventies and had been through a lot, including enslavement and liberation and an unsuccessful attempt to apply his theories of government at the court of the Tyrant of Syracuse. For many decades he had lectured at Athens, during which time he wrote a number of dialogues: little plays representing his old teacher Socrates and his friends sitting around and discussing such problems as politics, morals, and semantics.\n\nAlthough Socrates is the chief talker in many of these dialogues, we cannot be sure which of the ideas set forth are really those of Socrates and which those of Plato. While we find many of Plato’s ideas unsympathetic today—he sneered at experimental science, glorified male homosexuality, and advocated a type of government that we should call fascistic or technocratic—he pioneered in some departments of human thought. Furthermore he wrote with such poetic charm and vivacity that he seduced many later thinkers into exaggerating his solid contributions to man’s intellectual growth.\n\nSome years previously he had written his best-known dialogue, The Republic, in which he gave his prescription for an ideal state. Now he undertook Timaios as a sequel to The Republic, since the same cast of characters is assembled in the house of Plato’s great-uncle or distant cousin Kritias on the day following the conversation of The Republic.\n\nThe time is about 421 B.C., when in real life Socrates was not yet fifty and Plato a small child; and early in June, during the festival of the Lesser Panathenaia, just after that of the Bendideia. The characters are Socrates, Kritias, Timaios, and Hermokrates. Kritias, Plato’s relative, was a talented historian and poet on one hand, and on the other a scoundrelly politician, a leader of the Thirty Tyrants who inflicted a reign of terror on Athens after that state had been defeated by Sparta in the Peloponnesian War. Timaios (not to be confused with the later historian of the same name) was an astronomer from Locri in Italy, while Hermokrates was an exiled Syracusan general.\n\nTimaios was intended as the first book of a trilogy, in which, first, Timaios lectured on the creation of the world and the nature of man according to the Pythagorean philosophy; second, Kritias told the tale of the war between Atlantis and Athens; and third, Hermokrates was to have spoken on some similar subject—perhaps the military side of the Atheno-Atlantean war after Kritias had finished with the theological and political aspects. It is quite likely that Plato, a thorough militarist, should have had some such discourse in mind. However, the trilogy was never completed. Some time (perhaps years) after finishing Timaios, Plato began a rough draft of Kritias, but dropped the whole project before he had finished this piece and instead wrote his last dialogue, The Laws.\n\nTimaios starts with Socrates and Timaios recalling the discourse of Socrates on the previous day; that is, the dialogue of The Republic. Hermokrates then says that Timaios, Kritias, and he himself are all ready to give speeches on man and the universe, especially Kritias, who has already mentioned to us a story derived from ancient tradition.\n\nPressed for details, Kritias tells how, a century and a half before, the half-legendary Athenian statesman Solon heard the story in Egypt, whither he had withdrawn because of the unpopularity he had incurred by his reform of the Athenian constitution. On his return to Athens he repeated it to his brother Dropides, Kritias’s great-grandfather, who in turn passed it on down to his descendants. Solon had intended to make an epic poem of the narrative, but had never found enough time off from politics to complete the work.\n\nDuring his Egyptian tour Solon stopped off at Saïs, the capital of the friendly King Aahmes. (Here is a discrepancy; Solon is supposed to have made his trip between 593 and 583 B.C., whereas Aahmes II reigned from 570 to 526. But never mind that now.) Here Solon got into a discussion of ancient history with a group of priests of the goddess Neïth or Isis, whom the Greeks identified with their own wise and warlike Athena. When Solon tried to impress them by telling them some of the Greek traditions, like that of Deukalion and Pyrrha and their Flood, the oldest priest (named Sonchis, according to Plutarch) laughed at him. The Greeks were children, he said; they had no ancient history because their records had all been destroyed by the periodical catastrophes of fire and flood that overwhelm the world—all but Egypt, which, being proof against such misfortunes, had kept records from the Creation on down.\n\nThe priest went on to tell Solon that Athena had founded a great Athenian empire 9000 years previously (that is, about 9600 B.C.) divinely organized along the lines that Plato had sketched in his Republic. A communistic military caste had ruled the state, and everybody was brave, handsome, and virtuous.\n\nFig. 2. MAP OF ATLANTIS from Athanasius Kircher’s Mundus Subterraneus (1644). Note that, in contrast to modern maps, north is down and south up.\n\nThere had also been a mighty empire of Atlantis, centering upon an island west of the Pillars of Herakles (the Strait of Gibraltar) larger than North Africa and Asia Minor combined, and surrounded by smaller islands. In those days you could, by traversing this great archipelago island by island, reach the super-continent, beyond Atlantis, which surrounded the ocean that encircled the inhabited world.\n\nThe Atlanteans, not satisfied with ruling their own islands and parts of the outer true continent, had tried to conquer the whole Mediterranean region. They had extended their rule as far as Egypt and Tuscany when they were defeated by the brave Athenians, who led the fight against them and persisted in it even after their allies had fallen away. Then a great earthquake and flood devastated Athens, swallowed the Athenian army, and caused Atlantis to sink between the waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Forever after the waters west of Gibraltar were unnavigable because of the shoals left by the sinking of Atlantis.\n\nKritias then says he lay awake all night trying to remember the details of the story, since it would illustrate the theories that Socrates had propounded the previous day. In fact, he goes on: the city with its citizens which you described to us yesterday, as it were in a fable, we will now transport hither into the realm of fact; for we will assume that the city is that ancient city of yours, and declare that the citizens you conceived are in truth those actual progenitors of ours, of whom the priest told.\n\nSocrates is enthusiastic, especially since the account is no invented fable but genuine history. However, Kritias prefers that Timaios deliver his discourse first. So Timaios takes up the conversation and devotes the rest of this long dialogue to Pythagorean scientific theories: the movements of the Solar System, the shape of the atoms comprising the Four Elements, the creation of mankind, and the working of the human body and soul.\n\nIn the next dialogue, Kritias, Kritias resumes his narration: When the gods divided up the world, Athena and Hephaistos received Athens and set up the Athenian state on suitably Platonic lines. Not only were its workers and farmers incredibly industrious, and its Guardians inhumanly noble, but Greece itself, also, was larger and more fertile in those days. Another of Plato’s inconsistencies is that in Timaios Athens (and, by implication, Atlantis) was founded 9000 years before Solon’s time, while in Kritias it is said that many generations after this founding Atlantis was sunk—also 9000 years before Solon’s time.\n\nMeanwhile Poseidon, the leading sea-god and also the god of earthquakes and horsemanship, had received Atlantis as his share. The population of Atlantis then consisted of a couple who had sprung from the earth, Euenor and Leukippë, and their daughter Kleito. When the old couple died, Poseidon (undeterred by the fact that he was already married to Amphitritë, one of the daughters of the other sea-god Okeanos) set up housekeeping with Kleito on a hill in Atlantis. To keep his sweetheart safe he surrounded the hill with concentric rings of land and water. He also supplied the hill with hot and cold fountains from underground streams. (The Greeks had exaggerated ideas about subterranean watercourses, believing for instance that the Alpheios River in western Greece, the original of Coleridge’s sacred River Alph, ducked under the Adriatic to reappear as the spring Arethusa in Sicily.)\n\nPoseidon, a fertile fellow like all the gods, begat ten sons—five pairs of twins—upon Kleito, and when they grew up divided the land and its adjacent islands among them to rule as a confederacy of kings. The eldest of the first pair, Atlas (after whom Atlantis was named) he made the chief king over all. Atlas’s brother Gadeiros (or to translate it into Greek, Eumelos, rich in sheep or in fruit) received as his portion the region of Gadeira (later Gades or Cadiz) in Spain. Plato says that Solon translated the original Atlantean names into Greek to make them easier for his hearers. Somebody was evidently a poor linguist, since Gadeira is actually from a Phoenician word for hedge.\n\nSince the kings were prolific and the land rich in vegetation, minerals, and elephants, Atlantis in time became a mighty power. The kings and their descendants built the city of Atlantis on the south coast of the continent. The city took the form of a circular metropolis about 15 miles in diameter, with Kleito’s ancient hill in the center. Around this hill the rings of land and water still existed (two of land and three of water) forming a circular citadel three miles in diameter. The kings built bridges connecting the land rings and tunnels big enough for ships connecting the rings of water. The city’s docks were located on the outer margin of the outermost ring. A canal of enormous size ran straight through the city, connecting the harbor works with sea at the south end, and with a great rectangular irrigated plain, 230 by 340 miles in dimensions and surrounded by lofty mountains, at the north end. This plain was divided into square lots which were assigned to the leading farmers, who in turn had to furnish men for the Atlantean army—light and heavy infantry, cavalry, and chariots (thousands of years before cavalry and chariots were invented).\n\nOn the central island the kings erected a royal palace and, over the sacred spot where Poseidon had dwelt with Kleito, a temple surrounded by a golden wall. The rings of land were covered with parks, temples, barracks, racecourses, and other public facilities. These structures were all lavishly decorated with gold, silver, brass, tin, ivory, and the mysterious metal oreichalk n which glowed like fire.\n\nNote that Plato says nothing about the explosives, searchlights, or airplanes with which some imaginative modern Atlantists have credited the Atlanteans. The only ship he mentions is the trireme (or tri r , a type of ship said to have been invented by Ameinokles of Corinth about 700 B.C.) and, except for oreichalk n, he described no technics not known to his own time. While orichalc (literally mountain bronze) has not been identified beyond doubt, Classical writers like Hesiod casually mention it in a way that implies that the term was applied to some unusually good grade of bronze or brass.\n\nThe kings met at alternate intervals of five and six years to consult on matters of state. They assembled in the sacred precincts of Poseidon, captured a bull with a noose, sacrified the animal with much ceremony, and held a banquet. Afterwards they wrapped themselves in dark-blue robes, put out the embers of the sacrificial fire and, sitting about in a circle, spent the rest of the night giving judgments. The following morning these decisions were recorded on tablets of gold for the benefit of posterity.\n\nFor many centuries the Atlanteans were virtuous like the Athenians of that elder day. But in time, as the divine blood they inherited from Poseidon became more and more diluted, they suffered a moral decline. Zeus, the king of the gods, observing their wicked ambition and greed, decided to chastise them that they might do better in the future. (Drowning the lot seems a curious method of reforming them, however.) Therefore he called the gods together in his palace at the center of the Universe to discuss the matter, . . . and when he had assembled them, he spake thus: . . .\n\nHere the dialogue ends in mid-sentence. We never do learn the details of the Atheno-Atlantean war.\n\nNow, what have we here? A myth that Plato made up to illustrate his philosophical ideas? A true tale of the foundering of an ancient continent, handed down via the Egyptian priesthood and Solon in the manner described? Or a real tradition subsequently embroidered by the Egyptians, or Solon, or Dropides, or Plato?\n\nThere are many possibilities. Perhaps the story was told to Solon as described, but contains no truth, having been made up by lying priests to entertain visitors. Again, some writers assert that Plato, as well as Solon, visited Egypt and talked with several priests, including one named Pateneit at Saïs—not impossible, for Plato was noted as a traveller though there is no proof of such a visit in Plato’s writings, and at the time the statement was made it was customary to credit all Greek philosophers with an Egyptian tour whether they had one or not. If Plato did make such a trip, he might have heard the story there, and, when he came to write it up, have introduced it with the tale of Solon and the priest of Neith to lend it a superficial glamor of antiquity.\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that there is no mention by any writer before Plato of any sunken island in the Atlantic, and no evidence outside of Plato’s word that Solon’s unfinished epic ever existed. There is nothing either in the rather scanty remains of pre-Platonic Greek literature; nothing in any of the surviving records of Egypt, Phoenicia, Babylonia, or Sumeria, which go back many centuries before the beginnings of Greek civilization.\n\nFig. 3. THE CITY OF ATLANTIS, as described in Plato’s Kritias.\n\nOf course that does not prove that no such account existed. Only a small fraction of the original Greek literature has come down to us, owing to the ravages of time and neglect, and the bigotry of early Christians like Pope Gregory I who destroyed pagan literature wholesale lest it distract the faithful from the contemplation of heaven. When books were hand-written upon awkward and easily-torn scrolls of brittle papyrus, only exceptional merit or luck enabled a work to survive more than a few centuries. The loss of important Greek works is to some extent made up for by the Greeks’ habit of quoting each other with credit; but still, hundreds of books that would tell us things we should like to know are gone for good.\n\nCertain elements of Plato’s story, even if not the story itself, do appear before Plato’s time.\n\nFor instance, Atlas himself was an old figure of Greek myth: a son of the Titan Iapetos (one of the snake-legged giants who attacked the gods on Olympos) and a brother of Prometheus and Epimetheus. Homer speaks of him as crafty Atlas, who knows the depths of the whole sea, and keeps the tall pillars that hold heaven and earth asunder. Literally the poet says that Atlas has (echei) the pillars, which in Greek might mean possesses, has charge of, or holds up. Later writers, assuming the last meaning to be intended, made the description more definite. Thus the poet Hesiod had Atlas supporting the heavens with his head and arms, and the Greek playwrights added the detail that Atlas was condemned by Zeus for his part in the Titans’ rebellion to perform this wearisome work in the West:\n\nWhere the Hesperides their song\n\nAttune: no mariner can thence prolong\n\nThe voyage, for, his daring bark t’impede\n\nNeptune those hallowed bounds maintains\n\nWhere Atlas with unwearied toil sustains\n\nThe heavens’ incumbent load . . .\n\nLater Classical writers rationalized this myth by making Atlas a scholar-king who founded the science of astronomy, and some Christian theologians identified him with the Biblical Enoch, the son of Cain.\n\nBy Pleionë, another daughter of Okeanos, Atlas had the seven daughters called Atlantides. (The singular, Atlantis, means daughter of Atlas.) These, Alkyonë, Meropë, Kelaino, Elektra, Steropë, Taÿgetë, and Maia, eventually became the stars of the Pleiades. The other sea-god Poseidon begat a son Lykos on Kelaino, and settled this son in the Islands of the Blest, somewhere to the West. Thus in the Classical version of the Atlas myth Poseidon was Atlas’s son-in-law, though being immortal he could no doubt be Atlas’s father (as Plato makes him) at the same time.\n\nIn any case it is pointless to expect consistency from any body of primitive myths. They are always exhuberantly contradictory, even though with the rise of civilization pious scholars try to rationalize them. Furthermore, as a parallel to the Poseidon-Kleito romance, it was said that on the island of Rhodes, which was supposed to have arisen from the depths, Poseidon became enamored of Halia, the sister of the Telchines, and lying with her he begat six male children and one daughter, called Rhodos, after whom the island was named.\n\nSubsequently Herakles, in the course of his Labors, induced Atlas to fetch him the Golden Apples of the Hesperides (also in the West) in return for relieving him of his burden. Returning with the apples, Atlas did not want to resume his task, but Herakles tricked him into doing so by persuading him to support the sky long enough for Herakles to put a pad over his head, and then decamping with the fruit. Finally Perseus turned the poor giant to stone by showing him the Gorgon’s head, and thus Mount Atlas originated.\n\nIt does not follow that all these elements in the Atlas myth are equally old. In fact, there is reason to think that the idea of Atlas’s having charge of the heaven-supporting pillars—a sort of divine building-and-grounds superintendent—existed in Greece centuries before the Greeks had any clear notion of the geography of the Western Mediterranean. Locating him in the West and identifying him with a real mountain were probably afterthoughts.\n\nThe rivalry of Poseidon and Athena, which in Plato takes the form of the Atlanto-Athenian war, also goes back a long way. In the standard body of Greek myth, both Athena and Poseidon claimed Athens. The sea-god asserted his claim by striking the Akropolis with his trident, causing (like Moses) a spring to flow from the spot, while Athena caused an olive-tree to spring up and was adjudged the winner. This divine contention was a common theme of Greek art, and we might say that Plato presented Poseidon with Atlantis as a consolation-prize.\n\nIn addition to the mythological antecedents of Plato’s story, various Classical writers from Herodotos on down describe primitive tribes in northwest Africa, which they call Atlantes, Atarantes, or Atlantioi, all names like that of Atlas.\n\nHowever, since they tell us that these Atlantes have no names and never dream, and that their neighbors include men with snakes for feet (like the Titans) and headless men with faces in their chests, it would seem that the authors were not writing from any first-hand knowledge. Diodoros of Sicily tells a long tale of the North African Amazons (whom he carefully distinguishes from Homer’s Asiatic Amazons) who dwelt on the island Hespera in the marsh Tritonis, and their queen Myrina who conquered the neighboring Atlantioi and the latter’s enemies the Gorgons. According to this voluminous but uncritical first-century historian, the Atlantioi asserted that Atlas, a son of the elder god Ouranos, named both Mount Atlas and themselves after his own name. In later times, they added, Herakles exterminated both the Gorgons and the African Amazons, and the Tritonian Marsh disappeared as a result of an earthquake.\n\nFurthermore, Classical authors often mention islands in the Atlantic Ocean and continents beyond it. Homer began the practice by scattering islands like Aiaia and Ogygia about the seas west of Greece in more or less complete disregard of the actual geography of those parts. Later authors wrote of Atlantic islands, some highly fanciful, inhabited by people with horses’ feet, or satyrs, or folk with ears so large they used them in lieu of clothes. Other such references are plainly to the real Canaries, Madeiras, and (possibly) Azores, generally called the Fortunate Isles. These were known to the Carthaginians, but were subsequently lost until rediscovered by Genoese explorers in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.\n\nThey also believed, as did Plato, that the ocean surrounding the known world of Europe, Asia, and Africa was in turn encircled by a great continent. The historian Theopompos, a younger contemporary of Plato, wrote of a conversation between King Midas of Phrygia (he of the Golden Touch) and the satyr Silenos. The latter described the Outer Continent as inhabited by a people twice as large and twice as long-lived as those of the known world. One section of this land, known as Anostos (No-Return) was veiled in red mist, and drained by a River of Pleasure and a River of Grief. Once a warlike tribe of these giants crossed the ocean to invade the civilized world, but when they got to the land of the Hyperboreans and found that the latter had nothing worth stealing, they concluded that it was useless to go further and returned home in disgust.\n\nA similar Iranian legend made Zoroaster the descendant of such invaders from the Outer Continent, and perhaps both stories are late versions, much modified, of a much older migration-legend now lost forever in its original form.\n\nFinally, the Greeks were familiar with the general concept of the emergence of lands from the sea and their sinking back into it. Myths told of the Island of Rhodes rising out of the sea. Herodotos on his Egyptian tour noticed fossil sea-shells in the hills, and, in the earliest geological observation on record, correctly inferred that the country must once have been under water. Furthermore it was generally held that Sicily had been torn loose from Italy by an earthquake, and that the Strait of Gibraltar had been opened up by a similar convulsion of nature.\n\nAnd the Greeks also cherished a whole battery of Deluge-legends, like that in which a single pair, Deukalion and Pyrrha, warned by Zeus, escape by making a box in which they floated away. This myth, like that of Noah, may be derived from an old Sumerian legend, which in turn may be based upon real floods that once overwhelmed the Euphrates Valley.\n\nObviously, if any intelligent man of Plato’s time had wanted to write a piece of fiction like the Atlantean story, he had ample material available for his plot. Devout Atlantists take it for granted that these hints and rumors of unknown countries and people and submergences refer to a real Atlantis, any differences being due to distortion of the true historical narrative that appears in Plato’s dialogues. Skeptics, on the other hand, retort that the distortion is the other way round—that Plato borrowed ideas from a number of these geographical, historical, and mythical sources and combined them to compose his fictional masterpiece.\n\nWe shall come back to this question later. Meanwhile I will merely point out that, although many of these references to Atlantes, Atlantic islands, and submergences suggest details of Plato’s narrative, and might have something to do with it, not one of them says in plain language that an island named Atlantis once supported a civilized state but later sank beneath the Atlantic waves. Moreover the Atlas myths and the tales of the African Atlantes and the Western Islands are known to have existed long before Plato’s mention of Atlantis.\n\nAfter Plato’s time, however, a number of writers commented upon the Atlantis story. Although no surviving original writings mention Atlantis for over three centuries after Plato’s time, thereafter we begin to learn from such authors as Strabo what Plato’s immediate successors thought of the tale. At first most of them either were cautiously noncommittal, or took it for granted that Atlantis was a fiction, an allegory by which Plato meant to expound his social ideals. The latter opinion is quite in keeping with what we know of Plato’s character.\n\nFirst, Plato’s prize pupil, Aristoteles of Stagyra, grew up into a lisping, dandyfied encyclopedist who quarreled with his teacher, set up his own school (the Academy) and, with none of Plato’s charm but a vastly greater grasp of fact, wrote a series of huge dry tracts on man and the universe. In these he covered nearly all the scholarly knowledge of his time and in some fields, notably biology and logic, made important additions"
