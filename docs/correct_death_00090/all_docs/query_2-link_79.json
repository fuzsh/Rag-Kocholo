        "text": "It’s been a bit over 40 years since L. Ron Hubbard began the institution Writers of the Future to “pay forward” his success in writing science fiction. In that time, well over 800 writers (and illustrators!) have won awards, most going on to major careers in the field. This week, Steve reviews the 40th volume in the series. And finds it excellent!\n\nSteve takes you back to 1954, when newspapers cost a nickel and a bus trip through town was a dime.
