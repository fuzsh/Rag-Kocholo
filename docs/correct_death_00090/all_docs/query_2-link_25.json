        "text": "by Brian Kunde\n\nWhat’s that, you say? You didn’t know he had an elephant? Well, surprise! No, actually, he didn’t have an elephant, he wrote a book about elephants. Which was titled Elephant. Or, to give it its full cover title, Elephant: The Fascinating Life Cycle of the World’s Largest Land Animal.\n\nThis is a rewrite of one of my earliest L. Sprague de Camp reviews, the second in the series of what I came to regard as my “highlight” pieces, focusing on rarities or oddities from my own personal collection of his writings. It was a project of the early pandemic, taking advantage of the abundant free time accorded by government orders to socially distance and stay at home. I thought I might do maybe ten such highlights. Four years in, there have been close to fifty, and my ambitions have expanded; now, I hope eventually to cover most or all of de Camp’s works.\n\nThe project has changed over time. There was very little meat on the reviews in the early days; a cover scan, and a comment or two. Hence the need for rewrites. So there’s little in common between the original version and this one but a few phrases and paragraphs and the subject. Happily, I find that what was fun to write about then is also fun to write about now. And Elephant is one of my favorites.\n\nYou may wonder how de Camp happened to write a book about elephants. Well, as he notes in his autobiography, he had an early and abiding interest in large animals, whether from the present day, like elephants, or in former times, like dinosaurs. De Camp’s friend and uberfan Phillip Sawyer recalls being told by him that the elephant was his favorite animal. De Camp himself believed “The elephant is the world’s most popular animal,” or so he pronounced on page 1 of the book itself. All of which shows that, once our author became a professional writer, he had a ready-made topic.\n\nThis was foreshadowed early on. Readers of his 1939 novel Lest Darkness Fall may recall that one of the items Martin Padway printed in his Gothic-era newspaper was a piece by himself on the elephant. Plainly, the time-traveling protagonist was a reflection of his creator on this, though de Camp’s own monograph on the subject did not see the light of day for another quarter century.\n\nFor that matter, aficionados of de Camp’s historical novels will recall 1958’s An Elephant for Aristotle, presenting the delightful tale of a soldier from Alexander the Great’s army shepherding one pachyderm from India all the way to Greece during the early Hellenistic era.\n\nBefore and after writing Elephant, de Camp also penned a number of articles concerning the creature, a couple of which were ultimately gathered and reprinted, along with a chapter (“War Elephants”) from Elephant itself, in his late collection The Fringe of the Unknown (1983).\n\nSo, yeah. De Camp dug elephants. But let’s return to the book actually under review! Unlike most of his natural science books, Elephant did not originate as a hardcover. It had, I believe, just one edition, a paperback from Pyramid Books, issued in that firm’s “The Worlds of Science” series in July, 1964. (The whole series, consisting of eighteen titles, is listed on the last page of the book. De Camp’s contribution is no. 18.) To me, this confirms he wrote it as a labor of love, rather than per a pre-negotiated contract, as he did with most of his nonfiction of the period, and may have had to go begging for a publisher. Not that it was in bad company in the series; after all, Isaac Asimov wrote one entry (Fact and Fancy). But most of the other titles are fairly obscure.\n\nThe cover is simple and attractive and illustrates the subject adequately. It is credited to the Paul Bacon Studio. Paul Bacon (1923-2015) was a professional designer of book and album covers (and a jazz musician). Per Wikipedia, he designed about 6,500 jackets and over 200 jazz record covers. Among his other jacket designs are those for the original editions of Joseph Heller’s Catch-22, Ken Kesey’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, and Philip Roth’s Portnoy’s Complaint. De Camp’s in prestigious company, here! Or, is he? After all, it’s Bacon’s studio that gets the credit, so maybe he farmed out the work to his flunkies. Still … nice cover. The book is well-supplied with interior illustrations, including eight pages of black-and-white photographs, numerous line-art sketches, and maps and charts—de Camp drew and supplied most of the sketches himself.\n\nI was a late comer to Elephant. I did not buy it new, having been all of four years old at the time of publication, and so was reduced to picking up a copy in more recent years, from the internet out-of-print dealer Alibris, if memory serves. But I found it a fascinating read, even if science has passed it by; we know a lot more about elephants and their proper taxonomic place these days (superorder Afrotheria, along with sirenians, hyraxes, aardvarks, golden moles, tenrecs, and (yes!) elephant shrews). All of which de Camp would have been happy to tell us, had he only been writing later. Having no way of knowing how genetics and cladistics would overturn our knowledge of biological relationships over the next several decades, he was only able to give us the state-of-the-art science as of the mid-twentieth century.\n\nThat said, he tackled his subject with characteristic thoroughness. Chapter titles include: “My Lord the Elephant,” “Elephants in Action,” “Fossil Elephants,” “Elephants’ Relatives,” “Elephants in Antiquity” (a topic he had already explored in earlier articles), “War Elephants” (ditto), “Hunting Elephant,” and “Captive Elephants.” There’s also a bibliography and index.\n\nMany interesting facts and accounts of historical interest are presented in the book. In Chapter 1, “My Lord the Elephant,” de Camp introduces his subjects, tells us why elephants are so popular, and observes that, despite such attention, many people are either ignorant, ill-informed, or mis-informed about them. He proceeds to devote some twenty-seven interesting pages of close-set print, abetted by drawings and maps, to setting us right. (Alas, a fair number of the basic data here has since been left behind by advancing science.)\n\nChapter 2, “Elephants in Action,” opens “Now that we know what an elephant is, what does it do?” We find out! How they move. How fast they are. Whether you can get away from one if it’s pissed off at you and charging. (“Sometimes.” But bet on the elephant.) They climb! They’re stealthy! They can swim! They “eat enormously.” (Bring out the data!) They are, thankfully, vegetarians. (But cue unusual snippet on a person who did actually get eaten by an elephant.) More data, details and anecdotes on elephant drinking, sleeping, sex, gestation, diseases, resistance to cold, lifespan and longevity, death, intelligence, temperament, habitat, and dangerousness. (Not a word, perhaps. But a fact.)\n\nChapter 3, “Fossil Elephants,” tells us about elephants who are no longer with us, you know, the interesting extinct ones, like mammoths and mastodons—after a history lesson on how their prior existence came to light. Cue Xenophanes, Herodotos, Jefferson, Cuvier, the Chinese, the Siberians, Lewis and Clark, Charles Wilson Peale, and Othaniel Charles Marsh. More about the frozen Siberian mammoths, fossil discoveries in Egypt, and syrenians and hyraxes. Which leads us into…\n\nChapter 4, “Elephants’ Relatives” —with other creatures related to elephants. After an intro and crash course on the Linnaean binomial classification system, naturally! Which leads to how all those fossil elephants we’ve just seen discovered and explained have gotten sorted and determined to be not so much actual elephants as members of the same order. (The classifications, too, have since had to be revised. But this is how they were understood in the middle of the last century.) Oddly, it’s really in this chapter that we actually get to see (more line drawings) and have described most of the creatures ostensibly the subject of the previous chapter. Like dinotheres, mastodonts, stegodonts, and, at last, the “true” elephants, divvied up into loxodonts (African elephants and the like), elephants (Indian elephants and the like), and mammoths (mammoths). We learn more of how the various varieties fared over time and several ice ages, interacted with Neanderthals and Cro-Magnon men, and came to be the subjects of cave paintings. Then there is a break for eight pages of photographic plates.\n\nThen, in Chapter 5, “Elephants in Antiquity,” the elephantine tale is carried forward into the civilized eras of the Mesopotamians, Indians, Greeks and Romans. We learn how they fared and what savants wrote about them. Ktesias. Plato. Aristotle. Rather a lot from Aristotle, actually. Alexander the Great’s rather shocked encounter with Indian war elephants. How the Seleucids, Ptolemies, and Carthaginians subsequently used elephants. (Also for war.) Pliny the Elder on elephants, again rather a lot, even more than we got from Aristotle. Broad swathes of this chapter are in fact just lengthy translations from these two. Then a brief summary of the span from Pliny through the Middle Ages, culminating on bits on the pet elephants of Louis IX of France, Henry III of England, and Pope Leo X. We learn in the course of this how the Romans treated elephants in their bloody arena games. Not well. It’s thanks to them and the Arab conquerors who followed that the herds in Mediterranean Africa were wiped out.\n\nIn Chapter 6, “War Elephants” … but hey, didn’t we just get those? Yes, but here we get a lot more detail on how elephants were used in warfare by the Indians, countered by Alexander, and used again his successors, and the Hellenistic and Carthaginian polities that followed. Pretty much straight history, here. Elephants proved decisive at Ipsos, the battle in which Seleukos crushed Antigonos. Elsewhere and elsewhen, not so much. But still, elephants were cool, so everyone had to have some. Until the Romans, like Alexander, decisively countered them. After that, they were mostly employed in warfare by the Persians, Turks, Indians (of course!) and Southeast Asians. Their last hurrah came in 1930, when “a force of French and Indo-Chinese guerillas invaded Thailand on two elephants, three horses, and a bicycle!”\n\nChapter 7, “Hunting Elephant,” covers the human pursuit of elephants, from the Pleistocene to the modern safari. In hunting, for some reason, one reduces the plural to the singular, perhaps because people tend to hunt things one at a time. The topic is illustrated by incident, story, anecdote, and in one instance a cave engraving showing the trapping of a mammoth. The gruesome trade in ivory is not neglected. All rather unedifying but unavoidable, given that de Camp was apparently fascinated by the subject of hunting large creatures. Anyone interested in learning how his time-traveling bush guide Reginald Rivers got his start before abandoning contemporary expeditions for forays into the Cretaceous can get the skinny on that here. This sort of thing has largely given way to photographing elephants on preserves, de Camp informs us.\n\nChapter 8, “Captive Elephants.” There’s hunting, and there’s catching (and maintaining). Most of those intrigued by elephants first encounter them in zoos, wild animal parks, shows and circuses. And, more recently, film or television documentaries, from Walt Disney to Mutual of Omaha’s Wild Kingdom, and beyond. An acquaintance of mine from high school used to emcee a local elephant show. Maybe he still does, though I imagine he’d be getting to retirement age by now. Sounds romantic, even a dream job, though I suspect the day-to-day’s a lot more mundane. De Camp starts us off with a how-to, leading into taming and training, as practiced in South Asia, which is where most of that is done. Most catching, after all, is to obtain work elephants, and South Asia is where they get worked. We learn much of the lives of working elephants, amid more anecdote and story, before plunging into why else people have caught elephants—again, for war, the arena (those Romans, again), and display.\n\nAlmost the last thing featured is a recap of the story of the famous Jumbo, exploited by P. T. Barnum and others. I kind of knew about Jumbo before but didn’t remember the bits about him giving rides to children in London, or that he died charging a locomotive. Impressive that he derailed the thing; sad that he died.\n\nDe Camp ends his book with an optimistic take on elephants’ future in the wild, given the then-rosy prospects of African independence, the decline of hunting safaris in the face of sight-seeing tourism, and the establishment of new national parks and other protected areas. The note comes across as wistful, now. Yet to come, and unforeseen, were the economic and ecological disasters, and the pressures of population growth and climate change. Not to mention the rise of black-market poaching to feed the insatiable market for worked ivory and traditional medicines in an increasingly affluent Asia.\n\nWell, they do say that the key to a happy ending is choosing where to halt the story.\n\nI have devoted considerable wordage to what I, and you, might justifiably consider an obsolete book. To a purpose; to demonstrate that said book, superseded science notwithstanding, is still well worth a read. De Camp loved elephants, and will make you love elephants, too, the heartbreaking turns their history may take notwithstanding. If you want to know more about them, there’s really no better place to start. Go to your local (or internet-ical) out-of-print dealer and score yourself a copy. Get in fascinating and intriguing detail what I have given you only in summary. I guarantee you won’t be sorry!\n\nIncidentally, I’ve overlooked a bit of preliminary matter, an “About the Author” section that appears at the beginning of the book, rather than at the end or on the back cover as in other instances. Here, in two fat and one slender paragraphs, we are told, first, that Elephant “marks [de Camp’s] fortieth book in print,” and his previous writings are touted, most notably The Ancient Engineers (1963), his “most successful to date.” Second, his educational, employment (non-writing) and military attainments are summarized. And finally, it is confessed that “for the better part of thirty years, he has devoted most of his time to writing and his principal hobbies, which he lists as gardening, reading, study, travel, and classical recordings.”\n\nThe book is dedicated to Anne and George Gaylord Simpson. The tribute was apt. Anne (Roe) Simpson (1904-1991) was a clinical psychologist and researcher. Her husband George Gaylord Simpson (1902-1984) was a renowned paleontologist specializing in extinct mammals. De Camp, according to his autobiography, got to know the Simpsons during his residence in New York City, together with other scientists connected with the American Museum of Natural History. He doesn’t give the details, but he was a member, loved the place, and likely haunted it. You can get to know a lot of actual scientists that way, as I can attest myself. I turned the same trick as a member of and volunteer with the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco in my youth.\n\nIn later years de Camp continued to correspond with George Simpson, and even took him as a guest to one of the social banquets of the Trap Door Spiders. He writes: “It is a custom … that all Spiders are called ‘Doctor’ ipso facto. When a member like John Clark the chemist … has a real doctorate, in the German manner he is introduced as ‘Doctor Doctor Clark’ etcetera. When I explained this to Simpson, he laughed. ‘I’ve got six,’ he said. So I introduced him as Doctor Doctor Doctor Doctor Doctor Doctor [Doctor] Simpson.” (De Camp, L. Sprague. Time & Chance: An Autobiography, Donald M. Grant, Publisher, Inc., Hampton Falls, NH, 1996, p. 197).\n\n#"
