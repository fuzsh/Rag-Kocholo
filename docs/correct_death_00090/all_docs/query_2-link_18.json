        "text": "by Brian Kunde\n\nMy L. Sprague de Camp highlight this time around is the last of his general collections, both in terms of publication and my exploration of them here. Years in the Making: The Time-Travel Stories of L. Sprague de Camp (NESFA Press, Framingham, MA, 2005) is one of the odd ducks of the sequence. I have made a distinction in these reviews between de Camp’s general collections of miscellaneous stories (my coverage of which is rendered complete with this review) and his single-series collections (of which I have yet to discuss several). But this collection kind of straddles the categories. It’s miscellaneous in the sense that its contents are not devoted to a single series. But it’s like the single-series collections in that it’s a themed one.\n\nThere has been one edition to date, along with one reprint, both from the same publisher. The first, issued at the princely sum of $25.00 a copy and on quality paper, came out in February, 2005. It was followed in September of the same year by a book club version, issued in conjunction with the Science Fiction Book Club, which is largely identical to the first, but halved in price (to $12.50), slightly reduced in size and printed on cheaper, thinner paper with more of a tendency to yellow over the years. If it sounds like I know whereof I speak it’s because I do; my copy’s the cheaper version! The economy wasn’t really worth it. In my defense, I didn’t know; I ordered it from a second-hand dealer, and there was nothing to indicate it was the debased version but the book itself, when it arrived.\n\nComplaints aside, it’s a well-made book, as are most NESFA productions. It was approved (and copyrighted) by “The Estate of L. Sprague de Camp.” Mark L. Olson was the editor, and the volume is graced with an original, if brief, introduction by de Camp disciple Harry Turtledove. The dust jacket design is by Alice N. S. Lewis, with art by noted spec fic artist Bob Eggleton, and gives us, in greens and yellows, the foregrounded head and shoulders of a terrifying specimen of Tyrannosaurus Rex, separated by a river and waterfall from two modern-day hunters in the background. A trio of distant birds behind Mr. Rex also helps provide scale. It’s a beautiful, dramatic and appropriate scene, deriving from that most iconic of de Camp time-travel tales, “A Gun for Dinosaur,” which of course appears within. Beneath the painting a slab of black provides the background for the author’s name in large white letters, with the title and subtitle (the later repeating his name) in smaller green letters below.\n\nAnd now, if you’ll forgive me, I’ll indulge in a lengthy digression before getting into the meat of the book. This volume, as its subtitle notes, purports to gather together de Camp’s time-travel stories. Well, it does and it doesn’t. (In fairness, the front flap of the dust jacket does tell us we will be getting a “set of stories about time-travel—forwards, backwards, and sideways!”) What’s between the covers is in fact more various.\n\nSix of the pieces collected therein are in fact poems (it follows the example of The Best of L. Sprague de Camp (1978) in including such), of which few concern time-travel, most merely meditating on past times. Of the remaining eight prose pieces, one is not a story at all, but an article (though it does incorporate examples to its argument in the form of fictional episodes that themselves collectively form a sort of inset story).\n\nNot all the seven actual stories truly concern time-travel, either. One involves crosstime-travel, that is, travel to a parallel world, in the present, rather than to the past or future. One involves the survival of an individual from the paleolithic era into the present, and is set exclusively in the present; the only time-travel in this one is that which we all experience—the day-to-day accumulation of experience, age, and memory as we live our allotted span of years. One involves a sort of general infection of people by the memories of their ancestors—an invasion of the present by the past, if you will, but without any actual going to one from the other. Another takes the opposite approach, with the past invaded by the present, as the minds of two moderns are made unwilling guests or passengers in the brains of two people of the past, without either being able to make their presence known to their hosts or alter in any way the events their hosts had experienced.\n\nIn all, only three of the stories fall strictly into the category of what most people would consider bona fide travel in time, in each instance to a past era. Of these, one appears to change the past, and consequently the present from which the traveler originated, one emphasizes the essential immutability of the past, and the third, like the first, appears to change the past—though in this instance, likely not the present, as it is postulated early on that his actions could branch a new timeline off from the original.\n\nNor does this book gather in all de Camp’s time-travel stories, either in the strict sense or the inclusively fuzzy standard it appears to adopt. Missing, for example, is the early “The Best-Laid Scheme” (Astounding, February 1941), a time-travel spoof in which the mere act of traveling through time changes both the entire timeline and the travelers themselves. Also overlooked are the four Drinkwhiskey Institute tales starting with “The Effects of Time Travel” (Astounding, April 1942), also spoofs, three of the Gavagan’s Bar tales, “The Rape of the Lock“ (The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, February 1952), “Where to, Please?“ (Weird Tales, September 1952), and “The Untimely Toper” (The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, July 1953), all of the Reginald Rivers tales aside from “A Gun for Dinosaur,” and quite likely others I have overlooked. Not to mention such borderline cases as the Harold Shea stories, detailing travel to past imagined worlds, and such borderline cases as the novels The Glory That Was (1960) and The Carnelian Cube (1948), both of which deal with instances of apparent time-travel (in fact, recreation/reenactments of the past, and, in the latter, perhaps crosstime-travel as well, in the guise of travel to supposed “dream worlds.” To extend the discussion very far into crosstime-travel would be to extend it endlessly, so much of de Camp’s fiction being set in whole or in part in parallel universes. But the point is made.\n\nBeing published in 2005, this collection is a posthumous one, and it is, in a way a realization of what the preceding posthumous collection, Aristotle and the Gun and Other Stories, (2002) seems to have wanted to be; it, too, having focused mostly on time-travel. I must concede that the present one does so more successfully, albeit with the numerous caveats above adduced. Years in the Making also marks the beginning of an ambitious, if curtailed, project by its publisher, as it is given a series designation, “L. Sprague de Camp, Volume 1.” The implication is that this was to open a whole sequence of de Camp books collecting his shorter fiction as a whole. And in due course a companion, a “Volume 2” would indeed appear, reprinting all the de Camp and Pratt Harold Shea stories. That, however, is by definition a single-series collection, not a general one at all; hence I will defer treatment of it until I return my attention to that other type of de Camp collection. And there have been no further volumes since those two. So my close look at the miscellaneous collections must end here.\n\nBut first, don’t think I’ve forgotten about the actual contents of this book! Here they are:\n\n• “Introduction” by Harry Turtledove. A capsule description of de Camp’s career and merits is provided, and the pieces in the collection lauded as “show[ing] him in top form.” He notes that several are recognized as classics. He briefly discusses these, including Lest Darkness Fall, reflecting on how it “profoundly changed my own life” (which it did, inspiring his college major and writing career), “The Wheels of If,” with an amusing aside on his own struggles in writing a sequel, “A Gun for Dinosaur,” “Aristotle and the Gun,” and “Language for Time Travelers,” in which “de Camp asks a question that does not seem to have occurred to anyone before him: once we get into the past—or, for that matter, into the future—how do we communicate with the people we find there?” He notes that “Seeing problems no one else has noticed is one of the hallmarks of genius,” and concludes by praising NESFA’s “great service” in compiling the collection.\n\n• “The Wheels of If“ (Unknown, October 1940). This is one of the classic, formative alternate universe stories. It together with Murray Leinster’s “Sidewise in Time” (Astounding, June 1934) and de Camp’s own Lest Darkness Fall (Unknown, December 1939), pretty much defined the genre. Allister Park, a prosecutor and local politician is thrown into a parallel universe where due to very minor differences in the course of history, North America has been settled by descendants of the Vikings and New York is replaced by New Belfast. He endeavors to get back into his own universe using his ingenuity to gain influence in his new surroundings. Flashbacks to the two historical points of divergence between Park’s (and our) world and that in which he found himself enliven the early portion of the story, these being the Synod of Whitby (664 A.D.) and the Battle of Tours (732 A.D.). De Camp had used a similar device in his earliest published story, “The Isolinguals” (1937). The roots of his later historical fiction can be found in these two early tales.\n\n• “Tiger in the Rain” (poem, Amra, September 1970). The poet recalls seeing from elephant-back in Assam, India, a tiger hunting deer, and muses that this “oldest foe of my race; / The cave-man’s nightmare,” today “Survives on sufferance, … / For man has mastered the beasts; instead, / Now men upon other men prey as they can.”\n\n• “Balsamo’s Mirror” (The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, June 1976). College student Willy Newbury and a friend nostalgic for pre-industrial times (unnamed, but clearly meant to be H. P. Lovecraft) encounter a mystic who claims to possess the mirror of Nostradamus, which she claims allowed that prophet to experience other eras. Trying it out, the two find their minds trapped in the bodies of a pair of eighteenth-century yeomen poaching on the manor of a squire who covets their land. Presented with a legal excuse to kill them, the squire does so; the trauma returns Willy and his friend to their own bodies and time, where they find the mirror broken and the mystic dead of a heart attack. Willy’s friend decides the past isn’t what it’s cracked up to be.\n\n• “Time” (poem, The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, October 1967). The poet wonders if he and various historical figures, “could we have breached the glassy wall / That sunders Now from Then,” might have been friends, only to note that “The wall is thick [and] These bubbles known as men, / When once they burst, cannot be blown again.” He wonders “Will any man, when I have reached my end, / Wish likewise that he could have been my friend?”\n\n• “Aristotle and the Gun“ (Astounding, February 1958). Sherman Weaver appropriates a time machine to project himself back to ancient Greece in the time of Philip II of Macedon, planning to instruct Aristotle in the scientific method and so create a more advanced present. Passing himself as a visitor from India, Weaver demonstrates marvels to the astounded sage, but falls afoul of the young prince Alexander and an official who suspects him of being a spy for the king of Persia. Preserved from a dire fate when his time projection wears off and returns him to the present, Weaver finds himself in a new pickle; his wonders had overwhelmed Aristotle, who swore off science entirely, resulting in a modern world mired in a prolonged medieval era. Since his time machine now was never invented, Weaver is unable to go back again and correct his mistake.\n\n• “Language for Time Travelers” (Astounding, July 1938). De Camp’s classic article exploring an issue previously ignored by writers of time-travel fiction; the barriers to communication in the eras visited by time-travelers posed by natural language change. Examples of the difficulties involved are humorously explored through the fictional tribulations of one such traveler, dubbed Morgan Jones, confronted with various linguistic scenarios. Incidentally, de Camp wrote a much later follow-up article, “How To Talk Futurian” (The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, October 1957) that continues the argument in much the same vein, but gets far less press. Also worth a read. You can find it in de Camp’s non-fiction collection The Ragged Edge of Science (Owlswick Press, 1980), previously covered in this series.\n\n• “Faunas” (poem, The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, September 1968). The poet recalls his youthful fascination with prehistoric creatures and wish to have been taken back to their times, contrasted with his adult realization that in his fellow modern men “lurk spirits every bit as queer / As brontosaurus or titanothere / And worthier of fear.”\n\n• “The Gnarly Man“ (Unknown, June 1939). Shining Hawk, a Neanderthal man rendered ageless 50,000 years ago by a lightning strike, has survived into modern times by keeping a low profile. Currently posing as sideshow “geek” Clarence Gaffney, he is found out by anthropologist Matilda Sandler, at whose urging he warily agrees to submit to medical examination in return for surgery to correct some old injuries. But when Sandler develops a romantic interest in him and the prospective surgeon is discovered plotting to dissect him to achieve medical fame, Gaffney bolts. Sadly, he loses his hat.\n\n• “Reward of Virtue” (poem, The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, September 1970). “Sir Gilbert de Vere was a virtuous knight; / … / But cherished a goal that he never could sight: / He wanted a dragon to fight.” In response to his prayer, God sends him back to the Cretaceous. How’s that for a unique method of time travel? But it, um, doesn’t work out well for Sir Gilbert. These things never do…\n\n• “A Gun for Dinosaur“ (Galaxy, March 1956). Time-traveling hunter Reginald Rivers turns down a prospective client of his time safari business on the grounds that he is not big enough to hunt the dinosaurs of the Cretaceous period. He justifies his decision with an extended anecdote of a previous expedition involving Courtney James, an arrogant and spoiled playboy, and August Holtzinger, a small, timid man unable to handle the heavy weaponry needed to take down dinosaurs. James’ reckless shooting roused a slumbering Tyrannosaurus, which snapped up Holtzinger because his gun was not powerful enough to kill it. Rivers blamed James for Holtzinger’s death, and aborted the trip. Furious, James tried to go back in time again to assassinate Rivers’ past self. The space-time continuum avoided this paradox by spontaneously snapping James back to the present, splatting him in the process.\n\n• “Nahr al-Kalb” (poem, Amra, December 1967). The title references the scene, the Lebanese river of that name, where various historical warriors erected stelae commemorating their exploits. It is usually called Dog River (a literal translation) in the poem. The poet’s visit there to scan the inscriptions is recounted; he ponders on those who made them, including Rameses II, Sennacherib, Alexander the Great, Antoninus (Caracalla), the Muslim conquerors, the Crusaders, the World War I British and the World War II Free French. The poet realizes “[t]hese gallant fighters all are dust, as those to come will be; / But Nahr al-Kalb flows ever from the mountain to the sea.”\n\n• Lest Darkness Fall (novel, Unknown, December 1939). As previously observed, this is the time-travel novel that defined the genre. Modern archeologist Martin Padway, visiting Rome, is struck by lightning at the Pantheon and zapped back to the Rome of 535 AD. In that period the Western Roman Empire has long since fallen, Italy is ruled by the Ostrogoths, and the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire is poised to invade and reconquer the peninsula in a ruinous war that will mark the onset of the Dark Ages. To prevent the impending collapse of civilization, Padway sets out to introduce technical innovations from his own time. He is soon embroiled in politics, becoming the power behind the Ostrogothic throne and defeating the Byzantines. Ultimately Padway stabilizes the Italo-Gothic kingdom and consolidates his reforms. Thanks to him, Europe will skip the Dark Ages; darkness will not fall.\n\n• “Kaziranga, Assam” (poem, Amra, October 1967) The title references the scene, in India. A “Ktesias’ unicorn” (rhinoceros) is described in an encounter with tourists on elephant back. The poet wonders if the beast would “think of ages gone / When of the earth his kind were kings and queens,” were it “blessed with brains.”\n\n• “The Isolinguals“ (Astounding, September 1937). This was de Camp’s first published story, and it started his fiction career with a bang. Other writers could have built whole careers off concepts here scattered hither and yon with abandon. Oddly, while it appeared in a few anthologies over the years, it never found a place in one of de Camp’s own collections until this one. Some critics have deemed its execution a bit clunky; perhaps this, together with its reliance on a mad scientist as the plot-driver, made him reluctant to revisit it. He needn’t have worried. The mysterious phenomenon explored is fascinating, and the rapid pace carries the reader right along. People all over New York are getting possessed by the personas of ancestors, right down to the languages those ancestors spoke. Society unravels amid widespread incomprehension as the syndrome starts spreading throughout the country. Scientists Lindsley and Lamarque work against time to cure the plague before they too are possessed and civilization collapses. The source is ultimately traced to Slidell, a would-be dictator exploiting the discovery of a rogue genius that triggers the ancestral-memory switch. Special helmets shield Slidell and his followers. Once the insidious device is destroyed, everyone returns to normal.\n\nSo. How does the collection stand up, over all? As will be evident from the above, I have more than a few quibbles, but—quite well, as it happens. While not as comprehensive as the subtitle implies, it constitutes an excellent introduction to de Camp’s various takes on time-travel and time in general, and to his body of work as a whole. For those who have not previously encountered his writing, it’s a great place to start—and it starts with some of his best. You really can’t go wrong with this one. Highly, highly recommended.\n\nThere is no dedication in the book, which is not surprising, the author being deceased, but, really, the whole volume is a dedication, in its way, to de Camp. Editor Mark L. Olsen remains discretely in the background, but introducer Harry Turtledove does offer this sparkling tribute to the author at the end of his piece: “In this collection, the NESFA Press does sf a great service by gathering together the time-travel tales of a writer less appreciated than he might have been, not least because of his modesty and reluctance of [sic: to] blow his own horn.”"
