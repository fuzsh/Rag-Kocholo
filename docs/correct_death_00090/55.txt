Catherine Crook de Camp, 1907 - 2000

Catherine Crook de Camp, wife, business manager, and sometime collaborator of her husband L. Sprague de Camp, died April 9, 2000 in Plano, Texas. She suffered from Alzheimer's, and had abdominal surgery in January, from which she seemed to recover well until the past month, when she went rapidly downhill. She edited her husband's autobiography Time & Chance, and provided chapters for the 1975 update of his Science Ficton Handbook, Revised. She wrote two financial management books, and collaborated with Sprague on several novels and anthologies. The family requests, in lieu of flowers, donations to the Alzheimer's Association.

Karel Thole, 1914 - 2000

Friends and family reported on March 26, 2000, the death of distinguished European SF artist Karel Thole at his home in Cannobio on Lake Maggiore, Italy. It appears that death came suddenly to him in the night of the 26th, although the 86-year-old artist had been suffering for quite a while. He worked for several major publishers in Italy from the early 1950s until 1986, when eye problems forced him into semi-retirement. Among his best-known works was a series of SF covers for Heyne paperbacks in Germany, several of which were collected in book form and in a 1975 calendar. In the US, DAW Books and Ballantine hosted many of his paintings, which were often done in a format with a painting within a circle. [Covers shown are from 1972 and 1973.] Thole dominated European SF art in the �70s and �80s much as Richard Powers dominated American SF art in the �50s and �60s, though Thole had a wider range of influences, including Magritte, Dali, Ernst, Balthus, Beckmann, and others.

Jean Karl, 1927 - 2000

Jean Karl, editor for Atheneum Books and author, died March 30, 2000 at a hospice in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. At Atheneum, where she stayed until her retirement in 1985, she founded the imprint Books for Younger Readers, as well as the YA mass-market imprint Aladdin and the YA SF imprint Atheneum Argo. She persuaded Anne McCaffrey to write the YA books in the ''Pern'' series, beginning with Dragonsong in 1976, and she edited and published three of Ursula K. Le Guin's ''Earthsea'' books, beginning with The Tombs of Atuan in 1971, followed by The Farthest Shore (1972), which won a National Book Award. As author, she's best known for The Turning Place (1976).
