        "text": "Season of television series\n\nOnce Upon a TimeSeason 1StarringNo. of episodes22ReleaseOriginal networkABCOriginal releaseOctober 23, 2011 ( ) –\n\nMay 13, 2012 (2012-05-13)Season chronology\n\nNext →\n\nSeason 2\n\nList of episodes\n\nThe first season of the American ABC fantasy-drama series Once Upon a Time premiered on October 23, 2011, and concluded on May 13, 2012. The series was created by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. The series' first season centers around the Enchanted Forest and Storybrooke, and the Evil Queen's (Lana Parrilla) plot to destroy everyone's happiness so she can be the only one with a happy ending.\n\nOnce Upon a Time's first season received generally favorable reviews from critics who praised its cast, visuals, and twists on fairy tales, though some criticized its uneven tone. The pilot episode was watched by 12.93 million viewers and achieved an adult 18–49 rating/share of 4.0/10.[1] Those numbers dipped late in the season to a series low of 8.36 million viewers and a 2.8/8 adult 18–49 rating/share in April 2012,[2] but rebounded slightly for the season finale with 9.66 million viewers and a 3.3/10 adult 18–49 rating/share.[3]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nAll of the classic fairy tales and other stories exist together in the same continuity, though many of the events played out slightly different to how the stories are told in our world. The structure of the show cuts back and forth between the events happening in the real world and the corresponding events that happened in the fairy tale world.\n\nOn the night of her 28th birthday, bail bonds collector Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) is reunited with Henry Mills (Jared S. Gilmore)—the son she gave up for adoption ten years previous—who takes her back to his hometown of Storybrooke, Maine.\n\nHenry possesses a large book of fairy tales, suspecting that Emma is the daughter of Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas), who sent her away so she would be protected from a powerful curse enacted by the Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla), a curse in which the queen is the only one with a happy ending. Because of the curse, everyone in Storybrooke is frozen in time with no memories of their former selves—except for the Queen, who is Storybrooke's mayor and Henry's adoptive mother, Regina Mills. Emma of course considers this theory to be completely outlandish and returns Henry home, but she still decides to remain in the New England town after becoming attached to him. This action causes the hands of the clock tower to move for the first time in 28 years. Henry also tells Emma that they are the only people who can leave Storybrooke, as others who try will suffer accidents.\n\nIn the fairy tale world, it is revealed that Snow and Charming, concerned for the safety of their unborn child, went to seek advice from the imprisoned trickster Rumpelstiltskin (Robert Carlyle). In exchange for the child's name, he told them their only hope was the child, who would return on her 28th birthday and begin \"The Final Battle\". The child, an infant girl, is born on the day the Queen enacts her curse and is placed in a wardrobe carved out of an enchanted tree which takes the child to our world, where she grew up in the foster system, rebelled in her teen years, and ended up having Henry at 18.\n\nIn Storybrooke, Emma is soon elected as Sheriff following the sudden death of the previous Sheriff, Graham Humbert (Jamie Dornan), believed by Henry to be the Huntsman. Regina's antagonistic attitude raises Emma's suspicions and prompts her to move in with Henry's teacher Mary Margaret Blanchard, believed by Henry to be her mother, Snow White. Regina's bitter rivalry with Storybrooke's wealthiest resident, Mr. Gold, becomes heated when she learns he is still aware of his true identity as Rumplestiltskin. Mary Margaret falls in love with David Nolan, a coma patient who is really Prince Charming. David wakes up after she reads Henry's fairytale book to him as a favor to Henry. David, however, is married to Kathryn Nolan, the woman who is (in the fairy tale world) his ex-fiancée Princess Abigail, daughter of King Midas. Unable to deny their love, David and Mary Margaret soon begin a secret relationship that becomes public and upsets Kathryn.\n\nKathryn eventually decides to go to Boston and let David be with Mary Margaret only to disappear before leaving Storybrooke. Sometime later, an antique jewelry box that belonged to Mary Margaret when she was a child is found buried near the old toll bridge and is revealed to contain a human heart, which is proven to be Kathryn's via DNA testing. Mary Margaret is arrested for Kathryn's supposed murder and hires Mr. Gold as her attorney. As Mary Margaret is about to be prosecuted by corrupt District Attorney Albert Spencer (Alan Dale), Kathryn is found alive in an alley. It is revealed that Regina and Mr. Gold plotted to frame Mary Margaret and force her out of Storybrooke, but Mr. Gold double-crossed Regina and let Kathryn go to exonerate Mary Margaret. When Daily Mirror chief editor Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito), previously the Magic Mirror, confesses to having abducted Kathryn to jump-start his career, Emma is not convinced. She concludes that Regina orchestrated the conspiracy and forced Sidney to \"confess\".\n\nEmma soon discovers that writer August W. Booth (Eion Bailey), who is the first stranger ever to arrive in town after she did, is from the Enchanted Forest as well: he is Pinocchio, who was sent to our world through the same wardrobe that brought Emma to watch over her.[4] He abandoned her out of fear and is slowly turning back into a wooden puppet as a result. Emma then attempts to take Henry out of Storybrooke forever but is then forced to reconsider when he refuses to go. She finally makes a deal with Regina, in which she agrees to leave but will still get to visit Henry on occasion.\n\nSince Regina knows Emma's true identity, however, she retrieves her poisoned apple (the same one she used on Snow White) to use on Emma in the form of an apple turnover. Henry, desperate to prove to Emma that the curse is real, takes a bite of the turnover and collapses to the floor unconscious. Emma, who now starts to believe after seeing flashbacks of her true past, is forced to ally with Regina to save Henry and retrieve Rumplestiltskin's true love potion from Maleficent, imprisoned as a dragon underneath the Clock Tower. After slaying the dragon, Emma heads back to save Henry, but Mr. Gold intervenes and steals the potion, leaving Emma halfway up the elevator shaft and Regina tied to a chair and gagged.\n\nWhen Henry is pronounced dead, Emma and Regina return to the hospital to say goodbye to his body. Emma kisses him on the forehead, causing a pulse of energy to engulf the entire town and restore everyone's true memories while freeing Henry from the effects of the poisoned apple. Snow and Charming reunite with each other, and Regina returns to her mansion alone as Emma begins to wonder why no one is returning to the Other World since the curse is broken. Rumplestiltskin reunites with his true love Belle (Emilie de Ravin) and takes her to a Wishing Well deep in the heart of the forest, a well with the power to restore that which one had lost. He takes the potion and drops it into the well, causing a purple cloud to emerge and consume Storybrooke as the clock strikes 8:15.\n\nCast and characters\n\n[edit]\n\nCrew\n\n[edit]\n\nOnce Upon a Time is created and produced by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz.

Avital Norman Nathman of ##### stated that she liked the show for \"infusing a feminist sensibility\" into the stories.[28] Feministing's Genie Leslie commented that Emma was a \"badass\", that she liked how Emma was \"very adamant that women be able to make their own decisions about their lives and their children\", and how Emma was a \"well-rounded\" character who was \"feminine, but not 'girly'\".[29] Natalie Wilson from Ms. praised the show for a strong, \"kick-butt\" female lead, for including multiple strong women who take turns doing the saving with the men, for subverting the fetishization of true love, and for dealing with the idea of what makes a mother in a more nuanced fashion. Wilson went on to state about the lead: \"Her pursuit of a 'happy ending' is not about finding a man or going to a ball all gussied up, but about detective work, about building a relationship with her son Henry, and about seeking the 'truth' as to why time stands still in the corrupt Storybrooke world.[30]\n\nRatings\n\n[edit]\n\nViewership and ratings per episode of Once Upon a Time season 1 No. Title Air date Rating/share\n\n(18–49) Viewers\n\n(millions) DVR\n\n(18–49) DVR viewers\n\n(millions) Total\n\n(18–49) Total viewers\n\n(millions) 1 \"Pilot\" October 23, 2011 4.0 12.93[1] 1.2 2.54 5.2 15.48[31] 2 \"The Thing You Love Most\" October 30, 2011 3.9 11.74[5] 1.1 2.36 5.0 14.10[32] 3 \"Snow Falls\" November 6, 2011 3.8 11.45[6] 1.0 2.62 4.8 14.07[33] 4 \"The Price of Gold\" November 13, 2011 3.8 11.36[7] 1.1 2.54 4.9 13.90[34] 5 \"That Still Small Voice\" November 27, 2011 3.4 10.69[8] 1.1 2.56 4.5 13.24[35] 6 \"The Shepherd\" December 4, 2011 3.2 9.66[9] 1.0 2.43 4.2 12.08[36] 7 \"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\" December 11, 2011 2.9 8.91[10] 1.2 2.72 4.1 11.64[37] 8 \"Desperate Souls\" January 8, 2012 3.7 10.35[11] 1.3 2.86 5.0 13.21[38] 9 \"True North\" January 15, 2012 3.3 9.83[12] 1.4 2.99 4.7 12.82[39] 10 \"7:15 A.M.\" January 22, 2012 3.2 9.33[13] 1.3 2.99 4.5 12.32[40] 11 \"Fruit of the Poisonous Tree\" January 29, 2012 3.5 10.91[14] 1.2 2.56 4.7 13.47[41] 12 \"Skin Deep\" February 12, 2012 3.0 8.65[15] 1.3 2.99 4.3 11.64[42] 13 \"What Happened to Frederick\" February 19, 2012 3.1 9.84[16] 1.1 2.61 4.2 12:45[43] 14 \"Dreamy\" March 4, 2012 3.4 10.67[17] 1.2 2.55 4.6 13.21[44] 15 \"Red-Handed\" March 11, 2012 2.9 9.29[18] 1.1 2.63 4.0 11.92[45] 16 \"Heart of Darkness\" March 18, 2012 2.9 8.69[19] 1.1 2.27 4.0 10.96[46] 17 \"Hat Trick\" March 25, 2012 2.9 8.82[20] 1.1 2.38 4.0 11.20[47] 18 \"The Stable Boy\" April 1, 2012 2.8 8.36[2] 1.0 2.31 3.8 10.67[48] 19 \"The Return\" April 22, 2012 3.0 9.08[21] 1.0 2.51 4.0 11.59[49] 20 \"The Stranger\" April 29, 2012 3.0 9.20[22] 0.9 2.10 3.9 11.29[50] 21 \"An Apple Red As Blood\" May 6, 2012 3.0 8.94[23] 1.1 2.47 4.1 11.42[51] 22 \"A Land Without Magic\" May 13, 2012 3.3 9.66[3] 1.0 2.20 4.3 11.86[52]\n\nSoundtrack\n\n[edit]\n\nExtended play\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbum\n\n[edit]\n\nOnce Upon a Time: Original Television SoundtrackSoundtrack album by ReleasedMay 1, 2012 ( )[54]Length62:54LabelIntradaOnce Upon a Time soundtrack chronology\n\nThe album was released with five different collectible covers.\n\nNovelization\n\n[edit]\n\nOnce Upon a Time debuted a fantasy novel from Disney-owned Hyperion Books.
