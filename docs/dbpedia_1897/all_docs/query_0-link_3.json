Club that he felt that the series \"ran for too long\" and felt that the first four seasons were \"as good as anything [he had] been involved in.\"[2] In February 2024, O'Donoghue spoke with Collider about the possibility of a revival, stating that he had \"spoken to [Kitsis and Horowitz] and a few other people about it\".[3][4]\n\nSynopsis\n\nFrom the inventive minds of Lost executive producers Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis comes a bold new imagining of the world, where fairy tales and the modern-day are about to collide.\n\nAnd they all lived happily ever after - or so everyone was led to believe. Emma Swan knows how to take care of herself. She's a 28-year-old bail bonds collector who's been on her own ever since she was abandoned as a baby. But when the son she gave up years ago finds her, everything starts to change. Henry is now 10 years old and in desperate need of Emma's help. He believes that Emma actually comes from an alternate world and is Snow White and Prince Charming's missing daughter. According to his book of fairytales, they sent her away to protect her from the Evil Queen's curse, which trapped the fairytale world forever, frozen in time, and brought them into our modern world.\n\nOf course, Emma doesn't believe a word, but when she brings Henry back to Storybrooke, she finds herself drawn to this unusual boy and his strange New England town. Concerned for Henry, she decides to stay for a while, but she soon suspects that Storybrooke is more than it seems. It's a place where magic has been forgotten but is still powerfully close... where fairytale characters are alive, even though they don't remember who they once were. The epic battle for the future of all worlds is beginning, but for good to win, Emma will have to accept her destiny and fight like hell.[5]\n\nStory\n\nDevelopment\n\nOnce Upon a Time has been conceived by Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis in 2004 before joining the writing staff of Lost, but they wanted to wait until that series was over to focus on their project.
