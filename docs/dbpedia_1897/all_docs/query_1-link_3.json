The town's only hope lies with a bail bondsperson named Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison), the daughter of Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas), who was transported from the fairy tale world before she could be cursed.\n\nAs such, she is the only person who can break the curse and restore the characters' lost memories, aided by her son, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), with whom she has recently reunited (after giving him up for adoption upon his birth), and his book of fairy tales that holds the key to ending the curse. Henry is also the adopted son of Regina (who is the mayor of Storybrooke), providing a source of conflict between the two women.\n\nCast[]\n\nJennifer Morrison as Emma Swan\n\nLana Parrilla as Regina Mills\n\nGinnifer Goodwin as Snow White\n\nJosh Dallas as Prince Charming\n\nRobert Carlyle as Rumplestiltskin\n\nJared Gilmore as Henry Mills\n\nEmilie de Ravin as Belle\n\nColin O'Donoghue as Hook\n\nMichael Socha as Will Scarlet\n\nRaphael Sbarge as Jiminy Cricket\n\nMeghan Ory as Red Riding Hood\n\nSeasons[]\n\nSeason One\n\nSeason Two\n\nSeason Three\n\nSeason Four\n\nSeason Five\n\nSeason Six\n\nSeason Seven\n\nRatings[]\n\nOnce Upon A Time's first season premiered as the top-rated drama series.\n\nThe pilot episode was watched by 13 million viewers and received a 4.0 rating/share among 18- to 49-year-olds.\n\nIt was the season's highest-rated drama debut among the age range and ABC's biggest debut in five years.
