        "text": "This dissertation attempts to prove that the Order of St John made major contributions to the development of Western Medicine that were of the same importance as the progress of the Renaissance and later Eras. The presentation of the state of Western and Eastern medicine prior to the crusades and evaluation of the Order’s main hospitals followed by the traceable influence on Europe after 1291, make up the structure of this work. The methodology comprises the use of structural and building archaeology of two hospital sites, alongside bioarchaeological and ceramic evidence. Critical analysis of primary sources with the archaeology also features where necessary. The main case studies are the Order of St John’s hospitals at Jerusalem and Acre through 1120 to 1291, alongside various examples of institutions in Western Europe and the Levant before and after the Crusades. The result of this work has been the discovery of a majorly over-looked phase of development in Western Medicine caused by the advanced nature of the Order’s Jerusalem and Acre hospitals, which influenced change across Europe.\n\nA leprosarium sited outside the walls of Jerusalem is documented to have been established in the fourth century AD by Aelia Eudoxia. This establishment was located in the fields pertaining to the Church of Saint Mary around the Mount of Olives. This edifice may have been destroyed in the seventh century either as a result of the Persian or the Arab invasions. A new leprosarium annexed to the Church of Saint Stephen was subsequently established by the ninth century. This new establishment was again probably destroyed and abandoned by the 1012 destruction of Christian edifices carried out by the sixth Egyptian Caliph Al-Hakim bi-amr-Allah. A new leprosarium pertaining to the fratres Sancti Lazari was subsequently established outside the walls of Jerusalem by the third decade of the 12th century. It is generally assumed that this establishment was set up in the area between the Gate of Saint Stephen and Tancred’s Tower during the early decades following the First Crusade. The fate of the Jerusalem leprosarium during the eleventh century is unknown since pilgrim travelogues fail to mention any leprosy-directed services in that city. Evidence is presented to show that the hospitali infirmorum sancti Lazari de Jerusalem was extant as a going concern in 1073 – at least six decades before the establishment is assumed to have been set up.\n\nThe Order of Saint Lazarus in Jerusalem was definitely active by the beginning of the second decade of the 12th century. At this point, Jerusalem was considered central to the raison d’etre of the Christian world and hence the Monastic Military Orders active in the Kingdom of Jerusalem established in 1099 attracted the atten-tion and support of European kings, noblemen and various popes. The Order of Saint Lazarus was no exception. The Order quickly acquired benefices enabling it to support the leprosarium inmates, the knights and their entourage in its monastery outside the walls of Jerusalem, and also to undertake military campaigns. The vari-ous donations given generally by the nobiliary and royalty of the Kingdom of Jeru-salem included direct monetary gifts, land holdings, and annual incomes from tithes and taxes. The Order also received donations and benefices in Europe ena-bling it to establish several perceptories in Italy, Hungary, Central Europe [Switzerland, Austria and Germany], France and the Netherlands, England and Scot-land. All these were managed by the Order to further the economic sustenance in the Kingdom of Jerusalem and hence it’s pivotal Crusader and hospitaller role. In the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the economic activities undertaken to further the Order’s income included agricultural activities. These aimed to provide “house-grown” sustenance to the members of the Order and their entourage but also po-tentially obtaining further funds through the sale of surplus. The documented activ-ities included the cultivation and milling of grain and the management of a viticul-ture economy dedicating land holdings to the development of vineyards and the production and sale of wine. The agricultural land appears to have been managed on the Metayage system with a sharecrop agreement with tenants of agricultural centres or Ganges. Other economic activities included eel fishing and possibly can-dle making. Further economic gains were made through participation in military razes through the capture and ransoming of prisoners and by acquiring prizes such as captured cattle and other goods. After the loss of Jerusalem in 1187, the Order lost a significant portion of its land holdings in regions now controlled by the new Islamic rulers. The loss of land with the resulting decrease in income from taxes led to a significant decease in the land and monetary donations from the nobility of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. During the subsequent century, the Order therefore became increasingly dependant on for-eign support derived through the workings of the agricultural holdings of the Order in Europe, direct royal contributions and papal support obtained through the sale of indulgences. The Order of Saint Lazarus, like the rest of the Monastic Military Or-ders in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, were ousted from the Holy Land in 1291 and thus transferred its economic attention to its European perceptories retaining the raison d’etre of caring for the victims of leprosy.\n\nDuring the course of its long history, the Order of St John of Jerusalem has had to make a number of important changes in the way it presented itself, as well as in the aims that it considered to be its major priorities. Throughout the Middle Ages, the Order's identity in Portugal evolved to reflect transformations similar to those that were being introduced at the level of the institution as a whole. The factors that most contributed to this situation were the Order's long history and its broad exposure to the ecclesiastical, monarchic and feudal powers with which it was involved. Thus, after its early beginnings as a provider of support to the poor, sick and injured, the Order gradually began to engage in military activities, above all from the mid-twelfth century onwards, which enabled it to expand its objectives. The agenda of the late mediaeval crusade intensified this process, and its effects in Portugal are clearly confirmed by the documentary evidence. The different manifestations of the Order's identity are to be found both in the building of emblematic monuments at the Hospitallers' key locations and in the construction of the narratives contained in a variety of written documents. Both these monuments and documents highlight the rhetorical strategies employed in the shaping of an institutional identity that, on the one hand, was presented to other contemporary entities, and, on the other hand, has been handed down to us as a memory over time. Marked by the universe of pilgrimage and crusading that was to shape its existence and define the mission that it came to adopt, the Order of the Hospital gradually adapted to the stimuli provided by events occurring in the various places where it was established and deriving from the policies that it developed there. As far as can be gleaned, the Order's ability to adapt to highly different situations and its high prestige, coupled with the continuation of its unique welfare programme, all served to perpetuate its existence."
