During the Crusades they were driven from the Holy Land and established themselves as an order from Cyprus, Rhodes and Malta. The patron saint of the order was Saint John the Baptist. Among other items in their work is the care of leprosy for the natives of Ethiopia, aid to the wounded in Spain and, indeed, the provision of medical organizations of volunteers in all wars. This record of their contribution is a carefully detailed account illustrated with more than a hundred photographs and supplemented with a good bibliography and an index. For nine centuries this organization has rendered distinguished service in the care of the sick. Colonel Hume's account is a fine contribution to the history of Saint John."
