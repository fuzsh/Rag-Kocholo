        "meta_description": "This paper presents a historical and archaeological overview of the castles and other fortifications built and occupied by the Order of the Hospital of St John in the Kingdom of Jerusalem between 1136, when the order acquired the castle of Bayt Jibrīn, and the final Mamluk siege of Acre in 1291, during which it defended a section of the city walls. Topics discussed include the order’s contribution to the defence of towns and cities in which they were not the sole or even the major property owner, as well as their own construction and possession of a range of other fortifications from major castles to lesser structures, including towers and maisons fortes. In each case, equal attention is paid to the buildings themselves and to the administrative system of bailiffs and castellans through which they were managed and operated. As the military situation became ever more precarious during the 13th century, the order also took over and briefly held three major castles, whose owners were unable to defend them: Ascalon between 1241 and 1247, Mount Tabor between 1255 and 1263, and Arsūf between 1261 and 1265.",

By the mid 1120s, however, partly in imitation of the Templars, the order was already beginning to assume military functions and to attract knights into its brotherhood. The order’s military activities soon extended beyond merely protecting its own property or providing sergeant service, as some other ecclesiastical institutions continued to do . Instead, like the Templars, the order began to play an active part in the defence of the kingdom of Jerusalem and of the neighbouring Christian states to the north. In 1136, King Fulk granted the Hospital the newly built castle of Bayt Jibrīn, one of a ring of castles encircling Muslim-held Ascalon. In due course, the Hospitallers developed a network of greater and lesser fortified centres, fulfilling both military and administrative functions.\n\n3 RILEY-SMITH, Jonathan – The Knights Hospitaller in the Levant, c.1070-1309. Basingstoke: Palgrave M (...)\n\n2This paper is concerned with the building works associated with the Hospitallers’ military activities. As a result of the integrated functional organization of the order, however, it is often hard to draw a clear distinction between military and non-military buildings, or even to make a rigid functional classification of them. A castle, for example, might serve a number of military functions, from protecting travellers on the highway to serving as a garrison for troops and contributing to the general defence of the realm; but castles could also – and usually did – serve in other ways as secure centres for administering estates and collecting revenues to support the Hospital’s charitable works, for encouraging Frankish and indigenous Christian settlement of the surrounding lands, and (more especially in the north) for exercising lordship and the administration of justice. Below them in the settlement hierarchy were numbers of smaller fortified towers and other buildings established in agricultural villages or protecting mills, sugar factories or other rural installations. The castles were normally commanded by castellans, who also acted as conventual bailiffs, administering the order’s estates in the region; but exactly how the lower-order sites were managed and who lived in them is often not at all clear. Some appear to have been managed by brother knights, who appear in charters designated by the place where they were stationed; but in other cases it is possible that the occupiers would have been secular estate managers or stewards. The late Jonathan Riley-Smith calculated that at one time or another the Hospitallers would have held 56 strongpoints in Syria and Palestine, 11 of them only for short periods. In 1180, they may have been holding 25, and in 1244 perhaps 29, though most of these would have been relatively small .\n\nContributions to town defence\n\n4 See Riley-Smith, Jonathan – The Knights Hospitaller, pp. 90, 260 n.º 84; cf. PRINGLE, Denys – “The (...)\n\n3In addition to the contribution that the Hospitallers made to the defence of the kingdom through the castles and centres that they managed on their own account, they also contributed to the defence of cities and in some cases castles held by other parties .\n\n5 PAOLI, Sebastiano (ed.) – Codice diplomatico del sacro militare ordine gerosolimitano oggi di Malta(...)\n\n6 CH 1, p. 366, n.ºs. 537-538; RRH, p. 148, n.ºs. 558-559.\n\n7 WILLIAM OF TYRE – Chronicon 21.14 (25).

A rental of c.1157-1163, for example, includes an item of half a bezant paid annually by a woman, perhaps an anchoress, living inside the city wall in the Belcaire district on Mount Sion in the south-western part of the city . In 1178, the Hospital possessed two houses next to the same wall near the ‘new gate’ leading to the church of Mount Sion. William of Tyre also records that after part of the city walls collapsed in 1178, the secular and ecclesiastical authorities agreed to allocate a certain amount of money each year for repairs . This may account for the mention in a contemporary account of the siege of August 1187 of a “new tower, which had been built by the brothers of the Hospital” .\n\n9 CH 1, p. 160, nº. 207; RRH, p. 71, n.º 279; RILEY-SMITH, Jonathan – The Knights of St. John in Jeru (...)\n\n10 Pringle, Denys – The Churches, vol. 1, pp. 286-287; vol. 2, pp. 310-311; cf.

It has previously been suggested that the barbican in question might perhaps have been a predecessor of the Mamluk lower ward on the western side of the castle, in which Paul Deschamps claimed to have detected some traces of earlier Frankish work . A much likelier explanation, however, and one that tallies more convincingly with the topographical indications, is that the grant concerned the castle’s north-eastern tower and a double wall that ran south from it up to a tower adjoining the east end of the castle chapel (Fig. 1) . Like the church of St Mary in al-Shawbak (Montreal), whose entitlement to tithes within the lordship is mentioned in the same document, this chapel would most likely have been served by canons of the Templum Domini, who appear to have had charge of the Latin ecclesiastical establishment in the lordship before the appointment of a bishop of Karak in 1167 . A canon of the Templum Domini, Assenard, appears among the witnesses to the charter and, although the chaplain, Reinard, who was responsible for drafting it, is not similarly identified, it seems likely that he too was a canon and that the tower of St Mary represented the canons’ residence next to the chapel of the same dedication. Maurice’s grant was reconfirmed in 1177 by Renaud de Châtillon, lord of Montreal and Hebron, with the words, “in Karak (Petrac) a house (domus) with its appurtenances (pertinentia), as was given to the Hospital [by Maurice]”, suggesting that the arrangement with the Hospitallers was still in operation at that time . The unstated implication of both charters is that the grantors’ expectation was that the Hospitallers would play their part in maintaining and defending the parts of the castle entrusted to them.\n\n14 William of Tyre–Chronicon 18.12, ed.

According to William of Tyre, Humphrey’s reason was that he was unable to defend Bāniyās without assistance. The terms were that the Hospitallers were to have half of the city and its dependencies (civitas et suburbani) in return for bearing half the expense of defending it. On 26 April, however, as the relief convoy and its escort of knights and footsoldiers approached the city, they fell into an ambush prepared by Nūr al-Dīn’s brother, Nuṣrat al-Dīn Amīr-Mīrān. Most of the escort were killed or taken prisoner and all the provisions lost. Following this the Hospitallers withdrew from their agreement with the constable . The city was attacked twice more by Nūr al-Dīn the same year before falling to him in 1164 . Humphrey of Toron’s initial grant had also included half of Castellum Novum, or Hūnīn, presumably on the same terms; but this arrangement also seems to have been abandoned when the Hospitallers gave up Bāniyās, as there is no further mention of it.\n\n18 CH 1, p. 218, n.º 302; RRH Ad, p. 22, n.º 376b.\n\n19 Pringle, Denys – The Churches, vol. 2, pp. 322-323; cf.

This grant probably comprised the entire southern wall of the city between the Land Castle (Fig. 2) and the sea, along with the gate and barbican facing Tyre, which are also referred to in other charters . The grant was confirmed by Balian, lord of Sidon, in May 1237 . In 1262, however, two years after the sale of the lordship of Sidon to the Templars, the Hospital passed all its possessions in the city to the Templars .\n\n22 Bahāʾ al-Dīn ibn Shaddād – “Al-Nawādir al-Sulṭaniyya wa’l-Maḥāsin al-Yūsufiyya”.

This was so strongly built that when Saladin ordered its demolition in September 1191, it had to be packed with timber and left to burn for over two days before pickaxes would have any effect on it . This tower may have formed part of a sector of the town walls that the Hospitallers had inherited from the Spanish order of Mountjoy at the time of the return of the head of that order, Roderic, to Aragon around 1180, before its amalgamation with the hospital of the Holy Redeemer in Teruel in 1188 . The sector had been granted to the order of Mountjoy between Christmas 1176 and 30 June 1177 by Sibylla, countess of Ascalon, no doubt on the understanding that the order would maintain and defend it. The sector included: “the Tower of the Maidens in the town of Ascalon, and the garden below the tower, and two other towers on the walls of the same town between the previously mentioned tower and the church of St Mary, and another one towards the sea on the other side of the Tower of the Maidens” . This grant was confirmed in similar terms by Pope Alexander III on 15 May 1180 . The stretch of wall concerned would therefore have comprised four mural towers and the intervening curtain walls between the sea and the unlocated church of St Mary. It probably lay on the south side of the city, with its westernmost tower close to and overlooking the sea .\n\n27 CH 1, p. 603, n.º 954; ULKJ 2, pp. 944-947, n.º 572; RRH, pp. 189-190, n.º 709; cf.

In 1207/8 and 1240 there is mention of a bailiff of Jaffa, whom Riley-Smith suggests may have had charge of what remained of the 12th century bailiwick of Spina . In Tyre, sometime between 1198 and 1205, Aimery of Lusignan and Queen Isabella also granted the Hospitallers a gate in the city wall behind their house. Although this faced south on to the sea and was not therefore part of the land wall, it must still have been of some potential economic or military significance, for in June 1270 the Hospital accepted a grant of the village of Maron (Marūn al-Raʾs) and other rights in return for agreeing to wall it up .\n\n30 Pringle, Denys – The Churches, vol. 4, pp. 83-84.\n\n31 Wilbrand of Oldenburg – “Itinerarium”.

V.\n\n10During the 13th century, the Hospitallers made a significant contribution to the defence of the walls of Acre. In 1192 and 1194, King Guy and Henry of Champagne respectively had granted them a block of land for their new headquarters inside the north wall of the city, between the Tower of the Hospital beside Our Lady’s Gate on the east and St John’s Gate on the west, with permission to fortify the latter, though with a royal gatekeeper to control access in and out of it. The grant also included the barbican and outer wall in front of it . Following the enclosure of the Montmusard suburb by a double wall by 1212 , this part of the old north wall would have lost much of its defensive importance; even so, in 1235, the Hospitallers acquired more of it to the west, including the New Gate, which had formerly been called the Tower of the Prison . In 1193, however, Henry of Champagne had also granted them part of the east wall, from the Gate of Geoffrey le Tor northwards to the gate-tower of St Nicolas, including the outer wall, the barbican or lists between the two walls, and land outside the outer wall . Doubtless, like the Teutonic Order, who were given the sector north of this, they would have been expected to maintain and defend it . By 1217, however, following the construction of the new walls around Montmusard, the Hospitallers appear to have relinquished this sector to the Germans and were granted instead the southern sector of the wall of Montmusard between the Gate of Evil Step (Malpas) and the Gate of St Antony. It was through this gate and the Hospitallers’ garden in front of it that Riccardo Filanghieri secretly entered and left the city in 1242 . This sector, marked custodia hospitalis or hospitalariorum on the Vesconte maps of Acre (c.1320), was defended during the Mamluk siege of 1291 by the Hospitallers and the knights of the associated Spanish confraternity of St James .\n\nCastles\n\n37 The Arabic name is derived from the Aramaic Beth Geborīm, ‘house of great men’: PALMER, Edward Henr (...)\n\n38 WILLIAM OF TYRE – Chronicon 24.22, ed.

It was sited in the ruined city of Eleutheropolis, which the Franks mistakenly identified as Beer-sheba , and initially consisted of “a fortress (presidium) strongly fortified with an insuperable wall, outworks and a ditch as well as towers” . When it was finished, Fulk granted the castle to the Hospital. In his confirmation of this grant between September and December 1136 he also added ten casalia given by Hugh (II), the castellan of Hebron, and another four granted directly by the king himself, all of them located in the royal domain of Hebron . Around 1150, Usāma ibn Munqidh took part in an Ascalonite raid on Bayt Jibrīn, where the Egyptians succeeded in burning the Franks’ newly harvested grain but were beaten off by other Franks assembling from nearby fortresses . Egyptian raiding did not end with the fall of Ascalon in 1153 and another attack is recorded in 1158 . Civilians were evidently already settling in Bayt Jibrīn before 1153, and by 1160 they had been granted a charte de peuplement by the Hospitaller master, Raymond du Puy, which was reconfirmed in 1168 and again after 1177 . An un-named castellan is mentioned in 1155 , another named Aimo in 1168 , and a third, Garnier of Nāblus, between 1173 and 1175 . Although in theory Bayt Jibrīn was ceded to the Franks between 1240 and 1244 , there is little evidence for the castle’s reoccupation or for any revival of its castellany .\n\n48 On the castle as a whole, see: KLONER, Amos; COHEN, Miriam – “The Crusader Fortress at Beth Guvrin” (...)\n\n12Excavation of the castle from the 1980s onwards, albeit still mostly unpublished, has revealed that the first phase consisted of a quadriburgium, some 50 m square with solid turrets at the corners (Fig. 3), built over the remains of a Roman bath building. This lay just inside a corner of the late Roman city wall, which formed the north and western sides of an outer enceinte measuring some 170 m east–west by 125 m north–south. It also enclosed the remains of the Roman amphitheatre, which was progressively dismantled for building material as the castle took shape. In a secondary period outer walls, towers and moats were added and the interior was divided into two. In a final Frankish phase, which the excavators date after 1153, the military character of the castle was to some extent compromised by the construction of dwellings, stables and store-rooms in the outer ward and the erection of a conventual church, which doubtless also served the needs of the parish. This was built against the south side of the inner ward and was linked to its refectory at ground level and most probably to the dormitory at first-floor level .\n\n49 CH 1, pp. 188-189, n.º 249; RRH, p. 85, n.º 329.\n\n50 Hiestand, Rudolf – Vorarbeiten zum Oriens Pontificius 2, pp. 222-227, n.º 19; CH 1, pp. 276-279, n.

It lay within an estate in the terra Emaus, centred on Abu Ghosh (Qaryat al-ʿInab, pg 160.134), which the Hospitallers identified as biblical Emmaus and already possessed by 1141, when they reached an agreement with the patriarch over the payment of tithes. William de Bellomonte, who assisted the preceptor and treasurer of the Hospital in a financial transaction in Jerusalem in 1157, would probably have been the castellan ; An un-named castellan is also referred to in 1169 ; and in April 1186 the castellan was Bernard de Asinaria ; who probably succeeded Brother Bartholomew, who is mentioned as bajulus Emaus in February of the same year . In 1187, the castle fell to Saladin, who is alleged to have ordered its demolition in 1191 . Apart from a cache of three English short-cross pennies (1180×1247) , which possibly reached Belmont during the Third Crusade or when the area returned to Frankish control between 1229 and 1244, there is no evidence of Frankish reoccupation and until 1948 the site was occupied by a village .\n\n56 HARPER, Richard-P.; PRINGLE, Denys – Belmont Castle, pp. 43-79, pp. 195-215; PRINGLE, Denys – Secul (...)\n\n14Excavation by the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem between 1986 and 1989 revealed that the earliest phase of the castle consisted of a maison forte, or manor house, constructed on the summit of the hill and remarkably similar in plan to another, also Hospitaller, standing in the valley below it at Aqua Bella (Khirbat ʿIqbalā, pg 162.133) (Fig. 4). It seems likely that the builders of these and another known as Shaykh Ibrahim (pg 162.132), lying a hundred metres south of the castle, were previous tenants rather than the Hospitallers themselves. At any rate, whereas the manor house at Aqua Bella was subsequently converted into what appears to have been a monastic infirmary, by the insertion of an apse and chancel screen into its hall, the one at Belmont was instead developed into a castle by adding a polygonal outer enceinte with an external talus and gatehouse on the south-east, enclosing vaulted ranges including stables .\n\n57 CH 1, pp. 271-272, n.º 398; RRH, pp. 116-117, n.º 448.\n\n58 Abū Shāmā – “Le livre des deux jardins”.Ed. and trans.

Walter of Tiberias’s confirmation of the sale of this to the Hospital for 1,400 bezants by Ivo Velos, issued in April 1168, described it as castrum de Coquet, quod vulgariter Belvear nuncupatur, cum suis divisis et pertinentiis , making it clear that a castle of some kind already existed. The concentric castle that the Hospitallers built over the next twenty years is discussed elsewhere in this volume, so there is no need to say much about it here. After the castle’s surrender to Saladin on 5 January 1189 , however, it was repaired and continued to be garrisoned for another thirty years until 1219, when it was demolished by al-Muʿaẓẓam ʿĪsā . Although the area was returned to Frankish hands between 1241 and 1263 and the Hospital reached an agreement with the archbishop of Nazareth over its tithes on 25 October 1259 , there does not appear to be any evidence to indicate that it was ever reoccupied or refortified.

He was followed by Alebaudus, castellanus Belviderii in 1184 , and Monterius, castellanus de Belveeir in April 1185 . Among the witnesses to the sale of Margat castle to the Hospital on 1 February 1186 was Brother Hermann, a former castellan of Crac des Chevaliers , who is described in the charter as tunc temporis Betanhie bajulus . It is usually assumed that this official was commander or bailiff of Bethany, between Jerusalem and Jericho . From 1138, however, Bethany had been in the possession of the Benedictine nuns of St Lazarus and it is difficult to see how a Hospitaller commandery could have been accommodated there at the same time . Bayt Ḥanīnā, another village near Jerusalem that is also referred to as Betania, seems no more plausible, as it had been granted to the nearby Premonstratensian abbey of St Samuel on Mount Joy, also in the reign of Fulk (1131-43) . A likelier identification is Baysān (Bet Sheʿan, pg 197.211), ancient Scythopolis and the former metropolitan see of Galilee, which is referred to in Frankish sources variously as Bethsan, Baisan, Beisan and Bezan, but also as Bethan and Bethania. In 1103, for example, Pope Paschal II confirmed to the abbey of Mount Tabor four villages in terra Bettanie (or Bethanie) . Gustav Beyer took this to refer to Batanaea, the ancient name for the region east of the Jawlān in Transjordan, which in medieval times gave its name to al-Bathaniyya, a district of Damascus . Two or possibly three of the four listed villages, however, appear to have been located west of the Jordan between Tiberias and Baysān, albeit not necessarily in what later became the lordship of Baysān itself . In 1173, King Amalric also granted two villages in partibus Bethan, Shaykh Riḥāb (Rehap, pg 197.206) and Bardala (Ardelle, pg 195.199), along with their villani and sugar plantations, to the German Hospital in Jerusalem . These also lay on the west bank of the Jordan, just south of Baysān. In 1186, following the death of Adam of Baysān leaving only minors as heirs, the lordship would have been in the wardship of Hugh, son of Hugh lord of Byblos (Gibelin), who in November 1179 had leased it for seven years to Joscelin, former count of Edessa, for 600 bezants annually . In 1183, however, the town of Baysān, which William of Tyre describes as no more than a castle and small township surrounded by marshes, was abandoned by its few remaining inhabitants just before being sacked by Saladin . There is no evidence that the Hospitallers subsequently had any role in administering the lordship or even that they themselves possessed any land in Baysān itself, although they had acquired al-Zarraʿa (Assera, Adera, pg 199.203) within the lordship in 1149 . It seems quite possible, however, that just as the bailiff of Emmaus, named in the same document, may be identified as the castellan of Belmont, the bailiff of Baysān was none other than the castellan of Belvoir, in both cases a more familiar biblical name being substituted for one that was less easily recognizable.\n\n78 CH 1, pp. 183-184, n.º 244; RRH, p. 82, n.º 321; cf.

This was also referred to in 1156 as Castellum Beleismum and may be identified with Khirbat Balʿāma (biblical Jibleam, Belemōth, pg 177.205), situated at the border of the lordship of Nāblus with the principality of Galilee, where the road south from Jinīn to Sebaste entered the Sahl ‘Arrāba, known to medieval writers as the Plain of Dothan . It was here that Guy of Lusignan and Raymond of Tripoli were reconciled in 1187, following the disastrous battle with the Muslims at the Springs of the Cresson. The account in the Chronique d’Ernoul specifies that this castle belonged to the Hospitallers. The remains, sited on a largely natural tell to the west of the road, consist of a tower some 8 m square standing in the south wall of a rectangular enclosure, some 60 m east–west by 40 m north–south, with rows of rooms along the eastern and western sides. On the east side of the mound beside the road remains of a chapel stand over a barrel-vault some 3 m wide, leading to a spring known as that of St Job (Biʾir al-Sinjīb) . There is no record of any estate or castellan attached to the castle, though it is possible that it functioned merely a road-station for pilgrims and other travellers, administered from the order’s hospital in Nāblus .\n\nLesser sites, towers and maisons fortes\n\n82 Pringle, Denys – Secular Buildings, p. 41, pl.

Among the properties forming part of the estate granted to the Hospital along with the castle of Bayt Jibrīn in 1136 was Bayt Sūr (Bethsura), between Hebron and Bethlehem, where there are still remains of a Frankish tower (Burj al-Sūr, pg 159.110) . Sites dependent on Belmont Castle include the church and estate centre at Abu Ghosh (Qaryat al-ʿInāb, Emmaus, pg 160.134) and the manor house or infirmary building at Aqua Bella (Khirbat ʿIqbalā, pg 162.133), neither of which could be described as primarily a military work, despite their basic defensibility . The fortified site of al-Taiyiba (medieval ʿAfarbalā, Forbelet, pg 174.151), however, which seems to have depended on Belvoir Castle and whose remains include a tower some 26 m square (Fig. 5), has a more obviously defensive character . William of Tyre described the place in 1182-3 simply as a vicus or locus . but Arabic accounts refer to it as a ḥiṣn or fortress . Although recent archaeological work in the vicinity of the tower has done much to extend our understanding of the settlement from the Byzantine period to late Ottoman times, the precise nature and extent of the Frankish fortifications has still to be determined .\n\n88 Riley-Smith, Jonathan – The Knights Hospitaller, pp. 179-180.\n\n89 CH 1, pp. 21-22, n.º 29; pp. 172-173, n.º 225 (1154); ULKJ 1, pp. 165-168, n.º 42; pp. 424-427, n.º (...)\n\n90 TAFEL, Gottlieb Lucas Friedrich; THOMAS, Georg Martin (eds.) – Urkunden zur älteren Handels- und St (...)\n\n91 SHAKED, Idit – “Identifying the Medieval Flour Mills at Doq and Recordane”.

Near Jerusalem, such properties would have included the village of Bayt Ṣafafa (Bethafava, pg 160.128), which Baldwin I gave to the Hospital sometime before September 1110. Here there still stand the remains of a two-storey tower, some 18.2 by 13.7 m, at one time associated with a rectangluar enclosure wall with an outer talus, enclosing vaulted structures . Just outside Tyre, the village of Burj al-Shamālī (pg 172.126) contains a tower linked to a barrel-vault (Figs. 6-7), which may perhaps be la Tor de l’Ospital that was among the ten casalia conceded to Margaret, lady of Tyre, by Sultan al-Manṣūr Qalāwūn in 1285 . Sites in the territory of Acre would have included the mill of Kurdāna, of which only fragmentary remains survive (pg 1610.2501) , and the estate centre and sugar mill of Manawāt (Ḥorvat Manot, pg 164.271) , whose fief the Hospitallers purchased from Nicolas, grandson of Sait the Scribe, for 1,400 bezants in September 1231 , having previously acquired the rights there belonging to John of Brienne and Maria la Marquise in April 1212 , and those of Beatrice of Hennenberg, daughter of Joscelin III of Courtenay, in January 1218 .\n\n96 Pringle, Denys – The Churches, vol. 1, p. 180.\n\n97 Cf.

One possible location for a commandery in the south of the lordship was Qalansuwa (Calansue, pg 148.187), a casale granted to the Hospital by the knight Geoffrey of Flujeac in April 1128 . However, it appears that the lords of Caesarea retained control of the place, since a viscount, Peter de Fossato, and a dominus Paganus de Calenzun are recorded in 1166 , and Frankish settlers were living there during the time when Raymond du Puy was master (1125-58) . Potential Hospitaller commanders of Qalansuwa include Gerard, or Gerald (1131-35), and Simon (1207/8) . The architectural remains include an early tower, a large eight-bayed two-storey hall building (now the mosque) (Fig. 8) and various vaults set around a central open space.

By September 1110, the Hospitallers possessed lands and villeins there and when Walter Garnier issued a confirmation of all their possessions in the lordship in September 1131 they also had some houses. The mention among the witneses to the latter document of a Hospitaller brother named Aldebrandus Chaco suggests that by that time they may also have been using the village as an administrative centre . The Hospitallers continued to acquire properties in the area and by 1189 were leasing from the abbey of St Mary Latin two other villages with existing small castles, Madd al-Dayr (Montdidier, pg 141.196) and Burj al-Aḥmar (Turris Rubea, Turris Latinae, pg 145.191), as well as further land in Qāqūn. During the period of Saladin’s conquest and the Third Crusade, these properties came into the hands of the Templars, but although the abbey undertook to restore them to the Hospital in May 1236, it appears that the lease was not finally reinstated until August 1248 . Both castles consisted of a tower set within an enclosure, though it remains uncertain what, if anything, the Hospitallers themselves may have contributed to them .\n\n107 Pringle, Denys – The Churches, vol. 4, pp. 241-245, figs. 20-21, pls CXV-CXVI; PRINGLE, Denys – Sec (...)\n\n108 CH 1, pp. 421-422, n.º 621; DELAVILLE LE ROULX, Joseph – “Inventaire”, p. 67, n.º 147; RRH, p. 164, (...)\n\n109 CH 2, p. 776, n.º 2725 (1255); RRH, pp. 324-325, n.º 1233; cf.

Excavations in 1999 indicate that in the Frankish period the fort’s interior was occupied by village houses but that a small chapel was built against the outer face of the west wall sometime in the 13th century, though who was responsible for it is unclear . To the south of this, Burj al-Maliḥ (al-Mallūḥa, Turris Salinarum, pg 141.216), which Hugh, lord of Caesarea had granted the Hospital between c.1154 and 1168, was destroyed by Baybars in 1265 . There was another tower at Khirbat al-Mazraʿa (le Meseraa, casale Rogerii de Chasteillon, pg 143.222), which John Lalaman, lord of Caesarea, sold to the Hospitallers in 1255; but this village would have been theirs for no more than a decade .\n\n110 Riley-Smith, Jonathan – The Knights Hospitaller, p. 260, n.º 91.\n\n111 BRESC-BAUTIER, Geneviève (ed.) – Le Cartulaire du chapitre du Saint-Sépulcre de Jérusalem.

Sometime before 1168, Bartholomew, the lord of the town or village (ville dominus), granted some property in Qalqīliyya to the Holy Sepulchre ; but Geoffrey (Gaufridus) de Qualquelia, who witnessed a Hospitaller charter in April 1168, appears to have been a vassal of John, lord of Arsūf, rather than a member of the order , as was his descendent John de Cauquelie, who was listed as such in 1241 and 1261 . On the other hand, Brother Hugh de Calcalia, who is mentioned in witness lists between 1181 and 1185 , was certainly a Hospitaller; but in view of the lack of any other Hospitaller connection with Qalqīliyya, his name more likely reflects his family origins than an administrative position.\n\n115 CH 1, pp. 238-239, n.º 340 (1165); p. 245, n.º 354 (1166); RRH, p. 109, n.º 419; p. 110, n.º 423; D (...)\n\n116 CH 1, pp. 491-496, n.º 783; RRH, pp. 171-172, n.º 649.\n\n117 CH 1, p. 199, n.º 263; RRH, p. 85, n.º. 330; PRINGLE, Denys – Secular Buildings, pp. 9293, fig. 1.

A preceptor of Spina named Oldinus Rollant witnessed grants by Baldwin of Mirabel to the Hospital in 1165 and 1166; by 1173 he was castellan of Belvoir . Brother Raynald, bajulus Spine, witnessed Bohemond III of Antioch’s ratification of the granting of Valania and Margat to the Hospital on 1 February 1186 . The precise location of Spina is uncertain. The only clue is a charter of 25 January 1158/59, by which Hugh of Ibelin ceded to the Hospital some land located between the mills of Mirabel and the land of Spina . Gustav Beyer identified these mills with those whose remains still survive at al-Mirr (Maḥmūdiyya, pg 142.168) on the Nahr al-ʿAwjāʾ (River Yarqon) below Raʾs al-ʿAyn and suggested three possibile identifications for Spina itself: Fajja (Fijja, pg 140.166), Nabī Thārī (pg 143.163) and Khirbat Shaʿīra (pg 140.164) . None of these names, however, appears to have any connection with the word spina, meaning ‘thorn’ or ‘thistle’, the Arabic equivalent of which, shawk , is found in place names such as Shuwayka (pg 153.193), a village near Ṭulkarm . The medieval name for Nabī Thārī is unknown, the present Arabic one evidently being derived from a maqām built on the site in late Mamluk to early Ottoman times . Excavations around this between 1996 and 2000, however, revealed extensive remains of buildings of the Abbasid, Frankish and Mamluk periods . This evidence, as well as its situation on the main road between Raʾs al-ʿAyn and Lydda, make Nabī Thārī a prime candidate to identify with Spina, though conclusive proof is still lacking .\n\n125 CH 1, pp. 86-87, n.º 97 (1133); pp. 166-168, n.º 217 (1153); RRH, p. 37, n.º 147; RRH Ad, pp. 18-19 (...)\n\n126 CH 2, pp. 590-591, n.º 2274; p. 592, n.º 2277; RRH, p. 286, n.º 1100.\n\n127 CLERMONT-GANNEAU, Charles – “Les trois ponts, Jorgilia and le Toron de la fille de Comar”.

These were known as the Mills of the Three Bridges (pg 134.168), because it was there that the Jaffa to Jaljūliyya and Arsūf to Raʾs al-ʿAyn roads crossed the confluence of the ʿAwjāʾ with the Nahr Abū Lajja and Nahr al-Ashkar. The mills and the “island” between the rivers were granted to the Hospitallers by Hugh of Jaffa in 1133 ; and in 1241, John III of Arsūf sold them the adjacent northern area lying within his lordship .

When the Hospitallers acquired the village of ʿAbūd (pg 156.158) from Baldwin of Mirabel in 1167, it was described as casale quod appellatur S. Mariae, contiguum territorium Bellifortis . This has allowed Belforte to be identified with the present-day village of Dayr Abū Mashʿal (pg 156.156), where remains of a walled enclosure some 45 m square but of uncertain date were noted in the 19th century at the highest part of the site (Fig. 9) . On 29 April 1166, Baldwin of Mirabel also confirmed his grant to the Hospitallers for their hospital in Nāblus of various properties and rights within his lordship, including the second tithes from Mirabel, Sūsiyya, Marescalcia (Dayr Abū Mashʿal?) , Casreherre (Kafr al-Dīk?) and Rantiyya (Rentie, pg 142.161); however, although a Frankish-period vault or bawbariyya still survives in Rantiyya, it is unlikely to have belonged to the Hospitallers, as there is no evidence that they possessed any land there . Riley-Smith plausibly suggests that in the 13th century what remained of the estates of Spina would have been administered by the commander of Jaffa .\n\nThe final years of the Kingdom\n\n137 PRINGLE, Denys – “The Survey of the Walls of Ashkelon”, pp. 116-124, pp. 190-193, pp. 220-221, figs (...)\n\n28In the final decades of the kingdom of Jerusalem the Hospitallers were sometimes granted entire castles and lordships that no-one else was able or prepared to take on. In April 1244, for example, they were handed the newly built castle in Ascalon by the emperor Frederick II’s bailiff, Thomas of Acerra. Construction of this had been started in the summer of 1240 by Tibald, king of Navarre and count of Champagne, and Hugh IV, duke of Burgundy, and was brought to completion by Richard, earl of Cornwall, in April 1241. According to Richard’s own account, it was built of ashlar reinforced with cut-up marble columns and included high towers and outworks, enclosed by a double wall and ditch. Archaeological research shows that it lay in the north-western corner of the city, with the town wall on the north and the sea cliffs on the west. Under the terms of the agreement, the Hospitallers were to do their best to hold and defend the castle, on the understanding that the emperor would reimburse their expenses, whether or not they were successful. As things turned out the castle was besieged by the Ayyubids from October 1246 and was taken by storm almost exactly a year later in October 1247. For the next ten years, the Hospitallers doggedly pursued their claim for compensation from the new count of Jaffa and Ascalon, John of Ibelin, but apparently without any success .\n\n138 Matthew Paris – Chronica Majora.

On 1 April 1255, Pope Alexander IV granted the Benedictine abbey and its estates to the Hospitallers, on the understanding that so long as peace held they would build there a fortress within ten years, garrisoned by forty knights . The intention here was clearly to recommission the Ayyubid fortress that had been built around the abbey in 1212 and slighted by al-Muʿaẓẓam ʿĪsā in 1218 . By end of June 1255, Mount Tabor was already in the Hospitallers’ hands and their castellan, Jocelmus of Tornell, was taking formal possession of nearby villages . There is no mention of any garrison, but if the castle had been built and garrisoned with a similar proportion of knights to other ranks to that applied by the Templars at Safad in 1260, the 40 knights stipulated by the pope would imply an intended total garrison of around 1,360, including some 24 sergeants, 40 turcopoliers, 240 archers, 656 workmen and 320 slaves or impressed workers . In May 1256, three of the former monks of Mount Tabor wrote to Pope Alexander IV, commending to him the efforts that the Hospitallers were making and noting that, although the site had not yet been fortified, it was already garrisoned by a quantity of armed knights, as were some of its casalia, the divine offices were once again being celebrated there and every day it was being visited by pilgrims . There is no evidence, however, that any of its fortifications were actually rebuilt before Baybars destroyed the church and monastery in April 1263 .\n\n145 CH 3, pp. 1-2, n.º 2972; pp. 60-61, n.º 3047; pp. 74-75, n.º 2071 (1263); RRH, p. 343, n.º 1313; RR (...)\n\n146 CH 3, pp. 6-7, n.º 2985; RRH, p. 241, n.º 1302.\n\n147 Philip of Novara – Guerra, §124 (220), ed.

A list of the vassals who owed Balian service and what the Hospital was obliged to pay them was drawn up on 1 May 1261 . The castle dated initially from the 12th century and was sited on the cliff edge at the northern end of the site (Fig. 10); but its defences had been completely overhauled by John of Ibelin, lord of Arsūf, from 1241 onwards . The new works included a twin-towered gatehouse with a portcullis and timber doors, which projected from the leading edge of a polygonal curtain wall with rounded mural towers, enclosing the earlier domestic part of the castle, including a new rib-vaulted first-floor chapel. The curtain was enclosed by an apron wall with rounded bastions rising from the bottom of a deep wide counterscarped ditch crossed by a timber bridge. When built in the 1240s and 1250s, this would have been a very up-to-date design by European standards . The recent excavations by the late Israel Roll and Oren Tal have shown what preparations the Hospitallers made for the siege. They included adding a tower to the south-east corner of the town wall and contructing earthen ramparts supporting a 15 m wide fighting platform behind the south wall of the town . In the castle the south-east tower was partly dismantled to allow easier access to the outer wall overlooking the moat and the chapel was reinforced, taluses being added to the two corners facing the courtyard. Other changes, such as modifications to the interior of the gatehouse and the adaptation of parts of the castle for food storage and cooking were concerned more with the domestic needs of the hugely augmented garrison than with improving its physical defensibility. The siege lasted from mid March to 29 April 1265, after which the castle was demolished . The Hospitallers’ lease, however, was only finally terminated in 1269 . Thus was lost the Hospitallers’ last major castle in the Kingdom of Jerusalem and their last major house outside Acre and Tyre.\n\nPrinted Sources\n\n“Annales de Terre Sainte”. In EDBURY, P.W.
