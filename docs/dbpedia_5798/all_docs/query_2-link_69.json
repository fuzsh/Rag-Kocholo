        "text": "The Israeli military intensified airstrikes in Gaza including near its largest hospital, and another hospital was damaged by bombardment close by. Thousands of people desperate for food and basic items broke into aid warehouses in the besieged enclave.\n\nWATCH: ‘No safe place’ for Palestinians in Gaza as Israel steps up ground operations\n\nInternet and phone connectivity were restored for many people on Sunday after Israeli strikes had knocked out most communications in the territory late Friday.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Saturday a “second stage” in the 3-week-old war and said Israel is determined to bring back 229 hostages taken by the militant group during its deadly Oct. 7 incursion. Four of the hostages have been released.\n\nThe Palestinian death toll passed 8,000, most of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza. In the occupied West Bank, more than 110 Palestinians have been killed in violence and Israeli raids, and on Sunday, a Jewish settler fatally shot a Palestinian man harvesting olives near the city of Nablus.\n\nMore than 1,400 people died in Israel during a surprise incursion by Hamas, including at least 310 soldiers, according to the Israeli government.\n\nHere’s what is happening in the latest Israel-Hamas war:\n\n8:43 p.m. EDT\n\nGaza water shortage forces Palestinians to bathe and wash clothes in the sea\n\nOn a beach in Gaza, a young boy hunches over a plastic tub full of soapy water and laundry. Nearby, a woman uses sand to clean metal pots and pans. A man stands waist-deep in the sea cleaning a pair of sweatpants, while elsewhere, three women sit in the salty Mediterranean and let the lapping waves rinse their dresses.\n\nThe besieged Gaza Strip’s 2.3 million people don’t have access to clean, running water after Israel cut off water and electricity to the enclave. If water does trickle from the tap, residents have said it’s so contaminated with sewage and seawater that it’s undrinkable. Under these circumstances, some are forced to use the sea to bathe, wash clothes and clean their cookware.\n\nOn Sunday, 33 trucks carrying water, food and medicine entered the only border crossing from Egypt. Israel said it has opened two water lines in southern Gaza within the past week. The AP could not independently verify that either line was functioning.\n\n6:50 p.m. EDT\n\nClashes on Israel’s northern border with Lebanon and Syria\n\nThe Israeli military struck targets in Lebanon and Syria on Sunday after projectiles were fired into Israel.\n\nClashes have been taking place across Israel’s tense border with Lebanon since the onset of the Hamas-Israel war, mostly contained to several border towns.\n\nBut on Sunday, rockets were fired from Syria as well, falling into open Israeli territory, the military said. It fired back at the site where the rockets were launched.\n\nIsrael’s military also provided video of multiple strikes inside Lebanon, showing explosions erupting among trees and missiles hitting a building on a hillside. The military said it shot down a drone and killed a militant who tried to approach the border fence.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Hamas said its forces in Lebanon had fired 16 missiles at the northern Israeli town of Nahariya. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, also announced it had fired missiles at several sites across the border Sunday afternoon, including one that it said had hit an Israeli infantry unit near the town of Birket Risha and caused “confirmed injuries.”\n\nCrowd storms Russian airport to protest flight from Israel\n\nRussian news agencies and social media say hundreds of people have stormed into the main airport in the Dagestan region and onto the landing field to protest the arrival of an airliner from Tel Aviv.\n\nAuthorities closed the airport in Makhachkala, capital of the predominantly Muslim region, and police converged on the facility. There were no immediate reports of injuries or arrests.\n\nRussian news reports said people in the crowd were shouting antisemitic slogans and tried to storm the airliner belonging to Russian carrier Red Wings that had landed from Tel Aviv.\n\nIn a statement released Sunday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel “expects the Russian law enforcement authorities to protect the safety of all Israeli citizens and Jews wherever they may be and to act resolutely against the rioters and against the wild incitement directed against Jews and Israelis.”\n\nNetanyahu’s office added that the Israeli ambassador to Russia was working with Russia to keep Israelis and Jews safe.\n\nJournalists in Lebanon were ‘explicitly targeted’ in deadly strike near Israeli border, report says\n\nBEIRUT — An analysis of video evidence and witness testimonies from the scene of strikes that killed one journalist and injured six others in south Lebanon this month found that the journalists were “explicitly targeted,” the watchdog group Reporters Without Borders said in a statement Sunday.\n\nReuters journalist Issam Abdallah was killed near the village of Alma al-Shaab while covering an exchange of fire along the border between Israeli troops and members of Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group.\n\nREAD MORE: Reuters journalist killed by Israeli shelling on Lebanon border that wounds 6 others\n\n“Two strikes in the same place in such a short space of time … from the same direction, clearly indicate precise targeting,” the statement said.\n\nThe analysis found that journalists had been standing and filming on a hillside for more than an hour until the strikes hit about 37 to 38 seconds apart, both coming from the east — the direction of the Israeli border. The first killed Abdallah; the second hit a vehicle belonging to an Al Jazeera team, injuring journalists standing next to it, the statement said. It noted that the journalists were wearing helmets and vests marked “press,” and the car was marked “press” on the roof.\n\nIt added that witnesses reported seeing an Israeli helicopter fly over the scene shortly before the strikes. The report did not specifically say Israel was responsible for the fire, saying the investigation was ongoing.\n\nThe Israeli military did not immediately respond Sunday to a request for comment on the analysis.\n\nMilitary spokesperson Lt. Col. Richard Hecht previously said Israel was “looking into” the episode. He did not confirm whether the journalists had been hit by Israeli shelling.\n\nRed Cross aid convoy reaches hospital in southern Gaza for first time\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip — A convoy of International Committee of the Red Cross aid trucks arrived at the overcrowded Nasser hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis Sunday, bringing vital medical supplies to emergency departments and operation rooms.\n\n“This is the first aid convoy that reached Nasser medical complex though the Red Cross association,” said Dr. Nahed Abu Taemma, the hospital’s director. Doctors at the hospital say that apart from the many wounded, the building is also serving as shelter for thousands of civilians.\n\n“The most important thing in these shortages is anesthesia, devices to fix bones, ICU devices,” all of which are in short supply, he said.\n\nThe ICRC has said that 10 staff members, including a surgery team, crossed into Gaza via the Rafah border crossing on Friday.\n\nGaza aid worker describes intense Israeli bombardment during communication blackout\n\nCAIRO — An aid worker in northern Gaza said they witnessed “the most vicious attacks” by Israel during about two days of communication blackout.\n\nGaza residents spent two anxious nights amid relentless bombardment and rumors that Israel had begun its large-scale ground invasion.\n\nMahmoud Shalabi, senior program manager with Medical Aid for Palestinians, who lives in Beit Lahia said his young daughter was terrified by a massive explosion close to their home.\n\n“She started screaming and frantically, hysterically crying,” he said. “I hugged her.”\n\nShalabi rushed outside to find out his neighbor’s house was bombed. At least 10 people were killed, including women and children, and many others were wounded, he said.\n\n“The fear I saw in the eyes of the people in my neighborhood is full of the color gray,” he said. “I hate the color gray.”\n\nWar victims deserve justice, says ICC prosecutor\n\nBEIRUT — The International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor said Sunday that people caught in the ongoing Hamas-Israel war since Oct. 7 deserve justice.\n\nKarim Khan at a press conference at the Rafah border crossing in Egypt expressed concern about the devastation and strikes that have taken place near churches, schools, and hospitals. Khan said wasn’t able to enter the Gaza Strip and speak to Palestinians.\n\nHe called on Israel to respect international law but stopped short of accusing Israel of committing war crimes.\n\n“They have lawyers, advisors, and they will be under no misapprehension after their obligations,” he said, adding that these obligations apply to Palestinian militant group Hamas as well. He called Hamas’ surprise attack a serious violation of international humanitarian law.\n\nThe ICC has been investigating the actions of both Israeli and Palestinian authorities since 2014.\n\n3:48 p.m. EDT\n\nPalestinian Red Crescent says Israeli strikes damaged parts of a Gaza hospital\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent Society said Israeli strikes Sunday damaged sections in the jam-packed Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City, after receiving two phone calls from the Israeli military to evacuate.\n\nA video the Red Crescent posted on X, formerly Twitter, of the hospital following the strikes shows rooms covered in debris and dust and the windows blown out. People covered their noses and mouths, panicking as they tried to leave the hospital with their children.\n\nThe PRCS-run hospital administration said that evacuating the hospital was impossible, as its hundreds of patients included children in incubators and wounded people in the intensive-care unit. In a statement, it said many of the 14,000 people seeking shelter there are Palestinians displaced by the ongoing Hamas-Israel war.\n\nIsraeli strikes targeted areas around the hospital throughout Sunday. The director-general of the World Health Organization said that it would be “impossible” to evacuate hospitals without endangering people’s lives.\n\n12:50 p.m. EDT\n\nIsrael says it killed Hamas militants near Erez crossing\n\nIsrael’s military said Sunday that ground forces killed a number of Hamas militants as they were exiting a tunnel near the Erez crossing, which used to be the sole pedestrian passageway out of the coastal enclave into Israel before it was destroyed in the fighting. It was unclear how many militants were killed by Israeli forces.\n\nVideos of the ground operation released by the military showed tanks traversing small, sandy hills and bulldozers clearing mountains of debris. Hamas has a sprawling network of tunnels underneath Gaza where it is believed to be stockpiling weapons, food, and other supplies.\n\nICC chief prosecutor visits Egypt-Gaza border\n\nThe chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, visited the Rafah crossing point between Egypt and Gaza on Sunday, a senior Egyptian official said.\n\nThe official said Khan inspected the crossing and briefed on the damage caused by Israeli airstrikes to the Palestinian side. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief media.\n\nKhan’s office has opened an investigation into potential war crimes by Israel in Gaza in the 2014 war. He is scheduled to talk about his trip to the Egyptian border with Gaza in a news conference in Cairo Sunday evening.\n\nNumber of children killed in the conflict soars\n\nThe number of children killed in the blockaded Gaza Strip since the start of the Hamas-Israel earlier this month has exceeded the number of children killed in armed conflict every year globally since 2019, international charity Save the Children said Sunday.\n\nIn a statement, the charity cited numbers from the Gaza Health Ministry of at least 3,195 children killed in the war that was sparked following a surprised Hamas attack on Oct. 7. It also mentioned the deaths of 33 children in the occupied West Bank and 29 children killed in Israel.\n\n“The numbers are harrowing and with violence not only continuing but expanding in Gaza right now, many more children remain at grave risk,” Save the Children Country Director in the occupied Palestinian territory Jason Lee said in a statement. “One child’s death is one too many, but these are grave violations of epic proportions. A cease-fire is the only way to ensure their safety.”\n\nUN secretary-general reiterates call for humanitarian cease-fire\n\nU.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has warned that “the world is witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe taking place before our eyes” in Gaza, with over two million people denied the essentials of life and subjected to relentless bombardment,\n\n“I urge all those with responsibility to step back from the brink,” he told reporters at a meeting with Nepal’s prime minister in Kathmandu on Sunday. “We must join forces to end this nightmare for the people of Gaza, Israel and all those affected around the world.”\n\nThe U.N. chief reiterated his appeal for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire, the unconditional release of all hostages and delivery of aid at scale to Gaza.\n\nGuterres again condemned Hamas’ “appalling attacks” on Israel on Oct. 7, stressing that “there is no justification, ever, for the killing, injuring and abduction of civilians.”\n\nThe secretary-general reiterated that all parties to conflict are required under international humanitarian laws to protect civilians and provide them with food, water, medicine and other essentials, stressing that “those laws cannot be contorted for the sake of expedience.”\n\n“The number of civilians who have been killed and injured is totally unacceptable,” Guterres said.\n\n11:44 a.m. EDT\n\nIsrael drops leaflets on Gaza, asking civilians to surrender\n\nIsrael’s military, which has said repeatedly that it is not at war with civilians in Gaza but rather with Hamas, dropped leaflets on the Gaza Strip Sunday asking civilians to “surrender.” Written in Arabic, the leaflets told civilians to lay down all their weapons, put their hands up, wave white flags and follow instructions from the Israeli military.\n\n“Hamas leaders are exploiting you” the flyers read, “They and their families are in safe places, while you die in vain.”\n\nBritish prime minster, French president discuss aid for Gaza, security\n\nLONDON — British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s office says he has spoken to French President Emmanuel Macron about the importance of getting urgent humanitarian support into Gaza and maintaining regional security following the expansion of Israel’s military operation against Hamas.\n\nThe leaders “agreed to work together on efforts both to get crucial food, fuel, water and medicine to those who need it, and to get foreign nationals out,” Downing Street said in a statement Sunday,\n\n“They expressed their shared concern at the risk of escalation in the wider region, in particular in the West Bank. The Prime Minister and President Macron updated on the conversations they have had with leaders in the region to stress the importance of working to ensure regional stability.”\n\nSunak and Macron agreed that it was important not to lose sight of the long-term future of the region and, in particular, the need for a two-state solution, the statement said.\n\n“They underscored that Hamas does not represent ordinary Palestinians and that their barbarism should not undermine the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people.”\n\nA UN peacekeeper is wounded in southern Lebanon\n\nBEIRUT — The U.N. mission in Lebanon says one peacekeeper was lightly wounded after his base in the country’s south was hit by a mortar shell.\n\nThe militant group Hezbollah, Hamas’ allies in Lebanon, has clashed with Israeli troops along the Lebanon-Israeli border since the Gaza war erupted on Oct. 7. The skirmishes have remained relatively contained and mostly along a handful of border towns.\n\nThe two mortar shells hit a UNIFEL base near the southeastern border village of Houla, the U.N. mission said. The wounded peacekeeper suffered minor injuries and is in stable condition. Earlier Saturday, a shell hit UNIFIL’s headquarters in the southern coastal town of Naqoura, but there was no mention of injuries.\n\nUNIFIL did not specify where the shelling came from, and said that they were investigating both incidents.\n\nUNIFIL was created to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon after a 1978 invasion. The mission was expanded after the 2006 war, allowing peacekeepers to deploy along the Lebanon-Israel border to help Lebanese troops extend their authority into their country’s south for the first time in decades.\n\nThe pope calls for a cease-fire and release of hostages\n\nVATICAN CITY — Pope Francis repeatedly called for a cease-fire in Gaza on Sunday.\n\n“Let’s continue to pray for Ukraine and for the serious situation in Palestine and Israel and for other regions with wars,” Francis said.\n\n“In particular, in Gaza, leave space to guarantee humanitarian aid. And let the hostages be freed immediately. Let no one abandon the possibility to stop the arms. Cease fire,” he added, speaking from the window of the Apostolic Palace above St. Peter’s Square.\n\nThe pope cited the Rev. Ibrahim Faltas, the vicar of the Holy Land, as joining him in the urgent plea for a cease-fire.\n\n“Stop yourselves brothers and sisters, war is always defeat. Always! Always!” he concluded.\n\nNorway’s prime minister criticizes Israel\n\nHELSINKI — Norway’s prime minister says Israel’s reaction to Hamas’ attack exceeds the rules of international law on proportionality.\n\n“It says in international law that (reaction to such an attack) must be proportionate,” Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre told public broadcaster NRK in an interview on Sunday.\n\n“Civilians must be taken into account, and humanitarian law is fully aware of that. I believe that the line has now been far exceeded” by Israel, he said, adding that his primary concern is that emergency aid is not getting into the Gaza Strip.\n\nNorway on Friday voted in favor of the United Nations resolution calling for a “humanitarian truce” leading to a cessation of hostilities in Gaza.\n\n“It’s a catastrophic situation, and I believe it is clearly in violation of what we call the rules of war or humanitarian law,” he said. “Many fear that the escalation we are now seeing could ignite a much bigger conflict in the region, and obviously a much more lasting conflict.”\n\nGaza Health Ministry says Palestinian death toll tops 8,000\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — The Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza says over 8,000 Palestinians have been killed since war broke out on Oct. 7.\n\nIt said Sunday that the toll has risen to 8,005 Palestinians, including more than 3,300 minors and over 2,000 women.\n\nThe Health Ministry is part of the Hamas-run government but includes doctors and veteran civil servants who are not affiliated with the group. Its tolls from previous wars have held up to U.N. scrutiny, independent investigations and even Israel’s tallies. The ministry released detailed records last week showing the names, ages and ID numbers of most of the deaths it has recorded, saying some bodies have not yet been identified.\n\nMore than 1,400 people have been killed on the Israeli side, the vast majority civilians killed by Hamas in its bloody Oct. 7 incursion into Israel.\n\nUN chief reiterates appeal for a humanitarian cease-fire\n\nKATHMANDU, Nepal — U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has reiterated his appeal for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza and called for an unconditional release of all hostages and the delivery of sustained relief to the people in the territory.\n\nGuterres, who is on an official visit to Nepal, condemned the “appalling attacks perpetrated by Hamas” and said “there is no justification, ever, for the killing, injuring and abduction of civilians.” He also said he regretted Israel’s move to intensify its military operations in Gaza.\n\nHe also reminded Israel and Hamas about their obligations under international humanitarian law. “I have always been consistent in my call for strict compliance of the well-established principles and rules of international humanitarian law. The protection of civilians is paramount,” he said.\n\n“The laws of war establish clear rules to protect human life and respect humanitarian concerns. Those laws cannot be contorted for the sake of expediency. The world is witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe taking place before our eyes,” he added.\n\nWHO restores contact with a team in Gaza\n\nCAIRO — The head of the World Health Organization says they managed to communicate with the agency’s team in Gaza after internet and phone connectivity in the enclave were gradually restored.\n\n“They said the last two nights were extremely tense with a lot of airstrikes – without fuel, water, electricity, connectivity and safe shelter to evacuate to,” Tedros Adhanom wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nHe added that the WHO team, like others in Gaza, remain unsafe and called for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire.\n\nWHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said the agency has 30 employees in Gaza.\n\nPalestinian Red Crescent says Israel orders Gaza hospital to evacuate\n\nJERUSALEM — A spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent says Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City received two calls from Israeli authorities Sunday morning demanding it evacuate.\n\nA statement released by the organization said that the calls constituted a “clear and direct threat that the hospital must be evacuated at once, otherwise PRCS holds full responsibility for the lives of everyone inside the hospital.”\n\nSpokesperson Nebal Farsakh said that since Sunday morning, Israeli airstrikes have been increasing in the area, reaching buildings as close as 50 meters (yards).\n\nShe said that 12,000 people are currently sheltering in the hospital. The intensive care unit is predominantly occupied by children injured in the latest airstrikes. “Most of them are connected to oxygen machines,” she said. “Evacuating them would be killing them.”\n\nThe Israeli military did not comment immediately Sunday. The military has told some 1 million people to evacuate to the southern part of the Gaza Strip ahead of an expected ground invasion.\n\nWHO said it’s impossible to evacuate patients without endangering their lives. Hospitals across Gaza are already operating at maximum capacity due to the injuries from unrelenting bombardment, and are unable to absorb a dramatic rise in the number of patients, while sheltering thousands of civilians, the U.N. agency said.\n\nUN says thousands broke into Gaza warehouses to take food\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees says thousands of people broke into its Gaza aid warehouses to take food and other “basic survival items.”\n\nThomas White, the agency’s director in Gaza, said Sunday that the break-in was “a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down” after three weeks of war between Israel and Gaza’s Hamas rulers.\n\nThe agency, known as UNRWA, provides basic services to hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza. Its schools across the territory have been transformed into packed shelters housing Palestinians displaced by the conflict.\n\nIranian-backed Iraqi militia says it hit base housing U.S. forces in Syria\n\nDAMASCUS, Syria — An Iranian-backed Iraqi militia says it launched drone strikes on a base housing U.S. forces in eastern Syria.\n\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which has claimed responsibility for a series of strikes on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria over the past two weeks, claimed responsibility on Sunday for the latest attack. The group has said the attacks are in retaliation for U.S. support for Israel.\n\nAccording to the Pentagon, as of Friday there had been at least 20 attacks on U.S. bases and personnel in Iraq and Syria since Oct. 17, and 21 U.S. personnel were injured in two of those assaults when drones targeted al-Assad airbase in Iraq and al-Tanf garrison in Syria.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes hit areas near Gaza’s largest hospital, residents say\n\nCAIRO — Israeli airstrikes have hit areas around Gaza’s largest hospital, residents say, destroying roads leading to the facility, which is a major shelter for Palestinians fleeing Israeli bombardment.\n\nThe Israeli military has renewed longstanding allegations in recent days that top Hamas leaders and operatives have built underground bunkers below Shifa hospital and accused the militant group of using civilians as human shields. Israel has not presented evidence, and Hamas denies the claims.\n\n“Reaching the hospital has become increasingly difficult,” Mahmoud al-Sawah, who was sheltering in the hospital, said over the phone on Sunday. “It seems they want to cut off the area.”\n\nAnother Gaza resident, Abdallah Sayed, described the Israeli air and land attacks in the past two days as “the most violent and intense” since the war started.\n\nUN Security Council schedules emergency meeting on Monday\n\nUNITED NATIONS — The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on Israel’s ground invasion of Gaza on Monday afternoon at the request of the United Arab Emirates, the Arab representative on the council.\n\nInternet and telephone connectivity restored for many in Gaza\n\nCAIRO — Internet and telephone connectivity was restored Sunday morning for many people in Gaza, according to the telecoms company Paltel, Internet-access advocacy group NetBlocks.org and confirmation on the ground.\n\nREAD MORE: Internet, phone service slowly returns to Gaza after blackout amid heavy bombardment\n\nFor more than 24 hours, people in the besieged Gaza Strip were not able to communicate with each other or seek help amid a relentless Israeli bombardment. The narrow coastal area had suffered a total communication blackout since late Friday, adding to the misery of more than 2.3 million people living there. Many residents, especially in the northern half of the strip, were not able to call ambulances to transfer injured people to hospitals or to seek help for those trapped under the rubble of bombed houses.\n\n“The aggressive bombardment was horrible,” said Raed Sharif, a volunteer helping transport wounded people to hospitals in Gaza city. “There were striking everywhere.”\n\nDoctors Without Borders medical group said the communication blackout had further isolated the population suffering under siege and bombardment. The blackout also limited the group’s ability to coordinate and provide medical assistance, it said.\n\nRed Crescent says blackout keeping aid outside Gaza\n\nJERUSALEM — No international aid entered the Gaza Strip on Saturday, as the communications blackout created by Israel continued.\n\nNebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent, told The Associated Press that no aid trucks entered Gaza on Saturday because communication was impossible and teams inside Gaza couldn’t connect with Egyptian Red Crescent or United Nations personnel.\n\nBefore Saturday, a total of 84 aid trucks were let into Gaza, a tiny amount for a population of 2.3 million people in need of power, food, medical supplies and clean drinking water.\n\n2nd U.S. aircraft carrier group moves into Mediterranean\n\nWASHINGTON — The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier and its strike group has moved through the Strait of Gibraltar, putting two American carriers in the Mediterranean Sea, a rare sight in recent years.\n\nThe USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group is already in the eastern Mediterranean, part of a buildup of forces as the U.S. supports Israel in its war against Hamas.\n\nThe Eisenhower sailed into the Mediterranean on Saturday and is slated to move through the Suez Canal to the U.S. Central Command region as the American forces expand their presence in the Middle East to deter Iran and its proxy militant groups from trying to widen the war.\n\nCommunications blackout has Palestinians panicking\n\nNow that Israeli bombs have cut off cellular and internet service for most of the 2.3 million people in the Gaza Strip, it has fallen to a rare few Palestinians with international SIM cards or powered-up satellite phones to get the news out.\n\nThey described scenes of panic and confusion as Israel’s military attacks from the air, land and sea in the most intense bombing yet in the three week war. Without social media to share their plight with the world, many seem consumed with fear and hopelessness.\n\nReached by WhatsApp, freelance photojournalist Ashraf Abu Amra in northern Gaza said the international community must intervene to save the people of Gaza from immediate death. Palestinian journalist Hind al-Khoudary reported that some 50,000 people have converged on Gaza’s largest hospital, where doctors are exhausted from operating on patient after patient using dwindling fuel and medical supplies."
