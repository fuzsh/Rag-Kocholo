        "text": "This edited article about the crusades originally appeared in Look and Learn issue number 970 published on 11 October 1980.\n\nRunning a war presented many problems in the days of the Crusades in the 12th century. The knights would take orders only from their master who, in the case of the Templars, was the Pope in Rome. To send a courier from Jerusalem, where the fighting was taking place, to Rome for battle orders, could take up to four months.\n\nThis situation had arisen because the success of the First Crusade had meant that a Christian king was ruling for the first time in Jerusalem. But because the countryside still swarmed with hostile Moslems, it was necessary to have knights of the military orders guarding the city.\n\nThe Hospitallers were one of the three orders, and they shared with the Templars and the Teutonic Knights the duties of protecting pilgrims and warding off the Saracens, as they called the Moslems. To the Christian king of Jerusalem, they were the finest regiments in his armies, but they had one great drawback.\n\nThe knights would obey only their own general, who was the “master” of their order. The king could ask them to fight, but he could not command them to. It was bad enough that he had to be tactful with the great nobleman, the master of the Hospitallers, but even worse was the problem with the Templars, whose overlord was the Pope.\n\nThe knights did not only make war on the Saracens. As their wealth and power increased, they grew jealous of each other, and their bitter rivalry weakened rather than strengthened the kingdom which they had sworn to defend. Their enemies watched this situation with delight, knowing that their day of revenge might not be far off.\n\nBut to the young men of Europe, the knights had an image of glamour, and many noble youths hurried to Outremer, hoping to be enrolled in one of the orders.\n\nIt was not easy, but that only made it more challenging to a youth who longed to swagger round Jerusalem in the black cloak with the eight-pointed star of the Hospitallers, or the white cloak and red cross of the Templars.\n\nThe unsuitable were weeded out in the first round of tests. Then those who were left were interviewed by the master in front of the other assembled knights.\n\n“Are you unmarried?” the master demands. “Are you in debt to any money-lender? Has your family been noble for four generations?”\n\nThe nervous candidates give their replies and brace themselves for the next questions.\n\n“Do you swear to live like a monk in the service of our Lord? Do you swear to keep the holy vows of chastity, obedience and poverty? Do you swear to serve the order faithfully unto death?”\n\nOn their knees the young men, perspiring in the stifling heat, give their promises, but the master still has not finished with them.\n\n“Just because you have seen us riding around on splendid horses, finely dressed and well fed, you say you want to be one of us,” he says grimly, “but you are mistaken, our life is not what you see in the streets of Jerusalem.”\n\nHe glares along the row of bent heads, as if he wants them all to change their minds, and scuttle back home to an easier life. But no-one moves and after a pause he continues.\n\n“When you want to sleep, you will be sent to keep watch. When you are hungry, you will learn it is an extra fasting day. When you have drunk your fill, you will be ordered to drink more. When you have settled in a place you find agreeable, you will be sent beyond the seas to another place which you will find most disagreeable. But you will go and do whatever is ordered. Is this the life for you, my fine young gentlemen?”\n\nShaken, but still determined, the candidates vow to strive to be worthy of the great order, if the master considers them suitable. For those who are chosen, there follow months of hard training as novices, and then they take their final vows and at last become true knights of the order.\n\nPerhaps one would be sent to the garrison of Bethgeblin, the castle dominating the vital port of Ascalon to the South. It is very likely that his friend whom he had hoped to share this first outpost duty with, would have been deliberately ordered to the mighty fortress of Krak des Chevaliers on the wild borders of Syria. The vow of unquestioning obedience was the most difficult to observe.\n\nFor almost a century, the Christians held Jerusalem, but afterwards the Saracens found the great leader for whom they had been waiting. Their only problem was the prowess of the military knights who stood ready to defend the Holy Places.\n\nThe Saracens, under the Emir Saladin, besieged the city of Tiberias to lure the Christian army out of Jerusalem, and then fell upon them on the hills of Kurn Hattin. There, on the site of the Sermon on the Mount, the army was destroyed, though about 200 Templars and Hospitallers were taken alive and brought before Saladin.\n\nAdmiring their courage, he offered them their lives if they would become Moslems. Not one broke his vow of loyalty to death to his order, and reluctantly Saladin gave orders for their execution.\n\nJerusalem fell within weeks, and over the next 100 years the Christians lost every stronghold in the country until only the port of Acre remained. This had become the new headquarters of the Hospitallers, and in 1291 a garrison of 15,000 men held out for months against a Saracen force of 100,000.\n\nThe knights held off the repeated attacks for weeks, though their numbers lessened daily, through hunger and disease as well as battle-wounds. Finally the outer walls were breached, and as the Saracens swarmed into the inner city, the Christian king of Cyprus turned traitor and sailed away to safety with his men, leaving the knights to their fate.\n\nThey made a last stand around the great hospital where the prior and the marshal fell mortally wounded, while the unconscious master was carried to the harbour by his servant and hidden in a boat. Only six other knights escaped to carry their tale to Europe.\n\nTheir departure from Acre saw the end of the kingdom of Jerusalem, but a new beginning for the Knights Hospitaller under the master, John de Villiers."
