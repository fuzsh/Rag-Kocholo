        "text": "This is my first post on Historum so I apologize for any wrong decorum. I am extremely interested in what I find is a niche topic in the military history of classical antiquity: The 'Jewish' armies of the Hasmoneans and King Herod. I have read many books on the subject such as Judas Maccabaeus: The Jewish Struggle Against the Seleucids, The Armies of the Hasmonaeans and Herod, and The Army of Herod the Great. I have also read relevant primary sources as well such as Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews.\n\nBut there is one question I have had throughout my reading which I was hoping to get some input on. Did the heavy infantry of King Herod use spears? If so, what was their tactical application?\n\nI wanted to use this discussion to also see how many people actually know about the armies of the Hasmonaeans and Herod, so if you don't care about my question, but have another comment to make that's fine too! You can stop reading here because I am going to share some thoughts below as to why I am asking the question and the research I have done.\n\nIn all my reading on the subject of King Herod's army, one thing seems very clear: King Herod's army was modeled on Roman standards (albeit with a bit of a Hellenistic influence such as the ratio of cavalry to infantry). Israel Shatzman states that \"Herod's career and close personal contacts with Roman generals make it highly likely that he very early decided to adopt Roman military institutions for his army. The introduction of Roman training methods and strict discipline will have been as important as the adoption of Roman tactics.\" (Israel Shatzman, The Armies of the Hasmonaeans and Herod, published 1991, page 211). Furthermore, Samuel Rocca says that \"This certainly reflected the general trends of the Late Hellenistic period, when Roman influence was widespread. It is probable that Herod's guard units and heavy infantry and cavalry were armed with helmet, cuirass, shield, spear and sword,\" (Samuel Rocca, The Army of Herod the Great, published 2009, page 21). There is also another reference to Herod's infantry using spears, but I can not find it right now, I think it was in Josephus Antiquities of the Jews.\n\nAnd this is where my question stems from. If Herod's heavy infantry truly were Roman inspired, why do some sources say they probably had spears with no reference to the pila implying more traditional spears? I Have even included some pictures from Samuel Rocca's book showing a so called \"Jewish heavy Infantryman\" with the blue scutum, a baldric, but no spear. In another picture a \"Sebastenos Armored Infantryman\" is also depicted, this time with scutum and spear.\n\nNevertheless maybe I am hopelessly obsessed with a minor detail. My current idea is that if Herod's heavy infantrymen were all given spears, they might have used them like the Romans depending on the tactical situation either as a wall or to be thrown before the melee. If this is the case, why didnt Herod just adopt pilum? Whenever spears or javelins of Herod's time are examined, it seems scholars and archaeologists tend to show they are of a Hellenistic design.\n\nSorry for being so exhaustive. That's it. Any input would be nice. I know details on the subject are perhaps worse than scanty so I'm fine with my question not being answered and just having a good discussion.\n\nHi, welcome to the forum. I have been interested in Herod of late as well. I got a chance to visit Caesarea, Masada and Jerusalem earlier in the summer.\n\nYou bring up a very interesting question! It would make sense if Herod's army was reformed on Roman lines and for them to use Roman style equipment. Using traditional spears would have been more in line with his Hasmonean predecessors who would be closer to a Hellenistic model. If you haven't come across Josephus stating it directly you may want to look at how the armies reportedly fought as it could give hints. For example, Alexander Jannaeus was likely using a phalanx at the Battle of Asophon based on how his army collapsed from a potential flanking movement and the fact that his army reportedly sustained massive causalities in the aftermath both indicative of a phalanx battle (Kenneth Atkinson, A History of the Hasmonean State: Josephus and Beyond (2016), 113.) You may also want to research how states neighboring Herod's kingdom fought, this could provide some hints. Also drawing from an unrelated timeframe Caracalla reformed his army to something similar to a phalanx perhaps because it worked better than standard Roman equipment when fighting Parthian cavalry.\n\nThe above is just speculation on my part I'm sure someone will give you a better answer.\n\nAlso I previously made this list of Herod's battles. I might be missing a few:\n\nMilitary Career of Herod the Great\n\n1. Victory over Bandit Hezekias (J. BJ 1.204)\n\n2-4. Forts of Malichus' brother (J. BJ 1.236)\n\n5-7. Victory over Tyrians in Galilee and captured three forts (J. BJ 1.238)\n\n8. Wins battle against Antigonus, son of Aristobulus, in Judea (J. BJ 1.240)\n\n9. Suppression of revolt by Antigonus faction in Jerusalem (J. BJ 1.252-53.)\n\n10. Victory in battle against the Antigonus faction, later founded Herodium on the site (J. BJ 1.265)\n\n11-14. Rescues Roman general Silo from pursuit, captures Joppa (Jaffa), relieves Masada and captures Rhesa (J. BJ 1.292-294)\n\n15. (-) Skirmishes outside Jerusalem (J. BJ 1.293-395)\n\n16. Capture of Jericho and surrounding heights (J. BJ 1.301.)\n\n17. Captures Sepphoris and expels Antigonus' forces from Galilee (J. BJ 1.303-4.)\n\n18. Wins pitched battle against Galilee bandits (J. BJ 1.305-7.)\n\n19. Victory over bandit holdouts in mountain caves (J. BJ 1.310-314.)\n\n20. Suppresses another rebellion in Galilee (J. BJ 1.316.)\n\n21. (-) Siege of Samosata with Antony (J. BJ 1.322.)\n\n22. Wins yet another engagement in Galilee and reduces enemy forts (J. BJ 1.329.)\n\n23. (-) Ambushed and wounded near Jericho, enemy driven off (J. BJ 1.332.)\n\n24. Reduces rebel villages north of Jerusalem (J. BJ 1.334.)\n\n25. Victory over Antigonus' general Pappus in battle (J. BJ 1.336.)\n\n26. Capture of Jerusalem (J. BJ 1.351.)\n\n27. Wins battle at Diospolis against the Nabateans(J. BJ 1.366.)\n\n28. (X) Defeated at Canatha by Nabateans (J. BJ 1.366-67.)\n\n29. Successful raids on Nabatean territory (J. BJ 1.369.)\n\n30. Repels Nabateans Invasion (J. BJ 1.380-83.)\n\nSummary\n\nTotal engagements: 30\n\nVictories: 26\n\nDefeats: 1\n\nIndecisive: 3\n\nWin rate: 86.6%\n\nWow. Thank you so much for the response, I am really surprised not only to see you address the question but also someone who knows the history. I have also read Kenneth Atkinsons book.\n\nThat list of battles with a summary is something I even considered trying to do myself for Herod but I thought it would be too much trouble and never found the time. This is truly great.\n\nWith regard to studying the battles, I have done some analysis of the scanty descriptions, mostly from the Nabatean war. Samuel Rocca in his book i cited points out that in one of the early battles it appears to have been a cavalry clash (makes sense with the Nabateans) and apparently the likely story is that the 2 cavalry forces met with Herod's heavy cavalry crushing the lightly equipped Nabateans before infantry could come into play (I attached a picture of Herodian heavy cavalry from his book). So no info on infantry. A couple battles in Josephus do use the words 'hand-to-hand' to describe some of the fighting, and this makes me think of an infantry fight, but this is not really indicative of spear action. In fact, it is really interesting to note that during one of the campaigns Herod is described as having his army build a castra, which leads further credence to Roman influence. Nevertheless, I cant find a straight answer\n\nWow. Thank you so much for the response, I am really surprised not only to see you address the question but also someone who knows the history.

Pyrrhus even wrote a treatise on the subject. On another note, I just looked at Josephus' account of the massacre at the start of Herod Archelaus's reign and thought it might be relevant. It sounds like his soldiers are fighting like Romans or he is employing a Roman cohort hard to say...\n\n'Archelaus was affrighted, and privately sent a tribune, with his cohort of soldiers, upon them, before the disease should spread over the whole multitude, and gave orders that they should constrain those that began the tumult by force to be quiet. At these the whole multitude were irritated, and threw stones at many of the soldiers, and killed them: but the tribune fled away wounded, and had much ado to escape so. After which they betook themselves to their sacrifices, as if they had done no mischief; nor did it appear to Archelaus that the multitude could be restrained without bloodshed; so he sent his whole army upon them, the footmen in great multitudes by the way of the city, and the horsemen by the way of the plain, who, falling upon them on the sudden, as they were offering their sacrifices, destroyed about three thousand of them; but the rest of the multitude were dispersed upon the adjoining mountains'\n\nGlad my post was helpful!

Every book I have read on the topic usually has pages on pages dedicated to analyzing terms. To sum up what I remember: Josephus uses the Greek words ilai for a cavalry squadron, telos for light infantry, and uses words for various Greek officer ranks. Meros is more speculative but may give hints. Rocca says that \"The meaning of his use of the term meros is speculative [...] In Josephus the term is used in the context of the Herodian army to indicate the sebastenoi, a heavy infantry formation probably modelled on a Roman legion,\"(Samuel Rocca, The Army of Herod the Great, published 2009, page 10). He also uses the word speira for cohort which is key. The reason is because during the siege of Jerusalem Josephus says that Herod had 5 speira of Romans and 5 speira of Jews. Indicating that perhaps Herod's Jewish army was organized in cohorts like the Romans.\n\nAs usually happens, my investigation into spears-or-no-spears of the Herodian army devolves into rabbit holes\n\nI suspect this is an age-old and nearly unanswerable question. If you're on Facebook, there is a group with some REALLY knowledgeable folks on the subject,\n\nLog in to Facebook\n\nLog in to Facebook to start sharing and connecting with your friends, family and people you know.\n\nEdit: Sorry, shoulda guessed it wouldn't link right! It's called Hellenistic Army Talk.\n\nMy own feeling is that spears are most likely. Yes, the mentions of \"Roman fashion\" are very suggestive, but that could just mean organization and training, not necessarily a detailed adoption of equipment. Thureophoroi with spears were VERY common troops in that area, after all, and honestly they bear more than a passing resemblence to the legionaries of the time. I don't think Roman-style weaponry is impossible, but it would be nice to have some artwork showing pila, or more detailed descriptions of equipment, or even some nice archeological finds, before I'd feel safe in making that step. And the line between \"scutum\" and \"thureos\" is very fine indeed...\n\nThureophoroi (or most any spearmen) fought in line as heavy infantry--there's no indication of them being missile troops, that I know of. Now, certainly if they're just carrying a garden-variety spear that doesn't have a buttspike and isn't too long, plus a sword, they could certainly throw the spear if they wanted to. \"Hand to hand\" is absolutely combat with spears or other hand weapons, as opposed to missile combat (which cavalry did a lot of, using javelins).\n\nI don't think it's safe to say that a force that collapsed after being outflanked and taking massive casualties indicates a phalanx. *Any* force can collapse and rout when outflanked, and many battles that definitely did not involve phalanxes still resulted in massive losses.\n\nAs you mention, translations are minefields! The link between speira and cohort is a good one, but I would not assume that any ancient writer would be consistent in how he uses speira or any other word. Just to muddy things, Greek writers were known to describe legionaries as \"hoplites\"! Makes perfect sense, from their point of view, but doesn't imply ANYthing about equipment or tactics.\n\nAnyway, since the spear was far and away the most common weapon of ancient times, I feel safe with it as a \"default\". For something different, I'm really more comfortable if there is some kind of more solid evidence than what we seem to have.\n\nMatthew\n\nI suspect this is an age-old and nearly unanswerable question.

It made me think of a couple points and I share your thoughts.\n\nFirstly, when it comes to usage of words, funnily enough Josephus uses the word \"hoplite\" to describe Herods heavy infantry as well! Several Greek others, including Polybius, use the same terminology as Josephus to describe the Roman legion. Despite the congruency of several authors, you are completely correct: ancient writers are not consistent in this regard.\n\nSecondly, I agree with your usage of spears as default and thats why the question has always troubled me. The Samuel Rocca book I have been citing a lot says that the infantry would have used lorica hamata. He also mentions how lorica squamata pieces have been found in the region as well as the spatha cavalry sword. He also says that the infantry would have used the scutum and the gladius. His reasoning for the scutum and gladius had to do with analyzing the Qumran War Scroll and some archaeological finds if I remember correctly. But yet again, as I said in the opening post, he vaguely states the heavy infantry used a spear as well.\n\nNow about the Thureophoroi you mentioned. I am glad you brought this up because this very same author has a picture from the early years of the campaigns to show that these units were in the region at the time, and were apart of a Jewish force in the early days of the army (I have attached the picture). I'm glad you brought it up because I have had my own theory that perhaps all of Herod's heavy infantry were Thureophoroi or perhaps more likely Thorakitai because of the usage of Roman ring-mail and scale-armor, and basically the consensus that Herod had \"heavy\" infantry on a \"Roman\" model (the Thorakitai being similar to a legionnaire but with a hellenistic spear). If this theory has any credence I think it would be very interesting.\n\nAlso I previously made this list of Herod's battles. I might be missing a few:\n\nMilitary Career of Herod the Great\n\n1.

I am not sure if you meant that the military operation was indecisive or that Herods involvement was indecisive. The reasons I mention this is because from the readings it seems that Herod did help facilitate the siege and it was a success: \"However, Herod did not desist from his resolution of going to Antony; but when he heard that he was besieging Samosata with a great army, which is a strong city near to Euphrates, he made the greater haste; as observing that this was a proper opportunity for showing at once his courage, and for doing what would greatly oblige Antony. Indeed, when he came, he soon made an end of that siege, and slew a great number of the barbarians, and took from them a large prey; insomuch that Antony, who admired his courage formerly, did now admire it still more.\" (J. BJ 1.321-322). This seems to imply that Herod ended the siege successfully shortly after his arrival, and we do know that Herod modeled his engineering practices and siege capabilities after the Romans (with Hellenistic influence of course). It also seems Antony was quite impressed, further leading credence to the fact that Herod played a role in the siege, perhaps with his own forces (though I am unsure how long the siege lasted and thus whether or not Herod was capable of bringing a significant force with him all the way to the Northern Euphrates in time).\n\nLet me know if you have any thoughts.\n\n@arrhidaeus I was going over your list of Herod's engagements because I love it and wish I did one myself, but I did notice something.\n\nYou have the siege of Samosata with Antony listed as indecisive. I am not sure if you meant that the military operation was indecisive or that Herods involvement was indecisive. The reasons I mention this is because from the readings it seems that Herod did help facilitate the siege and it was a success: \"However, Herod did not desist from his resolution of going to Antony; but when he heard that he was besieging Samosata with a great army, which is a strong city near to Euphrates, he made the greater haste; as observing that this was a proper opportunity for showing at once his courage, and for doing what would greatly oblige Antony. Indeed, when he came, he soon made an end of that siege, and slew a great number of the barbarians, and took from them a large prey; insomuch that Antony, who admired his courage formerly, did now admire it still more.\" (J. BJ 1.321-322). This seems to imply that Herod ended the siege successfully shortly after his arrival, and we do know that Herod modeled his engineering practices and siege capabilities after the Romans (with Hellenistic influence of course). It also seems Antony was quite impressed, further leading credence to the fact that Herod played a role in the siege, perhaps with his own forces (though I am unsure how long the siege lasted and thus whether or not Herod was capable of bringing a significant force with him all the way to the Northern Euphrates in time).\n\nLet me know if you have any thoughts.\n\nYeah I gave it as indecisive for the siege in total. Herod did very well but as a whole the campaign seems to have gone badly:\n\nPlutarch: 'Ventidius, however, decided not to pursue the Parthians further, because he feared the jealousy of Antony; but he attacked and subdued the peoples which had revolted from Rome, and besieged Antiochus of Commagené in the city of Samosata. 3 When Antiochus proposed to pay a thousand talents and obey the behests of Antony, Ventidius ordered him to send his proposal to Antony, who had now advanced into the neighbourhood, and would not permit Ventidius to make peace with Antiochus. He insisted that this one exploit at least should bear his own name, and that not all the successes should be due to Ventidius. 4 But the siege was protracted, and the besieged, since they despaired of coming to terms, betook themselves to a vigorous defence. Antony could therefore accomplish nothing, and feeling ashamed and repentant, was glad to make peace with Antiochus on his payment of three hundred talents.'\n\n(Plutarch, Antony 34.)\n\nYou bring up a very good point about how large and what capabilities the army Herod brought to Samosata might have had.\n\nYeah I gave it as indecisive for the siege in total. Herod did very well but as a whole the campaign seems to have gone badly:\n\nPlutarch: 'Ventidius, however, decided not to pursue the Parthians further, because he feared the jealousy of Antony; but he attacked and subdued the peoples which had revolted from Rome, and besieged Antiochus of Commagené in the city of Samosata. 3 When Antiochus proposed to pay a thousand talents and obey the behests of Antony, Ventidius ordered him to send his proposal to Antony, who had now advanced into the neighbourhood, and would not permit Ventidius to make peace with Antiochus.

Antony could therefore accomplish nothing, and feeling ashamed and repentant, was glad to make peace with Antiochus on his payment of three hundred talents.'\n\n(Plutarch, Antony 34.)\n\nI see. So I guess the siege did end up 'indecisive' from another source. Josephus seems to imply Herod ended it successfully but this is probably to glorify Herod a little bit even if Herod did participate and do well.\n\nRegardless, I will not add to your whole list because I would have to read every source top to bottom again, and I am confident you have every engagement listed, but I will peruse and re-read the account of your whole list and I am confident it is as near perfect as can be.\n\nOk so this might be my last post in this thread just to sum up some findings made today and the whole thread in general, and maybe conclude my thoughts on the original spear question. Obviously, I would love to still discuss the Herodian or Hasmonaen armies, so we can still talk about that here or save it for another time. Regardless, here we go....\n\nSo @arrhidaeus recommended this book earlier and I have found something worth note. The author states that \"Herod determined for all these reasons to appear in person before Samosata and did, despite a perilous journey. Herod's arrival is said to have determined the outcome of the siege.\" (Richard D. Sullivan, Near Eastern Royalty and Rome, 100-30 BC. page 224). Another reference again to Herod being at the siege of Samosata and playing a decisive role. Regardless, the siege ended with a payment from the local citizens (perhaps because of Herod's successes which Josephus describes as killing many of them). Therefore, Herod's role in the siege points to something, but it is still not confirmed. Whether or not you believe taking money from the inhabitants and leaving to be a 'win' is also important I guess. Nevertheless, keeping the result of the siege on Herod's list as \"indecisive\" makes sense.\n\nNow to the good stuff. I read through a final report on the excavations and archeological finds of Masada. There is some great data: Josephus mentions how Jewish rebels found at Masada Herod's storeroom with enough supplies for \"10,000\" soldiers (twice in Josephus' account rebels use looted Herodian storehouses). Whether or not this number is exaggerated does not really matter, but many finds of lorica squamata scale-armor (mostly in the form of many spare scales) were found at Masada presumed to be from Herods storehouse (Guy D. Stiebel and Jodi Magness, \"The Military Equipment From Masada\", in Masada VIII: The Yigael Yadin Excavations 1963-1965 Final Reports, 2007. page 2). They also find a Gladius from the second half of the first century B.C.E. (Guy D. Stiebel and Jodi Magness, \"The Military Equipment From Masada\", in Masada VIII: The Yigael Yadin Excavations 1963-1965 Final Reports, 2007. page 4). They also found 2 scutii shields, one of them being from the late republic era of Rome with its characteristic oval shape. On top of this, they found a plethora of just about any Roman weapon you can think of: Lances, spatha, javelins (no pilum), bows and arrows, and as mentioned Gladius and Scutum. The gladius was also identified directly as a gladius Hispaniensis and scale armor was practically the only armor found ((Guy D. Stiebel and Jodi Magness, \"The Military Equipment From Masada\", in Masada VIII: The Yigael Yadin Excavations 1963-1965 Final Reports, 2007. page 31). The conclusion of this report is particularly noteworthy, stating that \"It seems likely that the troops garrisoned by Herod and by his successors on Masada were equipped as auxiliaries, while the rebels also armed themselves in the manner of auxiliaries or most easily obtained weapons of auxiliary type. The legionary types of military equipment were apparently brought to Masada only at the time of the Roman siege or later.\" (Guy D. Stiebel and Jodi Magness, \"The Military Equipment From Masada\", in Masada VIII: The Yigael Yadin Excavations 1963-1965 Final Reports, 2007. page 32). The authors also put a lot of emphasis on the variety if scales found, and the large amount of various arrows and arrowheads. Last point, spear heads were found, but the authors seemed unsure if they were for spears or javelins or lances. They also dated them to the time of Jewish rebels but mentioned multiple times how the rebels used equipment from Herods time. Sadly, to bring in some doubt for you, this could have just been the armament of Herod's infantry on Garrison duty or as reserve troops, not on the battlefield. But who knows.\n\nConclusion: Herod's Roman-influenced army might have been an early prototype of a Roman client-state auxiliary army (with regard to the infantry. We know his cavalry and light infantry had heavy Hellenistic influence). Herod's heavy infantry were armed with Gladius and Scutum with evidence throughout this thread. Scholars appear to be convinced that Herods heavy infantry used lorica hamata ringmail and lorica squamata, and archeological finds support both, but it seems there was a lot more squamata. I could be wrong on this, but depictions ive seen of Romans in this period show legionaries with either hamata or squamata, but auxiliary infantry are depicted with squamata more often. I have also read that squamata is weaker but was used more in the East because it was better at providing protection from ranged weapons (super important in Herods region and who his enemies were). Therefore, it was entirely possible that a lot of Herod's heavy infantry, maybe even all of them, were armed much like a typical Roman auxiliary infantryman, which points to more evidence of the usage of a spear! Therefore, the totality of evidence seems to support that the heavy infantry likely used spears. How were they used? Perhaps in the same way as the Romans, to be used depending on the tactical situation as held or thrown. Why not adopt the pilum then? Because the spears needed to be better as a spear, rather than as a thrown weapon, because of the predominance of cavalry in the region. But in the end, with regard to herod's army equipment, who the .... knows what's right.\n\nPhew. Finally done. Here's a picture of Herod from Samuel Rocca's book to end this exhaustive rant\n\nAnother couple points: Judea was an equestrian province (when it *was* a province rather than a client kingdom), so the troops stationed there were auxiliaries, not legionaries (since legions were commanded by senators, and auxiliaries by equestrians). Plus we know from Josephus that local craftsmen were making armaments for the army, deliberately making them not to specifications, and then stashing them away when the Romans rejected them, in preparation for their revolt. So it follows that they were used to auxiliary gear. And it should be noted that auxiliaries tended to use the oval clipeus shield, basically a thureos, not the scutum, BUT again that doesn't necessarily rule out the use of the scutum (plural scuta, by the way!).\n\nI wouldn't get too caught up in \"why\" one type of armor over another. They all protected about the same, though shirts of scale and mail could be longer than the segmentata (which may not have been very common in that area at Herod's time?). It's good to see lots of surviving scale armor, but it has also been noted that bits of mail often get overlooked by archeologists, cuz they look like lumps of dirt. Plus it just rusts away a LOT quicker than bronze scales! Doesn't mean a lot, again, going with the evidence at hand is always best.\n\nAuxiliary infantry typically carried *two* spears, often with throwing loops visible. This is even in areas where legionaries with their pila were quite common. So again, \"Why?\" is a perilous question, leading into any number of theories that have no real basis and can lead to more misinterpretations. But in this case, the question could be asked, Did Herodian infantry tend towards thureophoroi, or more towards Roman auxiliaries? One spear or two? By that time, would they have even recognized a difference, much less cared?\n\nWould all of our frantic questions have been met by very puzzled looks by those ancient people?\n\nHistory's mysteries.\n\nMatthew"
