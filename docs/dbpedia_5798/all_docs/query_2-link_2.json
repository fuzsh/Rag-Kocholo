The model of Antonia Fortress with Tadi Gate (small gate with triangular top) in the Holyland Model of second temple era Jerusalem.\n\nThe general appearance of the whole was that of a tower with other towers at each of the four corners; three of these turrets were fifty cubits high, while that at the south-east angle rose to seventy cubits and so commanded a view of the whole area of the temple.\n\nSome archaeologists are of the opinion that the fortress was only a single tower, located at the south-east corner of the site; for example, Pierre Benoit, former professor of New Testament studies at the École Biblique, having carried out extensive archaeological studies of the site, concurs and adds that there is absolutely no [archaeological] support for there having been four towers. Prior to the First Jewish–Roman War, the Antonia housed some part of the Roman garrison of Jerusalem. The Romans also stored the high priest's vestments within the Fortress.\n\nEcce Homo Convent\n\nPanoramic view of the service chapel in the Roman pavement area, thought by some to be that of fortress Antonia where Pilate presented Jesus to the crowd, below the Ecce Homo Convent, now covered with an arched roof.\n\nThough traditionally held to be the location of Antonia where the \"Ecco Homo!\" episode is said to have happened, the modern scholarship argues that Pilate presented Jesus to the crowd in Herod's Palace. A painting by James Tissot, circa 1890 CE, depicts an artistic impression of the biblical description of the site. The plaza is made of large flagstones that were specially etched to prevent horses from slipping.\n\nThe Fortress of Antonia according to Josephus was located at the northwest corner of the colonnades surrounding the Temple. Modern depictions often show the Antonia as being located along the north side of the temple enclosure. However, Josephus' description of the siege of Jerusalem suggests that it was separated from the temple enclosure itself and probably connected by two colonnades (illustration) with a narrow space between them. Josephus' measurements suggest about a 600-foot separation between the two complexes (illustration).\n\nLeen Ritmeyer\n\nAccording to Ritmeyer [see N1] is of the view that the Antonia Fortress stood at the northwest corner of the present-day Temple Mount. He notes, mostly relying on the works of Jewish historian Josephus and his archaeological expeditions, that there are still some remnants of Herodian era structure of the Roman fortress. He mostly agrees with the description of the Antonia provided by Josephus Flavius in his well known work; Wars.\n\nAs noted by Josephus \"a Roman cohort was permanently quartered there\"; Ritmeyer explains; As a cohort usually consists of 500 soldiers and their horses, it would be a mistake to limit the boundaries of the Antonia to the rocky plateau only. The Strouthion Pool, for example, provided water for the Roman soldiers encamped here. At a distance of about 60m to the north is a rock scarp that enclosed a large area that was later occupied by the eastern Roman Forum. It is reasonable to suggest that the common soldiers were quartered here, while the officers and commanders stayed in the more luxurious accommodation on top of the Antonia rock scarp.\n\nThis forms the backdrop to the scene portrayed in Acts 21 and 22. Climbing up this stairway, Paul would have reached the top of the north portico from where he addressed the people.\n\nOld Jerusalem, The tower of Antonia 1887 CE: Breen, A. E. - A diary of my life in the Holy Land, J. P. Smith printing company Rochester, N.Y., (1906). In the late nineteenth century some writers erroneously identified the minaret of the Madrasa Muazzamiyya with the Tower of Antonia. Burgoyne (in his book Mamluk Jerusalem) notes that there's a lot of confusion when it comes to Antonia fortress. He also noted that there might be some remains of the Herodian-Roman fortress further south of this minaret.\n\nThe depiction of the Antonia Fortress in the Holyland Model is solely based on the accounts of Josephus Flavius who calls it the \"Tower Antonia\". In the latter part of the Second Temple Period, a Roman military garrison occupied this fortress. This small fortified outpost played a crucial role in monitoring and governing the city of Jerusalem during antiquity. It is mentioned in the biblical narrative of rescuing Paul from an enraged mob that intended to stone him to death. Paul was subsequently confined within this fortress until his relocation to Caesarea Maritima (referenced in Acts 21:7–23:31).\n\nThe Madain Project is an online archive of Abrahamic History and Archaeology.\n\nAbrahamic History & Archaeology is the study of history and archaeology with respect to the three Abrahamic Faiths without considering the religious and theological aspects. The goal of Abrahamic History is to understand how and why the religious doctrines and behaviours have evlovled and changed over time. Searching for patterns in the evolution of significant cultural events such as the development of farming, the emergence of cities, or the collapse of major civilizations for clues of why and how these have influenced the three major Abrahamic religions."
