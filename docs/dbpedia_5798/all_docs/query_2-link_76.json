        "text": "RAMALLAH, West Bank — Israel on Wednesday officially outlawed an organization of Muslim women who chase and shout at Jewish visitors to a contested holy site in Jerusalem’s Old City, along with a less-vocal affiliated group of men.\n\nIsrael’s defense minister, Moshe Yaalon, signed a regulation that accused the two groups of incitement and classified them as illegal, a move that allows for the prosecution of anyone who participates in their activities or finances them, according to a statement from the minister’s office.\n\nThe groups, called Mourabitoun for the men and Mourabitat for the women, which roughly translate to “garrison soldiers,” formed in recent years to assert Palestinian sovereignty over the sprawling compound that Jews call the Temple Mount and Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary, or Al Aqsa, which is the name of one of two main Islamic shrines there. The 37-acre compound is the holiest site in Judaism and the third-holiest place in Islam, and has been the site of clashes between Muslims and Jewish visitors as well as the Israeli authorities.\n\nThe women of Mourabitat, founded in 2012, often surround visiting Jews and the Israeli police guarding them, shouting “God is Great” and holding up the Quran, trying to disrupt their visits to the compound.\n\nIsrael captured the Old City from Jordan in the 1967 war, but returned administrative oversight of the compound to Jordan. Israel maintains security and has barred non-Muslims from praying there, but there has been a push by some religious Jews and ultranationalist politicians to defy the ban.\n\nThe Palestinian groups were formed by the Northern Islamic Movement, a religiously conservative organization based in Israel, amid growing fears among Palestinians that Jews are visiting the Temple Mount as part of an Israeli plan to assert sovereignty over the site or divide it. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly asserted that he has no intention of changing the status quo, but some members of his government have supported the call for open Jewish prayer at the compound.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
