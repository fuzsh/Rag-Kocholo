        "text": "Hospitallar is a word that refers to a member of a religious military order that was founded in Jerusalem in the 12th century. The order was also known as the Knights Hospitaller, or simply as Hospitallers. They were one of the most powerful and influential orders in Christendom during their heyday.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the history of hospitallar, from their humble origins as a hospital for pilgrims to their rise as a sovereign state with territories in Europe, Africa, and Asia. We will also look at their achievements, challenges, conflicts, and legacy.\n\nThe Foundation of the Order\n\nThe origin of hospitallar can be traced back to a hospital that was established in Jerusalem by merchants from Amalfi in Italy in the 11th century. The hospital was dedicated to John the Baptist and served as a place of care for sick, poor, or injured pilgrims who visited the Holy Land.\n\nIn 1080, a Benedictine monk named Gerard became the head of the hospital. He expanded its services and facilities, and attracted many donors and volunteers. He also established a religious community that followed a rule based on charity, hospitality, and obedience.\n\nAfter Jerusalem was captured by crusaders in 1099 during the First Crusade, Gerard's community received official recognition from Pope Paschal II in 1113. The pope granted them a charter that gave them autonomy and protection under his authority. The community became known as the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, or the Hospitallers for short.\n\nThe Hospitallers soon developed a military branch to protect the hospital and the pilgrims from Muslim attacks. They also acquired lands and castles in Palestine and Syria, and became involved in the politics and wars of the crusader states. They established a hierarchy of ranks, a uniform of black robes with white crosses, and a motto of \"Tuitio Fidei et Obsequium Pauperum\", meaning \"Defence of the Faith and Assistance to the Poor\".\n\nThe Crusades and the Holy Land\n\nThe Hospitallers played a significant role in the crusades, the series of military expeditions launched by European Christians to reclaim the Holy Land from Muslim rule. They fought alongside other crusader orders, such as the Knights Templar and the Teutonic Knights, as well as secular lords and kings.\n\nThe Hospitallers were renowned for their courage, discipline, and skill in battle. They participated in many major engagements, such as the Battle of Hattin in 1187, where they suffered a devastating defeat by Saladin, the sultan of Egypt and Syria. They also took part in the Third Crusade (1189-1192), led by Richard the Lionheart of England, Philip II of France, and Frederick Barbarossa of Germany.\n\nThe Hospitallers also administered and defended several territories in the Holy Land, such as Jerusalem, Acre, Tyre, Tripoli, and Antioch. They built fortifications, hospitals, churches, and farms. They also maintained diplomatic relations with Muslim rulers, such as Saladin and his successors, as well as with Byzantine emperors and Mongol khans.\n\nThe Hospitallers faced many challenges and conflicts in the Holy Land. They had to contend with frequent attacks by Muslim armies, internal disputes among crusader factions, financial difficulties, and manpower shortages. They also had to deal with rivalries and tensions with other crusader orders, especially the Templars, who often competed with them for resources, influence, and prestige.\n\nThe Loss of Jerusalem and the Move to Rhodes\n\nIn 1291, the Hospitallers lost their last stronghold in the Holy Land, Acre, to the Mamluks, a powerful dynasty of slave-soldiers who ruled Egypt and Syria. The fall of Acre marked the end of the crusader presence in the region. The Hospitallers were forced to evacuate their surviving members and possessions by sea.\n\nThe Hospitallers did not give up their mission to fight for Christianity in the East. They relocated their headquarters to Cyprus, where they regrouped and reorganized. They also sought a new base from which they could launch attacks against Muslim shipping and coastal towns.\n\nIn 1306, they found such a base in Rhodes, an island in the eastern Mediterranean that was strategically located near Turkey and Egypt. The Hospitallers conquered Rhodes from a Genoese lord who had rebelled against Byzantine rule. They then fortified the island with walls, towers, castles, and ports. They also divided it into seven administrative regions or \"tongues\", each corresponding to a different nationality or language group within the order: Provence, Auvergne, France, Italy, Aragon, Castile, and England. They also elected a new Grand Master, Foulques de Villaret, who had led the conquest of Rhodes.\n\nThe Siege of Rhodes and the Move to Malta\n\nThe Hospitallers made Rhodes their stronghold and base of operations for the next two centuries. They continued to wage war against the Ottoman Empire, which had emerged as the dominant Muslim power in the region. They also engaged in piracy and commerce, raiding and trading with ships and ports across the Mediterranean. They became a sovereign state, recognized by other European powers, and minted their own coins. They also maintained their hospitaller function, running hospitals and caring for the sick and poor.\n\nIn 1480, the Ottomans launched a massive attack on Rhodes, led by Sultan Mehmed II, the conqueror of Constantinople. The Hospitallers, under Grand Master Pierre d'Aubusson, resisted bravely and managed to repel the invaders after a six-month siege. The siege was one of the most famous episodes in the history of the order, and earned d'Aubusson the title of \"Defender of the Faith\" from Pope Sixtus IV.\n\nHowever, the Hospitallers could not rest on their laurels. The Ottoman threat remained, and the order faced internal problems, such as corruption, factionalism, and dissent. In 1522, Sultan Suleiman I, also known as \"the Magnificent\", launched another siege on Rhodes, this time with an overwhelming force of over 100,000 men and 400 ships. The Hospitallers, under Grand Master Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, defended valiantly for six months, but were eventually forced to surrender on 22 December 1522. The Ottomans allowed them to leave with their belongings and honors, and they sailed away from Rhodes on 1 January 1523.\n\nThe Hospitallers were once again homeless and in search of a new home. They wandered around Europe for seven years, staying in various places such as Crete, Messina, Viterbo, and Nice. They also appealed to various rulers for help and protection, but none offered them a suitable territory. Finally, in 1530, Emperor Charles V granted them the islands of Malta and Gozo as well as Tripoli in North Africa as a fiefdom under his crown of Sicily. The Hospitallers accepted the offer and moved to Malta in October 1530.\n\nThe Great Siege of Malta and the Naval Expansion\n\nThe Hospitallers found Malta to be a barren and inhospitable place, with few resources and inhabitants. They also had to pay an annual tribute of a falcon to the emperor for their new domain. Nevertheless, they set out to improve their situation and make Malta their new stronghold. They built fortifications, churches, palaces, hospitals, and gardens. They also recruited new members from various European countries, especially France and Italy. They also resumed their naval activities against the Ottomans and their allies, such as the Barbary pirates. They became known as the Knights of Malta or Maltese Knights.\n\nIn 1565, the Ottomans decided to eliminate the Hospitallers once and for all by invading Malta. They sent a huge fleet of over 200 ships and 40,000 men under the command of Lala Mustafa Pasha and Dragut Reis. The Hospitallers were outnumbered by more than four to one, but they were determined to resist. They were led by Grand Master Jean Parisot de Valette, a veteran warrior and a charismatic leader. They also received support from the local Maltese population, as well as from some reinforcements sent by Spain, Sicily, and Italy.\n\nThe siege lasted for four months, from May to September 1565. It was one of the most epic and bloody battles in history, with both sides displaying incredible courage, skill, and brutality. The Hospitallers and their allies defended their three main fortresses: St. Elmo, St. Michael, and St. Angelo, against relentless assaults by the Ottomans. They also launched counterattacks and raids to disrupt the enemy's supply lines and morale. The Ottomans suffered heavy losses, especially after the death of Dragut Reis, their most experienced admiral. They also faced shortages of food, water, and ammunition, as well as diseases and desertions. Finally, on 8 September 1565, the Ottomans lifted the siege and retreated, leaving behind thousands of dead and wounded. The Hospitallers had won a stunning victory against overwhelming odds. The siege became known as the Great Siege of Malta, and was celebrated as a triumph of Christian faith and valor over Muslim aggression and tyranny.\n\nThe Great Siege of Malta boosted the reputation and prestige of the Hospitallers in Europe. They received praise and donations from various rulers and nobles, especially from Pope Pius V and King Philip II of Spain. They also expanded their naval power and influence in the Mediterranean, becoming one of the main forces against the Ottoman expansion. They formed alliances with other Christian states, such as Venice, Genoa, France, and England. They also engaged in humanitarian and diplomatic missions, such as ransoming Christian captives, mediating disputes, and promoting trade and culture.\n\nThe Decline and Fall of the Order\n\nThe Hospitallers reached their peak of glory and prosperity in the 16th and 17th centuries. However, they also faced several challenges and difficulties that led to their decline and fall in the 18th century.\n\nOne of the factors that contributed to their decline was the changing political and religious landscape in Europe. The Reformation, the Counter-Reformation, the Thirty Years' War, and the rise of nationalism all affected the order's unity, loyalty, and resources. The order also lost some of its members and territories to Protestantism or secularization. For example, in 1538, Henry VIII of England dissolved the English tongue of the order and confiscated its properties. In 1792, during the French Revolution, the French tongue of the order was abolished and its members were persecuted or exiled.\n\nAnother factor that contributed to their decline was the decline of their naval power and influence in the Mediterranean. The Ottoman Empire gradually lost its dominance in the region to other European powers, such as Russia, Austria, France, and Britain. The Hospitallers also faced competition from other naval forces, such as the Knights of St. Stephen in Tuscany, the Order of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, and the Order of Malta in Rome. The Hospitallers also faced internal problems, such as corruption, decadence, and mismanagement. They also neglected their hospitaller function, and focused more on their military and political ambitions.\n\nA final factor that contributed to their decline was the invasion of Malta by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798. Napoleon was on his way to Egypt as part of his campaign to challenge British influence in the Middle East. He demanded that the Hospitallers allow him to use Malta as a stopover and supply base. The Hospitallers, under Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch, refused to comply. Napoleon then attacked and captured Malta with a superior force of 40,000 men and 300 ships. The Hospitallers surrendered after a brief resistance, and were forced to leave Malta with their belongings and honors. Napoleon also seized their treasury, archives, and relics. The Hospitallers had lost their last stronghold and their sovereignty.\n\nThe Modern Revival and Continuation of the Order\n\nThe Hospitallers did not disappear after their expulsion from Malta. They survived and reorganized in different countries, where they maintained their presence and traditions. They also adopted new names and jurisdictions, depending on their location and affiliation. Some of the current names and jurisdictions of the order are:\n\nName\n\nJurisdiction\n\nThe Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM)\n\nThe original order that traces its lineage to the Hospitallers of Jerusalem.
