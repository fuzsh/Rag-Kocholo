        "text": "What were the \"langues langues of the Knights Hospitaller\"? They were an administrative structure of the Order.\n\nIf you're planning a visit to Rhodes, then you're in luck as the city boasts a number of historical sites and landmarks that are definitely worth exploring. One such attraction that may pique your interest is the Knights Hospitaller, a medieval Catholic order that played a critical role in providing medical care for Christian pilgrims in the Holy Land during the Crusades. What may not be as widely known is the concept of langues and auberges in the order, which we'll be exploring in greater detail in this article\n\nWhat are the Langues of the Knights?\n\nThe Knights Hospitaller also known as the Knights of Rhodes or the Knights of Malta) was one of the two military orders that established in Jerusalem in the 12th century before relocating to the island of Rhodes in the 14th century and their cultural heritage is strong until today.\n\nFrom 1319 to 1798, the order was divided into eight langues or tonques, which were essentially geographic areas that represented a distinct language or language group.\n\nThe original seven langues were: Auvergne, France, Provence, Aragon, Italy, Germany (including the Holy Roman Empire and Scandinavia) and England (including Scotland and Ireland).\n\nIn 1462, the Langue of Aragon was divided with the creation of the eighth Langue of Castille, LÃ©on and Portugal (Portugal Split).\n\nThe Langue of Aragon was one of the original seven langues divided into Castille, LeÃ³n, and Portugal in 1462. This division occurred due to political and linguistic differences within the langue at that time.\n\nThe Langue of England, on the other hand, was dissolved during the mid 16th century following the English Reformation and the dissolution of the monasteries. It was later reinstituted as the Anglo-Bavarian Langue by Grand Master Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc in 1784 to reflect the changing political and linguistic landscape of Europe.\n\nAdministrative division of the Knights of Rhodes\n\nThe Knights operated with an administrative division. The grand priories were administrative subdivisions within each langue, responsible for governing and managing the order's properties and resources in their respective territories. These grand priories were led by a grand prior, who held a significant position within the Knights Hospitaller hierarchy.\n\nThe grand prior reported directly to the Grand Master, who was the supreme head of the entire order.\n\nEach grand priory consisted of several commanderies, which were local estates and properties that the order owned, used for generating income and supporting the knights.\n\nThe commanderies were managed by a commander, who answered to the grand prior. This hierarchical structure allowed the Knights Hospitaller to efficiently manage their extensive properties and resources across Europe and the Mediterranean, ensuring the order's continuing success in its mission to provide medical care and protection to Christian pilgrims.\n\nThe auberges of the Knights of Rhodes\n\nThe auberges were strategically located and served as both residential and administrative centers for their respective langues. These buildings were constructed in various locations during the medieval period and were designed to house the knights and their support staff, as well as serve as places of worship and administrative centers.\n\nExamples of auberges include the Auberge d'Aragon in Birgu and Valletta, Malta, and the Auberge d'Auvergne in Birgu and Valletta, Malta.\n\nThe French Auberge: A Historical Gem\n\nThe Auberge de France, considered one of the most prominent auberges, holds a unique place in the history of the Knights Hospitaller. Located in the heart of the Old Town of Rhodes, this beautifully preserved structure stands as a testament to the order's presence on the island.\n\nAs the headquarters of the French Langue, it was responsible for housing knights hailing from France, as well as serving as a centre for administrative duties and religious activities.\n\nConstructed in the 14th century, the Auberge de France features an impressive fusion of Gothic and Renaissance architectural styles. It was significantly renovated during the rule of Grand Master d'Aubusson, who commissioned Italian architect Gabriele Tadini to enhance its imposing facade.\n\nThe entrance to the auberge is marked by an ornate door, adorned with intricate carvings and the coat of arms of the order, while the interior is said to have featured a stunning courtyard and a chapel dedicated to St. Louis, patron saint of the French Langue.\n\nDid the Knights have presence to the five continents?\n\nYes, the Knights Hospitaller had a presence in five continents. They held properties and commanderies in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and even as far away as India during the medieval period. The Order was also active in Central and South America during their expansion into the New World. In modern times, they have maintained a presence in many countries\n\nThe official language of the Knights\n\nInitially, Latin was the language of choice for the Order's official communication and administration, and also used in their official diplomatic relations\n\nHowever, over time, French became the preferred language of the Order. French was the lingua franca of medieval Europe, and it was already the dominant language at the French Langue. The use of French allowed the Order to communicate effectively with the other Langues and to streamline its internal bureaucracy.\n\nFrench in the 14th and 15th centuries underwent significant phonological changes and orthographic complexities. French language scholars refer to this period as the Middle French period.\n\nThe Order of Saint John had to navigate these linguistic changes and adapt their written communication to conform to them.\n\nItalian was gradually emerging as the dominant language of Mediterranean trade, banking, and diplomacy during this period. As the Order of Saint John presence in Rhodes became more urbanized, Italian became the interim language used alongside French.\n\nVenice and Florence were two cities with significant influence over the Order of Saint John, and Italian became their clear choice for communication by the 16th century.\n\nThe National Linguistic Identities of the Knights Hospitaller\n\nThe importance of linguistic identities within the Knights Hospitaller cannot be understated, as each langue represented a unique cultural and national heritage. The distinct languages and customs of each langue contributed to the development and expansion of the order, while also fostering a sense of unity and camaraderie among its members.\n\nThis diversity was instrumental in the order's ability to successfully carry out its mission across different regions and adapt to the cultural and political landscape of medieval Europe.\n\nThe individual langues were fiercely proud of their national linguistic identities, and this pride was often reflected in their heraldry, attire, and architectural expressions.\n\nFor instance, the knights from the Langue of France would display their fleur-de-lis insignia as a symbol of their French origins, while the knights of the Langue of Castille, LÃ©on, and Portugal would incorporate the Spanish and Portuguese royal arms into their heraldic design.\n\nSimilarly, the architectural styles of the auberges were influenced by the national origins of their respective langues, resulting in a rich blend of architectural elements that showcased the multicultural nature of the order.\n\nWhile the order was united under a common cause, the diverse national linguistic identities of its members enriched the cultural exchange within the Knights Hospitaller.\n\nThis diversity allowed the order to thrive and adapt throughout its long history, ultimately leaving an indelible mark on the regions where the knights resided and served. The enduring legacy of the Knights Hospitaller serves as a testament to the power of unity in diversity, celebrating the rich tapestry of languages and cultures that contributed to its impactful heritage.\n\nThe Grand Magistry of the Knights of Rhodes\n\nDuring their occupation of the island of Rhodes, the Knights Hospitaller achieved a level of military and administrative prowess that allowed them to maintain a stronghold in the Eastern Mediterranean. The period of their rule on Rhodes, from 1309 to 1522, was marked by a series of remarkable successes in defending the island against multiple sieges and naval assaults, primarily from the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe Grand Magistry was the highest authority overseeing the Knights Hospitaller's governance and activities on Rhodes. It was led by the Grand Master, who held ultimate power and responsibility for the order's success on the island.Â\n\nMilitary and administrative matters\n\nThe Grand Master's authority extended to both military and administrative matters, ensuring the order's effective management of its resources, properties, and military forces on Rhodes. Throughout the Knights' tenure on the island, there were multiple Grand Masters, each bringing their unique leadership style and vision to the role.\n\nFortification and Defence\n\nThe Grand Magistry's primary focus was the fortification and defence of the island to protect its inhabitants and maintain the order's strategic position in the Mediterranean. The Knights Hospitaller transformed the city of Rhodes into a fortified haven, complete with a powerful navy and an advanced system of walls, towers, and moats.Â\n\nTheir commitment to the enduring defence of Rhodes not only earned them a reputation as a formidable military force but also allowed them to effectively administer the island's governance and contribute to its prosperity.\n\nCultural and academic life\n\nUnder the Grand Magistry's leadership, the Knights Hospitaller (Knights of Rhodes) also focused on nurturing the cultural and academic life of Rhodes. The island became a hub of intellectual activity, attracting scholars, artists, and architects from across Europe and the Mediterranean. This influx of talent contributed to the development of Rhodes as a cosmopolitan city, where a vibrant blend of cultures and artistic styles flourished.\n\nThe Grand Magistry's tenure on Rhodes ultimately came to an end in 1522, when the island was captured by the Ottoman Empire after a brutal six-month siege. Despite this loss, the Knights Hospitaller's time on Rhodes marked a significant chapter in their storied history, showcasing their resilience and adaptability as a military and administrative power.Â\n\nThe Grand Magistry's achievements on the island continue to serve as a testament to the enduring legacy of the Knights Hospitaller and their unwavering commitment to the order's mission of protecting Christian pilgrims and safeguarding the faith.\n\nThe Byzantine Empire's Influence on the Knights of Rhodes\n\nThe Byzantine Empire, the Eastern Roman Empire's continuation, played a crucial role in shaping the Knights Hospitaller's cultural, architectural, and military practices during their time on Rhodes.\n\nThe proximity of the Byzantine Empire to the island provided opportunities for interaction and exchange between the two powers, allowing the Knights of Rhodes to benefit from the empire's knowledge, traditions, and advancements.\n\nMilitary Fortifications\n\nOne of the most significant influences of the Byzantine Empire on the Knights of Rhodes was in the realm of military fortifications.\n\nThe Byzantines were renowned for their advanced engineering techniques and their ability to construct formidable defensive structures.\n\nAs the Knights Hospitaller sought to fortify Rhodes, they borrowed heavily from Byzantine military architecture, incorporating features such as double walls, watchtowers, and a sophisticated network of moats.\n\nThese innovations not only strengthened the island's defences but also contributed to the development of a unique architectural style blending Western and Eastern influences.\n\nCultural Practices\n\nIn addition to military architecture, the Byzantine Empire also impacted the Knights of Rhodes' artistic and cultural practices. The Empire was known for its elaborate mosaics, intricate frescoes, and ornate iconography, which left a lasting impression on the Knights Hospitaller.\n\nThe island of Rhodes became a melting pot for artistic styles, as Byzantine artistic traditions merged with those of the Order's various langues.\n\nThis fusion of cultural influences led to the creation of a distinct artistic identity that reflected the diverse and cosmopolitan nature of the Knights of Rhodes and their community.\n\nOrthodox Influences\n\nMoreover, the Byzantine Empire's influence extended to the Knights of Rhodes' religious practices. While the Order was primarily Catholic, their proximity to the Orthodox Byzantine Empire fostered greater understanding and appreciation for Eastern Christianity's traditions and customs.\n\nThis mutual respect and interaction between the two Christian denominations enriched the spiritual life of Rhodes, creating a unique atmosphere of religious syncretism in which both Western and Eastern Christian practices coexisted harmoniously.\n\nThe Knights of Rhodes' ability to embrace and incorporate such diverse influences into their own practices underscores the importance of cultural exchange and the power of learning from different civilisations.\n\nWho could become Knight of St. John\n\nThe process of becoming a Knight of St. John, also known as the Knights Hospitaller, was a selective and rigorous one, open only to a specific class of society. To join the ranks of the prestigious order, a candidate had to fulfil several strict requirements and criteria.\n\nNoble Birth\n\nFirstly, candidates had to come from noble birth, usually the sons of knights or other members of the nobility. This requirement ensured that the order maintained its exclusive and privileged status within the society of the time.\n\nCommitment\n\nIn addition to their noble lineage, the order's members also had to demonstrate their commitment to the order's religious and spiritual mission. As the Knights Hospitaller were a Catholic military and religious order, only those who adhered to the Catholic faith were eligible for membership. Every knight had to believe and obey to the Catholic Pope.\n\nUnwavering Loyalty\n\nBeyond their noble background and religious beliefs, candidates had to exhibit the personal qualities and virtues befitting a Knight of St. John. They were expected to demonstrate unwavering loyalty to the order's mission and its Grand Master, as well as a fierce dedication to the defence of Christianity and the protection of pilgrims travelling to the Holy Land. Candidates also had to possess a strong moral character, with an emphasis on virtues such as humility, courage, and a willingness to sacrifice oneself for the greater good.\n\nSkills and Training\n\nBefore being admitted into the order, aspiring knights underwent a period of training and initiation, during which they learned the necessary skills and disciplines for their future roles, both on and off the battlefield. This training included martial arts, horsemanship, and the use of various weapons, as well as the study of religious texts and the rules governing the order's daily life.\n\nAdministrative changes by the time the order began until today\n\nBy the time order began, the Order of the Knights of St. John, also known as the Knights Hospitaller, has undergone numerous administrative changes, reflecting the shifting political, religious, and social landscapes of the time.\n\nFrom its origins as a religious and military order, the Knights Hospitaller has evolved and adapted, maintaining its relevance and presence in the modern world.\n\nWhen the order began, the Order was governed by a hierarchical structure headed by the Grand Master, who held the ultimate authority over all matters concerning the Order.\n\nWith the fall of Rhodes in 1522, the Order was forced to move its base of operations to Malta, where it would be known as the Knights of Malta.\n\nDuring this period, the Order underwent significant transformations in its administrative structure, adapting to the changing political, military, and social context of the time.\n\nThe Grand Master's role became more akin to that of a sovereign ruler, with enhanced political and diplomatic responsibilities in addition to overseeing the internal affairs of the Order.\n\nThe Revolution in France and the subsequent Napoleonic Wars dealt a severe blow to the Order, leading to the loss of its Maltese territories in 1798. Consequently, with the events of France the Order faced a period of disarray and uncertainty, with the remnants of its once-proud institution scattered across Europe.\n\nIt was not until 1834 that the Order would establish a permanent headquarters in Rome, where it remains to this day.\n\nIn the modern era, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta (SMOM), as it is now known, has shifted its focus from military pursuits to humanitarian and charitable endeavours.\n\nThe Order's administrative structure has adapted to these new priorities, with the Grand Master now presiding over a central government responsible for managing the Order's global operations and diplomatic relations.\n\nComprising various national associations and relief organisations, the SMOM continues to uphold the original principles and values of the Knights Hospitaller, while embracing its contemporary role as a humanitarian force in the 21st century."
