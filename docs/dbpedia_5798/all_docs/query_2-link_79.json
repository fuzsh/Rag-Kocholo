        "text": "Though New Testament scholars have written extensively on the Roman Empire, the topic of the military has been conspicuously neglected, leading many academics to defer to popular wisdom. Against this trend, The Roman Army and the New Testament provides a clear discussion of issues that are often taken for granted: Who served in the military of early Roman Palestine? Why did men join the Roman army, seemingly at odds with their own interests as subject peoples? What roles did soldiers serve beyond combat? How did civilians interact with and perceive soldiers? These questions are answered through careful analysis of ancient literature, inscriptions, papyri, and archaeological findings to paint a detailed portrait of soldier-civilian interactions in early Roman Palestine. Contrary to common assumption, Judaea and Galilee were not crawling with Roman legionaries with a penchant for cruelty. Rather, a diverse mix of men from Palestine and nearby regions served as soldiers in a variety of social roles: infrastructure construction, dispute mediation, bodyguarding officials like tax-collectors, etc. Readers will discover a variety of complex attitudes civilians held toward men of Roman violence throughout the Roman East. The importance of these historical issues for biblical scholarship is demonstrated through a verse-by-verse commentary on relevant passages that stretches across the entire New Testament, from the Slaughter of the Innocents in Matthew's nativity to the climactic battle with the Great Beast in Revelation. Biblical scholars, seminarians, and military enthusiasts will find much to learn about the Roman army in both the New Testament and early Roman Palestine.\n\nThe survey of the Legio area, conducted on behalf of Tel Aviv University in 1998-2000, recovered numerous finds related to settlement sites in the region, and enabled us to suggest the locations of a Jewish village, a Roman military camp and a Roman-Byzantine city in a welldefined geographical area, characterized by an abundant water source throughout the year and an important road junction in the northern Land of Israel. The paper presents the finds of the survey, focusing on the Roman military camp at Legio. The location of the camp was detennined with the assistance of the survey finds and analysis of the routes of Roman roads and aqueducts, and tl1e distribution of cremation burials. The size of the camp was ascertained on the basis of old maps, aerial photographs and the ceramic finds of the survey. The paper takes into account the results of other surveys and excavations conducted in the area and the discovery of roof tiles with stamps of the legions stationed at the camp site. The smmnary presents preliminary conclusions, within the limitations of the study, relating to the Roman military presence at Legio.\n\nThis study is a review and in several cases it sheds light upon the history of Jerusalem City during the Roman and Byzantine epochs through focusing on a) the demography of the city, b) the names which had been mentioned in historical sources, c) ancient inscriptions and d) its urban design. The review goes through Jewish sources, particularly those which deal with the reign of the Roman leader, Pompey (Pompey the Great) and the Maccabees (Machabees); the reign of the Roman Emperor, Titus, during which the Jews were tortured; the reign of the Roman king of Jews, Herod (or Herod the Great); the reign of the Roman Emperor, Ha-drian; and the converting of the City from paganism to Christianity.\n\nThe file includes the English abstracts of the articles published in this volume (in Hebrew): David Ussishkin: Was Jerusalem a Fortified Stronghold in the Middle Bronze Age?
