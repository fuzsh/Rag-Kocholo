Career[]

A star of many period dramas and romantic comedies, Hugh Grant has also appeared in fantasy and science-fiction genre movies, including The Lair of the White Worm, Doctor Who: The Curse of Fatal Death, Cloud Atlas, and Paddington 2.

He was reported on March 2, 2021, to have signed onto the Dungeons & Dragons movie, together with Sophia Lillis. Grant was initially reported to be playing a villainous role,[1] as a character called "Forge Fletcher".[2] In an interview with Screen Daily published on June 24, Grant said he hadn't played Dungeons & Dragons before but the movie, as a "great big, expensive Hollywood blockbuster" offered the chance to do something different and said "But more than that I laughed at the script. It's hard to please me, but it had real charm and moved me. I was certainly not expecting that." He could neither confirm nor deny reports that he'd be playing the villain.[3]

Filming began in May and Hugh Grant was seen in costume at Wells Cathedral on June 12[4] and at Carrickfergus Castle on June 28 and 29.[5][6][7]

Filming for Hugh Grant and Reg√©-Jean Page wrapped on August 8. This was reported soon after on Twitter by Jonathan Goldstein, who said "and damn are they good in this movie."[8]
