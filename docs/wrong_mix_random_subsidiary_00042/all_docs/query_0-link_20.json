A head is sometimes visible in the wide shots of the musical numbers.

A return to the stage for director Benedict Andrews following his smash hit production of A Streetcar Named Desire.

Chaplin is based on the real-life story of Charlie Chaplin, the iconic film actor, writer, producer and director. The new musical spans the comics entire career, from Chaplins first performance as a child in 19th-century London to his tearful acceptance of an honorary Academy Award in 1972. The show documents the beloved actors rise to fame and the people who shaped his life, including his mother Hannah, his older brother Sydney, his fourth wife Oona ONeill and gossip columnist Hedda Hopper. The musical dramatizes the making of Chaplins legendary films, including The Kid, The Circus, Modern Times and The Great Dictator as well as his turbulent childhood, frenzied love life and political beliefs. Featuring an original score by Christopher Curtis, including Look at All the People, Just Another Day in Hollywood and This Man, Chaplin tells the touching story of the man who makes the world laugh as his legendary screen persona, the Tramp, but struggles to find happiness in his own life. Nicely filmed from the balcony with a good mix of close-ups and fuller stage shots. No obstructions.\n\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory U.K. Summer 2013.

Tablak.\n\nA fantastic capture of the Hollywood Bowls yearly spectacle. The cast is solid without a weak link in the bunch. Even those without Broadway experience hold their own with the others. Samantha and Ashlee in particular have a nice chemistry together, with strong voices and great dancing. The stage and sets are much larger than the Broadway version, but the blocking and choreography fill them nicely. The show is completely intact from start to finish, filmed on a tri-pod so its very steady throughout. The first few minutes are a bit shaky and theres obstruction that blocks the actors feet, but both issues are fixed after All That Jazz. Very little washout except in a few high-contrast wide shots. Its filmed in 16:9, with wides and mediums; there are no close-ups due to the distance from the stage. The sound is excellent. Includes curtain call.\n\nChicago 07.05.15 Broadway Starring Brandy Norwood\n\nStarring: Brandy Norwood , Amra-Faye Wright, Ivan Hernandez , Raymond Bokhour , NaTasha Yvette Williams , and R. Lowe .\n\nExcellent HD capture of Brandy Norwood joining the cast as Roxie.\n\nSome heads in the lower portion of the screen during wide shots, but nothing that gets in the way.\n\nEverything is nicely captured, a few minor and quick parts to the extreme far right can be blocked a few times. Brandy did an excellent job in the role and was really giving a solid performance\n\nCHICAGO\n\nBroadway Revival February 6, 2022 (Matinee)\n\nBianca Marroquín ( Roxie Hart), Amra Faye-Wright ( Velma Kelly), James Monroe Iglehart (Billy Flynn), Raymond Bokhuor (Amos\n\nHart), Jennifer Fouché (Matron \"Mama\" Morton), R Lowe (Mary Sunshine), Christine Cornish Smith (Hunyak), Mary Claire King (Liz), Rachel Schur\n\n(Annie), Celina Nightengale (June), Arian Keddel (Mona), Brian O'Brien (Fred Casely), Jessica Ernest (Go-To-Hell-Kitty), Michael Scirrotto (Harry/\n\nThe Jury), Barrett Martin (Sergeant Fogarty), Jeff Gorti (Doctor/The Judge), Denny Paschall (Aaron), Jermaine R Membert (Martin Harrison), Drew\n\nNellessen (Bailiff/Court Clerk)\n\n: Completely unobstructed ensemble and Roxie-focused capture of Bianca’s unexpected return to the role of Roxie!\n\nCHICAGO\n\nJune 12, 2022 Broadway\n\nEmma Pittman (Roxie Hart), Lana Gordon (Velma Kelly), Ryan Silverman (Billy Flynn), Evan Harrington (Amos Hart), Jennifer Holliday (Matron “Mama” Morton), R.

Rembert (Martin Harrison), Rachel Schur (Annie), Michael Scirrotto (Hary/The Jury), Christine Cornish Smith (Hunyak)\n\nGood 4K capture of Emma Pittman’s very limited run as Roxie. There were several moments of blackouts, wandering, etc as ushers were active, primarily in scene transitions. There is also some minor obstruction in the form of a head at the bottom of the stage, and occasionally the master’s covering. Spotlight washout is fairly frequent but rarely obscures a character’s face. Includes curtain call and most of the entr’acte,.\n\nCHICAGO\n\nOctober 15, 2022 Broadway\n\nAngelica Ross (Roxie), Christine Cornish Smith (u/s Velma), Charity Angél Dawson (Matron “Mama” Morton), Brandon Victor Dixon (Billy Flynn), R.

Rembert (Martin Harrison), Denny Paschall (Aaron), Drew Nellessen (The Judge, Court Clerk).\n\nGreat 4K capture of Angelica Ross’s limited run as Roxie! There are small obstructions when characters are sitting or laying down, and more wandering than usual due to usher vigilance. Starting near the end of “Me and My Baby” to the beginning of “Mister Cellophane,” there is a blackout due to somebody moving in front of the master and obstructing the view. Includes most of curtain call,\n\n​\n\nChicken and Biscuits Nov.2021\n\nNorm Lewis, Cleo King. Michael Urie\n\nGood stationary Iphone recording. Filmed a few rows back , minimal heads blocking.

However, the enthusiastic amateurs, undeterred, nobble Sir Derek and the other cast members to stage their own version. There is dissent in the company when Chris (Henry Shields) and Robert (Henry Lewis) both want to play Scrooge, while nervous Dennis (Jonathan Sayer), as Bob Cratchit, has to read all of his lines off prop and Annie (Nancy Zamit) gets glued to her chair. When Lucy's (Ellie Morris') Tiny Tim is knocked out by falling scenery, the hulking Robert rather improbably must replace her. With faulty greenscreen special effects, and a seemingly romantic betrayal exposed, the company's version seems doomed until Sandra's (Charlie Russell's) Aunt Diana (Dame Diana Rigg) comes to the rescue.\n\nA Christmas Carol 2020\n\nThe timeless tale of Ebenezer Scrooge comes to thrilling new life as Tony Award winner Jefferson Mays (I Am My Own Wife, Gentlemen’s Guide…) plays over 50 roles in a virtuosic, master class of a performance that must be seen to be believed. This theatrical achievement comes from the haunting vision of one of Broadway’s most imaginative directors, Michael Arden .\n\nStaged exclusively for this production and captured live with breathtaking clarity, this must-watch streaming event conjures the powerful spirits of Christmas and brings all the magic of live theatre home for the holidays.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nCinderella (11/2004) Lincoln Center\n\nDick Van Patten, Renee Taylor, Christopher Sieber, Eartha Kitt, Lypsinka, Lea DeLaria, Ana Gastayer, Sara Uriarte Berry.Excellent picture/sound.\n\nCinderella\n\n3/2/2013 ~ Broadway\n\nLaura Osnes, Santino Fontana, Victoria Clark, Harriet Harris, Peter Bartlett, Ann Harada, Greg Hildreth, Marla Mindelle.

Date/cast unknown\n\nFame Becomes Me - Original Broadway Cast 7/16/06\n\nMartin Short, Brooks, Ashmanskas, Mary Birdsong, Nicole Parker.\n\nFinal Pre-Broadway performance. Takes a few minutes for the filmer to get settled. Slight cover-ups, few heads. But when zoomed in, very clear picture and great sound. Some trouble following the action.\n\nThe Fantasticks Original Cut of Movie with Approximately 23-Minutes Restored (1995)\n\nThis is the original cut of the movie before its general theatrical release. It includes approximately 23-minutes of restored footage, including the opening rendition of the show's most celebrated song, \" Try to Remember, \" and a whole number between the fathers, \" Plant a Radish .\"\n\nAlso cut and now restored is \" It Depends on What You Pay (The Rape Song )\" . Restorning the songs is one thing, but dialogue that helps with character development was also restored making this a more complete version of \" The Fantasticks \" and certainly more in line with director Michael Ritchie's original vision of the film.\n\nThe movie was filmed in 1995, and shelved for five years. The released version was re-edited by Francis Ford Coppola with the consent of director Michael Ritchie; however, it is missing some key scenes and musical numbers. Now you can view the original version as it was intended to be seen.\n\nWhile neer aspiring to be a movie musical groundbreaker along the lines of \"Cabaret\" or \"Moulin Rouge,\" \"The Fantasticks\" is an out-and-out charmer: whimsical, compelling, and beautiful in every department. It stands, in its way, as an homage to movie musicals of days gone by: if you've seen \"Oklahoma! (1955), you'll know what we mean. Ritchie - heretofore acclaimed for his deft satire, for his scalpel-sharp vision of America - here sheaths his sword and offers a surprisingly warm tribute to a beloved genre and to a country as it might once have been.\n\nThe film was completed in 1995 and scheduled for a Thanksgiving release, but executives at MGM/United Artists, discouraged by indifferent preview audience response, lost faith in the project and shelved it.\n\nDue to a contractual obligation to Jones and Schmidt to give the film a theatrical release, MGM Board of Directors member Francis Ford Coppola decided to trim the film from its original 109 minute length to 86 minutes, and the abridged version finally was released in four theaters in September 2000. Ritchie's original, 109-minute version is finally available for all to see, especially those who love this musical favorite.\n\nAmos Babcock Bellamy ( Joel Grey ) and Ben Hucklebee ( Brad Sullivan ) scheme to get their respective children, Luisa ( Jean Louisa Kelly ) and Matt ( Joey McIntyre ), to fall in love. Knowing they will resist their fathers' interference, the two men use reverse psychology and fabricate a feud, building a wall between their houses and forbidding their children to speak to each other.\n\nWhen their plan works, they enlist the aid of El Gallo ( Jonathon Morris ), the proprietor of a traveling carnival, to put an end to their supposed disagreement in a manner which will not reveal their deception.\n\nEl Gallo pretends to kidnap Luisa with the help of his troupe, which includes elderly Shakespearean actor Henry Albertson (Barnard Hughes ) and his mute sidekick Mortimer ( Teller ), and arranges for Matt to rescue her. The couple settles into what they anticipate will be domestic bliss, but through the eyes of El Gallo and company they see the harsh realities of the world, and their innocent romanticism is replaced by a more mature understanding of love.\n\nFanny\n\nEncores!

Up close and clear.\n\nFifth of July:\n\nHighlighted by Swoosie Kurtz's Tony Award-winning performance, this 1982 recording of Fifth of July preserves what is likely to remain the definitive production of Lanford Wilson's highly acclaimed play. Originally presented on PBS's American Playhouse, the videotaped performance retains director Marshall W. Mason's original 1978 staging for New York's legendary Circle Repertory Company, while allowing TV director Kirk Browning to \"open up\" the play with outdoor exteriors of Wilson's Lebanon, Missouri, setting in the summer of 1977. It's there that Kenneth (Richard Thomas), a disabled Vietnam veteran, is reunited with several friends from their days as student activists, reflecting on their past, present, and future with varying degrees of trepidation, hope, and wisdom. Groundbreaking in its casual portrayal of an openly gay couple (Jeff Daniels is superb as Kenneth's supportive lover), Fifth of July clearly influenced The Big Chill, offering a formidable acting showcase to a young cast (including Sex and the City's Cynthia Nixon) whose careers were boosted by this one-of-a-kind ensemble experience.\n\nFIRST DATE\n\nCast: Zachary Levi, Krysta Rodriguez, Sara Chase, Kristoffer Cusick, Blake Hammond, Kate Loprest, Bryce Ryness.\n\nThis is a 2 DVD release of First Date filmed on July 13th, 2013.\n\nExcellent HD capture of this charming and fun show; there is a two minute blackout about 20 minutes into the show while latecomers came in, but otherwise great picture and sound throughout.\n\nFirst Date Virtual livestream 2021\n\nAce Young, Diana Degarmo\n\nThe First Wives Club\n\n2/17/15 ~ Chicago, IL\n\nFaith Prince, Carmen Cusack, Christine Sherrill,\n\nSean Murphy Cullen, Gregg Edelman, Mike McGowen, Patrick Richwood\n\nPre Broadway first preview beautiful HD capture with no obstructions;\n\nshow ran very long, so there will surely be cuts\n\nif it goes to Broadway; good clear video with excellent\n\npicture and sound.\n\nFirst You Dream\n\nPro-shot video of the Christopher Reeve benefit with Julia Murney, Carolee Carmello, Marin Mazzie, Heather Headley, Bebe Neuwirth, Idina Menzel, Sherie Rene Scott, James Naughton, Sharon Laurence, Kristin Chenoweth, Bryan Batt .\n\nFirst You Dream PBS 2015\n\nFlashdance: The Musical\n\n3/1/09 Liverpool, England, UK Tour\n\nVictoria Hamilton-Barritt, Noel Sullivan, Bruno Langley, Bernie\n\nNolan, Michael Conway, Simon Harvey, Gavin Spokes, Vas Constanti,\n\nCarryl Thomas, Djalenga Scott, Ruthie Stephens, Vanessa Leigh Hicks.
