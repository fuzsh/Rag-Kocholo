        "text": "Hugh Grant is at the edge of reason. The British heartthrob, 54, has officially exited the highly anticipated third installment of the Bridget Jonesâs Diary series. The third book, Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, was penned by author Helen Fielding and released in 2013.\n\nRumors of a third film with star Renee Zellweger reprising the title role have been in the works for years, but now Grantâs scandalous, playboy character Daniel Cleaver will not be a part of the project.\n\nIn Mad About the Boy, Bridget and Daniel donât have a romantic relationship, but he does play a key part in her childrenâs lives.\n\nâI decided not to do it,â Grant told Free Radio of the sequel. âBut I think theyâre going to go ahead and do it without Daniel. The bookâs excellent, by the way, but the script is completely different â well, the script as I last saw it a few years ago.â\n\nThank You!\n\nYou have successfully subscribed.\n\nThe potential film, which has yet to be picked up by a studio, seems less likely to happen these days. Back in 2012, Working Title and Universal were developing the film Bridget Jonesâs Baby, based on a screenplay by Fielding, but not on her 2013 book. At the time the film was stalled, and star Colin Firth told the Chicago Sun-Times, âYou might be seeing Bridget Jonesâs granddaughterâs story being told by the time we get there.â\n\nTell Us: Do you think Bridget Jones 3 should be made into a film without Hugh Grant?\n\nncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOoaygoF2cv6K602anrqScqHqwwdNmmauhlJyytXnJqKWeq6Nisaqt0bJkbGViZX51fZBqZw%3D%3D"
