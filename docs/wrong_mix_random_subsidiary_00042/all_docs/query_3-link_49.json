        "text": "Hugh Grant is ready to play another politician … but not in a “Love Actually” sequel.\n\nThe Golden Globe winner let it slip that he’s considered leaving acting behind for a political career.\n\n“[Switching into politics] has crossed my mind,” Grant, 63, told Entertainment Weekly Monday. “But what I really see close up is that it’s almost impossible to actually get anything done. It’s just impossible. You’ve got to bring so many people with you.”\n\nThe British star said that Susanne Eberstein, his mother-in-law and a former member of the Riksdag party within the Swedish Parliament, has repeatedly tried to ward him off of a political career.\n\n“Whenever the subject comes up, she just says, ‘Don’t you have to water down everything? It’s all horse-trading. And nowadays the incoming abuse is unthinkable,’ ” Grant laughed.\n\nIn 2018, the “Paddington 2” actor tied the knot with Eberstein’s daughter, Anna.\n\nThe warning didn’t appear to stop the “Wonka” star, however, as he managed a small campaign in 2019 during the UK General Election.\n\n“I did mount a tiny campaign to try and persuade people to vote tactically because in our electoral system, this was the way to prevent Boris [Johnson] and company getting back into power,” he said. “I campaigned in a few marginal constituencies for whoever was the closest rival to the conservative candidate.”\n\nGrant ultimately felt “very badly” that they lost “in every single constituency.”\n\nEven during his short political stint, the hate he received “was absolutely terrifying.”\n\n“What was interesting was the abuse that came in from the right,” he went on. “I never know if they’re real or if they’re bots. But they’re good. They’re brilliant at what they do.”\n\n“And it was absolutely terrifying,” the “Notting Hill” actor continued. “I’ve had a bit of it before during the Hacked Off campaign, but this was really extreme and shocking and threatening to one’s family. So, I do see that you have to be either very brave or insane to go into politics in the digital age.”\n\nThe actor, who played the UK’s prime minister in 2003’s “Love Actually,” now stars in the HBO miniseries “The Regime.”\n\nCo-star Kate Winslet, 48, plays Chancellor Elena Vernham of a fictional European country, who ousts the previous leader Edward Keplinger (Grant).\n\n“The Regime” airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on HBO and Max."
