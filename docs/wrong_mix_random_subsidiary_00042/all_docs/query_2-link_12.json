An internationally recognized ocean scientist and executive, Dr. Spinrad is currently Professor of Oceanography and Senior Adviser to the Vice President of Research at Oregon State University. Among his many accomplishments, Dr. Spinrad was the head of NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research and the National Ocean Service, served as co-lead of the White House Committee that developed the nation’s first set of ocean research priorities, and oversaw the revamping of NOAA’s research enterprise. In 2016, Dr. Spinrad retired as Chief Scientist of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), having been appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014. I want to extend my gratitude to Dr. Spinrad for his willingness to serve as the CFOS keynote speaker. Please stay tuned for the date, time and details of Dr. Spinrad’s virtual presentation.\n\nThis week I will join Interim President Pat Pitney in Juneau for a tour of our Lena Point facility. President Pitney clearly understands the importance of Alaska’s vast aquatic resources and related research and academic programs and major facilities. In this regard, this tour is an opportunity to highlight some of the strengths and recent successes of CFOS, including continued growth of our undergraduate program, a robust graduate student body, new faculty hires, strong and diverse research programs, and our operation of Sikuliaq that is well regarded by the ocean sciences community and the National Science Foundation. I look forward to discussing with President Pitney ways to advance fisheries and ocean sciences research and academic programs through collaboration to meet the needs of Alaska and the nation.\n\nI hope everyone is taking time to enjoy the spectacular fall colors in our great state. As always, please stay safe as we navigate these challenging times.\n\nR/V Sikuliaq\n\nSikuliaq finished the 100th occupation of the Gulf of Alaska Seward Line with profiling instrumentation, a significant accomplishment toward the collection of long-term ecological data. The first occupation was in April 1974, with prior samples only from discrete depths.\n\nToday, Sikuliaq got underway for Jim Thomson’s (UW/APL) Coastal Ocean Dynamics in the Arctic (CODA) cruise. The CODA cruise was originally scheduled to depart from Nome, but now it will start and end in Seward because of the pandemic. Its purpose is to recover the moorings that were deployed in 2019. Thomson will also assist Spahr Webb (UC/LDEO) with deploying wave gliders near the Shumagin Islands to measure tectonic shifts from the 7.8 magnitude earthquake on July 21, and will recover gliders in the Beaufort Sea for Luc Rainville (UW).\n\nCFOS in the News\n\nA study on the loss of Bering Sea ice coauthored by Matthew Wooller gained international attention in articles by Reuters, Daily Mail, and Phys.org in addition to a radio piece by Alaska Public Media and a UAF News press release. Seth Danielson’s comments on the context of the study appeared in Gizmodo.\n\nUAF News mentioned Matthew Wooller and CFOS alum Casey Clark as coauthors on a study about the complex diets of early Interior Alaskans.\n\nBrenda Konar and CFOS alum Ben Weitzman were mentioned as coauthors on a study published in Science Magazine showing that the loss of sea otters is accelerating the effects of climate change on reefs in the Aleutian Islands.\n\nThe Narwhal, a Canadian journal, featured Peter Westley in an article about salmon body-size declines. The research, which also involved Curry Cunningham and Krista Oke, also appeared in The Guardian and the Washington Post.\n\nPublications\n\nBeas-Luna, R., F. Micheli, C.B. Woodson, M. Carr, D.

This date reverberates in 2020 with the tragic death of George Floyd, and again I encourage everyone to stand against all forms of racism.\n\nIt has been a year and a half since the second CFOS faculty retreat was held in Anchorage. A primary outcome of that gathering was to expand the face-to-face and synchronous distance delivery of our academic curriculum to include asynchronous modality, for two reasons. First, online instruction will extend our academic reach and enable the next generation of fisheries and ocean scientists to access our outstanding degree programs within Alaska and beyond. Second, we have the opportunity to increase student enrollment while generating additional revenue to support our mission.\n\nIn light of the global pandemic, asynchronous instruction has emerged as a key modality for student learning in higher education. What does this mean for CFOS and UAF? While there is currently no master’s degree program in marine science in the nation available by online asynchronous delivery, CFOS will soon offer our Master of Marine Studies and Blue MBA degree programs online; this also presents an opportunity to grow our undergraduate degree program in fisheries and marine sciences. By embracing this opportunity, CFOS will continue to be an innovative leader in fisheries, marine biology and ocean sciences instruction.\n\nI want to personally thank the following faculty for their willingness to engage in this work: Courtney Carothers, Quentin Fong, Russ Hopcroft, Lara Horstmann, Katrin Iken, Andrés López, Andrew McDonnell and Trent Sutton. I also want to thank Owen Guthrie and eCampus for support and resources, and Trent Sutton for his work in helping our faculty advance this important effort.\n\nAs we are now past summer solstice, I hope everyone is taking time to enjoy the beautiful Alaska summer.\n\nR/V Sikuliaq\n\nSikuliaq is alongside the pier in Seward performing routine maintenance and enhanced cleaning while waiting for the UNOLS Council fleet stand-down to expire on July 1. Beginning July 1, Sikuliaq will start mobilizing for her second cruise of 2020, in the Northern Gulf of Alaska Long-Term Ecological Research area.\n\nActivities and Accomplishments\n\nThe following CFOS graduate students received the North Gulf of Alaska Research Award for research connected to fisheries management and of interest to fisheries managers and regulatory bodies: Brian Ulaski, Molly Payne, Katja Berghaus, and Donny Arthur. The students will consult with scientists at the Alaska Department of Fish and Game or the National Marine Fisheries Service.\n\nCFOS in the News\n\nTrent Sutton and CFOS alumna Katie Shink’s research on Arctic lamprey migrations on the Yukon River was featured in the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner.\n\nBradley Moran was interviewed by Channel 11 News in Fairbanks on World Oceans Day to talk about the importance of oceans and the benefits they provide for humankind.\n\nThe Alaska Ocean Observing System spring newsletter focused on research operations during the COVID-19 pandemic, mentioning UAF research in the Bering Strait and featuring a story on Sikuliaq’s cruise along the Seward Line in the northern Gulf of Alaska.\n\nGay Sheffield from Alaska Sea Grant was quoted in a KNOM article about the effect of COVID-19 on research in the Bering Strait area. Communities are taking extra precautions and restricting travel from outside the region.\n\nThe National Science Foundation featured Russ Hopcroft and R/V Sikuliaq in a story about maintaining vital research in the Gulf of Alaska during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBradley Moran wrote an opinion piece published in the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner on how a potential merger between the University of Alaska Southeast and the University of Alaska Fairbanks could present an opportunity to combine the UAS and UAF programs in fisheries, marine biology and ocean sciences to better support Alaska’s health and economy.\n\nPublications\n\nConnors, B., M.

In that regard, I offer a few recent examples of the importance of our research, training and outreach, and how our activities benefit Alaska and the nation.\n\nFirst, following a recent White House summit on partnerships in ocean science and technology, the President issued a memorandum directing federal agencies to develop national strategies to map the United States Exclusive Economic Zone and the Alaska coastline. These actions will benefit Alaska and the nation’s economy, advance our understanding of our oceans and coastlines, and promote efficient ocean exploration activities. Implicit in these actions is the need for strengthened collaboration between agencies, our UAF partners, and CFOS researchers and major facilities.\n\nLast week at the University–National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) Annual Meeting, Gay Sheffield gave a revealing account of the dramatic environmental changes occurring within the Bering Strait region, and the impact of these changes on Alaska’s communities and economy. During the Q&A, numerous individuals remarked on how CFOS is literally at the front lines studying Alaska’s changing aquatic ecosystems—this is central to our mission.\n\nTo expand on this further, the fascinating work and value of CFOS is showcased in the 2019 CFOS Annual Report, which is now complete and posted on our website.\n\nAs many of you are now aware, Wendy Huesties has accepted a position with the University of Alaska statewide system. Since 2014, Wendy has played an important role as the CFOS Financial Manager. Please join me in thanking Wendy for her good work and wishing her the best in her new position.\n\nWishing everyone a pleasant and safe Thanksgiving with family and friends.\n\nR/V Sikuliaq\n\nSikuliaq is in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas to support Dr. Franz Mueter’s (UAF/CFOS) and Dr. Hauke Flores’ (Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research) GO-WEST project. The project will look at polar cod, ice-associated fauna, sea-ice habitat properties, and hydroacoustic profiles of zooplankton and fish in the western Beaufort Sea. The goal is to sample across the marginal ice zone during sea-ice formation and potential entrainment of juvenile polar cod. The GO-WEST project is funded by the Arctic Research Icebreaker Consortium (ARICE) and the CFOS Alaska Sikuliaq Program.\n\nActivities and Accomplishments\n\nShannon Atkinson, Jenell Larsen, and Sonia Ibarra participated in the Southeast Sea Otter Stakeholder Meeting in Juneau on November 6, 2019. Hosted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the meeting focused on sea otter interactions with fisheries and Alaska Native communities and recommendations for future research and management efforts.\n\nGordon Kruse served as one of three conveners of the ICES/PICES/NAFO symposium, entitled “Shellfish – Resources and Invaders of the North,\" held in Tromsø, Norway, November 5–7, 2019. Gordon also gave the keynote presentation, \"Dynamics of snow crab in the eastern Bering Sea and US portions of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas under climate change,\" which was coauthored by CFOS alumni Joel Webb and Lauren Divine and graduate student Laura Slater. Symposium papers will be published in a special issue of the ICES Journal of Marine Research.\n\nGay Sheffield gave the keynote presentation at the 2019 UNOLS Annual Meeting in Alexandria, Virginia, entitled “Bering Strait: A regional perspective on Arctic marine science.”\n\nCFOS in the News\n\nThe Nome Nugget highlighted Sikuliaq research and featured Seth Danielson.\n\nAn New York Post story about low sea ice in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas featured Sikuliaq scientists studying wave action and coastal erosion. The story appeared locally, nationally and internationally, from the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner to the Associated Press, Minnesota Star Tribune, Chicago Tribune, and Japan News.\n\nGay Sheffield was featured in an Anchorage Daily News story about seabird and marine mammal die-offs in the Bering Sea.\n\nThe Frontiersman ran a story about a keynote presentation co-delivered by Courtney Carothers at the 2019 Mat-Su Salmon Science and Conservation Symposium in Palmer.\n\nFranz Mueter was interviewed in a KNOM Radio Mission story about Arctic cod and current changes in Chukchi and Beaufort Sea ecosystems.\n\nRachel Potter was interviewed by KNOM about the use of high-frequency radar systems to monitor and track ocean currents in the Bering Strait region.\n\nPublications\n\nCarothers, C., T.L.

Arctic 72 (3): 273–88. https://doi.org/10.14430/arctic68876\n\nMessage from the Dean\n\nAs outlined in the CFOS Decadal Plan, an important part of our mission is the operation of major facilities in support of aquatic ecosystems research, training and outreach. In that regard, following the inaugural research cruise this summer with our new coastal research vessel Nanuq, Seth Danielson and his team led an expedition in support of the GAK1 time-series, collecting physical and biogeochemical data in the northern Gulf of Alaska. It is encouraging that Nanuq is already being put to good use.\n\nAlong this line, an important CFOS staff position is the Sikuliaq Science Liaison. This unique position was developed in partnership with the National Science Foundation to ensure best practices are adhered to among seagoing scientists, subsistence hunting organizations, and Sikuliaq operations. While it has taken longer than anticipated, the search for a new PIO/Sikuliaq Science Liaison is progressing, and candidate interviews will end this week. We hope to make a hiring decision for this search in the near future.\n\nSpeaking of Sikuliaq, next week CFOS will host the Research Vessel Technical Enhancement Committee (RVTEC) annual meeting to facilitate the coordination of marine technology for science operations in support of the US Academic Research Fleet and oceanographic facilities. Approximately 100 participants will attend this year’s meeting from across the nation. Kudos to John Haverlack and his team for organizing this important event.\n\nNext week, the Consortium for Ocean Leadership (COL) will host its annual fall meeting in Washington, DC, to discuss ocean science priorities, programs and budgets of regional, national and international importance. An Industry Forum will follow, focused on offshore wind development. As a full voting member and trustee of COL, CFOS will have the opportunity at this meeting to engage with ocean sciences institutions and leaders from across the country.\n\nI am happy to convey that Heather McLeod and her family welcomed a new baby boy. Congratulations!\n\nIf you haven't already, it’s time to get your snow tires on soon—please drive safely!\n\nR/V Sikuliaq\n\nSikuliaq is underway off the coast of Oregon and Washington for Dr. Ed Dever’s (OSU) OOI Coastal Endurance Array project.

With over 600 registrants and a compelling, wide-ranging agenda, this has become one of the premier meetings focused on the socioeconomic, policy and national security impacts of the rapidly changing Arctic Ocean. I had the privilege to present an overview of R/V Sikuliaq operations and broader impacts. This was an excellent opportunity to showcase CFOS and the university as the successful operator of Sikuliaq to federal and state agencies, Alaska Native organizations, nongovernmental officials, and the private sector. It is a pleasure to thank John Farrell of the US Arctic Research Commission and former UAF vice chancellor Mike Sfraga of the Wilson Center for their efforts in hosting a fascinating and engaging symposium. All presentations were recorded and are available to view online.\n\nWe are now just over a month from the start of fall semester. This is an exciting time of year, particularly for incoming and current students who bring curiosity, drive and energy to our college; it is also exciting that we will welcome three new tenure-track faculty in fisheries and oceanography. We can be proud of our largest incoming undergraduate class, as well as many new graduate students enrolled. Faculty and staff well understand that we are in the business of creating and transferring knowledge of aquatic systems, and that it is our students who ultimately define our legacy as a college. Please take a moment to reflect on the importance and positive impact of your good work.\n\nThere are understandably many questions regarding the future of the university and our college. As I noted previously, we are in for a tough road ahead. However, this is a time to remain focused on our mission of delivering excellence in fisheries and ocean sciences research, education and outreach for the benefit of Alaska and the nation.\n\nR/V Sikuliaq\n\nSikuliaq is underway for Dr. Russ Hopcroft’s (UAF/CFOS) NOAA project studying deepwater biological communities in the Gulf of Alaska (GoA Exploration). The GoA Exploration project is using traditional tools and the ROV Global Explorer to investigate deepwater planktonic and benthic communities along the continental slope, in offshore waters, and at seamounts in the Gulf of Alaska.\n\nIn early August, Sikuliaq will return to Seward to unload GoA Exploration gear and load the ROV Jason. Jason will be used to facilitate the retrieval of more than 75 ocean bottom seismometers (OBS), which were deployed from Sikuliaq in summer 2018 for Dr. Spahr Webb (Lemont Doherty Earth Observatory).\n\nActivities and Accomplishments\n\nA paper authored by CFOS student Allison Matter with coauthors Jeff Falke and Andrés López (Matter et al., listed below) was one of the top 20 most downloaded journal articles of 2018 for the North American Journal of Fisheries Management.\n\nCFOS in the News\n\nNumerous articles on CFOS related to the state budget were run in several Alaska news publications, including the Anchorage Daily News, Saving Seafood, Seafood News, Kodiak Daily Mirror and SitNews.\n\nPublications\n\nLitzow, M.

And, as President Johnsen and Chancellor White have recently communicated, there is no sugar-coating the stark reality if the budget veto is not overridden. Many of you have voiced your concerns to the legislature, and I applaud you for doing so. Our work is not yet complete: We need to continue the all-hands-on-deck effort to override the veto and support the university and its many benefits to Alaska. Please continue to voice your support for the university, and for the many other essential programs in our great state.\n\nAs we transition into the new fiscal year, it is important to recognize and thank the recent department chairs for their two years of service: Mat Wooller (Marine Biology), Mark Johnson (Oceanography) and Milo Adkison (Fisheries). It is also a pleasure to acknowledge the incoming chairs Lara Horstmann (Marine Biology), Russ Hopcroft (Oceanography), and Milo Adkison who will continue for another term as the department chair for Fisheries. Thank you all for your good work and service to CFOS.\n\nHere is looking forward to cooler, smoke-free, clear blue skies.\n\nR/V Sikuliaq\n\nSikuliaq is underway for Dr. Russ Hopcroft’s (UAF/CFOS) Northern Gulf of Alaska Long-Term Ecological Research (NGA LTER) project. The NGA LTER is investigating the physical and biogeochemical variability of the northern Gulf of Alaska, with an emphasis on freshwater input dynamics.\n\nSikuliaq is scheduled to return to Seward on Thursday, July 18, to demobilize from the NGA LTER project, and then mobilize for Dr. Hopcroft’s next Sikuliaq cruise: Exploration of deep-water communities in the Gulf of Alaska (GoA Exploration). The GoA Exploration project will use the ROV Global Explorer to study deepwater planktonic and benthic communities along the continental slope, in offshore waters, and at seamounts in the Gulf of Alaska.\n\nIn other news, in the best maritime tradition and at the request of the US Coast Guard, on Saturday, June 29, Sikuliaq came to the rescue of a small pleasure craft that was aground on the southern coast of Montague Island, located on the southern edge of Prince William Sound. Sikuliaq’s crew maneuvered close to the grounded boat, passed a towline, and pulled them off the rocks. The pleasure craft was able to restart their engine and proceed to Seward. Bravo Zulu Sikuliaq!\n\nActivities and Accomplishments\n\nPresident Trump has recognized CFOS alumna Elizabeth Siddon (Fisheries MS, 2005, and PhD, 2013) with a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE). The PECASE award is the highest honor bestowed by the US Government to outstanding scientists and engineers. Congratulations, Dr. Siddon—you make CFOS, UAF and Alaska proud.\n\nThe Seward Marine Center (SMC) successfully passed the 5-year verification of the Document of Compliance for safe administration of R/V Sikuliaq. On May 27, DNVGL (a European-based vessel classification society) visited SMC and conducted an external audit in compliance with the International Maritime Organization ISM Code. The objective of the code is to ensure safety at sea, prevention of human injury or loss of life, and avoidance of damage to the environment, in particular to the marine environment and to property.\n\nOn Sunday, July 28, NOAA and UAF will host an open house at Kasitsna Bay Laboratory from 12 to 4 pm to celebrate the 60th birthday of the lab, which was built in 1959. Visitors can tour the facility, meet researchers, check out underwater species in the touch tank, and learn about scientific and coldwater diving.\n\nCFOS Publications\n\nCanonico, G., P. L.

Alaska has over half of the nation’s coastline and approximately one-third of the Exclusive Economic Zone, and our state defines the U.S. as an Arctic nation. Alaska’s substantial Blue Economy depends significantly on marine research, education and public engagement, encompassing the mission of CFOS.\n\nIn this regard, it is a pleasure to convey that Chancellor White has approved CFOS’s proposal to establish the UAF Alaska Blue Economy Center (ABEC). This new interdisciplinary center combines UAF’s extensive expertise in Alaska’s offshore and inland aquatic ecosystems and resources. Serving as a resource to the state, a key goal of ABEC is to advance research and education opportunities in fisheries, mariculture, energy, ocean observing and technology. Over the past few years, UAF has made significant strides in advancing Alaska’s Blue Economy, for example through partnerships with Blue Evolution, the Bering Sea Fishermen's Association and the Alaska Ocean Cluster (known now as AFDF Startup Accelerator), new research in mariculture, operation of R/V Sikuliaq and the Alaska Sikuliaq Program, development of the UAF Blue MBA, and renewable energy projects led by the Alaska Center for Energy and Power.\n\nBy improving coordination within UA and with external partners, ABEC will bring significant value to Alaska’s coastal and inland communities, economy and workforce.\n\nR/V Sikuliaq\n\nSikuliaq is arriving at Astoria, Oregon, today after completing a multi-beam echosounder system (MBES) patch test (an operational test to ensure the MBES is working properly). After fueling and bringing aboard stores, Sikuliaq will transit from Astoria to Newport to prepare for the next two projects.\n\nFirst, Dr. Franz Mueter (UAF/CFOS) will test Sikuliaq’s new Surface and Under Ice Trawl (SUIT) net and ensure the net is ready to be used operationally in November in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. Following this work, Dr. Ed Dever (OSU) will install and maintain moorings and deploy gliders as part of the National Science Foundation’s Ocean Observatories Initiative for the Endurance Array off the Oregon coast.\n\nActivities and Accomplishments\n\nLast week, Jennifer Harris and Wendy Huesties participated in the 2nd General Assembly of the Arctic Research Icebreaker Consortium, held in Lisbon, Portugal. An overview of ARICE was recently published by the European Commission.\n\nOn March 18, Doug Baird and Lauren Frisch represented Sikuliaq at the March Arctic Waterways Safety Committee meeting in Anchorage.\n\nCheryl Barnes (advisor Anne Beaudreau) was awarded the Northern Gulf of Alaska Applied Research Award.\n\nA number of students received awards at the recent American Fisheries Society Alaska Chapter meeting in Sitka. Chris Sergeant (advisor Jeff Falke) was awarded best student talk. Alyx Hoover was awarded best undergraduate poster. And, Noah Khalsa was the recipient of the Molly Ahlgren Scholarship Award.\n\nThe new five-year EPSCoR project will start field sampling. Last week, sites were selected and initial sampling was completed in Kachemak Bay. Full sampling in both Kachemak Bay and Lynn Canal will start in April and continue through September with the assistance of many graduate and undergraduate students.\n\nThe Ocean Acidification Research Center is celebrating the 10th anniversary of the 2009 Federal Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Act (FOARAM). The FOARAM Act got the ball rolling for US federal agencies to coordinate ocean acidification research as well as to spin up international collaborations.\n\nThe GAKOA surface mooring, located in Resurrection Bay, was successfully turned around this month. GAKOA is the first high-latitude mooring deployed to directly study ocean acidification and has the longest continuous record of OA observations in the state of Alaska.
