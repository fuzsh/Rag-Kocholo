        "text": "Author Archives:\n\nSomething Rotten!\n\nSomething Rotten! is the hilarious, brand-new musical directed and choreographed by theatre legend Casey Nicholaw (The Book of Mormon, Aladdin). Set in the 1590’s, Something Rotten! follows brothers Nick and Nigel as they try to top Shakespeare’s plays with their own acting troupe. When a soothsayer mistakes Hamlet for Omelette the Musical, chaos ensues, resulting in a very funny conclusion. Premiering on Broadway, the musical received mixed views from audiences and critics alike, and came away from the Tony Awards with only one win, despite nine nominations. A London transfer is predicted for the future and the show is also embarking on a US tour.\n\nMusic:\n\nKarey Kirkpatrick and Wayne Kirkpatrick\n\nLyrics:\n\nKarey Kirkpatrick and Wayne Kirkpatrick\n\nBook / libretto:\n\nKarey Kirkpatrick and John O'Farrell\n\nProducer:\n\nKevin McCollum\n\nDirector:\n\nCasey Nicholaw\n\nChoreography:\n\nCasey Nicholaw\n\nProductions\n\nOriginal Broadway Production\n\nSt. James Theatre - Opened 22 Apr 2015, closed 1 Jan 2017\n\nCast: Brian d’Arcy James (Nick Bottom), Christian Borle (William Shakespeare), John Cariani (Nigel Bottom), Heidi Blickenstaff (Bea), Brad Oscar (Nostradamus), Kate Reinders (Portia), Brooks Ashmanskas (Brother Jeremiah), Peter Bartlett (Lord Clapham/Judge), Gerry Vichi (Shylock), Michael James Scott (Minstrel) Replacements: Rob McClure (Nick), Will Chase (Shakespeare), Josh Grisetti (Nigel), Leslie Kritzer (Bea), Catherine Brunell (Portia), David Beach (Brother Jeremiah), Edward Hibbert (Lord Clapham), Andre Ward (Minstrel)\n\nWhat was your favourite production?

The Minstrel narrates the inventions and customs of the Renaissance and introduces Nick Bottom and Nigel, who run a theatre troupe. Rehearsing for Richard II whilst Shakespeare is opening Romeo and Juliet, Lord Clapham (a patron who raises funds for the troupe) arrives and announces that Shakespeare is also going to be doing Richard II. Outraged, Nick says that Shakespeare has already done Richard III and should not be going backwards. Ranting about his hatred for Shakespeare, Lord Clapham leaves, threatening to cut the troupe off unless they have a new play tomorrow.\n\nOn the way home, Nick encounters Shylock the Jew, who wants to help the troupe. Unfortunately, Shylock’s Jewish background would be illegal. Back at home, Bea, Nick’s wife, serves up dinner and ensures they are saving for a better life. She claims that she could help out with the troupe and goes out to do “jobs meant for men”, despite Nick’s protestations. As Nigel sleeps, Nick realises how much he hates Shakespeare and wishes there was a way to top him. Stealing money from his and Bea’s moneybox, he finds a soothsayer Nostradamus, who says that the next big thing in theatre will be a musical.\n\nLater, Nigel meets Portia, a Puritan and daughter of Brother Jeremiah. Nick tells him he should not pursue her as she is Puritan. Nick tells Nigel about the musical idea, but tells him he thought of it by himself. Nigel wants to do “The Brothers from Cornwall”, but Nick says it should be “The Black Death”. Lord Clapham arrives to watch the troupe perform the opening song, and hates it. Nigel begins to write a new play but is distracted by Portia. Soon, an invitation arrives for Nigel to go to “Shakespeare in the Park”. He tells Portia that he sent one of his sonnets to the Bard for feedback, and is now invited to his party. He asks if Portia will be his plus one.\n\nAt the after-party, Portia gets drunk and Shakespeare asks to read more of Nigel’s poems. Nick runs in and yells at the Bard for trying to steal Nigel’s work and at Nigel for going to the party. Brother Jeremiah enters to find a drunk Portia and admonishes her and Nigel. Nick goes back to Nostradamus with his remaining money. He asks him to predict Shakespeare’s next hit, and Nostradamus sees “Hamlet”, which he pronounces “Omelette”. He sees the main character as a Danish prince, but only the Danish part, which Nick takes to mean a Danish pastry. Getting excited about future dreams, he goes into a fantasy where he wins over Shakespeare.\n\nAct II begins with the Minstrel, who recaps the stress the Bottom brothers and Shakespeare face. A spy tells Shakespeare that Nick and Nigel are trying to steal his latest play, so he jumps at the chance to find out what it is. He disguises himself as Toby Belch and goes to audition for the brothers’ troupe. Meanwhile, the troupe are practising Omelette the Musical and Shylock has become their new investor and producer (although they have no name for that yet). Some of the actors are suspicious of Nostradamus, but Nick says he is a fellow actor. Shakespeare auditions and is hired, surprised to find out their musical is about eggs.\n\nNigel sneaks away to meet Portia, reading her another love poem. He worries about their future, but she reassures him that everyone will soon change their minds. He tells her he does not like Omelette the Musical. Brother Jeremiah arrives and takes Portia away to be shut in a tower for her sins. Saddened, Nigel becomes inspired to write a whole new play, which turns out to be Hamlet.\n\nNigel goes to the theatre the next day to tell Nick he does not like Omelette the Musical and is writing something else. Shakespeare takes this as an opportunity to get his hit play. On the street, Bea finds Nigel and tells him to trust Nick. Nick himself is having mixed feelings about Omelette, but learns that the whole town has lined up for tickets. Performing a huge number, Shakespeare reveals himself and sues the brothers. Quickly the troupe discover that Nostradamus is a soothsayer, and everyone is horrified.\n\nAt the courtroom, Shylock, Nigel, Nick and Nostradamus are being tried and Nick is sentenced to be beheaded. Bea enters, disguised as a lawyer, and forces Nick to confess that he stole from the moneybox and that he should not be beheaded as he has already lost his head. She makes a deal with Shakespeare that they will all be exiled to America. Portia arrives, having escaped, and joins the Bottoms in exile. Arriving in America, Nick hears about the opening of Hamlet. Nostradamus replies “I was this close”.\n\nSongs\n\nAct I\n\n“Welcome to the Renaissance” – Minstrel and Company\n\n“God, I Hate Shakespeare” – Nick, Nigel and the Troupe\n\n“Right Hand Man” Bea and Nick\n\n“God, I Hate Shakespeare (Reprise)” – Nick\n\n“A Musical” – Nostradamus, Nick and Company\n\n“The Black Death” – The Troupe\n\n“I Love the Way” – Portia and Nigel\n\n“Will Power” – The Bard and Company\n\n“Bottom’s Gonna Be on Top” – Nick, The Bard and Company\n\nAct II\n\n“Welcome to the Renaissance (Reprise)” – Minstrel\n\n“Hard to Be the Bard” – The Bard and Company\n\n“It’s Eggs!” – Nick and the Troupe\n\n“We See the Light” – Portia, Nigel, Brother Jeremiah, Nick and Company\n\n“To Thine Own Self” – Nigel, Nick, The Bard and the Troupe\n\n“Right Hand Man (Reprise)” – Bea\n\n“Something Rotten!” – The Troupe\n\n“Make an Omelette” – Nick and Company\n\n“To Thine Own Self (Reprise)” – Nick\n\n“Finale” – Company\n\nAwards\n\n2015 Tony Awards: Best Featured Actor in a Musical (Christian Borle)\n\n2015 Drama Desk Awards: Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical (Christian Borle)\n\nLicensing\n\nUK: Musical Theatre International\n\nUSA: Musical Theatre International\n\nJersey Boys\n\nJersey Boys is the hit Broadway musical that transferred to the West End in 2008 and made its home in London.

Tommy DeVito appears and explains that the song is a cover of one of The Four Seasons’ hit tracks. He begins to narrate the story of the band, detailing how the group began as “The Variety Trio” with Nick DeVito and Nick Massi. When they discovered Frankie Castelluccio, they took him under his wing and taught him everything he knows. During the early years of the band, Tommy went in and out of prison, Frankie changed his last name to Valli and the pair also developed a friendship with mob boss Gyp DeCarlo. Frankie also falls in love with a married Mary Delgado. As the band continue to struggle with their name and sound, Joe Pesci introduces them to Bob Gaudio.\n\nBob Gaudio becomes the narrator and informs the audience that Tommy did not “find” him, as he already had a hit with “Short Shorts”. Bob and Joe go to watch the band and are impressed with Frankie’s voice. Bob performs a song he’s recently written, with Frankie, Nick and Tommy joining in with vocals, bass and guitar. The four negotiate an agreement and Tommy becomes sceptical that Bob will be good for the band. Eventually, the four get producer Bob Crewe involved, who insists that they need to make a firm decision with their name and sound. After a night at The Four Seasons bowling alley, they name themselves and with Bob’s songs they are propelled into stardom. As they begin to tour, Bob loses his virginity and Frankie’s marriage to Mary comes to an end. They continue to huge success, but are soon approached by a loan shark who has come to claim money owed by Tommy.\n\nAct II begins with Nick Massi as the narrator. He explains that Bob was so focused on writing for the band that he couldn’t see they were in trouble. Tommy racked up numerous debts and a forgotten bill lands the boys in jail for the weekend, straining the relationship between Tommy and Bob. Tommy becomes increasingly jealous of Frankie’s success and his relationship with Bob and attempts to seduce Frankie’s new girlfriend, Lorraine, destroying their friendship. When the loan shark reappears, Frankie foes to Gyp DeCarlo for help. Gyp and the loan shark come to an agreement and Tommy is sent to Las Vegas, where the mob can keep an eye on him. The band cover the debt, but Nick declares that he wants out.\n\nFrankie then becomes the narrator and explains that he never understood why Nick wanted to leave. Frankie and Bob find replacements to keep the band a quartet, but Bob announces that Frankie should go solo as Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons. Frankie’s relationship with daughter Francine becomes strained when he breaks up with Lorraine, but his musical career continues with smash-hits. As Frankie and Bob continue to release hits and pay off Tommy’s debts, disaster falls as Francine dies from an overdose. Bob Crewe then appears to describe The Four Seasons’ 1990 induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, reuniting the original Seasons back to the stage.

More than anything, Sophie wishes to be walked down the aisle by her father, but must first find out who he is. In her mother’s old diary she discovers three men who could fit the description. Inviting Sam, Bill and Harry to her wedding, she hopes to figure out who it is when she meets them – the only problem is that she hasn’t quite told Donna, her mother, that they are coming!\n\nDonna’s best friends Tanya and Rosie arrive at the island for the celebrations and reminisce about their prior lives as girl group “Donna and the Dynamos”. Sophie’s potential fathers also arrive and she tells them not to tell Donna that she invited them. Donna sees her ex-lovers and leaves in tears. Meanwhile, Sophie thought that she would recognise her father on seeing him and attempts to tell Sky, but he tells her that he is the only man she could ever need.\n\nAt Sophie’s hen party, Donna and the Dynamos make a reappearance and perform “Super Trouper”. Sam, Bill and Harry walk into the party and the guests persuade them to stay. Sophie pulls Sam away for a chat, but when he asks why he has been invited, Sophie runs away to talk to Harry. Harry asks if he is Sophie’s father, and she tells him about inviting them all. When she talks to Bill, it is revealed that he has an Aunt Sophia who left all her money to Donna’s family. Bill finds out that Donna built the Greek tavern with money she inherited from a friend, and both think that means Bill is Sophie’s father.\n\nSophie asks Bill to walk her down the aisle, but he wants to talk to Donna first. No one yet knows that not even Donna knows who Sophie’s father is. Sophie pleads with the three not to tell Donna anything and they agree. After the party, Sam pulls Sophie aside and tells her that he thinks he is her father and promises to walk her down the aisle. Harry approaches Sophie and offers the same thing, also convinced that he is her father. Sophie leaves the party, more confused than ever.\n\nAct II begins with Sophie having a nightmare that her three fathers fight over the right to walk her down the aisle. Sophie is upset and Donna assumes that she wants to cancel the wedding. Sophie tells her that her own children will never grow up without knowing who their father is and storms from the room. When she leaves, Sam enters and tries to tell Donna that Sophie may have invited them. Donna reveals that she has always loved Sam, despite him leaving her to get married.\n\nBack at the beach, one of the bartenders, Pepper, begins to flirt with Tanya, and she rebuffs him with “Does Your Mother Know”. Sky discovers that Sophie invited Sam, Harry and Bill and accuses her of only wanting a large white wedding so that she can find out who her father is. He leaves, hating that she kept a secret from him. Sam enters and attempts to give Sophie some fatherly advice, telling her of his own failed marriage.\n\nHarry offers to pay for the wedding, and Donna and Harry reminisce about their fling. Donna helps Sophie dress and cannot believe how grown up she seems. She admits that her own mother disowned her when she was pregnant, and the pair reconcile, with Sophie asking Donna to walk her down the aisle. Sam once more appears and Donna asks him to leave, telling him that he broke her heart when she found out that he was engaged. It is revealed that the two are still very much in love.\n\nAs Rosie makes final preparations for the wedding, she comes across Bill, who is upset not to be walking Sophie down the aisle. Bill affirms his commitment to single life, but Rosie urges him to change his mind, with the pair ending up locked in a passionate embrace. As the wedding begins, Donna walks Sophie down the aisle and tells everyone that Sophie’s father is present, realising that it was her who invited them all. Everyone agrees that it really doesn’t matter who the father is, as Sophie loves all three. Harry is revealed to be in a committed gay relationship.\n\nSophie admits she is not ready to be married, and Sky agrees. Sam proposes to Donna and finds out that he called off the wedding to his fiancé because of Donna. Donna accepts his proposal and Sky and Sophie depart on a round-the-world trip. Mamma Mia! ends with a rousing reprise of “Mamma Mia!”, “Dancing Queen” and “Waterloo”, with Donna and the Dynamos appearing in ABBA style costumes.\n\nSongs\n\nAct I\n\n“Overture/Prologue” – Sophie\n\n“Honey, Honey” – Sophie, Ali and Lisa\n\n“Money, Money, Money” – Donna, Tanya, Rosie, Pepper and Company\n\n“Thank You for the Music” – Sophie, Sam, Harry and Bill\n\n“Mamma Mia” – Donna and Company\n\n“Chiquitita” – Tanya, Rosie and Donna\n\n“Dancing Queen” – Tanya, Rosie and Donna\n\n“Lay All Your Love on Me” – Sky, Sophie and Male Ensemble\n\n“Super Trouper” – Donna, Rosie, Tanya and Female Ensemble\n\n“Gimme!

Act I opens with the band featuring as backing for Robert Wace as The Ravens. Wace sings a toned-down version of “You Still Want Me”, which Dave Davies soon tires off and the band start their own rock riff with “I Gotta Move”.\n\nA stunt move, the band are soon snapped and signed, with their manager convincing them to change their name to something more sexy and memorable, eventually coming up with The Kinks. They are redesigned, refashioned and given an image that reflects their upbringing in Muswell Hill. Negotiating contracts, Ray doesn’t understand why much of his money is handed out to agents and managers when it’s him that’s writing the songs.\n\nThey begin to grow a firm fan-base and also begin to attract many female fans, and Ray meets Rasa after a particularly rollicking concert. As the musical continues, Ray struggles to cope in a world where money is the precedent and Dave spirals rapidly out of control, drinking a lot and trashing hotels. Rasa becomes pregnant and the pair marry, but their relationship is jeopardised by Ray Davies’ wayward mind. Soon, the band go from creating a unique sound to arguing through riotous gigs, with Dave Davies and Pete Quaife regularly falling out.\n\nSoon, Ray and Rasa’s relationship is in tatters, Ray and Dave have completely fallen out and Pete wants to leave the band. Woven throughout the musical are The Kinks’ hit songs, as well as the Davies’ rivalry, management issues, Ray’s marriage to Rasa and their being banned from America due to a dispute with the musicians’ union. Based on the real story of The Kinks, Sunny Afternoon discovers how the band rose to, and almost fell from, fame.\n\nSongs\n\nAct I\n\n“You Still Want Me” – Robert Wace and The Ravens\n\n“I Gotta Move/You Really Got Me” – Ray Davies, Dave Davies and Company\n\n“Just Can’t Go to Sleep” – Ray and Dave\n\n“Denmark Street” – Robert, Greenville Collins, Eddie Kassner, Larry Page and Company\n\n“A Well Respected Man” – Ray, Robert and Greenville\n\n“Dead End Street” – Mr and Mrs Davies and Company\n\n“Dedicated Follower of Fashion” – Ray, Dave and Company\n\n“You Really Got Me”- The Kinks\n\n“(This Time Tomorrow into) Set Me Free” – The Kinks\n\n“Till the End of the Day” – Dave and Company\n\n“This Strange Effect” – Ray and Rasa\n\n“Stop Your Sobbing” – Ray and Company\n\n“This is Where I Belong” – Ray and Dave\n\n“Where Have All the Good Times Gone/All Day and All of the Night” – The Kinks\n\nAct II\n\n“This Time Tomorrow” – Ray and Company\n\n“Maximum Consumption” – Ray\n\n“Sitting in My Hotel” – Ray\n\n“I Go to Sleep” – Rasa\n\n“I’m Not Like Everybody Else” – The Kinks\n\n“Too Much on My Mind/Tired of Waiting for You” – Ray, Rasa and Company\n\n“The Moneygoround” – Ray, Dave and Mick Avory\n\n“Sunny Afternoon” – Ray and Company\n\n“A Rock ‘n’ Roll Fantasy” – Ray, Pete Quaife, Dave, Mick, Rasa and Company\n\n“Days” – Robert, Greenville, Dave, Ray and Mick\n\n“A Long Way from Home” – Ray and Dave\n\n“Waterloo Sunset” – Ray and Company\n\n“Lola” – Ray, Dave and Company\n\nAwards\n\n2015 Olivier Awards: Best New Musical, Best Actor in a Musical (John Dagleish), Best Actor in a Supporting Role in a Musical (George Maguire), Outstanding Achievement in Music (Ray Davies)\n\nMotown the Musical\n\nMotown the Musical is the Broadway and West End musical that has enjoyed rave audience reviews since first opening in 2013.

Following the life of Berry Gordy, credited as the founder of Motown, the musical charts his journey from boxer to music mogul, discovering talents such as Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, The Jackson 5 and Smokey Robinson.\n\nOpening in 1983 at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, stars are gathered to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Motown with performances of popular songs founded in the era. Quickly, the musical rewinds to see a very young Berry Gordy watching his neighbours dancing in the streets of Detroit.

As the musical continues, Gordy gradually begins to discover The Supremes and Diana Ross, with whom he begins a tumultuous relationship.\n\nTowards the end of the musical, Gordy begins to falter as Motown becomes a second-class sound after the emerging era of pop. Struggling to get his records played at local record stations, Gordy also finds that his popular acts such as Diana Ross are straining to break free from his management.

Meanwhile, Mrs Wormwood is rushed to hospital before she jets off to Spain to compete in ballroom dancing. Thinking she is fat, she asks the doctor what is wrong and he tells her that she is about to have a baby. Giving birth, both Mrs Wormwood and Mr Wormwood make it very clear that the child is not wanted, especially because she’s a girl.\n\nFive years later, Matilda is super intelligent, an avid book reader and lives unhappily with her parents and brother. The Wormwoods frequently shout at her and Matilda often questions their morality. When Mr Wormwood attempts to sell some very used cars at a very disproportionate price, she retaliates by adding her mother’s peroxide to her father’s hair gel, leaving Mr Wormwood with luminescent green hair. Matilda regularly attends the library and talks to Mrs Phelps, telling her stories about an Acrobat and Escapologist.\n\nMatilda attends her first day of school, and the older children warn everyone that school is not what it seems. Matilda and her friends meet Miss Honey, who is in awe of Matilda’s intelligence and goes to the headmistress, Miss Trunchbull, to tell her that she thinks Matilda should be in the top class. Upon entering, Miss Trunchbull tells her how much she hates children, dismissing Miss Honey’s request by lecturing her on the importance of rules.\n\nBack at home, Mr Wormwood blames his loss of sale on Matilda and rips up one of her library books, causing her to superglue his hat. At school, Matilda and her friends learn of Miss Trunchbull’s scary punishments, including the chokey. After being accused of pouring treacle on Miss Trunchbull’s chair, Nigel is scared and hides from her. Matilda sticks up for him, telling Miss Trunchbull that Nigel suffers from narcolepsy and has been asleep for an hour, so it can’t have been him. Miss Trunchbull takes her anger out on young Amanda, spinning her by her pigtails and hammer-throwing her across the field.\n\nMiss Honey visits the Wormwood family to inform them that Matilda is very talented. Mrs Wormwood introduces her to her dance partner, Rudolpho, and tells her that she needs to lighten up. Miss Honey realises that the Wormwood’s do not care about their daughter. Meanwhile, Matilda returns to the library to tell Mrs Phelps more about the Acrobat and Escapologist. The Acrobat’s sister is a hammer-throwing champion who hates children and forces the acrobat to perform, even though she is pregnant. Matilda stops the story there. Returning to school, Bruce Bogtrotter has stolen a slice of Miss Trunchbull’s cake and she is out for blood. Punishing him by forcing him to eat the whole cake, the entire student body cheers him on, including Miss Honey. He eats the whole cake, enraging Miss Trunchbull, who drags him away to the chokey.\n\nAct II begins with Mr Wormwood telling the audience of the dangers of reading and Matilda’s friend Lavender letting the audience know that she plans to put a newt in Miss Trunchbull’s water jug. The schoolchildren gather together and dream of what life will be like when they are grown-ups. Matilda returns to the library to tell Mrs Phelps more of her story. The Acrobat performs the trick, despite her pregnancy, and injures herself, staying awake just long enough to give birth to their child. The Escapologist invites the Acrobat’s sister to move in and help him look after his daughter, but she is very cruel to the little girl. Matilda realises that she does not know how the story ends and promises to return to Mrs Phelps with more.\n\nWhen Mr Wormwood returns from work, pleased to have sold his worn-out cars to Russian dealers, Matilda scolds him for his deceit and he locks her in her bedroom. Matilda continues her story of the Acrobat and Escapologist, revealing that one night the Escapologist returns home to find his daughter weeping at the extent of the abuse. He promises that he will protect her, but the next morning he is gone.\n\nBack at school, Miss Trunchbull subjects the children to a gruelling lesson of physical education, in an attempt to discover who is rebelling against her. When she finds the newt that Lavender placed in the jug, she accuses Eric and begins to punish him. Matilda colds Miss Trunchbull, who begins to shout at her and Matilda soon discovers that she can move objects with her mind, tipping the water jug over and onto Miss Trunchbull. Terrified of the newt, Miss Trunchbull leaves and Miss Honey sends the children home. After Matilda shows Miss Honey her powers, Miss Honey invites her over for tea.\n\nAt Miss Honey’s small and humble home, she tells Matilda of her childhood and the abusive aunt who looked after her when her parents died. As she tells the story, she produces a scarf that Matilda recognises from her own tales of the Acrobat and the Escapologist. She realises that her story is in fact true, and is the story of Miss Honey’s childhood, with the wicked aunt being Miss Trunchbull. Soon, she realises that Miss Trunchbull must have killed Magnus, Miss Honey’s father, out of fear of what he might do.\n\nMatilda returns to school, and Miss Trunchbull conducts a spelling test, informing the children that if they misspell a word, they will be sent to the chokey. She issues made-up words to ensure that they will spell them wrong. All the children begin to misspell words, telling her that she can’t take them all to the chokey. Matilda begins to use her powers to write on the blackboard, writing that it is the ghost of Magnus returning and demanding that she gives Miss Honey back her house. Miss Trunchbull runs away, never to be heard of again. A few days later, the will of Miss Honey’s parents is found, leaving all of their money to her. Miss Honey becomes headmistress and asks the Wormwoods if Matilda can live with her.\n\nSongs\n\nAct I\n\n“Overture” – Orchestra\n\n“Miracle” – Children, Entertainer, Doctor, Mrs Wormwood, Mr Wormwood and Matilda\n\n“Naughty” – Matilda\n\n“School Song” – Children and Company\n\n“Pathetic” – Miss Honey\n\n“The Hammer” – Miss Trunchbull, Miss Honey and Children\n\n“Loud” – Mrs Wormwood, Rudolpho and Company\n\n“This Little Girl” – Miss Honey\n\n“Bruce” – Children\n\nAct II\n\n“Telly” – Mr Wormwood, Michael\n\n“Entr’acte – Orchestra\n\n“When I Grow Up” – Children, Miss Honey, Matilda and Company\n\n“I’m Here” – Matilda and Escapologist\n\n“The Smell of Rebellion” – Miss Trunchbull and Children\n\n“Quiet” – Matilda\n\n“My House” – Miss Honey, Escapologist\n\n“Revolting Children” – Children and Company\n\n“When I Grow Up (Reprise)” – Company\n\nAwards\n\n2014 WhatsOnStage Awards: Best West End Show\n\n2013 Tony Awards: Best Book of a Musical (Dennis Kelly), Best Featured Actor in a Musical (Gabriel Ebert), Best Scenic Design of a Musical (Rob Howell), Best Lighting Design of a Musical (Hugh Vanstone), Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre (Sophia Gennusa, Oona Laurence, Bailey Ryon, Milly Shapiro)\n\n2013 Outer Critics’ Circle Awards: Outstanding Book of a Musical, Outstanding Set Design (Rob Howell)\n\n2013 Drama Desk Awards: Outstanding Musical, Outstanding Book of a Musical (Dennis Kelly), Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical (Bertie Carvel), Outstanding Lyrics (Tim Minchin), Outstanding Set Design (Rob Howell)\n\n2013 New York Drama Critics’ Circle Awards: Best Musical\n\n2013 Theatre World Awards: Theatre World Award (Bertie Carvel)\n\n2012 Olivier Awards: Best New Musical, Best Actor in a Musical (Bertie Carvel), Best Actress in a Musical (Cleo Demetriou, Kerry Ingram, Eleanor Worthington Cox, Sophia Kiely), Best Director (Matthew Warchus), Best Theatre Choreographer (Peter Darling), Best Set Design (Rob Howell), Best Sound Design (Simon Baker)\n\n2012 WhatsOnStage Awards: Best New Musical, London Newcomer of the Year (Tim Minchin), Best Choreographer (Peter Darling), Best Set Designer (Rob Howell)\n\n2011 Evening Standard Awards: Best Musical\n\n2011 Theatre Awards UK: Best Musical, Best Performance (Bertie Carvel)\n\n2011 Critics’ Circle Theatre Awards: Best Musical\n\nLicensing\n\nUK: Musical Theatre International\n\nUSA: Musical Theatre International\n\nMurder Ballad\n\nMurder Ballad is the startling Off Broadway musical that makes its way to London’s West End.

Following Sara, the musical focuses on her love-struck relationship with edgy ex-boyfriend Tom and safe, reliable husband, Michael. Narrated by a darkly sexy bartender, she documents Sara’s torrid affair with the dangerous Tom.\n\nAccompanied by a range of rock songs, the Narrator takes the audience between Sara’s passionate relationships with Tom, to a more intimate, love-filled lust after quiet poet Michael. An actor and bartender, Tom is much more gritty and she is instantly drawn back to him. When the relationship ultimately splits, Sara finds herself back in the safe arms of Michael.\n\nBut Sara quickly begins to long for the danger her old life brought and begins to struggle with her downtown past and uptown future. Is it worth risking everything for the one that got away?

Trapped in a controlling marriage with husband Earl, she lives her life baking and selling pies with unusual titles. Jenna dreams of running away from her marriage, slowly gathering up the money to do so. Pinning her hopes of winning a large sum on the annual pie contest in a nearby town, she begins to dream big. Quickly her dreams are dashed when she discovers that she is pregnant with her husband’s baby.\n\nWith Jenna’s only friends being co-waitresses Becky, Dawn and regular customer Joe, her life changes when she meets her new physician Dr Jim Pomatter. Dr Pomatter has moved to the new town to accommodate his wife, who is completing her residency at the local hospital. Instantly, the pair are attracted to each other, and over the course of pre-natal appointments, Jenna and Dr Pomatter develop an attraction towards each other. On an unlikely evening, Jenna initiates an affair. When she is given a journal, Jenna begins to document her life and begins to reveal her thoughts through baking some increasingly peculiarly-named pies.\n\nMeanwhile, after some persuasion, her fellow waitresses decide to embark upon romance themselves. Dawn meets Ogie, who both become so smitten with each other that they almost immediately vow eternal devotion. And whilst Becky’s marriage is not entirely fulfilling, due to her much older husband being very ill, her endless disputes with Joe’s Diner’s manager Cal lead to a more interesting romance of her own.\n\nAfter Jenna gives birth to her baby girl, she gains the courage to leave her husband and begins to believe in herself a bit more. When leaving the hospital, Dr Pomatter chases after her, but she decides to end that too.

Inspired by rap and hip-hop, Hamilton follows the story of America’s founding father Alexander Hamilton, documenting his tumultuous relationship with Eliza Schuyler and his untimely death at the hands of Aaron Burr. Based on Ron Chernow’s book ‘Alexander Hamilton’, Miranda uses his real life story with a pinch of dramatic license to create one of Broadway’s biggest musicals. Unlike standard shows, Hamilton is composed of rap, ballads, hip-hop and musical theatre to create a smash-hit, record-breaking production.\n\nMusic:\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda\n\nLyrics:\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda\n\nBook / libretto:\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda\n\nBased on:\n\nRon Chernow's novel 'Alexander Hamilton'\n\nProducer:\n\nJeffrey Seller, The Public Theater, Sander Jacobs and Jill Furman\n\nDirector:\n\nThomas Kail\n\nChoreography:\n\nAndy Blankenbuehler\n\nProductions\n\nOriginal Broadway Production\n\nRichard Rodgers Theatre - Opened 6 Aug 2015, closed 21 May 2017\n\nCast: Lin-Manuel Miranda (Alexander Hamilton), Leslie Odom, Jr (Aaron Burr), Phillipa Soo (Eliza Schuyler), Renee Elise Goldsberry (Angelica Schuyler), Daveed Diggs (Marquis de Lafayette/Thomas Jefferson), Christopher Jackson (George Washington), Jonathan Groff (King George III), Jasmine Cephas Jones (Peggy Schuyler/Maria Reynolds), Anthony Ramos (John Laurens/Philip Hamilton), Okieriete Onaodowan (Hercules Mulligan/James Madison) Replacements: Javier Munoz (Hamilton), Lexi Lawson (Eliza), Rory O’Malley (King George), Brandon Victor Dixon (Burr), Mandy Gonzalez (Angelica)\n\nUS Tour (2017)\n\nUS Tour - Opened 2 Mar 2017, closed 29 Nov 2018\n\nCast: Miguel Cervantes (Alexander Hamilton), Joshua Henry (Aaron Burr), Ari Asfar (Eliza Schuyler), Karen Olivo (Angelica Schuyler), Chris Lee (Marquis de Lafayette/Thomas Jefferson), Jonathan Kirkland (George Washington), Alexander Gemignani (King George III), Samantha Marie Ware (Peggy Schuyler/Maria Reynolds), Jose Ramos (John Laurens/Philip Hamilton), Wallace Smith (Hercules Mulligan/James Madison)\n\nWhat was your favourite production?

In 1776, Hamilton seeks out Aaron Burr but rebuffs his philosophy, instead joining the company of three revolutionaries: John Laurens, Marquis de Lafayette and Hercules Mulligan. Impressing them with his speech skills, the quartet begin dreaming of their cause.\n\nMeanwhile, the Schuyler sisters roam the streets of New York as the spirit of revolution builds in the air. A message arrives from King George in England, reminding them that he is willing and able to fight for the cause of the colonists. When the revolution begins, Hamilton, Burr and their friends join the army, who end up retreating from New York City. George Washington realises he needs help and enlists Hamilton as his right hand man, despite Hamilton wanting to fight on the front lines.\n\nIn 1780, the men attend a ball, where Eliza Schuyler instantly falls in love with Hamilton, as does Angelica. Angelica swallows her feelings for the sake of her younger sister, and Eliza and Hamilton soon marry. Burr privately admits to Hamilton that he’s having an affair with the wife of a British officer and Hamilton advises him to take action. Burr chooses to wait and see what his life has in store for him.\n\nAs revolution is rife, Hamilton asks Washington to give him command, which is given to Charles Lee instead. This proves catastrophic at the Battle of Monmouth, where Lee orders a retreat. Lafayette is promoted to replace Lee, which causes him to spread rumours about Washington. Hamilton is offended and Laurens offers to duel Lee for him. Washington finds out that Lee has been injured and orders Hamilton to return home to Eliza, who tells him that she is pregnant with his child. Lafayette convinces France to join the American cause, and the war begins to play in their favour. They realise that they need Hamilton and reluctantly order him back to cut off the British navy at Yorktown.\n\nAfter days of fighting, the British surrender at Yorktown, and King George asks how the rebels expect to successfully govern their people. Soon, Hamilton’s son Philip is born and Burr’s daughter, Theodosia, is also born. Hamilton and Burr return to New York to pursue careers as lawyers and Burr becomes increasingly annoyed by Hamilton’s constant success. When Hamilton is chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, Burr refuses to assist him. Hamilton is soon chosen to be Treasury Secretary for the newly appointed President Washington.\n\nIn 1789, Thomas Jefferson returns to the US as Secretary of State. Madison asks for Jefferson to help him stop Hamilton’s financial plan, which Madison believes will give the government too much control. Washington pulls Hamilton aside to force him to figure out a compromise. When he returns home, Angelica advises Hamilton to convince Jefferson that his plan is a good idea. Angelica and Eliza ask him to accompany them on a vacation, but he refuses, saying he needs to work.\n\nWhen alone, Hamilton is visited by Maria Reynolds, who seduces him and they begin an affair. Her husband soon finds out and begins to blackmail Hamilton, who continues the affair. Hamilton discusses his financial plans with Jefferson and Madison, resulting in the Compromise of 1790, which moved the US capital from New York to Washington D.C. Burr is envious of Hamilton’s power and wishes he had the same. Burr switches political parties and beats Eliza’s father in a race for his seat in the Senate, causing Hamilton and Burr to fall out. Burr, Jefferson and Madison become irritated that Washington continues to back Hamilton, and they look for a way to damage Hamilton’s reputation.\n\nWashington informs Hamilton that Jefferson has resigned to run for president, and he will be stepping down in the role. King George receives the news and gets ready for the US to fall under John Adams’ leadership. Adams and Hamilton fall out and destroy their party, whilst Burr, Jefferson and Madison believe that they have discovered Hamilton embezzling government money. In reality, the money comes from his affair with Maria Reynolds and Hamilton tells them of his affair, begging them not to tell anyone. Concerned that they know his secret, Hamilton publishes a public admission about the affair in hopes to save his political legacy. However, his reputation is destroyed and Eliza burns all of their letters, ruining Hamilton’s chance of being redeemed in the future.\n\nAfter a number of years, Hamilton’s son Philip challenges a man to a duel after hearing him slander his father, but is shot. Philip dies and Hamilton begs for Eliza’s forgiveness. In 1800, Jefferson and Burr are tied in the race for president and Hamilton throws his support behind Jefferson, who ends up winning by a landslide. Burr challenges Hamilton to a duel and shoots him in the chest. Burr laments that even though he survived the duel, he is cursed to be the villain, only to be remembered as the man who killed Alexander Hamilton.\n\nAs the musical draws to a close, the company summarise Hamilton’s life, noting that no one has any control over how they will be remembered. Washington, Jefferson and Madison all praise Hamilton’s work. Eliza reveals that she fought to save her husband’s legacy, by opening an orphanage. As she dies, Hamilton shows her everyone that will care for her and protect her legacy, as she did for him.\n\nSongs\n\nAct I\n\n“Alexander Hamilton” – Company\n\n“Aaron Burr, Sir” – Hamilton, Burr, Laurens, Lafayette and Mulligan\n\n“My Shot” – Hamilton, Laurens, Lafayette, Mulligan, Burr and Company\n\n“The Story of Tonight” – Hamilton, Laurens, Lafayette, Mulligan\n\n“The Schuyler Sisters” – Angelica, Eliza, Peggy, Burr and Company\n\n“Farmer Refuted” – Seabury and Hamilton\n\n“You’ll Be Back” – King George\n\n“Right Hand Man” – Washington, Hamilton, Burr and Company\n\n“A Winter’s Ball” – Burr, Hamilton and Company\n\n“Helpless” – Eliza, Hamilton and Company\n\n“Satisfied” – Angelica, Eliza, Hamilton and Company\n\n“The Story of Tonight (Reprise)” – Laurens, Lafayette, Mulligan, Hamilton and Burr\n\n“Wait For It” – Burr and Company\n\n“Stay Alive” – Hamilton, Washington, Lee, Laurens, Lafayette, Mulligan, Eliza, Angelica and Company\n\n“Ten Duel Commandments” – Laurens, Hamilton, Lee, Burr and Company\n\n“Meet Me Inside” – Washington, Hamilton and Company\n\n“That Would Be Enough” – Eliza and Hamilton\n\n“Guns and Ships” – Lafayette, Burr, Washington and Company\n\n“History Has Its Eyes on You” – Washington and Company\n\n“Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)” – Hamilton, Lafayette, Laurens, Mulligan, Washington and Company\n\n“What Comes Next?” – King George\n\n“Dear Theodosia” – Burr and Hamilton\n\n“Non-Stop” – Hamilton, Burr, Eliza, Angelica, Washington and Company\n\nAct II\n\n“What’d I Miss” – Jefferson, Burr, Madison, Washington, Hamilton and Company\n\n“Cabinet Battle #1” – Jefferson, Hamilton, Washington and Madison\n\n“Take a Break” – Eliza, Philip, Hamilton and Angelica\n\n“Say No to This” – Hamilton, Maria Reynolds, James Reynolds and Company\n\n“The Room Where It Happens” – Burr, Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and Company\n\n“Schuyler Defeated” – Philip, Eliza, Hamilton and Burr\n\n“Cabinet Battle #2” – Washington, Jefferson, Hamilton and Madison\n\n“Washington on Your Side” – Burr, Jefferson and Madison\n\n“One Last Time” – Washington, Hamilton and Company\n\n“I Know Him” – King George\n\n“The Adams Administration” – Burr, Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison and Company\n\n“We Know” – Hamilton, Burr, Jefferson and Madison\n\n“Hurricane” – Hamilton and Company\n\n“The Reynolds Pamphlet” – Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison, Burr, Angelica and Company\n\n“Burn” – Eliza\n\n“Blow Us All Away” – Philip, Hamilton, Eacker, Dolly, Martha and Company\n\n“Stay Alive (Reprise)” – Philip, Hamilton, Eliza, Doctor and Company\n\n“It’s Quiet Uptown” – Angelica, Hamilton, Eliza and Company\n\n“The Election of 1800” – Jefferson, Madison, Burr, Hamilton and Company\n\n“Your Obedient Servant” – Burr and Hamilton\n\n“Best of Wives and Best of Women” – Eliza and Hamilton\n\n“The World Was Wide Enough” – Burr, Hamilton and Company\n\n“Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story” – Eliza, Washington, Burr, Jefferson, Madison, Angelica, Laurens, Lafayette, Mulligan and Company\n\nAwards\n\n2016 Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Book of a Musical (Lin-Manuel Miranda), Best Original Score (Lin-Manuel Miranda), Best Actor in a Musical (Leslie Odom, Jr), Best Featured Actor in a Musical (Daveed Diggs), Best Featured Actress in a Musical (Renee Elise Goldsberry), Best Costume Design of a Musical (Paul Tazewell), Best Lighting Design of a Musical (Howell Binkley), Best Direction of a Musical (Thomas Kail), Best Choreography (Andy Blankenbuehler), Best Orchestrations (Alex Lacamoire)\n\n2016 Drama League Awards: Outstanding Production of a Broadway or Off Broadway Musical, Distinguished Performance (Lin-Manuel Miranda)\n\n2016 Pulitzer Prize: Drama (Lin-Manuel Miranda)\n\n2016 Grammy Awards: Best Musical Theater Album\n\n2016 Fred and Adele Astaire Awards: Best Choreographer (Andy Blankenbuehler)\n\n2016 Dramatists Guild of America Awards: Frederick Loewe Award for Dramatic Composition (Lin-Manuel Miranda)\n\n2016 Edward M.

Barrie proves to be a great friend and father figure to the boys, and his antics with the children quickly begin to inspire him to write a play about boys who never wish to grow up, with youngest son Peter provides particular inspiration. Soon, people begin to question his relationship with Sylvia, although it remains fiercely platonic. His wife Mary divorces him and Sylvia’s mother starts to object at the amount of time Barrie spends with the family.\n\nSylvia becomes increasingly weak after an illness, but Barrie continues to play with the boys, taking the adventures they experience and turning them into Peter Pan. Presenting his idea to Producer Charles Frohman, Frohman reluctantly agrees to put on the play, despite believing that it will not appeal to his upper-class theatregoers. Barrie takes it on himself to disperse children from a local orphanage throughout the audience, which causes the surrounding adults to delight in the play. Proving a huge success, Peter Llewelyn Davies arrives to watch the show and realises that it is about him and his brothers; George, Michael and Jack.\n\nToo ill to attend the theatre, Barrie puts on a production for Sylvia in her home, gathering the actors, props and musicians in her house. At the end, Peter Pan points to the doors to signify that she should go to Neverland. She takes the hand of her boys and walks into Neverland, implying her death. At Sylvia’s funeral, Barrie discovers that her will reads that he should take care of the Llewelyn Davies boys, which he is overjoyed at. Barrie and Peter form a bond unlike any other.\n\nSongs\n\nAct I\n\n“Prologue” – Orchestra\n\n“If the World Turned Upside Down” – J. M. Barrie\n\n“All of London is Here Tonight” – Frohman, J. M.

The musical then quickly rewinds to 1958 and to a 16-year-old Carole telling her mother, Genie, that she wants to become a songwriter. Genie is opposed to her daughter’s desires, but Carole goes ahead with her plans to try and sell a song to music publisher Don Kirshner. At 1650 Broadway, she sings her new song “It Might As Well Rain Until September”, and Don says he will take it and hopes she has others.\n\nAt Queen’s College, Carole meets lyricist Gerry Goffin, and together the pair begin to collaborate both musically and romantically, which reaps the rewards for both of them. When Don asks to hear their new song, Carole confesses to Gerry that she is pregnant and Gerry asks her to marry him. After this, their new song “Some Kind of Wonderful” takes on a whole new meaning, and The Drifters record a hit.\n\nCarole and Gerry get an office at 1650 Broadway, where Carole meets lyricist Cynthia Weil, who is looking for a composer. Whilst Gerry and Carole practice “Take Good Care of My Baby”, composer Barry Mann enters, meets Cynthia and the pair begin their own collaboration. As they begin to work, sparks fly and Don asks both of the couples to present him with a song for The Shirelles. Carole and Gerry present “Will You Love Me Tomorrow” and Cynthia and Barry perform “He’s Sure the Boy I Love”. Don chooses the former and the song rockets to the top of the charts. Soon, the couples are firing out an amazing selection of songs, despite being quite competitive. When Gerry and Carole tape a TV special of their new song with Janelle Woods, Gerry confesses that he is restless in the pair’s marriage and wants to sleep with Janelle. Not wanting to lie about it, he leaves Carole stunned and she moves to sing Janelle’s song.\n\nAct II begins with Carole in a recording studio, performing a demo of “Chains”, whilst Gerry is away with Janelle. Nick, a guitarist, asks Carole to come and sing for him, but she declines as she does not want to be a singer. Carole talks to Cynthia about Gerry, as she is also having problems with Barry and Carole decides to split from Gerry. After their meeting, Gerry appears and has a breakdown which sends him to hospital. He tells Carole he will end the affair with Janelle, and Carole suggests they make a new start in the suburbs.\n\nDon, Barry and Cynthia arrive to visit the couple and play them their new song, which makes Gerry realise that he needs to go back to the city. Once he has gone, Barry and Cynthia reveal that they have seen him with singer Marilyn Wald. Carole goes to Marilyn’s house and Gerry is there. She makes the decision to end her marriage. Soon, Carole begins to sing and decides to move to Los Angeles to pursue a new career, leaving her friends behind.\n\nIn Los Angeles, she records her legendary album “Tapestry”, including “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman”, which she originally wrote with Gerry. The album is a smash-hit and the action flashes forward to Carole King’s Carnegie Hall concert. Gerry knocks on the door with an apology for the way he treated her and wishes her well. Carole sits at the piano and performs “Beautiful”.\n\nSongs\n\nAct I\n\n“Overture” – Orchestra\n\n“So Far Away” – Carole\n\n“Oh!

The Dreamettes feature best friends Effie White, Deena Jones and Lorrell Robinson, with Effie as lead singer. Singing a song written by Effie’s brother C.C., the group unfortunately lose the contest, but are met by Curtis Taylor, Jr, a used-car salesman.\n\nOnce Curtis becomes the group’s manager, he convinces James “Thunder” Early to let them be his backing singers, becoming a huge success. Soon, Curtis persuades Jimmy and the Dreamettes to move away from Rhythm and Blues and over to pop, where they are usurped by white groups. Curtis begins to bribe DJs to play Jimmy’s next single, which becomes a major hit.\n\nHowever, things begin to get slightly more complicated once Effie and Curtis begin dating, and Jimmy and Lorrell begin an illicit affair. Curtis soon replaces Marty as Jimmy’s manager, who also helped write the songs for the group. Quickly, Curtis tries to transform Jimmy into a Perry Como-esque singer, whilst establishing the Dreamettes as their own act. Renaming the girls The Dreams, Curtis puts Deena as lead singer, due to her more appealing looks and pop vocals. Effie is hurt, but C.C. convinces her to go along with the plan. The Dreams make their debut in Ohio, with Curtis informing Deena that he’s going to make her the star.\n\nOver the years, Deena becomes a superstar and The Dreams become a huge pop success, but Effie starts to miss rehearsals, becoming temperamental and suspecting Deena and Curtis of an affair. Lorrell attempts to keep the peace, but the group soon splits and Curtis replaces Effie with Michelle Morris. The Dreams leave Effie behind, despite her heartbroken appeal.\n\nIn Act II, the action moves forward to 1972, where Deena Jones and the Dreams have become the country’s leading pop group. Deena has married Curtis and C.C. is in love with Michelle, although Jimmy has long since disappeared. Effie is back in Chicago and it is revealed that she was missing shows and rehearsals due to being pregnant with Curtis’ child, who she now looks after by herself. Marty has become her manager and is attempting to help her make a comeback.\n\nDeena decides that she wants to pursue an acting career, without Curtis as her manager. C.C. has become annoyed by Curtis’ constant rearrangements of his songs and the tension begins to build. Whilst waiting to perform at a fundraiser, Deena Jones and the Dreams meet Jimmy Early once more, and Jimmy finds himself locked in another argument with Lorrell. With Lorrell in tears and Deena attempting to comfort her, Michelle convinces C.C. to reconcile with Effie, and Jimmy’s set falls apart on stage.\n\nC.C. and Effie meet at a recording studio, and C.C. apologises to Effie for hijacking her career. Effie records C.C.’s emotional “One Night Only” ballad, which begins to climb the charts, much to the chagrin of Curtis, who threatens legal action. As Curtis makes arrangements to ruin Effie’s career, Effie and Deena reconcile too, and Deena learns that Effie and Curtis share a child. Realising the kind of man Curtis really is, Deena finds the courage to leave him. Once “One Night Only” has become a hit, Deena leaves The Dreams to become an actress. For the final number of The Dreams’ farewell concert, Effie joins the girls on stage.\n\nSongs\n\nAct I\n\n“I’m Lookin’ for Something” – The Stepp Sisters, Marty and Company\n\n“Goin’ Downtown” – Little Albert and The Tru-Tones\n\n“Takin’ the Long Way Home” – Tiny Joe Dixon\n\n“Move (You’re Steppin’ on My Heart)” – Effie, Deena and Lorrell\n\n“Fake Your Way to the Top” – Jimmy, Effie, Deena and Lorrell\n\n“Cadillac Car” – Curtis, Jimmy, C.C., Marty, Effie, Deena and Lorrell\n\n“Cadillac Car (One the Road)” – Company\n\n“Cadillac Car (In the Recording Studio)” – Jimmy, Effie, Deena and Lorrell\n\n“Cadillac Car (Reprise)” – Dave and the Sweethearts\n\n“Steppin’ to the Bad Side” – Curtis, Jimmy, C.C., Wayne, Lorrell, Effie, Deena and Company\n\n“Party, Party” – Effie, Curtis, Jimmy, Lorrell and Company\n\n“I Want You Baby” – Jimmy, Effie, Deena and Lorrell\n\n“Family” – Effie, C.C., Jimmy, Effie, Deena and Lorrell\n\n“Dreamgirls” – Deena, Lorrell and Effie\n\n“Press Conference” – Deena, Curtis and Company\n\n“Only the Beginning” – Curtis and Effie\n\n“Heavy/Stop Bringing Us Down” – Deena, Lorrell, Effie and Curtis\n\n“Drivin’ Down the Strip” – Jimmy\n\n“It’s All Over” – Effie, Curtis, C.C., Deena, Lorrell, Jimmy and Michelle\n\n“And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going” – Effie\n\n“Love Love Me Baby” – Deena, Lorrell and Michelle\n\nAct II\n\n“Act II Opening” – Deena, Lorrell, Michelle, Curtis, C.C. and Jimmy\n\n“I Am Changing” – Effie\n\n“One More Picture Please” – Lorrell, Michelle, C.C., Curtis and Company\n\n“When I First Saw You” – Curtis and Deena\n\n“Got to Be Good Times” – The Five Tuxedos\n\n“Ain’t No Party” – Lorrell and Jimmy\n\n“I Meant You No Harm” – Jimmy\n\n“Quintette” – Lorrell, Deena, C.C. and Michelle\n\n“The Rap” – Jimmy\n\n“Firing of Jimmy” – Jimmy, Curtis, Lorrell and Company\n\n“I Miss You Old Friend” – Les Styles, Marty, C.C. and Effie\n\n“One Night Only” – Effie and Company\n\n“One Night Only (Disco)” – Deena, Lorrell, Michelle, Curtis and Company\n\n“I’m Somebody” – Deena, Lorrell and Michelle\n\n“Chicago/Faith in Myself” – Effie, C.C., Curtis, Deena and Marty\n\n“Listen” – Deena and Effie\n\n“Hard to Say Goodbye, My Love” – Deena, Lorrell and Michelle\n\n“Dreamgirls (Reprise)” – Effie, Deena, Lorrell and Michelle\n\nAwards\n\n1982 Tony Awards: Best Book of a Musical (Tom Eyen), Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical (Ben Harney), Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical (Jennifer Holliday), Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical (Cleavant Derricks), Best Choreography (Michael Bennett and Michael Peters), Best Lighting Design (Tharon Musser)\n\n1982 Drama Desk Awards: Outstanding Book of a Musical (Tom Eyen), Outstanding Actress in a Musical (Jennifer Holliday), Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical (Cleavant Derricks), Outstanding Set Design (Robin Wagner), Outstanding Lighting Design (Tharon Musser)\n\n1983 Grammy Awards: Best Cast Show Album, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance (Jennifer Holliday)\n\nLicensing\n\nUK: Tams-Witmark\n\nUSA: Tams-Witmark\n\nAladdin the Musical\n\nAladdin the Musical is the award-winning musical that continues to wow audiences on Broadway and the West End, with its memorable music, spectacular sets and glittering performances.

Following street urchin Aladdin, who is used to stealing from the market place, he only wishes that he could make his mother proud by doing something more worthwhile. With help from his friends; Kassim, Omar and Babkak, Aladdin attempts to earn some money by dancing in the streets, where he bumps into a disguised Princess Jasmine.\n\nJasmine is confined within the palace walls day after day, and longs to be free to explore her city. With her father, the Sultan, attempting to organise an arranged marriage between her and a rich Prince, she just wants to run away. Disguising herself, she escapes to the market place, where she runs into Aladdin. The pair immediately fall under each other’s spell, but when some angry guards appear, they are forced to flee to Aladdin’s humble home. Together, they dream of a better life where they are free to do as they wish.\n\nMeanwhile, evil Jafar and his sidekick Iago are plotting ways to overthrow the Sultan, and they come across the story of a magic lamp locked away in the Cave of Wonders. Inside this lamp is rumoured to be a magical Genie who can grant any wish, but the only person that can enter the legendary cave is an alleged Diamond in the Rough. Iago asks the spirits to show him the mysterious Diamond, and Aladdin is revealed.\n\nJafar and Iago go to the market place and quickly persuade Aladdin to help them, by telling him that it will finally be a way to make his mother proud, and they will make him rich for his efforts. Aladdin goes into the Cave of Wonders and discovers the magic lamp. Although he has been told not to touch anything else in the cave, his curiosity gets the better of him and he picks up some golden treasures. When the cave entrance slams shut, Aladdin has nothing to do and ends up rubbing the magic lamp. Soon, Genie appears and says he will grant Aladdin any three wishes his heart desires.\n\nAladdin first wishes to be free from the cave, followed by a wish to become a Prince to win the heart of Princess Jasmine. Disguised as Prince Ali, Aladdin enters the palace and impresses the Sultan, much to the annoyance of Jafar. Unfortunately, Aladdin comes across as far too cocky in his new guise, and Jasmine is less than impressed. Attempting to woo her, Aladdin takes her on a magic carpet ride, revealing his true identity.\n\nUnfortunately, Jafar soon realises Prince Ali’s true identity, and stealing the lamp, has Aladdin and his friends locked up in the palace dungeon. But they all work together to overthrow the nasty Jafar, and the Sultan agrees that Aladdin can marry Jasmine as thanks for saving the city. As his third and final wish, Aladdin wishes that Genie can be free of living in the lamp!\n\nSongs\n\nAct I\n\n“Overture” – Orchestra\n\n“Arabian Nights” – Genie and Company\n\n“One Jump Ahead” – Aladdin and Company\n\n“One Jump Ahead (Reprise)” – Aladdin\n\n“Proud of Your Boy” – Aladdin\n\n“These Palace Walls” – Jasmine and Female Attendants\n\n“Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim” – Aladdin, Kassim, Omar, Babkak, Jasmine and Company\n\n“A Million Miles Away” – Aladdin and Jasmine\n\n“Diamond in the Rough” – Jafar, Iago and Aladdin\n\n“Friend Like Me” – Genie and Company\n\n“Act One Finale” – Genie and Aladdin\n\nAct II\n\n“Prince Ali” – Genie, Kassim, Omar, Babkak and Company\n\n“A Whole New World” – Aladdin and Jasmine\n\n“High Adventure” – Kassim, Omar, Babkak and Company\n\n“Somebody’s Got Your Back” – Genie, Aladdin, Kassim, Omar and Babkak\n\n“Proud of Your Boy (Reprise)” – Aladdin\n\n“Prince Ali (Sultan Reprise)” – Sultan and Company\n\n“Prince Ali (Jafar Reprise)” – Jafar\n\n“Finale Ultimo” – Company\n\nAwards\n\n2014 Tony Awards: Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical (James Monroe Iglehart)\n\n2014 Drama Desk Awards: Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical (James Monroe Iglehart)\n\nAn American in Paris\n\nAn American in Paris is an all-new dance musical, based on the 1951 Academy Award winning film of the same name, starring Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron.
