        "text": "Hugh Grant is an actor starring in the Honor Among Thieves movie, released in 2023.[1] He plays Forge Fitzwilliam, a rogue, a former member of the thieves, a conman, and the new Lord of Neverwinter, in a villainous role.\n\nCareer[]\n\nA star of many period dramas and romantic comedies, Hugh Grant has also appeared in fantasy and science-fiction genre movies, including The Lair of the White Worm, Doctor Who: The Curse of Fatal Death, Cloud Atlas, and Paddington 2.\n\nHe was reported on March 2, 2021, to have signed onto the Dungeons & Dragons movie, together with Sophia Lillis. Grant was initially reported to be playing a villainous role,[1] as a character called \"Forge Fletcher\".[2] In an interview with Screen Daily published on June 24, Grant said he hadn't played Dungeons & Dragons before but the movie, as a \"great big, expensive Hollywood blockbuster\" offered the chance to do something different and said \"But more than that I laughed at the script. It's hard to please me, but it had real charm and moved me. I was certainly not expecting that.\" He could neither confirm nor deny reports that he'd be playing the villain.[3]\n\nFilming began in May and Hugh Grant was seen in costume at Wells Cathedral on June 12[4] and at Carrickfergus Castle on June 28 and 29.[5][6][7]\n\nFilming for Hugh Grant and Reg√©-Jean Page wrapped on August 8. This was reported soon after on Twitter by Jonathan Goldstein, who said \"and damn are they good in this movie.\"[8]\n\nGallery[]\n\nAppendix[]\n\n[]\n\nHugh Grant article at Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.\n\nHugh Grant at IMDb\n\nHugh Grant on Twitter"
