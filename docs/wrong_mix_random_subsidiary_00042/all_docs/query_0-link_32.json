Zion Lutheran Church Collection, Truban Archives, Shenandoah County Library, Edinburg, Virginia, USA.\n\nAcquisition Information: Donation with special restrictions.\n\nProcessing Information: Items were acquired in a semi-processed state from the church. When possible, original titles and information was retained. Several scrapbooks were disassembled as part of processing due to preservation efforts. Photograph ID’s were retained as written following by an effort by the church to acquire additional information. Financial records containing bank information were destroyed.\n\nBiographical/Historical Note\n\nMt. Zion Lutheran Church dates to 1829 when Abraham Smutz and his family sold land to a group of church trustees. This land contained a house that the deed required to be used as a school and church for any denomination. Mt. Zion’s Lutheran congregation met there twice a month during the 1870s.\n\nIn 1884 the Lutherans in the area began work on their own church building beside the Union church. The area surrounding the new church had previously been dedicated as a cemetery and the first burials at the site occurred in 1882.\n\nIn 1895 Mt. Zion Lutheran Church joined with St. Luke Lutheran Church to form a new parish. The coordination would last, with a few interruptions, to this day. In 1898 the two congregations joined with Lebanon Lutheran Church in the north end of the county to form an expanded parish. Since transportation was primitive the minister’s time at each church was limited. Mt. Zion hosted the minister on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th Sundays.\n\nIn 1908 a narthex and belfry was added to the church. The membership of the church numbered 156 adults in 1912. Other changes occurred over the next several decades as modern utilities came to the area. In 1925 electricity was added to the church’s parsonage. During the next decade a sink and water pump were also added. Finally, the church’s first bathroom with indoor plumbing was installed in 1943.\n\nIn 1948 when the church replaced the dual entrances and aisles, originally designed to segregate men and women, with a single entrance. During the project the church also added a large altar picture featuring Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane to honor members who had fought in World War II. When these changes were dedicated in 1949, the church listed 150 communing members. The final major renovation to the church occurred in 1980-1981 when a social hall and parking lot was added.\n\nIn the decades that followed, the make-up of the Lutheran Parish to which Mt. Zion belonged changed drastically. Lebanon Church left the parish in 1969 when the other churches voted to realign the parish to include only two churches. This parish alignment would last until 1988, when Mt. Zion decided to become a one-church parish. However, the church was unable to support a minister on its own. In Mt. Zion and St. Luke rejoined in 2015 and continue to operate as a dual parish today.\n\nScope and Content\n\nThe Mt. Zion Lutheran Church Collections consists of approximately 35 linear feet of material stored in 29 boxes, 2 oversize folders, and 1 framed item.
