        "text": "Hugh Grant’s bumbling historian in Charlie Brooker’s Death to 2020 confuses the year with Game Of Thrones – and to be honest, we don’t blame him.\n\nThe British actor is part of the all-star cast of the mockumentary, which is released on Sunday to summarise the complete catastrophe this year has been.\n\nThe character, named Tennyson Foss, is brought on board as a historian to give his input on the events of the year, though somewhere along the way it gets a bit fumbled.\n\nHe tells the cameras: ‘All this division, all this intractable conflict was tearing human kind asunder at the worst possible time.\n\n‘Because of course at the very moment we were pre-occupied with fighting each other, the coronavirus was steadily bearing down upon us.\n\n‘Now, those who’ve closely studied the history books, such as myself, knew that this was strongly reminiscent of the time the White Walkers led their army of the dead towards the warring factions of Westeros.’\n\n‘So you mean like in Game Of Thrones?’ a voice off camera asks him.\n\n‘No, no, I am discussing history,’ he asserts.\n\n‘I’m pretty sure that was Game Of Thrones,’ the voice tells him.\n\nRefusing to back down, Foss responds: ‘Well I am pretty sure that I’m the historian here.’\n\nThe whiskey-glugging ‘professional’ then demands: ‘Cut to a map or something.’\n\nDeath To 2020 will be a new look over the past year from the minds of Black Mirror’s Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones.\n\nGrant joins a massive cast including SNL’s Leslie Jones, Friends’ Lisa Kudrow, Stranger Things’ Joe Keery and Samuel L Jackson.\n\nDeath To 2020 launches 27 December on Netflix.\n\nGot A Story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Being Bridget Jones: Hugh Grant mocks Renee Zellweger’s attempts at British accent: ‘She sounded like Princess Margaret after a stroke’"
