I attended the annual Boys State Convention in Tallahassee where they learned the real meaning of politics, freedom and the privilege of participation in politics.\n\nThe boys entered into a mock session of city and state election. It was an experience, that doesn’t come along often. Here are the boy’s thoughts of their journey into the political world.\n\nBy Mike Barclay\n\nWe arrived at Boys State in Kellum Hall at FSU in Tallahassee which was our home for the week. We received our party tags, shirts and rooms. Each boy shared a room with a member of the opposing party which created many deep discussions about the “better” candidate. My county had more posters up than any other county in the dorm.\n\nSunday was a day of getting acquainted with our imaginary city, Adamsville. Getting to meet people from all over the state was one of the exciting things about Boy’s State.\n\nRight away I started campaigning for the office of City Council, which was the right, moves because I won the office and even became Chairman of the City Council which was my highest office.\n\nThe guidelines were established on Monday. We had our first election in the cities and we broke up into parties and got our Party Whip and nominees for the state offices (I ran for Governor but was defeated within my party). There were also some speakers on Americanism. Later that evening we had a social at the president’s house.\n\nTuesday we elected representatives and senators. Wednesday my party continued campaigning.\n\nThursday we were allowed free time in the new capitol building. There I sat in on the House and Senate meetings, the legislature never seemed so interesting until that day.\n\nThursday night we all went to the auditorium for the election of State offices. My party, the Federalists, with our candidate, David Christian, won the governor’s seat.\n\nWe got mailing lists for almost everyone in our city. “We will get together sometimes and have a good reunion,” we decided.\n\n“That morning I was happy to be on the bus going home and sad to be leaving my new friends and the great city of Adamsonville.\n\nBy Cliff Gehrke\n\nThe instant we got off the bus we were met by hopeful candidates for the office of governor or our imaginary 51st state.\n\nAfter getting settled we had our first city meeting. Thee we met the total constituency of our fair city. The City Counselor reviewed the rules with us and after the meeting we went into political parties, the Nationalists and the Federalists.\n\nFollowing a welcome by Director Robert Francis, we continued with city meetings. I was appointed into the city council of Anderson. I learned brotherhood and how politicians operate.\n\nDuring the week we had our pictures taken with our cities, went to the FSU presidents’ home, went to the capitol to use the Senate and House Chambers and was welcomed by Governor Reuben Askew.\n\nBy Alan Corbin\n\nAfter the first couple of days at Boys State, everything seemed to fall into place and we started enjoying the experience of making new friends, learning the true meaning of Americanism.\n\nI loved that Americanism is more than just singing the National Anthem or exploding fireworks on the Fourth of July. Americanism is the dove of America and all that she stands for and is the responsibility of every American to uphold her ideals—loyalty and honestly-to this end.\n\nThe Boys State government was set up on the three levels: state, county and city.\n\nI took part in all of the elections and ran for many of the offices in the city and county. Although I didn’t get elected into an office was appointed deputy of Powton City and attempted to arrest our own police chief and sheriff for sleeping in a General Assembly.\n\nOn the state level I was elected to the House of Representatives and was able to represent Boys State in the real House at the capitol.\n\nBy Steve Spanger\n\nAmerican Legion Boys State was the rediscovery of the American in America, stressing individual importance and responsibilities in society. It was the broadening of Americanism that no longer limited to the conformist attitude of an American reviewed by many. Instead the fact that we as Americans must broaden the horizons of Americanism, setting the standard by which we are to be judged by others, was evident that Boys State was the American realization.\n\nWith the boys was Miss Lucy Mae Knox who acted as a counselor for the event.\n\nMiss Knox’s Comments\n\nMiss Lucy Mae Knox, on the boy’s state staff for the third consecutive year, pointed out that the Legion had some outside help in financing the Boys Staters this year. She said checks were received from Flagship Bank of Pasco and Ellis First National Bank to help with the expenses.\n\n“There were 559 great guys there this year,” she said. They were a low key group but high pitched in enthusiasm and desire.\n\nMiss Knox told the News she averaged four hours of sleep a night for the week-long activity, but enjoyed every minute of the work as Boy’s State Postmaster. She also served as chairman of the Memorial Service conducted in the House of Representatives.\n\n“The service honors former leaders of the Boys State Program as well as all former Boys Staters who have died I the previous year, she said. She was assisted by the two Boy’s states chaplains.\n\nTwo Boys state delegates are chosen each year to attend Boy’s Nation in Washington, D.C. One of those chosen this year was one of the chaplains. Miss Knox, a longtime leader in American Legion affairs in the state, has been working on Boys State project of 18 years and attended the Boys State graduation for 10 years before being chosen as a counselor. Presenting Our New Coaches John Blackburn and Carl Summers, by Mary Ann LaRussa, Bulldogger Newsletter, Volume XIII, No IX, 1978\n\nCoach John Blackburn, Head Football Coach for ZHS\n\nThere’s a promising new figure that has descended upon our high school and community. New from the standpoint he recently arrived from Macon, Georgia, and the promising head coach of our mighty Bulldogs. The man I am referring to is Mr. John Blackburn. The 7th year coach became aware of the opening position of ZHS from a friend of his coaching at Lakeland. He came down to check us out and comments that his feelings of Zephyrhills are, “I love it!” The school’s beautiful, and the athletic facilities will be tremendous one they are completed. I like it all.”\n\nHis immediate goals are, besides shaping his 1979-80 Bulldogs, to join a church in the community and to settle his wife of 4 years, Sandra. And his twin 19-month old daughters, Allison Leigh and Jessica Elaine into their new surroundings. Mr. Blackburn will begin his 4th year teaching and will be instructing comparative educational math and economics. He states that his main reason for teaching is “because of the kids.”\n\nCoach Carl Summers, Assistant Football Coach for ZHS\n\nRecently I had the experience of interviewing our new assistant coach, Mr. Carl Summers. Many of you might be familiar with him because of his impressive appearances as a teacher since he came to Zephyrhills from Macon, Georgia. There he was a teacher at Central High School.\n\nMr. Summers intends to make Zephyrhills his home for his wife and two daughters. He came to Zephyrhills with Mr. Blackburn to investigate the school; they liked the system and decided to stay. Mr. Summers’ first impression of ZHS was “Super!” He felt that, “All faculty and students concerned have a genuine interest and devotion to all aspects of school and community life.” He plans on becoming an active member of the community and by his past record he will be a very welcome addition. Coach Summers has been involved with the Lions Club, American Legion, Jaycees, Kiwanis and VFW. He was a scout master and also the youth director of his church. Mr. Summers was in the Marine Corps and served in Vietnam where he received 2 Silver Stars and a Purple Heart.\n\nZHS Graduates 188 Seniors; Many Awards Are Presented, Zephyrhills News, June 15, 1978\n\nBecause it was the largest class ever graduated at Zephyrhills High School at 188 seniors, even with a limit of two tickets per senior there was standing room only for Commencement Tuesday night.\n\nPacket into the commons area and sweltering as normally adequate air conditioners attempted to overcome the heat given by the press of humanity, students and citizens still enjoyed yet another colorful, eye-dewing and moving graduation exercise.\n\nPrevious largest class was 163 seniors in 1975. Last year’s at 159 seniors is now the third largest ever.\n\nWith an estimated 1,100 seats in place for the diploma-awarding, and with standing room only, school custodians believe this year’s throng was even larger than last year, and is figured at about 1,300 persons.\n\nAlthough the ceremony did not begin with the traditional processional until 8 p.m., there was a line of parents at the Zephyrhills High School front doors when the doors were unlocked at 6 p.m. and by 7 p.m. almost every seat reserved for parents was filled.\n\nMiss Mary Giella, Assistant Superintendent and Jay B. Starkey, School Board Member, were on hand to assist with the ceremony. Starkey presented the diplomas as they were handed to him by Principal Raymond B. Stewart, and as J.C. Steele III, faculty commencement chairperson, called out the names of the senior. Miss Giella turned tassels as the graduates left the stage.\n\nOthers present on the platform were the Reverend Louis Meyer, pastor of the Christian and Missionary Alliance Church, who gave both the invocation and the benediction to the Commencement. Guests were introduced by Steele. Speakers on the program were Chris Bahr, president of the Class of 1978, Lenne′ Hunt, Class Valedictorian and Daniel Deaton, Class Salutatorian. Honor grads were presented by Miss Giella as follows: Citizenship—Lenne′ Hunt and Bruce Clark; School Spirit—Trish Inman and Fred Rhoda; Activities—Patricia Barrentine and Jeff Strout; Athletics—Sheryl Arnold and Shawn Regan; Best All-Around—Patti Landreth and Thor Wickstrom. Ivan Corbin, acting on behalf of the Karl Y. Wickstrom family of Miami, presented a Leadership and Friendship Plaque and a check for $100 to Patti Landreth as the senior who though those traits most honored the memory of Karl G. Wickstrom, a ZHS senior when he was killed in a car-bicycle accident in July of 1972. Corbin was last year’s winner of the award.\n\nOrganist for the processional led by Miss Hunt and Mr. Deaton was Mrs. Marjorie Mead.\n\nUshers were members of the junior class and included Cindy Dann, Lynda Furney, Karen Holt, Jone Mills, Darlene Roman, Vilna Simmon, Mike Barclay, Bob Boyd, Alan Corbin, Mark Rickard, Steve Spanger, and Paul White.\n\nAs an interesting sidelight to this year’s Commencement, a local Boy Scout official pointed out that while the national average is one Eagle Scout to every 300 Boy Scouts, the Class of 1978 has as members six Eagle Scouts. They are Homer E. Brooks, III, Bruce W. Clark, Jeffrey A. DeWitt, Willie T. Quick, Jr., Michael Schaffner and James K. Waddey.\n\nValedictorian’s Speech by Lenne′ Hunt\n\nHonored Guests, members of the faculty, fellow students, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nFirst of all, I would like to take this time to thank my parents, family and friends who have inspired as well as encouraged me during these formative years. Without the love and guidance of all of these, and especially my parents, members such as this would not be possible.\n\nToday marks an ending and a beginning. The time has come for us to put away our dolls and batman capes and look ahead to new responsibilities. We’ve come through a learning stage and now must test that knowledge. We must now see how wise we are and how much we have yet to learn.\n\nSenior year has provided a time for us to get acquainted with ourselves, our hopes, our dreams, abilities and limits. It is the final stage in preparing us to live independently within our world. Many of us are uncertain as to what the future holds, or even where we should go to find our future. But we do know who we are and what we stand for and with this knowledge we will see our hopes survive.\n\nEach of us must find the truth that we can live by, that will sustain us.\n\nForging ahead, we must leave the secure familiarity of our memories, while striving to reach the goals we have set. Much can be learned from past experiences, but we cannot live in the past. Once truth is learned it must be applied to our future. From here we are starting anew. The world awaiting us is in need of newness and freshness.\n\nIn the Bible a wise man of old once said, let no man despise your youth, but be an example in the way that you live.\n\nWisdom is the quality of being wise, the practice of truth. For us to cope with our responsibilities, we must have wisdom. It is easy to look beside us and see others who aren’t taking their responsibility seriously, and tragic to see the end result of these lives. It is far more difficult to assume responsibility ourselves. Wisdom doesn’t exclude happiness. It doesn’t call for us to take on the burdens of the world. It does, however, help to attain peace within ourself.\n\nHaving attained peace within, let us make our wisdom work to help someone else. Our world seems to be deteriorating rapidly. There is more and more hatred and mistrust. This is why we must let wisdom, include kindness and love.\n\nPerhaps it is foolish to think that we can instigate changes for the better, but we might keep o hoping and working for that change. The world has to be different because we have lived. I’m not sure that I’m totally ready to accept new responsibility but I must at least try, as must we all.\n\nIf there is one hope I could give to you or one goal to strive for, it would be this—that each of us would learn wisdom and with it kindness, and with that wisdom we’ll work together to make our world better, happier and more at peace.\n\nWhatever your goals, I wish you all the best that life has to offer, and may God bless you. Thank you.\n\nSalutatorian’s Address by Daniel Deaton\n\nIn 1968, a young American entered the Summer Olympics in the swimming competition. Since he had prepared a good bit, he was expected to do quite well. Unfortunately he received only one bronze medal, which was a rather disappointing showing. He almost gave up swimming after those Olympics, but he decided to give it one more try.\n\nHe set a goal to come in first place in every race he swam in. He committed himself to that goal, and worked very hard in his efforts to reach it. He was determined to win those gold medals. In 1972 Olympics, Mark Spitz won every event he swam in, for a total of seven gold medals. No one had ever done it before.\n\nMark Spitz was a winner, but he didn’t become number one overnight. He had a real desire to win, and he paid the high price that was necessary to become a world champion by giving it everything he had.\n\nWhether we realize it or not, each of us can be a winner in life!\n\nWhat does this involve?\n\nPart of being a winner is having the right goals, for without something to work toward, we wouldn’t accomplish anything. Our high school days are over now, and in the next few months, we have a lot of life-changing decisions to make. We have to decide where to go to college or get a job, where we want to live and who we will marry. All of these decisions are determined by our goals and what we want to accomplish in life. What do you really want to get out of life? Are you satisfied with the direction in which your life is going? If not, now is the time to change it.\n\nAnother real key to being a winner in life is having a good personality. When we’re dead and gone, people won’t remember us by how much money we had, or by how popular we were. They will remember us by the kind of people we were. All of us have our good points and bad points. And all of us have room for improvement. Some qualities of a good personality that we can develop are honesty, kindness, friendliness, respect for others and having strong moral character. Being optimistic and being able to find something to compliment others about is an excellent quality to have. I need to work on this myself. These qualities will help you become a person others will enjoy being around and will make you genuinely popular.\n\nWe are participating in the greatest game we will ever play, the game of LIFE. In this game, the stakes are eternal life and death. You only get one chance (one series of downs) to score. The plays you call, the decisions and choices you make determine whether you gain the victory or suffer the defeat.\n\nAs in any game, there is a high price to pay to be a winner. It requires a strong commitment to Jesus Christ and the high ideals He has set before us. We must deny self and put Christ and others before ourselves. Along with the high price you pay to be a winner goes a great reward. It includes lasting happiness and peace as you move toward the goal line, knowing you’re going to win. And when you reach the goal life, in the game of life, your reward is an eternal one, instead of one temporary fame.\n\nAnybody can be a loser. It takes no effort to lose. However there is still a high price that you will pay as a result of your choice not to be a winner. For as the winner triumphs, the loser suffers in defeat and embarrassment.\n\nBet we’re not alone in this game; God wants to help us if we’ll only let Him. He’s in the business of making winners out of losers, and if God is on our side who can be against us?\n\nBut in this game, the plays you call are up to you. You can choose to pay the price now and enjoy the rewards of winning, or take it easy now and miss out on real life and suffer the consequences later. You’ll pay a high price either way; why not be a winner?\n\nWhen the game of life is over, and God, the referee with the final say, makes His judgment, will you be a winner of a loser?\n\nTry God’s wan and be a winner!\n\nClass President’s Talk-Chris Bahr\n\nWe the seniors of 1978 would like to thank you, the parents, teachers and guests for coming to witness our success.\n\nI’d like to extend an exceptionally warm welcome to the parents and teachers, for they are a part of our success. To the parents who created us, loved us, and helped us, may I say, “Thank You.”\n\nI know all of my fellow students have thought of what they are going to do for the rest of their lives. Many have not decided.\n\nWhatever is in the future, it is the job that is most important.\n\nFor the kind of job we get will determine the lifestyle we will live. To be happy in what we do is a measure of success more than the money we can make. A happy ditch digger can be a success just as much as the president can.\n\nThe only job benefiting all of you is the best job you can possible get and want. The way to achieve this is to do the best that you can.\n\nSome of us will choose college to further our education and knowledge while others will go on to other fields.\n\nThe temptation of having a once-in-a-lifetime party every evening at college is not the way to do the best you can. Not studying in college is a waste of time and money.\n\nTake the case of two college juniors. After yawning one said, “What shall we do tonight?” “Let’s toss a coin and decide,” replied the other. “If it’s tails, we’ll call on Rosie and Susie, and if it’s heads, we’ll study.”\n\nSelf-discipline is the key to being a success in college and afterwards. We have a moral responsibility to ourselves and to society to advance our minds to the fullest.\n\nLooking back to our freshman year I think (“What A motley crew we were.”).\n\nRecognition came when in our sophomore year our homecoming float smoked up the whole town. It’s been great being president of this fine group of friends.\n\nI thank you for pulling with me during homecoming, and throughout the year. It’s been the greatest time of my life. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.\n\nEven though we will all go separate ways, we all know our class reunions will be fun and something to look forward to.\n\nIn closing I would like to leave you with this poem—“The best verse hasn’t been rhymed yet. The best house hasn’t been planned. The highest peak hasn’t been climbed yet. The mightiest rivers aren’t spanned. Don’t worry and fret, faint-hearted.\n\nThe chances have just begun. For the best jobs, haven’t been started. The best work hasn’t been done.”\n\nRenninger To Direct New School; Cox Elementary Assistant New West Head, Zephyrhills News, February 3, 1978\n\nWest Zephyrhills Elementary School Principal, Ferd E. Renninger, will be the first principal for the new elementary school now being built west of Zephyrhills High School. Renninger has had 20 years of experience in education, 15 of them in Zephyrhills in administration. He came in 1962 from Lakeland.\n\nThe new principal for West Zephyrhills Elementary…will be Louis Freijo. Freijo is certified in elementary administration and has been employed by the Pasco County system for the past seven years.\n\nGirl Golfers Finish 3rd In District Tourney, Zephyrhills News, April 27, 1978\n\nWhile the Zephyrhills High School girl’s golf team had a terrific season record with 10 victories and only four losses, some of the team’s players will be completing in the State Finals.\n\nThat’s because in the District Tournament at Cypress Woods course near Winter Haven Tuesday afternoon, the ZHS girls finished third behind two powerful big school teams.\n\nAnd the finish was very close. “Just a few strokes could have made a big difference”—Coach Madonna Jervis Wise said.\n\nWinter Haven won the meet, on its home course with a 396 total, while Lakeland Kathleen came in second with a 409. Just three strokes behind at 412, were the ZHS girls.\n\nZephyrhills won the District Meet last season, although the team’s 1977 season record was not as good.\n\nJone Mills, with a score of 95, was the fifth high individual of the District Meet, and was presented a special award. Other Bulldog golf girls included Melanie Bahr with a 194; Celia Schneider with a 105; Cheryl Pelt with a 107 and Pam Peter with a 120. A Memorial to a Memorial, by Cindy Roman from Bulldogger Student Newsletter, Volume XIII, No. 4, Homecoming, 1978\n\nNineteen-seventy-eight marks the last year for football games at Krusen Memorial Field. As the new stadium takes over, Krusen will be retired as a football field. Although almost everyone know where and what Krusen Field is, few people know the history of the field.\n\nWorld War II marked the time period when the field took on the job as an air base for a fighter squadron. After passing through many hands, the city to the government for war and back again (Krusen’s didn’t donate that land, it was some other land nearby)-the city took it over.\n\nBeing a small town many years ago, the now middle school housed the Zephyrhills students from grades 1-12 with ease. Football games in this rural town were played at a small field near Krusen Field in the afternoon because there were no lights to play under at night, But Zephyrhills was to grow and a new field was added to accommodate the many fans.\n\nAbout the year 1955, the Quarterback Club was organized. This group of people worked in cooperation with the city to build a new field since the old one had been outgrown. Arguments were made that the city would own the property and take care of it, but problems arose with this set-up. Leaving the field to the school board for a dollar a year was the answer. The school board agreed to pay the expenses of operating the field.\n\nSo many people, groups, clubs and businesses were (and are) involved with the development of Krusen Field. To start work on the field the county donated the use of their equipment; there was much fill work to be done. The scoreboard was donated by the Bank of Zephyrhills; the lights set up by Florida Power Company, the fence, the restrooms and now the electricity bills were footed by the city. The Pepsi-Cola Company also contributed by building the concession stand if Pepsi was to be patronized for a certain length of time. The Quarterback Club, who runs the stand (in cooperating with the fans), then raised money to purchase new bleachers for the field. Few people realize the cost of the stands; each part of them cost around $14,000. Many businessmen helped by writing repayable notes to purchase different sections.\n\nThe new field was dedicated to Charles B. Krusen, son of Mr. And Mrs. I.A. Krusen, in about 1955. The choice of Charles B. Krusen was done for a young man about 21 who died about 1945. Being a small town, the old favorite was chosen by the Quarterback Club.\n\nThe life of Krusen Field from 1955 when it was conceived to 1960 when the first stands were finished, to its retirement is recognized as one filled with many events.\n\nDecember 3rd marks the day when the new stadium, its successor, will be opened for public inspection. Krusen Field will be retired as a recreation field for baseball, softball, soccer and other sports. The old field will be “put out to pasture.”\n\nNo matter what the field will be when the stadium takes over, it will never become outdated or useless. Many people will retrace memories of great wins and tragic losses, of good times and bad. Parts of Krusen will live on as old home bleachers are moved to the new stadium for visitor bleachers. Even though Bulldog football games won’t be played there any longer, other games will-Charles B. Krusen Memorial Field serves its community well.\n\nCommencement for 188 Seniors Tuesday in ZHS Commons Area, Zephyrhills News, June 8, 1978\n\nMembers of the largest Zephyrhills High school graduating class ever enrolled will receive diplomas in formal exercise Tuesday at 8 p.m.\n\nThe 188 listed seniors—including 22 honor students—will be presented their recognition of completion of their high school education in the student commons area of the school, located at 1975 12th street.\n\nAs they have the past three years, graduates and parents alike will enjoy air conditioned comfort rather than the sweltering heat of the gymnasium.\n\nBut in a marked change from past years, graduates will not receive awards from Pasco Schools Superintendent Tom Weightman; in fact only two county officials—Assistant Mary Giella and School Board Member, Jay Starkey, will be on hand to congratulate ZHS graduate.\n\nGraduation ceremonies will begin Tuesday evening with Mrs. Marjorie Mead’s organ prelude. The Reverend Louis Meyer, pastor of Christian and Missionary Alliance Church, will give the invocation, after which guests will be introduced by J.C. Steele III, one of the seven class sponsors and commencement chairman.\n\nFollowing the presentation of awards Lenne Hunt will make her valedictorian address just before the awarding of the diplomas by Starkey and Stewart.\n\nPicture Caption with article—Presented scholarships at the Awards Day ceremony at ZHS were three girls: Arlene Camper and Bonnie Gray, winners of Pasco-Hernando Community College full-tuition scholarships and Patricia Barrentine, winner of the Alpha Delta Kappa “Audrey Clark” Memorial Scholarship grant.\n\nThree ZHS Art Students Win Honors In Big Area Exhibit, Zephyrhills News\n\nIt was a happy day for three Zephyrhills High School art students for their parents and friends—but it was an especially rewarding day for Mrs. Judy Mason, ZHS art teacher.\n\nThe trio of students had been named among the major winners in the Tampa Bay Regional Scholastic Art Awards Exhibition, a feat which Mrs. Mason modestly credits to “the overall art program in elementary and junior high here as well as high school.”\n\nBut those who know best about the dedication to teaching in her chosen field shown by Mrs. Mason, her three prize-winning students, say a lion’s share of the credit for their accomplishment should go to Judy Mason. Of the three winners, one is only a junior. She is Cheryl Ordenes, whose pencil portrait of a young girl won a Gold Key Award, the highest of the regional awards.\n\nThe other two are seniors. Patti Landreth’s pencil portrait of a young woman was named a Blue Ribbon Finalist, and after March 4, will be sent to New York City for national judging.\n\nThe big winner and in fact the dominate painter in the exhibition is Thor Wickstrom, who walked off with seven awards, including having his portfolio be the only one selected for national judging in April for a possible scholarship to one of the nation’s major art schools. The Scholastic Art Exhibition will continue on the main floor of Robinson’s Department Store at the University Square Mall, Tampa, through March 4. Sponsored nationally by Scholastic magazine and locally the past two years by Robinson’s the competition includes drawings, graphics, paintings, photographs, sculpture and ceramics. The University Square show includes work by Students from more than 20 high schools in Hillsborough, Polk, and Pasco Counties.\n\nThe 17-year old Wickstrom—whose name is recognized by the News’ readers for the cartoons he has drawn over the past two years for these pages—won the following in the competition:\n\nA Hallmark Award for an oil portrait of Finish exchange student, Marjukka Valkama, which will be judged in New York,\n\nThe Portfolio Award,\n\nThe Judges’ Ribbon and a cash prize for an oil entitled, “Self Portrait To Be Hung on A Ceiling,”\n\nTwo blue ribbon finalist awards on portraits which will be judged in New York, and\n\nTwo gold Key awards on another oil portrait and a watercolor.\n\n“We have need for growth here in the high school, but there are no art teachers in our elementary schools now, and none at the junior high level. They say there is not enough money to fund the units for art,” Mrs. Mason said. “But I believe all of our students have benefited from the strong overall art program we used to have—at all levels,” she said.\n\nZHS Girl Golfers Counting on Experience This Season, Zephyrhills News,\n\nThe ZHS Girls golf team has experience on its side this season.
