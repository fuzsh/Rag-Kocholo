        "text": "'Hugh Grant loses his bookshop in Notting Hill\" was the headline on an article that appeared last week in my local Spanish newspaper. International interest in London's Travel Bookshop (described as a tourist attraction comparable to Paris's Shakespeare and Company) is entirely due to its central role in a popular film promoting an engaging view of London and the British. In Britain, the news of the bookshop's closure has additional and more serious implications – for the future not only of similar independent establishments, but also, and no less importantly, of travel writing.\n\nTravel writing today has an undoubtedly tarnished image. The casting of Hugh Grant in Notting Hill says much about popular preconceptions of the genre and its practitioners. It is a genre which has traditionally been dominated by the British toff, in modern times by writers such as Peter Fleming, Patrick Leigh Fermor and Colin Thubron. The idea of the charming and literate old Etonian going off into the desert with his camel and thesaurus has its lingering appeal. But in general, in the post-colonial era of widespread travel, it appears increasingly anachronistic and elitist, a residue of the time when Britain still had imperialist ambitions.\n\nA reflection of the more populist and democratic approach to travel today is the way in which the travel shelves of bookshops have come to be overwhelmed by guidebooks, few of which can claim to have the caustic wit or delightfully opinionated views of Richard Ford's A Handbook for Travellers in Spain of 1845, or the deeply personal and informed vision of modern classics such as JG Links's Venice for Pleasure. Publishers' fears of being sued, combined with the demands of travellers with limitless destinations at their disposal, but with ever more limited time in which to see them, have produced a bland form of guide book literature largely filled with ephemeral and randomly compiled practical hints and information.\n\nThe same trend has led to a notable decline in travel journalism. Gone are the days when authors such as Paul Bowles could go off to Sri Lanka for several months to write 30 pages of reflective prose for magazines entitled \"Holiday\". Today's travel writer, with usually no more than a few days to do the research, is more likely to produce a piece heavily taken up by \"fact boxes\", lists of highlights and plugs for airlines and hotels.\n\nDiminishing respect for travel literature has been further compounded by what is by far the most flourishing subspecies of the genre today: the \"Good Life Abroad Book\". The problem about works such as Peter Mayle's A Year in Provence or Frances Mayes's Under the Tuscan Sun is not so much that they peddle Mediterranean dreams that can rarely be realised by others, but that they encourage the idea that anyone can write books about their experiences abroad. I am always amazed that so many books of the \"what-I-did-in-my-holidays\" school of writing manage to get published and even enjoy a reasonable success. I am also not surprised that the view of travel writing as a rarified pursuit of the privileged is being succeeded by one that diminishes the genre as banal, patronising and lightweight.\n\nSome people might conclude that the Travel Bookshop is doomed because travel writing itself is doomed. Such pessimists tend to point to the internet as the final factor in the genre's potential extinction. The internet has certainly made redundant a Victorian type of travel book bringing together a lot of factual and statistical information about a country. It is also likely to do away soon with the need for guide books and the travel pages of newspapers (at least in their present form).\n\nBut, despite the rise of the internet and all the recent negative attitudes towards travel writing, to predict the death of the genre seems to me as nearsighted as believing that this country's pioneering travel bookshop has come to the end of its useful life.\n\nFor three years, I was chairman of the judges of the Dolman Best Travel Book award, the only prize of its kind in Britain. The job was unpaid, earned me probably much resentment among other authors and involved reading though an average of 70 books a year, a high proportion of which had titles that said it all, such as Goats From a Small Island and A Stingray Bit My Nipple. However, I emerged from the experience convinced that travel writing was in as healthy a state as it ever was (including during its supposed renaissance under the influence of Bruce Chatwin) and all that needed changing was our definition of what a travel book should be.\n\nPaul Bowles's belief that a travel book was nothing more than \"the story of what happened to a person in a particular place\" came to seem too limiting and also raised the question of how far from home this place had to be. I thought at first that while a journey around Hackney was as valid as a trip to Timbuktu, a wander around your back garden was not eligible. In the end, I was not so sure. Some of my fellow jurors argued for strict distinctions being made between travel writing, reportage and autobiography. Others insisted that a travel book today needed some form of emotional development on the author's part. I decided eventually that the main criterion as a judge was to be as undogmatic and open-minded as possible.\n\nPart of the greatness of good travel literature lies perhaps in its mingling of genres, and in the scope it allows the writer to explore a wide range of subjects in a searching, non-academic manner. Though writers of travel books might have lost their former role as pure informants, they can still make you want passionately to visit a place and can also broaden your vision of the world by introducing unfamiliar histories and cultures.\n\nAt its very best, a travel book should read like the most compelling of novels and capture what the late Spanish thinker Azorín called the \"poetic reality\" of a country. There have been writers, such as the hugely influential German explorer Alexander von Humboldt, who have instilled in their readers a feeling of constant wonder in the face of nature; and there have been those, such as Laurie Lee, acutely alert to the fullness and beauty of life.\n\nThe word \"magical\" is one of the most overused words in travel literature, but it is the travel writer's ability to transform the everyday world with a genuine sense of the magical that alone justifies the existence of the genre and makes the loss of a great travel bookshop so particularly sad, even if an American film star never really fell in love with its owner."
