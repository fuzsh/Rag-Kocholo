        "text": "R14 you're kidding right? Its a freaking musical. And Elphaba is not a hard role to play. She's constantly in victim mode. Take away the vocals and there isn't an actress on planet earth capable of making her compelling, given the show's script.\n\nExcept Meryl Streep of course, who deserves ALL the singing roles üôÑ\n\nLet's not kid about LMM and Follies. I love that show.\n\n....is the new Company good? I want to see Patti, but when I saw the NPH concert version the show kinda annoyed me. I hated the \"Bobby bubbie!\" chant (is that still there?) and found the plot meandering. Is Not Getting Married now sung by a man?\n\nWas wanting to see Lillias White in Chicago but heard how tired her voice sounded in a rehearsal video and now I'm concerned she'll sound worn out and that'll be depressing. Plus folks keep saying the show itself is lackluster now.\n\nI definitely wanted to see Little Shop but Tammys voice sounds too deep for Audrey. Does she have an alternate who performs regularly? Is that gal better?\n\nI 100% wanted to see Music Man but it would be in previews and I'd be hard-pressed to find a cheap ticket. Do they do discount tickets day-of for a show that anticipated during the holidays?\n\nMy parents have been so hyped to send me money to go to a Broadway show and enjoy the theater, but as I‚Äôve told them thank you, but no need. There just doesn‚Äôt seem to be anything I can get that excited to see anymore. I told them the Broadway I loved seems to be a thing of the past. At most I would go to Diana to hate watch it, but spending that type of money to do that isn‚Äôt justifiable, like a TV show you can watch for free.\n\nOr I would go to see a particular actor like Aaron in Moulin Rouge, but from what I gather that Soutine doesn‚Äôt on any level appear to be even superficially French and I don‚Äôt think Aaron is playing it as being Scottish at all, which was so much of the warmth of that character. The most interesting thing was that anniversary concert of Spring Awakening, which harkens back to the last time Broadway was great. I can no longer justify the cost for the experience, something I never had to do in the past. When poor I would literally give up things like expensive food or eating out to pay for tickets. Now I could be given money to go and just don‚Äôt see the reason why.\n\n[quote]It must be a great luxury to find that message heavy handed.\n\nWhat an insulting remark. It's not the message I find heavy-handed at all, it's the way it's hammered home in the second act of the show. In my opinion, the points of the second act are well made, and then remade several times. It's overkill, if you'll pardon the expression, and just not necessary.\n\n[quote]Everyone suffers in the second act, as a result of their actions in the first act, and yet they have to keep going.....Except the witch, who gets a pass on suffering because it‚Äôs a Disney movie and we can‚Äôt kill a Disney princess.\n\nIn the movie, the Witch suffers by having Rapunzel leave her to marry a Prince Charming, which to the Witch is a great loss due to her unnatural degree of attachment to Rapunzel. Again, not everyone in INTO THE WOODS has to die to make the point of the show. You might as well argue that the show and the movie aren't as powerful as they could be because Cinderella doesn't die.\n\nJust out of first screening of West Side Story in NY. Well, I thought it was something of a disappointment for various reasons. One thing it does get right that the original film didn‚Äôt, in my opinion, was Maria and Tony. Especially Maria. Rachel Zegler is absolutely spectacular in every department. Ansel Elgort‚Äôs obviously not a trained singer but he‚Äôs fine. I believed them as tragic lovers. The rest of the castwere just OK, nothing more. I think it was a mistake to have Rita Moreno play a replacement for Doc-it‚Äôs far more than just a cameo, by the way-she sings all of ‚ÄúSomewhere‚Äù, for starters. I miss Doc hollering at the Jets ‚ÄúYiu make this world lousy!‚Äù Instead she yells at them something like ‚ÄúI know all your names. I‚Äôve known you since you were little boys. And you‚Äôve all grown up to be rapists.‚Äù Except they don‚Äôt rape Anita although they‚Äôre very close to doing it when Valentina walks in. Even though a fair amount was shot on location it all looks like it might as well have been done on a Hollywood soundstage. Even ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù which was shot primarily in Washington Heights. I did enjoy the subway train (was it then the IRT) at 72nd/Broadway actually doing those three notes from ‚ÄúSomewhere.‚Äù It was subtle, though, not the wink-wink it could have been. The biggest applause at the screening was given when Rachel Zegler, Rita Moreno and, of course, Stephen Sondheim‚Äôs names appeared on the screen. There is a dedication ‚ÄúFor Dad‚Äù but surely Spielberg is going to add another one for Sondheim? Anyway, man, I really wanted to love this more. But at least it has a Maria who almost single-handedly justifies why WSS even needed a remake in the first place.\n\nR524's link:\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber has accused younger cast members in his musical Cinderella of failing to remember they work in the ‚Äúservice industry‚Äù, adding that ‚Äúnobody has a right to be on the stage‚Äù.\n\nIn what appeared to be a criticism of the attitude of actors in his show, he addressed claims that he had ‚Äúberated‚Äù the cast following a bad review in the New York Post, according to a report in the Daily Mail.\n\nLloyd Webber told Samira Ahmed on BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Front Row that he did address the cast, but that it had ‚Äúnothing to do with the New York Post‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúWhat I was saying to everybody is, the younger cast don‚Äôt really realise all the time [that] we are a service industry, and nobody has a right to be on the stage. I don‚Äôt have a right to have my musicals in the theatre,‚Äù he said, adding: ‚ÄúWhat we have to do is try to give the best performances possible. All I was saying is, that is what we have to do and the cast we have at Cinderella are really wonderful and are well capable of doing that. But this has been wildly exaggerated.‚Äù\n\nHe denied that there would be major changes to the musical following the review in the New York Post, but said there would be some tweaks, amounting to cuts of about two or three minutes.\n\nHe added that the Broadway version of Cinderella would not be able to be staged as it is in London, because the Gillian Lynne Theatre has a revolve, of which the musical makes use.\n\nHe said in New York it would be performed in a ‚Äúdifferent configuration‚Äù.\n\nLloyd Webber also used the interview to discuss cuts to the orchestra of the West End production of The Phantom of the Opera, as reported by The Stage.\n\nHe said the cuts were not implemented by him, but by Cameron Mackintosh as producer, and added: ‚ÄúI would have preferred the orchestra to be bigger.‚Äù\n\nLloyd Webber also said he would like to ‚Äúfight for three or four more players‚Äù.\n\nIn the wide-ranging interview, he also warned that he would be forced to sell his theatres if any more restrictions were brought in, such as another lockdown.\n\n‚ÄúWhen we had to cancel Cinderella in July we lost ¬£700,000 overnight, and the fact of the matter is, whatever the government thinks, if this happened again certainly we would go under,‚Äù he said, adding: ‚ÄúWe would not be able to continue ‚Äì the theatres would have to go. I have already had to sell one of our theatres, the Other Palace.‚Äù\n\nLloyd Webber also criticised the government for not helping commercial producers, and claimed it did not understand what commercial theatre did for cities and for ‚Äúeverybody who depends on it‚Äù, such as restaurants.\n\nSpeaking about how theatres are operating on Broadway during the pandemic, he said UK venues might soon have to follow its lead on Covid safety by asking audiences to provide proof of double vaccination and wear masks throughout a performance.\n\n‚ÄúAt the moment we don‚Äôt have to do that, but if that was necessary to keep our theatres open without social distancing I think that is a very small price to pay, as theatres can‚Äôt work with socially distancing ‚Äì economically it‚Äôs impossible,‚Äù he said.\n\nAnd R525:\n\nCameron Mackintosh has hit back at Andrew Lloyd Webber for claiming that Mackintosh made the sole decision to reduce the orchestra of The Phantom of the Opera, labelling it ‚Äúabsolutely untrue‚Äù.\n\nHe added that Lloyd Webber has ‚Äúfull contractual control‚Äù of his music.\n\nSpeaking to Front Row earlier this week, Lloyd Webber was asked about a decision to cut the orchestra by 50% when it reopened at Her Majesty‚Äôs Theatre earlier this year, as originally reported by The Stage.\n\nWhen asked why he had reduced the orchestra, he insisted: ‚ÄúWell, I didn‚Äôt. That is the simple answer to that. Cameron Mackintosh produces The Phantom of the Opera.‚Äù\n\nHe said he would have liked to have had a bigger orchestra.\n\nHowever, Mackintosh ‚Äì in a statement issued exclusively to The Stage ‚Äì said Lloyd Webber‚Äôs claim that it was solely his decision was ‚Äúabsolutely untrue‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúThe recent statement by Andrew Lloyd Webber that the decision to use a new orchestral line-up for the new production of The Phantom of The Opera at Her Majesty‚Äôs Theatre was solely mine is absolutely untrue. It was a joint decision by Andrew‚Äôs own company, the Really Useful Group and myself, in order for us to be able to afford to bring back this spectacular musical to such an intimate 1,200-seat theatre,‚Äù Mackintosh said.\n\nHe said: ‚ÄúAs it is, even with the new line-up, it is likely to take several years for this highly praised production to break even.‚Äù\n\nMackintosh described Lloyd Webber one of ‚Äúthe most powerful and celebrated composers in the world‚Äù who ‚Äúnaturally has full contractual control of his music‚Äù.\n\n‚ÄúIndeed, he is also billed as co-orchestrator of the current 14-piece Phantom orchestration, which he and David Cullen originally created in 2012, and has since been used around the world, apart from Broadway. Andrew‚Äôs own head of music and personally appointed musical director supervised the music at Her Majesty‚Äôs for the new production that opened in July this year,‚Äù he said.\n\nHe added: ‚ÄúAs a composer, I am sure Andrew would have preferred some extra musicians, but the Phantom orchestra remains one of the largest playing in any of his musicals around the world - including those solely produced by himself.‚Äù"
