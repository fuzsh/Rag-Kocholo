The film dramatizes the legal and moral controversy of the status of these captives as they face a trial that will either send them back into slavery or liberate them. A key character, Yamba (Razaaq Doti), sits waiting in a prison and looks at an illustrated Bible. His friend, Joseph Cinque (Djimon Hounsou), tells him that he need not pretend to be interested in it. Yamba replies that he’s not pretending, but beginning to understand. Cutting away, we watch Judge Coglin (Jeremy Northam), who is responsible for overseeing the court proceedings, entering a church to pray for wisdom and guidance. Returning to Yamba, we see him observe that the people of the Bible had suffered more than his own people. Turning to an illustration of the Nativity, he says, “Then he was born and everything changed.” “Who is he?” asks Cinque. Yamba says he doesn’t know, but everywhere he goes, he is followed by the sun, by a light that shines around his head. Looking at images of Jesus healing a man, defending Mary Magdalene, and holding children, he continues, “Here he is healing people with his hands, protecting them, being given children.” Seeing Jesus walking on water, Cinque asks, “What’s this?” Yamba answers, “He could also walk across the sea. But then something happened. He was captured, accused of some sort of crime. He must have done something.” Yamba continues, keenly questioning the scene. “Why? What did he do? Whatever it was, it was serious enough to kill him for it. Do you want to see how they killed him?” He shows an illustration of the crucifixion of Jesus. 1\n\n2\n\n| Introduction\n\nCinque says, “This is just a story, Yamba.” But Yamba protests, “Look, that’s not the end of it.” Pointing to a picture of the disciples taking Jesus’s body down, he says, “His people took his body down from this . . . thing . . . this . . .” and draws a cross in the air. Then “They took him into a cave. They wrapped him in a cloth, like we do.” Coming upon illustrations of the Resurrection and the Ascension, Yamba points out, “They thought he was dead, but he appeared before his people again and spoke to them. Then, finally, he rose into the sky. This is where the soul goes when you die.” Juxtaposed with the two captives reading the Bible, the Roman Catholic Judge Coglin prays in the background. Yamba concludes, “This is where we’re going when they kill us. It doesn’t look so bad.” Spielberg crosscuts the exegesis of the illustrated text with depictions of the praying judge, suggesting an intimate relationship between the Gospel and the trial, mediated by the prayers of Coglin, one man seeking to do what is just and right. However, Spielberg also uses humor to characterize those who pray. Congregational abolitionists huddle outside the prison gates as the Amistad refugees parade out. One of the prisoners asks who the sullen protestors are as they begin to kneel and pray. Cinque thinks that they “are going to be sick.” As they start singing, “Amazing grace, how sweet the sound,” the first man laughs and says, “They’re entertainers!” As they keep singing, “that saved a wretch like me,” Cinque asks, “But why do they look so miserable?” Spielberg’s film suggests that spectators learn religion visually. They learn about the Cross, about grace, and about freedom through images that speak eloquently. Like the illustrated Bible that the captives read, so the prayers of a nation depicted by Hollywood function as cinematic catechisms. They teach as exemplary and revelatory models for people to see, and perhaps imitate. Winston Churchill once observed that after we shape our buildings, they begin to shape us. Scholars have debated how Hollywood films construct and reconstruct human identity, influencing our conceptions of race, ethnicity, and gender. So, too, they have inquired about how films in various eras have shaped the evolving nature of religious identities, particularly those from Jewish and Roman Catholic traditions that were assimilated into the greater American culture.\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n3\n\nThe practice of prayer has historically been shaped and reshaped by scripture, liturgical tradition, classic works of piety, and personal and communal rituals. While a recent poll by Barna Research indicated that only one out of six Americans finds guidance for their lives from the Bible, a US News and World Report indicated that about two-thirds of Americans pray more than once a day.1 As biblical influence wanes, popular culture waxes, inculcating millions with its own secular models of religious habits and customs. Religious critic Neil Hurley once quipped that movies are for the masses what theology is for the elite, which makes one wonder what kind of theology of prayer films offer.2 This volume evolved out of a recognition of how many prayers have populated Hollywood films and a contemplation of their far-reaching effects on their viewers. When film critic Roger Ebert became too ill to attend the Virginia Film Festival in Charlottesville several years ago, I was invited to present a mediated lecture presentation on prayers in film. I gathered hundreds of clips to show the unexpected presence of such moments of prayer in an enormous range of popular films across all genres.3 Indeed, these secular films often appeared more religiously attuned than many church activities. Prayer is defined as spiritual communication with God, a mode of discourse expressed through speech, music, contemplation, journaling, poetry, music, and other arts. Historians Philip and Carol Zaleskis surveyed how individual saints and communities approached the practice of prayer, outlining four archetypal models: the refugee who clings to God with requests and petitions, the devotee, the ecstatic, and the contemplative, who “tastes ultimate reality.”4 This book examines how films may have shaped popular ideas about prayer, not only reflecting but also prescribing how one is called to pray. The primary goal of this work is to survey the landscape of those Hollywood films that employ prayers in their narratives. Various questions guide this research. First, this book asks what kinds of themes are represented by groups of cinematic prayers during various time periods. Second, it examines particular aspects of the presentation of prayer and worship, such as demographics (the race, gender, or age of the person praying), function (adoration, confession, thanksgiving, supplication), salience and valence in the context (how important is the prayer\n\n4\n\n| Introduction\n\nto the storyline and what is the attitude toward it?), and efficacy (is the prayer answered?). The valence of prayers reveals its positive or negative aspects as used in the films. For example, does the prayer offer a sacramental view of communication with God or an instrumental one? Is it said sincerely, hypocritically, or ironically? Is the prayer answered in the affirmative or in silence? Remarkably, as we will see with efficacy, prayers are frequently answered in films in supernatural ways with impeccable timing. Finally, this book seeks to place the use of these religious expressions in film into a general historical context, exploring what was going on in church history and in the larger society during each decade over the past hundred years as films evolved. This volume seeks to tease out general correlations between film history and church history, as Hollywood has incorporated bits of piety into its productions, and these representations of worship have both reflected and, simultaneously, shaped a cultural understanding of prayer. The gap between the secular Hollywood establishment and the potential religious market was best captured in an apocryphal tale told by biographer Bob Thomas about Columbia Studio’s legendary Cohn brothers. The two producers debated the prospect of making a religious film. Harry challenged his brother Jack, claiming that he knew nothing about religion. “What the hell do you know about the Bible, Jack? I’ll bet you fifty bucks you don’t even know the Lord’s Prayer,” said Harry. “Oh, yes I do,” boasted Jack. “Well then, let’s hear it.” “Now I lay me down to sleep . . .” “Okay, okay, you win,” Harry said, and handed over the fifty bucks.5 This comic anecdote in which Jack mistakes a common children’s bedtime prayer for Jesus’s instructions on prayer in the Gospels offers two insights. First, that Hollywood did not know much about praying and, second, that it nevertheless knew that religion in film mattered. Cinematic prayers would come to be significant elements of film, intentionally scripted and embedded in Hollywood narrative paradigms, almost like religious product placements. This book examines how films have sought to shape popular ideas about the religious practice of prayer over the past hundred years. It\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n5\n\nargues that these depictions of prayer have not only reflected but also sometimes worked to instruct viewers on how one is called to pray. Tracing the confluence of film and this liturgical ritual of communication from the era of American silent film to the present day, it explores how films have constructed modes of religious piety for both American culture and global consumption. Previous scholarship has chronicled key shifts in religious trends in the United States, placing them in cultural perspective. Sydney Ahlstrom’s A Religious History of the American People provided an anthropological reading of the moral and spiritual development of the United States, while Lary May’s Screening Out the Past laid out the crossfertilization of American society’s and American films’ two distinct social histories.6 So, too, the social church histories of Martin Marty and Robert Wuthnow have provided fresh perspectives on theological currents. For example, Wuthnow’s After Heaven marked a shift in American spirituality, tracing a move from what he called spiritual dwellers to spiritual seekers. Wuthnow argues that up through the 1950s, congregants coalesced within communities, remaining in one tradition mostly in the same sacred places, such as churches, synagogues, and homes. Attending to the communal and private voices of prayer throughout a century of Hollywood films opens a treasure chest of gems and fool’s gold. One discovers several basic facts. First, these films embed practices of prayer on a fairly regular basis. They are more pervasive than most viewers realize, as both incidental and salient moments in film narratives. In addition to Roman Catholic and Protestant petitions, they include Jewish prayers (for example, Steven Spielberg’s Raiders of the Lost Ark, 1981, and the Coen Brothers’ A Serious Man, 2009), Muslim prayers (Mikael Håfström’s Escape Plan, 2013), Hindu prayers (Ryan Murphy’s Eat Pray Love, 2010), and Mormon prayers (Alfred Hitchcock’s Family Plot, 1976). Second, mediated images of prayer provide models, however superficial or satiric, of ways people communicate with God. They show the postures, modes of communication, and range of forms that are recognizable and familiar to young and old spectators alike. Unlike literary and poetic models, however, they are succinct. Third, while they circumscribe what the typical practice of praying looks like and sounds like, they also present alternative examples. For example, the independent and groundbreaking Easy Rider (Dennis Hop-\n\n6\n\n| Introduction\n\nper, 1969), which attacked the American dream, surprisingly celebrated the sincere improvised prayers of Hispanic and hippie communities, showcasing what “true” prayer ought to look like. Fourth, mediated images of prayer are rhetorical events, which can help to shape spectators’ attitudes toward God, religious rituals, and prayer itself. Writers often construct prayers as key parts of the narrative design of films. Someone, usually the scriptwriter, consciously plants prayer in the arc of the story. It either slips in comfortably and unobtrusively or it interrupts the flow of the narrative like a pie in the face. Prayers can reveal aspects of the prevailing theological and religious trends in specific eras, such as the desperate prayers of a country slogging through a Depression or world war or the liberal prayers of a Death of God movement. The peculiar Zeitgeist of a historical period shapes the writers and directors of a film so that the spirit of the culture can intentionally or unconsciously leak into the film’s narrative and dialogue. If true piety is caught and not taught, it will be seen and imitated, not merely memorized. But can piety come from seeing it through a glass darkly, watching it in moving images on a screen, finding the practice embedded in an entertainment medium? As revelatory signs, movie prayers work like slanted mirrors to show us what we do and what we might look like when we pray. Rhetorical scholar Richard Weaver’s classic adage that “ideas have consequences” suggests a logical and provocative extension, namely, that “cinematic portrayals of prayer have consequences.” This book illuminates those portrayals and potential consequences, placing the use of expressions of prayer in film into historical context. It explores what was going on in church history and in society during each decade of the past century in order to shed light on America’s broader relationship with religious currents during these time periods and how filmic depictions of prayer have both reflected and sought to influence religious practice.\n\n1\n\nSilent Prayers (1902–1927)\n\nAmerican society rushed into the early twentieth century, with trains, a few planes, and automobiles moving people quickly from one place to another. A suggestion that Americans suffered from neurasthenia, a nervous restlessness, seemed credible. Even entertainment moved more frenetically, with nickelodeon movies supplanting and speeding up old vaudeville acts of singers, comics, magicians, and dog tricks, all of which had been trundled slowly off the music hall stages. Moving out of the Victorian era into the early twentieth century, the American Protestant church split into fundamentalists and modernists. Classical liberal theology that had permeated German universities began to shape American approaches to faith and practice. The American Roman Catholic Church had swollen with waves of immigrants from Ireland, Italy, and other European countries and remained culturally isolated and entrenched since the Kulturkampf in Prussia. It would not be the last of the culture wars between religious groups and mainstream society in the coming years. Prayers in the post-Victorian era, a time when public agnostics and atheists like Mark Twain and H. L. Mencken took to the stage and newspapers, were vestiges of social religious rituals. Many Americans habitually said grace at meals or insisted that their children say bedside prayers. For some of the devout, these acts kept them tethered to a tradition of faith or introduced them into a communion with God. For others, they became a ritual without meaning. Some used prayers for personal or national gain. In his “War Prayer,” Twain mocked sanctimonious congregations praying for the destruction of their enemies. He scoffed at what he believed was the self-delusion of man, who thinks “he is the Creator’s pet.” He believes the Creator is proud of him; he even believes the Creator loves him; sits up nights to admire him; yes, and watch over him and 7\n\n8\n\n| Silent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\nkeep him out of trouble. He prays to Him, and thinks He listens. Isn’t it a quaint idea?1\n\nHowever, while Twain satirized religious piety, the fin de siècle augured an optimism about social progress and global missions. The 1893 World Parliament of Religions brought dozens of faiths together in Chicago to celebrate the march of civilization in an “elaborate display of religious cosmopolitanism.”2 Protestant modernists would embrace the new century with all its innovative possibilities, including moving pictures, which they championed as a panacea for societal ills. Religious language would become more inclusive. Rather than praying “in Jesus’s name,” prayers addressed God with more elastic and generic apostrophes. With the turn into a modern age, the answered prayer became a modern evangelical apologetic. For the liberal Protestant establishment, belief in divine immanence led to a fresh devotional, practical approach to piety, with a revived belief in prayer, healing, and intercession.3 In 1902 psychologist William James published his Varieties of Religious Experience and offered his reflections upon hearing a “great deal of discussion about the efficiency of prayer.” “Why do we pray?” he asked, to which he quickly responded, “Simply we cannot help praying.”4 During this time, progressive religion and Victorian morality competed for dominance in movies, with the latter trying vainly to maintain a pastoral idyll in the midst of urban progress. Decorum, respectability, and propriety all dictated behavior. By focusing on the Victorian films of D. W. Griffith and the emergence of the American spunk and ecumenical spirit of America’s sweetheart, Mary Pickford, we can see that traditional prayers from the Victorian era dominated the screens of the 1910s. Silent film comedians picked up the ordinary ritual of saying grace before meals and made comedy out of divine conversations of gratitude, yet within circumscribed postures and language. By the end of the decade, however, modernist Cecil B. DeMille was promoting the universal prayer of American civil religion. In essence, the models of prayer offered to the American public on celluloid in the early twentieth century carried on a Victorian propriety rooted in a knowledge of scriptures. The standard prayers were rote, but were on the verge of slipping into more comfortable conversations with the Almighty. One notable\n\nSilent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\n|\n\n9\n\nfilm portended with sly humor this transition from an old, biblically based culture to an American civil religion. In Marshall Neilan’s Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917), Mary Pickford plays the spunky eponymous character, for which she maintained the sobriquet of America’s sweetheart. In Francis Marion’s clever adaptation of Kate Douglas Wiggin’s 1903 children’s novel, her matronly Victorian aunt punishes Rebecca by denying her dinner and orders her to take the dishes into the kitchen. There one tin plate contains a cherry pie, tempting the hungry girl. She lingers over the delicacy, smelling its aroma, running her finger along the edge of the pie, and lifting it to her mouth until she looks up and espies a wall sampler that reads, “Thou Shalt Not Steal.” The Mosaic commandment lays the law down, and Rebecca lays down the pie and ruefully retreats, hands folded prayerfully, from the succulent temptation. But as she shuffles toward the door, she spots another homespun sampler. This one announces, “God Helps Those Who Help Themselves.” She weighs the two competing laws, nods thankfully toward the latter, picks up a slice of cherry pie, and gobbles it down with thanksgiving. The ironic juxtaposition of the two messages is that the second maxim does not come from the Bible. It is an American proverb, from the rascally Benjamin Franklin, and reaffirms the underlying principle of the Hollywood classical narrative film paradigm—namely, that a protagonist makes things happen. An individual American is an actionoriented, causal agent who propels the narrative. It is not biblical law that informs Hollywood films as much as the self-reliant initiative of the American citizen. Mary has left the land of the Victorian tradition and biblical morality for the dynamic independence of the American way and Hollywood hegemony. In the eating of the pie, Mary still shows signs of her gratitude in enjoying something she did not deserve, but the emphasis is on the American way rather than biblical law. The two were becoming more closely aligned through the propaganda of the movies. In their 1929 study of small-town America, cultural sociologists Robert and Helen Lynd saw a link between civic patriotism and religious life.5 And almost everyone in Middletown went to the movies. The key theme here is how a biblically based culture was being transformed into an American civil religion, but such a transition met with resistance. Generally, the moving pictures’ depictions of prayer during\n\n10\n\n| Silent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\nthe first three decades of the twentieth century continued a pious tradition of folded hands and bowed heads. Roman Catholics would cross themselves and Protestants would say grace at meals.6 What is remarkable is that any sacred canopies constructed by various denominations during this era would be undercut by the ecumenism of the movies. The image of the religious American, whether Protestant, Roman Catholic, or Jew, blended into one cinematic cipher, that of the person who prays.\n\nSilent Religious Photoplays Victorian society foregrounded the powerless, generally saints, women, and children, as those whose prayers were heard by God. The Gospel rescued the weak and the perishing. Such Sunday school stories of struggling against evil dominated early nickelodeons. The anguish of wrestling over temptations in one’s personal devotions is the focus of American Mutoscope and Biograph’s silent production of The Temptation of St. Anthony (1902). The film’s story harks back to Saint Athanasius’s hagiography, in which Saint Anthony struggles with the desires of the flesh. During his contemplation of sacred writings and a skull, the latter, unfortunately for Saint Anthony’s piety, mutates into a vision of a nude woman. Yet his desire for her is quickly quenched when she metamorphoses again into a skeleton. The shock of seeing the wages of his sinful desires awakens him from temptation. Such films confronted Victorian hypocrisy, and the prayer to be “not led into temptation” by a visual erotic delight became more frequent. We see similar issues depicted in Ferenc Molnar’s adapted play about marital infidelity, The Devil (1921). Director James Young shows a devilish and suave Dr. Muller (George Arliss) seeking to manipulate two couples as his puppets, demonstrating that goodness can be led astray by temptation. The trusting wife Marie is lured to Muller’s apartment. As she is stripped to her undergarments (with a cross strategically placed over her private parts), she desperately prays for help. Her prayer to overcome temptation is answered when a shining cross appears and flames conveniently consume the devil. The post-Victorian prayer highlights a moral battle in the midst of supernatural and even occult spiritualism. Prayers worked like magic and efficiently chased away dangers.\n\nSilent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\n|\n\n11\n\nIn addition to such paranormal fascinations, sentimental prayers of the era valorized children (especially poor and neglected ones) and their closeness to God. In Biograph’s 1910 film A Child’s Faith, a young woman marries a poor tradesman. They have a child, but the overworked husband dies. The grandfather of the child refuses to help, caring only for his wealth, which he hoards and hides in a wall. The curly-haired granddaughter prays with her mother, folding her hands, kneeling, and earnestly entreating God for help. The grandfather’s money happens to drop through a hole in the wall down into the girl’s lap as an immediate answer to her prayer. When the grandfather retrieves it, the little girl prays once again at her mother’s knee. Conviction strikes the old man and he is reunited with his small family in a hug. The film sets the ritual of prayer as a practice of innocent children, not modern adults. Prayers are the rhetorical means of the powerless to effect change. Prayers function to restore goodness and virtue, to soften the heart of a greedy grandfather, or to save the lost. In the Pickford vehicle To Save Her Soul, Mary, a playful woman, jumps into the lap of a young minister and plays the piano. A musical manager sees potential in the talented young beauty and takes her to the big city, where she becomes involved with a dazzling new set of fast friends. The young minister tries to dissuade her, but to no avail. Her triumphs in the city notwithstanding, the distraught curate resolves to bring her back, and, after various misadventures with unsavory characters, he does. Back at the church organ, they kneel and pray together, pointing to the cross. Subtlety was not an early cinematic practice. In 1912 French filmmaker and magician George Melies released a film entitled Forgive Us Our Trespasses, in which little Danny, living alone with his father, is taught to say the Lord’s Prayer every night. When a kind neighbor takes Danny to town one evening to see a dramatic troupe, the lead actress recognizes Danny as her son. She had abandoned the family years ago, but now repents and seeks to be reconciled. However, Danny’s father sternly rejects her appeals, until Danny repeats the line, “forgive us as we forgive,” and the family is reunited. This notion of forgiveness as dictated by religious decree is a model that recurs throughout silent films of this era. The social gospel advanced by Congregationalists Walter Rauschenbusch and Washington Gladden was widely influential at the turn of the\n\n12\n\n| Silent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\ncentury, with its religiously motivated commitment to social services and concern for the urban poor. In particular, holiness movements led to the formation of groups like the Salvation Army, which provided fodder for silent film scenarios. In D. W. Griffith’s 1909 Salvation Army Lass, Mary Wilson (Florence Lawrence) can’t pay her bills and is taken in by a prostitute, then abducted by a gang of thieves, but is rescued by the Salvation Army. As she witnesses to others in a saloon, Mary rediscovers her old boyfriend stuck in crime and tries to get him to pray with her. He initially rejects her, but seeing a banner proclaiming, “God is My Light; God is my Salvation,” he submits, kneels, repents, prays, and ultimately hugs her. Showing support for the social gospel, Griffith sets forth prayer and charity as major weapons of the temperance movement. Griffith views prayers, rather than the evangelism of do-gooders, as more effective in promulgating social change. In The Drunkard’s Reformation (1909), gospel thumpers do not reform an alcoholic and abusive husband and father. Yet the mother’s prayers for her husband are answered when he and their daughter go to a temperance play. He is convinced not by the Gospel, but by the art of the theatre, a bit of selfpromotion by Griffith of the virtuous power of his own dramatic art. What is significant is that the Victorian Griffith gives women (and children) the power of prayer. Melodramatic prayers of the era are feminine. A more complex plot underlies The Converts (1910), Griffith’s temperance melodrama on hypocrisy, which again uses a woman’s prayers to effect change. The Biograph film begins with a carefree young gentleman disguised as a minister, possibly influenced by Max Beerbohm’s story “The Happy Hypocrite.” An intertitle promises spectators that “The Word rings Truth though uttered by false lips,” an indication that the earthen vessel may not be trustworthy, but the message is. The masqueraded clergy pretends to preach abstinence to those who walk in darkness—saloon frequenters and loose women. Unexpectedly, his artificial preaching persuades a saloon girl, who repents. Drunk jokesters mock her, calling for her to shout “Hallelujah.” When an intertitle declares, “Forgive them for they know not what they do,” she kneels. The scene dissolves to a crucifix on the wall where she has become a settlement house worker to protect abused women, seeking to carry the “Word that restores me” unto “the fallen.” When she encounters the hypocritical preacher, she preaches Christ’s love back to him. Haunted by his guilty conscience, he repents and\n\nSilent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\n|\n\n13\n\nbegins to help others. What he pretended to be, he has become. A woman’s prayers are remarkably efficacious. Griffith uses fewer prayers in his 1915 racist Birth of a Nation. He orchestrates flag-waving battles, gun-blazing, desperate charges by Confederates toward a well-established Union line, inserting scenes of weary parents and their two daughters praying for the boys fighting in the battle; the mother holds a letter from the front while the father clasps his hands over the giant family Bible. Griffith’s crosscutting juxtaposition between home and hearth and the carnage of the war reveals that many prayers were not answered, as the victorious North vanquished its brothers and cousins of the South. In her Dickensian films, America’s movie saint Mary Pickford was the very model of sheer spunk and virtuous mischief. In Pickford, goodness rarely wilted into saccharine bromides. Silent actress Julia Marlowe wrote, “It takes a greater artist to make a good woman sympathetic and thrilling than to make a base woman sympathetic and thrilling.” Pickford made goodness exciting and prayers compelling. Showing ethnic and religious diversity in the slums, Mary Pickford plays the title character in Little Annie Rooney, William Beaudine’s 1925 urban dramedy. At home with her father, an Irish cop, and her rambunctious brother, Annie prepares the meal and seeks to civilize the men. She takes the paper from her father while her brother fixes his tie. When he grabs a piece of bread, she gets her father to pray before eating, slapping the over-eager grasping hand of her brother. After her father is shot, Roman Catholic Annie is invited across the hall to have dinner with her Jewish neighbors. Abie Levy (Spec O’Donnell) brings her into their home and pulls out a chair for her to sit. She finds her place beside his younger brother, Jake. Abie’s father reminds him to put on his head covering, a yarmulke. Davening, the bearded father recites the prayers. As they all dig in to the steaming food, Annie bows her head and crosses herself. Her Jewish neighbors serve her an “extra-special” non-kosher meal, ham, for which she gratefully smiles. While the film previews an ecumenical practice of prayer and generosity of spirit that will mark later decades, it still focuses upon marginalized people seeking God and thanking Him. In John Robertson’s 1922 remake of the melodrama Tess of the Storm Country, the aptly named landowner and Protestant elder Elias Graves\n\n14\n\n| Silent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\nseeks to rid his property of squatters, primarily the Skinner family. Tess Skinner, played by Pickford, befriends Graves’s daughter Teola, who becomes pregnant out of wedlock. When Tess takes care of the baby, the community is scandalized, thinking that the child is hers. Tess finds the baby sick and wants to baptize him before he dies. With a strong dose of Augustine’s notion of original sin, the film emphasizes the necessity of infant baptism. The dramatic denouement takes place during a formal church service, as Tess, bundled up in an old winter coat and boots, trudges decisively down the center aisle of the great cathedral. The congregation stands aghast at such a brazen sight. She moves immediately to the baptismal font while the Episcopal priest watches in silence. The real mother of the child, Teola, stands with the others, but with pained grief. Tess addresses the cleric: “I brought ye a dyin’ brat, preacher, what’s got to be sprinkled.” Graves stares at her with disdain and ironically protests, “The presence of that girl is an insult to every woman in this church!” With pathos, Tess responds, “But the poor little cuss air dyin’. He’s got to be sprinkled or he won’t never see the face of God.” Undeterred, Tess moves quickly to the font, touches the child’s forehead with water, and looks heavenward. Looking at the baby, she kneels, with the priest following her example, bowing his head in prayer. So too does almost all the congregation except the patriarch. Teola prays with great suffering. As Tess offers the child to God, kisses him one last time, and prays, Teola clasps her hands in desperation, but the child is dead. Such an emotional scene illustrated the place of prayer at the moment of death. Prayers for the life of a child resonated with a culture in the early 1900s in which infant mortality rates ran around 10 percent. Martha May Eliot had established the Children’s Bureau in 1912 to curtail such deaths, but their frequency made the fictional story more salient and distressing for many families. While the film again placed the act of praying into the hands of women, it also challenged the tradition of the Book of Common Prayer as the necessary model for praying, as Tess extemporaneously expressed her grief and hope in the vernacular. Mary Pickford’s most resilient performance occurs in director Beaudine’s brilliantly conceived Sparrows (1926), a masterful Sunday school story in the style of Dickens’s best melodramas of children. Running an\n\nSilent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\n|\n\n15\n\nShepherding a flock of orphans in Sparrows (William Beaudine, 1926), Molly (Mary Pickford) instructs them to pray for deliverance in the beginning and give thanks at the end.\n\nillegal orphanage, a “baby farm” in a southern swampland, villainous Mr. Grimes traffics in lost and stolen children. In one deliciously wicked iconic moment, Grimes receives a gift of a rag doll for one child, which he promptly tosses into the quicksand. The willful destruction of the toy reflects his malice toward the hapless children. However, the eldest is teenage Molly (Pickford), whose maternal instincts, pluck, faith, and sheer grit keep the family of orphans intact and safe. She steals potatoes for them to eat and reads the story of the Good Shepherd from an illustrated book. She schemes to escape, sending out messages attached to the tails of kites. They write, “Please come and take us away from the Grimses cause they are awful mean to us . . . we can’t get out the gate and the swamp is full of mud. Molly and 7 orphans and 1 baby. PS Bring something to eat.” As she sends out their kite-plea, she summons the children to kneel and pray with her beside the edge of the swamp. All kneel, including the lame boy with a makeshift cane, fold their little hands, and close their eyes as Mary speaks for them, looking heavenward: “Lord, our other\n\n16\n\n| Silent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\nkite done no good ’cause I guess Your angel had his mind on his harp. Couldn’t You tend to this one personal?” The film cuts to the tattered kite entangled in a tree, as if to test the providence of God. However, an intertitle explains, “But He, in His infinite wisdom, had other plans.” Prayers dot the narrative as the dangers of the swamp threaten from all sides. The sadistic Grimes and his ferocious dog keep the infant inmates corralled. Denied food, the children suffer hunger pangs. When one boy hears of how God watches over the sparrows, giving the film its title, he questions why the Almighty doesn’t look after them rather than the birds. Molly holds a sick baby in her lap, slipping into a weary reverie. She dreams that the barn door dissolves and there in the pasture among a flock of sheep sits the Good Shepherd. He rises, turns toward her, and comes over, carrying His crook with His left hand on His breast. He touches Molly on the head, leans down, and picks up the ailing child. He walks out back to His flock, carrying the infant. The pasture dissolves back to the barn door. As Molly wakes, she looks at the child and realizes that he has died. Her reflective gaze at the child and toward the heavens conveys tender, heartrending, and wistfully joyous emotions. After a fearless escape from dog, quicksand, and alligators, the nursery of children are about to run off down the road, but Molly gathers them together and counts to make sure that they are all safe. Once she retrieves the last stray, she again commands that they kneel and give thanks, pointing to the God who delivered them from their dangers. “Thanks, Lord,” she says. “We won’t never forget Your kindness.” The action completes the circle of prayer. Their deliverance, the film suggests, came not only through the ingenuity and courage of Molly, but through the divine intervention of God Himself. The film punctuates their escape with one last comic reminder. As they are kneeling, eyes closed, beside the perilous waters they had just traversed, an alligator appears and opens his toothy jaws at them, at which they all rise and run away, except for the one rascally stray, who returns to mock the reptile with fingers on his nose. Films of the post-Victorian era emphasized the role of women as primary agents of prayer and the place of prayer in bringing about social and personal change. Prayer worked, especially in transforming\n\nSilent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\n|\n\n17\n\ndrunken husbands and fathers. It helped rescue desperate children, reaffirming biblical principles that God’s eye is upon the little sparrows. For a sentimentalist like Griffith, effective reform stemmed more from personal prayers than social protests. Film prayers reassured viewers that the prayers of righteous women and children would be heard by God. Society held on to these hopes even as it began to find diversions in modern amusements.\n\nSilent Laughter and Prayer While staid mainline churches did incorporate the use of stereopticons, slides, and motion pictures in their sanctuaries, church decorum kept worshippers in solemnity. However, the emergence of energetic evangelists like Billy Sunday unleashed comedy in the pulpits, as the former Chicago White Stockings baseball player ridiculed Satan and saloons. If there could be comedy in his revivals, why could there not be prayer in silent film comedies? During this era, prayers were depicted in benignly humorous ways. In The Cohens and the Kellys (Harry Pollard, 1926), the secularized duo of Jew and Roman Catholic ride a runaway motorcycle in Atlantic City. Fearful for their safety, Kelly shouts, “You better say your prayers.” To which Cohen responds, “I forgot the words.” The phrase “Now say your prayers” would be shouted on many intertitles, such as with Charlie Chaplin in The Floorwalker, when the villain prepares to pummel him. “Now, say your prayers!” Each of the four major comedians of the silent era employed the ritual of prayer for comic effect. Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and Harry Langdon found uses for common religious rituals that would evoke laughter, and for Chaplin, poignant sentimentality. Chaplin combined the act of prayer with his customary touch of pathos in The Kid (1921), a remarkably affecting film in light of the recent death of his three-day-old son. An opening title card promises “A picture with a smile, and perhaps a tear.” As the caretaker for an abandoned child left in an alley, Charlie becomes the reluctant adopted father of the endearing child actor Jackie Coogan as the waif. He tends him and teaches him to survive with a life of petty crime and hard work. The two create a sense of family as they make a haven for themselves in a tenement loft.\n\n18\n\n| Silent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\nJackie Coogan as The Kid (Charlie Chaplin, 1921) pleads desperately for divine help as social service workers abduct him from his adopted father.\n\nCharlie makes a stack of pancakes in their little idyllic hole-in-thewall apartment, and the kid eagerly starts to eat his breakfast. Charlie hushes him and begins his prayer. The kid bows his head into the pancakes, while Charlie looks up and chats with God before saying, “Amen.” Then they both dig in. These two companions share bread and emotional bonding, with the poor and the meek of the kingdom of God being brought together for good. In an emotionally wrought scene, an official from social services comes to Chaplin’s atelier to retrieve Jackie for the orphanage, as Charlie has no visible means of support or legitimate claim on the child. The heartless official and the cop struggle with Charlie until they abduct the kid and throw him into the back of a truck. Jackie’s sad and desperate face looks heavenward; he calls out to God, asking for help. Charlie escapes the police and runs across the rooftops to save his kid. The answer to the kid’s prayer thus comes from above, as Charlie descends to rescue the boy and chase off his institutional kidnappers. Later, when Charlie sneaks Jackie into a flophouse to sleep for the night, the boy kisses his adopted father good night, but then wants to\n\nSilent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\n|\n\n19\n\nkneel beside the bed to say his prayers before going to sleep. In a richly comic sequence of Chaplin trying to hide the kid under the covers and the bed, it is the prayer that draws the suspicion of the proprietor, especially as he approaches the pair and Charlie continues to say the prayer with his little companion, who has disappeared. In the Hal Roach production of Bumping into Broadway (1919), Harold Lloyd introduces his glasses-wearing character as a would-be writer trying to escape the clutches of his overbearing landlady. Harold hangs outside his upper-story apartment, feet dangling. The film then exploits the efficacy of a minor character’s prayer as a complement to the hero’s own journey. Living one floor below, unawares, is the ugliest-looking spinster (with Gus Leonard playing the desperate woman in drag), who prays with arms outstretched, “O Lord, send me a man!” Harold falls into her clutches; she pulls him in by the leg, claiming him as the answer to her prayer. The film slyly points to the irony of answered prayers, showing that one may be unwittingly (and unwillingly) the answer to someone else’s prayer. The “Great Stone Face” comedian, Buster Keaton, set a paradigmatic pattern with his comic scene around the dinner table in Our Hospitality (John Blystone, 1923). As an eastern college boy returning to his southern roots, Willy McCay (Keaton) strikes up a friendship on the train with a lovely girl, Virginia (Natalie Talmadge), who turns out to be the daughter of his family’s nemesis, the Canfields. She invites him for dinner as both are oblivious of the clans’ long-standing feud. When her father and brothers discover his identity as a McCay, they are set to kill him. However, southern hospitality forbids them from harming anyone actually in their house. McCay discovers his dilemma during dinner. The family and their guest sit suspiciously, wary of each other’s every move. The mustached father leers with malice as Keaton rolls his eyes heavenward. In a classic visual scene, the innocent Virginia asks the visiting elderly parson to pray over the meal. He folds his hands with fingertips touching, bows his wrinkled face, and begins. McCay peeks with one eye as the two brothers squint at him, giving new meaning to the admonition to “watch and pray.” The coup de grace comes when the patriarch opens his beady eye to assess the situation, which climactically closes with the “Amen” and the waiter dropping a\n\n20\n\n| Silent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\ndish behind skittish McCay. The prayer serves to unite, however precariously, opposing groups, but the comedy also sets a pattern for future table scenes of saying grace. Christian journalist G. K. Chesterton observed that “it is the test of a good religion that you can joke about it,” suggesting that the assurance of God’s grace gave one the freedom to laugh in His presence. Thus, one could pray with laughter as much as with solemnity, even as one could pray in Dutch as much as in Japanese. Directed by Roman Catholic Frank Capra, The Strong Man (1926) features Harry Langdon playing a naïve Belgian soldier, Paul Bergot, seeking his pen pal, a blind girl named Mary Brown (Priscilla Bonner). He makes his way through America in his quest to find her, working as the assistant to the Strong Man, Zandow the Great. When the Strong Man gets knocked out, the twerpish Bergot must perform his act in a disorderly saloon. Meanwhile, church reformers, led by “Holy Joe,” Mary’s minister father, march around the saloon as if it were Jericho, seeking to bring it down. As they sing and protest, bar rowdies mock the hymn singers. Bergot, however, thinks it is a funeral march (and in a sense, for the saloon itself, it will be) and takes off his hat in respect. The crowd waits for its entertainment in the smoke-filled tavern, waving their hats boisterously and shouting for the performer to get shot out of a cannon. Bergot tries to shush the unruly crowd to respect the funeral. One heckler, holding his mug of beer, mouths off: “The Kid’s right! Let’s bow our heads and pray for poor old ‘Holy Joe’!” He takes off his cap, and Bergot does the same, bowing his head in reverence. Lifting his glass, the heckler shouts, “And if ‘Holy Joe’ must sing, get him an ukulele!” Bergot is stunned at such sacrilege, even while other bar denizens feign religious piety while scoffing and laughing. Snapping his fingers futilely, Bergot tries to restore order and some decorum. However, the drunk continues, and mocks someone more sacred than God: “and may we soon have the honor of entertaining Mary Brown in our midst! A-men!”, even as he baptizes the marching saints outside with his beer. The mocking of prayer by this disruptive saloon gang marks a turning point in Bergot’s actions. He mounts a trapeze, conks out the obnoxious drunk, and then proceeds, however unintentionally, to bring down the walls and house of the Jericho bar. The uttering of the sacrilegious prayer wakens the meek fool and transforms him into an unintentional avenging angel.\n\nSilent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\n|\n\n21\n\nComic prayers during the silent film era came to humanize the image of religious actions. Chesterton, known for mixing serious Christian themes with buffoonery, quipped, “It is not funny that anything else should fall down; only that a man should fall down. Why do we laugh? Because it is a gravely religious matter: it is the Fall of Man. Only man can be absurd: for only man can be dignified.”7 His cheerful Christian perspective celebrated the humility and humor of the slapstick comedies, providing a theological basis for religious laughter. For Chesterton, one need not be solemn and ponderous, but could be light and playful in the worship of God. Such honest laughter seemed more inviting to those who felt oppressed by moral laws. Victorian respectability gave way to comic authenticity, as men could confess to being fools. Along with the athletic outreach of the YMCA, Protestant churches fostered the ecumenical Men and Religion Forward movement, which sought to evangelize men and involve them in church life. Other genres, like the adventure film, would also draw men into a vibrant and virile religion, depicting a representation of muscular prayer warriors.8 Not only clowns and chumps would see the power of prayer, but handsome, dynamic heroes would bow the knee to the Almighty.\n\nMasculine Prayers The fin de siècle unleashed a slew of inspirational literature for men, from Charles Sheldon’s In His Steps (1896) and Lew Wallace’s Ben Hur (1880) to religious western novels like Ralph Connor’s Sky Pilot (1899). Their masculine religion emphasized action over prayer, but by the time they were adapted for the screen, they would call men to the Benedictine motto Ora et labora, to both pray and work. A frontier tradition of tough men would show prayers as words preceding tough, sacrificial actions. By 1916, western actor William S. Hart had emerged as the top movie star, according to the Quigley Poll, which measured box office profits. In part his status was due to his phenomenally popular moral western, Hell’s Hinges (Charles Swickard, 1916). Starring as good/bad guy Blaze Tracy, Hart represented the muscular Christianity that countered what the Victorians presented as a meek and mild Jesus. Hell’s Hinges begins with the ordination of the Reverend Robert Henley (Jack Standing) from an East Coast seminary; however, after his sermon at the Mission of Saint John’s,\n\n22\n\n| Silent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\nThe good/bad cowboy Blaze Tracy (William S. Hart) prays for Faith (the virtue and the woman) while smoking his cigarette and drinking his whiskey in Hell’s Hinges (Charles Swickard, 1916).\n\nhe is considered not-yet-prime-time material for the church. His sister, aptly named Faith (Clara Williams), possesses the character her brother woefully lacks. She serves God faithfully, while he is a weak and selfish youth, utterly unfit for the calling that a devout, love-blinded mother persuaded him to pursue. He is sent west to establish a church on the prairies and be made a man, with his sister accompanying him. Henley arrives into that den of iniquity known as Hell’s Hinges, where neither law nor religion exists. This “Gospel shooter” starts his church in a barn. As he arrives, the villainous saloon owner, Silk, mockingly says, “I reckon it’s a sin to shoot a parson, so I’ll just scare him to death.” Discerning the clergyman’s weak nature, he invites him to hold a service for the dancehall girls. The pimp Silk gets him to drink with the girls and he falls asleep in the bed of a prostitute, spurring the crowd to mock religion. “He’s like the rest of them, a low-down hypocrite and liar. There ain’t no such thing as real religion.” Meanwhile, Faith runs the mission church. When a mob invades the barn service, Blaze recognizes her piety and his own impiety. He wres-\n\nSilent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\n|\n\n23\n\ntles with his conscience. As Henley slides into sin, Tracy moves toward Faith. He sits at a bare table with a bottle of whiskey. Putting down his mug, he puts a cigarette in his mouth and earnestly reads Matthew 21:22: “And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.” He closes the good book, reflects, and prays, “God, if You mean what You say here, I’m askin’ for her.” (The title card shows a sunset with an illuminated cross in the background.) After this conversion, Blaze will become both an angel of judgment in purging the town with fire and a disciple of Faith. His prayer marks his conversion from villainy to ministry, as he “wins” Faith. The film introduces a vigorous, masculine mode of praying, one that reflected the aforementioned Men and Religion Forward movement, an ecumenical trend emerging around 1912 that sought to reclaim male leadership in Protestant churches. It stressed a religious model of strength and action and decried emotional and sentimental appeals. The religious western offered prayers for such heroic saints. The great swashbuckler Douglas Fairbanks, the movies’ version of evangelist Billy Sunday, prays with fervor.9 The Gaucho (Richard Jones, 1927) offers an Argentinean version of the American cowboy, unleashing the frenetic energy of Douglas Fairbanks as the eponymous character who rides the Argentinean Andes. His devil-may-care persona makes him an enemy to the corrupt state and a hero to the people. The first prayer in the film occurs when a shepherd girl (Joan Barclay) falls from a cliff trying to rescue a lamb. After her traumatic tumble beside a pool of water, a radiant vision of the Virgin Mary (Fairbanks’s wife, Mary Pickford, in an ironic cameo) appears, heals her, and invests her with healing powers. With hands folded and luminous face, she whispers a prayer. Poor peasants gather to marvel, kneel, remove their hats, cross themselves, and pray. One grieving mother pleads for her dying child, and, as the girl quietly prays, the miraculous occurs. As she blesses the child with holy water from the spring, the infant is restored to robust health. A panning shot of the amazed and worshipful peasants thanking God highlights this astonishing opening. Upon these holy waters a shrine is built that welcomes pilgrims. A humble padre collects money to distribute to the poor. Both the government’s representative, Ruiz-the-Usurper, and the bandit Gaucho arrive at the City of the Shrine, setting up a battle between forces of institutional evil and the Gaucho’s own bandits. Winning control of the city,\n\n24\n\n| Silent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\nthe Gaucho holds court at a banquet. When the city’s criminals are paraded before him, he becomes their judge. The priest seeks forgiveness for all these sinners. A leper, a victim of the Black Doom, refuses mercy from the priest. The Gaucho tells him to go and kill himself; however, the leper infects the Gaucho with his disease. Losing feeling in his left hand, he prepares to follow his own advice and kill himself over his affliction. The girl of the shrine (now grown into a pious woman, played by Eve Southern) stops him. Citing Matthew 21:22, she tells him, “All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.” The dashing but doubting Gaucho shows his diseased hand and asks, “This?” Looking kindly upon him, she asks, “Do you believe?” He confesses that he doesn’t really know about God, but he trusts her. She leads the doubting cowboy to the pool of the shrine carved into the mountain’s rocks. Amid the candles and crosses, she kneels and prays. He watches and looks at the shrine, bows his head, and weakly kneels in the background. He entreats her, “Teach me to pray.” As he places his good hand on his breast, and his leprous hand in the pool, both his mountain girlfriend (Lupe Velez) and the leper eavesdrop on them. A vision of the Madonna reappears, opening her arms in benevolent charity. As the girl continues to pray, the Gaucho suddenly realizes that his hand is clean. He has been healed! His joy becomes infectious as his girlfriend thanks God. Even the leper raises his own hands in exuberant amazement and praise. As the Gaucho rushes to thank the girl, she points to God. “No, thank Him,” she instructs. The prayers, both during the preface and at this climactic point, alter the narratives and draw characters to God in gratitude and sheer delight. The inspired prayers of the Gaucho matched the manly prayers of the Men and Religion Forward movement.\n\nMelodramatic Prayers More cynical and ambiguous treatments of prayer kept pace with pious depictions as the Roaring Twenties revved into high gear. The post– World War I and influenza era sizzled with new fashions and fads. Churches divided along liberal and fundamentalist lines over doctrinal beliefs and critical approaches to hermeneutics. Prayers in films held on to much moral baggage from the post-Victorian era, but they also expressed a restlessness of flaming youth. The modern era wanted to\n\nSilent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\n| 25\n\nleave the bluenoses behind, giving way to a cynical view of prayer. Manslaughter (1922) fairly represented what director DeMille thought of this emerging audience, which wasn’t much. When spoiled Jazz Age flapper Lydia Thorne (Leatrice Joy) speeds around at fifty-five miles an hour, she epitomizes the immorality of the era. A crusading district attorney (Thomas Meighan) denounces a dancing party, “with its booze and license,” as “no better than a feast of Bacchus.” DeMille flashbacks to Roman-era orgies, with the district attorney as Attila the Hun bringing judgment down on the revelers. In this overwrought melodrama, Lydia tries to bribe a cop with a bracelet of diamonds, only to find herself handcuffed with steel. She prays the old prayer desperately, “Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.” DeMille was notorious for sneaking sin into his biblical spectaculars while still holding a religious pose. He would tantalize with titillating sex and sin and then disapprove with a “tsk tsk.” Prayers could cover a multitude of sins. *** In W. S. Van Dyke’s The Pagan (1929), a brutal, manipulative trader, Brother Slater, oversees his young, half-caste ward Tito (Dorothy Janis). Henry Shoesmith (Ramon Novarro), a lazy native plantation owner, pursues her. Tito must attend to Bible reading lessons, stumbling over the verse “for the heart is dee-ceet-ful above all things and des-pair-ate-ly wicked.” Praying and hymn singing (“Yes, Jesus loves me”) occur in the church, but Tito is more interested in the nature religion of Henry. During a service, Slater preaches interminably, but the lush outdoors distract Tito as she yearns for the heavenly sunshine. When the minister calls for prayer, even those who fell asleep during his sermon awake to join in. When Tito asks a bare-chested Henry, “Why not go to church?,” he answers, “Too hot in church. God is everywhere, so why go to church?” Unlike the Griffith pieties, these 1920s prayers function as mere rhetorical decoration in the film and express an emerging skepticism about praying. While prayers reminded spectators of religious traditions, they also suggested that they may not be sufficient to keep people from trespassing into more carnal temptations. Married to an elderly millionaire, Theodora (Gloria Swanson) prays with her hands clasped before her face, seeking deliverance from the temptation of the dashing Lord Bracondale (Rudolph Valentino) in Be-\n\n26\n\n| Silent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\nyond the Rocks (Sam Woods, 1922). She dare not trust herself in his presence and so kneels beside her bed in an anguished posture of prayer. “Lead me not . . .” At a Whitmonday pageant, she wrestles between marital fidelity and this illicit romance. While on a northern African expedition, her elderly husband, a selfish, ailing old duffer, intercepts a letter addressed to her from Bracondale and realizes that his existence keeps them apart. He dies so the kids can marry and be happy. While her prayer is answered, so are her desires, as Theodora is kept from temptation until her husband conveniently sacrifices himself. Jazz Age prayers focus on the unfulfilled needs of the plaintiff, seeking wish fulfillment more than right behavior. The appearance of Freudian wish fulfillment and a focus upon sexuality began to crowd into religious life. Two versions of British author Somerset Maugham’s novella Rain take place in the exotic world of a Far East British colony. Raoul Walsh’s Sadie Thompson with Gloria Swanson and Lionel Barrymore appeared in 1928, and four years later, Lewis Milestone’s sound adaptation of Rain featured Joan Crawford and Walter Huston. Both films followed the narrative pattern of threat, repentance, rape, and suicide as reformer Alfred Davidson tries to convert prostitute Sadie only to experience his own spiritual disintegration through sexual obsession. The films are packed with prayers that sound as hypocritical as the missionary, and yet also have a potency that alters Sadie’s life. Professional reformer Davidson uses the words of prayer without power. He preaches incessantly with bromides that “the knife of reform is the only hope of a sin-sick world” and “a righteous man will not hesitate to renounce evil.” His encounter with Sadie upends his insincere posing. She tells jokes about the farmer’s daughter and playfully pinches and gooses the marines of Pago Pago. She lives by the motto “Smile, bozo, smile, for no matter how tough it is today, it’s bound to be worse tomorrow.” Reformers in the film do not smile; only genuine, natural people do. Wearing a dark suit in the tropical climate, the stern Davidson smolders in the heat. After he first says grace, standing with his hand covering his face as if in anguish, and symbolically indicting his own blindness to spiritual needs, he tells the governor of the island that the morals on the island must be cleaned up. He finds the natives so depraved that, he confesses, “I actually have to teach them what sin is.”\n\nSilent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\n| 27\n\nIn Sadie’s hut, on a torrentially rainy evening, Davidson confronts Sadie, who desperately worries what might happen to her: “Repent, Sadie, and you will have no cause for fear.” She sits on her bed and Davidson pulls up a chair, looking down at her as he says, “Pray, Sadie Thompson, yield your soul!” Wiping her brow and wringing her hands, she cries out from her vulnerable position, “I don’t know how to pray.” With an odd gleam in his eye, he exclaims, “Poor child! Repeat after me.” She glides with seductive openness and gazes back up at him. “Put your hands together like this.” She complies and he cites the Hebrew prophet Isaiah, “O God—though my sins be as scarlet—, wash me in the blood of the Lamb—, save me from Thy awful vengeance—.” She grows calmer, but wearies and faints. Davidson leaves her room with his arms raised in prayer, thanking God for her conversion. After three tortured days of loneliness, repentance, and redemption, she is tamed, which her marine boyfriend sees as hypnotism. Davidson leers menacingly, telling her that Satan has tested her. Yet as he prays, lust overtakes him. He dreams about Sadie and rubs his hands with guilt even as he tries to fold them to pray. He comes into her room and confesses that he has been “seeing things in the dark—flaming-hot eyes— Aphrodite—Judas!” An ellipsis suggests that he commits suicide in the morning tide, his unbridled lust and hypocrisy exposed. His prayers did not even save his own soul. The sound version of Rain follows the same plot of the dour, legalistic moralist trying to redeem the woman. In offering her a free key to salvation and trying to feed her the bread of the spirit, Davidson gives her a chance “to be saved.” He comes on with unrelenting ferocity: “You are an evil woman, liar. Kneel, Sadie Thompson, kneel and repent.” She retorts that such a mealy-mouthed reformer like Davidson “ain’t a minister; you don’t fool me,” a sop for religious audiences to divide the authentic minister from its counterfeit. Davidson blackmails her with threats of deportation, entreating her to pray for forgiveness. She responds, with wretched and despairing emotions, “I am bad, but I want to be good, but I don’t know how.” Davidson responds, “You got to serve your time.” Out of frustration she shouts, “Your God and me could never be shipmates. Tell Him that Sadie Thompson is on her way to hell.” She accuses him of believing in torture: “You know you’re big and you’re strong and you have law on your side.\n\n28\n\n| Silent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\nYou hang me and be damned.” Just as she accuses him of not understanding, he begins to recite the Lord’s Prayer as a mantra to block out her pleas and accusations. Then he interrupts his own performance to proclaim, “O Lord, hear Thou my prayers for this lost sister. Close Thy ears to her wild and heedless words.” He continues to recite the Our Father as she kneels, weeping copious tears. She begins to say the prayer with him. “Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.” She kneels humbly as he hovers above her, and the rain keeps coming down and the native drums beat loudly and incessantly. Back from the brig, her marine finds a subdued Sadie: “What’s he been doing [with Sadie]?” The answer is “Praying. Praying.” In spite of her claims that he’s a holy man, the marine counters that “this hyena’s got you so hypnotized, it’s like dope.” When Davidson is found drowned in the morning, Sadie is liberated from his sanctimony. In both versions of the film, prayer finds itself a victim to the stronger desires of the flesh. Freudian psychology trumps evangelical self-control, and even earnest prayers cannot save a modern man from his own passions. Other directors were inspired to express their religious convictions on the screen. Where Griffith saw “man made in the image of God” but ruined by Satan, another young, naïve director, King Vidor, opted for an optimistic view of human nature as fundamentally good. His early exposure to Mary Baker Eddy left him a lifelong adherent of Christian Science. In the January 1920 issue of Variety, Vidor published his filmmaker’s “Creed and Pledge,” promising not to produce anything that would injure anyone, nor anything “unclean in thought or action,” nor to “deliberately portray anything to glorify mischief, condone cruelty or extenuate malice.”10 Such principles of “goodness” would guide his filmmaking. Fifty years later, Vidor confessed his hypocrisy: “I might have been stupid enough in my first few pictures to put out a creed that I wouldn’t make pictures with violence or sex. It was an advertisement, you know. . . . Right after it came out in the paper, I got arrested for playing poker.” Publicizing a moral creed of forgoing sex in his films may have stirred nary a ripple in a religious periodical, but for a virile film director to shout from the headlines of a trade magazine was a burst of misguided idealism. This passion for virtue may have been subverted in his shoot-\n\nSilent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\n|\n\n29\n\ning of his religious adventure, Sky Pilot (1921), not so much regarding the moral content of the film, but in Vidor’s extramarital affair with his star, Colleen Moore. As one wag put it, “Sinning has a way of changing one’s view of sin.” As seen in the Somerset Maugham adaptations, sinning also had a way of eviscerating the power of prayers. Modern men and women of the 1920s found themselves depicted in cinema as victims to unbridled ids. The Miracle Man (George Loane Tucker, 1919) starred the incomparable Lon Chaney as the Frog, part of a gang of hoodlums exploiting a local faith healer called the Patriarch (Joseph Downing). Eventually, each criminal, converted by his charity, vows to carry on the Patriarch’s good works. One extant clip of this film movingly contrasts the bogus miracle of the Frog and an authentic miracle of a crippled boy. After the Frog fakes his performance, a young boy receives faith to walk without crutches. One can easily understand why it was “the most highly praised and successful picture of 1919.”11 Historian Benjamin Hampton saw The Miracle Man as enhancing the prestige and power of directors as “audiences everywhere gave their heartiest approval to the production, and the powerful cult of the Christian Science Church welcomed it as propaganda for Mrs. Eddy’s teachings.”12 But such prayers brought more attention to a biblical model for both spiritual and physical healings. In the same period, the emergence of a Pentecostal movement, with more orthodox denominations like the Assemblies of God, also emphasized spiritual gifts such as faith healing through prayer. Lon “Man of a Thousand Faces” Chaney starred in Shadows (Tom Forman, 1922) as the Chinese laundryman Yen-Sin. A young minister arrives at a fishing village at the same time that Yen-Sin washes ashore from an apparent shipwreck. The minister proceeds to marry a local widow and tries to convert Yen-Sin to Christianity, but Yen-Sin dismisses the hypocritical faith of the minister’s congregation. A rival suitor attempts to dishonor the minister by blackmailing him. Yen-Sin, however, exposes the culprit’s schemes. Yen-Sin fully expects the minister to take revenge on the blackmailer, but instead the minister forgives him in an act of Christian charity. Witnessing a sincere act of forgiveness convinces Yen-Sin of the truth of Christianity. In response, he accepts the minister’s God as his own.13 What was remarkable about these last\n\n30\n\n| Silent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\ntwo conversion stories is how they suggested that the life of a Christian, rather than his prayers and preaching, influenced evangelism. The grace of such clergy was the miracle. Religious films waned in popularity in the consumerist society of the 1920s, except for DeMille’s biblical blockbusters. He was wily enough to insert sufficient naughty bits to attract the sinners and to combine biblical dramas with contemporary parables. For example, in his 1923 spectacle The Ten Commandments, DeMille co-opted the Jewish history of the Exodus for a modern morality tale of a mother whose two sons take different paths: John obediently keeps the commandments and becomes a carpenter, while Danny breaks them. In particular, Danny spurns the commandment to not steal, using inferior materials to build a church with shoddy materials, building “upon sand.” One rainy night, the mother preaches to her agnostic son about the fear of God and prays for his compliance. John, however, emphasizes the New Testament story of Jesus healing a leper, a sign of grace and mercy. Danny ignores his mother to his own disaster when his work comes crashing down, killing his mother, who finally recognizes that she should have taught him more of the love, rather than the law, of God. In one of the last silent/sound film hybrids of the decade, director Michael Curtiz exploits DeMille’s technique of parallel narratives in his spectacular Noah’s Ark (1928). Starting with a shot of the ark beached on Mount Ararat, haloed by God’s rainbow covenant, the film unleashes a blast of judgment upon the wicked who scheme to build a tower whose top may reach unto heaven. When God orders Noah to build the ark of gopher wood, His servant utters the prayer of Jesus, “Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.” With gold becoming man’s only god, evidenced in the anachronistic golden calf, Curtiz presciently structures his film to condemn the profit speculators in the days before World War I, such as the power-hungry and lascivious sadist Nickoloff (Noah Beery). Ironically, on the eve of the Wall Street market crash, Curtiz juxtaposes greedy investors and the wicked hubris surrounding the Tower of Babel, with his story of the imminent world war by focusing upon an international caravan traveling the Orient Express run. Curtiz includes a Chaucerian collection of types in his cavalcade. One businessman ridicules a pious minister and prates, “The Bible won’t work nowadays; science is god.” A sarcastic Frenchman mocks, “There\n\nSilent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\n|\n\n31\n\nis no God, gentlemen. There is only a Goddess. Her name is woman— and she’s a Devil.” Nickoloff barks out that Soviet military might is the only god. To all of these, the devout cleric responds, “Only with the eye of Faith can we see God’s eternal plan.” The comrade condescendingly adds, “Faith is food for fools and invalids. If there is a God why doesn’t He show Himself?” The final word comes from the Bible reader: “Peace brother, lest He show Himself in wrath.” Immediately the dramatic denouement unfolds with a horrendous accident. The minister/chaplain reads, “The Lord hath said, ‘measure not thy wrath against thy child.’” Then he prays, “O God, have mercy on Thy children! They know not what they do!” Immediately, as some are rescued and sinners are killed, the minister compares the flood of blood to the inundation during the wicked times of Noah. “As the Ark prevailed upon the flood waters, O God, so let Thy righteousness prevail in this Deluge of Blood!” After God destroys those who worship the false gods, the film ends with the rainbow of a new covenant, along with the armistice, celebrating that war shall be no more. God seems to answer prayers; however, it is a theologically and politically optimistic hope that will not prove true, no matter how many silent prayers were uttered throughout the first decades of Hollywood movies. The era of silent films charted a trajectory of church life from Victorian traditions of the effective prayers of women and children in Griffith films, leading to a feminization of church life, to a more dismissive approach to religion during the Roaring Twenties. Women not only took a more active and dynamic role in providing religious education for the young, but also demonstrated leadership in the temperance movement, women’s suffrage, child labor, global mission work, and other social and religious concerns (even in promoting moving pictures for children in churches).14 In the beginning, films often depicted prayers as playing central roles in converting sinners or restoring families. Men and women would confess their sins and pray that they be kept from temptation. With energetic evangelists like Billy Sunday modeling a masculine vitality, a men’s movement developed, with westerns and film comedies showcasing virility and humor practiced in the presence of God. Virtues of honor, courage, sacrifice, and humor attracted more men back to\n\n32\n\n| Silent Prayers (1902– 1927)\n\nchurch than had attended in the Victorian age, with candid and comic prayers offered by actors like Hart and Chaplin respectively. This silent film era introduced prayers to innumerable spectators, even teaching them the words on the intertitle cards. Such intertitles not only taught immigrants to read, but taught them words to pray. Some were pious exemplary models of a child’s or mother’s petition for a father or husband to be transformed. Prayers in westerns and comedies demonstrated that one could be a man of God and speak candidly or humorously with God. But then some films raised questions about the efficacy of prayers. However, in the early 1920s, with the church dividing into fundamentalist and progressive camps, churches found themselves divided by culture as much as theology. Conservatives began to retreat from cultural engagement and liberals found themselves out of step with the new hip morality. Ironically, Cecil B. DeMille, the filmmaker of religious spectaculars, privileged sin over sanctity in his Jazz Age melodramas, squeezing the religious element out of prayers. Religious concerns took on less significance in a culture of prosperity. Prayers that did appear showed the hypocrisy of religious figures. In an era of plenty and pleasure, one went to a “petting pantry” (a movie theatre) not to see religion but to watch “whoopee.” But an economic disaster on Wall Street altered this trend of easy, libertine living. By the 1930s, moving pictures attracted more spectators, but also drew religious protests from conservatives and liberals alike against their rampant immorality. Curiously, a clamor for national censorship would spark an ecumenical agreement among diverse religious leaders. Protests against sin in movies and the ridicule of religious figures would unite Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish leaders to censor celebrity characters like Mae West and to hold Hollywood accountable for how they represented prayers. With impending hardships on the horizon, spectators would look back to God, and films would speak more gingerly in addressing the divine.\n\n2\n\nCensored Prayers (1927–1939)\n\nThe 1930s generated desperate prayers in America as the Depression, the Dust Bowl, unemployment, and poverty plagued the land. However, most films during this golden age of Hollywood did not reflect the need for jobs, food, and rain. From gangsters and Broadway musicals to screwball comedies and Mickey Mouse cartoons, crowds were amused to distraction. FDR’s radio homilies sought to assure the American public that the only thing we had to fear was fear itself. In his history of the liberal Protestant magazine the Christian Century, Elesha Coffman outlined how the journal’s editorial convictions paralleled many cultural dilemmas facing Americans.1 Caught up in the rift with fundamentalists, the journal emphasized its concern for the social gospel and for the tools of modern reason. Tackling such topics as race and immigration, it promoted what it saw as civil rights for the common good; yet it remained wary of the Roman Catholic Church. For all its liberal leanings, the periodical revealed a cultural conservatism, mostly in its relation to movie censorship. Its religious moralism exposed a frustration with Protestantism’s own moral czar, Presbyterian elder Will Hays, as it soured on his impotence in the face of the entertainment industry. Disturbed about the consequences of the film industry’s effects upon the moral conscience, it admitted that while it preferred “clean movie makers to censors,” it did “not fear censorship as much as film filth.”2 The periodical constructed an ordered and meaningful cultural identity centered upon the teachings of Jesus that shaped liberal Protestant thought in the early twentieth century. Up through the 1920s, major religious traditions looked askance at one another. However, change came in the 1930s. As historian Garry Wills argued, a new Jewish/Catholic/Protestant puritanism arose during the Depression, one that renounced the “binge morality of the Roaring Twenties,” the flamboyant desire for pleasure and speed.3 Hard times required religious discipline. 33\n\n34\n\n| Censored Prayers (1927– 1939)\n\nDuring this time, Hollywood colluded with censorship boards and religious organizations to keep its films showing. The Breen Code, following the toothless Hays Code, sought to establish a national morality in entertainment. Led by energetic Roman Catholic laity like Joseph Breen, the Code dictated screen content. The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) laid out its rubric for the “Don’ts and Be Carefuls” in 1927, resolving that the screen should not ridicule clergy or use profanity (“hell,” “damn”) or the name of God (“Lord,” “Jesus,” “Christ”) “unless used reverently in connection with proper religious ceremonies.” However, enforcement was quite lax. Only when an amendment to the Code established the Production Code Administration under the leadership of Breen in 1934 did Hollywood provide teeth for the agreement. Until then, however, religion and sexuality were often shared themes. One safe realm outside the then-vigilant eyes of the Motion Picture Production Code Board was representation of African American and marginal forms of worship, such as Pentecostalism, as sensitivities to racism and respect for black religious traditions had not yet equaled concerns for ridicule of mainstream religion. The invisible institution of the slave church may have been overlooked in the church history records of the day, but it appeared publicly in the movies.\n\nRace Prayers Race movies in the silent era had addressed hypocrisy among the black clergy in films like Oscar Micheaux’s Body and Soul (1925). In his film debut, Paul Robeson plays both the malevolent Reverend Isaiah Jenkins and his good brother Sylvester. The prayers and preaching of Jenkins hark back to the sham religion of the adaptations of Somerset Maugham’s Rain. Micheaux sharply reaffirms that not only good people pray. Director King Vidor sought to depict realistic black melodrama in his early sound film Hallelujah (1929), with dollops of enthusiastic religion. Prayers infuse the narrative as ordinary parts of the cultural life of poor black cotton workers. Children pray at night for one another, a precursor of the television Walton family prayers. Sharecropper Zeke (Daniel Haynes) falls for a juke-joint girl, Chick (Nina Mae McKinney), and loses his money. Meanwhile, his mother\n\nCensored Prayers (1927– 1939)\n\n|\n\n35\n\nsenses that something is wrong and implores the Lord to “have mercy on my soul.” Implicated in the death of his brother, Zeke repents to his father, who points him toward heaven. Contrite and inspired, Zeke preaches on God’s grace and forgiveness: “The Lord done showed me the light. The Lord done revealed the truth of His creation. . . . Come, O Lord. Come to that land of green pastures and clean waters. Come to the Lord.” He is transformed into a charismatic preacher. At one revival baptismal service, Zeke’s impassioned preaching about a train to heaven puts Chick under religious conviction. The entire congregation “gets on board” the train to glory, with even Chick crying out to God. But even filled with the Holy Ghost, the seductive Chick leads Zeke astray again, suggesting that prayer may not be sufficient to keep one from temptation. Scholar Judith Weisenfeld has identified prayers, the Ten Commandments, Bible reading, and singing spirituals as essential elements of southern faith, but also sees sexualized religion underlying some enthusiasm.4 Both religious ecstasy and sexual passion are inextricably linked in Vidor’s film, where former blues singer Chick can belt out “Give Me That Old Time Religion” and simultaneously fuel her tempting allure. The intimacy of prayer and worship was frequently intertwined with physical attraction in southern revivals. In Hal Roach’s Our Gang episode The Little Sinner (1935), Spanky plays hooky from Sunday school with Buckwheat and Porky. Wandering into the woods, they encounter a black Pentecostal baptism ceremony, replete with praying, hallelujahs, singing, and the most charismatic worship shown on film to that point, enough to send the boys quivering back to public school. Like the prayers offered at other Pentecostal and marginal religious groups, the prayers of African Americans were depicted as emotionally charged and treated with ambiguity. The exposure of such prayers on film brought charismatic rituals from the backwoods margins into the mainstream, showing more staid denominations how others worshipped. What these portrayals of church people did reveal was a rediscovery of both the embodiment of worship, with the body praying as much as the mouth, and the power of sin in religious lives. Liberal theology, with its optimistic hope in progress, contrasted with real lives of churchgoers who struggled with their own sins, with some interpreting the Depression as a sign of God’s judgment. Movies would also reveal that religious fallibility was not confined to race movies.\n\n36\n\n| Censored Prayers (1927– 1939)\n\nHumanized Ministers While the Production Code Administration kept Hollywood from ridiculing the clergy, it didn’t forbid making them human. Clergy struggled throughout the Depression, economically and professionally. As Methodist ministers were transferred from parish to parish and evangelists wandered across the country, clergy had to adapt to the harsh times as much as anyone else. The Oklahoma Land Rush formed the backdrop for Wesley Ruggles’s Academy Award–winning Cimarron (1931), one such story of an itinerant minister/lawyer/editor/sheriff, Yancey Cravat (Richard Dix), who transports his wife, Sabra (Irene Dunne), and family to settle in the boomtown of Osage. Based on Edna Ferber’s bestselling novel, the epic story compares the settling of the territory to the biblical narrative of Creation. The charismatic Cravat brings order to Osage, preaching his first sermon in the rudimentary gambling casino, GreatGotcha’s-Hall-of-Chance, with the announcement that all are welcome. In fact, all come, including Indians, whom Cravat defends as victims of persecution and injustice. Even the town’s lone Jew, Sol Levy (George Stone), is welcome. (When told by an old biddy that one of her ancestors signed the Declaration of Independence, he quips, “That’s all right. A relative of mine, a fellow named Moses, wrote the Ten Commandments.”) So, too, the church welcomes disreputable women who swagger in and sit up front. When asked whether he feels nervous, Cravat tells his wife that he would rather “plead to a Texas jury than preach a sermon to this gang.” Nevertheless, looking at a congregation that looks “as queer at church as a mule does in the front parlor,” Cravat conducts the “first meeting of the Osage Methodist, Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Congregationalist, Baptist, Catholic, Unitarian, and Hebrew Church.” He acknowledges that as a lawyer he has experience convicting horse thieves, but “while I know my Bible from cover to cover, this is the first time I have been requested to speak the word of God in His temple; for any soul, no matter how humble or sordid, becomes, when His word is spoken in it, His temple.” He takes his text from Proverbs, “There’s a lion in the street,” and his allegorical interpretation aims at a murderous ruffian standing menacingly at the back of the meeting. He is the lion, or “I might say ‘jackal’ or ‘dirty skunk,’ which wouldn’t be sacrilegious,” which threatens the good\n\nCensored Prayers (1927– 1939)\n\n|\n\n37\n\npeople of the town. The killer draws his gun, but Cravat shoots him, explaining that “under the circumstances, we will forgo the sermon and conclude the service with a brief word of prayer: ‘Bless this community, O Lord. Amen.’” The remarkable aspect of the film is the plethora of prayers that dot its landscape. When Cravat goes traveling abroad, his long-suffering wife, Sabra, publishes a newspaper called the Wigwam and emerges as a congresswoman in her own right. She leads the family in prayers as well; sitting at a table with her two children, and an empty chair set for Cravat, she tearfully prays, “We thank Thee for Thy blessings, O God, and we pray that You will watch over us all while we are separated. Spare our dear ones and bring us all together again in safety and happiness. Amen.” Immediately, her husband reappears. Women, men, and children pray, and the efficacy of their prayers is astounding. So too, the country at large found itself in need of prayers as migrations of family members seeking work separated loved ones. In Alfred Santell’s whimsical melodrama Polly of the Circus (1932), a cheeky and spoiled trapeze artist, Polly (Marion Davies), falls during a performance and is sequestered in the parish home of Rector John Hartley (Clark Gable) to recuperate from her fractures and fever. Their verbal sparring leads to the inevitable romance. As protests against immorality in Hollywood films mounted, this film slyly raised subversive issues of censorship, with bluenoses protesting the figure of Polly on advertising posters. What makes the film clever is the incorporation of prayers and religious discourse on the side of the titillating circus vamp. The handsome and witty Hartley makes clergymen appear urbane and suavely sophisticated (well, he is the nephew of an Episcopalian bishop). Polly flirts with him, saying, “Didn’t you break the Fifth Commandment in college?” Hartley responds, “No, that would be ingratitude.” “Well, what is the Fifth Commandment?” she asks, thinking it has to do with sex. “Honor thy father and thy mother.” “Oh.” In their courtship, Hartley brings Polly an illustrated Bible and copies of True Confessions. She chooses to look at some of the Bible’s “hot stuff.” Talking about whether he would get married, she says, “All your wife would have to do is learn her catechism and you’d give her a kiss every Ash Wednesday. And she would have to sleep in the woodshed during Lent.” He laughs.\n\n38\n\n| Censored Prayers (1927– 1939)\n\nHer coup de grace, however, occurs when she reads to him from the book of Ruth, “Whither thou goest, I will go; your people will be my people; your God will be my God.” It is the best pickup line she could have used. However, when they marry, the vestry will not accept their rector having a circus girl (read foreigner in the Ruth story) as his wife. He calls the congregation to confess their sins, pointing out their own manifold sins as recorded in the Book of Common Prayer. As an exemplary model of church leaders, Hartley prays and lives out his prayers. As the Depression leveled social and economic strata, so the respectable rector weds the itinerant entertainer. The alloy of church and entertainment reflected the growth of radio ministries and religious showmanship in the 1930s. Sinclair Lewis had penned his satire Elmer Gantry about bogus religious leaders in the mid1920s. Gantry’s exploits, however, were mild compared to the antics of Pentecostal evangelist, divine healer, and pioneer in religious broadcasting Aimee Semple McPherson, who went through three husbands before settling in to her center of welfare services and evangelism in 1923. She incorporated a network of churches into the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel. Despite her shady scandals, her preaching reached out to the dispossessed and lost, expressing the fullness of God’s love and joy. Her services made spellbinding use of vaudeville and theatrical showmanship, with scenery, costumes, props, drama, choirs, and an aggressive public relations machinery.5 They offered therapeutic blessings to those who came. In Frank Capra’s The Miracle Woman (1931), Barbara Stanwyck, in a bravura performance, plays Sister Fallon, a not-too-subtle allusion to McPherson, whose Angeles Temple satirist Mencken would describe as the wildest nightlife in southern California. Gospel preaching joined with superb showmanship and sparked the religious followings of growing celebrities like McPherson.6 Quoting Matthew 8:15 (“Beware of false prophets that come to you in sheep’s clothing”), the film offered an onscreen “rebuke to anyone who, under the cloak of Religion, seeks to sell for gold, God’s choicest gift to Humanity—Faith.” As the film opens with the congregation singing “Holy, Holy, Holy,” Fallon enters the church and takes her father’s pulpit. Fallon delivers a powerfully riveting sermon, blasting the hypocrites who underpaid her father and abetted his premature death. Recognizing\n\nCensored Prayers (1927– 1939)\n\n|\n\n39\n\nher talents, Hornsby, an unscrupulous promoter passing by, persuades her to hit the road to make some money as a freewheeling evangelist. Her religious work expands into a radio ministry, and the film cuts to an impeccably dressed blind veteran and music composer, John Carson (David Manners), who writes a suicide note that ends with “forgive me.” He stands by the window of his fourth-floor apartment and prepares to leap out. Providentially, across the apartment building, a poor woman rocking her child is listening to the radio and the voice of Sister Fallon wafts over to him, arresting his act as he attends. The trouble with most people is that they’re quitters, they’re yellow and the moment there is any sort of test, they cave in. The difference between a man and jellyfish is the fact that a man has backbone. What did God give him a backbone for? To stand up on his feet. That’s what real men do. Beethoven wrote his greatest symphony when he was deaf. Oscar Wilde wrote his greatest poem in jail. And Milton, a blind man [John laughs], gave us Paradise Lost. It is easy to forgive sinners, but it hard to forgive quitters.\n\nAs the sermon fades off, he laughs and chooses to live. With his sweet and nosy housekeeper, Mrs. Higgins, he attends one of Sister Fallon’s sermons. Sister Fallon stands in a cage with several lions, American and Christian flags mounted, wearing a flowing white gown, in prayer posture with arms raised: “The grace of our Lord be with you all. Amen.” A loud “Amen” resounds from the congregation. Then she begins her spiel to invite those who doubt to join her in the cage of lions. “Isn’t there one among you who trusts the Almighty? Didn’t my Lord deliver Daniel? Why not every man?” At the film’s finale, Sister Fallon realizes how others exploited her, turning her evangelism into a circus. She chooses to expose the sham sideshow. In her farewell sermon, she again attacks hypocrites, adding, “You’re not a hypocrite if you admit it,” which is what she does. The film paralleled the questionable exploits of the female evangelist, yet it affirmed the efficacy and power of prayer, even from sinners. Religious leaders were exposed both as human sinners and God’s ordained. Such is the fictional character of Casy, created by John Steinbeck in his 1939 novel The Grapes of Wrath, who transforms from a preacher weak with the women to a union organizer, paralleling many Roman Catholic priests and others who join labor unions and the\n\n40\n\n| Censored Prayers (1927– 1939)\n\nchurch. Their prayers for justice were put into action, even as President Roosevelt adopted Pope Pius XI’s 1931 encyclical Quadragesimo anno, which promoted economic justice and helped shape the New Deal. Another charismatic woman of tremendous faith appeared on screen the following year. In director John Cromwell’s Spitfire (1934), Katharine Hepburn plays Trigger Hicks, an independent hillbilly country girl who sings, “At the Cross, at the Cross, where I first saw the light” to her black cat and talks to toad-frogs. As she steals a page from a magazine, she sings “Jesus, Lover of My Soul.” Welcoming an engineer (Ralph Bellamy) whom she thinks is a doctor coming to fix up someone she beaned with a rock, she says, “Reckon doctors must pray. If they didn’t, folks would die before they got there.” Then she prays over the fellow she stoned. “Lord, let [the masher] live. I’ll even let him kiss me, if he wants to.” The man asks, “Who taught you so much about praying?” “God,” she answers unashamedly. When Trigger comes upon that engineer, Fleetwood, and another, his married friend Stafford (Robert Young), building a dam, they marvel at her spirit and pluck. Bright and defiant, she combines guileless simplicity and a literal faith with superstitious backwoods skills in faith healing that some view as witchcraft. She is just an ordinary Christian who follows the biblical sayings on her illustrated Sunday school Bible verse cards. Kneeling beside an old granny’s bed, Trigger prays, “Good Lord, I know Granny ain’t much account, but she does help folk sometimes with her herb doctrine. Don’t let her die there, please, Lord.” Then reading a Bible picture card about Jesus and little children that quotes Matthew 7:7 (“Knock and it shall be opened to you”), she focuses on the phrase “knock.” “I wonder why ya knock? Well,” she says, and knocks on a bench several times and looks back up to God, “Thank ya, good Lord, and amen.” Her prayers follow a simple, literal formula. But when the granny is seemingly raised from the dead through her prayers, Trigger is viewed with both awe and suspicion. Astoundingly for Hollywood, the one who prays and heals has the most common sense and good reason. She is human in the best sense. When Aeta, her slow-witted single neighbor, wants God to give her a husband, she asks Trigger, “You reckon Mr. Simmons would take me to a picture show if I ask God?” To\n\nCensored Prayers (1927– 1939)\n\n|\n\n41\n\nTrigger Hicks (Katharine Hepburn) converses directly with God in John Cromwell’s Spitfire (1934), literally obeying the scriptures to ask, seek, and knock, especially knock.\n\nwhich Trigger dismissingly says, “Don’t bother Him with such things.” Then she continues to intercede for her friend: “Good Lord, I didn’t want to trouble You about it, but what could I do? Please give her a little more sense, for Jesus’s sake. Amen.” Trigger’s prayer recognizes that God cares for little things like sparrows, but sees that human folly does not know how to pray. When an adulterous Stafford tells Trigger that she is beautiful, she retorts that she will have to pray for his eyesight. She holds to a rule of prayer that one “can’t pray for yourself.” Thus, when she discovers that Stafford, who had kissed her, is married, and she has to give up a baby that she rescued from near death, she looks up to God, pulls out another Bible picture card, and reads, “Blessed are they who do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.” Having suffered deception and calumny, with tears in her eyes, she struggles to understand righteousness: “I reckon if you’re full of righteousness, you don’t need anything to eat, or somebody to love.” As she separates the laundry, she prays for the little baby and quotes an appropriate prayer for the clothes she is washing: “Good Lord, though\n\n42\n\n| Censored Prayers (1927– 1939)\n\nyour sins are as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow.” However, when the ill-used baby grows sicker, she chooses an illustrated card that promises, “If you ask anything in my name, I’ll do it.” In Christ’s name, she explains, means in the way He asks. “God knows if we don’t.” When the baby dies due to his own parents’ neglect, the mother accuses Trigger of witchcraft. Even the resurrected Granny is after her, but she declares to all her persecutors, “The baby is dead. Don’t know why I prayed for ya. Jesus says love your enemies; do good to those that hate ya. Love ya and pour coals down on ya.” Sensing failure in her ministry, and feeling that her prayers have been selfish, she burns her cards, except for one.
