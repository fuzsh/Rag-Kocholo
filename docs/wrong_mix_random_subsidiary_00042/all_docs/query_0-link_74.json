Compiled and Published by EARL C. & MAY (MILLER) FROST 793 18th Street San Bernardino, California Printed in the United States of America Pacific Coast Publishers Redwood City, California 1954 PREFACE 1155756 The authors began the initial compilation of this work in 1931 while on a trip to California. An old aunt gave some of the records and thus started the germ that grew into a desire to have the history recorded in print. Four trips have been made through the Middle West and South to gather records in many counties and courthouses, as well as interviewing a great many descendants, visiting several ancestral homes, and writing innumerable letters. If all of the letters that were written had been answered this work would be much more complete. Every effort has been made to give only facts, but it is inevitable that errors creep in. This book is not indexed by pages, but by serial numbers which make it much easier to locate a given person. Find in the index the name in which you are interested and note the number, then locate it on the left hand side of the page. Under the heading \"issue\", all of those who are carried forward have their serial number after the name. To locate the history of such a person turn forward until the serial number is found on the left side of the page. This book has a Part One and a Part Two, because the book had been prepared for publication. Much additional records came in later, and it was found necessary to add Part Two, which has its own Index. The number system makes it easy to connect the two parts. The writers have gained much pleasure in compiling this work, not to mention the satisfaction of having the family recorded, and on that basis it is commended to you and the future genera¬ tions of DeJarnettes and allied families. EARL C. & MAY M. FROST INTRODUCTION The origin of the name DeJarnette is French, and though there are many spellings in use in the United States, all of the names are descended from the first ancestor in this country, Jean (John) deJarnat. The form most in use today is DeJarnette, while many use DeJarnatt. A Georgia line writes deJarnette. In the old records in Abingdon Parish, Glou¬ cester County, Virginia, the name is variously spelled Dejurner, Dejurer, Dejurnat and Dejernat. Probably the multiplicity of spellings in the Church records is due to the fact that the clerks spelled the name as it sounded to them. It is conceded by all DeJarnette descendants that the immigrant ancestor was Huguenot; that he left France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. There is no doubt that he left France by way of the Port of La Rochelle, be¬ cause it was the stronghold of the Huguenots. After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 great throngs of this sect left France. Some remained in Holland for a time, while others went to England. Great numbers emigrated to America. All of those who went to America had to touch at an English port to get permission before proceeding. In 1690 King William sent a large body of French Protestants to Virginia. In 1699 600 more arrived there under the leadership of Phillip DaRichbourg. John DeJarnette came to Virginia in this group. He probably had land in Gloucester County, Virginia, because the births of his children are recorded there in the Abingdon Parish Register. The county records being destroyed during the Civil War, no proof remains, except the Parish Register. The fact that John wrote deJarnat signifies that the family belonged to the Nobility. In a set of French books by Saint Alais, \"Nobilaiare Universal DeFrance\" there is only one family of similar name, noted thus \"Jarno (de) Jarneau, Jarn&ud, ou Jarneot\". First mention of the name was the 24th of March, 1454 when Jean deJarno acquired the land of the Seguiniere. Antoine deJarno or Jarnaud is mentioned in 1526. Marc deJarno or Jarnaud received the order of Saint-Jean of Jerusalem in 1544, thus acquiring Nobility. The family was called Pont-Jarno, or Bridge-Jarnos because they lived by a bridge, their home being an ancient fort at Poitiers. Marc was Mayor of Poitiers. Estates were mentioned which passed in succession through the eldest son, the account of the family ending in 1805. Younger sons sought their fortunes elsewhere. \"Armes: D'azur - a trois tetes et Col de eigne d'argent posees deux et un. Supports deux lions d'or, cimier une tete et col de eigne d'argent; ac- coste de deux demi-vols de meme, devise: SPES MEA DEUS. ARMORIAL GENERAL, COTE POITOU, Page 33, No. 67\". Translation: Coat of Arms: On a blue field are three swans' necks and heads of silver, placed two above one. The supports are two lions of gold. The crest has a head and neck of a swan in silver, flanked by two half wings of the same. Motto: My Hope is God.

JEAN deJARNAT (John DeJarnette)born in France circa 1680; died, presumably in Gloucester Co., Va. He married circa 1703, MARY MUM- FORD, born in Abingdon Parish, Gloucester Co. , Va. , 1683; died 1765 in Prince Edward Co., Va. (dau. of EDWARD & MARY (Watkins) MUMFORD). The children of Edward & Mary (Watkins) Mumford were: 1 - Mary Mumford, b. 1683 (deposition) d. 1765. 2 - Edward Mumford, bapt. 7-15-1685. 3 - Daniel Mumford, bapt. 10-22-1687. 4 - Joseph Mumford, eldest son & heir. The births of Joseph and Daniel were recorded in the Abingdon Parish Register. (Copied from the Virginia Historical Genealogies, by John Bennett Boddie). There is more data on the Watkins and Mumford lines in the book referred to. Jean deJarnat petitioned for Naturalization April 18th, 1705, as shown by the following document: \"LEGISLATIVE JOURNALS OF THE COUNCIL OF COLONIAL VIR¬ GINIA, Vol. 1. (From the Public Records Office, London, Colonial Office, Class 5, Vol. 1412 pp. 561, 604). \"At a General Assembly Summoned to meet at her Majestys Royal College of William & Mary adjoining the City of Wil- Iiamsburgh the 17th and begun the 19th of March, 1702, in the second year of the Reign of our Soverign Lady Anne by the Grace of God of England, Scot¬ land, France and Ireland, Queen Defender of the Faith etc. , and thence by several prorogations continued and held at Her Majties Royal Capital the 18th day of April MDCCV in the IV year of Her Majties Reign.

A Petition of Joseph Chermeson and A Petition of Jean deJarnat, and Gabriel Maupin, Jean deLaune, John James Veillon, and John Guy Rey praying for natur alizacon, were read and referred to ye Consideracon of the House of Burgesses\". Most of the early Colonial Records of Virginia have been destroyed and the above is the only source of information on John's naturalization. Tradi¬ tion has it that Mary, widow of John, moved to Prince Edward Co. , Va. , with her son-in-law and daughter, Jacob and Eleanor (DeJarnette) McGehee. Mary's will, of St. Patrick's Parish, Prince Edward Co., Va. , was dated April 24th, 1765. She devised \"to son-in-law Jacob McGehee, my featherbed with the whole furniture and bedspread, likewise whatever belongs to me after my decease\". Jacob McGehee sole Executor. Wits.

Equity Court Records from Abbeville, South Carolina (sent by Mrs. T. Lyle Davis, Confederate Lodge, Abbeville, S.C.). Edward Davis and wife and others vs: Fenton Hall, Israel Pickens and others, in equity Abbeville, June, 1814. 3 This bill is brought by the heirs of the late Elias Dejernett of the Com¬ monwealth of Virginia against the security in the Administration bond of Sarah the widow of the said Elias, who administered on the estate with the will annexed, and against Israel Pickens who intermarried with the widow on her removal to this state. The bill states that Elias Dejernett made and exe¬ cuted his last will and testament on the 23rd April, 1783, and shortly after died **** leaving a number of children who with their husbands are complain¬ ants in this suit. Elias Dejernett bequeathed sundry negroes to his children specifically and particularly, the girl Jennie to his daughter Elizabeth and three negroes to his wife during her life and at her death to his children, and devised his land specifically one tract amongst others, to his wife during her life. The Executors having refused to qualify, administration with the will annexed was granted to the widow who entered into the usual administration bond and gave security. The bill also states that E. Dejernet died intestate of some personal estate, to-wit a negro named Tom, some cattle, horses, hogs, sheep, household furniture, plantation tools, some tobacco, and a bond for money due by W.Z. Glass. That the widow removed to this state and two of the security, and that she intermarried with Israel Pickens. The bill charges that before her said intermarriage she purchased a tract of land from Fenton Hall and that it was agreed between the legatees and Sarah the widow and Fen¬ ton Hall that the negro Jennie should go in payment of the land and that the daughter, Elizabeth (to whom the negro Jennie was bequeathed) should have Tom **** upon condition that the title to the land should remain to Nancy Davis, one of the Testator's children **** and who is one of the complainants, but which condition she and her husband, Israel Pickens afterwards refused to comply with. The Bill charges that considerable property of the estate df De¬ jernett came to Israel Pickens and on his marriage with the widow and administratrix. The Bill is stated to be filed to compel the Defendants, Israel Pickens, (his wife being dead) and the security in her administration bond to account for the property **** and to distribute the same and to account for the profits of the specific legacies from the death of the Testator till the delivery of them, and to compel the performance of the Trust **. **** the answer of Fenton Hall in his own right and as Executor of Nat. Hall security in the administra¬ tion bond admits that Elias Dejernett executed his will as stated by complainants and that the Executors refusing to qualify, the widow Sarah administered ***. It admits that the testator left undisposed by his will, a negro child Tom (then 18 months old) horses, cattle, hogs, tobacco and bond from Glass (before mentioned). Admits that the administratrix and Fenton Hall and Nat. Hall removed to this state where she married Israel Pickens, and Nat. Hall died leaving Fenton Hall his Executor; that the statement in the Bill relative to the purchase of the land is untrue, the real facts being as follows, - Mrs. Sarah Dejernett and Fenton Hall purchased together a tract of land called Lees Shoals for 200 pounds and she gave her note for her part of the purchase and this defendent was her security. He paid for his half of the purchase with his funds and she gave a negro girl Jennie in part payment of her note and she and Mr. Pickens, after his intermarriage with her, paid off the balance of her note out of their own funds **♦*. the girl Jennie had been bequeathed to the daughter Elizabeth (who afterward married Mr. Joab Maulden) but she refused **** and the administratrix prevailed on the heirs to release their interest in the unbe¬ queathed negro Tom to Elizabeth **** which they did ****. The defendant states that all of the legatees got their specific legacies and they lived with their mother and were fed, clothed, and maintained by her in a manner suit¬ able to their condition in life and until they were married and on their mar¬ riages respectively they were provided in many little matters from their mother's funds and also received cattle to the amount of 14 head. ***♦. It was therefore ordered and decreed that the bill be ordered dismissed as to all the claims, except as to the value of the negro slave Jennie. **** de¬ creed that Israel Pickens do pay to the complainants, the value of the said girl Jennie at the time she was delivered to Mr. Lee **** with interest on that value from that time to the time of payment **** Signed Henry W. DeSaussure. Davis and et al vs Hall, Pickens et al Decree Abbeville , S. C. , June 1814. 4 5. FRANCES DeJERNAT (of 4) married REV.
