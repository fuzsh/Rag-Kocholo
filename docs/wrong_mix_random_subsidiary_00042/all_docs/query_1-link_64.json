        "text": "Amy Winehouse, an English singer and songwriter, was a notable personality in the music industry. She left an indelible mark with her distinct voice and soulful compositions. Winehouse was born on September 14, 1983, in London. She was introduced to jazz music at a young age by her uncles, both of whom were professional jazz musicians. This early exposure played a significant role in shaping her musical style and preference for jazz. Winehouse attended the Sylvia Young Theatre School and later the BRIT School, where she honed her talent and laid the groundwork for her future career. Winehouse's debut album, Frank, released in 2003, immediately established her as a rising star in the UK music scene. The album was critically acclaimed, fusing elements of jazz, pop, soul, and hip-hop that showcased her unique vocal style and songwriting prowess. Her breakthrough, however, came with her second album, Back to Black, in 2006. This album, featuring hits such as Rehab and You Know I'm No Good, resonated with audiences worldwide and catapulted her to international fame. Back to Black earned her five Grammy Awards in 2008, making Winehouse the first British woman to win five Grammys in one night. Despite her meteoric rise to stardom, Winehouse battled personal issues throughout her career, most notably struggles with substance abuse and mental health. Her life and career were cut tragically short when she died on July 23, 2011, at the age of 27. Yet, in her relatively short time in the spotlight, Amy Winehouse managed to leave a lasting impact on the world of music.\n\nAmy Christine Dumas (born April 14, 1975), better known by her ring name Lita, is an American professional wrestler, animal welfare activist and singer.

Born on September 16, 1971, in Newton, Massachusetts, Poehler's journey towards stardom began at Boston College where she developed her comedic skills as a member of the improv troupe My Mother's Fleabag. Following this early spark of talent, she moved to Chicago to join the illustrious Second City Theatre, known for its production of top-notch comedians. Poehler's career took a significant leap when she co-founded the Upright Citizens Brigade, an improvisational and sketch comedy group that started in Chicago but later found fame in New York City. The group's success led to a self-titled show on Comedy Central, catapulting Poehler into the limelight. However, it was her stint on NBC's iconic late-night comedy show, Saturday Night Live (SNL), from 2001 to 2008, that truly solidified her place in the comedy world. Her impressions of celebrities and politicians, coupled with her original characters, left audiences in stitches and earned her a Primetime Emmy nomination. Beyond SNL, Poehler continued to make waves in the entertainment industry. She starred as the ambitious and quirky Leslie Knope on the beloved television series Parks and Recreation, a role that earned her a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Television Series Musical or Comedy in 2014.

Adams gained recognition after starring in Steven Spielberg's biographical crime film Catch Me If You Can alongside Leonardo DiCaprio.

She then transitioned seamlessly into blockbuster films such as Disney's musical romantic comedy Enchanted, where she earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. Her ability to portray complex characters extended beyond lighthearted roles; she demonstrated depth and versatility through powerful performances across various genres. Notably, these include playing formidable characters like Charlene Fleming in The Fighter, Sydney Prosser in American Hustle, and Lynne Cheney in Vice, which collectively earned her three more nominations at the Oscars for Best Supporting Actress and another one for Best Actress.
