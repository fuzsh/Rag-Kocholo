Hard to make out lyrics, do not turn this up louder if you're using earphones. Loudest noises are very loud and very scratchy/scratchy.

Sound levels were unbalanced in the venue so the audio has been boosted. This unfortunately also boosts the noise caused by the two people I was seated next to. To the left of me, there was a loud laugher who drank from a flask that clinked. To the right was a very loud, heavy breather/sniffler who randomly whinny'ed, pulled a water bottle out of a plastic bag in the middle of the title song, drank it louder than I've ever heard anyone ever drink, constantly moved around in his seat and punched and spoke to his friend. There is sometimes a bit of shuffling as I tried in vain not to capture these distractions.

Alex trips off the stage in 'Miracle Song' (you can hear her go 'I'm fine!') and in the scene after she exaggeratedly steps carefully off the stage (which is why there's a lot of laughter and some applause seemingly out of nowhere). One of the girls in the audience has a really loud distinctive laugh, which causes Alex and Danny to corpse a bit in Act 2 (you can hear Danny say 'are you ready'). Sorry, I got a bit fidgety toward the end of Act 1 and was rustling my ticket for a bit.\n\n​\n\nAnyone Can Whistle - Southwark Playhouse - May 3, 2022 (Matinée) (magicinthemess’ master)\n\nFORMAT: M4A (untracked) [56.6MB]\n\nCAST: Alex Young (Cora Hoover Hooper), Chrystine Symone (Nurse Fay Apple), Jordan Broatch (J.

Typical noise to be expected from an outside recording, and some shuffling as I tried to protect my phone when the rain got worse (you can hear people around me discussing the weather at this point as well). It’s unclear which ensemble was on that night so unfortunately the cast list is not complete. NFT except through master.

Recorded from 5th row center orchestra. Significant amount of applause cut out. The first and last track are largely applause numbers (the intro and the bows), but I included them anyway.

Very close to the speaker on that side, so some of the louder songs are a bit overly loud (particularly the \"screechy\" sounding Squip effects). Dialogue is all crystal clear and awesome sounding.

Only issue is really with the sound design of the show, not the recorder/master: a couple of songs are just much louder than the others (particularly 'Do It For You' and 'Allie McAndrews') which makes it hard to understand the lyrics/hear the singing even when you are in the theater.

Act 2 opener Shes Here was restaged with no platforms, different screen effects, and new dialogue. The second half of the song was cut and replaced with a short reprise of Get Her Back sung by the citizens of Bettys world. During the part in Take it to the Next Level when Raymond stands on the desk holding a mic, a spinning disco light effect is projected onto the stage and onto the actual theatre walls, making the audience (including me) erupt with laughter. Jasmine receives a well-deserved 40 second standing ovation at the end of Something to Shout About. At the end of Act 2, the quick-change with the two directors is back, but restaged to happen without wires later into the song. Includes speech by director/choreographer Jerry Mitchell.\n\n​\n\nThe Boys in the Band - Broadway - May 12, 2018 (Matinee) (Preview) (hi_im_joe's master)\n\nFORMAT: M4A (untracked) [51.2MB]\n\nCAST: Jim Parsons (Michael), Zachary Quinto (Harold), Matt Bomer (Donald), Andrew Rannells (Larry), Robin de Jesús (Emory), Michael Benjamin Washington (Bernard), Brian Hutchison (Alan), Tuc Watkins (Hank), Charlie Carver (Cowboy)\n\nNOTES: This is the performance where Jim Parsons fractured his foot during the curtain call.
