I thought I actually knew him from school as he looked familiar but I couldn’t place where from. Then the next day I noticed him again, this time in the restaurant and that’s when the penny dropped. I got permission from the Maitre d to approach him and ask for his autograph. He couldn’t have been nicer so I was able to tell him how much I loved the film Love Actually and his line about the big knickers in Bridget Jones. He was absolutely lovely with me, sat me down and had a good chat about his films and how he loved Durham Cathedral.\n\n“This experience taught me the importance of not being overawed by people, no matter who they are. Just be yourself and people will warm to you.”\n\nBack to hub"
