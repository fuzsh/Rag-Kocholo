        "text": "CAST AND CREATIVETEAM\n\n(click on a photo to download image)\n\nRupert Holmes (Book) has won Tony awards as an author, lyricist and composer. His most recent Broadway musical Curtains earned him the 2007 Drama Desk award for Best Book of a Musical, as well as Tony nominations for both Best Book and Best Additional Lyrics. Prior to that, he received a Tony nomination for Best Play (and won the Touring Broadway Best Play award) for Say Goodnight, Gracie. His comedy-thriller Accomplice won him the second of his two Edgar awards from The Mystery Writers of America. His Broadway musical The Mystery of Edwin Drood won the Tony award for Best Musical, for which Holmes also singly won Tonys for Best Book, Best Lyrics and Best Music. He received the identical honors from the New York Drama Desk and a fourth award for Best Orchestrations. He is also an award-winning mystery writer whose first novel was made into a motion picture starring Colin Firth and Kevin Bacon, and whose short stories have appeared in such prestigious anthologies as Best American Mystery Stories. He also created and wrote AMCâs critically-acclaimed television âdramedyâ \"Remember WENN.\" His current non-musical theatre projects include the first stage adaptation of a John Grisham novel, A Time to Kill, which will premiere in 2011 at Washington, D.C.'s Arena Stage and his new stage version of Agatha Christie's Witness for the Prosecution, written with the approval of Dame Agatha's estate. He has recently finished stage musicals of: My Man Godfrey with Urinetownâs Mark Hollmann; book and lyrics for the Jerry Lewis comedy classic The Nutty Professor, with Marvin Hamlisch as composer; and Secondhand Lions with the songwriting team of Alan Zachary and Michael Weiner. He is delighted to return to San Diego and The Old Globe with a work that pays tribute to his friend and songwriting mentor, Sammy Cahn. Sammy Cahn (Lyrics) The songs of lyricist Sammy Cahn have been recorded by virtually every major singer of the 20th Century and are firmly ingrained in the American Songbook. He was nominated for a record 26 Academy Awards for lyric writing, and won four times, also a record. With Saul Chaplin, Cahn began writing numbers for vaudeville acts at the renowned Cotton Club and had his first success in 1935-36 with âRhythm is Our Businessâ and âUntil the Real Thing Comes Along,â written for the Jimmy Lunceford Band, and 1937âs âBei Mir Bist Du Schoen,â a huge hit recorded by The Andrews Sisters. In 1942, Cahn joined with Jule Styne in Hollywood and together they wrote songs for 19 films, including Frank Sinatraâs early films Anchors Aweigh and It Happened In Brooklyn. They won an Academy Award for âThree Coins in the Fountainâ and also wrote the Broadway musical High Button Shoes. Sinatra introduced Cahn to composer Jimmy Van Heusen in 1955, and together they wrote the title song for the 1955 Sinatra film The Tender Trap and a TV musical version of Our Town that included the Emmy Award-winning âLove and Marriage.â Their long association with Frank Sinatra led to Sinatra's recording 89 of Cahn's songs, including âCome Fly with Me,â âOnly the Lonely,â âAll the Wayâ (Academy Award), âHigh Hopesâ (Academy Award), âCall Me Irresponsibleâ (Academy Award), âThe Second Time Aroundâ and âMy Kind of Town.â Cahn and Van Heusen also collaborated on the Broadway shows Skyscraper and Walking Happy. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1972. In 1974, Cahn performed a one-man show on Broadway called Words and Music and toured with the show numerous times in the years that followed. Sammy Cahn died on January 15, 1993. Jimmy Van Heusen (Music) was one of the most accomplished songwriters in the history of American popular music. He received 14 Academy Award nominations over the course of his 40-year career, and won four times. Van Heusen began writing songs while still in high school. In 1933, he took a job as a staff pianist with Remick Music Publishing in New York City and was soon put under contract as a songwriter. Collaborating with lyricist Eddie De Lange, he produced nearly 20 hit songs. By 1939, Van Heusen had started working with another lyricist, Johnny Burke. Together, the two began their own publishing firm and collaborated on the Broadway shows Nellie Bly and Carnival in Flanders, as well as over 30 films. Under contract with Paramount Studios, Van Heusen and Burke moved to Hollywood in 1940 and together they wrote many hit songs for Bing Crosby, including the Academy Awarding-winning âSwinging on a Star.â In 1956, Burke semi-retired from songwriting and Van Heusen started another successful partnership with lyricist Sammy Cahn. Their catalog includes âCome Fly with Me,â âOnly the Lonely,â âAll the Wayâ (Academy Award), âHigh Hopesâ (Academy Award), âCall Me Irresponsibleâ (Academy Award), âThe Second Time Aroundâ and âMy Kind of Town.â Cahn and Van Heusen also collaborated on the Broadway shows, Skyscraper and Walking Happy. Frank Sinatra recorded 85 of Van Heusenâs songs, more than any other composer. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1971. Jimmy Van Heusen died on February 7, 1990.
