        "text": "East Pakistan to Bangladesh is an intimate, yet action-packed narration of real-life events experienced by Brig. (R.) Saadullah Khan’s 27th Infantry Brigade in the 1971 War. It is also Khan’s ode to his brave soldiers who fought gallantly by his side. In his rundown, Khan reveals Pakistan surrendered too early in a war that could have been won. Brig. Saadullah Khan offers a revelatory insight into secrets of the 1971 war that some would rather bury. It tells a frame-by-frame story of the combat from someone who was right in the midst of the fight. He saw with his own eyes how his soldiers? sacrifices were discarded and victory stolen from just within their grasps.\n\n“Zafar represents the dawn of a new era. Perhaps we are coming out of medieval times of silent policymaking by the well-connected to putting out ideas and developing conversations on important issues. I commend Zafar for contributing to a conversation on national policymaking.”\n\nDr Nadeem-ul-Haque,\n\nVice Chancellor\n\nPakistan Institute of Development Economics\n\n“These articles not only analyze Pakistan’s economic challenges but also offer valuable insights and evidence-based recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders alike, making them essential reading for anyone interested in the country’s economic future.”\n\nDr Moeed Yusuf\n\nVice Chancellor\n\nBeaconhouse National University\n\n“Out of the Box” is more than a compilation of economic opinions; it is a mosaic of experiences, ideas, and resilience. Zafar Masud’s miraculous survival serves as a metaphorical lens through which readers, without negating the challenges facing Pakistan’s economy, are encouraged to adopt an OOTB approach to rescue the economy and strengthen Pakistan’s societal fabric.”\n\nDr Abid Qaiyum Suleri\n\nExecutive Director, Senior Research Fellow\n\nSustainable Development Policy Institute\n\nStep into the world of Farrukh Sohail Goindi, a modern-day Renaissance Man whose intellect, courage, and tolerance shine brightly. In his latest work, “The Thirty Two” Farrukh Sohail Goindi presents a collection of vivid portraits that span the spectrum of human experience.\n\nFrom the towering figures of politics and literature to the quaint charm of two towns and the melodic resonance of a song, Farrukh Sohail Goindi’s canvas is as diverse as it is captivating. With meticulous detail and unwavering objectivity, he unveils the essence of twenty-nine significant individuals, each a testament to the rich tapestry of our times.\n\nYet, “The Thirty Two” is more than just a compilation of biographies. It is a testament to Farrukh Sohail Goindi’s boundless creativity and his ability to weave together disparate threads into a cohesive fabric. Like the ebb and flow of the ocean, his words pulse with life, offering profound insights into the human condition.\n\nFarrukh Sohail Goindi has crafted a masterpiece that is as enlightening as it is entertaining. “The Thirty Two” is a gem that will surely stand the test of time, inspiring readers to embrace diversity, courage, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.\n\nAs World War II ended, the United States stood as the dominant power on the world stage. In 1947, to support its new global status, it created the CIA to analyze foreign intelligence. But within a few years, the Agency was engaged in other operations: bolstering pro-American governments, overthrowing nationalist leaders, and surveilling anti-imperial dissenters at home.\n\nThe Cold War was an obvious reason for this transformation?but not the only one. In The CIA, celebrated intelligence historian Hugh Wilford draws on decades of research to show the Agency as part of a larger picture, the history of Western empire. While young CIA officers imagined themselves as British imperial agents like T. E. Lawrence, successive US presidents used the covert powers of the Agency to hide overseas interventions from postcolonial foreigners and anti-imperial Americans alike. Even the CIA?s post-9/11 global hunt for terrorists was haunted by the ghosts of empires past.\n\nComprehensive, original, and gripping, The CIA is the story of the birth of a new imperial order in the shadows. It offers the most complete account yet of how America adopted unaccountable power and secrecy abroad and at home.\n\nThe New Makers of Modern Strategy is the next generation of the definitive work on strategy and the key figures who have shaped the theory and practice of war and statecraft throughout the centuries. Featuring entirely new entries by a who?s who of world-class scholars, this new edition provides global, comparative perspectives on strategic thought from antiquity to today, surveying both classical and current themes of strategy while devoting greater attention to the Cold War and post-9/11 eras. The contributors evaluate the timeless requirements of effective strategy while tracing the revolutionary changes that challenge the makers of strategy in the contemporary world. Amid intensifying global disorder, the study of strategy and its history has never been more relevant. The New Makers of Modern Strategy draws vital lessons from history?s most influential strategists, from Thucydides and Sun Zi to Clausewitz, Napoleon, Churchill, Mao, Ben-Gurion, Andrew Marshall, Xi Jinping, and Qassem Soleimani.\n\nPakistan and American Diplomacy offers an insightful, fast-moving tour through Pakistan-U.S. relations, from 9/11 to the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, as told from the perspective of a former U.S. diplomat who served twice in Pakistan. Ted Craig frames his narrative around the 2019 Cricket World Cup, a contest that saw Pakistan square off against key neighbors and cricketing powers Afghanistan, India, and Bangladesh, and its former colonial ruler, Britain.\n\nCraig provides perceptive analysis of Pakistan?s diplomacy since its independence in 1947, shedding light on the country?s contemporary relations with the United States, China, India, Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan. With insights from the field and from Washington, Craig reflects on the chain of policy decisions that led to the fall of the Kabul government in 2021 and offers a sober and balanced view of the consequences of that policy failure. Drawing on his post?Cold War diplomatic career, Craig presents U.S.-Pakistan policy in the context of an American experiment in promoting democracy while combating terrorism.\n\nThis book provides not only a detailed account of the mysterious personality of Bayazid Ansari, the Roshniya Movement but also explores the sixteenth century political, religious and cultural landscapes of the Pakhtuns’ borderland. It paints a picture mostly based on primary and authentic secondary sources and its scientific analysis of the tribal and spiritual resistance offered by the tribes to Mughal imperialism. It tries to present the contextual situation of the age obtaining around the event that has been buried in the sands of history. This work challenges the established concepts with regard to Bayazid and his movement terming it as incidental collaborators of the Mughals. Given its non-conformist approach the book will generate a debate among scholars on this very important episode of the Pakhtuns’ history.\n\nProf. Dr. Sayed Wiqar Ali Shah\n\nHistorian, former Dean FSS, QAU, Islamabad.\n\nThe book under review paints a beautiful picture of the tribal and spiritual resistance offered by Pakhtun society against the tyranny of Mughal imperialism. It not only covers the mysterious aspects of Bayazid Ansari’s maverick personality, but also seeks to explain and interpret the intellectual basis of the Roshniya movement. Dr. Himayatullah certainly deserves appreciation, as he has successfully attempted to present the contextual situation of the age obtaining around events, the details of which still remain buried in the sands of history. He has also explored the roles of famous characters, with their thoughts and actions and has explained their strengths and weaknesses. His effort seems to be in accord with the requirements and standards of scientific inquiry. His scholarly effort also seems to be in line with the new parlance of modern historiography.\n\nProf. Dr. Ghulam Qasim Marwat\n\nQurtuba University of Science and Information Technology, Peshawar.\n\nThis is an incredibly valuable work of history and scholarship. Dr. Yaqubi’s work is thoroughly rooted in a deep consideration of the sources. Unlike other approaches that may interpret Bayazid through present day political aspirations, this work finds a way to interpret the context of Bayazid’s moment through a careful analysis of the Roshani and other contemporary works. That’s fantastic.\n\nDr. William Sherman\n\nUniversity of North Carolina, USA.\n\nISBN: 9789694026695\n\nPublisher: VANGUARD BOOKS\n\nSubtitle: BAYAZID ANSARI AND THE ROSHNIYA MOVEMENT\n\nAuthor: HIMAYATULLAH YAQUBI\n\nThis is a blow by blow account of the Imran Khan regime 2018-2022 that promised so much and delivered so little.\n\nThe “IK story” began in 2011 when Pakistan’s military establishment determined to secure a political alternative to the dynastic Bhutto-Sharif regimes that had alternated for over two decades. In 2014, the military prodded Imran to launch his narrative of “35 punctures”, a reference to the alleged “theft” of the 2013 elections that brought Nawaz Sharif to office. Winding its way through various long marches and dharnas to destabilise the Sharif regime, it roped in the Supreme Court under two Chief Justices of Pakistan, Saqib Nisar and Asif Khosa, to knock out Nawaz and culminated in the 2018 elections that were blatantly rigged to “select” Imran into office.\n\nThis book charts Imran’s rise and fall, starting from the “Same Page” narrative of a firm partnership between Prime Minister Imran Khan and the Army Chief, Qamar Javed Bajwa, that propped up his regime, to the time in 2021 when the same doctrine was abandoned after it became an acute embarrassment for the military and its chief.\n\nInterwoven into the fabric of Imran’s demagogic politics was the ruthless ambition of two generals, one of whom sought an extension in tenure (COAS General Bajwa) and the other an elevation to the post of army chief (DG-ISI General Faiz Hameed). In the event, this unholy team couldn’t manipulate the system to achieve its ends.\n\nThis book charts the monthly miscalculations of Khan’s regime in the summer of 2021 after the transfer of General Faiz Hameed from the ISI to the Peshawar Corps, enabling the combined opposition to cobble the wherewithal of a successful No-Confidence Motion in April 2022 that finally felled Imran Khan.\n\nThis book is an indispensable read for students of political science and history who wish to understand how even the best laid institutional plans of powerful people fall by the wayside at that altar of personal ambition.\n\nISBN: 9789694026688\n\nPublisher: VANGUARD BOOKS\n\nSubtitle: IMRAN KHAN KAY DOUR KA PAKISTAN\n\nAuthor: NAJAM SETHI\n\nBadass Habits is a eureka-sparking, easy-to-digest look at how our habits make us who we are, from the measly moments that happen in private to the resolutions we loudly broadcast (and, erm, often don’t keep) on social media. Habit busting and building goes way beyond becoming a dedicated flosser or never showing up late again–our habits reveal our unmet desires, the gaps in our boundaries, our level of self-awareness, and our unconscious beliefs and fears. Badass Habits features Jen’s trademark hilarious voice and offers a much-needed fresh take on the conventional wisdom and science that shape the optimism (or pessimism?) around the age-old topic of habits. The book includes enlightening interviews with people who’ve successfully strengthened their discipline backbones, new perspective on how to train our brains to become our best selves, and offers a simple, 21 day, step-by-step guide for ditching habits that don’t serve us and developing the habits we deem most important. Habits shouldn’t be impossible to reset–and with healthy boundaries, knowledge of–and permission to go after–our desires, and an easy to implement plan of action, we can make any new goal a joyful habit.\n\nISBN: 9781984877437\n\nPublisher: PENGUIN BOOKS\n\nSubtitle: CULTIVATE THE AWARENESS, BOUNDARIES, AND DAILY UPGRADES YOU NEED TO MAKE THEM STICK\n\nAuthor: JEN SINCERO\n\nStop having hard conversations with people who don?t want to change.\n\nStop showing up for people who are indifferent about your presence. Stop prioritizing people who make you an option. Stop loving people who aren?t ready to love you. The reality is that you exist in so many different forms and images and beliefs and stories?and yet, the only one that is ever really going to matter is the one you tell yourself. Healing is not a one-time event. It can begin with a one-time event ? typically some form of sudden loss that disrupts our projection of what the future might be. However, the true work of healing is allowing that disruption to wake us from a deep state of unconsciousness, to release the personas we adapted into, and begin consciously piecing together the full truth of who we were meant to be. In her follow-up collection to the international bestseller 101 Essays That Will Change The Way You Think, Brianna Wiest shares 45+ new pieces that will help you find your inner sanctum and embark on the path of true transformation. Wiest?s words are a balm for any soul on the journey of their own becoming.\n\nISBN: 9781949759440\n\nPublisher: THOUGHT CATALOG BOOKS\n\nSubtitle:\n\nAuthor: BRIANNA WIEST\n\nWe spend a shocking 43 percent of our day doing things without thinking about them. That means that almost half of our actions aren?t conscious choices but the result of our non-conscious mind nudging our body to act along learned behaviors. How we respond to the people around us; the way we conduct ourselves in a meeting; what we buy; when and how we exercise, eat, and drink?a truly remarkable number of things we do every day, regardless of their complexity, operate outside of our awareness. We do them automatically. We do them by habit. And yet, whenever we want to change something about ourselves, we rely on willpower. We keep turning to our conscious selves, hoping that our determination and intention will be enough to effect positive change. And that is why almost all of us fail. But what if you could harness the extraordinary power of your unconscious mind, which already determines so much of what you do, to truly reach your goals?\n\nISBN: 9781509864744\n\nPublisher: MACMILLAN\n\nSubtitle: THE SCIENCE OF MAKING POSITIVE CHANGES THAT STICK\n\nAuthor: WENDY WOOD\n\nDeep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task.

Deep Work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep-spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there’s a better way.\n\nISBN: 9781455586691\n\nPublisher: GRAND CENTRAL PUBLISHING\n\nSubtitle: RULES FOR FOCUSED SUCCESS IN A DISTRACTED WORLD\n\nAuthor: CAL NEWPORT\n\nAchieve “Massive Action” results and accomplish your business dreams!\n\nWhile most people operate with only three degrees of action-no action, retreat, or normal action-if you’re after big goals, you don’t want to settle for the ordinary. To reach the next level, you must understand the coveted 4th degree of action. This 4th degree, also known as the 10 X Rule, is that level of action that guarantees companies and individuals realize their goals and dreams.\n\nThe 10 X Rule unveils the principle of “Massive Action,” allowing you to blast through business clich?s and risk-aversion while taking concrete steps to reach your dreams. It also demonstrates why people get stuck in the first three actions and how to move into making the 10X Rule a discipline. Find out exactly where to start, what to do, and how to follow up each action you take with more action to achieve Massive Action results.\n\nISBN: 9780470627600\n\nPublisher: JOHN WILEY\n\nSubtitle: THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUCCESS AND FAILURE\n\nAuthor: GRANT CARDONE\n\nThe definitive guide that teaches you how to use the Japanese concept of wabi sabi to reshape every area of your life and find happiness right where you are.\n\nFed up with the exhausting challenges of our fast-paced, consumption-driven existence, millions of people around the world are turning to timeless cultural traditions to find true meaning. In this transformative handbook, Beth Kempton introduces you to wabi sabi (?wah-bi sah-bi?), a captivating concept from Japanese aesthetics that offers a whole new way of looking at the world.\n\nWith roots in Zen and the Way of Tea, wabi sabi teaches you to see beauty in imperfection, appreciate simplicity, and accept the transient nature of all things. It inspires you to simplify everything and concentrate on what truly matters. Filled with simple yet profound wisdom, Wabi Sabi will help you slow down, reconnect with nature, and be gentler on yourself.\n\nFrom honoring the rhythm of the seasons to creating a welcoming home, from reframing failure to aging with grace, Wabi Sabi teaches you find more joy and inspiration throughout your perfectly imperfect life.\n\nISBN: 9780349421001\n\nPublisher: PIATKUS\n\nSubtitle: JAPANESE WISDOM FOR A PERFECTLY IMPERFECT LIFE\n\nAuthor: BETH KEMPTON\n\nMost of us know that addiction to digital tools is costing us both productivity and peace. But giving them up completely isn’t realistic.\n\nWe’re addicted to texting, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter not because we’re stupid or shallow, but because they provide real value in the form of connection, community, affirmation, and information. Instagram is how you see new photos of your school friend’s baby. Texting is how you let your mum know you’re safe in a storm. Twitter is how you hear about breaking news in your industry. But these tools can also disrupt our ability to focus on meaningful work and live fully in the present. Must we choose between one or the other?\n\nNewport’s answer is no.

Laing’s The Divided Self illuminated the nature mental illness, making the mysteries of the mind comprehensible to a lay audience. This Penguin Modern Classics edition includes an introduction by Professor Anthony S. David. First published in 1960, this watershed work aimed to make madness comprehensible, and in doing so revolutionized the way we perceive mental illness. Using case studies of patients he had worked with, psychiatrist R. D. Laing argued that psychosis is not a medical condition, but an outcome of the ‘divided self’, or the tension between the two personas within us: one our authentic, private identity, and the other the false, ‘sane’ self that we present to the world. Laing’s radical approach to insanity offered a rich existential analysis of personal alienation and made him a cult figure in the 1960s, yet his work was most significant for its humane attitude, which put the patient back at the centre of treatment. R.D. Laing (1927-1989), one of the best-known psychiatrists of modern times, was born in Glasgow, Scotland. R.D. Laing’s writings range from books on social theory to verse, as well as numerous articles and reviews in scientific journals and the popular press. His many publications include The Divided Self, Self and Others, Interpersonal Perception, The Politics of Experience and The Bird of Paradise, and Madness and Folly.
