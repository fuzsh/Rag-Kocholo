Aqua Net, Lycra, lace and liquor flow freely at one of the Sunset Strip’s last legendary venues, a place where sex machine Stacee Jaxx takes the stage and scantily clad groupies line up to turn their fantasies into reality. Amidst the madness, aspiring rock star (and resident toilet cleaner) Drew longs to take the stage as the next big thing (and longs for small-town girl Sherri, fresh off the bus from Kansas with stars in her eyes). But the rock ’n’ roll fairy tale is about to end when German developers sweep into town with plans to turn the fabled Strip into just another capitalist strip mall. Can Drew, Sherri and the gang save the strip – and themselves – before it’s too late? Only the music of hit bands Styx, Journey, Bon Jovi, Whitesnake and more hold the answer.\n\nRock of Ages is also ready to rock for YOUTH and TEENS!\n\nAct I\n\n1. “Cum On Feel the Noize / Just Like Paradise / Nothin’ But A Good Time” – Company\n\n2. “Sister Christian” – Father, Mother, Sherrie, Drew, Franz, Ensemble\n\n2a.
