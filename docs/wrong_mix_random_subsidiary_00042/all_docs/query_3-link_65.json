Forster (which wasn’t published until 1971).\n \nThe film, from gay writer/director James Ivory, is set in Edwardian England (early 1900s) and follows Maurice (Wilby) as he begins to explore his homosexuality with Clive (Grant), a friend at university. The two fall in love, but their romance is unfortunately short-lived because of the repressive world they live in. Despite the heartache, it’s not long before Maurice finds love again – with Alec Scudder, the gamekeeper working for Clive.\n \n“Publishable. But worth it?” were the words written by Forster on the original unpublished 1914 manuscript. Homosexuality wasn’t decriminalized in England until 1967, so it’s not surprising that Forster was apprehensive about publishing “Maurice” and requested for the novel to be released posthumously.\n \nRare for the time, “Maurice” is a queer love story that has a happy ending; Forster wrote the following in 1960:\n \n“A happy ending was imperative. I shouldn’t have bothered to write otherwise. I was determined that in fiction anyway two men should fall in love and remain in it for the ever and ever that fiction allows, and in this sense Maurice and Alec still roam the greenwood. I dedicated it ‘To a Happier Year’ and not altogether vainly. Happiness is its keynote.”\n \nMAURICE\n1987. UK.\n \nDirector: James Ivory\nScreenplay: James Ivory & Kit Hesketh-Harvey\nBased on: Maurice (1914) by E. M. Forster\n \nStarring: James Wilby, Hugh Grant, Rupert Graves, Mark Tandy, Ben Kingsley, Denholm Elliott, Simon Callow, Billie Whitelaw, Barry Foster, Judy Parfitt & Phoebe Nicholls\n \nMAURICE is streaming on Mubi and Tubi (Canada/USA) – Kanopy and Cohen Media Channel (USA) – Channel 4 (UK) – and available for rent/purchase (USA) through AppleTV, Amazon and YouTube.\".",
