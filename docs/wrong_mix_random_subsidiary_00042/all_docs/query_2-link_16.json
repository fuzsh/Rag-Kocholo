Everything is nicely captured and the cast was top notch! Such a great time at the theater and a very talented cast! A\n\nDamn Yankees | Television Production | 8 April 1967 | Proshot | VOB + smalls\n\nCast: Phil Silvers (Mr. Applegate), Lee Remick (Lola), Jerry Lanning (Joe Hardy), Linda Lavin (Gloria Thorpe), Jim Backus (Van Buren), Ray Middleton (Joe Boyd), Fran Allison (Meg Boyd)\n\n* Some generational lost, but really very good for 1967.\n\nDamn Yankees | Music Theatre of Wichita | 1994 | Proshot | VOB + smalls\n\nCast: Michael Jaye (Mr. Applegate), Laura Soltis (Lola), John Scherer (Joe Hardy), Joseph Gallo III (Joe Boyd), Jane Collinsworth (Meg Boyd), Matt Bogart (Ensemble)\n\n​\n\nDamn Yankees | Broadway Revival | 9 March 1994 | VOB + smalls\n\nCast: Victor Garber (Mr. Applegate), Bebe Neuwirth (Lola), Dick Latessa (Van Buren)\n\n* Some generational loss, but a great bootleg version of show! Also features various TV clips.\n\nDamn Yankees | Third US National Tour | April 1996 | VOB + smalls\n\nCast: Jerry Lewis (Mr. Applegate), Valerie Wright (Lola), David Elder (Joe Hardy), Linda Gabler (Gloria Thorpe), Susan Bigelow (Meg Boyd)\n\n* Good picture and sound but some generation loss.

Jane, as always, was to die for. Sean was such a joy to watch on stage. And Randy, WOW her subtilty and charm was astonishing. This capture is just stunning and one of the best from City Centers with no obstructions. A+\n\n​\n\nDamn Yankees | Plays in the Park, NJ | July 2012 | Proshot | VOB + smalls\n\nCast: Steven Bunin, Amanda Lefkowitz, Matt Burns, Gabrielle Viser, Mark Megill, David DeSio, Mandy Feller\n\n* Multicam proshot. A\n\nDamn Yankees | 3D Theatricals | 26 July 2014 | SJ Bernly | VOB + smalls\n\nCast: Jordan Lamoureaux (Mr. Applegate), Alexis Carra (Lola), Cameron Bond (Joe Hardy), Chelsea Emma Franko (Gloria Thorpe), Joe Hart (Van Buren), Robert Hoyt (Joe Boyd), Cynthia Ferrer (Meg Boyd)\n\n* Nicely filmed with a good mix of close-ups and full stage shots. A few short blackouts during the first 5 minutes but nothing too bad.\n\nDance a Little Closer | Broadway | 1983 | VOB + smalls\n\nCast: Len Cariou (Harry Aikens), Liz Robertson (Cynthia Brookfield-Bailey), George Rose (Dr. Josef Winkler), Brent Barrett (Charles Castleton), Alyson Reed (Elaine)\n\n* Broadway flop with just one Broadway performance.

Crystal clear, stunning and from the digital master. 3 DVDs, includes stagedoor footage. A single disc copy of this is circulated as January 24, but it is just a lower resolution copy of this performance.\n\nDancin' | First Broadway Revival | 4 May 2023 | bikinibottomday | MP4 (4K) 8.78gb\n\nCast: Ioana Alfonso, Yeman Brown, Peter John Chursin, Dylis Croman, Tony D’Alelio, Jovan Dansberry, Karli DiNardo, Jacob Guzman, Manuel Herrera, Kolton Krouse, Mattie Love, Yani Marin, Nando Morland, Khori Michelle Petinaud, Ida Saki, Ron Todorowski\n\n* Excellent 4K capture from the final weeks of this show! In order to show the choreography as much as possible, this video is wideshot more than usual. This audience was VERY enthusiastic and makes the performance a fun watch. Minimal wandering and unfocusing, a few very brief blackouts. Some action on the far right and some of the projections are cut off due to the angle. Includes curtain call, audio is fed from external source.\n\nDave | Arena Stage, Washington D.C. | 18 August 2018 | NYCG8R | VOB + smalls\n\nCast: Drew Gehling (Dave Kovic/Bill Mitchell), Mamie Parris (Ellen Mitchell), Josh Breckenridge (Duane Bolden), Douglas Sills (Bob Alexander), Bryonha Marie Parham (Susan Lee), Jonathan Rayson (Gary Nance), Rachel Flynn (Randi Hagopian), Kevin R Free (Murray), Jenny Ashman, Jared Bradshaw, Dana Cosetello, Trista Dollison, Sherri L. Edelen, Adam J. Levy, Bryonha Marie Parham, Erin Quill, Jamison Scott, Vishal Vaidya\n\n* Penultimate performance of the production! The last 8 minutes or so of Act 1 are audio only. Photos have been put in over the sound.\n\nDays of Wine and Roses | Off-Broadway | 12 May 2023 (Preview) | bikinibottomday | MP4 (4K) 7.94gb\n\nCast: Brian d'Arcy James (Joe Clay), Kelli O'Hara (Kirsten Arnesen), Ella Dane Morgan (Lila), Byron Jennings (Arnesen), David Jennings (Jim Hungerford), Sharon Catherine Brown (Mrs. Nolan / Saleswoman), Bill English (Salesman), Olivia Hernandez (Betty), Ted Koch (Rad)\n\n* Great 4K capture of this stunning new adaptation! Some minor head obstruction on the sides that only block off action when characters sit or lay down. Some action on the extreme sides are not captured due to proximity to the stage. Some wandering and unfocusing throughout. About 15 minutes in there's a sequence of short blackouts lasting a total of one minute. Includes curtain call, audio is fed from external source.\n\nDays of Wine and Roses | Off-Broadway | 24 June 2023 | bikinibottomday | MP4 (4K) 8.31gb\n\nCast: Brian d'Arcy James (Joe Clay), Elena Shaddow (s/b Kirsten Arnesen), Ella Dane Morgan (Lila), Byron Jennings (Arnesen), David Jennings (Jim Hungerford), Sharon Catherine Brown (Mrs. Nolan / Saleswoman), Bill English (Salesman), Olivia Hernandez (Betty), Ted Koch (Rad)\n\n* Great 4K capture of Elena Shaddow's very limited stint as Kirsten! Some minor head obstruction on the sides that only block off action when characters sit or lay down. Some action on the extreme right is questionably captured due to proximity to the stage. Some wandering and unfocusing throughout (especially during the ending scene). Includes curtain call, audio is fed from external source.\n\nDays of Wine and Roses | Broadway | 7 January 2024 (Preview) | The Musical Speakeasy | MOV (HD) 8.34gb or MOV (4K) 15.92gb\n\nCast: Kelli O'Hara (Kirsten Arnesen), Brian d'Arcy James (Joe Clay), Tabitha Lawing (Lila), Byron Jennings (Arnesen), David Jennings (Jim Hungerford), Sharon Catherine Brown (Mrs. Nolan/Saleswoman), Olivia Henandez (Betty), Bill English (Mr. Shaw), Tony Carlin (Rad), David Manis (Delaney)\n\n* Camcorder video captured in 4K. No obstructions, no washout unless to illuminate something else on stage. Besides occasional adjustments (and a brief late call at the beginning of the second scene), no dropouts or flaws. Good audio. Shot from extreme house left balcony. One of the most alluring and gnawing presentations of the season. An aggressive, gritty, rich, mature, on-your-toes piece of art with a top shelf score by Guettel, a nasty vicious book by Lucas, career highlight performances from Kelli and Brian, and a wonderfully directed production from Greif (though, frankly, a bit vacuous on a Broadway stage). I found it to be in remarkable shape for a second preview, save some occasional lighting delays and some static buzz from one of the speakers in a couple points. Curious to see what about this show might shift in previews, and where it will go in the future. A/A+\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | November 2016 (Preview) | SunsetBlvd79 | VOB + smalls\n\nCast: Ben Platt (Evan Hansen), Rachel Bay Jones (Heidi Hansen), Laura Dreyfuss (Zoe Murphy), Jennifer Laura Thompson (Cynthia Murphy), Michael Park (Larry Murphy), Will Roland (Jared Kleinman), Kristolyn Lloyd (Alana Beck), Mike Faist (Connor Murphy)\n\n* Excellent HD capture of the Broadway transfer. In the long journey to Broadway, the show still lives up to all its hype and greatness. The cast gives amazing performances and leaves it all on the stage. A\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | December 2016 (Highlights) | SJ Bernly | VOB + smalls\n\nCast: Ben Platt (Evan Hansen), Rachel Bay Jones (Heidi Hansen), Laura Dreyfuss (Zoe Murphy), Jennifer Laura Thompson (Cynthia Murphy), Michael Park (Larry Murphy), Will Roland (Jared Kleinman), Kristolyn Lloyd (Alana Beck), Mike Faist (Connor Murphy)\n\n* Act One only! A nice capture with no washout and just one quick dropout during the scene after Waving Through a Window. There is one head that blocks part of the front of the stage, but it’s worked around generally doesn’t do more than block the actors’ legs. It’s filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | 24 June 2017 | SunsetBlvd79 | VOB + smalls\n\nCast: Ben Platt (Evan Hansen), Rachel Bay Jones (Heidi Hansen), Laura Dreyfuss (Zoe Murphy), Jennifer Laura Thompson (Cynthia Murphy), Michael Park (Larry Murphy), Will Roland (Jared Kleinman), Olivia Puckett (u/s Alana Beck), Mike Faist (Connor Murphy)\n\n* Excellent HD capture with no obstructions. This was shortly after Ben Platt's 2017 Tony win for Best Actor and Best Musical Award. The cast and show are still in wonderful shape, energy and speaks for itself. A-\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | 11 August 2017 | SunsetBlvd79 | VOB + smalls\n\nCast: Michael Lee Brown (u/s Evan Hansen), Garrett Long (u/s Heidi Hansen), Olivia Puckett (u/s Zoe Murphy), Jennifer Laura Thompson (Cynthia Murphy), Michael Park (Larry Murphy), Will Roland (Jared Kleinman), Kristolyn Lloyd (Alana Beck), Mike Faist (Connor Murphy)\n\n* Excellent HD capture of Understudies going on for the three lead roles. Michael does a terrific job filling Evan's shoes, bringing his own interpretation and power.

Small obstruction on bottom right of the screen for some of the show, and camera can be jumpy at times. That aside, the picture quality is beautiful, and pretty much all of the important actions are caught. The master obviously knew the show well.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | First National Tour | 18 October 2018 M (Preview) (Highlights) | thehouseonsunset | VOB + smalls\n\nCast: Stephen Christopher Anthony (alt Evan Hansen), Jessica Phillips (Heidi Hansen), Maggie McKenna (Zoe Murphy), Christiane Noll (Cynthia Murphy), Aaron Lazar (Larry Murphy), Jared Goldsmith (Jared Kleinman), Phoebe Koyabe (Alana Beck), Marrick Smith (Connor Murphy)\n\n* Most of Act one. There were a lot of difficulties during the show. Master had to leave unfortunately so they couldn't get the entire show.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | National Tour | 17 November 2018 (Highlights) |MOV (HD)\n\nCast: Stephen Christopher Anthony (alt Evan Hansen), Jessica Phillips (Heidi Hansen), Maggie McKenna (Zoe Murphy), Christiane Noll (Cynthia Murphy), Aaron Lazar (Larry Murphy), Marrick Smith (Connor Murphy), Jared Goldsmith (Jared Kleinman), Phoebe Koyabe (Alana Beck)\n\n* Highlights include: You Will Be Found, Sincerely Me, Requiem, Anybody Have A Map?, Good For You, Words Fail.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | 29 December 2018 (Highlights) | bluebird | MP4 (4K) 30.55gb | LIMITED TRADES 2:1\n\nCast: Taylor Trensch (Evan Hansen), Nicole Van Giesen (u/s Heidi Hansen), Gabrielle Carrubba (u/s Zoe Murphy), Jennifer Laura Thompson (Cynthia Murphy), Michael Park (Larry Murphy), Sky Lakota-Lynch (Jared Kleinman), Phoenix Best (Alana Beck), Alex Boniello (Connor Murphy)\n\n* Act One only! Gabrielle is a wonderful Zoe and really gives the role her all. Filmed from the center mezzanine, with obstructions in the bottom of the screen, filmed between heads. Lots of washout, especially in the brighter scenes, but definitely watchable.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | First National Tour | 30 December 2018 (Closing Night) (Highlights) | MOV (HD)\n\nCast: Ben Levi Ross (Evan Hansen), Jessica Phillips (Heidi Hansen), Maggie McKenna (Zoe Murphy), Christiane Noll (Cynthia Murphy), Aaron Lazar (Larry Murphy), Jared Goldsmith (Jared Kleinman), Phoebe Koyabe (Alana Beck), Marrick Smith (Connor Murphy)\n\n* Highlights running around 30 mins, includes: Waving Through A Window, For Forever.

A really remarkable performance from Michael Lee Brown. One of my favorites to date.\n\n​\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | February 2019 (2) | NYCG8R | VOB + smalls\n\nCast: Andrew Barth Feldman (Evan Hansen), Lisa Brescia (Heidi Hansen), Mallory Bechtel (Zoe Murphy), Jennifer Laura Thompson (Cynthia Murphy), Michael Park (Larry Murphy), Sky Lakota-Lynch (Jared Kleinman), Phoenix Best (Alana Beck), Alex Boniello (Connor Murphy)\n\n* Due to a sick audience member, the last 2 minutes of Act One are from a performance a few weeks prior with Michael Lee Brown. This is the fixed version. This is also the last known video capture of Michael Park and Jennifer Laura Thompson in the role of Larry and Cynthia Murphy before they depart on Aug 4. The version with Feb 2018 in the menu should not be shared.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | April 2019 (Highlights) | MP4 (HD) 39.1mb | Gifted upon request\n\nCast: Andrew Barth Feldman (Evan Hansen), Nicole Van Giesen (u/s Heidi Hansen), Alex Boniello (Connor Murphy), Mallory Bechtel (Zoe Murphy), Jennifer Laura Thompson (Cynthia Murphy), Michael Park (Larry Murphy), Sky Lakota-Lynch (Jared Kleinman), Phoenix Best (Alana Beck)\n\n* Highlights including Waving Through A Window, filmed vertically, ripped in the highest quality.\n\n​\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | June 2019 | StarCuffedJeans | MP4 (HD)\n\nCast: Roman Banks (u/s Evan Hansen), Lisa Brescia (Heidi Hansen), Gabrielle Carrubba (u/s Zoe Murphy), Jennifer Laura Thompson (Cynthia Murphy), Asa Somers (s/b Larry Murphy), Sky Lakota-Lynch (Jared Kleinman), Samantha Williams (Alana Beck), Alex Boniello (Connor Murphy)\n\n* Beautiful HD capture of Roman in the titular role, with Gabrielle and Asa as Zoe and Larry respectively! Filmed from the left orchestra, this is a very Roman-centric capture, filmed with a mix of wides, mediums, and many closeups.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Toronto | 23 June 2019 (Highlights) | BroadwayForForever | MP4 (HD)\n\nCast: Robert Markus (Evan Hansen), Jessica Sherman (Heidi Hansen), Stephanie La Rochelle (Zoe Murphy), Claire Rankin (Cynthia Murphy), Evan Buliung (Larry Murphy), Alessandro Costantini (Jared Kleinman), Kaitlyn Santa Juana (u/s Alana Beck), Sean Patrick Dolan (Connor Murphy)\n\n* Filming this was a very last minute decision, so it's not that great quality. The picture is washed out and the camera often drifts from the action. There are a few decent shots but it's far from good. I had to leave after If I Could Tell Her to get to the Pride Parade. I have a huge place in my heart for this cast, Steph has been one of my favourite signers since Over The Rainbow so I just adored seeing her as Zoe. Robert flubs a line in For Forever, and says \"cuz the sun burns bright\" twice.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | First National Tour | July 2019 | theatrefan64 | MOV (HD) 12.71gb\n\nCast: Stephen Christopher Anthony (Evan), Maggie McKenna (Zoe), Jessica Phillips (Heidi), Christiane Noll (Cynthia), Marrick Smith (Connor), Aaron Lazar (Larry), Jared Goldsmith (Jared), Phoebe Koyabe (Alana)\n\n* Shot from about 5th row center orchestra. Suffers from some spotlight washout.\n\n​\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | September 2019 (1) | StarCuffedJeans | MP4 (HD)\n\nCast: Roman Banks (u/s Evan Hansen), Lisa Brescia (Heidi Hansen), Gabrielle Carrubba (Zoe Murphy), Ann Sanders (t/r Cynthia Murphy), Ivan Hernandez (Larry Murphy), Sky Lakota-Lynch (Jared Kleinman), Samantha Williams (Alana Beck), Alex Boniello (Connor Murphy)\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | September 2019 (2) | StarCuffedJeans | MP4 (HD)\n\nCast: Michael Lee Brown (alt Evan Hansen), Lisa Brescia (Heidi Hansen), Gabrielle Carrubba (Zoe Murphy), Ann Sanders (t/r Cynthia Murphy), Ivan Hernandez (Larry Murphy), Sky Lakota-Lynch (Jared Kleinman), Samantha Williams (Alana Beck), Roman Banks (u/s Connor Murphy)\n\n* If this is your first time watching Dear Evan Hansen, or if you are just a casual fan this video may not make sense. The seat location for filming is not great and the video starts during “Waving Through a Window.” This video is very much focused on Michael Lee Brown/Roman Banks/Ann Sanders. While other people are speaking and singing you will get close ups of their acting choices.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | First National Tour | 26 October 2019 M | myroadofgoodintentions | MP4 (HD)\n\nCast: Sam Primack (alt Evan Hansen), Jessica Sherman (Heidi Hansen), Stephanie La Rochelle (Zoe Murphy), Claire Rankin (Cynthia Murphy), John Hemphill (Larry Murphy), Alessandro Costantini (Jared Kleinman), Ciara Alyse Harris (Alana Beck), Noah Kieserman (Connor Murphy)\n\n* High quality boot shot with an HD camera. Some shakiness and jumping around and quick zooms in and out to find the action as master was less familiar with this show. Really great captures of faces and mix of wide shots and zooms.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | West End | November 2019 (Preview) | queenofthedead | M2TS (HD)\n\nCast: Marcus Harman (alt Evan Hansen), Rebecca McKinnis (Heidi Hansen), Lucy Anderson (Zoe Murphy), Lauren Ward (Cynthia Murphy), Rupert Young (Larry Murphy), Jack Loxton (Jared Kleinman), Nicole Raquel Dennis (Alana Beck), Doug Colling (Connor Murphy)\n\n* Missing 15 mins of dialogue in act 1. Shot from very high up which gave my camera a hard time focusing on faces in bright scenes which is shown. Action on the far left side of the stage (to us) gets missed. The bar sometimes obstructs but not massively. Would recommend it for checking out the cast more than for if you want to see the projections. Marcus’ 4th show as Evan.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | December 2019 | theatrefan64 | MOV (HD) 19.23gb\n\nCast: Zachary Noah Piser (Evan), Gabrielle Carrubba (Zoe), Jessica Phillips (Heidi), Christiane Noll (Cynthia), Alex Boniello (Connor), Ivan Hernandez (Larry), Jared Goldsmith (Jared), Phoebe Koyabe (Alana)\n\n* Shot from about 5th row center orchestra. Suffers from spotlight washout.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | First National Tour | 8 December 2019 (Closing Night) | mynewfavoriteday | VOB + smalls\n\nCast: Matthew Edward Kemp (u/s Evan Hansen), Jessica Sherman (Heidi Hansen), Stephanie La Rochelle (Zoe Murphy), Claire Rankin (Cynthia Murphy), John Hemphill (Larry Murphy), Alessandro Costantini (Jared Kleinman), Samantha Williams (Alana Beck), Noah Kieserman (Connor Murphy)\n\n* Matthew Edward Kemp’s debut as Evan! Excellent HD capture of the second year cast of the National Tour and first known video of Samantha on tour. A perfect capture of the final performance in Dallas with minimal washout, obstructions, and no noticeable dropouts. There are only a few instances where the camera doesn't focus completely but the show is filmed just as a well as any fan would want it to be. Jessica cuts off one of Matthew's lines and Claire almost misses an entrance, but overall it was just a perfect performance with a perfect audience. It’s filmed in 16:9 from the far right mezzanine, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent. Includes curtain call.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | January 2020 | StarCuffedJeans | MP4 (HD)\n\nCast: Jordan Fisher (Evan Hansen), Jessica Phillips (Heidi Hansen), Gabrielle Carrubba (Zoe Murphy), Christiane Noll (Cynthia Murphy), Ivan Hernandez (Larry Murphy), Jared Goldsmith (Jared Kleinman), Phoebe Koyabe (Alana Beck), Dan Macke (t/r Connor Murphy)\n\n* Starts just after Anybody Have a Map.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | December 2021 (1) | StarCuffedJeans | MP4 (HD) 6.90gb\n\nCast: Jordan Fisher (Evan Hansen), Jessica Phillips (Heidi Hansen), Gabrielle Carrubba (Zoe Murphy), Christiane Noll (Cynthia Murphy), Ivan Hernandez (Larry Murphy), David Jeffery (Connor Murphy), Jared Goldsmith (Jared Kleinman), Phoebe Koyabe (Alana Beck)\n\n* Reopening night!\n\n​\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | December 2021 (2) | StarCuffedJeans | MP4 (HD) 6.79gb\n\nCast: Zachary Noah Piser (alt Evan Hansen), Jessica Phillips (Heidi Hansen), Gabrielle Carrubba (Zoe Murphy), Christiane Noll (Cynthia Murphy), Ivan Hernandez (Larry Murphy), David Jeffery (Connor Murphy), Jared Goldsmith (Jared Kleinman), Phoebe Koyabe (Alana Beck)\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | December 2021 (Highlights) | royalflushtrades | MOV (HD) 2.60gb\n\nCast: Zachary Noah Piser (alt Evan Hansen), Jessica Phillips (Heidi Hansen), Gabrielle Carruba (Zoe Murphy), Christiane Noll (Cynthia Murphy), Ivan Hernandez (Larry Murphy), David Jeffery (Connor Murphy), Jared Goldsmith (Jared Kleinman), Talia Simone Robinson (u/s Alana Beck)\n\n* Recorded on IPhone 7, shot from first row in the mezzanine. First known video of Talia in the role of Alana, first known video of David in the role of Connor and second known video of Zachary in the role of Evan. Minor obstructions but noticeable wash out through all clips recorded mainly audio were: anybody have a map, waving through a window, jared-evan dialogue before for forever, evan-zoe talk before if i could tell her, evan dialogue pre you will be found, evans part in you will be found, dialogue before words fail. video (or video you could see something rather) were for forever, sincerely me, requiem, to break in a glove, only us, pre good for you dialogue and heidi section of good for you, words fail, so big, so small.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | West End | December 2021 | Lasagna | MP4 (HD) 3.3gb\n\nCast: Marcus Harman (alt Evan Hansen), Tricia Adele-Turner (u/s Heidi Hansen), Lucy Anderson (Zoe Murphy), Lauren Ward (Cynthia Murphy), Rupert Young (Larry Murphy), Doug Colling (Connor Murphy), Jack Loxton (Jared Kleinman), Iona Fraser (Alana Beck)\n\n* First known video of Tricia as Heidi! My first time navigating heavy obstruction so I struggled a lot, not helped by significant washout issues and occasional wandering. The start is rough and I had to drop out a few times throughout but it definitely does improve. Moments where they don't move around a lot tend to be captured well at least, with some really nice closeups in places. Ends literally 10 seconds before the end of the show due to my battery dying.\n\n​\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | February 2022 | StarCuffedJeans | MP4 (HD) 6.52gb\n\nCast: Zachary Noah Piser (alt Evan Hansen), Nicole Van Giesen (u/s Heidi Hansen), Linedy Genao (u/s Zoe Murphy), Christiane Noll (Cynthia Murphy), Asa Somers (s/b Larry Murphy), David Jeffery (Connor Murphy), Jared Goldsmith (Jared Kleinman), Talia Simone Robinson (u/s Alana Beck)\n\n* Over-priced home decor.\n\n​\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | March 2022 | StarCuffedJeans | MP4 (HD) 6.74gb\n\nCast: Mateo Lizcano (u/s Evan Hansen), Jessica Phillips (Heidi Hansen), Linedy Genao (u/s Zoe Murphy), Christiane Noll (Cynthia Murphy), Ivan Hernandez (Larry Murphy), David Jeffery (Connor Murphy), Jared Goldsmith (Jared Kleinman), Phoebe Koyabe (Alana Beck)\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | March 2022 (3) M | StarCuffedJeans | MP4 (HD) 6.72gb\n\nCast: Reese Sebastian Diaz (u/s Evan Hansen), Jessica Phillips (Heidi Hansen), Gabrielle Carrubba (Zoe Murphy), Christiane Noll (Cynthia Murphy), Ivan Hernandez (Larry Murphy), David Jeffery (Connor Murphy), Jared Goldsmith (Jared Kleinman), Talia Simone Robinson (u/s Alana Beck)\n\n* Revive Evan Hansen chaos month.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | March 2022 (4) | StarCuffedJeans | MP4 (HD) 6.64gb\n\nCast: Josh Strobl (u/s Evan Hansen), Jessica Phillips (Heidi Hansen), Gabrielle Carrubba (Zoe Murphy), Christiane Noll (Cynthia Murphy), Ivan Hernandez (Larry Murphy), David Jeffery (Connor Murphy), Jared Goldsmith (Jared Kleinman), Linedy Genao (u/s Alana Beck)\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | March 2022 (5) | StarCuffedJeans | MP4 (HD) 6.65gb\n\nCast: Ben Levi Ross (Evan Hansen), Jessica Phillips (Heidi Hansen), Gabrielle Carrubba (Zoe Murphy), Christiane Noll (Cynthia Murphy), Ivan Hernandez (Larry Murphy), David Jeffery (Connor Murphy), Jared Goldsmith (Jared Kleinman), Phoebe Koyabe (Alana Beck)\n\n​\n\nDear Evan Hansen | First National Tour | March 2022 (1) | StarCuffedJeans | MP4 (HD) 6.75gb\n\nCast: Stephen Christopher Anthony (Evan Hansen), Coleen Sexton (u/s Heidi Hansen), Stephanie La Rochelle (Zoe Murphy), Claire Rankin (Cynthia Murphy), John Hemphill (Larry Murphy), Nikhil Saboo (Connor Murphy), Alessandro Costantini (Jared Kleinman), Ciara Alyse Harris (Alana Beck)\n\n* This is sad.\n\n​\n\nDear Evan Hansen | First National Tour | March 2022 (2) | StarCuffedJeans | MP4 (HD) 6.7gb\n\nCast: Sam Primack (alt Evan Hansen), Coleen Sexton (u/s Heidi Hansen), Stephanie La Rochelle (Zoe Murphy), Claire Rankin (Cynthia Murphy), John Hemphill (Larry Murphy), Nikhil Saboo (Connor Murphy), Alessandro Costantini (Jared Kleinman), Ciara Alyse Harris (Alana Beck)\n\n* Nikhil pretends to be batman?\n\n​\n\nDear Evan Hansen | West End | April 2022 (1) | Lasagna | MP4 (4K) 9.78gb\n\nCast: Sam Tutty (Evan Hansen), Rebecca McKinnis (Heidi Hansen), Lucy Anderson (Zoe Murphy), Lauren Ward (Cynthia Murphy), Rupert Young (Larry Murphy), Doug Colling (Connor Murphy), Jack Loxton (Jared Kleinman), Iona Fraser (Alana Beck)\n\n* Incredible 4K capture of the full West End cast of this show! This show's lights are bright and so I opt for close-ups wherever I can in order to avoid washout. Clearly my camera hiding technique needs some work because several of the cast clearly notice me and play to the camera, including Sam and Rebecca. Strong performances from the whole cast.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | West End | April 2022 (2) | Lasagna | MP4 (4K) 9.84gb\n\nCast: Sam Tutty (Evan Hansen), Rebecca McKinnis (Heidi Hansen), Lucy Anderson (Zoe Murphy), Lauren Ward (Cynthia Murphy), Rupert Young (Larry Murphy), Doug Colling (Connor Murphy), Haydn Cox (u/s Jared Kleinman), Iona Fraser (Alana Beck)\n\n* Fantastic capture of Haydn as Jared! A little Haydn-centric but captures the whole show well.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | 12 April 2022 | 17fortrade | MTS\n\nCast: Ben Levi Ross (Evan Hansen), Nicole Van Giesen (u/s Heidi Hansen), Linedy Genao (u/s Zoe Murphy), Christiane Noll (Cynthia Murphy), Ivan Hernandez (Larry Murphy), David Jeffery (Connor Murphy), Jared Goldsmith (Jared Kleinman), Phoebe Koyabe (Alana Beck)\n\n* BLR was such an awesome Evan that I decided to record his performance. I recorded the whole show from Mezz without the curtain call. It's my first time trying to record a show and it's harder than I thought, sometimes it could be a little bit shaky due to my sore arm. The lady in front sometimes obscured the view a bit.\n\n​\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | 30 April 2022 (Highlights) | MP4 (SD)\n\nCast: Ben Levi Ross (Evan Hansen), Jessica Phillips (Heidi Hansen), Gabrielle Carrubba (Zoe Murphy), Christiane Noll (Cynthia Murphy), Manoel Felciano (Larry Murphy), David Jeffery (Connor Murphy), Jared Goldsmith (Jared Kleinman), Phoebe Koyabe (Alana Beck)\n\n* Video ripped from bilibili, highlights of Manoel's second performance as Larry. Highlights include Sincerely, Me until the end of If I Could Tell Her.\n\n​\n\nDear Evan Hansen | West End | May 2022 (1) | Lasagna | MP4 (4K) 9.73gb\n\nCast: Sam Tutty (Evan Hansen), Rebecca McKinnis (Heidi Hansen), Hannah Qureshi (u/s Zoe Murphy), Lauren Ward (Cynthia Murphy), Rupert Young (Larry Murphy), Ellis Kirk (u/s Connor Murphy), Jack Loxton (Jared Kleinman), Iona Fraser (Alana Beck)\n\n* Incredible capture of Hannah as Zoe! Shot with lots of close ups due to intense lighting, follows the action very well. Almost completely unobstructed aside from a few heads that are visible for the rare wide shots.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | West End | May 2022 (2) | Lasagna | MP4 (4K) 9.5gb\n\nCast: Sam Tutty (Evan Hansen), Rebecca McKinnis (Heidi Hansen), Samantha Mbolekwa (u/s Zoe Murphy), Lauren Ward (Cynthia Murphy), Rupert Young (Larry Murphy), Ellis Kirk (u/s Connor Murphy), Jack Loxton (Jared Kleinman), Hannah Qureshi (u/s Alana Beck)\n\n* Good capture with a few covers on! Minor obstruction from a head that doesn't block too much of the action. Missing most of Disappear as I had to change my SD card mid-show but complete otherwise.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | 29 May 2022 M | bikinibottomday | MP4 (4K) 10.59gb\n\nCast: Mateo Lizcano (alt Evan Hansen), Jessica Phillips (Heidi Hansen), Talia Simone Robinson (Zoe Murphy), Christiane Noll (Cynthia Murphy), Manoel Felciano (Larry Murphy), Josh Strobl (u/s Connor Murphy), Jared Goldsmith (Jared Kleinman), Phoebe Koyabe (Alana Beck)\n\n* Great 4K capture of a rare set of understudies. Act one up to ‘Sincerely, Me' has quite a bit obstructed due to two heads, including parts of ‘For Forever,' ‘Waving Through a Window,' and a few other scenes. During and after ‘Sincerely Me,' there are no more obstructions, just some very short moments of adjusting / wandering / unfocusing. Spotlight washout is persistent in wide/medium shots throughout the video, but is worked around best as possible. Includes curtain call.\n\n​\n\nDear Evan Hansen | First National Tour | June 2022 | Sbeve/QuoxWoodTrees | MP4 (HD) 4.63gb\n\nCast: Anthony Norman (Evan Hansen), Coleen Sexton (Heidi Hansen), Alaina Anderson (Zoe Murphy), Lili Thomas (Cynthia Murphy), John Hemphill (Larry Murphy), Nikhil Saboo (Connor Murphy), Reese Sebastian Diaz (u/s Jared Kleinman), Micaela Lamas (Alana Beck)\n\n* Good quality video with minor obstructions (heads) that I work around. Occasional shakiness, drifting, dropout etc from re-adjusting and usher activity. Still very watchable with mix of wide and zooms. Note that due to the lighting of this show, there is more spotlight washout/graininess than my usual video quality. Some scenes are better lit than others. Please check out screenshots to see what you can expect.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | West End | July 2022 | Lasagna | MP4 (4K) 9.79gb\n\nCast: Mitchell Zhangazha (u/s Evan Hansen), Rebecca McKinnis (Heidi Hansen), Hannah Qureshi (u/s Zoe Murphy), Lauren Ward (Cynthia Murphy), Mark Peachey (u/s Larry Murphy), Doug Colling (Connor Murphy), Jack Loxton (Jared Kleinman), Iona Fraser (Alana Beck)\n\n* Excellent capture of one of Mitch's last Evan shows! Almost entirely unobstructed shot. Mitch and Hannah both gave a softer take on their respective roles which made them an adorable pairing.\n\n​\n\nDear Evan Hansen | First National Tour | July 2022 (1) | Sbeve/QuoxWoodTrees | MP4 (HD) 4.81gb\n\nCast: Reese Sebastian Diaz (u/s Evan Hansen), Coleen Sexton (Heidi Hansen), Alaina Anderson (Zoe Murphy), Lili Thomas (Cynthia Murphy), John Hemphill (Larry Murphy), Nikhil Saboo (Connor Murphy), Ian Coursey (u/s Jared Kleinman), Micaela Lamas (Alana Beck)\n\n* Great quality, unobstructed video.

Act 1 is pretty stable, Act 2 has frequent shakiness, drifting, dropout etc from re-adjusting (still very watchable). Nice mix of wide and zooms. Note that due to the lighting of this show, there is more spotlight washout/graininess than my usual video quality. Some scenes are better lit than others.

Washout is the biggest issue but still very watchable. Only obstructions are the occasional bars and heads downstage and to the left, which doesn't cut off anything too important for too long. Few dropouts. Beautiful video featuring plenty of wideshots and some closeups.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | First National Tour | August 2022 (2) | stillreprise | MP4 (HD) 3.97gb\n\nCast: Anthony Norman (Evan Hansen), Coleen Sexton (Heidi Hansen), Alaina Anderson (Zoe Murphy), Lili Thomas (Cynthia Murphy), John Hemphill (Larry Murphy), Nikhil Saboo (Connor Murphy), Pablo David Laucerica (Jared Kleinman), Micaela Lamas (Alana Beck)\n\n* Slight shakiness and wandering with some focal issues. Washout is the biggest issue but still very watchable. Very minimal obstructions if any. Due to a camera error, brief portions of some scenes are audio only (patched in from my phone audio). The audio is a bit worse quality in these places but they’re brief and infrequent so they shouldn’t be too bothersome and nothing important is missed.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | West End | August 2022 | Lasagna | MP4 (4K) 9.83gb\n\nCast: Sam Tutty (Evan Hansen), Lisa Brescia (e/c Heidi Hansen), Samantha Mbolekwa (u/s Zoe Murphy), Tricia Adele-Turner (u/s Cynthia Murphy), Mark Peachey (u/s Larry Murphy), Doug Colling (Connor Murphy), Haydn Cox (u/s Jared Kleinman), Iona Fraser (Alana Beck)\n\n* Great capture of Lisa emergency covering in the West End!

This show has a lot of bright lights, so some of the scenes are washout out a bit, a few scenes are slanted, but still very watchable. Almost all action captured, except on the extreme right side of the video on very few scenes. Includes Video, audio (tracked by MozartWasCrazy and untracked), and program.\n\n​\n\nDear Evan Hansen | West End | September 2022 | Lasagna | MP4 (4K) 9.66gb\n\nCast: Sam Tutty (Evan Hansen), Rebecca McKinnis (Heidi Hansen), Stephanie La Rochelle (e/c Zoe Murphy), Lauren Ward (Cynthia Murphy), Rupert Young (Larry Murphy), Doug Colling (Connor Murphy), Jack Loxton (Jared Kleinman), Hannah Qureshi (u/s Alana Beck)\n\n* Amazing capture of Steph’s final performance as Zoe!

Camera wanders at times, but captures most of the action. Only scenes not included were half of the Jared and Evan scene after For Forever (cuts after 'so what else did you completely fuck up?') to the end of the first chorus of Requiem, the argument scene before Good For You until the middle of the song after the fight with Alana, and 5 seconds of the transition between For Forever (Reprise) and Evan talking to Alana.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | Broadway | 17 September 2022 (Highlights) | MOV (HD) 7.35gb\n\nCast: Sam Primack (Evan Hansen), Jessica Phillips (Heidi Hansen), Talia Simone Robinson (Zoe Murphy), Ann Sanders (Cynthia Murphy), Manoel Felciano (Larry Murphy), Noah Keiserman (Connor Murphy), Gaten Matarazzo (Jared Kleinman), Ciara Alyse Harris (Alana Beck)\n\n* Second to last performance on Broadway. Highlights: Opening Monologue, Waving Through a Window, Second Monologue, For Forever, Sincerely, Me, Requiem, If I Could Tell Her, Disappear, You Will Be Found, Sincerely, Me (Reprise), To Break in a Glove, Only Us, Good for You, 'How did you break your arm, Evan?'

Video is largely filmed in closeups to avoid spotlight washout. There are occasional moments of wandering and unfocusing. Due to a camera glitch, a few seconds of the very end of 'Requiem' are missing. Includes curtain call, audio is fed from external source.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | First National Tour | December 2022 | allisforgiven | MP4 (HD) 9.79gb\n\nCast: Jeffrey Cornelius (alt Evan Hansen), Kelsey Venter (u/s Heidi Hansen), Alaina Anderson (Zoe Murphy), Lili Thomas (Cynthia Murphy), Brian Munn (u/s Larry Murphy), August Emerson (Connor Murphy), Reese Sebastian Diaz (u/s Jared Kleinman), Gillian Jackson Han (u/s Alana Beck)\n\n* Full stage shot of this understudy-palooza! Potentially the most understudies/alts captured in a single performance in all of North America (per Encora)! First known capture of Brian Munn and Kelsey Venter (and maybe Gillian Jackson Han?). This was also August Emerson's first week as Connor. Act One ends abruptly in the middle of You Will Be Found (right as the speech is going viral)- with about 2 minutes left of the act. Even though it was shot from an aisle seat, there was an insanely fidgety man one row up who quite frequently found his way into the shot. He never obstructs any of the action, but can be seen on the left side (mostly during Act Two). Overall, great capture of a rare cast.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | First National Tour | December 2022 (2) | stillreprise | MP4 (HD) 4.84gb\n\nCast: Anthony Norman (Evan Hansen), Coleen Sexton (Heidi Hansen), Alaina Anderson (Zoe Murphy), Lili Thomas (Cynthia Murphy), John Hemphill (Larry Murphy), August Emerson (Connor Murphy), Pablo David Laucerica (Jared Kleinman), Micaela Lamas (Alana Beck)\n\n* The spotlight washout is horrible in this one, especially with August since he's super pale and blond. Shoutout to the first blond Connor (and first leftie Connor), though. Includes bows.\n\nDear Evan Hansen | First National Tour | December 2022 (3) | stillreprise | MP4 (HD) 5.8gb\n\nCast: Anthony Norman (Evan Hansen), Coleen Sexton (Heidi Hansen), Alaina Anderson (Zoe Murphy), Lili Thomas (Cynthia Murphy), John Hemphill (Larry Murphy), August Emerson (Connor Murphy), Ian Coursey (u/s Jared Kleinman), Micaela Lamas (Alana Beck)\n\n* The people beside us are sort of obnoxious but they leave at intermission so things quiet down for the second act. For some reason the ushers decide to seat a party in front of us during Waving Through a Window so during that time there's a dropout, then a foot fancam because the woman decided to lean as much as humanly possible. There is another dropout and mild shuffling as I swap seats with my friend during the scene after (the computer lab scene). ​\n\nDeath Note: The Musical | Japan | 13 April 2015 M | Proshot | MP4 (HD) 2.81gb or AVI (HD) 3.43gb\n\nCast: Kenji Urai (Light Yagami), Teppei Koike (L), Fuuka Yuzuki (Misa Amane), Ami Maeshima (Sayu Yagami), Megumi Hamada (Rem), Koutaro Yoshida (Ryuk), Takeshi Kaga (Souichiro Yagami)\n\n* Kenji Urai version.

Kilmer (Rockwell), Josh Prince (Gyp Watson), John Boldenow (Mayer Slade)\n\n* Semi-pro shot with one camera. Includes local news coverage and scanned program info. Some generation loss, shakiness, and a bit of washout.\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada | Pre-Broadway / Chicago | July 2022 (Preview) | allisforgiven | MP4 (HD) 7.63gb\n\nCast: Beth Leavel (Miranda Priestly), Jessie Hooker-Bailey (u/s Andy Sachs), Javier Muñoz (Nigel Owens), Christiana Cole (Lauren Hunter), Megan Masako Haley (Emily Charlton), Tiffany Mann (Kayla Ward), Michael Tacconi (Nate Angstrom)⁣, Terrance Spencer (u/s Christian Thompson), Kyle Brown (Ensemble), Olivia Cipolla (Ensemble), Jojo Carmichael (s/w Ensemble), Tyrone Davis Jr. (Ensemble), Audrey Douglass (Ensemble), Hannah Douglass (Ensemble), Madison Fendley (s/w Ensemble), Cailen Fu (Ensemble), Michael Samarie George (Ensemble), Henry Gottfried (Ensemble), Marya Grandy (Ensemble), Liana Hunt (Ensemble), Amber Jackson (Ensemble), Carlos A Jimenez (Ensemble), Chris Jarosz (s/w Ensemble), Nikka Graff Lanzarone (Ensemble), Anthony Murphy (Ensemble), Jim Ortlieb (Ensemble), Johnny Rice (Ensemble), Sawyer Smith (Ensemble), CJ Tyson (Ensemble)\n\n* Phone boot. This is a full stage shot. There is a bar that obstructs the bottom left corner of the stage, but never obstructs any of the action. The full show is captured, including curtain call. This boot suffers from lots of washout. The Runway set was completely white, so those scenes are the worst, but the action can still be seen. Act two is, for lack of a better way to put it, a blurry mess. While the whole stage was captured, none of it is in focus. Again, all the action is there, just blurred. I did my best to clean everything up, but see screenshots for an idea of the blur/washout situation. There's a bit of wandering and jumpiness, but for the most part the stage is in frame the entire time. Good audio throughout!\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada | Pre-Broadway / Chicago | August 2022 | StarCuffedJeans | MP4 (HD) 5.72gb\n\nCast: Beth Leavel (Miranda Priestly), Taylor Iman Jones (Andy Sachs), Javier Muñoz (Nigel Owens), Christiana Cole (Lauren Hunter), Megan Masako Haley (Emily Charlton), Tiffany Mann (Kayla Ward), Michael Tacconi (Nate Angstrom), Terrance Spencer (u/s Christian Thompson), Kyle Brown (Ensemble), Jojo Carmichael (s/w Ensemble), Olivia Cipolla (Ensemble), Tyrone Davis Jr (Ensemble), Audrey Douglass (Ensemble), Hannah Douglass (Ensemble), Cailen Fu (Ensemble), Michael Samarie George (Ensemble), Henry Gottfried (Ensemble), Marya Grandy (Ensemble), Liana Hunt (Ensemble), Amber Jackson (Ensemble), Nikka Graff Lanzarone (Ensemble), Anthony Murphy (Ensemble), Jim Ortlieb (Ensemble), Johnny Rice (Ensemble), Sawyer Smith (Ensemble), CJ Tyson (Ensemble)\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada | Pre-Broadway / Chicago | 21 August 2022 (Closing Night) | foundyourheart | MP4 (HD) 1.63gb or MTS\n\nCast: Christiana Cole (Lauren Hunter), Megan Masako Haley (Emily Charlton), Beth Leavel (Miranda Priestly), Taylor Iman Jones (Andy Sachs), Tiffany Mann (Kayla Ward), Javier Muñoz (Nigel Owens), Micheal Tacconi (Nate Angstrom), Christian Thompson (Christian Thompson), Kyle Brown, Olivia Cipolla, Tyrone Davis Jr., Audrey Douglass, Cailen Fu, Michael Samarie George, Henry Gottfried, Marya Grandy, Jessie Hooker-Bailey, Liana Hunt, Amber Jackson, Nikka Graff Lanzarone, Anthony Murphy, Jim Ortlieb, Johnny Rice, Sawyer Smith, Terrance Spencer, CJ Tyson, Jojo Carmichael (s/w)\n\n* Closing performance of the chicago tryout. The opening number is pretty shaky due to late audience members. There’s a blackout when andy is first talking to emily, and then another in miranda’s office both from late arrivals. As usual some wandering and washout but overall this is a very solid video with more wideshots than usual. The sound on the mp4 file has been replaced with the audio taken on my phone, but the mts files have the original audio that fizzes out when the songs are too loud.\n\nDiana: The Musical | Broadway | 2021 | Proshot | MP4 (HD) 2.24gb or MKV (HD) 4.48gb\n\nCast: Jeanna de Waal (Diana), Roe Hartrampf (Prince Charles), Erin Davie (Camilla Parker Bowles), Judy Kaye (Queen Elizabeth), Zach Adkins, Ashley Andrews, Austen Danielle Bohmer, Holly Ann Butler, Bruce Dow, Lauren E.J.

A couple heads at the bottom, but they don't block anything. Very steady, no washout, and the sound is excellent. Lots of wide shots for the dance numbers, as well as a mix of mediums and close-ups for conversational bits. Includes curtain call.\n\nDirty Rotten Scoundrels | Broadway | 31 January 2005 (Preview) | VOB + smalls\n\nCast: John Lithgow (Lawrence Jameson), Norbert Leo Butz (Freddy Benson), Sherie Rene Scott (Christine Colgate), Joanna Gleason (Muriel Eubanks)\n\n* Filmed on first night of Previews.

Zooms and wide shots to focus on characters or larger ensemble numbers. Not my cup of tea for shows, but I know many who really enjoy it, and Stephen Patterson was quite the standout in this show. This is the Drayton Entertainment (Ontario, Canada) production that went on tour around North America in 2008-2009.\n\n​\n\nDirty Rotten Scoundrels | West End | 20 November 2014 | VOB + smalls\n\nCast: Robert Lindsay (Lawrence Jameson), Alex Gaumond (Freddy Benson), Katherine Kingsley (Christine Colgate), Bonnie Langford (Muriel Eubanks), Gary Wilmot (Andre Thibault), Lizzy Connolly (Jolene Oakes)\n\nDirty Rotten Scoundrels | Musical Theatre West | 9 July 2016 | SJ Bernly | VOB + smalls\n\nCast: Davis Gaines (Lawrence Jameson), Benjamin Schrader (Freddy Benson), Rebecca Johnson (Christine Colgate), Cynthia Ferrer (Muriel Eubanks), Kyle Nudo (Andre Thibault), Jennifer Kranz (Jolene Oakes)\n\n* This version more closely follows the West End version of the show with \"Give Them What They Want\" as the opening number and \"Chimp in a Suit\" being cut.

Four of the first five minutes are blacked out and there is a three minute blackout for the audience participation during Not V'one Red Cent, a six minute blackout during Perfect, and the last two minutes of the final song are blacked out. One head that blocks a small part of the front/center part of the stage, but it only blocks the actors feet/legs.\n\nDisenchanted! | Art Lab | 15 December 2020 | Livestream | MP4 (HD) 2.6gb\n\nCast: Diana DeGarmo, Micaela Diamond, Celia Rose Gooding, Liisi LaFontaine, Jaygee Macapugay, Ashley Pérez Flanagan, Gabriella Pizzolo, Alysha Umphress\n\nDisenchanted! | UK Stream | 2021 | Stream | MP4 (HD) 1.99gb\n\nCast: Jodie Steele (Snow White), Sophie Isaacs (Cinderella), Allie Daniel (Sleeping Beauty), Grace Mouat (Pocahontas), Millie O’Connell (The Little Mermaid), Courtney Bowman (Princess Badroulbadour), Natalie Chua (Hua Mulan), Shanay Holmes (The Princess Who Kissed The Frog), Aisha Jawando (Belle) and Jenny O’Leary (Rapunzel)\n\n​Disney Junior Live on Tour!

Most of the action is there, with just the extreme sides being blocked by two heads. Act two is much better, shot with the normal zooms and following the action well. The heads are still there on the right and left, but they only block the actors' feet. 2 discs.\n\nDogfight | Off-Broadway | 15 August 2012 | SunsetBlvd79 | VOB + smalls\n\nCast: Lindsay Mendez (Rose Fenny), Derek Klena (Eddie Birdlace), Josh Segarra (Boland), Nick Blaemire (Bernstein), Adam Halpin (Stevens), Annaleigh Ashford (Marcy), F Michael Haynie (Fector), Steven Booth (Gibbs), Becca Ayers (Mama), Dierdre Friel (Ruth Two Bears), James Moye (Lounge Singer)\n\n* A Beautiful coming of age story with great performances from the cast.

Taken at the same theatre where my RENT video was captured. This was an amazing show to bring in the holiday spirit and to have some fun. Very hilarious performance from Cody, he was perfect for this role. Some lines from Cody just had me laughing. Amazing to see the mix of adults and kids in this cast. It was a sold out crowd at this performance which is why there is some obstructions and there is some dropouts but, not for too long. There were a lot of kids in the audience and you may hear some kids make remarks but, it doesn’t disrupt much in the show. Amazing performance in all general and spectacular show as well.
