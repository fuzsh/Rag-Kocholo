        "text": "Rumer Willis is bound for Broadway.\n\nThe actress and Dancing with the Stars champ will make her Broadway debut in Chicago this fall. Her limited eight-week engagement at the Ambassador Theatre begins Sept. 21 and runs through Nov. 1.\n\nWillis will rotate in as Roxie Hart, the deadly housewife in the 1920s-set musical about murder and media. The Walter Bobbie-directed revival, which opened in 1996, won six Tony Awards in 1997, including best musical revival, as well as the Grammy Award for best musical theater album.\n\nThe production will star Brandy Norwood in the lead role through Aug. 2. Meanwhile, Amy Spanger (Aug. 4-16) and Dylis Croman (beginning Aug. 18) will play Roxie Hart until Willis’ run.\n\nWillis makes the jump to Broadway as her father, Bruce Willis, makes his own Broadway debut in Misery, the adaptation of Stephen King’s suspense novel. Willis will play the housebound romance novelist Paul Sheldon, who becomes a prisoner of his unhinged “Number One Fan” Annie Wilkes (played by Laurie Metcalf) after she rescues him from a car accident and learns that he plans to kill off her favorite fictional character.\n\nBruce’s play begins previews Oct. 22, just after his daughter’s run wraps.\n\nRumer is repped by APA, Untitled and Gang, Tyre, Ramer & Brown."
