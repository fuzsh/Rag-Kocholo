        "text": "\"Hey there, ladies. How is everyone today?\" They all answer but no one is really listening to me. I hear J. Elaine Marcos and Tracee Beazer discussing the correct way to get glue off your eyelashes while Adinah Alexander is telling us about the great guacamole dish she's going to make this weekend. Ashley Amber Haase is semi-stressing about her upcoming wedding, and Cara Cooper, Christina Sivrich and Nicolette Hart are engaged in a heated, Oprah-style gabfest about how many calories are in a strawberry daiquiri. We are all going out tonight, as we've made Thursday \"ladies night.\" I blow them a kiss and continue down to Amy Spanger's room.\n\n\"Waz up, Tiny?\" she calls out, using a nickname she and Laura Benanti gave me back in Seattle during the show's pre-Broadway run. I tell Amy about how I may have misplaced my green card. With a big grin she says, \"Well, Tiny, it might be with the passport, watch and two cameras you've lost since Seattle.\" For the record, I would lose my head if it were not attached to my body. We giggle, give hugs and off I go again.\n\nLast stop: Stephen Lynch's room. I could lie and say that Stephen and I have deep, intellectual conversations about the meaning of life. In fact, he finds a way to make fun of something I've just said, and I take the abuse so I can steal a mini Snickers from his candy jar. Yummy! Now I have about 10 more minutes to kill, so I continue puttering around. From wigs to wardrobe, sound to our stellar crew, the musicians to our amazing stage management, there are so many people I can irritateâ€”and so little time. Over the theater intercom I hear, \"This is your five-minute call. Five minutes to the top of Act One.\"\n\nThe cast heads to the stage and we circle up with a little gospel clap. With hands piled on top of one another, Matt Stocke gives us the cast news update and counts down to show time with a \"1, 2, 3, Wedding Singer!\" The overture begins, then \"It's Your Wedding Day\" and the curtain goes up. Stage left, I do the running step along with the cast and then head out front to catch the rest of the number. As I sit in the back of the house, I smile proudly as I watch my buds dancing and singing their faces off. I am so honored to be a part of such a talented group of people.\n\nMy size eights take me back up what feels like 843 steps to the sixth floor. Sometimes to keep myself busy I do a little writing, read a little Shakespeare by Shakespeare I mean the Enquirer or maybe play guitar. But tonight I have to work on bridal jewelry for Ashley Amber's upcoming wedding.\n\nI began making beaded earrings when I said \"I do\" in 2005 and wanted to give my bridesmaids a unique gift that had meaning. I loved designing something original for them, and my gifts soon became a full-time hobby. I've now designed and made specialty pieces for five bridal parties. It's a great feeling to know that a bride, on her special day, is going to wear something that I created just for her. [Editor's note: Maddigan is too modest to mention that the striking beaded necklace she made for Haase was plainly visible in a photo accompanying the Sunday New York Times \"Vows\" article on the actress's wedding.]"
