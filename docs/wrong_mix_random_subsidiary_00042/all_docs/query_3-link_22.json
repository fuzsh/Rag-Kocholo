        "text": "Back in those early heady days of bashing out my first novel, my friend Wendy criticised me for being a little scant on my character description.\n\n“I don’t know what these people look like,” she said.\n\nI mumbled some rubbish about wanting my readers to make up their own mind and she probably gave me one of her looks, because I went straight home and spent the next few hours on google finding images of actors & actresses that reminded me of the characters I’d created, and could make a pretty good job of playing that character should the book ever be made into a movie, or turned into telly. I printed those pictures off, stuck them on a notice board in my office, and glanced at them frequently whenever I was writing.\n\nIt’s a trick that I’ve adopted ever since. Right now, hanging just to the right of my computer screen, is a cork board with a picture of Martin Freeman on it. An actor who would be absolutely excellent in the lead role of my third novel.\n\nYes, third.\n\nMy second novel – The Truth About This Charming Man – came out mere days ago, and here’s something quite exciting, there’s already been some chat about turning it into a movie! And I’m not referring to private insane ramblings between me and my cat. I mean proper, serious, genuine ‘chat’ by people whose job it is to rub shoulders with those who are in a position to actually make things happen, and tempt them with the movie / TV rights of their numerous clients.\n\nNow I expect these kind of conversations happen quite frequently, and I expect the vast majority of those conversations never amount to anything – just as (so I’m told), only a very small percentage of books where the movie / TV rights are successfully negotiated actually ever end up being made into anything you’re ever like to see – but it’s all very exciting none the less, and because of my approach to figuring out character description, should anyone ever ask me if I’ve got any ideas who should play which role, I can do something more than mumble “I dunno, that guy from one of the X-men films?”\n\nHere then, are those pictures that until recently were pinned just to the right of my desk. Those talented stars of stage and screen who I would dearly love to breathe life into the lives of people who up until a few days ago only existed in my head.\n\nIf you’ve already started reading The Truth About This Charming Man I’d love to know what you think. Post your thoughts, feelings, or alternative casting ideas in the comments at the bottom of this page (or here if you’re reading this in an email).\n\nWilliam Lewis (James MacAvoy)\n\n“My name is William. Will to my friends. Though it could just as easily be Gary, or Roger, or Stephan – just tell me who you’d like me to be and watch me morph into someone else. It’s not lying. Lying is an untruth. This is acting. It’s telling a story, and stories are a good thing: they teach us. They help us to make sense of the world. They allow us to stay safe – in that way they’re better than the truth.”\n\nJames MacAvoy was pretty much my first choice when casting the story’s lead character in my mind. Though I know nothing about the man (other than his numerous screen appearances) I wouldn’t be the slightest bit surprised if he’s as obsessed about his craft in real life, as Will is in the book.\n\nNathia Brockenhurst (Olivia Williams)\n\n“Nathia’s smiling when she opens the door. A big, warm, welcoming smile that promises an evening of laughter and cocktails. The smile falters when she sees that it’s me. “You’re late,” she says with enough venom to poison a small army. She turns and stomps back into her apartment, and I notice she’s already in full costume: slim-fit high-waist sleek-black trousers, semi-translucent shirt, killer heels – the usual Nathia attire.”\n\nI’ve always been a big fan of Olivia Williams, and when it comes to playing high-flying brutal-business-woman-with-a-secret Nathia Brockenhurst, I have absolutely no doubt she’d walk the part.\n\nMichael Richmond (Hugh Grant)\n\n“In many ways Michael Richmond is a man out of time. A century or two ago he’d have a bushy moustache, impressive sideburns, and a belly the size of a small country. He’d spend his evenings smoking expensive cigars and talking about his time in Africa. Roll back the centuries still further and I can imagine him dressed in animal furs, sporting a heavy copper helmet, and wielding a blade high above his head before he conquers another village, and takes his pick of the wenches available. But instead Michael goes to the gym. He watches his weight. He pops statins. And on evenings such as this, he shares stories of boring corporate deals negotiated across expensive but dull conference room tables. Is it any wonder that he drinks too much, laughs too loudly, and always looks as if he might explode at any given moment? That granite exterior is holding a lifetime of frustration in place. “\n\nHugh Grant built almost an entire career playing ‘the toff’, ‘the fop’, and every variation in-between. But allegedly Helen Fielding always had him in mind for the character of Daniel bit-of-a-bastard Cleaver in Bridget Jones’s Diary. It’s that charming-but-evil element that I think he could carry off so well in the role of Michael Richmond.\n\nRachel Richmond (Anne Hathaway)\n\n“But behind that shy smile, those beautiful soft cappuccino eyes, and her tall, lean, slightly Arabian veneer, is someone else. And sometimes, when she’s asked me an innocent sounding question, she stays quiet after I’ve given my answer, like she’s waiting for me to say more, waiting for me to give myself away. I’d be lying if I said it doesn’t give me something of a buzz.”\n\nWhen it came to casting the love-interest it really didn’t take me long to come up with a suitable candidate. Oh come on. Can you blame me? If I’ve got to write convincing love-scenes then when I glance up at the pin board I need to be looking directly into the face of a woman I could easily find myself falling in love with! That’s my excuse, I’m sticking to it.\n\nZlata Ruzencova (Vera Farmiga)\n\n“One particularly chilly morning in March, an eccentric gum chewing woman of indeterminate years – all wild bleached blonde hair (with dark roots), pristine makeup (and plenty of it) – turned up on my doorstep.\n\n‘Hello,’ she said, as I opened the door. ‘You are Lewis, the actor. Yes?’\n\n‘If you say so,’ I replied. It was very early in the morning. Too early to be standing on my doorstep talking to a tall lady in a fake-fur-coat that just about covered her shoulders, and a snake-skin mini-skirt that was barely long enough to cover, well, anything.”\n\nOf all the characters in the book Zlata is far and away my favourite. Even now, long after I penned her last few lines, she’s still in my head, passing judgement on all that I do, and asking me, sometimes several times a day, where is my plan for cake.\n\nIf I were an actress (just go with me on this), then Zlata would be the role I would love to play. Casting her however, was a huge challenge. No one seemed quite right – then a friend suggested Vera Farmiga and after that, well… there was no after that! She’s perfect.\n\nSo? What d’you think? Post your thoughts and / or alternative casting suggestions in the comments.\n\nHot news; my second novel The Truth About This Charming Man is available right now, in paperback and for your phone, tablet, computer or kindle device!\n\nRead the opening chapter, right now, right here.\n\nThe film will be along some time in the next decade.\n\nThis is a transcript of a video that I posted on social media earlier today. If you would prefer to view the video, which is only 4 minutes in length, click here now (or press the play button if you can see an image immediately below).\n\nHello,\n\nMany of you know me as the self-help author turned novelist Peter Jones.\n\nWhat most of you don’t know is that over the past year or so I have taken on a number of other – let’s call them positions – in order to support myself. Some of these ‘jobs’ have been somewhat unusual, and most have required me to tight-lipped about what I get up to in my non-writing hours.\n\nBut no more.\n\nThe time has come for me to tell the truth, to expose those who should know better.\n\nBefore I turned writer I was involved with a small theatre company, and during that time I developed quite a talent for characterisation & costume, impersonation and disguise.\n\nIt’s these remarkable skills that I’ve been peddling to certain individuals, often the rich and the famous, whenever they were too busy or just too idle to appear in person.\n\nLet me take a moment to show you what i mean…\n\nHere’s the actor Hugh Grant as he attends yet another film premier. But I think, in light of what i just told you, you can begin to get a sense that something isn’t quite right, that Hugh seems a little different somehow – and that is of course because it’s not Hugh. It’s me. A pair of black rimmed spectacles completing the costume.\n\nNow different day, different role, but again, I think you can probably tell, when you look closely, that it isn’t the actor James Macavoy… but yours truly.\n\nPlaying James again, this time trying not to be distracted by Keira Knightly’s erm… By Keira Knightly.\n\nAnd again, this time with a life sized hand puppet of the actor Michael Fassbender.\n\nMe again. This time standing in for the actress and singer Rita Ora. Probably one of my most demanding roles to date. Particularly as it was such a cold day.\n\nAnother role… that costume was particularly ticklish…\n\nOh and er, yes, not quite sure how this once slipped in, but here I am again. Possibly not so clear which of these two famous people i’m standing in for but if we pan back slightly…\n\nYes, there i am. Still trying to pass Kylie Minogue a copy of my last novel.\n\nNeedless to say, I’m not proud myself, and I hope you can forgive me for helping facilitate this deceit and for plunging to such depths. It’s a tough life being an author, but really, that’s no excuse for my behaviour.\n\nYou can help of course.\n\nIt just so happens that this week I have a new novel out!\n\nTHE TRUTH ABOUT THIS CHARMING MAN Is the witty tale of a struggling actor and the extraordinary lengths he goes to… for the woman he loves.\n\nIt’s out now in paperback, and for whatever device your currently using to view this blog – and it’s only a couple of quid. Just click here. Go on. Help out a struggling author.\n\nIn the meantime, please help me apologise to your friends by SHARING the video at the top of this blog post on facebook, twitter, or your social media outlet of choice. Though now that you know what I’ve been up to, you might start to see some of them in a new light."
