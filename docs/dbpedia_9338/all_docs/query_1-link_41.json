        "text": "Obverse\n\nIn this context, the obverse refers to the front of the coin.\n\nOrt\n\nAn \"ort\", a quarter, was equal to 24 skillings from the 1620s. These were the primary small-denomination coins in Norway in the 1700s. In the Norwegian monetary system of 1816, one species taler equalled 5 ort = 120 skillings.\n\nOverstrike\n\nCoins struck using other coins. It is often possible to see traces of the old coin's design under the new pattern. The method was typically used in times of crisis.\n\nPeter's pence\n\nA fee that was collected and paid to the Pope in Rome in the Middle Ages. It was introduced in Norway in 1152. Originally, everyone who owned three marks, a weapon and good clothing was to pay one penny per year. Not many records have been found indicating when the fee was collected though it survived until 1529.\n\nPure silver\n\nIt was generally not possible to produce pure (100%) silver in the Middle Ages, but this was a technical accounting term used in mint ordinances and when paying for deliveries of silver.\n\n\"Quisling\"\n\nThe two-krone note issued by the occupation authorities during World War II was popularly referred to as a \"Quisling\". The one-krone note was called an \"Usling\", meaning a coward, wretch or scoundrel. So a \"Quisling\" was worth two \"Usling\".\n\nRemedy\n\nThe legally permissible deviation, upward and downward, from the specified gross- and net weight.\n\nRetterbot\n\nIn the old Norwegian legal system, this was a special law ordained by the king. In particular, this would refer to amendments to the existing law code.\n\nReverse\n\nThe reverse side of the coin, as opposed to the obverse.\n\nRiksdaler\n\nThe Norwegian term for taler, divided in 96 skillings. The riksdaler formed the basis of the country's monetary system from the 1500s to 1813. Usually, it was not issued as an individual coin.\n\nFor struck coins there were three systems operating in parallel: riksdaler species, riksdaler kroner and riksdaler kurant.\n\nWhole talers were only issued in the first system, species taler.\n\nIn the krone and the kurant system, normally only fractions of a taler were minted.\n\nMark pieces were linked to the krone coin and the smallest skilling pieces to the kurant coin.\n\nThere were significant differences between the three systems. When comparing a species taler, six marks and 96 skillings, for example, each group represented the same number of skillings, but the difference in silver content was nearly 10 grams.\n\nSeignorage\n\nThe profit made from coining; i.e. the difference between the cost of production and the nominal value of the coins.\n\nStandard\n\nThe officially decreed content of precious metal in a coin. In former times this was typically expressed by specifying how many or which value of the main coin unit was to be coined from one unit of weight of the precious metal.\n\nThe Sigtuna coinage\n\nIn Sigtuna by Uppsala in Sweden, pennies were being minted in the name of Olof Skötkonung around the same time that Olav Tryggvason was issuing pennies in Norway. The reverse inscription on Olof Skötkonung's and Olav Tryggvason's pennies indicate that the English Mint-master Godwine was involved in both coinings.\n\nSpecies taler\n\nIn the Danish-Norwegian monetary system three different systems were used:\n\nThe species taler was the main coin in the system.\n\nThe krone coin was a medium sized silver coin worth 2/3 of a species taler (4 mark).\n\nAll small-denomination coins were referred to as kurant-coins.\n\nThe main unit in all three systems was called a riksdaler. There were 96 skillings to each riksdaler. The silver content of a riksdaler was different in the three systems. While the species taler had a silver content of 25.28 grams, the riksdaler krone had a silver content of 22.48 grams and the riksdaler kurant only 20.63 grams.\n\nSpecies\n\nThe term for the Danish-Norwegian (and international) currency from the end of the 1500s. This currency was gradually replaced by the krone-currency and from about 1700, by the kurant-currency. Towards the end of the 1700s there was a failed attempt to reintroduce the species currency.\n\nSterling\n\nThe name of the English penny. In the Middle Ages the sterling was minted as a silver coin with 925/1000 fineness (giving rise to the term sterling silver). The sterling coin types were widely used and copied on the continent and to a certain degree also in Norway or Scandinavia.\n\nXXX (Stokkprøve)\n\nA production test sample of the finished, struck coins..\n\nSættargjerden\n\nThe treaty between Magnus Lagabøte (Lawmender) and Archbishop Jon Raude in Tønsberg in 1277. This treaty secured the church the right to mint coins, extensive tax exemptions and other privileges.\n\nXXX (Tein)\n\nA flat, cast bar of currency metal that was rolled or hammered into the thickness the coin was to have.\n\nTravel dollar\n\nIn the 1700s these coins were struck for official royal visits to Norway. They were originally intended be used during the journey as rewards and honours and typically bore a political inscription flattering the people the king was visiting. One such coin from 1788, for example, bears the inscription:\n\n\"STEADFAST AS THE MOUNTAINS OF DOVRE - SO TOO ARE THE LOYALTY, VALOUR AND MIGHT OF THE SONS OF NORWAY\".\n\nUROKKELIG SOM DOVRES HØYE FJELDE STAAR NORGES SØNNERS TROSKAB MOD OG VÆLDE\n\nTithe\n\nActually, a \"tenth\". A church tax that was introduced in Norway by Sigurd Jorsalfare (the crusader) around 1120. A tenth of all income was to be paid to the church in the form of coins, silver or produce.\n\nXXX (Tilsats)\n\nA metal that was alloyed with silver to achieve the correct fineness for the currency metal. This metal could be either granaille-copper containing small amounts of silver, or pure copper.\n\nTriquetra\n\nNumismatists and other experts have interpreted the triquetra-motif in many different ways when appearing in a Nordic context.\n\nThe Gordic knot.\n\nHrungnir's heart. In Nordic mythology the giant Hrungnir, who is finally killed by Tor, had a heart of stone with three points.\n\nA assemblage of three shields, which, on the earliest Danish triquetra coins presented Knut (Canute) the Great as being member of the royal Skoldung (shield) family.\n\nSymbol of the Trinity.\n\nToday the triquetra symbol is generally considered a motif with a certain magical-religious significance\n\n\"Usling\"\n\nA one-krone note issued by the occupying powers during WWII. It was popularly referred to as an \"usling\", or a \"wretch\". The two-krone note was called a \"Quisling\". So a \"Quisling\" was the equivalent of two \"usling\".\n\nWeight system\n\nBefore the decimal system was introduced, silver and gold were weighed according to the following system:\n\n1 mark = 16 lodd\n\n1 lodd = 4 kvintin\n\n1 kvintin = 4 pennies\n\nWig eight-skilling\n\nEight-skilling pieces from Frederick IV. The obverse carries his picture, a portrait very much dominated by his large wig. This coin was struck in very large numbers from 1700 to1715, in the early part of Frederick's reign. Later, they were often used by farmers as vest and jacket buttons.\n\nWitten\n\nA silver coin minted in the German city of Lübeck from 1365. Its value was four pennies or 1/3 skilling. King Hans introduced the coin in Norway where it was referred to as \"hvid\". The last \"hvid\" issued in Norway was minted in Bergen in 1575-78.\n\nØre\n\nA unit of weight used in the Middle ages (see mark). Also a monetary unit in the Norwegian monetary system from 1875."
