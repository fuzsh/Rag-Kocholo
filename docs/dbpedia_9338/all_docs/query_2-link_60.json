It is abbreviated with the dollar sign $. There is no standard disambiguating form, but the abbreviations ATA$, AQ$ and A$ are frequently used for distinction from other dollar-denominated currencies (though A$ remains ambiguous with the Australian dollar).\n\nTerminology\n\nOn 15 January 1520, the Kingdom of Bohemia began minting coins from silver mined locally in Joachimsthal and marked on reverse with the Bohemian lion. The coins would be named Joachimsthaler after the town, becoming shortened in common usage to thaler or taler. The town itself derived its name from Saint Joachim, coupled with the German word Thal (Tal in modern spelling) means 'valley' (cf. the English term dale).\n\nThis name found its way into other languages, for example:\n\nGerman — Thaler (or Taler)\n\nCzech, Slovak and Slovenian — tolar\n\nSlovak — toliar\n\nCroatian — talir\n\nPolish — talar\n\nLow German — daler\n\nDutch — rijksdaalder (or daler, pronounced \"dollar\")\n\nDanish and Norwegian — rigsdaler\n\nSwedish — riksdaler\n\nSpanish — dólar (or real de a ocho or peso duro)\n\nHungarian — tallér\n\nEthiopian — talari (ታላሪ)\n\nEnglish — dollar\n\nPegged currencies"
