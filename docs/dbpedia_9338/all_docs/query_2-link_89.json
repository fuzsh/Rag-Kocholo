A short history of paper money in Denmark from the first notes in 1713 to the latest issue is added together with chapters dealing with the paper for the notes, the printing, circulation and cancelling after the notes have been redeemed. A special chapter relates to some cases of counterfeiting. An appendix contains tables registering the number of notes printed during the years, the number of notes circulating etc.\n\nThe book is written by a group of paper money collectors from the Danish Numismatic Society. The greater part of the notes illustrated originate in The Royal Collection of Coins and Medals, Copenhagen. All the photographs of the notes are reproduced in the same scale: 55 per cent linear of the actual note, equivalent to 30 per cent in size. This is the upper limit for which it is possible to get permission to reproduce the current Danish notes.\n\nThe book concentrates on the official paper money in the kingdom of Denmark. The private issues are not included, neither are the notes from Danish West Indies, Greenland, nor the former Danish Duchies of Slesvig and Holsten.\n\nThe edition of \"The official Paper Money of Denmark\" has been made possible by a magnificient grant from Danmarks Nationalbank together with other benefactors, page 5.\n\nReferences to the numbering in Standard Catalog of World Paper Money by Albert Pick are made with the permission from Krause Publications, Inc.\n\nA preliminary draft of this summary has most kindly been corrected by Courtney L. Coffing from Coin World. Any errors in the final summary are due to the Danish editor.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nDOP = Denmark's Official Paper Money, number + nr. in catalogue.\n\nk. = kurant\n\nHpl. = printing (I and II)\n\nKM = The Royal Collection of Coins and Medals, Copenhagen.\n\nkr. = krone(r)\n\nmio. = million\n\nPM = Police Museum (now in KM)\n\nRA = The Danish State's Record Office\n\nrbd. = rigsbankdaler (1/2 rdsp.), 1813-1854\n\nrd. = rigsdaler (specie or kurant), until 1813\n\nrdlr. = rigsdaler ( = rigsbankdaler), 1854-1875\n\nsk. = skilling (1/96 rd)\n\nsp. = specie\n\nstk. = pieces\n\nU = ground (I, II and III)\n\nVm = watermark\n\nAbbreviations for Literature are listed in the Danish indices, page 13 and 332.\n\nN.B. The use of periods and decimal points in Denmark is opposite to the English practice. In Danish, one hundred thousand is written 100.000, ten dollars and fifteen cents is written 10,15 dollars instead of 100,000 and $ 10.15.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMost of the paper money used in Denmark have been bank notes. Only one bank at a time had the right to issue notes. The first bank was \"Kurantbanken\", founded in 1737 (figure 3. The house between the Exchange to the left and the ministerial buildings to the right); in 1791. \"Speciebanken\" took over and in 1813 \"Rigsbanken\". Since 1818 \"Nationalbanken i Kjøbenhavn\" - in 1936 renamed \"Danmarks Nationalbank\" - has been Denmark's central bank. All these banks had their headquarters in Copenhagen, Nationalbanken first in the building shown in figure 4 and since 1971 in a great new block, figure 5.\n\nIn former times the notes were redeemable (indløselige) in silver and later in gold. Sometimes the notes were inconvertible (uindløselige), compare table 1.\n\nThe regulations for silver or gold backing for the notes have varied through the ages. Until 1908 the banks were allowed to issue notes up to a certain limit; if they sent out more notes, they had to have full metal backing for the surplus. After 1908 the rule was altered so that half of the notes must be backed by metal. In later years Danmarks Nationalbank has been granted an exemption from this rule.\n\nThe History of Danish Paper Money\n\nThe history of Danish Paper Money can be divided into three parts:\n\n1713-1813. The unit was the \"Rigsdaler specie\". In this period Norway was united with Denmark under the same king. The paper money was produced in Denmark, but circulated in both realms \"The Double-Monarchy Denmark-Norway\" as it was called.* The period ended with the war between England and Denmark.\n\n(*) A detailed catalogue of this paper money is contained in a Norwegian book, Rønning, Bjørn R.: Norges pengesedler og seddelbanker inntil 1874. Bind I: Sedler udstedt i København. (See Numismatic Literature, No. 104, September 1980, page 227, review No. 1199). The main part of the book deals with the Danish-Norwegian notes from 1713 to 1813, printed in Copenhagen. Apart from an issue in 1695, Norway did not get her own separate notes until 1807.\n\n1813-1873. The union between Denmark and Norway came to an end in 1814 and afterwards the two states issued their own notes. In Denmark a new unit was introduced: the \"Rigsbankdaler\" equal to 1/2 rigsdaler specie.\n\n1873-1983. In 1875 another new unit was put in circulation: the \"Krone\" equal to 1/2 rigsbankdaler.\n\nBefore starting the history of the first period it is necessary to say a few words about a matter that is important for the understanding of the monetary history of Denmark in the 18th century:\n\nSpecie and Kurant. In 1713 when Denmark got her first notes, the monetary standard for coins in this country was silver, but the standard for large coins, rigsdaler specie (rd.sp.), differed from the standard for the small change, rigsdaler kurant (rd.k.). The law provided that the content of pure silver in 1 rd.sp. was to be 25,28 grams and the content in 1 rd.k. = 96 skilling in small silver coins, 4 and 8 sk pieces, was to be 20,63 grams. The specie coins would have to be paid when a contract specified these coins; tolls and dues payable by foreigners also had to be met in speciedalers. Kurant coinage was used in daily retail transactions. The notes followed the kurant-reckoning except for a short period.\n\nCorresponding to the silver contents the rate of exchange between kurant and specie was 122 1/2 rd.k. (after 1794 125 rd.k.) = 100 rd.sp. This relation, however, was affected by the amount of large silver Coins available. When the rigsdaler species were scarce, one had to pay more small change to get them - and vice versa. After all this rate of exchange was rather constant until the war between England and Denmark, 1807-1814, when one had to pay up to 1200 rd.k. for 100 rd.sp.\n\nThe notes. The very first Danish paper money was the State notes of 1713. These notes bore six hand-written signatures. Four high officials and two clerks had to work through five months signing the first 120,000 notes (figure 1). The wording translated: \"After His Royal Majesty's most gracious Decree, dated the 8th of April year 1713, this note pass for Rigsdaler\". Notes for 1 mark (1/4 rd.) - 100 rigsdaler kurant were issued (fig. 7-11).\n\nThe next issue came from Kurantbanken, established as a joint stock company in 1737. All Danish bank notes since 1737 have been signed by officials from the bank. Notes for 1 rd.k. - 100 rd.k. were issued (fig. 12-26). The wording translated: \"The Bank in Copenhagen pays the Bearer on Demand the sum of ... Rigsdaler, in writing ... Rigsdaler courant currency. Until then this Banco-Note, as long as it exists, is valid without any certificate or endorsement for the above-mentioned ... Rigsdaler; value in bank received. Copenhagen Year ...\"\n\nFrom 1775 and onward the clause from the Law dealing with Counterfeiting was quoted with small letters on the note: \"Hvo som giør falske Banco-Sedler, straffes paa Ære, Liv og Gods; og den, der beviisligen angiver saadan en Falskner, nyder til Belønning Eet Tusind Rigsdaler, og Navnet forties\". Literally translated: \"Whoever makes forged Banco-Notes will be punished upon Honour, Life and Property; the person who demonstrably denounces such a forger will benefit by an award of one thousand Rigsdaler and the name will be kept secret\".\n\nSmall notes, 1 and 5 rd.k. were put in circulation 1762-75. A footnote, page 24-25, tells about the way different countries looks upon small notes. In 1773 the state took over the bank and from 1786 a new type of notes printed on blue paper was introduced. Today it may be difficult to distinguish the faded colour.\n\nThe value of the Kurantbank-Notes in proportion to silver species fluctuated and in 1791 it was attempted to replace them by notes with denominations in species (fig. 32-35) from a new bank, \"Speciebanken\". The experiment failed and new notes for 2 and for 20 rd.k. were issued from a new body Skatkammerfonden (The Treasury Fund) based on incomes from landtaxes (fig.37-38).\n\nDue to a shortage of bank notes in 1799 and again in 1806 the Copenhagen Chamber of Commerce issued Credit Notes (fig. 36).\n\nIn 1809-1810 it became necessary to print small notes for 8, 12 and 24 skilling (fig. 39-40). The wording, translated: \"Emitted for ... skilling on the basis of the Decree, dated ....\n\nDuring the war between Denmark and Sweden 1807-09, the Danish king, Frederik VI intended to invade the southern province of Skaane in Sweden. Skaane is a former Danish province and Frederik VI therefore decided that the invading army should pay for their requisitions from the civil inhabitants, and to that end notes in Danish and Swedish currency were printed. The invasion, however, was abandoned and the notes destroyed; only one set (crossed over, fig. 42-44) is to be seen in The Royal Collection of Coins and Medals in Copenhagen.\n\nIn 1807 it became impossible for Denmark to preserve her neutrality. The Danish state was compelled to participate on the French side in Napoleon's war against England. The war expenses were excessive and in 1812 the Danish government had to suspend the payment of interest and repayment of the foreign debt, a situation which continued until the payment was resumed in 1815. At home the government met the rising expenses by issuing more notes, with the result that eventually Denmark had to devalue the Kurant notes. In Danish literature this is often referred to as \"the State-Bankruptcy of 1813\".\n\nThe reorganisation of the Danish currency began with the foundation of a new bank, \"Rigsbanken\" to supersede Kurantbanken. The capital for the new bank came from a once-for-all levy imposed on all real property in Denmark equivalent to 6 per cent of the value of it. The owners could choose either to pay this amount in silver or to pay an interest at a rate of 6 1/2 per cent per annum, also in silver.\n\nA new unit was introduced, The \"Rigsbankdaler\" (rbd), equivalent to 1/2 rd.sp. The old notes were changed in proportion 6 rd.k. = 1 rbd, a devaluation which was ruinous to many people and many firms.\n\nThe public had no confidence in the new notes and would not receive them for the full value (table 5-6). The situation was not improved until a new bank completely independent of the government, \"Nationalbanken i Kjøbenhavn\" was founded in 1818. During the next 20 years Nationalbanken succeeded in reducing the superfluous amount of notes from the times of war into sufficient quantities. In 1838 they came at par and were made redeemable.\n\nWhen the Rigsbankdaler unit was introduced in 1813 it took a long time to print the new notes and so various temporary notes were issued (DOP 50-57). The first notes from Rigsbanken came in the autumn of 1814. They were rather primitive (DOP 58-62); the wording is rended as Legend 4, page 356. The notes from Nationalbanken in 1818 had almost the same wording, only the name of the bank was altered, Legend 5. They were printed on very thin paper.\n\nDuring the civil war against the German insurgents in Holsten in 1848 and against Germany and Austria in 1864 the Danish state had to issue interest-bearing credit notes to cover the war expenses. The same was done as a matter of precaution during the war between Germany and France in 1870 (DOP 73-85). In a footnote it is discussed whether interest-bearing credit notes are paper money or not.\n\nIn 1865 France, Italy, Belgium and Switzerland formed the Latin monetary convention. The Scandinavian countries contemplated joining this convention, but instead they united in the Scandinavian Monetary Union, in force from 1875 to 1923. The coins from Denmark, Norway, and Sweden were free to circulate all over Scandinavia, no matter where they were minted. The union was not extended to the notes as Nationalbanken was a body, independant of the State. For a short period, 1901-1905, the Scandinavian central banks made their notes interchangeable.\n\nWhen forming the union it was decided to leave the duodecimal system, the Rigsdaler and Skilling. It was decided to introduce the decimal system with 1 krone = 100 øre as the common coin in the three countries. Gold was chosen as the monetary standard.\n\nNew notes with the denomination in Kroner were issued. The smallest note was for 10 kr., but in 1898 a 5 kr. note was introduced. A footnote enumerates the smallest notes sent out from the note-issuing banks in 1897.\n\nThe Charter for the first Nationalbank expired in 1908, but was prolonged for 30 years with some alterations, i.e. the bank had to pay an annual fee of 750,000 kr. to the state for the right to issue notes. The sum corresponded to 6 per thousand of the yearly noteissue. A footnote compares this amount with the conditions in other countries. In this connection a Mexican note with a tax-stamp is illustrated in fig. 49.\n\nBefore the prolonged Charter terminated, the Danish Parliament, Rigsdagen, discussed a reorganization of this Charter. The Social Democratic Party wanted a State bank, but the majority voted for an independent, autonomous hank. In 1936 a new Charter was elaborated and the name was altered to \"Danmarks Nationalbank\".\n\nAfter World War II a currency reform was carried through on the 22nd of July 1945. This was done partly in order to make the illegally exported notes invalid and partly to discover fortunes concealed from the taxation authorities. Nationalbanken had printed new notes for this purpose during the war, but this printing was kept as a top secret until the last moment. A coupon from the ration card served as validation for the exchange (the coupon illustrated in fig. 51 belongs to a collector who renounced the 500 kr. which it represented so that he might keep it in his collection). The result of the currency reform was that 71 million kr. were not exchanged, a sum corresponding to about 6 per cent of the quantity of notes circulating. Fortunes to a total amount of 2,500 million kr. not hitherto taxed were discovered. This corresponds to 18 per cent of the fortunes declared. - The notes issued in Denmark before 1945 were hereafter obsolete and not redeemable.\n\nIn 1952 a new series was issued. The 5 kr. and the 10 kr. notes carried (somewhat misleading) only the ordinance date 7.4.1936. However, the year of printing is given implicitly in the serial number which consists of three parts: a capital letter + the first digit indicate the series, the next two digits are equal to the two last digits in the year of the printing, and the last digit plus the following letter show the position of the note on the printed sheet (the notes were printed in sheets of 42). To indicate the position of the note figures from 1 to 7 and the six letters A-F were used. This may be illustrated by an example: A 10 kr. note has the red serial number H 2632 E at the left and the red number 8735733 at the right. This means that the note is number 8735733 in the series H 2 printed in 1963 and placed as number 5 (=E) in the second column of the sheet. As a control the position specification 2 E is printed in very small types near the bottom at the right of each note.\n\nIf anything went wrong during the printing, a replacement sheet was used. On this sheet the last figure was 0 and the last letter for all the notes was J in stead of A-F (the correct position number still appears at the bottom at right). If only a single note was rejected, a replacement note with K instead of J was used. This, however, infrequently happened, Consequently, the numbers with K as the last letter, for instance B 7710 K, are very rare. The 1952 series is the only one in which replacement notes were used in Denmark and only a very few Danish collectors are interested in the J and K notes. The 1972 series has the same number system as that of the 1952 series, but replacement notes are not used. The last digit in the 1972-series numbers indicates the position on the paper web: 1, 2 or 3 for the smaller notes placed three side by side on the printing cylinder and 1 or 2 for the larger notes.\n\nThe design of the Danish notes has varied through the ages. The first ones were very primitive. In 1834 Professor Gustav F. Hetsch introduced the late classicism and the early romanticism, through himself and his pupils influencing the following 50 years' style in notes. French influence manifested itself about 1900, only the 50 kr. note from 1883 (DOP 100) was drawn by a German artist working in Copenhagen.\n\nIn 1908 Nationalbanken arranged a competition which was won by a Danish designer called Gerhard Heilmann. His draft in art nouveau style dominated the Danish notes for the next forty years.\n\nThe notes used for the currency reform in 1945 were manufactured in deep secrecy and it had not been possible for Nationalbanken to call in artistic assistance. In 1952 a new competition resulted in the very fine 1952 series. In 1972 the new printing-house made it possible for Danmarks Nationalbank to issue the fine and technically advanced 1972 series.\n\nThe Purchasing Power of the Notes\n\nThe first Danish notes in 1713 had a high purchasing value, 50 rigsdaler was a very satisfactory yearly income for a bailiff (foreman). Later on the prices were somewhat higher. In 1770 the salary for the clerks in Kurantbanken was 160 rd. per year. The superior personnel received yearly 350 rd. and the head cashier was paid 850 rd. per year. (100 rd. corresponded to 18 £).\n\nIn the course of the 19th century the prices rose slightly. At the beginning of this century the prices were still rather low, but after 1914 it was different. In table 8, page 53, the consumer prices in Denmark are quoted for the following items:\n\n1. Coarse rye-bread.\n\n2. White bread.\n\n3. Butter.\n\n4. Beef, first quality, Breast.\n\n5. Do. Outer leg.\n\n6. Pork, fresh. Ham without shank.\n\n7. Do. Chop without fat.\n\n8. Codfish.\n\n9. Potatoes.\n\n10. Eggs per score.\n\n11. Coffee.\n\n12. Confectionery (fancy cake).\n\n13. Tea in package.\n\n14. Granulated sugar.\n\n15. Whole milk.\n\n16. Beer (taxable).\n\n17. Cigarettes.\n\n18. Newspaper.\n\n19. Electricity per kilowatthour.\n\n20. Gas per cubicmeter.\n\n21. House rent per year for a flat with two rooms and no bath.\n\n22. Skilled workers hourly wage.\n\n23. Unskilled ditto.\n\nHeading for the rightmost columns:\n\nNumber of minuts work for an unskilled labour to aquire the mentioned amount.\n\nThe Catalogue\n\nRegister of Danish Official Paper Money 1713-1980 The catalogue begins with a table registering all official notes of Denmark.\n\nColumn 1: This table gives the number used in this catalogue, the DOP number.\n\nColumn 2: Denomination.\n\nColumn 3: The note was valid from ... to ...\n\nColumn 4: The total number of pieces printed.\n\nColumn 5: First and last year known.\n\nColumn 6: Figure number.\n\nColumn 7: Pick-number if any.\n\nColumn 8: Remarks.\n\nThe text for the groups in the table are as follows:\n\nDOP 1-6 At left the king's monogram, F4. Denomination handwritten.\n\nDOP 7-10 As DOP 1-6 but denomination printed. 6 signatures.\n\nDOP 11-14 As DOP 7-10. 5 signatures.\n\nDOP 15-18 Watermarks instead of monogram. 3 signatures.\n\nDOP 19-34 Notes from the Kurantbank.\n\nDOP 35-39 Notes from the Speciebank.\n\nDOP 40-44 Notes from the Copenhagen Chamber of Commerce.\n\nDOP 45-46 Treasury notes.\n\nDOP 47-49 Fractional notes from the Kurantbank.\n\nDOP 50-153 See below.\n\nThe notes issued between 1713 and 1813 (DOP 1-49) are illustrated in the chapter dealing with the first part of the history of Danish Paper Money, page 19-51.\n\nIllustrations and descriptions of Danish Offical Paper Money between 1813 and 1983\n\nAll the official notes issued in Denmark after the reorganisation of the Danish currency in 1813 are illustrated and described in this section. Each specimen is normally given a double page, the left normally showing the obverse, the reverser if any, and the watermark. The right page gives the description.\n\nIt is difficult to illustrate the watermarks clearly, so different ways have been used: sketching from old, worn notes, drawing from better items and photographing the notes in light from the back side. In some cases the forms from the paper manufacture have been preserved; they show that for the first Nationalbank-notes from 1819 the same watermarks as used earlier were employed with an addition of undulating lines. Later on an impression in the wire-mesh from a model was used. The watermarks in notes of comparatively recent date are reproduced from photos of the watermarked paper before printing.\n\nAll the descriptions are given in the same form with detailed specifications as follows (the Danish words in italics):\n\nThe head:\n\nThe denomination, first year.* The DOP number. Authority of issue. The Pick number. The name of the series.\n\n(*) First year the note is valid. Where practically some characteristic year is given instead. Sometimes a note is dated one or two years before it is valid. If so, that year may be indicated.\n\nAdministrative informations:\n\nUdstedt: Issued according to law ... or decree ... Sat i omløb: Put in circulation. Forrentet: Interest paid (For credit certificates and State Treasury notes only). Indløst: redeemed. Indkaldt: called in (Obsolete). Inddraget: withdrawed (Withdrawal).\n\nAppearance and design:\n\nFormat: Dimensions in millimeters. Forside: Obverse. Bagside: Reverse. Tegnet af: Drawn by.\n\nTechnique:\n\nPapir: Paper. Vandmærke: Watermark. Tryk: Printing.\n\nCharacteristics:\n\nBlindstempel: Embossment stamp. Seriebetegnelse: Serial number. (Ingen: none). Nummer: Number. (Håndskrevet: handwritten). Underskrift: Signature. Kendte årstal: Years known. Bemærkninger. Remarks.\n\nNB. The legends on the notes together with a literal translation is to be found at page 355-365.\n\nThe notes 1813-1875 (DOP 50-93)\n\nTo the different groups in the catalogue a few comments may be useful:\n\nDOP 50-52. Provisional cash orders from the \"Rigsbanken\", payable after 12 months.\n\nDOP 53-54. Provisional cash orders from the Treasury, payable after 3 rnonths. No copies are known. The figure number 54 is reserved in case a note should emerge.\n\nDOP 55-57. Notes from the Copenhagen Chamber of Commerce.\n\nDOP 58-62. Notes from Rigsbanken.\n\nDOP 63-67. Notes from Nationalbanken 1819.\n\nDOP 68-72. The 1834-series. In order to make the notes more secure against forgery, a new series was started in 1834, using a combination of Copper- and letterpress-printing. The notes were drawn by Gustav F. Hetsch, an architect from Stuttgart, who settled in Copenhagen in 1815 as a professor at the Academy. The 1834-series I introduced the (single-) colour notes in Denmark. The series comprises the following:\n\nDOP 68. Obverse blue. Reverse white (blank).\n\nDOP 69. Obverse brown. Reverse white (blank). The notes were frequently faked so a new 1834-series II was issued with printed reverse.\n\nDOP 70. Obverse green. Reverse: black copperplate print on white ground.\n\nDOP 71. As DOP 69, but with a reverse carrying a brown relief pattern.\n\nDOP 72. Obverse and reverse brown.\n\nDOP 73-85. Interest-bearing credit certificates from the Treasury. The paper for these certificates came from an old lot kept in stock in Nationalbanken. That is the reason why paper with watermarks showing the monogram of Frederik the Sixth is used after the king's death in 1839. The three series comprise the following:\n\nDOP 73a with a grey ground and 73b and 73c with a blue ground were redeemed by drawing lot, using the note's \"Hoved No.\".\n\nDOP 73a with a grey ground and 73b and 73c with a blue ground were redeemed by draw, using the note's \"Hoved No.\".\n\nDOP 76 and 79 has a blue, DOP 77 and 80 a yellow and DOP 78 and 81 a red ground. DOP 82 has a light green ground. Figure 76a shows a finished certificate with number and signatures for registration and counter signature.\n\nDOP 83 has a yellow ground with a yellow frame. DOP 84 and 85 have the same form as DOP 83, the colours are red and green respectively.\n\nDOP 86-93. Between 1860 and 1876 new notes with the name Rigsdaler instead of Rigsbankdaler were printed. It is to be noted that \"Rigsdaler\" after 1854 is equal to \"Rigsbankdaler\" and equal only to the half of the \"Rigsdaler specie\" before 1813. The three units are abbreviated rdlr., rbd. and rd.sp.\n\nThere were a few other alterations. From about 1871 the numbers were no longer handwritten but printed. The notes in this series are:\n\nDOP 86 and 88. Obverse black with a blue frame. Reverse blank.\n\nDOP 87 and 89. Obverse yellow with a brown frame. Reverse brown.\n\nDOP 90 similar to DOP 70 with a few alterations.\n\nDOP 91 and 92 as DOP 71 with a few alterations.\n\nDOP 93 similar to DOP 72 with a few alterations. lt may seem strange that so many alterations were made a few years before the change to a new money unit took place, but one must bear in mind that the decision whether Denmark should retain the duodecimal system with rigsdaler = 96 skilling or introduce the decimal system with 1 krone = 100 øre, was not made until 1875.\n\nThe notes 1875-1945 (DOP 94-127)\n\nIn 1875 new notes with the denomination in kroner were issued. The notes, DOP 94-97, carried two signatures, one printed and one handwritten.\n\nDOP 94. Obverse blue. Reverse blank. The shield is supported by Minerva and Ceres.\n\nDOP 95. Obverse and reverse blue. Obverse frame identical to the one used for DOP 70.\n\nDOP 96. Obverse and reverse blue. The obverse carries two vignettes: Mercury and Vulcan.\n\nDOP 97. Gray-blue. The appearance of the obverse is similar to that of DOP 72, but totally redesigned. The heads in the vignettes at the obverse are Mercury and Neptune. The reverse shows in relief engraving the Danish sculptor Thorvaldsen at the left and the Danish physicist H. C. Ørsted at the right.\n\nDOP 98. Blue-gray. In order to protect against counterfeiting the obverse was rifled with fine vertical lines. This technique was very difficult to carry out. Hence the experiment was abandoned in the next issue (DOP 102).\n\nDOP 99. Black on brown. The watermarks show Minerva and Vulcan. On the reverse side ten contemporary 1 kr. coins are depicted.\n\nThe note was heavily criticised; it was called Denmark's most hideous bank note and the Danish Society of Fine Arts arranged a competition for a better design. Several distinguished artists sent in proposals, but the bank preferred the original draft as better in safety-graphics.\n\nIt is interesting to find that this note was drawn by the same artist (Nilaus Fristrup, teacher at the Danish Academy of Fine Arts) who drew the reverse to DOP 97, one of Denmark's most beautiful and must worthy bank notes.\n\nDOP 100. Violet. The female figure at the left symbolizes Denmark.\n\nDOP 101. Green. The two female figures at the reverse symbolize shipping trade and agriculture.\n\nDOP 102-105. New watermarks.\n\nDOP 106-109. State Treasury Notes from the first year of World War I. The Minister of Finance and the National Debt Director have signed the notes. The table at the reverse shows the rate of interest. DOP 106. Figure 100a shows a Treasury note from 1914, which has been put in circulation. It was cashed in 1951 and paid according to the face value.\n\nDOP 110-112. 1 kr. notes issued during World War I because of a change shortage.\n\nDOP 110. Black on redbrown paper. In the arms, Iceland is represented by a dried cod. This symbol had, however, in 1903 been replaced by a falcon. The error was corrected in the next impression, DOP 111.\n\nDOP 112. Blue on a green guilloche pattern.\n\n(A 2 kr. note was printed, but not put in circulation. The issue was destroyed).\n\nDOP 113-127. Between 1910 and1939 three series were issued with the same drawing for the same denomination, but with varying inscriptions. See Legends 10, 15, 16 and 17.\n\nDOP 113, 118, 123. Blue. Obverse: Landscape with cairn.\n\nDOP 114, 119, 124. Brown. Head of Mercury on reverse.\n\nDOP 115, 120, 125. Blue. Obverse: Fishermen with boat and net.\n\nDOP 116, 121, 126. Brown. Reverse: Arms with shield bearers. Pick refers to them as \"Sea-Gods with shell-trumpets\". That is a good description, but they could just as well be the same two wildmen with bludgeons as shown on the reverse of DOP 110.\n\nDOP 117, 122, 127. Dark blue. Obverse: Ploughman with team of two horses.\n\nCurrency reform 1945\n\nThe new series from DOP 130 was rather similar to the preceding series, but the colours were different. The reverses all carried Danish arms. DOP 128-129 were nicknamed \"Matador-sedler\" because they looked like the notes\" used in the game \"Matador\" (\"Monopoly\").\n\nDOP 128 Blue (128a Letterpress print, 128b Offset).\n\nDOP 129 Brown.\n\nDOP 130 Green. DOP 131 similar, but V-m. altered.\n\nDOP 132 Dark violet. DOP 133 Violet.\n\nDOP 134 Dark green. DOP 135 Olive-green.\n\nDOP 136 Orange.\n\nThe 1952-series\n\nThe obverses carry portraits of famous Danes. On the reverses are vignettes drawn by the Danish artist Ib Andersen.\n\nDOP 137. Blue-green. Obverse: The sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen, and his work \"The three Graces\". Reverse: The town of Kalundborg.\n\nDOP 138. Similar to DOP 137, but figures in Vm. 13 mm instead of 11 mm.\n\nDOP 139. Light brown. Obverse: The poet Hans Christian Andersen and a stork's nest in a treetop. Reverse: Landscape with a mill. - This note had the same dimensions as the 5 krone note. Blind persons complained, so the size was altered. The new note is found in three types with different forms for Vm and for the bands on the upper and lower border on the reverse:\n\nDOP 140. Vm 11 mm high. The bands begin with 10.\n\nDOP 141. Vm 14 mm high. The bands begin with 10.\n\nDOP 142. Vm 14 mm high. The bands begin with \"Ti\".\n\nDOP 143. Blue. Obverse: The astronomer Ole Rømer (1644-1710) and The Round Tower in Copenhagen, used as observatory 1656-1858. Reverse: A cairn in Jutland. The note was printed on handmade paper. Vm: Crowns.\n\nDOP 144. Similar to DOP 143, but printed on machine-made paper. Vm: lines and denomination 50.\n\nDOP 145. Pink. Obverse: The physicist H. C. Ørsted. A compass above shows his demonstration in 1820 of the magnetic effect of an electric current. Reverse: A vignette of the Castle of Kronborg in Elsinore. Printed on handmade paper. Vm.: Wavy lines, compass-card at right.\n\nDOP 146. Similar to DOP 145, but printed on machine-made paper. Vm.: 100-numbers.\n\nDOP 147. Green and darkblue. Obverse: The Danish Prime Minister Reventlow (1748-1827). Reverse: A vignette of the cathedral in Roskilde town in last century.\n\nThe 1972-series\n\nThe obverses have portraits painted by the Danish artist Jens Juel (1745-1802). Animals on the reverses were drawn by Johannes Larsen (10 kr.), Gunnar Andersen (20 kr.), and Ib Andersen (50, 100, 500 and 1000 kr.).\n\nDOP 148. Yellow. Obverse: Mrs. Kirchhoff. Reverse: Eider.\n\nDOP 149. Brown. Obverse: Mrs. Tutein. Reverse: Sparrows.\n\nDOP 150. Blue. Obverse: Mrs. Ryberg. Reverse: Carp.\n\nDOP 151. Red. Obverse: Jens Juel (self-portrait). Reverse: The butterfly Red Underwing (Catocala nupta). Linnaeus, 1758).\n\nDOP 152. Green. Obverse: Unknown lady. Reverse: Lizard.\n\nDOP 153. Grey. Mrs. Thomasine Heiberg. Reverse: Squirrel.\n\nThe watermarks for this series are as follows:\n\nDOP 148, 150, 151 and 152. The painter Jens Juel. Denominations.\n\nDOP 149. Palette and brushes. 20.\n\nDOP 153. Jens Juel and his wife. 1000.\n\nThe artists and the engravers\n\nIt is not possible with certainty to establish the name of the designers of all the notes before 1912. Different records in the archive in the Danish Nationalbank and elsewhere indicate, however, that the names given in the description of the notes are correct.\n\nWith a few exceptions the name of the engraver is not known.\n\nIt has always been a rule in the Danish note design that neither the artist nor the engraver sign their works. Nethertheless the following exemptions have been found.\n\nThe engraver P. C. Batz has put his name BATZ in microtypes on three notes:\n\n5 rigsdaler (DOP 86 and 88). On the shaft of the trident of Neptune.\n\n10 rigsdaler (DOP 87 and 89). Hidden in the dot under the o in No in the number-field at the bottom.\n\n10 kroner 1875 (DOP 94). On the base under the feet of Ceres in the vignette at the top.\n\nThe engraver W. FERSLEW, known from the first Danish stamp, has put his name on the 20 rigsbankdaler (DOP 70 and 90) in microtypes within the slanting down stroke of the N in No. in the number-field at the bottom.\n\nThe artist Gerhard Heilmann has drawn his initials within the pattern on the 10, 100, and 500 kr. notes in the three Heilmann series:\n\n10 kroner (DOP 114,119 and 124). In the ground on the reverser to the right of the upper heart in the right, lower part of the note.\n\n100 kroner (DOP 116, 121 and 126). On the reverse in the lowest corner at right.\n\n500 kroner (DOP 117, 122, 127 and 136). In the grass in the lower right corner of the semicircular field at the obverse.\n\nData and series numbers\n\nAbout 1900 the numbering had 7 digits. In order to allow for higher production capital letters were added. The first series is usually without letter (u/ Bogst.) and the next one has A or A1 in front of the series number, etc.\n\nThe list, page 266-269, contains date and series numbers for the Danish notes between 1910 and 1983. Down to the year 1953 the list is based upon numbers collected by the group and some shortcomings may occur. After 1953 the list rests on information from Danmarks Nationalbank.\n\nSignatures\n\nUntil 1875 all the signatures on the banknotes were handwritten. Between 1875 and 1910 the notes had two signatures, the one to the left printed, the other handwritten. After 1910 all the signatures were printed.\n\nBefore 1860 the banknotes carried 3 signatures; for notes with high denominations (50 and 100 rbd.) those of a director, a cashier and a book-keeper. Since 1875 the banknotes carries two signatures; one of them (1875-1950 the left one and thereafter the right one) is that of the chief of the bank's notedepartment. The other signer was - between 1875 and 1952 - one of the eldest of the head clerks. After 1952 the signer at left is a director; three members of the direction alternate after a fixed scheme. Lists containing the name and the (final) position of the signatories are given and a list of the directors of the Nationalbank from the first year and down to 1980 is added.\n\nThe Production, Circulation and Withdrawal of the Notes - Counterfeiting\n\nThe Paper for the Notes\n\nThe paper used for Danish notes was handmade until 1957. From 1713 to 1873 the paper was manufactured at a papermill, \"Strandmøllen\", north of Copenhagen; this papermill was owned by the same family, Drewsen, for 200 years. To get the order for the paper the owner and his workers had to be sworn in, now serving the bank.\n\nThe paper for the new Krone notes in 1875 was delivered from the Swedish State Papermill in Tumba, near Stockholm. It had produced the paper for the official Swedish notes from 1755 and is still doing so. Tumba delivered the paper for the Danish notes until 1906. From 1907 to 1972 the paper for the official Danish notes was again fabricated in Denmark (at Silkeborg in Jutland). In 1957-62 machinemade paper was introduced. The 50 kr. and 100 kr. note from these years exist in two types, the first one on handmade paper, the second on machine-made paper.\n\nA paper with a complicated watermark containing both light and dark parties was specified for the new Danish notes in 1972. The Danish firms were unable to make this paper in their machinery. The order was given to the English firm Portals Ltd., the world's largest manufacturer of cylinder mould made security paper for banknotes. Founded in 1712, Portals has supplied the paper for the Bank of England Notes since 1724 and now the firm produces mould made paper for printing 10,000 million bank notes for 130 countries every year.\n\nSince 1972, the Danish firms have experimented with developments in their machinery at Silkeborg and in 1979 they succeeded in manufacturing paper with a simplified watermark for the new 20 kr. note (DOP 149).\n\nPrinting of the notes\n\nThe first notes were print,-d by a private printing firm outside the bank. From 1831 to 1908 the notes were printed by a Danish printing firm, H. H. Thiele, in cooperation with Nationalbanken. After 1908 all the printing was done by the bank.\n\nTechnical innovations have always introduced rather rapidly in the Danish bank. In 1844 a galvanic apparatus was purchased and in 1845 the reverse of the 100 rbd. note (DOP 72) was printed with a mechanically relief engraved copperplate. The cost of production for a note in Denmark in the 19th century was 3 3/4 øre (approx. 1/2 d). A third of this price was paid for the handwritten signature and the numbering.\n\nThe Danish notes were printed in sheets until 1972 when Nationalbanken installed two rotary presses in the new printing-house. One was from the West-German factory, Goebel, in Darmstadt, the other from Masson Scott Thrissell Engineering Ltd. in Bristol.\n\nThe procurement of rotary presses was necessitated by the quickly increasing number of notes in Denmark. In 1875 the consumption was 1 million notes yearly, in 1900 7 million in 1935 25 million, in 1972 75 million and in 1978 140 million yearly.\n\nThe cost of production before World War II was the same as in the previous century: 3 3/4 øre, but after 1945 the price went up and in 1980 the cost of production for a note was 15 øre (approx. 1 p). That was the reason why a 10 kr. note, lasting only 9 months was replaced by a 10 kr. coin, costing 50 øre but usable for many years. In 1983 a 100 kr. note costs approx. 50 øre.\n\nCirculation of the Notes\n\nEver since the first notes were put in circulation in Denmark the authorities have kept an exact account of the circulation. The result appears in the tables 18-21 in the annex. The value of the circulating notes calculated in kroner per inhabitant has risen continuously and has now reached a large figure. In the graph, figure 168, the circulating amount in kroner per inhabitant (dotted) is compared with the consumer price index (full line). It will be seen that the two curves have practically the same gradients.\n\nAn interesting picture of the value of notes in circulation is obtained in figure 169 by a comparison with the gross domestic product at factor cost. The ordinate in this graph gives the value of the circulating notes as per cent of the domestic product. In 1820 the circulation was far too great - 22,5 per cent! - owing to the excessive emissions during the war 1807-1814. It was gradually reduced to a sensible amount and from 1870 to 1960 the value fluctuated between 6 and 7 per cent (apart from a brief rise during World War II), but in 1960 the curve began to drop. The decline continued during the following years and in 1978 the value was only 3,6 per cent. This development is probably due to the fact that many money transactions are now settled by cheques and post office transfers.\n\nThe distribution of the circulation upon the individual denominations is shown in table 22 and figure 170. It will be seen that the 10 kr. and the 100 kr. notes are those most frequently used.\n\nIn order to compare the circulation in Denmark with the circulation in other countries, the state of affairs in 1935, one of the more stable years between the two wars, has been examined (table 23). The difference between the ten countries is not very large; converted to U.S. dollars the average is 45 U.S.dollars, Switzerland twice as much, and Denmark the half.\n\nWithdrawal and Destruction\n\nWhen a note was to be withdrawn in the 18th century the absolute monarch issued a solemn decree which was recited in the churches before service. Today a short note from the Minister of Commerce or Economy is sufficient.\n\nIn Denmark the notes have always been destroyed immediately after they were withdrawn. It is impossible to find old Danish notes cancelled with punched holes or by other means. Before 1908 the obsolete notes were burned. Between 1908 and 1914 a rather expensive chemical method was used. From 1914 to 1950 the cancelled notes were ground. Between 1950 and 1970 they were burned, but after 1970 a special form for grinding has been employed.\n\nCounterfeiting\n\nIt was easy to forge the first Danish notes and it was often done. The denomination was dispensed with and a new and higher denomination was entered - or the whole note was counterfeited. In 1758 it was discovered that a Norwegian factory owner and his director had produced 500 forged 100 rd. notes from 1748 (DOP 27). There were 121 of these Danish-Norwegian notes in circulation. The remainder was found with the counterfeit outfit when the two men were arrested. Both were condemned to death and were decapitated on the scaffold behind the town hall in Copenhagen.\n\nFrom 1767 to 1777 a gang in Jutland counterfeited the 10, 50 and 100 rd. notes. Eventually the criminals were captured and the Danish Supreme Court approved according to the law, a death sentence for the three leaders. The death sentence was appealed to the king who decided that only one of the, three men should be executed. Which of them was to be determined by a throw of the dice as provided in the military penal code for similar cases. Consequently a game of dice between the three men was organized at the place of execution outside the town wall. Immediately after the game was ended the loser was decapitated and the two others put in jail for life.\n\nIn 1793-1794 a merchant from Danzig, Nicolaus Fischer, counterfeited the Danish 5 rd.k. notes (DOP 29). He was captured in Jutland and the Danish Supreme Court approved a sentence of amputation of the right hand. The king altered this sentence to prison, but when Nicolaus Fischer escaped from the jail and was captured again, he was transported to the Danish colony of Trankebar in India. Some of the notes that Fischer forged still exist in the KM, PM, RA and in a few private collections.\n\nIn 1819 the police captured all the members of a gang of counterfeiters who worked all over Denmark. The punishments were severe. Eleven of the criminals were whipped and afterwards imprisoned for life. 23 were put in jail for life and 15 were imprisoned for a shorter time.\n\nIn the following years counterfeiting was continued on a smaller scale. The Nationalbanken paid the recipients of the forged notes full compensation even if the bank was not juridically bound to do so; the expenses were small, in the years 1825-1845 about 1600 rbd. yearly.\n\nDuring the trial in 1883 against a businessman who had counterfeited the 100 kr. note from 1875 (DOP 96), the experts from Nationalbanken doubted the prisoner's assertion that he had carved the printing block without any assistance. The business man was given a boxtree-block and demonstrated that he was able to do it himself. In the Police Museum, an impression of the printing block is kept showing how extremely clever the imitation was.\n\nIn New York two Swedish criminals, I. Moberg and J. A. Skog, tried to forge different European notes at the beginning of this century. They manufactured the paper for the notes in the good old way as hand-made paper with the proper watermarks and then printed the notes by means of printing blocks. The crime was discovered by chance; two stockbrokers from New York happened to discuss the remarkable coincidence that both of them had received a fairly high quantity of Danish 50 kr. notes on the same day. Secret Service was informed and discovered the counterfeiting workshop. When the police arrived, J. A. Skog who was armed with a revolver tried to escape. He did not succeed in this and shot himself. I. Moberg was severely ill at that time and got off with a short imprisonment. In figure 173 the Danish 50 kr. note from 1883 and a 20 pound note from the Bank of Scotland (Pick SA 4) can be seen together with other unidentified notes. Two years later the Danish 10 kr. note from 1891 was forged in Copenhagen. A lithographer and a lithographic printer manufactured some 2,200 forged notes and the lithographer's father-in-law, a tailor, put them in circulation. The forgery was discovered, when the tailor in a shop paid with five notes carrying the same number.\n\nA comical touch was added to the serious crime through the tailor's drinking-orgies at the pubs where he was nicknamed the \"Champagne-Tailor\" as shown in a drawing from the Danish satirical yearbook \"Blæksprutten\" (The Cuttle Fish), figure 175.\n\nLater on other criminals tried to counterfeit the Danish notes without success. It is difficult to forge the modern Danish notes. Banks are very watchful, so counterfeiting has not as yet been a problem in Denmark. Nationalbanken, however, is still on guard against forgeries and attempts to prevent this crime through continuous advances in safetygraphics and security printing.\n\nThe Annex (\"Bilag\")\n\nDanish Legislation Refering to Banknotes\n\nA short selection of the relevant laws is given, divided in four parts: A. New notes. B. Withdrawal. C. Prohibition and penalty clauses. D. The current law from 1936.\n\nIn Denmark the law provided capital punishment for imitation or counterfeit until 1840. Between 1840 and 1860 the punishment was from 6 to 16 years imprisonment, and later on 12 years. The same punishment was meted out to anybody who, with the intent of bringing the imitated or counterfeited notes in circulation as genuine, provides himself or others with such notes. The penalty range also applies to the person who distributes the notes.\n\nThe penalty for the person who passes money he has reasons to believe is not genuine, will be imprisoned up to 3 years. If the person has received the money bona fide his penalty may be reduced to a fine or - if there are extenuating circumstances - annulled.\n\nThe law also prohibits manufacture, import or distribution of objects having essential likenesses to money. Infringement is punished with a fine. Fines have been imposed in connection with some advertising prints imitating notes.\n\nReproduction of banknotes. According to the Danish law of Rights of Origin for Literary and Artistic Works, Danmarks Nationalbank has exclusive copyright to the notes. That means that reproduction is normally prohibited. In certain cases, for instance in this book, a special permission may be obtained from Danmarks Nationalbank to reproduce the notes in reduced size.\n\nThe Tables\n\nTable 1.
