        "text": "What is the currency in Norway?\n\nThe official currency in Norway is the Norwegian Krone, which is issued and overseen by the Norges Bank. If you’re buying your travel money online you may also see the official code being shown - NOK. In stores and restaurants, Norwegian Krone prices are likely to use the currency symbol kr.\n\nOnce you’re in Norway you’ll see costs of items shown in NOK and you’ll need to start paying for things in local coins and notes which are often found in the following denominations:\n\nbanknotes - 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 NOK and coins - 1, 5, 10, 20 NOK.\n\nCan you officially pay in NZD when you are in Norway?\n\nYou’re unlikely to be able to officially transact in NZD in Norway, which is why it’s time to start getting used to NOK and learning more about the currency exchange rates so you’ll know what you’re spending on your trip.\n\nThis guide will walk through all you need to know, including US dollar/Norwegian Krone rates and where best to get your travel money from.\n\nNorwegian KroneCurrency nameNorwegian KroneISO codeNOKSymbolkrSubunitØreCentral BankNorges BankBest travel cards to take to NorwayWise\n\nNOK coins and banknotes\n\nHere’s a full rundown of the NOK coins and banknotes you’ll need to be familiar with when you’re in Norway.\n\nNOK banknotesNOK coinsbanknotes - 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 NOKcoins - 1, 5, 10, 20 NOK\n\nHistory of Norwegian Krone currency\n\nThe Norwegian Krone (NOK) was introduced in 1875, replacing the Norwegian speciedaler as Norway joined the Scandinavian Monetary Union. Although the union dissolved in 1914, Norway retained the krone, which has been a floating currency since 1992.\n\nIs NZD accepted in Norway?\n\nAs we’ve seen, the official currency in Norway is NOK. If you carry NZD with you on your trip, you’ll probably need to exchange it before you can spend.\n\nSometimes when you’re away on a trip abroad you’ll find that merchants will take payments in a selection of major foreign currencies. However, the chances are that where this is offered, you won’t get a good exchange rate for your NZD. Planning smart and convenient ways to spend in NOK when you’re away is likely to mean you save on costs in the end.\n\nUsually, having a few different ways to pay and get cash is the best option for travelers and tourists. That’s because you’ll have a back up plan in case one payment method isn’t accepted for any reason, and you can pick the method that’s best suited to the specific transaction. Having a multi-currency card from a provider like Wise, plus your normal bank debit card, and some local cash in NOK should mean you’ve always got options. You can use your cash for small purchases and tipping, and make low cost payments and cash withdrawals with your multi-currency card, while keeping your bank card in reserve for emergencies.\n\nUse a travel card on your next trip to Norway\n\nUsing a travel debit card in Norway is usually cheap, safe and convenient. A few providers in NZD offer multi-currency cards which come with a linked payment account that lets you convert, hold and spend in NOK. That allows you to add a balance in NZD and switch over to NOK to lock in the exchange rate and set your travel budget.\n\nOnce you have NOK in your account there are no extra fees to make payments, and you’ll not have foreign transaction charges to worry about, either.\n\nHere’s a quick overview of a couple of handy travel debit cards you may want to order and use in Norway.\n\nWhat is the currency exchange rate for NZ$ 1 NZD/NOK?\n\nIt’s helpful to get to know the live NZD/NOK rate so you can easily calculate how much things are costing you while you’re on your trip abroad. The rate you need to focus on is the mid market rate, which is the one banks and major currency services get when buying and selling currencies. This rate isn’t always passed on to customers. Instead you may find that the NZD/NOK rate you get when exchanging travel cash includes a markup - an extra fee.\n\nFind the NZD/NOK mid-market rate from a currency conversion site or a website like this, so you can keep an eye on the market and compare the rates you’re offered as you travel against the mid-market rate easily. Right now, the mid-market rate for 1 NZD to NOK is 0.55173.\n\nShould I exchange NZD to NOK before traveling to Norway?\n\nBecause Norway sees many tourists from New Zealand every year you might find you’re better off if you exchange your currency when you get to Norway rather than worrying about getting your cash sorted out before you leave.\n\nGet familiar with the exchange rates offered locally to you, and online, so you can decide whether it’s worth switching some funds in advance of travel, using a card to pay while you’re away, or converting cash on arrival. Both in New Zealand and in Norway, steer clear of exchanging currency at the airport. A captive market means that NZD/NOK rates are often worse in the airport than in city centers.\n\nTips for exchanging money in Norway\n\nThere’s a good network of ATMs across Norway, and card payments are also widely accepted. Always pay in NZD to avoid sneaky extra dynamic currency conversion costs and to make sure your money goes further.\n\nAvoid using exchange providers at airports or hotels in Norway as they usually offer pretty poor exchange rates because they have a captive market and little competition nearby\n\nToday’s mid market exchange rate for NZD/NOK is 0.55173 - look for this or as close as possible to it when you exchange your travel money\n\nUse a travel debit card like the Wise card while you’re in Norway for fast and cheap conversion between currencies and easy ways to manage your money from your phone\n\nBest place to exchange currency in Norway\n\nYou can get your NOK in Norway in a couple of ways.\n\nYou’ll be able to use a travel debit card from a provider like Wise to make convenient payments and cash withdrawals and to convert funds online.\n\nOr if you prefer an offline solution you can carry some cash in NZD to exchange when you arrive. Currency exchange providers are often in airports and hotels, although the exchange shops in a city center are likely to be cheaper overall.\n\nHow to pay in Norway?\n\nYou’ll need to have NOK to spend in Norway. However, generally having a few different payment methods is a good plan. That means that if a merchant won't accept one, you’ve got a back up. It’s also reassuring to know you have a different way to pay if you were unlucky enough to have a card or some travel cash stolen. Here are your key payment options in Norway.\n\n1. Debit or credit card\n\nCard payments can be helpful in shops, restaurants and hotels but there will be places where cash is also important. Order a travel card from a provider like Wise for cheap and fast transactions, including card payments and cash withdrawals as and when you need travel money in NOK.\n\n2. NOK cash\n\nCash is widely used in Norway, so it’s worth having some with you at all times. You may want to exchange money to NOK before you leave, but it’s also usually convenient to make ATM withdrawals locally once you arrive in Norway.\n\nYou’ll usually find you can use a card to make payments in Norway, but carrying some cash in NOK is also reassuring. It’s often easier for tipping and making smaller purchases, plus you’ve got a nice backup if your card is ever out of action for some reason.\n\nIt’s a smart idea to have both a card and some cash in NOK when you’re in Norway. Some merchants will prefer cash, but having a card for higher value payments and in busier more tourist places is also convenient. Consider using a travel card from a provider like Wise or Revolut alongside your cash for flexibility.\n\nPaying for the trip in NZD\n\nIf you’re paying for things in Norway with a NZD bank card you might find a foreign transaction fee is added. This pushes up your costs when you spend in a foreign currency, and can be tricky to calculate.\n\nTravel debit cards don’t always work this way. When you make purchases in Norway using the Wise card you can either choose to convert your account balance to NOK in advance in the Wise app, or just leave your balance in NZD and let the card handle the transaction when you pay. You’ll always get the lowest available fee and there are no extra foreign transaction charges.\n\nConclusion - Currency in Norway\n\nYou won’t be able to pay in NZD when you visit Norway - so learning about the currency you need is essential. Whether you decide to use a travel debit card from a service like Wise , or stock up on NOK in cash in advance, knowing the mid-market exchange rate can help you get the best available deal.
