        "text": "Krone/Kroner/Krona is a Nordic translation of the Latin word ‘Corona’ which means Crown. This has been the name for multiple historic currencies in Scandinavia.\n\nCurrently, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Iceland all use a form of this word as their currencies name. There is also a variation, Koruna, which is the name of the currency of the Czech Republic.\n\nBelow we’ll take a look at the five currencies who share the name Kroner.\n\nThe Koruna has been the name of multiple Czech currencies. The current iteration was introduced in 1994 following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. The currency was originally named after the crowns worn by Bohemian kings.\n\nYou can read more on our dedicated CZK currency profile.\n\nThe Danish Krone is the official currency of Denmark, as well as the territories of Greenland and the Faroe Islands. The Krone was introduced in 1875, replacing the former Danish currency, the rigsdaler.\n\nYou can read more on our dedicated DKK currency profile.\n\nFor a long time, Iceland was a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Therefore its currency was the Danish Krone. When Denmark took part in the Scandinavian Monetary Union, so did Iceland.\n\nThe Scandinavian Monetary Union was dissolved at a similar time to the granting of Icelandic independence and therefore Iceland chose to introduce its own currency.\n\nKrónur is the Icelandic variation of the Danish word Krone.\n\nThe currency was devalued in 1981, leading many academics to start referring to today’s currency as the ‘second Krónur.’ The currency is managed and issued by the ‘Seðlabanki Íslands’ or in English, the Central Bank of Iceland, which is based in the capital Reykjavik.\n\nLike its other Scandinavian neighbours, Sweden also uses a Krona. The first Swedish coins were minted in the 13th century but it wasn’t until 1873 that a decimal system was introduced, with 100 ore to the Krona.\n\nYou can read more on our dedicated SEK currency profile."
