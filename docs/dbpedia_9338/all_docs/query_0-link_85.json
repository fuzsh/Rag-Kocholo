Norway had a union with Denmark from 1380 until 1814. A Union was then formed with Sweden from 1814 and in 1905 Norway gained its independence from Sweden. Norway was occupied by German forces from April 9, 1940 and remained under German control until May 8, 1945.\n\nNorway first followed the Danish monetary system using the Danish riksdaler courant as the medium of exchange and the gold krone as the unit of account. In Norway the riksdaler was divided into four \"ort\" or ninety-six \"skilling\". After forming the union with Denmark, Norway adopted the speciedaler as its primary unit of account. One speciesdaler was divided into 5 ort or 120 skilling.\n\nIn 1814 when Norway and Sweden formed their union, the Swedish had already both coins and paper money circulating in Norway. There were two separate Swedish currencies circulating concurrently in Norway. The Swedish paper money currency was known as the \"paper riksdaler\" and was divisible into \"kopparmynt dalers\", \"kopparmynt marks\" and \"kopparmynt øre\". The Swedish coin currency known as the \"riksdaler specie\" was divided into 48 skilling or 92 øre. The values of the coin and paper currencies fluctuated greatly against one another and over issue of the paper currency led to its steady depreciation.\n\nThe currency was reformed in 1855 and the paper Riksdaler and Riksmynt was introduced and made legal tender. The new currency was divisible into 100 øre. Both silver and gold coins were minted in the new currency.\n\nIn 1875 the Swedish krone replaced the Riksdaler Riksmynt when Norway joined the Scandinavian Monetary Union which had been establish two years earlier by Denmark and Sweden.\n\nScandinavian Monetary UnionThe Scandinavian Monetary Union was a monetary union formed by Denmark and Sweden on 5 May 1873 by fixing the value of their currencies to where one krone was equal to 0.403 grams of fine gold or (2,480 Kroner = 1 kilogram of gold), making the value of both nations currencies at par with one another. Norway entered the union two years later, in 1875 by pegging the value of its currency to gold at the same level as Sweden and Denmark.\n\nAll three member countries continued to issue their own separate currencies and the coins of Sweden and Denmark were legal tender in Norway. Banknotes of one country however were not legal tender in another member's country but due to the perceived security of this union, many of each member's banknotes circulated throughout the entire area of the union and were accepted on the basis of \"as good as legal tender\".\n\nIn 1905 the political union between Norway and Sweden was dissolved, this however did not affect the monetary union between the three member countries. In 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, Sweden decided to abandon the gold standard and without a fixed exchange rate the monetary union came to an end.\n\nNorwegian currency today\n\nStill working on it...\n\nNorwegian paper money\n\nStill working on it...\n\nOne and Two Kroner BanknotesStill working on it...\n\nGovernment in exile issues \"London Issues\"Still working on it...\n\nHistorical exchange rates\n\nThe table below gives the average yearly exchange rates of the Norwegian krone from 1948 through to 2006.
