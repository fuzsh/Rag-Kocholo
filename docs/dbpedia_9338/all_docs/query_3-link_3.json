        "text": "Accommodation\n\nAccording to travel search site Momondo, searches made by global visitors on its site show that the average price per night for a hotel room is NOK 1,725. The prices can vary greatly according to season, location, comfort level, and the facilities available.\n\nHiking cabins run by the Norwegian Trekking Association (DNT) are available from NOK 400–1,600 per night per person.\n\nCabin rental rates may vary greatly according to the season and the size and standard of a cabin. A basic cabin at a camp site might start at NOK 500.\n\nCash\n\nDebit and credit cards are accepted almost everywhere, and many places also accept payment by phone, like Google Pay and Apple Pay. But it is still a good idea to have a bit of cash on you for small purchases. Foreign currency is rarely accepted, so you need Norwegian currency to get by.\n\nYou will find cash machines in towns and cities, and in most rural areas there will be at least one place where you can withdraw money, such as at a kiosk, grocery shop, or petrol station.\n\nDebit/credit cards\n\nPost offices and some grocery shops or supermarkets do not accept foreign credit cards, although they happily take debit cards.\n\nVisa and MasterCard are the most commonly accepted credit cards, with far fewer accepting Amex or Diners. If in doubt, ask before shopping.\n\nTipping\n\nWhen and where should you tip, and how much?\n\nFor the most part tipping is not common in Norway, with the exception of bars and restaurants where the locals tip when they are happy with the service or food.\n\nThere is no fixed rule of thumb for how much to tip, but tips tend to stay within 5-15% of the bill. But remember that tipping is entirely up to you – there will be no hard feelings in any case."
