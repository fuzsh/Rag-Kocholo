        "text": "Which of our destination countries are part of the European Union, and which ones use the Euro as their currency?\n\nThese are questions we’re often asked by guests travelling with us for their outdoor adventures in Sweden, Norway and Finland…and the answers aren’t necessarily straightforward!\n\nHere’s our guide to understanding EU membership (or not!) and use of the Euro (or not!) in Sweden, Norway and Finland.\n\nIs Sweden in the EU?\n\nYes, Sweden is part of the European Union. Sweden joined the EU in 1995.\n\nDoes Sweden use the Euro?\n\nNo, Sweden has not adopted the Euro. A referendum was held in 2003 and the country voted to continue with its own currency, the Swedish Krona.\n\nWhat currency does Sweden use?\n\nThe currency of Sweden is the Swedish Krona (plural Kronor) or Swedish Crown, written as SEK or Kr.\n\nAt the time of writing, 10 SEK = approx. £0.87 GBP, €1 EUR or €1.2 USD.\n\nOne Swedish Krona (Crown) is divided into 100 öre. However, since 2010, the smallest coin in circulation in Sweden is 1 SEK and prices are rounded to the nearest Krona.\n\nCoins currently in circulation are 1 SEK, 5 SEK and 10 SEK. Banknotes currently in circulation are 20 SEK, 50 SEK, 100 SEK, 200 SEK and 500 SEK.\n\nIs Norway in the EU?\n\nNo, Norway is not part of the European Union, but it is part of the EEA, the European Economic Area.\n\nThe EEA is made up of the EU member states plus Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein. Membership of the EEA gives Norway access to the internal market on equal terms with EU countries.\n\nUnlike Sweden and Finland, though, Norway is a member of NATO.\n\nDoes Norway use the Euro?\n\nNo. Norway is not a member of the EU and so would not be eligible to use the Euro.\n\nWhat currency does Norway use?\n\nThe currency of Norway is the Norwegian Krone (plural Kroner) or Norwegian Crown, written as NOK or Kr.\n\nAt the time of writing, 10 NOK = approx. £0.86 GBP, €0.98 EUR or €1.19 USD.\n\nOne Norwegian Krone (Crown) is divided into 100 øre. However, since 2012, the smallest coin in circulation in Norway is 1 NOK.\n\nCoins currently in circulation are 1 NOK, 5 NOK, 10 NOK and 20 NOK. Banknotes currently in circulation are 50 NOK, 100 NOK, 200 NOK, 500 NOK and 1000 NOK.\n\nIs Finland in the EU?\n\nYes, Finland has been a member of the EU since 1995.\n\nDoes Finland use the Euro?\n\nYes, the currency of Finland is the Euro. Finland was one of the first countries to adopt the Euro, in 1999.\n\nBefore this, the currency of Finland was the Markka, or Finnish Mark. The Markka ceased to be legal tender in 2002.\n\nHow do you write numbers in Sweden, Norway and Finland?\n\nWhen writing numbers, including amounts of money, Sweden, Norway and Finland, like many other countries, use a comma where other countries such as the UK would use a decimal point.\n\nIn the same way, where the UK uses a comma to separate thousands, Sweden, Norway and Finland use a space.\n\nFor example:\n\n1.25 in the UK would be 1,25 in Sweden, Norway and Finland.\n\n1,250 in the UK would be 1 250 in Sweden, Norway and Finland."
