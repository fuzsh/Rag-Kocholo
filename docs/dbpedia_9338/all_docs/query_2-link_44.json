        "text": "The Icelandic Króna (ISK) is the official currency of Iceland, a Nordic island country located in the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Icelandic Króna was first introduced in 1874, replacing the Danish Rigsdaler at a rate of 1 Króna to 1 Rigsdaler.\n\nThe Central Bank of Iceland (Seðlabanki Íslands) is responsible for issuing and managing the Icelandic Króna.\n\nExchange Rate System\n\nThe Icelandic Króna operates under a managed floating exchange rate system, where its value relative to other currencies is determined by market forces, such as supply and demand.\n\nThe Central Bank of Iceland may intervene in the foreign exchange market if necessary to maintain stability or prevent excessive fluctuations.\n\nThis system allows the Icelandic Króna to respond to external shocks and changes in global market conditions while maintaining a certain level of stability.\n\nSubdivisions and Denominations\n\nThe Icelandic Króna is subdivided into 100 smaller units called aurar, although aurar coins are no longer in circulation.\n\nCoins are issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 Krónur.\n\nBanknotes are available in denominations of 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, and 10,000 Krónur.\n\nEconomy and Challenges\n\nIceland’s economy is primarily based on fishing, renewable energy, tourism, and services.\n\nThe fishing industry, including fish processing and exports, is a significant contributor to the economy and provides employment for a large portion of the population.\n\nRenewable energy, particularly geothermal and hydropower, plays a crucial role in Iceland’s energy supply and economic development.\n\nThe tourism industry has been growing rapidly in recent years, attracting millions of visitors annually and providing a significant boost to the economy.\n\nHowever, Iceland faces various economic challenges, including vulnerability to fluctuations in global markets, a small domestic market, and the potential impact of climate change on its fishing industry.\n\nThe government has been working on policies to promote economic growth, diversify the economy, and address social issues such as income inequality and housing affordability.\n\nSummary\n\nIn summary, the Icelandic Króna is the official currency of Iceland and is managed by the Central Bank of Iceland.\n\nThe currency operates under a managed floating exchange rate system, with its value determined by market forces and potential intervention from the Bank.\n\nThe Icelandic Króna is subdivided into aurar, although aurar coins are no longer in circulation, and is issued in various banknote and coin denominations.\n\nIceland’s economy is primarily based on fishing, renewable energy, tourism, and services, but the country faces challenges related to vulnerability to global market fluctuations, a small domestic market, and the potential impact of climate change on its fishing industry."
