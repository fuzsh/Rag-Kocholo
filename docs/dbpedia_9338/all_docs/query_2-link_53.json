The similarly named Reichsthaler, riksdaler and rijksdaalder were used in Germany and Austria-Hungary, Sweden and the Netherlands, respectively.\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n\n2 Coins\n\n3 Banknotes\n\n4 References\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the political union between Denmark and Norway, Danish currency circulated alongside Norwegian. Norway itself issued currency denominated in two different rigsdaler, the rigsdaler courant and the rigsdaler specie, with 96 skilling to the rigsdaler courant and 120 skilling to the rigsdaler specie.\n\nIn 1816, following the establishment of the union between Sweden and Norway, the rigsdaler specie was renamed the speciedaler and became the standard unit of currency in Norway.\n\nCoins\n\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries, coins were issued in denominations of 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 skilling, 1⁄15, 1⁄5, ⅓, ½, ⅔ and 1 rigsdaler specie.\n\nBanknotes\n\nIn 1695, government notes were issued for 10, 20, 25, 50 and 100 rigsdaler (spelt rixdaler). In 1807, notes were reintroduced by the government, in denominations of 1, 5,10 and 100 rigsdaler courant, with 12 skilling notes added in 1810. In 1813, Norges Rigsbanken began issuing notes. Denominations were for 3, 6, 8 and 16 skilling, ½, 1, 5, 15, 25, 50 and 100 rigsdaler."
