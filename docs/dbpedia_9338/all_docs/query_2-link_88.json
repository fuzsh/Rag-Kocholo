Or perhaps the Danish version was different?\n\nThere are some fonts which have a glyph - but again these look like different designs. See those shown here: http://www.fontspace.com/unicode/char/20BB-nordic-mark-sign\n\nThe character is encoded in the private use area of the Medieval Unicode Font Initiative (MUFI) as  *U+F2F1 OLD FOURISH MARK SIGN (see the MUFI Character recomendation v4.0, pore specifically p.115 of this pdf). Note that this is private use character, so it can appear very differently on different fonts, you need a font which follows a recent version of the MUFI recommendation. This character  is encoded in Junicode.\n\nNote that MUFI also has a similar sign (with one flourish less) encoded just before,  *U+F2F0 OLD MARK SIGN and the specification discusses the possible unification with the Unicode character ₻ U+20BB NORDIC MARK SIGN discussed by @BillyKerr in their answer.\n\nGiven the time previous encoding in Unicode of MUFI characters took, is that any progress towards the coding of these character(s) in Unicode will take several years."
