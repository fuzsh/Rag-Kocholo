        "text": "What Is the Norwegian Krone (NOK)?\n\nThe Norwegian krone (NOK) is the official currency of Norway. Its regulation and circulation are controlled by the country's central bank, the Norges Bank. The bank has issued its eighth series of banknotes, including the latest in November 2019, which saw new 1000-krone bills. The year before introduced the new 50-krone and 500-krone bills and 2017 brought the new 100-krone and 200-krone bills.\n\nAs of August 2022, $1 USD is equal to roughly 9.77 NOK. A single Norwegian Krone is worth $0.10 cents.\n\nUnderstanding the Norwegian Krone\n\nThe Norwegian krone, or kroner (the plural term), subdivides into 100 øre. The english translation for the word krone is \"the crown.\" Coins come in denominations of 1, 5, 10, and 20 krone and banknotes appear in denominations of 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 kroner. The currency symbol is “kr.”\n\nThe new banknotes feature images of Norwegian maritime history on the front, while the back shows an abstract of sea and wind in the form of a cubic pattern. For example, the 50-krone note has a green tint, an image of the Utvær Lighthouse on the front, and the back features an abstract rendition of the light signal from a lighthouse as well as a the constellation Ursa Major.\n\nHistory of the Krone\n\nThe first circulation of the krone came in 1875 when it became the replacement of the speciedaler. At the time, the conversion rate was four kroner for one speciedaler. Following the switch, Norway joined the Scandinavian Monetary Union, an alliance that existed until the outbreak of World War I. During the existence of the Union, the Norwegian krone on the gold standard until 1931 when it was pegged to the British pound.\n\nIn 1939 the country's currency was pegged to the U.S. dollar (USD), but during the German occupation of Norway in the Second World War, it was pegged to the Reichsmark. At the war's end, the currency was pegged to the British pound (GBP). Shortly after, the krone was pegged to the US dollar until 1971 when it free floats in the market for seven years until it is linked to a basket of currencies. Then in 1992, the central bank moved away from a fixed exchange rate, allowing the currency to float based on the foreign currency exchange rate.\n\nEconomic Impact on the NOK's Value\n\nAs with all currencies, economic trends trigger fluctuation in the value of the Norwegian krone. Currency investors may seek out the NOK when the euro’s (EUR) value is in doubt. Increased activity in trading the NOK may increase the rate of exchange. Changes in the global price of crude oil also affect the NOK's value as Norway is Western Europe’s leading oil exporter.\n\nNorway's shipping, hydroelectric power, fishing, and manufacturing all contribute to the country's gross domestic product (GDP). However, it is interesting to note that many industries are state-owned. Historically, the krone is a prudent investment as Norway stakes claim to one of Europe’s most stable economies.\n\nNorway is one of the wealthiest countries on the globe and enjoys one of the highest standards of living. According to the latest World Bank data, Norway has a high-income economy with slow population growth at 0.5% annually. GDP growth for 2021 came in at 3.9% while the inflation deflator was at 16.9%.\n\nExample of the Norwegian Krone\n\nTo understand the value of the Norwegian krone in Norway, it is helpful to examine the currency's buying power with respect to familiar consumer goods. According to The Economist's popular \"Big Mac\" Index, as of June 2022, the cost of a Big Mac in Norway averaged out to 62 krone in 2022, a figure equal to about $5.15 U.S. dollars. This is the second most expensive Big Mac in the world, just behind Switzerland.\n\nThe average monthly salary in Norway was 50,800 NOK, according to Statistics Norway, a figure that converts to $5,178. Much of that salary is subject to income taxes, which are returned to the public in the form of health care and generous welfare programs.\n\nInvestopedia does not provide tax, investment, or financial services and advice.
