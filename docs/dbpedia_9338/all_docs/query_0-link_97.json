Schools and univer-\n\nwere very much under clerical control, and they paid great attention and preparation of candidates for ordination. The best known poets were the hymn-writers, such as the Icelander who meditated on the Passion and a Danish bishop of Scottish descent, Thomas Kingo; and it is significant that, when another cleric with Scots blood in his veins, Peter Dass of Nordland, gave Norway its first modern poet, his catechism verses (though published posthumously) were in print a quarter of a censities\n\nto the provision\n\ntury before his secular masterpiece, Nordland's Trumpet.

In\n\n1716 and led on to the foundation of a Seminarium Lapponicum Trondheim, where a clerg}'man of the next generation developed the study of the Lapp language and culture. The Swedes had been active in Pietist in at\n\nthis field throughout the previous century, building churches (which also advanced their own secular concerns) and maintaining an important school for Lapps, founded in 1632 by Johan Skytte. In 1755 Sweden provided its Lapp subjects with a New Testament in their own language, by which date conversion was nominally complete on both sides of the SwedishNorwegian border. But for yet another century their own form of Nature worship continued in remote places under the shamans^ whose drums produced strange ecstasies* - the Lapp magic which had been proverbial in the world of Shakespeare. Another west Norway clergyman, Hans •\n\nAs late as 1693 a shaman was burnt alive by sentence of a Swedish court, together with drums - the decorated artefacts from which the modern anthropologist derives 'a picture of the entire Lapp world'. his\n\nMonarchies\n\nin Equipoise,\n\nIj2i-iyg2\n\n175\n\nEgede,* had long cherished the dream he fulfilled in 1721, when he sailed from Bergen to west Greenland to bring the gospel and the benefits of trade to whatever inhabitants he might find there. Egede toiled for fifteen years to convert and civilise the native Greenlanders, and the monarchy remained a supporter both of the mission and of the resulting trading station after his return. Christian VI, as already noted, was himself a Pietist, and though the ideas of the German Count Zinzendorf and the Herrnhutian revivalists were too extreme for his taste, he issued a strict ordinance on Sabbath observance in preparation for the Confirmation Ordinance with which he celebrated the bicentenary of the Reformation in Denmark. Although these measures were followed by the Conventicle Ordinance to prevent the formation of dissenting congregations and discourage religious exercises under lay leadership (such as were favoured by the Herrnhutians), Pietism nevertheless did\n\nmuch\n\nto enable the individual to seek out a\n\nway\n\nThe\n\nSchools Ordinance of 1739 farmers in both kingdoms landowners and sabotaged by was unfortunately reading was the proper conto save expense, but its basis in the idea that of salvation for himself and his fellows.\n\ncomitant of confirmation likewise had a long-term influence. In the life of the intellect, a new outlook began to appear through the\n\nadvance of the Enlightenment, the great European trend of thought which later to motivate in part the work of the so-called 'enlightened despots'. In Denmark-Norway it makes its entry in the person of Ludvig Holberg, a Norwegian from a modest bourgeois milieu, who left his native Bergen for ever at the age of twenty-one and imbibed on his travels the\n\nwas\n\nfreer ideas already current in\n\ncentres abroad.\n\nHe\n\nQueen Anne's Oxford and other down in Copenhagen as\n\neventually settled\n\nintellectual\n\nthat almost\n\nunique figure, a university professor w^hose influence penetrated the life and literature of a whole nation. Holberg is best known for a series of twenty-six comedies in the style of Moliere which he wrote for the newly founded Copenhagen theatre in 1722-7. But he was also a historian, whose Norwegian origins did not prevent him from concluding that the union of the Twin Kingdoms had been beneficial to them both; the author of a Latin satire (Nils Klim), which rivals Gulliver's Travels in interest witness the existence of 27 distinct translations distributed among eight languages; and a common-sense philosopher after the fashion of Samuel\n\nJohnson. Holberg's plays are still staple fare in the theatres of Scandinavia, but Europe as a whole has strangely neglected a writer who in his own generation had no obvious superior in range of intellect except Voltaire. Nevertheless, his purely literary achievement was the most important part, since he gave the Danish language a status\n\nwhich saved\n\nit\n\nfrom being\n\n• 1 686-1 758. The Apostle of Greenland expected to work among its long-lost Norse inhabitants, but instead conducted an immensely laborious mission among their successors, the Greenlanders of today. By his exploration of the coast from 60^ to 66\", his book on the all by his efforts to organise colonisation (which he continued Denmark), Egede ensured that Greenland - off whose shores the Dutch and English hunted whales - remained a Scandinavian sphere of interest.\n\nnatural history, and above after he settled in 1736 in\n\nA\n\n176\n\nHistory of Scandinavia\n\nengulfed by the\n\nGermanised\n\nGerman tongue which predominated\n\nnobility,\n\nand\n\nat court,\n\namong\n\nthe\n\nin official circles.\n\nIn Sweden Dalin included among his many-sided literary activities as poet and pubUcist a comedy in the manner of Holberg, and the arts in general hnd influential patrons in Count C.

Whilst French and English influences competed for control in the arts, Swedish science had an independent base. The study of mineralogy and technical devices of all kinds was fostered (as we have seen) by the iron industry, and Polhem's contribution to the art of war was paralleled by that of another great savant, Emanuel Swedenborg, who invented machinery to convey Charles XII's supply vessels overland for the siege of Fredriksten. But after Swedenborg's pioneering work in many branches of science and technology had culminated in the three volumes of his Opera\n\nphilosophica et miner alia (1734), he made his way via physiology to religious speculation. This lesser Newton is therefore remembered chiefly as the\n\nfounder of the\n\nNew\n\nChurch, which came into existence\n\nin\n\nLondon twelve\n\nyears after his death there in 1772.

Both men died young, in 1784 and 1786 respectively, but Scheele's career has a special interest: his place of birth was Stralsund, in the only surviving fragment of Sweden's trans-Baltic empire, and he came to Uppsala as an assistant apothecary - a social handicap which delayed his\n\nchemists were also\n\ntables,\n\nelection to the\n\nAcademy\n\nuntil 1775.\n\nGolden Age of Swedish He was a clergyman's son, whose early studies were partly financed by Celsius, and had a highly successful medical practice in rivalry with Rosen von Rosenstein, the author of the first treatise in Europe on the ailments of children. But his lifelong interest was in botany, which he first studied in the parsonage garden, and for which he devised his binomial system of nomenclature; this was later extended to the animal kingdom and widely publicised through his many Latin works, such as the Systema Naturae, of which Yet the best known name of\n\nscience\n\nis\n\nall\n\nfrom that\n\nfirst\n\nthat of Carl Linnaeus, ennobled in 1761.\n\nMonarchies\n\nin Equipoise,\n\niy2i-iyg2\n\nSweden\n\n177\n\nLinnaeus had an important influence on agricultural practices, created a new intere^ in Lapland, and as professor of botany at Uppsala inspired many generations of pupils with his own semireligious appreciation of the wonders of Nature. One result was the participation of a number of Swedish students in the recording of the flora and fauna of what were then little-known lands, as for example in the first two voyages of Captain Cook. According to a modern French historian,\" Linnaeus 'revealed the North to the world'; perhaps it would be truer to say that he showed it in a more favourable light than that in which it appeared on the diplomatic chessboard, to which twelve editions appeared\n\nwe must now\n\nA\n\nin the author's lifetime.\n\nIn\n\nitself\n\nturn.\n\nDIMINISHED ROLE IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS\n\nIn the\n\nfirst\n\nyears of peace, Swedish eyes were turned mainly eastwards:\n\noptimists hoped that the situation in Europe might one day present a chance of recovering lost provinces in the Baltic, including south-eastern Finland, whilst pessimists watched in alarm lest Russia might plan\n\nencroachment by\n\nsome further\n\nsupport for the Holstein-Gottorp claimant to the throne. In 1727 Duke Charles Frederick married Anna, daughter of Peter the Great, so after his death in 1739 the claimant was one-half Russian. its\n\nDanish eyes were similarly fixed on the southern border: optimists hoped same Gottorp family's claims in Holstein, whilst pessimists feared a revival of its recently abandoned claims in Slesvig. But, since neither of the Scandinavian powers was now strong enough to take any\n\nto get rid of this\n\npositive\n\naction without outside support,\n\nbewildering\n\nseries\n\nof\n\nexpressed in terms of\n\nrelationships\n\ntreaties,\n\nwith\n\neach of them entered into a states\n\nof greater magnitude,\n\nmarriage alliances, subsidies, and bribes re-\n\nThe\n\nmain foreign upon the traditional Danish hostility towards Sweden; the French, which aimed at an active alliance with the Swedes, but for two decades subsidised Denmark as well, so as to strengthen the position of the Swedish ally; and the British, which from 1731 onwards sought in general to counterwork the policies of France but which also had a particular concern with trade. Thus the growth of the British market for Norwegian timber helped to make the British firm friends of Denmark-Norw^ay, so long at least as the Danes did not revive Baltic ambitions which might hamper Britain's importation of iron and naval stores from Sweden and Finland. ceived by political groups or individual politicians.\n\nthree\n\ninfluences were the following: the Russian, which often played\n\nIn these circumstances the Scandinavian states displayed considerable skill\n\nin avoiding direct\n\ninvolvement in any of the principal campaigns\n\nof the four major European conflicts which punctuate the period between the treaty of Nystad in 1721 and the outbreak of the French Revolution.\n\nBoth of them played, indeed, a minor part in the Seven Years War of 1756-63; otherwise, it was only Sweden which resorted to arms and this\n\nA\n\nlyS\n\nHistory of Scandinavia\n\nwas done by way of renewing her traditional conflict with Russia, which came to a head in 1741 and again in 1788. On the latter occasion, as we shall see, Denmark too was briefly involved. The war of 1741 had several causes, including subsidies from France, which desired a Swedish intervention to deter the Russians from joining in the War of the Austrian Succession, and the intrigues of Elizabeth, granddaughter of Peter the Great, who was expected to welcome and reward a Swedish distraction while she was arranging to supplant the infant Tsar Ivan VI. Essentially, however, it was an ill prepared Hat Party war of revenge, which ended in a complete fiasco. In the first month the Swedes suffered a heavy defeat from superior numbers at Villmanstrand, on their side of the Russo-Finnish border, and Elizabeth, after seizing the throne without Swedish help, took the opportunity to offer Finland the position of an independent buffer state. The only immediate consequence of this historically significant proposal was to add to the demoralisation of the Swedish-Finnish army, many of whose officers took leave to attend the Riksdag. When active hostilities were resumed in the following summer, Helsinki was surrendered without a fight to a Russian force no more numerous than its intended defenders, and the whole of Finland passed under the control of a Scottish general in the Russian service (James Keith), whose comparatively mild sway became known to Finns as 'the Lesser Wrath'. ^ But under the treaty of Abo, which ended the war after negotiations which extended from February to August (1743), only a section of south-eastern Finland containing about one-tenth of\n\nits\n\nremaining popula-\n\nwas transferred to Russian sovereignty, on condition that a candidate sponsored by Russia was accepted as heir to the Swedish throne. This question had come to the fore with the death in 1741 of Queen\n\ntion\n\nUlrika Eleonora, the successor-designate to her childless husband. King\n\nFrederick\n\nI\n\n;\n\nwhereupon\n\nall\n\nfour Estates of the Riksdag nominated Charles\n\nduke of Holstein-Gottorp, in her But the Empress Elizabeth, who had at first favoured this choice, decided to adopt him as heir to her own throne instead. She then demanded that the Swedes should accept his second-cousin, Adolphus Frederick,* and at the end of a conflict involving Danish interests as well (see p. 179), the Tsarina had her way. Having failed in the more ambitious project of recovering the provinces which had been lost to Russia, the Hat Party saw in the outbreak of the Seven Years War the chance to secure more modest gains - a rectification of the Pomeranian frontier beyond the Peene at the expense of Frederick II of Prussia, who was already facing overwhelming odds. French subsidies were again available, so military advances were made each summer, Peter\n\nUlrik,\n\nthe thirteen-year-old\n\nplace.\n\nThis scion of the house of Gottorp was well known to the Empress as on his mother's side he was descended from Charles XI of Sweden. He married Louisa Ulrica of Prussia in 1743; in 1747 he was appointed commander-inchief - an office in which he showed considerable ability and he reigned from 1 75 1 to 1 77 1 •\n\n1\n\n7 10-7\n\n1.\n\nPeter's guardian, whilst\n\n;\n\nMonarchies\n\nin Equipoise,\n\nIj2i-ijg2\n\n179\n\nfollowed by retirements every winter and noble officers, as before, did not hesitate to quit the field for the council chamber. In 1762, however, the ;\n\ndeath of Elizabeth brought Peter to the Russian throne; he made peace whom he was a fanatical admirer, and the Prussian king\n\nwith Frederick, of\n\nwas then\n\nmonth\n\nfree to turn his attention to events in\n\nPomerania. In the same\n\nthe Swedes were helped by his relationship with their queen to\n\nmake\n\ngood their escape from war; but they had gained no territory, incurred heavy expenditure, and suffered heavy loss of life - from disease and disorganisation as much as the sword of the enemy. Thus the long Hat regime ended with a wartime inflation which was evident to all, for prices had doubled between 1755 and 1764. A small minority may also have surmised the astonishing fact that the casualties of the Pomeranian or 'Potato' War* were of the same order as - if not actually greater than - the Swedish military losses in all the illustrious campaigns of Charles XII.\" In the absence of any overt party conflicts, Denmark-Norway steered a\n\nmore\n\nHorn Twin Kingdoms\n\nresolutely pacific course. In 1734\n\nenlisting the support of the\n\nobtained a defence pact, against the claims of the\n\nGottorp family to the Swedish throne, a rather shadowy Scandinavian which remained nominally in force for nearly thirty years. But there was no involvement in the Russo-Swedish conflict of 1 741-3 until the still unsettled question of the inheritance of the throne of Sweden arose, as already related, whereupon Danish money was employed on behalf of their own Crown Prince Frederick. As soon as it was discovered alliance\n\nthat Charles Peter Ulrik\n\nwho\n\nwas no longer\n\navailable, the peasants rallied to the\n\nbe trusted to bring back autocracy in place of a discredited parliamentary regime. Feeling in his favour was strongest in Skane, but the lead was taken by the Dalecarlians, who found customs duties on the Dano-Xorwegian frontier particularly irksome at a\n\nside of the Dane,\n\ncould\n\nat least\n\ntime of trade depression and whose regiment had incurred the heaviest losses at Villmanstrand. A majority of the Secret Committee decided in favour of Prince Frederick - but then came news that the Russians were\n\nmost of Finland if their candidate was accepted. A body of 4,500 Dalecarlians, who had arrived to carry the day in Stockholm, was then suppressed by force, and Adolphus Frederick elected by all four Estates, the peasants of Skane still dissenting. Although the project for a dynastic union of Scandinavia was not form-\n\nwilling to give back\n\nally\n\n*\n\nrevived until the opening years of the next century, the accession of\n\nThe\n\npotato had been introduced experimentally to\n\nbecame commoner with the return honie of\n\nsoldiers\n\nSweden\n\nwho had\n\nbut its adoption widespread cultiva-\n\nin 1724,\n\nseen\n\nits\n\ntion in Prussian Pomerania. t Strictly comparable figures would be difficult to establish: Xordmann gives 'about 40,000 men' as the losses in the war of 1757-62, and Professor R. Hatton says that the loss of men in the wars of Charles XII was 'certainly less than 30,000',^ of whom about 8,000 eventually returned from imprisonment in Russia. The last figure includes some Finnish civilians, but may be balanced by the number of military personnel recovered from the hands of the Danes.\n\n1\n\n80\n\nA\n\nHistory of Scandinavia\n\nAdolphus Frederick to the Swedish throne in 175 1 was immediately followed by the betrothal of his five-year-old son Gustavus to a daughter of his former rival, now Frederick V of Denmark-Norway, which would have produced an eventual claim to Frederick's throne if his two sons had had no issue. But the betrothal - which led on in 1766 to an unhappy marriage also formed part of a general project for Scandinavian co-operation, cherished by the then Danish foreign minister, J. H. E. Bernstorff, whose cosmopolitan background encouraged him to envisage a 'nordic system' linked with greater powers. His fine-spun diplomacy aimed at the elimination of the Gottorp claims in Holstein, to which the Swedes but not the Russians were now amenable, so that Russia and Scandinavia might stand ^'^\n\ntogether to secure peace 'from the Elbe to the borders of China'. ^^\n\nA\n\nlimited success was achieved in the early part of the Seven Years War, when economic and not dynastic interests brought the two Scandinavian monarchies together in a policy of armed neutrality to protect their merchant shipping from the warring powers, particularly Britain. In September 1756 a joint squadron cruised between the Norwegian coast and Jutland, but did not venture into the English Channel. Next year the Swedes proposed the closing of the Sound and Belts to safeguard Scandinavian commerce in the Baltic, and, when BernstorflF judged this step to be\n\ndangerously bellicose, of Russia for\n\nmade\n\ntheir\n\nmaking armed\n\nown arrangements\n\nto enlist the\n\nsupport\n\nneutrality effective in the Baltic region. In\n\n1760 BernstorfT belatedly adhered to the Russo-Swedish agreement. In 1762, however, the accession of Peter III of Russia, which (as we have seen) led the Swedes to make a hasty withdrawal from their campaign in Pomerania, had the opposite effect on Denmark's position: for Charles Peter Ulrik intended to maintain the claims of the\n\nHouse\n\nof Gottorp in\n\nits claims in Slesvig. The Danes had three advantages a strong neutrality guard already posted in Holstein, a at this juncture French general (C. L. de St Germain) who had been brought in the previous year as commander-in-chief, and a superior fleet. But, since their French allies were not disposed to help them, their military prospects were at best uncertain, until Peter was deposed at his wife's instigation on the very day\n\nHolstein and revive\n\nwhen he intended\n\nto leave for the battle-front.\n\nWhereas Peter had offered Norway to the Swedes if they would help in his projected' campaign against the Danes, the new Empress Catherine preferred to consolidate a special relationship with Denmark, which lasted for almost a century. She made peace at once, and in 1767 an exchange (mageskifte) already contemplated by BernstorfT was at last agreed upon, so that at the coming of age of her son Paul in 1773 all Gottorp claims in the Duchies .would be renounced in return for Oldenburg and another minor possession of the Danish monarchy. As for Sweden, Catherine's able minister Panin,\n\nwho had\n\nspent twelve years as Russian representative\n\nStockholm, w^orked hard to establish northern powers, in which Sweden as well\n\nin\n\na as\n\ncomprehensive grouping of Denmark-Norway would be\n\nMonarchies\n\namong\n\nin Equipoise^\n\niy2i-iyg2\n\nthose to be ranged on the Empress's side against the\n\ni8i\n\nBourbon\n\nmonarchies of France and Spain. With this in view, the Russo-Danish alUance was strengthened to provide for joint action in case of any threat to the parHamentary institutions which made Sweden amenable to outside influence; if she proved quite unmanageable, both allies should be entitled to territorial gains at her expense.

Mental aberrations which can now be identified as incipient dementia praecox were already apparent at the time of the young king's marriage to his English cousin, Caroline Matilda, but in 1768 he proved capable of undertaking an eight-month foreign tour, during which he was enthusiastically received in London and Paris and accepted honorary degrees from both Oxford and Cambridge. He was accompanied on his journey by a German physician from Holstein, Dr Friedrich Struensee, whose considerable medical talents soon established a complete ascendancy over the king; indeed, he seems to have been much less resentful than his subjects of the fact that soon after their return to Denmark the court doctor also became the queen's lover. After securing the dismissal of BernstorflF and the replacement of the Privy Council by a Cabinet under his direct control, Struensee was in a position to gratify his love of power and progressive ideology by reconstructing the entire administration of the lex regiUy\n\nTwin Kingdoms;\n\nas\n\nan uninhibited supporter of the Enlightenment, much as more prudent despots in\n\nhe attempted in sixteen months as sixteen years.\n\nHis 1,880 decrees set up a new civil court in Copenhagen, which survived and a ban on torture, which did not. Complete freedom of the press was proclaimed, a measure which brought him the congratulations of Voltaire but also stimulated the growth of opposition. The Norwegians benefited by the abolition of the Danish corn monopoly and by a modification of the udal law to the advantage of farm purchasers: Norwegian sailors and soldiers were nevertheless among the first elements in Copenhagen to demonstrate against the new regime. Minorities of all kinds, from Herrn-\n\nhis downfall,\n\nhuters to illegitimate children, were accorded better treatment; officials\n\nwere reduced in number, but paid in salaries instead of perquisites; and the public finances might be expected to profit in the long run by the abolition of subsidies and the stimulus of free trade. But there was no long run: Struensee spoke no Danish, had no idea of appealing to public opinion, and was faced with the implacable enmity of the dowager queen,\n\n1\n\nA\n\n82\n\nHistory of Scandinavia\n\nwho hoped that her own son, Prince Frederick, as heir-presumptive might soon replace his imbecile half-brother on the throne. Struensee's overthrow by a palace conspiracy, his trial for treason, and subsequent execution - whose barbarities Juliane observed with pleasure through an opera glass - interested all Europe. So did the fate of Caroline Matilda, whom her brother. King George III, deemed largely responsible for her own misfortunes and sent to spend the rest of her short life as a disgraced divorcee in Hanover. For the history of Scandinavia it is more important to note the brevity of the reaction, in which Juliane, her son, and his former tutor, O. H. Guldberg, who presided over a strengthened form of Privy Council, swept aside even such innocent reforms as a balanced budget. Moreover, that short period was marked by two features which boded well for Denmark's future - in the first seven years a foreign Juliane,\n\npolicy brilliantly conducted by A. P. Bernstorff, a minister, and the steadfast opposition of\n\nfluence which had predominated for levels of society.\n\nwhen\n\nThen\n\nin April 1784\n\nthe sixteen-year-old\n\nCrown\n\nnephew\n\nGuldberg\n\nmore than\n\na\n\nof the earlier\n\nto the\n\nGerman\n\nin-\n\ncentury in the upper\n\ndespotism again became enlightened,\n\nPrince Frederick overthrew the cabal\n\nCouncil meeting, by securing his father's signature and the magic word approberet ('approved') to a list of new ministers before the old ones knew what he was about. at a\n\nThe Crown until his\n\nPrince,\n\nunhappy\n\nwho from\n\nthis resolute\n\nfather's death in 1808,\n\nwas no\n\nbeginning acted as regent intellectual\n\nand interested\n\nhimself chiefly in the more showy aspects of military exercises and cerea group of abler men to kingdoms needed.

How degraded the condition of the peasants was is shown by the very first measure, which in 1786-7 forbade landlords and\n\nThe primacy accorded\n\nto agriculture in the teaching of the\n\nMonarchies their bailiffs to inflict physical\n\nin Equipoise\n\npunishment upon\n\n^\n\niy2i-iyg2\n\ntheir tenants\n\nuse of the long whip or fetters, by making them ride the or requiring\n\nthem\n\nSpanish mantle'.\n\nwooden\n\n183\n\nby the horse,\n\nabout encased in a barrel known familiarly as 'the second stage was to encourage the tenant to improve\n\nto go\n\nThe\n\naward compensaBut the most important change of all was the abolition of the stavnsbdndy which was initiated in 1788 but involved such farreaching consequences that it did not apply to all age-groups until 1800. Ten years before this, however, the law had given the tenant a further protection - one which was not usual in England - by setting the minimum duration for a lease at the lifetime of the tenant and his wife; and by 1799 all work-rents had to be clearly defined, with the result that they quickly ceased to be a common feature of farm tenancies. After about two decades three-fifths of the land worked by peasant farmers was peasant-owned, and there were fewer farm tenants than cottars. Economically, the result was that about the same proportion of the land as was peasant-owned had been enclosed - rather more on the islands and less in more backward Jutland - and that improved methods of agriculture had doubled the average yield. Thus the peasant had a surplus for market during the period of war in Europe, when corn, butter and bacon all fetched higher prices. As for the social results, it was in 1792 - the year of the downfall of the French monarchy - that Copenhagen raised its Monument to the Freedom of the Peasant, 'the liberty of the subject which its beloved king established for the honourable class, the labours of whose hands maintain and defend the State'. ^-^ A Danish historian of today still looks back upon ^^ this period as 'perhaps the happiest time that Denmark has ever known.' This may be so, but at the turn of the century owners and tenants of farms were slightly outnumbered by the cottar class, half of whom had no land and all of whom paid rent in labour, to which their masters now attached the his holding\n\nby the\n\ninstitution of independent tribunals to\n\ntion for disturbance.\n\nmaximum importance. Industry and commerce were likewise freed from restriction by commison the principles most clearly advocated in Adam Smith's\n\nsions acting\n\nWealth of Nations, of which a Danish translation had appeared within three years of the original publication in 1776. The growth of prosperity was certainly stimulated by technological advances, such as the opening of the Eider Canal to carry small ships across Holstein, the introduction of the steam engine in 1790 and of the more effective Watt engine in 1804,\n\nfirst\n\nand the building or rebuilding by the latter date of at least thirty-three Danish harbours. But the main factor was the liberation of trade from monopolies and other restrictions. In 1787, for example, all subjects of the crown were empowered to trade with Iceland and in 1788 the importation of corn to southern Norway was thrown open to all comers on payment of a moderate tariff. Next year dealings with Finnmark were made completely free, the Tromso district being added to the county as a further inducement to traders; the result was a wholly new prosperity. In Denmark itself the\n\n1\n\nA\n\n84\n\nHistory of Scandinavia\n\nfreeing of the cattle export business was followed by the trebling of exports in six years,\n\nallowing\n\nand\n\nin 1793 the\n\nfacilities for\n\nDanish entrepot trade was stimulated by\n\nevery port to hold uncustomed goods for re-export.\n\nThe\n\nprocess culminated in the tariff of 1797, which ranged between 5 per cent on raw materials and 24 per cent on fully manufactured articles; trade then proved so resilient that these drastic reductions in rates did to any reduction in income from customs. Total revenue doubled between 1786 and 1806, but growing military expenditure made\n\nnot lead\n\nit\n\nimpossible for\n\nnew monetary\n\nSchimmelmann\n\nto balance the national accounts.\n\nA\n\nwhich he had set up in 1 79 1, was already seriously depreciated by the end of the century except in the Duchies, where alone it retained its full basis in silver, a circumstance which promoted dealings with Hamburg rather than Copenhagen. But the Enlightenment had broad social effects, which the financial disasters of later years could not efface. Struensee's work for law reform and better organised poor relief was taken up and amplified; a visit which John Howard had paid to Denmark in 1781 led to some eventual improvement of the prisoner's lot; and in 1795 a system of conciliation courts was introduced, which still operates in both Denmark and Norway as an informal method of reducing litigation. A series of laws gave the Jews a freer position than in most parts of the Continent, and in 1792 Denmark led the world in the abolition of the slave trade, albeit that a ten-year delay was conceded, during which slaveholders were entitled to borrow public\n\nmoney\n\nunit, the spesidaler or specie-dollar,\n\nin order to increase their holdings. Lastly, the Great School\n\nCom-\n\nmission was set up in 1789 under the inspiration of German educational advances; within two years it had founded a training college for teachers;\n\nand by the turn of the century it was ready with a plan for village schools, to be based on compulsory attendance from five to the age of confirmation. The fact that the Commission was not able to enact a comprehensive school-law until 18 14 does not reduce the honour due to the two Reventlow brothers and other noblemen, who strove to spread to a whole nation the benefits which they had provided for the children on their own estates long before the war years intervened to hinder the completion of their public work. In Sweden enlightened despotism achieved no single result which was commensurate with the liberation of the peasantry in Denmark;\n\nbut Gustavus HI,\n\nwhom\n\nenchanter on the throne',^* attracts attention\n\nand\n\nfall as\n\nwell as by\n\nupon as through the drama of his\n\nthe poet of the next age looked back\n\nsome\n\n'the rise\n\nof his positive achievements. Frederick the\n\nGreat's sister had reared her son in the spirit of the Enlightenment, with\n\nC. G. Tessin and Olof von Dalin as his early tutors, and in 1771 the news of his father's death found him in Paris, where the prince was in contact with the Encyclopedists and other advanced thinkers of the day.

The summer of 1772 appeared propitious for an attempt to regain what the Swedish monarchy had lost under its two foreign kings, because the Russians were preoccupied with war against the Turks as well as with their arrangements for initiating the partition of Poland - the latter a clear pointer\n\nwhich Sweden's free constitution by the Caps, a number of Jakob Sprengtporten (who had the support\n\nto the pretexts for foreign intervention\n\nlikewise provided.

However, the young king, taking the risk of acting on his own, won Stockholm by a bold appeal to the Guards regiments and to the unprivileged populace. The Councillors were arrested without a drop of blood being spilt in their defence, and two days later a new Form of Government was unanimously approved by the Riksdag after listening to an eloquent harangue from the king, which was backed by cannon pointed at their place of assembly.\n\nThe\n\nconstitution of 1772\n\nfaction without\n\nmaking too\n\nwas\n\na\n\ncompromise, designed\n\nto\n\nend party\n\ngreat inroads into the privileges of the nobility,\n\nfrom whose ranks the original promoters of the royalist coup d'etat had been drawn. The Council was reduced to a body of advisers, composed mainly of high officials some members possessing legal qualifications acted with the king as a final court of appeal. The Riksdag, which was to meet only when required by the king (who also chose the presiding officer of each Estate), still had joint control with the Crown over legislation and finance but its only independent powers were that its sanction was needed for any war of aggression and that it could restrict the duration of any new tax. During the remaining twenty years of the reign, the Riksdag w^as summoned only four times, and each session was short. As for the bureaucracy, a vaguely worded clause in the constitution laid down that appointments should be made without regard to birth or favour, 'unless found in combination with ability'. ^^ But, although the very names of Hats and Caps were proscribed, Gustavus necessarily leant for support upon those families of the Hat nobility which had assisted his cUmb to power; the ;\n\n;\n\ncommittees of the Riksdag still contained twice as many nobles as clergy or burgesses and no representatives of the tax-paying\n\nfact that the chief\n\n* The British secret service, at that time in league with the Russians, had already informed the Council of a report about an impending coup, contained in a letter from the French minister in Stockholm, which had been intercepted in Hanover.\n\n1\n\n86\n\nA\n\nHistory of Scandinavia\n\npeasants shows that the conflict of classes had merely been driven into the background. Prompt measures were taken to deal with the financial crisis, which had been rendered more acute by a series of poor harvests. Internal barriers to the circulation of grain were removed and its importation was made easier. Inflation was checked by the introduction of a new currency, based on the\n\nmoney being redeemed at half value. The tariff was reduced; the major ports lost their privileges over other ports, and it was made easier for newcomers to gain admission to the urban craft gilds. All these innovations in some degree benefited the peasants, and in 1783 a land-survey ordinance encouraged the villager to consolidate his strips though in practice enclosure derived more stimulus from the example set from that year onwards by Rutger Maclean (p. 197). But the most ambitious scheme to promote the growing of more food for a rapidly increasing population was a crown monopoly of distilling, which was designed to stop farmers from diverting their grain to this more profitable object; in this case, however, enhghtenment had to give way to outraged silver riksdaler, the old\n\ninterests.\n\nEnlightened measures of more general import included the abolition of first week after the coup d'etat and the removal of many\n\ntorture in the\n\nwho admired the writings of Beccaria. The operawas investigated as part of a general purge and reform of the whole bureaucratic system; Finland, for example, to which Gustavus paid many visits, was given a second appeal court, and its four counties were extended to six. Like his Prussian uncle, Gustavus was a freemason* and he granted a wide degree of religious toleration, not only to foreign immigrants, including the Jews, but also to the Pietist groups (at which the Lutheran clergy as a whole looked askance) and the Swedenborgians. There were, however, other sides to the complex character of the king, who saw fit to protect his own position by a return to censorship and the institution of a police force (including secret police) on the French model. In 1778, indeed, his talents as an orator and the celebration of the birth of an heir combined to produce strong expressions of loyalty to the throne from every Estate but when the Riksdag was summoned a second time in 1786, bad harvests had again caused discontent, which encouraged the nobles to take the lead in denouncing the rule of royal favourites. In the last six years of his reign Gustavus III sought to alleviate discontent by the distractions of a glorious foreign policy. But before turning to the international relationships which had grown up since 1770-2, mention must be made of the cultural achievements associated with a king whose personality was perhaps more akin to that of the great actor than the great statesman.

Meanwhile Gustavus HI, who knew that he had been lucky to escape the intervention of the two allies in support of the parliamentary constitution in Sweden, safeguarded his position by employing French subsidies to improve the defences. A new situation was created during the American War of Independence, when the intervention of France and Spain on behalf of the colonists caused neutral trade to suffer heavy losses at the hands of both sides.

Except for contraband of war, neutral goods should be immune from capture while conveyed on enemy ships likewise, enemy goods on neutral ships and neutral shipping should be entitled to trade with enemy ports, unless they were blockaded in practice and not by a mere proclamation of blockade. These principles, which did not receive full international recognition until 1856, formed the basis of a RussoDanish convention of 9 June 1780 two months later this became the Armed Neutrality of the North, with Sweden, Prussia and (temporarily) Holland as additional adherents. The Russians were offended and the agreement was to some extent weakened by Bernstorff 's action in making a private arrangement with England for the exemption of the foodstuffs and timber (other than shipbuilding materials) of the Twin Kingdoms from seizure as contraband. How far the Armed Neutrality was effective in reducing searches and seizures by the British Navy is uncertain, but for the Norwegian mercantile marine at least this seems to have been a period of\n\ntions,\n\n;\n\n;\n\n;\n\n1\n\n88\n\nA\n\nHistory of Scandinavia\n\nsteady growth; although particularly exposed to the activities of British patrol vessels, it ended the war with its tonnage almost doubled and more\n\nmany ships which had been built abroad. Although the war revealed a common interest and profit in the organisation of neutral trade, Gustavus III did not regard neutrahty as a sufficiently glorious objective for his policy. Regular manoeuvres were held from the beginning of his reign, and the ships of the line were doubled. An 'army fleet' of oared galleys to operate inside the skerries, first planned after the fiasco of the Russian war of 174 1-3, was now fully developed; and on an island in Helsinki harbour the massive fortress of Sveaborg, w^hich had been under construction for a quarter of a century, at last became fully available to protect the Finnish frontier from being bypassed by Russian than twice as\n\nmovements along the Gulf. Since the settlement of the Gottorp claims gave the House of Oldenburg security on its southern frontier, Gustavus would have liked to make his own western frontier more secure by the Swedish crown. With this in view^, he planned a sudden, unprovoked attack on Copenhagen; but this required the connivance of Catherine the Great, who refused to desert her Danish ally. transfer of Norw^ay to the\n\nThe domestic difficulties already mentioned then prompted the king to engage in the much bigger and, in the eyes of many of his subjects, more appeaUng adventure of an attack on Russia itself, when that power was preoccupied by a new^ war against the Turks. Accordingly, in June 1788 Swedes disguised as Cossacks w^ere used to create a border incident, after which a part of the Swedish-Finnish army moved across the Russian frontier towards Fredrikshamn (Hamina); but the main body was to be shipped across for an all-out attack on St Petersburg. This bold amphibious operation was brought to a standstill in the second week of the war, when a drawn battle off Hogland in the Gulf of Finland failed to wrest command of the sea from the Russians, who thus obtained a breathing-space in which to collect their forces. In August the king also withdrew his troops from the siege of Fredrikshamn to Finland, which became the scene of a grave mutiny known as the League of Anjala (to be examined separately), and before the end of the month Denmark-Norway entered the war under Russian pressure as an 'auxiliary Crown Prince Frederick, who had recently paid Norway the honour of the first royal visit for half a century and had also made Danish rule more popular by ending the corn monopoly, accompanied the advance of 15,000 Norwegian soldiers against Gothenburg. The Swedes were heavily outnumbered, but the campaign lasted only a few autumn weeks, as Britain and Prussia intervened to negotiate an armistice; both powers wished to check the growth of Russian influence in the north, and the British had important commercial interests in Gothenburg. Thus the equipoise within Scandinavia was quickly restored. The Russo- Swedish war continued, however, through two more campaigning seasons, with minor forays across the frontier from either power'.\n\nMonarchies\n\nin Equipoise^\n\niy2i-iyg2\n\n189\n\nand naval operations involving both types of fleet. These culminated when the Swedes lost one-third of their ships of the line in breaking their way out of the Gulf of Viipuri, but a week later faced the Russians again with their galley fleet at Svensksund (westof Fredrikshamn), where it had been defeated a year before. This time the Swedes won their side\n\nin July 1790,\n\ngreatest galley victory, destroying fifty-two\n\nof their own.\n\nThe Peace\n\nenemy\n\nvessels for a loss of six\n\nof Varala, signed in the following month, involved\n\nterritorial changes, but it registered the formal abandonment of any Russian claim to intervene in Sweden's internal affairs; and in the autumn\n\nno\n\ntheir common hostility towards the French Revolution caused 1 79 1 Catherine and Gustavus to make a defence pact, valid for eight years.\n\nof\n\nThe domestic\n\ncrisis, precipitated by the reverses in the opening phase of more far-reaching consequences. After the retirement across the frontier from Fredrikshamn, no fewer than 112 officers in the camp at Anjala entered secretly into communication with the Russian Empress to stop the war. They included a handful of Finnish separatists, led by the younger Sprengtporten, who had fled to Russia in 1786, feeling that his services to Gustavus in the coup d'etat had been insufficiently rewarded (see p. 185). But their action was based primarily on the king's patent disregard for the constitution, which required the consent of the Riksdag for any war of aggression. Gustavus, however, though he had been brought by his failure as a military strategist to contemplate abdication, again showed his skill in poHtical strategy by the use he made of the Danish declaration of war. Leaving his brother Charles in charge in Finland - where he tempor-\n\nthe war, had\n\n- he himself hurried to Dalecarlia, scene of the earliest Vasa triumphs, where his oratory rallied the populace to his support against two traditional enemies - the Danes and the nobility. He was thus able to continue the war; the leading 'Anjala-men' were arrested, though only one of them was eventually executed for high treason and in February 1789 the Estates were summoned for a final reckoning. Having changed the constitution once in alliance with the nobles, Gustavus now changed it again with the lower Estates as his allies. When the nobility proved recalcitrant, they were bitterly reproached in a speech from the throne and a score of their leaders placed under house arrest -\n\nised with the mutineers\n\n;\n\nwhich was easily carried out, as the secret police had the support both of the Stockholm burgesses and volunteers from Dalecarlia. An Act of Union and Security was then adopted by the three lower Estates, although the modification of privileges which ensured their support for other changes was legally invalid because the nobles still rejected it. Henceforth the monarch was entitled to dispense with the Council, which had served the state for five centuries, had fuller control of the bureaucracy, and was able to declare war as and when he pleased; the only important remaining check upon his freedom of action was the right of his subjects a coup\n\nto vote the taxes. In return for their\n\ncompliance with the royal demands the\n\nthree lower Estates were given the right to occupy most public offices,\n\n1\n\nA\n\n90\n\nHistory of Scandinavia\n\nincluding one-half of the seats in a\n\nnew Supreme\n\nCourt, and to buy\n\ntypes of land except that in the immediate vicinity of a nobleman's\n\nall\n\nmanor\n\nThus the Swedish peasant had almost complete access to the ownership of Swedish soil; by 1809 about 15 per cent of all outlying noble property was his, and by 181 5 he had acquired the major part of a further 3,500 farms from the Crown. ^^ Though motivated largely by political expediency, these were impressive concessions for an enlightened despot to have introduced three months before the meeting of the French EstatesGeneral at Versailles heralded the downfall of the ancien regime. Events in France at first aroused little revolutionary feeling in Scandinavia, where a complacent public opinion thought of the French as engaged in claiming social rights which were already recognised in the north. But the people of the towns - especially those with close trade connections with France, such as Bergen and Trondheim - followed the unfolding drama with sympathetic interest in the pages of the press, which had struggled into existence after the relaxation of the censorship, and drank to the new French principles of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity. As for government policy, A. P. Bernstorff was a resolute non-interventionist, but Gustavus III in the course of 1790 came to fear the influence that the developments in France might have upon his own subjects and forbade any further mention of them in the newspapers. In 1791 he encouraged Count Axel von Fersen* in his attempt to rescue the French royal family, and he was one house.\n\nof the\n\nfirst\n\nrulers to\n\ndemand European\n\nintervention.\n\nHe\n\ndid not live to see\n\nconsequences for Louis XVI, but the radical element in the conspiracy which ended his own life in March 1792 seems to have been influenced less by current happenings in France than by the teachings of Rousseau and their exemplification in the United States of America. Gustavus III was shot by a former captain of the royal guards during a its\n\nmasked\n\nball at the\n\nOpera House only two months previously ;\n\nhis financial\n\nmeasures had been approved by the Riksdag with scarcely a murmur, but the hatred felt by nobles and army officers was inveterate. The king died a lingering death of gangrene, which gave time for him to prevent the intended coup d'etat and also added to the romantic lustre which still surrounds his name. Less than a month later, the long wars of the French Revolution and Empire ushered in a new period, in which the relationship between sovereign and subject began to be seen in terms of nationality rather than dynastic allegiance.

Except for traders and the occasional adventurous traveller, foreigners were content to have a cursory knowledge of Denmark and Sweden, the other territories - apart from a natural German interest in the nearby Duchies - being as unfamiliar as Scotland and Wales were to continental visitors to the court of the early\n\nGeorges. For definite\n\na time, indeed, a division into\n\nentities\n\nseemed\n\nto\n\ntwo and not more than two Scandinavian peoples\n\nbe accepted by the\n\nthemselves, for after the long period of fruitless internecine conflicts the\n\nupper classes shared Holberg's view that existing arrangements were the most rational, whilst the masses were more concerned to win their daily bread than to assert claims of nationality. Yet the two generations of peace can be seen in retrospect to have helped the growth of attitudes which were to give the Scandinavia of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries a ven* dilTerent aspect.\n\nSweden's loss of empire, followed by the pam* struggles of the Age of Freedom, might have been expected to weaken its hold on the loyalty of the Finns, especially after the further sacrince of Finnish territory\n\nm\n\n1743.\n\nBut the position of a buiTer-state called into existence by Russian favour, as otTered by the Empress Elizabeth, made little appeal to the population at large, so long as there was any prospect that allegiance to the Swedish Crown might bring adequate protection. Although Sprengtporten after his flight to Russia became the Empress Catherine's adviser on Finnish questions, his supporters at flrst amounted to no more than a little group of landowning officers in the border districts which were most exposed to Russian threats. It was, indeed, the officers of six Finnish regiments who subsequently brought about the League of Anjala: but, although one of the preliminan.- documents urged Catherine to negotiate with 'the nation's representatives'^^ and a so-called Diet of border gentry elected Sprengtporten as its leader, the main object of the League was to end an unprofltable war - an object which was forgotten as soon as the campaign of 1789 brought a few successes on the frontier. These political activities would almost certainly have developed much faster if Finland had not formed an equal part of a composite realm; its inhabitants enjoyed the same rights of representation in the Riksdag and were subject to the same laws as those of Sweden. In the years of peace the population in fact grew faster: in Gustavus's reign 3,000 new farms\n\n192\n\nA\n\nHistory of Scandinavia\n\nwere carved out through the assignment of crown property when comenclosed; some areas were opened up by new miUtary roads; and the product known in the west as 'Stockholm tar' began to arrive there in Finnish ships from Finnish ports. Culturally, however, Finland remained a Swedish province, where upper-class families treasured their Swedish origins and aspiring native Finns were prone to adopt Swedish surnames, and where the Finnish language was relegated to its use in church and other dealings of the official class with the masses. Abo Academy nurtured such luminaries as Chydenius and Kellgren, but the most significant figure was the university librarian and later professor, H. G. Porthan,* who organised Finland's first learned society and periodical; he also began the systematic collection of Finnish folk poetry, much of it passed down by word of mouth from the pre-Christian era, out of which the national epic Kalevala was eventually to take shape. In contrast to the Swedish ascendancy which - with the minor exception of Pomerania - prevailed throughout the dominions of the Swedish monarchy, the House of Oldenburg was hemmed in on two sides by alien cultures strong enough to support political discontent. In spite of Holberg's work on behalf of the Danish language and literature, Denmark itself was permeated for more than a hundred years by German influences at court, in society and throughout the government. As we have seen, these culminated with Struensee and were reversed after his fall but in the last decades of the eighteenth century two out of three leading ministers were of German origin and the German Chancery was still one of the main instruments of administration. Such was the vigour of the German culture, which generation by generation had entrenched itself more securely in the borderlands between the Kingdom of Denmark and Germany proper. In 1773 SlesvigHolstein, as we have seen, became attached to Denmark by firmer political ties than at any time since the close of the middle ages. But only sixteen years later, when the first attempt was made to impose new taxes in the Duchies without the voluntary co-operation of the nobility, the dynasty's desire to establish a unitary state (helstat) met with an opposition in which\n\nmons were\n\n;\n\nGerman\n\nnationalist feelings began to play a part. Norwegian protests against the actions of the unitary state had a different basis. Although each of the main regions of Norway possessed distinctive dialects, which the more reflective inhabitants knew to be derived from the older Norwegian usages of the middle ages, language as the basis of a separate culture was not yet a powerful divisive force. t On the two main occasions when the peasants rose against the authorities, their hostility was directed against the officials on the spot and not against the • 1739-1804. His De poesi fennica, published in 1766-78, was preceded in 1745 by a Finnish-Latin-Swedish dictionary of 16,000 words, which held the field for c. 80 years, compiled by his grand-uncle, Daniel Juslenius (1676-1752). Both these pioneers of Finnish studies were of Swedish family and intensely loyal to the Swedish connection. t In 1 77 1 a dialogue to illustrate peasant grievances was for the first time published in dialect; but its anonymous author^\" was a clergyman and he appended a Danish translation.\n\nMonarchies\n\nin Equipoise,\n\niy2i-iyg2\n\n193\n\nFather of his peoples in royal Copenhagen, sitting at the apex of their little world. In 1765, when Bergen was the scene of a demonstration against a widely resented poll-tax, the mob which poured into the town from its\n\nimpoverished hinterland assaulted the regional governor - a Norwegian by and a bailiff, as being personally responsible for the unfair im-\n\nbirth -\n\nposition.\n\nA\n\nlarge part of the tax\n\nwas eventually remitted, and\n\na\n\ncommis-\n\nsion of three Danish officials which conducted a full inquiry was critical of both governor and bailiff, but in the end sentences of life imprisonment were passed on two of the popular leaders. Two decades later a disgruntled farmer on the south coast conducted a more formidable agitation against the malpractices of officials and the misuse of town privileges which they abetted; he was supported for a while by 800 men in arms. A commission was again appointed, composed this time of Norwegian officials, and many grievances were redressed - as it had been expected would happen when the petitions of the peasantry became properly known to the king or crown prince in Copenhagen. But although Christian Lofthuus was a leader of wide repute among his fellow peasants, so that his arrest in March 1787 had to be contrived by stealth, the movement which he led soon ebbed away; he died ten years later still a prisoner in Akershus castle, waiting for his case to be heard on appeal, and twelve of his supporters were not set free until 1800.\n\nA wedge was nevertheless being driven between the peoples of the Twin Kingdoms by a section of the Norwegian middle class, which had long envied and resented the commercial privileges of the Copenhagen mer-\n\nbecame stronger as Norway drew closer to Denmark and came to exceed it in wealth per head: why should Norwegians be denied a bank to help their commerce, a university to train officials for their special needs, a supreme court and a treasury of their own? The need for a bank, for example, was being mooted in Oslo within a decade or so of the establishment of Copenhagen's first bank in 1736. These practical demands were accompanied by other expressions of a separate national identity, such as the Trondheim Scientific Academy, set up in 1760 to promote learned studies of advantage to Norway, and the Norwegian Society in Copenhagen. Organised in 1772 to combat German cultural influences in the capital, it inspired J. H. Wessel's still amusing comedy, 'Love Without Stockings', but was chiefly significant as a rally ingpoint for Norwegian students, where future officials sang 'Norway, Nursery of Giants!' with appropriate libations. But the most influential support for national claims came from a small but ver\\' wealthy group which owned the timber vards and ironworks of the south-eastern ports chants. This feeling in population\n\ntogether with\n\nmany\n\nof the forests of their hinterland.\n\nThis patrician class, as it was termed, had close contacts with Sweden because of flotation agreements for timber where rivers crossed the border, whilst Gustavus III kept himself informed of unrest in Norway through spies and, in the last few years of his reign, through a consul-general,\n\n1\n\n94\n\nA\n\nHistory of Scandinavia\n\nwho was the only foreign representative posted to eighteenth-century Oslo. From 1772 onwards some Norwegian patricians had secret dealings with the king of Sweden, in the belief that Norway was too weak to stand alone but would be granted a much freer position in a union under the Swedish crown than it possessed under the House of Oldenburg. As Gustavus's plans for expansion were eventually diverted from Denmark\n\non Russia, any attempted assessment of how the Norwegians might have fared in practice under his sovereignty would be meaningless, but the idea of liberty through union with Sweden remained to influence\n\nto the attack\n\nthe nationalist thinking of the following generation.\n\nWhereas Norway, Finland, and the Duchies all had important elements which were stimulated to envisage political change by the self-assurance generated by prosperity, Iceland received no such encouragement. In the middle of the century the autocratic monarchy did, indeed, for the first time give internal control of the economy to a native Icelandic fogd or bailiff, Skuli Magnusson he made great efforts to raise the condition of the people by bringing over Danish and Norwegian farmers to improve the agriculture, by introducing better boats and tackle for the fisheries, and by setting up a woollen manufactory at Reykjavik with skilled German weavers. But he was bitterly opposed by the Copenhagen company which had long held the trade monopoly, and by the General Trading Company which replaced it after an interval of direct control by the Crown. The government in Copenhagen, which assisted Skuli's plans for the welfare of its Icelandic subjects, eventually resumed this control of the trade until it was finally thrown open in 1787. By that time, however, it was almost too late for private enterprise to revive the economy of an island whose inhabitants suffered almost in-\n\nin their population\n\n;\n\ncessant harassment at the hands of Nature. Its eighteenth-century annals\n\nrecorded no fewer than forty-three years which were marked by earthquakes, eruptions, abnormally prolonged winters, epidemics, or failure of the fisheries, culminating in the volcanic outbreak of 1783 this caused such devastation that a Danish government commission contemplated the ;\n\nresettlement of the Icelandic population in Jutland. to 38,400 -\n\nabout three-quarters\n\nits\n\nBy 1786\n\nsize at the outset of\n\nit had fallen what was for\n\nother European peoples a century of rapid growth.

When a native poet who was in Danish official employment (Eggert Olafsson) in company with Iceland's first state physician^^ wrote Reise to other lands\n\nigiennom Island, this earliest\n\nmodern account\n\nof the island did not find a\n\npublisher in Copenhagen until 1772, which was four years after its main author's death. An English translation appeared, however, in 1805 - the very year in which the battle of Trafalgar presaged great changes in all the\n\nScandinavian countries through the interaction of land and sea power, the latter being of special importance for the remote Atlantic island.\n\nChapter g\n\nThe Impact\n\nof European\n\nWar,\n\n1792-1815 LAST PHASE OF THE OLD ORDER Except for the short-lived peace of Amiens in 1802-3, Europe was destined remain at war for more than twenty-two years, during which the ideas generated by the French Revolution marched with the French armies as far afield as Moscow. But for two-thirds of this momentous period Scandinavia remained under the old order, comparatively little affected by new ideas and only twice involved in brief hostilities - when the British to\n\nfleet\n\ndescended on Copenhagen in 1801 and when a Swedish force was\n\nGermany in 1805. the assassination of Gustavus III was followed by a regency\n\nsent to support the Third Coalition in\n\nIn\n\nSweden\n\nyounger brother, Duke Charles, ruling on behalf of his thirteenThe Regent ignored the last wishes of the dying king by driving from office his favourite, G. M. Armfelt, and allowed the nobles who had backed the assassin to escape punishment. His own interests being in freemasonry and occultism rather than government, he left the country largely in the hands of a fellow mason, G. A. Reuterholm, the son of a former leader of the Cap Party, who tried to get rid of Gustavian influences upon the young king by unmasking an alleged conspiracy; this resulted in Armfelt's fleeing for a time to Russia. Reuterholm also tried to improve the financial situation by negotiating for subsidies from revolutionary France, but after quarrelling with the Directory had to turn to Russia instead. The Empress Catherine encouraged negotiations for a marriage between her granddaughter and the new king of Sweden, but these broke down over the demand that she should continue to practise the Orthodox religion, to which her intended husband refused his consent, much to Reuterholm's discomfiture; when Gustavus came of age in 1796, he retired abroad. Like his father before him, Gustavus IV inherited a very difficult situation, but he was much less able to cope with it. Though religious, dutiful, and not unintelligent, he was too narrow-minded and introspective to make a popular leader in a crisis. For nearly a decade, however, the\n\nunder\n\nhis\n\nyear-old nephew, Gustavus IV.\n\nThe Impact of European War, iyg2-i8i5\n\n197\n\nyoung king ruled with success. He made Axel von Fersen marshal of the realm, and restored Armfelt to favour, but relied mainly upon officials chosen from the newer noble families. Opposition showed itself most clearly when the Riksdag was summoned in 1800 to deal with the financial emergency caused by the cost of the Russian war, which was more than five times the annual budget and was rendered insupportable by two bad harvests. A group of young nobles, headed by Hans Jarta,* demonstrated their *Jacobin' sympathies by demanding that the necessary new taxes should be given a time limit, and when this was refused sought to renounce their peerages. However, all four Estates agreed to a revaluation of the currency, which was successfully completed with the help of a supply of silver obtained by pawning the Mecklenburg port of Wismar.\n\nThe\n\nking also interested himself in agriculture.\n\nAn important\n\npioneering\n\nSkane landowner of Scottish descent named Rutger Maclean, who enclosed his land, resited his farms, abolished work rents and payments in kind, and proved able to secure a bigger income from a more prosperous tenantry. But in spite of earlier legislation, technical progress was held up by the general reluctance to abandon the time-hallowed tenure of scattered strips, and the example set by the Danes since the 1780s even caused the more enterprising among the Sk^ne farmers to emigrate across the Sound. In 1803, therefore, a General Enclosure Act was made for Skane, which after four years was extended to all regions except Dalecarlia, Norrland, and Finland, where land won from the forest did not lend itself to reorganisation. With the help of local agricultural societies and -in 1811 -a Royal Agricultural Academy, Sweden was on the way to becoming a corn-exporting country. In Pomerania the royal interests ranged even wider, for in 1806 enclosure was introduced there as part of a project to attach the province more closely to Sweden by abolishing serfdom, the Diet based on class privilege, and the separate organisation of the Church.\n\nwork had been done by\n\nIn the\n\na\n\nTwin Kingdoms\n\nRegent increased\n\nthe personal authority of the\n\nCrown\n\nPrince\n\n1797 of A.

This tendency was accentuated in 1805, when the Prince placed himself at army headquarters in Holstein; but he was a conscientious administrator of the reforms made in his youth, which continued to work smoothly. His lack of judgement showed, however, in the Patent of September 1806, which took advantage of the formal dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire to proclaim the incorporation of Holstein as a crown possession, thus exacerbating relations with its German population. As regards his Scandinavian subjects, too, the shortcomings to be executed\n\n• 1774-1847: originally Baron Hierta. He played a large part in the drafting of the constitution of 1809, in which he advocated the incorporation of traditional elements, and ended up as the closest Swedish counterpart to Edmund Burke.\n\n198\n\nA\n\nHistory of Scandinavia\n\nof the old order were clearly\n\nshown\n\nmishandling of a novel problem Norway. In 1796 a popular religious movement, broadly similar to the Methodism which had recently aroused so many parts of England and Wales, began under the leadership of a 25-year-old peasant, Hans Nielsen Hauge, who had experienced a sudden conversion, singing a German Pietist hymn as he followed the plough. Like John Wesley, he combined the gifts of the magnetic preacher and winner of souls with those of the practical organiser. in the\n\nthat arose at this juncture in\n\nOn his evangelistic journeys into almost every region of Norway he created groups of 'friends', as he called them, for purposes of religious edification and economic improvement. His message being directed chiefly to his fellow peasants, he came into contact with some who were eager to plant new settlements in the wilds and with a larger number who had moved into the towns, where they needed guidance as to how they might better themselves in face of the hostility of the established inhabitants. Many of Hauge's plans for agricultural, commercial, and industrial activities succeeded, not only on account of his own shrewdness but because his followers had the moral strength and mutual confidence which make for prosperity. Haugeanism aroused immediate suspicion among the authorities in Church and State, accustomed to rule over a generally compHant and wholly unorganised peasant population. Its leader's work was frequently impeded by charges of vagabondism and in 1804 he was confined 1 741, investigation of his activities.\n\nThe\n\nor breach of the Conventicle Act of in\n\nAkershus Castle pending\n\na full\n\nrigours of his imprisonment and his\n\ndisillusionment on finding, like other peasant leaders before him, that he looked in vain to the king as the father of his people broke Hauge's health,\n\nhe was let out on licence when war came, in order to organise emergency salt works. He was finally discharged at Christmas 18 14 on payment of a heavy fine; by then Haugeans had already figured in the first parliament of an independent Norway. In politics, the movement was marked by the same hostility to officialdom - in this case the rationalist clergy - as had been shown by the Norwegian peasantry on other occasions, but this time the peasants had been able to channel their strength into something approaching a nation-wide organisation. In the Church, too, Haugeanism had lasting consequences: although its supporters made no attempt to form a dissenting body, for which the penalties were severe, they provided the nucleus for a laymen's movement, fundamentalist in theology and puritan in its ethics, which is still a force to be reckoned with in many parts of western and south-western Norway. Hauge's teachings were spread to a great extent by tracts, and his secular undertakings included both paper mills and printing works. But in the period when French revolutionary ideas were advancing across Europe, political discussion was restricted throughout Scandinavia by the revival and strengthening of the censorship. In Sweden, indeed, Reuterholm began the reaction against Gustavianism by relaxing the curb on the press. albeit that\n\nThe Impact of European War, iyg2-i8i5 but quickly found\n\nit\n\n199\n\nnecessary to check the vigour of debate by returning to\n\nthe system of penalties imposed in 1774; he even closed down the Swedish Academy. Gustavus IV restored the privileges of the Academy, but detected the presence of a nest of Jacobins in Uppsala University, from which he\n\nwithdrew his patronage; in 1798 all periodicals were placed under supervision, and six years later French newspapers and books were denied admission to the realm. In Denmark-Norway, where the freedom of the press had been perhaps the most valuable result of the short-lived regime of Struensee, liberty of discussion produced no overt act more serious than a strike among the Copenhagen carpenters, but it proved prejudicial to\n\nnew league of armed neutrality. Accordingly, September 1799 a draconian law required all newspapers, periodicals and pamphlets to be submitted to police scrutiny before sale. Two revolutionary writers were banished, and spent the rest of their lives in Paris.* negotiations with Russia for a in\n\nTwo\n\nother factors, however, helped to maintain a generally conservative\n\nThe first was the strength of the economic ties with which tended to turn the attention of the dominant classes away from France. For the Swedish ironmasters Britain was still their most important export market, where high prices were obtainable from the armament industries in spite of Russian competition and the growth of the native output of puddled iron. For the Danish agriculturists it was likewise a market of increasing importance, since a low-grade quality of foreign corn was a welcome import for feeding the rapidly growing industrial population. For the Norwegian timber exporters, too, the needs of wartime Britain spelt high prices and quick sales. The second factor was the lesson which the Scandinavian countries had learnt from previous wars, namely that their remoteness from the main theatres of a European conflict made neutrality possible for them, and that as neutrals they could enjoy the profits both of the carrying trade and of other trades diverted from their climate of opinion.

But it represents a state of public opinion which was widespread throughout Scandinavia during a veritable Golden Age. Even in far-off Iceland the importation in 1806 of sugar was twenty-five times and that of tobacco ten times as great as\n\nit\n\nhad been\n\na generation earlier. ^\n\nREWARDS OF NEUTRALITY 'What power on earth can endanger confederate Scandinavia?' inquired Danish historian^ on a visit to London in 1792.

Each signatory provided eight ships of the line to protect their trade, operating first in the approaches to the Baltic and later in the North Sea as well. The regular export trades, the re-exportation of imports from the colonial empires, and the carrying trade each enjoyed boom conditions; and in 1796-8, when the Royal Navy temporarily lost control of the Mediterranean, the British government actively encouraged neutrals to traffic in those waters. The sequel, however, was a short but bitter struggle over the rights of convoys, which the Scandinavian powers first introduced as a protection against the French, the Danish East Indiamen being escorted home from as far afield as St Helena. After Nelson's victory in Aboukir Bay (August 1798) had eliminated the French fleet from the Mediterranean, the British navy sought to hinder all traffic with French-controlled ports by subjecting convoys to strict visitation and eventual seizure. In the summer of 1800 a Danish frigate oflFered resistance in the English Channel and was captured together with its convoy, whereupon a British envoy was sent to Copenhagen with an escort of seven warships, which cruised in the Sound until the Danes promised to abandon convoying. But the new Danish foreign minister. Christian Bernstorff, had already urged the Russian Tsar Paul to re-form the Armed Neutrality of the North; this was accomplished in November, when the King of Sweden signed an agreement in St Petersburg, to which both Denmark-Norway and Prussia also adhered. However, when the winter ice closed the ports of the inner Baltic, Denmark was effectively isolated from the other Armed Neutrals, so, in January 1801, 149 Danish and Norwegian merchant vessels were seized in British harbours. At the end of March a Danish army corps marched in consequence on Hamburg, where against France\n\nfor\n\nit\n\nsecured possession of British property to the value of\n\nthe\n\nmain\n\ntrial\n\n^(^15\n\nof strength took place in the roadstead off\n\nmillion, but\n\nCopenhagen on\n\nhad passed the heavily fortified by skirting the Swedish shore, where the intervention of the Swedish artillery had been deprecated by the Danes for fear their allies might afterwards claim exemption from the Sound tolls. The Danish fleet had not been made ready for sea; this required six weeks for fitting out the ships and mustering their crews, a decisive step which had been postponed in the hope of avoiding a direct confrontation with the British navy. But public opinion supported the government's decision to resist: in the words of the poet Oehlenschlager (see p. 286), then serving as 2 April.

After six hours was still uncertain, as five British ships of the line were\n\nfighting the issue\n\naground, though the Commander-in-Chief (Sir Hyde Parker) had seven more in reserve to the northward. At this juncture Nelson urged the Crown Prince Regent to break off the engagement, on the plea that otherwise he\n\nbe obliged to set on fire all the Floating-batteries he has taken, without having the power to save the brave Danes who have defended them'.^ The Prince capitulated without consulting his naval commander, which made it all the easier for his subjects to feel that their navy - manned as much by Norwegians as by Danes - had distinguished itself greatly in this 'will\n\nencounter.\n\nThe British fleet sailed on to Karlskrona, but action against the Swedes was suspended when news arrived of the murder of Tsar Paul, which had taken place a week before the battle of Copenhagen. His son, Alexander I, came to terms with the British, so the League of Armed Neutrality was brought to an end, and it was not renewed after the brief intermission in the European war in 1802-3. Neutral commerce nevertheless flourished more than ever. An Anglo- Swedish trade treaty gave liberal concessions over the interpretation of contraband Copenhagen reached the zenith of its prosperity as an entrepot market in these years, especially as Hamburg (from which the Danish forces were quickly withdrawn) came eventually under French control and Norwegian timber, of which the British market absorbed 60 per cent and attracted the more expensive grades, was expor;\n\n;\n\nted in record quantities.\n\nDenmark-Norway appears have been unwise in allowing the carrying trade, by which its subjects were now earning very large profits, to occasion many legalistic claims In the light of later events the government of\n\nto\n\nagainst Britain\n\n:\n\nfor the British resented\n\nany lack of sympathy among the\n\nsmaller powers for their struggle against French control of the continent.\n\nYet the Swedes, who had rather similar interests to protect, did not very\n\nmuch\n\nin the\n\nfare\n\nbetter in spite of Gustavus's decision to take the side of Britain\n\nwar of the Third Coalition.\n\nIn 1803-5 the king of Sweden made a long visit to the court of his fatherin-law, the Grand Duke of Baden, when he learnt to sympathise with the sovereigns whom Napoleon had dispossessed and was by the murder of the Due d'Enghien, whom he had kidnapped from Baden territory. Gustavus therefore ignored his ministers' appeals to him to conserve the profits of neutrality, declared war on France (October 1805), and took command himself in Swedish Pomerania, where he had the support of Russian troops and British subsidies. But he showed no aptitude as a commander within twelve months he had lost his only conquest, the small province of Lauenburg, and he owed it chiefly to his Russian allies that an armistice with the French left his Pomeranian possessions intact. Nevertheless, when the coalition in whose support he had originally been enlisted reached the last stage of its collapse at the peace of Tilsit and\n\nmany minor German horrified\n\n;\n\n202\n\nA\n\nHistory of Scandinavia\n\nRussia became the ally of France, he denounced the armistice. By this time his passionate devotion to legitimism\n\nhad inspired\n\na mystical identification\n\nof Napoleon with the Great Beast of the Apocalypse; but he was also influenced by Canning's promises of fresh subsidies and 10,000 men from the King's Hanoverian Legion to help him maintain the Pomeranian\n\nbridgehead. Within a\n\nmonth\n\nthe Legion was withdrawn from the island\n\nof Riigen for operations against\n\nDenmark, and, although\n\na veteran\n\nSwedish\n\ngeneral contrived to extricate the Swedish forces from what was\n\nnow\n\na\n\nhopeless position in Pomerania, Gustavus returned to Stockholm a broken\n\nman. His subjects still had the British alliance, which gave naval protection Swedish trade, but fearful possibilities lay in the fact that Alexander of Russia now shared with Napoleon the mastery of the whole European\n\nfor\n\nmainland. In 1805 Prince Frederick and his foreign minister had placed themselves with the Danish army in Holstein, hoping to safeguard the neutrality of his possessions against\n\nboth\n\nsides.\n\nIn the light of the experience gained in\n\n80 1 some improvements had been made to the forts protecting Copenhagen, but the fleet was left immobile Danish neutrality might be imperilled by any step which drew attention to an asset whose prospective value to either side in the European war had been enormously increased by Nelson's destruction of the Franco-Spanish fleet at Trafalgar. This situation continued until July 1807, when Canning was apprised of the rumours of the negotiations between Napoleon and Alexander at Tilsit, which reached London at almost the same time as two mistaken reports from British diplomats. One of these alleged that the Danish fleet was being made ready for action in the yards at Copenhagen, the other, that in Holstein the Danes were preparing to close the ports to British trade and accept occupation by the French. It is easy to condemn Canning, who had been brought to the foreign office as protagonist of a vigorous policy only four months before, for acting over-hastily but - like Churchill in a still greater emergency at the time of the battle of Oran in July 1940 - his prime concern was at all costs to secure the island against the risk of invasion by a force which had already overwhelmed western and central Europe. When Canning learnt that he had been misinformed about the Danish intentions, battleships and transports were already on their way to the Sound, accompanied by a 37-year-old diplomat, Francis Jackson, who was given a week in which to obtain the transfer of the Danish fleet to British hands for the duration of the war. A refusal was followed by the landing of about 30,000 men (including the troops from Riigen, already mentioned) north of the Danish capital, which they gradually invested. The Danes ofi^ered very little resistance to these ominous preparations, being reluctant to provoke an attack and having in any case only half as many men on the spot to resist one. Prince Frederick, who had brought his father and the rest 1\n\n:\n\n;\n\nof the royal family south to his headquarters at Kiel, took the strangely\n\noptimistic view that his loyal subjects in\n\nCopenhagen could hold out\n\nfor a\n\nThe Impact of European War, iyg2-i8i5\n\n203\n\ncouple of months; the longer nights would then enable him to ferry the main army across from Holstein without interference by the British fleet. The Commander-in-Chief, Lord Cathcart, would have preferred to starve the city into surrender, but he was reminded by Jackson and others that the possession of the Danish fleet was required immediately. After the loyal but militarily incompetent commandant had rejected three demands for surrender, Cathcart ordered a bombardment which continued for three successive nights. Estimates of the loss of life range as high as\n\n2,000;^ certainly the 14,000 projectiles,\n\nwhich included many of the new on fire the central districts of the\n\nCongreve rockets, succeeded in setting which were not completely rebuilt for a generation. Capitulation in defiance of Prince Frederick's wishes was followed by a six-week occupation of Copenhagen, after which the British expedition returned home with the Danish fleet and 1^2 million worth of naval stores. One consequence of this brutal attack upon an unoflFending neutral was to damage Britain's reputation as an upholder of morality in international relations; another, of immediate practical significance, was to drive the Crown Prince Regent city,\n\nwho was now powerless to\n\nprevent the French from overrunning the Danish\n\nislands as well as Jutland\n\n- into the arms of Napoleon. In October he\n\nsigned an aUiance which bound him not only to enforce the Continental\n\nSystem but\n\nalso to join in\n\nan attack on Sweden.\n\nThus the two by the opposing forces of the supreme land power, uneasily shared between France and Russia, and the supreme sea power, whose frontier was now the European coastline. halves of Scandinavia were pulled in opposite directions\n\nTHE FATEFUL YEARS, 1808-181O So long\n\nas Napoleon's alliance with\n\nAlexander remained even nominally in the long run bring about the defeat of Britain. For the time being, therefore, Scandinavia was second only to the Iberian Peninsula in its importance to both sides - Britain using\n\nin force, his Continental\n\nSystem might\n\nwhich were more by Napoleon's commands, whilst the French (and in principle also the Russians) demanded its strict adherence to the embargo on British trade. One imrhediate consequence was that for nearly two years (from February 1808 to December 1809) the two halves of Scandinavia were once more at war with each other; bearing this in mind, we may conit\n\nas a trade route to the continent to replace those\n\neflFectively closed\n\nsider\n\nDenmark-Norway\n\nfirst.\n\nFrederick VI's long-delayed accession to the throne\n\nat this\n\nmoment*\n\n• Although Christian VII continued to attend Cabinet meetings, he had been king only name since April 1784, when a rescript declared that his personal orders had no authority unless countersigned by the Crown Prince the classic Danish historian of the period terms this *a ver>' clear breach of the Lex Regia'.' His death in March 1808 was due to the shock of seeing Spanish troops (seep. 206) enter Rendsborg in Slesvig, where he had resided since in\n\n;\n\nthe siege of Copenhagen.\n\n204\n\n^\n\nHistory of Scandinavia\n\nrendered the position of the Twin Kingdoms still more hazardous, for he formally abolished the Cabinet {statsrdd) and issued his instructions directly to the Colleges, thus making the will of the monarch more directly felt than before. at\n\nAnd what\n\ncosts\n\nall\n\nas\n\nhe willed was the maintenance of the French alliance\n\nthe only hope of exacting due retribution for Britain's\n\nwanton disregard for his rights as a neutral. The campaign against Sweden, as we shall see (p. 206), proved a disappointment. As for the war at sea, the loss of his last ship of the line in March 1808 left him with no recourse except privateering and the fitting out of numerous small gunboats; these were rowed out to cut off British merchantmen when the frigates protecting a convoy were becalmed. These activities sustained the morale of the Norwegian coastal population; but they were not economically very\n\nsignificant, except to\n\nindividual captors of\n\nprizes.\n\nThe Danish\n\ncolonies passed into British hands; the lucrative carrving\n\ncame abruptly to an end; some 1,400 ships were confiscated; and about 7,000 Norwegian and Danish seamen were confined in the hulks at Chatham and other British ports. Denmark's swift transition from wealth to poverty was marked by rapidly mounting inflation military expenditure vastly exceeded the tax revenue and by 181 capital payments on foreign loans had to be suspended. The situation for the State was all the more ominous because the duchies of SlesvigHolstein proved able to maintain the value of their currencv, which was based on a separate bank at Altona. The Danes nevertheless derived some advantage from their close links with the continent. Corn prices were high, so the farmers profited greatly from their recently won economic independence. Although industry had now to accept the competition of French manufactures, quick fortunes were made by trade under licence and by smuggling. Highly profitable undercover contacts were maintained with the British, who had seized Heligoland m 1807 for commercial access to the mainland and two years later safeguarded their shipping routes by occupying the little island of Anholt in the middle of the Kattegat. The Norwegian economy, on the other hand, was completely vulnerable, both because its overseas trade was oriented predominantly towards the British market and because its southern provinces depended on corn imports from Jutland, which could be entirely cut oflF by the British navy. In the middle years of the long war the king for a time mitigated the distress of his subjects in Norway by issuing licences for timber export which waived his obligations under the Continental System; the British, being very short of timber, not only sent manufactures in return but also relaxed the blockade of Danish corn ships. In general, however, the interruption of all exports brought widespread unemployment. In spite of liberal expenditure by the Danish authorities and the bringing of Russian corn from Archangel trade in colonial wares likewise\n\n;\n\nright\n\ndown\n\n;\n\nthe west coast, south-east\n\nNorway\n\nreceived only one-sixth\n\nThe Impact of European War, Ijg2-i8i^ of\n\nits\n\nregular corn imports.\n\nfor bare survival,\n\nthat\n\nand\n\nin\n\nThe poor\n\nsome\n\n205\n\noften depended on bark bread\n\ndistricts the\n\ncensus of 181 5 was to show\n\nsince the beginning of the century the population had\n\nactually\n\ndiminished.\n\nKing Frederick seems to have appreciated the dangers of the political which Norway was being forced apart from Denmark by the severance of sea communications at a time when Sweden as the ally of Britain might be judged to be a more attractive partner. As soon as the British expedition was mounted against Copenhagen, he had sought to rally Norwegian opinion by appointing a commission of government situation, in\n\n{Regjeringskommtsjon) under Prince Christian August, a distant connection\n\nwho had already made a name in Norway as a comradely commander-in-chief. Business interests were conciliated to some extent by of the royal family\n\nnew\n\ncredit facilities,\n\na separate court of\n\nthough requests\n\nfor a\n\nappeal was set up for\n\nbank of\n\nNorway\n\nissue\n\nwere\n\nstill\n\nrejected;\n\nas well as a prize court\n\nto a provisioning\n\ncommis-\n\nlast-named institution was Count\n\nHerman\n\nand the distribution of foodstuffs was entrusted sion.\n\nThe moving Wedel\n\nspirit in this\n\non the south coast of Norway, who had gained financial experience under Schimmelmann. In December 1809 he canalised the nationalist sentiments of the upper classes into a society to promote their country's welfare, Selskahet for Norges Vel. By that time the king had decided to replace government through commission by sending a royal vice-stattholder, but his two realms continued to be driven apart by the naval situation. Although the long blockade of the coasts of Denmark-Norway undoubtedly promoted the eventual separation of the two countries, the treatment accorded to Iceland indicates that this was not the deliberate aim of British policy. For the fate of the Icelanders, as we have already suggested, depended upon the wishes of the power which was now the undisputed mistress of the seas and as such had a free choice of insular possessions. Yet when the Danish governor and the chief justice* were captured on the high seas in an attempt to run the blockade, they were after some delay allowed to complete their journey to Copenhagen.
