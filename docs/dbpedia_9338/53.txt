History of the Norwegian Money

By 1813 the Danish State was bankrupt and a new monetry system was establised introducing the riksbankdaler. One riksbankdaler equaled 6 marks equals 96 skilling. Or the riksbankdaler was equal to a half riksdaler.

After Norway was separated from Denmark in 1814, the old skillemynt was used up to 1816 when the specidaler replaced the riksbankdaler. The Specidaler was given the value of 5 riksbanksdaler in silver, or 1 specidaler equals 5 ort (mark) equals 120 skilling. The new speciadaler had the same silver content as the old riksdaler specie.

The Danish coins, the riksbankdaler equaled to 96 skilling, were used in Denmark to 1873 and circulated in Norway in part of this period.

In 1875, coins were introduced in denominations of 10 and 50 øre and 1 and 10 kroner. These coins also bore the denomination in the previous currency, as 3, 15, and 30 skillings and 2½ specidaler. Between 1875 and 1878, the new coinage was introduced in full, in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50 øre and 1, 2, and 10 kroner. The 1, 2, and 5 øre were struck in bronze; the 10, 25, and 50 øre and 1 and 2 kroner, in silver; and the 10 and 20 kroner, in gold. The last gold coins were issued in 1910; silver was replaced by cupro-nickel from 1920.
