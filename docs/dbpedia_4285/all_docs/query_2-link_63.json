Try another angel asteroid, yes.\n\nIf the dsc indicates unconscious, karmic mission that drives our interpersonal connections, then your children (both have these?) would be attracted to do-gooders, which is very nice.

They are 4 minutes apart.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nThe people listed above seems to have at least 2 or 3 angel/spiritual asteroids aspecting their angles, luminaries or planets particularly Saturn or Jupiter. Saturn shows a karmic influence and is similar to DNA is some respects. MLK has Saturn conj Angel, Gandhi has Saturn at the GA.\n\n4 people out of 10 have direct NN.\n\nIt would be fun to see if we share any common aspects (or none) with these greats. I'll list a selection of mine here:\n\nAsc - 13.49 Leo\n\nSaturn/St. Michel square Moon (0)\n\nNN semi-sext Raphaela (0)\n\nPallas at GC trine Jupiter (0)\n\nWisdom conj Mars\n\nHorus quincunx Logos (0)\n\nSpirit at SGC\n\nAnd a whole bunch of Gods at the GA - Isis/Osiris/Apollo/Sekhmet\n\nKey Vedic asteroids\n\nAntares conj Vishnu\n\nUranus conj Sita - same as Sri Aurobindo\n\nBalakrishna conj Asc.\n\nPost by lumina on\n\nWEll not that I am a revolutionary or leader, but I have\n\nSoulie conjunct MC in Libra - 2 degrees\n\nAngelica in Scorpio in 12th opposping St Michel in Taurus in 6th - 2 degrees\n\nGrabriella in scorpio in 11th, conjunct Lancelot and some others and closing a Grand trine with Juno and Raphaela in Pisces and Saturn in Cancer (all within 2 degrees)\n\nAngel and Wisdom (and Lust ) both conjunct my ASC on 7 Sagittarius exact\n\nalso conjunct Mars on 5 Sag\n\nconjunct Neptune-NN on 9-10 Sag more widely\n\n(Neptune-NN on Antares)\n\nSun conjunct Mercury on the GC\n\nOriola in Aries in 4th trine Sun-MErcury - 1 degree\n\nCydonia conjunct Perspehone in Virgo in 9th, opposing Jupiter - 1 degree\n\nKnight conjunct Vesta on 1 Cap in 1st house exact, sextile Uranus on 11th house cusp on 1 Scorpio\n\nSpirit on 10 Cap widely conjunct Venus on 6 Cap and Isis-Osiris on 8 Cap (and Guinevere on 10 Cap. lol), sextile Jupiter, but also square Pluto\n\nPsyche on 24 Aqua at the end of 2nd house, conjunct mean Lilith on 24 Aqua exact and sextile Sun-Mercury to one side and Oriola to the other side.\n\nPallas on 9 Aquarius trine Pluto on 9 Libra sextile Neptune-NN on 9-10 Sag\n\nHOrus on 8 Pisces conjunct Ceres on 9 Pisces conjunct Jupiter on 11 PIsces, sextile Isis-Osiris on 8 Cap, conjunct Ishtar on 8 Pisces opposing Hekate on 8 Virgo and then some. lol\n\nAura is conjunct my IC by just 10 minutes of orb, conjunct Alma by 2 degrees, and Gaea as well (and Magion, for what it`s worth. lol)\n\nInteresting that I have Soulie on 6 Libra and Alma on 6 Aries and my MC is on 5 Libra.\n\nI think Compassion is either on MC or IC as well\n\nLogos on 3 Leo in 8th house conjunct Priapus on 00 Leo (and Hypnos on 6 Leo), is part of a Grand trine with Amor-Mars 2-5 Sag and of course Aura-IC on 4 Aries, also squares Uranus on 1 Scorpio though.\n\nI think most striking of these I find\n\nAngel-Wisdom on my ASC\n\nthe minor triangle of Pallas-Pluto-Neptune/NN\n\nAura-Alma-Gaea-(Magion) on IC as part of a Grand trine with Amor-Mars (on ASC) and Logos.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nWould like to take this further and check if other asteroids for heroic actions or taking a stand might be predominant in their charts. Please feel free to add any asteroids you wish to.\n\nI think these might be important:\n\n1868 Thersites - a Greek free speech hero\n\n\"Thersites, the only common soldier mentioned by Homer in the Iliad, must have been an extraordinary man, for he had the guts to tell his comrades, their king Agamemnon and his officers, that they had been sent on a fool's errand, chasing after a silly twit named Helen who ran off with young Paris................ And for his pains Thersites was savagely beaten by Odysseus, killed by Achilles, and portrayed by the aristophile Homer in the most calculated, cruel and derisive manner, all for telling the simple truth. \" www.networkcentralca.net/thersites.htm\n\n8990 Compassion - this is self-explanatory. People demanding justice for the poor, marginalised or oppressed must have this quality.\n\nPost by Ava on\n\n@astrokeen said:\n\n1868 Thersites - a Greek free speech hero\n\n\"Thersites, the only common soldier mentioned by Homer in the Iliad, must have been an extraordinary man, for he had the guts to tell his comrades, their king Agamemnon and his officers, that they had been sent on a fool's errand, chasing after a silly twit named Helen who ran off with young Paris................

Thank you.\n\nI have this asteroid on my ascendant.\n\nedit\n\nPost by FruityLlama on\n\nI looked at Logos in my chart because it means 'reason' in modern greek. In asteroid terms I like to think of this as being 'reasonable'.\n\nI have it trine my moon and square pluto, Angel sextile my sun and squares Venus exact, Thersites sextile moon, Truth sextiles my Uranus and trine Pluto- I find this the most interesting because I think it describes my attitude well. Compassion is conjunct my sun in the 11th.\n\nPallas doesn't do an awful lot, but I am a 'Classical Liberal'. One of my favourite classical liberal commentators has Pallas on their Sun though!\n\nIts hard to sift through to get to the truth when there is so much crap in the media and so many different agendas going on.\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nAva , very interesting aspects you've got. As you said, Thersites is significant for those who will stick their necks out and take a beating for it, if it comes to that. I believe he first stood up in the Greek assembly to voice his dissension, which given his commoner background, was unheard of.\n\nI have it conjunct my Sun and I was, through my teens and early twenties in particular, the person who belled the cat. I spoke out in public when others thought it more judicious to keep silent. Now, I keep the speaking out only for very important issues.\n\nFruityLlama , you seem to have lovely asteroids prominent in your chart . Logos has an alternative meaning as well. Logos in Christianity is understood to represent Christ, divinty or the Angel of the lord.\n\n\"In Christology, the Logos (Greek: Λόγος, lit. ''Word\", \"Discourse\", or \"Reason'') is a name or title of Jesus Christ, derived from the prologue to the Gospel of John (c 100) \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\".\n\n\"The Logos is God active in creation, revelation, and redemption. Jesus Christ not only gives God's Word to us humans; he is the Word.\"\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos_(Christianity)\n\nLogos is very slow moving, however, and can be generational if conjunct outer planets. And since it is slow moving, aspects must be kept tight."
