        "text": "The successful introduction of Greek studies to Western Europe in the late fourteenth century was soon followed by Latin translations of numerous Greek texts produced by Western and Byzantine scholars of the time. The chapter focuses on the latter, especially the late and post-Byzantine scholars who arrived in Italy before and after the Fall of Constantinople and engaged in rendering classical, mediaeval or contemporary Greek texts, pagan and patristic, into Latin. Furthermore, it traces the diffusion of their Latin versions that were printed from the mid-fifteenth to late sixteenth century. All the versions that reached at least one printing house until 1600 are reviewed, along with any possible geographical and chronological fluctuations. The discussion of their editions leads to conclusions on the texts and authors that appealed mostly to the scholars of the time, the most influential translators, the European printing centres and their shifts over time, the printers and their preferences in particular texts and translators, and other aspects related to the dissemination of these translations.\n\nThe 50th Spring Symposium of Byzantine Studies Centre for Byzantine, Ottoman and Modern Greek Studies, University of Birmingham For its 50th anniversary, the Spring Symposium of Byzantine Studies returns to the University of Birmingham, where it began in 1967. On this anniversary of the discipline we ask what the language of globalism has to offer to Byzantine studies, and Byzantine studies to global narratives. How global was Byzantium? Our understanding of the links which Byzantium had to far-flung parts of the world, and of its connections with near neighbours, continues to develop but the significance of these connections to Byzantium and its interlocutors remains keenly debated. Comparisons from or to Byzantium may also help in thinking about globalism, modern and historical. How, for example, might Byzantine legal structures, visual culture or military practice contribute to debates about the role of the medieval state or the relationship between modern cultural and national identities? Byzantine studies has always been an international discipline, marked by the interaction of its different national, regional and linguistic traditions of scholarship, as well as its highly interdisciplinary nature. How has this manifested in the interpretation of Byzantine history and how might practices of global scholarship be pursued in the future.\n\nMaximus the Greek born as Mikhail Trivolis in the Greek town of Arta, received his humanist education in North Italy, particularly in Florence and Venice, where he was engaged in the process of the first editions of printed books and where he would constantly deal with manuscript samples. The paper shows how Maximus the Greek managed to create his own, deeply personal language and to express the complexity of Byzantine patristic, hagiographic and iconographic issues. Finally, he successfully established his Orthodox theological system, significantly marked with the poetic effect that strongly inspired his theological works."
