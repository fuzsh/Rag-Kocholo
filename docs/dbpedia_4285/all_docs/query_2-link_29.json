        "text": "CCD Photometric observations of 11 Trojan asteroids from the L4 (Trojan) Lagrange point were obtained at the Center for Solar System Studies (CS3, MPC U81). For several years, CS3 has been conducting a study of Jovian Trojan asteroids. This is another in a series of papers reporting data analysis being accumulated for family pole and shape model studies. It is anticipated that for most Jovian Trojans, two to five dense lightcurves per target at oppositions well distributed in ecliptic longitudes will be needed and can be supplemented with reliable sparse data for the brighter Trojan asteroids. For all of these targets we were able to get preliminary pole positions and create shape models from sparse data and the dense lightcurves obtained to date. These preliminary models will be improved as more data are acquired at future oppositions and will be published at a later date.\n\nlists the telescopes and CCD cameras that were used to make the observations. Images were unbinned with no filter and had master flats and darks applied. The exposures depended upon various factors including magnitude of the target, sky motion, and Moon illumination.\n\nImage processing, measurement, and period analysis were done using MPO Canopus (Bdw Publishing), which incorporates the Fourier analysis algorithm (FALC) developed by Harris (Harris et al., 1989). The Comp Star Selector feature in MPO Canopus was used to limit the comparison stars to near solar color. Night-tonight calibration was done using field stars from the CMC-15 or the ATLAS catalog (Tonry et al., 2018), which has Sloan griz magnitudes that were derived from the GAIA and Pan-STARR catalogs, among others. The authors state that systematic errors are generally no larger than 0.005 mag, although they can reach 0.02 mag in small areas near the Galactic plane. BVRI magnitudes were derived by Warner using formulae from Kostov and Bonev (2017). The overall errors for the BVRI magnitudes, when combining those in the ATLAS catalog and the conversion formulae, are on the order of 0.04–0.05 mag.\n\nEven so, we found in most cases that nightly zero point adjustments for the ATLAS catalog to be on the order of only 0.02–0.03 mag were required during period analysis. There were occasional exceptions that required up to 0.10 mag. These may have been related in part to using unfiltered observations, poor centroiding of the reference stars, and not correcting for second-order extinction terms. Regardless, the systematic errors seem to be considerably less than other catalogs, which reduces the uncertainty in the results when analysis involves data from extended periods or the asteroid is tumbling.\n\nIn the lightcurve plots, the Y-axis may be labeled “Reduced Magnitude” or “Magnitude.” Unless otherwise indicated, the values are Johnson V. The latter are sky (catalog-derived) magnitudes while “Reduced Magnitude” indicates that sky magnitudes were corrected to unity distances by applying −5*log (rΔ) to the measured sky magnitudes, with r and Δ being, respectively, the Sun-asteroid and the Earth-asteroid distances in AU. The magnitudes were normalized to the phase angle given in parentheses using G = 0.15. The X-axis rotational phase ranges from −0.05 to 1.05.\n\nThe amplitude indicated in the plots (e.g. Amp. 0.23) is the amplitude of the Fourier model curve and not necessarily the adopted amplitude of the lightcurve.\n\nTargets were selected for this L4 observing campaign based upon the availability of dense lightcurves acquired in previous years. We obtained two to four lightcurves for most of these Trojans at previous oppositions.\n\nFor brevity, only some of the previously reported rotational periods may be referenced. A complete list is available at the lightcurve database (LCDB; Warner et al., 2009)."
