        "text": "Template: Infobox Asteroid / Maintenance / Error 1\n\n( 7210 ) Darius is an asteroid of the outer main belt, which was discovered on 24 September 1960 by the Dutch astronomer Cornelis Johannes van Houten couple and Ingrid van Houten - Groeneveld. The discovery came as part of the Palomar - Leiden Survey, which recorded by Tom Gehrels with the 120 - inch Oschin Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory field plates at Leiden University were screened.\n\nThe eccentricity of the asteroid is rounded 0.0074 low so that its orbit around the sun is quite close to an ideal circular path, similar to the eccentricity of the planet Venus ( 0.0068 ). It is still significantly less than the eccentricity of the Earth ( 0.0167 ).\n\n( 7210 ) Darius is a member of the Koronis family, a group of asteroids that is named after (158 ) Koronis. The timeless ( nichtoskulierenden ) orbital elements of ( 7210 ) Darius are almost identical with those of seven smaller when one of the absolute brightness of 14.2, 14.4, 15.4, 15.8, 16.3, 16.0 and 17.1 against 12.6 emanates, asteroids: ( 11201 ) Talich, ( 55691 ) 3028 T-2, ( 88045 ) 2000 VC5, ( 170751 ) 2004 BC163, ( 173801 ) 2001 SE225, ( 179 322 ) in 2001 and WF44 ( 355068) 2006 SC219.\n\nAfter FORMING classification (Small Main -Belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey) were assumed in ( 7210 ) Darius from a bright surface with a spectroscopic investigation of Gianluca Masi, Sergio Foglia and Richard P. Binzel, it might be so, roughly speaking, to act an S- asteroids.\n\n( 7210 ) is named after Darius Darius I, a great king of the Persian Achaemenid Empire. The appointment was made on 16 October 1997. Darius is the Latin form of Darius. , Often called Darius I Darius the Great, applies not only to Cyrus II as the most important of the ancient Persian empire great king. After Cyrus II the asteroid main belt of the middle ( 7209 ) Cyrus was named."
