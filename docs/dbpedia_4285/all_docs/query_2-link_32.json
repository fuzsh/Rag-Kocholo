I found it enchanting. Great to check related asteroids:\n\nThe most prominent in my natal is Thersites, amongst many others.\n\nSun - Sco 1.35\n\nThersites - Sco 1,39\n\nAjax - Sco 2.35\n\nThersites apparently was a free speech hero, the first of his kind.\n\n\"Thersites, the only common soldier mentioned by Homer in the Iliad, must have been an extraordinary man, for he had the guts to tell his comrades, their king Agamemnon and his officers, that they had been sent on a fool's errand, chasing after a silly twit named Helen who ran off with young Paris................ And for his pains Thersites was savagely beaten by Odysseus, killed by Achilles, and portrayed by the aristophile Homer in the most calculated, cruel and derisive manner, all for telling the simple truth. \" http://www.networkcentralca.net/thersites.htm\n\n\"Homer shows a distinct class bias in his very description of Thersites.\" He represented his as a vile and repulsive man, one who, despite his class, dared to challenge the nobility.\n\nI must admit I am rather pleased to have Thersites on my Sun. I can see how this might apply to me as I've often spoken out or challenged authority. Innumerable times. I was always the person who stepped forward to bell the cat, so to speak, and, fortunately, this trait was put to some practical use as I worked to promote minority rights.\n\nAgamemnon/Menelaus/Achilles/Hera conjunction in 3rd house Libra (24 to 26 degrees -lotsa kings!!?)\n\nHera is at my Mars/Venus midpoint.\n\nAneas conjunct SN (1)\n\nParis conjunct Troilus (0) trine Sun/Tersites (0)\n\nNestor conjunct Mercury (0)\n\nposted September 06, 2014 12:06 AM Sun conjunct Helena!!! That I can believe .\n\nI've just noticed that the bad guys (the Greeks) or the anti-Trojans are grouped together at 25 Leo in my natal, whilst the good guys (Greek challengers) are aspecting the Sun. Interesting!\n\nI wonder if 25 Leo is a point that presents a key challenge.\n\nSabian - A LARGE CAMEL IS SEEN CROSSING A VAST AND FORBIDDING DESERT.\n\nKEYNOTE: Self-sufficiency in the face of a long and exhausting adventure.\n\nThe suggestion here is that in order to be released from bondage to the \"old world\" we should be completely self-contained emotionally. So the call for independence is paramount.\n\nWow! I think this resonates very much with the great challenge in my life."
