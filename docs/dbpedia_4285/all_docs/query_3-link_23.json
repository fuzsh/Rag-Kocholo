        "text": "Taurine Bromamine: Reactivity of an Endogenous and Exogenous Anti-Inflammatory and Antimicrobial Amino Acid Derivative\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBertozo, Luiza De Carvalho; Morgon, Nelson Henrique; De Souza, Aguinaldo Robinson; Ximenes, Valdecir Farias\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTaurine bromamine (Tau-NHBr) is produced by the reaction between hypobromous acid (HOBr) and the amino acid taurine. There are increasing number of applications of Tau-NHBr as an anti-inflammatory and microbicidal drug for topical usage. Here, we performed a comprehensive study of the chemical reactivity of Tau-NHBr with endogenous and non-endogenous compounds. Tau-NHBr reactivity was compared with HOBr, hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and taurine chloramine (Tau-NHCl). The second-order rate constants (k2) for the reactions between Tau-NHBr and tryptophan (7.7 Ã 102 Mâ1sâ1), melatonin (7.3 Ã 103 Mâ1sâ1), serotonin (2.9 Ã 103 Mâ1sâ1), dansylglycine (9.5 Ã 101 Mâ1sâ1), tetramethylbenzidine (6.4 Ã 102 Mâ1sâ1) and H2O2 (3.9 Ã Mâ1sâ1) were obtained. Tau-NHBr demonstrated the following selectivity regarding its reactivity with free amino acids: tryptophan > cysteine ~ methionine > tyrosine. The reactivity of Tau-NHBr was strongly affected by the pH of the medium (for instance with dansylglycine: pH 5.0, 1.1 Ã 104 Mâ1sâ1, pH 7.0, 9.5 Ã 10 Mâ1sâ1 and pH 9.0, 1.7 Ã 10 Mâ1sâ1), a property that is related to the formation of the dibromamine form at acidic pH (Tau-NBr2). The formation of singlet oxygen was observed in the reaction between Tau-NHBr and H2O2. Tau-NHBr was also able to react with linoleic acid, but with low efficiency compared with HOBr and HOCl. Compared with HOBr, Tau-NHBr was not able to react with nucleosides. In conclusion, the following reactivity sequence was established: HOBr > HOCl > Tau-NHBr > Tau-NHCl. These findings can be very helpful for researchers interested in biological applications of taurine haloamines.

Specifying indications implies also stating contraindications.Combined supplementation of amino acids with Ï3-fatty acids and/or trace elements (immune-enhancing diets) will not be considered in this review because these mixtures do not allow the role of amino acids in the effect (positive or negative) of the mixture to be isolated, and so cannot show whether or not supplementation of a given amino acid is indicated. After decades of unbridled use of glutamine (GLN) supplementation in critically ill patients, recent large trials have brought a note of caution, indicating for example that GLN should not be used in patients with multiple organ failure. Yet these large trials do not change the conclusions of recent meta-analyses. Arginine (ARG), as a single dietary supplement, is probably not harmful in critical illness, in particular in a situation of ARG deficiency syndrome with low nitric oxide production. Citrulline supplementation strongly improves microcirculation in animal models with gut injury, but clinical studies are lacking. Taurine has a potent protective effect against ischemic reperfusion injury. Amino acid-based pharmaconutrition has displayed familiar 'big project' stages: enthusiasm (citrulline and taurine), doubt (GLN), hunt for the guilty (ARG), and backpedalling (leucine). Progress in this field is very slow, and sometimes gives way to retreat, as demonstrated by recent large trials on GLN supplementation.\n\nTaurine and taurine-deficiency in the perinatal period.\n\nPubMed\n\nAerts, Leona; Van Assche, Frans AndrÃ©\n\n2002-01-01\n\nTaurine, a non-protein sulfur amino-acid, is the most abundant free amino-acid in the body and plays an important role in several essential biological processes. Apart from its role in cholesterol degradation, it acts as neurotransmitter, and has a function as osmoregulator and antioxidant in most body tissues. During pregnancy, taurine accumulates in the maternal tissues, to be released in the perinatal period to the fetus via the placenta and to the newborn via the maternal milk. It is accumulated especially in the fetal and neonatal brain. Low maternal taurine levels result in low fetal taurine levels. Taurine-deficiency in the mother leads to growth retardation of the offspring, and to impaired perinatal development of the central nervous system and of the endocrine pancreas. The adult offspring of taurine-deficient mothers display signs of impaired neurological function, impaired glucose tolerance and vascular dysfunction; they may develop gestational diabetes and transmit the effects to the next generation. This transgeneration effect of taurine-deficiency in the perinatal period fits into the concept of fetal origin of adult disease.\n\nTaurine is absent from amino components in fruits of Opuntia ficus-indica.\n\nPubMed\n\nAli, Hatem Salama Mohamed; Al-Khalifa, Abdulrahman Saleh; BrÃ¼ckner, Hans\n\n2014-01-01\n\nJuices of edible fruits from Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Miller, commonly named prickly pears or Indian figs, were analysed for amino acids using an automated amino acid analyser run in the high-resolution physiological mode. Emphasis was put on the detection of free taurine (Tau), but Tau could be detected neither in different cultivars of prickly pears from Italy, South Africa and the Near East nor in commercially available prickly pear juices from the market.\n\nFree amino acids in spider hemolymph.\n\nPubMed\n\nTillinghast, Edward K; Townley, Mark A\n\n2008-11-01\n\nWe examined the free amino acid composition of hemolymph from representatives of five spider families with an interest in knowing if the amino acid profile in the hemolymph of orb-web-building spiders reflects the high demands for small organic compounds in the sticky droplets of their webs. In nearly all analyses, on both orb and non-orb builders, glutamine was the most abundant free amino acid. Glycine, taurine, proline, histidine, and alanine also tended to be well-represented in orb and non-orb builders. While indications of taxon-specific differences in amino acid composition were observed, it was not apparent that two presumptive precursors (glutamine, taurine) of orb web sticky droplet compounds were uniquely enriched in araneids (orb builders). However, total amino acid concentrations were invariably highest in the araneids and especially so in overwintering juveniles, even as several of the essential amino acids declined during this winter diapause. Comparing the data from this study with those from earlier studies revealed a number of discrepancies. The possible origins of these differences are discussed.\n\n21 CFR 573.980 - Taurine.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2014 CFR\n\n2014-04-01\n\n..., AND RELATED PRODUCTS FOOD ADDITIVES PERMITTED IN FEED AND DRINKING WATER OF ANIMALS Food Additive Listing Â§ 573.980 Taurine.

Our objective was to establish how much taurine is released in the striatum and examine the mechanisms controlling extracellular taurine concentrations under resting conditions. The experiments were made on rats by microdialysis in vivo. Changes in taurine were compared with those in glutamate, glycine and the non-neuroactive amino acid threonine. Using the zero net flux approach we showed the extracellular concentration of taurine to be 25.2 +/- 5.1 muM. Glutamate was increased by tetrodotoxin and decreased by Ca2+ omission, glycine and threonine were not affected and both treatments increased extracellular taurine. The basal taurine release was increased by the taurine transport inhibitor guanidinoethanesulfonate and reduced by the anion channel blocker 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid.\n\nForced swimming and imipramine modify plasma and brain amino acid concentrations in mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nMurakami, Tatsuro; Yamane, Haruka; Tomonaga, Shozo; Furuse, Mitsuhiro\n\n2009-01-05\n\nThe relationships between monoamine metabolism and forced swimming or antidepressants have been well studied, however information is lacking regarding amino acid metabolism under these conditions. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of forced swimming and imipramine on amino acid concentrations in plasma, the cerebral cortex and the hypothalamus in mice. Forced swimming caused cerebral cortex concentrations of L-glutamine, L-alanine, and taurine to be increased, while imipramine treatment caused decreased concentrations of L-glutamate, L-alanine, L-tyrosine, L-methionine, and L-ornithine. In the hypothalamus, forced swimming decreased the concentration of L-serine while imipramine treatment caused increased concentration of beta-alanine. Forced swimming caused increased plasma concentration of taurine, while concentrations of L-serine, L-asparagine, L-glutamine and beta-alanine were decreased. Imipramine treatment caused increased plasma concentration of all amino acid, except for L-aspartate and taurine. In conclusion, forced swimming and imipramine treatment modify central and peripheral amino acid metabolism. These results may aid in the identification of amino acids that have antidepressant-like effects, or may help to refine the dosages of antidepressant drugs.\n\nEffects of graded taurine levels on juvenile cobia\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nTaurine, which has multiple important physiological roles in teleost fish and mammals, is an amino acid not found in alternative protein sources not derived from animals.

Although taurine is classified as an amino acid, it does not participate in peptide bond formation. Nonetheless, the amino group of taurine is involved in a number of important conjugation reactions as well as in the scavenging of hypochlorous acid. Because taurine is a fairly inert compound, it is an ideal modulator of basic processes, such as osmotic pressure, cation homeostasis, enzyme activity, receptor regulation, cell development and cell signalling. The present review discusses several physiological functions of taurine. First, the observation that taurine depletion leads to the development of a cardiomyopathy indicates a role for taurine in the maintenance of normal contractile function. Evidence is provided that this function of taurine is mediated by changes in the activity of key Ca2+ transporters and the modulation Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofibrils. Second, in some species, taurine is an established osmoregulator, however, in mammalian heart the osmoregulatory function of taurine has recently been questioned. Third, taurine functions as an indirect regulator of oxidative stress. Although this action of taurine has been widely discussed, its mechanism of action is unclear. A potential mechanism for the antioxidant activity of taurine is discussed. Fourth, taurine stabilizes membranes through direct interactions with phospholipids. However, its inhibition of the enzyme, phospholipid N-methyltransferase, alters the phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine content of membranes, which in turn affects the function of key proteins within the membrane. Finally, taurine serves as a modulator of protein kinases and phosphatases within the cardiomyocyte. The mechanism of this action has not been studied.

Taurine is one of the most abundant free amino acids in mammals tissues and is one of the three well-known sulfur-containing amino acids; the others are methionine and cysteine which are considered as the precursors for taurine synthesis. Different scientific studies emphasize on the cytoprotective properties of taurine which included antioxidation, antiapoptosis, membrane stabilization, osmoregulation, and neurotransmission. Protective and therapeutic ameliorations of oxidative stress-induced pathologies were also attributed to taurine both in experimental and human models. Data demonstrating the beneficial effectiveness of taurine against type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus and their complications are growing and providing a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. Although the clinical studies are limited compared to the experimental ones, the present updated systematic review of the literature is set up to provide experimental and clinical evidences regarding the effectiveness of taurine in the context of diabetes mellitus and its complications. Gathering these scientific effects of taurine on diabetes mellitus could provide the physicians and specially the endocrinologists with a comprehensive overview on possible trends in the prevention and management of the disease and its complications through antioxidant supplementation.

In the presence of a sodium gradient across the membranes (vesicle inside less than vesicle outside), an overshooting uptake of taurine occurred. In the presence of other ion gradients (K+, Li+, and choline+), taurine uptake was very small and no such overshoot was observed. Sodium-dependent uptake of taurine occurred into an osmotically active intravesicular space. Taurine uptake was stimulated by preloading vesicles with unlabeled taurine (transstimulation) in the presence of NaCl, but not in the presence of KCl. Sodium-dependent transport followed saturation kinetics with respect to taurine concentration; double-reciprocal plots of uptake versus taurine concentration gave a straight line from which an apparent Km value of 0.38 mM and Vmax of 0.27 nmol/20 s x mg of protein were obtained. Valinomycin-induced K+-diffusion potential failed to enhance the rate of taurine uptake, suggesting that taurine transport does not depend on membrane potential. Taurine transport was inhibited by structurally related omega-amino acids, such as beta-alanine and gamma-aminobutyric acid, but not by glycine, epsilon-aminocaproic acid, or other alpha-amino acids, such as L-alanine. These results suggest that Na+-dependent uptake of taurine might occur across the hepatic sinusoidal plasma membranes via a transport system that is specific for omega-amino acids having 2-3 carbon chain length.\n\nContent and traffic of taurine in hippocampal reactive astrocytes.\n\nPubMed\n\nJunyent, FÃ¨lix; De Lemos, Luisa; Utrera, Juana; Paco, Sonia; Aguado, Fernando; Camins, Antoni; PallÃ s, MercÃ¨; Romero, Rafael; Auladell, Carme\n\n2011-02-01\n\nTaurine is one of the most abundant free amino acids in the mammalian central nervous system, where it is crucial to proper development. Moreover, taurine acts as a neuroprotectant in various diseases; in epilepsy, for example, it has the capacity to reduce or abolish seizures. In the present study, taurine levels has been determine in mice treated with Kainic Acid (KA) and results showed an increase of this amino acid in hippocampus but not in whole brain after 3 and 7 days of KA treatment. This increase occurs when gliosis was observed. Moreover, taurine transporter (TAUT) was found in astrocytes 3 and 7 days after KA treatment, together with an increase in cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (csd) mRNA, that codifies for the rate-limiting enzyme of taurine synthesis, in the hippocampus at the same times after KA treatment. Glial cultures enriched in astrocytes were developed to demonstrate that these cells are responsible for changes in taurine levels after an injury to the brain. The cultures were treated with proinflammatory cytokines to reproduce gliosis. In this experimental model, an increase in the immunoreactivity of GFAP was observed, together with an increase in CSD and taurine levels. Moreover, an alteration in the taurine uptake-release kinetics was detected in glial cells treated with cytokine. All data obtained indicate that astrocytes could play a key role in taurine level changes induced by neuronal damage. More studies are, therefore, needed to clarify the role taurine has in relation to neuronal death and repair.

Various causes of maternal stress during the lactation period, relating to, for example, maternal nutritional status and reduced maternal care, have been considered. However, little is known about the effects on milk of maternal stress during the lactation period. The current study aimed to determine whether free amino acids, with special reference to sulfur-containing amino acids in milk, are altered by restraint stress in lactating mice. The dams in the stress group were restrained for 30 min at postnatal days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. Restraint stress caused a reduction in the body weight of lactating mice. The concentration of taurine and cystathionine in milk was significantly higher in the stress group, though stress did not alter their concentration in maternal plasma. The ratio of taurine concentration in milk to its concentration in maternal plasma was significantly higher in the stress group, suggesting that stress promoted taurine transportation into milk. Furthermore, taurine concentration in milk was positively correlated with corticosterone levels in plasma. In conclusion, restraint stress in lactating mice caused the changes in the metabolism and in the transportation of sulfur-containing amino acids and resulted in higher taurine concentration in milk. Taurine concentration in milk could also be a good parameter for determining stress status in dams.\n\nTaurine and neural cell damage.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaransaari, P; Oja, S S\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe inhibitory amino acid taurine is an osmoregulator and neuromodulator, also exerting neuroprotective actions in neural tissue. We review now the involvement of taurine in neuron-damaging conditions, including hypoxia, hypoglycemia, ischemia, oxidative stress, and the presence of free radicals, metabolic poisons and an excess of ammonia. The brain concentration of taurine is increased in several models of ischemic injury in vivo. Cell-damaging conditions which perturb the oxidative metabolism needed for active transport across cell membranes generally reduce taurine uptake in vitro, immature brain tissue being more tolerant to the lack of oxygen. In ischemia nonsaturable diffusion increases considerably. Both basal and K+-stimulated release of taurine in the hippocampus in vitro is markedly enhanced under cell-damaging conditions, ischemia, free radicals and metabolic poisons being the most potent. Hypoxia, hypoglycemia, ischemia, free radicals and oxidative stress also increase the initial basal release of taurine in cerebellar granule neurons, while the release is only moderately enhanced in hypoxia and ischemia in cerebral cortical astrocytes. The taurine release induced by ischemia is for the most part Ca2+-independent, a Ca2+-dependent mechanism being discernible only in hippocampal slices from developing mice. Moreover, a considerable portion of hippocampal taurine release in ischemia is mediated by the reversal of Na+-dependent transporters. The enhanced release in adults may comprise a swelling-induced component through Cl- channels, which is not discernible in developing mice. Excitotoxic concentrations of glutamate also potentiate taurine release in mouse hippocampal slices. The ability of ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists to evoke taurine release varies under different cell-damaging conditions, the N-methyl-D-aspartate-evoked release being clearly receptor-mediated in ischemia. Neurotoxic ammonia has been shown to provoke taurine release from\n\nAmino acid neurotransmitter release and learning: a study of visual imprinting.\n\nPubMed\n\nMeredith, R M; McCabe, B J; Kendrick, K M; Horn, G\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe intermediate and medial part of the hyperstriatum ventrale (IMHV) is an area of the domestic chick forebrain that stores information acquired through the learning process of imprinting. The effects of visual imprinting on the release of the amino acids aspartate, arginine, citrulline, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, glycine and taurine from the left and right IMHVs in vitro were measured at 3.5, 10 and 24 h after training. Chicks were exposed to an imprinting stimulus for 1 h, their preferences measured 10 min afterward and a preference score calculated as a measure of the strength of learning. Potassium stimulation was used to evoke amino acid release from the IMHVs of trained and untrained chicks in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+. Ca2+-dependent, K+-evoked release of glutamate was significantly (34.4%) higher in trained than in untrained chicks. This effect was not influenced by time after training or by side (left or right IMHV). Training influenced the evoked release of GABA and taurine from the left IMHV at both 3.5 and 10 h. The training effects at the two times were statistically homogeneous so data (< or = 10 h group) were combined for each amino acid respectively. For this < or = 10 h group, evoked release increased significantly with preference score. In contrast, for the 24 h group, evoked release of GABA and taurine was not significantly correlated with preference score. There were no significant correlations between preference score and GABA or taurine release in the right IMHV at any time, nor in the absence of extracellular calcium. No significant effects of training condition, time or side were observed for any other amino acid in the study. The present findings suggest that soon after chicks have been exposed to an imprinting stimulus glutamatergic excitatory transmission in IMHV is enhanced, and remains enhanced for at least 24 h. In contrast, the learning-related elevations in taurine and GABA release are not\n\nTaurine transport into fetal cord blood cells: inhibition by cyclosporine A.\n\nPubMed\n\nSpeake, Paul F; Zipitis, Christos S; Houston, Angela; D'Souza, Stephen\n\n2004-10-01\n\nPregnant women undergoing long-term organ transplant treatment have an increased incidence of delivering infants with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Cyclosporine A is used as an immunosuppressant in such women and indirect evidence suggests that IUGR might result from an effect of cyclosporine A on amino acid transport by the placenta. In this study we tested the hypothesis that the transport of an essential amino acid, taurine, by fetal tissue other than the placenta is modulated by cyclosporine A. Cord blood cells (CBCs) were used to test this hypothesis as an easily obtainable fetal tissue. Transport of taurine into CBCs was measured using standard tracer flux assays. Uptake of [(3)H] taurine by CBCs was linear over 15 minutes (76.2 +/- 16.6 fmol/10(6) cells/min, mean +/- SEM, n = 6) and inhibitable by 10 mM beta-alanine, a substrate of the system-beta taurine transport protein (6.7 +/- 1.0 fmol/10(6) cells/min, n = 6, P <.05, paired Student t test). Pre-incubation with cyclosporine A (5 microM) inhibited [(3)H] taurine uptake by 29.3%-5.3% (n = 8, P <.05, paired Student t test). These data show that amino acid transport via system-beta can be measured in CBCs and may be a useful model for amino acid transport studies in fetal cells. We also show that system-beta was inhibited by the immunosuppressant, cyclosporine A. This suggests that the increased incidence of IUGR reported in mothers treated with cyclosporine A may be due partially to effects on taurine uptake into fetal cells outside the placenta.\n\nTaurine in pediatric nutrition: review and update.\n\nPubMed\n\nGaull, G E\n\n1989-03-01\n\nTaurine was long considered an end product of the metabolism of the sulfur-containing amino acids, methionine and cyst(e)ine. Its only clearly recognized biochemical role had been as a substrate in the conjugation of bile acids. Taurine is found free in millimolar concentrations in animal tissues, particularly those that are excitable, rich in membranes, and generate oxidants. Various lines of evidence suggest one major nutritional role as protecting cell membranes by attenuating toxic substances and/or by acting as an osmoregulator. The totality of evidence suggests that taurine is nonessential in the rodent, it is an essential amino acid in the cat, and it is conditionally essential in man and monkey. Absence from the diet of a conditionally essential nutrient does not produce immediate deficiency disease but, in the long term, can cause problems. Taurine is now added to many infant formulas as a measure of prudence to provide improved nourishment with the same margin of safety for its newly identified physiologic functions as that found in human milk. Such supplementation can be justified by the finding of improved fat absorption in preterm infants and in children with cystic fibrosis, as well as by salutary effects on auditory brainstem-evoked responses in preterm infants. Experimental findings in animal models and in human cell models provide further justification for taurine supplementation of infant formulas.\n\n[Influence of oral contraceptive agents on the concentration of amino acids in leukocytes of supposedly healthy women (author's transl)].\n\nPubMed\n\nTarallo, P; Houpert, Y; Siest, G\n\n1977-12-15\n\nThe concentration of amino acids has been measured in leukocytes of women taking oral contraceptive agents and also in controls. These assays were made by means of ion exchange chromatography. The amino acid pool in leukocytes was found to be smaller in those patients taking the \"pill\". Each amino acid concentration decreased except for taurine and glutamine. Taurine represented 64.1 percent of the pool in treated women and only 23.5 percent in controls. Glutamine represented 9.5 percent of the pool in patients and 3.7 percent in controls.\n\nEffects of Ï-Amino Acids and Related Compounds on Staphylococcal Infections in Mice: a Combined Prophylactic-Therapeutic Procedure 1\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTsuchiya, Yoshiki; Tanaka, Kinji; Cook, Elton S.; Nutini, Leo G.\n\n1970-01-01\n\nBy a short-term combined prophylactic-therapeutic procedure, the following compounds were found to be active against staphylococcal infections in Swiss mice: Î³-aminobutyric acid, Î³-amino-Î²-hydroxybutyric acid (GABOB), Î´-amino-valeric acid (DAVA), Îµ-aminocaproic acid (EACA), trans-4-aminomethylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid (trans-AMCHA), taurine, and cysteic acid. Many of these compounds had displayed limited or no activity by a previously used prophylactic procedure. Although DAVA and GABOB were the most potent of the straight-chain Ï-amino acids, trans-AMCHA displayed the greatest antistaphylococcic activity of the Ï-amino acids thus far investigated. Homocarnosine (Î³-aminobutyrl histidine, which also was active by the prophylactic procedure) equalled trans-AMCHA in activity. Taurine was similar in potency to DAVA, and the activity of cysteic acid approximated that of EACA.

An increase in taurine level at the early stage of the disease (first group of patients) suggests that taurine may be a marker of compensatory abilities of the organism. The violation of the glutamate/taurine balance at the later stages of the disease and its normalization following the laserotherapy accompanied improvement of neurological symptoms.\n\nAltered peripheral amino acid profile indicate a systemic impact of active celiac disease and a possible role of amino acids in disease pathogenesis.\n\nPubMed\n\nTorinsson Naluai, Ã sa; Saadat Vafa, Ladan; Gudjonsdottir, Audur H; Arnell, Henrik; Browaldh, Lars; Nilsson, Staffan; Agardh, Daniel\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe have previously performed a Genome Wide Association and linkage study that indicated a new disease triggering mechanism involving amino acid metabolism and nutrient sensing signaling pathways. The aim of this study was to investigate if plasma amino acid levels differed among children with celiac disease compared with disease controls. Fasting plasma samples from 141 children with celiac disease and 129 non-celiac disease controls, were analyzed for amino acid levels by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS). A general linear model using age and experimental effects as covariates was used to compare amino acid levels between children with a diagnosis of celiac disease and controls. Seven out of twenty-three analyzed amino acids were elevated in children with celiac disease compared with controls (tryptophan, taurine, glutamic acid, proline, ornithine, alanine and methionine). The significance of the individual amino acids do not survive multiple correction, however, multivariate analyses of the amino acid profile showed significantly altered amino acid levels in children with celiac disease overall and after correction for age, sex and experimental effects (p = 8.4 Ã 10-8). These findings support the idea that amino acids could influence systemic inflammation and play a possible role in disease pathogenesis.\n\nTaurine decreased uric acid levels in hyperuricemic rats and alleviated kidney injury.\n\nPubMed\n\nFeng, Ying; Sun, Fang; Gao, Yongchao; Yang, Jiancheng; Wu, Gaofeng; Lin, Shumei; Hu, Jianmin\n\n2017-07-29\n\nHyperuricemia can lead to direct kidney damage. Taurine participates in several renal physiological processes and has been shown as a renoprotective agent. It has been reported that taurine could reduce uric acid levels in diabetic rats, but to date there was no research on the effects of taurine on hyperuricemic rats with kidney injury. In present study, hyperuricemic rat models were induced by intragastric administration of adenine and ethambutol hydrochloride for 10 days, and taurine (1% or 2%) were added in the drinking water 7 days in advance for consecutively 17 days. The results showed that taurine alleviated renal morphological and pathological changes as well as kidney dysfunction in hyperuricemic rats. Taurine could efficiently decrease the elevated xanthine oxidase activities in hyperuricemic rats, indicating its effect on the regulation of uric acid formation. The reabsorption and secretion of uric acid are dependent on a number of urate transporters. Expressions of three urate transporters were significantly down-regulated in hyperuricemic rats, while taurine prevented the decrease of mRNA and protein expression levels of these urate transporters. The results indicate that taurine might play a role in the regulation of renal uric acid excretion. Therefore, taurine could be a promising agent for the treatment of hyperuricemia.

As with other putative transmitter substances, their effects on body temperature when injected into the cerebral ventricles or the preoptic hypothalamus tend to vary within and between species. These effects are uninterpretable without accompanying information regarding effector activity changes and the influences of dose and ambient temperature. Observations necessary for analysis of apparent action have been made in studies of the effects of intracerebroventricularmoreÂ Â» injections of these amino acids into sheep. Aspartate and glutamate have similar excitatory effects on the pathway from cold sensors, whereas taurine and GABA exert inhibitory influences on the neural pathways that activate both heat production and heat loss effectors.

The major source of sulphur for humans is plants being able to use inorganic sulphur in the purpose of sulphur-containing amino acids synthesis. Sulphur-containing amino acids include methionine, cysteine, homocysteine, and taurine. Methionine and cysteine are classified as proteinogenic, canonic amino acids incorporated in protein structure. Sulphur amino acids are involved in the synthesis of intracellular antioxidants such as glutathione and N-acetyl cysteine. Moreover, naturally occurring sulphur-containing ligands are effective and safe detoxifying agents, often used in order to prevent toxic metal ions effects and their accumulation in human body. Literature search for peer-reviewed articles was performed using PubMed and Scopus databases, and utilizing appropriate keywords. This review is focused on sulphur-containing amino acids - methionine, cysteine, taurine, and their derivatives - glutathione and N-acetylcysteine, and their defense effects as antioxidant agents against free radicals. Additionally, the protective effects of sulphur-containing ligands against the toxic effects of heavy and transition metal ions, and their reactivation role towards the enzyme inhibition are described. Sulphur-containing amino acids represent a powerful part of cell antioxidant system. Thus, they are essential in the maintenance of normal cellular functions and health. In addition to their worthy antioxidant action, sulphur-containing amino acids may offer a chelating site for heavy metals. Accordingly, they may be supplemented during chelating therapy, providing beneficial effects in eliminating toxic metals.

In type 2 diabetic mice, taurine decreases blood glucose through increased insulin secretion and insulin receptor sensitization. However, insulin is absent in type 1 diabetic individuals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of taurine on parameters related to the energy balance that could explain the metabolic action of this amino acid in type 1 diabetic rats. Control and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats received saline or taurine (100â¯mg/kg/day), intraperitoneally, for 30 days. Parameters such as palatable food intake, gastrointestinal transit rate, serum glucose, insulin, leptin, and glucagon levels were measured 60â¯min after the last taurine administration. Liver, kidneys, heart, and retroperitoneal fat were dissected and weighted. Glycogen levels were measured in the liver and soleus muscle. Our results showed that acute taurine administration decreased glycemia. It also decreased food intake in diabetic rats, without affecting other metabolic parameters. Altogether, our results suggest that in type 1 diabetic rats, taurine decreases blood glucose by a non-insulin-dependent mechanism. Due to the safety profile of taurine, and its effect on glycemia, this amino acid may help to design new drugs to add benefit to insulin therapy in type 1 diabetic individuals.

However, there is still limited information available on their nutritional composition. The present study highlights and provides new information on the proximate composition, amino acid and fatty acid profiles of different body parts of Rv, aiming for its better application and research. The operculum contained a high amount of protein and flavor amino acids. The edible tissues, including meat and visceral mass, were valuable sources of essential amino acids (EAA) apart from methionine and cysteine. In addition, the meat contained high amount of taurine. Fatty acid analysis indicated that the edible tissues contained high amounts of Ï3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (C20:5Ï3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (C22:6Ï3), and had a low Ï6/Ï3 fatty acid ratio. Interestingly, significantly higher concentrations of most nutritional elements such as fat, EAA, EPA and DHA, were found in the visceral mass compared to those in the meat. The operculum of Rv may became a very interesting source for some protein and flavor peptide development, and the edible parts of Rv may be utilized for special dietary applications requiring high amounts of taurine, EPA, DHA and a lower Ï6/Ï3 fatty acid ratio.

The aim of the present work was to assess the importance of Na+ deficiency in evoking this response. Further, the previously described selectivity of replacement of Cl- with acetate with respect to amino acid release was reinvestigated. The hippocampus of urethane-anesthetized rats was dialyzed with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, and amino acid concentrations of the perfusate were determined. Choline chloride was then stepwise substituted for NaCl, and, in some cases, mannitol (122 mM) was included in low sodium-containing media. In other experiments, NaCl was replaced with sodium acetate. The dialysate levels of taurine increased selectively in response to Na+ substitution. The elevation of taurine was linearly related to the increase in choline chloride, and maximal levels amounted to 335% of basal levels. The increase in extracellular taurine was not inhibited by perfusion with medium made hyperosmotic with mannitol. Replacement of Cl- with acetate stimulated the release of taurine to 652% of resting levels. In addition, PEA levels increased to 250% of control concentration. Other amino acids were unaffected by Cl- substitution. The results show that taurine transport is considerably more sensitive to Na+ depletion than glutamate transport, which also is known to be Na+ dependent. The taurine increase evoked by low Na+ is not caused by cellular swelling as it was unaffected by hyperosmolar medium. Finally, substitution of acetate for Cl- causes a specific elevation of extracellular taurine and PEA, possibly as a result of cytotoxic edema.\n\nEffect of taurine on ischemia-reperfusion injury.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchaffer, Stephen W; Jong, Chian Ju; Ito, Takashi; Azuma, Junichi\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTaurine is an abundant Î²-amino acid that regulates several events that dramatically influence the development of ischemia-reperfusion injury. One of these events is the extrusion of taurine and Na+ from the cell via the taurine/Na+ symport. The loss of Na+ during the ischemia-reperfusion insult limits the amount of available Na+ for Na+/Ca2+ exchange, an important process in the development of Ca2+ overload and the activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition, a key process in ischemia-reperfusion mediated cell death. Taurine also prevents excessive generation of reactive oxygen species by the respiratory chain, an event that also limits the activation of the MPT. Because taurine is an osmoregulator, changes in taurine concentration trigger \"osmotic preconditioning,\" a process that activates an Akt-dependent cytoprotective signaling pathway that inhibits MPT pore formation. These effects of taurine have clinical implications, as experimental evidence reveals potential promise of taurine therapy in preventing cardiac damage during bypass surgery, heart transplantation and myocardial infarction. Moreover, severe loss of taurine from the heart during an ischemia-reperfusion insult may increase the risk of ventricular remodeling and development of heart failure.\n\nTaurine-induced attenuation of MPP+ neurotoxicity in vitro: a possible role for the GABA(A) subclass of GABA receptors.\n\nPubMed\n\nO'Byrne, M B; Tipton, K F\n\n2000-05-01\n\nTaurine is a sulphur-containing beta-amino acid found in high (millimolar) concentrations in excitable tissues such as brain and heart. Its suggested roles include osmoregulator, thermoregulator, neuromodulator, and potential neurotransmitter. This amino acid has also been shown to be released in large concentrations during ischaemia and excitotoxin-induced neuronal damage. Here we report a protective effect of taurine against MPP(+)-induced neurotoxicity in coronal slices from rat brain. Significant protective effects were observed at taurine concentrations of 20 and 1 mM, suggesting a potential role for taurine in cases of neuronal insult. Studies with the synthetic taurine analogues taurine phosphonate, guanidinoethane sulphonate, and trimethyltaurine suggested the observed effect to be mediated via an extracellular mechanism. The use of GABA receptor ligands muscimol and bicuculline indicated the effect to be mediated through activation of GABA(A) receptors.\n\nComparison of taurine, GABA, Glu, and Asp as scavengers of malondialdehyde in vitro and in vivo\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDeng, Yan; Wang, Wei; Yu, Pingfeng; Xi, Zhijiang; Xu, Lijian; Li, Xiaolong; He, Nongyue\n\n2013-04-01\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine if amino acid neurotransmitters such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), taurine, glutamate (Glu), and aspartate (Asp) can scavenge activated carbonyl toxicants. In vitro, direct reaction between malondialdehyde (MDA) and amino acids was researched using different analytical methods. The results indicated that scavenging activated carbonyl function of taurine and GABA is very strong and that of Glu and Asp is very weak in pathophysiological situations. The results provided perspective into the reaction mechanism of taurine and GABA as targets of activated carbonyl such as MDA in protecting nerve terminals. In vivo, we studied the effect of taurine and GABA as antioxidants by detecting MDA concentration and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities. It was shown that MDA concentration was decreased significantly, and the activities of SOD and GSH-Px were increased significantly in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of acute epileptic state rats, after the administration of taurine and GABA. The results indicated that the peripherally administered taurine and GABA can scavenge free radicals and protect the tissue against activated carbonyl in vivo and in vitro.\n\nTaurine suppresses osteoblastic differentiation of aortic valve interstitial cells induced by beta-glycerophosphate disodium, dexamethasone and ascorbic acid via the ERK pathway.\n\nPubMed\n\nFeng, Xiang; Li, Jian-ming; Liao, Xiao-bo; Hu, Ye-rong; Shang, Bao-peng; Zhang, Zhi-yuan; Yuan, Ling-qing; Xie, Hui; Sheng, Zhi-feng; Tang, Hao; Zhang, Wei; Gu, Lu; Zhou, Xin-min\n\n2012-10-01\n\nAortic valve calcification (AVC) is an active process characterized by osteoblastic differentiation of the aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs). Taurine is a free Î²-amino acid and plays important physiological roles including protective effect of cardiovascular events. To evaluate the possible role of taurine in AVC, we isolated human AVICs from patients with type A dissection without leaflet disease. We demonstrated that the cultured AVICs express SM Î±-actin, vimentin and taurine transporter (TAUT), but not CD31, SM-myosin or desmin. We also established the osteoblastic differentiation model of the AVICs induced by pro-calcific medium (PCM) containing Î²-glycerophosphate disodium, dexamethasone and ascorbic acid in vitro. The results showed that taurine attenuated the PCM-induced osteoblastic differentiation of AVICs by decreasing the alkaline phosphate (ALP) activity/expression and the expression of the core binding factor Î±1 (CbfÎ±1) in a dose-dependent manner (reaching the maximum protective effect at 10 mM), and taurine (10 mM) inhibited the mineralization level of AVICs in the form of calcium content significantly. Furthermore, taurine activated the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathway via TAUT, and the inhibitor of ERK (PD98059) abolished the effect of taurine on both ALP activity/expression and CbfÎ±1 expression. These results suggested that taurine could inhibit osteoblastic differentiation of AVIC via the ERK pathway.\n\nEnhanced taurine release in cell-damaging conditions in the developing and ageing mouse hippocampus.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaransaari, P; Oja, S S\n\n1997-08-01\n\nTaurine has been shown to be essential for neuronal development and survival in the central nervous system. The release of preloaded [3H]taurine was studied in hippocampal slices from seven-day-, three-month- and 18-22-month-old mice in cell-damaging conditions. The slices were superfused in hypoxic, hypoglycemic and ischemic conditions and exposed to free radicals and oxidative stress. The release of taurine was greatly enhanced in the above conditions in all age groups, except in oxidative stress. The release was large in ischemia, particularly in the hippocampus of aged mice. Potassium stimulation was still able to release taurine in cell-damaging conditions in immature mice, whereas in adult and aged animals the release was so substantial that this additional stimulus failed to work. Taurine release was partially Ca2+-dependent in all cases. The massive release of the inhibitory amino acid taurine in ischemic conditions could act neuroprotectively, counteracting in several ways the effects of simultaneous release of excitatory amino acids. This protection could be of great importance in developing brain tissue, while also having an effect in aged brains.\n\nAmino acid transmitters in patients with headache during the acute phase of cerebrovascular ischemic disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nCastillo, J; MartÃ­nez, F; Corredera, E; Aldrey, J M; Noya, M\n\n1995-11-01\n\nThe pathophysiology of headache occurring at stroke onset is unknown. Migraine and ischemia share an excessive release of neuroexcitatory amino acids. Inhibitory amino acids also may be implicated in both diseases. We investigated whether fluctuations of these amino acids occur in headache accompanying cerebral infarction. We studied 100 patients with infarction in the territory of the middle cerebral artery. Neurological impairment was assessed using the Canadian Neurological Scale and Barthel Index. Size of infarction was determined with CT. Twenty-eight patients developed headache. Glutamate, aspartate, and taurine were quantified in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within 24 hours of stroke onset with cationic exchange chromatography. Stroke subtypes, size of infarct on CT, and clinical scales were similar in patients with and without headache. Plasma glutamate level was 321.14 +/- 149.53 mumol/L in patients with headache and 233 +/- 107.23 mumol/L in those without headache (P < .005). Glutamate in CSF was higher in patients with headache (4.6 +/- 1.49 mumol/L) than in patients without headache (3.11 +/- 1.18 mumol/L) (P < .001). Aspartate concentrations in plasma and CSF were similar in both groups. Taurine concentrations in plasma were 103.10 +/- 52.82 mumol/L and 177.49 +/- 90.92 mumol/L in headache and nonheadache patients, respectively (P < .001). Taurine levels in CSF were 5.42 +/- 2.42 mumol/L in patients with headache and 9.27 +/- 5.31 mumol/L in those without headache (P < .001). No significant correlation was found between amino acid levels in plasma or CSF and size of infarction. Amino acid neurotransmitters play a role in the pathophysiology of headache that occurs at the onset of stroke. The ischemic penumbral area, more than the infarction itself, may cause a state of cortical hyperexcitability that would be responsible for the cortical release of amino acids and the induction of headache by altering pain perception mechanisms.\n\nRelease of endogenous amino acids from the hippocampus and brain stem from developing and adult mice in ischemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nOja, Simo S; Saransaari, Pirjo\n\n2009-09-01\n\nThe release of neurotransmitters and modulators has been studied mostly using labeled preloaded compounds. For several reasons, however, the estimated release may not reliably reflect the release of endogenous compounds. The basal and K(+)-evoked release of the neuroactive endogenous amino acids GABA, glycine, taurine, L-glutamate and L-aspartate was now studied in slices from the hippocampus and brain stem from 7-day-old and 3-month-old mice under control and ischemic conditions. The release of synaptically not active L-glutamine, L-alanine, L-threonine and L-serine was assessed for comparison. The estimates for the hippocampus and brainstem were markedly different and also different in developing and adult mice. GABA release was much greater in 3-month-old than in 7-day-old mice, whereas with taurine the situation was the opposite, in the hippocampus in particular. K(+) stimulation enhanced glycine release more in the mature than immature brain stem while in the hippocampus the converse was observed. Ischemia enhanced the release of all neuroactive amino acids in both brain regions, the effects being relatively most pronounced in the case of GABA, aspartate and glutamate in the hippocampus in 3-month-old mice, and taurine in 7-day-old and glycine in 3-month-old mice in the brain stem. These results are qualitatively similar to those obtained on earlier experiments with labeled preloaded amino acids. However, the magnitudes of the release cannot be quite correctly estimated using radioactive labels. In developing mice only taurine release may counteract the harmful effects of excitatory amino acids in ischemia in both hippocampus and brain stem.\n\nAmino acid composition in parenteral nutrition: what is the evidence?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYarandi, Shadi S.; Zhao, Vivian M.; Hebbar, Gautam; Ziegler, Thomas R.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nPurpose of review Complete parenteral nutrition solutions contain mixed amino acid products providing all nine essential amino acids and a varying composition of nonessential amino acids. Relatively little rigorous comparative efficacy research on altered parenteral nutrition amino acid composition has been published in recent years. Recent findings Limited data from randomized, double-blind, adequately powered clinical trials to define optimal doses of total or individual amino acids in parenteral nutrition are available. An exception is the growing number of studies on the efficacy of glutamine supplementation of parenteral nutrition or given as a single parenteral agent. Parenteral glutamine appears to confer benefit in selected patients; however, additional data to define optimal glutamine dosing and the patient subgroups who may most benefit from this amino acid are needed. Although some promising studies have been published, little data are available in the current era of nutrition support on the clinical efficacy of altered doses of arginine, branched chain amino acids, cysteine, or taurine supplementation of parenteral nutrition. Summary Despite routine use of parenteral nutrition, surprisingly little clinical efficacy data are available to guide total or specific amino acid dosing in adult and pediatric patients requiring this therapy. This warrants increased attention by the research community and funding agencies to better define optimal amino acid administration strategies in patient subgroups requiring parenteral nutrition. PMID:21076291\n\nModelling cortical cataractogenesis 22: is in vitro reduction of damage in model diabetic rat cataract by taurine due to its antioxidant activity?\n\nPubMed\n\nKilic, F; Bhardwaj, R; Caulfeild, J; Trevithick, J R\n\n1999-09-01\n\nThe protective effect of taurine in model in vitro diabetic cataract and the mechanism of this effect were investigated in isolated rat lenses. Isolated rat lenses were incubated in medium 199 in elevated glucose (55.6 m m) with taurine (5 m m). Taurine concentrations in the lenses were determined by amino acid analysis. Accumulative leakage of the intracellular enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was used to estimate damage to the lens, as previously reported. In the clear lenses, prior to vacuole formation, after 1 or 2 days of incubation, the taurine and amino acids in lenses decreased progressively in concentration. In lenses incubated with 5 m m taurine, the level of taurine was increased towards that of control lenses. In taurine-treated lenses LDH leakage was significantly decreased, and lens clarity was maintained, similarly to that found previously for vitamin C and lipoic acid. To test whether taurine has similar antioxidant activity, we tested its ability to decrease luminol luminescence generated by (1) superoxide from hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase and (2) peroxide from diluted glucose/glucose oxidase. For either superoxide or peroxide, the luminescence was decreased to zero, as a function of increasing taurine concentration, at 30 m m, approximately the physiological concentration of taurine in the lens. Spin trapping confirmed that taurine scavenged superoxide. This is consistent with a role for taurine as an important antioxidant protecting the lens against oxidative insults. Amino acids also had antioxidant activity in this assay, and as a group, when all activities were summed, their loss also contributed significantly to the antioxidant loss. Taken in conjunction with Wolff and Crabbe's observation of increased free radical generation by glucose auto-oxidation in diabetes, this suggests a push-pull mechanism for increased oxidative stress in diabetic cataract, involving both increased free radicals and decreased radical scavenging antioxidants\n\nDietary taurine alters ascorbic acid metabolism in rats fed diets containing polychlorinated biphenyls.\n\nPubMed\n\nMochizuki, H; Oda, H; Yokogoshi, H\n\n2000-04-01\n\nThe effect of dietary taurine on ascorbic acid metabolism and hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes was investigated in rats fed diets containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) to determine whether taurine has an adaptive and protective function in xenobiotic-treated animals. Young male Wistar rats (60 g) were fed diets containing 0 or 0.2 g/kg diet PCB with or without 30 g/kg diet of taurine for 14 d. The rats fed the PCB-containing diets had greater liver weight, higher ascorbic acid concentrations in the liver and spleen and greater hepatic cytochrome P-450 contents than control rats that were not treated with PCB (P < 0.01). In PCB-fed rats, urinary ascorbic acid excretion was enhanced, and serum cholesterol concentration (especially HDL-cholesterol) was significantly elevated compared with those in control rats. Dietary taurine significantly potentiated the increases in the urinary excretion of ascorbic acid and the rise in the levels of cytochrome P-450 which were caused by PCB treatment. On the other hand, the supplementation of taurine to control diet did not alter these variables. Taurine may enhance the hepatic drug-metabolizing systems, leading to the stimulation of the ascorbic acid metabolism in rats fed diets containing PCB.\n\nNeuroprotective Mechanisms of Taurine against Ischemic Stroke.\n\nPubMed\n\nMenzie, Janet; Prentice, Howard; Wu, Jang-Yen\n\n2013-06-03\n\nIschemic stroke exhibits a multiplicity of pathophysiological mechanisms.

Glioblastoma growth was associated with increased concentrations of choline, GABA, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, taurine, tyrosine, and valine. There was no difference between grade III and grade IV tumors in the concentrations of phenylalanine, isoleucine, tyrosine, valine, and lysine, whereas the concentrations of choline, aspartate, taurine, GABA, leucine, and glutamate were significantly different in the two tumor-grade subgroups. In contrast to the other compounds, the concentration of glutamate was decreased in glioma. The parenchyma adjacent to the tumor showed significant changes only in the extracellular concentration of glutamate, isoleucine, and valine. The concentrations of choline and the amino acids, glutamate, leucine, taurine, and tyrosine showed significant positive correlations with the degree of cell proliferation. Epilepsy, which is relatively common in subjects with gliomas, was shown to be a significant confounding variable when the extracellular concentrations of aspartate, glutamate and GABA were considered.\n\nTaurine release from the developing and ageing hippocampus: stimulation by agonists of ionotropic glutamate receptors.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaransaari, P; Oja, S S\n\n1997-12-30\n\nThe inhibitory amino acid taurine has been held to function as a modulator and osmoregulator in the brain, being of particular importance in the immature brain. The release of preloaded [3H]taurine was now studied in hippocampal slices from developing (7-day-old), adult (3-month-old) and ageing (6-24-month-old) mice focussing on the effects of agonists of ionotropic glutamate receptors. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), kainate and 2-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) potentiated taurine release concentration-dependently at each age, more so in the immature than in the adult and ageing hippocampus. The effect of kainate was blocked by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) in the developing and aged hippocampus and those of AMPA and NMDA by 6-nitro-7-sulphamoylbenzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX) and dizocilpine a(MK-801) at every age studied. This indicates the involvement of NMDA and AMPA receptors in taurine release throughout the life-span of mice, while the kainate-receptor-mediated release does not appear to function in adults. The increased hippocampal taurine release evoked by ionotropic glutamate receptors could act neuroprotectively, counteracting by several mechanisms the harmful effects of the simultaneous release of excitatory amino acids. The substantial release of taurine in the immature hippocampus might be particularly significant in view of the vulnerability of brain tissue to excitotoxicity at early age.\n\nMonthly changes of glycogen, lipid and free amino acid of oyster\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhicui, Zhang; Changhu, Xue; Xin, Gao; Zhaojie, Li; Qi, Wang\n\n2006-07-01\n\nMonthly difference of the chemical composition of oyster cultured along the eastern coast of Shandong Province was analyzed. The components analyzed included glycogen, fatty acid and free amino acid (FAA). The content of glycogen was high in January and March (2.89 and 2.82 g(100g)-1 on average, respectively) and low in October (2.07 g(100g)-1 on avarage). The low content of neutral lipids in October reflected a relatively poor nutritional value of oyster (1.42 g(100 g)-1 on average). The main fatty acids of oyster were palmitic acid (16:0), oleic acid (18:1), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20: 5Ï-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6Ï-3). The major FAAs of oyster were Taurine, Glutamicacid, Glycin, Alanine, Arginine and Proline. Taurine was the most abundant FAA with its content ranging from 603 mg (100g)-1 to 1139 mg(100g)-1. The high contents of glycogen, polyunsaturated fatty acid and FAA showed that oyster cultured along the eastern coast of Shandong Province was nutritionally good in January and March.\n\nRole of taurine in the pathogenesis of obesity.\n\nPubMed\n\nMurakami, Shigeru\n\n2015-07-01\n\nTaurine is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is present in mammalian tissues in millimolar concentrations. Taurine is involved in a diverse array of biological and physiological functions, including bile salt conjugation, osmoregulation, membrane stabilization, calcium modulation, anti-oxidation, and immunomodulation. The prevalence of obesity and being overweight continues to rise worldwide at an alarming rate. Obesity is associated with a higher risk of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and other clinical conditions. Ingestion of taurine has been shown to alleviate metabolic diseases such as hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity in animal models. A global epidemiological survey showed that 24-h urinary taurine excretion, as a marker of dietary taurine intake, was inversely associated with BMI, blood pressure, and plasma cholesterol in humans. In addition, taurine chloramine, an endogenous product derived from activated neutrophils, has been reported to suppress obesity-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in adipocytes. Synthetic activity and concentration of taurine in adipose tissues and plasma have been shown to decrease in humans and animals during the development of obesity, suggesting a relationship between taurine deficiency and obesity. In this review, I summarize the effects of taurine on the progression of obesity in animal models and humans. Furthermore, I discuss possible mechanisms underlying the antiobesity effects of taurine.

In view of the possible involvement of excitatory pathways in the regulation of taurine function in the brain, the interference of glutamate receptors with taurine release from different tissue preparations in vitro and from the brain in vivo is of special interest. The release of taurine from the brain is enhanced by glutamate receptor agonists. This enhancement is inhibited by the respective receptor antagonists both in vitro and in vivo. The ionotropic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and 2-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor agonists appear to be the most effective in enhancing taurine release, their effects being receptor-mediated. Kainate is less effective, particularly in adults. Of the glutamate receptors, the NMDA class seems to be the most susceptible to modulation by nitric oxide. Nitric oxide also modulates taurine release, enhancing the basal release in both immature and mature hippocampus, whereas the K(+)-stimulated release is generally inhibited. Metabotropic glutamate receptors also participate in the regulation of taurine release, group I metabotropic glutamate receptors potentiating the release in the developing hippocampus, while group III receptors may be involved in the adult. Under various cell-damaging conditions, including ischemia, hypoxia and hypoglycemia, taurine release is enhanced, together with an enhanced release of excitatory amino acids. The increase in extracellular taurine upon excessive stimulation of glutamate receptors and under cell-damaging conditions may serve as an important protective mechanism against excitotoxicity, being particularly effective in the immature brain.\n\nInfluence of endogenous opiates on the hypotensive action of taurine in DOCA-salt rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nSato, Y; Fujita, T\n\n1988-12-01\n\nWe studied the role of endogenous opiate activation in the hypotensive action of taurine, a sulphur amino acid, in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats. Previous work had shown that supplementation with 1% taurine reduced blood pressure when given after DOCA-salt hypertension had been established. In the present study, in conscious rats, intraperitoneal injection of naloxone, an opiate antagonist, increased blood pressure in taurine-supplemented DOCA-salt rats, but not in DOCA-salt rats or vehicle-treated control rats. These results suggest that activation of an endogenous opiate might contribute to the hypotensive action of taurine in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats.\n\nTemporal changes in concentrations of amino acids in plasma and whole blood of healthy neonatal foals from birth to two days of age.\n\nPubMed\n\nZicker, S C; Rogers, Q R\n\n1994-07-01\n\nTemporal changes, as well as differences in distribution, in concentrations of 24 amino acids in plasma and whole blood of neonatal foals were determined from birth to 2 days of age. In addition, differences in concentrations of amino acids in plasma between mare and foal pairs were determined at birth. Significant (P < 0.05) hypoaminoacidemia existed for 15 amino acids in plasma of foals at birth, compared with mares (paired t-test). Concentrations of 7 amino acids (aspartate, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, hydroxyproline, phenylalanine, proline) in plasma of foals were higher (P < 0.05) at birth than in mares, and concentrations of 2 (taurine, tryptophan) were not different (P > 0.05). Significant (P < 0.05) temporal changes for concentrations of 19 of 24 amino acids in plasma were observed during the 48-hour period. Concentrations of 13 of the 19 amino acids in plasma that had significant changes were higher (P < 0.05) at 48 hours. Significant (P > 0.05) effect of time on concentration of 5 amino acids (alanine, methionine, phenylalanine, taurine, threonine) in plasma was not found after birth. Temporal changes in concentrations of 7 amino acids (alanine, asparagine, glutamine, histidine, hydroxyproline, methionine, and threonine) in whole blood were not significantly (P > 0.05) different from those in plasma. Temporal changes for concentrations of the remaining 17 amino acids in whole blood were significantly (P < 0.05) different, compared with plasma. Distribution of the concentrations of 18 amino acids between whole blood and plasma was significantly (P < 0.05) different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\nAttenuation of Diabetes-induced Cardiac and Subcellular Defects by Sulphur-containing Amino Acids.\n\nPubMed\n\nTappia, Paramjit S; Adameova, Adriana; Dhalla, Naranjan S\n\n2018-01-30\n\nPatients with diabetes mellitus have an increased risk of mortality due to cardiovascular complications. Supplementation with specific sulphur-containing amino acids is rapidly emerging as a possible therapeutic adjuvant for diabetes and associated cardiovascular complications. It is well-known that oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes-induced cardiovascular disease, which is invariably associated with abnormal blood lipid profile, insulin resistance and other symptoms of metabolic syndrome. Cysteine and taurine are among the most common sulphur-containing amino acids and their cellular levels decline during diabetes that may contribute to the development of the cardiomyopathy. Although sulphur-containing agents exert multiple actions on cellular and subcellular functions in the heart, they also exhibit antioxidant properties and thus may exert beneficial effects in different pathophysiological conditions. It is concluded that reduction of oxidative stress by cysteine and taurine may serve as an important mechanism for the attenuation of diabetes-induced subcellular and functional abnormalities in the heart.

The most popular commercial dried laver species, P. tenera and P. haitanensis, were collected from Korea and China, respectively, and evaluated for proximate composition, amino acids, minerals, trace heavy metals, and color. The moisture and ash contents of P. tenera and P. haitanensis ranged from 3.66~6.74% and 8.78~9.07%, respectively; crude lipid and protein contents were 1.96~2.25% and 32.16~36.88%, respectively. Dried lavers were found to be a good source of amino acids, such as asparagine, isoleucine, leucine, and taurine, and Î³-aminobutyric acid. K, Ca, Mg, Na, P, I, Fe, and Se minerals were selected for analysis. A clear regional variation existed in the amino acid, mineral, and trace metal contents of lavers. Regular consumption of lavers may have heath benefits because they are relatively low in fat and high in protein, and contain functional amino acids and minerals.

The results reported in the literature are generally inconclusive and contradictory, but there has been considerable variation among the previous studies in terms of factors such as age, gender, number of subjects, intelligence quotient, and psychoactive medication being taken. Future studies should include simultaneous analyses of a large number of amino acids [including D-serine and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)] and standardization of the factors mentioned above. It may also be appropriate to use saliva sampling to detect amino acids in ASD patients in the future-this is noninvasive testing that can be done easily more frequently than other sampling, thus providing more dynamic monitoring.\n\nCharacterizing amino-acid biosignatures amongst individuals with schizophrenia: a case-control study.\n\nPubMed\n\nCao, Bing; Wang, Dongfang; Brietzke, Elisa; McIntyre, Roger S; Pan, Zihang; Cha, Danielle; Rosenblat, Joshua D; Zuckerman, Hannah; Liu, Yaqiong; Xie, Qing; Wang, Jingyu\n\n2018-05-23\n\nAmino acids and derivatives participate in the biosynthesis and downstream effects of numerous neurotransmitters. Variations in specific amino acids have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Herein, we sought to compare levels of amino acids and derivatives between subjects with schizophrenia and healthy controls (HC). Two hundred and eight subjects with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria (DSM-IV)-defined schizophrenia and 175 age- and sex-matched HC were enrolled. The levels of twenty-five amino acids and seven related derivatives were measured in plasma samples using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). After controlling for age, sex and body mass index (BMI), four amino acids and derivatives (i.e., cysteine, GABA, glutamine and sarcosine) were observed to be higher in the schizophrenia group when compared with HC; seven amino acids and derivatives were lower in the schizophrenia group (i.e., arginine, L-ornithine, threonine, taurine, tryptophan, methylcysteine, and kynurenine). Statistically significant differences in plasma amino-acid profiles between subjects with first-episode vs. recurrent schizophrenia for aspartate and glutamine were also demonstrated using generalized linear models controlling for age, sex, and BMI. The differences in amino acids and derivatives among individuals with schizophrenia when compared to HC may represent underlying pathophysiology, including but not limited to dysfunctional proteinogenic processes, alterations in excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, changes in ammonia metabolism and the urea cycle. Taken together, amino-acid profiling may provide a novel stratification approach among individuals with schizophrenia.\n\nInfluence of the amino acid moiety on deconjugation of bile acid amidates by cholylglycine hydrolase or human fecal cultures.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuijghebaert, S M; Hofmann, A F\n\n1986-07-01\n\nThe influence of the chemical structure of the amino acid (or amino acid analogue) moiety of a number of synthetic cholyl amidates on deconjugation by cholylglycine hydrolase from Clostridium perfringens was studied in vitro at pH 5.4. Conjugates with alkyl homologues of glycine were hydrolyzed more slowly as the number of methylene units increased (cholylglycine greater than cholyl-beta-alanine greater than cholyl-gamma-aminobutyrate). In contrast, for conjugates with the alkyl homologues of taurine, cholylaminopropane sulfonate was hydrolyzed slightly faster than cholyltaurine, whereas cholylaminomethane sulfonate was hydrolyzed much more slowly. When glycine was replaced by other neutral alpha-amino acids, rates of hydrolysis decreased with increasing steric hindrance near the amide bond (cholyl-L-alpha-alanine much much greater than cholyl-L-leucine much greater than cholyl-L-valine greater than cholyl-L-tyrosine much greater than cholyl-D-valine). Conjugation with acidic or basic amino acids also greatly reduced the rates of hydrolysis, as cholyl-L-aspartate, cholyl-L-cysteate, cholyl-L-lysine, and cholyl-L-histidine were all hydrolyzed at a rate less than one-tenth that of cholylglycine. Methyl esterification of the carboxylic group of the amino acid moiety reduced the hydrolysis, but such substrates (cholylglycine methyl ester and cholyl-beta-alanine methyl ester) were completely hydrolyzed after overnight incubation with excess of enzyme. In contrast, cholyl-cholamine was not hydrolyzed at all, suggesting that a negative charge at the end of the side chain is required for optimal hydrolysis. Despite the lack of specificity for the amino acid moiety, a bile salt moiety was required, as the cholylglycine hydrolase did not display general carboxypeptidase activity for other non-bile acid substrates containing a terminal amide bond: hippuryl-L-phenylalanine and hippuryl-L-arginine, as well as oleyltaurine and oleylglycine, were not hydrolyzed.

Tissue content and release of ten amino acids were measured simultaneously in rat hippocampal slices by means of high performance liquid chromatography. Hyposmotic stress induced a large release of taurine (25568 pmol mg-1 protein), and a smaller release of glutamate, accompanied by an inverse change in tissue content. Adding mannitol to correct osmolarity, blocked these changes. Energy deprivation caused an increase in the release of all amino acids except glutamine. The release was particularly large for glutamate and GABA (31141 and 13282 pmol mg-1, respectively). The intracellular concentrations were generally reduced, but the total amount of the released amino acids increased In contrast to the effect seen during hyposmolar stress, mannitol enhanced the changes due to energy deprivation. The results show that hyposmolar stress and energy deprivation cause different content and release profiles, suggesting that the mechanisms involved in the two situations are either different or modulated in different ways. The intracellular amino acid depletion seen during energy deprivation shows that increased outward transport is probably a primary event, and increased amino acid formation likely secondary to this release.\n\nHemolymph amino acid analysis of individual Drosophila larvae.\n\nPubMed\n\nPiyankarage, Sujeewa C; Augustin, Hrvoje; Grosjean, Yael; Featherstone, David E; Shippy, Scott A\n\n2008-02-15\n\nOne of the most widely used transgenic animal models in biology is Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly. Chemical information from this exceedingly small organism is usually accomplished by studying populations to attain sample volumes suitable for standard analysis methods. This paper describes a direct sampling technique capable of obtaining 50-300 nL of hemolymph from individual Drosophila larvae. Hemolymph sampling performed under mineral oil and in air at 30 s intervals up to 120 s after piercing larvae revealed that the effect of evaporation on amino acid concentrations is insignificant when the sample was collected within 60 s. Qualitative and quantitative amino acid analyses of obtained hemolymph were carried out in two optimized buffer conditions by capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection after derivatizing with fluorescamine. Thirteen amino acids were identified from individual hemolymph samples of both wild-type (WT) control and the genderblind (gb) mutant larvae. The levels of glutamine, glutamate, and taurine in the gb hemolymph were significantly lower at 35%, 38%, and 57% of WT levels, respectively. The developed technique that samples only the hemolymph fluid is efficient and enables accurate organism-level chemical information while minimizing errors associated with possible sample contaminations, estimations, and effects of evaporation compared to the traditional hemolymph-sampling techniques.\n\nFree amino acids in fibromyalgia syndrome: relationship with clinical picture.\n\nPubMed\n\nRuggiero, Valeria; Mura, Massimiliano; Cacace, Enrico; Era, Benedetta; Peri, Marcella; Sanna, Giuseppina; Fais, Antonella\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe objectives of our study were to evaluate free amino acid (FAA) concentrations in the serum of patients affected by fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and to determine the relationships between FAA levels and FMS clinical parameters. Thus, serum amino acid concentrations were quantified (HPLC analysis) in 23 females with fibromyalgia (according to the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria) and 20 healthy females. The results showed significantly higher serum concentrations of aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, glycine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, ornithine, phenylalanine, sarcosine, serine, taurine, tyrosine and valine in FMS patients vs. healthy controls. Patients with higher Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) scores showed increased levels of alanine, glutamine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, proline and valine. In conclusion, our results indicate an imbalance in some FAAs in FMS patients. Increased Glu is particularly interesting, as it could explain the deficit in monoaminergic transmission involved in pain.\n\nIntracerebroventricular administration of taurine impairs learning and memory in rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nIto, Koichi; Arko, MatevÅ¾; Kawaguchi, Tomohiro; Kikusui, Takefumi; Kuwahara, Masayoshi; Tsubone, Hirokazu\n\n2012-03-01\n\nTaurine is a semi-essential amino acid widely distributed in the body and we take in it from a wide range of nutritive-tonic drinks to improve health. To date, we have elucidated that oral supplementation of taurine does not affect learning and memory in the rat. However, there are few studies concerning the direct effects of taurine in the brain at the behavior level. In this study, we intracerebroventricularly administered taurine to rats and aimed to elucidate the acute effects on learning and memory using the Morris water maze method. Escape latency, swim distance, and distance to zone, which is the integral of the distance between the rats and the platform for every 0.16 seconds, were adopted as parameters of the ability of learning and memory. We also tried to evaluate the effect of intraperitoneal taurine administration. Escape latency, swim distance, and distance to zone were significantly longer in the intracerebroventricularly taurine-administered rats than in the saline-administered rats. Mean swimming velocity was comparable between these two groups, although the physical performance was improved by taurine administration. Probe trials showed that the manner of the rats in finding the platform was comparable. In contrast, no significant differences were found between the intraperitoneally taurine-administered rats and the saline-administered rats. These results indicate that taurine administered directly into the brain ventricle suppresses and delays the ability of learning and memory in rats. In contrast, it is implied that taurine administered peripherally was not involved in learning and memory.\n\n[Taurine as a regulator of fluid-electrolyte balance and arterial pressure].\n\nPubMed\n\nCiechanowska, B\n\n1997-01-01\n\nTaurine is a sulfonic beta-amino acid which occurs in the highest concentration in the brain, the retina and in the myocardium. In cardiomyocytes it presents about 50% of free amino acids and plays a role as an osmoregulator, an inotropic factor and has an antiarrhythmic property. Moreover, taurine lowers arterial pressure by extension of diuresis and by vasodilatation. Similar effect on the vascular system and arterial pressure is exerted by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Increase of both ANP secretion and myocardial taurine concentration is present in the same diseases as congestive cardiac failure, hypertension and hypernatremia. The aim of the study was the evaluation of general taurine depletion, caused by making the rats drink guanidinoethyl sulfonate (GES)--an inhibitor of taurine transport affecting fluid balance and arterial pressure as well as plasma ANP concentration under normal conditions and after increase of sodium load. The 103 male Wistar rats weighing 250-300 g were used. The animals were separated into 5 groups. Control group received tap water to drink. Group II was sodium-loaded by drinking 171 mmol/l NaCl. In group III depletion of taurine was obtained by the intake of 60 mmol/l GES. Rats in group IV were drinking 60 mmol/l GES in 171 mmol/l NaCl. Group V was made to drink 200 mmol/l taurine in 171 mmol/l NaCl. All animals had standard food and were able at any time to drink. Duration of the experiment was 20 days. At the onset and after 10 and 20 days the rats were weighed and their systolic blood pressure was measured by tail plethysmography. After 10 and 20 days of the study, plasma and myocardium taurine concentration, ANP, hematocrit, plasma osmolity, natremia, kalemia, urea and creatinine concentrations were determined. Taking GES for 20 days led to 43% decrease of plasma taurine and its myocardium content about 50% as compared to control group (Tab. 2).

Taurine treatment also reduced protein thiol oxidation and was overall more effective, as OTC treatment reduced body and muscle weight, suggesting some adverse effects of this drug.These data suggest that increasing dietary taurine is a better candidate for a therapeutic intervention for DMD. Abstract Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal muscle wasting disease for which there is no widely available cure. Whilst the mechanism of loss of muscle function in DMD and the mdx mouse model are not fully understood, disruptions in intracellular calcium homeostasis, inflammation and oxidative stress are implicated. We have shown that protein thiol oxidation is increased in mdx muscle, and that the indirect thiol antioxidant lâ2âoxothiazolidineâ4âcarboxylate (OTC), which increases cysteine availability, decreases pathology and increases in vivo strength. We propose that the protective effects of OTC are a consequence of conversion of cysteine to taurine, which has itself been shown to be beneficial to mdx pathology. This study compares the efficacy of taurine with OTC in decreasing dystropathology in mdx mice by measuring in vivo and ex vivo contractile function and measurements of inflammation and protein thiol oxidation. Increasing the taurine content of mdx\n\nGABA, 5-HT and amino acids in the rotifers Brachionus plicatilis and Brachionus rotundiformis.\n\nPubMed\n\nGallardo, W G; Hagiwara, A; Hara, K; Soyano, K; Snell, T W\n\n2000-11-01\n\ngamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) have been shown to increase the reproduction of the Brachionus plicatilis (NH3L strain). In the present study, the endogenous presence of GABA and 5-HT in the rotifers B. plicatilis (NH3L and Kamiura strains) and Brachionus rotundiformis (Langkawi strain) were confirmed by dot blot immunoassay and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). HPLC showed that GABA and 5-HT concentrations in the three rotifer strains range from 71 to 188 pmol/mg and from 12 to 64 pmol/mg, respectively. A total of 33 amino acids were also detected in B. plicatilis and B. rotundiformis, with glutamic acid, serine, glycine, taurine, threonine, alanine, arginine, proline, valine and isoleucine in high concentrations relative to other amino acids.\n\nProtective role of taurine in developing offspring affected by maternal alcohol consumption\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAnanchaipatana-Auitragoon, Pilant; Ananchaipatana-Auitragoon, Yutthana; Siripornpanich, Vorasith; Kotchabhakdi, Naiphinich\n\n2015-01-01\n\nMaternal alcohol consumption is known to affect offspring growth and development, including growth deficits, physical anomalies, impaired brain functions and behavioral disturbances. Taurine, a sulfur-containing amino acid, is essential during development, and continually found to be protective against neurotoxicity and various tissue damages including those from alcohol exposure. However, it is still unknown whether taurine can exert its protection during development of central nervous system and whether it can reverse alcohol damages on developed brain later in life. This study aims to investigate protective roles of taurine against maternal alcohol consumption on growth and development of offspring. The experimental protocol was conducted using ICR-outbred pregnant mice given 10 % alcohol, with or without maternal taurine supplementation during gestation and lactation. Pregnancy outcomes, offspring mortality and successive bodyweight until adult were monitored. Adult offspring is supplemented taurine to verify its ability to reverse damages on learning and memory through a water maze task performance. Our results demonstrate that offspring of maternal alcohol exposure, together with maternal taurine supplementation show conserved learning and memory, while that of offspring treated taurine later in life are disturbed. Taurine provides neuroprotective effects and preserves learning and memory processes when given together with maternal alcohol consumption, but not shown such effects when given exclusively in offspring.

Here we studied the effects of intraperitoneal injections of taurine on the concentrations of glutamate and GABA, and their precursors, glutamine and alanine, in the rat striatum and hippocampus. Injections of 0.25, 0.5 and 1 g/kg taurine led to a gradual increase in taurine tissue concentrations in both hippocampus and striatum. Glutamate and GABA also increased in the hippocampus, but not in the striatum. Glutamine increased and alanine decreased markedly in both brain structures. The results corroborate the neuromodulatory role of taurine in the brain. Taurine administration results in an imbalance in inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission in the glutamatergic (hippocampus) and GABAergic (striatum) brain structures, affecting more markedly the neurotransmitter precursors.\n\nK(+)- and temperature-evoked taurine efflux from hypothalamic astrocytes.\n\nPubMed\n\nTigges, G A; Philibert, R A; Dutton, G R\n\n1990-10-30\n\nHypothalamic astrocytes in culture released taurine, a suspected inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitter/neuromodulator/osmoregulator, in response to isoosmotically increasing extracellular K+ in a dose-dependent fashion.

Stimulation with K+ (60 mM) did not furthe"
