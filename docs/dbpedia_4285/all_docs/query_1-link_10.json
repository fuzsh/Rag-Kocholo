        "text": "Early life and education\n\nBorn in The Hague, he spent his entire career at Leiden University except for a brief period (1954â€“1956) as research assistant at Yerkes Observatory. He received his undergraduate degree in 1940, but World War II interrupted his studies and he did not get his Ph.D. until 1961 (on the surface photometry of extragalactic nebulae).\n\nFamily\n\nHe married fellow astronomer Ingrid Groeneveld (who became Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld) and together they became interested in asteroids. They had one son, Karel.\n\nWork as astronomer\n\nIn a jointly-credited trio with Tom Gehrels and Ingrid, and occasionally including fellow astronomer Bernhard Schmidt, he was an extremely prolific discoverer of many thousands of asteroids. Gehrels did a sky survey using the 48-inch Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory and shipped the plates to the van Houtens at Leiden Observatory, who analyzed them for new asteroids. The trio are jointly credited with several thousand discoveries.\n\nFrom the statistical properties uncovered it became clear that asteroids fall into certain \"families\"."
