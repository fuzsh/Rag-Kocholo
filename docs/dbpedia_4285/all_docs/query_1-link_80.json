        "text": "The deafness of Ludwig van Beethoven: an immunopathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKarmody, Collin S; Bachor, Edgar S\n\n2005-07-01\n\nTo analyze and discuss the deafness of Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) and to offer a logical theory for its etiology. The study will carefully review the composer's symptoms as described in his letters to friends and acquaintances and also will review a large body of source material, particularly publications by his contemporaries, some of which were generously loaned by Beethoven-Haus, Bonn, Germany, where necessary translations were made directly from the original German. We will also study publications on Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and its associated extraintestinal manifestations and personal discussions with experienced gastroenterologists. Beethoven's abdominal symptoms that began in his teens are highly suggestive of IBD, which we believe to be a correct diagnosis. IBD is an umbrella term that includes a number of named entities such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease. IBD is now considered to be a problem of immune regulation with extra intestinal manifestations that include sensorineural hearing loss and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). PSC eventually causes cirrhosis and failure of the liver. A diagnosis of IBD therefore provides a single entity that explains most of the composer's symptoms and was finally the cause of his death. Our conclusion is that Beethoven's sensorineural hearing loss was an immunopathy associated with IBD.\n\n[Johann van Beethoven (1776-1848)].\n\nPubMed\n\nEikermann, Erika\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe article about the life and achievements of the apothecary Johann van Beethoven, the younger brother of the composer Ludwig van Beethoven, depicts a vivid picture of life in the 18th, 19t century. Research on archived original documents in Bonn, Vienna and Linz on the Danube made it possible to reveal details about the relationship inside this famous family and describes the hurdles of life of a successful apothecary. In 1776 Johann van Beethoven was born as the fourth child of the Beethoven family, a family of Bonner musicians. In 1790 he began his apprenticeship to become an apothecary at the Bonner \"Hofapotheke\". Towards the end of 1795 he moved to join his older brothers Ludwig and Karl in Vienna. During his time there he worked as a \"subject\" in various Viennese pharmacies. However in 1808 he purchased the pharmacy \"Zur Goldenen Krone\" in Linz on the Danube. His new pharmacy flourished, supplying first the Napoleonic occupation troops, and later the Austrian Military with medicines and field dressing/bandage materials. When in 1812 he married his Housekeeper, his Brother Ludwig opposed harshly, on reasons of social status and on moral grounds. Four years later, in 1816 Johann sold the pharmacy in Linz and founded a new pharmacy in Urfahr, on the opposite bank of the Danube. In 1819 he became a squire (or landowner), when he purchased a manor estate in Gneixendorf, near Krems on the Danube. In spite of his numerous duties as an apothecary and squire, Johann was frequently resident in Vienna, supporting his brother both emotionally and pharmaceutically. At the end of his life Johann sold both his pharmacy and the Gneixendorf estate, and spent his last years as a private gentleman living a dazzling lifestyle in Vienna. He died on January 12th 1848 and was buried in Vienna's \"WaldmÃ¼llerpark\".\n\nLead and the deafness of Ludwig van Beethoven.\n\nPubMed\n\nStevens, Michael H; Jacobsen, Teemarie; Crofts, Alicia Kay\n\n2013-11-01\n\nTo reexamine the cause of Beethoven's hearing loss because of significant recent articles. Medical and musical literature online, in print, and personal communication. Relevant literature review. Evidence of otosclerosis is lacking because close gross examination of Beethoven's middle ears at autopsy did not find any otosclerotic foci. His slowly progressive hearing loss over a period of years differs from reported cases of autoimmune hearing loss, which are rapidly progressive over a period of months. He also lacked bloody diarrhea that is invariably present with autoimmune inflammatory bowel disease. The absence of mercury in Beethoven's hair and bone samples leads us to conclude that his deafness was not due to syphilis because in that era syphilis was treated with mercury. High levels of lead deep in the bone suggest repeated exposure over a long period of time rather than limited exposure prior to the time of death. The finding of shrunken cochlear nerves at his autopsy is consistent with axonal degeneration due to heavy metals such as lead. Chronic low-level lead exposure causes a slowly progressive hearing loss with sensory and autonomic findings, rather than the classic wrist drop due to motor neuropathy from sub-acute poisoning. Beethoven's physicians thought that he had alcohol dependence. He particularly liked wine that happened to be tainted with lead. Beethoven's chronic consumption of wine tainted with lead is a better explanation of his hearing loss than other causes.

In this article all primary source documents related to Beethoven's terminal illness and death are reviewed. The documents include his letters, the report of his physician Andreas Wawruch, his Conversation Books, the autopsy report, and a new toxicological report of his hair. His terminal illness was characterised by jaundice, ascites, ankle oedema and abdominal pain. The autopsy data indicate that Beethoven had cirrhosis of the liver, and probably also renal papillary necrosis, pancreatitis and possibly diabetes mellitus. His lifestyle for at least the final decade of his life indicated that he overindulged in alcohol in the form of wine. Alcohol was by far the most common cause of cirrhosis at that period. Toxicological analysis of his hair showed that the level of lead was elevated. During the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, lead was added illegally to inexpensive wines to sweeten and refresh them. These findings strongly suggest that liver failure secondary to alcoholic cirrhosis, associated with terminal spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, was the cause of death. This was complicated in the end stages by renal failure. If the presence of endogenous lead was verified by analysis of Beethoven's skeletal remains, it would suggest that the lead was derived from wine that he drank. Lead poisoning may account for some of his end-of-life symptoms. There is little clinical or autopsy evidence that Beethoven suffered from syphilis.\n\nFederal Republic of Germany, A Country Study.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1982-02-01\n\npride.

The facial nerves were enlarged and the eighth nerves atrophied despite their sharing a common meatus at the internal auditory canal. Nephrolithiasis and pyelonephritis with cortical and perinephric abscesses were also reported. The hypercalcaemia was probably caused by hyperparathyroidism, which may be associated with Paget's disease, and both may have played a role in his psychiatric symptoms as well as in his abdominal pain and gastrointestinal complaints. Since Paget's disease may also be associated with gout, some of the joint pains could be attributable to this as well. Hypovitaminosis A from chronic pancreatitis is suggested as a cause of painful eyes and either quinine abuse or severe hypercalcaemia as a cause of arrhythmias. Beethoven died of terminal cirrhosis with chronic pancreatitis, most likely related to chronic excessive intake of alcohol. Thus, Paget's disease, complicated by hyperparathyroidism, gout, and attempts to find relief of symptoms through the use of alcohol, quinine, and possibly salicylates can explain virtually all of Beethoven's medical problems, some of which appear to have influenced his musical compositions.\n\nLow-level laser therapy of tinnitus: A case for the dentist?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTuner, Jan\n\n2001-04-01\n\nTinnitus is a debilitating condition with an increasing incidence, especially among the young generation, due to intensive sound levels at concerts and in headsets. It is, however, not solely a problem of the modern world. The condition is described in papyrus documents dating back 600 BC. Some famous historic persons have suffered from tinnitus, such as Martin Luther, Jean-Jaques Rousseau and Ludwig van Beethoven. It is estimated that roughly one person in ten is affected by tinnitus of some degree. The origin of tinnitus is controversial. It is claimed that tinnitus is located in the inner ear but also that it actually is situated in the brain cortex, as evidenced by PET-scanning.\n\nLudwig: My Pedagogical Part\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBeckett, David\n\n2009-01-01\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein taught only a couple of Australian philosophers, at Cambridge in the late 1940s, and one of them, Frank \"Camo\" Jackson (Chair, Philosophy, Monash University) taught the author epistemology and philosophical psychology in the 1970s.

Species identification in leather used during manufacturing is the key step to start such a restoration process in order to produce a facsimile of a museum piano. Our study reveals the species identification in the leather covering the hammer head in a piano created by Erard in 1802. This is the last existing piano similar to the piano that Beethoven used with its leather preserved in its original state. The leather sample was not present in a homogeneous piece, yet combined with glue. Using a DNA extraction method that avoids PCR inhibitors; we discovered that sheep and cattle are the origin of the combination. To identify the species in the leather, we focused on the amounts of mitochondrial DNA in both leather and glue and results have led us to the conclusion that the leather used to cover the hammer head in this piano was made of cattle hide.\n\n[Airway management in Ludwig's angina - a challenge: case report].\n\nPubMed\n\nFellini, Roberto Taboada; Volquind, Daniel; Schnor, OtÃ¡vio Haygert; Angeletti, Marcelo Gustavo; Souza, OlÃ­via Egger de\n\nLudwig's angina (LA) is an infection of the submandibular space, first described by Wilhelm Frederick von Ludwig in 1836. It represents an entity difficult to manage due to the rapid progression and difficulty in maintaining airway patency, a major challenge in medical practice, resulting in asphyxia and death in 8-10% of patients. Describe a case of a patient with Ludwig's angina undergoing surgery, with emphasis on airway management, in addition to reviewing the articles published in the literature on this topic. Male patient, 21 years, drug addict, admitted by the emergency department and diagnosed with LA. Difficult airway was identified during the anesthetic examination. In additional tests, significant deviation from the tracheal axis was seen. Undergoing bilateral thoracoscopic pleural drainage, we opted for airway management through tracheal intubation using fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and balanced general anesthesia was proposed. There were no complications during the surgical-anesthetic act. After the procedure, the patient remained intubated and mechanically ventilated in the intensive care unit. Airway management in patients with Ludwig's angina remains challenging. The choice of the safest technique should be based on clinical signs, technical conditions available, and the urgent need to preserve the patient's life.

This implicit statistical knowledge can be alternatively expressed via abstract medium such as musical melody, which suggests this knowledge is reflected in melodies written by a composer. This study investigates how statistics in music vary over a composer's lifetime. Transitional probabilities of highest-pitch sequences in Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata were calculated based on different hierarchical Markov models. Each interval pattern was ordered based on the sonata opus number. The transitional probabilities of sequential patterns that are musical universal in music gradually decreased, suggesting that time-course variations of statistics in music reflect time-course variations of a composer's statistical knowledge. This study sheds new light on novel methodologies that may be able to evaluate the time-course variation of composer's implicit knowledge using musical scores.\n\n[Carl Ludwig and his place in the history of kidney physiology].\n\nPubMed\n\nFrom, Jesper\n\n2015-01-01\n\nOnly very little was known about the physiology of the kidneys until the middle of the 19th century. The turning point came in 1842 when the famous German physiologist and physician Carl Ludwig (1816-1895) presented a theory about a two-step process (filtration and reabsorption) leading to the excretion of urine. This paper turns the highlights on Ludwig and the period in which he lived. It also tells the story about the anatomical studies in the 17th century and the chemical approaches to urine and kidney physiology in the 18th century preceding the research of Carl Ludwig. The theory of filtration and reabsorption was opposed by another theory (the secretion theory) regarding the kidney as a gland, like for instance the salivary glands. The origin of this theory can be dated back to Marcello Malpighi (1628-1694) in the Renaissance, but it was carried further on by William Bowman (1816-1892) and especially Rudolph Heidenhain (1834-1897) in the 19th century. The research in the 1920's and 1930's marked the end of the fight between the two theories. It proofed that Ludwig was right and it gave him posthumously the recognition that he all the time had deserved.\n\nLudwig Franz Benedikt Biermann: the doyen of German post-war astrophysics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWielebinski, Richard\n\n2015-11-01\n\nLudwig Biermann was a major figure in theoretical astrophysics in Germany in the twentieth century.

Her oral examination showed trismus, elevated tongue and neck swelling. A clinical diagnosis of Ludwig's angina was reached, and empirical antibiotic coverage was started. The decompression and drainage placement was performed successfully under local anesthesia without airway compromise. At the moment, no clear guidelines exist for the acute treatment of Ludwig's angina. Establishment of a secure airway has long been considered the gold standard, yet new literature suggests a more conservative management. Ascertaining an early diagnosis at the Emergency Department, and involvement of Anesthesia, Obstetrics, and, Ear, Nose and Throat specialist services is vital for materno-fetal wellbeing. Careful evaluation of the airway status in addition to prompt antimicrobial therapy with surgical decompression may represent a plausible alternative in pregnant patients.\n\n[Ludwig II of Bavaria - the \"fairy tale king\": his last years from a psychiatric point of view].\n\nPubMed\n\nV Zerssen, D\n\n2010-11-01\n\nLudwigÂ II of Bavaria (Germany) entered the political stage at the age of 18, following the premature death of his father Maximilian II in 1864. At that time, Ludwig was a very handsome, slender young man; he was enthusiastic and had a pronounced taste for fine arts and music, and was admired by the people as a \"fairy tale king\". However, already during the first years of his reign, he displayed traits that fulfilled the ICD-10 criteria for schizotypal disorder together with a combined cluster B personality disorder. They became even more pronounced over time. Towards the end of his life, Ludwig developed \"imperial madness\", a typical pattern of behavioural excesses including craving for power, splendour, construction, unrestrained spending, excessive eating and sexual exploitation, revenge with a tendency for cruelty, and an inclination for theatrical and sometimes irrational acts. This complex syndrome is usually manifested in excessively egocentric rulers who have almost unlimited power or, in the case of LudwigÂ II, an overwhelming desire to possess it. His imperial madness was possibly contributed to by an orbitofrontal brain syndrome. One conjecture is that this condition reflected a neurodegenerative process; another is that a primary deficit, initiated by brain damage following a severe bout of meningitis during Ludwig's babyhood, played a role. In this case, functional compensation by other brain areas may have eventually been counteracted by chronic substance abuse in his thirties. The monarch's life ended tragically when he was 40 by which time he had become adipose and had lost most of his teeth; meanwhile, he was placed under tutelage, dismissed and detained. Before his death by drowning in Lake Starnberg (suicide? attempted escape??), Ludwig apparently killed his psychiatrist, Bernhard von Gudden, who carelessly served as his sole attendant. Yet Ludwig's image as the beautiful fairy tale king is still alive in the hearts of successive generations of\n\nBedside ultrasound of the soft tissue of the face: a case of early Ludwig's angina.\n\nPubMed\n\nGaspari, Romolo J\n\n2006-10-01\n\nA case is reported of a 38-year-old man presenting with early Ludwig's angina.

He is survived by his wife Cheryl M. (Oroian) and his two children by a previous marriage, Ulrika and Mattias Oster. He had a distinguished career both as a researcher in solar physics and as a science administrator in the National Science Foundation. Ludwig was born on 8 March 1931 in Konstanz, Germany and emigrated to the U.S. in 1958, acquiring American citizenship in 1963. His mother and father were Emma Josefine (Schwarz) and Ludwig Friedrich Oster. He got a BS degree in physics at the University of Freiburg under the guidance of Prof. K. O. Kiepenheuer in 1951, and a MS (1954) and PhD from the University of Kiel in 1956 under the guidance of Prof. A. Unsold. From 1956 to 1958 he was a Fellow of the German Science Council at Kiel and, upon his arrival to the US in 1958, he became a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Physics Department of Yale University. He became an Assistant Professor of Physics and Astrophysics at Yale in 1960 and five years later he was promoted to Associate Professor. In 1967 he became an Associate Professor of Physics and Astrophysics at the University of Colorado and a Fellow of the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics; he was promoted to Full Professor in 1970. In 1981 he was a Visiting Professor at Johns Hopkins University, and shortly thereafter became a National Research Council Senior Associate at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD, where he worked on solar variability. He joined the National Science Foundation in 1983, where he became the Program Manager for the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in the Division of Astronomical Sciences of the Foundation; he remained there until his retirement in 1996. His early work, started in Germany and continued at Yale, concerned radiation mechanisms related to solar phenomena.

Individuals with early stage of Ludwig's angina were studied using a retrospective cohort study design from August 1997 to September 2017. Data were collected from case notes and logbooks. Appropriate statistical tests were chosen to analyse the independent and outcome variables. Using two-tailed test, a level of significance of 0.05 was chosen. A total of 55 patients comprising 38 (69.1%) males and 17 (30.9%) females were studied. The conservative group had a higher number of cases that developed airway compromise (26.3%) when compared to those with surgical approach (2.9%). There was an association between the treatment approach and the development of airway compromise (X2(1) = 4.83, p = 0.03). There was a higher incidence of airway compromise in patients treated with intravenous antibiotics alone than in those treated with surgical decompression and intravenous antibiotics.

Research showed that a satisfactory resolution of the crisis of adolescence can be favoured by psychological counselling based on artistic mediations. The objective of this study consisted in exploring the effect of music on the pictorial expression of a non clinical sample of female adolescents (N=157) aged from 17 to 28 years. We analysed free drawings realised by the test group with the help of a rating scale constructed in a phenomenological and structural perspective (Schiltz, 2006). The adolescents painted under musical induction. We proposed three different styles of music, i.e. baroque music (Georg Friedrich HÃ¤ndel and Johann Sebastian Bach), classical music (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven) and polish ethnical music (Kapela ze Wsi Warszawa-Warsaw Village Band). By using non parametric inferential and multi dimensional statistics, we could show that structural characteristics of music styles lead to differences in formal and content variables on the rating scales for the pictures. The results of our exploratory study open some tracks for future research. It would be pertinent to enlarge the population to other categories of age and to investigate the influence of gender.\n\nA short biography of Hubert Ludwig and a note on the publication dates of his monograph Die Seewalzen (1889-1892).\n\nPubMed\n\nReich, Mike\n\n2015-12-03\n\nThe dates of publication of Hubert Ludwig's (1852-1913) comprehensive monograph Die Seewalzen [= Sea cucumbers] are reviewed.

In this study, we addressed this question through an examination of value judgments in written criticism of recorded performance. One hundred reviews of recordings of Beethoven's piano sonatas, published in the Gramophone between 1934 and 2010, were analyzed through a three-step qualitative analysis that identified the valence (positive/negative) expressed by critics' statements and the evaluation criteria that underpinned their judgments. The outcome is a model of the main evaluation criteria used by professional critics: aesthetic properties, including intensity, coherence, and complexity, and achievement-related properties, including sureness, comprehension, and endeavor. The model also emphasizes how critics consider the suitability and balance of these properties across the musical and cultural context of the performance. The findings relate directly to current discourses on the role of evaluation in music criticism and the generalizability of aesthetic principles. In particular, the perceived achievement of the performer stands out as a factor that drives appreciation of a recording.

You can imagine this from his books on music, chess, and neuroscience. Indeed, he adored playing correspondence chess worldwide. A sportsman too, he loved hiking, mountaineering, skiing, swimming, and fishing. Nature was his source for slowing down, for regenerating, and for collecting his strength for new projects and new challenges.

These potentially lethal infections are difficult to recognize in early stages and are often associated with predisposing factors like diabetes and immunocompromised states. Moreover, IgG hypogammaglobulinemia (hypo-IgG) is considered to be a risk factor of mortality in patients with septic shock; however, it is not routinely quantified in patients with extremely serious infections, particularly in cases with no history or evidence of immunocompromising disorders. Patient concerns: We present a case of a 58-year-old woman who survived Ludwig angina, complicated by CNF and DNM. Despite a rapid diagnosis, aggressive surgical debridement and broad-spectrum antibiotics, the infection and necrosis advanced, requiring multiple surgical interventions and long intensive care unit (ICU) support. Conclusion: We hypothesize that detecting a low level of endogenous IgG and treating with adjuvant passive immunotherapy was key in determining a favorable outcome.

As a scholar in Cambdrige University, his philosophical achievements are still major regarding the foundations of mathematics and language. In 1939, he took a job as a porter at London Guys' Hospital then under the Blitz. Wittgenstein met Drs. Grant and Reeve who worked in a dedicated \"traumatic shock\" under the auspices of the Medical Research Council unit, a unit which then moved to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle; Wittgenstein followed them as a technician and improved the preparation of fine pieces of histology fixed by paraffin. He also invented a new device to record pulse pressure and paradoxical pulse search in laboratory rats. At the end of the war, he returned to Cambridge until 1949 and died in 1951.\n\nAlbert Ludwig Sigesmund Neisser: discoverer of the cause of gonorrhea.\n\nPubMed\n\nLigon, B Lee\n\n2005-10-01\n\nThe history of sexually transmitted diseases is thought to date back to earliest times, and many ancient texts describe conditions that may be those of syphilis and gonorrhea, which at one time were thought to be the same disease. A main figure in the research in this area was Albert Ludwig Sigesmund Neisser, who discovered the gonococcus in 1879 and later produced the most comprehensive account of experimental syphilis ever published. This article provides a brief biography of Albert Neisser, focusing on his discoveries in the area of infectious diseases, the so-called Neisser-Hansen controversy, and the situation leading to changes in defining bioethics.\n\nBeethoven recordings reviewed: a systematic method for mapping the content of music performance criticism.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlessandri, Elena; Williamson, Victoria J; Eiholzer, Hubert; Williamon, Aaron\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCritical reviews offer rich data that can be used to investigate how musical experiences are conceptualized by expert listeners. However, these data also present significant challenges in terms of organization, analysis, and interpretation. This study presents a new systematic method for examining written responses to music, tested on a substantial corpus of music criticism. One hundred critical reviews of Beethoven's piano sonata recordings, published in the Gramophone between August 1934 and July 2010, were selected using in-depth data reduction (qualitative/quantitative approach). The texts were then examined using thematic analysis in order to generate a visual descriptive model of expert critical review. This model reveals how the concept of evaluation permeates critical review. It also distinguishes between two types of descriptors. The first characterizes the performance in terms of specific actions or features of the musical sound (musical parameters, technique, and energy); the second appeals to higher-order properties (artistic style, character and emotion, musical structure, communicativeness) or assumed performer qualities (understanding, intentionality, spontaneity, sensibility, control, and care). The new model provides a methodological guide and conceptual basis for future studies of critical review in any genre.\n\nCeremony 25th birthday Cern\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNone\n\n2006-05-08\n\nCÃ©lÃ©bration du 25Ã¨me anniversaire du Cern (jour par jour) avec discours de L.Van Hove et J.B.Adams, des interludes musicals offerts par Mme Mey et ses collÃ¨gues (au debut 1.mouvement du quatuor avec piano no 3 de L.van Beethoven) Les directeurs gÃ©nÃ©raux procÃ©deront Ã la remise du souvenir aux membres de personnel ayant 25 annÃ©es de service dans l'organisation.

He is regarded as the founder of the field of comparative neuroanatomy. Modern commentators have misunderstood him to have espoused an anti-Darwinian linear view of brain evolution, harkening to the metaphysics of the scala naturae. This understanding arises, in part, from an increasingly contested view of nineteenth-century morphology in Germany. Edinger did espouse a progressionist, though not strictly linear, view of forebrain evolution, but his work also provided carefully documented evidence that brain stem structures vary in complexity independently from one another and across species in a manner that is not compatible with linear progress. This led Edinger to reject progressionism for all brain structures other than the forebrain roof, based on reasoning not too dissimilar from those his successors used to dismiss it for the forebrain roof.\n\nCeremony 25th birthday Cern\n\nScienceCinema\n\nNone\n\n2018-05-18\n\nCelebration of CERN's 25th birthday with a speech by L.

His method, the so-called \"infiltration anaesthesia\", did not receive due attention from his surgeon colleagues right from the beginning. This, however, was partly a fault of Schleich himself. The initial restraint, however, changed within a few years and became soon known as the \"first great medical feat in the discipline of German surgery\". At the same time, the fact that he had been rejected in the beginning was criticised as a \"disgrace for surgery\". Schleich experienced the same ignorance and refusal when he demanded that only specially trained physicians should perform any kind of anaesthesia. Moreover, these specialists should be responsible for the training of younger colleagues, a revolutionary concept at that time in Germany. Unfortunately, all these ideas and efforts of Schleich to develop a new concept of anaesthesia techniques have fallen into oblivion, a concept that started with his \"infiltration anaesthesia\" 100 years ago.\n\nGeorge Hartley Bryan, Ludwig Boltzmann, and the Stability of Flight\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBoyd, T. James M.\n\n2012-03-01\n\nA century ago, George Hartley Bryan (1864-1928) published his classic book, Stability in Aviation. I draw together some strands from events that awakened his interest in the nascent science of aviation, in particular the stability of flight. Prominent among those who influenced him was Ludwig Boltzmann (1844-1906), who held Bryan in high esteem for his contributions to thermodynamics and kinetic theory. I argue that the seeds of Bryan's interest in aviation were sown at the British Association meeting at Oxford in the summer of 1894, at which Boltzmann was guest of honor. A joint discussion between Section A (Mathematical and Physical Science) and Section G (Mechanical Science) was devoted to the problems of flight, during the course of which Boltzmann revealed a hitherto unsuspected enthusiasm for flying.\n\nLudwig von Bertalanffy's organismic view on the theory of evolution.\n\nPubMed\n\nDrack, Manfred\n\n2015-03-01\n\nLudwig von Bertalanffy was a key figure in the advancement of theoretical biology. His early considerations already led him to recognize the necessity of considering the organism as a system, as an organization of parts and processes. He termed the resulting research program organismic biology, which he extended to all basic questions of biology and almost all areas of biology, hence also to the theory of evolution. This article begins by outlining the rather unknown (because often written in German) research of Bertalanffy in the field of theoretical biology. The basics of the organismic approach are then described. This is followed by Bertalanffy's considerations on the theory of evolution, in which he used methods from theoretical biology and then introduced his own, organismic, view on evolution, leading to the demand for finding laws of evolution. Finally, his view on the concept of homology is presented.

Previous research has focused on how different characteristics of music (i.e., classical versus country) affect the brain. Yet, when listening to preferred music--regardless of the type--people report they often experience personal thoughts and memories. To date, understanding how this occurs in the brain has remained elusive. Using network science methods, we evaluated differences in functional brain connectivity when individuals listened to complete songs. We show that a circuit important for internally-focused thoughts, known as the default mode network, was most connected when listening to preferred music. We also show that listening to a favorite song alters the connectivity between auditory brain areas and the hippocampus, a region responsible for memory and social emotion consolidation. Given that musical preferences are uniquely individualized phenomena and that music can vary in acoustic complexity and the presence or absence of lyrics, the consistency of our results was unexpected. These findings may explain why comparable emotional and mental states can be experienced by people listening to music that differs as widely as Beethoven and Eminem. The neurobiological and neurorehabilitation implications of these results are discussed.\n\nNetwork Science and the Effects of Music Preference on Functional Brain Connectivity: From Beethoven to Eminem\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWilkins, R.

We identified 43 vanA-positive Ent.Â faecium isolates, including two vancomycin-susceptible isolates, from hospitals between 2003 and 2006. Of these isolates, >85% were resistant to ampicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. The vanA cluster was classified into six types using overlapping PCR, but the prototype transposon Tn1546 was not found. Most vanA-positive vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) carried IS1216V and belonged to Type III (58Â·1%) or Type II (20Â·9%). vanY, vanZ and IS1216V were observed in the left and right ends of Type III with long-range PCR. IS1216V was also observed within vanS and vanX in the two vancomycin-susceptible isolates and in two vancomycin-resistant isolates. No VRE isolates with VanB and VanD phenotypes contained point mutations in vanS, unlike in previous reports. Sequence types (STs) of all isolates belonged to clonal complex 17, and ST78 was predominant. Insertion sequences, especially IS1216V, cause structural variation in the vanA cluster. We report the first observation of vanY and vanZ at the left end of Tn1546 in clinical isolates. This is the first report of the frequency of vancomycin resistance and diversity of Tn1546 in vanA-positive Ent.Â faecium isolates from nontertiary hospitals.

A detailed description of the implant curriculum at Albert-Ludwigs University is given with documented exemplary cases and additional flow charts. All students participate in 28 hours of lectures and approximately 64 hours of seminars with hands-on courses and gain clinical experience. All undergraduate students are eligible to place and restore oral implants. Emphasis is placed on prosthetic-driven planning of implant positions, three-dimensional imaging, and computer-guided implant placement. Implant restorations performed by undergraduate students comprise single crowns and small multiunit fixed dental prostheses in partially edentulous posterior maxillae and anterior or posterior mandibles, implant-retained overdentures (snap attachment) in edentulous patients, and telescopic fixed-removable dental prostheses on remaining teeth and strategically placed additional implants. Over the past 2.5 years, 51 patients were treated with 97 dental implants placed by students in the undergraduate program. Seventy-one restorations were inserted: 60.6% single crowns, 7% fixed dental protheses, 21.1% overdentures, and 11.3% telescopic fixed-removable dental prostheses. The implant survival rate was 98.9%. Because survival rates for dental implants placed and restored by students are comparable to those of experienced dentists, oral implant dentistry should be implemented as part of the undergraduate dental curriculum.\n\nTracing Spasmodic Dysphonia: The Source of Ludwig Traube's Priority.\n\nPubMed\n\nLorch, Marjorie Perlman; Whurr, Renata\n\n2016-08-01\n\nSince the mid-20th century, one citation is given historical priority as the first description of spasmodic dysphonia (SD): Ludwig Traube's 1871 case of the \"spastic form of nervous hoarseness.\" Our objective is to understand how this case serves as the foundation of understanding laryngeal movement disorders. The original German paper was located and translated. Bibliographical and bibliometric methods are used to determine the citation history of this original source over the past 140 years. Although secondary citations in contemporary publications typically credit Traube for establishing the clinical entity SD, his case does not conform to currently accepted diagnostic features. Citation patterns indicate the source of Traube's priority is publications by Arnold and Luchsinger, mid-20th-century ENT clinicians, particularly their influential 1965 textbook used to train US and UK clinicians on voice disorders for several generations. Sometimes secondary citations in medical literature lead to the inadvertent perpetuation of factual misrepresentation. The clinical picture of Traube's original case does not represent what clinicians would recognize as SD today. The rich 19th-century literature on voice disorders is a valuable resource for present day clinicians.

In this study, 28 strains belonging to the E. gallinarum/casseliflavus group isolated from cloacal swabs from laying hens were screened for the presence of vanC1. As confirmed by species-specific multiplex PCR, 11 vanC1-positive strains were identified as E. gallinarum. Surprisingly, one yellow pigmented strain, verified as E. casseliflavus by species-specific multiplex PCR, was also vanC1 positive; vanXYc and vanT were additionally detectable in this strain. To our knowledge, this is the first report of vanC1, vanXYc, and vanT in E. casseliflavus. The minimum inhibitory concentration of vancomycin was 4 mg/L. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR revealed that none of the clustered genes was expressed in this strain. Even if the genes seem not to be active, there is a certain risk that they will be transferred to other bacteria where they might be functionally expressed. Therefore, it may be advisable to expand the search for vanC1, vanXYc, and vanT from E. gallinarum to other (enterococcal) species. This study confirms that enterococci live up to their name as being reservoir bacteria and should therefore always be closely monitored.\n\nLudwig von Bertalanffy's Organismic View on the Theory of Evolution\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDrack, Manfred\n\n2015-01-01\n\nLudwig von Bertalanffy was a key figure in the advancement of theoretical biology.

The Olympic Games will be attended by 17,000 athletes to be followed by the Paralympic Games with 4200 athletes from 150 countries, participating in 20 different sports. This multicultural event has grown in the last 60 years from a small competition between British and Dutch athletes on the lawns of Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire. The Paralympic Movement was born out of the vision of Sir Ludwig Guttmann. Before World War II, most paraplegic patients died. Guttmann came to Stoke Mandeville Hospital in 1944 and instituted the modern treatment of spinal injuries which kept paraplegic patients alive. While exercise is an essential part of rehabilitation, developing strength and agility, and a paraplegic patient can only participate in competitive sport when he or she is fully rehabilitated so the sports movement grew out of the successful treatment of paraplegic patients.\n\nLudwig Edinger (1855-1918): founder of modern neuroanatomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nPrithishkumar, Ivan James\n\n2012-03-01\n\nLudwig Edinger, a German neurologist is considered as one of the founders of modern neuroanatomy. He was conferred the degree of Doctor of Medicine at the University of Strassburg. His observation of small living organisms under a microscope at an early age led him to study medicine. Edinger had many discoveries to his credit. He was the first to describe the ventral and dorsal spinocerebellar tracts, to distinguish between paleo-encephalon and neo-encephalon, and between paleo-cerebellum and neo-cerebellum. He coined the terms \"gnosis\" and \"praxis,\" which were later adopted in psychological descriptions of agnosia and apraxia. He identified the Edinger-Westphal nucleus in 1885 and was the first to describe the syndrome of thalamic pain. Edinger worked with renowned clinicians and published a large number of papers. He founded the Neurological Institute at the Goethe University in Frankfurt, which is the oldest neurological Institute in Germany. Edinger was a rare combination of a profound scientist, a brilliant teacher, a fine artist, and a noted hypnotist. While at the height of his career, he underwent a surgery and died a few hours later. It was his last will that his brain should be dissected in his own institute. It showed extraordinarily well-developed occipital lobes as well as other unusual features.

Professional musicians represent an ideal model in which to elicit experience-driven changes in the emotional processing domain. The changes of the central representation of emotional arousal due to musical expertise are still largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the electroencephalogram (EEG) correlates of experience-driven changes in the domain of emotional arousal. Therefore, the differences in perceived (subjective arousal via ratings) and physiologically measured (EEG) arousal between amateur and professional musicians were examined. A total of 15 professional and 19 amateur musicians listened to the first movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's 5th symphony (duration=â¼7.4min), during which a continuous 76-channel EEG was recorded. In a second session, the participants evaluated their emotional arousal during listening. In a tonic analysis, we examined the average EEG data over the time course of the music piece. For a phasic analysis, a fast Fourier transform was performed and covariance maps of spectral power were computed in association with the subjective arousal ratings. The subjective arousal ratings of the professional musicians were more consistent than those of the amateur musicians. In the tonic EEG analysis, a mid-frontal theta activity was observed in the professionals. In the phasic EEG, the professionals exhibited an increase of posterior alpha, central delta, and beta rhythm during high arousal. Professionals exhibited different and/or more intense patterns of emotional activation when they listened to the music. The results of the present study underscore the impact of music experience on emotional reactions. Copyright Â© 2014 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In the course of translating the seminal publications of Carl Ludwig and his disciple Pavel Petrovich Einbrodt into English, we became aware of some under-appreciated aspects of their work that contain useful insights into the history of the phenomenon now called respiratory arrhythmia. Ludwig observed arrhythmic effects of respiratory movements in experiments on dogs and horses and published his findings in 1847. He subsequently undertook further work on this problem, together with Einbrodt. Already in 1847 Ludwig had mentioned an exciting observation on the possible role of mechanical factors of the respiratory movements on the action of the heart in a dog in whom he had artificially induced bouts of coughing. Einbrodt decided to systematically develop methods to increase or decrease the pressure of the air the animal had to breathe. He observed that this procedure led to a greater or lesser degree of compression or decompression of all the organs in the thoracic cavity without apparently causing harmful consequences during the time of its application. How the mechanical influence of breathing affects cardiac activity during respiratory arrhythmia has been the subject of scientific discussions and controversies over a period of more than 150 years and is still unresolved. Recent publications suggest that cardiac mechano-electrical coupling plays an important role in the emergence of cardio-respiratory interdependence. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The nature of the molecular ligand that is recognised by the VanSA sensory component has not hitherto been identified. Here we employ purified, intact and active VanSA membrane protein (henceforth referred to as VanS) in analytical ultracentrifugation experiments to study VanS oligomeric state and conformation in the absence and presence of vancomycin. A combination of sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium in the analytical ultracentrifuge (SEDFIT, SEDFIT-MSTAR and MULTISIG analysis) showed that VanS in the absence of the ligand is almost entirely monomeric (molar mass Mâ=â45.7âkDa) in dilute aqueous solution with a trace amount of high molar mass material (Mâ~â200âkDa). The sedimentation coefficient s suggests the monomer adopts an extended conformation in aqueous solution with an equivalent aspect ratio of ~(12âÂ±â2). In the presence of vancomycin over a 33% increase in the sedimentation coefficient is observed with the appearance of additional higher s components, demonstrating an interaction, an observation consistent with our circular dichroism measurements. The two possible causes of this increase in s â either a ligand induced dimerization and/or compaction of the monomer are considered.

Bacteremia due to vanA Enterococcus faecium was diagnosed, and stool surveillance cultures for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) were positive for both vanA and vanB E. faecium. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that the 2 vanA VRE isolates from the blood and stool were clonal, but the vanB VRE was unrelated to the vanA VRE. vanA and vanB VRE were ST64 and ST18, single-allele variations of clonal complex 17, respectively. This is the first case report of vanA VRE bacteremia in a Vietnamese patient and demonstrates the reemergence of vanB VRE since a single outbreak occurred 15years ago in Korea. The reemergence of vanB VRE emphasizes the importance of VRE genotyping to prevent the spread of new VRE strains. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

He published a number of papers on the history of medicine, and was secretary of the Chicago Society of the History of Medicine and editor of their Bulletin. His major contribution to the history of medicine relates to the history of anatomical illustration. The classic book on that subject had been published in 1852 in German by the physician and historian, Johann Ludwig Choulant (1791-1861). However, by Frank's time this text was both out dated and out of print. Frank took on the tremendous project of translating Choulant's German text into English as History and Bibliography of Anatomic Illustration in Its Relation to Anatomic Science and The Graphic Arts. He improved Choulant's text with the results of his and other scholars' research, greatly enlarging the text. Frank supplemented the original book with a biography of Choulant, essays on anatomists not considered in the original text, and an essay on the history of anatomical illustration prior to those authors discussed by Choulant. This book, now referred to as Choulant/Frank, has been reprinted several times, and is still useful as a reference in this field, though some of its research is now dated.\n\n[What is thinking inside the individual? Figurations of Collectivity in Ludwik Fleck, Tadeusz Bilikiewicz, and Ludwig Gumplowicz].\n\nPubMed\n\nJohach, Eva\n\n2014-01-01\n\n\"What thinks in man, is not he himself, but his social community.\" These words by the early sociologist Ludwig Gumplowicz (1838â1909) were quoted several times by Ludwik Fleck (1896â1961) and seem to be in complete agreement with his own theory of thought collectives. The assumption that even scientific ideas were not so much generated by the scientist as an autonomous individual but rather by and within the social environment was still considered provocative by Fleck in the 1930s. This article will explore the implications of this assumption by comparing Fleck with Gumplowicz as well as with Tadeusz Bilikiewicz (1901â1980), a psychiatrist, philosopher and historian of medicine working like Fleck in the cultural milieu of LwÃ³w/Lemberg.\n\nAmino acid substitutions in the VanS sensor of the VanA-type vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus strains result in high-level vancomycin resistance and low-level teicoplanin resistance.\n\nPubMed\n\nHashimoto, Y; Tanimoto, K; Ozawa, Y; Murata, T; Ike, Y\n\n2000-04-15\n\nThe vancomycin-resistant enterococci GV1, GV2 and GV3, which were isolated from droppings from broiler farms in Japan have been characterized as VanA-type VRE, which express high-level vancomycin resistance (256 or 512 microg ml(-1), MIC) and low-level teicoplanin resistance (1 or 2 microg ml(-1), MIC). The vancomycin resistances were encoded on plasmids. The vancomycin resistance conjugative plasmid pMG2 was isolated from the GV2 strain. The VanA determinant of pMG2 showed the same genetic organization as that of the VanA genes encoded on the representative transposon Tn1546, which comprises vanRSHAXYZ. The nucleotide sequences of all the genes, except the gene related to the vanS gene on Tn1546, were completely identical to the genes encoded on Tn1546. Three amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal region of the deduced VanS were detected in the nucleotide sequence of vanS encoded on pMG2. There were also three amino acid substitutions in the vanS gene of the GV1 and GV3 strains in the same positions as in the vanS gene of pMG2. Vancomycin induced the increased teicoplanin resistance in these strains.\n\n19 CFR 10.41a - Lift vans, cargo vans, shipping tanks, skids, pallets, and similar instruments of international...\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-04-01\n\n... 19 Customs Duties 1 2011-04-01 2011-04-01 false Lift vans, cargo vans, shipping tanks, skids...

Their work is especially rooted in experimental biology as performed at the Biologische Versuchsanstalt, as well as in philosophy, and they converge in basic concepts. We underline the conceptual connections of their thinking, among them the organism as an organized system, hierarchical organization, and primary activity. With their system thinking, both biologists shared a strong desire to overcome what they viewed as a \"mechanistic\" approach in biology. Their interpretations are relevant to the renaissance of system thinking in biology--\"systems biology.\" Unless otherwise noted, all translations are our own.\n\nDefending commercial surrogate motherhood against Van Niekerk and Van Zyl.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMcLachlan, H V\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThe arguments of Van Niekerk and Van Zyl that, on the grounds that it involves an inappropriate commodification and alienation of women's labour, commercial surrogate motherhood (CSM) is morally suspect are discussed and considered to be defective. In addition, doubt is cast on the notion that CSM should be illegal.

This price includes return on preoperational investment. Recurring costs are expected to be about $840,000 per flight. The Space Van is a fully reusable, assisted-single-stage-to orbit system. The most innovative new feature of the Space Van system is the assist-stage concept. The assist stage uses only airbreathing engines for vertical takeoff and vertical landing in the horizontal attitude and for launching the rocket-powered orbiter stage at mach 0.8 and an altitude of about 12 km. The primary version of the orbiter is designed for cargo-only without a crew. However, a passenger version of the Space Van should be able to carry a crew of two plus six passengers to a space-station orbit. Since the Space Van is nearly single-stage, performance to polar orbit drops off significantly. The cargo version should be capable of carrying 350 kg to a 400-km polar orbit. In the passenger version, the Space Van should be able to carry two crew members - or one crew member plus a passenger.\n\nAlbrecht Ludwig Berblinger--inventor of the spring prosthesis and hang-glider (1811).\n\nPubMed\n\nHarsch, Viktor; Kriebel, Juergen\n\n2006-10-01\n\nAlbrecht Ludwig Berblinger (1770-1829), known as the \"Flying Tailor of Ulm\", started with flight experiments in Ulm, Germany, in the early 19th century. He gained experience in downhill gliding with a maneuverable airworthy semi-rigid hang-glider and then attempted to cross the Danube River at Ulm's Eagle's Bastion on the 31st of May 1811. The tricky local winds caused him to crash and he was rescued by fishermen, making him the first survivor of a water immersion accident of a heavier-than-air manned \"flight machine\". Though he failed in his attempt to be the first man to fly, Berblinger can be regarded as one of the significant aviation pioneers who applied the \"heavier than air\" principle and paved the way for the more effective glide-flights of Otto Lilienthal (1891) and the Wright Brothers (1902). Less known are Berblinger's significant contributions to the construction of artificial limbs for medical use, as well as the spring-application in aviation. His invention of a special mechanical joint was also used for the juncture of the wings of his \"flying machine\". Because of his worthwhile contributions to medicine and flight, in 1993 the German Academy of Aviation Medicine named an annual award for young scientists in the field of aerospace medicine in his honor.\n\nThe mechanisms of renal tubule electrolyte and water absorption, 100 years after Carl Ludwig.\n\nPubMed\n\nGreger, R\n\n1996-01-01\n\nSome 154 years after Carl Ludwig's Habilitationsschrift \"Contributions to the theory of the mechanism of urine secretion\" renal physiology has come a long way. The mechanisms of urine formation are now understood as the result of glomerular filtration and tubule absorption of most of the filtrate. The detailed understanding of tubule transport processes has become possible with the invention of several refined techniques such as the micropuncture techniques; the microchemical analysis of nanolitre tubule fluid samples; the in vitro perfusion of isolated tubule segments of defined origin; electrophysiological analysis of electrolyte transport including micropuncture and patch-clamp techniques; transport studies in membrane vesicle preparations; recordings of intracellular electrolyte concentrations and cloning techniques of the individual membrane transport proteins. With this wealth of information we are now starting to build an integrative understanding of the function of the individual nephron segments, the regulatory processes, the integrated function of the nephron and hence the formation of the final urine. Like anatomists of previous centuries we still state that the kidney is an \"organum mirable\" and we recognize that basic research in this area has fertilized the analysis of the function of a large number of other organs and cells.\n\nMentale Inzetbaarheid van Teams: Ontwikkeling van een Moden van Teamfunctioneren als Module voor SCOPE (Mental Readiness of Teams - Development of a Team Model as Module for SCOPE)\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2007-04-01\n\ninzetbaarheid van teams: ontwikkeling van een model van teamfunctioneren als module voor SCOPE Datumn april 2007 Auteur (s) R. de B~ruin C’.

The Van field structure is a complexly faulted domal anticline created by salt intrusion. The Woodbine sands, which underlie the Austin Chalk, have been and continue to be the predominant reservoir rocks in the field. Evidence indicates that faults provided vertical conduits for migration of Woodbine oil into the Austin Chalk where it was trapped along the structural crest. The most prolific Austin Chalk production is on the upthrown side of the main field fault, asmoreÂ Â» is the Woodbine. The Austin Chalk is a soft, white to light gray limestone composed mostly of coccoliths with some pelecypods. Unlike the Austin Chalk in the Giddings and Pearsall fields, the chalk at Van was not as deeply buried and therefore did not become brittle and susceptible to tensional or cryptic fracturing. The shallow burial in the Van field was also important in that it allowed the chalk to retain primary microporosity. The production comes entirely from this primary porosity. In addition to the structural position and underlying oil source from the Woodbine, the depositional environment and associated lithofacies are also keys to the reservoir quality in the Van field as demonstrated by cores from the upthrown and downthrown (less productive) sides of the main field fault. It appears that at the time of Austin Chalk deposition, the main field fault was active and caused the upthrown side to be a structural high and a more agreeable environment for benthonic organisms such as pelecypods and worms. The resulting bioturbation enhanced the reservoir's permeability enough to allow migration and entrapment of the oil. Future success in exploration for analogous Austin Chalk reservoirs will require the combination of a favorable environment of deposition, a nearby Woodbine oil source, and a faulted trap that will provide the conduit for migration.Â«Â less\n\nStirling Powered Van Progam overview\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nShaltens, R. K.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nThe Stirling Powered Van Program (SPVP) is a multiyear, multiphase program to evaluate the automotive Stirling engine (ASE) in Air Force vans under realistic conditions. The objective of the SPVP is to transfer to manufacturer and end user(s) (i.e., on the path to commercialization) the second-generation Mod 2 ASE upon completion of the Automotive Stirling Engine Program in 1987. In order to meet this objective, the SPVP must establish Stirling performance, integrity, reliability, durability and maintainability. The ASE program background leading to the van program is reviewed and plans for evaluating the kinematic Stirling engine in Air Force vans examined. Also discussed are the NASA technology transfers to industry that have been accomplished and those which are currently being developed.\n\nvanC Cluster of Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus gallinarum BM4174\n\nPubMed Central\n\nArias, Cesar A.; Courvalin, Patrice; Reynolds, Peter E.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nGlycopeptide-resistant enterococci of the VanC type synthesize UDP-muramyl-pentapeptide[d-Ser] for cell wall assembly and prevent synthesis of peptidoglycan precursors ending in d-Ala. The vanC cluster of Enterococcus gallinarum BM4174 consists of five genes: vanC-1, vanXYC, vanT, vanRC, and vanSC. Three genes are sufficient for resistance: vanC-1 encodes a ligase that synthesizes the dipeptide d-Ala-d-Ser for addition to UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide, vanXYC encodes a d,d-dipeptidaseâcarboxypeptidase that hydrolyzes d-Ala-d-Ala and removes d-Ala from UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide[d-Ala], and vanT encodes a membrane-bound serine racemase that provides d-Ser for the synthetic pathway. The three genes are clustered: the start codons of vanXYC and vanT overlap the termination codons of vanC-1 and vanXYC, respectively. Two genes which encode proteins with homology to the VanS-VanR two-component regulatory system were present downstream from the resistance genes. The predicted amino acid sequence of VanRC exhibited 50% identity to VanR and 33% identity to VanRB. VanSC had 40% identity to VanS over a region of 308 amino acids and 24% identity to VanSB over a region of 285 amino acids. All residues with important functions in response regulators and histidine kinases were conserved in VanRC and VanSC, respectively. Induction experiments based on the determination of d,d-carboxypeptidase activity in cytoplasmic extracts confirmed that the genes were expressed constitutively. Using a promoter-probing vector, regions upstream from the resistance and regulatory genes were identified that have promoter activity.

He arrived in Tokyo in October 1880 and taught at the Veterinary School in Komaba. During his tenure, the school in Komaba was integrated into the School of Agriculture of the Imperial University of Tokyo. Numerous of his graduates occupied high public offices. Among his publications, those about domestic animals and veterinary medicine in Japan deserve special attention. He married a Japanese girl and continued teaching in Komaba until 1902. He found his last resting place in Kagoshima, the native place of his wife. To this day, the Japanese consider Janson the founder of modern veterinary medicine in their country.\n\nCharacterisation of the selective binding of antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin by the VanS receptor regulating type A vancomycin resistance in the enterococci.\n\nPubMed\n\nHughes, C S; Longo, E; Phillips-Jones, M K; Hussain, R\n\n2017-08-01\n\nA-type resistance towards \"last-line\" glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin in the leading hospital acquired infectious agent, the enterococci, is the most common in the UK. Resistance is regulated by the VanR A S A two-component system, comprising the histidine sensor kinase VanS A and the partner response regulator VanR A . The nature of the activating ligand for VanS A has not been identified, therefore this work sought to identify and characterise ligand(s) for VanS A . In vitro approaches were used to screen the structural and activity effects of a range of potential ligands with purified VanS A protein. Of the screened ligands (glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin, and peptidoglycan components N-acetylmuramic acid, D-Ala-D-Ala and Ala-D-y-Glu-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala) only glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin were found to bind VanS A with different affinities (vancomycin 70Î¼M; teicoplanin 30 and 170Î¼M), and were proposed to bind via exposed aromatic residues tryptophan and tyrosine. Furthermore, binding of the antibiotics induced quicker, longer-lived phosphorylation states for VanS A , proposing them as activators of type A vancomycin resistance in the enterococci.

Both operons had regulatory (vanR and vanS), resistance (vanH, vanA, and vanX), and accessory (vanY, vanZ, and vanW) genes homologous to the corresponding genes in enterococcal vanA and vanB operons. The vanAPT operon in P. thiaminolyticus PT-2B1 had the same gene organization as that of vanA operons whereas vanAPA in P. apiarius PA-B2B resembled vanB operons due to the presence of vanW upstream from the vanHAX cluster but was closer to vanA operons in sequence. Reference P. apiarius strains NRRL B-4299 and NRRL B-4188 were found to harbor operons indistinguishable from vanAPA by PCR mapping, restriction fragment length polymorphism, and partial sequencing, suggesting that this operon was species specific. As in enterococci, resistance was inducible by glycopeptides and associated with the synthesis of pentadepsipeptide peptidoglycan precursors ending in d-Ala-d-Lac, as demonstrated by d,d-dipeptidase activities, high-pressure liquid chromatography, and mass spectrometry. The precursors differed from those in enterococci by the presence of diaminopimelic acid instead of lysine in the peptide chain.

Altogether, the results are compatible with the notion that van operons in soil Paenibacillus strains and in enterococci have evolved from a common ancestor.\n\nJao Van De Lagemaat | NREL\n\nScience.gov Websites\n\nJao Van De Lagemaat Photo of Jao Vandelagemaat.

He succumbed to heart failure after a ten-week period of declining health. Van Allen served for his entire sixty-seven-year professional career as an amazingly productive researcher, space science spokesman, inspired teacher, and valued colleague. The realization by him and his associates that charged particles are trapped by the Earth's magnetic field began a whole new field of research, magnetospheric physics. Following that initial discovery, he and his associates quickly extended their observations, first to the inner planets, and then to the rest of the planets and beyond. During his tenure at Iowa, he and his group flew instruments on more than sixty successful Earth satellites and planetary spacecraft, including the first missions to the planets Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Van Allen's lifetime publication list numbers more than 275, of which many are widely-cited, seminal papers. He was the sole author of more than 125 of those papers. Beyond the research laboratory, Van Allen worked energetically throughout his career in establishing space research as a new branch of human inquiry. He was among the most sought-after as a committee member and adviser, working at the highest levels of government, including the White House and Congress, and at all levels of the national and international research establishments. Many presentations in the non-scientific arena helped to bring the exciting discoveries and challenges of space research to the attention of the general public. James Van Allen (Van to his many friends and colleagues) was born on 7 September 1914 on a small farm near Mount Pleasant, Iowa, the second of four sons of Alfred Morris Van Allen and Alma Olney Van Allen. After high school in Mount Pleasant, he entered Iowa Wesleyan College, majoring in physics and graduating summa cum laude. While there, he was introduced to geophysics\n\nAn Improved Extrapolation Scheme for Truncated CT Data Using 2D Fourier-Based Helgason-Ludwig Consistency Conditions.\n\nPubMed\n\nXia, Yan; Berger, Martin; Bauer, Sebastian; Hu, Shiyang; Aichert, Andre; Maier, Andreas\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe improve data extrapolation for truncated computed tomography (CT) projections by using Helgason-Ludwig (HL) consistency conditions that mathematically describe the overlap of information between projections. First, we theoretically derive a 2D Fourier representation of the HL consistency conditions from their original formulation (projection moment theorem), for both parallel-beam and fan-beam imaging geometry. The derivation result indicates that there is a zero energy region forming a double-wedge shape in 2D Fourier domain. This observation is also referred to as the Fourier property of a sinogram in the previous literature. The major benefit of this representation is that the consistency conditions can be efficiently evaluated via 2D fast Fourier transform (FFT). Then, we suggest a method that extrapolates the truncated projections with data from a uniform ellipse of which the parameters are determined by optimizing these consistency conditions. The forward projection of the optimized ellipse can be used to complete the truncation data. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using simulated data and reprojections of clinical data. Results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) is reduced substantially, compared to a state-of"
