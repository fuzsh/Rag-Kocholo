Additional data on these objects will help with shape and spin axis modeling using lightcurve inversion. We also include lists of objects that will or might be radar targets. Lightcurves for these objects can help constrain pole solutions and/or remove rotation period ambiguities that might not come from using radar data alone.\n\nWe present several lists of asteroids that are prime targets for photometry during the period 2020 January-March\n\nIn the first three sets of tables, “Dec” is the declination and “U” is the quality code of the lightcurve. See the latest asteroid lightcurve data base (LCDB; Warner et al., 2009; Icarus 202, 134–146.) documentation for an explanation of the U code:\n\nhttp://www.minorplanet.info/lightcurvedatabase.html\n\nThe ephemeris generator on the CALL web site allows you to create custom lists for objects reaching V ≤ 18.0 during any month in the current year and up to five years in the future, e.g., limiting the results by magnitude and declination, family, and more.\n\nhttp://www.minorplanet.info/PHP/call_OppLCDBQuery.php\n\nWe refer you to past articles, e.g., Minor Planet Bulletin 36, 188, for more detailed discussions about the individual lists and points of advice regarding observations for objects in each list.\n\nOnce you’ve obtained and analyzed your data, it’s important to publish your results. Papers appearing in the Minor Planet Bulletin are indexed in the Astrophysical Data System (ADS) and so can be referenced by others in subsequent papers. It’s also important to make the data available at least on a personal website or upon request. We urge you to consider submitting your raw data to the ALCDEF database. This can be accessed for uploading and downloading data at\n\nhttp://www.alcdef.org\n\nContaining almost 3.6 million observations for 14840 objects (2019 Oct 6), we believe this to be the largest publicly available database of raw asteroid time-series lightcurve data.\n\nNow that many backyard astronomers and small colleges have access to larger telescopes, we have expanded the photometry opportunities and spin axis lists to include asteroids reaching V = 15.5 and brighter (sometimes 15.0 when the list has too many potential targets).\n\nLightcurve/Photometry Opportunities\n\nObjects with U = 3– or 3 are excluded from this list since they will likely appear in the list for shape and spin axis modeling. Those asteroids rated U = 1 should be given higher priority over those rated U = 2 or 2+, but not necessarily over those with no period. On the other hand, do not overlook asteroids with U = 2/2+ on the assumption that the period is sufficiently established. Regardless, do not let the existing period influence your analysis since even highly-rated result have been proven wrong at times. Note that the lightcurve amplitude in the tables could be more or less than what’s given. Use the listing only as a guide.\n\nAn entry in bold italics is a near-Earth asteroid (NEA).\n\nBrightestLCDB DataNumberNameDateMagDecPeriodAmpU3467Bernheim0105.915.1+234750Mukai0106.515.5+2438.30.402871352000 NU50109.515.5+130.764540Oriani0113.215.2+14641632001 TB490115.315.3+17946Poesia0116.413.8+23108.50.24–0.322+ 18172 2000 QL7 01 20.6 15.4 +68 3759Piironen0121.014.7+17409.8480.09–0.5627118Kuklov0121.215.5−10.45 437316 2013 OS3 01 21.5 14.8 +25 2075Martinez0121.614.2+304.7550.2821932Jansky0129.515.3+156141Durda0130.115.4−2460.0.502+3999Aristarchus0130.414.8+1712.580.302+1579Herrick0130.715.0+8468751998 QD1040131.415.5+1688.7340.472 5626 1991 FE 02 02.3 15.1 +11 133.6 0.07–0.44 2 3118Claytonsmith0203.114.9+1415.7940.4021678Hveen0204.114.9+265.9870.0722859Paganini0206.714.9+135824Inagaki0208.715.1+74931Tomsk0211.014.8+47.020.4623566Levitan0212.014.9+12 163373 2002 PZ39 02 12.0 14.3 +29 4904Makio0215.814.9−57.830.0822361Gogol0219.015.5+144194Sweitzer0220.615.3+104705Secchi0220.815.2+10104191998 XB40223.115.3+910143Kamogawa0223.815.2−10.093088Jinxiuzhonghua0226.315.4+56.0050.3123471Amelin0228.915.5+62452Lyot0302.815.3+131389Onnie0302.915.3+622.50.3425377Komori0305.115.5+55972Harryatkinson0305.715.1+101415Malautra0311.214.1+1>12.0.0311755Lorbach0311.214.8+75070Arai0312.315.4+153.0.3024227Kaali0314.715.3+5167041995 ED80315.115.1−11628Strobel0316.713.9−19.520.20–0.2224570Runcorn0316.914.8+0>20.0.122-2905Plaskett0319.715.3+3380791999 HF0321.215.5−27717Tabeisshi0324.015.4−870841991 BR0327.915.4+05.3080.1921179Mally0329.615.3−446.6920.081 331471 1984 QY1 03 29.7 15.3 +6 45.5 0.46–0.65 2 949Hel0331.013.0−178.2150.13–0.142+\n\nLow Phase Angle Opportunities\n\nThe Low Phase Angle list includes asteroids that reach very low phase angles. The “α” column is the minimum solar phase angle for the asteroid. Getting accurate, calibrated measurements (usually V band) at or very near the day of opposition can provide important information for those studying the “opposition effect.” Use the on-line query form for the LCDB to get more details about a specific asteroid.\n\nhttp://www.minorplanet.info/PHP/call_OppLCDBQuery.php\n\nYou will have the best chance of success working objects with low amplitude and periods that allow covering at least half a cycle every night. Objects with large amplitudes and/or long periods are much more difficult for phase angle studies since, for proper analysis, the data must be reduced to the average magnitude of the asteroid for each night. This reduction requires that you determine the period and the amplitude of the lightcurve; for long period objects that can be difficult. Refer to Harris et al. (1989; Icarus 81, 365–374) for the details of the analysis procedure.\n\nAs an aside, some use the maximum light to find the phase slope parameter (G). However, this can produce significantly different values for both H and G versus when using average light, which is the method used for values listed by the Minor Planet Center.\n\nThe International Astronomical Union (IAU) has adopted a new system, H-G12, introduced by Muinonen et al. (2010; Icarus 209, 542–555). It will be some years before H-G12 becomes widely used. Furthermore, it still needs refinement. That can be done mostly by having data for more asteroids, but only if at very low and moderate phase angles. We strongly encourage obtaining data every degree between 0° to 7°, the non-linear part of the curve that is due to the opposition effect. At angles a > 7°, well-calibrated data every 2° or so out to about 25–30°, if possible, should be sufficient. Coverage beyond about 50° is not generally helpful since the H-G system is best defined with data from 0–30°.\n\nNumNameDateαVDecPeriodAmpU389Industria0102.30.1811.0+238.530.18–0.3431196Sheba0102.90.1813.5+236.3190.21–0.283412Elisabetha0104.50.4412.8+2219.6350.08–0.2031292Luce0104.70.3314.1+226.9540.17–0.2631010Marlene0104.90.1814.4+2331.060.17–0.322+222Lucia0106.70.3614.0+247.8370.25–0.413498Tokio0106.90.7312.8+2541.850.23–0.233407Arachne0113.00.2112.1+2222.6270.30–0.313946Poesia0116.40.6113.8+23108.50.24–0.322+274Philagoria0120.00.7914.1+2317.9380.37–0.513863Benkoela0120.90.6913.4+228.200.05–0.273-537Pauly0121.10.0413.9+2016.1680.14–0.203112Iphigenia0130.90.3513.2+1931.4660.303816Juliana0201.60.6213.8+1910.5570.22–0.533860Ursina0202.30.3814.4+169.3860.22–0.5031274Delportia0203.60.8614.0+185.6150.05–0.2631503Kuopio0204.10.4113.1+179.9570.65–0.903622Esther0208.00.3812.9+1447.50.30–0.621266Tone0208.10.2614.1+167.400.06–0.12290Antiope0217.00.8013.3+1516.5090.05–0.883227Philosophia0220.10.3613.0+1026.4680.06–0.203231Vindobona0220.40.8413.6+1414.2450.20–0.29346Hestia0221.60.5912.2+0921.0400.09–0.123602Marianna0222.20.1713.1+1035.1950.07–0.173591Irmgard0224.70.2412.8+097.350.23–0.263582Olympia0225.20.1911.2+0936.3120.05–0.63101Helena0225.60.6712.2+1123.0800.09–0.133839Valborg0227.90.0514.5+0810.3660.14–0.19330Urania0229.60.7410.6+0613.6860.11–0.45366Maja0301.30.7812.9+099.7350.21–0.453538Friederike0304.00.9414.5+1046.7280.25–0.253184Dejopeja0306.40.2012.2+056.4420.22–0.33358Apollonia0308.80.1613.0+0450.60.15–0.153−124Alkeste0309.50.6111.3+039.9060.08–0.303122Gerda0309.80.1512.1+0410.6850.10–0.263477Italia0316.00.7513.9+0419.4130.15–0.323271Penthesilea0316.20.5514.2+0018.7870.23–0.3331628Strobel0316.80.9113.9−019.520.20–0.222569Misa0319.70.6813.4−0111.5950.09–0.253277Elvira0324.50.4114.1−0329.690.34–0.5931225Ariane0328.80.2214.1−035.5070.30–0.3632616Lesya0331.00.7614.9−039.2170.43–0.513300Geraldina0331.10.1714.4−046.8420.04–0.323671Carnegia0331.70.7114.4−068.3320.243−\n\nShape/Spin Modeling Opportunities\n\nThose doing work for modeling should contact Josef Ďurech at the email address above. If looking to add lightcurves for objects with existing models, visit the Database of Asteroid Models from Inversion Techniques (DAMIT) web site\n\nhttp://astro.troja.mff.cuni.cz/projects/asteroids3D\n\nAdditional lightcurves could lead to the asteroid being added to or improving one in DAMIT, thus increasing the total number of asteroids with spin axis and shape models.\n\nIncluded in the list below are objects that:\n\nAre rated U = 3– or 3 in the LCDB\n\nDo not have reported pole in the LCDB Summary table\n\nHave at least three entries in the Details table of the LCDB where the lightcurve is rated U ≥ 2.\n\nThe caveat for condition #3 is that no check was made to see if the lightcurves are from the same apparition or if the phase angle bisector longitudes differ significantly from the upcoming apparition. The last check is often not possible because the LCDB does not list the approximate date of observations for all details records. Including that information is an on-going project.\n\nFavorable apparitions are in bold text.

It is very common for newly discovered objects to move up the list and become radar targets on short notice. We recommend that you keep up with the latest discoveries the Minor Planet Center observing tools\n\nIn particular, monitor NEAs and be flexible with your observing program. In some cases, you may have only 1–3 days when the asteroid is within reach of your equipment. Be sure to keep in touch with the radar team (through Dr. Benner’s email or their Facebook or Twitter accounts) if you get data. The team may not always be observing the target but your initial results may change their plans. In all cases, your efforts are greatly appreciated.\n\nUse the ephemerides below as a guide to your best chances for observing, but remember that photometry may be possible before and/or after the ephemerides given below. Note that geocentric positions are given. Use these web sites to generate updated and topocentric positions:\n\nMPC: http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/MPEph/MPEph.html\n\nJPL: http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons\n\nIn the ephemerides below, ED and SD are, respectively, the Earth and Sun distances (AU), V is the estimated Johnson V magnitude, and α is the phase angle. SE and ME are the great circle distances (in degrees) of the Sun and Moon from the asteroid. MP is the lunar phase and GB is the galactic latitude. “PHA” indicates that the object is a “potentially hazardous asteroid”, meaning that at some (long distant) time, its orbit might take it very close to Earth.\n\nAbout YORP Acceleration\n\nMany, if not all, of the targets in this section are near-Earth asteroids. These objects are particularly sensitive to YORP acceleration. YORP (Yarkovsky–O’Keefe–Radzievskii–Paddack) is the asymmetric thermal re-radiation of sunlight that can cause an asteroid’s rotation period to increase or decrease. High precision lightcurves at multiple apparitions can be used to model the asteroid’s sidereal rotation period and see if it’s changing.\n\nIt usually takes four apparitions to have sufficient data to determine if the asteroid rotation rate is changing under the influence of YORP. This is why observing asteroids that already have well-known periods remains a valuable use of telescope time. It is even more so when considering the BYORP (binary-YORP) effect among binary asteroids that has stabilized the spin so that acceleration of the primary body is not the same as if it would be if there were no satellite.\n\nTo help focus efforts in YORP detection, gives a quick summary of this quarter’s radar-optical targets. The family or group for the asteroid is given under the number name. Also under the name will be additional flags such as “PHA” for Potentially Hazardous Asteroid, NPAR for a tumbler, and/or “BIN” to indicate the asteroid is a binary (or multiple) system. “BIN?” means that the asteroid is a suspected but not confirmed binary. The period is in hours and, in the case of binary, for the primary. The Amp column gives the known range of lightcurve amplitudes. The App columns gives the number of different apparitions at which a lightcurve period was reported while the Last column gives the year for the last reported period. The R SNR column indicates the estimated radar SNR using the tool at\n\nTable I.\n\nAsteroidPeriodAmpAppLastRSNR(437316) 2013 OS3––––A32NEAG–2012 RK15–––A260NEAG90(163373) 2002 PZ39––––A800NEAG270(35107) 1991 VH2.6230.0852014A–NEA BIN0.15G–2011 EH––––A890NEAG3002017 BM1232.1500.3712017A105NEA NHATSG352015 RH2––––A7NEA NHATSG–(65690) 1991 DG––––A35NEAG–\n\nhttp://www.naic.edu/~eriverav/scripts/index.php\n\nThe “A” is for Arecibo; “G” is for Goldstone.\n\nThe SNRs were calculated using the current MPCORB absolute magnitude (H), a period of 4 hours (2 hours if D ≤ 200 m) if it’s not known, and the approximate minimum Earth distance during the current quarter. These are estimates only and assume that the radars are fully functional.\n\nIf the SNR value is in bold text, the object was found on the radar planning pages listed above. Otherwise, the planning tool at\n\nhttp://www.minorplanet.info/PHP/call_OppLCDBQuery.php\n\nwas used to find known NEAs that were V < 18.0 during the quarter. An object is usually placed on the list only if the estimated Arecibo SNR > 10 when using the SNR calculator mentioned above.\n\nIt’s rarely the case, especially when shape/spin axis modeling, that there are too much data. Remember that the best set for modeling includes data not just from multiple apparitions but from as wide a range of phase angles during each apparition as well.\n\n(437316) 2013 OS3 (H = 18.4)\n\nThere are no periods reported in the LCDB. The estimated diameter is about 600 meters, so the rotation period will likely be > 2 hours. The asteroid starts the year not far from the North Celestial Pole but quickly moves south and crosses the equator towards the end of January.\n\nDATERADecEDSDVαSEMEMPGB01/010817.0+67080.271.1817.437.1134116+0.30+3301/050753.9+64500.231.1616.935.413780+0.67+3101/090726.7+60530.191.1416.432.714143+0.96+2801/130657.3+54090.151.1115.829.014748−0.93+2301/170627.9+42500.121.0915.225.1152101−0.56+1401/210600.6+24590.101.0714.827.3150164−0.15+101/250536.6+01520.101.0615.141.2135133+0.00−1601/290516.3−19340.111.0415.857.811781+0.15−2902/020459.5−34490.131.0216.569.710356+0.50−3702/060445.3−44460.161.0117.276.89471+0.86−41\n\n2012 RK15 (H = 23.4)\n\nThe observing window for those with modest telescopes is just more than a week for this 60-m NEA.

(1997; IAUC 6607) reported this as a binary asteroid with a primary period of 2.624 h and orbital period of 32.69 h. Reanalysis of data from 2003 (Pravec et al., 2006; Icarus 181, 63–93) found three periods, indicating the possibility of a second satellite. This is a prime target for a coordinated campaign with observers well-spaced around the globe. Also required will be high-quality data with < 0.02 mag accuracy and precision.
