        "text": "\"How did painters and their public speak about art in Rembrandt’s age? This book about the writings of the painter-poet Samuel van Hoogstraten, one of Rembrandt’s pupils, examines a wide variety of themes from painting practice and theory from the Dutch Golden Age. It addresses the contested issue of ‘Dutch realism’ and its hidden symbolism, as well as Rembrandt’s concern with representing emotions in order to involve the spectator. Diverse aspects of imitation and illusion come to the fore, such as the theory behind sketchy or ‘rough’ brushwork and the active role played by the viewer’s imagination. Taking as its starting point discussions in Rembrandt’s studio, this unique study provides an overview of Dutch artists’ ideas on painting. The Visible World was awarded the Jan van Gelder Prize in 2009. Reviews: Jan Blanc in Simiolus 33/4 (2007-8), Amy Golahny in Sehepunkte 10 (2010), nr. 6., Bram de Klerck in NRC Handelsblad, 13 February 2009. \"\n\nhttp://t.co/FOwgjLTEzE A special interest in optics among various seventeenth-century painters living in the Dutch city of Delft, has intrigued (art-)historians for a long time. Equally, the impressive career of the Delft microscopist Anthony van Leeuwenhoek has been studied by many historians of science. However, it has never been investigated who, at that time, had access to the mathematical and optical knowledge necessary for the impressive achievements of these Delft practitioners. We have tried to gain insight in Delft as a ‘node’ of optical knowledge by following the careers of three minor local figures in early-seventeenth-century Delft. We argue that through their work, products, discussions in the vernacular and exchange of skills, rather than via learned publications, these practitioners constituted a foundation on which the later scientific and artistic achievements of other Delft citizens were built. Our Delft case demonstrates that these practitioners were not simple and isolated craftsmen; rather they were crucial components in a network of scholars, savants, painters and rich virtuosi. Decades before Vermeer made his masterworks, or Van Leeuwenhoek started his famous microscopic investigations the intellectual atmosphere and artisanal knowledge in this city centred on optical topics.\n\nThe Heart of Rembrandt comes forth from the Essay Analogia Part II, adding the results of further and more detailed research on the possible symbolism of geometry in the 17th century Dutch Painting. Especially the famous self-portrait of Rembrandt, with the two circles, could be in more than one aspect an artistic declaration of independence, stressing the emancipation of the artist. But this he had to be learned with the compass, as a young apprentice."
