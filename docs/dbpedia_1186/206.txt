People talk about romantic movies like it's just one genre, but there are actually so many different types of romances. Most attention is given to the great romantic comedies, which get people to laugh as much as they tug on people's hearts. But then there are also the romantic teen movies, which recall the intensity of a first love (and are now becoming franchises, when you think of Netflix series like The Kissing Booth, To All the Boys I've Loved Before and Tall Girl). There are romantic action movies, romantic Christmas movies, romantic noirs â€” basically you can find romance in any genre you can think of.

But when you want a straight-ahead, no-frills romance, these are the best romantic movies of all time. Sure, they may incorporate elements of comedy, action or drama, and some of them may even star teens. But the biggest criteria is that the relationship has to be the most front-and-center focus of the film. These are the films that give you all those yearning feelings, the ones that yank on the heartstrings with all their might. And while they may be fewer and far between these days, there are plenty of them around if you know where to look. Grab a sweetheart and get ready to swoon.
