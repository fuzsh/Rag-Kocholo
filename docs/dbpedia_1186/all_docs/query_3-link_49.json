        "text": "The film world has entered a new era, it seems — movies about brands.\n\nFour films that came out this year told the origin stories of basketball shoes, a discontinued mobile phone, a 1980s video game and a spicy, tasty snack.\n\nHere are some films based on true events on how a brand came to be, its founder or the near downfall of the corporation.\n\n'Air' (2023)\n\nStarring Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Viola Davis, \"Air\" tells the origin of Air Jordan, a basketball shoe line, for which a Nike employee (Damon) seeks to strike a business deal with rookie player Michael Jordan.\n\nJordan was not involved in the production, except to choose Davis for the role of his mother.\n\nWhere to watch: It is available to stream on Prime Video.\n\n'BlackBerry' (2023)\n\nThe film tells the story of two entrepreneurs, played by Jay Baruchel and Glenn Howerton, who join forces to create a worldwide hit — the BlackBerry.\n\nBut just as the mobile device was rising to new peaks, it started losing its way through the fog of smartphones, which eventually led to the fall of the handheld phone.\n\nWhere to watch: It is available to rent on Apple TV+ and Prime Video for $6.99.\n\n'Flamin' Hot' (2023)\n\nEver wonder how Flamin' Hot Cheetos came to be?\n\nDirected by Corpus Christi native Eva Longoria, the film tells the story of how Richard Montañez went from a Frito-Lay janitor to the inventor of the snack that became a phenomenon.\n\nThe film does not, however, acknowledge a 2021 investigation by the Los Angeles Times that showed Montañez did not invent the snack.\n\nWhere to watch: It is available to stream on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\n'The Founder' (2016)\n\nThe film depicts the story of how Ray Kroc, portrayed by Michael Keaton, made McDonald's a global corporation and forced out the company's original founders to take control.\n\nInspired by the original founders’ speedy system of making food, Kroc saw potential and maneuvered his way into a position to pull the rug out from under the McDonald brothers.\n\nWhere to watch: It is available to stream on Prime Video and Tubi.\n\n'House of Gucci' (2021)\n\nNot entirely a film based on the origin of a company, \"House of Gucci\" instead tells the story of how the romance between Patrizia Reggiani, played by Lady Gaga, and Maurizio Gucci, played by Adam Driver, transforms into a fight for control of the Italian fashion brand.\n\nWhile the movie had big names, and was directed by Ridley Scott, it was met with mixed reviews from critics but did receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Makeup and Hairstyling in 2022.\n\nWhere to watch: It is available to stream on Paramount+ and Prime Video.\n\n'Joy' (2015)\n\n\"Joy\" tells the story of inventor Joy Mangano, portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence, and her love for creating things. Specifically, the self-wringing Miracle Mop.\n\nThe film earned Lawrence an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, but was panned by critics for pace and writing.\n\nWhere to watch: It is available to stream on Prime Video.\n\n'Saving Mr. Banks' (2013)\n\nAnother film that doesn't show the origin of a brand, but rather the origin of a beloved Disney classic, \"Mary Poppins.\"\n\nThe movie takes the viewers behind the scenes of author P.L. Travers meeting Walt Disney, who wants to create a film based on her book. But in Disney's quest to obtain the rights, Travers makes matters hard as she is afraid her story will be turned to something she doesn't agree with.\n\nWhere to watch: It is available to stream on Disney+.\n\n'The Social Network' (2010)\n\nBased on the 2009 book \"The Accidental Billionaires\" by Ben Mezrich, the film portrays the founding of the social networking website Facebook.\n\nThe movie is told through flashbacks via deposition hearings where founder Mark Zuckerberg, played by Jesse Eisenberg, is being sued on claims he stole the idea of Facebook.\n\nWhere to watch: It is available to stream on Paramount+ and Prime Video.\n\n'Steve Jobs' (2015)\n\nThis was not the first biographical film about Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Inc.; rather, it was the third.\n\nThe film covers 14 years in the life of Jobs and his drive to revolutionize technology, which ultimately affected his family life.\n\nWhere to watch: It is available to stream on Starz.\n\n'Tetris' (2023)\n\nCategorized as a \"biographical thriller,\" the film is based on true events around the race to license and patent the video game Tetris from Russia in the late 1980s during the Cold War.\n\nAccording to the Tetris Company, the game has sold more than 520 million copies.\n\nWhere to watch: It is available to stream on Apple TV+.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nMore: Texas movies: Here are the most searched genres in Lone Star State, movie recommendations\n\nMore: From 'Selena' to 'La Bamba': Here are 10 music biopics to include on your watchlist\n\nJohn Oliva covers entertainment and community news in South Texas.
