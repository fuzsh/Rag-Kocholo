        "text": "I have been on a Kindle Unlimited kick and I’m not sorry about it one bit. I was in the depths of a month long reading slump and this book pulled me out of it. It was fun, sexy, swoony, and just what I needed. I love hockey and I love a good hockey romance. Sometimes I just want to read something satisfying and this fit the bill. I was so invested in the characters and loved their journey. It felt nostalgic and thrilling at the same time.\n\nWhen I think about this book, I know it won’t be for everyone. But for someone who loves to get lost in the characters and become so invested in them, this is the type of comfort read that is so worth it. I loved spending time with Stassie and Nate and their friends.\n\nSynopsis:\n\n“Anastasia Allen has worked her entire life for a shot at Team USA.\n\nA competitive figure skater since she was five years old, a full college scholarship thanks to her place on the Maple Hills skating team, and a schedule that would make even the most driven person weep, Stassie comes to win.\n\nNo exceptions.\n\nNathan Hawkins has never had a problem he couldn’t solve. As captain of the Maple Hills Titans, he knows the responsibility of keeping the hockey team on the ice rests on his shoulders.\n\nWhen a misunderstanding results in the two teams sharing a rink, and Anastasia’s partner gets hurt in the aftermath, Nate finds himself swapping his stick for tights, and one scary coach for an even scarier one.\n\nThe pair find themselves stuck together in more ways than one, but it’s fine, because Anastasia doesn’t even like hockey players…right?” —Amazon\n\nWhat I Liked:\n\nThe VIBES—I had been craving a reread of The Deal by Elle Kennedy and this provided those vibes and MORE. It’s fun, sexy, swoony, and all around just a great read if you love Romance.\n\nNo 3rd Act Break Up/Miscommunication Trope—I think it’s the romantic in me or just my curious nature, but while I LOVE the tension before the couple gets to together, I also love getting to see them together. This book is nearly 500 pages so you get the best of both worlds. The tension but also the satisfaction of their life together.\n\nThe Comfort—There’s something about a college romance that is so sentimental to me by how time passes. There’s a fun Halloween scene and an even better winter break/Christmas section. I had such a fun time reading it.\n\nWhat Didn’t Work:\n\nThe only criticism I could see while reading it is that some people may perceive the MMC as being unrealistically helpful when it came to the FMC’s disordered eating, but I think because she was already in therapy and willing to receive help, it felt realistic to me. Also, it’s a comforting, hopeful, sexy read so I think it’s okay to put a little trust in them.\n\nCharacter Authenticity: 5/5\n\nSpice Rating: 4/5\n\nOverall Rating: 4.75/5"
