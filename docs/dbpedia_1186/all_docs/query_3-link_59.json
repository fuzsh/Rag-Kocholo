        "text": "Monopoly\n\nFor almost two decades, filmmakers have been trying to turn the hugely popular Monopoly into a movie. In 2015, CNN reported that the Hasbro game had been translated into 47 languages, played in 114 countries sold over 275 million copies.\n\nA Monopoly movie was first mooted by Oscar-nominated director Ridley Scott during an interview with the Los Angeles Times in 2007. The director said he thought the game would produce \"a hysterically amusing and I think rather exciting film.\"\n\nIn 2009, producer Frank Beddor came up with an interesting pitch for a Monopoly movie, which he told IGN that Scott was excited about.\n\nBeddor described the idea as a \"comedic action-adventure\" about a \"lovable loser\" who has to battle \"the evil Parker Brothers\" in a game of real-life Monopoly.\n\nThe film never made it to the big screen and instead, another film was developed through a partnership between Lionsgate and Hasbro in 2015, with \"The Truman Show\" writer Andrew Niccol attached. The movie ended up not happening.\n\nIn 2019, Deadline reported that Kevin Hart would star in a Monopoly movie directed by \"The Blackening\" director Tim Story, though no plot details or filming dates have been revealed since then.\n\nWhen Lionsgate acquired Entertainment One's TV and film operations from Hasbro in 2023, it seemed a Monopoly movie was their top priority.\n\n\"We look forward to partnering with them, especially on a movie adaptation of Monopoly,\" Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said of the sale in a statement to Variety in August 2023.\n\nOn Wednesday, during 2024's Cinemacon in Las Vegas, Lionsgate confirmed that a Monopoly movie is in development.\n\nTransformers\n\nHasbro and Paramount have been partnering on the live-action \"Transformers\" series since 2007, with the latest adaptation, \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,\" hitting theaters this past summer.\n\nNumerous \"Transformers\" spinoffs and sequels are also in the works.\n\nIn 2020, Deadline reported that Paramount and Hasbro had partnered together to produce an animated prequel movie that takes place on Cybertron and explains the origins of fan-favorite characters Optimus Prime and Megatron.\n\n\"Toy Story 4\" director Josh Cooley was hired to direct the film written by Andrew Barrer and Gabriel Ferrari.\n\nThe movie is set to premiere on September 13, 2024, and stars Chris Hemsworth (as Optimus), Brian Tyree Henry (as Megatron), Jon Hamm (as Sentinel Prime), Keegan-Michael Key (as Bumblebee), Laurence Fishburne (as Alpha Trion), and Scarlet Johansson (as Elita).\n\nIn 2022, Paramount announced that \"Rise of the Beasts\" will be the first of a new trilogy, which means that at least two more live-action \"Transformers\" movies are in development.\n\nAt the end of the 2023 movie \"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,\" a crossover between the \"Transformers\" and \"G.I. Joe\" franchises was also teased.\n\nProducer Lorenzo di Bonaventura told Radio Times in June 2023 that instead of having a separate crossover film, \"some G.I. Joe characters\" will appear in \"Transformers 8,\" along with the Autobots and the Maximals.\n\nIn 2021, multipe outlets reported that Angel Manuel Soto (\"Blue Beetle\") has signed on to direct a standalone \"Transformers\" movie, with Marco Ramirez (\"The Defenders\") writing the script. No further details have emerged since."
