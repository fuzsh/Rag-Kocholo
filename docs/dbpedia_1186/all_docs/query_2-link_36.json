        "text": "Last week I used Booking.com to book return business class flights from the UK to Kathmandu in October. I was going out with Qatar Airways and back with Vistara, at a total cost of £3,679.\n\nOnce the payment had gone through, the website told me I would receive an email with the booking reference and details within a few hours. However, no booking reference arrived.\n\nI tried to contact Booking.com to resolve it.

I can’t rebook because the money is still pending in my Amex account. I can’t get through to talk to anyone to try to resolve the matter. Please help.\n\nGL, by email\n\nThis email highlights why I am always reluctant to book flights with online travel agents. Too many readers in your shoes have booked a second lot of flights, assuming the first booking has failed, only to later receive a confirmation for the first set. This happened to a colleague and it was a nightmare to unwind, so you did the right thing in waiting. Your experience also shows how frustrating it can be to contact these agents, which increasingly use automated systems.\n\nA couple of days after you sent this email, Booking.com finally replied, saying that your booking had in fact failed. The next cheapest alternative with it cost an extra £1,500, so you rebooked with Expedia and paid an extra £1,000 over the original price.\n\nBooking.com has now confirmed no money was taken, apologised for the inconvenience, and offered a goodwill payment equal to 10% of the original booking – in your case £368. Not a great experience, but at least you aren’t quite so much out of pocket. Lots of people use these websites to find the cheapest deals, and then book by going direct. Just saying …"
