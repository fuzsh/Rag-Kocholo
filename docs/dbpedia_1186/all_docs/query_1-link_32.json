        "text": "There is a moment that has happened millions of times for eons, and yet has rarely been captured on film: a 12-year-old girl wondering what to do when she gets her period.\n\nJudy Blume described it in print, in her seminal 1970 novel, “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret.” More than a half-century later, the movie adaptation, due April 28, is putting that awkward puzzling-through onscreen, as young Margaret practices inserting a pad in her underwear. It’s a scene that is so quietly revolutionary, it made the movie’s editor cry when she first saw the footage.\n\nThere was just this sense, said the movie’s writer-director, Kelly Fremon Craig: “Oh my gosh, we have never been allowed to show this.”\n\nFilming it “felt like some sort of release of the shame and embarrassment around it.”\n\nMenstruation, burgeoning sexuality and fraught gender dynamics, religion, the barefoot-in-the-sprinkler joys and gossip-twisted tribulations of girlhood: “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret” tracks it all, and has been both banned and beloved for it.\n\nIn the popular imagination, the book is mostly concerned with the changing body and the rites of puberty, and that’s what made it controversial. But Margaret’s exploration of religion — her Jewish father and Christian mother encourage her to decide for herself — also drew the ire of the religious right. The God Margaret confides in is nondenominational; as a preteen, she has agency and choice.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
