        "text": "Date Set:1851\n\nPeriod Drama Collectors everywhere this is a MUST HAVE in your DVD or Bluray collection. This BBC production was not advertised very well in my country. It was just by chance I happened to be channel surfing and voila. One of the best Victorian drama's from the BBC, that I've ever seen in a long time . Daniela Denby-Ashe is excellent as the headstrong but privillage Margaret Hale. Richard Armitage is John Thornton! A tale of two people, who misread everything about each other, John Thornton misread her feelings for him and she misunderstand what he really stands for. Fantastic supporting cast and absolute top notch acting; this production is a winner.***SPOILER*** the ending is one of the most romantic scenes that I have seen. They both meet on a train stop over station, both are going in opposite directions; but they finally get together.\n\nI rarely give a 10/10 but this is a well deserved 15/10\n\nAlso see\n\nNorth & South (1975) starring Patrick Stewart\n\nDate set:1850\n\n-there are different time periods of Jane Eyre, in numerous Jane Eyre productions. My rule of thumb is get the date which Briggs states the marriage date of Rochester and Bertha (in the chapel) and add 15 years onto it:-. He was 21 when he married Bertha (Ch XIV). 5 years Rochester 'lived in torment' & 10 years travelling the world(ChXXVII) until he fell off his horse and met Jane.\n\nI'm kinda of addicted to Jane Eyre films. Ive seen to date including this production:\n\n**Jane Eyre (1943)-Orson Welles /Joan Fontaine-The gothic mood of the B&W film is superb. Did not like the second act; there was no Diane or Mary Rivers and Sinjin...don't even go there.\n\n**Jane Eyre (1973)-Michael Jayston/Sorcha Cusack. The characterization and the script is first class and the only production, I've seen where Rochester sing (chp XVII) a Corsair Song plus more time is spent on Jane's childhood. Someone in art production & design obviously read the novel. Notice the cabinet with the ebony cross & the panels...straight out of chp XX.\n\n**Jane Eyre (1983)Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke. This movie sticks more closer to the novel but scenes are obviously changed. Although Timothy Dalton is too handsome to play Rochester; though his delivery of the lines are first class but a bit over-dramatic.\n\n**Jane Eyre (1996)-William Hurt/Charlotte Gainsbourg. Gainsbourg looks like the description in the novel, though she is too tall of play Jane. Big plus is the fantastic music & Anna Paquin as young Jane (one of the best embodiment of young Jane in a film production to date).\n\n**Jane Eyre (1997)-Ciar√°n Hinds/Samantha Morton. An interesting adaptation, I enjoyed it but not to everybody's taste. Hinds does sing a duet with Blanche\n\n**Jane Eyre (2006)-Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson. This production does have scenes in it that the others do not. Notably the Millcote shopping scene with Rochester, Jane AND Adele; where Jane meets Rochester before the wedding on the hillside ; the dream sequence and Adele in the final scene\n\n**Jane Eyre (2011)-Michael Fassbender /Mia Wasikowska. Loved the look of the film. What I felt ruined it was the over editing and shortening of key scenes. This alone marred the pacing of the film. If you look on youtube you'll see the deleted scenes, which I felt should of made the final cut."
