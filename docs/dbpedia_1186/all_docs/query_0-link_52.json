        "text": "Listen to this article\n\nMovies are part of contemporary culture. A marvel of technology, movies can emulate reality or create an entirely fictional universe to advance the age-old past time of storytelling. There are movies for children, lovers, action entertainment, and there are movies for married couples to help them cope with family life.\n\nWe have compiled a list of must-see movies that every married couple should watch to strengthen their bond as a family and as lovers. Like traditional storytelling, if the morals can be taken to heart, it can build character and even save marriages.\n\n1.

The Break-Up\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Film Affinity.com\n\nRating: 5.8/10 Stars\n\nDirector: Peyton Reed\n\nCast: Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston, Joey Lauren Adams, Cole Hauser, Jon Favreau, and more\n\nRelease year: 2006\n\nThe Break-up may have the lowest rating on this list. But, if you’re looking for movies about rekindled love and how messy an actual divorce is, then this movie is the one that leaves the best impression.\n\nComedians Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston do a great job in turning a serious subject of divorce and make it an entertaining topic with a great moral lesson. “The Break-up” is a must-watch marriage movie even if your relationship is not on the rocks.\n\nWatch the trailer below:\n\nWatch now\n\n15.

Zooey Deschanel, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and together with director Marc Webb show how messy relationships are, regardless of the effort one or both parties put into it.\n\nWhile many lessons can be taken from 500 Days of Summer, such as incompatibility, fate, and true love, it can also be interpreted in so many ways, which adds to the movie’s novelty.\n\nWatch the trailer below:\n\nWatch now\n\n17. A Time Traveler’s Wife\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Roger Ebert.com\n\nRating: 7.1/10 Stars\n\nDirector: Robert Schwentke\n\nCast: Rachel McAdams, Eric Bana, Arliss Howard, Ron Livingston, Stephen Tobolowsky, and more\n\nRelease year: 2009\n\nA Time Traveler’s Wife is a marriage movie that deals with a lot of issues of marriage. Adding “time traveling” as a twist turns into an entertaining rollercoaster.\n\nWhile time-traveling romance is not exactly new especially with Somewhere in Time (1980) and The Lake House (2006) being better movies in the time travel + romance genre (but not appropriate for couples trying to mend their relationship), Director Robert Schwentke together with leads Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams shows how marriage is about family and children.\n\nWatch the trailer below:\n\nWatch now\n\n18. Forrest Gump\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Amazon\n\nRating: 8.8/10 Stars\n\nDirector: Robert Zemeckis\n\nCast: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Sally Field, Gary Sinise, and more\n\nRelease year: 1994\n\nOscar-winning film Forrest Gump is not technically a marriage movie, but legendary actor Tom Hanks playing the lead title role does a great job in showing the world the meaning of love and family.\n\nForrest Gump’s illustrious life weaves a heartwarming story of love and innocence.\n\nIt’s on this list because while there are more than a few movies here that show how love and marriage is a complicated mess, Forrest Gump takes a different approach and shows that it is actually so simple that even an idiot knows it.\n\nWatch the trailer below:\n\nWatch now\n\n19. Up\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Amazon\n\nRating: 8.2/10 Stars\n\nDirector: Pete Docter\n\nCast: Ed Asner, Christopher Plummer, Jordan Nagai, Pete Docter, and more\n\nRelease year: 2009\n\nDisney Pixar is not exactly known for marriage movies. Up, however, is an exception to the rule. In the first minutes of the film, it shows that marriage is based on a simple premise of keeping promises.\n\nWatch the trailer below:\n\nWatch now\n\n20. The Vow\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Amazon\n\nRating: 6.8/10 Stars\n\nDirector: Michael Sucsy\n\nCast: Rachel McAdams, Channing Tatum, Jessica Lange, Sam Neill, Wendy Crewson, and more\n\nRelease year: 2012\n\nSpeaking of keeping promises, the marriage movie “The Vow” goes for the direct approach of mixing 50 First Dates, plus Up, plus Time Traveler’s Wife.\n\nThe Vow is a simple case of loving your partners, till death tears your relationship apart because you committed yourself to it.\n\nWatch the trailer below:\n\nWatch now\n\nThe Final Scene\n\nBefore I decide to add another Rachel McAdams movie on the list, I’d like to say that there are many more marriage movies that deal with the many intricacies of love, relationships, and divorce.\n\nExamples are Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) about a messy child custody lawsuit based on a true story, and there are also other kinds such as the Fifty Shades trilogy.\n\nBut movies to save marriages are hard to find. While most marriage movies have an underlying moral lesson, most are hidden under comedy or hot sex scenes to hit home.\n\nWatching the list above is not a silver bullet that would help any couple save their marriage, but if they do take the time to watch at least half of them and talk about what they learned from it, then maybe, it will reopen communication and help you both reconnect- Just like when they were young, stupid, and dating!"
