        "text": "Bill Paxton (born May 17, 1955, Fort Worth, Texas, U.S.—died February 25, 2017, Los Angeles, California) was an American actor who was an exceptionally versatile artist; he played a wide variety of roles in films and on television, conveying in each part an essential and believable humanity.\n\nPaxton moved to Los Angeles when he was 18 years old and entered the film industry as a set dresser for the studio New World Pictures. His entrée into acting was an uncredited part in Jonathan Demme’s 1950s romp Crazy Mama (1975). He then moved to New York City and studied acting under Stella Adler. After a period of working mostly in B movies (punctuated by small parts in the major studio films Stripes [1981] and The Lords of Discipline [1983]), Paxton was cast by James Cameron in his sci-fi films The Terminator (1984) and Aliens (1986). Paxton’s portrayal of an unnerved redneck marine in the latter won him favourable notice. He was also memorable as an obnoxious older brother in John Hughes’s Weird Science (1985) and as a vampire in Kathryn Bigelow’s Near Dark (1987).\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nIn 1993 Paxton had his first leading role, in One False Move. He worked again with Cameron on the comedy thriller True Lies (1994) and on the blockbuster Titanic (1997), in which Paxton played a treasure hunter in a framing device for the main story. During this time he also starred with Tom Hanks and Kevin Bacon in Apollo 13 (1995), Ron Howard’s acclaimed drama about the nearly disastrous 1970 spaceflight, and appeared with Helen Hunt as a storm chaser in the hit movie Twister (1996)."
