Also, George and Angie find out that accident-prone factory worker Amy Kirkland (\"George Lopez\" executive producer SANDRA BULLOCK [\"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,\" \"Speed\"] in a recurring guest-starring role) is a parent as well. Meanwhile, Carmen gives her grandmother, Benny, a fashion makeover when Benny becomes enamored with a fellow employee."
