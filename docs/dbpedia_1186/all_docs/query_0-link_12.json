        "text": "Topline\n\nThe buzzy new Anne Hathaway romantic comedy, “The Idea of You,” premiered on Amazon Prime on Thursday, and fans have noticed plenty of similarities between the male lead and pop singer Harry Styles—though the author of the novel the movie is based on and the film’s stars have recently distanced themselves from the Styles comparisons.\n\nKey Facts\n\nCrucial Quote\n\n“Is there some Harry [Styles] in there? Yes. But there’s like 23 other people in there,” Lee told TODAY.com “The Prince Harry references don’t get picked up on, and I mentioned him in the book directly,” adding other inspirations for her novel included Eddie Redmayne, Michael Hawkins, Duran Duran, John Taylor and Simon Le Bon.\n\nTangent\n\nSeveral reviews of “The Idea of You”—which has been positively received by critics, with an 82% score on Rotten Tomatoes—have noted the Styles similarities. The Daily Beast critic Fletcher Peters wrote that “Styles gets his own ‘Fifty Shades of Grey’ in ‘The Idea of You,’” adding that Galitizine plays a “perfect Harry Styles-type figure, oozing charisma with a faint whisper of something mysterious lurking beneath those shiny green eyes.” New York Times critic Alissa Wilkinson wrote the premise of the film is the question: “What if Harry Styles, the British megastar and former frontman of One Direction, fell madly in love with a hot 40-year-old mom?”\n\nKey Background\n\nLee told The Guardian she was inspired to write “The Idea of You” after watching a boy band’s music videos and coming up with the idea of a love interest running off with the lead singer—though she declined to name which boy band it was. She characterized the book in a Vogue interview as “a story about a woman approaching 40 and reclaiming her sexuality and rediscovering herself,” rather than strictly a romance. She published her novel in 2017, and Vogue reported the book became a sleeper hit during the pandemic, though sales had steadily increased every year until that point.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nStyles was the inspiration for the “After” novel series, written by Anna Todd. Todd began writing her novels on the online fiction writing website Wattpad in 2013, but she has since published five books in the series, and five films based on her novels have been produced.\n\nFurther Reading\n\n'The Idea of You' is giving some One Direction fans the opportunity to relive the band's glory days (NBC News)\n\n‘The Idea of You’ Creator Calls Harry Styles Comparisons ‘Reductive’ (The Daily Beast)"
