The film was a popular and critical hit, winning six Academy Awards.\n\nMontgomery Clift played George Eastman, an oppressed young man from the wrong side of town. Despite having wealthy relatives, Eastman can find no entry into the opulent lifestyle that he craves—until he falls in love with a beautiful young socialite (Elizabeth Taylor), whom he wishes to marry. His plans go awry when his ex-girlfriend Alice (Shelley Winters) announces that she is pregnant and demands that she and Eastman be wed. He desperately attempts to put off the unwanted marriage, and he takes Alice on a boat ride during which he plans to kill her. Although he changes his mind, Alice drowns when the boat accidentally capsizes. Eastman is found guilty of her murder and is sentenced to death.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nMatch the Quote to the Movie Quiz"
