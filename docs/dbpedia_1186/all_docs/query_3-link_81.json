        "text": "Directing\n\nFilm Theory\n\nThe 49 Best Short Films of All Time That Every Filmmaker Can Learn From\n\nThe best short films have a few key things in common: concise storytelling, great performances, an original concept, and stunning visuals. You can learn from each, but which are the best to watch?\n\nRight now, we’ll give you our list of the best short films of all time. We’ll also break down these short movies to show you how to make your next project one of the best short films of all time. Commence learning.\n\n1\n\nBest Drama Short Films\n\nRUN TIME UNDER 45 MINUTES\n\nBEST DRAMA SHORTS\n\nShort films have the best narratives\n\nThe best short films are just like any great film - it all start on the page. If you're planning to create your own short film, you will want a professional script.\n\nNeed FREE screenwriting software to write your short film?\n\nOur professional screenwriting software helps you format along the way, and you can access your screenplay from any computer, anywhere in the world.\n\nCheck out the sample script below:\n\nTake a look below for some of the most exceptional movies.\n\n01\n\nBest Drama Shorts\n\nThe top narrative short movies\n\n1.1 BEST DRAMA SHORT FILM\n\nThe Red Balloon\n\nAlbert Lamorisse directs this short film about the experiences of a young boy and his balloon in Paris.\n\nThe Red Balloon\n\nIt’s one of the greatest survival and friendship stories ever told. The imagery lends itself to suspense, and it makes me think of Cast Away.\n\n1.2 BEST DRAMA SHORT FILM\n\nThe Phone Call\n\nMat Kirkby directs this short film about a volunteer at a crisis center who receives a phone call from a man slowly poisoning himself to death.\n\nThe Phone Call\n\nThe film has a great ticking clock that somehow seems both urgent while also relaxed enough for character development.\n\n1.3 BEST DRAMA SHORT FILM\n\nSession Man\n\nSeth Winston directs this Oscar winning short film about a session guitarist hired to help a famous rock band finish up their latest album.\n\nSession man\n\nThis is a perfect example of a miniaturized story that works great as a short film that may not have worked as a feature.\n\n1.4 BEST DRAMA SHORT FILM\n\nHotel Chevalier\n\nWes Anderson directs this short film about two past lovers who reunite in a hotel room in Paris, and is a prologue to The Darjeeling Limited.\n\nHotel Chevalier\n\nThe film works so well because the logline is also the synopsis. The film is about past lovers, and how we view them.\n\n1.5 BEST DRAMA SHORT FILM\n\nSmall Deaths\n\nThis is a great film by director Lynne Ramsay that works really well as a short because it shows us three moments in a girls life where she learns something about the world. Often this can be less than pleasant.\n\nSmall Deaths\n\nThere is something very focused and yet hands off about this film. Anytime you can say that, I think you’ve got a winner.\n\n1.6 BEST DRAMA SHORT FILM\n\nGlory At Sea\n\nDirector Ben Zeitlin used this clever idea to catapult his name into the ranks of serious directors, and went on to helm Beasts of the Southern Wild which earned him Academy Award nominations for directing, writing, and best picture.\n\nGlory At Sea\n\nThis film is great and it plays with reality and death in such a unique way it’s no wonder this is one of the best ever.\n\n1.7 BEST DRAMA SHORT FILM\n\nEight\n\nThe full display of Stephen Daldry’s directing ability is evident in this short film that launched his career. The promise of his future work such as Billy Elliot, The Hours, and The Reader, is definitely evident in Eight.\n\nEight\n\nThe writing is concise and focused. Those with an especially good eye can notice some of the director’s style in his later offerings. Incredibly Loud and Extremely Close to his first film. From stunning tracking shots to close-ups, Daldry seems to say I know film theory and can put it to use.\n\n1.8 BEST DRAMA SHORT FILM\n\nLick The Star\n\nDirector Sofia Coppola uses this short film to talk about celebrity, teen angst, and suicide. The whole thing is done with such an objective point of view, and the realistic tone mixed with the dramatic imagery works well.\n\nLick the Star\n\nThe film also features Peter Bogdanovich and Zoe Cassavetes.\n\n1.9 BEST DRAMA SHORT FILM\n\nCarne\n\nIf you have yet to see a Gaspar Noe film, this may be the perfect bite size snack for you. He makes films that are not easy to watch, but they’re good enough to make you wonder why that is, and to challenge yourself.\n\nCarne\n\nThe films aren’t ugly, but they aren’t easy to digest.\n\n1.10 BEST DRAMA SHORT FILM\n\nCrossroads\n\nThis short film is a recent arrival to the festival circuit, having screened at least thirty festivals such as the Academy Awards qualifying Hollyshorts, and was screened by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation.\n\nCrossroads\n\nWriter/director Marvin Nuecklaus creates stunning photography, with a keen use of visual color palette for time delineation.\n\n2\n\nBest Comedy Short Films\n\nRUN TIME UNDER 45 MINUTES\n\n02\n\nBest Comedy Short Films\n\nThe top narrative short movies\n\nA Dog’s Life\n\nSix Shooter\n\nThe Music Box\n\nBottle Rocket\n\nIt’s Always Sunny On TV\n\nFrankenweenie\n\nThunder Road\n\nGreener Grass\n\n2.1 BEST COMEDY SHORT FILM\n\nA Dog’s Life\n\nCharlie Chaplin was one of the first directors to realize what a gold mine Dogs and Children would be on film, or maybe he is to blame. The film shows how an out of work man, harassed woman, and stray dog all have their vulnerabilities and reasons for living.\n\nA Dog’s Life\n\nNothing Chaplin ever did was completely comedy, and while there are plenty of laughs in this film, the message still works today, and forever.\n\n2.2 BEST COMEDY SHORT FILM\n\nSix Shooter\n\nMartin McDonagh was already a celebrated playwright at the time that he made this short film, but he then went on to write and direct In Bruges, Seven Psychopaths, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\n\nSix Shooter\n\nThe film has a great cast, and is simple enough to work as a short film.\n\n2.3 BEST COMEDY SHORT FILM\n\nThe Music Box\n\nJames Parrot directs this short film that takes cues from the greek story of Sisyphus, who was cursed for eternity to push a rock up a hill that would never make it to the top.\n\nThe Music Box\n\nThey swap the rock for a piano, and the tragedy for some serious laughs.\n\n2.4 BEST COMEDY SHORT FILM\n\nBottle Rocket\n\nDirector Wes Anderson took this film to Sundance where it got very little attention, but those who saw it loved it. This short film about boredom, crime, adolescence, and masculinity launched the careers of the Wilson Brothers, and of course Anderson himself.\n\nBottle Rocket\n\nMuch like THX, this is a must watch for that reason alone.\n\n2.5 BEST COMEDY SHORT FILM\n\nIt’s Always Sunny On TV\n\nA small story about a bunch of vain actors. This short film paved the way for It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia to become one of the greatest comedy shows of all time, and it started with a conversation about cancer.\n\nIt’s Always Sunny On TV\n\nThe performances and writing made this idea work.\n\n2.6 BEST COMEDY SHORT FILM\n\nFrankenweenie\n\nThis short film, directed by Tim Burton and funded then scrapped by Disney, this darkly humorous film about a dog brought back to life.\n\nFrankenweenie\n\nThe film shows where Burton was headed, and gained him even more attention as a filmmakers beyond just a visual artist.\n\n2.7 BEST COMEDY SHORT FILM\n\nThunder Road\n\nJim Cummings writes and directs the Sundance Film Festival award-winning Thunder Road. The film was adapted into a long-form feature film and was a giant hit in France.\n\nThunder Road\n\nDirector Jim Cummings turned a substantial profit from this short film and gave the world a very signature calling card.\n\n2.8 BEST COMEDY SHORT FILM\n\nGreener Grass\n\nThis short film directed by Paul Briganti makes fun of materialism and social competition in a way that doesn't hold back. It has irony, a smart theme, a bite size premise, and is filmed pretty well.\n\nGreener Grass\n\nThe film was accepted by the SXSW film festival.\n\n3\n\nBest Horror Short Films\n\nRUN TIME UNDER 45 MINUTES\n\n03\n\nBest Horror Short Films\n\nThe top narrative short movies\n\nThe Big Shave\n\nThe Smiling Man\n\nThe Birch\n\nLights Out\n\nCutting Moments\n\nAlexia\n\n3.1 BEST HORROR SHORT FILM\n\nThe Big Shave\n\nMartin Scorsese may be synonymous with mob films and Leo DiCaprio, but before all the glitz and glamour he made a film about a guy shaving.\n\nWhat could be so terrifying about a guy shaving? Haven’t you already answered that question with your own question?\n\nThe Big Shave\n\nIf you do watch this short film, you should consider what may have been going on circa 1970 (*coughs* - “Vietnam!”).\n\n3.2 BEST HORROR SHORT FILM\n\nThe Smiling Man\n\nThis short film from director A.J. Briones grabs the terror bull by the horns, and places a little girl all alone in a face to face with pure evil.\n\nThe Smiling Man\n\nAgain, this is a short film and the filmmakers understand that simplicity is often your best friend. Show off your skills.\n\n3.3 BEST HORROR SHORT FILM\n\nThe Birch\n\nThis short film directed by Ben Franklin and Anthony Melton deals with the topic of bullying, and a young man who summons an ancient spirit in an effort to seek revenge.\n\nThe Birch\n\nI actually quite like Birch trees.\n\n3.4 BEST HORROR SHORT FILM\n\nLights Out\n\nDavid F. Sandberg made this film and it is another one that takes some of the great horror tropes of all time, and relies on nothing else. It is sort of like eating a buttermilk donut, sometimes that plan taste is the best to have.\n\nLights Out\n\nThis short went on to become a feature length film.\n\n3.5 BEST HORROR SHORT FILM\n\nCutting Moments\n\nThis short film is truly disturbing, and instead of relying on some distant or supernatural evil, this film shows our own need to please and to be loved as the ultimate horror.\n\nCutting Moments\n\nI don’t want to give any huge details away, but if you love horror but are tired of jump scares and raspy trailer voice, check out this short film.\n\n3.6 BEST HORROR SHORT FILM\n\nAlexia\n\nThis short film directed by Andrés Borghi shows a woman with the desire to keep the memories of her loved ones alive and the unintended consequences that follow.\n\nAlexia\n\nHorror films are as much about filmmaking as they are about dread. Check this film out to see both.\n\n4\n\nBest Sci-Fi Short Films\n\nRUN TIME UNDER 45 MINUTES\n\n04\n\nBest SCI-fi short films\n\nThe top sci-fi shortS\n\n4.1 BEST SCI-FI SHORT FILM\n\nAlive In Joburg\n\nNeill Blomkamp proved his abilities to none other than legendary director Peter Jackson with this short film that inspired the hit film District 9.\n\nAlive In Joburg\n\nPeter Jackson said Blomkamp “needed to be making films”, and hired him to his visual effects studio in New Zealand.\n\n4.2 BEST SCI-FI SHORT FILM\n\nElectronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB\n\nThis film by George Lucas paved the way for some of the greatest films of all time like Star Wars and Indiana Jones.\n\nElectronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB\n\nThey also made a feature length version with Robert Duvall, and while the pacing is a little slow there is a ton of insights for any filmmaker.\n\n4.3 BEST SCI-FI SHORT FILM\n\nI’m Here\n\nThis fantastic short film by Spike Jonze also happens to be a bit of a corporate advert for Absolut Vodka, but the quality, thoughtfulness, and execution of the film sort of erases any ill will that may generate.\n\nI’m Here\n\nThis short film, based on the book The Giving Tree, is a film about sacrifice, love, and existentialism all rolled into a nice looking package with Andrew Garfield playing the lead.\n\n4.4 BEST SCI-FI SHORT FILM\n\nTrip To The Moon\n\nThe influence of this film from director and actor George Melies cannot be overstated. Out of the hundreds of film this Godfather of cinema completed, this is the one that has stood the test of time.\n\nThe story follows a group of astronomers who voyage to the moon. They explore the surface, come to blows with the natives, before returning to earth with a captive.\n\nTrip To The Moon\n\nThis short film has cutting-edge special effects… for the time. In 1902, seeing Trip to the Moon must have been like seeing Titanic for the first time. The writing is great even without a word of audible dialogue.\n\nThe enduring theme of the exploration of man was cleverly realized in this short film. The film was heavily pirated in its’ day even though it was financially very successful.\n\n4.5 BEST SCI-FI SHORT FILM\n\nThe Nostalgist\n\nThis film by Giacomo Cimini takes place both in a virtual world and the real world, and uses a father and son relationship to illustrate an already tenuous relationship with society and the outside world.\n\nThe Nostalgist\n\nIf you’ve ever felt like you were born outside of your intended time era, give this film a watch.\n\n4.6 BEST SCI-FI SHORT FILM\n\nKung Fury\n\nThis film directed by David Sandberg can be found on Netflix, and I highly recommend it for several different reasons. It’s funny, has some corny but great special effects, and seems completely uncompromised.\n\nKung Fury\n\nThis film was crowdfunded, and received something close to $300,000 from kickstarter during its heyday.\n\nThis short film is a testament to the power of filmmaking.\n\n5\n\nBest Animated Short Films\n\nRUN TIME UNDER 45 MINUTES\n\n05\n\nBest ANIMATED SHORT FILMS\n\nThe top documentary shortS\n\n5.1 BEST ANIMATED SHORT FILM\n\nWhat’s Opera, Doc?\n\nThis short film by Chuck Jones is his best. I’ve never turned this short film off, or looked away. That is the true sign of any great piece of entertainment, and on top of that this short film makes me laugh, cry (in the right mood), think, and sing.\n\nWhat’s Opera, Doc?\n\nWhat a fantastic short film.\n\n5.2 BEST ANIMATED SHORT FILM\n\nGeri’s Game\n\nThe concept: An old man plays chess with himself in the park. Simple enough. How did Pixar tell this story? By having the man assume the multiple characters in the chess match.\n\nGeri’s Game\n\nThe combination of concept, storytelling and, yes performance, even if it is computer generated imagery, works to make this academy award-winning short film one of the best.\n\n5.3 BEST ANIMATED SHORT FILM\n\nImaginary Flying Machines\n\nThis film was produced by Studio Ghibli and features the legendary Hayao Miyazaki as a talking pig who narrates the film all about the human power of flight, and a bunch of different machines used to achieve it. This short film isn't available online so here's a video essay on Miyazaki's Airships instead. Enjoy!\n\nFlight in Miyazaki Films\n\nGreat animation, great story, great short film.\n\n5.4 BEST ANIMATED SHORT FILM\n\nWorld Of Tomorrow\n\nThe World of Tomorrow is an Academy Award winning film that takes is anything but conventional. Animation give a lot of latitude, and director Don Hertzfeldt understands that very well.\n\nWorld Of Tomorrow\n\n5.5 BEST ANIMATED SHORT FILM\n\nThe Man Who Planted Trees\n\nThis short film directed by Frédéric Back and based off the book by Jean Giono. Christopher Plummer narrates and plays the hero who recalls his experience of being saved by a shepherd who plants trees in a barren valley eventually creating a place similar to the Garden of Eden.\n\nThe Man Who Planted Trees\n\nThis film is not only about man and nature, but about the healing powers we both can provide. It’s a two way street.\n\n5.6 BEST ANIMATED SHORT FILM\n\nHuman Behavior\n\nThis is the only music video you will find on this list and it definitely deserves to be on any list of groundbreaking short films. This short film is “ever so satisfying”\n\nHuman Behavior\n\nWhen pop-rock superstar Bjork enlisted Michel Gondry to make a video the chances were high that they would make something unique.\n\n5.7 BEST ANIMATED SHORT FILM\n\nSanjay’s Super Team\n\nEvery filmmaker should see this Pixar short film for the amazing combination of original concept, strong storytelling, and stunning visuals.\n\nSanjay’s Super Team\n\nDirector Sanjay Patel based the story on his own childhood. Taking the familiar story of a clash of interest between two generations, Patel used the Hindu deities and the superhero storyline to create a magical short movie. It is truly a delight for all ages.\n\n6\n\nBest Experimental Short Films\n\nRUN TIME UNDER 45 MINUTES\n\n06\n\nBest experimental SHORT FILMS\n\nThe top documentary shortS\n\n6.1 BEST EXPERIMENTAL SHORT FILMS\n\nUn Chien Andalou\n\nSpanish director Luis Buñuel and artist Salvador Dalí wrote a script based on the concept of suppressed human emotions. Then they went and filmed it, without any apparent compromise.\n\nUn Chien Andalou\n\nTo watch any of these experimental films is to understand that you are no longer in the realm of conventional cinema, but that doesn’t mean cinematic language and thematic expression are abnormal, in this film or any other film for that matter.\n\n6.2 BEST EXPERIMENTAL SHORT FILMS\n\nLa Jetee\n\nA post-apocalyptic, cautionary tale and a masterpiece of writing, this short film is one of the best of all times. Twenty-eight minutes long and entirely in black and white, La Jetee is ahead of its’ time.\n\nLa Jetee\n\nThe themes are as relevant today as they were sixty years ago. Importantly, it pays homage to the French New Wave movement.\n\n6.3 BEST EXPERIMENTAL SHORT FILMS\n\nAn Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge\n\nThe short film seventy years later was specially presented on an episode of The Twilight Zone. Adapted for the screen and directed by Roberto Enrico, the story is simple, but the telling is what makes it jarring and original.\n\nAn Occurrence At Owl Creek Bridge\n\nIt was a winner at the Cannes Film Festival. In addition, An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge received both the BAFTA and the Academy Award for the best Live Action Short film.\n\n6.4 BEST EXPERIMENTAL SHORT FILMS\n\nScorpio Rising\n\nThis film from Kenneth Anger caused the Nazis to become upset at him for misrepresenting their flag. A censorship advocacy group called the police, had the theatre manager arrested and the print seized before the whole case went to the California supreme court.\n\nScorpio Rising\n\nThis film set precedent for legal censorship cases across the country, and in some ways dismantled the shard censorship laws that remained from the McCarthy era. Oh, and the film is pretty great too.\n\n6.5 BEST EXPERIMENTAL SHORT FILMS\n\nFrom The Drain\n\nThis film from David Cronenberg shows two men in a mental institution bathtub talking about what is in the drain. It led to films like Eastern Promises, History of Violence, and Existenz, so it is totally worth watching.\n\nFrom The Drain\n\nAlso, it is interesting to watch a lot of the interviews Cronenberg gave during the period of creating this film, so if you have time watch those too.\n\n6.6 BEST EXPERIMENTAL SHORT FILMS\n\nThe Grandmother\n\nDavid Lynch has made a few experimental short films, but The Grandmother is his best. The reason it is his best is because it has more cinematic technique to analyze than other short films from David Lynch.\n\nThe Grandmother\n\nOften his films are shot in such a simple manner that you ponder the art and meaning rather than the cinematic techniques.\n\n7\n\nBest Documentary Short Films\n\nRUN TIME UNDER 45 MINUTES\n\n07\n\nBest documentary SHORT FILMS\n\nThe top documentary shortS\n\n7.1 BEST DOCUMENTARY SHORT FILMS\n\nNight And Fog\n\nWriter-director Alain Resnais used writing and structure as well as a compilation of archival footage from all over Europe to bring this short film to life.\n\nUsing motion pictures and stills, there is no fancy Hollywood razzle-dazzle in this no-nonsense look at the horrors of the Holocaust.\n\nNight and Fog\n\nWhat makes this film truly extraordinary is not the subject matter.\n\nThis was not the first film to detail the atrocities of the Second World War.\n\nIt is the structure of the film that makes this short film stand the test of time as one of the best short documentary films of all time.\n\nResnais tells a complete story with a gripping subject matter but structures the story in an essay form.\n\nA beautiful telling of a nightmarish story\n\nThe events are told chronologically with the footage from Resnais’ present day, in color, and the archival footage edited seamlessly.\n\nThe tracking shots lead to the Nazis marching in step. The overgrown fields of the 1950’s blend into the ghastly scenes of genocide.\n\nThe writing here is unsentimental and unapologetic. It makes Night and Fog one of the best short films, documentary or otherwise, of all time.\n\n7.2 BEST DOCUMENTARY SHORT FILMS\n\nThe Mushroom Club\n\nThis powerful Academy Award-nominated short film from director Steve Okazaki revisits the story of the first use of the atomic bomb by the United States against Japan.\n\nThe real story in this 34min film is the effects on the lives of those who experienced it. In response to the lackluster coverage of the fiftieth anniversary of the dropping of the bomb, the filmmaker collected these stories of survivors in the short tragic anthology.\n\nThe Mushroom Club\n\nThe director presents questions that no one wants to ask. The answers provide a harrowing portrait of “victory” from the point of view of those who lived in the aftermath of the bombing.\n\nThe survivors or hibakusha get to tell their story. The structure is less important as are the filmmaking skills. The stories come together to make one unforgettable film.\n\n7.3 BEST DOCUMENTARY SHORT FILMS\n\nGod Sleeps In Rwanda\n\nThe best documentary short films all seem to tackle the darkest and most tragic reaches of the human experience. This is no exception.\n\nDirector Kimberlee Acquaro received a Pew Fellowship and later an Academy Award nomination for her film.\n\nGod Sleeps In Rwanda\n\nOnce again, the story’s subject matter is the leading player. But the writing in this short film is essential to the telling of such heavy themes as genocide and human depravity.\n\nNarrated by Rosario Dawson, the writing here doesn’t overwhelm the stories of the five women who rebuild their lives and redefine women's roles in Rwanda. This short film is a story of hope.\n\n7.4 BEST DOCUMENTARY SHORT FILMS\n\nThe Death of Kevin Carter\n\nDirector Dan Krauss paints a tragic portrait of the life of a journalist in this superb short film. The short film comes in at a sparse 27 minutes but packs a punch of any feature-length film.\n\nThe Death of Kevin Carter\n\nThe film sheds light on the suicide of journalist Kevin Carter a few months after winning the Pulitzer Prize and the death of a close friend. The familiarity of Kevin Carter’s work makes the viewer an accomplice\n\nThe film is thorough in the examination of Carter’s life and the events leading to his death. The amount of research that goes into the documentary short is staggering and worthy of its’ Oscar nomination.\n\n7.5 BEST DOCUMENTARY SHORT FILMS\n\nKnife Skills\n\nThis Oscar-nominated short film of 2017 is one of the few documentary short films that delivers a message of hope and redemption.\n\nThis short film is the story of a restaurateur looking to open the best French restaurant in America.\n\nKnife Skills\n\nThe catch? The restaurant is staffed with ex-convicts looking to change their lives. They have a few weeks to learn the kitchen skills.\n\nEx-convicts serve a dose of humanity with their skills. The structure of the story is where filmmakers can really learn a thing or two.\n\nStarting the film on the opening night as an amuse bouche and then serving up the entrèe as the staff is initiated into a brand new world of traditional French cuisine.\n\nIt is funny as a fish out of water stories, frustrating to witness how lives can take a sudden bad turn and a pleasure to watch as men and women are redeemed in a kitchen.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHow to Write a Short Film That Gets You Noticed\n\nNow you know about 30 great short films.
