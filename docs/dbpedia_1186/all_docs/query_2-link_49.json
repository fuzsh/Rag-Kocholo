        "text": "Bill won. My Dad saw it coming. He was the first to computerize. Grandma hated it. She kept the books the old way. I‚Äôve found myself bruised but ahead in the fight against technology change. Rather than hide I fought.\n\nYou can‚Äôt avoid technological progress. My youthful plan was to be one of them. I‚Äôm attracted to what‚Äôs next. It was Microsoft, computers, and technology. The block was my brain. It‚Äôs riddled with learning disabilities.\n\nThis crowd prides themselves on the thinking processor. Mine doesn‚Äôt work properly. What does is my intelligence, imagination, and creative spirit. I‚Äôm battle scarred after many fights. Technology change no longer impacts me.\n\nConsider these guidelines when confronting the double-edged sword Bill and his pals created. I‚Äôm ahead on technology and don‚Äôt bother with AI. You may be surprised. After six months of playing I didn‚Äôt find it compelling.\n\nWhat does matter are platforms to run a modern business. The goal is to be able to do anything immediately. We‚Äôve achieved that goal for pennies. It‚Äôs not been easy. Steve Jobs is rare. Technologists channel Bill more than him.\n\nBill Gates does incredible work in the world. His technology made my life miserable. I‚Äôve got tons of Microsoft horror stories. I could say the same now for Google, Facebook, Salesforce, or any big complex business system.\n\nüîë Pick robust products from anti-corporate cultures but stay away from the technology bleeding-edge. We use Go High Level, Notion, and Discord.\n\nüîë It will be difficult in the beginning but don‚Äôt engage with over designed simple systems unless you fit inside their matrix, or risk getting stuck.\n\nüîë Roll up your sleeves and get dirty. I‚Äôve figured out Salesforce, Circle, MS Access, Mighty Networks, and more niche vendors than I can remember.\n\nüîë Stay away from micro-tech platforms even when they are better. Unless you love tweaking it will make you crazy. These companies get sold anyway.\n\nüîë Hire somebody who doesn‚Äôt know what they are doing but can think clearly, do a barter, or find an expert if you must. Don‚Äôt finish it yourself.\n\nI leaped again this year. Welo and its video metaverse product works better to bring people together than Zoom. The complaining comes with it. It reminds me of when I forced the shift from audio to video conference.\n\n‚ÄúFrom this day forth nobody in the company is allowed to send anybody else an email.‚Äù Gary one of our best sales people almost quit. It was not a request. The world changed. Email was terrible. We needed to get into chat.\n\nSlack was new then. Nobody used it. We were a virtual workforce. I‚Äôm in a co-working space. The rest of the people were spread out across the globe. I looked into the future and changed. Chat and video were critical. Let‚Äôs go.\n\nI don‚Äôt care about technology trends. I knew that email not only exhausted me but everybody else in the world. The days of I‚Äôve Got Mail with a happy ding ended as Tom Hanks got a serious career. Entrepreneurs move fast.\n\nAfter one day Gary called me on the phone. ‚ÄúI love Slack!‚Äù Plot me as a Richard Branson and Gary more like a Usain Bolt Cheetah. He crushed sales. Business closed. Clients loved him. Everybody loved him. He‚Äôs fast.\n\nI was fast at exploring technology platforms that had immediate utility, changed the game, and impacted the company. Gary called people. For me faster means changing everything. From his vantage point it‚Äôs the opposite.\n\nWorking in a process feels slow to me. For Gary changing the process ruins his day. Without one he‚Äôs frustrated. Running one that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs next drives me insane. Today Gary would pop into my office on the campus.\n\nThe technology world sprints and huddles. They use agile. Waterfalls are for vacation. Most regular companies get stuck in the mud. Trying to act like an engineer clips my wings. Learn these principles and rise high.\n\nStick with what is and drown in this world. Chase trends and die. Ronald Reagan said government was the problem. The country agreed after Nixon price controls and stagflation blamed on Carter. The shining city opened.\n\nVolcker thought about people. He was not a family therapist, healing coach, or utopian socialist. The point was to make the economy work. Entrepreneurs must find a way to navigate our shared tech nightmare.\n\nI‚Äôve never had the benefit of an expert that picked the technology, already knew how deploy it, and a staff to manage its ongoing complexity. What I realize now is that my job is to not let the technology barrier screw us up.\n\nThe crushing weight of this turned into my biggest secret weapon. Try this to release structure. My linear process skills, technology chops, and ability to walk a straight line put me squarely in the bottom quadrant of humanity.\n\nTests indicate enough learning disabilities to make it miraculous that I‚Äôm on the cutting-edge of anything of the process variety. The secret weapon comes from a surprise gift. I‚Äôm not afraid of change, uncertainty, or myself.\n\nSilicon Valley crushed my retail distribution business, forced major change when Google adjusted its rules for my lead generation company, and today created so much complexity that it‚Äôs hard to keep anything working well.\n\nVictory over the technology bots will be yours when you realize that you are smarter than them. This surprised me. My expertise is knowing myself, my people, and why I matter to them. That makes me more Steve than Bill.\n\nConsider yourself. Do you run an insurance agency, life coaching practice, or brand marketing consultancy? Are you trying to change the world, feed your family, or pursue a passion? Do you find yourself drowning in silicon?\n\nThe AI panic attack faded into the background. That‚Äôs how fast the cycle goes today. What‚Äôs left is what we need to operate globally without being local. In a perfect world we would meet everybody at the local coffee shop.\n\nHere‚Äôs a playbook to consider how to select, deploy, and complete the platform for your company. It‚Äôs not a manual but rather a thinking system. It‚Äôs based on more than one rodeo. Know yourself and win the tech battle.\n\nProduct: Do you want to create work, do the work, or support others?\n\nTeam: Is the goal to work alone, have support, or build a company?\n\nClients: Would you prefer never to talk to them, sometimes, or always?\n\nFamily: How much of your free time do you want to spend on working?\n\nFuture: What balance must be in place between work, life, and exit?\n\nIt‚Äôs a complex process that‚Äôs simple. The challenge is explaining it here. It‚Äôs easy enough to share my story. That may prompt ideas. You know the answer. Avoid letting the world decide it. Ignore the technology confusion.\n\nDon‚Äôt stick your head in the sand. If you still use Salesforce, don‚Äôt have a decent LinkedIn profile, and can‚Äôt quickly change website copy be worried. It‚Äôs about the technology supporting your business but don‚Äôt be a Luddite.\n\nHere is my personal experience with technology across three of the businesses that I‚Äôve started or run over my career. It‚Äôs not an exhaustive list. That would take a novel. That‚Äôs how often I‚Äôve had to dive into this sandbox.\n\nPEOPLE LEVERAGE\n\nThis older model requires people who work for you. It‚Äôs outdated, not ideal, and I‚Äôd never do it again. If you like it, must, or will perhaps these approaches might be useful. I‚Äôll update it for today‚Äôs world. It‚Äôs creaky.\n\nHiring question: Consider surrounding yourself with a perfectly balanced group. The simple question comes from many years of experience. ‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù Know their vision for themselves.\n\nJob requirements: Think of talent as what a person does without being asked. Ignore background, skills, and experience. You either need somebody to create, motivate, support, or analyze. Then slice and dice.\n\nAbility to succeed: Realize that the most qualified people may be the worst hires and the least the best options. Rank in this order and be flexible. The vision fits, they want it bad, and there is a historical story.\n\nLikelihood to succeed: Share your vision with them. Fully grasp their vision for their life. Create a shared desire. Both of your visions come true as one when you succeed together. The key is coming together.\n\nTechnology strategy: With a team of people each working toward their own vision bonded together in a shared desire life gets easier. When technology crushes you or change is needed you are ready.\n\nWith my family business here‚Äôs what happened. We had a computer. It worked. The business got bigger and it was impossible to run workable reports. I thought and explored. My team synthesized and executed well.\n\nWithin a few months the system was world class. Nobody in our industry had anything like it. We used a relational database before that was a normal business practice in our industry. The last mile required a solo consultant.\n\nVIRTUAL LEVERAGE\n\nThis newer model means the handcuffs of staff are diminished or eliminated. My first experience led to an accidental virtual company. This was before Zoom, Slack, or Google Drive. We had Upworks and Flexjobs.\n\nFind a solid cloud platform. I prefer Notion now. What matters most is to create the team. Don‚Äôt lock onto the technology. Get creative here. Be flexible. I started on Salesforce and switched to Close which worked.\n\nYou must be an expert in the business experience. It‚Äôs not important to architect the process. I‚Äôve never done that because I can‚Äôt do it. It would be like becoming a singer. Notice everything. Know the entire company.\n\nThe partner is your compliment. I had one who built the Salesforce instance in return for becoming a client. In another case a flextime person was so organized that she ended up building a data department.\n\nRealize in this flexible structure the power of freedom. Using the same interview question works. Glen started doing part-time sales calls. He now runs the entire business. I haven‚Äôt worked in it in 4 years. Flexjobs.\n\nTechnology change is constant. Your role is the experience. When it‚Äôs getting bad ring alarm bells. Don‚Äôt direct, dictate, or force outcomes. Realize what must happen. Allow the talent in the system to rise fast.\n\nThis flowing copy will frustrate many of you thinkers. That‚Äôs something that you must embrace. Those stuck in the matrix of structure are going to struggle to succeed in this new world. Accept uncertainty and fluid states.\n\nThe balance the structure above takes depends on where it starts. That‚Äôs squarely in your court. For me the exit was obvious. People leverage worked. The issue was that I didn‚Äôt want a service business. Final step.\n\nLIBERATION LEVERAGE\n\nThe ultimate fantasy is to get everything. This takes thought, emotion, and decision. The pathway to freedom comes from inside. It‚Äôs a matter of knowing that the cycles of technology change will never stop coming.\n\nWhy am I doing this? The obvious answer is money. It‚Äôs a trick question. Imagine yourself years later now bored with your $100M severance package. If the answer is hang out on the beach that‚Äôs the real answer.\n\nWhat do I want? This one requires a bit of imagination. You must release yourself from the prisons of doubt, fear, and exhaustion. My answer often was to do nothing. It turns out I want to explore and think.\n\nHow can I get it? The leap of faith into the dark happens gradually, suddenly, or never at all. For me it was a long process of learning not to force results, chase business, or make it happen. Now I learn and share.\n\nWhat blocks me? The parking break barriers bring an infinite variety of sparring partners to the table. They include the gifts of unworthiness, self-absorption and judgment, and burdens from attachment and belief.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the technology? The company must reflect you without the parking breaks. It‚Äôs your finest hour lived as a life in constant motion. For me it‚Äôs a structure that allows me to explore and think and impact.\n\nIt‚Äôs beyond the scope of any article to get into the details. The point is knowing yourself well enough to go in the right direction. Everything is possible today. I‚Äôve created a group structure. Our interests are aligned.\n\nAs a solopreneur it‚Äôs possible for me to scale to great heights. It‚Äôs hard for people to realize this today. My reality proves differently. The model depends on what you want. Liberation came as I can‚Äôt control the change.\n\nRed Pill Pathway offers entrepreneurs, supporting coaches, and service providers More Money Now Approaches and Prosperity Strategies.
