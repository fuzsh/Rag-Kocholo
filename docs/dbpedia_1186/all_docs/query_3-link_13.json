        "text": "In New York in 1928, a struggling playwright is forced to cast a mobster's talentless girlfriend in his latest drama in order to get it produced.\n\nA theatre director struggles with his work, and the women in his life, as he creates a life-size replica of New York City inside a warehouse as part of his new play.\n\nDuring the production of his new movie, a director wants to add a scene to improve the film's narrative by emphasising the aesthetic of female nudity. Endless negotiations ensue between lunch and dinner. Can they conclude?\n\nAs an aging playwright interacts with the young lead in his play after everybody's gone home, he reminisces about her mother, whom he maintained a sexual relationship with before she died.\n\nActress Brandy Burre gave up a recurring role on a TV series to start a family. Years later, her domestic life crumbles when she tries to reclaim her former career.\n\nThe head of a Japanese theatre troupe returns to a small coastal town where he left a son who thinks he is his uncle, and tries to make up for the lost time, but his current mistress grows jealous.\n\nIn early-1930s Germany, a passionate stage actor faces a dilemma: renounce his apolitical stance and comply with the Reich's doctrine, or face oblivion. But, Faustian bargains never end well. What is the price of success?\n\nA film star comes face-to-face with an uncomfortable reflection of herself while starring in a revival of the play that launched her career.\n\nFrom beyond the grave, celebrated playwright Antoine d'Anthac gathers together all his friends who have appeared over the years in his play \"Eurydice.\" These actors watch a recording of the work performed by a young acting company, La Compagnie de la Colombe. Do love, life, death and love after death still have any place on a theater stage? It's up to them to decide. And the surprises have only just begun...\n\nA fading comedian and a suicidally despondent ballet dancer must look to each other to find purpose and hope in their lives.\n\nIn occupied Paris, an actress married to a Jewish theater owner must keep him hidden from the Germans while doing both of their jobs.\n\nAn aspiring director and the marginally talented amateur cast of a hokey small-town Missouri musical production go overboard when they learn that someone from Broadway will be in attendance.\n\nWhen the leading lady of a Broadway musical breaks her ankle, she is replaced by a young unknown actress, who becomes the star of the show."
