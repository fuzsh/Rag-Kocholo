Anne Hathaway portrayed the movie’s Andy Sachs, who is an aspiring journalist that lands a job under Miranda at Runway magazine, losing herself and her vision while trying to impress her boss.\n\nIn July 2022, The Devil Wears Prada musical debuted in Chicago with a limited run through August of that year. The show enlisted a new creative team under director Jerry Mitchell in 2023 with plans to revive the musical in London’s West End the following year. Vanessa Williams was announced in February 2024 as the new Miranda Priestly for when the England version debuts in October 2024."
