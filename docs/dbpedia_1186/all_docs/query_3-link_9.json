I took a look at the number of movies based on Shakespeare plays. In summary…\n\nThere are 525 films which give Shakespeare some sort of writing credit\n\nOf those, 294 are full adaptations of Shakespeare plays\n\nHamlet is the most often adapted Shakespeare play\n\nOver half of all Shakespeare feature film adaptations are based on Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth or Othello.\n\nOf the movies based on Shakespeare, which plays are most frequently adapted?\n\nIn total, there are 525 feature films which give William Shakespeare some form of writing credit. Looking in more detail at these films I found 294 films which are full feature film adaptations of Shakespeare plays.\n\nWhat counts as an adaptation?\n\nWikipedia currently lists 410 Shakespeare adaptations, crediting the fact the Guinness Book of World Records, whereas IMDb lists 1,095 projects which credit William Shakespeare in some way. These IMDb projects including not movie items (short films, TV shows, games, etc). for the research above I personally went through the projects, assessing what was a feature film and a valid adaptation."
