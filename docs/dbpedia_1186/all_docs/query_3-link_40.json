        "text": "The popular children's story of Peter Pan, written by Scottish playwright J. M. Barrie, has been retold in various adaptations in media, film being the most popular. Some have been straight up adaptations of the story, others reimagined origin stories and prequels.\n\nLive-action[]\n\nPeter Pan by Paramount Pictures (1924), an authorised silent movie adaptation. It starred Betty Bronson as Peter Pan, Ernest Torrence as Captain Hook, Mary Brian as Wendy Darling, and Virginia Brown Faire as Tinker Bell.
