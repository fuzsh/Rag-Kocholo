        "text": "Some may say we are in a renaissance of video game adaptations as we've been treated to The Super Mario Bros. Movie, another Sonic the Hedgehog film, and a TV series based on The Last of Us and Fallout, and will soon be getting adaptations of God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, and so many more. The best part? A lot of these look so much better than video game adaptations we’ve gotten in the past.\n\nHow many will actually make it through development and see the light of day remains to be seen, and only a fraction of these have actual release dates. But we're watching these projects, and we're tracking them!\n\nFor the purposes of this list, we classify a “video game movie” or \"TV show\" as an actual adaptation of an existing video game, so something like Wreck-It Ralph (which is just a movie about video games) wouldn’t qualify. They don’t have to be faithful adaptations – they just have to be based on a real game.\n\nClick on through the slideshow below for a glimpse, or read on to find out about the biggest projects with definite details. And if you see something incorrect, missing, or in need of an update, let us know in the comments!\n\nWhat Are the Next Video Game Movies and TV Shows Coming Out? 2024 and Beyond Release Dates\n\nFor those keeping track, here's the full lineup of upcoming video game movie and TV show adaptations:\n\nVideo Game Movies in 2024 and Beyond\n\nBorderlands (August 9, 2024)\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 3 (December 20, 2024)\n\nMinecraft: The Movie (April 4, 2025)\n\nFive Nights at Freddy’s 2 (Fall 2025)\n\nThe Super Mario Bros.

While news was slow for several years after that, Lionsgate surprised fans in February 2020 by announcing Hostel's Eli Roth will direct the movie, with Chernobyl's Craig Mazin penning a new screenplay draft. Cate Blanchett has been confirmed to star as Lilith, and Kevin Hart will also star as Roland. The cast also includes Ariana Greenblatt as Tiny Tina, Florian Munteanu as Kreig, Jamie Lee Curtis as Tannis, and Jack Black as Claptrap.

Additionally, The Witcher: Blood Origin's Tasha Huo will be writing and executive producing the show.\n\nNetflix shared this new series will be released on October 10, 2024, and gave fans their best look yet at the show with its first trailer.\n\n\"Following the events of the Survivor series, Lara Croft has abandoned her friends to embark on increasingly more perilous solo adventures,\" the official description reads. \"But she must return home when a dangerous and powerful Chinese artifact is stolen from Croft Manor by a thief with an uncanny personal connection. Her daring pursuit will take her on an adventure around the world and to the depths of forgotten tombs, where she will be forced to confront her true self, and decide just what kind of hero she wants to become.\"\n\nLike a Dragon: Yakuza\n\nRelease Date: October 15 and November 1, 2024\n\nPrime Video surprised and delighted fans when it announced Like a Dragon: Yakuza, a live-action series based on the beloved franchise of the same name, will be arriving on the streamer in two batches on October 25 and November 1, 2024. The show will run for six episodes and Ryoma Takeuchi will be taking on the role of Kazuma Kiryu.\n\nArcane: Season 2\n\nRelease Date: November 2024 on Netflix\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe popular animated series based on League of Legends will return in November 2024, as will Hailee Steinfeld's Vi, Ella Purnell's Jinx, and Katie Leung's Caitlyn Kiramman. We were treated to the first trailer in January 2024 and it seems to confirm a major Season 1 fan theory. Most recently, Netflix has revealed a poster and a small teaser that has fans theorizing about a time skip.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 3\n\nRelease Date: December 20, 2024\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 3 will officially speed into theaters on December 20, 2024, and will follow the second film that became the highest-grossing video game movie of all time in the US.

We haven't been given any details on the new season's story yet, but we did learn who will be playing some of our favorite characters from the game, including Kaitlyn Dever as Abby, Young Manzino as Jesse, and Isabella Merced as Dina.\n\nIt was also confirmed by showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann that Season 2 will have a shorter episode count, but that Season 3 could be \"significantly larger.\"\n\nIn our review of HBO's The Last of Us, we said it \"is a breathtaking adaptation of one of the most impactful stories told in video games and brilliantly brings Joel and Ellie’s journey to a whole new audience. Taking the essence of what made the original tale so enduring, it builds out the world of the game while also switching up some aspects to almost entirely stunning effect.\"\n\nMinecraft: The Movie\n\nRelease Date: April 4, 2025\n\nPeter Sollett (Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist) has been attached to direct the Minecraft movie, which will tell the story of a teenage girl trying to save the Overworld from an Ender Dragon.

We don't know much about the movie, but Shigeru Miyamoto shared the team is \"thinking about broadening Mario's world further, and it'll have a bright an fun story!\"\n\nA sequel to The Super Mario Bros. Movie must have been the easiest decision for Nintendo as was seen by over 168.1 million people worldwide and made over $1.349 billion at the global box office.\n\nFallout Season 2\n\nRelease Date: TBA\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe first season of Prime Video's Fallout series was a huge success. In our Fallout TV show review, we said, \"A bright and funny apocalypse filled with dark punchlines and bursts of ultra-violence, Fallout is among the best video game adaptations ever made.\"\n\nWhile we don't know much about Season 2, showrunners Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner said the team is is working \"as fast as we possibly can\" to get it out to fans.
