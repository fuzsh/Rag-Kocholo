        "text": "Share this Article:\n\nHollywood still loves its follow-ups – here’s our round-up of 135 (and counting) sequels currently on the way. Hollywood has got just a little warier of sequels over the past few years, and many that were in development – such as a new chapter in the Die Hard franchise – now appear to be in some kind of limbo. But still: follow-ups are very much on the cards, and here’s our always-evolving list of all the sequels we know about. The Accountant 2 A project that’s bumbled around for a while and is apparently still on the cooker somewhere, Ben Affleck confirmed back in March 2019 that plans were still in place for a sequel to the modest hit The Accountant. Gavin O’Connor is the incumbent director, and he’s reportedly getting filming underway in March. After series Based on books series of the same name we’ve already had After and After We Collided. With 4 books in the series, the film adaptations for books 3 and 4 After We Fell and After Ever After completed production at the end of 2020. In addition to this, it was announced in April 2021 that there would be an additional 2 films. Before, a loose adaptation of the prequel book, as well as another film set in the future, with the focus this time on the children of the first films leads. At the same time, distributor Voltage Pictures have said the fifth installment, 2023’s After Everything, marked the end of the franchise, so we’ll have to wait and see if anything else crops up. The Animal 2 Yes, Rob Schneider is returning for a sequel to 2001’s The Animal. Schneider will once again be playing the role of Marvin Mange, a man who gets animal parts following a near-fatal injury. Those animal parts lead to him behaving differently. Patricia Schneider, Rob Schneider and Jamie Lissow are set to pen the script, and the current plan is for Schneider to direct, too. Instead of going to cinemas, The Animal 2 has been ordered for Fox’s Tubi platform. Filming on this unlikely sequel was set to start in 2023, but nothing seems to have come through yet. Aladdin 2 Following the giant success of Disney’s live action take on Aladdin in 2019, the studio is now said to be considering a follow-up to the movie. Although whether it’ll follow the path set by the animated The Return Of Jafar is unknown. Producer Dan Lin confirmed that work is being done to explore another film, although as of yet, no further announcements have been made. There are also plans for a Disney+ spin-off project that may or may not replace a direct sequel. A Most Violent Year 2 J C Chandor’s excellent drama A Most Violent Year gave terrific roles to Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac. And it’s Chastain, via her Twitter account, who kicked off 2020 teasing that a further production may be in the offing. Her Tweet is here, although it’s vague: does she mean a new film, or a TV spin-off? We’ll find out in due course… A Simple Favour 2 Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively will return for a sequel to their 2018 thriller A Simple Favour. In the first film, Kendrick played single mum and vlogger Stephanie, who befriends the enigmatic Emily (Lively). When Emily vanishes, dark truths begin to emerge about her past. Paul Feig will return to direct, and Jessica Sharzer will again be writing the script. The film doesn’t yet have a release date. Atomic Blonde 2 Charlize Theron headlined the action hit Atomic Blonde back in 2017, and it was revealed pretty soon after that that sequel talk had begun. Director David Leitch, as recently as summer 2019, confirmed that a follow-up was still being chatted about, but he also suggested it may not head to cinemas, with instead a streaming service picking the project up. The events of 2020 do seem to have made this one less likely, sadly. Attack The Block 2 Joe Cornish is directing the sequel to his debut feature, one decade on from the original. What’s more, he’s got his star back too, with John Boyega leading the cast once again. Boyega will also produce this time as well. We await details of a release date, but production is expected to begin sooner rather than later. Avatar 3, 4 and 5 The next of James Cameron’s Avatar films to arrive in cinemas will be the third in the series, though its official title is yet to be announced. The film was shot at the same time as last year’s Avatar: The Way Of Water, so it’s surprisingly close to being completed, despite its release date of December 2025. A lot of the cast of The Way Of Water will return, with Michelle Yeoh and David Thewlis playing new characters. Cameron has also said that the villains of the film will be the ‘ash people’, a tribe of Na’Vi that inhabit a region of Pandora that hasn’t yet been explored in the series. Avatars 4 and 5 have been delayed to 2029 and 2031, respectively. Avengers 5 and 6 Once titled Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, the fifth Avengers film will see a new group of heroes take on the title. It will see Kang, who was introduced in Disney+’s Loki series, take on the superhero team. Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings’ Destin Daniel Cretton was initially set to direct, with Ant-Man 3's Jeff Loveness writing the script. Following fairly closely behind is Avengers: Secret Wars, which will apparently end the ‘Multiverse saga’ of films that began with Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness. Majors’ role in these films has recently been cast into doubt as he was arrested on charges of strangulation, abuse and harassment in March. We’ll have to see if the studio decides to recast Kang – Daniel Cretton left the project in November 2023, apparently to focus on Shang-Chi 2, which has cast more doubt on the likelihood of the project to get over the line in its current state. In June 2023 it was announced that the two Avengers sequels had been delayed by about a year. The Kang Dynasty (or whatever the film’s title turns out to be) will now be released in May 2026, with Secret Wars following in May 2027.\n\nOUR BEST EVER SUBSCRIPTION OFFER!

Chris Bremner, who co-wrote the third, is back on scripting duties. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are coming back too, with Jerry Bruckheimer producing. Expect a shorter gap between films three and four than we got between films two and three. The Batman 2 Matt Reeves and Robert Pattinson are both set to return to the world of the caped crusade for a sequel to The Batman. Reeves will write and direct the film, though no further details are available yet. Stay tuned. Beetlejuice 2 A sequel to Tim Burton’s Beetlejuice has long been talked about, but never materialised. Now it seems it may finally be in the works at production company Plan B, with Michael Keaton and Winona Ryder set to reprise their roles as the titular character and Lydia Deetz, respectively. Burton is back in the director’s chair for this one, and Jenna Ortega – who worked with him on Netflix series Wednesday – will play Lydia Deetz’s daughter. Filming wrapped in the tail-end of 2023 (having been thrown off course slightly by a few strikes we might have mentioned), with a pending release date under the title Beetlejuice Beetlejuice of September 2024. Beverly Hills Cop 4 In a surprise move, Paramount is partnering with Netflix on the long-mooted Beverly Hills Cop sequel, that will see Eddie Murphy reprise the role of Axel Foley for what we assume will be the last time. Jerry Bruckheimer returns to produce, and the film will go straight to Netflix’s streaming service. It was originally set to be directed by Adil Al Arbi and Bilall Fallah, who quit the project to focus on DC’s Batgirl. Mark Molloy has now taken the reins, and the film’s been given the non-numeric title Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F. Bill & Ted 4 It only took 29 years for Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter to reunite on the big screen with 2020’s Bill & Ted Face The Music. According to the latter’s January 2024 appearance on The Sarah O’Connell Show, though, ideas are being floated for another instalment to come at a comparatively blistering pace – though nothing is confirmed yet. “We’re tinkering with a fourth movie idea that all of us like, and the guys are going to write, so we’ll see”, Winter said. “It takes us time to get these things going, and we never want to do them unless they’re great”. Bright 2 It looks like the sequel to the hugely expensive Netflix movie starring Will Smith is back on. David Ayer (Suicide Squad) directed the first film, that was written by Max Landis. Landis will not be back for the sequel, with the job of penning the follow-up now falling to Evan Spiliotopoulos and T S Nowlin. Expect Smith to return, but no sign yet as to when this one goes before the cameras. Brightburn 2 James Gunn – who co-wrote and produced the first film – is toying with a sequel to Brightburn, the low budget superhero horror that was directed by David Yarovesky. Discussions are said to be underway, but Gunn’s commitment to DC’s burgeoning cinematic universe likely takes precedence. Might be waiting a while for this one. Bring It On A new sequel to the hit movie about competing cheerleading squads is in discussion. Both Kirsten Dunst and Gabrielle Union have been chatting about returning to the franchise, along with original director Peyton Reed, and it’s understood that they were developing the film come the end of 2020. Still some way to go with this one, though. Captain America 4 The Disney+ series Falcon And The Winter Soldier passed the role of Captain America on to Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson. Now, we know that the next Captain America film, Brave New World, will take place in phase five of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and will be directed by The Cloverfield Paradox's Julius Onah. Falcon And The Winter Soldier showrunner Malcolm Spellman has penned the script alongside staff writer Dalan Musson. Clifford The Big Red Dog 2 The animated/live action hybrid film about, well, a canine of some size proved to be a solid box office performer. In double quick time, Entertainment One has ordered Clifford The Big Red Dog 2. The earliest you’re likely to see it – assuming you’re going to see it – is the end of 2023. Jack Whitehall is expected to return. As well as the mutt of the title. Cold Pursuit 2 Studiocanal has announced that it’s ordered a follow-up to its Liam Neeson-headlined action-thriller Cold Pursuit. It’s expected that Neeson will return, but no casting and crew details accompanied the announcement. Still, don’t expect this to take too long to come together. Constantine 2 Despite the management shake up that’s gone on at DC, placing James Gunn and Peter Safran in charge, a sequel to 2005’s Constantine is still in the works. Star Keanu Reeves (who plays the titular occult expert) and director Francis Lawrence are both set to return. The sequel hasn’t appeared on the newly announced slate of DC movies, so we don’t yet have a release date. It is, however, in development. Crazy Rich Asians 2 and 3 Two sequels are planned to the hit 2018 romantic comedy, all based on books by Kevin Kwan. The plan is – because of scheduling conflicts – to shoot them both back to back in 2020, with the first likely to be released in 2021. Filming is now expected to begin in 2025, with Jon M. Chu returning to direct and Amy Wong writing the script after Adele Lim departed the project over a pay dispute. Creed 4 After some well-received success with the ninth installment in the Rocky-verse, Creed III, star Michael B. Jordan is set to return as director of the sequel, according to producer Irvin Winkler. “We’re planning to do ‘Creed 4’ right now — it’s in the works — and we think we have a really good story, a really good plot,” Winkler said, adding that the plans were delayed “because of strike, like everybody else” but “probably a year from now [November 2023] we’re going for pre-production.” Deadpool And Wolverine The first Deadpool movie to be part of Marvel’s Cinematic Universe, Deadpool And Wolverine sees Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman reprise their title roles in another R-rated, irreverent action opus. The merc with the mouth will be the only MCU movie to release in 2024, and is scheduled for 25th July. Death Note 2 Perhaps a surprising one considering the lukewarm reaction to the first live-action adaptation of the popular anime, Netflix has ordered a sequel to Death Note, drawing this time from the original source material. The script is being penned by Greg Russo (Mortal Kombat), but little else about the project is known. Demolition Man 2 Out of the blue, Sylvester Stallone announced on his Instagram feed in May of 2020 that a follow-up to 1993’s Demolition Man was finally on the cards. Warner Bros is backing the project once again, and development is underway. No word yet on if writer Daniel Waters is returning, nor any timescale for the project. Den Of Thieves 2 The first Den Of Thieves film remains a very welcome treat, with Gerard Butler leading a collection of, well, thieves, in a film that pays respectful homage to the likes of Heat. The second film has the subtitle Pantera, and Christian Gudagast is once again writing and directing. O’Shea Jackson and 50 Cent are also returning, and the film was due in 2021, but filming didn’t actually wrap until July 2023. It currently has a non-specific 2024 release date. Despicable Me 4 With prequel film Minions: The Rise Of Gru proving itself as one of the few box office titans of 2022, Universal and Illumination have given a date for the next main series sequel. Despicable Me 4 is due on 3rd July 2024, with the main voice cast returning. There aren’t any story details yet, but we’ll keep you posted. Detective Pikachu 2 Announced even before the first film proved to be such a delight, Oren Uziel has signed on to pen the next Pokemon movie (having previously written 22 Jump Street). Ryan Reynolds should be back on voicing duties, and Rob Letterman is the incumbent director. Dirty Dancing 2 35 years have passed since 1987’s Dirty Dancing was released. Now it’s getting a sequel, with original star Jennifer Grey set to return to the role of Frances ‘Baby’ Houseman. A teaser for the sequel was shown at CinemaCon, where footage from the original film was shown along with a voiceover announcing Baby’s return to Kellerman’s – the name of the movie’s summer resort. Grey will also be executive producing. There’s no release date yet, but we will keep you informed. District 10 This one’s back on the radar, with director Neill Blomkamp being asked about the movie extensively whilst promoting his latest horror Demonic. He’s determined that District 10 will be a sequel to eschew the idea of a follow-up having to bigger and more expansive than the original, and he’s at work on the script at the moment. Hopefully this will be his next film. Dodgeball 2 A follow-up to the 2004 comedy is now in the works, with Vince Vaughn set to return. It’s in early development at 20th Century Studios. Jordan VanDina is penning the script, although plot details are being kept under wraps at the moment. In the first film, Vaughn played local gym owner Peter La Fleur, who enters a dodgeball tournament with his friends to save the gym being taken over by a corporation (headed by Ben Stiller). It’s unclear at the moment if Stiller will also be involved. Drag Me To Hell 2 Despite Sam Raimi’s 2009 horror film having what you might call a definitive ending for its main character, the director has revealed that a sequel is currently in development. Raimi revealed in a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything) that ideas are being formed for the story of the potential sequel, and he’s hoping to find the perfect one. Dune: Sandworm Drift Denis Villeneuve returned to Arrakis with aplomb in 2024’s Dune: Part Two, and after making a shedload of cash at the box office, it’s no surprise that the director is in talks for a sequel. Thought to be based on the notoriously “unfilmable” second Dune novel, Messiah, Villeneuve is currently having a chat with Legendary productions about when production will get underway proper, though a script seems to be nearing completion already. Enola Holmes 3 Milly Bobby Brown has starred in two Netflix films as Sherlock Holmes’ younger sister Enola. The movies have seen her run away from home to set up her own detective agency, while fighting against the misogyny of the Victorian era. Netflix is keen to make a third instalment, and it’s been reported that a script for it is currently in the works. No plot details yet as it’s early days, but it’ll presumably pick up where Enola Holmes 2 left off. That’s with Henry Cavill’s Sherlock acquiring a new flatmate in the form of Himesh Patel’s John Watson, and with adversary Moriarty (Sharon Duncan-Brewster) on the loose. Eternals 2 Now Tom Holland isn’t the only Marvel actor known for letting confidential information slip, as Patton Oswalt confirmed that Eternals 2 is in fact happening. Not only that, but Chloe Zhao will also return to direct the project. Oswalt voiced Pip the Troll in the first movie’s post credits scene, appearing alongside Harry Styles’ Starfox. Strangely, this sequel wasn’t announced at San Diego Comic-Con 2022, when all the other upcoming Marvel projects were announced. Oswalt must know something we don’t, so you can bet if the film does happen, his character (and likely Styles) will be involved. Evil Dead 6 Lee Cronin’s Evil Dead Rise is a bloody, crunchy and sometimes blackly comic entry into Sam Raimi’s horror franchise. A sequel hasn’t been officially announced yet, but Cronin has been very open about the fact that he’d love to make another Evil Dead. He’s even floated some of his ideas in interviews, including making a more traditional instalment set in the woods, or exploring what happens in the apartment building from Rise when the clean-up crew turn up. He’s also thought about following protagonist Beth into the next film, or even doing a prequel exploring the origins of his film’s Necronomicon and what happened when it was discovered by a group of priests. All exciting ideas, and I do hope Cronin gets the chance to bring one of them to life. The Exorcist With David Gordon Green’s The Exorcist: Believer underperforming in critically and commercially, Universal and Blumhouse are having to rethink their plans for the horror franchise. A planned sequel, subtitled Deceiver, has already been scripted as was planned to once again be helmed by David Gordon Green. All that is now apparently under review. Given that Universal paid a whopping $400m for the rights, it’s clear that there will be more Exorcist films coming our way. Rumour has it that Mike Flanagan – of Doctor Sleep and The Haunting Of Hill House fame – is in talks to give his spin on the franchise, but nothing’s confirmed yet. Face/Off Director Adam Wingard and his writing partner Simon Barrett are at work on a new Face/Off movie, that we’re now told will be a sequel to the 90s favourite, rather than a remake or reboot. That said, don’t expect either John Travolta or Nicolas Cage to return. The movie is in its early stages, so more details are a little way off yet. Fall 2 and 3 2022 thriller Fall created its suspense from the vertigo-inducing heights involved in its story. It saw box office success, but has really found its audience after landing on Netflix. Now, it’s set to get two sequels! Director Scott Mann is returning to work on both films, serving as producer on both instalments, as well as co-writing and directing the third movie. The film will apparently incorporate the characters from the first movie, while also making room for new characters to be introduced. We’re not sure Fall needs two sequels, but we’re intrigued at least. Fantastic Beasts & Where To Find Them 4 and 5 With Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets Of Dumbledore disappointing at the box office, it’s unclear if the planned fourth and fifth instalments in the series will go ahead. Producer David Heyman confirmed shortly after release that no script has been written yet, and it seems all involved are waiting to see how the third film fares before making any big decisions. Director David Yates also said in November 2023 that the series has been “parked” for now, but in theory Warner Bros haven’t officially cancelled the franchise yet. Fast & Furious 11 With Fast X released in cinemas in May 2023 (and ending on a pretty big cliffhanger), we’ll have to wait for the next instalment to find out what becomes of Vin Diesel’s Dominic Toretto and his family. From the huge cast of X, we can assume that Fast & Furious 11 (not the official title) will also feature a wide array of the franchise’s characters, as well as (hopefully) Jason Momoa’s wonderfully flamboyant and nutty villain. There’s no official release date yet, but Diesel revealed at CinemaCon 2023 that the movie will be released in 2025. There are also rumours that Diesel plans to stretch out the franchise’s finale into another instalment, taking it up to 12 films – however, this also isn’t confirmed. Final Destination 6 Warner Bros confirmed at 2023’s CinemaCon that Final Destination 6 is happening. Zach Lipovsky and Adam B Stein will be directing, with Jon Watts (who helmed Tom Holland’s Spider-Man trilogy) producing. No exact story details have been released yet, but we’re sure that, true to form, a group of people will evade death in a horrible accident only to have death come hunt them down afterwards. Freaky Friday 2 In October 2022, Jamie Lee Curtis told The View that she’d personally “written to Disney” to ask about a new Freaky Friday flick. It must have been a pretty persuasive letter, because the body-swap follow-up officially started filming in June 2024, with both Curtis and Lindsay Lohan reprising their roles from the 2003 comedy. Late Night and The High Note director Nisha Ganatra is helming this one, which Disney have promised will arrive in cinemas (!) sometime in 2025. Free Guy 2 Disney may have inherited the film Free Guy when it bought up the Fox film company’s assets, but this is one of the few films it acquired that way that hit big. Ryan Reynolds and director Shawn Levy are now both returning for more, as Free Guy becomes a franchise. No release date for Free Guy 2 has thus far been revealed though. Frozen 3 With the news of job cuts and falling Disney+ subscribers comes some good news – there are some more sequels to their billion-dollar-grossing hits on the way. One of them is Frozen 3, although at the moment that’s all we know. There’s no expected release date or filmmaker attached, but we’ll let you know more once those details are announced. Gerard Butler Has Fallen 4, 5 and 6 Following the success of Olympus Has Fallen, London Has Fallen and more recently Angel Has Fallen, Gerard Butler is now expected back as Mike Banning up to three more times. A spin-off TV show is being planed too. No release dates as of yet, but don’t expect them to mess around knocking these out. The first will be called Night Has Fallen. Girls Trip 2 A sequel to the 2017 comedy Girls Trip is definitely happening, according to the film’s co-writer Tracy Oliver. The next movie will see the main characters (played again by Regina Hall, Queen Latifah, Jada Pinkett Smith and Tiffany Haddish) travel to Ghana in a bid to attend annual festival Afrochella. While the script is written, it hasn’t yet been submitted, so production on this is likely still a while off at the moment. No news yet on a potential director or other cast, either. Gladiator 2 Director Ridley Scott is showing no signs of slowing down, and so it looks like the long-mooted Gladiator sequel is finally pressing ahead. It’s been announced that the casting process for Gladiator 2 has begun, and there are a huge amount of names attached. Paul Mescal is starring, and Pedro Pascal and Denzel Washington are also set to appear. Joint Emperors Caracalla and Geta are to be played by Stranger Thing's Joseph Quinn and The White Lotus' Fred Heschinger, respectively. The latter was meant to be played by Barry Keoghan, who later dropped out. That’s not all – Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou and Derek Jacobi are all returning to the roles they played in the original movie. There aren’t currently any details on what the story will involve, but the film had started production by summer 2023 – only to be halted by the WGA and SAG strikes. Godzilla = Kong The Godzilla-Kong monsterverse is the kaiju that never stops stomping, with the last installment, Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire cruising to $559m worldwide. It’s no surprise, then, that Warner Bros are looking at a follow-up. Legendary announced in May 2024 that David Callaham, who wrote the early drafts to Godzilla (2014), has been tasked to write a sequel to The New Empire, with Adam Wingard reportedly keen to come back in the director’s chair. Good Burger 2 This seems like an unlikely sequel, and yet it’s been greenlit. Nickelodeon stars Kenan and Kel are reprising their roles from Good Burger for a belated follow-up. The first film was a spin-off from series All That, and saw Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell playing employees at a local burger restaurant. They then find themselves fighting to save it when a big chain moves in across the road. Kevin Kopelow and Heath Seifert are penning the sequel’s script, and Phil Traill will direct. The movie will be released on Paramount+, and already has an official synopsis: “Dexter Reed (Thompson) is down on his luck after another one of his inventions fails. Ed (Mitchell) welcomes Dex back to Good Burger with open arms and gives him his old job back. With a new crew working at Good Burger, Dex devises a plan to get back on his feet but unfortunately puts the fate of Good Burger at risk once again.” Greenland 2 Going as spoiler-light as possible, the really good Gerard Butler-headlined disaster movie Greenland ended with a natural place to take the story next. It’s now been confirmed that a follow-up is indeed on the way, bringing back the core creatives. No word on a release date yet though. Greyhound 2 That’s right, Tom Hanks’ World War II film Greyhound is getting a sequel, too. After the original was released on the Apple TV+ streaming service during the pandemic, it’s reported that the sequel will be released there as well. Greyhound became the most-watched film debut on the streaming service at the time, so it’s no wonder they’ve greenlit a second one. It’s part of an exclusive deal between Hanks’ production company Playtone Productions and the Apple streaming service. Gunpowder Milkshake 2 Director Navot Papushado’s Gunpowder Milkshake – starring Karen Gillan and Lena Headey – hadn’t even been released when Studiocanal announced its follow-up at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival. No word yet on when it’ll go into production, just that it’s happening. Happy Death Day 3 This one is still waiting for the green light from Universal, by Happy Death Day filmmaker Chris Landon is extremely keen to get cracking on a third film in this incredibly fun slasher series. Landon has said his vision for this one is pretty ambitious, with it being bigger in scale and needing a bigger budget than the previous two movies. He’s also open to the sequel being released on streaming rather than in cinemas, so we’ll keep an eye out and see what happens with this project. Happy Gilmore 2 Rumour had it that a script for a follow-up to Adam Sandler’s 1996 golf comedy had been written in March 2024, and it wasn’t long before Netflix officially confirmed the news with a greenlight. Aside from Sandler, none of the cast or creative team have been announced yet, though it’s expected that Christopher McDonald will be making a return after Sandler reportedly showed him a version of the script. Hobbs & Shaw 2 Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham are set to return for the Fast & Furious spin-off’s sequel, following the sizeable success of the first picture. The announce of the project’s existence came in March 2020, so there’s still a long way to go before it makes it to the screen. But it’s happening, albeit awaiting a writer and director. Hocus Pocus 3 After the success of Disney’s belated sequel to the cult classic Halloween movie, there’s a third one in development. Anne Fletcher, who directed Hocus Pocus 2, and Jen D’Angelo, who co-wrote the script with Fletcher, are both returning. No news yet on whether the Bette Midler, Kathy Najimy and Sarah Jessica Parker will be reprising their roles as the Sanderson sisters, but Midler has expressed her love of the character in interviews. I Am Legend 2 Will Smith’s post-apocalyptic thriller is set to get a sequel. This time, Creed's Michael B. Jordan will be starring, and it will be set a few decades after the first film. It’s pressing ahead at Warner Bros, but there’s no news yet on who will be directing. I Know What You Did Last Summer… Again After the return of the Scream franchise, Sony is looking to resurrect I Know What You Did Last Summer with another sequel. With both Freddie Prinze Jr. and Jennifer Love Hewitt in talks to reprise their roles, you can bet this would be a legacy sequel if they do come for another instalment. Do Revenge's Jennifer Kaytin Robinson is set to direct with Leah McKendrick writing the screenplay. This will be the fourth movie in the series, and the third to star Hewitt and Prinze Jr. John Wick 5 We knew that Lionsgate had been working on expanding the John Wick universe – mainly with spin-offs like next year’s Ballerina and the TV show The Continental. It seemed pretty clear, though, that 2023’s John Wick: Chapter 4 was made to bring the series to a close. Nonetheless, Lionsgate doesn’t seem to want to leave the franchise alone, and thus chairman Joe Drake has teased that John Wick 5 is in early development. We’re not exactly sure what the story will entail, but it’s likely to tie in with all those spin-offs that are currently in the works. Joker 2 The sequel to Todd Phillips’ Joker is set to be a musical officially named Joker: Folie à Deux. Joaquin Phoenix is confirmed to be returning, with Lady Gaga starring alongside him as psychiatrist-turned-scary-clown-lady Harley Quinn. Todd Phillips returns to direct, and the film is due to be released on 4th October 2024. Jumanji 4 The core cast of Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan, Kevin Hart and Jack Black are set to return for another Jumanji adventure, that’ll presumably pick up from around where The Next Level left off. Director Jake Kasdan is set to return, but the project was in its very early stages of conversation before the Coronavirus outbreak hit. Might be a while before we hear anything more. Jungle Cruise 2 Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson have both signed up for a sequel to Jungle Cruise, that also brings back director Jaume Collet-Serra is going to direct. Expect this to take a few years to happen, but given the $100m gross at the US box office for the original – at a time when films weren’t doing that – it should get moving soon. Karate Kid Following the huge success of Karate Kid sequel series Cobra Kai, a new Karate Kid film is in the works at Sony. We’ve recently learn that it’ll feature no fewer than two mentors – Jackie Chan and Ralph Macchio, which is just greedy if you ask us – while the new Karate Kid of the title will be played by Ben Wang, best known as the star of American Born Chinese. Filming is due to get going in early 2024, so a 2025 release is looking likely at the time of writing. Kick-Ass 3 Matthew Vaughn has revealed that a new chapter in the Kick-Ass franchise is in the works. When the first movie landed in 2010, just shortly after the Marvel Cinematic Universe became a thing, it felt like a fresh and bold twist on a new cinema trend. The sequel was a bit less successful. Now, over a decade later, we’re due a third film. The characters from the previous movies won’t be returning, and the threequel will feature an entirely new cast of characters. It will, however, be set in the same world as the other Kick-Ass instalments. Speaking at New York Comic Con, Vaughn named this new film a “reboot” and plans to once again change people’s perceptions of what a superhero movie could be. With Marvel floundering just a bit and relying on big concepts like the multiverse to carve out its future, there’s potentially a lot of new genre conventions for a Kick-Ass film to satirise. Kingsman 3 Matthew Vaughn will soon be turning his attention to the promised Kingsman 3. Taron Egerton is set to return as Eggsy to tie the trilogy up, although no news on a release date has thus far come to light. The production has been given the working title of Kingsman: The Blue Blood, and the original plan was to film in late 2022. That didn’t come to pass, however, and the Hollywood strikes inevitably hampered further attempts to get the ball rolling. Knives Out 3 After the success of Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, a murderous follow-up to Rian Johnson’s acclaimed mystery series was only a matter of time (and not just because his deal with Netflix promised the streamer two films). Filming has now started on what’s now called Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, which looks to be taking a more sinister tone than Benoit Blanc’s last couple of trips (if we were the sleuthing kind, we might deduce that’ll mean a Halloween 2025 release). Like its predecessor, Wake Up Dead Man will be heading more-or-less straight to Netflix, although it may also receive a limited run in cinemas, as Glass Onion did. The Last Starfighter 2 Here’s a surprise: a follow-up to 1984’s The Last Starfighter is finally on the way. Legal problems had held the project up, but Jonathan Betuel (who wrote the original) and Gary Whitta (who co-wrote Rogue One) are now working on a new movie. There’s some way to go before anyone agrees to pay for it to be made, but fingers crossed this one finally happens… The Last Witch Hunter 2 Here’s another surprise. It’d generally been regarded that the Vin Diesel-headlined The Last Witch Hunter was not a very successful movie. We neither remember it burning a trail at the box office or being a huge fan success. But it certainly has its collection of supporters, as Lionsgate is now reported to be in early development on a sequel. Diesel is involved in the conversations too, although it may yet be some way away. Legally Blonde 3 Reese Witherspoon will be reprising the role of Elle Woods for the first time in over 15 years for a third official Legally Blonde movie (the character didn’t feature in the direct to DVD Legally Blondes). The film had been announced for a 2020 release, but there seems to have been precious little activity on the project from what we see. Expect some soon though: MGM had planned a 2022 release, but 2023 is more likely. Lethal Weapon 5 A bit of a bolt from the blue, here. In January 2020, a project long presumed dead suddenly came back to life. Producer Dan Lin is trying to get the long-mooted Lethal Weapon 5 moving, as a farewell to the franchise. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover would return, with Richard Donner in line to direct again. The loss of Richard Donner in July 2021 is likely to have brought this project to a close, but that’s not been confirmed. Still, it’s hard to see the key creatives wanting to work with a different director on it. The Lion King 2 This one’s definitely pressing ahead at Disney, and Moonlight director Barry Jenkins is helming the new movie. Expect it to tell some of the backstory to the original movie, and feature a whole host of new songs too. It’s titled Mufasa: The Lion King, and comes to cinemas in July 2024. Live Die Repeat And Repeat Tom Cruise’s crowded schedule has thus far pushed back the Edge Of Tomorrow sequel, that director Doug Liman has confirmed will be called Live Die Repeat And Repeat. Christopher McQuarrie is expected to be on screenplay duties, but both Cruise and McQuarrie are making two Mission: Impossible films back to back first. Live Die Repeat And Repeat thus has to take its place in the queue. Lord Of War 2 Nicolas Cage is booked and busy at the moment, and now it’s confirmed that he’s returning for a sequel to 2005 war film Lord Of War. It’ll be written and directed once again by Andrew Niccol, and Cage will be reprising the role of Yuri Orlov, a character based on multiple real life arms dealers. The follow-up, titled Lords Of War, will also feature Bill Skarsgard as Orlov’s son. No release date for this yet, but it certainly sounds interesting. M3gan 2 Killer doll movie M3gan has taken the horror world by storm, being released to rave reviews. Writer Akela Cooper has confirmed that we’ll be getting a gorier, unrated cut of the film at some point, and now a sequel has been confirmed. Development is underway, but it’s currently in the very early stages. Akela Cooper is returning to write the second instalment, and producers are hoping that director Gerard Johnstone will also return. Expect it to come out at some point in 2025. Mallrats 2 Kevin Smith has resurrected his plans for a Mallrats sequel, and is working on a screenplay for the film, that he’ll also direct. This is separate from the once-planned and abandoned MallBrats movie of a few years’ back. Expect the core cast all back. A possible 2020 start date was on the cards. No sign of it yet though, two years on. Midnight Run 2 Here’s a surprise. The 1988 buddy road movie Midnight Run starred Robert De Niro and the late Charles Grodin. De Niro is returning to produce a big screen follow-up (overlooking the three sequels that were made for television). Regina Hall – who’ll be producing as well – is the only announced cast member for the belated sequel at this stage though. But it’s definitely happening. Mission: Impossible 8 The original plan was to shoot Mission Impossible 7 and 8 back to back, but that isn’t, unfortunately, how it’s turned out. Much of Dead Reckoning Part Two was shot throughout 2022, but now it seems the film remains incomplete amid the SAG-AFTRA strike. Christopher McQuarrie, who has helmed the last two chapters in the franchise, is back to write and direct the film. The release of Dead Reckoning Part One in July 2023 has left us on a bit of a cliffhanger, and now Part Two (which likely won’t be called Part Two after the previous film’s performance at the box office) has been delayed into 2025. Moana 2 Once fated to debut as a TV spin-off on Disney Plus, Bob Iger announced the studio’s expansion of the Moana-verse was being reworked into a feature film in February 2024. Due for a theatrical release on 27th November, the film finds our heroine receiving an unexpected call from her wayfinding ancestors and journeying to the far seas of Oceania for an adventure unlike anything she’s ever faced, according to the press release. My Spy 2 The Dave Bautista-starring family comedy My Spy is getting a sequel, with the original cast and creative team returning. Bautista, Chloe Coleman, Kristen Schaal and Ken Jeong are back for the next instalment, alongside new recruits Anna Faris, Craig Robinson and Flula Borg. Peter Segal will once again direct, and writers Jon and Erich Hoeber are back on board. Segal is also contributing to the story and screenplay. The movie is said to go into production ‘soon’, but we don’t know anything more at the moment. The Myth 2 Jackie Chan is showing no signs of slowing down, and he’s currently in production on a sequel to his 2005 action adventure film The Myth. The first movie saw his take on two roles, one an ancient warrior and the other his modern-day reincarnation. Stanley Tong, who directed the film, is attached to the sequel as a writer, and it’s understood that Gülnezer Bextiyar will star in it alongside Chan. New(er) Police Story In 2004, the Police Story franchise got a soft reboot with New Police Story, and now star Jackie Chan has announced a sequel. He will be both producing and starring, and Nicholas Tse, who co-starred in the first movie, will be making his directorial debut. Nobody 2 Bob Odenkirk is set to return in the sequel to 2021’s surprise action hit. Derek Kolstad is returning to pen the script alongside Aaron Rabin, Odenkirk and Umair Aleem, and The Night Comes for Us director Timo Tjahjanto is set to take the reigns of the franchise. Universal are expected to release the film on 15th August 2025. Now You See Me 3 A sequel that was presumed to have been abandoned, Lionsgate is pressing ahead with its plan for a third Now You See Me movie. The plan this time will be to bring new cast members in, whilst offering a return to the likes of Jessie Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson from the original cast. Eric Warren Singer has been hired to write the screenplay for the new film, but no director or release date has been set as of yet. The Old Guard 2 Charlize Theron returns for a sequel to the Netflix hit The Old Guard, along with KiKi Layne, Matthias Schoenaerts, Marwan Kenzari, Luca Marinelli, Veronica Ngo and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Victoria Mahoney steps into the director’s chair this time. Greg Rucka is on scribbling duties, based on his comic books. Uma Thurman and Henry Golding were also recently added to the cast. Paddington In Peru Particularly good news following 2017’s quite wonderful Paddington 2 – we’re getting another one! Less good news: co-writer/director Paul King won’t be behind the camera for this one, taking on an executive producer role on the production instead. However, stepping into his shoes is Dougal Wilson, making his feature directorial debut. The title has also been revealed as Paddington In Peru. Despite the SAG-AFTRA strike, filming kicked off in July 2023 as planned as the film is a British production. It now has a release date, too, with the movie coming to UK cinemas on 8th November 2024. The US is getting it a bit later on 17th January 2025. Passion Of The Christ: Resurrection Mel Gibson’s film The Passion Of The Christ remains one of the most successful independent movies ever made. He’s hired Braveheart writer Randall Wallace to pen the script for the film, and Jim Caviezel is once again expected to play Christ. A rough release date of 2021 had been mooted, with Gibson directing again. We’re still waiting, though. Paw Patrol: The Movie 3 The Paw Patrol movies have been proving quite popular, and news of a third movie being greenlit has arrived. No news on what the story will be, but the last one saw the main characters turn into superheroes called The Mighty Pups, so there’s a lot of room for creativity there. Cal Brunker is once again set to direct, with 31st July 2026 penciled in as the release date. Sequel Of The Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes When Disney acquired Fox in 2019, the studio began working on a sequel to the Planet Of The Apes reboot trilogy. Titled Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes, the film attached Maze Runner filmmaker Wes Ball to direct, and was envisioned as the first part of a new trilogy in the long-running simian franchise, following the adventures of Kingdom’s new protagonist, Noa. The Princess Diaries 3 Yet another sequel that Disney currently has in the works. The Princess Diaries films, led by Anne Hathaway, are beloved teen rom-coms from the early 2000s. Now it seems that screenwriter Aadrita Mukerji is working on a script for a third instalment. It’s said to be a continuation of Hathaway’s films, not a reboot or remake, and while Hathaway isn’t attached to return yet, she’s often said she’d be willing to play Mia Thermopolis again. This is another one that may or may not materialise, but at the moment it sounds promising. A Quiet Place 3 This one isn’t a direct sequel to the Emily Blunt and John Krasinski-starring originals, but a prequel set in (you guessed it) day one of the apocalypse. It will focus on different characters, played by Stranger Things’ Joseph Quinn and Lupita Nyong’o. Pig’s Michael Sarnoski is in the director’s chair. This one is expected in cinemas on 28th June 2024. Red Notice 2 and 3 Netflix was so happy with the performance of the Gal Gadot, Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds globe-trotting action adventure Red Notice that it wants more. Two more, in fact. It wants Red Notice 2 and Red Notice 3 to shoot back to back, starting in early 2023. Rawson Marshall Thurber will be back to write and direct as well. The first of the films is likely to be ready for the end of 2024 at the earliest. Red State 2 In the wake of the release of Clerks III, Kevin Smith seems set to follow up another of his movies – 2011’s Red State. A sequel was previously impossible because of some pesky rights issues (Lionsgate had trouble contacting the copyright holders), but it now seems they’ve become more responsive as time has passed and plans for a sequel are back on track. While Michael Parks, who appeared in the original film, passed away in 2017, Kevin Smith is eager to push forward – especially if he can get John Goodman to return. Repo Man 2: The Wages Of Beer Alex Cox is making an unexpected return to the cult film he made 40 years ago. The sequel is said to pick up immediately after Cox’s delightfully left-field 1984 film, though given how long it’s been since that came out – and that co-star Harry Dean Stanton has sadly passed away since – makes us wonder how. At the time of writing in February 2024, Cox is still getting financing together for the sequel, so it’s still in its early stages. Riddick 4 After a long wait, it’s finally been confirmed that a fourth film in the Riddick series – officially named Riddick: Furya – is in the works. Vin Diesel and writer/director David Twohy are teaming up once again for this sequel that will see anti-hero Riddick return to his home world of Furya. We don’t know which foe his will face just yet, but it’s confirmed not to be the Necromongers that served as the antagonists in Chronicles Of Riddick. Road House 2 After the success of Prime Video’s Road House, the streamer has quickly greenlit a sequel. Jake Gyllenhaal is set to reprise his role as hard-as-nails former MMA fighter Elwood Dalton, but no news on who else might star in the film. No news on a director either, but consider Doug Liman was very vocal he wanted Road House to get a cinema release, describing it as a “war with Amazon”, we’re not sure he’ll be back. RoboCop Returns Following the template set by Terminator: Dark Fate (which isn’t likely to get a sequel), RoboCop Returns will ignore the plotline of the sequels it didn’t like, and instead, it’ll pick things up after the original 1987 classic. Neill Blomkamp (District 9) was set to direct, but moved onto another project. Then filmmaker Abe Forsythe stepped in, but he’s now left, too. With Amazon now owning the RoboCop rights and a TV series and film planned (entirely separate from RoboCop Returns) it’s looking increasingly as though this particular parrot is dead.\n\nRead more: Whatever happened to RoboCop Returns?\n\nAdvertisements\n\nSuggested product\n\nRock Sound Issue 295.1 - L.S. Dunes Poster Pack\n\nStaff pick\n\n£10.99\n\nSuggested product\n\nTwenty One Pilots: The Return To London Magazine (Album Not Included)\n\n£11.99\n\nThe Rocketeer 2 A film mooted a while back, The Rocketeers is set to follow-on from the much-loved 1991 movie, with the plan being for it to be a direct sequel rather than an outright reboot. Azia Squire was penning the script. Now we learn though that David Oyelowo is to produce and likely star in a new Rocketeer movie. No director as of yet, just that it’s happening, and Disney+ will be its home. Rocky 7 Sylvester Stallone wants one more round after the last one last round and the last one last round for Rocky Balboa. He reckons he’s got an idea for a new film, and that the studio is keen is on it too. The new film will have a political edge, and it’s got Stallone’s interest more than reappearing as Rocky in Creed 3. No word yet on when to expect it, and if it’s been officially greenlit. RRR 2 One of 2022’s unexpected breakout films, RRR is an over-three-hour-long extravaganza of action, musical numbers and stunt work. Now it’s been announced that writer V Vijayendra Prasad and director S. S. Rajamouli are working on a follow-up. The father and son team admit that they’re only in the very early stages of development, but they do have a story idea. This may take some time to come out, but in the meantime RRR is available on Netflix. Samaritan 2 (2amaritan?) In 2022’s Samaritan, Sylvester Stallone played a retired superhero that most of the world believed to be dead. Young boy Sam believes differently, and turns out to be right. It started out as an interesting film that focused on its characters – at least in the first half. Amazon has been happy enough with the viewing numbers that it’s now developing a sequel that will again star Stallone. He’s also co-producing through Balboa Productions. We don’t yet know anything about the story or whether Julius Avery will return to direct, but Samaritan screenwriter Bragi G Schut is coming back to pen the sequel. We can expect this to land on Prime Video when it’s ready for release. Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark 2 A sequel to the $100m+ global horror hit is on the way. Andre Ovredal is returning to direct, with Dan Hageman and Kevin Hageman likewise on scripting duties again. Guillermo del Toro is coming up with the story for this one, presumably based on Alvin Schwartz’s source novels. No timescales as of yet, but we’ll keep you posted… Scream 7 After Scream VI took the action to the big city, yet another slasher sequel has been given the green light. Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillet, AKA directing duo Radio Silence, are stepping away from this one, with Happy Death Day director Christopher Landon initially taking the reigns before the whole project seemingly imploded with the exit of Melissa Barrera, Jenna Ortega and Landon all within a few weeks of each other. After a few months of meddling, long-time Scream scribe Kevin Williamson was brought on to direct, with Neve Campbell returning to the franchise that made her name after her controversial absence from the last film. This one was originally slated for release in 2024, but with all the behind-the-scenes drama, that’s looking incredibly unlikely at the moment. The Sea Beast 2 One of the films Netflix quietly released in 2022 was The Sea Beast. A beautiful animated film with plenty of heart and full of fun, the streaming service claims it’s now the most-watched animated film on the platform. Unexpectedly then, a sequel is in the works. Chris Williams, who directed and co-wrote the first film, has a deal with Netflix that means he’ll also be helming The Sea Beast 2. We’re excited for this. Shaolin Women’s Soccer Writer/producer/director Steven Chow became internationally known for his 2001 feature film Shaolin Soccer, which blended the martial arts movie with the sports comedy. Over 20 years later, it seems that Chow’s interested in revisiting that concept with a sequel. Titled Shaolin Women’s Soccer, it’s been reported that Chow is now looking for female leads of the film. It’s very early days at the moment, so there’s no word on when this will enter production, but it’s exciting news. Sherlock Holmes 3 It’s taken a long, long time to get this far, but a third Sherlock Holmes adventure – starring Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law – was finally set to go before the cameras in 2020. Covid, though, has put the film on hold for the time being until all concerned can work out how to shoot it. Dexter Fletcher is set to take over from Guy Ritchie as director. Shrek 5 Rumours that DreamWorks were eyeing up a new Shrek film have been swirling for a while, but it wasn’t until Eddie Murphy let slip that he’d recorded dialogue for the project in June 2024 that we got something close to official confirmation. Apparently, it’ll be out in 2025. He also mentioned a Donkey movie, but didn’t have many more details than that. Sister Act 3 Whoopi Goldberg will be getting back in the habit (sorry) for a third Sister Act film, that has been greenlit by Disney. It’ll be heading to the Disney+ service rather than getting a theatrical premiere. Still in the early days this one though, but it’s definitely happening, and is due towards the end of 2022. Smile 2 Smile was one of 2022’s cinematic successes, and a bold original horror film. Originally planned for a streaming release, Paramount changed its mind at the last minute, and was undoubtedly glad about it given its box office success. Now, the studio has inked a multi-film deal with Smile's director Parker Finn, who has previously said he’s got some ideas for the direction of a potential sequel. Nothing official yet, but things are looking promising. Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse 3 The Oscar-winning animated favourite – surely in the running for the best Spider-Man movie to date – is getting another sequel to end the trilogy. Spider-Man: Beyond The Spider-Verse was originally set for an early 2024 release, but after the Across The Spider-Verse came out there were rumblings that the animation was nowhere near done. In August 2023 we heard that the film has indeed been delayed, and so far there’s no replacement release date. That’s partially a good thing, though, as it hopefully allows the movie’s animators to put their best work into the film without feeling an overwhelming amount of pressure. Sonic 3 After the success of Sonic 2, Paramount and Sega have announced a third film in the series. There’s no release date or story information yet, but well keep you posted. Talk 2 Me Independent Aussie horror film Talk To Me has been somewhat of a surprise hit. Directed by Michael and Danny Philipphou, AKA YouTube duo RackaRacka, the film sees a group of teens play ill-advised games with an embalmed hand that allows them to speak with the dead. The box office returns and great word of mouth means that a sequel, titled Talk 2 Me, is already in the works. Both Philipphou brothers will return to direct, and Danny will write the screenplay with Bill Hinzman. The brothers have previously said that they have ideas for more films – including a prequel – so perhaps those ideas will make their way into this movie.\n\nRead more: Talk To Me review | Tantalising teen horror\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: More Mutant Mayhem With its artsy animation style and fun protagonists, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem has been very positively reviewed (here’s ours, featuring five stars!). In fact, it’s gone down so well that Paramount has already booked in a sequel for 9th October 2026 – and a TV series for streaming that will bridge the gap between movies. A notable cartoon character that was missing from the movie is the antagonist known as Shredder. Perhaps we’ll get to see him in action in the next film. Terrifier 3 2022’s Terrifier 2 saw huge success after word spread of the film’s vile nature, with people reportedly fainting in cinemas. That’s a pretty good reputation for a horror movie to have, and as such a third film is in the works. While the second instalment was low budget, it’s going to be increasing significantly for the next outing, into low-mid seven figures. Writer and director Damien Leone and producer Phil Falcone are returning, as well as lead actors David Thornton and Lauren LaVera. Production is set to begin this year for a mid-2024 release. Toy Story 5 Another recently announced Disney sequel is a fifth Toy Story movie. We have little to no details on this, except that it’s happening, but it’ll be interesting to see where they take the story – especially given the ending of Toy Story 4. Tron Ares Rumours of a sequel to Joseph Kosinski’s Tron: Legacy have been circulating for some time, but the project has been seemingly stuck in development. Now, the film, titled Tron Ares, is moving ahead, with Jared Leto starring and Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil's Joachim Ronning is in talks to direct. Tron Ares was set to start filming in August 2023, but that’s been delayed by strike action on the part of writers and actors. Twister 2 Amblin and Universal are said to be on the hunt for a director to helm a big budget sequel to 1996’s Twister (called, believe it or not, Twisters). Top Gun: Maverick director Joseph Kosinski was originally attached, but pulled out to instead helm a Brad Pitt-led Formula One movie for Apple. Frank Marshall is producing, and the script has been written by The Revenant's Mark L. Smith. It’s a screenplay that was reportedly loved by Steven Spielberg himself, which is what drummed up enough excitement to fast-track the film’s production. Munari director Lee Isaac Chung has stepped up to helm this one. Daisy Edgar-Jones, Glen Powell and Anthony Ramos are set to star, with a release date locked in for 19th July 2024. Vacation Friends 2 John Cena, Lil Rel Howery, Yvonne Orji and Meredith Hagner are all set to return for Vacation Friends 2, following the original film’s successful launch on the Disney+ Star service in the summer of 2021. Clay Tarver is set to come back behind the camera again, and it’s a fair assumption that it’ll again debut directly on streaming. Violent Night 2 David Harbour shook up the festive season of 2022 when he played a surprisingly violent Santa Claus in action-comedy Violent Night. The movie may have been up against James Cameron’s Avatar: The Way Of Water, but it’s still been a great success for Universal. The producers have recently announced a follow-up, with director Tommy Wirkola also returning. The team are still getting their ideas together right now, but we could see some more traditional Christmas-related things in the sequel, like the North Pole, Mrs Claus, or the elves. Wedding Crashers 2 A project that had been mooted around the time of the 2005 original, the Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson-headlined comedy hit Wedding Crashers may be finally getting a follow-up. Director David Dobkin, along with Vaughn and Wilson, have been in very recent talks over a new film, and it looks as though this one’s back on the radar. Nothing concrete yet, but it appears alive… Wind River 2 A follow-up is being made to Taylor Sheridan’s 2017 neo-Western Wind River. It doesn’t seem to have too much in common with the first film, but it is called Wind River: The Next Chapter. Martin Sensmeier is the only returning cast member, and Jason Clarke, Scott Eastwood and Chaske Spencer are joining him. The Falcon And The Winter Soldier helmer Kari Skogland is directing. Filming is already underway in Canada. X 3 (Maxxxine) With horror director Ti West’s X receiving critical acclaim, it’s now set to get a sequel. Pearl, the prequel exploring the origins of Mia Goth’s murderous character from the first film, will be followed by Maxxxine – again starring Goth. The sole survivor of X's events, Maxine will be continuing her journey towards fame, trying to make it as an actress in 1980s Los Angeles. Filming apparently wrapped in May 2023, and is due in UK cinemas on 5th July. Zootropolis 2 Zootropolis (or Zootopia, if you’re in the US) was a really interesting addition to Disney’s animated filmography. A kind of buddy cop mystery-thriller led by aspiring policewoman Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) and conman Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), the unlikely pair teamed up to create a very memorable movie. The only thing we know about the sequel is that it’s happening, but there’s plenty Disney could do with these characters. 47 Ronin 2 Currently linked to Netflix, the project is being helmed by Lucifer star Aimee Garcia and author AJ Mendez who are in the process of writing the script, with Mulan director Carl Rinsch set to direct. The 2013 film was considered a flop at the box office, focussing on ‘a fictionalized account of the titular 47 Rōnin, a real-life group of samurai in the 18th century who set out to avenge the death of their master who was killed by a merciless shogun.’ It is unlikely any of the original stars will return, the sequel is currently set to focus on powerful female leads.\n\nLead image: BigStock\n\n— Thank you for visiting!
