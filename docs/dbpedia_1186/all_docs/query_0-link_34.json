        "text": "THE GHOST WITH THE MOST IS BACK.\n\nBeetlejuice is back! Oscar-nominated, singular creative visionary Tim Burton and Oscar nominee and star Michael Keaton reunite for Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, the long-awaited sequel to Burton’s award-winning Beetlejuice.\n\nAfter an unexpected family tragedy, three generations of the Deetz family return home to Winter River. Still haunted by Beetlejuice, Lydia’s life is turned upside down when her rebellious teenage daughter, Astrid, discovers the mysterious model of the town in the attic and the portal to the Afterlife is accidentally opened. With trouble brewing in both realms, it’s only a matter of time until someone says Beetlejuice’s name three times and the mischievous demon returns to unleash his very own brand of mayhem.\n\nAbout Us:\n\nNOTICE: Change of Ownership\n\nHello Morro Bay! Your beloved Bay Theatre is undergoing a change in ownership, as many of you may have heard. The new owners, The Wilsons, are a family of film lovers and California natives with forty-year ties to the central coast. Morro Bay has always been a beautiful destination for visiting and vacationing, and we are so happy to call it home now!\n\nMary Lou and the Jannopoulos family have dedicated nearly fifty years of service and hard work to keep this place functioning and beautiful for its loyal patrons, and we are incredibly grateful to be taking over such a well-loved and cared-for local institution.\n\nWe will continue to work with the Jannopoulos’ in our best effort to maintain the quality and value of the theater experience exactly as you have enjoyed it here for decades. Hopefully any changes made will only be noticed for the better of your enjoyment and not felt in your wallets!\n\nThank you for your support and come in and say Hi!\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe Bay Theatre has been family owned and operated since 1975. The building was constructed in the early 1940’s as a single screen motion picture theatre. The Jannopoulos family has maintained the historical integrity and charm of the building while pursuing their efforts to maintain and improve the physical and technical aspects of this landmark.\n\nThe most recent improvement has been the installation of a state of the art digital projection and sound system. We are proud to be the beneficiaries of Ultra Stereo of San Luis Obispo’s generosity, who donated to us, a digital sound processor and an assisted listening system, which includes not only sound amplification but also, closed captioning and visual narration capabilities.\n\nOur family invites you and your family to enjoy your next night out at the movies, with us, at the Bay Theatre in beautiful downtown Morro Bay, California\n\nWe are proud members of Theatre Historical Society of America historictheatres.org"
