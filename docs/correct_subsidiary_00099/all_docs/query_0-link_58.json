        "text": "Today is a special moment for me, as it is my first Fourth of July as a U.S. citizen...something I'm incredibly proud of. This Fourth of July, I want to take a moment to honor the courage, resilience, and determination of those who fight and have fought for our freedom. I also want to recognize our organization, as every day, our Verizon Business Public Sector and Verizon Frontline teams work tirelessly to serve those who protect and support our freedom. We are proud to serve the 30,000+ public safety agencies and proud of the work in the federal government space. Wishing you all a happy and safe Fourth of July! #Freedom #FourthofJuly #VerizonBusiness #Verizon #IndependenceDay\n\nAnother fantastic event by TechUnited. It was great being back at the Propelify Innovation Festival in Hoboken, NJ where I had the opportunity to take the stage with Yasmin Gagne to discuss topics including: - The changing face of the C-Suite: CIOs and CTOs have more influence than ever before. - AI and tech access: The barrier to entry for SMBs and entrepreneurs to leverage technology like AI and develop innovative solutions at the edge is getting lower -- this access is changing the face of the business landscape for the better. - Be a technologist: From large enterprises to entrepreneurs working out of their homes, everyone needs to become smart on tech. Be a student of business -- CEOs continue to bolster their knowledge of tech, and CIOs and CTOs are driving tech adoption -- which means we have to be technologists...this knowledge lifts up organizations. Thank you, Aaron Price Jasmine Ward Denise Lauria, PMP, CMP, and the TechUnited team. It was great seeing the team out at the Verizon Business booth.

The evolution of the global business landscape is astounding. What has remained unchanged is our commitment to our customers and the people that they serve…ultimately, our mission is to empower people to have a better life. The foundation that makes up the name Verizon. “Veritas” – certainty/reliability “Horizon” – forward-looking and visionary Today, the debut of our new-look branding not only signifies a milestone moment for us as a business but celebrates who we are and how far we’ve come. For Enterprise and Public Sector organizations globally, Verizon Business has been and will continue to be your trusted partner. A group that focuses on reliability and the certainty that we will show up when it matters most. A forward-looking group, looking at the horizon for what’s possible for your business. It’s an exciting day that marks the next chapter for Verizon. #Verizon #NextChapter #VTeam #ForwardTogether #VerizonBusiness #Enterprise #PublicSector https://lnkd.in/ejD-TDmv\n\nSpent a few days in EMEA this week visiting our teams, customers, and partners in Stockholm and London. I feel incredibly energized after being with this world-class sales/support team. A few key takeaways from the visit: 1. Security is front and center. Protecting sensitive information continues to be a hot-button topic no matter who you talk to or where you visit. 2. AI, AI, and more AI. The intense focus and curiosity on AI from a security, governance, operational efficiency, and implementation standpoint are there. As I discussed on CNBC Squawbox Europe (https://bit.ly/3RFCPvv) while in London, Verizon Business is a great enabler of AI. Companies and agencies need to have the ability to synthesize massive amounts of data, sitting on the edge, and get actionable insights in real time. That’s where connectivity is vital. 3. The Great Network Renaissance. When talking about security, AI, edge computing, and 5G, organizations are focusing their attention on the power of the network. As stated with AI, none of this technological innovation can happen without the ability to process this information. In comes the vital role of the network. 4. Changing conversation of the C-Suite. European business leaders (many leaders around the globe) have a deeper understanding of technology – not just what it is, but how it can benefit their organizations. CIOs and CTOs are increasingly influential at the highest levels of an organization and it’s changing the narrative. 5. Customer experience is a must. Organizations want amazing customer experience and want us to help them create a great customer experience for those they serve. Congratulations to our EMEA All-In Award winners, Georgina Fraser, Philip Stringer, and Steven Gevers. And a big congratulations to Giuseppe Mocci for being recognized for his outstanding work with a Verizon Business Spotlight Award. And a big thank you to Tony Judd, John Williams, Drew Moss, Kathryn Barlow, Chrissy Desbonne, Lauren Januszewski, Anna Söderqvist, Sinead Burns, Mithun Hariharan, PMP, Kyle Ragonese, Louisa Rowntree, Sebrina Kepple and our Hub leaders in Frankfurt, Reading, Paris, Milan, Dortmund, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Brussels and everyone who made this trip and our first all-EMEA webcast possible. #Verizon #VerizonBusiness #Enterprise #VTeam #AllIn #AI #Cybersecurity #CX #Connectivity Scott M. Lawrence Debika Bhattacharya Tom Zimmerman Daniel Lawson Sanjiv Gossain\n\nLast night, Verizon Business and presenting sponsor, Samsung Electronics, took center stage at Radio City Music Hall for the Verizon Business Innovation Sessions event. What a spectacular venue and outstanding discussions all centered around innovation and the power of partnership and connectivity. We heard from several guest speakers, but a few things struck me from Phil Wiser, Chief Technology Officer at Paramount, and Joseph Inzerillo, EVP, Chief Product and Technology Officer at SiriusXM. - Technology will continue to disrupt traditional models in the Entertainment industry and enable people to create their own experiences at home, in the car, and everywhere. - #Cloud and #AI are key components to driving industry-wide change, and the network, in this instance, Verizon's 5G network, is the enabler. - Innovation begins with envisioning new models to create a distinct experience in every aspect of people's lives with #5G turning visions into reality. To those in attendance, keep thinking big, and to everyone else, keep an innovative mindset. I'd love to hear where you think the next big innovation will come from in your industry. #Innovation #VerizonBusinessInnovationSession #Enterprise #SMBs #NewYork Jennifer Artley | Scott M.

Their courage and dedication are the foundation upon which our freedoms are built. While you're spending time with family and friends, I encourage everyone to take a moment to reflect on the meaning of Memorial Day. Additionally, I want to thank all of those V Teamers who currently serve and have served in our armed forces and our Verizon Business Public Sector team, who work tirelessly to support our heroes.\n\nIt's an honor that you trust Verizon Business to deliver for your business. We are a global organization and no matter what country or continent you work out of, we are there for you every step of your journey. It's our mission. Your success is our success. It's why we work so hard...as part of your team. Customer appreciation isn't something dedicated to a day on the calendar...it's 365 days a year...but since this happens to be Customer Appreciation Day we want to say a special \"thank you\" for your business. #CustomerAppreciationDay #VerizonThanksYou #ForwardTogether"
