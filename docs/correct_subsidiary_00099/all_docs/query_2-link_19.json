        "text": "More Information on Cisco Investor Relations\n\nCisco Systems 1998 AnnualReport\n\nCisco Systems Second Quarter Earnings\n\nCisco Systems First Quarter Earnings\n\nCisco Systems Fourth Quarter Earnings\n\nSAN JOSE, California -- May 11, 1999 -- Cisco Systems, Inc., the worldwide leader in networking for the Internet, today reported its third quarter results for the period ending May 1, 1999.\n\nNet sales for the third quarter were $3.15 billion, compared with $2.18 billion for the same period last year, an increase of 44%. Net income was $646 million or $0.38 per share, compared with pro forma net income of $484 million or $0.30 per share for the third quarter of 1998, increases of 33% and 27%, respectively.\n\nNet sales for the first nine months of 1999 were $8.56 billion compared with $6.07 billion for the same period last year, an increase of 41%. Pro forma net income was $1.81 billion or $1.08 per share, compared with pro forma net income of $1.36 billion or $0.85 per share for the first nine months of 1998, increases of 33% and 27%, respectively.\n\nActual net income for the first nine months of 1999 was $1.45 billion or $0.86 per share, compared with $859 million or $0.54 per share in 1998.\n\nThe company's board of directors authorized the splitting of Cisco's common stock on a two-for-one basis for shareholders of record on May 24, 1999. Shares resulting from the split are expected to be distributed by the transfer agent on June 21, 1999. This action will be the eighth time that Cisco's stock has been split since the company's initial public offering in February 1990. Two-for-one stock splits occurred in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1996; and a three-for-two split occurred in 1997 and 1998.\n\n\"The Internet Economy continues to create unprecedented growth opportunities for people, companies, and countries on a global basis,\" said John Chambers, president and CEO of Cisco Systems. \"The New World of integrated data, voice, and video communications is at the center of these opportunities.\"\n\nCisco continues to advance its end-to-end Internet solutions in each of its key markets.\n\nCisco expanded its New World technology offerings into messaging and call center solutions for both enterprise and service provider customers, underscoring its commitment to unify voice and Internet communications. In support of this strategy to enable open platforms for third-party application developers, Cisco announced it will acquire GeoTel Communications and Amteva Technologies. Both acquisitions bring advanced voice technologies to New World networks and broaden Cisco's technology portfolio for partners.\n\nIn the enterprise space, Cisco continued to increase acceptance of its Internet solutions and advance its market leadership in local-area network (LAN) switching. Cisco furthered its Gigabit Ethernet strategy with the introduction of the Catalyst. 4900 series switch, which allows customers to deploy end-to-end gigabit solutions. Strengthening its enterprise position, Cisco significantly increased its market leadership in Layer 3 switching due to broad acceptance of the Catalyst 8500, 6000, and 5000 families of switches.\n\nIn the service provider marketplace there continues to be increased acceptance of the New World strategy. Reinforcing its commitment to IP+ATM networks, Cisco began volume shipments of the MGX 8800 wide-area switch and announced the acquisition of Sentient Networks. To broaden its access portfolio, Cisco announced the acquisition of Fibex Systems and introduced the ISR 3303 access platform from the PipeLinks acquisition. Both solutions allow service providers to take advantage of the New World architecture while continuing to offer traditional voice services over existing infrastructure. Motorola and Cisco announced a strategic alliance to deliver a New World framework for Internet-based wireless networks.\n\nIn the small and medium-sized marketplace, Cisco, along with two dozen partners launched the Cisco Hosted Applications Initiative to help small and medium-sized businesses take advantage of sophisticated applications that were previously unavailable to them. Internet- hosted applications can be rapidly deployed with minimal technical support.\n\nOther highlights this quarter include Cisco's alliance with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to use the Internet to help eradicate extreme poverty in the world's poorest nations. The NET AID initiative uses the power of the Internet as the primary communication device to educate and mobilize the world's people around this global problem. For the first time, the Internet will join forces with world-renowned producers and promoters including Harvey Goldsmith, Ken Kragen, Don Mischer and Jeff Pollack along with the world's top entertainers for three simultaneous concerts to bring awareness to this issue. The web site for NET AID is expected to receive more than 1 billion hits and will serve as the on-going information resource to help bring an end to extreme poverty.\n\n\"Cisco is helping to create a world free of borders where the Internet will provide equal opportunities for all people on a worldwide basis. The NET AID project is just one example of how the power of the Internet has the potential to accomplish the seemingly impossible and change our lives in a very positive and meaningful way,\" concluded Chambers.\n\nCisco Systems\n\nCisco Systems, Inc.
