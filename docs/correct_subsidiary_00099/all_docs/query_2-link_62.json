        "text": "Executive Summary\n\nSmart Grid Overview\n\nFigure 1-1 Smart Grid Ecosystem\n\nThe smart grid is a combination of the electric power grid and the associated information and communications technology (ICT) designed to efficiently delivering sustainable, economic, and secure electricity supplies. This renders the power delivery chain observable, controllable, automated, and integrated, thus providing complete awareness and control of the grid state, the ability to adapt to rapidly changing conditions without human intervention where possible, and enabling the interaction of the grid devices, systems, and business processes to yield the optimal business value.\n\nSome of the smart grid applications are intelligent transmission and distribution, distributed generation, distribution automation, advanced metering infrastructure, and demand response. This document addresses the advanced metering infrastructure in particular.\n\nFigure 1-1 depicts the major components of the smart grid ecosystem, from the power generation center up to the customers, along with the network control center, which provides a monitoring and control system for the smart grid. Electric energy is transported on high-voltage lines since the line losses are much smaller than with low-voltage lines. Grid architectures in Europe and other parts of the world have secondary substations that condition the power from medium voltage (1000V to 35kV) to low voltage (up to 1000V) for use by homes and businesses. These substation huts can be located underground or above ground and, in some instances, on pole tops. In North America, the pole-top transformer is used to condition the power for consumer or commercial use.\n\nCisco Connected Utilities\n\nThe Cisco Connected Utilities program brings together IP-based solutions to cater to the growing needs of the energy industry. These solutions are secure, scalable, and flexible, are based on open standards, and aim to accommodate multiple services by leveraging common infrastructure.\n\nThe energy industry is rapidly evolving in size and complexity. Utilities are now focused on grid modernization to optimize the power supply chain. Smart meters, grid sensors, advanced distribution automation, substation automation, wide area measurements, etc. are proliferating in this area, typically known as operational technology (OT). The Cisco Smart Grid solution enables grid modernization and maximizes business outcomes by providing an end-to-end, IP-based reference architecture—from data centers responsible for grid operations to homes and industries. Information technology integrates with the Operations Technology of the utilities to manage these complex advanced systems while meeting security and regulatory requirements.\n\nSubstation Automation and Field Area Networks (FANs) are the two programs under Cisco Connected Utilities. This document is the Cisco Validated Design (CVD) for Field Area Network 2.0; a separate CVD for Substation Automation 2.0 is available.\n\nThe Cisco Grid Blocks architecture (as depicted in Figure 1-2) provides a framework for integrating the end-to-end electrical grid to deliver a highly secure and reliable communications infrastructure. This modular approach allows projects to be implemented over time, leveraging existing infrastructure, while building toward a strategic, forward-looking architecture. Each grid block module offers specific design guidance for deploying applications and solutions as a part of a grid modernization roadmap.\n\nThis document provides the design and implementation guidelines for urban and rural FANs and for residential and commercial Neighborhood Area Networks (indicated in red).\n\nFigure 1-2 Cisco Smart Grid Reference Model\n\nMulti-Services Field Area Network\n\nFigure 1-3 Field Area Network Overview\n\nThe Field Area Network (FAN) is the communication network overlay for the electric distribution grid (as shown in Figure 1-3). The Cisco vision for the smart grid multi-services Field Area Network (FAN) is to help enable pervasive monitoring and control of energy distribution networks to enhance energy delivery. The Cisco multi-services FAN solution is based on a flexible two-tier architecture that provides IP network services such as security, quality of service, resilience, and management. When deployed, the Cisco FAN network is capable of supporting use cases such as Advanced Metering Infrastructure, Distribution Automation, work force automation, Electric Vehicles, Distributed Generation and Storage, and Street Lighting (see Figure 1-4). This document provides the design and implementation guidelines for the Advanced Metering Infrastructure in particular.\n\nFigure 1-4 Multi-Services FAN Model\n\nThe two-tier FAN architecture (as represented in Figure 1-3) that provides the communication network for the Smart Grid consists of the following:\n\nThe Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) that interconnects a range of devices such as smart meters, streetlights, or DA devices to a series of Field Area Routers on an RF mesh, PLC network, Ethernet, or serial interfaces such as RS232 and RS485.\n\nA Wide Area Network (WAN) that connects the Field Area Routers to the Energy Operations Center (EOC), either directly or through the substation network infrastructure.\n\nThe two tiers act as backhaul networks for a variety of other electric grid control devices, multi-tenant services (gas and water meters), and optionally data exchanges to home area network (HAN) devices.\n\nCisco’s FAN portfolio consists of the pole-top and DIN-rail mounted dual-stack Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Routers and the Connected Grid RF Mesh and PLC Mesh standards-based IPv6 reference designs to enable large scale IP connectivity for devices such as smart meters, sensors, and EV charging stations. Cisco also provides a comprehensive Connected Grid Security and Network Management Platform for providing a single end-to-end view of the IP network that can scale to millions of devices.\n\nWith the introduction of the IR509, IR809, and IR829 series Industrial Routers, the Cisco FAN solution is extended to Distribution Automation. Grid architectures in Europe and other parts of the world have secondary substations that condition the power from medium to low voltage for use by homes and businesses. These substation huts can be located underground or above ground, and in some instances, on pole tops. In these cases, the IR509, IR809, or IR829 serves as multi-service WAN router in a secondary substation to connect RTU/SCADA, concentrate metering communication, and connect to Volt/VAR controllers. However, the CG-Mesh is currently available for the 902-928MHz band (and its subsets) only, therefore the countries where the band cannot be used are outside the scope of the IR509 and CG-Mesh usage.\n\nField Area Networks are often closed, proprietary systems that generally support just a single service. As a result, they do not support interoperability across multiple vendors or take advantage of the decades of networking expertise available within the Internet Protocol suite.\n\nThe Wi-SUN ® Alliance is a global ecosystem of organizations creating interoperable wireless solutions for use in energy management and smart-utility network applications. Cisco supports the Wi-SUN alliance and is certified for the Wi-SUN 1.0 PHY profile.\n\nThe Wi-SUN defined Field Area Network is based upon the IP Protocol suite, with the initial release based on IEEE 802.15.4g PHY and 802.15.4e MAC wireless mesh technologies. Usage of the IP protocol suite provides many benefits, including the ability to support additional PHY/MAC technologies in the future.\n\nBy supporting Wi-SUN, Cisco will help drive the technical definition for standards based, multi-service, secure, and scalable Field Area Networks.\n\nAdvanced Metering Infrastructure\n\nAdvanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is the architecture for an automated, two-way communication system between a smart meter and a utility’s operational technology (OT) network. Figure 1-5 shows an overview of the AMI.\n\nAMI is an important part of any smart grid initiative. This enables the utility to obtain real-time data about power consumption and allows customers to make informed choices about energy usage based on the price at the time of use.\n\nFigure 1-5 AMI Services in the FAN Ecosystem\n\nCisco has the following two solution offerings to achieve AMI functionality:\n\nA full scale head-end solution that can scale to millions of end-points such as smart meters.\n\nA small-scale, virtual head-end solution that dramatically reduces the cost, time, and complexity of head-end deployment with a pre-packaged software bundle, ideal for proof of concepts, pilot, small scale, or router-only deployments. This solution uses the Cisco Industrial Operations Kit (IOK) to provide the head-end functionality.\n\nNote This document contains the design and implementation guide for the latter.\n\nCisco collaborates with industry partners to develop solutions that integrate with Connected Grid architectures to support advanced smart grid capabilities. Devnet partners for Cisco-enabled grid endpoints include IPenable, Itron, EDMI, I-Dutto, WEG Industries, EM-Lite, Cooper Power Systems, Sistemas Tecnicos Digitais, Kamstrup, FITEC, Tatung, Incotex, Vision Metering, Elster, Grid-Sentry, GAS Sentinel, ICIL, M2M Telemetria, Tollgrade, QinetiQ, and Sentient Energy. The design specified in this document is validated with Itron Centron OpenWay Smart Meters powered by the Cisco IP communication stack and the Itron OpenWay Collection Engine for AMI application management.\n\nFigure 1-6 Advanced Metering Infrastructure Overview\n\nThe goal of AMI is to provide a means to achieve two-way communication between a smart meter and the utility network. This enables the utility to obtain real-time data about power consumption and allows customers to make informed choices about energy usage based on the price at the time of use. A smart meter is different from a legacy meter in that it is capable of two-way communication and is typically reachable by IP.\n\nMeter data reading is one of the primary applications of AMI. The following are typical AMI functions:\n\nOver the air firmware upgrades for meters.\n\nRemote connect and disconnect of power from meter to load.\n\nPower Outage Notification (PON) and Power Notification Restoration (PNR) messages from meters and the Field Area Routers (FARs).\n\nTamper notification messages from the meters.\n\nDemand Response and Pricing messages for Home Area Network (HAN) devices behind the meter, such as in-home displays, thermostats, HVAC/Water Heater/Pool Pump controllers, and so on.\n\nNetwork management tools for troubleshooting, such as ping and traceroute.\n\nNetwork device communications status and statistics.\n\nTransport network control plane messages necessary for timing distribution, neighbor discovery, IP routing updates, and so on.\n\nThe architecture provides network functionality necessary to meet the above requirements by ensuring two-way communication between the smart meters and the head-end systems.\n\nThe architecture defines a network infrastructure on which other services such as Distribution Automation and workforce management can be built, the design of which will be added in this CVD at a later stage."
