        "text": "OT authority originated with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) when the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 was enacted. Subsequently, seven other specific agencies have been given OT authority: the Department of Defense (DOD), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Department of Transportation (DOT), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Transportation Security Administration, Department of Health and Human Services, and Department of Energy. Other federal agencies may use OT authority under certain circumstances and if authorized by the Direction of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).\n\nGenerally, the reason for creating OT authority is that the government needs to obtain leading edge R&D and/or prototypes from commercial sources, but some companies (and other entities) are unwilling or unable to comply with the government’s procurement regulations. The government’s procurement regulations and certain procurement statutes do not apply to OTs, and accordingly, other transaction authority gives agencies the flexibility necessary to develop agreements tailored to a particular transaction. The Competition in Contracting Act (CICA), Contract Disputes Act, and Procurement Integrity Act are examples of three statutes that do not apply to OTs.\n\nUnder this Agreement and associated Prototype Projects, the Government, along with Consortium Member Entity(ies), performs prototype projects within the following focus areas as they relate to Military Engineering:\n\nProtective Structures and Systems, Protection and Survivability, Geophysical Sensors and data fusion, Vulnerability assessment, detection, and analytics, Geoscience, Environmental, Geospatial, and Material Modeling and simulation, Enhance and Assess Mobility of Manned and Unmanned Systems, Engineering and engineering enabling technologies, Global Access Engineering, Infrastructure Maintenance, Repair and Reconstruction Technologies, Engineering Analysis Tools and Decision Aid Prototype Software.\n\nThe scope of propulsion prototyping projects within the consortium might include any topic generally consistent with the RDT&E of propulsion systems. Mission areas of PCI 2.0 include, but are not limited to: digital engineering, artificial intelligence (AI), engine health monitoring, manufacturing base, small engines, aircraft platforms, systems, components, or materials and any integration therein. Additionally, prototyping projects could include platform electrical power systems (EPS) and thermal management systems. The scope of this effort will include, but is not limited to: Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), platform specific and common architecture studies, along with component/systems qualification and integration efforts for smart power management, higher density/higher capacity common generators, common aircraft lithium-ion batteries, flightworthy auxiliary or supplement power units, and upgraded conversion electronics.\n\nThe scope of SCCI prototyping projects might include any topic generally consistent with the Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) of 448thÂ SCMW, to include other organizations in the AFSC or strategic partners, and/or systems. That scope might extend to address aircraft platforms, systems, components, or materials and any integration therein.Â The scope furthermore could extend to, but is not limited by the following activities: sustainment, repair, and procurement of weapon system Depot Level Reparables (DLR), DLR subcomponent sourcing, predictive analytics (e.g., artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc.), alternative manufacturing methods, rapid reverse engineering, repair development, business process re-engineering (e.g., streamlining, robotic process automation, etc.), rapid problem solving (e.g. Hackathons), supply chain risk management, and use of alternate / emerging technologies to further the 448 SCMW mission.\n\nPrototypes funded through this OTA are directly relevant to enhancing the mission effectiveness of military personnel and the supporting platforms, systems, components, or materials to be acquired or developed by the Department of Defense (DoD), or to improve the platforms, systems, components, or materials in use by the armed forces.\n\nIn support of national security, the program serves as a vehicle for attracting new technologies and accelerating the research and development (R&D) cycle of basic and advanced prototypes that support resolution of NSG/ASG hard intelligence problems.Â Specifically, this program shall allow NGA and the SOSSEC Consortium to execute and coordinate efforts to plan, research, develop and utilize prototype efforts designed to allow NGA to acquire and/or use those technologies and business processes in the agency for evaluation and demonstration. The goal is to determine the value of each prototype application in solving hard intelligence problems."
