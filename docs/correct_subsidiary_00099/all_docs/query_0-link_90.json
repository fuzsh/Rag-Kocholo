BUSINESS\n\nGENERAL\n\nCertain statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\"Report\"),\n\nincluding, without limitation, statements containing the words \"believes,\"\n\n\"anticipates,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"projections,\" and words of similar\n\nimport, constitute \"forward-looking statements.\" You should not place undue\n\nreliance on these forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ\n\nmaterially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many\n\nreasons, including risks faced by us described in this Report, including the\n\n\"Risk Factors\" section contained in this Item 1, and the other documents we file\n\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including our most recent\n\nreports on Form 8-K and Form 10-Q, and amendments thereto.\n\nCisco Systems, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, \"Cisco\" or the \"Company\")\n\nis the worldwide leader in networking for the Internet. Cisco hardware,\n\nsoftware, and service offerings are used to create Internet solutions so that\n\nindividuals, companies, and countries have seamless access to information --\n\nregardless of differences in time and place. Cisco solutions provide competitive\n\nadvantage to our customers through more efficient and timely exchange of\n\ninformation, which in turn leads to cost savings, process efficiencies, and\n\ncloser relationships with their customers, prospects, business partners,\n\nsuppliers, and employees. These solutions form the networking foundation for\n\ncompanies, universities, utilities, and government agencies worldwide.\n\nThe Company markets its products through its direct sales force, single and\n\ntwo-tier distributors, value-added resellers, service providers, and system\n\nintegrators. This multiple-channel approach allows customers to select the\n\nchannel that addresses their specific needs and provides the Company with broad\n\ncoverage of worldwide markets.\n\nCisco was incorporated in California in December 1984 and is headquartered in\n\nSan Jose. The mailing address for the Company's headquarters is 170 West Tasman\n\nDrive, San Jose, California, 95134-1706, and its telephone number at that\n\nlocation is (408) 526-4000. Cisco can also be reached at its Web site\n\nwww.cisco.com.\n\n3\n\n4\n\nEND-TO-END NETWORKING SOLUTIONS\n\nCisco is the worldwide leader in networking for the Internet. The Cisco strategy\n\nis to provide end-to-end networking solutions to help its customers improve\n\nproductivity and gain a competitive advantage in today's global economy. Cisco\n\nhelps its customers build their own network infrastructure while also providing\n\ntools to allow them to communicate to their customers, prospects, business\n\npartners, suppliers, and employees. An end-to-end networking solution allows\n\nnetwork services to be consistently provided to all users on the network.\n\nCisco's product portfolio offers a broad range of end-to-end networking\n\nhardware, software, and services. Products are used individually or in\n\ncombinations to connect computing devices to networks or computer networks with\n\neach other -- whether they are within a building, across a campus, or around the\n\nworld. The Company's breadth of product offerings enables it to offer a wide\n\nrange of solutions to meet customer requirements. Many of the Company's products\n\nare easily upgraded or expanded, offering customers the ability to extend their\n\nnetworks as their needs grow.\n\nThe Company also provides products and services that allow customers to\n\ntransition their data networks to a single multiservice data, voice, and video\n\nnetwork.\n\nCisco product offerings fall into several categories:\n\nRouting\n\nRouting is a foundation technology for computer networking. Routers move\n\ninformation from one network to another, applying intelligence in the process to\n\nensure that the information reaches its destination securely and in the most\n\ndirect way possible. Cisco offers a broad range of routers that can be used from\n\na large backbone infrastructure to a small office, including the Cisco 12000\n\ngigabit switch router (\"GSR\") series; the Cisco 7500 series; the Cisco 4000\n\nseries; and the Cisco 8500, 3600, 2600, 2500, 1000, 800, and 700 product\n\nfamilies.\n\nSwitching\n\nSwitching is another important networking technology that is used in both\n\nlocal-area networks (\"LANs\") and wide-area networks (\"WANs\"). Cisco's switching\n\nstrategy is designed to help users migrate from traditional shared LANs to fully\n\nswitched networks by delivering products that support the varying levels of\n\nflexibility, cost-effectiveness, and high bandwidth required for today's\n\ndesktop, workgroup, and backbone applications. Cisco solutions employ all widely\n\nused switching technologies --\n\n4\n\n5\n\nEthernet, Gigabit Ethernet, Token Ring, and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (\"ATM\").\n\nCisco's LAN switching products include the Catalyst(R) product family, and its\n\nWAN switching products include the Cisco IGX(TM), Cisco BPX(R), Cisco TGX, and\n\nCisco MGX(TM) families.\n\nAccess\n\nToday, people need remote access to the Internet or to a network that is used\n\nfor a variety of personal, professional, or work-related applications. Cisco\n\naccess solutions give groups and individuals who are remotely located similar\n\nlevels of connectivity and information access, as they would have if they were\n\nlocated at the company's head office or at home. Asynchronous and integrated\n\nservices digital network (\"ISDN\") remote-access routers, dial-up access servers,\n\ndigital subscriber line (\"DSL\") technologies, and cable universal broadband\n\nrouters provide telecommuters and mobile workers and students with remote\n\nnetwork access. The Company's access products include the Cisco AS5000 family of\n\naccess servers; the Cisco 6100 and 6200 lines of digital subscriber line access\n\nmultiplexers (\"DSLAM\"); the Cisco uBR7200 Universal Broadband Router cable\n\nhead-end equipment; access routers such as the Cisco 6000, 4000, 3800, 3600,\n\n2600, 1700, and 1600 families; and the Cisco ISR 3303 Integrated SONET/SDH\n\nRouter, and network security and management software.\n\nOther\n\nThe other product offerings consists of systems network architecture, Internet\n\nservices, network management software, and customer advocacy, among others, as\n\nfollows:\n\nSystems Network Architecture\n\nMost large organizations have existing IBM computing systems that use the\n\nSystems Network Architecture (\"SNA\") networking method as well as LANs based on\n\nopen network architectures [such as the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet\n\nProtocol (\"TCP/IP\")]. Increasingly, network managers want to combine these two\n\nnetworks into a single network that leverages existing investments. Cisco\n\nprovides a broad range of products and solutions for the IBM marketplace that\n\nmaximizes availability, scalability, performance, flexibility, and management.\n\nThese products provide IBM networks with a clear migration path to the future\n\nwhile protecting investments in existing equipment and applications.\n\nInternet Service\n\nCisco offers end-to-end Internet services to improve a network manager's ability\n\nto cope with challenges posed by the growing popularity of the Internet, such as\n\nnetwork traffic volume and network address shortages. Cisco Internet Service\n\nUnits (\"ISUs\")\n\n5\n\n6\n\ndrive architectural consistency across the Company by focusing on\n\nstandards-based services between clients and servers such as end-to-end quality\n\nof service (\"QoS\") and end-to-end security. Cisco ISU products include: the\n\nPIX(TM) Firewall family, which prevents unauthorized access to a network; the\n\nNetSonar(TM) System, which scans the network for security risks; the\n\nNetRanger(R) System, which detects and responds to unauthorized activity or\n\nnetwork attacks; Cisco Secure VPN Client 1.0, which ensures data privacy when\n\naccessing the network remotely; Cisco LocalDirector, Cisco Cache Engine, and\n\nCisco DistributedDirector, which balance the load between multiple servers to\n\nenable timely access and to eliminate redundant Internet content; and the Cisco\n\nServer Suite 1000, which consists of server applications with a graphical user\n\ninterface (\"GUI\").\n\nNetwork Management Software\n\nCisco is extending its leading Internet business practices to its network\n\nmanagement vision and products. One component of this initiative is\n\nCiscoWorks2000, a family of products based on Internet standards that enables\n\nenterprise customers to better control their large, complex, and heterogeneous\n\nnetworks and devices.\n\nIn order for service providers to profit from increasing new business\n\nopportunities, services must be carefully planned, quickly provisioned,\n\nefficiently operated, and accurately billed. The Cisco Service Management system\n\n(\"CSM\") is a network service and delivery management system that provides a\n\nmodular suite of service management products integrated within a common and\n\nscalable infrastructure. CSM enables service providers to effectively deploy,\n\nmonitor, and manage these new network services, while potentially increasing\n\nrevenue and reducing cost.\n\nCisco created a new business group focused on building software solutions to\n\nexpand the Company's technology offerings into messaging and call centers and\n\nextend Cisco's presence in the broader market for intelligent customer contact\n\nsoftware applications. Software applications from this team will provide\n\nend-users with the ability to unify voice-mail, e-mail, and fax traffic into a\n\nsingle mailbox accessible over an Internet-based network independent of\n\nlocation, time, or device. And, when calling in for customer support, they will\n\nbe connected to the best available customer service representative regardless of\n\nphysical location.\n\nCustomer Advocacy\n\nThe Company enables successful deployment of global networks by providing\n\nflexible support service solutions that meet today's needs, provide a smooth\n\ntransition to the new world,\n\n6\n\n7\n\nensure faster deployment of services, reduce and manage the risk associated with\n\nrapidly integrating new technologies, streamline business processes, and reduce\n\noperating costs. Customer Advocacy provides a broad range of services, such as\n\nconsultative, technical, project, quality, customer service, and maintenance\n\nlevel services, which further complement Cisco product offerings.\n\nThe following product is offered in conjunction with all of the above product\n\ncategories:\n\nCisco IOS(R) Software\n\nCisco IOS Software is a common networking software platform deployed across a\n\nbroad spectrum of Cisco products. Cisco IOS Software delivers intelligent\n\nnetwork services -- such as QoS, load-balancing, and multicast functions -- that\n\nenable customers to build a flexible network infrastructure that is scalable,\n\nreliable, and secure. These intelligent network services also support Internet\n\nbusiness solutions.\n\nAmong the emerging types of applications that require these features are\n\non-demand media, electronic commerce services, real-time trading, and\n\ndistance-learning activities. These applications form the foundation for new\n\nbusiness models that increase competition, improve customer service, and enhance\n\nproductivity.\n\nCUSTOMERS AND MARKETS\n\nNetworking needs are influenced by a number of factors, including the size of\n\nthe organization, number and types of computer systems, geographic location, and\n\nthe applications requiring data communications. The Cisco customer base is not\n\nconcentrated in any particular industry and in each of the past five fiscal\n\nyears, no single customer has accounted for 10 percent or more of the Company's\n\nnet sales. For additional information regarding segment information for the\n\nCompany, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part\n\nII, Item 8.\n\nThe Cisco market strategy addresses four main customer profiles:\n\nEnterprise\n\nEnterprise customers generally are large organizations with 500 or more\n\nemployees with complex networking needs, usually spanning multiple locations and\n\ntypes of computer systems. Enterprise customers include corporations, government\n\nagencies, utilities, and educational institutions.\n\n7\n\n8\n\nService Providers\n\nThese customers provide data, voice, and video communication services to\n\nbusinesses and consumers. They include regional, national, and international\n\nlong distance telecommunications carriers, as well as Internet, cable, and\n\nwireless service providers.\n\nSmall/Medium-Sized Businesses\n\nThese customers have less than 500 employees and a need for networks of their\n\nown, as well as connection to the Internet and to business partners. However,\n\nthese customers generally have limited expertise in networking technology;\n\ntherefore, the Company attempts to provide products that are affordable and easy\n\nto install and use.\n\nConsumers\n\nConsumers have a need for networking devices and services to connect them to the\n\nInternet from within their homes. In addition, some advanced consumers will\n\nnetwork together a range of devices within their home, linking together devices\n\nsuch as personal computer, television, telephone, fax, and more, into an\n\nintegrated personal network. Internet access services are provided to them\n\nthrough regional carriers and Internet service providers.\n\nCISCO SALES OVERVIEW\n\nThe Company's worldwide direct sales and marketing organization at July 29, 2000\n\nconsisted of approximately 14,000 individuals, including managers, sales\n\nrepresentatives, and technical support personnel. The Company has field sales\n\noffices globally providing coverage throughout the world. Additionally, the\n\nCompany's international sales are currently being made through multiple channels\n\nincluding international distributors, resellers, and direct sales throughout the\n\nworld. The distributors provide system installation, technical support, and\n\nfollow-up services to end-customers. Generally, the Company's international\n\ndistributors have nonexclusive, country-wide agreements. For additional\n\ninformation regarding the Company's international sales, see Note 12 to the\n\nConsolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8.\n\nCisco Capital specializes in financing networking equipment. Cisco Capital\n\noffers innovative, flexible financial services to Cisco's customers and channel\n\npartners at competitive rates. Our services are designed to help our customers\n\nspread their costs of acquisition, management, and end-of-life disposal\n\nassociated with networking products. For additional information regarding Cisco\n\nCapital's financing activities, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial\n\nStatements contained in Part II, Item 8.\n\n8\n\n9\n\nACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS AND ALLIANCES\n\nThe end-to-end networking strategy pursued by Cisco requires a wide variety of\n\ntechnologies, products, and capabilities. The combination of complexity and\n\nrapid change make it difficult for one company, no matter how large, to develop\n\nall technological solutions alone. Acquisitions, investments, and alliances are\n\ntools used by the Company to fill gaps in its offerings and enable it to deliver\n\ncomplete solutions to customers and prospects in its target markets.\n\nSatisfying customers' networking needs requires a constant monitoring of market\n\nand technology trends, plus an ability to act quickly. Cisco has a four-part\n\napproach to satisfying the need for new or enhanced networking products and\n\nsolutions. In order of preference, the approach is to develop new technologies\n\nand products internally; enter into joint-development efforts with other\n\ncompanies; resell another company's product; and acquire all or part of another\n\ncompany.\n\nSince 1993, the Company has acquired a number of companies. The Company expects\n\nto make future acquisitions where it believes that it can acquire new products\n\nand channels of distribution or otherwise rapidly enter new or emerging markets.\n\nMergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and\n\nno assurance can be given that the Company's previous or future acquisitions\n\nwill be successful or will not materially adversely affect the Company's\n\nfinancial condition or operating results. The risks associated with acquisitions\n\nare more fully discussed in the \"Risk Factors\" section contained in Item 1 of\n\nthis Report.\n\nThe Company's acquisitions have furthered its commitment towards providing an\n\nend-to-end networking solution. The Company now has a broad set of product\n\nofferings and technologies, which include Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet switching,\n\nToken Ring, ATM switching, SONET/SDH, xDSL, dial-up access, converged data,\n\nvoice, and video technologies, Tag Switching [currently also known as\n\nmultiprotocol label switching (\"MPLS\")], optical transport, wireless, content\n\nnetworking, call center and unified messaging solutions, network security, and\n\nnetwork management software solutions, among others.\n\nMINORITY INVESTMENTS\n\nThe Company makes minority investments in companies that build technology or\n\nprovide services that are complementary to Cisco products or that support the\n\nInternet. By investing in new ventures, Cisco strengthens its partnerships with\n\nsuch companies. Together,\n\n9\n\n10\n\nCisco and its partners can offer more complete solutions to the market.\n\nSTRATEGIC ALLIANCES\n\nCisco pursues strategic alliances with other industry leaders in areas where\n\ncollaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets.\n\nThe objectives and goals for a strategic alliance can include one or more of the\n\nfollowing: technology exchange, product development, joint sales and marketing,\n\nand new-market creation. This year, Cisco expanded or entered into alliances\n\nwith Cap Gemini/Ernst & Young, Hewlett Packard, Intel, IBM, KPMG Consulting,\n\nInc., Microsoft, Motorola, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, and Telcordia, among\n\nothers.\n\nBACKLOG\n\nThe Company's backlog at September 25, 2000 was approximately $3.83 billion\n\ncompared with a backlog of approximately $922 million at September 20, 1999. The\n\nCompany includes in its backlog only orders confirmed with a purchase order for\n\nproducts to be shipped within 120 days to customers with approved credit status.\n\nBecause of the generally short cycle between order and shipment, and occasional\n\ncustomer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders (which are made\n\nwithout significant penalty), the Company does not believe that its backlog, as\n\nof any particular date, is necessarily indicative of actual net sales for any\n\nfuture period.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nCisco competes in the Internet infrastructure market, providing solutions for\n\ntransporting data, voice, and video traffic across intranets, extranets, and the\n\nInternet. The market is characterized by rapid growth, converging technologies,\n\nand a conversion to New World solutions that offer superior advantages. These\n\nmarket factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to Cisco.\n\nThe Company competes with numerous vendors in each product category. Cisco\n\nexpects that the overall number of competitors providing niche product solutions\n\nwill increase due to the market's attractive growth. On the other hand, the\n\nCompany expects the number of vendors supplying end-to-end networking solutions\n\nwill decrease, due to the rapid pace of acquisitions in the industry. The\n\nCompany believes its primary competition comes from nimble start-ups and young\n\ncompanies offering innovative niche solutions.\n\nCisco's competitors include Alcatel, Ericsson, Extreme, Foundry, Juniper,\n\nLucent, Nortel, Redback, Siemens AG, and Sycamore. Some of our competitors\n\ncompete across many of our product lines, while others do not offer as wide a\n\nbreadth of solutions.\n\n10\n\n11\n\nSeveral of our current and potential competitors have greater financial,\n\nmarketing, and technical resources than we do.\n\nThe principal competitive factors in the markets in which the Company presently\n\ncompetes and may compete in the future are:\n\n- - Price and/or ability to provide financing;\n\n- - Performance;\n\n- - The ability to provide end-to-end networking solutions and support;\n\n- - Conformance to standards;\n\n- - The ability to provide value-added features such as security, reliability,\n\nand investment protection; and\n\n- - Market presence\n\nThe Company also faces competition from customers it licenses technology to and\n\nsuppliers from whom it transfers technology. Networking's inherent nature\n\nrequires inter-operability. As such, the Company must cooperate and at the same\n\ntime compete with these companies. The Company's inability to effectively\n\nmanage these complicated relationships with customers and suppliers could have a\n\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results, and\n\nfinancial condition.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe Company has enhanced and extended its product lines with new product and\n\nfeature introductions including optical transport, data, voice, and video\n\nintegration, virtual private networking, DSL, cable modem, gigabit switching,\n\nwireless, content networking (content distribution and management, content\n\nrouting, content edge delivery, content switching, and intelligent network\n\nservices), security, and network management, among others.\n\nHowever, the industry in which Cisco competes in is subject to rapid\n\ntechnological developments, evolving industry standards, changes in customer\n\nrequirements, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. As a\n\nresult, the Company's success, in part, depends upon its ability, on a\n\ncost-effective and timely basis, to continue to enhance its existing solutions\n\nand to develop and introduce new solutions that improve performance and reduce\n\ntotal cost of ownership. In order to achieve these objectives, the Company's\n\nmanagement and engineering personnel work closely with customers to identify and\n\nrespond to customer needs, as well as with other innovators of inter-networking\n\nproducts, including universities, laboratories, and corporations. The Company\n\nwill also continue to make strategic acquisitions and equity investments where\n\nappropriate. The Company intends to remain dedicated to industry standards and\n\nto continue to support important protocol standards as they\n\n11\n\n12\n\nemerge. Still, there can be no assurance that Cisco will be able to successfully\n\ndevelop new products to address new customer requirements and technological\n\nchanges, or that such products will achieve market acceptance.\n\nIn fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998, the Company's research and development\n\nexpenditures were approximately $2.70 billion, $1.66 billion, and $1.05 billion,\n\nrespectively. All of the Company's expenditures for research and development\n\ncosts, as well as in-process research and development of approximately $1.37\n\nbillion, $471 million, and $594 million in fiscal 2000, 1999, and 1998,\n\nrespectively, have been expensed as incurred.\n\nMANUFACTURING\n\nThe Company's manufacturing operations primarily consist of quality assurance of\n\nmaterials, components, and subassemblies. Additionally, the Company performs\n\nfinal assembly and test. The Company presently uses a variety of independent\n\nthird-party companies to perform printed circuit board assembly, in-circuit\n\ntest, and product repair. The Company and its single enterprise partners install\n\nproprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips installed in\n\nits systems in order to configure products to customer needs and to maintain\n\nquality control and security. The manufacturing process enables the Company to\n\nconfigure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide\n\nvariety of individual customer requirements. The Company and its single\n\nenterprise partners also use automated testing equipment and \"burn-in\"\n\nprocedures, as well as comprehensive inspection, testing, and statistical\n\nprocess control, to assure the quality and reliability of its products. The\n\nCompany's and its partners' manufacturing processes and procedures are ISO 9001\n\ncertified.\n\nPATENTS, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND LICENSING\n\nCisco's success is dependent upon its proprietary technology. Cisco generally\n\nrelies upon patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish\n\nand maintain its proprietary rights in its technology and products. Cisco has a\n\nprogram to file applications for and obtain patents in the United States and in\n\nselected foreign countries where a potential market for Cisco's products exists.\n\nCisco has been issued a number of patents; other patent applications are\n\ncurrently pending. There can be no assurance that any of these patents will not\n\nbe challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that any rights granted\n\nthereunder will provide competitive advantages to Cisco. In addition, there can\n\nbe no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications, or that\n\nclaims allowed on any future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect\n\nCisco's technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may\n\n12\n\n13\n\nnot permit the protection of Cisco's proprietary rights to the same extent as do\n\nthe laws of the United States. Although Cisco believes the protection afforded\n\nby its patents, patent applications, copyrights, and trademarks has value, the\n\nrapidly changing technology in the networking industry makes Cisco's future\n\nsuccess dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological expertise,\n\nand management abilities of its employees rather than on patent, copyright, and\n\ntrademark protection.\n\nMany of Cisco's products are designed to include software or other intellectual\n\nproperty licensed from third-parties. While it may be necessary in the future to\n\nseek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products, Cisco\n\nbelieves that based upon past experience and standard industry practice, such\n\nlicenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Because\n\nof the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field and the\n\nrapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is not economically practical to\n\ndetermine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringe patent\n\nrights of others. From time to time, Cisco receives notices from or is sued by\n\nthird-parties regarding patent claims. If infringement is alleged, Cisco\n\nbelieves that, based upon industry practice, any necessary license or rights\n\nunder such patents may be obtained on terms that would not have a material\n\nadverse effect on Cisco's business, operating results, or financial condition.\n\nNevertheless, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be\n\navailable on acceptable terms, if at all, or that Cisco would prevail in any\n\nsuch challenge. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to\n\nobtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in\n\nlitigation could have a material adverse effect on Cisco's business, operating\n\nresults, and financial condition.\n\nEMPLOYEES\n\nAs of July 29, 2000, the Company employed approximately 34,000 persons,\n\nincluding 6,000 in manufacturing, service and support, 14,000 in sales and\n\nmarketing, 11,000 in engineering, and 3,000 in finance and administration.\n\nApproximately 9,000 employees were in international locations.\n\nThe Company considers the relationships with its employees to be positive. The\n\nCompany has not experienced any work stoppages.\n\nCompetition for technical personnel in the industry that Cisco competes in is\n\nintense. The Company believes that our future success depends in part on our\n\ncontinued ability to hire, assimilate, and retain qualified personnel. To date,\n\nCisco believes that they have been successful in recruiting qualified employees,\n\nbut there is no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in the\n\nfuture.\n\n13\n\n14\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this Report and in other documents we file with\n\nthe SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ\n\nmaterially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements\n\ncontained in this Report.\n\nYOU SHOULD EXPECT THAT OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE IN FUTURE PERIODS\n\nThe results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of\n\nresults to be expected in future periods. Our operating results have in the past\n\nbeen, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly fluctuations as a result of\n\na number of factors. These factors include:\n\n- - The integration of people, operations, and products from acquired businesses\n\nand technologies;\n\n- - Increased competition in the networking industry;\n\n- - The overall trend toward industry consolidation;\n\n- - The introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and standards,\n\nincluding switch routers, Gigabit Ethernet switching, Tag Switching\n\n(currently also known as multiprotocol label switching [\"MPLS\"]), optical\n\ntransport, wireless, content networking and data, voice, and video\n\ncapabilities;\n\n- - Variations in sales channels, product costs, or mix of products sold;\n\n- - The timing of orders and manufacturing lead times;\n\n- - The trend towards sales of integrated network solutions;\n\n- - The timing and amount of employer payroll tax to be paid on employees' gains\n\non stock options exercised; and\n\n- - Changes in general economic conditions and specific economic conditions in\n\nthe computer and networking industries.\n\nAny of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations\n\nand financial results. For example, from time to time, we have made acquisitions\n\nthat result in in-process research and development expenses being charged in an\n\nindividual quarter. These charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting\n\nin variability in our quarterly earnings. Additionally, as a further example,\n\nthe dollar amounts of large orders for our products have been increasing and\n\ntherefore the operating results for a quarter could be materially adversely\n\naffected if a number of large orders are either not received or are delayed, for\n\nexample, due to cancellations, delays, or deferrals by customers.\n\n14\n\n15\n\nWE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN NEW AND EXISTING MARKET OPPORTUNITIES\n\nWe are investing in increased headcount, inventory, manufacturing capacity, and\n\nproduct development through internal efforts and acquisitions, as a result of\n\ngrowth in existing opportunities and new or emerging opportunities in our target\n\nmarkets. We intend to add resources across all functions.\n\nWith increased levels of spending, an inability to meet expected revenue levels\n\nin a particular quarter could have a material, negative impact on our operating\n\nresults for that period as we will not be able to react quickly enough to scale\n\nback expenses. Increased investments across all functions could translate into a\n\nfaster rate of expense growth compared to revenue growth.\n\nSINCE OUR GROWTH RATE MAY SLOW, OPERATING RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR QUARTER ARE\n\nDIFFICULT TO PREDICT\n\nWe expect that in the future, our net sales may grow at a slower rate than\n\nexperienced in previous periods and that on a quarter-to-quarter basis, our\n\ngrowth in net sales may be significantly lower than our historical quarterly\n\ngrowth rate. As a consequence, operating results for a particular quarter are\n\nextremely difficult to predict. Our ability to meet financial expectations could\n\nbe hampered if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in past quarters reoccurs in\n\nfuture periods. We generally have had one quarter of the fiscal year when\n\nbacklog has been reduced. Although such reductions have not occurred\n\nconsistently in recent years, they are difficult to predict and may occur in the\n\nfuture. In addition, in response to customer demand, we continue to attempt to\n\nreduce our product manufacturing lead times, which may result in corresponding\n\nreductions in order backlog. A decline in backlog levels could result in more\n\nvariability and less predictability in our quarter-to-quarter net sales and\n\noperating results going forward. On the other hand, for certain products, lead\n\ntimes are longer than our goal. If we cannot reduce manufacturing lead times for\n\nsuch products, our customers may cancel orders or not place further orders if\n\nshorter lead times are available from other manufacturers.\n\n15\n\n16\n\nWE EXPECT GROSS MARGIN TO DECLINE OVER TIME\n\nWe expect gross margin may be adversely affected by increases in material or\n\nlabor costs, heightened price competition, increasing levels of services, higher\n\ninventory balances, introduction of new products for new high-growth markets,\n\nand changes in channels of distribution or in the mix of products sold. We\n\nbelieve gross margin may additionally be impacted due to constraints relating to\n\ncertain component shortages that currently exist in the supply chain. We may\n\nalso experience a lower gross margin as the product mix for access and optical\n\nproduct volume grows.\n\nWe have recently introduced several new products, with additional new products\n\nscheduled to be released in the future. Increase in demand would result in\n\nincreased manufacturing capacity, which in turn would result in higher inventory\n\nbalances. In addition, our vendor base is capacity-constrained, and this could\n\nresult in increased cost pressure on certain components. If product or related\n\nwarranty costs associated with these new products are greater than we have\n\nexperienced, gross margin may be adversely affected. Our gross margin may also\n\nbe impacted by geographic mix, as well as the mix of configurations within each\n\nproduct group. We continue to expand into third-party or indirect-distribution\n\nchannels, which generally results in a lower gross margin. In addition,\n\nincreasing third-party and indirect-distribution channels generally results in\n\ngreater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our product, and to a certain\n\ndegree, the timing of orders from our customers. Downward pressures on our gross\n\nmargin may be further impacted by other factors, such as increased percentage of\n\nrevenue from service provider markets, which may have lower margins or an\n\nincrease in product costs, which could adversely affect our future operating\n\nresults.\n\nWe also expect that our operating margin may decrease as we continue to hire\n\nadditional personnel and experience increases in overall operating expenses to\n\nsupport our business. We plan our operating expense levels based primarily on\n\nforecasted revenue levels. Because these expenses are relatively fixed in the\n\nshort term, a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below\n\nexpectations.\n\nWE ARE DEPENDENT UPON ADEQUATE COMPONENT SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING CAPACITY\n\nOur growth and ability to meet customer demands also depend in part on our\n\nability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers. We have\n\nexperienced component shortages in the past that have adversely affected our\n\noperations. Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid these types of\n\nshortages, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems\n\nin the future. Although we generally use standard parts\n\n16\n\n17\n\nand components for our products, certain components are presently available only\n\nfrom a single source or limited sources.\n\nWhile our suppliers have performed effectively and been relatively flexible to\n\ndate, we believe that we will be faced with the following challenges going\n\nforward:\n\n- - New markets that we participate in may grow quickly and thus, consume\n\nsignificant component capacity;\n\n- - As we continue to acquire companies and new technologies, we are dependent,\n\nat least initially, on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply\n\npartners;\n\n- - We face increased competition for certain components, which are currently\n\nsupply constrained, from existing competitors and companies in other\n\nmarkets.\n\nManufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could be significant\n\nissues for us. For example, we have increased our manufacturing capacity\n\nsignificantly and plan to further increase capacity during the coming months. To\n\nmitigate the component supply constraints, we have started to build inventory\n\nlevels. A reduction or interruption in supply or a significant increase in the\n\nprice of one or more components would adversely affect our business, operating\n\nresults and financial condition, perhaps materially, and could materially damage\n\ncustomer relationships.\n\nWE COMPETE IN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT MARKET\n\nFor additional information regarding our competition, see the section entitled\n\n\"Competition\" contained in Item 1 of this Report.\n\nWE EXPECT TO MAKE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS WHERE ADVISABLE AND ACQUISITIONS INVOLVE\n\nNUMEROUS RISKS\n\nThe networking business is highly competitive, and as such, our growth is\n\ndependent upon market growth, our ability to enhance our existing products and\n\nour ability to introduce new products on a timely basis. One of the ways we have\n\naddressed and will continue to address the need to develop new products is\n\nthrough acquisitions of other companies. Acquisitions involve numerous risks,\n\nincluding the following:\n\n- - Difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, and products of the\n\nacquired companies;\n\n17\n\n18\n\n- - The risk of diverting management's attention from normal daily operations of\n\nthe business;\n\n- - Potential difficulties in completing projects associated with in-process\n\nresearch and development;\n\n- - Risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior\n\nexperience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market\n\npositions;\n\n- - Initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply\n\npartners;\n\n- - Insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with\n\nacquisitions; and\n\n- - The potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies.\n\nMergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky, and\n\nno assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be\n\nsuccessful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating\n\nresults, or financial condition.\n\nWe must also manage any growth effectively. Failure to manage growth effectively\n\nand successfully integrate acquisitions we made could harm our business and\n\noperating results in a material way.\n\nWE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE EXCHANGE RATES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY\n\nAs a global concern, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency\n\nexchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices\n\nevolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nHistorically, our primary exposures have related to nondollar-denominated sales\n\nin Japan, Canada, and Australia and nondollar-denominated operating expenses in\n\nEurope, Latin America, and Asia where we sell primarily in U.S. dollars.\n\nAdditionally, we have continued to see our exposures to emerging market\n\ncurrencies, such as the Korean won, increase because of our expanding presence\n\nin these markets and their extreme currency volatility. We will continue to\n\nmonitor our exposure and may hedge against these or any other emerging market\n\ncurrencies as necessary.\n\nThe increasing use of the euro as a common currency for members of the European\n\nUnion could impact our foreign exchange exposure. We are currently hedging\n\nagainst fluctuations with the euro and will continue to evaluate the impact of\n\nthe euro on our future foreign exchange exposure as well as on our internal\n\nsystems. At the present time, we hedge only those currency exposures associated\n\nwith certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and\n\nperiodically will hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows. The hedging\n\nactivity undertaken by\n\n18\n\n19\n\nus is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain\n\nnonfunctional currency assets and liabilities.\n\nWE ARE EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK OF SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO CREDIT\n\nEXPOSURES IN WEAKENED MARKETS\n\nA significant proportion of our sales are derived through our partners in\n\ntwo-tier distribution channels. These customers are generally given privileges\n\nto return inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, and\n\nparticipate in cooperative marketing programs. We maintain appropriate accruals\n\nand allowances for such exposures. However, such partners tend to have access to\n\nmore limited financial resources than other resellers and end-user customers and\n\ntherefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk. We are\n\nexperiencing increased demands for customer financing, including loan financing,\n\nand leasing solutions. We expect demands for customer financing to continue. We\n\nbelieve it is a competitive factor in obtaining business, particularly in\n\nsupplying customers involved in significant infrastructure projects. Our loan\n\nfinancing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our\n\nproducts but also providing additional funds for soft costs associated with\n\nnetwork installation and integration of our products and for working capital\n\npurposes. Although we have programs in place to monitor and mitigate the\n\nassociated risk, there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective\n\nin reducing our credit risk. We also continue to monitor increased credit\n\nexposures from weakened financial conditions in certain geographical regions,\n\nand the impact that such conditions may have on the worldwide economy. We have\n\nexperienced losses due to customers failing to meet their obligations. Although\n\nthese losses have not been significant, future losses, if incurred, could harm\n\nour business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and\n\nfinancial condition.\n\nWE ARE EXPOSED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUES OF OUR PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS\n\nAND IN INTEREST RATES\n\nFor additional information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated\n\nwith the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates, see Item 7A\n\n\"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" contained in Part\n\nII of this Report.\n\nWE CANNOT PREDICT THE IMPACT OF RECENT ACTIONS AND COMMENTS BY THE SEC AND FASB\n\nRecent actions and comments from the SEC have indicated they are reviewing the\n\ncurrent valuation methodology of in-process research and development related to\n\nbusiness combinations. The SEC is concerned that some companies are writing off\n\nmore of the\n\n19\n\n20\n\nvalue of an acquisition than is appropriate. We believe we are in compliance\n\nwith all of the rules and related guidance as they currently exist. However,\n\nthere can be no assurance that the SEC will not seek to reduce the amount of\n\nin-process research and development previously expensed by us. This would result\n\nin the restatement of our previously filed financial statements and could have a\n\nmaterial adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition for\n\nperiods subsequent to the acquisitions. Additionally, FASB has announced that it\n\nplans to rescind the pooling of interests method of acquisition accounting. If\n\nthis occurs, it could alter our acquisition strategy and impair our ability to\n\nacquire companies.\n\nOUR BUSINESS DEPENDS UPON OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, AND THERE IS A RISK OF\n\nINFRINGEMENT\n\nFor additional information regarding our proprietary rights, see the section\n\nentitled \"Patents, Intellectual Property, and Licensing\" contained in Item 1 of\n\nthis Report.\n\nWE FACE RISKS FROM THE UNCERTAINTIES OF REGULATION OF THE INTERNET\n\nThere are currently few laws or regulations that apply directly to access or\n\ncommerce on the Internet. We could be materially adversely affected by\n\nregulation of the Internet and Internet commerce in any country where we\n\noperate, on such technology as voice over the Internet, encryption technology,\n\nand access charges for Internet service providers. We also could be materially\n\nadversely affected by the continuing deregulation of the telecommunications\n\nindustry. The adoption of regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce could\n\ndecrease demand for our products, and at the same time increase our cost of\n\nselling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our\n\nbusiness, operating results, and financial condition.\n\nTHE ENTRANCE INTO NEW OR DEVELOPING MARKETS EXPOSES OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS\n\nTO RISKS\n\nAs we focus on new market opportunities, such as transporting data, voice, and\n\nvideo traffic across the same network, we will increasingly compete with large\n\ntelecommunications equipment suppliers such as Alcatel, Ericsson, Lucent,\n\nNortel, and Siemens AG, among others, and several well-funded start-up\n\ncompanies. Several of our current and potential competitors have greater\n\nfinancial, marketing, and technical resources than we do. Additionally, as\n\ncustomers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments, they may require\n\ngreater levels of service, support, and financing than we have experienced in\n\nthe past. We have not entered into a material amount of labor intensive service\n\ncontracts which require significant production\n\n20\n\n21\n\nor customization. However, we expect that demand for these types of service\n\ncontracts will increase in the future. There can be no assurance that we can\n\nprovide products, service, support, and financing to effectively compete for\n\nthese market opportunities. Further, provision of greater levels of services by\n\nus may result in less favorable timing of revenue recognition than we have\n\nhistorically experienced.\n\nTHE LOCATION OF OUR FACILITIES SUBJECTS US TO THE RISK OF EARTHQUAKES AND FLOODS\n\nOur corporate headquarters, including most of our research and development\n\noperations and our manufacturing facilities, are located in the Silicon Valley\n\narea of Northern California, a region known for seismic activity. Additionally,\n\ncertain of our facilities, which includes one of our manufacturing facilities,\n\nare located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past. A\n\nsignificant natural disaster, such as an earthquake or a flood, could have a\n\nmaterial adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial\n\ncondition.\n\nWE DEPEND UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO RAPID CHANGES\n\nIN TECHNOLOGY AND THE MARKET\n\nOur operating results will depend to a significant extent on our ability to\n\nreduce the costs to produce existing products. In particular, we broadened our\n\nproduct line by introducing network access products. Sales of these products,\n\nwhich are generally lower priced and carry lower margins than our core products,\n\nhave increased more rapidly than sales of our core products. The success of\n\nthese and other new products is dependent on several factors, including proper\n\nnew product definition, product cost, timely completion and introduction of new\n\nproducts, differentiation of new products from those of our competitors, and\n\nmarket acceptance of these products. The markets for our products are\n\ncharacterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards,\n\nfrequent new product introductions, and evolving methods of building and\n\noperating networks. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify\n\nnew product opportunities, develop and bring new products to market in a timely\n\nmanner, and achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and\n\ntechnologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies\n\nobsolete or noncompetitive.\n\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH STRATEGIC ALLIANCES\n\nWe have increased the number of our strategic alliances with large and complex\n\norganizations and our ecosystem partners. These arrangements are generally\n\nlimited to specific projects, the goal of which is generally to facilitate\n\nproduct compatibility and adoption of industry standards. If successful, these\n\n21\n\n22\n\nrelationships will be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth.\n\nHowever, these alliances carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we\n\nmust compete in some business areas with a company with which we have strategic\n\nalliances and, at the same time, cooperate with such company in other business\n\nareas. Also, if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail\n\nto materialize as expected, we could suffer delays in product development or\n\nother operational difficulties.\n\nTHE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE COMPETE IS SUBJECT TO CONSOLIDATION\n\nThere has been a trend toward industry consolidation for several years. We\n\nexpect this trend toward industry consolidation to continue as companies attempt\n\nto strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry. We believe\n\nthat industry consolidation may provide stronger competitors that are better\n\nable to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could lead to more\n\nvariability in operating results as we compete to be a single vendor solution\n\nand could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and\n\nfinancial condition.\n\nSALES IN THE SERVICE PROVIDER MARKET ARE SUBJECT TO VARIATION\n\nAlthough sales to the service provider market have grown historically, this\n\nmarket is characterized by large and often sporadic purchases. Sales activity in\n\nthis industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network\n\ninfrastructures, the availability of funding, and the extent that service\n\nproviders are affected by regulatory and business conditions in the country of\n\noperations. A decline or delay in sales orders from this industry could have a\n\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial\n\ncondition.\n\nWE FACE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATION AND\n\nTARIFFS\n\nChanges in domestic and international telecommunications requirements could\n\naffect the sales of our products. In particular, we believe it is possible that\n\nthere may be significant changes in domestic telecommunications regulation in\n\nthe near future that could slow the expansion of the service providers' network\n\ninfrastructures and materially adversely affect our business, operating results,\n\nand financial condition. Future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or\n\napplication of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect\n\nthe sales of our products for certain classes of customers. Additionally, in the\n\nUnited States, our products must comply with various Federal Communications\n\nCommission requirements and regulations. In countries outside of the United\n\nStates, our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications\n\nauthorities. Changes in tariffs or failure by\n\n22\n\n23\n\nus to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on\n\nour business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\nOUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS\n\nWe conduct business globally. Accordingly, our future results could be\n\nmaterially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing\n\nfactors including, among others, foreign currency exchange rates; regulatory,\n\npolitical, or economic conditions in a specific country or region; trade\n\nprotection measures and other regulatory requirements; service provider and\n\ngovernment spending patterns; and natural disasters. Any or all of these factors\n\ncould have a material adverse impact on our future international business.\n\nOUR BUSINESS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDS UPON THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE INTERNET AND\n\nINTERNET-BASED SYSTEMS\n\nWe believe that there will be performance problems with Internet communications\n\nin the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility. As\n\nwe are a large supplier of equipment for the Internet infrastructure, customers'\n\nperceptions of our products and the marketplace's perception of us as a supplier\n\nof networking products may be materially adversely affected, regardless of\n\nwhether or not these problems are due to the performance of our products. Such\n\nan event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of\n\nour common stock and could materially adversely affect our business, operating\n\nresults, and financial condition.\n\nOUR STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE\n\nOur common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a\n\nresult of variations between our actual or anticipated financial results, the\n\npublished expectations of analysts, and as a result of announcements by our\n\ncompetitors and us. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price\n\nand volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology\n\ncompanies, in particular, and that have often been unrelated to the operating\n\nperformance of these companies. These factors, as well as general economic and\n\npolitical conditions, may materially adversely affect the market price of our\n\ncommon stock in the future. Additionally, volatility or a lack of positive\n\nperformance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key\n\nemployees, all of whom have been granted stock options.\n\n23\n\n24\n\nOTHER\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (\"PwC\"), our independent accountants, has notified us\n\nthat PwC is engaged in discussions with the SEC following an internal review by\n\nPwC, pursuant to an administrative settlement with the SEC, of PwC's compliance\n\nwith auditor independence guidelines. PwC has advised us that we are one of the\n\ncompanies affected by such discussions. We are not involved in the discussions\n\nbetween the SEC and PwC and cannot predict the result of those discussions.\n\n24\n\n25\n\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\n\nThe Company's principal corporate offices are located at sites in Alviso,\n\nMilpitas, and San Jose, California. The Company's main headquarters are situated\n\nin San Jose, California.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nAll historical financial information has been restated to reflect the\n\nacquisitions that were accounted for as poolings of interests (see Note 3 to the\n\nConsolidated Financial Statements).\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nCertain statements contained in this Annual Report, including, without\n\nlimitation, statements containing the words \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\"\n\n\"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"projections,\" and words of similar import, constitute\n\n\"forward-looking statements.\" You should not place undue reliance on these\n\nforward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from\n\nthose anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons,\n\nincluding risks faced by us described in this Report, including those set forth\n\nunder the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1, and the other documents we\n\nfile with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including our most\n\nrecent reports on Form 10-K, Form 8-K, and Form 10-Q, and amendments thereto.\n\nCOMPARISON OF FISCAL 2000 AND FISCAL 1999\n\nNet sales in fiscal 2000 were $18.93 billion, compared with $12.17 billion in\n\nfiscal 1999, an increase of 55.5%. The increase in net sales was primarily a\n\nresult of increased unit sales of switch, router, and access products; growth in\n\nthe sales of add-on boards that provide increased functionality; optical\n\ntransport products; and maintenance, service, and support sales (see Note 12 to\n\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nWe manage our business on four geographic theaters: the Americas; Europe, the\n\nMiddle East, and Africa (\"EMEA\"); Asia Pacific; and Japan. Summarized financial\n\ninformation by theater for fiscal 2000 and 1999 is presented in the following\n\ntable (in millions):\n\nPercentage of\n\nAmount Net Sales\n\n-------------------------- -------------------------\n\nJuly 29, July 31, July 29, July 31,\n\nYears Ended 2000 1999 2000 1999\n\n- ----------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nNet sales:\n\nAmericas $ 12,924 $ 8,088 68.3% 66.4%\n\nEMEA 4,770 3,216 25.2 26.4\n\nAsia Pacific 1,705 825 9.0 6.8\n\nJapan 935 566 4.9 4.7\n\nSales adjustments (1,406) (522) (7.4) (4.3)\n\n-------- -------- -------- --------\n\nTotal $ 18,928 $ 12,173 100.0% 100.0%\n\n======== ======== ======== ========\n\nThe revenue growth for each theater was primarily driven by market demand and\n\nthe deployment of Internet technologies and business solutions.\n\n29\n\n30\n\nGross margin in fiscal 2000 was 64.4%, compared with 65.0% in fiscal 1999. The\n\nfollowing table shows the standard margins for each theater:\n\nJuly 29, July 31,\n\nYears Ended 2000 1999\n\n- ----------- ---- ----\n\nStandard margins:\n\nAmericas 72.8% 72.2%\n\nEMEA 75.1% 74.0%\n\nAsia Pacific 71.3% 71.0%\n\nJapan 78.8% 77.0%\n\nThe net sales and standard margins by geographic theater differ from the amounts\n\nrecognized under generally accepted accounting principles because we do not\n\nallocate certain sales adjustments, production overhead, and manufacturing\n\nvariances and other related costs to the theaters. Sales adjustments relate to\n\nrevenue deferrals and reserves, credit memos, returns, and other timing\n\ndifferences.\n\nStandard margins increased for all geographic theaters as compared with fiscal\n\n1999. The decrease in the overall gross margin was primarily due to shifts in\n\nproduct mix, introduction of new products, which generally have lower margins\n\nwhen first released, higher production-related costs, the continued pricing\n\npressure seen from competitors in certain product areas, and the above-mentioned\n\nsales adjustments, which were not included in the standard margins.\n\nWe expect gross margin may be adversely affected by increases in material or\n\nlabor costs, heightened price competition, increasing levels of services, higher\n\ninventory balances, introduction of new products for new high-growth markets,\n\nand changes in channels of distribution or in the mix of products sold. We\n\nbelieve gross margin may additionally be impacted due to constraints relating to\n\ncertain component shortages that currently exist in the supply chain. We may\n\nalso experience a lower gross margin as the product mix for access and optical\n\nproduct volume grows.\n\nWe have recently introduced several new products, with additional new products\n\nscheduled to be released in the future. Increase in demand would result in\n\nincreased manufacturing capacity, which in turn would result in higher inventory\n\nbalances. In addition, our vendor base is capacity-constrained, and this could\n\nresult in increased cost pressure on certain components. If product or related\n\nwarranty costs associated with these new products are greater than we have\n\nexperienced, gross margin may be adversely affected. Our gross margin may also\n\nbe impacted by geographic mix, as well as the mix of configurations within each\n\nproduct group. We continue to expand into third-party or indirect-distribution\n\nchannels, which generally results in a lower gross margin. In addition,\n\nincreasing third-party and indirect-\n\n30\n\n31\n\ndistribution channels generally results in greater difficulty in forecasting the\n\nmix of our product, and to a certain degree, the timing of orders from our\n\ncustomers. Downward pressures on our gross margin may be further impacted by\n\nother factors, such as increased percentage of revenue from service provider\n\nmarkets, which may have lower margins or an increase in product costs, which\n\ncould adversely affect our future operating results.\n\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenses in fiscal 2000 were $2.70 billion,\n\ncompared with $1.66 billion in fiscal 1999, an increase of 62.6%. R&D expenses,\n\nas a percentage of net sales, increased to 14.3% in fiscal 2000, compared with\n\n13.7% in fiscal 1999. The increase reflected our ongoing R&D efforts in a wide\n\nvariety of areas such as data, voice, and video integration, digital subscriber\n\nline (\"DSL\") technologies, cable modem technology, wireless access, dial access,\n\nenterprise switching, optical transport, security, network management, and\n\nhigh-end routing technologies, among others. A significant portion of the\n\nincrease was due to the addition of new personnel, partly through acquisitions,\n\nas well as higher expenditures on prototypes and depreciation on additional lab\n\nequipment. We also continued to purchase technology in order to bring a broad\n\nrange of products to the market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we are\n\nunable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed\n\nproducts, we may license technology from other businesses or acquire businesses\n\nas an alternative to internal R&D. All of our R&D costs are expensed as\n\nincurred. We currently expect that R&D expenses will continue to increase in\n\nabsolute dollars as we continue to invest in technology to address potential\n\nmarket opportunities.\n\nSales and marketing expenses in fiscal 2000 were $3.95 billion, compared with\n\n$2.46 billion in fiscal 1999, an increase of 60.1%. Sales and marketing\n\nexpenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 20.8% in fiscal 2000,\n\ncompared with 20.2% in fiscal 1999. The increase was principally due to an\n\nincrease in the size of our direct sales force and related commissions,\n\nadditional marketing and advertising investments associated with the\n\nintroduction of new products, the expansion of distribution channels, and\n\ngeneral corporate branding. The increase also reflected our efforts to invest in\n\ncertain key areas, such as expansion of our end-to-end networking strategy and\n\nservice provider coverage, in order to be positioned to take advantage of future\n\nmarket opportunities. We currently expect that sales and marketing expenses will\n\ncontinue to increase in absolute dollars.\n\nGeneral and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses in fiscal 2000 were $633 million,\n\ncompared with $381 million in fiscal 1999, an increase of 66.1%. G&A expenses,\n\nas a percentage of net sales, increased to 3.3% in fiscal 2000, compared with\n\n3.1% in fiscal 1999. G&A expenses for fiscal 2000 and 1999 included\n\nacquisition-\n\n31\n\n32\n\nrelated costs of approximately $62 million and $16 million, respectively.\n\nExcluding the acquisition-related costs, the increase in G&A expenses was\n\nprimarily related to the addition of new personnel and investments in\n\ninfrastructure. We intend to keep G&A expenses relatively constant as a\n\npercentage of net sales; however, this depends on the level of acquisition\n\nactivity and our growth, among other factors.\n\nAmortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets included in operating\n\nexpenses was $291 million in fiscal 2000, compared with $61 million in fiscal\n\n1999. Amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets primarily relates\n\nto various purchase acquisitions (see Note 3 and Note 4 to the Consolidated\n\nFinancial Statements). Amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets\n\nwill continue to increase as we acquire companies and technologies.\n\nThe amount expensed to in-process research and development (\"in-process R&D\")\n\narose from the purchase acquisitions completed in fiscal 2000 (see Note 3 to the\n\nConsolidated Financial Statements).\n\nThe fair values of the existing products and patents, as well as the technology\n\ncurrently under development, were determined using the income approach, which\n\ndiscounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used\n\nin the present value calculations were typically derived from a weighted-average\n\ncost of capital analysis and venture capital surveys, adjusted upward to reflect\n\nadditional risks inherent in the development life cycle. These risk factors have\n\nincreased the overall discount rate for acquisitions in the current year. We\n\nconsider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be\n\nstandard within the high-technology communications equipment industry. However,\n\nwe do not expect to achieve a material amount of expense reductions or synergies\n\nas a result of integrating the acquired in-process technology. Therefore, the\n\nvaluation assumptions do not include significant anticipated cost savings.\n\nThe development of these technologies remains a significant risk due to the\n\nremaining effort to achieve technical viability, rapidly changing customer\n\nmarkets, uncertain standards for new products, and significant competitive\n\nthreats from numerous companies. The nature of the efforts to develop the\n\nacquired technologies into commercially viable products consists principally of\n\nplanning, designing, and testing activities necessary to determine that the\n\nproducts can meet market expectations, including functionality and technical\n\nrequirements. Failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could\n\nresult in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging\n\nmarkets and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating\n\nresults.\n\n32\n\n33\n\nThe following table summarizes the significant assumptions underlying the\n\nvaluations for our significant purchase acquisitions completed in fiscal 2000\n\nand 1999 (in millions, except percentages):\n\nAcquisition Assumptions\n\n-----------------------\n\nEstimated Cost\n\nto Complete Risk-Adjusted\n\nTechnology at Discount\n\nTime of Rate for In-\n\nAcquired Company Acquisition Process R&D\n\n---------------- ----------- -----------\n\nFiscal 2000\n\n- -----------\n\nMonterey Networks, Inc. $ 4 30.0%\n\nThe optical systems business of Pirelli S.p.A. $ 5 20.0%\n\nAironet Wireless Communications, Inc. $ 3 23.5%\n\nAtlantech Technologies $ 6 37.5%\n\nJetCell, Inc. $ 7 30.5%\n\nPentaCom, Ltd. $ 13 30.0%\n\nQeyton Systems $ 6 35.0%\n\nFiscal 1999\n\n- -----------\n\nSumma Four, Inc. $ 5 25.0%\n\nClarity Wireless, Inc. $ 42 32.0%\n\nSelsius Systems, Inc. $ 15 31.0%\n\nPipeLinks, Inc. $ 5 31.0%\n\nAmteva Technologies $ 4 35.0%\n\nRegarding our purchase acquisitions completed in fiscal 2000 and 1999, actual\n\nresults to date have been consistent, in all material respects, with our\n\nassumptions at the time of the acquisitions. The assumptions primarily consist\n\nof an expected completion date for the in-process projects, estimated costs to\n\ncomplete the projects, and revenue and expense projections once the products\n\nhave entered the market. Shipment volumes of products from the above-acquired\n\ntechnologies are not material to our overall financial results at the present\n\ntime. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of overall revenue\n\nprojections early in the technology or product life cycle. Failure to achieve\n\nthe expected levels of revenue and net income from these products will\n\nnegatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that the\n\nacquisitions were completed and potentially result in impairment of any other\n\nassets related to the development activities.\n\nInterest and other income, net, was $577 million in fiscal 2000, compared with\n\n$330 million in fiscal 1999. The increase was primarily due to interest income\n\nrelated to the general increase in cash and investments, which was generated\n\nfrom our operations. Net gains realized on minority investments were $531\n\nmillion in\n\n33\n\n34\n\nfiscal 2000. The net gains realized on minority investments were not material in\n\nfiscal 1999.\n\nOur pro forma effective tax rate for fiscal 2000 was 30.0%. The actual effective\n\ntax rate was 38.6%, which included the impact of nondeductible in-process R&D\n\nand acquisition-related costs. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely\n\naffected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower\n\neffective rates or by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations.\n\nAdditionally, we have provided a valuation allowance on certain of our deferred\n\ntax assets because of uncertainty regarding their realizability due to\n\nexpectation of future employee stock option exercises (see Note 11 to the\n\nConsolidated Financial Statements).\n\nCOMPARISON OF FISCAL 1999 AND FISCAL 1998\n\nNet sales in fiscal 1999 were $12.17 billion, compared with $8.49 billion in\n\nfiscal 1998, an increase of 43.4%. The increase in net sales was primarily a\n\nresult of increased unit sales of LAN switching products, access servers,\n\nhigh-performance WAN switching and routing products, and maintenance service\n\ncontracts.\n\nGross margin in fiscal 1999 was 65.0%, compared with 65.6% in fiscal 1998. The\n\ndecrease in the overall gross margin was primarily due to our continued shift in\n\nrevenue mix toward our lower-margin products and the continued pricing pressure\n\nseen from competitors in certain product areas.\n\nR&D expenses in fiscal 1999 were $1.66 billion, compared with $1.05 billion in\n\nfiscal 1998, an increase of 58.1%. R&D expenses, as a percentage of net sales,\n\nincreased to 13.7% in fiscal 1999, compared with 12.4% in fiscal 1998. The\n\nincrease reflected our ongoing R&D efforts in a wide variety of areas such as\n\ndata, voice, and video integration, DSL technologies, cable modem technology,\n\nwireless access, dial access, enterprise switching, security, network\n\nmanagement, and high-end routing technologies, among others. A significant\n\nportion of the increase was due to the addition of new personnel, partly through\n\nacquisitions, as well as higher expenditures on prototypes and depreciation on\n\nadditional lab equipment.\n\nSales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1999 were $2.46 billion, compared with\n\n$1.58 billion in fiscal 1998, an increase of 56.1%. Sales and marketing\n\nexpenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 20.2% in fiscal 1999,\n\ncompared with 18.6% in fiscal 1998. The increase was principally due to an\n\nincrease in the size of our direct sales force and related commissions,\n\ntelevision advertising campaigns to build brand awareness, additional marketing\n\nand advertising costs associated with the introduction\n\n34\n\n35\n\nof new products, and the expansion of distribution channels. The increase also\n\nreflected our efforts to invest in certain key areas, such as expansion of our\n\nend-to-end networking strategy and service provider coverage, in order to be\n\npositioned to take advantage of future market opportunities.\n\nG&A expenses in fiscal 1999 were $381 million, compared with $247 million in\n\nfiscal 1998, an increase of 54.3%. G&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales,\n\nincreased to 3.1% in fiscal 1999, compared with 2.9% in fiscal 1998. The\n\nincrease was primarily related to additional personnel and acquisition-related\n\ncosts of $16 million.\n\nAmortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets included in operating\n\nexpenses was $61 million in fiscal 1999, compared with $23 million in fiscal\n\n1998. Amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets increased as we\n\nacquired companies and technologies.\n\nInterest and other income, net, in fiscal 1999 was $330 million, compared with\n\n$196 million in fiscal 1998. Interest income rose primarily as a result of\n\nadditional investment income on our increased investment balances.\n\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nIn June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Statement\n\nof Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, \"Accounting for Derivative\n\nInstruments and Hedging Activities\" (\"SFAS 133\"). SFAS 133, as amended,\n\nestablishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and\n\nhedging activities. It requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either\n\nassets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair\n\nvalue. We do not expect the initial adoption of SFAS 133 to have a material\n\neffect on our operations or financial position. We are required to adopt SFAS\n\n133 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2001.\n\nIn September 1999, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force Topic No. D-83,\n\n\"Accounting for Payroll Taxes Associated with Stock Option Exercises\" (\"EITF\n\nD-83\"). EITF D-83 requires that payroll tax paid on the difference between the\n\nexercise price and the fair value of acquired stock in association with an\n\nemployee's exercise of stock options be recorded as operating expenses. Payroll\n\ntax on stock option exercises of $51 million was expensed in fiscal 2000.\n\nIn December 1999, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, \"Revenue\n\nRecognition in Financial Statements\" (\"SAB 101\"). SAB 101, as amended,\n\nsummarizes certain of the SEC's views in applying generally accepted accounting\n\nprinciples to revenue\n\n35\n\n36\n\nrecognition in financial statements. At this time, we do not expect the adoption\n\nof SAB 101 to have a material effect on our operations or financial position;\n\nhowever, the SEC's final guidance for implementation has not been released to\n\ndate. We are required to adopt SAB 101 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001.\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and investments were $20.50\n\nbillion at July 29, 2000, an increase of $10.28 billion from July 31, 1999. The\n\nincrease was primarily a result of $5.00 billion of net unrealized gains on\n\npublicly held investments and $7.70 billion of cash generated by operating and\n\nfinancing activities partially offset by investing activities, including net\n\ncapital expenditures of $1.09 billion, purchases of technology licenses of $444\n\nmillion, and investments in lease receivables of $535 million.\n\nAccounts receivable increased 83.9% during fiscal 2000. Days sales outstanding\n\nin receivables increased to 37 days for fiscal 2000, from 32 days for fiscal\n\n1999. The increase in accounts receivable and days sales outstanding was due, in\n\npart, to growth in total net sales combined with conditions in a number of\n\nmarkets, resulting in longer payment terms.\n\nInventories increased 87.2% during fiscal 2000; however, inventory turns\n\nremained constant at 7.8 times. The increase in inventory levels reflected new\n\nproduct introductions, continued growth in our two-tier distribution system, and\n\nincreased purchases to secure the supply of certain components. Inventory\n\nmanagement remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic\n\ninventory levels to ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory\n\nobsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements.\n\nAt July 29, 2000, we had a line of credit totaling $500 million, which expires\n\nin July 2002. There have been no borrowings under this agreement (see Note 7 to\n\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nWe have entered into several agreements to lease 448 acres of land located in\n\nSan Jose, California, where our headquarters operations are established, and 759\n\nacres of land located in Boxborough, Massachusetts; Salem, New Hampshire;\n\nRichardson, Texas; and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, where we have\n\nexpanded certain R&D and customer-support activities. In connection with these\n\ntransactions, we have pledged $1.29 billion of our investments as collateral for\n\ncertain obligations of the leases. We anticipate that we will occupy more leased\n\nproperty in the future that will require similar pledged securities; however, we\n\ndo not expect the impact of this activity to be material to\n\n36\n\n37\n\nour liquidity position (see Note 8 to Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments,\n\nline of credit, and cash generated from operations will satisfy our expected\n\nworking capital, capital expenditure, and investment requirements through at\n\nleast the next 12 months.\n\n37\n\n38\n\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nWe maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities.\n\nThese securities are generally classified as available for sale and,\n\nconsequently, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized\n\ngains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other\n\ncomprehensive income, net of tax. Part of this portfolio includes minority\n\nequity investments in several publicly traded companies, the values of which are\n\nsubject to market price volatility. For example, as a result of recent market\n\nprice volatility of our publicly traded equity investments, we experienced a\n\n$111 million after-tax unrealized loss during the third quarter of fiscal 2000\n\nand a $1.83 billion after-tax unrealized gain during the fourth quarter of\n\nfiscal 2000 on these investments. We have also invested in numerous privately\n\nheld companies, many of which can still be considered in the start-up or\n\ndevelopment stages. These investments are inherently risky as the market for the\n\ntechnologies or products they have under development are typically in the early\n\nstages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire initial investment in\n\nthese companies. We also have certain real estate lease commitments with\n\npayments tied to short-term interest rates. At any time, a sharp rise in\n\ninterest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our\n\ninvestment portfolio while increasing the costs associated with our lease\n\ncommitments. Conversely, declines in interest rates could have a material impact\n\non interest earnings for our investment portfolio. We do not currently hedge\n\nthese interest rate exposures.\n\n38\n\n39\n\nINVESTMENTS\n\nThe following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values in the\n\nfinancial instruments held at July 29, 2000 that are sensitive to changes in\n\ninterest rates. These instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes\n\nother than trading. The modeling technique used measures the change in fair\n\nvalues arising from selected potential changes in interest rates. Market changes\n\nreflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or\n\nminus 50 basis points (\"BPS\"), 100 BPS, and 150 BPS over a 12-month horizon.\n\nBeginning fair values represent the principal plus accrued interest and\n\ndividends of the interest rate-sensitive financial instruments at July 29, 2000.\n\nEnding fair values are the market principal plus accrued interest, dividends,\n\nand reinvestment income at a 12-month horizon. The following table estimates the\n\nfair value of the portfolio at a 12-month horizon (in millions):\n\nValuation of Securities Valuation of Securities\n\nGiven an Interest Rate Fair Value Given an Interest Rate\n\nDecrease of X Basis Points as of Increase of X Basis Points\n\nIssuer (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) July 29,2000 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS\n\n- ------ --------- --------- -------- ------------ ------ ------- -------\n\nU.S. government notes and bonds $2,350 $2,329 $2,307 $2,285 $2,262 $2,240 $2,218\n\nState, municipal, and county\n\ngovernment notes and bonds 3,666 3,632 3,598 3,564 3,529 3,494 3,459\n\nCorporate notes and bonds 3,296 3,266 3,235 3,204 3,173 3,141 3,110\n\n------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------\n\nTotal $9,312 $9,227 $9,140 $9,053 $8,964 $8,875 $8,787\n\n====== ====== ====== ====== ====== ====== ======\n\nA 50 BPS move in the Federal Funds Rate has occurred in nine of the last 10\n\nyears; a 100 BPS move in the Federal Funds Rate has occurred in six of the last\n\n10 years; and a 150 BPS move in the Federal Funds Rate has occurred in four of\n\nthe last 10 years.\n\nThe following analysis presents the hypothetical changes in fair values of\n\npublic equity investments that are sensitive to changes in the stock market.\n\nThese equity securities are held for purposes other than trading. The modeling\n\ntechnique used measures the hypothetical change in fair values arising from\n\nselected hypothetical changes in each stock's price. Stock price fluctuations of\n\nplus or minus 15%, plus or minus 35%, and plus or minus 50% were selected based\n\non the probability of their occurrence.\n\n39\n\n40\n\nThe following table estimates the fair value of the publicly traded corporate\n\nequities at a 12-month horizon (in millions):\n\nValuation of Securities Valuation of Securities\n\nGiven X% Decrease Given X% Increase\n\nin Each Stock's Price Fair Value in Each Stock's Price\n\n-------------------------------------- as of ----------------------------------\n\n(50%) (35%) (15%) July 29, 2000 15% 35% 50%\n\n----------- ----------- ---------- -------------- ---------- ----------- --------\n\nCorporate equities $3,112 $4,046 $5,291 $6,225 $7,159 $8,404 $9,337\n\nOur equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most\n\nclosely match the S&P Index or companies traded on the NASDAQ National Market.\n\nThe NASDAQ Composite Index has shown a 15% movement in each of the last three\n\nyears and a 35% and 50% movement in at least one of the last three years.\n\nWe also have an investment in KPMG Consulting, Inc. in the principal amount of\n\n$1.05 billion of Series A Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock,\n\nwhich carries a 6% dividend rate on the original issue price until converted to\n\ncommon stock. Conversion is at our option upon or after the completion of an\n\ninitial public offering of KPMG Consulting, Inc. We have not included the\n\ninvestment in the above sensitivity analyses due to the nature of this\n\ninvestment.\n\n40\n\n41\n\nLEASES\n\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk associated with leases on our facilities\n\nwhere payments are tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"). We have\n\nevaluated the hypothetical change in lease obligations held at July 29, 2000 due\n\nto changes in the LIBOR. The modeling technique used measures hypothetical\n\nchanges in lease obligations arising from selected hypothetical changes in the\n\nLIBOR. The hypothetical market changes reflected immediate parallel shifts in\n\nthe LIBOR curve of plus or minus 50 BPS, 100 BPS, and 150 BPS over a 12-month\n\nperiod. The results of this analysis were not material in comparison to our\n\nfinancial results.\n\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS\n\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the impact of\n\ncurrency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities,\n\nprimarily denominated in Australian, Canadian, Japanese, Korean, and several\n\nEuropean currencies, primarily the euro and British pound. We also periodically\n\nhedge anticipated transactions with purchased currency options.\n\nThe foreign exchange forward and option contracts we enter into generally have\n\noriginal maturities ranging from one to three months. We do not enter into\n\nforeign exchange forward and option contracts for trading purposes. We do not\n\nexpect gains or losses on these contracts to have a material impact on our\n\nfinancial results (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n41\n\n42\n\nITEM 8.
