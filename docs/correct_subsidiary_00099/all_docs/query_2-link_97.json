Academic literature exists that discusses digital convergence in various domains. Although UC has received considerable attention in the business press, we are not aware of any academic study within the domain of UC that explains the convergence of platforms and its links to the technology strategy of UC firms. This thesis presents an academic analysis of some platforms underlying UC and the emerging strategies of two software firms within the UC market. The theory of network effects originally developed by Rohlfs is central to the analysis in this thesis. The analysis of platform strategies of the UC firms is informed by the theoretical work on platform leadership (Gawer & Cusumano), convergence (Greenstein et al.), platform envelopment (Eisenmann et al.), and two-sided platforms (Tirole et al.).\n\nThe thesis first describes four platform applications underlying UC viz. voice telephony, email, IM, and video communication. The analysis of email, IM and video communication in this thesis is unique as it takes a long term view to explain the current market situation within these domains. In particular, the thesis describes technological factors, network effects, standard battles, and competition that have led to the current market state. The thesis also links insights from these platforms to repercussions for UC supplier firms.\n\nThe thesis then describes the strategies of two software vendors - Microsoft and IBM - using elements from Gawer & Cusumanos work on platform leadership. Microsoft has defined a broad scope of innovation for its converged UC platform requiring it to enter the voice telephony market. The thesis posits that Microsofts strategy for success is platform envelopment i.e. Microsoft is using shared components and installed user base from its email and IM platforms to create a multi-platform bundle and compete with entrenched platforms in the voice market. The thesis argues that IBMs choice for a narrower platform scope stems from its inferior market position in the email and IM markets as well as scope differences (vis-à-vis Microsoft). Convergence has created system integration opportunities that IBMs services unit has targeted. The thesis describes the implications of IBMs decisions on its ecosystem.\n\nThesis Advisor: Professor Erik Brynjolfsson\n\nTitle: Schussel Professor of Management\n\nTo my parents, Mrs. Razia Hydari and Mr. Imam Hydari\n\nTo my wife, Hajar and sons, Omar and Sohaib\n\nTo my sister Asma Abdullah\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nI would like to thank my thesis advisor Professor Erik Brynjolfsson who has provided guidance and support throughout the course of my thesis research.

The analysis of UC is complicated because of the rapid co-evolution of technology and demand. The analysis is further complicated by the fact that UC is driven by technological convergence of network platforms that has led to changes in the boundaries of existing firms and hitherto distinct industries. The current market situation is fluid as the firms grapple with the following question:\n\n·What should be UCs value proposition that appeals to large market segments\n\n·What should be the scope of activities and products of a firm\n\n·Given that dominant players exist in constituent products, should a firm develop a complete offering by itself or with partners? If it is the latter, what criteria should firms use to choose partners\n\n·How should firms respond to changes associated with convergence, such as changes in the identity of their competition or changes in users expectations about product functionality and price\n\nScholars have proposed and developed theories about issues around technology, market and firm strategy that underlie the questions faced by firms in the UC market space. The study of convergence is intellectually challenging as convergence patterns display immense variety and it is difficult to construct general analytical frameworks that can adequately explain every example of convergence.\n\nThe research objectives for this thesis were:\n\n1.To study select platforms  voice telephony, email, instant messaging, video communication - that underlie UC pre-convergence and draw insights about the effects of technology, compatibility standards, and network effects on these platforms and use these insights to explain the market situation and implications for UC\n\n2.To describe the emerging platform strategies of two large software vendors, viz. IBM and Microsoft, within the domain of UC\n\n1.2Thesis Outline\n\nChapter 2 summarizes the academic frameworks that are useful in describing the UC market. Most of these frameworks will be familiar to a student of technology strategy but the chapter provides a refresher. It also establishes the meaning of technical terms that I use in later chapters. For those who are not familiar with any of these frameworks, I have included references that can provide more detailed explanations.\n\nChapter 3 defines Unified Communication and Collaboration (UC) for the purpose of this thesis. As UC is a nascent market, point-of-views about UC differ. Chapter 3 also describes the evolution of platforms underlying UC - email, instant messaging, voice telephony, and video communication - to draw insights about the effects of technology, compatibility standards, and networks effects on these platforms\n\nChapter 4 describes Microsofts UC strategy. It provides a brief overview of the company and then describes Microsofts platform strategy within the UC space. Chapter 4 posits that Microsoft has been utilizing platform envelopment to succeed in the UC space.\n\nChapter 5 describes IBMs UC strategy. It provides a brief overview of the company and then describes IBMs high level vision and platform strategy within the UC space.\n\nChapter 6 provides a summary of the thesis and conclusions that can be drawn from the study.\n\n2Relevant Analytical Frameworks\n\nThe following sections summarize the work of some scholars that I felt would be relevant to the study of UC market. I intend to use portions of these theories to describe the UC market and the strategies of two software vendors. The following sections also serve to define and explain technical terms that I will use in later chapters.\n\n2.1Bandwagon Effects\n\nJeffrey Rohlfs performed seminal work on bandwagon effects (also known as network effects) within telecommunication and high technology industries    . Rohlfs recent book summarizes the economic theory behind bandwagon effects and provides business case studies that illustrate bandwagon effects. The examples presented in his book range from facsimile to the internet.\n\nThe Oxford dictionary defines bandwagon as an activity or cause that has suddenly become fashionable or popular ascribing the origin of the word to the former use of a wagon to carry a band in a parade . Rohlfs defines bandwagon effects as: a benefit that a person enjoys as a result of others doing the same thing that he or she does.\n\nThus, bandwagon effects are demand side increasing returns that result from users adopting a particular product . The mere fact that others have adopted a product increases the utility or value of the product for the existing user base.\n\nThese positive feedback effects present in bandwagon products can strongly affect outcomes in a competitive situation. For example, two videocassette standards viz. VHS and Betamax competed in the market place. Betamax was reputed to have better picture quality whereas VHS had longer recording and running time. Video rental stores became the primary direct customers for videocassettes. Rental stores carried both VHS and Betamax for a while but ultimately rental stores standardized on VHS tapes as more and more customers bought VHS recorder and players for recording television programs. So the end users could only get the fashionable VHS tapes even if they found Betamax to be of superior picture quality. VHS won the battle not because of an absolute technical superiority but because of indirect bandwagon effects emanating from consumers adoption of VHS recorder for television recording.\n\nTypes of Bandwagon Effects\n\nBandwagon effects can be of two types:\n\nTable 1 : Types of bandwagon effects\n\nBandwagon Effects  Critical Mass and the Bootstrap Problem\n\nProducts that are subject to bandwagon effects need to attain critical mass before the value delivered is large enough to entice users. This poses a particular bootstrap problem  how to build an initial user set that can propel the product to success. Thus firms dealing with bandwagon products need to consciously solve the bootstrap problem. Some of the steps that firms have taken to solve the bootstrap problem include:\n\n·Costly customer acquisition strategies such as penetration pricing or subsidies for marquee users for exclusive access\n\n·Management of the provision of complementary products\n\n·Agreement between rival firms for compatibility standard\n\nBandwagon Effects and Interlinking\n\nConsumers of products within a product category such as instant messaging may enjoy bandwagon effects with (1) all consumers using the product as supplied by the same vendor, or (2) all consumers using any product within the category and supplied by any vendor.\n\nFor bandwagon benefits to accrue to all users irrespective of their supplier, the products must be interlinked. In case of communication products like instant messaging, subject to direct network effects, this is achieved by interlinking. Usually the suppliers of the communication service work together to enable the interlinking:\n\nMicrosoft agreed to interlink its enterprise instant messaging (EIM) product with consumer instant messaging products provided by AOL, MSN, and Yahoo!. This interlinking enabled users of Microsofts enterprise instant messaging product access to approximately 400 million users within the AOL, MSN and Yahoo! Consumer IM networks (circa July 2004) . The EIM product did not complete directly with the consumer IM products.\n\nHowever, Yahoo and Microsoft also agreed to interlink their respective consumer instant messaging service, creating a combined user community of 350 million users worldwide (circa July 2006) . This interlinking of competing networks immensely benefited the users of both IM networks by increasing their reach from a single user interface.\n\nInterlinking also benefits where there are complementary bandwagon effects. This is usually achieved through compatibility standards that competing products agree to honor thereby allowing complementary products to work with all base products. For example, the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) standard although developed initially by Intel, was eventually adopted by Sun and Macintosh. All computer platforms (Macintosh, Sun, Wintel and so on) were then able to benefit from peripheral components produced for the standard PCI; and peripheral suppliers found it advantageous to develop using PCI because it ensured wider reach for them.\n\nDynamics of Complementary Bandwagon Effects\n\nAn important difference between network externalities and complementary bandwagon effects is that the latter usually has a longer lag time before users experience increase in returns. An instant messaging user who joins an IM network immediately benefits from the existing user base and vice versa. But consider the complementary bandwagon effects associated with videocassette recorder and the VHS vs. Betamax competition as an example. There will be some time lag between increased demand for a particular product and the production of complementary products. So the users decision to buy a particular product is complex  they may buy one particular product but demand may not grow enough for the product to foster the production of complementary goods. In such cases, other benefits of the products or even perception about who will win can produce bandwagon effects for one good. In case of VHS vs. Betamax, VHS was able to build initial installed base because users could use VHS longer recording time to record television program. This in turn made it more profitable for rental video shops to carry VHS tapes.\n\nRecent Case Study  Bandwagon Effects Decide Blu-Ray vs. HD DVD Battle\n\nIn a more recent battle between two rival high definition digital video disc (DVD) - Blu-ray vs. HD DVD (backed by Sony and Toshiba respectively)  Blu-ray was able to win the battle because Sony was able to win exclusive contracts with major DVD manufacturers such as Philips, Pioneer, Panasonic and so on. This contributed to convincing media companies such as Warner Brothers, retailers like Wal-Mart and video rental stores such as Netflix and Blockbuster to back the Blu-ray format. Sony was also able to build an initial installed base by bundling Blu-ray into its Playstation 3 video game console. The research firm IDC reported that the cheapest Blu-ray player on the market was actually the Playstation 3 . Sony used bundling i.e. Blu-ray players along with Playstation 3 to create an installed base for its Blu-ray technology.\n\n2.2Competitive Strategy as Ecology\n\nJames Moore introduced an ecological perspective to competitive analysis especially within the domain of high technology . Marco Iansiti et al further developed the ecological paradigm into a strategic framework for analysis,.\n\nThe Oxford Dictionary defines ecosystem as a biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment . The Encyclopedia Britannica summarizes ecosystems as the complex of living organisms, their physical environment, and all their interrelationships in a particular unit of space . The emphases that one must note are:\n\n·A holistic view of the organisms and their environment in a particular unit of space\n\n·The interrelationships and the interactions amongst organisms and between organisms and environment\n\nParticipants in a biological ecosystem not only depend on each other but also share fate. If the overall health of the ecosystem deteriorates, all ecosystem participants suffer.\n\nBusiness Ecosystems\n\nBusiness ecosystems are a loose network of suppliers, distributors, outsourcing firms, makers of related products or services, technology services and a host of other organizations that together bring a product or service to market. The other organizations may include customers, competitors, capital providers, the government and so on if any of their actions have an effect on how you develop and market a particular product.\n\nA broad definition such as the one given above can over complicate analysis by introducing too many players and very complex set of relationships. Analysis can be made tractable by focusing on the firms that have the strongest dependencies and thus the strongest effects on your business. It may also be helpful to partition the ecosystem into business domains  groups of firms that compete in the same product category.\n\nFor a firm to be successful, each critical domain within its ecosystem should be healthy. Thus Microsoft cannot be successful unless the critical domains of system integrators and independent software vendors who participate in its ecosystem are healthy. One can sense a two-way causal relation between the success of Microsoft and the success of its business ecosystem  so Microsoft (and other firms in general) needs to think about and manage not only their own business but also the network or ecosystem around them.\n\nTaking a broader ecosystem view is more important today than perhaps the early part of the twentieth century because business structure has transformed from vertically integrated companies (such as IBM, Ford and DuPont in the early 20th century) to networks of companies banding together to provide a product or service (e.g. Dell, Intel and Microsoft).\n\nInsights from an Ecological Perspective of Strategy and Competition\n\nThe key insights derived by using ecology to understand firm strategy are:\n\n·Businesses should not be merely concerned about narrowly defined industry segments in which they operate but about the whole range of complex relationships ranging from capital providers, suppliers of intermediate goods, technology providers, complementary goods producers (complementors), customers, competitors and so on. Businesses may organize themselves into different communities or ecosystems and the competitive battle may largely take place between competing ecosystems rather than merely firms.\n\n·Businesses especially high technology businesses go through co-evolution so that changes introduced in the system by one party causes other interdependent parties to evolve. For example, the introduction of a technological innovation within a product space by one firm may cause:\n\n·Demand evolution such that consumers not only wholeheartedly adopt the innovation for the originally intended application but also for unintended applications which further spurs innovation\n\n·Evolution of competitive technologies as a response which in turn requires a counter-response\n\n·Evolution within complementary products which then feeds into the evolution of the original product\n\n·Like natural ecosystems, businesses ecosystems can be profoundly affected by the changes in environment. Too radical a change in the environment may cause business ecosystems to collapse as in natural ecosystems. Technological change can be the root cause for such radical change is some cases but often it is the poor handling of firm interrelationship or exploitation by dominant firms in the ecosystem that may lead to the collapse of the ecosystem.\n\n·Successful firms may not necessarily have the best R&D in their area but they are able to leverage and contribute to their business ecosystem, integrate well across firm boundaries, and integrate innovations well into their existing assets.\n\n·In the face of changes in environment, successful firms are able to sift out legacy assets that are likely to survive and combine these assets with the innovations to deal with the change.\n\n·Incumbents can evolve rather than be disrupted if they build capabilities around systematic consideration of ecosystem, defining the right architecture and integrating innovations into their legacy assets, capabilities and processes.\n\n2.2.1Evolutionary Stages of Business Ecosystems\n\nBusiness ecosystems may form as a result of technological innovation. Firms participating in these business ecosystems need to match their strategies and actions with the evolutionary stage of the ecosystem. Figure 1 summarizes one evolutionary path that a business ecosystem may take:\n\nFigure 1 : Evolutionary stages of business ecosystems\n\nFirms need to recognize what evolutionary stage of the business ecosystem they find themselves in, and act accordingly. Moreover, firms need to think about cooperation and competition with respect to all organizations that affect their business ecosystems rather than narrowly focusing on immediate customers, suppliers and competitors.\n\nIt must be emphasized that this is one possible evolutionary path not the only path. Mature ecosystems may be threatened by other ecosystems or innovations. They may also face changes in environment such as regulatory changes , macroeconomic changes or customer behavior changes. Missteps can lead to the death of the business ecosystem as happened with New Englands ice harvesting ecosystem of the nineteenth century .\n\n2.2.2Measures of Ecosystem Health\n\nMeasures of ecosystem health can be useful for comparative purposes  comparison between measures of rival ecosystems or changes in the measures over time. Like natural ecosystems, healthier business ecosystems are able to efficiently convert input to output (productivity), to withstand perturbations in the environment (robustness) and foster variety within the ecosystem (niche creation).\n\nProductivity\n\nThis is the ability of the ecosystem to effectively convert innovation into lowered costs and new products for the ecosystem. The following could be used as measures:\n\n·Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\n\n·Change in ROIC over time\n\n·Time to adoption of innovation\n\nFor example, Figure 2 compares the relative productivity of three business ecosystems:\n\nFigure 2 : Relative productivity of three business ecosystems\n\n[Source: (Iansiti, et al., 2004)]\n\nRobustness\n\nThis is the ability of the ecosystem to survive perturbation in the environment such as regulatory, technological or macroeconomic shocks. The following could be used as measures:\n\n·Survival rates of firms\n\n·Persistence of structure i.e. how stable are the inter-relationship between various firms within the ecosystem over time\n\nFigure 3 compares the robustness of three business ecosystems:\n\nFigure 3: Relative robustness of three business ecosystems\n\n[Source: (Iansiti, et al., 2004)]\n\nNiche Creation\n\nThis is the ability to foster the growth of functions or applications within the ecosystem. This could be measured by:\n\n·Growth of new firms\n\n·Growth in product or technical variety\n\n2.2.3Ecosystem Strategies\n\nFirms can choose operating strategies based on the resources and capabilities they possess. However, firms also need to align their strategies to those of the firms around them in the ecosystem and the environment. The following are some operating strategies that firms can adopt:\n\nKeystones\n\nThese are firms that occupy a hub in the network of firms by possessing a unique capability or asset that is needed by many other firms in the ecosystem. Instead of exploiting this advantage narrowly, keystones share the value broadly to improve the overall health of the ecosystem. This feeds back into the success of the keystones, who are usually able to capture superior value compared to other ecosystem firms.\n\nThe sharing of value is thus not altruistic but leads to self enriching consequence. It must be noted that keystones may have to regulate ecosystem even to the point of predatory behavior to improve the overall health of the ecosystem. Boudreau argues that platform suppliers (equivalent to keystones is some cases) may have to regulate or even thwart complementor entry to improve the overall health of the ecosystem.\n\nPhysical Dominators\n\nThese are firms that have unique assets or capabilities and use these advantages to take over most functions in the ecosystem through vertical and horizontal integration. Integrated firms of early twentieth century are good examples for physical dominators.\n\nValue Dominators (or Hub Landlords)\n\nThese firms use a unique advantage to capture more value than they create themselves. This is an inherently unstable strategy and leads to the ultimate destruction of the ecosystem.\n\nNiche Players\n\nThese firms provide specialized functions such that the value they create and the number of relations they have are a small percentage of the overall ecosystem. However as a group, niche players constitute bulk of the ecosystem.\n\nNiche players leverage keystone contributions to provide a highly differentiated function. Niche players not only face threats from direct competitors but also from keystones  if the functions that niche players provide are at the periphery of keystone functions, they may get absorbed into the keystone. To sustain themselves, niche players need to remain ahead through innovation, specialize further or move to different function.\n\nFigure 4: Sustaining a niche strategy\n\n2.2.4Foundations  Architecture, Integration and Market Management\n\nThe operating strategies of firms are undergirded by architecture of the firm, its integration capability and its management of the market. These are the foundation over which the operating strategies are built.\n\nArchitecture\n\nArchitecture defines how the firm draws its boundaries with regards to technologies, products and organizations. This determines what innovation will be carried out within the firm and what will be leveraged from the ecosystem. Architecture also defines how and with whom the firm will interact to fulfill its mission.\n\nKeystone firms owe their hub position to the ability to uniquely solve a common problem. The sharing of this solution is usually accomplished through a platform to which other ecosystem firms can connect. Well designed platforms usually hide the way they have implemented the solution but make the interface widely known. The hiding of implementation is not merely to protect a trade secret but to allow keystone to change the implementation without affecting the interfaces and the interfacing firms.\n\nPlatforms have the tendency to prey on niche firm innovation that has become a common solution to its client firms. This may appear as harmful domination that reduces surplus although speciously at times.\n\nIansiti et al have provided guidance for managing platforms as well as managing products that use platforms. The following table summarizes the guidance provided by Iansiti et al:\n\nTable 2: Guidance for managing platform vs. product\n\n[Adapted from (Iansiti, et al., 2004)]\n\nIntegration\n\nIntegration defines how organizations collaborate  both inter-firm and intra-firm collaboration. Integration entails organizations sharing data, capabilities, technological components, or intellectual property.\n\nIntegration could be a combination of capabilities across organizational boundaries (internal/external divide) or a combination of old capabilities with new (legacy/innovation divide). Cisco was able to able to enter the Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) market by leveraging its existing router and combining it with radio technology from Broadcom and ESP. Cisco was then able to capture a major market share from the then strong incumbent Motorola.\n\nMarket Management\n\nTraditional markets are simpler than the markets that manage transactions between domains within a business ecosystem. Ecosystem marketplaces often connect multiple domains and may subsidize particular domains to increase the overall health of the ecosystem. For example, Microsoft Windows group links together consumers and the thousands of the application developers for the Windows operating system. Microsofts success depends on the provision of large number of high quality applications for its operating system. Thus it provides access to Application Programming Interface (APIs) and development tools at very low costs to developers .\n\n2.3Platform Strategies and Platform Leaders\n\nGreenstein defines platforms as a cluster of technically standardized components that buyers use together with components to make applications . Platforms provide solutions to common problems in a particular domain. Platforms also make it easy for others to interface with and re-use these solutions. Products that use established platforms are usually easier to develop as they can leverage the solutions that platforms have provided. These products may also reap scale economies as the platform development costs are amortized over several different products .\n\nIn the automotive industry, platforms are a group of components primarily the floor and inner body structure that can then be used with a range of engines and transmissions to create different vehicles. Automotive platforms thus help increase variety by cutting cost and reducing development time .\n\nA computing platform such as Microsoft Windows allows innovation because it abstracts the computing hardware and also facilitates applications development through its vast library of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). In the computing and communication industries, a platform is usually developed by one firm or very few firms while complements for that platform are developed by many firms.\n\nA firm that provides at least one core solution that is valuable, rare and easy to interface with can aspire to become a platform leader. Platform leaders use their core solution to drive industry wide innovation by managing and fostering the provision of complements.\n\n2.3.1The Four Levers of Platform Leadership\n\nScope\n\nScope is the locus of innovation that a platform leader has ascribed to itself, leaving the rest of the innovation to complementor firms. Scope determines what complements will be developed in-house by the platform leader versus letting the complementors develop them outside.\n\nScope Determinants: Scope decisions are driven not only by the resources and capabilities of the firm (financial, technical, and organizational) but also by the dynamics of the complementary bandwagon effects. If the platform is highly dependent on a particular complement to solve the startup problem, the platform leader may need to develop the complement in-house.\n\nSignaling Scope to Market: Platform leaders can signal to the market if they intend to leave a complementary product space to other firms. Intel chooses a complementor with good potential and openly helps the complementor to succeed in the space. Intel calls this scope signaling mechanism rabbit strategy .\n\nProduct Technology\n\nPlatform leaders decision about scope leads to a high level architecture for the platform  what solutions will be available within the platform, what will be the structure of the components, how will intellectual property get shared with external firms and how will complementors interface with the platform.\n\nModular vs. Integrated: An important distinction is whether the architecture is modular vs. integrated. Modular architectures are achieved by partitioning the platform into sub-systems and connecting the pieces together using well define interfaces. This allows for independent technological evolution of components while keeping the architecture intact as long as the interface definitions are adhered.\n\nInformation & Access to Interfaces: Platform leaders need to control the amount of information they reveal through interfaces and also who has access to these interfaces. Revealing too much information can open the platform leader to substitution attacks. Providing open access to all interfaces may create too much competition in the complementary goods space, dissuading complementors from innovating in adjacent markets .\n\nProprietary vs. Standard Interface: Platform leaders also need to decide if they will use proprietary interfaces or adhere to industry standard interfaces. Proprietary interfaces may allow dominant platform leaders to capture superior returns as the switching costs for complementors will be high. However, adhering to industry standard interface can help solve the startup problem with installed base as well as encourage innovation within complementary products. Competing platform will have to share the value albeit the value created might be larger.\n\nRelationship with External Complementors\n\nPlatform leaders need to manage both collaboration and competition with complementors. Platform leaders need to work with complementors in trying to establish interfaces to ensure that the platform and complements work together smoothly  today and as the product and platform evolves. Platform leaders need to exercise ecological control  that is they need to lead and control the process by which interfaces are defined and allowed to evolve.\n\nConflicts with Complementors: Platform leaders also need to handle two sources of conflict with complementors. First, complementors will prefer standard interfaces instead of proprietary interfaces to lower their switching costs from one platform to the other. Second, complementors at the periphery of platform scope may get subsumed into the platform in later evolutions. This converts platform leaders relationship with such complementors from collaborators in one era to direct competitors in the next era.\n\nImpact of Platform Expansion: The expansion of platform into complementors territory can have detrimental reputational impact in the long term on the platform leader. Complementors may not want to associate with the platform leader that intrudes and captures complementor space instead aligning themselves with rival platforms. However, there are times when such an expansion is necessary - for example, when the complementors service also solves a widely faced core problem or when the complementor poses a threat to the platform leader of eventual substitution.\n\nInternal Organization\n\nPlatform leaders are often confronted with co-opetition i.e. i.e. having to compete and cooperate at the same time with other firms. This requires that platform leader organize internally to facilitate interactions with complementors.\n\nOrganization Structure: Platform leaders may organize groups with similar goals under one executive. However, groups may need to be organized into separate departments if they have conflicting goals or outside constituencies to serve. To generate trust amongst complementors, platform leaders might visibly erect Chinese wall amongst departments - where one department collaborates and the other competes with these complementors.\n\nOrganization Culture and Processes: Platform leaders may also need to establish formal processes such as arbitration by senior management when conflicts arise between departments. Decision making process that includes debate on maximizing long term value for the firm rather than letting powerful groups have their way is also beneficial.\n\n2.3.2Establishing Platform Leadership\n\nPlatform-Leader Wannabes - Choosing Product vs. Platform\n\nAs mentioned earlier, platforms provide solutions to one or more core problems facing business ecosystem. The platform should be easy to connect to and build upon so that complementors can innovate in the complement product space.\n\nA firm that can solve a core problem also needs to think about other issues before embarking on a platform strategy. There issues include:\n\n·Capability to evolve the platform along with technology\n\n·Capability to come up with the right architecture and the interfaces that can be used by complementors\n\n·Capability to organize internally so that conflicts between internal firm groups and external complementors are adequately handled\n\n·Capability to entice complementors to become users of firms platform\n\nCoring  Creating a Platform De Novo\n\nA firm could solve a fundamental problem facing a business ecosystem but to be successful in coring i.e. creating a new platform, the firms innovation should have strong appropriability, and inimitability . This may initially come from technology superiority but may sustain itself through strong network effects or high switching costs. Otherwise, the firm will not be able to protect its share of the value in the business ecosystem.\n\nThe coring firm must also facilitate complementors by at least providing easy to use interfaces to the platform. Large firms may even be able to share their complementary assets  manufacturing, distribution, service, marketing, finance, and complementary technologies  to strengthen the complementors in their business ecosystem.\n\nThe coring firm should also create tight coupling with complementors. This coupling could be achieved by using proprietary interfaces to the platform so that platform migration is difficult. Coupling can also be created by other means such as making the complementor dependent on coring firms complementary assets.\n\nTipping  Winning the Platform Battle\n\nTipping is the activity by which platform-leader wannabes tilt the market in the favor of their platform. On the demand side, platform-leader wannabes should focus on user base and complementors. Firms could capture a large installed base perhaps by absorbing initial losses from costly customer acquisition tactics. Firms could also facilitate complementors to use their platform by providing easy to use interfaces. Complementors could also be enticed by sharing more value with them compared to rival platform. On the supply side, platform-leader wannabe could signal through their assemblage of superior complementary assets when compared to rival platforms. For example, Matsushita touted its mass-production facilities to convince videotape developers to commit to VHS.\n\nPlatform envelopment is another way by which platform-leader wannabes can tip the market in their favor. Envelopment essentially uses the firms existing platform leadership in one business domain to envelop another adjacent domain. Platform envelopment is the discussed in more detail in the next section.\n\n2.4Convergence, Bundling, and Platform Envelopment\n\n2.4.1Convergence\n\nConvergence signifies coming together of two different entities. Convergence may be in space as the coming together of Allegheny River and Monongahela River at the center of Pittsburgh to form the Ohio River . Convergence may also result from changes over time  for example, the technological changes that enabled the coming together of wireless phone and music player into a single device such as Apples iPhone.\n\nFor students of management, to study convergence is to study the evolution of boundaries between two or more industries. The most visible convergence today (circa 2008) and most apt to this thesis is the convergence taking place between communications and computers.\n\nTypes of Convergence\n\nConvergence can be of at least three types as discussed below.\n\nConvergence of Substitutes: Convergence can happen when two distinct products may gradually become substitutes.\n\n·Given set of users may find the two products substitutable for growing set of tasks\n\n·Growing set of users may find the two products substitutable for given set of tasks\n\nOver time, one or both of these products may start offering the same benefit to the consumer by acquiring similar feature set. For example, consider the early period of personal computer (circa 1980) and the electric typewriter. The important use cases of personal computers then did not include word processing. However, personal computers shared certain features with the electric typewriter from the very beginning such as the keyboard. With the introduction of good word processing software and quality pc-compatible printers, personal computers converged with the electric typewriter.\n\nConvergence of Complements: Convergence of complements can happen if:\n\n·Two products used together are more valuable to users than used separately.\n\n·Two products evolve such that they are more valuable today than they were previously.\n\nConvergence in complements can then manifest itself as firms may then be able to bundle the two products together to form a larger system. For example, complements - sensors and signal processors - are brought together in modern medical imaging products such as Computerized Topographic (CT) scanner to provide more benefits and value to users .\n\nConvergence of Functionally Unrelated Entities: Convergence can also take place between two functionally unrelated entities i.e. products or services that provide unrelated benefits to users. This may happen when the entities differ in the benefits they offer yet share the same components and user relationships. For example, a music player and mobile phone have been converged although they are functionally unrelated and were once available only as separate products .\n\nConvergence Type Depends on Level of Analysis: Type depends on the level at which we view the convergence. For example, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) deployed on a Wintel personal computer (PC) may be considered convergence in complements. But JVM may also be deployed on Apples Macintosh computer (Mac) or Sun Microsystems workstation (Sun). Thus the following combinations may all be viewed as convergence in substitutes: JVM + PC, JVM + Mac, JVM + Sun.\n\nEconomic Effects of Convergence\n\nAlthough both types of convergence may seem to occur simultaneously if viewed from different levels (component vs. system), clearly understanding the type at a given level helps understand the effects on market structure.\n\nConvergence in substitute usually increases competition and decreases market concentration. For example, the public telephone network and the cable network have converged as substitutes so users have more options for getting their telephone and cable TV subscriptions. Firms facing convergence in substitute may move to control scarce resources or vertically integrate into distribution if a competitor firm controls distribution channel.\n\nConvergence in complements may increase competition at the component level if the complements can interface with core product through an open technical standard. Greenstein et al have discussed the effect of convergence in complement on market structure in more detail .\n\n2.4.2Platform-Mediated Networks and Envelopment\n\nEisenmann et al view of platform is slightly more expansive than taken by some other scholars such as Greenstein or Cusumano. Einsenmann views platforms as:\n\nPlatform encompasses the set of components and rules employed in common in most interactions between network users. Components include hardware, software, and service modules, along with an architecture that specifies how they fit together. Rules encompass information visible to network participants that is used to coordinate their activities. In particular, rules include standards that ensure compatibility between different components; protocols that govern information exchange; policies that constrain network user behavior; and contracts that specify terms of trade and the rights and responsibilities of network participants.\n\nFigure 5: Eisenmann's view of platforms\n\nEntrenched platforms enjoy a huge incumbency advantage because of network effects, switching costs, and endogenous sunk costs. One way for an attacker to succeed in an entrenched platform markets is to create a truly superior platform through discontinuous innovation to replace an incumbents platform. Another way is what Eisenmann et al call platform envelopment .\n\nPlatform Envelopment\n\nPlatform envelopment is an attack by one platform provider into another platform market. The attacker creates a multi-platform bundle by leveraging common technological components and shared user base. Platform envelopment by an attacker makes the incumbents in the target market vulnerable despite any network effects and switching costs and even without the attacker creating a platform that is vastly superior.\n\nRelationships between Platforms\n\nThe following table summarizes some of the relationships between independent platforms arbitrarily named A and B:\n\nTable 3: Relationships between platforms\n\nThe platforms may complement each other reciprocally or unilaterally. Reciprocally specific platforms are those that are mostly deployed together. The use of one of the platform independent of the other is rare. For example:\n\n·Microsoft Windows operating system with Microsoft Office suite\n\n·eBay and PayPal  78% of eBay buyers user PayPal and 70% of PayPal transactions are completed on eBay\n\nReciprocally specific complements exhibit strong negative cross price elasticity.\n\nUnilaterally specific complement platforms are those that have a unilateral relationship i.e. one platform is always deployed with the other but not vice versa. For example:\n\n·Quicken is mostly used on a Windows PC but most Windows users do not own Quicken\n\n·Most eBay users use FedEx or UPS for shipping but most FedEx users are not eBay users\n\nCross price elasticity is one-sided in the case of unilaterally specific platforms  increase in the price of Windows will have a negative effect on the demand for Quicken but not the other way around.\n\n2.4.3Potential Advantages of Platform Envelopment\n\nPrice Discrimination Gains\n\nIf the consumer valuation of individual platforms is negatively correlated or weakly correlated, bundling reduces the variance in the aggregate valuation for the set of platforms. In cases where firms cannot offer different prices for individual platforms based on customer willingness-to-pay, bundling allows price discrimination. Eisenmann et al extend the analysis by Bakos and Brynjolfsson to suggest that bundling will be beneficial when the marginal cost of the two platforms is low compared to the value of the two platforms.\n\nFigure 6: Bundling decision based on value and marginal costs of platforms\n\n(Adapted from Platform Envelopment by Eisenmann et al)\n\nProfit gains through price discrimination are likely to accrue on envelopment if (1) platforms are functionally independent and their use is not strongly correlated (2) platforms are complements but not reciprocally specific complements (3) platforms are weak substitutes but marginal costs are very low (as VA, VB will be low for weak substitutes).\n\nEfficiency Improvements\n\nBundling of platforms can provide economies of scope in marketing, production, operations. Bundling can also improve quality; or increase demand and overall profit by removing high double margins.\n\nEconomies of Scope in Marketing: Bundling may reduce search costs for customers as well as reduce customer acquisition costs for the producers. These benefits can accrue irrespective of the relationship between platforms.\n\nEconomies of Scope in Production and Ongoing Operations: Bundling may decrease production costs because of shared components. These economies are more likely to occur when platform relationship is weak substitutes rather than functionally unrelated or complements.\n\nQuality Advantages: Bundling may result in quality improvements in the case of weak substitutes or reciprocally specific complements.\n\nAvoidance of High Double Margins: Bundling may remove double marginalization if two firms with market power provide reciprocally specific complements.\n\nStrategic Advantages\n\nThrough envelopment, platform providers can gain strategic advantages when attacking another platform or foreclosing an attacker.\n\nExtending Market Power: Envelopment may help increase profits when target platform is reciprocally specific complement or unilaterally specific complement to firms platform. This could choke the complement producer by cutting off demand for complement producer who may find it difficult to cover fixed costs.\n\nForeclosure of Attackers Market: Envelopment may foreclose attackers own market by taking over control of a complement that may be necessary for any rival platform to succeed. Sony was able to gain advantage by enveloping Blu-ray with Playstation 3.\n\nTable 4 links the possible advantages of envelopment with the platform relationships that should be present in the enveloped platforms.\n\nTable 4 : Platform relationships and envelopment benefits\n\n2.4.4Types of Envelopment Attacks\n\nPlatform providers can launch conglomeration attack if the platforms are functionally unrelated, intermodal attack if the platforms are weak substitute or foreclosure attack if the platforms are complements. The table below summarizes the various attack types:\n\nTable 5: Summary of envelopment attacks\n\n[Adapted from (Eisenmann, et al., 2007) page 15]\n\n3Unified Communications & Collaboration  Technologies, Products and Convergence\n\nTelecommunication services and computing are essential to modern business. In United States alone, businesses allocate billions for capital and operational expenditure on communication and computing, expecting a return on their investments through gains in productivity. Communication and computing tools not only allow individual workers to do their jobs more efficiently but also improve business processes through better coordination.\n\nA knowledge worker today uses multiple modes of communication during the course of his or her work day. These may include real-time communication modes such as telephone and instant messaging as well as asynchronous modes such as email and voice mail. However, the various computing, communication, and collaboration applications have hitherto existed largely in separate silos. Knowledge workers spend time juggling through various communication modes and devices that are available to them. There is value to be gained by the integration of these communication and computing applications to create a unified user experience. The industry jargon term for this unification is Unified Communications & Collaboration (UC).\n\nUC can also help speed up business processes by removing human latency  the time that is wasted in reaching the right person for decision making within an organization or in making the actual decision and communicating it to all stakeholders. Although reducing human latency may ultimately be the largest single value of UC, achieving this will require time and effort on the part of businesses. Firms will have to examine their business processes carefully and incorporate UC tools to achieve reduction in human latency. A research study by Brynjolfsson et al suggests that gains in productivity from IT investments depend on complementary organizational investments .\n\n3.1What is Unified Communication & Collaboration\n\nBroadly speaking, UC is the convergence of the computing and communication tools that knowledge workers use in the course of a workday. The question is: what constitutes UC? Technology research firm IDC asserts that enterprises are still not sure as to what constitutes UC,. This can partly be attributed to the newness of the market  birth stage of Moores ecosystem model. Vendors are trying to define benefits that enterprises can gain from UC adoption but also doing it in a way that plays to their strengths or allows them to re-brand their existing product suite as UC product. This has resulted in divergent views and customer confusion.\n\nGiven that some technologies underlying UC are mature and widely deployed across enterprises, businesses are confused as to whose definition they should buy into. For example, networking vendor Cisco places more emphasis on the network, IP PBXs and IP phones within the context of UC. Traditional enterprise telecommunication vendors such as Avaya and Nortel emphasize IP PBX and communication systems integration capabilities. Microsoft and IBM on the other hand place more emphasis on desktop applications such as email, instant messaging and enterprise collaboration tools.\n\nUC Definitions\n\nInstead of focusing on vendor definitions, we could instead start by looking at how some of the well known technology research firms are defining the term. The perspective of these firms is formed not only by looking at a broad range of vendors but also by talking to customers and users.\n\nIDC defines unified communications as solution or platform, accessible through desktop and mobile devices, that combines: unified messaging (email, fax, and voice messages in the same mailbox); advanced IP telephony calling and management; web, audio- and videoconferencing; Instant messaging; and pervasive presence management. In addition, UC applications enable integration with horizontal and vertical industry business processes and applications .\n\nFrost & Sullivan argues for a narrow definition of Unified Communications rather than a broad definition that incorporates all vendors point of views. Frost & Sullivan deems a tighter definition necessary for the term to remain relevant. Otherwise, the term Unified Communication becomes everything and nothing.\n\nFrost & Sullivan defines a unified communications application as an integrated set of voice, data and video communications, all of which leverage PC- and telephony-based presence information.\n\nFurther, Frost & Sullivan also lists what it views as mandatory and optional components in any UC offering:\n\nTable 6: Unified Communication and Collaboration components\n\nGartner has a more abstract definition of Unified Communication although Gartner clarifies what constitutes UC at other places.\n\nGartner defines UC products (equipment, software and services) as those that enhance individual, workgroup and organizational productivity by enabling and facilitating the control, management, integration and use of multiple enterprise communication methods. UC products achieve this through the convergence and integration of communication channels (that is, media), networks, systems and business applications, as well as through the consolidation of the controls over them. UC products may be made up of a stand-alone product suite or may be a portfolio of integrated applications and platforms .\n\nFigure 7: Gartner's view of UC\n\nThe earlier generations of UC products will bring together the following five product areas along with presence into a converged offering:\n\nVoice: IP based telephony used with Softphones as well as IP-based desktop phones. Telephony is integrated into company directory and calendars.\n\nMessaging: Integration of voice mail with email and facsimile\n\nEmail: Further evolution of email towards contact management and collaboration tool.\n\nInstant Messaging: Use of IM not just as a quick text based method for real-time communication but also as a launch pad for other communications such as voice and video.\n\nConferencing: Integration of audio, video, and web conferencing.\n\nPresence\n\nA frequently used term within UC is presence which is information about users availability and the best communication mode to contact the user. Most users who have used instant messaging will be familiar with the concept  IM users can set their status as available, busy, away etc. that allows other IM users interested in communicating to know if it is appropriate to contact the original user on IM or not. With rich presence, users will also be able to share information about their availability on multiple systems as UC systems will aggregate availability information from multiple sources such as phone (both IP and mobile), IM, email and calendar. The availability of presence information will make communication more valuable. For example, the following blog posting titled Voice 2.0: A Manifesto for the future notes the advantage of presence to voice communication:\n\nPresence will drive a fundamental change in the way that communications networks are used today. Today, callers have no way of knowing whether the party being called is available, or busy, or would consider the call an intrusion. With presence, the availability of a called party is known by the calling party before making the call. This seemingly simple idea will increase the immediacy and value of calls in all kinds of applications. It will do away with calls that begin with \"Is this a good time\", and reduce the volume of voice mail created when parties cant connect. The range of new applications for presence is huge also. For instance, imagine an ad-hoc collaboration application where you are able to know, before initiating the call, whether all parties can attend the call, right now .\n\nAchieving a comprehensive presence view of any knowledge worker is tough today. Presence information is distributed across many different applications. These applications are supplied by different vendors and service providers, and operate using different protocols. A knowledge worker might be using a SIP based IP phone service from Cisco, XMPP based IM system from Jabber and CDMA based mobile phone from Verizon, along with Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) based email system and iCalendar-compatible calendar from Microsoft. A presence service needs to aggregate information from all these multi-vendor multi-protocol applications and provide interfaces to client application to gain access to the aggregated presence information. Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Informational RFC 2778 defines two distinct sets of clients of a presence service: one set of clients, called presentitites, provides presence information to be stored and distributed. The other set of clients, called watchers, receives presence information from the service .\n\nVendors such as Avaya, Cisco, IBM, Microsoft etc. have noticed the importance of controlling presence service and have each argued that they are best able to provide presence aggregation. For example, Avaya announced its Intelligent Presence Server on March 17, 2008 claiming to be able to aggregate presence from Avaya voice products as well as IBM and Microsoft products using multiple protocols such as SIP/SIMPLE and XMPP .\n\nUC Applies to the Convergence in the Business Market\n\nThe term UC is generally applied to business market products although consumer market products are increasingly providing integrations amongst various communication modes. For example, Skype which is a consumer product provides computer-to-computer voice communication as well as voice telephony, instant messaging, video communication, (limited) audio conferencing, voice mail and (limited) presence.\n\nAlthough UC in its developed form will comprise of a whole range of applications from plain old telephony (POTS) to newer Enterprise 2.0 collaboration tools (Web 2.0 within enterprise) such as Wikis, blogs, and so on - we posit that enterprises UC adoption decisions will be driven by their existing investments in voice, email and instant messaging (please see Appendix E for some evidence from an actual decision). We list some reasons below to support our assertion:\n\n·Enterprises have invested large sums such as for on-premise private branch exchanges (PBX) which are not ready for replacement. Enterprises have used five to seven years depreciation cycles for the traditional Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) PBXs but these PBXs last even longer,. Gartner claims that the product life cycle of TDM PBX systems is at least eight years . Similarly, buying firms will not rip-and-replace their investments in IP PBX systems. UC products should be able to leverage these voice telephony investments by integrating with them rather than requiring a replacement.\n\n·Although Email and Instant Messaging are not subject to long depreciation cycles as they are purchased on an annual per user license basis, they too are sticky because of migration costs and the risk of business disruption. Austin et al assert that migration costs are significant and it is difficult to build a business case for changing e-mail platforms based solely on return on investment. Moreover, email and instant messaging have become essential business tools and businesses will not risk any migration related disruptions unless they can prove large returns through productivity increases or cost savings.\n\n·As voice, email and instant messaging are currently installed and widely used applications within enterprises, they have created customer groove-in with particular vendors i.e. users have invested time and effort in training for the operation, maintenance and trouble shooting of the particular vendor platform that they are using. Changing a platform that has achieved groove-in is difficult because of organizational resistance as well as the cost of retraining etc.\n\n3.2Products and Technologies Underlying UC\n\nFigure 8 summarizes our perspective on UC. As noted in the previous section, we feel that UC decisions within enterprises will be driven by their existing investments in telephony, instant messaging and email - the figure highlights this fact and we discuss these three components in greater detail later on. Video communication is also worth greater discussion not only for its perceived value in communication but also for the vendor infatuation with video communication. Moreover, many strategic failures within video communications market in previous episodes provide important lessons.\n\nFigure 8: Communication and collaboration applications currently used by knowledge workers.\n\nDrivers of Convergence between UC Components\n\nThe integration of these communication applications is enabled by evolution in a number of high technology areas.\n\n·Hardware Performance and Costs: Availability of low priced and high performance general purpose hardware. The performance improvements that have happened in the following areas have affected UC most: processing power (microprocessors), volatile memory (RAM), storage (disks, tapes), input/output devices (microphones, video devices).\n\n·Software Advances: Advances in software such that software running on general purpose hardware can support applications such as voice which were previously implemented on special hardware.\n\n·Broadband Availability & Digital Transmission: Ubiquity of the public broadband internet and the move towards encoding all information and media types into digital formats. With digital encoding, all information types can now be exchanged over the packet-based internet.\n\n·Coding Technology: Media encoding has also benefitted from advances in compression technology. Exchange of information and media on the open and public internet has benefitted from advances in cryptography and protocol design.\n\n·Standard Protocols: The adoption of packet based Internet Protocol (IP) for transport and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for the control of communication sessions at the application layer. Although IP has been around for a while, SIP is a recent protocol that has been in a furious standards battle against a competing protocol called H.323 . SIP may ultimately win the battle because of the backing of major technology powerhouses such as Cisco and Microsoft. An extension of SIP for messaging called SIMPLE (Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions) has been competing with the open-source, XML-based XMPP (eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) .\n\n3.2.1Voice Telephony\n\nEnterprise voice market is big as enterprises spend large amounts on voice telephony hardware and software every year. Synergy Research estimated that enterprises in North America spent roughly $10 billion in 2006 on voice hardware and software . These expenditures do not include the service fees paid to telecom carriers to carry off-premise voice traffic. The telecom service fees when added up to the hardware and software expenditures could lead to substantially larger total telecom spend. Businesses spend these large amounts as voice telephony today is considered an essential business tool and is provided to nearly every office worker in North America.\n\nEnterprise Telephony is PBX Based: Enterprise voice telephony is different from consumer telephony as most large businesses have on-premise telephone exchanges known as Private Branch Exchange (PBX) . These PBX systems allow workers in a corporation to speak to each other without requiring their calls to leave the company locations phone network. A big advantage of this approach is the telecom fees saving that ensue from avoiding the phone company network. Some disadvantages are the capital expenditures required for PBX equipment and the need to maintain telecom staff to run the PBX system. PBXs are thus efficient for larger enterprises but not very suitable for small businesses.\n\nThe PBX systems were traditionally supplied by vertically integrated telecommunication firms such as Avaya (AV) and Nortel (NT). Traditional PBX systems were packaged as special purpose hardware with proprietary software and utilized Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) for call switching. Although there is a large existing installed base of TDM PBXes, the newer installations in 2007 were largely IP-based software driven PBXes running on general purpose hardware. Incumbent vendors also offer hybrid TDM/IP PBX that can support the incumbents legacy TDM installed base while providing a smoother transition to IP-based voice communication.\n\nThe traditional PBX systems were linked to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) using trunk lines but the newer IP-based PBXes could not be directly linked to the PSTN. Special VoIP gateways served as intermediary between IP PBXes and the PSTN.\n\nFigure 9 breaks down enterprise telephony into components to facilitate understanding.\n\nFigure 9 : Enterprise voice components\n\nVoIP is the future of Enterprise Telephony: Although voice transmission over packet network was demonstrated in 1974, it was not until the late 1990s that voice transmission over packet networks started to become more widespread. ARPANET researchers implemented the Network Voice Protocol (NVP) in December 1973 and successfully tested the protocol by transmitting voice in real-time at 16 Kbps between USCs Information Sciences Institute and MITs Lincoln Laboratory. However, the quality of sound was poor. Real-time packet voice influenced internets design as developers of NVP advocated for a separation of transport from other features such as guaranteed delivery. Vint Cerf and Jon Postel explicitly separated Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) from Internet Protocol (IP) to allow for real-time applications.\n\nThe following factors fostered the adoption of packet based VoIP in enterprises by the early 2000s:\n\n-Deployment of broadband internet\n\n-Advances in hardware and software\n\n-Advances in coding, protocols and algorithms for real-time media\n\n-Evangelism by respected enterprise networking vendor, Cisco\n\nIt must be noted that although VoIP started gaining momentum with consumers as an economical ersatz for regular long distance and international calling, it entered enterprise telephony as a disruptive technology which clearly offered much lower call quality in the beginning but provided other benefits that were attractive to some enterprises. These other benefits (discussed below) were related to convergence of voice, data and video that was enabled by IP. Gradually, the products and technologies around VoIP evolved so that the quality of a VoIP call is now satisfactory even to more discerning users.\n\nVoIP Benefits: With VoIP, enterprises are able to combine their separate voice and data networks into a single packet based network. This results in savings for enterprises by building and maintaining one rather than two separate networks. However, corporate networks had to be enhanced in order to support a critical application such as voice where business users expect high reliability and availability. Moreover, the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) agency in the USA and its counterparts elsewhere, have depended on the availability, reliability and location specificity of the traditional phone systems. The corporate networks had to be enhanced to be able to provide same features to VoIP  for example, networks were enhanced to continue to power the phones even in the case of electric power failure. The traditional phone system was able to power its equipment separately from the main electric power system and thus wasnt affected in case of main electric power failures.\n\nAnother benefit of VoIP was the ability to plug in your phone anywhere on the corporate network and still carry your telephone number. This simplified move/add/change (MAC) operations immensely as in the traditional TDM PBX systems, MAC had to be performed by telecommunication administrators. The downside to this flexibility was the loss of location specificity that PSAP systems depended on to provide relief in case of any emergencies. Some VoIP implementations solve this problem by requiring users to update their addresses whenever they change locations although this mechanism is not fool-proof.\n\nBut more importantly perhaps, VoIP offers the ability to unify various modes of communications used by an office worker. As voice communication migrated to IP and software based technologies with VoIP, it became possible to converge it with other communication, collaboration and business applications such as email, IM, word processors, CRM tools and calendars. Thus voice communication forms a major component of any Unified Communication offer.\n\nVoice Telephony and Network Effects: Being a communication application, voice is subject to direct network effects. However, voice being a century-old application is already heavily penetrated (at least in industrialized countries). Moreover, interlinking means that the network effects are enjoyed by all users but there are no proprietary network effects that give any particular firm market power.\n\nTraditional voice telephony was dominated by large vertically integrated firms such as Avaya and Nortel, who also developed most of the complements. With VoIP came the shift to software platforms which opened more possibilities for complementor firms to emerge. Thus voice telephony platforms will be subject to indirect network effects. Because of the universal interconnectivity requirements, voice platforms either use standard protocols natively or through gateway systems. However, the level of development support provided by voice platform vendors may differ and this could be the decision criteria that complementors use to join a particular ecosystem.\n\nEnterprise Voice Market\n\nThe North American enterprise voice market in 2007 was dominated by Cisco, Avaya and Nortel. Although Avaya and Nortel were the incumbent leaders in the market at the turn of the 21st century, Cisco successfully exploited the technology shift from TDM to VoIP to enter the market in early 2000 and establish itself as the dominant player by 2007. Table 7 depicts the changes in business model as voice networks converged with data networks.\n\nTable 7 : Enterprise Communication business models\n\nAs mentioned earlier, VoIP also resulted in a shift from special purpose hardware with proprietary software to general purpose hardware running voice software. For example, Ciscos Unified Communication System (release 5 of Ciscos IP PBX) runs on Intel processor based fault tolerant servers from IBM and HP with Linux or Microsoft Windows as the operating system .\n\nCisco in Enterprise Voice: Cisco entered the enterprise voice market by the announcing the acquisition of Selsius Systems in October 1998. Selsius Systems was described as a leading supplier of network PBX systems for high-quality telephony over IP networks . By 2002, Ciscos VoIP platform incorporated technologies from many more acquisitions including ActiveVoice, Amteva, Sentient Networks, GeoTel Communications, TransMedia Communications, and Calista . However in 2002, CIBCs equity research analysts did not think that Ciscos VoIP products and services were ready just yet to provide the strong growth that Cisco was seeking from the enterprise voice market  the analysts quote various conversations with distributors and customers where Cisco products were found lacking in features, reliability or service levels . It seemed that Cisco did not understand the enterprise voice market requirements well enough e.g. it lost potential customers as it had not implemented music on hold in its VoIP system.\n\nThe CIBC analysts did not however doubt Ciscos execution ability and averred that Cisco would solve any issues and become a major enterprise voice player as Cisco eventually did. The CIBC analysts also credited Cisco for evangelizing VoIP to corporate customers. Avaya and Nortel, the incumbent players in 2002 lost share to Cisco in the transition from TDM to IP based PBX systems. These incumbents were held back by their legacy installed base as well as financial issues that affected traditional telecom players after the telecom bust . Figure 10 shows the market share of these three players based on revenue from first quarter of 2007 .\n\nFigure 10 : Enterprise voice telephony market share (1Q 2007)\n\nMicrosofts Entrance into Enterprise Voice: In June 2006, Microsoft unveiled a plan to deliver an enterprise communication solution that unifies voice, conferencing, IM, email and collaboration . With the widespread acceptance of IP based software powered voice systems, Microsoft now considered enterprise voice communication to be part of its scope. Microsoft felt that it could add value by integrating voice to other communication, collaboration and business productivity applications where Microsoft has traditionally enjoyed market leadership.\n\nWe really punctuate the fact that voice is absolutely a part of Microsoft unified communications [Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer]\n\nAlthough Microsoft is a software giant and has technical capabilities in voice and speech processing, it is a relative newbie in enterprise voice telephony. Microsoft has attempted to mitigate this shortcoming through its alliance with traditional voice and networking incumbent Nortel Networks. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer described the Microsoft and Nortel alliance branded as Innovative Communication Alliance (ICA) as follows:\n\nFirst is R&D. Nortel and Microsoft are cross-licensing intellectual property, we're forming joint teams to collaborate on product development. It expands really from the enterprise to the mobile space to wireline carrier solutions. Those solutions will include contact center software, advanced mobility solutions, mission-critical telephony functions, and importantly data-networking infrastructure.\n\nSecondly, we're working together on the sales and marketing front. We want to work very closely together and invest significant resources to really market and sell our joint solutions. This will include developing a series of solutions for small and medium businesses all the way up to the largest public and private sector organizations around the globe. We were brainstorming backstage on some of the ways we can get out and really make vivid for people that this isn't just about what goes on in the data centers, or in the network operations centers for our customers, but really the experience that every end user in every organization around the globe will experience.\n\nThe third area of cooperation is in systems integration. Nortel is forming a dedicated systems integration division focused on these Microsoft-Nortel Unified Communications Solutions that will include a focus on the deployment of applications and infrastructure. It will provide our customers, we think, with an excellent transition path from the traditional phone systems, corporate PBXs of today to the world of unified communications based around software that spans phones and PCs and servers and businesses around the world.\n\n[Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer]\n\nICA provides Microsoft with intellectual property, engineering talent, and voice-related brand recognition of Nortel Networks. ICA is also clearly tilted towards Microsoft when it comes to voice products  that is, if Microsoft offers a product to fulfill a customer need, it will form part of the joint ICA offering even if Nortel has a more mature product. Nortel products will only be used to fill in gaps in Microsoft product offering. In lieu of all this, Nortel receives a bellwether system integrator status for Microsofts Unified Communication initiative. Nortel executives estimated that the ICA was worth $1 billion in incremental revenue to Nortel Networks .\n\nMicrosoft and Enterprise Voice Grade Reliability: Microsoft is still fighting to gain mind share within the enterprise VoIP market. Microsoft has a general perception among users of low reliability  in the voice market with very high expectation of reliability and availability, this is hurting Microsoft. A study done by Infonetics Research found that buyers rated Cisco high on reliability but low on pricing, and rated Microsoft high on financial stability but low on reliability . The author believes that Microsoft will be able to overcome shortcomings in features, reliability and so on just as Cisco was able to overcome its early predicament in the enterprise voice market. It is worth noting that the earlier versions of Cisco Call Manager (IP PBX) systems ran over Microsoft Windows servers. Thus, Microsoft was able to provide a reliable operating system platform for the Ciscos Call Manager with enterprise voice grade reliability. Microsoft is often rightly criticized for product flaws but in this case, perception about Microsoft product reliability may be worst than reality.\n\nMicrosoft will also attempt to win share by competing on price  its executives have publicly stated that the price of enterprise solutions will fall substantially in three years.\n\nI want to share an exciting vision of business communications. Within three years, more than 100 million people will be able to make phone calls from Microsoft Outlook, SharePoint, and other Microsoft Office Systems applications; and customers will be able to gain this value with VoIP solutions that are half the cost of what they are today.\n\n[Microsoft Business Division President, Jeff Raikes]\n\nEven with aforementioned points that make the case for Microsoft, it would have been hard for Microsoft to compete within the voice telephony market because of entrenched competition. But through platform envelopment as discussed in Section 4.5 below , Microsoft will be able to gain a share within the enterprise voice telephony market.\n\n3.2.2Email\n\nEmail allows asynchronous communication between two computer users  one user can compose a message and send it to another user electronically who can view the message later. The message is stored at a mail server for the other user to retrieve it when convenient. Although email originally allowed exchange of plain text, it has evolved so as to allow message exchange in many document formats. Email also allows exchange of files in (nearly) any format as an attachment. Emails can be exchanged on one multi-user computer system, on intranets or on the public internet  with the last form of email dominant today with the widespread adoption of the internet.\n\nHistory of Email\n\nEmail has a long history going back to 1961, when the multi-user Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) developed at MITs Computation Center allowed users to pass messages by creating files such as TO TOM and placing them in common file storage space. The intended recipient could then look at the message whenever they logged in to CTSS. Tom Van Vleck reports that he and Noel Morris wrote MAIL in summer of 1965 for Multics although other systems such as SDCs Q32 operating system and BBN may have implemented email before that . Lawrence G. Roberts reports the following noteworthy events around internet email :\n\nTable 8: Important historical events around email\n\n[Adapted from (Roberts, 1999) ]\n\nEmail has continued to grow after NSF opened internet to commercial use in 1991. On the consumer side, email was offered by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to their subscribers. Users were provided with a mail box at the ISP to store their emails and an application program that ran on the users computer to access their emails. Webmail such as hotmail first introduced around 1996 allowed users to access their emails through any computer with a web browser and connected to the internet.\n\nAlthough it took decades for email to open to commercial use, the early design of email by Larry Roberts has been the dominant design with most email programs even today having a basic structure similar to Larrys original program.\n\nEmail is one of the most widely used internet applications today. According to Pew Internet & American Life Project survey conducted in December 2007, 92% of internet users reported sending or reading emails  . Figure 11 estimates that roughly 6.5% of the US internet visits came from just three webmail providers (Yahoo Mail, Hotmail and Gmail). Yahoo cited comScore to claim that the worldwide Web mail market counts approximately 543 million people, with Yahoo! Mail alone representing 255 million . Microsoft claimed in May 2007 that it had more than 280 million accounts . These claimed numbers may not add up exactly but they do suggest an order of magnitude for the number of email users.\n\nFigure 11 : Share of internet visits for top three webmail providers\n\n[Source: (Prescott, 2007)]\n\nThe main drivers for emails popularity have been lower costs, good reliability and almost instantaneous delivery (some of the alternate means of communications were phone and postal mail).\n\nBusiness Models for Consumer Email: There are three different business models for consumer email:\n\n·Advertisement supported webmail (free to users). This is a classic example of a two-sided market  .\n\n·Fee based webmail which comes with premium features such as extra storage compared to free webmail\n\n·Bundled email provided by ISP, who bundle email with internet access and other services and charge for the whole bundle\n\nEmail Standards Battle  X.400 vs. SMTP\n\nAs email is a store-and-forward application, the high level tasks that an email system must perform are:\n\n-Email transmission\n\n-Email storage\n\n-Email retrieval\n\nTwo standard protocols for email transmission were proposed viz. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and X.400 by IETF and ITU-T respectively. These protocols battled for dominance in the 1980s and early 1990s. However, SMTP has become the de facto standard for email with X.400 now used in specialized applications where some of its features such as security and guaranteed delivery are valuable.\n\nSMTP Protocol: SMTP evolved from earlier work on email within Arpanet during the 1970s. RFC 821 written in 1982 by Jonathan Postel documents the protocol. The quote below from RFC 821 introduces the SMTP protocol and Figure 12 provides a high level depiction of mail exchange using SMTP.\n\nThe objective of Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is to transfer mail reliably and efficiently.\n\nSMTP is independent of the particular transmission subsystem and requires only a reliable ordered data stream channel.\n\nThe SMTP provides mechanisms for the transmission of mail; directly from the sending user's host to the receiving user's host when the two host are connected to the same transport service, or via one or more relay SMTP-servers when the source and destination hosts are not connected to the same transport service .\n\nFigure 12 : Mail exchange using SMTP protocol (simplified)\n\nThe SMTP protocol required the recipients to retrieve messages from the file system of the SMTP server. This meant that remote users could not access email unless they used the remote File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to access the server. Separate mail retrieval protocols such as Post Office Protocol (POP) or Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) were developed to allow remote access to SMTP email .\n\nSMTP Shortcomings: SMTP did not guarantee delivery of email message instead putting the onus of delivery on a reliable ordered data stream channel. In practice, this has meant that the email will bounce back to the sender if it is undelivered for any reason.\n\nSMTP was originally developed to carry only American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) text messages and could not carry other media . Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) was developed to enhance SMTPs ability to carry media such as images, audio and video files, and computer programs. MIME allowed text in character sets other than ASCII as well as non-text attachments.\n\nSMTP did not provide email security but Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) protocol was developed to enable encryption and digital signing of SMTP/MIME email messages . A big flaw with SMTP was the relative ease with which email could be spoofed as SMTP lacked a strong user authentication procedure. The author is aware of instances in the mid-1990s when undergraduate colleagues received spurious emails offering graduate admissions to top computer science programs that were really pranks by fellow students. Figure 13 shows how easily anyone with access to UNIX telnet could send an email as user watcher@Arizona.EDU (or any other user @Arizona.EDU). Many servers have now fixed this simple hack but it was possible to spoof email using this hack till the late 1990s.\n\nFigure 13 : How to forge an email\n\nThe SMTP protocol made it easy to setup email service (cf. X.400) and thus became widely adopted. One of the major downside of this openness is the current email spam problem that has reduced the effectiveness of email as a communication medium. The spam problem stems from the lack of user authentication within SMTP. Paul Festa discusses the relationship between SMTP and Spam in more detail - the following is a passage from the Festas article quoting internet email pioneer Suzanne Sluizer:\n\n\"You have to remember the era in which this protocol was designed,\" said Sluizer, the self-described \"grandmother\" of SMTP.\n\n\"Back in the time we were doing this work, we were talking about hundreds or maybe thousands of sites on what was then called the ARPAnet. We were looking at connecting with a few in Europe and some smaller networks in the U.S. \"It was a trusted situation, and the protocols were developed on the basis of that trust. So it's very surprising to me that we are using the same protocols coming up on 25 years later, because you need different things in a commercial environment than you need in a research environment.\"\n\nX.400 Protocol: The inadequacy of SMTP for commercial and security critical applications led to the development of X.400 by ITU-T in 1982. X.400 was built from the grounds up unlike SMTP. Although X.400 is more secure and robust than SMTP, it is also more complex.\n\nX.400 guarantees delivery by requiring acknowledgement during each phase of transmission. If an acknowledgement is not received, the message is resent. X.400 also allows multiple email bodies that enabled the delivery of multimedia content.\n\nThe addressing scheme of X.400 was also more complex than internet email e.g. the authors internet email hydari@mit.edu could appear as G=Zia;S=Hydari;O=MIT;P=EDU;A=;C=US for X.400 based email system. Such addresses were very difficult for users to memorize.\n\nReasons for SMTPs success over X.400: SMTP has become the de facto email standard despite the support X.400 had from ITU-T and other industry bodies such as Electronic Mail Association (EMA) . Moreover, SMTP prevailed even though X.400 provided good solutions from the onset to some of the SMTP shortcomings mentioned above. Some of the reasons for SMTPs success in the standards battle are:\n\n-SMTP email being a nested platform within the public internet benefitted immensely from bandwagon effects of internet adoption in the 1990s (see Figure 14 ). Although interlinking between email systems was possible, users avoided the extra costs of setting up interlinking. SMTPs openness also facilitated adoption\n\n-SMTP evolved from earlier systems so it benefited from legacy support\n\n-X.400 was highly complex. Its addressing scheme was also considered difficult for users and may have contributed to lack of adoption\n\nFigure 14 : Growth in internet hosts from 1985 to 1995\n\n[Source: (Frenkel, 1995) ]\n\nInterlinking within Email Systems\n\nEmail being a communication tool has very strong direct network effects. Internet Email benefitted from the widespread adoption of the internet. Although interlinking was possible, internet email has largely replaced other email systems in North America. X.400 has persisted in specialized applications such as military and intelligence where X.400s early advantage in security and guaranteed delivery fostered adoption.\n\nOther Email Systems: The other email systems included corporate or organizational email systems that allowed exchange of emails amongst employees or members. These email systems were closed to users outside the particular organization and generally used proprietary protocols such as cc:Mail. There were other cross-organizational systems such as BITNET email. BITNET was a university network founded in 1981 that gradually gave way to internet after NSF opened the internet in 1991. It was possible for BITNET users to communicate with internet users through BITNET gateways.\n\nIn theory, interlinking removed the advantage of proprietary network effects that internet email enjoyed (over other email system). But the primary reason for the success of internet email has been the success of internet itself  e.g. the Corporation for Research and Educational Networking (CREN) recommended that its members terminate their dependence on BITNET-NJE by December 31, 1996 .\n\nEnterprise Email\n\nEmail is a highly used communication tool within enterprises although the author has not found any estimates on total worldwide enterprise email users. Gartner estimates that there were 234 million users in October 2006 in U.S., the U.K., Germany, Italy and France in enterprises with more than 500 email users . Many enterprises provide internet email to their employees as email allows enterprise workers to communicate not only with their colleagues within the firm but also to people outside the firm cost effectively. Moreover, email is similar to the PSTN in its wide spread reach.\n\nHosted Email vs. On-premise Email: Unlike consumer email, enterprise email overwhelmingly uses on-premise mail servers for storage and forwarding of email. Recall that consumer email is either hosted by ISP or by webmail providers. Enterprises view email communications to be critical data and thus want to control the servers where email is stored. This has required enterprises to build email infrastructure by running mail servers in-house.\n\nEnterprise Email market: Many vendors provide email infrastructure software (mail servers etc.) but the two dominant players in the market are Microsoft and IBM, with their products Exchange/Outlook and Lotus Notes respectively. Microsoft is the overall market leader but its dominance is more pronounced in smaller enterprises than in larger enterprises . Google has tried to build a hosted email offering for businesses but the hosting model for business email is nascent and adoption is low at this time. Gartner estimates that hosted email comprised 1% of enterprise seats but hosted email is projected to grow to 20% of enterprise seats by 2012.\n\nIBM was once the clear market leader but lost its place to Microsoft. For a period, IBM did not invest enough in Lotus Notes to evolve it. Lotus Notes was also more expensive as Microsoft aggressively priced Exchange/Outlook to win market share. Anecdotally, Lotus Notes had an unintuitive and unfriendly user interface that caused user resentment against Lotus Notes. Figure 15 shows the enterprise email and calendaring worldwide market share for the period 2003-2005. The Herfindahl index calculated using the market share for Microsoft, IBM, Novell, Oracle and Sendmail is at least 0.38 for the period, suggesting a very concentrated market.\n\nFigure 15 : Enterprise email and calendaring worldwide market share\n\nFigure 16 shows the forecasted enterprise email seat share in 2009 based on a Gartner study . This predicts a further increase in Microsofts market power by 2009 in the enterprise email space.\n\nFigure 16 : Forecasted enterprise email seat share, 2009\n\nNetwork Effects and Enterprise Email Market: As with voice telephony, email is universally linked either through standard SMTP protocol or through gateways. Email as an application does exhibit direct network effects but these network effects are not proprietary to particular firms. Although enterprise email market is highly concentrated, the reason for Microsofts share is"
