        "text": "Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels will be the next president of Purdue University.\n\nHe was announced as the lone finalist and unanimously voted to be the choice in a meeting, this morning.\n\nWhen he begins the job after leaving officer in January, he'll be only the 12th president in the University's history.\n\nDaniels, the former budget director under President George W. Bush, has served two terms as governor and is barred by state law from seeking a third term.\n\nHe was widely recruited to run for president but chose not to.\n\nDaniels had been mentioned as a running mate for Mitt Romney but said repeatedly he wasn't interested.\n\nIndiana Higher Education Commissioner Teresa Lubbers released the following statement in response to today's announcement:\n\n\"This announcement signals an exciting new chapter in the life of a great university and a great public servant. In naming Governor Daniels as President, Purdue trustees chose to select a leader with superior intellectual credentials and a range of public and private experiences that will serve him and Purdue very well.\"\n\nSenator Dan Coats (R-Ind.) today made the following statement about Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels being named the next president of Purdue University:\n\n\"I congratulate Governor Daniels and Purdue University on this exciting announcement. The pairing of one of our nation's most innovative leaders with one of our premier institutions of higher learning means exciting days are ahead in West Lafayette.\n\n\"I always said 'President Daniels' has a nice ring to it. Despite the numerous national opportunities available to him, the governor followed his heart and chose to stay home in Indiana. In doing so, he once again demonstrated his passion for our state and commitment to improving our education system for future generations. I commend the governor for his dedication to Hoosiers and look forward to working with him as he leads Purdue University.\"\n\nIndiana Democratic Party Chair Dan Parker issued the following statement congratulating Gov. Mitch Daniels on his appointment as the next president of Purdue University:\n\n\"We congratulate Mitch Daniels on his appointment as president of Purdue University and wish him well in his new endeavor. Purdue is a critical part of the state's education infrastructure, and our future depends on the financial and academic health of our institutions of higher learning.\"\n\nYou can find more information on the university's website."
