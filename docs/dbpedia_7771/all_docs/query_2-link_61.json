        "text": "The Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. School of Business is located in West Lafayette, Indiana, USA. As a part of Purdue University, Daniels School of Business graduates benefit from the public university’s network and initiatives. Formerly known as the Krannert School of Management, it underwent a name change in 2023 to become the Daniels School of Business.\n\nThe institution, known for its commitment to innovation and impactful research, offers programs dedicated to nurturing the next generation of ethical business leaders. Through a range of master’s programs, internships, and networking opportunities, the school empowers its students to spearhead meaningful change within the business community.\n\nIn 1962, the Krannert Graduate School of Industrial Administration was established through a generous donation of $2.7 million by Herman and Ellnora Krannert. In the 1970s, the school’s name was changed to the Krannert School of Management.\n\nHerman Krannert (1878- 1972) graduated from the University of Illinois with a Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering. Krannert established Inland Container Corp., one of the largest manufacturers of containerboard and corrugated shipping cartons.\n\nKrannert shared management insights with his employees through his Founder’s Day lectures, later published in book form, titled Krannert on Management. He believed in the power of critical thinking, and the willingness to act in uncertainty.\n\nTogether with his wife, Elinora, Herman contributed to various educational and cultural projects. Their impact is evident in several buildings bearing their name, such as the Krannert Art Museum (KAM) and the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nThe recent merger of the Bruce White Undergraduate Institute and Krannert Graduate Institute resulted in the Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. School of Business. The name was chosen to honor the 12th president of Purdue.\n\nMitchell Elias Daniels Jr. was born in 1949 in Pennsylvania. He earned a Bachelor’s degree from Princeton University and a Juris Doctor (JD) from Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nIn the 1980s, Daniels served as a chief political advisor and liaison to President Ronald Reagan. Taking a break from politics, he became president of North American Pharmaceutical Operations at Eli Lilly and Company. Daniels later returned to politics and served as the Director of the United States Office of Management and Budget during the George W. Bush administration.\n\nAs the 49th Governor of Indiana from 2005 to 2013, Daniels implemented significant reforms that positively impacted the state’s financial standing. He successfully reduced overall debt and achieved Indiana’s first AAA credit rating. Notably, Daniels also played a crucial role in enacting the Healthy Indiana Plan, which provided healthcare coverage for uninsured adults, and introduced property-tax reforms.\n\nAfter completing two terms as Governor, Daniels became the President of Purdue University. During his tenure, he prioritized student accessibility and affordability by implementing tuition freezes and cost reductions. Additionally, Daniels collaborated with Amazon to provide discounted textbooks to students. His efforts resulted in a 32% reduction in student loans.\n\nFurthermore, Daniels worked to increase accountability in higher education through the Gallup-Purdue Index, which measures the value of a college degree.\n\nDespite his notable accomplishments, Daniels’ questionable past and comments made students demand action more than once.\n\nDuring Mitchell E. Daniels’s decade at Eli Lilly, the company faced legal fines of over $2.7 billion. The pharmaceutical company had to settle tens fo thousands of personal injury claims under his leadership.\n\nDuring Daniels Jr.’s ten-year leadership at Purdue, students expressed concerns about some of his statements, which were perceived to be non-inclusive. A 2019 comment where he called a black scholar “one of the rarest creatures in America” resulted in Purdue’s NAACP chapter demanding a public apology. While apologizing for his remark, Daniels also asserted that he was misunderstood."
