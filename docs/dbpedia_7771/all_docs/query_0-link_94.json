Daniels, Jr. School of Business during its meeting Friday morning.\n\nA Purdue news release said the “reimagined Daniels School will prepare tomorrow’s leaders and entrepreneurs, grounding them in the hallmarks of a Purdue education, including STEM disciplines and business analytics.”\n\nDaniels served 10 years as president of Purdue before retiring at the end of 2022.\n\n“To be associated with any aspect of Purdue’s academic enterprise is an inestimable honor, but this one, in particular, touches me deeply,” Daniels said in a news release. “Practiced with integrity, business careers are the noblest of life choices; they create new jobs and wealth for others and bring into being the resources that the public and nonprofit sectors take to pursue their goals. This modernized School of Business will send out its graduates armed with a sense of mission and the tools to fulfill that mission in the most complex of enterprises.”"
