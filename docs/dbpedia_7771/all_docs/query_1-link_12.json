        "text": "Mitch Daniels is president of Purdue University and former governor of Indiana from 2005 to 2013. During his gubernatorial tenure, Indiana went from bankruptcy to a AAA credit rating, led the nation in infrastructure building, and passed education reforms. At Purdue, Daniels has prioritized student affordability and success, holding tuition steady at 2013 levels through at least the 2016-2017 academic year, among other initiatives. Previously, Daniels was director of the Office of Management and Budget under President George W. Bush, senior advisor to President Reagan, and president of Eli Lillyâ€™s North American pharmaceutical operations. Fortune Magazine named him among the Top 50 World Leaders in 2015."
