It was annexed on 06 August 1861 and declared a colony on 05 March 1862. The colony established a protectorate over most of Yorubaland between 1890 and 1897. The colony and protectorate were incorporated into Southern Nigeria in February 1906 and Lagos became the capital of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria in January 1914\n\nLagos Colony ensign (1886 - 1906)\n\nimage by Martin Grieve, 18 Aug 2011\n\nThe Lagos Colony flew a British blue ensign defaced with the badge of the colony in the fly. This badge was the same as that used by the Gambia, the Gold Coast and Sierra Leone, with the exception of a red 'L' for Lagos below the elephant. The ensign was used between 1886 and 1906.\n\nDavid Prothero, 02 Feb 2001\n\nGovernor's Flag\n\nimage by Martin Grieve, 18 Aug 2011"
