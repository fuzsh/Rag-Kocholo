        "text": "Northern Nigeria was a British protectorate which lasted from 1900 until 1914 and covered the northern part of what is now Nigeria.\n\nThe Berlin Conference of 1884 and 1885 provided the area that would become the Northern Nigeria Protectorate to the British. The Royal Niger Company was formed in 1886 with George Taubman Goldie as the vice governor. The Company negotiated trade agreements and political agreements, sometimes coercive, with many of the chieftains, emirs, and the Sokoto Caliphate. In 1897, Frederick Lugard was the appointed head of the West African Frontier Force which was tasked with stopping Fulani resistance and possible French incursions in the northwest area.\n\nOn 1 January 1900, the Royal Niger Companyâ€™s charter was revoked and the British government took control. Lokoja was the capital from 1900, but Zungeru became the headquarters for the protectorate in 1902 because it was the most northerly city accessible by river transport.\n\nMilitary operations began in 1902 and continued for about five years of sporadic fighting. The remnants of the Bornu Empire were conquered in 1902 and the Sokoto Caliphate and the Kano Emirate were taken over in 1903. Fighting continued in 1904 in Bassa. In 1906 a large Mahdist revolution began outside of the city of Sokoto in the village of Satiru, a combined force of the British and the British-appointed Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Attahiru II, destroyed the town and killed most residents involved. After 1907 there were fewer revolts and use of military force by the British and the focus of the High Commissioner turned toward taxation and administration.\n\nThe Protectorate was ended on 1 January 1914, when its area was unified with the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and the Lagos Colony, becoming the Northern Province of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria.\n\nBlog\n\nBig Blue 1840-1940: Northern Nigeria\n\nBrixton-Chrome: Nigerian Stamps and Postal History\n\nDead Country Stamps and Banknotes: Northern Nigeria\n\nNigerian Stamps\n\nNigerian Stamps and Postal History\n\nFacebook\n\nLagos Stamp Club\n\nPhilatelists in Nigeria\n\nNigeria Philately\n\nWebsites\n\nWest Africa Study Circle\n\nFollow Me!"
