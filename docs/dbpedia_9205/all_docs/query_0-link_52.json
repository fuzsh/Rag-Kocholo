        "text": "Nigeria is located on the western coast of Africa. Before the colonial era, the peoples of Nigeria lived in hunting, fishing and farming societies. In the 15th century, the Portuguese were the first white people to arrive in Nigeria, before the arrival of the British. The people of Benin began to trade with the Portuguese, selling slaves, buying spices and firearms, and learning the art of writing and the Christian religion.\n\nBy the 18th century, the British had taken over control of the slave trade from the Portuguese. However, in 1807, the British missionaries’ campaign against slavery led the British parliament to ban the slave trade. In 1884, Britain created the Oil Rivers Protectorate in the Niger Delta and claimed the region in 1885 after defeating King Jaja of Opobo. Did you know that the Niger Delta was called the Oil Rivers because it was a major producer of palm oil? In 1862, Lagos Island was declared a colony of Britain, and Mr. H.S Freeman became Governor of Lagos Colony. In 1893, the Oil Rivers Protectorate was renamed Niger Coast Protectorate with Calabar as capital. In 1890, the British reporter Flora Shaw suggested that the area be named “Nigeria” after the Niger River. [Flora Shaw later married Lord Frederick Lugard]. By 1900, Britain had control of Nigeria and had established the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and Northern Nigeria Protectorate. In 1914, the Northern Nigeria Protectorate and Southern Nigeria Protectorate were amalgamated to form Nigeria, with Colonial Officer Frederick Lugard as Governor-General.

In 1951, the Action Group Party was established by Chief Obafemi Awolowo. Also in 1951, an agitation of the NCNC under Dr. Namdi Azikiwe caused Britain to grant internal self-rule to Nigeria. In 1954, federalism was adopted in Nigeria and the position of Governor was created in the three regions (North, West and East. 1957-1958 Constitutional conferences in the UK The preparation of a new federal constitution for an independent Nigeria was carried out at conferences held at Lancaster House in London and presided over by The Rt.
