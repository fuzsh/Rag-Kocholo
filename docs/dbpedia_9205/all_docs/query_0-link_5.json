        "text": "Lagos was a British colony in present-day Nigeria, located on the country’s southwestern coast. The British established their presence in the area in the early 19th century, and by 1861, Lagos had become a Crown Colony.\n\nIn 1891, Lagos was merged with the Protectorate of the Niger Coast to form the Oil Rivers Protectorate, which later became the Niger Coast Protectorate in 1893. In 1900, the British government decided to merge the Lagos Colony and the Niger Coast Protectorate to form the Southern Nigeria Protectorate, which covered a larger area of what is now Nigeria’s southern region.\n\nThe creation of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate was driven by the British government’s desire to expand its colonial control in the region and improve governance and administration. The merger also allowed for greater economic and political integration within the region.\n\nUnder the new protectorate, Lagos continued to be an important administrative and commercial center, serving as the capital of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate until 1914 when the protectorate was amalgamated with the Northern Nigeria Protectorate to form the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria.\n\nThe creation of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate had a significant impact on the political and economic development of the region, and it contributed to the eventual emergence of Nigeria as an independent country in 1960."
