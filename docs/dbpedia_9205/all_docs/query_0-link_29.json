        "text": "Southern Nigeria Protectorate\n\nBritish protectorate from 1900 to 1914\n\nDistance: Approx. 572 meters\n\nLatitude and longitude: 6.45,3.4\n\nSouthern Nigeria was a British protectorate in the coastal areas of modern-day Nigeria formed in 1900 from the union of the Niger Coast Protectorate with territories chartered by the Royal Niger Company below Lokoja on the Niger River. The Lagos colony was later added in 1906, and the territory was officially renamed the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria. In 1914, Southern Nigeria was joined with Northern Nigeria Protectorate to form the single colony of Nigeria.\n\nLagos Island\n\nLGA in Lagos State, Nigeria\n\nDistance: Approx. 572 meters\n\nLatitude and longitude: 6.45,3.4\n\nLagos Island (Yoruba: Ìsàlẹ̀ Èkó) is the principal and central Local Government Area (LGA) in Lagos, Nigeria. It was the capital of Lagos State until 1957. It is part of the Lagos Division.\n\nLagos Colony\n\nBritish protectorate from 1862 to 1906\n\nDistance: Approx. 7 meters\n\nLatitude and longitude: 6.45305556,3.39583333\n\nLagos Colony was a British colonial possession centred on the port of Lagos in what is now southern Nigeria. Lagos was annexed on 6 August 1861 under the threat of force by Commander Beddingfield of HMS Prometheus who was accompanied by the Acting British Consul, William McCoskry. Oba Dosunmu of Lagos (spelled \"Docemo\" in British documents) resisted the cession for 11 days while facing the threat of violence on Lagos and its people, but capitulated and signed the Lagos Treaty of Cession.\n\nFreedom Park (Lagos)\n\nPublic park in Lagos, Nigeria\n\nDistance: Approx. 463 meters\n\nLatitude and longitude: 6.4489,3.3965\n\nFreedom Park is a memorial and leisure park area in the middle of downtown Lagos in Lagos Island, Nigeria which was formerly Her Majesty's Broad Street Prison. It was designed by the architect Theo Lawson as a speculative project under the CIA-Lagos (formerly the Creative Intelligence Agency and now the Cultural Intellectual Association) in 1999. The park was constructed to preserve the history and cultural heritage of Nigerians.\n\nAjele Cemetery\n\nFormer cemetery in Nigeria\n\nDistance: Approx. 243 meters\n\nLatitude and longitude: 6.4515,3.3942\n\nAjele Cemetery was a major cemetery on Lagos Island demolished by the Lagos State military government under Brigadier Mobolaji Johnson in the 1970s. Ajele in Yoruba means government administrative official and the cemetery was so named because of the many British colonial officials who were buried there.\n\nHoly Cross Cathedral, Lagos\n\nChurch in Lagos, Nigeria\n\nDistance: Approx. 356 meters\n\nLatitude and longitude: 6.4499,3.3966\n\nHoly Cross Cathedral is a Roman Catholic cathedral located in Lagos, Nigeria, and is the seat of the Archdiocese of Lagos. The Gothic style building was constructed in 1939, when the region was still administered as an apostolic vicariate, and thus was only elevated to the status of cathedral in 1950.\n\nIlojo Bar\n\nBrazilian-styled historic building\n\nDistance: Approx. 652 meters\n\nLatitude and longitude: 6.45385,3.38997\n\nIlojo Bar, also called Olaiya House or Casa da Fernandez, was a Brazilian-styled historic building located near Tinubu Square in Lagos Island, Lagos State, Nigeria. It was originally built as a bar and restaurant in 1855 by the Fernandez family who employed returning ex-slaves who had mastered the art of building while in South America. Ilojo Bar was subsequently sold to Alfred Omolana Olaiya of the Olaiya family in 1933 and was declared a national monument in 1956 by the National Commission for Museums and Monuments."
