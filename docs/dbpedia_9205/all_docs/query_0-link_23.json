        "text": "dc.descriptionNigeria is a country of 140 million people from 373 ethnic groups/nationalities, each with its own distinct language and culture. The population is currently divided between Christians (40%), Muslims (40%), and adherents of traditional religions (20%). Nigeria began to come under British rule from 1864 through separate treaties signed with respective kingdoms like, Lagos, Bonny and Opobo in the Niger Delta etc. Resulting from this were the Lagos Crown Colony 1862, which later became Lagos Protectorate; Oil Rivers Protectorate 1885, which later became Niger Coast Protectorate 1893 and was renamed Protectorate of Southern Nigeria 1900; and the Sudan Province consisting of territories under the shadow control of the Royal Niger Company, which was renamed the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria in 1900. From 1900 - 1906, there were three administrations, namely: Southern and Northern Protectorates and Lagos Colony. Lagos Colony was later administered as part of the Southern Protectorate, under the name ‘Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria’ from 1906 until amalgamation in 1914 when the entire area, Southern and Northern Protectorates, began to be governed as a country. Nigeria gained independence from Britain on 1 October 1960 and became a republic on 1 October 1963."
