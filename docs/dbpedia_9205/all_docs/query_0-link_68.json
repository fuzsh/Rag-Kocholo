Google returned 62,300 hits for Nasarawa and 55,000 for Nassarawa. On the Nigeria Direct site (\"The Official Information Gateway of the Federal Republic of Nigeria\"), it was spelled Nassarawa on the page devoted to that state; to get to that page, you had to select \"Nasarawa state\" on a cascading menu (under Government>States). For a while I stuck with double-s because ISO and FIPS both had that spelling. However, by 2011 the spelling seemed to be stabilizing on one s. FIPS switched from two s's to one with Update 14, 2013-12-31. ISO made the same change on 2014-11-03.\n\nThe other spelling controversy is over the capital of Bayelsa, but there seems to be a clear majority for Yenagoa over Yenegoa.\n\nNigerians have been discussing creating new states. There was talk of forming ten new states in 2011, but it hasn't led to action yet.\n\nFIPS Publication Change Notice No. 10, affecting FIPS PUB 10-4, was issued on 2006-03-23. It changes the name of Abuja Capital Territory to Federal Capital Territory.\n\nChange Notice 4 to FIPS PUB 10-4 is dated 2000-02-25. It says that six new states have been created in Nigeria.\n\nUpdate I-1 to ISO 3166-2 was published on 2000-06-21. It also shows the addition of the six new states.\n\nCountry overview:\n\nShort nameNIGERIA ISO codeNG FIPS codeNI LanguageEnglish (en) Time zone+1 CapitalAbuja\n\nIn 1899, the Royal Niger Company surrendered its charter to the British Crown. On 1900-01-01, Great Britain created two protectorates: Northern Nigeria (most of the Company land), and Southern Nigeria (the rest of the Company land, merged with the Niger Coast Protectorate). The Colony and Protectorate of Lagos was a separate entity at that time. The parts became a single \"colony and protectorate\" on 1914-01-01. France and England seized Kamerun (Cameroon) from Germany during World War I. On 1922-07-20, part of Kamerun was mandated to Britain, which administered the mandate as part of Nigeria. Nigeria became independent on 1960-10-01. A plebiscite was held in the Cameroons, now a trust territory. The northern part chose to unite with Nigeria, effective 1962-06-01, while the southern part joined with the recently independent Cameroon Republic, effective 1961-10-01. On 1967-05-30, the Republic of Biafra (consisting of the Eastern and Mid-Western regions, recently reorganized) announced its secession from Nigeria, but the revolt was defeated by 1970, and Biafra never attained international recognition.\n\nOther names of country:\n\nDanish: Nigeria\n\nDutch: Nigeria, Bondsrepubliek Nigeria (formal)\n\nEnglish: Federal Republic of Nigeria (formal)\n\nFinnish: Nigeria\n\nFrench: Nigéria, Nigeria m\n\nGerman: Nigeria n\n\nIcelandic: Nígería\n\nItalian: Nigeria f\n\nNorwegian: Forbundsrepublikken Nigeria (formal) (Bokmål), Sambandsrepublikken Nigeria (formal) (Nynorsk), Nigeria\n\nPortuguese: Nigéria, República f Federal da Nigéria f (formal)\n\nRussian: Федеративная Республика Нигерия (formal)\n\nSpanish: Nigeria, República f Federal de Nigeria f (formal)\n\nSwedish: Nigeria\n\nTurkish: Nijerya Federal Cumhuriyeti (formal)\n\nOrigin of name:\n\nNamed for the Niger River, from Tamashek gher n-gheren: river among rivers\n\nPrimary subdivisions:\n\nNigeria is divided into 36 states and one capital territory.\n\nStateHASCFIPSPopulationArea(km.²)Area(mi.²)Capital AbiaNG.ABNI452,833,9994,8571,875Umuahia AdamawaNG.ADNI353,168,10137,95714,655Yola Akwa IbomNG.AKNI213,920,2086,7882,621Uyo AnambraNG.ANNI254,182,0324,7611,838Awka BauchiNG.BANI464,676,46548,19718,609Bauchi BayelsaNG.BYNI521,703,3589,3633,615Yenagoa BenueNG.BENI264,219,24430,75511,875Makurdi BornoNG.BONI274,151,19372,76728,095Maiduguri Cross RiverNG.CRNI222,888,96622,1128,537Calabar DeltaNG.DENI364,098,39117,0956,600Asaba EbonyiNG.EBNI532,173,5016,3422,449Abakaliki EdoNG.EDNI373,218,33219,5847,562Benin City EkitiNG.EKNI542,384,2125,7972,238Ado-Ekiti EnuguNG.ENNI473,257,2987,5602,919Enugu Federal Capital TerritoryNG.FCNI111,405,2017,5692,922Abuja GombeNG.GONI552,353,87917,4286,729Gombe ImoNG.IMNI283,934,8995,1351,982Owerri JigawaNG.JINI394,348,64923,4159,041Dutse KadunaNG.KDNI236,066,56244,21717,072Kaduna KanoNG.KNNI299,383,68220,3897,872Kano KatsinaNG.KTNI245,792,57823,8229,198Katsina KebbiNG.KENI403,238,62836,32014,023Birnin Kebbi KogiNG.KONI413,278,48729,06311,221Lokoja KwaraNG.KWNI302,371,08933,79213,047Ilorin LagosNG.LANI059,013,5343,4751,342Ikeja NasarawaNG.NANI561,863,27526,63310,283Lafia NigerNG.NINI313,950,24972,06527,824Minna OgunNG.OGNI163,728,09816,8506,506Abeokuta OndoNG.ONNI483,441,02415,0195,799Akure OsunNG.OSNI423,423,5358,5853,315Oshogbo OyoNG.OYNI325,591,58927,03610,438Ibadan PlateauNG.PLNI493,178,71226,53910,247Jos RiversNG.RINI505,185,40010,3614,000Port Harcourt SokotoNG.SONI513,696,99932,14612,412Sokoto TarabaNG.TANI432,300,73659,18022,850Jalingo YobeNG.YONI442,321,59144,88017,328Damaturu ZamfaraNG.ZANI573,259,84633,66712,999Gusau Total140,003,542911,519351,938\n\nState: Abuja Capital Territory is a capital territory.\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes.
