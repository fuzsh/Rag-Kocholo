        "text": "Abstract The Nigerian state otherwise called the Federal Republic of Nigeria, was before colonial administration, made up of autonomous, independent nations that include Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa, Fulani, Ijaw, Kanuri, Tiv, Effik, Edo, Nupe, amongst others. There are over two hundred and fifty ethnic and indigenous languages in Nigeria. The Colonial administrator, following the Berlin Conference of 1884/5, first supervised the configuration of these nations into the Colony of Lagos, Southern, and Northern Protectorates, and in 1906, joined the Colony of Lagos and Southern Protectorate to become Southern Protectorate. Then, in 1914, the amalgamation of Southern and Northern Protectorates became the Nigerian State. Ever since, the Nigerian State had been balkanized into Southern, Western, and Northern Regions in the 1950s; after independence in 1960, Southern, Western, Northern, and Midwestern Regions in 1963; 12 States structured by Gowon in 1967; 19 States in 1976 by Murtala Mohammed; 21 States in 1987 by Babaginda; 30 States in 1991 by Babaginda; and 36 in 1996 by Sani Abacha. Despite the reasons adduced for the creation of states, development has eluded Nigerian states because of the overriding personal interests of the leading (political, military, and economic) elites, religion, ethnicity, military incursion into politics, and other factors, contributed to the developmental illusion. Consequently, the nation-state called Nigeria continued to fail, due to the political ineptitude of the leaders and the lack of political capacity to harness the natural, human, and other resource endowments to develop the country, Nigeria. In this paper, we shall be exploring how the Nigerian State has impacted development. Before that, let’s quickly have a brief introduction.\n\nIntroduction Before 1914, no country existed as Nigeria, but a geographical expression of multiethnic nations with distinct languages, religions, cultures, economic modes, and political organizations, amongst others, inhabited the land mass now called Nigeria. In the history of West Africa, the country enjoyed the luxury of being home to empires like the Kanem-Bornu Empire, Benin Empire, Oyo Empire, Sokoto Caliphate, and other kingdoms like the Hausa kingdoms, and the Nri Kingdom, etc. The Nigeria State, better known as the Federal Republic of Nigeria, came to be in 1914, with the amalgamation of Southern and Northern Protectorate by Lord Frederick Lugard. The country is situated in West Africa between the Sahel region to the north of the Sahara Desert and the Gulf of Guinea to the south of the Atlantic Ocean. She shares borders with Niger Republic in the North, Chad in the Northeast, Cameroon in the East, Benin Republic in the West, and the South, bounded by the Atlantic Ocean. After decades of colonial administration through indirect rule, Nigeria became independent on 1st October 1960, and a Republic in 1963. However, it must be noted that colonial rule led to the spread of Christianity and the establishment of Western education in Nigeria. Between the 1950s and before the first military coup in 1966, she was governed by central and regional governments. The regional governments were Eastern, Midwestern, Western, and Northern, headed by a Premier, and economically, the regional governments, strived to develop their region. Unfortunately, in 1967, Nigeria drifted into civil war due to the failures of the leaders to prioritize Nigeria’s interest above regional and ethnic protectionism; by 1970 when the war ended, deep distrust, injustice, and suspicion became the order of the day. Igbos, for instance, were said to be the victims of the war as they lost their properties scattered across Nigeria. Holding on to power by the military at the end of the war, failure to sincerely implement the 3Rs of reconciliation, rebuilding, and reconstruction, as well as the subsequent overthrow of a democratically elected government in 1981, robbed the Nigerian state of the chance to build a new united Nigeria, where equity, fairness, justice, and rule of law prevails. Though, a civil rule through elections has been established in Nigeria since May 29th, 1999, the Nigerian state has wobbled politically, and fallen into serious economic, social, and political crisis that makes development illusory. Before we delve into Nigeria’s developmental crisis, let’s take a brief journey into Nigeria’s political history.\n\nNigeria’s Political History The Nigeria state came to be in 1914 and it became the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 1963. The history of her political nationhood developed in phases. But for this discussion, we are going to prism the development of Nigeria’s nationhood from the perspectives of (1) Pre-colonial Nigeria, (2) Colonial Nigeria, and (3) Post-colonial Nigeria.\n\nPre-colonial Nigeria: During this period, there was no Nigerian state, instead, what existed were independent multiethnic nations with distinct languages, cultures, religions, judicial systems, political organizations, economic systems, and inter-relations in the areas of trade and commerce. Some of the ethnic nations grew to become empires with very organized political structures, trade, socio-economic systems, justice administration, and military systems. Notable empires and kingdoms in pre-colonial Nigeria were Kanem-Bornu, Oyo, and Benin, Hausa kingdom in the north, and Nri kingdom of Igbo land in the east, etc. According to the historical records of medieval Arab and Muslim historians and geographers, the Kanem-Bornu empire was referred, to as the country’s major center for Islamic civilization. Furthermore, the Kanem-Bornu empire was said to oversee the Eastern Trade route of the Trans Sahara Trade route running from Bornu to Tripoli (Bornu - Fezzan - Ghadames – Ghat - Air-Fez - Tripoli). In southern Nigeria, coastal trade with Europeans flourished before the introduction of the slave trade. For instance, in the 16th century, Portuguese explorers were the first to begin direct trade with the people of southern Nigeria, in port cities like Calabar, Lagos, Badagry, Bonny Island, Brass Island, and Akassa. Benin and Oyo empires were also recorded as major slave trading empires. In the north, the continuous internal wars amongst the Hausa city-states and the fall of the Kanem-Bornu empire opened the gateway to the rise of the Fulani kingdom led by Usman Dan Fodio and the establishment of the Sokoto Caliphate. Before the Caliphate was conquered in 1903 by the British colonial administration, its territory expanded to modern-day northern and some parts of central Nigeria and had the largest concentration of slaves (2 million), who were used for agriculture. Following the outcome of the Berlin Conference of 1884/1885 the thriving Nigerian kingdoms and empires were overthrown by the British colonial administration which established its spheres of influence over the territories. For instance, in1851, Lagos was bombarded, and by 1861 it became a colony of Britain. Then, the Benin Empire followed in 1897. In 1900, with the establishment of the Southern Protectorate, western Nigeria came under British rule. In 1903, the Sokoto Caliphate was conquered, and in the east, the Nri kingdom was conquered in 1911. Thus, leading us to the era of colonial Nigeria.\n\n(2) Colonial Nigeria: Though the Nigerian State was born on 1st January 1914, following the amalgamation of Southern and Northern Protectorates, the British colonial rule divided and administered Nigeria in the order of Northern and Southern Protectorates, and Lagos Colony, introducing indirect rule policy without due considerations of the different historical, socio-economic and political background of the ethnic nations. Thus, creating the ember of disunity, which to date has remained a major problem plaguing the Nigerian state. For example, it was on record that the indirect rule policy of the British colonial administration, validated and legitimized Islamic tradition and culture in the north, forbade the operations of Christian missions in the north, encouraged the spread of Christianity, and established educational institutions by Christian missionaries, and built coastal economy of the south. The colonial rule midwifed a series of constitutional reforms, starting with the Clifford Constitution of 1922 to the 1960 Independent Constitution of Nigeria. Likewise, the administration was challenged with waves of political agitations by Nigerian nationalists, demanding deepened political reforms and self-rule. The agitations for self-rule got to its climax in 1953, when Chief Anthony Enahoro moved the motion for Nigeria’s Independence in the Parliament. Though the motion was defeated, once more, it exposed the divide-and-rule policy of the British colonial administration and the divide between the northern and southern Nigeria, as the northern members of the parliament, staged a walkout. Though the motion was reintroduced and passed in 1957 and 1958, by S. L Akintola and Remi Fani Kayode respectively, the British colonial authorities refused to ratify the passed bills. Until, eventually, in 1959, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa re-proposed the bill for Nigeria’s independence, and it was passed because of the sustained pressure on the colonial administration. Reacting to the pressure, the colonial governor announced the decision of the British government to grant independence to Nigeria on 1st October 1960. Unfortunately, at independence, and thereafter, Nigerians see themselves more as Northerners, Westerners, Easterners, Midwesterners, and Middlebeltans, than they see themselves as Nigerians. They were regionally inclined, recognized, and owned their allegiance to their regions of origin, thereby widening the gap of disunity. Today, not much difference in terms of allegiance has changed. No wonder political contest for elective positions like the ‘president’ of the country is heavily tilted or divided along ethnic lines or regions. This evil has spread to the state and local government elections. Very worrisome is that ‘National Interest’ has become an adjunct of regionalism and ethnicity, a vehicle for propagating primordial ethnic interests, exploitation, and sharing of political offices in Nigeria. This, explains why political appointments are heavily skewed in favour of the president’s ethnicity and region. Secondly, the imbalances between the north and south were expressed in Nigeria's political, social, and economic lives despite the fact the richest Nigerian is from the north. Particularly of note during the colonial administration was the growth and rise of nationalism and Nationalist movements in the agitations for political reforms and increasing constitutional government in Nigeria, and Nigeria’s independence. Nigerian nationalism was pioneered by Herbert Macaulay in the 1920s, with the sole purpose of uniting Nigerians of multiethnic backgrounds to resist colonialism. This is the root of structural imbalances within the nation due to the socio-economic projects, and establishment of administrative centers by colonial administration without regard to the wish of the people of Nigeria. The first of the nationalist movements was the Nigerian Youth Movement, founded in 1933 by Professor Eyo Ita, to champion the agitations against colonial rule. Its membership cuts across Nigeria’s multi-ethnic groups and had Nationalists like Stanley Orogun, Eyo Ita, Samuel Akisanya, Elnest Ikoli, Nnamdi Azikiwe, Obafemi Awolowo, H. O. Davis, Dr Kofo Abayomi, Adeyemo Alakija, amongst others. The Nigerian Youth Movement was equivocal in its opposition to the indirect rule policy of the colonial British Administration and advocated for complete autonomy within the British Empire based on equal partnership with the other member states. Though there were efforts by the colonial administration to repress Nigerian nationalism, it resulted in radical agitations and multiple secessionist movements demanding independence for Nigeria from colonial rule. The colonial administrators in 1960, had no choice but to grant Nigeria’s independence, in the wake of growing and increasing demand for self-rule. Besides political activities, economically the colonial administration developed an exploitative economic policy with the sole purpose of exploring and exploiting local Nigerian resources for the development of Britain. For instance, it is on record that the British government chartered the Royal Niger Company under George Taubman Goldie to gain control of trade and influence along the coastal states of Nigeria and the bank of the river Niger in her favour. Nigeria’s natural resources and agricultural produce were exploited and shipped to England. Such natural resources include coal mined in Enugu, Tin mined in Jos, and Crude oil, mined from Niger Delta regions. Agricultural produce shipped to Britain included palm oil for powering machines of industrial England, timber and plywood, cocoa, groundnuts, etc., as raw materials for British growing industries. Ironical, infrastructural developments like roads and bridges, railway lines, and seaports by the colonial administration were built to facilitate and promote British interest. For instance, Jos-Enugu-Port Harcourt railway lines were constructed to aid the transportation of Tin from Jos and coal from Enugu to Port Harcourt seaport, from where the products were shipped to Britain. Secondly, the internal roads and bridges were constructed to link the hinterlands to the coastal cities like Calabar, Lagos, Badagry, Bonny Island, and railway stations in cities like Kaduna, Kano, Jos, Ibadan, Abeokuta, etc., to facilitate the movement of goods for easy shipment to Britain. Further, it was argued that colonialism was created to find markets for industrial British companies, to obtain raw materials for their industries, and markets to sell their finished products, thereby enhancing the growth of British companies. Affirming the exploitation of Nigeria by the British colonial administration, Patrick Oluwole Ojo el ta opined that, radical scholars blame the persistent socio-economic challenges in Nigeria on the structural deficiencies created by the country’s colonial experiences, and that colonialism was a system designed not only to exploit, but also meant to keep Nigeria in permanent vulnerable position of underdevelopment. Despite the exploitation of Nigerian resources and destruction of our indigenous socio-economic and political structures by the British colonial administration, we must recognize the introduction of education by European missionaries, which helped in developing Nigerian nationalism and nationalists, sharpened nationalists’ voices, shaped agitations for Nigeria’s independence, and nurture Nigerians to become the managers of their affairs. Though, Nigeria is yet deeply yoked in neo-colonialism.\n\n3 Post-colonial Nigeria: In 1954, the road to self-rule was mapped, when Nigeria gained partial self-rule. This was followed with complete independence (self-rule) on 1st October 1960, when power transited to Nigeria’s government with Prime Minister (Abubakar Tafawa Balewa) driving and Governor-General (Nnamdi Azikiwe) on the passenger’s seat, thereby laying the foundation for Parliamentary system of government. Suffices, a national government was formed at the center by the coalition of Northern People’s Congress, headed by Sir Ahmadu Bellow, and National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons headed by Nnamdi Azikiwe, while the Action Group led by Obafemi Awolowo, functioned as the opposition party. The parties exhibited regional and ethnic characteristics in terms of membership spread and influence, which was a manifest expression of ethnic politics that laid the foundation for the corruption of the electoral and political process. It was the corruption of the political processes by the politicians that paved the way for the January 1966 military coup in Nigeria. The following counter-coup in May 1966 though, ushered in Gen. Yakubu Gowon’s administration, was also a manifestation of ethnic protectionism, and interpreted as a revenge coup against the Igbos who led the January 1966 coup, where leading politicians from the north were mostly victims. The aftermath of the coup and counter-coup was the ensuing unfortunate civil war, due to the failure and inability of the leaders to resolve the differences owing to distrust, politics of deception, ethnicity, and regional interest over Nigeria’s interest. While the war raged, Nigeria enjoyed an oil boom from crude oil exploration, and the huge revenues received from its exportation were wantonly miss-managed by the military administrations, its impact is still felt by Nigerians to date as small and medium businesses were not supported, and there was no reasonable investment in infrastructures. According to Wikipedia, in the article, ’Nigeria’, ‘’the oil revenues fueled the rise of federal subsidies to states, and the federal government became the center of political struggle and the threshold of power in the country. As oil production and revenue rose, the Nigerian government became increasingly dependent on oil revenues … for budgetary and economic concerns’’. Gowon’s administration was ousted by a 1975 coup of the triumvirate of three brigadier generals, who accused Gowon of being autocratic. General Murtala Muhammed became the head of State, while Olusegun Obasanjo was next in command, followed by Theophilus Danjuma. The government introduced political, economic, and social reforms. For instance, a timetable to return the country to civil rule was drawn, the civil service was purged of corrupt personnel, and austerity measures to control inflation. Unfortunately, Murtala was killed in a failed coup led by Colonel Buka Suka Dimka in 1976. Consequently, General Olusegun Obasanjo became the military head of state, supported by General Shehu Yar'Adua, and General Theophilus Danjuma. The government amongst its reform programmes were local government reform, and the setting up of a constitution drafting committee to return the country to civilian rule. Resulting of the reform, a civilian rule headed by Shehu Shagari was on 1 October 1979, sworn in as the first President and Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Thereby ushering Nigeria’s second republic. Shagari’s government was accused of total corruption in all sectors. Following the widespread vote-rigging and violence that characterized the 1983 election, Shagari’s government was overthrown in December 1983. Major General Muhammadu Buhari was installed as military head of state. In 1985, Gen. Ibrahim Babaginda overthrew Buhari in a palace coup d'état, accusing him of high-handedness. Babangida established the Nigerian Political Bureau to recommend how to transition Nigeria to the Third Republic. In 1989, Babangida started making plans for a transition into the Third Nigerian Republic. Notable amongst his political reforms were the formation of two political parties (SDP & NRC), and the OptionA4 voting procedure. Unfortunately, Babaginda annulled the June 12 election that was largely acclaimed to be won by Moshood Abiola and created the crisis of the Third Republic, which manifested into various resistance movements, the fall of his government in1993, and the ushering of Interim National Government, headed by Chief Ernest Shonekan in 1993. Shonekan’s Government was short-lived as he was overthrown by Gen. Sani Abacha in a commando style and installed himself as the Military Head of state. Abacha’s regime was regarded as the most punitive government in the history of Nigeria. For instance, he used wide-scale military force to suppress civilian agitation for the restoration of the 1983 June 12 election, and arrested and imprisoned Moshood Abiola, and a host of NADECO members. The height of his maximum rule was the hanging of environmental campaigner, Ken Saro-Wiwa and four Ogoni elders on trumped-up charges. In addition to being a maximum ruler, Abacha was not just corrupt but stole hundreds of millions of dollars from the government treasury. His regime came to a sudden end via sudden death. He was succeeded by, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, who initiated and adopted a new constitution on 5 May 1999, that laid the foundation for a return to civilian rule and provided for multiparty elections, thus leading us to the present democratic dispensation of twenty-four years of uninterrupted civilian rule in Nigeria. At this juncture, let’s pursue to briefly consider the concept of development.\n\nThe Concept of Development\n\nAccording to IGI Global.com, and Topper.com, ‘development is ‘the process that results in growth, progress, positive change, or the addition of physical, economic, environmental, social, and demographic components to an existing system or environment’’. According to Wikipedia, ‘Development is the result of society's capacity to organize resources to meet challenges and opportunities’’. Given the definitions above, development is a process that results in advancement through the capacity to harness the resources of the nation for political, economic, social, justice, security, and technological development. However, in the words of topper.com economic development refers to an improvement in the quality of life and well-being of the people of the economy. Adebayo (2013: 353) defines development, ‘’as an important mode of production in modern society and the key in classifying countries as developed, underdeveloped, developing or emerging economies based on their level of industrialization’’. This definition sees development from the perspective of production, and as an instrument of measuring development, in developing, and underdeveloped nations. Nonetheless, we can describe development as a growth process that promotes social, cultural, economic, security, technological, and political advancement of people from a state of weakness to strength, and it encompasses all aspects of human endeavour. As a growth process, it commands the capacity to respond and overcome social, cultural, economic, security, technological, and political crises legitimately. Culturally, it involves the use of various sequences of our cultural heritage and other variables to achieve national development. Development may result in the specialization which is because of new subsystems, new structures, and new roles created to meet the challenges ahead. Political development, for example, may result in equality, capacity, and differentiation while economic development could lead to a reduction in inflation, unemployment rate, and improved standard of living. On the other hand, security development entails total guarantying of peace, and protection of lives and property without fear or threat. Security development requires commitment, dedication, sacrifice, and focus from the drivers to enable it to realize its goal. Meaning, that quality leadership is a necessity if the development of a nation like Nigeria is to be realized. This is because the leader should be able to generate quality ideas and steer the ship of the nation’s development to a growth path; in addition to, having the emotional and mental attitude to harness the resources of the nation for political, economic, social, justice, technological, and cultural growth, and development of the nation. However, Nigeria has not been favoured or fortunate with leaders that have the political capacity and unquestionable integrity citizens can entrust with their sovereign power and can guarantee the security of their lives and property.\n\nImpacts of Nigerian State on Development. The journey of the development of the Nigerian statehood has been an unstable one. While several governments have had developmental plans to drive economic, social, and political growth, little has been achieved with the plans as government officials pay lip services to the plans and use the plans as conduit pipes for defrauding the nation. While this paper is not focusing on the developmental plans, we shall center our efforts on such elements as politics, security, ethnicity, leadership, religion, the justice system, and economic development in this phase of the discussion to underscore factors hindering Nigeria’s developmental efforts. Post-colonial Nigerian politics can best be described as a regressive error because, at independence, Africans and the world community had expected Nigeria to lead and champion the course of the black world and be a home for the black race. Unfortunately, the steam quickly faded away no sooner after her independence. Examining Nigeria’s political development to find the answer to why the steam faded quickly, one would say that colonial Nigeria was more politically active, with purposeful politicians who worked for the growth and development of the nation than the era of post-colonial Nigeria, particularly, after the fall of First Republic. For instance, history will not forget nationalists like Herbert Macaulay, Nnamdi Azikiwe, Obafemi Awolowo, Ahmadu Bello, Tafawa Balewa, Anthony Enahoro, Stanley Orogun, Eyo Ita, Samuel Akisanya, Elnest Ikoli, H. O. Davis, Dr Kofo Abayomi, Adeyemo Alakija, K. O. Mbadiwe, Denis Osadebe, etc., who worked assiduously to wrestle Nigeria’s independence from Britain and gave the sound bite that Nigeria is the hope of the black race. Their politicking was pure, selfless, sacrificial, inclusive, and borderless of ethnicity, as they projected the Nigerian dream before the world. Unfortunately, the political gains of the nationalists were eroded by the military, who invaded the political space, ceased political power, derailed Nigeria’s progress, and dashed the hope of Nigeria leading the black race in the community of world affairs.\n\nHowever, the present politics of Nigeria christened the Fourth Republic, is nothing, but a piece of soured, rotten, and decayed apple. The present politicians, benefiting from the sacrifices of Nigeria's founding fathers, are only motivated to public office for personal interest and gains rather than the interest of the Nigerian state. They deceitfully used the instruments and resources of the Nigerian state to climb to socio-economic and political positions of influence and turn around to defraud the state and subject Nigerian citizens to untold suffering. They manipulate ethnicity, regionalism, and religion to escalate and widen the gap of political divide between the once peaceful, loving ethnic groups in Nigeria for their selfish gain. To further entrench their political evil, they institutionalized political patronage, entitlement, and godfatherism to perpetuate their continuous stay in government and stealing of public funds. They turned polling booths into national robbery booths, where electorates are robbed of their voting rights and the political will to decide who governs them. Hence the current crops of political office occupiers in Nigeria are nothing but civilian coup plotters and vote robbers with the INEC chairman as the coup brigade commandant. Because of the false processes of producing political office holders, Nigeria carries a red flag of integrity question mark before the international community. In addition, politicians manipulate the justice system and appoint counterpart corrupt judicial officials to head litigations involving them, to obtain favourable judgments and earn false integrity in a broad day rape of justice, where only three or five or seven-man judge, void votes of thousands/millions of Nigerians. Fresh in our minds are the certificate saga of the previous and present administrations involving ex-president Buhari and current president Tinubu, which publicly embarrassed the Nigerian nation and her citizens. The display of political selfishness also came into play in Wike’s political base song in the unsuccessful impeachment attempt on Similaye Fubara, the governor of Rivers State. The display of political rascality and selfishness notwithstanding, twenty-four years of uninterrupted civilian rule is something to cherish in high hopes that one day, Nigerians will smile.\n\nIn the sphere of security, the country cannot be said to have developed the capabilities to deal with security challenges like cybercrime, terrorism, and electronic warfare. Though Nigeria may have active and functional security organizations and succeed in fighting against session and reuniting the east with other parts of the country, the current challenges of Cybercriminals, terrorist groups, and the growing trend of Electronic Warfare, called for a new national defence and security strategy to curb the activities of criminal groups. This is becoming more worrisome given that terrorists, cybercriminals, and other criminal groups are exploiting and leveraging the advantage of technology (using social media) to perpetrate crimes. Terrorist organizations, for example, use social media to recruit, indoctrinate, and assign terrorist attacks to new members. While cybercriminals are hacking into governments, organizations, individual assets, and information to defraud the victims of Billions of Dollars. In Nigeria, the Boko Haram sect, ISWA, and Bandits have continued to cause havoc on Nigerian nationhood, ceasing part of the country, forcing the people to pay taxes of various natures, kidnapping for ransom, killing people, and destroying valuable property. For instance, it was estimated that over 3,500 people were internally displaced, 264 children orphaned, 392 women widowed, several police and military personnel killed, several police stations razed, and over 700 inmates were forcefully released, to mention just a few of the havoc caused the nation by terrorist groups. Illuminating further, Aderonke (2015) observed that, ‘in Nigeria, the upsurge of terrorism engineered by Boko Haram poses grave security challenges to the nation’. Akpomera, & Omoyibo, (2013), said. ‘Nigeria currently faces security and developmental dilemma with the crucible of terrorism largely enveloped in the foreign policy perspective with neighbours’’. Prof.I.C. Achumba El ta (2013), quoting Kufour (2012), noted that the cause of insecurity in Nigeria are, political conflicts; unbalanced development that involves horizontal inequalities; religious/ethnic distrust; and leadership failure. While Eunice Reddick according to Prof.I.C. Achumba El ta (2013), associated insecurity with the low level of economic development because of poor governance and high-level of corruption, and said corruption is “the walls that stand in the way of progress, the red tape that stops an idea from becoming a business, the patronage that distributes wealth based on tribe and sect”. Impliedly, poor governance as a manifestation of weak leadership, political entitlement, corruption, ethno-religious distrust, and failure of the electioneering process to produce capable leaders, are accountable for Nigeria’s inability to develop her security capability and capacity to guarantee absolute security to her citizenry. Nigeria security elites are wickedly corrupt and like their political allies, mismanaged the trust bequitted upon them, and turned themselves into instruments of oppression and suppression against the ordinary Nigerian. In some cases, they have become the antithesis of the constitution they swore to uphold. However, responding to the security threat, the Nigerian government developed a new National Security Strategy to fight the growing security threat arising from threatening security challenges.\n\nEconomically, several elements have crippled the development of the Nigerian state. Leading the pack is, the Nigerian state lacked political leaders without blemish to catapult her to the paths of economic development and growth despite operating a democratic system of government. Though it’s argued that development and democracy complement each other, working side by side, successive governments (democratic and non-democratic) in Nigeria, have demonstrated a lack of political will to initiate or sustain economic policies or structural transformation, or to embark on sound economic reform to reposition the country for greatness in all ramifications. According to Akinola (2008), Nigeria’s ‘poor macroeconomic management, continues to display the attributes of a state in crisis. In the words of Dhikru and Adeoye (2016), ‘With the weakness of the Nigerian state and its ineffectiveness, it has become challenging to eradicate impoverishment, engage in infrastructural development, and stem the tides of insurgency and terrorism, which have the potency to derail the country’s moderate political development’. No doubt, the issue of failure of political leadership with the willpower (capacity) to direct economic development and growth remains topmost. Mimiko (2010) opined that ‘the Nigerian state has degenerated to the point where it is unable to provide minimal social security for its vulnerable population’. Impliedly, the government of Nigeria failed to uphold the principle of accountability to the people as democracy demands. Consequently, corruption or corrupt practices by the political elites become a reoccurring decimal in the economic development woes of the Nigerian state. According to Patrick Oluwole Ojo el ta, ‘corruption constitutes the key factor underlying the continuing underdevelopment debacle and the seemingly intractable socio-economic development in Nigeria’. Ilufoye Ogundiya el ta (2008), noted that ‘governance surely hinders development where it manifests in corrupt practices; greed and insatiable appetite for resource accumulation’. Aliyu and Elijah (2009), said, ‘Corruption carts resources away from government capital expenditure and human capital development and ends up in private pockets. However, Teresa Nogueira (2023), questioned Nigeria’s breed of federalism and said, ‘’Nigeria’s “hybrid” federal system and overall poor leadership are impediments to development as the country continues to experience rapid demographic growth combined with economic stagnation’’. Finally, the practice of feeding bottle federalism will continue to hinder real economic development and growth in Nigeria, as the philosophy of fiscal federalism has been jettisoned, and centralized federal government control of the country’s revenue is imposed on the federating states. Describing what economic action Nigeria should take, the World Bank (1997), said, ‘’No matter the upsurge of globalization and the prospects of the borderless state, the expectation is for states to take a decisive role in economic transformation, growth, and development and jettison every act that is inimical to improved livelihood as well as socioeconomic and political development of the country’’.\n\nEthnicity and regionalism, in the scheme of the development of the Nigerian state, have their fair share in underdeveloping Nigeria. Before l go into the discussion, let me acknowledge that the various ethnic groups had existed harmoniously before colonialism with distinct cultural and linguistic differences as autonomous societies. Nonetheless, the foundation for communal sentiments among the various ethnic groups was laid by colonialism. Attesting to this notation, J. S. Coleman (1958), wrote, ‘’In 1920, Sir Hugh Clifford, the colonial Governor of the country at the time, made it abundantly clear that his administration would seek to secure, ‘’to each separate people the right to maintain its identity, its individuality and its nationality, its chosen form of government; and the peculiar political and social institutions which have been evolved for it by the wisdom and the accumulated experiences of generations of its forebears’’. However, ethnicity and regionalism in contemporary Nigeria were products of socioeconomic competition between the hosts and migrant communities due to colonialism. Thus, leading to the formation of ethnic groups to protect their interests and guarantee socioeconomic security. Confirming this assertion, Nnoli (1978), wrote, ‘Both migrants and hosts organized themselves along communal lines to safeguard their interests in the struggle for the scarce and un- equally distributed resources’’. Examples of such ethnic groups include the Yoruba Union, Ibo Union, Calabar Improvement League, Owerri Divisional Union, Urhobo Renascent Convention, Igbirra Progressive Union, etc. Arising from the socioeconomic struggles were unequal income, unequal employment, and social status differentiation among the ethnic groups, which formed the ember of blame, frustration, and strengthening of communal groups (protectionism) to better their lots, thereby giving birth to ethnicity. According to Nnoli (1978), in 1945, Eyo Ita, sensing the negative trend that was emerging because of the growing power of these parochial associations, warned that ‘’the greatest need of Nigerians today is to become a community…to evolve a national selfhood’’. Akinsanya-Ikoli succession conflict in the Nigeria Youth Movement was a classical manifestation and demonstration of ethnic prejudice and the underlining political struggle and danger associated with ethnicity, which to date has engulfed Nigerian politics.\n\nDuring the colonial administration, ethnicity complicated national politics as it determined the formation of political parties and regional governments and laid the foundation for minority agitation out of fear of being dominated by a majority ethnic group. Consequently, at independence, the three major political parties (Northern People's Congress, National Council of Nigeria Citizens, and Action Group) had ethnic and regional colorations. The military coups of 1966 and the consequential civil war in 1967, were all influenced and determined by ethnicity and regional bias, consideration, or protectionism. In post-independent Nigeria, both political and nonpolitical elites have continued to plunder the wealth of Nigeria hiding under the cover of ethnic and regional protection. They destroy national structures like the Federal Character principle for socioeconomic and political development while promoting nepotism, ethnic favouritism, political patronage, and settlement while sacrificing merit on the altar of ethnicity and regional cleavages. Presently, this evil is inflicted on the Nigerian state through the collaboration of politicians, bureaucrats, military elites, economic class, and royal monarchs, who are the projectors and defenders of ethnicity and regionalism. In the elections of 2015, 2019, and 2023, regionalism and ethnicity reached prominence as a major determining equation in electing Nigeria’s president. Illuminating how the ruling elites manipulated ethnicity to better their lot over the seasons, Prof. Richard Sklar (1967), said, ‘’ethnic movements may be created and instigated to action by the new men of power in furtherance of their special interests which are time and again constitutive interests of emerging social class’’. Further, he described ethnicity as a mask for class privileges. The greatest danger of ethnicity to the Nigerian state is that political leaders own their allegiance to their ethnic regions thereby subverting the Nigerian constitution they swore to protect. Secondly, political appointments into government offices, are heavily skewed in favour of ethnicity and regionalism. Finally, there is the danger of consciously weeping up ethnic sentiments and the use of ethnic symbols by politicians in mobilizing for political support and promotion of selfish interests.\n\nLeadership is adjudged the greatest challenge of the Nigerian State. That is the inability of Nigeria inspite of her being blessed with intelligent and hard-working men and women, to produce a leader who is resourceful, fearless, capable, and has the capacity to drive the wheel of progress of the nation from a state of weakness to greatness by harnessing her endowed human, natural, material, and technological resources. That is a leader who has a clear vision and mission of leading the country by placing national interest above personal, ethnic, religious, and regional interests; a leader that guides, directs, listens, empathizes, and influences, as well as serves the people with a sense of purpose, selflessly, and communicates with the people respectfully. Finally, a leader with undoubted integrity, accountable, and the citizenry can believe and trust every word he/she communicates. Unfortunately, Nigeria has had a series of political and nonpolitical leaders with unlimited greed and has institutionalized the culture of greed in every fabric of Nigerian society, thus, resulting in failed leadership and Nigeria state, as a true reflection of her leadership problem. Emphasizing Nigeria’s failed leadership, Oboma Daniel Ebun (2016), opined, ‘’Nigeria…is greatly endowed with natural resources but bankrupt of visionary and selfless leadership’’. Exploring Nigeria’s leadership, one will argue that the leadership represents a leader in that society Julius Nyerere (1969), described as ‘one man, …can acquire as a great ‘reward’ as a thousand of his fellows can acquire between them”. In the words of Nnamdi Azikiwe (1980), ‘Nigeria is an affluent society where there are few very rich and very many very poor’. These statements affirm that Nigerian leaders are not only greedy and corrupt but politicize the welfare of the citizens by tormenting them with the basic necessities of life like food and shelter security. No wonder a Nigerian politician spent twice the cost of the project to commission the project. Hence, the citizens are the helpless victims of the social contract between them and the leaders. Another characteristic of Nigerian leaders is that of playing gods. They speak as if they are not mortals, and life and death are in their hands. Have you listened to these formal governors: Nyesom Wike, El Rufai, and Adams Oshomole, for example? Describing them as emperors is underestimating the powers they arrogated themselves. Instead, they backstaged every quality of leadership in the words of Jacob & Jacques (1990), that, “leadership is a process of giving purpose to collective effort and causing willing effort to be expended to achieve collective purpose.”; Jeb Blount (2012), that ‘leadership is about hard work, self-discipline, and sacrifices. It is the notion of sacrifices that concerns us here. Nigerian leaders never sacrifice for the development of the nation; rather, they keep asking the people to continue to sacrifice for their fatherland, while they plunder the commonwealth. They are disconnected from the people and are clouded by selfish gains instead of selfless service to the people. They lack principles, values, and ethical standards, which are the hallmarks of leadership. Hence, when they say they are ‘servant leaders’, they mean that they are the masters while the people are the slaves. Leaders in Nigeria are not leaders but dictators with overbearing oppressive tendencies, dictating to the people what they feel is right or wrong, forgetting the meaning of achieving collective purpose through the collective efforts of all. Their policy initiatives are hurting instead of succoring to the people. Because of their primitive accumulation of public wealth and wasteful expending of the treasury, they lived in fear, in over-walled mansions, surrounded by security operatives who were enough to form a battalion. I will summarize this half by agreeing with Oboma Daniel Ebun (2016), who said, ‘’The history of the leadership of Nigeria is filled with leaders who are corrupt, incompetent, rigid, intolerant, insensitive, callous, egoist, visionless and tribalistic. It is little wonder then that these leaders have not been able to harness the human and economic resources of the country to bring about an enviable development’’.\n\nReligion, though, has been argued is complimentary to development; like ethnicity or regionalism, is one of the elements that has impacted the development of the Nigerian state. Nigeria is a free religious country where her citizens freely worship and express their religious beliefs unmolested. In pre-colonial Nigeria, the ethnic groups practiced different religious beliefs, commonly called ‘Traditional Religion’. The political, socio-economic, and justice systems of the people were closely intertwined with religion in their rituals, and they acted as a moral gauge of the standard behaviour of the people. It was a mirror of self-conscience in propagating the moral ethics of the societies. For instance, religion preaches love, fairness, and equity, as it emphasizes, ‘do unto others what you want them to do unto you’. Going further, it is not an overstatement to say that trade, commerce, and religion grew side by side as Traditional priests, Christian, and Islamic preachers played the dual role of promoting religion and acting as trade and commercial representatives of individuals and the major trading companies like Royal Niger Company. A deep overview of the relationship between religion and socioeconomic and justice systems, makes one argue that religion was the foundation upon which the justice and socio-economic systems thrived. For instance, instances abound when traditional religious priests had to preside over social trade or land disputes. During colonial rule, the role of religion was not diminished, instead, it gained prominence as the country was divided along religious lines - Southern Christians and Northern Moslems, and traditional religion became stigmatized, and less prominent, as practitioners, were perceived as ‘evil men’. However, explaining the role of religion on national development, Okechukwu Odinaka Ajegbu (2012), opined that ‘religion has positively affected the Nigerian economy through its teachings. People are thought to believe in their capability to create wealth, jobs are created both directly and indirectly by religious institutions, taxes from their investments are paid to the government, etc., and all these help to boost the economy of the country and improve the living standard of the people. Nonetheless, the political elites have manipulated the religious divide for their selfish gain and have successfully used religious cover or conflict to deceive the citizenry, further divide the country, and threaten her corporate existence. Another dangerous use of religion by politicians in Nigeria is ‘religious identity’ in the sharing of political offices along religious divides amidst strong criticisms of unbalanced representation by Christians and Muslims alike. According to Okechukwu Odinaka Ajegbu (2012), ‘Christian and Muslim identities have been the mainstay of religious differentiation and conflict, with Nigerian Muslims much more likely to evince or articulate a religious identity than Christians’. Unfortunately, this threatening danger is a time bomb waiting to explode and engulf the country. It is very painful that the political elites careless about it because they interplay religion and politics to gain acceptance of the electorates by visiting religious houses during campaigns to secure the endorsement of prominent religious leaders and the sympathy of the religious group. Further, the insecurity bedeviling the nation, particularly, terrorism, has been linked to religion. According to Hoffman (1993), ‘It is also a fact that about a quarter of all terrorist groups and …half of most the dangerous ones on earth are primarily motivated by religious concern’. This is true of the Boko Haram sect, ISWA, and Bandits terrorist groups in northern Nigeria, who are mainly Muslim youths, used and dumped political thugs, that metamorphosed into terrorist groups. No wonder one of the key objectives of Boko Haram is overthrowing ‘injustice’. That is overthrowing the injustice of age-long deprivation, denial, oppression, suppression, and 'use and dump', perpetuated by the political elites. Hence, one will argue that religious terrorism in Nigeria is self-inflicted. Okechukwu Odinaka Ajegbu (2012), said, ‘religious terrorism can be quite extreme in its tactics…it strives to avenge a long history of persecution and injustice’. The question that needs to be answered here is, is religious terrorism inimical to Nigeria’s development? Again, Okechukwu Odinaka Ajegbu (2012), provides an answer when he states that ‘religious terrorism in Nigeria possess a significant threat to national development as it is evident in Northern Nigeria where economic and social activities in some of the highly volatile States (Yobe and Borno) have almost been grounded by the stream of killings, destruction of basic means of livelihood of the people and truncating of foreign and local investments; thereby becoming a cock on the wheel of development of the States and Nigeria at large’. Consequently, religion has thus, become an instrument of self-destruction as religious groups engaged themselves in unhealthy competitions with animosity and suspicion of each other in a tense atmosphere, ready to explode. Secondly, the use of force, intimidation, arson, kidnapping, and killing of worshipers in cold blood by some fanatical religious groups, breeds hatred and further makes religion clogs in the wheel of the progress of the Nigerian state. I will conclude this section on religion by quoting Ogenyi and Ukpe (2013), who quoted Ogbeide (2012), ‘…religion is a double-edged sword and can create social order, harmony, cohesion, and stability while it can be used by wealthy and powerful people to exploit and oppress the people therefore, becoming a veritable source of violent conflicts and social dislocation’.\n\nThe justice system is next in the series of our discussion. The judiciary by definition of democracy is the balancer on the principles of ‘Rule of Law’. It adjudicates and interprets the law according to the Constitution. Because of its fairness in executing its functions, it is regarded as the ‘hope of the common man’, a guarantor, and a protector of the rights of the people. Essentially, the primary duty of the judicial system is, the settlement of conflicts between the national and subnational governments, subnational governments, governments, and individuals/groups on the one hand, and among individuals or groups on the other, based on the existence of a constitutional legal framework. But in Nigeria, whether in a democratic or undemocratic government, the judiciary is under siege and has become an instrument of oppression in the hands of the elites. Consequentially, the justice system is an evil hill on the path of the development of the Nigerian state. It truly represents Karl Marx’s view of justice in a social system, where the elites (judges, lawyers, politicians, academians, businessmen, Kings, etc.) deliberately manipulate the law to protect their unlawful actions, legitimize criminality, protect criminal agents, accept abnormal behaviour, and makes rules to protect their interests. In the same vain, judicial workers organized and aligned themselves as willing tools, in cult-like manners for the sake of perverting justice with their cohorts. The court system, for example, allots judgments and decides who wins a case based on class or group distinction. Secondly, they unlawfully institutionalized selective justice and enforcement of the law. For instance, highly placed elites hardly serve their prison terms in the prisons, and neither do law enforcement agents arrest them for crimes against the state. For example, it is only in Nigeria that convicts win elections from inside the prisons. The criminal justice system in addition to being selective, mainly concerns itself with policing and punishing the marginalized, not the wealthy, and those that perform clandestine functions for the elite. In the words of David Gordon, ‘The justice system mainly focuses on prosecuting the underclass criminals while ignoring the crimes of the elite and the middle classes. Hence, the justice system does not pretend about its continuous maintenance and protection of the ruling class by making rules to reinforce ruling class ideology, punish or intimidate perceived opponents, and unfaithful followers, and those tagged as ‘social failures’ to wade off oppositions, shift attention from, and hide the evils of their actions through the use of state instruments like the court, police and media. According to Chambliss (1978), ‘the ruling class (politicians and business owners) were part of a crime syndicate who used their wealth and influence to bribe officials and avoid punishment. Snider (1993), said that laws protecting the ruling class were rigorously enforced while those that protected ordinary people were more \"for show\". Hence, the country is entangled in the social conflict of judicial betrayal because the judges, lawyers, politicians, academicians, business class, top-place traditional rulers, social bourgeoisie, and owners of productive forces keep corrupting, manipulating, and influencing the justice system to perpetuate the elites in power, and their evil acts. The constitution which ought to be the foundation of the law of governance, is set aside, while executive lawlessness in the name of ‘Presidential or Executive Order’ usurps the constitution. Illuminating further, Dhikru and Adeoye (2016), quoting Akinseye George (2000), opined, ’lack of judicial independence and its associated ills, a recipe for misgovernance and maladministration, particularly by the executive arm of government, which manifested in many folds during military rule and did not significantly improve even in the country’s several attempts to democratize in the Second, Third, and Fourth Republics. Volumes of instances of abuse of the judiciary, misapplication of the rule of law, controversial judgments, and threats of judicial officials exist. Notable examples are the invasion of judges' homes by DSS officers in 2016, and the Code of Conduct Bureau and Code of Conduct Tribunal trial of former Chief Justice Onoghen.\n\nSince the judicial arm of government is now an appendage of the president or governor, judges like the biblical or proverbial salt, lost their taste or integrity because they lack the courage to say 'no' or have the dignity to resign from office when the executive order is against their ethical and constitutional vows. Secondly, lawyers like Nicodemus jostle between the judge’s chambers bidding and delivering the ‘Ghana-must-go Sacks’ stalked with evil money to pervert justice. Describing the contribution of the justice system to Nigeria’s development, Simbine &Oladeji (2010), accused the justice system of partisanship when they wrote, ‘It should be noted that, rather than check the excesses of the then government, the judiciary, in several instances, appeared partisan’. Rather, in my view, are 'partisan' as the minister of justice and the attorney general is a political appointee of the president. No wonder judges with vested interests are appointed to judge on cases concerning the elites. To conclude this discussion, l will quote Adamolekun (2016), who said that, 'a review of the activities of this arm, since 1960, reveals that it suffered “critical oscillations and dwindling fortunes in development and performance’. Therefore, to have a performing justice system with rising fortunes requires a sincere and honest leader in dear need of a free and independent judiciary, devoid of all forms of judicial bias, and judicial officers with unquestionable integrity.\n\nConclusion The issues we discussed and those not mentioned, do not mean that the Nigerian state is bad, rather, they have hindered her development and growth and denied her her status in the Committee of Nations. While we agree that the development of the Nigerian state is bedeviled with many problems, some not discussed in this presentation, some of the issues were pre-colonial, others colonial, and the most threatening ones were post-colonial. These are the self-inflicted problems like insecurity (militancy, Islamization, banditry, kidnapping for ransom, cybercrime, etc.), economic crimes (like stealing and flighting of public funds, over-invoicing, and inflation of government contracts), social infrastructural crime (deliberate arson, conversion, and destruction of public infrastructures), Politics of bitterness (politics of disunity and distrust, abuse of executive, legislative and judicial powers, anti-people policies), etc. I called them most threatening because these problems are avoidable with the rightful leader, who can harness, nurture, and utilize the resources of the nation for her development and growth. Unfortunately, Nigeria and Nigerians have not been fortunate with the right leader like Moses to lead them to the promised statehood.\n\nReferences 1.
