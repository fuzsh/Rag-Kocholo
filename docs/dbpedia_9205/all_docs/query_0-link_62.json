        "text": "Collecting African Tribal Art : 140 Years of Nigeria\n\nJuly 21, 2023\n\nThis timeline provides an overview of the major events leading to Nigeria’s independence in 1960 and administrative expansion to 36 states in 1996, highlighting the formation of the Lagos interest, Southern Nigeria Protectorate, and Northern Nigeria Protectorate as key steps in the country’s journey toward self-governance. It is the first of a multi-part Series which will hopefully act as an informational resource and provide some clarity on items and locations related to Ife, Benin City vs Benin, modern Nigerian states, Sokoto vs the Sokoto Caliphate, and other regions.\n\n1860s:\n\n• Lagos becomes a British colony in 1861.\n\n1880s:\n\n• The British establish the Oil Rivers Protectorate in the Niger Delta region, which later becomes the Southern Nigeria Protectorate.\n\n• “Ijebu (also known as Jebu or Geebu) is a Yoruba kingdom in Nigeria. It was formed around the fifteenth century. According to legend, its ruling dynasty was founded by Obanta whose personal name was Ogborogan of Ile-Ife“.\n\n• “The Egba nation is made up of the following subdivisions: the Ake, Owu, Oke Ona and Gbagura, each with its own king. (Historically, the Egba nation is made up of these four divisions; Ibara, though geographically located in Abeokuta as well, is part of Yewaland.) During colonial rule the British recognised the Alake (or King of Ake) as the paramount ruler of the whole clan and their territory, and so, his successor is now referred to as the Alake of Egbaland”.\n\n• “The Owus are mainly concentrated at Ago-Owu in Abeokuta, but a larger number of Owu towns may be found elsewhere across the Yoruba empire. The Yoruba kingdom stretches into the Republic of Benin from Nigeria’s borders”.\n\n• The Benin expedition of 1897 was a massacre resulting in the destruction and looting of the “Kingdom of Benin, also known as the Edo Kingdom or the Benin Empire. It has no historical relation to the modern republic of Benin, which was known as Dahomey from the 17th century until 1975. The Kingdom of Benin’s capital was Edo, now known as Benin City in Edo State, Nigeria. The Benin Kingdom was “one of the oldest and most developed states in the coastal hinterland of West Africa“. It grew out of the previous Edo Kingdom of Igodomigodo around the 11th century AD, and lasted until it was annexed by the British Empire in 1897″.\n\n1900s:\n\n• The Southern Nigeria Protectorate is merged with the Lagos Colony in 1906 to form the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria.\n\n• The British also establish the Northern Nigeria Protectorate, comprising areas in the north.\n\n1914:\n\n• The Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria and the Northern Nigeria Protectorate are amalgamated into the single Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria on January 1, 1914, with its capital in Lagos.\n\n1930s:\n\n• Nationalist movements begin to emerge, advocating for greater autonomy and independence from British rule.\n\n1940s:\n\n• World War II significantly impacts Nigeria, leading to further calls for self-governance and independence.\n\n1950s:\n\n• Nigeria experiences a surge in nationalist activities, with prominent figures like Nnamdi Azikiwe, Obafemi Awolowo, and Ahmadu Bello leading the way for self-rule.\n\n• Constitutional conferences are held to discuss the country’s future political structure.\n\nOctober 1, 1960:\n\n• Nigeria gains its independence from British colonial rule, becoming a sovereign nation with a parliamentary system of government.\n\n• The first Prime Minister of Nigeria, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, takes office, and Nnamdi Azikiwe becomes the country’s first President.\n\n1987-1996"
