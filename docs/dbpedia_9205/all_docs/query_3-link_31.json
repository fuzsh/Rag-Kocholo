        "text": "Following the Nigerian Civil War, Enugu State experienced various political changes and reorganizations. It became the capital of East Central State and later part of Anambra State. Eventually, on August 27, 1991, Enugu State was created as an independent entity during General Ibrahim Babangida’s administration. In the post-independence era, Enugu State saw significant developments in various sectors. The state continued to be a vital agricultural producer, contributing to Nigeria’s food security. Infrastructure, education, healthcare, and other essential services underwent improvements. The city of Enugu maintained its significance as a commercial and entertainment hub in the region. It attracted tourists with its historical landmarks, vibrant markets, and warm hospitality. Enugu State’s history is deeply intertwined with its rich cultural heritage. The Igbo people celebrate various festivals, such as the New Yam Festival (Iri Ji) and the Mmanwu festival (masquerade festival), which showcase their artistic expressions and spiritual beliefs. Traditional institutions, such as the Obi (monarch) and Igwe, play an essential role in preserving cultural identity and fostering communal harmony. Today, Enugu State stands as a testament to the resilience and ingenuity of its people. It embraces its history while striving for progress and prosperity. The state’s captivating journey continues to attract explorers of Nigeria’s history and culture, making it a destination of both historical significance and modern vibrancy.,"
