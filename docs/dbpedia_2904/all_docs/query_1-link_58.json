        "text": "As Yorkshire's biggest city and the fastest-growing economy in the country, Leeds is an exciting place to live – but what's it really like for students? Our complete guide has the low-down...\n\nFive universities, thriving nightlife, great job prospects and cheap Northern prices make Leeds a great city for students.\n\nAlthough Leeds has a huge population, geographically it's a smaller city than the likes of Manchester and Liverpool – in fact, it's known for being 'the biggest small city you'll ever visit'.\n\nThis means it's easy to get to grips with Leeds if you're moving away from home for the first time. Here's what Leeds has to offer...\n\nLeeds: Key facts\n\nNumber of universities: 5\n\nStudent population: 70,000+\n\nInternational students: 14,000+\n\nAverage rent cost: £526 a month\n\nAverage cost of a pint: £4.30\n\nI really enjoyed my time at Leeds during my undergraduate degree. There’s a really friendly student environment all across the city, and it became a home away from home.\n\nIt’s quite a safe and welcoming place to live, and really easy to get around. I lived in Headingley when I moved out of halls, which is a great area for students, close to lots of shops and pubs, but a lot quieter than the city centre.\n\nI would definitely recommend Leeds for new university students, I had some amazing experiences there.\n\nLucy, studied Biomedical Sciences at Leeds Beckett University\n\nUniversities in Leeds\n\nHoping to study in Leeds? These are the five universities in and around the city, with key facts about each one:\n\nThe University of Leeds\n\nThe University of Leeds is one of the 24 research-intensive Russell Group unis and typically appears in the top 20 of the main UK university league tables.\n\nIt's the city's most well-known university. As a research-led university, it has a focus on academic rather than vocational subjects, and entry requirements are generally quite high.\n\nThe university is one of the largest in the country, with over 39,000 students. It receives some of the highest numbers of applications every year, meaning some courses can be quite competitive to get on.\n\nIf you can't decide between a campus and a city university, Leeds Uni offers the best of both worlds. All buildings (and some halls of residence) are situated in one big campus in the north of the city, but the city centre is still only a 10-minute walk away.\n\nIt also boasts one of the best Students' Unions in the country, with over 300 clubs and societies, as well as a 360-seat student theatre, cafes, bars, music venues and a three-room nightclub which plays host to Fruity every Friday – an event guaranteed to become a major part of your uni experience.\n\nLeeds Beckett University\n\nThe University of Leeds' main rival, Leeds Beckett is the city's second-biggest university with over 17,000 undergraduate students and around 6,000 postgraduate students. You might also know it as Leeds Metropolitan University, which was its name up until 2014 when it was rebranded.\n\nLeeds Beckett is divided between two main campuses – one in the city centre, just a stone's throw away from the University of Leeds, and the other in a 100-acre park in Headingley, three miles north of the city.\n\nLeeds Beckett has seen a continual rise in university league tables over the past few years. It's a well-regarded, professional university boasting some excellent facilities.\n\nIt is also big on sport, particularly rugby, and has a strong rivalry with the University of Leeds which comes to a head at the annual Leeds Varsity.\n\nLeeds Trinity University\n\nLeeds Trinity is a little-known university with an impressive ethos – it was the first university to incorporate work placements as part of every degree.\n\nLeeds Trinity has around 10,000 undergraduate students. Every student who graduates has at least three months' of professional work experience under their belt, and the references and contacts which come with that.\n\nDegree subjects include the likes of Media, Film, Criminology, Sport and Physical Education, Psychology and Primary Teaching (generally more vocational subjects).\n\nTrinity is set apart from other Leeds universities (quite literally) because it's not actually situated in Leeds itself, but in a town six miles outside Leeds called Horsforth. Trains to Horsforth only take around 15 minutes from Leeds, and the university provides a free shuttle bus service to transport students from the train station to campus.\n\nLeeds Arts University\n\nLeeds Arts University is one of only a few specialist arts universities in the UK. Recently renamed from Leeds College of Art when it was granted university status, it offers degrees in subjects like Fashion Design, Photography, Fine Art and Animation.\n\nWith a population of around 2,000, it's a close-knit community and one of the smallest universities in the country. But it has spawned famous alumni including contemporary artist Damien Hirst and famous sculptor Henry Moore.\n\nIt has two main buildings; one in the north of the city near the University of Leeds and the other slap bang in the city centre, next to Millennium Square.\n\nLeeds Conservatoire\n\nLeeds Conservatoire is one of 11 specialist conservatoires in the UK, and has less than 2,000 students. In 2018 (under its former name Leeds College of Music) it was given its Higher Education Institution status. It became Leeds Conservatoire in 2020, reflecting its expertise and specialist approach to music and drama training.\n\nYou'll find state of the art facilities, including the Skyline library, six recording studios, seven mixing rooms with vocal rooms, six Mac labs, a DJ suite, bookable practice rooms, plus purpose-built performing arts spaces.\n\nIf piano's your jam, it's the only conservatoire in England with All-Steinway School status – meaning 90% of their pianos are Steinways.\n\nWhere are the universities in Leeds?\n\nThis map shows the locations of each of Leeds' universities:\n\nBefore you head off to uni, make sure you know how much money you're going to receive – our Big Fat Guide to Student Finance has you covered.\n\nCost of living in Leeds for students\n\nAs you'd imagine with it being a northern city, living costs in Leeds are pretty low – at least compared to London anyway.\n\nIn our latest Student Money Survey, we found out what an average student spends in Leeds, from rent and bills, to socialising and transport.\n\nOur survey found that the average student rent in Leeds is £526. This is lower than the national average – but bear in mind this can vary massively depending on whether you're living in halls or private housing.\n\nMonthly student living expenses in Leeds\n\nHere's how living costs in Leeds compare to the national average:\n\nExpenseLeeds averageNational student averageLeeds compared to national average Rent £398£439-£41 Groceries£114£113+£1 Takeaways & eating out£54£66-£12 Going out & socialising£82£69+£13 Travel£68£69-£1\n\nAnd the most important expense of all? Pints of beer should only set you back around £4.30 – that's around £1.70 cheaper than you would be paying in London. In fact, research suggests that Leeds is 16.98% cheaper than London overall.\n\nIf you want to go a step further, you can use our table of average student living expenses at each individual university to compare your university to the rest of the UK.\n\nWondering how much money your parents are expected to give you at uni? We've done the calculations for you...\n\nWhere to live in Leeds\n\nHalls of residence\n\nAll of the universities in Leeds have halls of residence available for students, which is typically where you will stay for at least your first year of study.\n\nYou'll find halls scattered all over the city – those in the centre or on campus tend to be more expensive than those further out. Common areas for university halls in Leeds include Burley, Headingley and Woodhouse.\n\nDeciding which halls to go for can be a stressful experience, but there's no right or wrong answer – it's all down to personal preference. And remember, if the worst comes to the worst, it's only for a year!\n\nPrivate halls\n\nLike many UK cities, there are plenty of private halls of residence popping up in Leeds. If you don't manage to get a place in halls through your university, or don't want to move into private housing, you can opt for these instead. However, they tend to be much more expensive compared to renting in a house, so make sure you budget for it.\n\nOne of the main private halls is the towering Sky Plaza, the second tallest student housing building in the world, which has en-suite rooms from £190 a week.\n\nPrivate housing\n\nThere are two main areas of student housing in Leeds – Hyde Park and Headingley.\n\nHyde Park is closest to the city centre (around a 20-minute walk) and is particularly close to the University of Leeds and Leeds Beckett University (city campus).\n\nYou'll find some good pubs in the Hyde Park area (as well as the famous Brudenell Social Club) and a couple of Sainsbury's Locals and takeaways. However, it is student central, so be prepared for house parties and pre-drinks at the weekends.\n\nHeadingley tends to be a bit quieter than Hyde Park, but it's further away from the city centre (around a 40-45 minute walk or 20 minutes by bus). Here, you're close to Headingley town centre, with its independent shops and restaurants, Headingley Stadium, a big Sainsbury's and half the pubs on the Otley Run.\n\nBurley Park is another popular area, situated vaguely in-between Headingley and Hyde Park, although it's not as well connected by bus as Headingley.\n\nIf you're looking for letting agents (and don't fancy getting ripped off) go through Unipol, as all the landlords and letting agents they work with must abide by the Unipol code of conduct designed to protect your rights as a tenant.\n\nOnce you've found somewhere to live, it's time to prepare for shared living!\n\nTransport in Leeds\n\nLeeds is a pretty compact city and many areas are within walking distance of each other, or just a short bus/train ride away.\n\nMake sure to check with your individual university about any other transport services they offer students. For example, The University of Leeds offers a £1 nightbus service that takes students from the SU to their front door from 8pm until building closure during term time.\n\nAnd, there are plenty of good options for public transport in the city...\n\nBest ways to travel around Leeds as a student\n\nSave money and time by using these forms of transport to get around Leeds:\n\nBus – First Bus day tickets cost £4.50, but they also offer Unlimited Student Travel tickets (about £60 a month on a rolling ticket, or £400 for the three terms).\n\nTrain – You can catch the train from Leeds' main station up to Burley Park or Headingley (two popular areas for student housing), and use your 16-25 Railcard for discounted tickets.\n\nTaxi – As well as private hire taxis like Uber, students at the University of Leeds and Leeds Beckett University can use Amber Cars, give the taxi driver their student card as a deposit, and pay for the taxi at the SU the next day.\n\nNote: It's worth waiting until you've arrived in Leeds before investing in a season travel ticket, as it will only save you money if you find you use that mode of transport a lot.\n\nEmployment opportunities in Leeds\n\nPart-time jobs\n\nAccording to our latest Student Money Survey, 62% of students turn to a part-time job for money at some point during their degree. If you think that will be you, then it's unlikely you'll be stuck for work somewhere like Leeds.\n\nOur Leeds student job search is a great place to start, or try Joblink at the University of Leeds or the MyHub jobs board at Leeds Beckett (or another student employment service).\n\nDon't forget to consider jobs at your university or Students' Union as well, as these will fit around your studies well.\n\nGraduate jobs\n\nLeeds has one of the UK's fastest-growing economies and its population has increased by over 150% in a decade. Its £64.6 billion economy is among the biggest in the UK outside London and is predicted to grow by 21% over the next 10 years.\n\nHere are some key facts about employment prospects and the graduate job market in Leeds:\n\nThe city's biggest economic areas are financial and business services\n\nRetail, leisure, construction, manufacturing and the creative and digital industries are also leading areas\n\nAsda Group, BT, Direct Line Group, First Direct, Centrica, Ventura and Yorkshire Bank are some of the city's biggest employers\n\nThere are over 8,500 digital and tech businesses in Leeds\n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises account for half of the city's employment\n\nThe University of Leeds and Leeds Beckett both have programmes and funding available to help students establish their own startup businesses.\n\nIn a nutshell, when you're looking for a graduate job, Leeds is a pretty good place to be.\n\nLifestyle in Leeds\n\nLeeds is a super vibrant city – there's plenty to see and do, lots of events and festivals to attend. And, as it's situated in the heart of Yorkshire, you're only a short bus ride away from some of the most stunning scenery in the UK. Here's a quick rundown of what to expect...\n\nNightlife\n\nOne of Leeds' main selling points is its huge range of nightlife options. From trendy bars to epic club nights and fancy dress bar crawls – however you like to let off steam after those deadlines, Leeds has got it all.\n\nFor classier affairs, there's Call Lane and Merrion Street where you'll find a whole host of trendy cocktail bars and low-key clubs. Highlights include Jake's Bar, Call Lane Social (and its Tiki Hideaway), MOJO and Verve.\n\nIf you're a fan of cheesy sing-along classics, you have to go along to Fruity Friday at Leeds University's SU – it's a Leeds rite of passage. Plus, there's PRYZM in the city centre which has loads of different rooms and all the chart hits.\n\nFor more alternative music, head to Wire for indie, electro and house, or HiFi for live music, soul, funk and hip-hop. Both are cool underground clubs at the bottom end of the city.\n\nFor big-name DJs (and lots of glitter and bumbags) Beaver Works and Mint Warehouse are both in old converted warehouses on the outskirts of the city and will be right up your street.\n\nIn Lower Briggate, you'll find a lively LGBTQ nightlife scene, with Viaduct Show Bar, Queens Court and Bar Fibre.\n\nFinally, no Leeds university experience is complete without an Otley Run. The famous pub crawl takes in around 15 pubs, starting at the far end of Headingley and finishing around the Dry Dock near the city centre (if you make it that far). The only rule is you have to do it in fancy dress – the more extravagant the better.\n\nYou're probably getting excited for freshers' week, but make sure you don't make these common mistakes!\n\nShopping\n\nLeeds has been referred to as the 'Knightsbridge of the North' as it's home to lots of designer stores and boutiques. Victoria Leeds, and Victoria Quarter arcade next door, are gorgeous to look at, but they don't really have student-budget shops.\n\nDon't worry though – slap bang in the middle of the city is the Trinity Centre, a huge shopping centre with all your favourite brands, including a massive Primark shop. Big student discounts are available at the shops, restaurants and cinema with a valid student card.\n\nThere's also Kirkgate Market, the original home of Marks and Spencer back in 1884, and the Corn Exchange, where you'll find quirky independent stores and vintage clothing.\n\nEating out\n\nIf you're a foodie, and think your student budget is going to stretch to allow you to eat out while at uni, you'll be spoiled for choice with places to go. In the Trinity Centre, you'll find Trinity Kitchen, a food court with independent eateries which change every eight weeks.\n\nFor more upmarket restaurants, head to Greek Street where you'll find places like Gusto and Slug and Lettuce. Or, for your cheaper chains (Nandos, Pizza Hut, Frankie & Benny's etc.), there's Cardigan Fields.\n\nFor an effective hangover cure, an all-day breakfast from the Greasy Pig is a must-try. We recommend the Loaf of Breakfast (literally a full English stuffed inside a loaf of bread) or the Paralyser.\n\nCulture\n\nIf you like to keep yourself busy at the weekend, there are loads of cultural sights and cheap activities to try in Leeds. In fact, the city was bidding to become the European Capital of Culture before Brexit put a spanner in the works.\n\nLeeds plays host to some amazing events every year. Leeds Light Night in October is a great free arts and lights festival, and of course, there's Leeds Festival, one of the biggest music festivals in the UK.\n\nTourist attractions in Leeds\n\nThe main attractions in Leeds include the Royal Armouries Museum (see picture above), the gorgeous Roundhay Park and Kirkstall Abbey. There's also Tropical World, an impressive collection of tropical plants and animals (and high temperatures!), and the Emmerdale Studio Experience if you fancy visiting the set of one of the country's most popular soaps.\n\nCloser to the city centre, there's the Thackray Medical Museum and Leeds Art Gallery, both of which are well worth a visit. For music and theatre, you've got the First Direct Arena and O2 Academy, and Leeds Grand Theatre and Leeds Playhouse respectively, so you'll never be short of some evening entertainment.\n\nIf you haven't already, see our tips on how to get free or cheap theatre tickets.\n\nSport\n\nLeeds United may not be as successful as they once were, but Leeds is still a big sporting city. Headingley Rugby Stadium is (as the name suggests) slap bang in the middle of the popular student area of Headingley, and you'll be able to see both Leeds Rhinos and Yorkshire Carnegie rugby league and union teams play there.\n\nOlympic medal-winning triathletes, the Brownlee brothers, both studied at the University of Leeds, and their legacy has left a lasting impact. In 2017, the uni opened the Brownlee Centre, the UK's first purpose-built triathlon training centre, situated next to the mile-long Bodington cycle circuit.\n\nIf you're a cycling fan, there is talk of the Tour de Yorkshire, which used to make an appearance in the city every year, being revived again in 2024. Or, alternatively, you could take part in the Leeds Half Marathon, taking place every May.\n\nIn Leeds, you're unlikely to run out of things to do."
