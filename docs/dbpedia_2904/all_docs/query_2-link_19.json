        "text": "At the University of Leeds, our world-leading research and education plays an essential part in plotting a path to a fairer and more sustainable future. But we need to do more.\n\nIn 2019 the University agreed seven principles to address the crisis, including setting an ambitious 2030 net zero greenhouse gas target. Even in the midst of a global pandemic, members from across the University have been establishing how we can take these principles off the page and transform them into a full, deliverable Climate Plan, one that is consistent with the values of our 10 year strategy.\n\nIn November 2021 the Climate Plan was approved by the Universityâs governing body, its Council. The plan represents the single biggest investment we have ever made: Â£174 million over the next decade, more than Â£150 million of which will be put towards achieving our goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.\n\nThe Climate Plan is a collaborative effort across the University community, involving our academic staff, professional services and students.\n\nIt maps out how we will deliver our key commitments, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, supporting a net zero city, delivering sustainable travel, enabling responsible investment, shaping institutional decision-making, and refocusing research and education.\n\nThe ambitious road laid out by our Climate Plan will be a challenging one. We have put systems in place that will regularly review our progress, to assess whether we need to correct or alter our course, and to identify opportunities to push our ambition further.\n\nAgility, ingenuity, new ways of working and collaboration across our entire community will be essential to accomplishing our plan.\n\nWe know our students and staff are anxious about the threat from climate change and about lack of progress in the world at large.\n\nOur Climate Plan is at the heart of the part we are playing to support climate change mitigation and adaptation, locally and globally, while also contributing to a healthier, greener and fairer place to live, work and study.\n\nOur net zero plan lays out an ambitious yet realistic pathway to reach the target of achieving an overall balance between greenhouse gas emissions we are producing and greenhouse gas emissions we are taking out of the atmosphere.\n\nOur plan makes minimal use of carbon offsetting, improves our resilience and is fully aligned with University values.\n\nIt also presents a preliminary ânet zero plusâ strategy to bring a wider set of emissions into scope, and to work towards our overall target of zero emissions by 2050.\n\nWe will be investing more than Â£150 million over the next decade (as well as a short-term increase to operating costs) in order to reach net zero emissions. The detailed phasing will be considered by Council in the New Year.\n\nOur carbon footprint\n\nThe University of Leeds is responsible for 174,415 tonnes of CO2 equivalent gas emissions. This figure represents our baseline carbon footprint. It is based on the latest 2019/20 data for our direct emissions and energy usage, and 2018/19 data for travel and supply chain, given the significant impact of COVID-19 on these emissions.\n\nOf these emissions, 71,546 tonnes â 41% â are from areas where we have direct control, including the energy generated and used for heating and powering our estate, and emissions from business travel and commuting.\n\nThese emissions are our core carbon footprint which is âin scopeâ for our net zero target, and we will work to bring further emissions into this target as and when we are able to.\n\nWe also have a responsibility to address emissions from sources where we have influence, but may not have direct control. These emissions relate primarily to our supply chain and partner organisations.\n\nOur pathway classifies these as ânet zero plusâ and action here focuses on accurately quantifying these emissions and identifying ways in which we can support and enable emissions reductions with a focus on high impact areas, such as construction, IT hardware, and food and catering.\n\nOur pathway to net zero\n\nSignificant time has been spent assessing the potential routes to delivering net zero emissions and the investment required. Our pathway has been rigorously peer reviewed by climate scientists and considers how we ensure resilience to climate change across our operations and support a just transition â making sure no one is left behind.\n\nIn line with the UK government strategy to decarbonise electricity generation by 2035, our pathway to net zero focuses on electrification. This allows us to be ambitious with our level of planned emissions reductions, while minimising risk.\n\nThe initial few years of the pathway necessarily focus on laying the groundwork for emissions reductions, through interventions including targeted refurbishment of buildings and the installation of low carbon technologies and solar PV across the estate.\n\nThe extensive works required to achieve this will allow us to achieve rapid decarbonisation rates post 2025.\n\nOur increased electricity consumption will be balanced by investment in a new off-site renewable energy facility.\n\nActive engagement and support across the University community will also be essential to support a reduction in energy demand through behaviour change across the estate.\n\nBusiness travel and commuting also forms an important part of our pathway to net zero.\n\nThe Climate Plan Sustainable Travel working group will be reviewing travel reduction initiatives alongside wider University strategic priorities, including defining climate-conscious travel and ways to achieve it while recognising that business travel is sometimes a necessity.\n\nWe will invest in supporting the switch to electric vehicles both within our own fleet and for staff, alongside improving active travel infrastructure.\n\nBalancing remaining emissions\n\nThe focus is on reducing emissions as far as practicably possible. Our capital investment of more than Â£150 million over the next decade reduces the emissions within our core carbon footprint by 67.2%, to 23,444 tonnes CO2 equivalent by 2030.\n\nThroughout the implementation of the plan, we will look to reduce residual emissions further.\n\nWhere it is not possible to reduce specific emissions, we will offset those in line with the guidance of the COP26 Universities Network Offsetting briefing.\n\nWe will prioritise offsetting activities on University land or local projects, such as the woodland we are designing on 90 acres of land at King Lane.\n\nAn annual review cycle, involving the Priestley International Centre for Climate, will ensure we are minimising our reliance on offsets, and help us choose high quality, academically-verified offsets where they are required.\n\nOur approach to net zero plus\n\nNet zero plus covers 59% of our total emissions. While there is potential for significant impact in addressing these emissions, our influence is much lower and is reliant on other suppliers and partners.\n\nWe will be sure our suppliers know about our 2030 net zero goal and will ask them to join us on this journey. Within the first two years of our pathway we will review when net zero terms and conditions can be added to future contracts.\n\nVehicle use is a significant contributor to the emissions of service companies based at the University, for example maintenance and grounds keeping vehicles that need to come onto campus. We will work with suppliers to reduce these emissions.\n\nWe have identified three further high impact areas that will receive particular focus: construction, IT hardware, and food and catering.\n\nAchieving these wider emissions reductions will require true collaboration with research, education and operations to explore interventions that are measurable and deliverable. But we have no doubt our community will rise to the challenge.\n\nNet zero by 2030 â ambitious, realistic and achievable\n\nOur net zero pathway is ambitious yet achievable, and tailored for rapid deployment of meaningful mitigation and adaptation measures.\n\nWe will be agile and embrace new approaches, including through our living laboratories, which will contribute to the development of credible solutions for all sectors of the economy.\n\nFor example, the University research farm will serve as an important living lab where staff and students can work with agribusinesses to trial alternative, scalable solutions that are needed regionally, nationally and globally.\n\nWe will be transparent in our approach to delivering a resilient net zero, and share our successes, failures and learnings.\n\nProgress will be reported on an annual basis, but we will also track emissions on a quarterly basis allowing us to respond with more agility to any emerging problems. An external review of our net zero delivery will be carried out every three years to ensure our actions and progress continue to lead the sector.\n\nOur net zero plan sits alongside plans for the remaining six climate principles and will continually look to the future to ensure that we maintain a trajectory towards zero direct emissions by 2050.\n\nWe recognise the urgent need to change the way we travel.\n\nThe Climate Planâs central pillar of net zero emissions by 2030 highlights the importance of tackling travel emissions, and business travel and commuting emissions are a significant part of our core carbon footprint.\n\nThe net zero plan includes details regarding calculating the carbon footprint of our travel and some of our planned interventions.\n\nWe will reduce the impact of business and commuting travel with the aim to achieve and maintain emissions at 50% of 2018-19 levels, while balancing our commitment to academic excellence.\n\nThe timelines to achieve this target will be led by the outcomes of consultation with the whole University community.\n\nIn the first year, we will run a participatory process with stakeholders to inform policy change. We will then deliver interventions with a phased approach, balancing the critical need to reduce emissions with our commitment to academic excellence.\n\nWe will trial a number of approaches to meet the emissions reduction target, such as tighter pre-travel approval and encouraging low carbon over low cost travel.\n\nIn line with our commitment to supporting Leeds as a net zero city, we will continue to work with the city to improve sustainable travel infrastructure.\n\nFor both business and commuting travel, we will leverage the opportunities provided by future ways of working and Digital Transformation. Our digital transformation strategy will support high quality digital collaboration, helping to minimise travel and providing the option of online-only degrees.\n\nTo address our business travel practices, we will introduce changes to encourage everyone to travel less, and travel greener when we do, while reviewing options to offset emissions. For example, setting limits of the type of cars available for hire, aiming for electric vehicles only by the mid-2020s.\n\nWith commuting, we will encourage additional investment in sustainable and active travel infrastructure with plans to increase electric car charging points, incentivise the switch to electric vehicles, increase shower provision on campus and improving the affordability of electric bikes.\n\nWithin Leeds, we will use our role as an anchor organisation to leverage wider transport improvements in the city such as walking and cycling links to the University.\n\nThis process will require some external support, with input from academic and operational colleagues, co-ordinated by teams from Business Change and Sustainability."
