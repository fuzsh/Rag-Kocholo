        "text": "DIRECT Line Group is axing 800 of its UK staff in a move that will see it lose 7 per cent of its 11,000-strong workforce.\n\nThe insurer has decided to close its Ipswich office, while the size of its Manchester and Bromley branches are being shrunk.\n\nThis will see around 300 people in Ipswich (Princes Street) lose their jobs, with the office expected to close in 2022.\n\nIn Manchester (Quay Street), around 420 people will see their roles made redundant or relocated to branches in Bristol, Doncaster, Glasgow or Leeds. This will take place in the first half of 2021.\n\nWhile in Bromley, around 72 roles are being made redundant as teams are being restructured from May this year.\n\nThe insurer's head office is in Bromley in South London, while it currently has 13 regional offices in England and one in Scotland.\n\nIt has confirmed the cuts are being made across different roles and parts of the business, and blames customers increasingly taking out policies and contacting customer services online for the losses.\n\nBut it points out that the overall number of losses across the three sites could be lower if people apply for new roles within the business.\n\nDLG claims to be the UK's largest motor insurance provider with 4.1million policies in force under its Direct Line, Churchill, and Privilege brands, as well as through its partners.\n\nIt has 2.6million home insurance policies in place, and is one of the UK's biggest travel and pet insurance providers.\n\nDirect Line is also behind breakdown cover provider Green Flag.\n\nA DLG spokesperson said: “Like many companies we are having to prepare for changes in the way we operate reflecting changing customer behaviour where people are increasingly opting to interact with us digitally.\n\n\"We are therefore proposing a number of changes across the business which sadly mean the loss of jobs for some of our people.\n\n“These decisions are always really difficult, we take the wellbeing of our people very seriously and have given people as much time as possible to prepare.\n\n\"We will be working with our employee representative body to make sure people are well supported through the process including helping them to find alternative employment by working with local organisations and providing CV and interview training.”\n\nIt's a challenging time for major UK employers with Ted Baker revealing today that it's cut 160 jobs.\n\nWhile only this week Tesco revealed it's scrapping 1,800 jobs as it plans to cut back on in-store bakeries."
