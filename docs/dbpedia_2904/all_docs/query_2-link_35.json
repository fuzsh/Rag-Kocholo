        "text": "In the five years since the first National Infrastructure Assessment, government has worked to increase the share of electricity generated by renewables, set up the UK Infrastructure Bank, devolve transport funding to major city regions, and provide industry with the direction to rapidly build gigabit capable broadband networks.\n\nBut there is more to be done to address significant deficiencies in the UK’s economic infrastructure and ensure it can meet the challenges ahead. For the first time, households face changes to reduce emissions, get off gas and oil and ensure energy security. Not only will households switch to electric vehicles, but they will need to swap their gas boilers for cleaner, more efficient heat pumps. While these technologies should roughly halve energy costs for households in the coming decades, the transition must be carefully managed to ensure the public are supported with the upfront costs and government protects the living standards of those least able to pay.\n\nThere would be significant benefits from improving connectivity. For transport networks, investment is required to facilitate sustainable trips within and between English cities. For digital networks, government should secure nationwide coverage of gigabit broadband and 5G services, and ensure the specific telecoms needs of infrastructure services are met. Increasing the quality of transport and digital networks will be necessary, although not sufficient, to reduce long standing disparities in economic outcomes and quality of life.\n\nAt the same time, all infrastructure systems should be more resilient and protect the environment. The UK’s infrastructure has proved fairly resilient over recent decades, but faces increasing exposure to shocks, including from the environment. Better maintenance and renewal of the existing asset base will be essential, as will building new infrastructure to protect households and businesses from flooding and drought.\n\nDelivering low carbon and resilient infrastructure will require a significant increase in overall investment. The costs as well as the benefits of transforming the UK’s infrastructure will be borne by the public as taxpayers and billpayers. But making these investments will help lower costs for households and keep them lower in the longer term. These upfront investments will be paid for by consumers in their bills over the coming decades, not all at once.\n\nWhile upgrading the country’s infrastructure is a major task, it is achievable, provided government makes decisions and commits to them for the long term, removes barriers to progress and supports people through the transition in a way that is both affordable and fair. This Assessment sets out recommendations to help government do so.\n\nThe core recommendations the Commission is making to government include:\n\nadding low carbon, flexible technologies to the electricity system to ensure supply remains reliable, and creating a new strategic energy reserve to boost Great Britain’s economic security\n\ntaking a clear decision that electrification is the only viable option for decarbonising buildings at scale, getting the UK back on track to meet its climate targets and lowering energy bills by fully covering the costs of installing a heat pump for lower income households and offering £7,000 support to all others\n\ninvesting in public transport upgrades in England’s largest regional cities to unlock economic growth, improving underperforming parts of the national road network and developing a new comprehensive and long term rail plan which will bring productivity benefits to city regions across the North and the Midlands\n\nensuring gigabit capable broadband is available nationwide by 2030 and supporting the market to roll out new 5G services\n\npreparing for a drier future by putting plans in place to deliver additional water supply infrastructure and reduce leakage, while also reducing water demand\n\nsetting long term measurable targets and ensuring funded plans are in place to significantly reduce the number of properties that are at risk of flooding by 2055\n\ndelivering a more sustainable waste system by urgently implementing reforms to meet the 65 per cent recycling target by 2035, and creating stronger incentives for investment in the recycling infrastructure that will be needed in the future.\n\nThe National Infrastructure Assessment\n\nThe Commission is required to carry out an overall assessment of the UK’s infrastructure requirements once every five years. The first Assessment was published in 2018 and has shaped many aspects of infrastructure policy, including the establishment of the UK Infrastructure Bank, increased support for renewables, committing to transition to electric vehicles, devolved budgets for local transport, deployment of gigabit capable broadband networks, and the long term direction for water resources policy.\n\nThis is the second Assessment. It covers all economic infrastructure sectors, setting out recommendations for transport, energy, water and wastewater, flood resilience, digital connectivity, and solid waste. The Assessment takes a 30 year view of the infrastructure needs within UK government competence and identifies the policies and funding to meet them.\n\nThe Assessment is guided by the Commission’s objectives to support sustainable economic growth across all regions of the UK, improve competitiveness, improve quality of life, support climate resilience and transition to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Government has given the Commission a long term funding envelope for its recommendations (the ‘fiscal remit’). Where infrastructure is financed by the private sector, and the costs of any recommendations will ultimately be met by consumers, the Commission is also required to provide a transparent assessment of the overall impact on household costs (the ‘economic remit’).\n\nThe challenges ahead\n\nWhile infrastructure performs well in some areas, in others there are significant deficiencies that are holding the UK back. There has been under investment in transport systems in regional English cities, no major water resource reservoirs have been built in England in the last 30 years, too many properties are at risk of flooding, and recycling rates have not increased in a decade. This situation must improve.\n\nInfrastructure is pivotal to addressing some of the biggest strategic challenges facing the UK, namely decarbonising the economy, boosting economic growth, and improving resilience and the environment. Proactively tackling these challenges provides an opportunity to bring major benefits to the UK. Government, regulators and industry must act urgently, with policies of sufficient scale to move the dial and enable rapid delivery on the ground. Doing so will require significant investment in economic infrastructure and the transition should be affordable and fair. This is a big task. But it is achievable. The UK has made major changes to infrastructure before — from building the electricity ‘supergrid’ in the 1950s to constructing the strategic road network in the 1960s and 70s — and can do so again.\n\nEnergy and net zero\n\nPhasing out the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity, heat homes and power vehicles will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and is essential for the UK to meet its legally binding climate targets. Action is now urgent with only 12 years left to meet the Sixth Carbon Budget. This shift will also bring significant economic benefits. Shocks to oil and gas prices will have a much smaller impact on the cost of living. If the UK can move fast, some businesses should be able to become leaders in new low carbon technologies. And, in the longer term, electrifying the energy system should lower energy costs for households and businesses, boosting productivity.\n\nSupporting growth across regions\n\nThe UK must address its persistent slow economic growth and entrenched regional inequalities. Since the mid 2000s, UK productivity has fallen further behind comparator countries such as France, Germany, and the United States. In addition, the UK has long standing and self reinforcing variations in economic outcomes between and within regions. One of the reasons for this poor economic performance in recent years is low levels of investment in the UK economy compared to international peers: in the 40 years to 2019, investment in the UK averaged around 19 per cent of GDP, the lowest in the G7.\n\nBetter transport and digital networks can support economic growth in both high performing and underperforming places. Investment in transport networks can enable sustainable trips within and between cities — the main engines of economic growth. Better connections can boost productivity in cities through increasing access to high skilled labour, attracting new investment and firms, and capitalising on agglomeration benefits. Better connections between cities facilitates more efficient trade in goods and services. And delivering nationwide coverage of gigabit broadband and new 5G services can stimulate innovation and help to improve productivity in some sectors.\n\nImproving resilience and the environment\n\nIt is important that infrastructure is both resilient to external events and protects the natural environment. Resilience shocks are infrequent and future benefits uncertain but the cost of intervention is concrete and immediate. Therefore, both the public and private sector are likely to under invest in resilience unless government acts to set expectations through service standards and ensures resilience is properly valued. Meanwhile, biodiversity is at risk and the stock of natural capital is in decline. With appropriate intervention, infrastructure can help solve, rather than exacerbate, this challenge.\n\nThis Assessment sets out recommendations to meet these strategic challenges and make the most of the opportunities they present. The Commission has used five policy principles to guide its recommendations:\n\nRemoving barriers and accelerating decisions: Currently there are too many barriers that slow down infrastructure decision making and delivery. These make the UK a less attractive place to invest. Policy must change to facilitate faster progress.\n\nTaking long term decisions and demonstrating staying power: Repeatedly changing policy creates uncertainty for infrastructure operators and investors, which deters investment. It also slows the development of supply chains, driving up costs.\n\nPace, not perfection: Ambitious goals must be backed up by bold policies and effective implementation. To make the rapid progress required, options must be closed down where the risk of delay is greater than the risk of making a suboptimal decision.\n\nFurthering devolution: Decisions made at the local level are better able to reflect local preferences, circumstances, and information. Implementation is often most effective when undertaken at the local level. As such, when done well, devolution is associated with productivity benefits and reduced regional differences. Historically, the UK has struck the wrong balance between risk sharing nationally and local autonomy on spending and taxation.\n\nAdaptive planning: There is inevitable uncertainty associated with long term infrastructure policy making. Decision makers must not be continually buffeted by this uncertainty, nor ignore it. In this Assessment, the Commission sets out a portfolio of policies that use adaptive pathways to effectively navigate uncertainty.\n\nHowever, better policy alone is not enough to create low carbon, connected and resilient infrastructure. The Commission’s recommendations must be accompanied by effective implementation to rapidly deliver projects on the ground. This is the only way in which high quality infrastructure services — from effective, reliable and accessible transport to safe and secure energy — will be provided to people across the country, enhancing living standards for decades to come.\n\nEnergy and net zero\n\nTo tackle climate change and ensure energy security, the UK should move away from its reliance on fossil fuels. Currently around 80 per cent of the energy demand is met by fossil fuels, primarily from fossil fuel based electricity generation, natural gas boilers for heating homes and businesses, petrol and diesel cars and vans, and fossil fuels powering industry.\n\nThe solution is to replace these fossil fuels with low cost, reliable, low carbon electricity. This will require a fundamental change in the country’s energy infrastructure. Over the next 30 years the country will need:\n\na larger electricity system running mostly from renewable power sources like wind and solar\n\nheat pumps and networks to replace gas boilers in homes and businesses\n\ncars and vans fuelled by clean electricity and charging infrastructure to replace petrol stations\n\nindustry running on electricity where possible, but, where it is not, new infrastructure to supply clean hydrogen, or capture and transport the carbon emitted from burning fossil fuels to underground stores.\n\nMoving to an electrified energy system should create cheaper, less price volatile energy in the long term. An energy system running on electricity, rather than fossil fuels, is more capital intensive and so insulated from fuel price changes. This should lower costs for households and businesses and provide more certainty over future prices. However, there will be significant upfront costs from creating the new capital assets needed and government should provide support during the transition, especially to households on lower incomes.\n\nThere have already been major steps forward. In 2022, electricity generation produced 75 per cent less emissions than it did in 1990 as renewables replaced fossil fuel powered generation. The share of new car sales that are battery electric has increased from less than one per cent in 2015 to around 16 per cent in 2022.\n\nWhile there is still a long way to go in creating a secure net zero energy system, it is achievable with the right policies and a relentless focus on delivery. The UK has transformed its energy system many times before. In the 1960s and 1970s, all properties connected to the gas network were converted from town gas to natural gas in just ten years. In the 1990s ‘dash for gas’, the UK built almost 40 gas power stations, and more recently since 2010 the UK has deployed over 13 GW of offshore wind and now has the second largest offshore wind fleet in the world.\n\nBuilding a secure, low carbon electricity system\n\nBy 2035, the UK needs a reliable electricity system running mostly on renewable power. Government should accelerate the deployment of offshore wind, onshore wind and solar power. These technologies should be complemented by more flexible technologies that can generate if the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing. Government should support the market to deploy electricity storage and demand side response (tools and incentives to reduce or reschedule energy usage at times of peak demand). At the same time, it’s critical that government establishes effective business models that incentivise investment in large scale hydrogen and gas with carbon capture and storage power stations that can provide electricity even during extended calm or cloudy periods. More demand for electricity means more transmission and distribution cables are required. Investment in electricity networks has not kept up with demand and therefore connections to the network are being delayed. The scale and speed of infrastructure deployment requires transformational change to planning, regulation and governance of both the transmission and distribution networks.\n\nThe electricity system will become even more important as the rest of the economy electrifies and so needs to be underpinned by a new strategic energy reserve. The energy system has proven to be vulnerable to price shocks such as that caused by Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine. Part of the reason it was so exposed was because it did not have adequate gas reserves that could be used to mitigate the impact of the shock. Government should establish a reserve of energy that can be released into the market to generate electricity in order to mitigate the effect of price shocks in the future.\n\nSwitching to electrified heat\n\nGas boilers, which currently heat around 88 per cent of English buildings, need to be phased out and replaced by heat pumps. Around eight million additional buildings will need to switch to low carbon heating by 2035, and all buildings by 2050. Heat pumps and heat networks are the solution. They are highly efficient, available now and being deployed rapidly in other countries. The Commission’s analysis demonstrates that there is no public policy case for hydrogen to be used to heat individual buildings. It should be ruled out as an option to enable an exclusive focus on switching to electrified heat.\n\nKick starting the market for heat pumps and heat networks will require urgent action and implementation from government, including a number of one off investments:\n\ncommitting £1.5 to £4.5 billion per year to improve energy efficiency and install heat pumps across the public sector estate and social housing that will help boost supply chains\n\nclosing the gap with the lifetime cost of gas boilers by providing an initial upfront subsidy of £7,000 to households installing heat pumps or connecting to heat networks, alongside access to zero per cent financing, backed by government, for the additional cost\n\ncommitting £1 to £4 billion per year to cover the full cost of heat pump installations and support energy efficiency improvements for households on lower incomes that will be unlikely to be able to fund the costs themselves\n\ntaking policy costs off electricity bills and ensuring the cost of running a heat pump is lower than the cost of running a gas boiler.\n\nEffective delivery will be supported by setting devolved long term budgets for local authorities for decarbonising the homes and buildings they are responsible for. Collaboration between energy suppliers and local authorities will also ensure energy efficiency improvements are targeted at those most in need.\n\nRolling out electric vehicles\n\nIncreasing the adoption of electric vehicles will be key to decarbonising surface transport. Electric cars and vans are the future of road transport. As well as being zero emission, they are cheaper to run and create less air pollution.\n\nBut consumers will only purchase electric vehicles if they are confident they can charge them when they need to. Government should ensure there is a nationwide network of public charge points, reaching at least 300,000 chargers across the UK by 2030. These charge points must be spread across all regions of the country to support every consumer to make the switch.\n\nNew networks to support industry\n\nGovernment has set stretching industrial decarbonisation targets. A comprehensive strategy is required to meet those targets and ensure the UK protects its industrial activity as buyers increasingly demand low carbon products. Decarbonising the industrial sector requires switching from fossil fuels to a mix of electricity, hydrogen and fossil fuels abated with carbon capture and storage. Industry needs clarity from government on which decarbonisation routes will be open to them and certainty on where supporting infrastructure will be available and by when.\n\nCore networks of infrastructure to transmit and store hydrogen and carbon are essential by 2035. They will support industrial decarbonisation and provide the fuel needed to generate low carbon electricity. This carbon capture and storage system should have capacity to store at least 50MtCO2e per year by 2035 and the core sites should cover Grangemouth and North East Scotland, Teesside, Humberside, Merseyside, the Peak District and Southampton. Similarly, the core hydrogen transmission network should connect Grangemouth and North East Scotland, Teesside, Humberside, Merseyside and South Wales.\n\nSupporting growth across regions\n\nBetter transport and digital networks can support economic growth across regions. Cities are the main drivers of economic growth — they have the highest employment density and largest concentrations of productive businesses. But large regional English cities are less productive than comparable European cities, partly because they have worse public transport networks. Investing in transport infrastructure can help support movement within cities and enable more efficient trade of goods and services between them, in turn helping to increase productivity. Better transport networks also improve quality of life and raise living standards, by making it easier to access public services, retail, and leisure activities. There should not be a choice between improving local and inter city transport – the UK should do both if it wants to ease constraints on growth.\n\nTravel demand patterns have changed, to some degree, following the Covid-19 pandemic, which increased the frequency of home and hybrid working. But this has not weakened the case for long term investment. The largest cities are likely to require more capacity on their public transport networks to support economic growth over the next 20 to 30 years, and that is true even if home and hybrid working remain above pre pandemic levels.\n\nBetter digital connectivity can also boost economic growth. Improving digital connectivity can lower costs for firms, enable technological changes and innovation, and provide businesses with access to a wider pool of talent for recruitment.\n\nIn both the transport and digital sectors, there are clear actions for government to take:\n\ninvesting in the maintenance and renewal of existing transport infrastructure on both a national and local level, and planning for the effects of climate change\n\nenabling investment in new and improved transport networks to facilitate sustainable trips within and between cities\n\ndelivering nationwide coverage of gigabit broadband and new 5G services to stimulate innovation and improve productivity in some sectors.\n\nGetting cities moving\n\nEngland’s largest cities have congested roads and inadequate public transport networks, which constrains their economic growth. The solution is better public transport, and more, safer, active travel. Public transport is much more space efficient than cars — a bus lane can carry around twice as many passengers per hour as a normal lane.\n\nGovernment should invest £22 billion to improve public transport in the largest regional English cities to unlock economic growth. Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds and Manchester are important economic hubs within their wider regions but face the biggest transport capacity constraints. They should be the initial priorities for investment in mass transit systems. As cities will be the primary beneficiaries of better public transport, they should contribute to the costs. Cities should have the autonomy to fund as well as find local infrastructure solutions.\n\nHowever, investment in public transport alone will not be sufficient to reduce congestion and improve capacity. Cities will also need to reduce car journeys into congested city centres, especially at peak times. Measures such as congestion charging and workplace parking levies can reduce car use, thereby freeing up room on the roads for more public transport. The sequencing of these transport changes will be important as reducing trips by car where there is no viable public transport alternative risks hindering, not supporting, growth and having negative social impacts.\n\nMore devolution and bigger local transport budgets are essential for better maintenance and continued transport enhancements across the country. This will give local authorities the freedom to identify local priorities, such as fixing potholes, zero emission buses and road improvements, and the resources to address them. Government should move away from centrally allocated funding pots for transport and, instead, implement flexible, long term, devolved budgets for all local authorities that are responsible for strategic transport. Government has made progress with the City Region Sustainable Transport Settlements and the recent ‘trailblazer’ deals for Greater Manchester and the West Midlands. The City Region Sustainable Transport Settlements model should now be extended beyond the Mayoral Combined Authorities, and the ‘trailblazer’ deals rolled out to all Mayoral Combined Authorities. London also requires a long term funding settlement to enhance its world class public transport network. Short term funding deals for Transport for London should be replaced with longer term capital settlements, sufficient to enable the enhancement and expansion of London’s transport services to support housing and economic growth.\n\nImproving national road and rail networks\n\nNational road and rail networks are essential for connecting places, and so they must be well maintained. This will likely be more expensive in the future due to climate change, ageing assets and increased demand. Maintenance of existing national road and rail networks should be prioritised.\n\nGovernment had developed a long term plan to improve rail performance between cities in the North and the Midlands. The High Speed 2 line between London and Manchester via Birmingham, alongside Northern Powerhouse Rail and other changes, would have significantly improved north-south and east-west rail connectivity. This investment would also have freed up capacity on the existing rail network, enabling more local and regional services to run and providing significant increases to city centre accessibility.\n\nThe second Assessment has been undertaken on the basis of the delivery of this long term rail plan. On 4th October, government announced that High Speed 2 from Birmingham to Manchester will not go ahead and set out a new package of transport schemes. This decision leaves a major gap in the UK’s rail strategy around which a number of cities have based their economic growth plans. While government has committed to reallocate the funding from cancelling the later phases of High Speed 2 to improve transport, including rail links, in the North and Midlands, it is not yet clear what the exact scope and delivery schedule is for the proposed new rail schemes. A new comprehensive, long term and fully costed plan that sets out how rail improvements will address the capacity and connectivity challenges facing city regions in the North and Midlands is needed. The Commission could support government in undertaking this work.\n\nAlongside this, government should take forward a programme of enhancements to the road network that target underperforming sections, provide better connections between cities and facilitate trade in goods and services. It is not clear that this prioritisation happens at present – in the allocation of funding for the second Road Investment Strategy, only 22 per cent of funding allocated was in the North and the Midlands. Government should plan these enhancements on a strategic basis, aligning schemes with complementary policies that support economic growth. This should be underpinned by a national integrated strategy for interurban transport, including a pipeline of strategic improvements to the road and rail networks over the next 30 years.\n\nEnhancing digital connectivity\n\nCoverage of gigabit capable connectivity has improved in recent years. To ensure the UK meets the target of nationwide coverage by 2030, policy and regulation must continue to support private investment in networks and competition. Government should also finish delivering the £5 billion subsidy programme to provide coverage in the hardest to reach areas.\n\nAs the UK is still at a relatively early stage in 5G deployment, government should support a market led approach by improving the consistency of planning approvals across the country and supporting access to spectrum for localised private networks. Government should also be prepared to act fast to support deployment in uncommercial areas, should essential 5G use cases emerge. Better digital connectivity will also be vital to delivering critical functionality and strategic objectives across other infrastructure sectors. Between now and the end of 2026, government should set out plans for how the telecommunication needs of the energy, water and transport sectors will be met, including ensuring adequate access to spectrum.\n\nImproving resilience and the environment\n\nThe UK’s infrastructure has proved fairly resilient over recent decades, but faces increasing exposure to shocks, including from the environment.\n\nInfrastructure resilience must be taken seriously across all sectors. As the impacts of climate change increase, flood risk management infrastructure will be needed to prepare for floods, and increased water supply and water demand management will be needed to prepare for droughts.\n\nBut infrastructure systems should not just be resilient to the environment, they should also support improvements in it. Infrastructure has in the past been partly responsible for negative environmental impacts. In the future infrastructure can, instead, contribute to a healthier natural environment by, for example, increasing recycling and reducing waste, using nature based solutions for drainage and wastewater treatment and taking a strategic approach to biodiversity net gain.\n\nImproving asset management and climate resilience\n\nMost infrastructure assets that will be operating in 2055 have already been built. Better asset maintenance and renewal is therefore critical to achieving more resilient infrastructure. To achieve this, government should publish outcome based resilience standards for infrastructure sectors by 2025 to inform future regulatory and funding settlements. Government should also require infrastructure operators to set out the costs of meeting these standards, and work with the Met Office and standards bodies to enhance the tools available to assess this.\n\nThe UK will also need new assets to adapt to a changing climate. Currently 900,000 properties have a greater than one per cent annual risk of flooding from rivers and the sea. For surface water flooding the figure is 910,000. Government should invest in enhanced flood risk management infrastructure to reduce the risk of coastal, river and surface water flooding, with clear risk reduction targets and, in the case of surface water, improved data gathering and coordinated governance at a local level.\n\nWithout action, there will also be an over 4,000 mega litre per day gap between the demand and supply of water by 2050. Government should follow a twin track approach to drought resilience, by managing demand and increasing supply. Both reducing demand, including leakage, and providing new water infrastructure will require additional investment in the upcoming sector Price Review 2024 and beyond.\n\nImproving the environment\n\nAlongside improving resilience, infrastructure services should reduce their impact on the environment and leave the natural world in a better condition. This means reducing the impact of wastewater on water bodies and encouraging a more circular economy in waste disposal. Government should implement without delay its planned packaging reforms. It should also widen its restriction on plastic packaging and set individual targets, with transition funding, for local authorities, to help achieve its target recycling rate of 65 per cent by 2035. Finally, government should set stronger incentives for recycling investment and phase out the use of unabated energy from waste processing.\n\nGovernment should build on its commitment to biodiversity net gain by requiring sectors with the greatest opportunity — transport, water and flood risk management — to take a strategic approach to enhancing natural capital across their estate.\n\nInvesting for the future\n\nThe Commission’s recommendations require an ambitious and sustained programme of policy change with clear direction. Realising the benefits will require a significant increase in overall investment in economic infrastructure. These investments are vital to the challenges ahead. Making them now should lead to lower overall costs for households and businesses for the long term.\n\nThe Commission’s analysis suggests that overall investment must increase from an average of around £55 billion per year over the last decade (around ten per cent of UK investment) to around £70 to 80 billion per year in the 2030s and £60 to £70 billion per year in the 2040s. Public sector investment will need to rise from £20 billion per year over the last decade to around £30 billion in the 2030s and 40s. At the latest spending review, government committed to increase this to around £30 billion for the years 2022-23 to 2024-35. This is a sharp rise, and government should ensure that it does get spent. In recent years one in every six pounds of planned capital expenditure has gone unspent. Private sector investment will need to increase from around £30 to 40 billion over the last decade to £40 to £50 billion in the 2030s and 2040s. The main areas for investment are:\n\nto reach net zero, around £20 to £35 billion per year between 2025 and 2050 of private sector investment in renewable generation capacity and flexible sources of generation, electricity networks, and hydrogen generation, storage and networks and a carbon capture and storage network\n\nto support growth across regions, investments including better public transport in cities and improved national road and rail connections, will total around £28 billion per year from the public sector — the balance of this investment will shift towards urban transport, increasing from around 40 per cent today to 50 per cent in the 2040s, reflecting the economic growth potential of cities\n\nto improve resilience and the environment, investments will total £1 to £1.5 billion per year from the public sector and £8 to £12 billion per year from the private sector over the next 30 years.\n\nIn addition, the Commission is recommending that government supports households through the energy transition to ensure it is both affordable and fair. The Commission’s recommendations involve government investing £3 to 12 billion per year to support households to decarbonise their heating systems over the next 15 years. Public support will have to be complemented by household investment of a similar size (Figure 1). Critically, these costs will not be borne up front by households as the Commission is also recommending government backed zero per cent financing is put in place so this cost is spread over time.\n\nFigure 1: Both public and private investment will stay higher than in recent years\n\nPublic and private investment in economic infrastructure from 2013 to 2055\n\nSource: Commission analysis.\n\nNote: Dotted lines cover the period between latest outturn data for 2021 and the start of Commission forecasts in 2025, based on a straight line interpolation.\n\nNote: Profile of public infrastructure investment includes the sections of HS2 that will not now go ahead\n\nThe Commission recognises the context in which it makes the case for increased investment, which is ultimately funded by households and businesses — either through taxation, bills, or the price of products purchased. Since 2019, households have faced a series of adverse shocks, most recently on cost of living. A significant proportion of the population are in fuel poverty.\n\nBut making these investments will help lower costs for households and keep them low in the longer term. These upfront investments will be paid by consumers in their bills over the coming decades, not all at once.\n\nIn total, overall household spending on infrastructure should fall from today’s £7,300 per household to around £5,500 to £6,600 by the mid 2030s. For the next few years, energy costs will largely be driven by the volatile and difficult to predict gas price. But beyond that, the key driver of lower household costs is transitioning away from fossil fuels and onto cheaper, reliable low carbon electricity. A fossil fuel based system has high operating costs. Natural gas, coal, or oil must be continually purchased and burned to generate electricity. A system running on renewables, heat pumps and electric cars will have high upfront costs that are paid for slowly over time but it is cheaper to run. Offshore wind, onshore wind and solar farms have low operating costs as they require no fuel inputs. Heat pumps and electric vehicles are much more efficient than gas boilers and petrol or diesel cars. The cheaper operating costs of a low carbon energy system more than offset the costs of paying for the new infrastructure, leading to lower household costs.\n\nThis reduction in energy costs should be much greater than the upward pressure on bills from increased investment required in the water sector to reduce both pollution and drought risk.\n\nFigure 2: Overall household spending on infrastructure should fall by at least £1,000 from today’s high levels\n\nHousehold spending on infrastructure 2019 to 2055\n\nSource: Commission analysis\n\nCritically, it is not only the average household cost impact that is important, but also the impact on lower income households. The Commission has sought to ensure its recommendations in this Assessment, if carefully implemented, will not have a disproportionate impact on such households, by undertaking distributional analysis, engaging with experts, and commissioning social research.\n\nMaking good decisions, fast\n\nThe majority of the investment needed will come from private capital. Securing this wave of private sector investment will require better policy and decision making. There is private finance available but, to secure it, the UK must be able to attract investors based on the strength of its policy and regulatory environment and the returns available from projects.\n\nGovernment must be able to make good decisions, fast. There need to be changes to planning, predictable regulatory models that allow rates of return commensurate with the level of risk, better strategic policy direction from government, increased use of competition and good infrastructure design. All this can help secure private investment, although changes to public investment decisions are also essential.\n\nAn effective planning system that enables good decisions to be made swiftly is essential for attracting investment. While the Nationally Significant Infrastructure Planning framework initially worked well, it has deteriorated in recent years — consenting timelines have slowed by 65 per cent. Government has taken some positive steps towards reform, but more is needed, including: updates to National Policy Statements at least every five years, better use of environmental data, a meaningful and consistent approach to community benefits, integrated spatial planning, and more robust oversight and accountability at the centre of government.\n\nThe UK’s system of economic regulation needs to be updated to enable the transformational change required to tackle net zero and climate resilience. It is critical that regulation maintains the confidence of both the public and the private sector. To do this, regulators must ensure that the private companies they regulate are financially sustainable. This includes considering appropriate gearing ratios and linking returns to both risk and performance. Greater consistency is required across price regulated regimes, including in how the allowed cost of capital is set.\n\nFurther action is also needed to support investment, including:\n\nStrategic direction from government to regulators through regular Strategic Policy Statements for each sector. These statements should set out a coherent long term vision for sectors aligned with government’s policy priorities. At a time when the water and energy sectors need transformational change, not just marginal efficiency improvements, regular Strategic Policy Statements are essential for giving regulators clarity to prioritise investment, especially when it is required ahead of need.\n\nEnhanced use of competition, where appropriate. Investment aimed at addressing strategic challenges will be made in the context of high levels of uncertainty and rapid technological change. One way to capitalise on this opportunity for innovation is through an increased role for competition. Removing some major strategic investments from the price controls and opening them to competition will both boost innovation and give infrastructure providers confidence to deliver long term projects within a stable regulatory environment. However, competition will not be appropriate in all circumstances. In some cases, introducing competition could slow delivery in the short term or hinder the coordinated delivery of networks.\n\nNew business models are needed to support deployment of hydrogen and carbon capture and storage networks, and new forms of flexible electricity generation. These business models must provide investors with clarity and certainty, alongside an appropriate rate of return and replicate the success of the contracts for difference model for renewable electricity generation.\n\nGood infrastructure design provides value for people, places, and the climate while also helping projects finish on time and at lower cost. Embedding this process into the culture of delivery from the outset of projects can improve aesthetics, drive wide community engagement and maximise the benefits of the project.\n\nHaving visible and long term pipelines of investment opportunities will be necessary for the market to invest in the skills and supply chains essential to deliver the required infrastructure on time and to budget.\n\nEffective policy and decision making are not just essential to support private sector investment, they are also critical for public sector investment too. Major infrastructure projects should be given separate budgets for their lifetime. The largest projects should be given their own ‘departmental style’ settlements with explicit contingency budgets to ensure that cost or time overruns don’t prevent other smaller projects from being taken forward. Finally, government should account for maintenance and renewals spending separately to enhancements so that it does not get deprioritised.\n\nThere is no time to lose\n\nDelivering the Commission’s package of recommendations will ensure the UK has low carbon and resilient infrastructure for the coming decades, which can support economic growth across regions and protect the natural environment.\n\nBut the UK must act fast. This Assessment sets out the steps government should take to capitalise on the areas where the UK has already made good progress, and to catch up in those areas where it risks falling behind.\n\nWhile meeting the UK’s economic infrastructure needs will incur significant, if manageable, costs, the costs of inaction would almost certainly be greater. The UK has been here before: the inadequacies of infrastructure today reflect past failures to act and invest for the long term. Policies have too often been delayed where the benefits of acting earlier would have outweighed the initial costs. Rather than repeating this mistake, government must act now to secure infrastructure that is fit for the future. Implementing the Commission’s ambitious set of recommendations will require bold decisions, long term thinking, and support for households during the transition. The transformation of the UK’s infrastructure will require determined political leadership at both national and local level. It will also demand close collaboration between government, regulators and industry.\n\nThe good news is that significant benefits can be realised for households, businesses and communities across the UK — and crucially, they can be achieved in a way that is affordable and fair.\n\nWhile economic infrastructure performs well in some areas, in others there are significant deficiencies that are holding the UK back. These include under investment in transport systems in regional English cities, not building any major water supply reservoirs in England in the last 30 years, leaving too many properties at risk of flooding, and stagnant recycling rates for a decade. This situation must improve.\n\nHow infrastructure performs today\n\nThe first National Infrastructure Assessment was published in July 2018. Since then, it has shaped infrastructure policy across sectors. The government’s National Infrastructure Strategy, a formal response to the first Assessment, aligned with the Commission’s recommendations, and there has been significant progress on many of the recommendations, including:\n\nAccess to gigabit capable broadband: The government has set out a clear vision to deliver gigabit capable broadband to at least 85 per cent of UK premises by 2025, and deliver nationwide coverage by 2030. Currently around 75 per cent of premises have gigabit capable broadband — up from five per cent in 2018\n\nA shift to renewable electricity: There has been a shift towards a highly renewable electricity system, with around 40 per cent of electricity generated by renewable sources in 2022 — up from less than ten per cent in 2010\n\nElectric vehicles: Following the Commission’s recommendation that charging infrastructure should be delivered to support electric vehicles, sales of electric vehicles have increased sharply and government has put in place policy to phase out sales of new petrol and diesel cars\n\nFlooding: Between 2021 and 2027 the government has committed to investing £5.6 billion to reduce the risk of flooding\n\nDrought resilience: Government and the water industry in England have taken on the Commission’s recommendations to increase water supply and reduce leakage, although a lot more still needs to be done\n\nThe UK Infrastructure Bank: In June 2021, government launched the independent infrastructure financing institution the Commission recommended be established following the UK’s loss of access to the European Investment Bank\n\nTransport devolution: Following the Commission’s recommendation that there should be greater devolution of transport budgets, government established the five year City Region Sustainable Transport Settlements for Combined Authorities.\n\nHowever, in other infrastructure areas, the quality of infrastructure services provided to the public needs to urgently improve:\n\nlittle progress has been made to decarbonise heat, although the technologies to do so already exist\n\nemissions from transport have not been declining (Figure 1.2), despite improvements in engine efficiency, and, although electric vehicle charge point numbers are increasing, the pace needs to accelerate to enable the transition to electric vehicles\n\nasset maintenance issues undermine performance in some sectors, including ageing and leaky water pipes and potholes in local roads\n\nabout 900,000 properties in England have a more than one per cent chance each year of being flooded by rivers and the sea and around 910,000 properties have a more than one per cent chance of flooding from surface water\n\nthe number of serious pollution incidents caused by water company assets remains unacceptably high; moreover in 2021 only 16 per cent of water bodies achieved good ecological status\n\nno major water supply reservoirs have been built in the last 30 years to tackle the increasing risk of drought\n\nrecycling rates have plateaued and emissions from waste remain too high, while the total waste generated in England is increasing\n\nin many major regional English cities it takes too long to reach city centres\n\nthere are too many journeys between towns and cities on major roads across England that are slow or indirect, creating barriers to trade.\n\nIn addition to underperforming infrastructure services in some areas, over the last two years the cost of some infrastructure services has risen dramatically. For example, in 2022 the government intervened to stop the average gas and electricity bill from exceeding £2,500 a year. This still represented a significant increase on the average bill, which in 2019 had been around £1,250 a year. The Commission is acutely aware of the challenges households are currently experiencing in the face of rising costs of living. Infrastructure policy will only be effective if it is affordable for households across the country and with different levels of income. Taken together, if the Commission’s recommendations were implemented, they would place bills overall on an enduring downward trajectory. More detail on this is set out in Chapter 5.\n\nRecent costs increases for households underline the importance of keeping the cost of building economic infrastructure under control. The cost of building economic infrastructure in the UK is high by international standards. Recent years have seen even more acute pressures from high levels of construction inflation. The UK must get better at controlling the costs of major infrastructure projects overall. Part of this comes from improvements in the way infrastructure projects are delivered including the approach to procurement, construction and project management, the use of digital tools, and the capability of government and other infrastructure operators to act as an intelligent client. The Infrastructure Projects Authority advises government on best practice in infrastructure delivery. But part of the solution also comes from having greater policy stability and long term plans, removing barriers, and improving infrastructure decision making — all areas covered by this report.\n\nTaking advantage of strategic opportunities\n\nThe Commission has identified three cross cutting strategic opportunities that economic infrastructure is key to seizing:\n\nenergy security and reaching net zero\n\nsupporting growth across all regions\n\nimproving resilience and the environment.\n\nThese are linked to the Commission’s own objectives to: support sustainable economic growth across all regions of the UK, improve competitiveness, improve quality of life, and support climate resilience and the transition to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nThe Commission’s remit extends to economic infrastructure within the UK government’s competence. The Commission’s role is to advise the UK government, but the Commission works with both the UK government and the devolved administrations where responsibilities interact.\n\nFigure 1.1: There is substantial devolution across the Commission’s remit\n\nDevolved administration responsibilities, by infrastructure sector\n\nNorthern IrelandScotlandWales DigitalReservedReservedReserved EnergyDevolved, except nuclearReserved, except energy efficiencyReserved, except energy efficiency Flood riskDevolvedDevolvedDevolved TransportDevolvedLargely devolvedDevolved, except rail WasteDevolvedDevolvedDevolved Water and wastewaterDevolvedDeveolvedDevolved\n\nSource: Commission analysis of devolution legislation and agreements\n\nAll recommendations made in this Assessment apply only to areas within UK government competence, and investment figures are calculated on this basis. All costs presented in this document are in 2022 prices unless otherwise stated.\n\nEnergy and reaching net zero\n\nTo create a net zero economy by 2050 the UK needs to move away from gas and oil. To meet its legally binding climate targets, the UK must reduce its overall greenhouse gas emissions by 78 per cent compared to 1990 levels by 2035, and to net zero by 2050. Good progress has been made: greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 were around 45 per cent lower than in 1990. However, the vast majority of recent progress has been driven by decarbonising electricity generation, while in other sectors, progress has been much slower (see Figure 1.2). Urgent action is needed to put the UK on track to meet the Sixth Carbon Budget and achieve a net zero economy by 2050.\n\nOver two thirds of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions come from economic infrastructure:\n\n55 MtCO2e (15 per cent) from generating electricity, which needs to fall to less than 10 MtCO2e by 2035\n\n90 MtCO2e (20 per cent) from heating buildings, which needs to fall to around 45 MtCO2e by 2035\n\n100 MtCO2e (25 per cent) from fueling vehicles, which needs to fall to around 50 MtCO2e by 2035\n\n75 MtCO2e (20 per cent) from powering industry, which needs to fall to around 20 MtCO2e by 2035.\n\nFor almost all sectors, moving away from fossil fuels means switching to electricity. Running the economy on cheaper, reliable low carbon electricity is the best way to cut emissions.\n\nFigure 1.2: Emissions from infrastructure have fallen, but there is more to do\n\nAnnual greenhouse gas emissions by infrastructure sector, 1990 to 2021\n\nSource: Commission calculations using Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (2023), Final UK greenhouse gas emissions national statistics: 1990 to 2021\n\nNote: Industrial emissions are not included in economic infrastructure in this chart.\n\nDecarbonising the economy will also bring significant economic benefits. Moving away from internationally traded fossil fuels will reduce the country’s exposure to volatile fossil fuel markets, helping to protect living standards. Moving at pace in the global transition to low carbon technologies gives the UK the best chance of building international competitive advantages in some sectors. Perhaps most importantly, creating cheaper energy in the long term — a key input into almost all economic activity — will lower costs for firms and households across the economy, generating productivity and economic growth benefits to the UK.\n\nSupporting growth across all regions\n\nThe UK suffers from persistent slow growth and entrenched regional inequalities. Since the mid 2000s, UK productivity has fallen further behind comparator countries such as France, Germany, and the United States. In addition, the UK has long standing and self reinforcing variations in economic outcomes between and within regions. One of the reasons for this poor economic performance in recent years is low levels of investment in the UK economy compared to international peers: in the 40 years to 2019, investment in the UK averaged around 19 per cent of GDP, the lowest in the G7.\n\nCities can play a central role in boosting both regional and national growth. They have the highest employment density and highly productive businesses, and economic growth in cities has big spill over benefits on the wider regions in which they are located. Most economically successful towns in England are close to successful cities. But some of the largest English cities are underperforming their potential. London is the only major city that outperforms national productivity. This is not the case in comparable countries, where many cities outside the capital have above average productivity (see Figure 1.3). Analysis suggests that the ‘productivity gap’ in major English cities is in the tens of billions of pounds per year. The productivity of underperforming areas needs to be improved, while at the same time maintaining the productivity growth of high performing areas.\n\nWhile infrastructure cannot solve these problems alone, better infrastructure is necessary for improving productivity growth in certain places. Effective transport infrastructure can facilitate trips within cities and more efficient trade of goods and services between them. However, transport infrastructure in England does not perform well enough:\n\nEngland’s largest regional cities are congested, and their public transport networks underperform relative to comparable European cities\n\nthere are wide variations in interurban connectivity between similar places, with rail journeys between major cities in the Midlands and the North often slow, and the services unreliable.\n\nThe quality and reliability of public transport in major cities needs to be brought much closer to that of London. At the same time, London’s transport system must be maintained at its world class level, given the important role London plays both regionally and nationally. Improving strategic road and rail links should also be focused on places where it can have the most impact, rather than spreading investment too thinly. Improving transport infrastructure impacts more than just economic growth; it will also have a positive impact on living standards more generally.\n\nBroadband and mobile networks also play a role in boosting economic growth and improving living standards. Past investments in digital infrastructure have supported significant economic growth. For example, it has been estimated that between 2002 and 2016 there was a cumulative 6.7 per cent increase in UK GDP due to increased broadband adoption and speed improvements. Delivering nationwide coverage of gigabit broadband and new 5G services can stimulate innovation and help to improve productivity in some sectors.\n\nFailure to provide adequate economic infrastructure can also act as a constraint on growth. There are examples of lack of capacity on the electricity networks leading to delays of over 15 years in grid connections being reported. This is preventing both electricity generation projects from moving ahead and business that need to connect to the electricity network from delivering projects. Similarly, in some areas of the country water scarcity is preventing potential new housebuilding. These challenges are discussed in Chapters 2 and 4 respectively.\n\nFigure 1.3: English cities have productivity below the national average, unlike international comparators\n\nGDP per worker, percentage difference compared to national average, in England and comparable countries\n\nSource: OECD (2021), Labour productivity, Metropolitan areas; OECD (2021), Level of GDP per capita and productivity for 2018 (2016 for France and Japan)\n\nImproving resilience and the environment\n\nA resilient infrastructure system is critical to protecting the economy and preventing disruption and damage to people’s lives. The UK’s economic infrastructure has proved fairly resilient to shocks and stresses over recent decades, but challenges are increasing. Since 2000, the number of service interruptions in the energy and water sectors has, on average, been falling. In contrast, service interruptions in transport have been trending upwards. Recent shocks, such as the energy price crisis, have revealed vulnerabilities and highlighted the interdependence between infrastructure sectors. In the coming decades, risks from climate change will increase due to wetter winters, rising sea levels, and drier summers (see Figure 1.4).\n\nTo respond to this, the UK’s infrastructure must become more resilient. The Commission’s social research demonstrates that the public has low levels of confidence in the resilience of the UK’s infrastructure.\n\nFigure 1.4: Climate change is likely to lead to hotter, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters in the UK\n\nMet Office central projections of forecast changes for mean summer surface air temperature (left), summer precipitation (centre) and winter precipitation (right) for 2061-2080, relative to a 1981-2000 baseline\n\nSource: Met Office (2018), UKCP18 Land projections: Science Report\n\nThe natural environment is in decline. Globally, the stock of natural capital is decreasing, species extinction is accelerating and ecosystem health is deteriorating. The latest biodiversity indicators in the UK show declines in the status of threatened habitats and species, as well as increased pressure from invasive species. While economic infrastructure is not the principal cause of this decline, it has contributed to it.\n\nIn recent years, the UK has taken action to try to address this. The government set out targets for improving the natural environment in the 25 Year Environment Plan. These include targets and ambitions on clean air, clean and plentiful water, thriving plants and wildlife, minimising waste and using resources from nature more sustainably and efficiently. Meeting these targets will help support a more productive economy and boost living standards. Well designed and effectively delivered economic infrastructure, such as water resource or waste systems, have a key role to play in meeting the government’s goal of improving the environment over coming decades.\n\nEngland’s largest cities are congested and their public transport networks underperform relative to comparable European cities. Government investment in mass transit is required in the largest regional cities to ensure they have the public transport capacity – seats and standing space on bus, trams and rail – they are likely to need in the future to support growth and quality of life. Government investment is also required to improve connectivity – the ability of people to get from one place to another – where this is an issue. The Commission’s analysis suggests that the initial priorities for investment should be Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds and Manchester and their wider city regions, as growth in these places is likely to be constrained over the next 20 to 30 years unless they can increase capacity on their public transport networks. The government should make this financial support conditional on cities committing to introduce measures to reduce car journeys in city centres, and cities should provide a contribution to the funding of any large projects.\n\nTransport budgets should be devolved to all local authorities responsible for strategic transport so that all places are able to maintain existing infrastructure – for example improving the condition of road surfaces – and invest for local growth. This will also help places develop locally led infrastructure strategies through which transport investment can be considered against long term goals and planned alongside housing and land use development. Locally led infrastructure strategies should also be used to ensure that transport infrastructure is accessible for all groups in society. London has a world class public transport system that supports its contribution to the national economy – government should agree a long term funding settlement to enhance and expand London’s public transport network to unlock growth and housing opportunities, and support quality of life.\n\nFor the national road and rail networks, the government’s first priority should be to maintain existing networks by investing adequately in maintenance and renewal, including ensuring resilience to climate change impacts. The government should then plan and invest in enhancements to the networks aligned to an integrated strategy for interurban transport, targeting underperforming sections of the network with enhancements that can facilitate trade in goods, and provide better connections between cities to facilitate trade in services. For the road network, a pipeline of projects with these aims in mind is required for the next 20 to 30 years.\n\nGovernment had developed a long-term plan to improve rail performance between cities in the North and the Midlands. The High Speed 2 line between London and Manchester via Birmingham, alongside Northern Powerhouse Rail and other changes, would have improved north-south and east-west rail connectivity. This investment would also have freed up capacity on the existing rail network, enabling more local and regional services to run and providing significant increases to city centre accessibility. The Commission’s analysis for government suggested that a package of these schemes would generate significant economic benefits for cities in the North and the Midlands from substantial capacity and connectivity improvements.\n\nThe second Assessment has been undertaken on the basis of the delivery of this long term rail plan. On 4th October, government announced that High Speed 2 from Birmingham to Manchester will not go ahead and set out a new package of transport schemes. This decision leaves a major gap in the UK’s rail strategy around which a number of cities have based their economic growth plans. While government has committed to re-allocate all the released funding to improve transport, including rail links, in the North and Midlands, it is not yet clear what the exact scope and delivery schedule is for the proposed new rail schemes. A new comprehensive, long term and fully costed plan that sets out how rail improvements will address the capacity and connectivity challenges facing city regions in the North and Midlands is needed.\n\nAlongside better transport connectivity, government also needs to ensure that it supports high capacity digital connectivity across all areas of the country. The UK has seen strong progress on gigabit capable broadband in recent years. To continue this progress and meet its targets to deliver nationwide coverage by 2030, the government must continue to support network competition while delivering the £5 billion subsidy programme in the hardest to reach areas.\n\nThe government should also support a market led approach to 5G deployment by improving the consistency of planning approvals across the country and supporting access to radio spectrum for private networks. The government should prepare to act fast to support 5G deployment in areas where the market is unwilling to deliver should the need arise. Better digital connectivity will also be vital in supporting the needs of other infrastructure sectors. Between now and the end of 2026, the government should set out plans for how the telecommunication needs of the energy, water and transport sectors will be met, and ensure that the infrastructure needed is delivered by 2035 at the latest.\n\nThe challenge ahead\n\nTransport and digital infrastructure allow people to access the things they need and want, and businesses to trade. These networks play an important role in supporting national and regional growth by supporting productivity and also improve quality of life for people by making it easier to access public services, retail and leisure activities and social networks.\n\nGrowth across all regions means supporting faster growth in low productivity regions and maintaining the economic performance of high productivity regions. Cities are the places with the most potential to grow – they have the highest employment density, largest concentrations of productive business sectors, and there is a strong relationship between the economic success of a city and its surrounding region. But large regional English cities are underperforming economically given their population size – this underperformance is one of the reasons that the UK’s productivity is worse than comparable countries.\n\nBetter transport infrastructure within cities can help support growth. It does this by enabling more trips within cities, which helps expand labour markets and attract business investment, and by facilitating the efficient movement of goods and services to support trade between cities and regions.\n\nThe policy challenge is how interventions can enable these economic benefits while decarbonising transport. The transport sector is the single largest source of carbon emissions in the UK. Transport decarbonisation, and the policies to support the take up of zero emission vehicles, are discussed in Chapter 2.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of investing in digital connectivity – faster, reliable, higher capacity fixed broadband connections enabled a sudden, widespread shift to homeworking in many workplaces. The sustained increase in home and hybrid working since the pandemic shows that gigabit capable broadband networks will only become more important as demand continues to grow.\n\nThe recent increase in home and hybrid working has not however negated the long term case for investing in improved transport networks into and between cities: over the next 20 to 30 years the largest cities are likely to need investment in more capacity if demand and growth are not to be constrained. This is the case across a range of scenarios for levels of home and hybrid working.\n\nAlongside supporting increases in remote working, digital networks support economic growth and ensure that the UK remains competitive. Better digital infrastructure can improve workplace productivity and help to stimulate innovation through enabling new technologies and behaviours. 5G and other advanced digital technologies will enable UK businesses to adopt more efficient practices such as enhanced monitoring and automation, and will support new ways of working, including augmented and virtual reality.\n\nFinancial sustainability of public transport networks\n\nPassenger numbers on public transport in cities declined following the Covid-19 pandemic and remain below pre-pandemic levels on average. In Greater Manchester for example, overall passenger numbers on the bus network were estimated to be around 86 per cent of pre-Covid levels in June 2023, and commuter trips on the Metrolink tram network were around 88 per cent of pre-pandemic levels on average in January 2023, although on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays this was typically reaching or exceeding 100 per cent of pre-pandemic peak commuter numbers.\n\nLower overall patronage on public transport systems has meant that revenue remains below pre-pandemic levels in many places. This, combined with inflationary pressures on operating costs, has created financial challenges for urban public transport systems.\n\nThere is a risk of a ‘doom loop’ for public transport, with insufficient funding requiring cuts to services, which then further reduces patronage and therefore revenues. Without further support or an increase in overall patronage, levels of service will be difficult to maintain. This could lead to a permanent loss of services that would turn out to be necessary in the long run if employment and travel demand grow. Even if services are later reinstated, people may not return to using them, as changes to people’s travel patterns could be difficult to reverse.\n\nThe government provided substantial financial support for public transport services following the Covid-19 pandemic – its immediate priority for supporting growth in cities should be to continue to ensure the financial sustainability of public transport services. The government continues to provide some support to maintain service levels, but funding support for light rail systems ended in 2022 and the government’s funding support for bus services up to 2025 appears insufficient to protect and maintain existing services – cuts to services are expected over the next two years and unless passenger numbers increase substantially over that period, continued funding will be necessary beyond 2025.\n\nThe government should offer financial support to mayoral combined authorities to ensure the stability and reliability of their public transport networks over the next two years. During this two year period, the government should work with mayoral combined authorities to consider the long term sustainability and resilience of existing funding models for public transport systems, and the extent to which additional or new sources of funding will be necessary to secure this. This funding model should recognise the full value of public transport systems to people, the economy and the environment, and consider the revenue models used by urban transport systems in comparable countries.\n\nBetter transport for cities\n\nCities are important for national growth, and also for driving growth in their wider regions. Cities enable highly skilled people and businesses to cluster together, in turn attracting more highly skilled people, businesses and services, and allowing expertise to be shared and workers and businesses to be more specialised. All these agglomeration effects can help make people and businesses more productive.\n\nHowever, large regional English cities are less productive than similarly sized European cities. This is in part due to a lack of accessibility. Compared to equivalent European cities, fewer people in English cities can easily access city centres, see Figure 3.1, due to poorer transport networks and lower housing density. This reduces the ‘effective size’ of the cities, meaning businesses do not have as wide access to labour markets as comparable cities, affecting productivity and growth potential. This underperformance of cities has a negative effect on national growth and contributes to regional disparities in England.\n\nFigure 3.1: Accessibility of city centres by public transport in large English cities is worse than for comparable European cities\n\nPercentage of the city’s population that can access the city centre within 30 minutes by public transport\n\nSource: Centre for Cities (2021), Measuring Up\n\nPublic transport investment to unlock growth\n\nBetter transport and increased housing density could help address this underperformance by increasing the ‘effective size’ of city centres. City centres in places like Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester have been rejuvenated in recent decades and have been successful in their own right, but they are not as accessible as they could be and this may have hampered growth in wider city regions. Improving public transport networks can help increase the ‘effective size’ of these cities and support growth. In comparison, it would not be possible for everyone to commute by car into English cities, given the levels of road congestion and impact on air quality.\n\nTo improve public transport networks, some cities will need to invest in mass transit. Mass transit, using buses, trams and rail, or a combination of these, can increase capacity in the cities with the highest employment growth projections, connect parts of cities that were previously poorly served by public transport, and can carry substantially higher numbers of people than cars. Investment in mass transit should be aligned with policies on land use and housing within cities.\n\nThe government should prioritise public transport investment in places where poor public transport networks may be acting as a constraint on growth. Returns on this investment should be high, delivering productivity benefits as well as wider user benefits. Public transport investment should be targeted at the largest, most economically important cities with existing or projected needs based on capacity or connectivity. Government should consider whether there is also a case for investment in other cities.\n\nAddressing constraints to growth in four of the largest English cities\n\nThe Commission’s analysis has identified four cities likely to require substantial investment in public transport capacity to keep up with expected employment growth: Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and Bristol. The expected shortfalls are shown in Figure 3.2. Investment will be necessary even if hybrid and home working remain above pre-pandemic levels. Box 3.1 sets out the Commission’s approach to scenarios.\n\nThese four cities also have high projected population growth, and below average levels of public transport connectivity, as shown in Figure 3.3. These four cities are also among the largest in England in terms of economic size, and their performance has a large effect on growth in their surrounding regions. It is therefore vital to national and regional economic growth that productivity in these regions is maximised.\n\nFigure 3.2: Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and Bristol are likely to have substantial shortfalls in public transport capacity in the longer term given their expected employment growth, even if working from home remains established\n\n2050 scenarios for extra capacity required in the morning peak hour\n\nSource: Steer (2023), Urban Transport Capacity, Demand and Cost: Main Report\n\nNote: The scenarios shown above have been selected to highlight the range of possible outcomes. Data for all scenarios are available in the full report by Steer.\n\nFigure 3.3: Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and Bristol have high levels of projected employment growth but relatively poor public transport connections\n\nPublic transport connectivity and projected city centre employment growth up to 2055 in the 15 largest regional English cities\n\nSource: Steer (2023), Urban Transport Capacity, Demand and Cost: Research Methodology; Prospective (2022), Transport Connectivity Methodology Report\n\nNote: The data for employment growth projections was developed by Steer on behalf of the Commission, and the connectivity metrics are based on analysis undertaken by Prospective on behalf of the Commission. Projected employment growth is shown in absolute terms to illustrate the increase in capacity that it could require.\n\nGovernment should commit £22 billion for major transport projects in cities. Two thirds of this should be for major transport projects in Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Bristol and their wider city regions. The scale of capacity increases that the Commission’s analysis indicates are required in these cities are likely to justify investing in tram or rail based projects, although the exact type and mix of projects is a decision for cities to determine with government based on the costs and benefits. Given major scheme lead in times, project planning and business case development should proceed as soon as possible, as the Commission’s analysis establishes the case to act.\n\nThe Commission’s analysis suggests that overall investment needs to increase from an average of around £55 billion per year over the last decade (around ten per cent of UK investment) to around £70 to 80 billion per year in the 2030s and £60 to £70 billion per year in the 2040s. This is a significant increase and will be challenging to deliver. But it is what is required to achieve low carbon and resilient infrastructure that supports economic growth and protects the environment.\n\nThe costs of the upfront investment will be paid for by consumers over the coming decades, not all at once. There should be support for the households who can least afford extra costs. And in the long run, transitioning to an energy system that runs on cheaper, reliable low carbon electricity should set household costs on an enduring downward trend.\n\nInvesting for the future\n\nThis Assessment provides a fully costed plan for infrastructure spending that is affordable within the resources set out by government. All recommendations made in this Assessment apply only to areas within UK government competence, and so the plan does not include spending where infrastructure investment decisions rest with the devolved administrations.\n\nThe Commission’s analysis suggests that overall investment in economic infrastructure will need to increase from an average of around £55 billion over the last decade to around £70 to £80 billion per year in the 2030s and £60 to £70 billion per year in the 2040s. While this is significant, economic infrastructure only accounts for around ten per cent of total investment in the UK economy. Private capital will be needed to finance the majority of this new investment.\n\nDelaying this investment would mean delaying the benefits of better quality infrastructure services. This Assessment sets out why urgent action is needed to tackle climate change, boost growth and living standards, improve resilience and protect the environment. Delayed action also increases costs. For example, the poor track record on installing energy efficiency has led to higher energy bills in recent years. The UK needs to invest in its own future — and now is the time to act.\n\nFor the Commission’s recommendations to be deliverable within the funding profiles set out here, the cost of infrastructure must be kept under control. The cost of building some infrastructure in the UK is high by international standards. Recent years have seen even more acute pressures from high levels of construction inflation. The UK must get better at controlling the costs of major infrastructure projects overall. Part of this should come from improvements in the delivery of infrastructure projects, including the approach to procurement, construction and project management, the use of digital tools, and the capability of government and other infrastructure operators to act as an intelligent client. The Infrastructure and Projects Authority advises government on best practice in infrastructure delivery. But part of the solution will also come from having greater policy certainty and long term plans, stable funding not feast and famine cycles of investment, removing barriers, and improving infrastructure decision making — all areas covered by this report.\n\nPublic investment\n\nThe recommendations in this Assessment will require gross public investment from 2025 to 2040 to be at the upper bound of the government’s guidance (the Commission’s ‘fiscal remit’) – i.e. 1.3 per cent of GDP. From 2040 to 2055, the Commission’s recommendations will continue to require substantial spending within the fiscal remit, but there will also be scope for new priorities. More detail on how the Commission’s recommendations meet the fiscal remit is set out in Appendix A.\n\nTo deliver the Commission’s recommendations, the government’s planned increase in economic infrastructure investment should be maintained for the long term. Over the last decade, public investment in economic infrastructure averaged around £20 billion. At the latest spending review, government committed to increase this to around £30 billion for the years 2022-23 to 2024-25. This is a sharp rise, and the government should ensure that it does get spent. Government consistently underspends capital budgets: in recent years one in every six pounds of planned capital expenditure has gone unspent.\n\nIn particular, the Commission’s recommendations require core public investment for:\n\nTransport: Transport constitutes the largest proportion of government investment in economic infrastructure (Figure 5.1), and will need to be held flat in real terms at an average of almost £28 billion per year between 2025 and 2040, covering:\n\nUrban transport: Increasing investment from 40 per cent of public investment in transport in 2025 to 50 per cent by 2040, reflecting the economic importance of cities, including a significant increase in investment in public transport in major regional cities while maintaining London’s world class transport system\n\nRoads: Rebalancing investment across the country, addressing recent underinvestment in the North and the Midlands; the government’s last five year plan for investment in the Strategic Road Network only allocated 22 per cent of funding for new investments to these regions\n\nRail: The second Assessment has been undertaken on the basis of the delivery of the Integrated Rail Plan. On 4th October, government announced that High Speed 2 from Birmingham to Manchester will not go ahead and set out a new package of transport schemes. This decision leaves a major gap in the UK’s rail strategy around which a number of cities have based their economic growth plans. While government has committed to re-allocate all the released funding to improve transport, including rail links, in the North and Midlands, it is not yet clear what the exact scope and delivery schedule is for the proposed new rail schemes. A new comprehensive, long-term and fully costed plan that sets out how rail improvements will address the capacity and connectivity challenges facing city regions in the North and Midlands is needed.\n\nEnergy: £0.5 to 2.5 billion per year between 2024 and 2050 to decarbonise public sector buildings by deploying heat pumps, heat networks and energy efficiency\n\nDigital: Completing the £5 billion investment on rolling out gigabit capable broadband networks nationwide by 2030\n\nFlood risk management: A rolling programme of around £1 to £1.5 billion per year to protect households and businesses from flooding from rivers and the sea, and to tackle surface water flooding\n\nWaste: Around £0.5 billion per year to safely collect, process and dispose of municipal and industrial waste, preventing harmful waste products from entering the environment.\n\nThe Commission has also identified a series of investments that will only be necessary in some future scenarios. These investments are included within an ‘adaptive’ spend line in the fiscal remit. They are fully costed and affordable but should not be committed to until more is known about whether they are required. This includes investment needed if the world warms more than expected, if decarbonising the economy requires more intervention than planned, or if committed infrastructure projects overspend.\n\nFigure 5.1: Public investment in economic infrastructure must be maintained at high levels\n\nPublic sector investment in infrastructure, broken down by sector, 2013 to 2055 (excluding capital support to households and businesses)\n\nSource: Commission analysis\n\nNote: Gap in the chart covers the three years of Spending Review 2021. HM Treasury committed £100 billion in current prices over these three years. No sectoral breakdown has been published and the outturn data for this period is not yet available.\n\nIn addition to maintaining these high levels of investment in economic infrastructure, government must also spend money to support households through the energy transition. As set out in Chapter 2, the Commission is recommending that all households and small businesses are eligible for a £7,000 subsidy to purchase a heat pump or connect to a heat network, and that lower income households have a full subsidy. To do this, government will need to spend around £3 to 12 billion per year over the next 20 years (around 0.3 to 1.2 per cent of total public spending). Contributing to the capital cost of household heating is an important new role for government, but it is also a temporary one. Once households have transitioned to heat pumps or heat networks, this spending will no longer be required.\n\nGovernment has directly supported upgrades to housing before. From the 1940s, government started offering subsidies for households to improve their indoor plumbing, including indoor bathrooms. By the 1970s and 80s government was offering grants to cover most of this cost, but the need for government intervention fell away once all houses had been upgraded.\n\nFigure 5.2: Government should support households to decarbonise their heating systems\n\nCosts of supporting households and small businesses to purchase heat pumps or connect to heat networks\n\nFive year average annual spending (£ billion) 2025-292030-342035-392040-442045-492050-54 Government capital spending on supporting households to decarbonise heating28124.520.5\n\nSource: Commission analysis\n\nAttracting private investment\n\nThe Commission’s analysis suggests investment from the private sector will need to increase from around £30 to 40 billion per year over the last decade to £40 to £50 billion in the 2030s and 40s. The Commission’s analysis is based on sector level modelling using publicly available data and expert engagement. It is not based on bottom up assessment of company business plans. The main areas that will require private sector investment are:\n\nEnergy: £20 to £35 billion per year between 2025 and 2050 of investment in renewable generation capacity and flexible sources of generation, electricity grids, and hydrogen and carbon capture and storage networks\n\nDigital: £5 billion per year over the next decade in deploying gigabit capable networks nationwide and deploying 5G mobile across the country\n\nWater: Around £12 billion per year from 2025 to 2030 falling to £8 billion per year from 2030 to 2050 to increase water supply, reduce demand, and tackle pollution.\n\nAs set out in Chapter 6, securing this increase in private sector investment in economic infrastructure requires stable and coherent policy and regulation, and swifter decision making from government. There is private capital available but market conditions are challenging and there is intense global competition to attract it, with incentives available under the US Inflation Reduction Act and the EU Net Zero Industry Act. The UK needs to be competitive in the global market for investment in modern infrastructure. To do so, the UK will need to: have clear, long term policy; remove planning barriers that delay projects and deter investment; and put in place stable regulatory models that allow rates of return that cover cost of capital and are commensurate with the level of risk involved.\n\nFigure 5.3: Delivering a low carbon and secure energy system will require a big increase in private sector investment\n\nCommission estimates of private sector (non household) investment in economic infrastructure, broken down by sector, 2013 to 2055\n\nSource: Commission analysis\n\nNote: The period between the latest outturn data in 2021 and the start of Commission forecasts in 2025 follows a straight line interpolation and is greyed out to reflect the lack of data. Energy investment is typically lumpy and the projection has been smoothed.\n\nWhile the Commission is calling for significant spending from government to support households to decarbonise their heating, some direct household investment will also be required to purchase heat pumps or connect to heat networks.\n\nFor this reason, the Commission is recommending that any spending required from households on heat pumps and heat networks is eligible for zero per cent finance backed by the government. This means households will be able to spread the upfront cost of a heat pump over several years at no additional cost.\n\nFigure 5.4: Households and small business investment in heat pumps and heat networks\n\nCosts to households and small businesses to purchase heat pumps or connect to heat networks\n\nFive year average annual spending (£ billion) 2025-292030-342035-392040-442045-492050-54 Household investment on decarbonising heating5.35.89.14.84.77\n\nSource: Commission analysis\n\nNote: The numbers in the table represent total investment from households and small businesses to cover the capital costs of installing heat pumps and connecting to heat networks. They do not subtract the costs that households and small businesses would have otherwise spent on gas boilers, which averaged around £6 billion per year between 2015 and 2020. As such, these are not the incremental investment costs households and small businesses will face and are instead the total costs.\n\nThe Commission’s recommendations are affordable for households\n\nImpact on household costs\n\nThe Commission is acutely aware of the context in which it makes the case for increased infrastructure investment. This is particularly important when it comes to the investment required from households and businesses. Since 2019, households, particularly those on lower incomes, have faced a series of adverse shocks, most recently on cost of living. A significant proportion of the population are in fuel poverty. The costs of the required infrastructure changes will ultimately by funded by households and businesses — either through taxation, bills, or the price of products purchased.\n\nFor the next five to ten years, energy costs will largely be driven by the volatile and difficult to predict price of natural gas. But as the economy electrifies, the price of natural gas will become a less significant factor in overall costs.\n\nOver the medium to long term, the key driver of lower household costs will be the move from fossil fuels to cheaper, reliable low carbon electricity. A fossil fuel based system has high operating costs, as natural gas, coal, or oil must be continually purchased and burned to generate power. In comparison, a system running on renewable power, with electrified transport and heat, will have high upfront costs that can be spread over a longer period of time. But once it is built it is cheaper to run. Offshore wind, onshore wind and solar farms have very low operating costs as they require no fuel inputs. Heat pumps and electric vehicles are much more efficient than gas boilers and petrol or diesel cars. The cheaper operating costs of a lower carbon energy system more than offset the high upfront costs of building it, leading to lower household costs over time.\n\nIn total, the Commission’s analysis estimates that overall household spending on infrastructure services should fall by over £1,000 from today’s level of around £7,300 per household to around £5,500-£6,500 by the mid 2030s. The following make up the key elements of household spending on infrastructure services:\n\nA likely long term rise in water bills to address drought risks and pollution concerns, as set out in Chapter 4 (see Figure 5.5 and Box 5.1).\n\nThis should be more than offset by falling energy spending which the Commission’s analysis suggests will reduce from around £2,200 in 2022 to less than £1,400 in the 2030s, below 2019 levels.\n\nThe costs to households of transport should also fall due to the switch to electric vehicles. The average household transport fuel bill is expected to fall from £1,000 to between £500 to £600 in the late 2030s, and the total cost of purchasing an electric vehicle is expected to fall, reaching price parity with a petrol/diesel car by 2030.\n\nIn total, the Commission’s analysis estimates that overall household spending on infrastructure services should gradually fall from today’s level of £7,300 per household, returning to 2019 level by the mid 2020s and falling to around £5,500 to £6,500 per household by the mid 2030s.\n\nThe Commission’s analysis on household costs aims to produce an indicative long term projection based on high level modelling, aligned to the recommendations in this Assessment. The Commission has not undertaken a detailed bottom up forecast of household infrastructure costs for the coming years.\n\nFigure 5.5: Overall household spending on infrastructure services should fall by over £1,000 from today’s high levels\n\nHousehold spending on infrastructure services 2019 to 2055\n\nSource: Commission analysis\n\nDistributional impact of the Commission’s recommendations\n\nCritically, it is not only the aggregate household spend that is important but also the impact on different types of households.\n\nThe Commission’s analysis demonstrates that in aggregate, the recommendations in this Assessment should not have a disproportionate impact on households with lower incomes (Figure 5.6). Households on the highest incomes spend most on infrastructure, so would stand to save more money from falling bills than those on low incomes. But as a proportion of total household expenditure, it is low income households that will likely benefit most. The Commission has recommended supporting lower income households where recommendations would otherwise have a disproportionate impact on them — for example covering the full cost of heat pumps for these households. The key distributional impacts of the Commission’s recommendations are:\n\nlower income households tend to spend a higher proportion of their income on energy and would stand to gain relatively more from falling energy bills and subsidy support for low carbon heating\n\nhigher income households tend to spend a much higher proportion of their income today on transport than poorer groups and will benefit more from falling transport costs\n\nincreasing water bills could disproportionately affect lower income households because there is little variation in water bills across household income groups compared to the variation in income. Government should consider how to best mitigate this impact on lower income households.\n\nFigure 5.6: The Commission’s recommendations should not have a disproportionate impact on households with lower incomes\n\nImpact of Commission’s recommendations on household spending on infrastructure services by income decile\n\nSource: Commission analysis\n\nMore detail on the distributional impacts of the Commission’s recommendations across different groups can be found in Appendix A.\n\nPeople’s experience of using and paying for infrastructure services will inevitably differ from aggregate analysis. As argued elsewhere in this Assessment, it will be essential that government remains alert to the financial impacts of implementing the Commission’s recommendations on individuals, not just aggregate groups.\n\nIn addition to considering the impact of costs on different groups and individuals through distributional analysis, the Commission has also undertaken initial work to consider how the effects of its recommendations might impact on people with different characteristics. This has been done by:\n\nUndertaking expert external engagement on key equality, diversity and inclusion issues for economic infrastructure sectors. This aimed to understand how people with different characteristics might experience infrastructure, and how policymakers can improve the experience of people with protected characteristics.\n\nUndertaking social research to understand how people with different protected characteristics experience and view infrastructure, including any barriers that may be faced, in particular in transport, heating and recycling. Key findings from this are covered in Box 1.1 in Chapter 1.\n\nBackground\n\nThe costs of economic infrastructure services are all ultimately paid for by households. Businesses pass their infrastructure costs on to households, either through bills or the cost of products purchased. The money government invests in economic infrastructure comes from households, via general taxation. For clarity, in this appendix costs are presented according to who pays them first: households, businesses, or government.\n\nThe Commission has fully costed all the recommendations set out in this Assessment. To fulfil the requirements of the Chancellor’s remit letter to the Commission, these costs are presented in two different categories: the ‘economic remit’ and the ‘fiscal remit’.\n\nThe economic and fiscal remits align with UK government competence, respecting devolved responsibilities for economic infrastructure. They do not include spending where infrastructure investment decisions rest with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe economic and fiscal remits cover costs of the six economic infrastructure sectors: energy, transport, water and wastewater, waste, flood risk management and digital communications.\n\nThe economic remit\n\nThe Commission has analysed how the recommendations in this Assessment will impact costs for households, businesses, and government from 2025 to 2055. These are covered in the Commission’s ‘economic remit’. The economic remit does not include the gross public investment required to realise the Commission’s recommendations — this is included instead in the ‘fiscal remit’ in the next section. The economic remit does, however, include any resource (day to day) expenditure required by government on economic infrastructure.\n\nThere are high levels of uncertainty associated with creating projections of costs 30 years into the future. To account for this, costs are presented as ranges rather than simple point estimates. The Commission’s analysis is based on sector level modelling using publicly available data and expert engagement. It is not based on bottom up assessment of company business plans. The Commission has produced an indicative long term projection based on high level modelling, aligned to the recommendations in this Assessment. The Commission has not undertaken a detailed bottom up forecast of household infrastructure costs for the coming years.\n\nIn total, the Commission’s analysis estimates that spending on infrastructure services by an average household should fall from today’s level of around £7,300 per household, to between £5,500 to £6,600 by the mid 2030s, and £5,100 to £6,100 by 2055. The detailed sectoral breakdown of these costs is set out in Figure A.1. The key factors behind this are:\n\nHousehold spending on energy will fall from around £2,200 in 2022 to below £1,400 in the 2030s and remain at this lower level until "
