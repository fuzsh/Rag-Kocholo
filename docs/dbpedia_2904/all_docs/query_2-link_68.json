        "text": "This CPD introduces isolation valves (IVs) that are likely to be found in domestic and commercial HVAC applications. IVs are essential components of every piping system, to allow selective isolation of sections for on-off control, maintenance, removal, and commissioning. There are numerous IVs employed in a commercial system and, as illustrated in Figure 1, even a relatively small sub-system of low temperature heating distribution pipework serving two fan coils will include in the order of 10 IVs.\n\nThe selection of appropriate IVs is based on parameters that relate to the specific application including the size and type of pipe and the operating pressure inside and across the valve; these are discussed in the boxout ‘DN and PN for pipework components’.\n\nThe most common types of isolation valve employed in general HVAC applications are ball valves and butterfly valves. These are well suited to the traditional low-temperature hot water (LTHW), chilled water (CHW) and domestic hot and cold-water services found in commercial and domestic applications – and when closed, they offer a tight seal at their rated differential pressures.\n\nIn most cases, IVs are likely to be hand actuated; however, most types may be readily adapted to accept motor actuation. They are typically available with stem extensions to allow, for example, access to a handwheel beyond the thickness of insulation. IVs are normally connected to the pipework by taper thread (such as in Figure 2), flange (such as in Figure 3), or by using a compression or press-fit fitting. Threaded connections may be to UK/European standard BS EN 10226-2 or US-based ANSI B1.20.1 – although these appear similar, they employ a different taper angle and are not interchangeable. All isolation valves include sealing glands and packing to prevent the leakage of water around the stem. Although modern materials, such as PTFE, can provide a long-lasting, robust seal these will still require maintenance, such as tightening of the gland nut (as shown in Figure 2).\n\nEffective and energy-efficient selection of isolation valves in contemporary HVAC systems will require knowledge of the system operating fluid, pressure and temperature; the pipework type and dimensions; the method of jointing/connection (which will relate to the standards being applied in the particular project); and knowledge of the available space – both in the pipe and the surrounding area. This information can then be used to evaluate the most economical IV that meets the performance requirements and, importantly, has the highest value of Kv.\n\nThe cost of pumping through valves and fittings\n\nBased on a simplification of the definition as given in CIBSE Guide C3 the valve coefficient (Kv) is the flow of water through a fully open valve, measured in cubic metres per hour, that will induce a pressure loss of 1bar. The flow coefficient (a constant for the open valve) is useful to evaluate the pressure drop at different flow rates as Kv = Q /√Δp where Q is the volume flow rate of water (m3.h-1) through the valve and p = pressure drop across valve (bar), and by converting the units to those more normally used in HVAC applications, volume flow rate of water (L.s-1) and pressure drop (kPa) Kv = 36Q /√Δp and this can be more usefully be reorganised as Δp = (36Q/Kv)2\n\nFor example, considering a full bore, butterfly valve, with a Kv of 98 (taken from manufacturer’s data sheet) in a 50mm steel pipe carrying 2kg.s-1 water at 30°C (such as a return LTHW return from an underfloor heating system).\n\nFor simplicity, assuming the density of water is approximately 1,000kg.m-3 (actually 995kg.m-3), 2kg.s-1 ≈ 2 L.s-1.\n\n2 = 0.540kPa. A similarly sized ball valve with a Kv of 338 has a pressure drop of (36 x 2/338)2 = 0.045kPa.\n\n(These compare with a pressure loss of 0.190kPa.m-1 in straight 50mm steel pipe.4)\n\nApplying the relationship that power to move water (W) is volume flow (m3.s-1) x ΔP (Pa) indicates that by using the ball valve in place of the butterfly valve will save water power of (2×10-3) x (540 – 45) = 1W.\n\nFor continuous operation, 1W of extra water power in the UK is likely to cost in the order of £2 each year for pump power and indirectly add 3kg to CO2 emissions.\n\nDN & PN for pipework components\n\nThe nominal pressure (PN or ‘pressure nominale’) is used to specify the required pressure class for a valve. Based on a BS EN standard,5 PN values are quoted in Renard series values, which in HVAC applications are typically the lower values of PN10, PN16, PN25, PN40 and PN50. These indicate the maximum working pressure in bar gauge (at a specific temperature) for the valve, and should be selected for at least the highest pressure that can be developed in the piping in which they are installed. Some valves are rated in terms of ANSI/ASME class – for example, class 150 (which would equate to PN20). However, when considering flange connected valves, the flange hole configurations are not the same in the ANSI/ASME as in the BS EN standards.\n\nThe nominal diameter (DN or ‘diamètre nominal’) of valve connections is quoted in millimetres, with values rounded to integers that relate to the physical size of the bore or the outside diameter of the end connection. There is a preferred set of DN values6 that also map to the oft-quoted inch-based US nominal pipe size (NPS) with, for example, the smaller sizes DN 10, DN 15, DN 20, DN 25, DN 32 equating to NPS ⅜” ½”, 1″, 1¼ “. The number following the letters DN does not represent a measurable value and should not be used for calculation purposes, except where specified in a relevant standard.6 So, as an example a DN 50 (2″) pipe has an outside diameter of 60.33 mm (2.375″) – the clear inside diameter will vary with the material and the pressure rating. Components such as valves and pipes with the same DN are dimensionally compatible with one another."
