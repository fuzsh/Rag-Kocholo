It was founded by Peter Wood and Martin Long in 1985 as the insurance division of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) Group and became the UK’s first telephone-only insurance provider, thus the name.\n\nDirect Line became a “standalone insurance company” in 2012, after a divestment from the RBS Group. The company was then the subject of an initial public offering (IPO) in October of that year, when RBS Group sold a 30% share of the business. In March 2013, RBS sold a further 17% share and another 20% in September of that same year before selling the remainder of its holding in February 2014, completing the divestment.\n\nOver the years, Direct Line has grown to become one of the UK’s largest insurance companies, owning several subsidiaries. It is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index, which consists of the 101st to 350th largest companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nDirect Line Group: The brands\n\nThe group owns several brands and subsidiaries. These consist of:\n\nDirect Line\n\nDirect Line started as a telephone-only car insurance provider in 1985. Its goal has always been to “put the customer first” by “cutting out the middleman, the forms, and the jargon” – considered revolutionary changes in the insurance industry during that time. At present, Direct Line offers a range of products, including home, pet, travel, life, over 50s life, and cycling. Customers can now access the brand’s policies online as well.\n\nIn 2007, the company launched the Direct Line for Business brand, which offers various commercial insurance policies to landlords and small businesses nationwide.\n\nChurchill\n\nChurchill is one of the UK’s leading providers of general insurance products – including car, home, travel, and pet insurance – which customers can access over the phone and online.
