Also, Bradford's departures are split between two stations, which may make it seem poorer still.\n\nA very good summary!\n\nA number of the \"worst connected\" suggestions are coastal (Brighton, Portsmouth, Liverpool, Blackpool, Sunderland, Aberdeen) which often means that they aren't really on the way *to* anywhere and that (whilst their civic populations may be relatively high) a lot of the surrounding area is taken up by water instead of commuter towns.\n\nAccording to ORR the central Liverpool stations have a combined total of 1.8 million interchanges per annum. In comparison Hull which has a similar geographical position has 65,720 interchanges per annum and Blackpool North has 4,578.\n\nMost of Liverpool's \"interchanges\" will be from Mainline to Merseyrail (and vice versa) or Merseyrail to Merseyrail.\n\nBy \"Mainline\", I mean trains coming in/out of Lime Street upper level.\n\nMainline to Mainline would probably be higher at South Parkway to allow journeys such as Winsford to Widnes. The extension of the Blackpool to Liverpool service to South Parkway has probably resulted in a slight decrease in mainline to mainline changes at Lime Street but some journeys still need a mainline interchange at Lime Street.\n\nAberdeen only has routes north and south, and probably the least rail departures of any of the \"proper\" cities, despite having a relatively large and spacious station.\n\nWell there isn't a great deal in terms of population to the west and, well the east speaks for itself...\n\nÂ—\n\nI think we can all agree that it would be easier to compare metropolitan/urban areas rather than cities.\n\nI'd say Lincoln has worse transport connections than either of those places.\n\nBradford and Sunderland may not have great direct trains, but they both have 6tph to the \"bigger\" city a few miles up the road.\n\nLincoln basically has an hourly service to Sheffield, Nottingham and Peterborough (although the service is anything but clockface), with a very irregular service to Doncaster or Grimsby. There are two London trains a day which depart within a few minutes of each other, and that's your lot.\n\nLincoln's only a small place though. As someone pointed out upthread this only has any meaning if couched in terms of population. Bradford, with a population of 450,000, has I would say worse connectivity than anywhere its size, or even half its size. And to those who would say that 6 trains per hour to the 'bigger city up the road' makes up for this, I would advise never to say this or otherwise conflate Leeds and Bradford if you are actually here!\n\nLincoln's only a small place though.

Let's say 350,000 in the city itself. Direct services from Shipley to Carlisle and Morecambe (4 a day) is hardly great shakes in terms of wider connectivity. Huddersfield for example is less than half this population and (by an accident of history) has a much better service, and as for York..... The residents of these places would not be content if suddenly they had to change at Leeds, even if they did have 6 tph.\n\nNonetheless it is still a very poor service for a city of its size.

Are you saying that because Cumbria has a greater population than Huddersfield it should have a more frequent service to York? For a place with a population of 146,000 Huddersfield doesn't have particularly good rail links unless you're going to somewhere on the North TPE network.\n\nEDIT: Just realised you were talking about Bradford.\n\nNonetheless it is still a very poor service for a city of its size.

The residents of these places would not be content if suddenly they had to change at Leeds, even if they did have 6 tph.\n\nThere's 5 a day to Lancaster and Morecambe and 6 to Carlisle. As a resident of Bradford Borough I've found these links to be very useful on occasion. Sure I'd love them to be more frequent but they can be quite useful as they are - and both connect to the WCML without having to change in Bradford and Manchester.\n\nHuddersfield is great if you're going East/West but there's no direct services to London from the main station - and it takes about as long to get to Leeds or London as it does from Bradford. It has about the same number of services going South to Sheffield as Bradford has on its two northbound services.\n\nOne I thought of is Leicester, yes it does have 4 trains per hour to London and the Birmingham to Stansted Airport trains but it doesn't have any connections to the North West, North East, Scotland or the South West.\n\nYes, I agree with that. Regional links within the East Midlands, i.e. the Derby - Nottingham - Leicester triangle are pretty good, with 2tph between each of them, but if you are travelling to anywhere that isn't the West Midlands, London or East Anglia then it is poorly connected.\n\nIt also depends how you define ''connected'': if you mean by direct trains then it is poorly connected, but the number of places you can get to with just one change is much greater, via Birmingham New Street, Peterborough or Derby/Sheffield."
