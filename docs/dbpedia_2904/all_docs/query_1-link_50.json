        "text": "An overview of Leeds\n\nLeeds, positioned in the centre of West Yorkshire, has a lot of heart.\n\nOnce the industrial capital of Yorkshire, Leeds is now a trendy, modern city with a popping arts scene and growing tech industry. Its beautiful shopping quarters, fashionable bars, and swathes of green space make it popular with young people and families alike. Outside of the urban area, over 65% of the district is green belt land – and better yet, you’re only 20 miles away from the stunning Yorkshire Dales National Park.\n\nThe city is diverse and cosmopolitan, with almost 13% of its 800,000-strong population being born overseas (only slightly below the UK-wide figure of 14%).\n\nInterested in moving to Leeds? Find out how much it’ll cost you to ship your belongings there by popping a few details about your move into this short form. We’ll then put you in touch with our professional suppliers, who will contact you with free shipping quotes to compare.\n\nThe cost of moving to Leeds\n\nThe cost of moving to Leeds will of course depend on two key factors: where you’re moving from, and how much stuff you’re moving.\n\nIf you are looking to move the contents of a three-bedroom house (roughly 875 cubic metres of stuff) from London to Leeds, you should expect to pay roughly £1,331. This fee includes:\n\nloading/unloading\n\npacking services/materials\n\ndismantling/reassembling of furniture\n\nthe fee for distance travelled\n\nThe drive from London to Leeds is around 200 miles, and most removal companies charge £1 per mile (source: comparemymove, 2020).\n\nThe amount of money you’ll end up paying for the move will also depend on the removal company you hire, your moving date, and whether you opt for any supplemental services, such as packing and assembly.\n\nProperty prices\n\nHouse prices in Leeds are basically middle of the pack when it comes to a UK-wide comparison.\n\nIn Zoopla’s UK Cities House Price Index 2019, Leeds placed 13th in a ranking of 20 UK cities, with a house-price-to-earnings ratio of 5.7.\n\nWhat does this mean? The house-price-to-earnings ratio tells you how affordable housing is in a particular area, and it’s calculated by dividing the average property price by the average annual salary. The higher the number, the more expensive the area’s property is (relative to earnings).\n\nLeeds’s ratio of 5.7 isn’t too bad, especially considering London, Cambridge and Oxford sit at the top with 13.1, 12.2, and 11.9 respectively.\n\nThe average house price in Leeds has increased by 9.26% over the past 12 months to £229,876. However, the average price for flats is significantly lower, at £171,519, and the average price for terraced housing lower still, at £158,583 (source: Zoopla, 2020).\n\nIf you’re looking to rent in Leeds, the average cost of rent in the city in 2019 was £715 per month – noticeably lower than the national average of £886 (source: Leeds Live, 2019).\n\nGetting in and out of Leeds\n\nWe’re not trying to suggest that escaping Leeds should be a top priority once you’ve moved there, but there are definitely advantages to living in an accessible city. Like when you want to go on holiday, for instance.\n\nFortunately, Leeds isn’t a fortress. Accessing the city by road is easy as pie; the M1 runs right through it. You can get to Leeds Bradford Airport in 30 minutes, and Leeds railway station runs direct trains to cities all over the country. A train to London takes just over two hours.\n\nFor more information, check out the visitleeds website.\n\nPublic transport in Leeds\n\nThe city of Leeds is pretty compact, so it’s easy to walk everywhere. However, if you’re thinking about your new commute, you’ll be relieved to know that Leeds has excellent public transport options.\n\nIts network of buses and trains normally run from around 5am – 11pm, with smaller train stations located in many of the Leeds suburbs. A weekly bus pass costs £17 on the mTickets app, while a weekly train pass from a Leeds suburb (e.g. Headingley) to the city centre is around £55.\n\nFind out more information about Leeds public transport in the NewToLeeds guide.\n\nWorking in Leeds\n\nIn terms of employment, Leeds is full of opportunity.\n\nAccording to Leeds City Council, the city’s economy grew by 34% over the past ten years, and it is forecast to grow by a further 21% over the next decade. Other than London and Cambridge, Leeds is the UK’s most popular place for fast-growing firms.\n\nKey sectors in Leeds include financial and business services (38% of total output), retail, leisure, tourism, manufacturing, construction, and the creative industries.\n\nCompanies employing more than 1,000 people in Leeds include Centrica, BT, Yorkshire Bank, Direct Line, Asda Group, and Ventura. There are also three universities, and the largest teaching hospital trust in Europe.\n\nRoundhay\n\nA peaceful neighbourhood for families\n\nAverage property price: £360,351\n\nSituated three miles northeast of the city centre, Roundhay is probably the priciest part of Leeds. The area is full of Victorian homes that sit along the whopping 19th-century Roundhay Park (more on that further down the page), along with modern flats.\n\nResidents here enjoy a peaceful, almost rural atmosphere, despite being so close to the centre of Leeds. Roundhay is well kitted out with bars, restaurants, delis and cafes, so you’ll have something to do on the weekend. There are also lots of fantastic schools in the Roundhay area, both primary and secondary. Check out the top schools in Roundhay.\n\nHolbeck Urban Village\n\nA trendy neighbourhood for young professionals\n\nAverage property price: £245,000\n\nIn the 18th century Holbeck was still a village situated outside Leeds, but it eventually became absorbed into the city proper, and by the mid-19th century it was right in the action. Holbeck today is quite a deprived part of Leeds, but a section of it has experienced significant regeneration in recent years – this is the Holbeck Urban Village.\n\nThe new flats there are very snazzy, and a whole mixture of techy startups, leisure facilities, bars, pubs and restaurants have popped up along the canal. The indie breweries near Granary Wharf are a paradigm of northern hipsterdom.\n\nCultural stuff\n\nAhead of even London, in 2017 the Times voted Leeds the number one ‘best cultural place to live in Britain’. There are well regarded organisations across Leeds that provide year round entertainment – check out the programmes for The Northern Ballet, Opera North, and the West Yorkshire Playhouse for starters.\n\nThe two main city plazas, Millennium Square and Victoria Square, sit alongside each other and are home to the Leeds City Museum and Leeds Art Gallery, respectively. There’s also the Royal Armouries Museum, where you can ogle fascinating exhibits that used to be held in the Tower of London.\n\nLeeds is also extremely proud of its heritage in film and cinema – did you know that in 1888, Louis Le Prince filmed moving picture sequences in Leeds, which are the oldest surviving film in the world? The Leeds International Film Festival is an annual event that draws fans from across the country.\n\nGreat shopping\n\nLeeds is a dream for shopaholics, with no less than eight indoor shopping centres, as well as the main pedestrianised shopping street Briggate with its many arcades – some dating back to the late 1800s.\n\nIn particular, the Grade II listed Grand Arcade is full of wonderful independent shops, and was designed by Victorian architect Frank Matcham. The rich marbles, gilded edges, and wrought iron archways are spectacular to behold, and conveniently really make you want to spend money.\n\nMeanwhile, the impressive Victoria Gate opened in 2016, and was shortlisted for the ‘Best Shopping Centre in the World’ at the MIPIM Awards in 2017. It’s got a big glass ceiling, and it’s home to the largest John Lewis outside London.\n\nRoundhay Park\n\nWhat began as a medieval hunting ground has become Leeds’s pride and joy. Roundhay Park was opened as a public park in 1872, and since then nothing in Leeds has been able to top it. At 700 acres it is one of the largest city parks in Europe, home to a wealth of woodland, lakes, gardens, and – most importantly – space. The park also houses the fascinating Tropical World (full of butterflies and meerkats) and loads of interesting birds (especially herons and woodpeckers).\n\nIf you’re into sport, Roundhay Park has pretty much got you covered. Football pitches, tennis courts, a golf course, a skate park, bowling greens, canoe clubs, grass for running on, lakes for swimming in – it’s all in the park."
