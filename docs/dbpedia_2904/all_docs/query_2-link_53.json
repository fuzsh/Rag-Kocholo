        "text": "June 2024: Z Hotels is increasing its portfolio with the addition of Z Leicester Square bringing the total number of properties to 15. Centrally located in Charing Cross Road the property will be open to guests in late 2024 and will have 81 rooms. This brings the total number of Z Hotels rooms across the country to more than 1,800.\n\nThe property will follow the same Z Hotels concept which guests and repeat visitors know and love but, it will also feature some quirky new additions.\n\nThis is the first new property development for Z Hotels since the pandemic and indicates a bounce back in demand for London hotels.\n\nThe enviable location will allow guests to be right in the heart of theatreland and within walking distance of some of the main London tourist attractions including The National Gallery, China Town, Soho, Piccadilly Circus, Oxford Circus, Leicester Square, Covent Garden, and the Royal Opera House. Z Hotels is known for its unique locations at the heart of the city which suits both leisure and business guests.\n\nBev King, founder of Z Hotels said “This new development is a significant moment within the Z Hotels journey, in 13 years we have grown from the opening of Z Soho in 2011 to 15 properties. On completion of Z Leicester Square 12 of our hotels are in London and then we have one each in Glasgow, Bath and Liverpool. Consumer demand for our compact luxury model and uniquely central locations at affordable rates has been a driver for us to increase our footprint within the Capital and we are looking forward to welcoming guests to Z Leicester Square soon.”"
