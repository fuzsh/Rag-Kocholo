        "text": "Shares in Direct Line opened up as the insurance business is floated on the London stock market.\n\nRoyal Bank of Scotland (RBS) set the final price of stock in its insurance arm at 175p this morning, ahead of the start of conditional trading.\n\nThis values the company at £2.625bn - lower than many in the City originally expected.\n\nRBS said it had raised £787m from the sale of 30% of the company, or 450 million shares.\n\nStockbrokers had reported strong demand for shares in Britain's largest motor insurer among the general public.\n\nRichard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown, said \"thousands\" of buyers had registered for shares since the pricing range was announced.\n\n\"The issue seems to have captured the retail investor's imagination, with a well-known brand in the midst of a turnaround story appealing.\n\n\"The additional possibility of a decent dividend yield is also an attraction given the current interest rate environment.\"\n\nRBS has to sell off the entire company to receive EU approval for the £45bn bailout it received in 2009.\n\nThe 82%-taxpayer owned bank must sell a majority stake in the group by the end of next year and the rest of its shares by the end of 2014.\n\nIt has been under pressure to secure a good price for the business to reduce the loss to taxpayers.\n\nBut the Office of Fair Trading cast a shadow over the flotation when it announced it was referring the motor insurance industry to the Competition Commission over concerns it is \"dysfunctional\".\n\nThis raises questions over the profitability of Direct Line's motor insurance arm, which represents around 42% of its premiums.\n\nDirect Line Group, which offers insurance on homes, cars, pets and travel, owns a number of household brands including Churchill, Green Flag and Privilege.\n\nUnconditional trading of its shares will begin on October 16."
