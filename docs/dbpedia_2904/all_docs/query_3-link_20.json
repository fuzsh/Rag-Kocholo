        "text": "“After 35 years in its Bromley location, Direct Line Group recognised the need to adapt to the evolving digital landscape. The new HQ aimed to attract top tech talent and foster a culture of learning, development, collaboration, and creativity.\n\nTSK Group conducted an in-depth analysis of Direct Line Group’s data and consulted with the team to understand their needs. This led to the design of new flexible, zoned working areas that would encourage collaboration and an agile work style.\n\nThe result is a stunning Thameside office that reflects Direct Line Group’s dynamic, hybrid team. The space features five ‘dynamic zones’ designed for specific tasks, from learning and focus to social interaction. The adaptable design has been built from an easily adjustable freestanding system that allows for future changes as the business evolves.\n\nThe design maximises natural light, incorporates biophilic elements, and offers wellbeing amenities like gender-neutral facilities, a multi-faith prayer room, and a calm zone for neurodiverse staff.\n\nSustainability was also a key priority, with the project achieving a RICS SKA Silver accreditation. Direct Line Group’s offices at Riverbank House now occupy a quarter of the space of the previous buildings, using a quarter of the carbon footprint.\n\nThe new HQ embodies Direct Line Group’s commitment to attracting and retaining top talent, with an energised, collaborative environment that celebrates the company’s diverse culture. There’s an amazing sense of energy there now. It’s an exciting place to be.”"
