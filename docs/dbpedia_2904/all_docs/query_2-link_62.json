        "text": "The Vancouver System or Numbering System is commonly used in the medical and scientific disciplines. References are numbered in the text, either in line with the text within brackets (1) or using superscript¹ , in the order in which they appear. A reference which is cited more than once is given the same number. The references are then listed at the end of the text in numerical order.\n\nThese links explain how to reference using the Vancouver system. See below for a brief introduction to using Vancouver.\n\nA to Z - detailed information on referencing different types of resources\n\nVancouver referencing handbook (Word - 85KB)\n\nVancouver Referencing FAQs\n\nReferencing hints and tips\n\nGlossary for referencing\n\nOther useful resources for Vancouver referencing\n\nFor help and support with referencing or other academic skills, contact the Academic Skills Centre. Researchers should contact the Research Skills team.\n\nFor detailed help with referencing examples, please also use the University-subscribed Cite them right online, published by Macmillan International and developed from the authoritative Cite them right by Pears and Shields. Other useful resources, in particular from the National Library of Medicine (USA), are given at the end of this page.\n\nQuick guide to Vancouver referencing\n\nThis is an introductory guide to citing and referencing using the Vancouver system. See the A to Z for detailed guidance on citing different types of resources. Alternatively, Cite Them Right Online is an external website that offers guidance on a number of different referencing systems, including Vancouver.\n\nCiting in text\n\nVancouver uses numeric references in the text, either numbers in brackets (1) or superscript.1 These in‐text numbers are matched to full, numbered references for each publication in a reference list. The reference list is arranged in numerical order i.e. the publications are listed in the order they appeared in the text, and not alphabetically by author(s) or editor (s) name.\n\nUsing numbers in text\n\nWhen citing two or more sources at once, write a number for each separated by a comma e.g. (1, 2) or (6, 12)\n\nWhen citing more than two sources which are numbered consecutively, use a hyphen instead of a comma e.g. (3-5)\n\nIf you need to cite a particular work more than once, you can use the same reference number for each citation\n\nNumbers should be in brackets and placed after punctuation marks such as full stops or commas, but before colons and semi-colons\n\nPage numbers. It is recommended that page numbers should be included in in-text citations where this is necessary to indicate a specific part of the text, for example with a direct quote or paraphrase, eg (2, p. 20) or (2, p. 20)\n\nReference list\n\nThe reference list should only include sources you have cited in your text. List any sources you read, but did not cite in your work, in a separate bibliography\n\nA reference gives the full details of the brief citation you have referred to in text and is shown at the end of your essay. A reference will include authors, titles, editions, publisher details and journal details\n\nKey things to note about references\n\nWhen referencing journals the title must be abbreviated. For a list of journal abbreviations please see the NCBI NLM catalog.\n\nMany science publications are the result of collaborative work, resulting in multiple authors who require citation. If the work has six authors or fewer, list all of them. If there are more than six authors, list the first six authors followed by et al.\n\nExample list of references\n\nMartin EA, editor.
