        "text": "Today, our CEO, Adam Winslow hosted Direct Line Group’s Capital Markets Day, sharing the Group’s strategic vision. Adam commented, “Today, we have set out our strategy and objective to position DLG as the customers’ insurer of choice. “Since joining DLG just over four months ago I have rigorously reviewed our business, and listened carefully to investors, customers, and employees. This work has deepened my belief in our strong foundations and excellent potential. “Putting our strongest brand, Direct Line, on price comparison websites, where 90% of consumers shop, means we will be shaking up the motor insurance market once again. “However, DLG is about more than just Motor, and we have ambitious plans to grow in Home, Rescue and Commercial Direct. “Our refreshed strategy will be delivered by our new executive team, who have significant expertise in our core markets. “The strategy and targets set out today signal our ambition and intention to grow our business and deliver strong returns for our shareholders.” To learn more about our plans, please watch an interview with BBC broadcaster, Justin Webb speaking to Adam Winslow: https://lnkd.in/grkuMgaQ Read more about our strategy: https://lnkd.in/gTagT2qT\n\n“I like working at DLG because it's so collaborative”. That’s what our Head of Operational Resilience and Crisis Management, Finlay Curror, had to say when we asked him what it’s like to lead a team at DLG. “We routinely get people together in a room who have the right skill set and who understand the problem that you’re trying to solve and then empower them to work together to find a solution. At DLG, we’re all one big team, and we’re all working together for the same outcome. It’s a great company to work for, and the people make it what it is. I work with genuine, competent and professional people who are passionate about what they do. It’s fantastic.” Want to be part of a team where collaboration is key? Come and join us. #CollaborativeWork #WorkplaceCulture #JoinOurTeam #technology\n\nWhat’s it like to work as part of DLG’s Pricing and Underwriting team? “No two projects are alike”, says Natalie Cooke, who’s been with us for almost three years. “Each time a particular project draws to a close, I come away feeling that I have not only added value and developed new relationships but that I’ve also grown and developed in some way, whether it’s challenging my comfort zones, building upon existing skills and experience, or developing new ones. I think the qualities you need in this role include a commercial mentality, an ability to build and maintain relationships, to influence and engage with senior stakeholders, and to constructively challenge the status quo. I also love supporting and mentoring colleagues as they start a new career in Pricing and Underwriting as part of their DLG journey”.

Hugh continues, “In fact, if you asked me to say one thing about working at Direct Line, it would be that you really do control your own career, and you’re allowed to take on learning opportunities.” “For example, one aspect of my role is helping my direct reports to identify where they want to go in their careers. I’ve then been able to walk alongside them on their journey as they’ve developed and, ultimately, moved up.” “So, if you want opportunity, a chance to drive your career and learn from a great bunch of people, then DLG is the place to be.” Come and work for a company that encourages you to be the best you can be - join our Pricing and Underwriting team. https://ow.ly/8WEz50SGVV8 #CareerGrowth #ProfessionalDevelopment #JoinOurTeam #Pricingandunderwriting\n\nHave you ever considered a career in insurance? Last month we sponsored the Young Professionals Summer Conference, with over 3,000 students coming together to learn about a range of industries and career choices. It was a hugely inspiring day! We heard from Anu Bankole who told us to embrace our true selves. She reminded us that sometimes the qualities we think are weaknesses turn out to be our biggest strengths. Audrey Boyd spoke about focusing on the things you can change, and letting go of the things you can’t. Wise words indeed! We were blown away by the inspirational young people we spoke to. Their fresh perspectives and enthusiasm was wonderful to see. It’s fair to say, the future is in good hands. If you attended the event, let us know what your main takeaways were - add a comment below.....\n\n“Everyone joining from day one is made feel welcome, and this continues throughout their career with Green Flag.” That’s according to Green Flag Roadside Technician John Keegan, who joined us one year ago. John says, “I joined Green Flag after already spending over 32 years in the motor trade. I joined because I wanted to be part of the patrol force starting at the beginning of a new chapter in Green Flag history. I feel I’ve been given the opportunity to shape the future of the business, which is not something that comes around very often”. “That’s not the only benefit of working here,” John continues, “There’s also 9% added to your pension, a discount on Direct Line Group products, and the focus on work-life balance is exceptional. It all combines to make you feel very valued as an employee.” Do you want to be part of our future? Come and join us, https://ow.ly/XzZg50Svg5I #GreenFlag #RoadsideTechnician #JoinOurTeam #DirectLineGroup #WeareDLG\n\n“Some of my friends work for Green Flag, and they told me how amazing it is, so I had to see for myself what all the fuss was about!” That’s what new recruit Bryan Henderson had to say when we asked him why he decided to join Green Flag. And he’s pretty pleased he did! “The main thing for me is the work-life balance; it’s amazing here. My partner has even commented on how happy I am with Green Flag. The health benefits and 50% off car insurance aren’t too bad, and I’m working with a great bunch of friendly people, which helps make the day go by a lot easier. I think it’s fair to say that I’m loving it!” Do you think you’ve got what it takes to wave the Green Flag? Come and join us https://ow.ly/MhRK50SkRFg #GreenFlag #RoadsideTechnician #WorkLifeBalance\n\nGreen Flag has recently welcomed six new patrol technicians to the team. They’ll complete three weeks of training, covering everything from battery replacement to electric vehicle training to roadside health and safety, before heading out on the roads to help our customers.
