Five universities provide youthful energy and it’s the only UK city outside London to have its own opera, ballet, and theatre companies. The markets, Victorian arcades and Trinity Leeds mega-mall make it one of the country’s top shopping destinations.”\n\nThere are plenty of suburbs in Leeds that are nice areas to live in.
