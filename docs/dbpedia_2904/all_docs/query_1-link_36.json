        "text": "Leeds is big on business. It may be smaller than some other UK cities, but it certainly packs a punch when it comes to commerce.\n\nLeeds is one of the biggest players in the Northern powerhouse and the most diverse UK urban economy in terms of its business mix.

The world’s first internet browser product was invented in Leeds called Freeserve in 1998 and the global computer game giant Rockstar games started in Leeds and still calls the city home. Quite a line-up!\n\nAnd if that wasn’t enough from the past, here’s how mighty the city’s line-up is now:\n\nDirect Line is one of the big names in Insurance. It has a call centre on the Headrow.\n\nBurberry has its head office on Queen Street right in the heart of the business district.\n\nKPMG has a base in Leeds, one of their largest offices outside of London, employing 400 people. For Professional Services, PWC is household name. It has offices in 157 countries and employs more than 276,000 people. Leeds is home to one of their largest UK sites on Wellington Street employing 350 staff.\n\nFor Law, Addleshaw Goddard LLP is one of the most established firms in the UK, dating back to 1775. It has offices across Asia, GCC, and Europe including Leeds.\n\nEstablished in 1912, Irwin Mitchell has offices in major cities throughout the UK. Found on Wellington Street close to the station, Irwin Mitchell is the 11th largest law firm in the UK with one of the biggest Private Wealth teams in the country.\n\nIn the technology and telecommunications sectors, BT and Sky digital & Sky-bet both calling Leeds their home. Sky digital relocated from London in 2016 to a new UK head office based on Leeds Dock and Sky-bet on Wellington Place.\n\nNew to Leeds\n\nChannel 4 relocated their London HQ to the Majestic building on City Square in 2019, bringing with them a host of production companies who make programmes for them including the renowned Talkback productions.\n\nBusiness districts\n\nThe city welcomes businesses of all sizes.\n\nNew start-ups have a massive choice of co-working and shared spaces. Leeds has an array of modern spaces and renovated industrial buildings harking back to roots as a mill town.\n\nEstablished firms have flourished in Grade A office spaces across Leeds. Global brands relocate here to nestle among other big hitters in industry.\n\nLeeds Dock\n\nLeeds Dock is home to Sky’s Digital & Technology Services Campus spread over has three dock side buildings, which are home to 650 members of staff focused on software and hardware development, including their world-leading Software Engineering Academy. It is also proud to be home of eleven digital and tech companies, as well as Sky’s Digital HQ, whose building won the 2017 British Council for Offices Award for Innovation.\n\nLeeds Dock has over 1,800 residents, an on-site workforce in excess of 2,000, and work closely with key stakeholders and cultural partners such as the Lumen Prize, Light Night and the Royal Armouries to provide a programme of cultural events and activity across the estate and throughout the city.\n\nFinancial Quarter\n\nFrom Park Row to The Headrow and Wellington Street, the Financial Quarter is the location of many of the world’s biggest firms.\n\nThe area includes the buildings for Aviva, Zurich Financial Services, Leeds Building Society, Lloyds TSB, Yorkshire Bank, and The Bank of England, with Yorkshire Bank on Merrion street.\n\nCommercial retail district\n\nLeeds is the 3rd largest retail destination in the UK outside of London. The range of shopping facilities, from individual one-off boutiques to large department stores such as Harvey Nichols and Louis Vuitton outlets, has greatly expanded the Leeds retail base. The Victoria Quarter, originally opened in 1903 contains arcades connected together by stained glass roofing and is the largest, single, operational set of Edwardian arcades outside London.\n\nLocated between the main shopping street of Briggate, and Vicar Lane to the east, Victoria Quarter is a ‘must see’ retail destination in the city, including major brands like Vivienne Westwood, Louis Vuitton, Ted Baker, Reiss and Hugo Boss to name but a few!!\n\nIn October 2016 Leeds’ newest shopping centre Victoria Gate opened, bringing a flagship John Lewis store to the city, along with a variety of luxury brands.\n\nIn addition to the Victoria Quarter arcades, Leeds features several more stunning Victorian arcades, each with their own original features and unique charm: Thornton’s Arcade, Queens Arcade, Grand Arcade and Central Arcade.\n\nOther popular shopping attractions include Leeds Kirkgate Market (founding place of the first Marks & Spencer and one of the largest indoor markets in Europe), Trinity Leeds, The Light, St John’s Centre, The Merrion Centre and the historically significant and epic Corn Exchange, combine to deliver the total shopping experience whatever your preference.\n\nTo develop and continue to grow into one of the leading UK retail destinations Leeds has seen £1 billion investment in this sector over the last decade and that is set to continue in the years ahead.\n\nTransport links\n\nOriginally dubbed the UK’s first ‘motorway city’ in the mid 1950’s, Leeds was one of the first urban centres to rapidly development its road system and network as the UK saw the first wave of growth in private car ownership and expansion. Now Leeds is leading the way in carbon neutral targets across the country and showing, once again, it is a true transport innovator. The £1.6 billion investment currently underway to transform Leeds’ station, one of the largest and boldest cycling schemes in the UK and massive pedestrianisation projects in any urban location, all bear testimony to Leeds environmental commitment for the future of how we all move about.\n\nLeeds is situated in the centre of the north, on the M1, the M62 and the A1(M) motorway which all inter-connect with cities to the north, south, east and west.\n\nLeeds railway station is one of Network Rail’s 20 principal stations and has rail links to London, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow, Edinburgh and other major cities.\n\nThe station is the busiest rail station in the North of England, with 31 million passengers passing through annually, putting it on a par with London King’s Cross.\n\nCity leadership is in advanced development with Government to bring a radical new mass transit system to Leeds which will harness the latest tram technology, surpassing any of the current infrastructure currently operating in the UK.\n\nLeeds is served by Leeds Bradford Airport, with connections to most major European cities. Air connections to Heathrow (British Airways) and Amsterdam (KLM & Jet2.com) are available. The airport proactively expanded in 2018 to include a special British Airways fast-transit area enabling significant growth in UK domestic business travel from London."
