        "text": "A Leeds shopping centre could be demolished under plans set for approval by the council.\n\nThe proposal would see student flats and commercial units replace The Core Shopping Centre on The Headrow.\n\nTwo new streets, linking Lands Lane with King Charles Street between the three proposed blocks, would be created as part of the development.\n\nA report to the City Plans Panel said the shopping centre had struggled to attract retailers in recent years.\n\nThe Core was built in 1987 and was formerly known as the Headrow Shopping Centre.\n\nAccording to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, a report suggests the construction of the Trinity and Victoria Gate shopping centres had impacted its ability to fill its retail space.\n\nIt said: \"Many key stores are vacant, significant sections are totally vacant and a number of other occupiers have confirmed their intention to vacate the building when their leases end.\"\n\nThe proposal, which would go before the panel on Thursday, seeks to completely redesign the site, using classical architecture as inspiration to create three buildings.\n\nThe report said: \"This suits the Chicago-style former Direct Line House directly to the north and the Italianate free style classical buildings on the south side and along Lands Lane.\"\n\nThe upper floors of the new buildings, which are within a 20-minute walk of three university sites, would be used for student accommodation.\n\nThe report said: \"There have been a number of student residential developments completed within the north of the city centre in recent years, for example in the vicinity of the Merrion Centre.\n\n\"These have been successfully accommodated in a busy city centre context without causing amenity issues or conflict with existing businesses and civic uses.\"\n\nDevelopers AFAS The Core and Fusion Global Management applied for planning permission, after complications over the ownership of parts of the land were resolved.\n\nThe panel was recommended to defer and delegate the application for approval by the chief planning officer."
