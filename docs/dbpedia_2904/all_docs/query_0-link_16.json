We're working to identify everyone affected.\n\nCustomers don't need to contact us, either directly or via third parties. We'll contact affected customers directly to put things right.\n\nHave you renewed a home or motor insurance policy with us since 1 January 2022?\n\nSince that date, some home and motor renewal customers were sold policies where the premium was higher than it should have been. We're working to identify everyone affected.\n\nThe majority of our customers who saw an increase in their premium at renewal have not been affected by this issue, as insurance premiums in the UK have also been rising over the last two years due to inflation."
