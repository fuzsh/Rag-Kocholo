        "text": "Richard joined our Graduate Programme in 2017 and found himself relocating over 200 miles away from home to kick start his career at DLG.\n\nAs part of the DLG Graduate Programme, for my first rotation I was based in Leeds. This meant moving from my home in Somerset to Leeds. That’s over 200 miles! It’s been a really good experience; gaining independence by moving out and Leeds is a great city to live in with plenty to offer.\n\nDLG will accommodate and facilitate the opportunity for graduates at each location to get in touch with each other before the start date, helping those looking for a house or flatmate. My flatmate and I met at the assessment centre we both attended, so there are plenty of stages to meet and talk to other graduates on the scheme that will be moving and relocating too.\n\nWhen finding a place I’d recommend looking at some of the rental website, if you know who you want to live with and are happy to set things like broadband up yourself.\n\nIf you are happy moving straight in to a house share, which are usually all set up with broadband, energy providers and sometimes have an all-inclusive system, there are plenty of websites that offer shared housing.\n\nRichard's first few weeks really helped him meet others on the Grad programme as well as learn about Direct Line Group.\n\nThe induction week is a great opportunity to meet your fellow cohort, learn about the business and understand how you will fit in to DLG. You will have the opportunity from the get-go to learn about yourself, how you work and what communication/learning techniques are most effective for you, all of which you will take with you when starting your first placement the following week.\n\nThe experience at the induction week will not only get you ready for your first placement, but will build the excitement of getting stuck in and embracing the opportunity to make real change in the business. The week will provide the opportunity to meet some of the executive members of DLG, which will give you a great start to gaining a sound understanding of the business and its structure.\n\nKeep an eye out for more of our Graduate spotlights and hear what life at DLG is like\n\nApply for our 2018 Graduate Programme and not only work for an award winning company but receive a great salary and awesome.\n\nSalary of £28,150 which will grow as you do – with an annual pay increase on the anniversary of your start date. Plus £2,500 joining bonus, 25 days’ holiday with the option to buy or sell up to five days. What’s more, your benefits are flexible:\n\nStudy support towards the CII qualification\n\nPension contribution of 9% of your base salary (you can choose to contribute less or more, and anything you don’t wish to put into your pension you can take as cash instead)\n\nFree travel insurance and Green Flag breakdown cover\n\nLife insurance, private medical cover and income protection\n\n50% off our Home, Motor, and Pet Insurance products\n\nDiscounts at big name retailers\n\nApply now\n\n2018 Graduate Programme\n\nVisit our social media sites\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram"
