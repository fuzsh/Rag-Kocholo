        "text": "Guglielmo Marconi\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1909\n\nAffiliation at the time of the award: Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co. Ltd., London, United Kingdom\n\nPrize motivation: “in recognition of their contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy”\n\nPrize share: 1/2\n\nWork\n\nIn the late 1880s a previously unknown type of radiation was discovered—radio waves. It was found to have the same nature as light, but with a greater wavelength. Various physicists and technicians investigated whether radio waves could be used to transmit signals. In 1895, Guglielmo Marconi used radio waves to transmit signals over a distance of several kilometers. He developed the technology in subsequent years to achieve greater range. The foundation for both wireless telegraphy and radio had been laid."
