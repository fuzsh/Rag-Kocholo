        "text": "To make a loop tour around the Marconi Station Site, start by taking the paved path from the parking lot that zigzags up to an overlook of the Atlantic Ocean. Here you will find some wayside exhibits about Marconi posted on the observation deck, and you can get a nice view of the ocean.\n\nAnother paved path connects the first observation area to a second. From the second location you used to get a better view, but due to erosion the observation area is getting so close to the edge of the cliff that the National Park Service put up a fence to keep people away from the edge. Prior to the fence, you could risk your life for a good photo by walking all the way to the edge, but not any more. The beach you can see to your left is Le Count Hollow Beach, which is managed by the town of Wellfleet.\n\nMore important than the view, the second observation area is the actual location of the Marconi Station. A memorial marks the site of the station.\n\nFrom the Marconi Station site, there is another short trail that dead ends at a fence. Here you will find some construction debris, including a chunk of wood chained to a rock. There are no wayside exhibits identifying the debris, so I don’t know if this is all that remains of the radio station, but the National Park Service sure doesn’t want anyone walking away with this stuff. Once done taking a look, another path leads back to the parking lot.\n\nPeople think of Guglielmo Marconi as the inventor of the radio, and while this may or may not be true, it was not radio for entertainment (music, news, etc.), but radio for communication. Furthermore, he did not invent the wireless transmission of signals; that was Heinrich Hertz. What he did do was figure out how to transmit and receive the signals over long distances, and he was the first to devise a commercially viable way to use the invention. His “radio” was broadcasting Morse Code and was exactly the same thing as a telegraph, only without wires. In fact, the term for the process is wireless telegraphy. His invention did lead to the eventual transmission of voices and music, the radio we know today.\n\nSCHEDULING YOUR TIME\n\nThere are a few wayside exhibits to read at the Marconi Station Site at Cape Cod National Seashore, but that’s about it other than taking in the views at the overlooks. Unless you plan to hike the Atlantic White Cedar Swamp Trail or have a bite to eat, give yourself fifteen minutes for a stop at the site.\n\nBack to the Top"
