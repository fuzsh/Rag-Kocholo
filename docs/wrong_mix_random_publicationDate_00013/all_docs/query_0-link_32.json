Because categories are arbitrary, browse and scroll for sources relevant to your work. Use these as a springboard for further reading, viewing, and research.\n\nThe David Sarnoff Library makes no representations whatsoever about any other web site which you may access from its site.

In addition, the David Sarnoff Libray does not endorse or accept any responsibility for the content or the use of other web sites or links therefrom.\n\nPrint sources\n\nDavid Sarnoff\n\nDavid Sarnoff, Looking Ahead: The Papers of David Sarnoff (NY: McGraw Hill, 1968).\n\nEugene Lyons, David Sarnoff: A Biography (NY: Harper & Row, 1966).\n\nCarl Dreher, Sarnoff: An American Success (NY: 1977).\n\nKenneth Bilby, The General: David Sarnoff and the Rise of the Communications Industry (NY: Harper & Row, 1986).\n\nTom Lewis, Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio (NY: Edward Burlingame, an imprint of HarperCollins, 1991).\n\nLouise Benjamin, “In Search of the Sarnoff ‘Radio Music Box’ Memo,” Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media 37, 3 (Summer 1993), pp. 325-35.\n\nLooking Ahead reprints many of the significant documents held in the David Sarnoff Library, albeit occasionally with editorial changes. Lyons was a cousin of Sarnoff’s who was forced to remove some less complimentary incidents from his uncle’s life, but the book is a well-written sympathetic portrait of RCA’s leader.\n\nDreher was a sound engineer at RCA in the 1920s who knew Sarnoff then and followed his career later; he has a more tempered view of Sarnoff’s personality. Bilby was vice president for RCA’s public relations department in the 1960s and researched and wrote his biography after retiring. He draws on many of Sarnoff’s reminiscences but plays them and the myths fostered by his former department against the documented historical record. Lewis wrote the companion volume for the PBS documentary of the same name, and is best on the personal lives of Sarnoff, E. H. Armstrong, and Lee DeForest. He bases much of his depiction of the conflict between Sarnoff and Armstrong on Lawrence Lessing’s interpretation in Man of High Fidelity: Edwin Howard Armstrong, a Biography(Philadelphia: 1956), which was developed with the support of the Armstrong Foundation. Since writing her article analyzing the origins of Sarnoff’s legendary memo on the prospects for broadcasting, Benjamin has revised her conclusions in an as-yet unpublished paper that draws on documents at the David Sarnoff Library.\n\nBack To Top\n\nMarconi\n\nBaker, W.J. A History Of The Marconi Company (London: Methuen & Co. Ltd., 1970).\n\nBussey, Gordon. Marconi’s Atlantic Leap (Coventry, U.K.: Marconi Communications, 2000).\n\nTarrant, D. R. Marconi’s Miracle: The Wireless Bridging of the Atlantic (St. John’s, Newfoundland, Canada: Flanker Press, 2001).\n\nThere is no scholarly biography of Guglielmo Marconi in English; refer to the histories of radio and links below. Bussey and Tarrant detail the events of Marconi’s trans-Atlantic reception in Newfoundland of a radio or wireless signal from his station in Poldhu, Cornwall, in the United Kingdom in December 1901.\n\nBack To Top\n\nRadio Corporation of America (RCA)\n\nFor information specifically on RCA, see the following, but the books on specific topics further below are also valuable:\n\nRobert Sobel, RCA (NY: Stein and Day, 1984).\n\nFrederick O. Barnum, III, “His Master’s Voice in America”: Ninety Years of Communications Pioneering and Progress (Camden, NJ: General Electric Company, 1991).\n\nRossi, John P., “An All-American System? Business-Government Relations and the Radio Corporation of America, 1917-1932,” Essays in Economic and Business History 12 (1994) 307-18.\n\nSobel wrote widely on modern American corporations. This one has some minor errors, but offers an intelligible analysis of RCA as a business, as well as the company’s uncertain management in the post-Sarnoff era. Barnum’s book is an exceptional and well-illustrated corporate history that can be found at several libraries in the Philadelphia area.\n\nBack To Top\n\nBroadcast Technologies\n\nHong, Sungook. Wireless: From Marconi’s Black-Box to the Audion (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2001).\n\nInglis, Andrew F. Behind the Tube: A History of Broadcasting Technology and Business (Boston and London: Focal, 1990).\n\nSlotten, Hugh. Radio and Television Regulation: Broadcast Technology in the United States, 1920-1960 (Baltimore and London: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000).\n\nTakahashi, Yuzo. “A Network of Tinkerers: The Advent of the Radio and Television Industry in Japan.” Technology and Culture 41, no. 3 (July 2000), 460-84.\n\nHong is the preeminent scholar on the curious transition from the science of electronic signaling to the development of the three-element electron tube; visit his page for citations and samples of the work leading up to this book. Inglis, a former RCA broadcast equipment division executive, gives a wonderfully clear and even-handed narrative of the technical, political, and commercial issues shaping the development of American radio and television systems, combined with his insider’s knowledge of the broadcast industry. Slotten has added to his scholarly and nuanced view of how the United States developed its commercial radio and television systems. He leads several current scholars in revising the early history of FM in radio.\n\nWho buys a new technology and helps make it fit in society? Takahashi explains how enthusiasts enable the diffusion of new technologies by bridging the gap between professional engineers and producers on the one hand and hobbyists and consumers on the other. For more on this process see Susan Douglas, below, on American radio amateurs and “distance fiends” and any discussion of the origins of home computing and the internet.\n\nBack To Top\n\nRadio\n\nArcher, Gleason.

Aitken provides a modern and readable scholarly analysis about the American development of the use of the electromagnetic spectrum. Barnouw covers the dramatic mix of politics and commercialism that shaped programming and news reportage in three volumes made readable through anecdotes. Douglas and Smulyan look even more critically at the political and commercial construction of broadcast radio and question the inevitability of the commercial network system. Douglas’s latest book is a wonderful history of how listeners, programmers, and inventors have changed radio and the uses for it. Lessing wrote with great sympathy for Armstrong, one of radio’s geniuses. “The Legacies…” is a reflection of the trend toward revising Armstrong’s place in the history of radio, developed also in Inglis and Slotten, above.\n\nBack To Top\n\nTelevision\n\nBurns, R.W. Television: An International History of the Formative Years (London: Peregrinus, 1998).\n\nUdelson, Joseph H.

The Magic Window: American Television, 1939–1953 (Binghamton, NY: Haworth Press, 2002).\n\nBurns’s thorough survey is the only explicitly international history listed here, although Abramson covers all contributors to what became the American system. Udelson develops the most balanced and scholarly perspective of the companies involved in the development of electronic television in the United States to the establishment of the basic broadcast standards in 1941, and the Fishers provide the most readable account that also covers the battle between RCA and CBS over color television after World War II. Abramson covers the inventors and technical developments in scholarly detail, and Keller, an engineer at Tektronix, takes the technical narrative into the 1980s via the most prominent component of the television receiver.\n\nGodfrey has written the standard, scholarly biography of Philo Farnsworth as the inventor of an electronic television system from which RCA ultimately licensed two elements. Elma (Pem) G. Farnsworth published a passionate and understandably prejudiced biography of her husband, Distant Vision: Romance and Discovery on an Invisible Frontier (Salt Lake City: 1990). Abramson and Everson take up the controversies over the development of electronic television in the United States through quite different approaches to the electronic television systems pioneers, Vladimir Zworykin and Farnworth. Everson, who first underwrote Farnsworth’s system, offers the most insightful perspective on the inherent flaw in Farnsworth’s technology. Stashower offers a well-researched and readable account of the invention and development of electronic television in the context of the 1920s and 1930s. Evan Schwartz’s The Last Lone Inventor: A Tale of Genius, Deceit, and the Birth of Television (NY: HarperCollins, 2002) is based on superficial scholarship, technical confusion, and a biased view of the people involved.\n\nBarnouw continued what he started in A History of Broadcasting (see under Radio, above). Ritchie interviewed managers, producers, actors, and actresses on their experiences of producing programming for the new technology in the 1930s and 1940s, and Kisselof expands this approach through an edited series of oral histories. Von Schilling provides a scholarly and readable account of the evolution of television programming in the first fifteen years of commercial broadcasting.\n\nBack To Top\n\nSound Recording and Reproduction\n\nJournal of the Audio Engineering Society 25, 10/11 (October/November 1977).\n\nRoys, H.

A Spiral Way: How the Phonograph Changed Folklore and Anthropology (Jackson, MS: University Press of Mississippi, 1999).\n\nWarren Rex Isom, former chief engineer of RCA Records, guest edited the special issue of the JAES dedicated to the centennary of sound recording and reproduction. Roys was a senior engineer at RCA who specialized in sound recording and he provides an annotated survey of the most important technical articles on the subject from the 1920s to the 1970s. Oliver Read and Walter Welch’s From Tin Foil to Stereo: the Evolution of the Phonograph is badly flawed by its emphasis on Thomas Edison’s importance, while Andre Millard’s America on Record suffers from numerous factual errors.\n\nWile remains the only biographer of the inventor of the gramophone–or disc phonograph–system. Charosh includes a short history of the Berliner record companies that predated Victor Talking Machine in the 1890s. Yorke’s article draws on contemporary sources regarding Victor’s evolution from privately held industry leader to a shrunken division of RCA in the Depression. Aldridge worked in phonograph and consumer products distribution for Victor and then RCA. He also served as unofficial corporate historian for RCA, which published 500 copies of his book. Gelatt, editor of High Fidelity magazine in the 1950s, wrote what remains the best history of the phonograph system, drawing on sources like Aldridge, other industry veterans, and his own encyclopedic knowledge of classical recordings.\n\nMorton writes on the uses of disc and tape recording technologies in applications including office dictation, high fidelity, and answering machines; his website, Dead Recording Media, represents a well-illustrated on-line version of his print work. Gitelman examines how the culture of industrialized writing and recording influenced Thomas Edison and his audiences in their development and application of the phonograph; see her page for more on the phonograph. Brady explores the effects of cylinder recording in ethnographic studies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries on the researchers, the subjects, and their intellectual and genetic descendants.\n\nBack To Top\n\nTheremin\n\nFor the theremin and its inventor, the electronic musical instrument RCA licensed from its inventor in 1929-30, read this thoroughly researched and documented work:\n\nGlinsky, Albert.

We Were Burning: Japanese Entrepreneurs and the Forging of the Electronic Age. (New York: Westview Press, 1998).\n\nHoddeson and Riordan’s prize-winning history uses interviews and archival sources to trace the invention and innovation of the transistor at Bell Labs in the 1940s and 1950s. Bassett draws on corporate records from RCA, AT&T, and IBM as well as other sources to examine the relationships of science, engineering, and business in the invention and innovation of the transistor format that underlies virtually all integrated circuitry today. Johnstone, an Australian journalist, interviewed Japanese, American, and British researchers and businessmen to follow the development and transfer of nascent technologies from the United States to Japan for their commercialization.\n\nBack To Top\n\nComputers\n\nCampbell-Kelly, Martin, and William Aspray.

A History of Modern Computing (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1998).\n\nCampbell-Kelly and Aspray provide a smooth narrative of the development of counting, calculating, and data-processing machines with particular strength on the economic and political incentives in the United States between the 1880s and 1970s. Shurkin focuses more on the people involved in the development of electronic dataprocessing between the 1930s and 1960s. Malone covers the first 25 years of the computer on an integrated circuit in balanced, accessible, fashion. Ceruzzi provides a wonderfully documented and more technical study that runs up to the 1990s to get the history right, and pops a few myths in the process.\n\nFor different perspectives on the process of innovation:\n\nMacLaurin, W. Rupert. Invention and Innovation in the Radio Industry (Cambridge, MA: 1949, reprinted 1975).\n\nBrown, George H.

Brown’s carefully researched book does not reveal its sources but contains all the best stories behind RCA’s efforts to innovate broadcast technologies and a critical look at RCA’s corporate leadership in the 1960s and 1970s. Copies of this privately published work are still available by contacting\n\nGeorge H. Brown, jr.\n\n117 Hunt Drive\n\nPrinceton, NJ 08540-2425\n\nWolpin writes on the race between RCA, Ampex, and Bing Crosby Enterprises for the first practical videotape recorder in the 1950s. Graham worked out of the Harvard Business School to trace the process of RCA’s last systems development as it happened, and interviewed many of the executives and technical personnel involved. Jones interviewed American and Japanese participants in the development of MOS and CMOS transistors, liquid-crystal displays, charge-coupled devices, light-emitting diodes, solar cells, and music synthesizers to explain why the United States’ leading electronics corporations invented these technologies and why Japanese companies turned them into consumer products. His answer suggests that the Japanese innovated successfully not because of industry-government collaboration, but from individual philosophies similar to David Sarnoff’s. Brinkley traces with a journalist’s cynicism the political and corporate scheming as well as the technical challenges involved in developing American HDTV within an international consortium, of which Sarnoff Corporation was a part. Buderi examines the transition in the nature of corporate research at the end of the 20th century within the context of the technological and stock-market euphoria of 1998-2000.\n\nBack To Top\n\nLinks\n\nThe David Sarnoff Library makes no representations whatsoever about any other web site which you may access from its site.

Aided by the collectors’ network, Edward H. Reitan, Jr., has developed The Following Program . . ., documenting extensively the early development of color television. Those collectors have also organized the Early Television Foundation which offers views of an enormous variety of rare and vanished cameras, transmission equipment, and receivers, or sets. A growing collection of material on Vladimir Zworykin, including photos of television R&D in Camden from 1933 to 1940, a brief history of the period, and his obituary, are online at The Restelli Collection. Read Donald G. Fink’s 1981 article on the development of the National Television Standards Committee and how it developed first American monochrome and then color television standards from the 1930s through the 1950s.

The Discovery of the Transistor offers images and histories of the early versions of the transistor and the companies that made them.\n\nBack To Top\n\nComputers\n\n“John W. Mauchly and the Development of the ENIAC Computer” is thoroughly documented exhibit from the University of Pennsylvania Library’s Department of Special Collections. The Computer Museum at Ames Air Force Base, California, offers an impressive site of histories, images, and interactive demonstrations of computing techniques.\n\nBack To Top\n\nSources for Research and Scholarship\n\nThe Hagley Museum and Library recovered most of the technical files—reports and memoranda–and some historical materials from the RCA Camden library in 1992. The site features an excellent online catalog of the Hagley’s holdings, which contain far more in business and advertising history than RCA. The Archives Center at the National Museum of American History holds the George Clark Radioana collection, as well as the Western Union archives and an immense set of oral histories relating to the history of computing. Descriptions and finding aids are available on-line.\n\nThe U. S. Patent Office has an index page offering the patent collections of Guglielmo Marconi and Philo Farnsworth, among others.\n\nA useful source for broadcast media history can be found at the Library of American Broadcasting in College Park, Maryland, which includes the Broadcast Pioneers Library and much NBC material. It too has an excellent online catalog. The State Historical Society of Wisconsin has a Mass Communications collection including significant NBC holdings which are partly searchable through a telnet connection. You should also visit the Library of Congress Motion Picture and Television Reading Room and especially the NBC Resources Held by The Recorded Sound Section. For television programming, search the immense collections at the UCLA Film and Television Archive and the Museum of Broadcast Communications Archives.\n\nSiliconBase at Stanford University is the site for research and discussion of the history and culture of digital society, providing archives, articles, and forums. The Center for the History of Physics provides an archival repository, a search engine and on-line catalogs, and on-line exhibits.\n\nQuestions? Comments? Suggestions? Information?
