        "text": "Guglielmo Marconi was an Italian scientist and inventor. He built the first wireless telegraph, which sent messages through the air for the first time. This invention was the starting point for radio.\n\nMarconi was born on April 25, 1874, in Bologna, Italy. At about age 20 he became interested in radio waves. Radio waves are streams of energy that carry electric signals through the air. Marconi thought that radio waves could be used in communication.\n\nMarconi experimented with radio waves and the telegraph. The telegraph used at the time could send and receive coded messages in the form of electric signals. However, it needed wires to do so. Marconi created a telegraph that could send electric signals using radio waves. The signals traveled through the air instead of through wires. In 1897 he formed a wireless telegraph business in England. It made him rich.\n\nIn 1901 Marconi sent radio signals across the Atlantic Ocean for the first time. Some scientists had thought this could not be done. They believed that radio waves traveled in straight lines. As Earth’s surface curved, they said, the waves would go out into space. Marconi believed that the long waves he used would follow Earth’s curve. He was right.\n\nMarconi’s wireless telegraph sent messages in the form of coded clicks, like earlier telegraphs did. Then other scientists added their inventions to it. The new devices could also send voices and music."
