        "text": "We regret to announce the death of Senator Marconi in Rome yesterday at the age of 63.\n\nHis illness began only on Monday, but his condition became serious early yesterday morning, and he died within a few hours of paralysis of the heart. The Marchesa Marconi and her daughter were away from Rome, and the Marchesa was not able to return to Rome until three hours after her husband's death. Yesterday was the girl's birthday.\n\nRome had many flags at half-mast, and the shops in the Via Condotti, the street in which Senator Marconi lived, were nearly all closed and bore the sign \"Closed for national mourning.\"\n\nA State funeral will take place this evening at the Church of St. Mary of the Angels. Senator Marconi's remains will be taken to Bologna, his birthplace, for burial.\n\nAt six o'clock to-night, the hour fixed for the funeral, all B.B.C. transmitters and all the Post Office wireless telegraph and wireless telephone stations in the British Isles will close down for two minutes.\n\nThe Post Office has sent the following message to all ships: \"As a token to the late Marchese Marconi, all stations are asked to stop transmitting between 17.00 and 17.02 G.M.T., July 21, except in cases of extreme urgency.\"\n\nThe Postmaster General's announcement of this tribute to Marconi adds: \"Rugby, the most powerful wireless station in the world, which links the British Empire by radio telephone, will pay this mark of respect as well as the Post Office coast wireless stations which maintain communication with ships on the seven seas.\"\n\nLeader: Throughout the ages men have been inspired by the vision of a world without barriers, a federation of mankind. No man has done more to give reality and substance to that dream than Guglielmo Marconi, the father of wireless communication.\n\nThe principle on which his discoveries were based was already known when he was still a child but it was he who realised its commercial possibilities, applied it to the service of society, and transformed a laboratory curiosity into a world force of incalculable power.\n\nWe may well be proud that he came to England to carry out the researches which enabled him, forty years ago, to send the first telegraphic messages through the ether for a few hundred yards and, five years later, across the Atlantic. Within ten years radio distress signals had saved the lives of many shipwrecked seamen, and a thousand passengers rescued from the foundering Titanic impressively acknowledged that they owed their lives to him."
