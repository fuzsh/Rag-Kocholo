Click to download the free sample version Download sample\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGuglielmo Marconi was an Italian electrical engineer and inventor known for his contributions in long-distance radio transmission, his Marconi’s law, and his radio telegraph system.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information on the Guglielmo Marconi or alternatively, you can download our 22-page Guglielmo Marconi worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nEARLY LIFE AND EDUCATION\n\nGuglielmo Marconi was born as Guglielmo Giovanni Maria Marconi on April 25, 1874, in Bologna, Italy.\n\nMarconi was the second son of Giuseppe Marconi, an Italian aristocratic landowner from Porretta Terme, and Annie Jameson, daughter of Andrew Jameson from Daphne Castle in Ireland. She was also the granddaughter of John Jameson, who founded the Jameson & Sons whiskey distillers.\n\nMarconi’s brother, Alfonso, was an Italian businessman and stringed instruments collector who is also known for assisting his brother in his works regarding long-distance radio transmission.\n\nMarconi had a stepbrother named Luigi.\n\nMarconi did not receive any form of formal education. Instead, he studied chemistry, physics, and math from private tutors hired by his parents.\n\nOne of the most notable tutors that taught Marconi is Vincenzo Rosa, who was a high school physics teacher in Livorno.\n\nRosa taught Marconi the basics of physical phenomena and the theories on electricity.\n\nAt the age of 18, Augusto Righi, who was a physicist at the University of Bologna, became acquainted with Marconi. Righi allowed Marconi to attend lectures at the university and to use the university’s laboratory and library.\n\nCAREER\n\nIn the early 1890s, Marconi started working on his idea of “wireless telegraph”.\n\nAt the age of 20, Marconi started conducting experiments in radio waves.\n\nMarconi used the original experiments of Hertz as his basis and took note of Righi’s suggestion on using a coherer, which is a form of radio signal detector.\n\nIn the summer of 1894, Marconi had built a storm alarm made up of battery, a coherer, and an electric bell. The storm alarm works by picking up radio waves generated by lightning.\n\nIn December 1894, Marconi demonstrated a radio transmitter and receiver to his mother. This work of Marconi involved a bell on the other side of the room, which rings by pushing a telegraphic button on a bench.\n\nAfter further research, Marconi came up with a functional system with the following components: a simple oscillator or spark-producing radio transmitter; a wire or metal sheet capacity area suspended at a height above the ground; a coherer receiver; a telegraph key; and a telegraph register activated by the coherer.\n\nIn the summer of 1895, Marconi found that a much greater range could be achieved after raising the height of his antenna and by grounding his transmitter and receiver.\n\nThe improved system was capable of transmitting signals up to\n\n2 miles and over hills.\n\nThe monopole antenna reduced the frequency of the waves compared to the dipole antennas used by Hertz, which radiated vertically polarized radio waves that could travel longer distances.\n\nIn July 1896, Marconi presented his system to the British government.\n\nOn May 13, 1897, Marconi demonstrated his first wireless communication over open sea by transmitting a message over the Bristol Channel from Flat Holm Island to Lavernock Point in Penarth, which was a distance of 6 kilometers.\n\nImpressed, William Preece introduced Marconi’s work to the general public at two London lectures: Telegraphy without Wires, on December 11, 1896, at the Toynbee Hall; and Signalling through Space without Wires, on June 4, 1897, at the Royal Institution.\n\nLater on, Marconi and his cousin, Jameson Davis, formed the Wireless Telegraph and Signal Company, Ltd., which changed to Marconi’s Wireless Telegraph Company, Ltd. in 1900.\n\nIn September 1899, Marconi equipped two American ships with his systems for them to report to newspapers in New York City the progress of the yacht race for the America’s Cup.\n\nIn December 1901, Marconi was able to transmit signals across the Atlantic Ocean from Poldhu in Cornwall, England, to St. John’s in Newfoundland.\n\nThis achievement of Marconi was the starting point of the wide development of radio communications.\n\nIn 1902, Marconi filed a patent for the magnetic detector, in which the magnetization in a moving band of iron wire is changed by the arrival of a signal causing a click in the telephone receiver that is connected to it.\n\nThree years later, Marconi filed for another patent for the horizontal directional aerial.\n\nIn 1932, Marconi installed a radiotelephone system that transmits signals between the Castel Gandolfo, the pope’s palace, and Vatican City.\n\nPERSONAL LIFE\n\nMarconi married Beatrice O’Brien on March 16, 1905.\n\nThe two had three daughters – Degna, born in 1908; Gioia, born in 1916; and Lucia, who was born and died in 1906.\n\nThe two also had a son named Giulio.\n\nOn February 12, 1924, Marconi and Beatrice divorced.\n\nMarconi later married Maria Cristina Bezzi-Scali on June 12, 1927, and the two had a daughter named Maria Elettra Elena Anna. She was born in 1930 and later married Prince Carlo Giovannelli.\n\nWhile helping in the development of microwave technology, Marconi suffered nine heart attacks in the span of 3 years.\n\nOn July 20, 1937, Marconi died from a heart attack in Rome.\n\nGuglielmo Marconi Worksheets\n\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about the Guglielmo Marconi across 22 in-depth pages.
