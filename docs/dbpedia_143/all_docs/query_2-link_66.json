Of course, it involves entering a 16-digit code...\n\nWhat do I need to get Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp items in Animal Crossing: New Horizons?\n\nYou will need:\n\nyour iOS or Android device (obviously) with Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp installed\n\nyour Switch with Animal Crossing: New Horizons.\n\nan internet connection\n\nboth Pocket Camp and New Horizons must be linked to the same Nintendo Account\n\nWhat Pocket Camp items will I get in New Horizons?\n\nThere are a variety of in-game items available and you'll also get 50 Leaf Tickets to use in Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp.\n\nStep-by-Step guide - How to get Animal Cross Pocket Camp items in Animal Crossing: New Horizons\n\nFirstly, fire up Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp on your phone or smart device.\n\nTap 'My Nintendo' from the in-game menu (it's in the lower right corner of the screen, just above 'Social'). If this is your first time playing Pocket Camp, you'll have to complete the tutorial and get far enough through the game to visit recreation spots and design your own campsite.\n\nIf you haven't linked Pocket Camp to your Nintendo Account yet, you'll have to do so. It's simple enough: tap Create/Link Nintendo Account, and then selecting Create New Account. If your Nintendo Account is linked already, move to step 4\n\nOpen the 'My Nintendo' from step 1 again, find a reward called 'Animal Crossing: New Horizons Special Order Ticket + 50 Leaf Tickets' and tap it.\n\nYou should now see a 16-digit download code which you'll use to get the items in New Horizons. Write it down, screengrab it or just leave the game running while you fetch your Switch. 50 Leaf Tickets will automatically be added to your Pocket Camp mailbox (in the menu) and don't worry if you accidentally close the app before noting the code - you can find it again via the 'My Nintendo' rewards screen.\n\nOn your Switch head to the Nintendo eShop. Remember to use the same Nintendo Account you use to play Pocket Camp.\n\nHit 'Enter Code' on the bottom left corner of the screen. You probably know what to do now...\n\nOnce you've entered the code, close the eShop and fire up Animal Crossing: New Horizons (make sure you've downloaded the Day 1 patch).\n\nPay a visit to the Nook Stop. If you don't have access to Nook Stop, you'll have to play a little bit, but you'll soon encounter it.\n\nThat's it! You can now get your chubby round hands on those shiny Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp items by ordering them through Promotions in Nook Shopping.\n\nLet us know how you're enjoying your items below, and have fun on your desert island!\n\nThis article is part of our Animal Crossing: New Horizons walkthrough, which includes a Complete Fish List, Complete Bug List and Complete Sea Creatures List. If you're looking for specific fish or bugs, we can tell you how to catch the elusive Coelacanth, Mahi-Mahi, Giant Trevally, Stringfish, Golden Trout and all the Sharks and Beetles, along with a full list of critters leaving at the end of the month (unless you visit Kapp'n's Boat Tour islands, of course!).\n\nWe can also help with How to Spot Redd's Fake Paintings and Statues, How to Make Bells Fast, How to Breed Flowers, How to Get more DIY Recipes, How to Upgrade Nook's Cranny, where and when to find special characters like Gulliver, Sable, Label, Wisp, Celeste, Pirate Gulliver and Jack, plus tips on using the Star Wand, Tool Ring, Rock Trick, Cutting Down and Moving Trees, using amiibo on Harv's Island, How to Back Up Your Island Data, How to Time Travel, How to Get a 5-Star Island Rating and a whole lot more.\n\nIf it's new content you're looking for help with, we can help you find gyroids, unlock Brewster's café, use the new Pro Camera App for selfies, enact new ordinances, get the beloved Froggy Chair, and even learn How to Cook.\n\nAnd finally, Where to Buy Animal Crossing: New Horizons on Nintendo Switch, if for some reason you haven't yet picked up the game, and How To Buy The Happy Home Paradise DLC, too!\n\n[source ac-pocketcamp.com]"
