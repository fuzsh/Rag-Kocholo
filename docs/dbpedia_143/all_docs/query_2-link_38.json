        "text": "Wolf Link • Gallery\n\n“Huh... Feels nice to have Midna off my back for once...”\n\n― Wolf Link, New Leaf\n\nWolf Link (ウルフリンク, Urufu Rinku?) (abbreviated W. Link) is a smug wolf villager from the Animal Crossing series, introduced in the Welcome amiibo update. Wolf Link appears in the campground when a Link, Princess Zelda, or Wolf Link amiibo is scanned in the game, and can even be invited to live in the player's town. His birthday is the same day that The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, his debut game, first released for the Wii on November 19, 2006 and for the Nintendo GameCube on December 2, 2006.\n\nAlong with other RV-exclusive villagers, Wolf Link can't be invited to the town if their own house is still present in the town. Once they have packed boxes and left, they may be \"adopted\" again.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nWolf Link is a stylized wolf villager designed to resemble the appearance of Link's wolf form in The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. In coloration he is moss green overall with white underparts and paws above. He has blue eyes. His forehead is marked with ornate white symbols, and the inner portion of his mane is highlighted in tan. His left paw holds a bracelet resembling a chain.\n\nPersonality\n\nBelow is a brief description of the smug personality. For more information, click here.\n\nSmug villagers are very polite, kind, and gentleman-like. As a smug villager, Wolf Link will get along easily with other villagers. Smug villagers get along well with most villagers, their personality appearing to be a mix of the other personality types. Smug villagers will stroke their egos from time to time, going on about how cool they are.\n\nGenerally, Wolf Link will get along with lazy, normal, snooty, and peppy villagers, and may conflict with cranky villagers.\n\nHouse[]\n\nHis house is similar to a prison where he was retrieved from The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. In the exterior, it has a emerald green roof with yellow overalls, blue wood and a metal square arched door with a fancy fence. He does not have a stereo; however, if he obtains one, he will play K.K. Western.\n\nNew Leaf (interior) New Leaf (exterior)\n\nMobile Home[]\n\nInterior Exterior\n\namiibo[]\n\nThere is no such amiibo card for Wolf Link. The only way to get him is by using a Link, Wolf Link, or Zelda amiibo. Then the player must invite him to their town and then ask him to move in. If the player's town has 10 villagers living there, they must choose who is going to leave town by dawn of the next day. After that, two or three days must be waited for his arrival.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nHis birthday is on December 2, the same day The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess was released for the Nintendo Gamecube on December 2, 2006.\n\nHe also happens to share this birthday with the snooty horse Annalise.\n\nDespite Link's stoic, silent personality in The Legend of Zelda series, Wolf Link was given the smug personality, one of the most expressive in the series.\n\nHis selection about coffee is inferred from the Mountains of Hyrule and the bottles of milk found in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.\n\nIn New Leaf on Halloween, Wolf Link and Kyle are the only male wolves to not be afraid of the werewolf hood, since they are both afraid of the skeleton hood.\n\nThe fear of the skeleton hood for Wolf Link may stem from dungeon encounters with skeletal enemies known as Stalfos from The Legend of Zelda game series.\n\nHis favorite song, K.K. Western, may have been chosen due to it sounding rather similar to the theme for Hidden Village, a song from The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (The game which Wolf Link comes from).\n\nHe is one of the neighbors along with the Splatoon, Monster Hunter, and the other Zelda villagers who are not available in New Horizons.\n\nHe is the only smug villager to be cut off from New Horizons.\n\nIn other languages[]\n\nWolf Link\n\nLanguage Name Translation Japanese ウルフリンク urufurinku, Wolf Link - French Link l. - Spanish Link L. - German W. Link - Italian Link l. - Korean 울프 링크 ulpeu lingkeu, Wolf Link -\n\nv · WolvesSee alsoVillagers"
