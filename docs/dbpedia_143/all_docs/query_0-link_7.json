However, what I want to know is this -- if I do not own New Horizons (say another family members owns it on their account on my Switch), but own Nintendo Switch Online, can I access online functions? And for other members on the island, can they use my Nintendo Switch Online capabilities if they neither own AC:NH or Nintendo Switch Online?"
