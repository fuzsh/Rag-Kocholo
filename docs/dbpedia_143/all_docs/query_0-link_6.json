First animal Crossing btw.\n\nJuicy\n\nOpShaft 4 years ago#2\n\nYes.\n\nI lost the game.\n\nGuyFawkes5 4 years ago#3\n\nCorrect. It goes off of real life time.\n\nI was reborn in the fire of a muzzle flash.\n\nBlueDsc 4 years ago#4\n\nYip, Animal Crossing runs in real time.\n\nNGW 4 years ago#5\n\nThe series was built on the premise of real time gameplay. Yes, you have to wait, try and be patient though, this isn't the kind of game you're ever in any rush in. Just relax, take it slow and enjoy it. While many, myself included, can spend hours catching fish and bugs to sell for money or planning and decorating the island, generally you pop in the game and play in little bursts here and there depending on what you want to do and check in at least once a day for new stuff like upgrades, new shop items, events, etc.\n\nGP Vs 2016: Second Place Winner\n\nPSN: ourtheNGW | Nintendo Switch: SW-1891-6374-1416\n\nBaha05 4 years ago#6\n\nKinda sort of. I am never that awake to see it happen but I believe 5 or 6 AM is technically the tart of the new day for the game so if you plopped that sucker down at say 6 PM it's going to be up and running in the morning.\n\n\"Abbreviating \"laughing out loud\" is a common troll trait.\" AzureHero\n\nMirageMew2 4 years ago#7\n\nAlternatively you can just fix your system clock a day forward, load it up so it’s built, then go back a day so you can enjoy your newly built home and museum at your pace.\n\nSW-4741-1296-0325 || NP: The Finals, Pokemon Violet, PalWorld\n\nNGW 4 years ago#8\n\nMirageMew2 posted...\n\nAlternatively you can just fix your system clock a day forward, load it up so it’s built, then go back a day so you can enjoy your newly built home and museum at your pace.\n\nLet's not encourage new players to cheat and time travel, encourage them to play as intended first.\n\nGP Vs 2016: Second Place Winner\n\nPSN: ourtheNGW | Nintendo Switch: SW-1891-6374-1416\n\nBlueDsc 4 years ago#9\n\nthe_NGW posted...\n\nLet's not encourage new players to cheat and time travel, encourage them to play as intended first.\n\nOr they could just play in whatever way has them enjoy the game most."
