        "text": "Billund – October 10th, 2023 - Today, the LEGO Group reveals brand-new LEGO® Animal Crossing™ sets, inspired by the popular video game series from Nintendo.\n\nMillions of people have found their happy place while playing Animal Crossing™. Now for the first time, that world is coming to LEGO brick form.\n\nThe five new play experiences, created in partnership with Nintendo, allow LEGO builders to explore the world and characters from the video games, and play out different stories in the brick-built landscape.\n\nThe sets have been developed to fit together easily and offer a high level of customization, for instance it’s possible to switch elements between buildings – including the window frames - with one simple click. All sets can be adapted, mixed, and changed, enabling builders to create their own worlds and make the settings unique to them.\n\nBuilders aged 6+ can get creative and imaginative by bringing their favourite scenes and characters to life in the physical world with LEGO Animal Crossing. The new range will include build experiences such as:\n\nJulian’s Birthday Party, where builders can celebrate with Julian, share cupcakes, and open presents.\n\nBunnie’s Outdoor Activities allows enthusiasts of the great outdoors to roleplay setting up a tent, roasting marshmallows or using the vaulting pole to jump across the water, and grab the shovel or other recognizable tools from the video game series.\n\nKapp’n’s Island Boat Tour gives fans the opportunity to board the boat and explore another island with Kapp’n and Marshal, go on an adventure to search for coconuts and bamboo, discover wildlife, hermit crabs, and fish or simply hang out and enjoy the fire.\n\nIsabelle’s House Visit allows builders to get creative and help Isabelle and Fauna customize Fauna's house and enjoy activities like opening the balloon present, crafting tools, or picking fruits and flowers.\n\nNook’s Cranny & Rosie’s House gives builders two locations where they can roleplay stocking up Nook's Cranny shop or go to Rosie’s house for freshly baked cookies.\n\n“To us, Animal Crossing is all about creativity and roleplay, so bringing that to life in physical form using LEGO bricks and creating new minifigures has been fun for the team” said Simon Kent, Creative Lead, Design Director at the LEGO Group. \"One of the challenges was to make sure that customization of the sets was simple so builders could experience the freedom they have in the game. Additionally, creating the minifigures to make sure they were accurately representing the characters in the video games was very important for us. We look forward to giving kids the opportunity to play with their favourite characters from Animal Crossing!”\n\n“The Animal Crossing video game series is about creating a world where you freely build the life you want, and now with LEGO bricks, you can build that world with your own hands in the real world too” said Aya Kyogoku, Game Producer of Nintendo Co., Ltd. “Putting the sets together is only the beginning. Kids can use the furniture, plants, and more, included with each set, to customize them or even combine multiple sets to create their own village. There are so many different ways kids will be able to express their creativity based on what they like, which can evolve as they grow. We hope that the world of Animal Crossing and its characters, now also in the form of LEGO bricks, can bring smiles to people's faces by being a part of their day-to-day lives.”\n\nSince its first release in 2001, Animal Crossing continues to be one of the most popular franchises on Nintendo platforms.\n\nThe new LEGO Animal Crossing sets will be available globally via LEGO Stores, all retailers and on www.LEGO.com from March 1st, 2024.\n\nFor more information, contact media@lego.com\n\nProduct info\n\nLEGO® Animal Crossing™ Isabelle’s House Visit (77049)\n\nPieces: 389\n\nAges: 6+\n\nMeasures over 6.5 in.
