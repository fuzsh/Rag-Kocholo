        "text": "Summary\n\nOne Reddit user finally found the halo after not seeing it in Animal Crossing for 10 years.\n\nPlayers have plenty of hacks and resources to find their desired items, but many prefer to enjoy the game's vanilla experience.\n\nNook's Cranny and the Able Sisters shops use RNG to determine the items available every day.\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons is only the latest installment in the long-running popular Nintendo franchise. Though the newest title became exponentially popular, longtime fans have their own opinions about which Animal Crossing game is the best – but that hasn't stopped New Horizons from giving some just the right amount of nostalgia. Thanks to the game's consistent premise and ever-expanding selection of items, one user was able to accomplish a 10-year hunt.\n\nReddit user No_Law6676 shared a heartfelt story in their post about the halo item that's often found in the Able Sisters' shop. In the post, they reminisced on finding the item for the first time when playing City Folk with their cousins. \"We decided we wanted apples as our native fruit so we spent an entire afternoon resetting over and over to get the apples,\" they recounted. But in one of their attempts, they walked into the Able Sisters' shop to see the halo item on display.\n\n\"In one of the attempts to get apples, Able Sisters had this halo item I had never seen before in my original city and I FELL IN LOVE with it,\" they continued. \"Still, we haven’t gotten apples yet. So we had to reset again.\" After 10 years of looking for the item in all of their subsequent save files, they finally found it in the sisters' shop in their New Horizons save file.\n\nThe Able Sisters Have A Rotating Random Stock\n\nThe Halo Was Introduced In Wild World\n\nThose who choose not to time travel in their Animal Crossing save files have to put some trust in RNG when looking for specific items to buy from any of the shops available on their island. Of the nearly 250 clothing items and 2,000 furniture items available for players to purchase with their bells, they have little control over what ones will show up in Nook's Cranny or the Able Sisters.\n\nWith New Horizons, players found plenty of ways to gain access to the items they wanted without leaving it to chance. Between Facebook groups, dedicated Animal Crossing site Nookazon, and hacked treasure islands, players have more opportunities to find their desired items than in the franchise's previous installments. But these hacks require a Nintendo Online account, and for some players, utilizing them takes away some of the game's charm.\n\nThe halo clothing accessory was introduced during Animal Crossing: Wild World, which was released in 2005. It's been a part of the game ever since, but as there's no way to control what items show up in the shops day-to-day, it's not unusual for the OP to have not seen the item since. Thankfully, their character can now proudly walk around their Animal Crossing: New Horizons island, halo above their head, feeling satisfied that they didn't use cheats to get it."
