        "text": "The_Sacred_Buns 7 years ago#1\n\nWas just wondering what exactly does it do? I mean I know it unlocks HHD giant items for purchase in NL. But apparently it's a one time deal so it just reads the game and then unlocks all of the available items? Just wondering if it'll continue to update more as I progress in HHD? I just bought HHD yesterday so there wasn't much unlocked in that game.\n\n46-12-25\n\n3DS FC: 4141-5773-3886\n\nFox5409 7 years ago#2\n\nTo my knowledge it just unlocks the giant items in the catalog and mails you a house model. I don't think progressing in HHD unlocks anything further, the link option is gone from my title screen and I didn't get too far in HHD."
