        "text": "OfficialPotato 4 years ago#1\n\nAs you may have guessed by the title, this will be my first Animal Crossing game. However, I'm unsure of whether this one will be beginner friendly when it comes to plot and lore. Will I need any knowledge about the lore of the previous games to understand the story of this one, or will I be able to jump right in? I know there's some recurring characters like Isabelle and the tanooki fella, so I can never be too sure.\n\nCheers and thanks in advance.\n\nMothership1953 4 years ago#2\n\nNo...you'll be fine starting with this one\n\nIGN is Natalie\n\nValharke 4 years ago#3\n\nThere's not really anything to understand. There's not so much a story as a scenario to provide basic context for the gameplay.\n\nTedmastr 4 years ago#4\n\nAnimal Crossing doesn’t have much in the way of a story, so you should be fine. There may be references to returning characters, but those aren’t too important, and a lot of those you can infer pretty easily anyway.\n\nEssentually, the plot of every Animal Crossing game goes something like this: each game, you decide to go out on your own and make your way in the world. You move to a town inhabited by animals (you’re the only human) with no assets, and Tom Nook sets you up with a house and a loan. Progression essentially means paying off your home loan (think of it as a zero-interest mortgage), expanding your home, collecting lots of stuff, getting to know the animals in your town, and simply enjoying every day life. Newer games allow more customization/options (e.g., in the 3DS entry, the first player is mistaken for the arriving mayor, and can plan and commission projects for the town, like fountains, etc., and this new game seems to allow a lot of island customization), but there’s not much continuity from one game to the next besides returning characters.\n\nAnimal Crossing is an unusual series in that I get the impression it has both a very casual following (including people who don’t play other games) and a harder-core, long-term fanbase (probably most people here fall into the latter category). It really is a very approachable, E for Everyone series, and it explains most of what you need to know fairly well as you go along.\n\nMain 3DS FC (Pokemon): 2466-2669-5197; ACNL 3DS FC: 3952-7603-8645\n\nIGN Teddy; TSV: 2442 (X); 0616 (Y); 3854 (OR); 1359 (AS)\n\nMahdioh 4 years ago#5\n\nThere is a certain degree of continuity in the series for the backstories of shopkeepers and other special characters, but there's not much lore outside of that from what I can remember. In the previous titles, these characters would eventually warm up to you and talk about their past if you interact with them enough, so I'm sure you won't feel as though you're missing out if this game follows suit. If you get curious about any character in particular, a quick read-through their short backstories on a wiki may be sufficient.\n\nIn my opinion, it should be totally fine to go in blind. None of the games really assume you know everything about the world beforehand, so I'm sure this game will fill you in on anything that isn't straightforward.\n\nIt's-a me!\n\nNintendo Fun Fact: The plural of Joy-Con is Joy-Con.\n\nKithran 4 years ago#6\n\nHonestly i envy you TC, the less knowledge you have in this series the more fun it is when you learn new things. There is 0 prior knowledge needed to enjoy the game.\n\nOfficialPotato (Topic Creator)4 years ago#7\n\nAlright, cheers, you guys. Thanks for the swift responses. I appreciate it.\n\nwingblade98 4 years ago#8\n\nNo, but some characters have some backstory. e.g.\n\nLabel/Labelle (the purple abel sister) used to work in the city for Gracie (the fashion giraffe)\n\nLyle (otter) was a s***ty insurance/fraud salesman in Wild World, which is why he talks like one.\n\nhttps://rave.dj/frjBYiH6SqZ46g\n\nThe man in the pickle suit tricked me again\n\nXwendyX 4 years ago#9\n\nEveryone will be starting out not knowing what to expect ... even the Animal Crossing old timers.\n\nIt will be a new adventure for all of us to learn all about the island and what new things will happen.\n\nDupeTown (Giveaway) FC: 4399-5793-8875 - (dream 4E00 015F E683)\n\nNoWhere (weed town) FC:3153-7424-4880"
