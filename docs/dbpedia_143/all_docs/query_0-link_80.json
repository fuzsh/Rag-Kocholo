Animal Crossing is a series of life simulation games from Nintendo that lets players build their own existence in a world full of colourful inhabitants.\n\nA UNIQUE COLLABORATION\n\nThe popular life simulation game Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which has already entertained more than 45 million* players since its launch in March 2020, is joining forces with SEA LIFE for an immersive experience in Belgium. This collaboration lets visitors discover marine life through the eyes of several iconic characters from the game.\n\nACTIVITIES AND ENCOUNTERS\n\nGuided by an excursion guide booklet, visitors can explore the Sea Life Islands, meet Tom Nook and other islanders, including Aurora and Octavian, and discover many sea creatures. They can also search for Gulliver, who washed up somewhere on the beaches at SEA LIFE.\n\nVisitors can collect stamps, given to them by the residents of SEA LIFE Islands, and come face to face with the one and only mascot Tom Nook! At the end of their visit, fans can purchase merchandise from Animal Crossing: New Horizons at the aquarium's shop.\n\nThe Animal Crossing: New Horizons activities can be experienced at SEA LIFE Blankenberge from 10 July to 31 August."
