        "text": "This page is part of IGN's Animal Crossing: New Horizons Wiki guide and details everything you need to know about accessing and using the Happy Home Network App to share and view vacation home designs, as well as Facility designs, with players all over the world. The Happy Home Network App is part of the paid DLC update, Happy Home Paradise.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nWhat is the Happy Home Network App and How to Use It\n\nVacation homes that you design can be captured in photos as design samples, which are then recorded in the Paradise Planning portfolio. After designing your second home, you'll be asked to take a photo with the client and can pose them or yourself. Niko will inform the client of the design portfolio Paradise Planning uses to show off their work and ask to include it.\n\nWhile taking the photo, you can also enter Matching Mode and match clothes with the client. Select the villager's clothing then choose Matching Mode to make your outfit the same as well.\n\nTo view the portfolio any time, open the menu on your phone and navigate to the Happy Home Network application in the bottom right corner.\n\nHow to Share and View Designs on Happy Home Network App\n\nWhen using the Happy Home Network application, you can visit previous clients' homes and catch up on how they're doing following your makeover. After taking and uploading your first photo, Lottie will invite you to visit Eloise, your first client, to do just that.\n\nNote that you must be on the archipelago to visit clients, and while you can view photos on the HHN app from your home island, you can't make visits from there.\n\nThat's not all though! With an active online subscription, you'll have the ability to connect the Happy Home Network online. Here, you can share and view Vacation Home designs and Facility designs from ACNH players all over the world and follow other designers that may inspire you.\n\nOnce you have found a design you like, click on it and select Tour, where you'll then have the chance to take an in-person look at their designs and hopefully spark some inspiration of your own.\n\nLooking for even more on the ACNH paid DLC update?
