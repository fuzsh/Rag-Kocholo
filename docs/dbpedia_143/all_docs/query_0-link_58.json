        "text": "I have tried the few apps for AC:NH out there and this one definitely is by far the superior choice! I even bought the guide and found this app to be so much easier and more user friendly. I use it to keep track of everything and even customized certain things to remember to do daily. I love knowing I have all the variants of an item and what song I need KK to play me and even when the last time Redd was there. How do I get purple hyacinths? Let me check my flower guide! Do I have the recipe for the Golden Dung Beetle? Let me look up my registered recipes! When and where can I catch a Barreleye and how much are they worth? Oh and did I donate one yet to the museum? LET ME CHECK MY AWESOME APP!! Or even when talking to a friend âHey do you have any Rattan items?â Oh but Iâm not on my game but LET ME CHECK MY INCREDIBLE APP! Seriously I was so skeptical because the others were obviously not all inclusive. This one is not only thorough, it updates with the new game features and characters and items as we go! I have sent everyone I know the message to get this app ASAP because it is phenomenal! I canât sing itâs praises enough!! The only app I use more than this one is Netflix. Seriously this app is so amazing!!\n\nThis app is amazing! It updates as the game updates, itâs smooth and reliable. My absolute favorite app to have in hand while I play. I personally love that you can edit the home screen to determine what YOU want to keep track of daily. Itâs got small icons for just about everything so you can tell what it is at a glance. (I.e. talking to sable or collecting the furniture that falls from trees) They just updated it with the weekly visits from other characters so now I can track when flick/Redd/Sahara etc. pop by! They also just added lists, right now only a wishlist is available for editing but that alone kept me busy for a few hours....and donât get me started on the items list which they just expanded ð took me hours to finish my wishlist. I think my review is a mess but it really is the most convenient and well put together app and I personally did compare it to a couple others when I would see people on Instagram show what they would use. This one, although I personally think thereâs one other that looks more aesthetically pleasing, is the absolute best and I hope they keep up the amazing work!\n\nI love this app! It helps me keep track of museum stuff, which villagers Iâve talked to, mystery islands, etc. It also lets you keep track of how many rocks you hit, if you got the message in a bottle, and the three DIY recipes you can get a day from your villagers. It also has a database where you can search for like literally anything (villagers, items, critters, DIYs, Art, etc.) You can log stuff you have caught or bought and donated. Even cooler, you can sync it with your islands time and it will show you what critters might be found on your island right then. For those who love making bells, it has a super cool turnip tracker that allows you to track the buy price and the sell prices throughout the week. There is also a calculator that then uses that data to calculate the odds of what prices might be found on a certain day. The more data you enter, the better it works. I used to never buy turnips because they would stress me out, but this has made it so much easier and almost guarantees a profit. I would definitely recommend this app if you love abs obsessive play ACNH like I do."
