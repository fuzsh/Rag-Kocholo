        "text": "​A Safe Passage\n\n​Wildlife including mule deer, elk and bear are now able to safely cross a busy highway in Colorado thanks to a transportation solution designed to help protect wildlife and motorists from highway collisions.\n\nIn 2016, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), in cooperation with Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) and many other partners, completed Colorado’s first-of-its-kind wildlife overpass and underpass system on Highway 9 between Green Mountain Reservoir and Kremmling. This innovative solution to keeping wildlife off a busy road resulted in a 90 percent reduction in wildlife-vehicle collisions.\n\nThe nearly 11-mile stretch of road bisects important wildlife habitat and movement corridors, specifically​, mule deer and elk winter range. Prior to the project, an average of 63 wildlife carcasses were recorded along this stretch of road each winter, 98 percent of which were mule deer. According to CDOT, wildlife-vehicle collisions accounted for 35 percent of all reported crash types from 2007-2011. The Highway 9 wildlife safety improvement project was designed to improve driver safety while maintaining connectivity of wildlife movement across the road."
