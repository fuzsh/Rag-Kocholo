        "text": "Animal Crossing: New Horizons now has a dream feature, allowing players to visit other islands without having to go to the airport. The other player doesn’t even need to be online. (To use dreams, you’ll need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.)\n\nThat said, you won’t be able to buy any items or pick any fruits if you’re visiting via a dream. This is mostly just to make it easier to share your creative vision with others. As an added bonus, it lets you invite people in without any fear of them trashing your place or stomping your flowers.\n\nLuna, a tapir, will aid you in your sleep.\n\nHow to upload your island\n\nWhen your lay in a bed in your house, it’ll ask if you want to sleep. Say yes, and you’ll see Luna, who will offer to help you out. To upload your island, tell her “I’d like to share a dream.”\n\nAfter connecting to the internet, she’ll give you a Dream Address code to share that’ll represent your island. Your Dream Address will appear on your passport and on your map, so don’t stress about recording it when she tells you the code at first.\n\nNote that you can only upload your island once a day.\n\nHow to visit other islands using dreams\n\nAfter talking to Luna for the first time, you’ll be able to sleep at your house in any bed. Once you lay down, the game will ask if you want to dream. Select yes, and you’ll be enveloped in a purple fog before seeing Luna again. Tell her you “want to dream” and she’ll ask you for a Dream Address to enter. Once you input the island’s code, you’ll awake from your bed in front of the Resident Services of the island you chose to visit. As a reminder, you won’t be able to do much beyond taking in all the sights. But that’s fine!\n\nWhen you’re ready to go back to your own island, just lay back in the bed."
