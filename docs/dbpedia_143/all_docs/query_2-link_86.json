        "text": "Save data is tied to the Switch's built-in memory, and potentially cloud storage or SD card if you're using those. It doesn't matter which version you launch as they use the same save files.\n\nIt seems like you assume you bought \"another digital copy\" of animal crossing but that isn't really how it works. You bought an activation or \"license\" allowing you to play the game digitally, and you either have it or don't have it tied to your account. You already had it after buying it the first time so you are unable to get a 2nd license to play the game on separate systems on the same account.\n\nGoing forward you either have to unlink your account from his switch system and link the currently unused digital license of the game (he will of course need his own account to access online services however), or get a physical copy. In which case you will also have to be sure you are launching the game from the physical copy and not the digital one, I would just uninstall it first to be sure."
