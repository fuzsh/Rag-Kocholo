        "text": "About\n\nWhile the world was on pause, the island paradises of Animal Crossing: New Horizons thrived, welcoming those in isolation with open arms (and paws). The game became a routine part of everyday life. Cancelled plans were reimagined and reprogrammed to the virtual sandy shores of playersâ€™ islands. For many people unable to socialise in real life, the game became a vital creative space for personal connection."
