        "text": "This is a friendly dodocode/turnips exchange forum. To use this forum you would need to share your ACNH Dodo Code, to allow users to visit your island to have fun and explore the creations and imagination of others.\n\nWe want everyone to enjoy the game, and to get excited when the turnip prices are high, so you can get rid of them or when users are doing giveaways on their island, storytelling or playing games.\n\nCommonly asked questions\n\nExperiencing interference?\n\nThis usually means that another user is travelling to the island at the same time. Please wait a few minutes and then try to join again.\n\nWhat does FULL mean?\n\nWhen you see FULL on our website it means that the island is maxed out which means unless the owner of the island posts their dodo code again, you won't be able to visit that island. We do this because some users want to have only a couple of users on their island.\n\nWhat games can I create when I have vistors?\n\nHere are a few which we've come up with:\n\nBug off - Requires a timer.\n\nWho can catch the biggest fish - Requires a timer\n\nTreasure Hunt\n\nIsland Mazes\n\nHide and Seek\n\nNet hitting tag\n\nIs this a pitfall seed or an item?\n\nWhat should I do before opening my island in Animal Crossing: New Horizons?\n\nIf you have any items lying around on your island that you don't want visitors to take, make sure you pick them up and store them in your inventory. You could place a fence around these items.\n\nThe items which are affected are:\n\nItems that have been dropped and not placed. This includes fossils and DYI recipes.\n\nAll type of fruits (Apple, Cherry, Coconuts, Orange, Peach, Pear), including the fruit still hanging on trees.\n\nBells\n\nStar Fragments\n\nMake sure you shake your Hardwood or Cedar Tree so you can get the two daily items that are hidden on them - your visitors could get them before you!\n\nWhat can visitors do on other Animal Crossing: New Horizons islands?\n\nThey can:\n\nPlant flowers\n\nShake trees\n\nFish\n\nGo diving\n\nCatch bugs\n\nPluck and run over flowers\n\nDig fossils (only best friends)\n\nSet pitfall traps (only best friends)\n\nHere are some fun facts about NookFriends!\n\nOver 150,000+ Dodo codes have been posted on Nookfriends since launch.\n\nThis website is maintained by a couple that loves Animal Crossing: New Horizons."
