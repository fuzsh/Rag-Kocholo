        "text": "One of those dogs is Munah, pictured here, who is up for adoption. Unfortunately, Munah is also on the second list of “time-stamped” dogs, scheduled to be put down as early as tomorrow, May.13, 2024. Munah was given the highest, “white dog” rating by TAS’ trainer. She is sweet, social, and polite, and is good with people of all ages, including young children. Although she is not a particularly playful dog, Munah is a really good dog. She may even be great as a therapy dog!\n\nIt makes no sense that Munah may lose her life.\n\nHERE’S WHAT WE’RE DOING:\n\n(1) We’re reaching out to as many rescue organizations as possible. Because most rescues already have their hands full and are at capacity, we are asking them to “pull” just one dog from Trenton Animal Shelter. We’ll be available to give them assessment information on the dogs, so they can make the choice that’s right for them. In return for pulling a Trenton Shelter dog, we will make a $200-$250 donation to their rescue. For rescues a distance away, we will also offer to pay their transport fees.\n\nWe know from past initiatives that offering incentives like these makes their participation much more likely. While the responsibility of taking one dog should be relatively small for each rescue, the collective impact could be tremendous.\n\n(2) There are Pennsylvania rescues willing to pull dogs from Trenton Animal Shelter. However, because of the new PA dog law revision, any dog taken from the Trenton facility must be quarantined for 14 days. We are establishing relationships with veterinary and boarding facilities willing to participate for a reduced fee, and we will pay for the boarding costs.\n\nOf course, the Just One Dog campaign also extends to any of you who are considering dog adoption. Now is the time to adopt a dog from Trenton Animal Shelter!\n\nHOW YOU CAN HELP THE JUST ONE DOG CAMPAIGN:\n\nYou’ve already proven to be a compassionate and generous animal lover, someone who shares and supports our mission, so we wanted to approach you at this crucial time. Please consider making a tax-deductible donation to the Just One Dog campaign. Our goal is to raise $10,000. Your generosity is crucial to the campaign’s success.\n\nEvery minute counts. The first two lists of “time stamped” Trenton Animal Shelter dogs scheduled to be put down have already been released!. Please consider making a donation to this critically important campaign today.\n\nTo make a donation, just click the Donate button on the upper right-hand corner of this page. Then scroll down to “Saving Trenton Dogs” under “Use This Donation For”. Your donation will go directly into the dedicated Saving Trenton Dogs account.\n\nThank you in advance for your generosity. We couldn’t do this without you.\n\nPlease share this message with your fellow animal champions. Together, we can give these disregarded dogs the respect, compassion, and love they deserve"
