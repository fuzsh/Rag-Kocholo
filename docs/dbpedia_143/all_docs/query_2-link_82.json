As a thank you, I host the treasure islands 24/7 inside my Discord server in the members-only area. You can become a member of Pange Plays by either:\n\nBecome a discord subscribed member via mee6\n\nOR Subscribing on Pange Plays Twitch\n\nOR Become a Superfan Member on Pange Plays YouTube\n\nThen to access the 24/7 ACNH treasure islands join our Discord. If you subscribed on Twitch or became a YouTube superfan, you‚Äôll have to link your Discord account to the social service. If you subscribe on Discord via Mee6, login to my Discord server using the same Discord user account that you used to sign up.\n\nBy doing either of these three things, you can access the members only area to get my dodo codes any time, plus use my item spawner bots to drop items on request or inject adoptable villagers. For Twitch and YouTube integration, you‚Äôll need to link your Discord account to your Twitch or YouTube in your Discord account settings.\n\nRemember if you have Prime on Amazon, you get 1 free Twitch subscription every month!
