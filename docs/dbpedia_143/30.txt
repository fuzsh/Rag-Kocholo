This page lists websites for the Animal Crossing series, both official and unofficial.

Official[edit]

Websites[edit]

As Doubutsu no Mori, Doubutsu no Mori+, and Doubutsu no Mori e+ are Japan-only titles, they do not have official websites in other languages.

Nintendo of America[edit]

The official url for all North American releases is animal-crossing.com. Because of this many of the websites are no longer functional as information on the previous title was overwritten with each subsequent release. As the Wild World site was flash-based, archives of the site show a blank page; the UK site is a working alternative. The animal-crossing.com URL is included at the bottom of letters in Animal Crossing whenever the player orders an item from their catalog (see Crossing Guardian for more info). The original site was used to distribute otherwise unobtainable NES titles, a functionality not retained in the site's archived version.

Social media accounts[edit]

With the release of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Nintendo increased its social media presence. The tweets sent from the official Twitter accounts are written from Isabelle's perspective, though she was temporarily replaced or had a temporary co-host under Lottie during Happy Home Designer and Happy Home Paradise's promotional period and Tom Nook during New Horizons's promotional period. Each of the official Twitter accounts are all translations of the same message.
