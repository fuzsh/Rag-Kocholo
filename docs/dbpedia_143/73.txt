Welcome to Animal Crossing Community (or just ACC), your one-stop fan site for everything Animal Crossing. Discuss the games with fellow members, trade in-game items, show off your town, create patterns and town tunes, and so much more. You can also find comprehensive guides covering all of the games. No matter what you do, be sure to keep an eye out for Bells that you can redeem for prizes in the Bell Shop.

Once again, welcome to the community. We hope you enjoy everything we have to offer and that you make some great friends here!
