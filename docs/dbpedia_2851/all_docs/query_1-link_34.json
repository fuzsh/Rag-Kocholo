        "text": "A new MRT station, to be located within walking distance of the planned Founders’ Memorial at Marina Bay, will be added to the upcoming Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL).\n\nIn a press release on Monday (7 January), the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said the Founders’ Memorial station – which is its current working name – will be located between the TEL’s Tanjong Rhu and Gardens by the Bay stations.\n\nThe station will serve upcoming residential and recreational developments in the Marina Bay area. It will also improve accessibility for visitors to Bay East Garden, where the memorial will be located, said the LTA.\n\nIt added that the station will be built by converting the TEL facility building that is currently under construction at Bay East Garden into an MRT station. The roughly $242 million contract for the facility building’s construction was awarded to China Railway First Group in June 2016.\n\nWorks on the station will commence this year, with it expected to open in tandem with the Founders’ Memorial in 2025. The 5ha memorial site will include an indoor gallery with a garden.\n\nRelated stories:\n\nSingapore Founders’ Memorial to take five-hectare site at Bay East Garden"
