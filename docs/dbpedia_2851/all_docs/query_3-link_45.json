        "text": "If you’re visiting Singapore, you might want to consider taking a ride on the Circle Line, one of the city-state’s MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) train lines. The Circle Line is a medium-capacity orbital rapid transit line that connects major residential, commercial, and recreational areas in Singapore. It is the fourth MRT line to be introduced to the train network and is coloured orange on the system map.\n\nThe Circle Line runs in a loop from Dhoby Ghaut station in the city-centre to HarbourFront station in the south via Bishan station in the centre of the country. It is Singapore’s second MRT train line after the North East Line to be completely automated and driverless. The line is currently operated by SMRT Trains Ltd. and is designed to be a fully-underground MRT line.\n\nThe Circle Line will become a complete circle in 2026 with the opening of CCL6, which comprises three stations connecting HarbourFront to Marina Bay. With this expansion, the Circle Line will be 37-kilometer-long and serve 33 stations. The Circle Line is a convenient and efficient way to travel around Singapore, allowing you to easily access many popular destinations.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe Circle Line is a medium-capacity orbital rapid transit line that connects major residential, commercial, and recreational areas in Singapore.\n\nThe Circle Line is a fully-underground MRT line that runs in a loop from Dhoby Ghaut station in the city-centre to HarbourFront station in the south via Bishan station in the centre of the country.\n\nThe Circle Line will become a complete circle in 2026 with the opening of CCL6, which comprises three stations connecting HarbourFront to Marina Bay.\n\nHistory and Development\n\nThe Circle Line is a medium-capacity MRT line in Singapore that is among the world’s longest driverless rapid transit lines. The line was planned in the 1980s and was initially named the Marina Line. The construction of the Circle Line began in 2002, and the first stage of the line was opened in 2009. The line was completed in 2011 with the opening of the final stage.\n\nConstruction Phases\n\nThe construction of the Circle Line was divided into five phases. The first stage of the line, from Dhoby Ghaut to Bartley, was opened in 2009. The second stage, from Bartley to Marymount, was opened in 2010. The third stage, from Marymount to HarbourFront, was opened in 2011. The fourth stage, from Bartley to Serangoon, was opened in 2011. The final stage, from Marina Bay to HarbourFront, was opened in 2012.\n\nThe construction of the Circle Line involved the excavation of tunnels using tunnel boring machines. The line passes through several underground stations, including Bishan, Paya Lebar, and Buona Vista. The construction of the line was carried out by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) in collaboration with various contractors.\n\nNicoll Highway Collapse\n\nThe construction of the Circle Line was not without its challenges. One of the most significant setbacks was the collapse of a section of the Nicoll Highway in 2004. The collapse occurred during the construction of the Circle Line’s Nicoll Highway station, resulting in the death of four workers and the injury of three others.\n\nThe incident led to a review of the safety standards and regulations in the construction industry in Singapore. The LTA also implemented new measures to ensure the safety of workers and the public during the construction of the Circle Line.\n\nOverall, the Circle Line is a significant project that has transformed the public transportation system in Singapore. The line has made it easier for residents and tourists to traverse the city-state and has contributed to the development of the country’s infrastructure.\n\nOperational Aspects\n\nStations and Interchanges\n\nThe Circle Line in Singapore is a fully-underground medium-capacity orbital rapid transit line that serves as a connection between major MRT lines. The line has 28 stations, including interchanges with other MRT lines such as the Downtown Line at Bayfront, Paya Lebar, and MacPherson stations. The CCL also has interchanges with the North East Line at HarbourFront and Serangoon stations, and the East West Line at Buona Vista and Paya Lebar stations.\n\nRolling Stock and Technology\n\nThe Circle Line uses Alstom Metropolis trains that are fully automated and driverless, making it one of the most technologically advanced MRT lines in the world. The trains are equipped with the Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) system that allows for precise control of train movements, enabling shorter headways and more efficient use of the tracks. The CCL trains are maintained at the Kim Chuan Depot, which is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities to ensure the smooth operation of the line.\n\nArt in Transit Programme\n\nThe Circle Line has an Art in Transit programme that showcases a variety of artworks at its stations. The programme includes both permanent and temporary installations, ranging from sculptures and murals to digital media and interactive exhibits. The artworks are designed to enhance the commuting experience and reflect the cultural diversity of Singapore.\n\nOverall, the Circle Line is a vital part of Singapore’s public transportation system, providing commuters with a fast, efficient, and comfortable way to travel around the city. With its advanced technology, modern design, and diverse range of artworks, the CCL is a true reflection of Singapore’s commitment to innovation and creativity.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat stations can be found on the Circle Line?\n\nThe Circle Line in Singapore has 30 stations in total.
