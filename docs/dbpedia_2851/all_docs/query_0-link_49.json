        "text": "…is doomed to repeat it. Harsh words, I know, but as a taxpayer I have to say it. Please don’t sue me.\n\nQuite a while ago I wrote about the Nicoll Highway collapse and how it affected future MRT plans in the Promenade and Nicoll Highway areas. After some recent information dropped, I think it’s fair to say that that tale isn’t over.\n\nA while ago, I went to the Circle Line Stage 6 Project Information Centre — it’s at the old Tanjong Pagar Railway Station carpark, if you’re interested to visit for yourself. While I was there, I learnt quite a few interesting things, which I’ll share in this blog post.\n\n“Next station, Mong Kok”\n\nNope, as much as you probably wish, you didn’t end up on the MTR. Like its Hong Kong counterpart, Prince Edward Station on Singapore’s Circle Line will feature 3 levels and 4 platforms , 2 stacked above the others— a pair which we know will be for the Circle Line, and another pair left empty for a future line. And much like the initial designs for Promenade and Nicoll Highway stations, Prince Edward will also feature a cross-platform interchange with this future line.\n\nBut I can’t help but feel that I have doubts about how useful these extra platforms will be. Firstly, at the east end of the station, any potential extensions of the trackways leading to these spare platforms is constrained by the existing Circle Line alignments, both the mainline towards Marina Bay and the turnback track (explained in the next section). If a line wants to turn north towards Shenton Way, it’ll be a tight fit, whereas it will be of limited usefulness to turn south towards Marina South.\n\nThe west end, on the other hand, would have a track connection from the Circle Line to the extra trackways, but it would seem from the PIC information that the connection will be boarded up. Besides, the trackways are so short that there would be no way to get equipment from the connection from CCL to the extra platforms themselves, anyway.\n\nSecondly, like the existing Circle Line, the extra platforms are built for three-car trains, and while I was at the PIC I saw no way to accommodate longer trains. Due to population growth and the fan favourite “political pressure” it is highly unlikely that another line with three-car trains will ever be built. Hence, will these platforms ever be used in the first place, before considering what they can be used for?\n\nBack to the beginning\n\nThe second curious part about CCL6 is that there exist two branches of the line east of Prince Edward — one goes to Marina Bay, and the other is a relay track that ends just before the TEL Shenton Way Station. The tunnels towards Marina Bay aren’t very interesting, so I’ll focus on the relay tracks.\n\nThe official line is that this turnback exists for a simple reason — to allow trains to reverse direction after Prince Edward, allowing for additional service to be provided between Dhoby Ghaut and Prince Edward. This is much like the old shuttle from Paya Lebar to one-north provided during peak hours. As such, two services will run on the Circle Line — a proper Yamanote-esque loop through Marina Bay and Bishan, and a short-trip service between Dhoby Ghaut and Prince Edward that skips Marina Bay and Bayfront stations.\n\nBut at the same time, I can’t help but think there’s really more to this. The relay tracks are deep enough to just pass over the TEL tunnels after Shenton Way station. After that, it should also be possible to pass under where the NSL and DTL tunnels intersect around Downtown Station, and through the bay to Collyer Quay. Then along Fullerton Road and the Esplanade Bridge, and you’ll reach the phantom provisions at Esplanade station I mentioned earlier.\n\n2 + 2 != 4\n\nBut what will this line be? Where will it go? I can’t say for sure, but if I had to put together some evidence and guess, after Esplanade station it can head in the general northeast direction, providing a second line to the northeast to alleviate the NEL. How?\n\nTalk has been floating about on the internet for a purported Arts Centre Line depicted in the 2001 Concept Plan. In fact, there are already provisions for this line, much like at Chinatown and MacPherson stations, built into Esplanade station. Like Chinatown, the provisions at Esplanade station are located above the Circle Line, at the current divided concourse level. That’s why there are two sets of concourses, two sets of faregates, and two lifts.\n\nThere’s also a Seletar Line, which was planned to follow the CTE and Yio Chu Kang Road up to Sengkang and the Seletar Airport from the Whampoa/Balestier/Boon Keng area. It would not be that difficult to draw a line between Esplanade and Boon Keng, and join these two proposals into a single line. (in fact, the Concept Plan itself may already call for such a link, though I can’t be sure given its vagueness)\n\nAnother potential use for these platforms is as a branch of the Circle Line, serving the reclaimed Keppel and Pasir Panjang port areas which URA expects to develop into something called the “Greater Southern Waterfront”. That’s possible too, but now I’m thinking: If that is the plan, why are the turnbacks connected to the mainline Circle Line, and not to the extra platforms?\n\nAs I’ve explained before, security protocols dictate that trains must be cleared of passengers before it can head into a relay track or depot. As such, to avoid holding up mainline traffic behind, it’s always preferred to use a separate platform for such activities if possible (like at Ang Mo Kio, Tanah Merah, HarbourFront and Marina South Pier). Why, then, if the money is already to construct additional platforms at Prince Edward, to constrain the mainline platforms with such design decisions? The spare platforms could just as easily be used to turn trains.\n\nAnd Keppel\n\nSomething else that might be noteworthy is Keppel Station, where the Circle line stops but the North East Line, despite running parallel to it, does not. Of course, given that the next stop is already HarbourFront, the official line is that there’s no point building an interchange there because you can already use HarbourFront.\n\nHowever, space was actually left in the event that they did want to build a station there, back in 2003, and there also seems to be space in the Circle Line station for such a connection. Who knows, it could actually be done, in the event HarbourFront gets too congested and it needs some relief. MTR actually did this as well, when what was then the Kwun Tong Line was extended one stop to provide two interchanges with the Island Line.\n\nIt’s not over yet, or is it?\n\nI hope LTA have learnt the lessons at Promenade where a pair of nearly-unusable platforms were built (only a small section today is actually in use as a linkway to the DTL platforms), and not dug themselves into another hole here (literally and metaphorically, pardon the pun). I hope they have a good reason to do things the way they’ve done, but I’m not sure if I can have faith in them, given the suboptimal mess at Bahar Junction on the JRL. Gul Circle as well, with its own spare platforms purportedly for the Tuas South Extension.\n\nI think it’s great that our urban planners and MRT architects and engineers have such foresight. After all, cross platform interchanges are arguably some of what makes European metros and the New York Subway great, and it’s not easy to build one after the fact. At the same time, it’s also important to remember that things don’t always go the way you want. I can think of more public instances that where LTA have been caught with their pants down than with a 20 year bet in infrastructure or such paying off.\n\nI guess we’ll just have to see what they’ve come up with in the next Land Transport Masterplan, to be released later this year or early next. I’ll try holding in my pessimism until then.\n\nAnd again, as I mentioned at the start of this post, if you’d like to visit the CCL6 PIC it’s located at the carpark of the old Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, and you can enter from Spottiswoode Park Road. If you ever wanted to know how to build an MRT station, you can go there and see how."
