        "text": "Naples' central transport hub\n\nNaples has one main central station, Napoli Centrale. It's in the heart of the city on Piazza Garibaldi, the square named after the general & revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi. It's three stations in one: A mainline terminus at ground level called Napoli Centrale, an underground station called Napoli Piazza Garibaldi with two underground through platforms for Trenitalia's metropolitan trains & metro line 1, and another underground station also called Napoli Piazza Garibaldi with 4 platforms for EAV's narrow-gauge Circumvesuviana trains to Herculaneum, Pompeii & Sorrento. There's been a station here since 1866, but the current Naples Centrale station was designed in 1954 and opened in 1966. It was modernised 2005-2010.\n\nIncidentally, Napoli Afragola is an out-of-town station 12 km outside the city, don't book to or from Naples Afragola by mistake!\n\nStation overview: Location map\n\nThere's a plan of the station at www.gsretail.it/en/network/napoli-centrale (click EN for English).\n\nNaples Centrale, looking east from an upper floor room in the excellent Unahotel Napoli. In the foreground is the covered retail mall on the south side of Piazza Garibaldi. The station building is behind it, with platforms 2-24 visible behind that. Courtesy of @rail_away.\n\nNaples Centrale facade, main entrance & taxi rank, in the Piazza Garibaldi.\n\nMain entrance from the Piazza Garibaldi.\n\nThe concourse, looking across it with the gateways to the platforms on the left, the exit doors to Piazza Garibaldi on the right.\n\nTicket check between concourse & platform area. A cursory check is made entering the platform area. There's no check when exiting.\n\nWhich platform for your train?\n\nNaples Centrale mainline station is a terminus with platforms numbered 2 to 24 left to right as you look towards the trains.\n\nPlatforms 5-24 are lined up in a neat row behind the main concourse. All of Trenitalia's high-speed, intercity & sleeper trains use these dead-end platforms.\n\nPlatforms 2-4 are at the north end, set back a bit and accessed along platform 5. There's no platform 1.\n\nThere's a circulating area immediately behind the buffer stops so you can easily change trains between platforms without having to go onto the concourse and back through the ticket check.\n\nA glass partition separates the platform area from the concourse with several entry points where there's a simple ticket check for people entering the platform area. It's mainly intended to stop undesirables accessing the platforms, I usually find that anything vaguely ticket-like waved in their general direction gets you through. There's no ticket check when leaving the platform area.\n\nAutomatic ticket gates might be installed at some point, as & when these appear you will simply scan your ticket QR code on your phone or printout to access the platforms.\n\nThe station departure boards show which platform each train leaves from and there are train departure indicators on every platform. You can walk between any two platforms in just 2 or 3 minutes, with easy level access between all platforms, concourse and streets outside.\n\nSee the plan of the station & platforms 2-24 at www.gsretail.it/en/network/napoli-centrale, click EN for English.\n\nCheck your departure platform on your phone\n\nStay one step ahead! If you go to www.viaggiatreno.it/infomobilita/index.jsp on your phone and select Napoli Centrale you'll see a list of departures with the planned platform number (Binario previsto) for Trenitalia trains (but not Italo trains) even before the actual platform (Binario reale) is announced on the station departure boards. Just remember that they can sometimes switch platforms on the day.\n\nAlternatively, you can see actual departure platforms for all trains including Italo by selecting Napoli Centrale at www.rfi.it/en/stations/station-page/quality-services/Public-information/Live-departures-Arrivals-Monitor.html.\n\nNaples Piazza Garibaldi station: This is underground beneath Naples Centrale, just two platforms numbered 1 & 2 served by Trenitalia's Metropolitan trains, with the platforms for Metro line 1 further underground. Most visitors will only need to go here if taking metro line 1 to one of Naples' ferry terminals or Naples Archaeological Museum, or a Trenitalia regional train to Trenitalia's Pompei station if they choose to reach Pompeii that way rather than using the Circumvesuviana.\n\nCircumvesuviana station, also known as Piazza Garibaldi: This is underground alongside Naples Centrale, this is the station for the frequent narrow-gauge Circumvesuviana trains to Ercolano (Herculaneum), Pompeii & Sorrento run by local transit authority EAV, www.eavsrl.it. It's clearly-marked, follow the signs to Circumvesuviana and/or EAV. It's a through station, the Circumvesuviana trains start & finish one stop away at Naples Porta Nolana terminus, just a few hundred metres from Naples Centrale.\n\nCirculating area behind the platforms on the trainside of the ticket check.\n\nThe platforms, numbered 2 to 24 left to right. Above, a Trenitalia Frecciarossa 1000 is on platform 17, an Italo AGV train on platform 18.\n\nAbout changing trains in Naples\n\nChanging between two mainline trains is straightforward. It's a terminus so there's easy level access between platforms 2-24, you can walk between platforms around the back of the buffer stops without passing through the ticket check. It only takes a few minutes to change trains, even if you were changing from platform 2 to platform 24. Just make sure you allow for any delay to your first train - if a booking website suggests a connection, it will be a reasonable one, but if it's mission-critical I'd allow more time.\n\nTip: When connecting between two Trenitalia trains (for example, an Intercity from Sicily into a Frecciarossa high-speed train to Rome or Milan) as long as the scheduled connection is over 15 minutes, you are entitled to later onward travel at no charge if a delay means a missed connection. Online systems will only suggest valid connections. See Trenitalia staff at the help desk if you need reserved seats on a later train. However, that does not apply if you were connecting from a Trenitalia train into a privately-run Italo high-speed train as you'd then be using two different companies.\n\nChanging from a mainline train into a Circumvesuviana train to Herculaneum, Pompeii or Sorrento is also straightforward. It takes 10 minutes to step off a high-speed, intercity or sleeper train on platforms 2-24, walk onto the main concourse, go down the escalators or steps to the EAV Circumvesuviana platforms. Buy a Circumvesuviana ticket at the EAV ticket office opposite the ticket gates onto the Circumvesuviana platforms, or you can use any contactless bank card to touch in and out. Then go onto the platform and hop on the next train on the Sorrento line, they usually leave every 30 minutes. There are two possible southbound platforms, the departure screens will show which one to use for the next train south to Herculaneum, Pompeii & Sorrento.\n\nChanging from the Circumvesuviana onto a mainline train is also simple and takes only minutes, but in this case tickets are usually for a specific mainline train which you don't want to miss, so allow plenty of time in case of delay.\n\nTicket offices & ticket machines\n\nThe Trenitalia ticket office is on the right-hand side of the concourse as you look towards the trains, roughly level with platform 18, marked Biglietteria.\n\nIt can be quicker to use the Trenitalia self-service ticket machines dotted all over the station, these can sell high-speed, intercity and regional tickets, but not Interrail or Eurail reservations. They have a touch screen with English language facility.\n\nItalo has its own ticket office, on the left-hand side of the concourse as you look towards the platforms, roughly level with platform 11.\n\nThe ticket office for the Circumvesuviana railway is underground, adjacent to the Circumvesuviana platforms, follow the signs to Circumvesuviana. The office is marked EAV, the name of the local transit authority. Buy tickets to Herculaneum, Pompeii or Sorrento here.\n\nLeft luggage\n\nThere's a left luggage office if you need to leave your bags, on the far side of the concourse at the platform 4 end, follow the signs for Deposito bagagli. It's privately run by KiPoint/KiBag (www.kipoint.it/deposito-bagagli), see the photo below. For prices & opening times see the left luggage page.\n\nThe left luggage office at Naples Centrale, run by KiPoint/KiBag.\n\nATMs, WiFi, toilets, safety & security\n\nThe station does not currently have free WiFi.\n\nThere are clean toilets one level down, a small charge is made.\n\nThere are ATMs in various locations around the station.\n\nNaples is a great city and I have never felt unsafe or at risk there, certainly not in the well-lit and well-staffed Naples Centrale, even at night. But as in any busy place, be aware of your surroundings, no wallets carelessly sticking out of back pockets and so on.\n\nExecutive & Club class lounges\n\nTrenitalia has a FRECCIALounge for Executive class & Business Salottino passengers on its Frecciarossa trains and those with certain Trenitalia loyalty cards. It's located on the main concourse. It offers power sockets, free WiFi and complimentary drinks and snacks.\n\nYou can add lounge access to your booking for 20 when you book any domestic Trenitalia Intercity or high-speed train in any class at Trenitalia.com. Look for the FrecciaClub/FrecciaLounge +Add button, or the link to add other services. You can use the lounge for up to 4h before departure.\n\nItalo has a lounge for Club class passengers on its Italo trains, on the main concourse. You can use it from 3 hours before your train departs. In Smart & Prima classes, you can sometimes add lounge access when you buy your ticket, for an extra 12 or so.\n\nSomewhere to eat & drink\n\nInside the station\n\nThere are various eateries inside the station, including a Burger King and a couple of decent cafes on the concourse. There's a 2-storey food court off the main concourse at the platform 4 end.\n\nOutside the station\n\nFor a classic Italian meal, try Mimi alla Ferrovia, www.mimiallaferrovia.it, so far recommended by one seat 61 correspondent. Various celebrities have eaten here, from Silvio Berlusconi to opera singer José Carreras. It's 8 minutes walk from Napoli Centrale, just round the corner from the opposite end of the Piazza Garibaldi, see walking map.\n\nTo buy excellent sfogliatelle (traditional Neapolitan pastries), go to a bakery called Attanasio, just off the Piazza Garibaldi 4 minutes walk from Naples Centrale, see walking map. It appears to be where the locals get theirs!\n\nIf you eat at Mimi's, buy a sfoggiatella from Attanasio or have any other suggestion for a meal, coffee or beer let me know!\n\nSupermarkets\n\nThere is a Conad supermarket reached from the main concourse along a passageway at the platform 24 end. It can also be accessed from outside the station, at the southern end of the facade.\n\nFor more choice & quality, there's a Supermercati Superò on Corso Novara, 3 minutes walk north of the station, see walking map.\n\nHotels near Naples Centrale\n\nThere are lots of hotels near Naples Centrale if you need to stay overnight between trains.\n\nThe Starhotel Terminus is just across the road from the station, gets great reviews and has a roof terrace with views over the Bay of Naples.\n\nThe Hotel Potenza is only a little further into the Piazza Garibaldi, cheaper, also with good reviews.\n\nThe Unahotel Napoli is highly recommended, on Piazza Mancini overlooking Piazza Garibaldi (the photo at the top of this page was taken from that hotel).\n\nAlso consider the Pit Stop Napoli Centrale.\n\nLocal transport: Walking, metro, taxis\n\nWalking\n\nNaples Centrale to Naples Archaeological museum: 2.2 km, 29 minutes walk, see walking map.\n\nNaples Centrale to Beverello ferry terminal for ferries to Capri, Ischia: 2.7 km, 34 minutes walk, see walking map.\n\nNaples Centrale to ferry terminal for ferries to Palermo: 2.0 km, 26 minutes walk, see walking map.\n\nMetro\n\nNaples has a limited metro network, see www.anm.it. Metro Line 1 goes from Naples Piazza Garibaldi station (beneath Naples Centrale) to Universita (closest metro station to the ferry port for Palermo), Municipio (closest to Beverello ferry for Capri etc.) and Museo (closest to the Naples Archaeological Museum).\n\nTaxis: For a taxi fare calculator see www.taxifarefinder.com/main.php?city=Naples-Italy. Taxis are usually plentiful outside the main exit.\n\nCircumvesuviana trains to Herculaneum, Pompeii & Sorrento\n\nThe narrow-gauge electric Circumvesuviana Railway runs from Naples to Ecolano (Herculaneum), Pompeii Villa Dei Misteri & Sorrento, a train usually leaves every 30 minutes. Run by local transport authority EAV (www.eavsrl.it), it's a mass-transit metro service, either buy a ticket from the EAV ticket office and hop on the next train, or you can pass through the ticket gates with any contactless bank card, look for a ticket gate with the contactless symbol.\n\nI've a soft spot for the little Circumvesuviana, the trains may be graffiti'd and can be crowded at peak times, but it's a lovely ride around the Bay of Naples with views of Vesuvius on one side and of the sea on the other. Look after your valuables, it's not a place for leaving a wallet sticking out of a back pocket, but I've never had any problem so don't let it put you off. More about visiting Pompeii.\n\nTip: The Circumvesuviana trains start their journey one stop away at Naples Porta Nolana terminus, a 10-minute 750m walk from Naples Centrale. Rather than board at Centrale/Porta Garibaldi, one option is to stroll to Porta Nolana and board there, to be sure of a seat at busy times. See walking map.\n\nTo reach the Circumvesuviana platforms, look for these steps & escalators at the back of the concourse. Go down these and turn left at the bottom into a long passageway, following the signs to Circumvesuviana. Further on the signs change to EAV Linee Vesuviane, but it's the same place.\n\nCircumvesuviana Railway Porta Garibaldi station. At the end of the long passageway, you reach the Circumvesuviana Porta Garibaldi station (above). In the photo above, the EAV ticket office is on the right, the ticket gates to the Circumvesuviana platforms on the left. Some gates allow you to touch in & out with a contactless bank card, with no need to buy a ticket.\n\nCircumvesuviana platforms 1, 2 3 & 4. You walk down steps onto the platform, it's usually platform 1 (on the left of this photo) for Herculaneum, Pompeii and Sorrento. Departure screens tell you where each train is going as it comes in. The train on the right is (unusually) free of any graffiti.\n\nBack to top"
