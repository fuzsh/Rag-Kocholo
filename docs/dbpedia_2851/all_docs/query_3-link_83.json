        "text": "What do the One Ring (from JRR Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings) and our Circle Line have in common?\n\nWell, for a start, both are rings,\n\nshare that same yellow-orange-ish hue (yellow and orange are so similar there was an entire debate over the CCL’s colour a while back),\n\nhave historically wrecked much havoc,\n\nand continue to be potential sources of trouble if not managed well.\n\nThe good news is, while the solution to the evils caused by one is to completely destroy it in the fires of Mount Doom, the other doesn’t require such a violent resolution to remove the issues it has!\n\nAlthough the Circle MRT line is on paper, an orbital line, it is quite different from the standard orbital line one finds elsewhere, the ones with every stop (or most excepting a handful) being transfer points to other radial lines kind. Another interesting point to note would be the “radius” of the Circle Line in relation to similar lines elsewhere — among orbital rapid transit lines we sit somewhere in the upper 1/4 in terms of area encircled. Combined with the fact that the Circle Line has driven its own development (in Tai Seng, West Coast and Mountbatten) since it opened, this results in one key phenomenon that needs to be recognised when we look at ways to resolve the CCL’s problems:\n\nThe Circle Line is as much a trunk line as it is an orbital line.\n\nOr if that was too legalese, basically the Circle Line is a trunk.\n\nWhat do circles do?\n\nBefore we examine how our Circle Line is not your typical orbital line, it’s helpful to know the role orbital lines play in any transport network. As their name suggests, they “orbit” around the center in a radial/polar network structure, forming a closed endless loop connecting all the radial elements together at another point besides the center where all radial lines typically intersect.\n\nIn the example network shown below (thank you to Alternative Transport for the handy infographic!), both the blue and very-light-blue (I have no idea how to describe that colour…) circular lines form orbitals in the sense that they connect the green (both), orange, purple and red lines, all of which are radial lines from the general center of the transport network.\n\nThus, the main value of an orbital line in the context of a radial network (Note: they exist in gridded connective networks too, and this applies equally well in such contexts too. See: Beijing Lines 2 and 10) is to relieve pressure off the central transfer nodes, through diverting demand around the center with another line. The same concept also applies for the building of ring roads around cities to relieve congestion — traffic that bypasses the urban center is thus diverted around it so the central sections of the road network with typically lower capacity do not get overwhelmed.\n\nOrbital lines typically are designed such that every node forms a connection with an outgoing radial line, maximising its potential as an added form of connectivity in a polar network.\n\nMoscow’s 5-Koltsevaya is a good example of this:\n\nNotice that every single station on Line 5 intersects with a radial or diametrical element. As a result, demand of an ideal orbital line does not add to the net total demand of a system’s network, since the orbital line is playing a purely connective role. Put another way, an orbital line does not generate its own demand. Any demand generated on an ideal orbital line is purely the result of a demand shift from other radial lines where the orbital line is chosen as a better transport option to transferring downtown due to various reasons such as shorter travel times, avoiding crowds etc. Hence, smaller capacities for rolling stock used on orbital lines, while not the most ideal (this really differs between cities based on varying demand patterns), is more permissible in the sense that as ideal orbital lines, they will not draw such drastic an increase in demand as compared to typical trunk routes where the law of induced demand holds true. So strategies to manage passenger pressure with smaller trains can effectively manage overcrowding, if and ever it happens on ideal orbital lines. Even so, the 5-Koltsevaya Circle and 14-MCC lines in Moscow utilise large-configuration trains, with the 5-Koltsevaya running 6-car trains, and the 14-MCC operating 10-car commuter rail sets. Partly of course, to deal with their far greater population size, which implies higher Metro ridership. Also remember, one thing Moscow is known for, which we are not, is their legendary sub-100s train intervals, so that’s yet another crowd management bonus for the Russian capital.\n\nHowever, an ideal orbital line is often not adopted as a transportation strategy especially in most cities which do high-density sprawl in all directions, as is the case nowadays especially in Asia. Problems of having astronomical populations in limited land space, you know. Ideal orbital lines, while adding little to no demand to the overall network themselves, unfortunately by their very definition will usually need to be of limited size, since the “every station an interchange” criteria implies an increasing difficulty in stuffing more and more lines together downtown the greater your orbital radius. (Disclaimer: This is largely untrue for connective grid networks).\n\nAs orbital radii get larger to fit more catchment, there will inevitably be stations along the orbital line which do not form interchange stations with other lines. In fact, a good many orbital lines out there do have a substantial number of non-interchange stations.\n\nConsider London’s Circle Line:\n\nOr Beijing’s Line 10:\n\nOr the “second ring” of the Moscow Metro, Line 14 (alternatively called the MCC):\n\nOr… the Circle Line our northern neighbour is planning, but doesn’t seem to be acting upon:\n\nAnd of course, our very own source of chaos:\n\nThese additional non-interchange stations along these orbitals increase the catchment of the overall rail network, hence creating a net increase in ridership. As they generate demand in and of themselves, the role of these orbitals is no longer just to connect the various radial lines, but also to provide transport connectivity to unique points along these orbitals, hence increasing the demand for such orbital lines beyond that expected of ideal orbitals.\n\nIn fact, is it not the role of any given line to provide transport connectivity to other points along the network for a unique point, that of a trunk line?\n\nNote: for the infographic below, the point on capacity was originally meant for rapid routes. Still holds true for trunk rail lines, in the context of rapid transit lines simultaneously being rapid routes\n\nWhich only makes the eventual decision to use three-car trainsets for the CCL (mind you, their capacity doesn’t even get to half that of the six-car trains used on the NSEWL) less palatable at the end of the day to the large crowds who have to use it.\n\nRemember, as much as our Circle Line is said to be an orbital, it is also a trunk route. That will help clear up much of the confusion, since apparently there still seem to be a substantial group who attempt to justify the lower capacity through the “orbital” classification.\n\nUnhelpful teammates\n\nBesides having to contend with greater demand than previously thought of, the CCL isn’t helped by two factors, some discussed to a certain extent in previous posts on STC. In fact, they contribute more to the trainwreck (ha, ha) that is the perennial overcrowding the CCL faces, even outside the peak periods.\n\nThe first (linked to the next point) is the acute train shortage the CCL faces to run truly high frequencies during the peak (and decent intervals during the off-peak). At present, the CCL has 71km of revenue service track* across both the mainline between Dhoby Ghaut and HarbourFront, as well as the spur connection from Promenade to Marina Bay.\n\n*71km figure derived from doubling the length of the CCL (35.5km) for the bidirectional track served\n\nHowever, the current CCL fleet, despite the introduction of the newer C830Cs in 2015 which increased the fleet size by a whopping 60% to the present 64 trains, still might not suffice for smooth operations that can handle CCL demand. This results in the second major shortcoming of the CCL — inability to operate at the high frequencies needed to clear passengers through rather than keeping them stuck at the bottlenecks of the transfer stations.\n\nLet’s do some quick maffs. The total fleet assigned to the CCL is 64. The total length of revenue track of the CCL is 71km. Assuming all trains are deployed (this is a huge assumption, made to make a point), this means the average distance between trains is 1,109m. The average stop spacing between CCL stations is 1,183m. Given a 70 min one-way runtime, average travel time between stations (note: excludes dwell time at stations) is 2m20s. Comparing the ratio of average distance between trains to average CCL station spacing thus gives us a minimum permissible train frequency of 2min11s (rounded to next second).\n\nRemember, this train frequency is only attainable by deploying the entire fleet of 64 trains on the CCL at once, which is an obvious operational impossibility. Even if this could be done, it would be sustainable for at most half a day, before stressing the system (especially at the branch junction at Promenade) starts to cause more problems than it solves. If anything, recall what happened that night in 2020, and translate it to our CCL, except that we would be directly responsible for causing it through exerting such stress on the system.\n\nIn practice however, the maximum number of trains currently deployed during the peak periods on the CCL is only 53, leaving 11 spares in the depot (and scattered across the line) to be maintained or on standby. This translates to a peak frequency of about 160s, or 2m40s. Placed in the context of the CCL being very heavily used as part of journeys involving the other radial MRT lines which run a combination of higher frequencies and larger train capacities, and it would be a miracle if the CCL manages to cope with all the demand fed into it by the 6-car lines. Of particular note, citybound NEL trains arriving Serangoon station in the morning overflowing empty out about one-third of their load, most of which goes towards the CCL (in both directions), as well as contributing to the mad crowds associated with this station. The reverse applies in the evening. Do remember, the North-East Line operates 6-car trains, operating every 110s in the morning (2m15s in the evening), while the CCL that has to scoop up the demand operates 3-car trains arriving at intervals 50% worse.\n\nAlso complicating matters is the fact that the CCL is not used like any ordinary trunk line, it is also used as an arterial trunk, a main trunk, often the only palatable option on the table for passengers. The CCL’s northern portion (between Paya Lebar and Buona Vista via Bishan) is a particular crunch zone, closely linked to two major demand patterns, both of which fall particularly heavily on the CCL’s shoulders due to a lack of alternative travel options. One, the northeast to south-west axis, where passengers travel between their residences in the northeast to their schools in Bukit Timah, Dover, or workplaces such as one-north, Science Park or elsewhere further west (where a further connection to the EWL is needed). The other is the northeast to southeast axis, where the CCL is still the preferred travel option for northeast residents to travel to their jobs located in the Ubi/Kaki Bukit and Paya Lebar regions. Add both to additional demand flowing in from the north boarding the trains at Bishan and Caldecott, and you get the crunch loads that you witness on CCL trains every peak hour. Further not helping with the mess is the highly all-day nature of such demand along these major demand axes — the CCL is the go-to for students from across the island to travel back home in the middle of the day, and the line comprises a healthy mix of stations serving various purposes, each drawing demand at their respective parts of the day, keeping the trains crowded all day long.\n\nLast but clearly not least, the CCL suffers the same issue of branching (Why is it bad? I’ve explained here years ago) which further affects frequency. This is less apparent during the peak period where only the lower-demand downtown segments of the line experience the “worse” 5m30s frequencies, but outside the peak period the style of making only the Promenade – Stadium section the “mainline” (where all trains call) and everything else the “branch” compromises service further for non-peak travellers of the CCL, who do constitute a significant lot, especially mid-afternoon (2pm onwards) and weekend travellers who use the CCL to visit attractions accessible by or via it.\n\nCome 2025, with the opening of CCL6, the 5.5 min service gap in the CBD becomes more painful, since one of the implied intents of CCL6, besides the official “closing the circle” trope, is to act as another way into the CBD besides the existing (overloaded) EWL. Plans to terminate the JRL extension at Haw Par Villa only further confirm this, suggesting an intended “alternative pathway” for west siders to enter the CBD would be a combination of taking the JRL and CCL to the financial hub at Marina Bay, where commuters would head on to their downtown destinations in the reverse peak direction along the NSL or TEL (or DTL, from Bayfront station)\n\nHowever, the intended service plan for CCL after “closing the circle” means a gap is formed between Prince Edward Road, where every other train will turn around, and Marina Bay, the closest point to the western portions of the CCL where a transfer to another line entering the CBD is possible (besides the current HarbourFront). Combined with the already low transport capacity of the CCL, it would not come as a surprise should a bottleneck be formed at Prince Edward Road station when it opens. Or overflowing trains straining themselves on the short sector to Marina Bay. Or a mix of both. None of which are scenarios we should be wishing for to happen, since these kept causing faults and delays on the CCL all the way up to the start of the pandemic. It’s also timely to note, Prince Edward Road station, while being located near the Shenton Way bus terminal, is still a considerable distance from most notable locations passengers using such a route would be travelling to, hence it is unlikely there would be a significant reduction in demand here to accommodate the bottleneck.\n\n(Disclaimer: Infographic made prior to announcement of CCL6 being delayed to 2026)\n\nThe additional Dhoby Ghaut to Promenade spur, while it does generate some demand on its own, takes more than it gives, limiting the amount of service we can provide to PEW – Marina Bay sector due to the nature of branching.\n\nIn short, the current problems of the CCL can be attributed to its lack of capacity provided due to a fatal misconception of trunk and orbital services being mutually exclusive during the planning, and its inability to provide good quality service even with its reduced capacity due to factors related to lack of resources available, as well as the branching present that further hinders our ability to get service right.\n\nAnd it will get worse. Major developments are coming up in the vicinity of the CCL, which once completed, will only bring further demand to the same congested stretches of today, giving the CCL even more of a trunk role, which further highlights the inadequacy of running 3-car sets on perhaps the most heavily-used MRT line on average.\n\nNotice the missing “CC18” on the map? That is reserved for Bukit Brown, currently a shell station located underneath a cemetery. From 2040 onwards, the area will be gradually built up for a possible HDB town centered around the station, whenever that opens. Given the size of the development area, one can expect significant additional demand to the already large crowds riding the CCL by then. It might just tip the balance and completely overwhelm the CCL, even with our current measures in place.\n\nTo the east, new flats are scheduled for launch (soon, I believe) in the Bidadari area, in tandem with the development of new transport infrastructure (among them, Bidadari ITH which has been delayed for no-one-knows-how-long). In a recent visit to the area in December 2022, most of the blocks are more-or-less complete, awaiting final touches and the moving in of tenants, which means the area is expected to be populated by the end of this year. While the main focus is on Woodleigh station on the NEL (which Bidadari ITH is linked to), I contend that Bartley station along the CCL may see greater utility given the larger range of destinations and more connections it provides to other parts of the network. That will also add on to the crowds, and could possibly worsen the overcrowding at Serangoon when passengers transferring from the NEL find themselves unable to board the CCL.\n\nTo the south, the Greater Southern Waterfront is one major development we should all be watching out for. While no explicit transit connections are planned (what happened to “walk, cycle, ride” as the way forward??), the CCL is the closest rail connection for the majority of destinations located within the GSW. Come 2040, the CCL won’t just have to contend with congestion on the northern half of the circle — the southern half will be equally occupied with the task of transporting large numbers of passengers to and fro home, work, school, and recreation in the GSW. If the current crowds at Pasir Panjang scare you enough, wait for the GSW’s expected completion in 2040. The crowds all day long along this part of the CCL will be sufficient to send you into a coma (trust).\n\nAnd the GSW is not some faraway consideration we can push to the back of our minds for like the next five or ten years. Already, BTO flats are scheduled for launch in “the next five years” (according to PropertyGuru’s report dated April 2022), which suggests a tentative completion and move-in date around 2030, giving the CCL6 and its associated additional fleets a few years of breathing space before shit comes back to hit the fan again.\n\nThe cage for the ring is never strong enough\n\nCurrent measures are being attempted, but they won’t quite suffice for future-proofing the CCL’s madness. It’s like a cage made to contain the Ring’s power which it will eventually grow out of and hence be rendered obsolete.\n\nOff the bat, the most obvious service improvement currently underway is the introduction of 23 new C851E trainsets (the nacho-cheese colour trains pictured at the start of the article), thus bringing the total CCL fleet size to 87. That gives us a much wider berth to improve upon the CCL’s service frequency (especially when it is most needed) as the fleet addition far outstrips the line extension, as opposed to the NEL where the opposite is true. That gives us room to improve the CCL’s combined service frequency (along the common sector between Promenade and Prince Edward Road in the major arc) to 2 minutes, requiring 71 trains to operate, leaving a good 16 for maintenance and spares scattered across the line. The catch here however, is that 2 min frequencies will be sufficient, only for current demand levels.\n\nSo while running 71 trains may mean sights like these are no longer a thing for the time being:\n\nthey will resurface in future with increase in CCL demand as explained earlier\n\nWhich thus requires more comprehensive solutions for our orbital-cum-trunk line to be able to meet transport demand in future along corridors with initially higher-than-anticipated demand which has greatly caught our planners off guard. After all, the designed lifespan of MRT infrastructure is about 80-100 years, and whatever is being thrown at it has to be able to withstand for at least that period of time. After that, we certainly have the “nuke everything and start over” option, but that’s so far in the future I doubt I’d be around to be part of that conversation.\n\nTaming the ring\n\nAn easy way out for alleviating the congestion on the CCL would be to get even more trains on top of the C851E order already placed, thus enabling the CCL to run at 100s frequencies, even better than the best peak frequencies currently operated on the 6-car lines, in an attempt to make up for the capacity disparity. However, there is only so far you can push the line’s capacity in this direction before the limits of the signalling system (the same CBTC that also powers all other MRT lines here) get tested. There is also the question of where all the extra trains would be stored, since expansions to the current Kim Chuan Depot are already underway to accommodate the C851E trains alone. Lastly, the CCL also has the issue of still operating from a single depot, which makes launching and keeping trains more troublesome. In other words, you may have more trains, but if they are all kept in a single depot, they won’t launch fast enough given the same number of reception tracks available.\n\nThere also exists a rather significant number who believe inaction, or maintaining the way the CCL is currently is doable, because the CRL is coming in 2030!!\n\nFirst, there’s the inconvenient detail that by 2030, the CRL will only be open up to Bright Hill. That alone prevents the CRL from being able to cover for the western portion of the CCL by then.\n\nAlso, such a statement reveals a lack of awareness about a critical note on the CCL I began with, and have been repeating throughout this post:\n\nThe Circle Line is as much a trunk as it is an orbital\n\n~me, 2023, this post\n\nEven in its complete form, the CRL will only be able to soak up demand for which the CCL plays the orbital role. Its trunk role however, is irreplaceable, by the very nature of a start/end point located along the CCL. At the way the CCL is currently used now by passengers whose travel to locations outside the CBD, the CCL remains the most, if not the only, viable option to get there. Think of trips to points on the southern half of the CCL. For the time being, that does not have much of an alternative route available, thus the (rising, at that) demand for CCL will not go away the way most people think come 2030. What the CRL does assure us of, however, is the reduction of expected demand from passengers connecting between the radial lines by hard carrying that in future, thus allowing the CCL to focus on its trunk role better.\n\nNow then, let’s consider possible doable measures to tame this unwieldly Ring that we have on our hands.\n\nLet’s consider perhaps, how our Circle Line trains are deployed in the morning. From first train timing at 5.10 am, trains are launched out of Kim Chuan Depot at the standard off-peak intervals of 5.5 minutes, until the entire line receives off-peak service levels. Only after that is the second wave of trains launched for the “morning peak” periods, bringing train intervals down to the struggling 2m40s to handle the increased crowds by 7.30am. Unfortunately, the fact that the Circle Line has only one depot, located a good 40 minutes away from its furthest end, means that full enhanced frequencies will only be felt, more than one full hour after the first additional trains are launched out of the depot. Split slot trains, launched at 6.30am from Kim Chuan Depot towards HarbourFront, only return to Bishan in the Dhoby Ghaut direction (for the surge in eastbound demand during the morning peak) after 7.30am to handle the uniquely Bishan crowds. Perhaps, such deployments were done with the typical schedules expected of a radial trunk rail line, with the additional peak service launched “just in time, (almost) just in place” to coincide with the surge in demand in the morning. Except, this pattern does not apply for the Circle Line, where peak demand comes in before the usual peak periods (due to the multi-utility nature of the orbital-cum-trunk line), and the depot / track configurations are set up such that the standard practice of injecting additional trains into the line at 6am is not doable for the CCL. Think of the platform crowding madness at Bishan station. At 7am, westbound (HarbourFront-bound) trains are arriving every 2min40s, at standard CCL-level peak frequencies. Even so, passengers are still being left behind. Now turn your head and look at the eastbound (Dhoby Ghaut / Marina Bay-bound) platform. The long lines spill over to the other side of the platform, yet nearly 6 minutes elapse before a train appears.\n\nTherefore, it is proposed that the “peak-only” CCL slots are launched together with their full-day counterparts, deployed significantly earlier in the morning than they currently are, such that the “2-min” frequency wave returns to the northern sections of the CCL in the Dhoby Ghaut direction in time for the arrival of the morning crowds. If that cannot be done, the least that can be done would be to run short trips from Bartley to Caldecott, and turn trains around with the Bukit Brown siding. Either way, Bishan passengers are getting eastbound trains faster at 7am.\n\nThis fix, while sounding rather cheap and “no shit”, is however rather effective at reducing the early morning crowd buildups, since if earlier crowds can be cleared, less spills over to subsequent trains, thus reducing the queue lines at the northern CCL stations in the morning. If earlier CCL trains, with improved frequency, are able to clear the first batch of crowds, then subsequent batches of commuters utilising the CCL will not have to fight with those left behind by previous trains. It doesn’t exactly improve things in the sense of adding capacity, but it still results in a perceived service improvement on the commuter end of the equation. At least, this is a quick stop-gap fix that can be done as more substantial and disruptive modifications are conducted on the CCL to upgrade it for the long-term.\n\nTake a leaf out of Hong Kong\n\nIn the longer run however, the CCL’s 3-car capacity will be insufficient to meet the ever-growing demand placed upon it by new development, especially in the eastern and southern portions of the loop. Together with the intent to develop the CCL into a possible “third route” into the CBD (besides EWL and DTL, to relieve the overcrowded west side), an expansion in the CCL’s configuration is inevitable at some point to ensure that it will continue to be able to last in the decades beyond.\n\nInstead of the current 3-car configurations which provide a measly transport capacity of just below 28,000 passengers per direction/hour (2-min frequency), an expansion of CCL trains to 4- or 5-car configurations would yield far increased passenger throughputs of up to 48,000 ppdph, nearly double that of the present CCL. Expanding CCL trains through addition of extra cars to the current 3-car trains is thus a highly worthwhile investment despite the seemingly intimidating cost of having to expand Kim Chuan Depot (or possibly the addition of a new depot somewhere in West Coast!!) and expansion of the platform of every station along the CCL. While not explicitly for purposes of jacking up service capacity, such expansions have been done before in Hong Kong, to much favourable returns.\n\nUnfortunately for us, there lies one not-so-insignificant difference with the Hong Kongers which makes our job of expanding the CCL more difficult than HK did with their non 8-car lines. The simple fact that our CCL is underground, meaning we have structural considerations when it comes to expanding our underground stations into earth. Likely, attempting such a feat is highly challenging, if not impossible by current technological levels. Nonetheless, hopes for expanding CCL trainsets are not dashed.\n\nA convenient “aid” that has been given to us, built in into the design of CCL platforms, is the far longer service corridors at the ends of the platforms, built in to house access to station equipment which would have otherwise been embedded into the pillars or the platform ends on those serving trains of longer configurations. For many CCL stations, these service corridors are at least the length of half a train car, if not way more than that.\n\nThis is particularly apparent when you watch joyride videos of the CCL or DTL (and now, TEL as well). Service corridors run off for lengths almost that of an entire extra train car after the platform end return doors before the train descends into pitch black darkness, entering the tunnel proper.\n\nIn contrast, these service corridors are far shorter on the NSEWL underground stations. Often, they are so short they get missed far too often in joyride videos.\n\nWould it then be possible for the platform screen doors to be extended into the end service corridors to support 4-car, or heck, if they were long enough to permit, 5-car operations on the CCL? In the worst case scenario, we could perhaps explore the option of introducing selective-door operation at stations with insufficiently long “provisions” (ie service corridors) to handle the expanded train configurations. As far as possible however, the number of doors left hanging outside the platform screen door range would be kept to a minimum, since the CCL as an orbital role (on top of its trunk role, which is what the train expansions are geared towards) involves heavy passenger exchange, favoured by having more doors available.\n\nIn our case, the CCL fleet ages look in favour of such a fleet expansion. The C830s are set to enter refurbishment (It’s a joke when done in Singapore, but an opportunity anyway) in a few years time, hot on the heels of similar work done to the legacy NEL fleet. That constitutes an excellent opportunity for us to expand the configuration of the legacy C830 fleet (which will number 40 out of 87 trains by then) to 4 or 5 cars, partially bringing much-needed relief to congested sections on the Circle Line. Similar expansion works can also be brought to the later C830C batch (numbering 24 out of 87) shortly thereafter, to bring up train capacities across the board. Of course, we aren’t missing the elephant in the room (at the start of this post): top-up orders for the newer C851E trains (23 sets) should also be called as a final step towards this long-term capacity upgrade on our first orbital line.\n\nNow we’ve come to the part of the Ring that throws a wrench in its viability as a west-side alternative: the branching that reduces its effectiveness as 3rd western route\n\nDebranching the Circle\n\nIt has been almost 3 years since I first brought up the branching issue of the CCL. Long story short, it arises from the situation of the necessary turnback infrastructure that would make possible an operational separation of both service patterns (the Dhoby Ghaut and Marina Bay spurs)… at Stadium, a good two stations away from the intersection point, resulting in a wastefully small “common sector” which constrains train service levels on the rest of the line.\n\nWhich means one possible way to de-branch the Circle Line, while keeping infrastructure constant, would be to somehow find a way for trains from Bayfront to terminate at Promenade, then reverse the same way they came back from, turning the Circle Line into an outward spiral, similar to London’s Circle Line, with the line terminating on itself.\n\nExcept the planned cross-platform transfer set-ups at Promenade and Nicoll Highway effectively dash such chances of provisioning turnback infrastructure for either the spur or main service at these stations, thus forcing the turnback siding currently used by the Marina Bay short trip to be placed at Stadium itself (as it is, today). Hence, in order to de-branch the Circle Line and truly unlock its potential which lies in frequent service, more drastic options should, and must be explored.\n\nWays to take apart a branch at Promenade, ft. my 30-second doodles\n\n(I really should get an iPad for this kind of things, but at the same time I’m reluctant… sigh)\n\nHere are a few possible ways to take apart the Circle Line branch at Promenade.\n\nThe first would be to re-open the provisioned tracks at the cross-platform transfer at the Promenade upper platform, thus creating a single-track sector along which spur line trains from Dhoby Ghaut would terminate. There’s more than a few problems that would arise of this though.\n\nFor one, the other “track” of the upper platform at Promenade station has been partially converted into a DTL access link escalator to the lower platform, where the DTL passenger service center is. Taking into account the structural compromises that have already been carried out to punch that hole creating such an access link, it would be highly unlikely to reinstate a cross-platform transfer at the upper platforms of Promenade station as originally envisioned in the 2001 Concept Plan.\n\nTrains from Esplanade will also have a really hard time turning into this new platform, even if we hypothetically assume a restoration of the upper provisioned track tunnels. Already, trains on the CCL struggle to negotiate the tight bends between the current CCL platforms at Promenade towards Dhoby Ghaut, and that is talking about the eastern stacked island platform tracks, which offer a far larger turning radius than between the tracks on the other side towards Esplanade. While the CCL certainly won’t be facing a train shortage after the C851E intake is complete, that doesn’t give us the go-ahead to break trains with the devillish turn that would result from such. Sounds like the easiest option, but nah-ah, sadly unfeasible.\n\nProposal number 2: London-style, build new terminating platforms\n\nIn short, trains from Dhoby Ghaut pass through Promenade via the current platforms, go through the loop, before terminating at a new set of platforms linked to the current ones.\n\nSounds like an excellent proposal right, since we’ve even gone the extra step to remove spur routes altogether?\n\nThe catch here is that whatever new platform built for such a purpose would inevitably find itself “homeless” under the technically challenging monolith of the Suntec towers located just to the west of the station. Just beside the existing CCL platforms at Promenade lie the site of the DTL platforms (an almost-vertical stack of 4 platforms on top of each other, located side-by-side). To go any further to carve out new room for said terminating platforms would encroach into any possible underground space already being utilised by buildings such as Suntec, Milennia Walk and the like. Besides, even if didn’t, such intensive works to build complex structures under towering skyscrapers runs a high and real risk of structural instability to buildings situated above the site of the new terminating platforms.\n\nSome may want to try a mix of proposals #1 and #2, such that the spur line to Dhoby Ghaut terminates at a new set of platforms to the east of the current CCL station. More doable, though the two existing CCL tunnels stacked on top of each other just to the south of Promenade station (where the “junction” between the two branches lie) form a sort of “wall” that makes it considerably trickier to pass through.\n\nProposal number 3: Run the spur in a straight line from Esplanade, create a new platform under the present Marina Centre Bus Terminal.\n\nOverall a pretty decent proposal, since it also leaves possible provision for extensions across Marina Reservoir, thus ensuring this awkward line fragment that results from de-branching the Circle Line doesn’t stay awkward for long.\n\nBut it’s also not for long before you ask yourself where such a line could possibly be extended to, towards the east. Directly across from Marina Centre is Founders’ Memorial, where an interchange with the TEL is possible (faster ride from the CBD to Katong? :think:). Beyond that… it’s crickets and you hit the sea just off East Coast Park. Sure, in the very long term we could possibly look at a further extension to serve East Coast reclaimed land, but for the forseeable future the furthest such a line could possibly go would be Rhu South. Not quite helpful in making a line fragment unawkward.\n\nAnd as is obvious from my 30-second doodle above, expect a rather unwieldly transfer passage (a la Stevens, but on steroids) between the existing and current platforms, since you have to integrate the DTL into this mess too. Not very helpful when it comes to how messed up Promenade station already is in terms of rail-rail connectivity.\n\nBefore anyone forgets, the “wall” issue discussed under Proposal 2 unfortunately holds true for such a plan as well.\n\nA small sacrifice\n\nProposal 3 above, had it not been for its shortcomings, would have made for a great way to increase the utility of the Dhoby Ghaut – Esplanade spur sector, which itself sees little to no demand even during the peak periods. Therefore, should the CCL retain the arrangement of the spur remaining operationally separate from the mainline, which will most likely be the case, effort has to be taken in order to re-route or extend the line fragment elsewhere. Because when you take stop spacing of this particular spur segment into account, as well as its abysmally low demand, it actually forms one of the few rare cases where an APM line would be better justified to serve this corridor. How do we continue to ensure the far greater capacity of the 3-car CCL trains does not go to waste? Of course, by extending the spur, but not in the direction one would typically expect.\n\nIn earlier posts, I noted the chronic “missing nodes” issue of missed connections between rail lines intersecting within downtown Singapore. With the opening of TEL Stage 3, this issue now expands to that of lines that are near, but do not intersect each other, since TEL3 acts as a sort of half-circumferential route around the southwestern flank of the CBD, which wraps it around other lines intersecting within the CBD, but fails to interact with those that do not leave the CBD along this flank. Case in point: Downtown Line, which acts as a far faster way into the heart of the CBD than the meandering TEL3 route, yet does not have a single connection to the TEL except at Stevens (and in future, Sungei Bedok).\n\nThere is much that can be done with a hanging line fragment along Stamford Road, if we are willing to accept one major sacrifice to free us from the operational shackles of the “current arrangement”. Most proposals to de-branch the CCL continue to keep the connection to the mainline at Promenade in some form, since conventional wisdom regarding this line goes that its utility will be further reduced should either of the two connections be removed. Yet it is also this insistence on keeping the Promenade connection that severely limits the possibilities, by nature of the latter’s “cornered” position along the banks of the Kallang River. Think about that for a moment. In any case, drastic changes are already being made in order to de-branch the Circle. Why don’t we take it one step further to do this right on just the second try, rather than have to come back to the drawing board again when our mistakes get the better of us.\n\nMarina Line, 2.0?\n\nThere are a few such “missed connections” in the CBD which, while unable to be completely plugged with a full-blown interchange station, can be mitigated by bridging over with a rail-rail-rail connection to fill the gap:\n\nEWL – CCL (near Bugis, Bras Basah)\n\nNSEWL – DTL (near Raffles Place, Downtown)\n\nTEL – DTL (gap between Telok Ayer and Maxwell)\n\nTEL – EWL (underneath Shenton Way)\n\nA role for which an extended spur fragment could play very well. Here, the light-rail nature of what was originally meant to be the Marina Line plays well for a line… that essentially is somewhat of a replication of the original Marina Line! After Esplanade, the newly-formed shuttle line (downtown circulator? :think:) proceeds under Marina Square, then across the Singapore River, before calling at existing major CBD stations such as Raffles Place, Telok Ayer and Shenton Way.\n\nMap with details accessible via this link.\n\nLucky for us, another set of provisions allows us to tie up this “loose thread” nicely: Prince Edward Road station, located a stone’s throw away from Shenton Way, is built with a similar stacked-island cross-platform transfer configuration as was originally planned for Promenade station. Our new shuttle line can thus continue on towards new developments in the Greater Southern Waterfront, finally at last providing major public transport connections to probably our largest redevelopment project in the 2030s. It’s a bit of a distasteful joke that the GSW has zero transit connections planned at this stage save for its northern periphery…\n\nIt could also be possible to extend the downtown shuttle westwards, in a similar fashion to the planned Holland Line from CP 2001, passing by Holland Village, Maju, Bukit Batok along the way towards Tengah, thus finally providing a trunk public transport connection directly to the burgeoning developments planned for the “next big thing” out west. It’s quite a joke that Tengah, despite its size and significance in the decades to come, does NOT have any trunk transit connections planned, be it by bus or rail. The Holland/Tengah extension could help.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nPresently, the CCL is a chaotic mess, unwieldy and sometimes, unhinged when the going gets tough. And much of the discourse, or planning that went into CCL has for a considerably long period of time underplayed the important role our “orbital” line has been playing. Not merely an orbital as conventional planning wisdom goes, a brighter future for our orange-coloured Ring, would be to greatly bolster its capabilities to deliver upon its role as yet another major trunk rail line, unhindered by historical baggage in offering the best service levels as technically possible.\n\nImagine the Circle Line as we know it in the 2030s, after a comprehensive upgrading programme. Long, five-car trains, operating at 3-min intervals even during the off peak hours, provide fast and reliable rides across the city-state. Train faults and delays are now largely-unheard of — the CCL’s MKBF by then has risen to 1.5 million km, on par with today’s most reliable rail lines. A second depot around the West Coast area has been built to increase the responsiveness of service adjustments to demand patterns around the Greater Southern Waterfront, as well as to cater to the far greater number of trains used — peak fleet utilisation has increased from the current 53 to an impressive 78 trains for the main ring. Complementing the CCL is a new light rapid transit line linking Tengah and Maju to the Greater Southern Waterfront, passing through the former spur section of the Circle Line and opening up new links as the west and south further develop, intersecting the circle at Holland Village and Prince Edward Road. Gone are the days of bottlenecks forming at intersections between the CCL and other radial rail lines — the upgrades have more than doubled the carrying capacity of the CCL, sufficient to meet its needs even for the next 20 years.\n\nTruly, a worthy project of our attention in the next decade, for better service in the decades beyond. Once the source of anguish from many commuters, the Ring, against the odds, had been tamed by its ribbon-bearing masters. At long last, one could finally say, with a sigh of relief and pride:\n\nCongrats, you have mastered the Ring!"
