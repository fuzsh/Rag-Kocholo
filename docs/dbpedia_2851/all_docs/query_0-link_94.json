        "text": "Just about two years ago, I re-imagined the MRT as a circular map, and posted it on my Facebook page. Within a couple of hours, this map went viral, both on Facebook and on Twitter. When I woke up the next day, sgag posted my map up and that was attracting thousands of likes and shares. Some of the comments were particularly hilarious to read, especially those who assumed that my map was the new design released by the LTA. Many comments were along the lines of “SMRT breakdown, increase fares, and now this confusing map?”. Some others realized that this map was not official, and began to engage it as a piece of creative work, critiquing the usability and design of the map. I was incredible surprised when my map was picked up by websites like coconut.sg and other bloggers, who then proceeded to write posts exploring the ideas of usability and design of subway maps. Although the hype surrounding my map died down after a couple of days, my map still gets revived from time to time and I see a spike on the visitorship count to the page with the map.\n\nI think it is time now to talk about my initial design motivations, and my design process in re-imagining the MRT map as a circular map.\n\nI have always been particularly curious about the design of subway maps. Why do some cities like London and Singapore have abstract non-geographical maps, while other cities like New York have geographical subway maps? Why do some systems show the bus and rail connections, while others keep them on separate maps? Why are some systems divided into fare zones, while others are not? I realized that the map itself is actually a window into understanding the designs and workings of the entire system. These design decisions are far greater than just a matter of aesthetics or taste; they reflect conscious decisions to represent the peculiarities of each system in the most legible and navigable way possible.\n\nOne of the greatest influences on subway map design has to be that of Harry Beck’s London Tube map of 1931. This map was an effort to disentangle the confusing complexities of the London Underground system into an easily legible and recognizable visual representation. It took its design from circuit diagrams. The premise is that since the system ran underground anyway, then the surface topography of the city did not matter as much. The only times when a passenger needed geographical reference to the surface city were the starting and destination stations. When inside the system, they just needed knowledge on how the lines interchanged, rather than knowledge of what is above them. The subway map was therefore a schematic that just needed to show how the elements of the system interacted with each other.\n\nThis idea was brought to its radical extreme by Max Roberts, who designed an entire series of circular subway maps of major cities such as New York, London and Tokyo. His maps an interesting thought experiment in wayfinding, as the exaggerated geographical distortions of his maps brought the Beck’s design to its logical extreme. No longer did his map display any spatial relations between the station and the surface; it fact, it did not even display the spatial relations between the different stations. Stations closer to the center of the circle seem closer together, while stations further from the center seemed to be more spread out, purely because of the geometry of the circle.\n\nThis degree of removal from geographical relations was unseen in any other design. Even Beck’s maps included geographical reference points like the Thames River, which allowed passengers to have some idea of how the underground stations related to the surface above.\n\nHowever, while it lost its usability, the circular maps gave a certain cohesion and order to the city that the other maps lacked. As most traditional cities grew organically outwards from a central core, this circular map style actually nicely demonstrates the radial axes of development in the city.\n\nI was inspired by Beck and Roberts’ work, and decided to give the Singapore MRT map a redo and turn it into a radial diagram. The Singapore MRT system is peculiar in certain ways that made it different from other subway systems in the world.\n\nFor example, although the entire island of Singapore is considered as a “city”, there were still distinctions between the “downtown” and the “heartlands”. Therefore, the station were spread out along an uneven distance, with greater concentration of stations with in the small radius of “downtown” Singapore.\n\nFurthermore, the development of Singapore did not radiate out from a central core in all directions. Instead, it began at the Southern tip of the island and radiated out to the North, the East and the West. Therefore, Singapore’s MRT system could not be placed into a complete radial circle.\n\nIn addition, at the center of the island, there is the central catchment area, and the North-South Line (Red Line) makes a loop around this area. This means that within the Singapore MRT system, there are actually three “loops” that the lines go around. First is obviously the (soon to be completed) loop that the Circle Line makes, second is the loop that the North-South Line makes around the central catchment area, and finally is the ribbon loop that the new Downtown Line makes around the downtown area. This meant that there were not easy loops that I can center the map upon.\n\nFor the end product I centered my map on the Marina South Pier station, which is currently the Southern end of the North-South Line. The Circle Line then forms some sort of a fan shape, which intersects with all the other lines in the system. Downtown Line then forms a central radial axis that separates the map into the East and the West sides.\n\nI hope that through my re-imagining of the MRT map I’m able to challenge people’s conceptions of transit mapping. Many times when we look at an official transit map, we think that that map is the way of representing the system. I want people to recognize that the map that they see is actually the result of many design decisions and conscious choices. I want people to recognize that every map involves some degree of simplification and distortion. I want people to think more about design in the objects that people come into contact with on a daily basis."
