        "text": "The North South Line was the first MRT line in Singapore. The line is currently 44 km long with 25 stations, and is operated by SMRT Corporation. This line is coloured red on the rail map.\n\nAs the name implies, the line connects central Singapore to both northern and southern parts of the island. Cross-platform transfer to the East West Line is provided at Jurong East, City Hall and Raffles Place stations, and North East Line at Dhoby Ghaut station.\n\nFurther Information\n\nThree batches of rolling stock are in service, manufactured by Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI), Siemens AG and another manufactured jointly by Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) & Nippon Sharyo.\n\nThere is one depot at Bishan on the North-South line, which has maintenance and train overhaul facilities.\n\nIn early weekday mornings, there are direct cross-over trains to the East West Line.\n\nIn late afternoon/early evenings, two limited-services are operated :\n\nMarina Bay - Yishun\n\nJurong East - Choa Chu Kang\n\nBishan is the only station on the entire MRT system to be at ground-level. Perhaps because of this, it is also the station with the highest number of accidents (most fatal) in recent history.\n\nStations\n\nNS1 / EW24: Jurong East (interchange with East West Line)\n\nNS2: Bukit Batok\n\nNS3: Bukit Gombak\n\nNS4 / BP1: Choa Chu Kang (interchange with Bukit Panjang LRT Line)\n\nNS5: Yew Tee\n\nNS6: Future Station\n\nNS7: Kranji\n\nNS8: Marsiling\n\nNS9: Woodlands\n\nNS10: Admiralty\n\nNS11: Sembawang\n\nNS12: Future Station\n\nNS13: Yishun\n\nNS14: Khatib\n\nNS15: Yio Chu Kang\n\nNS16: Ang Mo Kio\n\nNS17: Bishan (interchange with Circle Line)\n\nNS18: Braddell\n\nNS19: Toa Payoh\n\nNS20: Novena\n\nNS21: Newton\n\nNS22: Orchard\n\nNS23: Somerset\n\nNS24 / NE6: Dhoby Ghaut (interchange with North East Line and Circle Line)\n\nNS25 / EW13: City Hall (interchange with East West Line)\n\nNS26 / EW14: Raffles Place (interchange with East West Line)\n\nNS27: Marina Bay\n\nHistory\n\nNovember 1987: Yio Chu Kang - Toa Payoh\n\nDecember 1987: Toa Payoh - City Hall\n\nDecember 1988: Yio Chu Kang - Yishun\n\nNovember 1989: City Hall - Marina Bay (start of separate North-South and East-West Lines)\n\nMay 1990: Jurong East - Choa Chu Kang (initially operated as branch of the East-West Line)\n\nFebruary 1996: Yishun - Choa Chu Kang (the Woodlands extension)"
