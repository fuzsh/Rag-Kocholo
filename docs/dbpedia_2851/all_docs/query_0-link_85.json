More info at: sentosa.com.sg\n\nMarina Bay Sands\n\nIf you are not staying at the Marina Bay Sands then make sure to visit their skybar and restaurant Ce La vie to enjoy the spectacular city sunsets and skyline lights.\n\nMarina Bay Sands is linked directly to Bayfront Station on the Circle Line and Downtown Line of Singapore’s Mass Rapid Transit train system.\n\nMore at marinabaysands.com\n\nSingapore Flyer\n\nThe enormous observation wheel in the vicinity of the river gives you the perfect bird’s eye view of Singapore. The nearest MRT station is the Promenade station which can be reached via the Downtown Line and the Circle Line.\n\nBesides the observation wheel you will also find other fun-filled activities at the venue.\n\nMore at singaporeflyer.com\n\nAbout Singapore’s MRT map\n\nHow did it all start and what’s in scope for the future? Here’s some interesting facts about the Singapore MRT map and the Mass Rapid Transit system.\n\nIt all started in the early 1980’s when the first section of the MRT started operations on November 7th in 1987. It was a section of the red, North South line that spanned across six kilometres (about 3.7 miles) and consisted of five stations. Within the following year at the end of 1988, 20 more stations had been built. The final stage of the initially planned lines we’re finalized when the Boon Lay station on the East West line was consecrated a few years later, two years ahead of schedule on July 6th 1990.\n\nThe first MRT map Singapore displays the two lines stretching from east to west, and north to south with the additional branch line operated between Jurong East and Choa Chu Kang which was a seperate line until the commencement of the Woodlands Extension in 1996 when it was merged with the North South line.\n\nIf you would like to know more about Singapore’s MRT system in whole, then we recommend you to watch this informative video about “The World’s Most Innovative Metro System” made by the RMTransit channel on YouTube.\n\nOperation hours\n\nSingapore’s MRT system is split between two public transport operators. The SMRT Corporation Ltd (SMRT) and SBS Transit (SBS). The operation hours are the same for the entire system starting 5.30am and is operative until around midnight every day, weekdays and weekends.\n\nDuring the peak hours from 7am to 9am the train frequency is 2 to 3 minutes and approximately 5 to 7 minutes during off-peak times.\n\nTrain transport services from Woodlands North to Woodlands South on the Thomson-East Coast Line will close earlier at 9.00pm daily from Monday to Sunday. The services will also start at 6.30am on weekends (Saturday and Sunday), one hour later than normal.\n\nSingapore MRT Lines\n\nThe lines span in total over 200 kilometers (approximately 124 miles), spread across six lines with more than 120 stations. The MRT lines are estimated to double in range with a total length of nearly 400 kilometers (approximately 250 miles) by 2040. This will get accomplished by expanding the current six lines and building three additional new lines.\n\nSingapore’s MRT with all its transit lines combined, makes it the costliest, busiest, oldest and most comprehensive MRT system by length of route in all of Southeast Asia. And is also known for having the longest stretch of fully automated network of railway lines with driverless trains in the world.\n\nMRT stations\n\nTo make it easier for people to find their way down under at Singapore’s MRT stations, the stations do not only have names but are also given codes based on the line name and the order in which the stations are placed on the map for that specific line and route. Also the interchange codes make it easier to find stations where you can transfer and switch trains to another MRT or LRT line. (The codes are described further up on this page.)\n\nMost Singaporeans and tourists usually do know what the name of the station is where they need to go. But what they might not know about the station names is that some of them have an interesting history and background story for how it got the name that it has today. For example the station Dakota, in the Dakota region on the Circle Line was named after the numerous commercial Dakota DC-3 aircrafts. If interested there is an article about these stations at locomole.com\n\nAnother interesting fact regarding the stations is that most of the ones below ground are hardened and deep enough to serve as bomb shelters, built to withstand aerial bomb attacks.\n\nTickets, fares and services\n\nThere are several options for buying tickets for the MRT fares. Tickets can be bought at all stations from the General Ticketing Machines (GTM in short) easily with a Visa or MasterCard.\n\nFor tourists there is also the option of buying a Singapore Tourist Pass which is a special EZ-Link stored value card. The card can be purchased for one, two or three days and allows you to utilize the MRT and all other public transport options unlimited times during these days. Another similar option is the NETS FlashPay card which can be used for both traveling and shopping.\n\nThere are also smartphone app service options for your iPhone or Android device. SimplyGo is one option. Then there is also the SMRTConnect app designed to offer transport related information for iPhone and Android.\n\nFor more information and pricing please visit the Singapore Tourism Board’s webpage about how to get around in SG. There are also useful step by step guides on YouTube for how to buy tickets for the MRT and tips on how to get around with the trains."
