The network has since grown quickly in accordance with Singapore's aim of developing a complex rail network as the core of the country's public transportation system, averaging a daily ridership of 3.384 million in 2019. The MRT is known as one of the best rapid transit system in the world.\n\nIt is a rapid transit system which links the different places of Singapore together using a network, or different connections of trains. When a person travels from one place to another, he or she boards a train in a train station and then the train moves until the train reaches the place he or she wants to come out, or alight from. Sometimes he or she has to change trains.\n\nOverview\n\nAbout 3.4 million passengers use the MRT everyday.[1] The system is 231 km long and has 134 stations. Trains run from 5:30 am to 1:00 am every day except for the festive periods, such as Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve and Chinese New Year's Eve. A train comes every 2–3 minutes in peak hours, every 7 minutes during off-peak hours and 5–6 minutes for the weekend service. It is operated by Singapore's SMRT Corporation and SBS Transit.\n\nThere are currently 6 lines in the MRT system, where they are connected by special stops called interchanges. The lines are North South Line, East West Line, North East Line, Circle Line, Downtown Line and the Thomson-East Coast Line.\n\nOn 16 December 2011, the MRT network suffered what is likely to be the worst breakdown in its 24-year operating history. 'A power rail problem' made North-South Line trains suddenly lose power and stopped in darkness and without air conditioning for up to an hour accompanied only by light from mobile phones.[2]\n\nNetwork\n\nName and color Commencement Last extension Next extension Terminus Stations Length Depot Operator Control Center North South Line 7 November 1987 2 November 2019[note 1] 2030s[note 2] Jurong East\n\nMarina South Pier 27[3] 45 km (28 mi)[3] Bishan Depot\n\nUlu Pandan Depot\n\nChangi Depot\n\nTuas Depot SMRT Trains (SMRT Corporation) Kim Chuan Depot East West Line 12 December 1987 18 June 2017[note 3] N/A Pasir Ris\n\nChangi Airport\n\nTuas Link 35[4] 57.2 km (35.5 mi)[4]Circle Line 28 May 2009 14 January 2012[note 4] 2025[note 5] Dhoby Ghaut\n\nHarbourFront\n\nMarina Bay 30[5][note 6] 35.5 km (22.1 mi)[5] Kim Chuan Depot Thomson–East Coast Line 31 January 2020 13 November 2022[note 7] 2024[note 8] Woodlands North\n\nGardens by the Bay 9 17.2 km (10.7 mi)[5] Mandai Depot Mandai Depot Subtotal (lines under SMRT Trains): 101 141.9 km (88.2 mi)[5] North East Line 20 June 2003 20 June 2011[note 9] 2023[note 10] HarbourFront\n\nPunggol 16[6] 20 km (12 mi)[6] Sengkang Depot SBS Transit (ComfortDelGro Corporation) Sengkang Depot Downtown Line 22 December 2013 21 October 2017[note 11] 2024[note 12] Bukit Panjang\n\nExpo 34[7] 41.9 km (26.0 mi)[7] Tai Seng Facility Building\n\nGali Batu Depot Gali Batu Depot Subtotal (lines under SBS Transit): 50 61.9 km (38.5 mi) Total: 128[note 13] 203.8 km (126.6 mi)\n\nOpenings\n\n7 November 1987: Yio Chu Kang - Toa Payoh\n\n12 December 1987: Toa Payoh - Outram Park\n\n12 March 1988: Outram Park - Clementi\n\n5 November 1988: Clementi – Lakeside\n\n20 December 1988: Yio Chu Kang – Yishun\n\n4 November 1989: Marina Bay – Tanah Merah\n\n16 December 1989: Tanah Merah – Pasir Ris\n\n10 March 1990: Jurong East – Choa Chu Kang\n\n6 July 1990: Lakeside – Boon Lay\n\n10 February 1996: Yishun – Choa Chu Kang\n\n10 January 2001: Tanah Merah – Expo\n\n18 October 2001: Dover\n\n8 February 2002: Expo – Changi Airport\n\n20 June 2003: HarbourFront – Punggol\n\n28 February 2009: Boon Lay – Joo Koon\n\n28 May 2009: Bartley – Marymount\n\n17 April 2010: Bartley – Dhoby Ghaut\n\n8 October 2011: Marymount – HarbourFront\n\n14 January 2012: Promenade - Marina Bay\n\n22 December 2013: Bugis - Chinatown\n\n23 November 2014: Marina Bay - Marina South Pier\n\n27 December 2015: Bukit Panjang - Bugis\n\n18 June 2017: Joo Koon - Tuas Link\n\n21 October 2017: Chinatown - Expo\n\n2 November 2019: Canberra MRT station\n\n31 January 2020: Woodlands North - Woodlands South\n\n28 August 2021: Springleaf - Caldecott\n\n13 November 2022: Stevens - Gardens by the Bay\n\nExpansion\n\nThe MRT system only had two lines, the North South and East West Lines, for more than ten years until the opening of the North East Line in 2003. While plans for these lines, as well as those being built, were made long before, the Land Transport Authority's (LTA) proposal named \"A World Class Land Transport System\" in 1996 showed that the government wanted to greatly expand on the existing system.[8][9] The plans allow for the long-term replacement of the bus network by rail-based transportation as the main way of public transportation. It called for the expansion of the 67 kilometres of track in 1995 to over 360 in the year 2030.[8] It was expected that daily ridership in 2030 would have grown to 6.0 million from the current 1.4 million passengers.\n\nThomson-East Coast Line\n\nFor the sixth MRT line, the Thomson-East Coast Line, 91 four-car trainsets of CT251 rolling stock are built and were delivered between 2018 and 2021, and it began operations in 2020.\n\nNorth East Line Extension\n\nMain page: North East MRT Line\n\nTo be opened by 2024, the 2-kilometre extension will run from Punggol through Punggol North including the new Punggol Downtown. The extension is for future residents in Punggol North to have access by train to the city centre as well as other parts of Singapore.[10][11]\n\nDowntown Line\n\nFor the fifth MRT line, the Downtown Line, 73 three car C951s were built by Bombardier Transportation and began operations in 2013. An additional 15 trains and a final 4 trains were ordered, bringing the total number of C951s to 92 trainsets.\n\nCircle Line Stage 6\n\nMain page: Circle MRT Line\n\nTo be opened by 2026, the 4-kilometre extension will run from Marina Bay through Keppel, ending at HarbourFront, making the Circle Line a full continuous circle.[10][12]\n\nJurong Region Line\n\nMain page: Jurong Region MRT Line\n\nFirst proposed as a LRT line when originally announced in 2001, the Jurong Region Line is now going to be a medium capacity line. The new plan will serve West Coast, Tengah and Choa Chu Kang and Jurong. The line will open in stages from 2026.[10][13]\n\nCross Island Line\n\nMain page: Cross Island MRT Line\n\nThe 50-kilometre Cross Island Line will go across the island of Singapore, passing through Tuas, Jurong, Sin Ming, Ang Mo Kio, Hougang, Punggol, Pasir Ris and Changi. The addition of the new line brings commuters with another way for east–west travel to the current East West Line. It will also connect to all the other major lines to serve as a key transfer line, adding to the role currently fulfilled by the orbital Circle Line; the Cross Island Line will also become the first line to have interchange stations with all existing lines as of 2023. (Under construction lines included). The first stage will open by 2029, and other stages are expected to open by 2031.[14][10][15]\n\nBrickland and Sungei Kadut MRT stations\n\nOn 25 May 2019, the LTA announced two new stations to be built on the North South line. Brickland station will be built between Bukit Gombak and Choa Chu Kang, while Sungei Kadut will be built between Yew Tee and Kranji. Both stations will open in the mid-2030s.[14]\n\nPossible new line along north-east area\n\nIn the LTA's Land Transport Master Plan (LTMP) 2040, there will be studies to see if a new line can be built, between Woodlands, and Greater Southern Waterfront areas. If the line is built, it will be about 30 kilometres long, and will be completed as early as 2040. The line could serve around 400,000 houses, and lower the time needed for travel to the city by up to 40 minutes.[16][14]\n\nFacilities at the stations\n\nEvery station has ticket machines, restrooms (toilets), a passenger service center, which controls what is happening in the train station and has wired radio with the train operator, payphones (public phones) and access for disabled. Some of them have automated teller machines, kiosks and a bus interchange nearby.\n\nAll stations in Singapore are either elevated or underground, with the exception of Bishan. Underground stations and trains are air-conditioned and have full-height platform screen doors. Elevated stations have half-height platform screen doors.\n\nRolling stock\n\nA total of 12 types of rolling stock are used on the MRT lines. Almost all of them are powered by 750 voltage current from a third rail, except those on the North East MRT Line, which uses 1500 voltage current from overhead wires.\n\nNorth South and East West Lines\n\nFor the North South and East West Lines, seven types of rolling stock are used. The oldest is the C151, built in 1986-89 by a collaboration between Kawasaki Heavy Industries and three sub-companies, Kinki Sharyo, Nippon Sharyo and Tokyu Car Corp. 66 trainsets are in operation, which were upgraded between 2006 and 2008. 19 more C651s were purchased in 1994 from Siemens AG, followed by 21 more C751B sets, built in 1999-2000 by Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Nippon Sharyo. Two companies, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and CSR Sifang, have collaborated to build 3 types of rolling stock. The fourth rolling stock in operation is the C151A. They were built between 2010 and 2014, and started operations in 2011. The next rolling stock that started operations is the C151B, which began operations on 16 April 2017. The next rolling stock, being built between 2017 and 2018, is the C151C, and it began operations on 30 September 2018.[17] The newest rolling stock, the R151, began operations on 4 June 2023 on the East West Line.[18] With 106 trains ordered, it plans to replace the C151, C651 and the C715B.[19]\n\nNorth East Line\n\nOn the North East Line, 25 six-car trainsets of the C751A were built from 1999 to 2002 by Alstom. A further 18 trainsets, the C751C, were built by Alstom and Shanghai Electric and entered operation on 1 October 2015. A new model, the C851E, entered service in 2023, with 6 trainsets.\n\nCircle Line\n\nFor the fourth MRT line, the Circle Line, 40 three-car trainsets of C830s were built from 2005 to 2008 and began operations in 2009. Together with the C751Cs, the same companies made 24 C830C trainsets which began operations on 26 June 2015.\n\nFares and ticketing\n\nStations are divided into two areas, paid and unpaid, which allow the rail operators to collect fares by controlling entry only through the fare gates, also known as access control gates.[20] These gates, connected to a computer system, are able to read and change electronic tickets that can store data, and can store information such as the initial and destination stations and the duration for each trip.[21] General Ticketing Machines sell tickets for single trips or allow the customer to purchase more value for stored-value tickets. Standard tickets can be used up to 6 times within 30 days from the day of purchase.[22] The machines also allow the customer to buy more credit for stored-value tickets. Such tickets require a minimum amount of stored credit.\n\nAs the fare system has been connected together by TransitLink, commuters need to pay only one fare and pass through two fare gates (once on entry, once on exit) for an entire journey, even when transferring between lines operated by different companies.[21] Commuters can choose to extend a trip mid-journey, and pay the difference as they exit their destination station.\n\nThe ticketing system uses the EZ-Link and NETS FlashPay contactless smart cards based upon the System for e-Payments (SeP) system for public transit built on the Singapore Standard for Contactless ePurse Application (CEPAS) system. This system allows for up to 4 card issuers in the market.[23] The EZ-Link card was introduced on 13 April 2002 as a replacement to the original TransitLink farecard while its competitor the NETS FlashPay card entered the smart card market on 9 October 2009. The adult EZ-link card is at S$15 while the NETS FlashPay card is at S$13.\n\nSafety\n\nAssurance has been given by both operators and authorities, that many actions have been taken in an effort to ensure the safety of passengers, with SBS Transit having to make greater efforts in actively publicising its safety considerations on the driverless North East Line before and after its opening.[24][25] Safety campaign posters are highly visible in trains and stations, and the operators frequently play safety announcements to passengers and to commuters waiting for trains. Fire safety standards are about the same as the strict guidelines of the US National Fire Protection Association.[26][27] Platform screen doors are installed at all underground stations,[26] with half-height platform screen doors installed at all above-ground stations. These doors prevent suicides and disallowed access to restricted areas, as well as keeping normal temperatures in stations. Bylaws reduce uncivil, disruptive and dangerous acts, such as smoking, the consumption of food and drink, using safety features in an evil way, and unlawfully going onto the railway tracks. Penalties ranging from fines to jail are given for these offences.[28][29]\n\nSafety concerns were raised among the public after several accidents on the system during the 1980s and 1990s, but most problems have been fixed. On 5 August 1993, two trains collided at Clementi MRT Station because of an oil spillage on the track, which resulted in 132 injuries.[30] There were calls for platform screen doors to be installed at above-ground stations after several incidents in which passengers were killed by oncoming trains when they fell onto the railway tracks at above-ground stations. The people in charge initially rejected such proposals as they felt that the functional purposes were not worth the high cost of installation,[31] but changed their minds when the government announced plans to install half-height automatic platform gates in a speech on 25 January 2008, reasoning that worldwide installations of these gates reduced the market price for them.\n\nSecurity\n\nSecurity concerns related to crime and terrorism were not the biggest priority of the system's planners at its original creation. However, after the Madrid train bombings in 2004 and the failed plan to bomb the Yishun MRT Station, the operators deployed private, unarmed guards to patrol station platforms and check the belongings of commuters.\n\nRecorded announcements are frequently made to remind passengers to report suspicious activity and not to leave their belongings unattended. Digital closed-circuit cameras (CCTVs) have been upgraded with recording software at all stations and trains operated by SMRT Corporation. Trash bins and mail boxes have been removed from station platforms and concourse levels to station entrances, to remove the risk that bombs will be placed in them. Photography without prior allowance was also banned in all MRT stations since.\n\nOn 14 April 2005, the Singapore Police Force announced plans to improve rail security by creating a specialised Police MRT Unit, now known as Public Transport Security Command (Transcom). These armed officers began patrols on the MRT and LRT systems on 15 August 2005, conducting random patrols in pairs in and around rail stations and within trains. They are trained and allowed to use their firearms if they need to, including killing if necessary.[32]\n\nMass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Media\n\nOpening of the various stages (1987–1990)\n\nCanberra station, an infill station of the North–South line\n\nExpo station, situated adjacent to the Singapore Expo exhibition facility, sports a futuristic design by Foster and Partners for its East–West line platforms.\n\nBras Basah station consists of water features that allows sunlight from above to illuminate the station.\n\nWayside signal equipment used on the North–South and East–West lines, which include a two-aspect signal light and an antenna\n\nSeveral MRT trains and a Deli diesel locomotive stabled at Ulu Pandan Depot\n\nMap of the Downtown Line in Singapore\n\nMap of the Jurong Region Line including the proposed stage-4 extension to Haw Par Villa\n\nMap of the Cross Island Line, with phase 3 under planning\n\nRelated pages\n\nLight Rail Transit (Singapore)\n\nList of Singapore MRT stations\n\nList of Singapore LRT stations\n\nNotes\n\n↑ Canberra infill station\n\n↑ Sungei Kadut and Brickland infill stations\n\n↑ Tuas West extension\n\n↑ Circle Line extension\n\n↑ Circle Line Stage 6\n\n↑ Excluding Bukit Brown MRT Station, which is not in operation\n\n↑ Thomson-East Coast Line stage 3\n\n↑ Thomson-East Coast Line stage 4\n\n↑ Woodleigh station\n\n↑ North East Line extension\n\n↑ Downtown Line Stage 3\n\n↑ Downtown Line Stage 3e\n\n↑ Excluding duplicating interchange stations.\n\nReferences\n\nOther websites"
