        "text": "Update 23/6/2022: Don‚Äôt want to read through so much theory and just interested in the Singapore context? Check this post that classifies local rail-rail interchange stations by type üôÇ\n\nSince I‚Äôve just done a post on radically transforming Jurong East Interchange, I thought I might as well do a Basics post on interchange stations.\n\nThere are well-designed and poorly-designed interchange systems. All around the world. So today, I bring you on a tour, of all the train interchange types, and explain their worth. Are you ready? Let‚Äôs go!\n\nInterchanges: The Good\n\nFirst off I‚Äôd like to start off with the well-designed interchanges.\n\nIn order:\n\nPaired stacked-island cross-platform\n\nStacked-island\n\nSingle stacked-island cross-platform\n\nDouble-terminus triple-island cross-platform\n\n1 ‚Äì Paired stacked-island cross-platform\n\nI emphasize on the word paired for a reason.\n\nTake a good look at this picture.\n\nYou can pause to carefully peruse the image, but have you noticed one thing ‚Äì that it is possible to continue in any direction on the other line with this set of interchanges, just by walking across the platform at either station?\n\nFor instance, in the example above, travelling from Tseung Kwan O to Kowloon (by way of the Kwun Tong line) only requires you to shift your fat ass across the platform at Tiu Keng Leng station. Travelling from Kwun Tong to Hong Kong Island would only require you to cross the platform at Yau Tong station.\n\nSuch conveniences work because the station pairs are planned this way: there is one ‚Äúdirection-changer‚Äù station, which is the station where trains on the same platform arrive from different directions, and one ‚Äúdirection-conformer‚Äù station, where trains on the same platform pull in from the same direction, in the pair. In the case above, Yau Tong is the ‚Äúdirection-changer‚Äù station and Tiu Keng Leng is the ‚Äúdirection-conformer‚Äù station.\n\nSuch convenience is why metro systems around the world, if possible, always try to get this interchange configuration. Examples include:\n\nHong Kong MTR (The example above. They also use this configuration at the Prince Edward-Mong Kok pair)\n\nWuhan Metro (Please stop the jokes, thanks)\n\nSingapore MRT (They actually had decent planning in the early days. Can‚Äôt say so today)\n\n2 ‚Äì Stacked Island\n\nIn theory, this is the 2nd most effective station layout for interchange stations. To make a transfer, all you need to do is to get on the escalator (or the lift) and go one level up or down to the other platform!\n\nDespite being second-best in terms of transfer design, for very obvious reasons of convenience such a configuration is hardly ever used ‚Äì if the planners could go through all the trouble to align the platforms/tracks together so nicely, why not make that extra effort to turn it into an even more convenient cross-platform transfer? However due to circumstances (circumstances, yes) sometimes, well, they have to settle on this for various reasons. One of which would be when you‚Äôve got yourself one of the two lines ending at the station. To avoid ‚Äúmasochistic‚Äù rides (wink wink) there is no choice but to create a stacked island non-cross platform transfer. So here‚Äôs Yau Ma Tei, the former Kwun Tong line terminus interchanged with the Tsuen Wan line, south of the Prince Edward ‚Äì Mong Kok pair.\n\nOf course, if the planners understand how to use turnback sidings after terminus stations, they could still brute-force a cross-platform interchange at a terminal station, like at Tiu Keng Leng (mentioned above).\n\nThere‚Äôs also the new Hung Hom station, post Shatin-Central link phase 2 (opening 2022) that will feature such a configuration, for a different reason altogether: the Tuen Ma (West Rail and Ma On Shan lines merged) and the North South (former East Rail) lines have different train lengths which complicate things by a lot (8 cars on TML, and 9 on the NSL). Once the new station opens I‚Äôll update the photo below to make things much clearer for those not so well-versed with the HKMTR. (Edit 18/5: The upgraded Hung Hom station was completed on 15 May 2022 with the opening of the East Rail extension to Admiralty. Now it‚Äôs in a stacked island configuration)\n\nBut, like as I said somewhere out there before, such troubles are easily overcome if there is a will to give the People as much convenience as possible! Heck, for all we care we could get a cross-platform transfer between the JRL and the CRL at Jurong Pier, if LTA wants to. It‚Äôs a matter of mindsets on the part of the planners, at this point.\n\nAnd of course, a local example! Yay!\n\n(Thanks coshatiuav for the tip-off! E:D) Pasir Ris station, come 2032 with the opening of the Punggol spur, will also feature a stacked-island configuration!\n\nThe screengrab shows what appears to be the main CRL platforms and the Punggol spur platforms arranged in a stack island configuration, with the mainline taking the upper level and the Punggol spur the lower level, likely because of the Punggol extension having been chosen to terminate at Pasir Ris instead of acting as a branch line off the mainline! Yay, that means we can truly run the minimum headway across the entire CRL! However the transfer between the CRL and the EWL is‚Ä¶ not that great.\n\n3 ‚Äì Single stacked-island cross-platform interchange\n\nThis is by far the most common cross-platform transfer type seen in the world.\n\nWhen two metro lines intersect, it usually is very difficult to fit in a paired stacked-island cross-platform interchange. Most of the time, it is geometrically impossible.\n\nSo the planners come up with a compromise. The interchange is built on its own, and depending on prevailing traffic direction, the station could either be a ‚Äúdirection-changer‚Äù or ‚Äúdirection-conformer‚Äù station.\n\nHere‚Äôs another example from Hong Kong, Lai King station on the Tsuen Wan and Tung Chung lines.\n\nIn the example of Lai King, the station was designed so that passengers coming in from the Tsuen Wan line west of the station could get off and board the Tung Chung line to Hong Kong station (connected to the Tsuen Wan line‚Äôs Central station, but it‚Äôs a much faster ride).\n\nThe station underwent a transformation in the mid-1990s in preparation for the opening of the Tung Chung line. Prior to that, only the Tsuen Wan line served this station. Such a transformation involved adding new tracks and abandoning existing ones to create new service patterns. (For those who read my post on transforming Jurong East station, does this sound familiar? Yes, the Lai King station transformation was the inspiration of the Jurong East station makeover I proposed.)\n\nSingapore has a similar station too. (If you guessed Bayfront, you‚Äôre right!)\n\nBayfront was originally planned to be paired with Promenade as a paired cross-platform interchange, but it appears that LTA gave up on the idea altogether so today the station is a standalone cross-platform interchange. To switch directions, passengers have to transfer between the various levels.\n\nWhile Taipei is the most common user of this configuration (mostly because their lines intersect perpendicular to each other).\n\nWhere you can‚Äôt get double, just go for single. Many metros/commuter railways do this.\n\nEven the Americans, who suck at transit, did manage to get one too!\n\nAnd even Japan, who‚Äôs notorious for cooking up very complicated things like the Shibuya crossing and their complex pointing-and-calling systems (to be fair the Chinese ones are even more confusing), also mathematically gravitate towards stacked-island cross-platform transfers too! Here‚Äôs Akasaka Mitsuke station on the two major arterials of the Tokyo Metro, the Ginza and Marunouchi lines.\n\nSo that begs the question ‚Äì why the hell aren‚Äôt we doing more of them, if they‚Äôre so beneficial to efficiency of the network?\n\n4 ‚Äì Switch polytermini cross-platform interchange\n\nThat‚Äôs one confusing name there! What‚Äôs that? Visualise Jurong East but with the EWL also terminating there too. ‚ÄúSwitch‚Äù refers to the alternation of the tracks (across the station) between the lines terminating at said station while ‚Äúpolytermini‚Äù‚Ä¶ simply refers to multiple lines terminating at the station!\n\nThis arrangement is effective, because it is very convenient to transit between the two lines. Just walk across the platform (either one will do) and you will be on the other line! Though there might be a catch: if the frequency of one line is terrible, you can expect yourself to wait on the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù platform for a tad too long.\n\nThe only user of this arrangement is the old Hung Hom station in Hong Kong, prior to the Shatin-Central link phase 2 opening 2022 (again! HK is a master of effective transfer stations. But they also have the worst too)\n\nAt Hung Hom station, each West Rail line track is paired to a East Rail line track, to allow for a convenient transfer for those living in the New Territories to head to the Tsim Sha Tsui CBD.\n\nAlternatively a third island platform could have been built between the existing two and the ERL/WRL tracks arranged to form an alternating pattern.\n\nInterchanges ‚Äì the meh\n\nNext up are the more ‚Äúmeh‚Äù interchanges ‚Äì not very good, but not bad either.\n\nHere they are, in no particular order:\n\nDouble-island centric cross-platform interchange station\n\n‚Äú3+1‚Äù cross platform interchange\n\n‚ÄúAccidental‚Äù cross-platform interchange station\n\n‚Äú1+1‚Äù cross-platform interchange station\n\nOne-way polytermini cross-platform interchange station\n\n‚Äú1+2‚Äù cross platform interchange\n\nPerpendicular stack interchange\n\nSeparate platforms within short distance\n\nDouble-island centric cross-platform interchange station\n\nHere‚Äôs another mouthful to work with.\n\nThis kind of interchange occurs, mostly when a relatively minor line terminates along another line. The minor line in question would be inserted in between the two tracks carrying the other line (Hence the ‚Äúcentric‚Äù), forming a T-junction. You would see this in Tanah Merah station, Singapore (pre-2024, after which it will be transformed into the 3+1 configuration I will speak of later) as well as Jurong East station (pre-JEMP)\n\nHowever, this configuration does have a catch: when demand for the ‚Äúminor‚Äù line goes up, things get ugly real fast. Just ask the people who pass through Jurong East station (pre-JEMP of course!)\n\nAnd there‚Äôs another catch to this layout: Options to extend the middle line are severely limited without completely rebuilding the station or heavily modifying it. That‚Äôs why Jurong East, despite being a T-junction (which is mathematically bad), has stayed so for 30 years and counting.\n\n‚Äú3+1‚Äù cross-platform interchange station\n\nHere‚Äôs a meh solution to solve a pretty ‚Äòmeh‚Äô interchange system.\n\n(Edited to remove names and references to certain snowflakes out there, but they should know their plans are faulty at heart)\n\nAt this point I should say that triple-island platform configurations are the worst of them all ‚Äì arranging them in any configuration does not fully realise the potential of cross-platform transfer stations! Then, why are we still doing it, even when others have long ago given up on such a mathematically incoherent solution long ago? (Even Hong Kong gave up an entire rail line to avoid creating such monstrosities, re Choi Hung and the abandoned East Kowloon line project from the 1970s)\n\nSo, we‚Äôve got ourselves a double-island centric cross platform interchange station, with a line using the outer two tracks to pass through the station and another terminating using the middle track. Basically what I talked about above.\n\nNow fast-forward a few decades, without changing anything related to the station, or to the line design around the station whatsoever. Passenger demand in the area has, let‚Äôs say, tripled, and the station gets overwhelmed.\n\nThe local planners decide that they have indeed messed up by not looking far ahead enough when planning the terminus portion, and finally they decide to do something about it. That is, to create a turnback siding, the most efficient train termination method, in the center, while adding one new track and platform. Kind of resembling this.\n\nBasically you get yourself this.\n\nExcept, there‚Äôs a catch: Not everyone gets equal convenience in their transfers.\n\n(Note that in the context of Singapore where the above infographic was made, trains operate on the left, just like road traffic here. Therefore Platforms B and C are alighting platforms for the red line and D and E are the boarding platforms for trains leaving the turnback siding)\n\nConsider someone coming in from the red line, intending to transfer to the green line train on Platform F. As his train stops at platforms C/D, he is separated from his intended train by one track. The same works for passengers coming in from a train at Platform A intending to head to the red line. They‚Äôre, again, separated by the alighting track. Now even if we time the trains such that the middle two tracks are occupied at the same time, in essence forming a train bridge, such a plan is easily foiled once trains get crowded again, which happens all the time in big cities and smaller ones that don‚Äôt have planners that think coherently. If you think of the tracks as rivers and the presence of trains as temporary bridges to cross the river to get to the desired platform, then a crowded train is like an elephant on the bridge ‚Äì thou shalt not pass! Still, because there is cross-platform convenience for some passengers, it belongs‚Ä¶ here, in the meh category!\n\n‚ÄúAccidental‚Äù cross-platform interchange station\n\nNam Cheong station in Hong Kong, has a very interesting story to tell.\n\nWhen the Tung Chung line (together with the Airport Express) opened in 1998, it had only a few stations: Hong Kong (connection to TWL and ISL), Kowloon, Olympic, Lai King (TWL), Tsing Yi and Tung Chung.\n\n5 years later, the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation opened its second ‚Äúcommuter rail‚Äù line, the West Rail Line. Since the TCL/AEL construction had left a bit of land around the tracks, the KCRC, which was facing a bit of a financial squeeze, decided to ethically cut costs by building the WRL tracks right next to the TCL tracks. At the same time, there was rapidly rising demand in the area between Lai King and Olympic stations, which required a new station in between. KCR took the initiative to plant down a ‚ÄúNam Cheong‚Äù station there. The MTRC followed suit, and in 2003, the TCL and WRL sections of the station opened 4 days apart. The two stations were situated side by side, with a wall blocking access between the sections. Passengers had to tap out and in again to transfer between the two lines, similar to Newton station I‚Äôll speak of later.\n\n2007 rolled around quick enough. The KCR was merged into the MTR, with its assets transferred over to MTR for operations. At Nam Cheong station, we encounter a interesting situation ‚Äì the citybound TCL platform and the Tuen Mun bound WRL platform were barely a wall apart. Taking away the wall in 2007 opened a cross-platform interchange at Nam Cheong station, by sheer accident! (Lesson learnt: Don‚Äôt silo up your system with the various operators.)\n\nThough hardly anyone uses it ‚Äì unless they live in Tuen Mun and just came home from Disneyland.\n\nNam Cheong station also forms a ‚Äú1+2‚Äù configuration that I will talk of later.\n\n‚Äú1+1‚Äù cross-platform interchange station\n\nFurther down the Tung Chung line (bypassing Lai King), Sunny Bay station is another cross-platform transfer station too!\n\nThis station has a rather unique set-up (unique for the HKMTR, but this is far too common on mainland Chinese metros), consisting of 1 island and 1 side platform. The mainline utilises one track on the island platform, and one on the side platform, and the branch line takes the final track on the island platform creating a cross-platform transfer available between the two tracks sharing the island platform. In the case of Sunny Bay, the Tung Chung-bound and Disneyland tracks are placed together with the citybound track placed on the side platform.\n\nIt‚Äôs great if you are heading to Disneyland ‚Äì you get there faster because of the direct cross-platform transfer. Unfortunately, again the catch is that you‚Äôll have to climb a bridge to the other side if you want to go back to the city.\n\nIn the Sunny Bay example I gave above, the DRL terminates at the island platform, making it effectively a separate line from the Tung Chung mainline.\n\nAnother potential application of such a set-up would see it extremely useful in instances where lines are branched instead of having a spur line operate from the common point.\n\nTake a hypothetical situation where a line is going to branch into two.\n\nIn many cases, the choice is made to build a conventional island platform at the split point, (in this case, University station). And along it comes the hassle of having to assign destination tags to every single train that leaves the other end of the line, as well as installing complex PIDS systems across the entire line.\n\nBut what if we could vastly simplify everything, by offering a ‚Äú1+1‚Äù cross-platform transfer?\n\nIn this case, the island platform serves both outbound tracks ‚Äì it‚Äôs only a matter of whether one is travelling on the mainline or the branch. And since no one cares about where the train came from, be it mainline, branch, or heck, even depot, only one track is needed for the train back the other way. Simple as that.\n\nNow I just don‚Äôt get why most Chinese metros do it the slightly simpler way, and instead opt for a rather useless configuration: instead of the island platform hosting the two outgoing tracks in different directions it instead hosts two incoming tracks that go the same direction, and then stuffing the final track prior to the split on one side platform. Maybe I‚Äôll never know, but this was a severely wasted opportunity to make the experience easier to use, I suppose.\n\nThe big loophole in this would be that expansion options, again, are severely limited due to the single track configuration. However expansion is easier because it is always possible to retake the land beyond the branch platform for another side platform to be built (attaining the ‚Äú1+2‚Äù configuration I will talk about very soon).\n\nOne-way polytermini cross platform transfer station\n\nOut in the southwestern suburbans of Beijing, there is a rather unique method of interfacing the disjointed lines that reach far out into the Yantai and Fangshan areas, right into the heart of the old abode of the prehistoric Beijing Man in Zhoukoudian.\n\nFrom the National Library in downtown Beijing to Yanshan, the westernmost metro station in Beijing, one will never have to walk more than a few steps, despite having to transfer from Line 9 to the Fangshan Line, then to the Yanfang Line. How?\n\nHere‚Äôs a nice video from Welcome to Beijing, a channel that mainly documents rail transit in the Chinese capital. Below shows the diagram of how Line 9, Fangshan Line, and Yanfang Line are arranged at their respective termini.\n\nBefore I continue, let me address one potential question that many have bugged me over on Chinese metro line design ‚Äì why build 3 separate line when just one long line would do the job? Actually, it has got to do with the overcrowding that Beijing Metro is infamously associated with (wrongly, since it isn‚Äôt as bad as a few other capitalist-imperialist cities, wink New York, wink Tokyo) ‚Äì by splitting long lines up into shorter lines it prevents situations where passengers in the city fringe are unable to get on the train due to it already being crowded out by passengers from points further out, just think our East West Line being maxed out already at Jurong East. Splitting up the line essentially ‚Äúlevels the playing field‚Äù ‚Äì everyone has equal chance of boarding the next train into the city. Also, doing this is beneficial for long-term planning, especially if the interim lines intend to be extended to other regions for better network design. (Not shown in above pic: The Fangshan Line was extended into downtown Beijing by another route in December 2020, half a year after this video was published.)\n\nSuch a configuration is acheived by combining what would have been 4 side platforms into 2 islands, with one terminating track paired up to one boarding track, essentially doing what a ‚Äú3+1‚Äù configuration would do but better.\n\nIt combines the above-said practice nicely with convenient interchanging that passengers value tremendously. As one enters the terminus station continuation of the journey is acheived simply with walking across the platform to board the next train. So you would take the Line 9 train to Guogongzhuang, walk across for the Fangshan Line train, then walk across the platform once more at Yancun East to get on the Yanfang Line. Easy peasy.\n\nThe catch to this, however, lies in instances where the lines in such a system may get extended beyond the terminus station, which would reduce the effectiveness of the cross-platform system.\n\nTake for instance Guogongzhuang after the Fangshan Line was extended to Shoujingmao in the city as well. While alternate routes between the extended stretch of the Fangshan Line and Line 9 exist (thanks to the grid formation of the Beijing Metro), passengers travelling between Line 9 and the extended portion don‚Äôt have that much of a convenience anymore‚Ä¶ But then again, in a well-designed grid network system (as opposed to a radial system), alternative routes should exist that would not mandate the use of such an awkward transfer pattern.\n\n‚Äú1+2‚Äù cross-platform interchange\n\nLet‚Äôs take a break from Hong Kong and go to Malaysia instead.\n\nVising Kuala Lumpur, and navigating your way through the extremely confusing mess of transfer routes (sometimes nonexistent) between rail lines in the city, you might think that such level of planning wouldn‚Äôt have generated a cross-platform interchange.\n\nExcept it did.\n\nFar south of the city where hardly anyone goes (except for the trackbashers), the SPAD (think the Malaysian version of LTA) actually bothered to put up a decent connection at Putra Heights, where both the Kelana Jaya and Sri Petaling lines were extended to terminate at in 2016. Here, the KJLRT and SPLRT (no, not Singapore‚Äôs one) are barely a platform apart, the most convenient transfer in the entire Klang Valley rail network (barring the Kajang/Putrajaya MRT lines‚Äô cross platform transfer at Kwasa Damansara opening in 2021)\n\nBoth lines terminate at this station, easily allowing planners to place one track at each side of the island platform for the cross-platform transfer to take place.\n\nOne thing the planners were smart to take care of was possible future expansion. (Though I do not foresee either line being further extended due to the fact that they are already overstretched both in terms of capacity and line length.)\n\nBut in the rare event that actually happens, the station will form the ‚Äú1+2‚Äù configuration I have been speaking of earlier. 1+2 refers to the one island platform and 2 side platforms present in this configuration, where a cross-platform transfer is only available between two of the four tracks.\n\nNotice how a side platform (part of the ‚Äú1+2‚Äù) has been left on both sides to possibly allow more trains to terminate here should the frequency go up. Though it is not very possible here, as the KJL is automated and can time itself while the SPL frequency is constrained by the 3 min minimum headway on the mainline.\n\nThen again ‚Äì for systems that don‚Äôt utilise in-station turnaround procedures to terminate trains i.e. requiring an external turnback siding, the 1+2 cross-platform set-up comes with the risk of pairing the wrong directions together, leading to a case of alighting platform facing alighting platform, or boarding platform facing boarding platform, nullifying the half-beneficial effect that might have resulted as for the case in Yanshan above. Or setting up a pointless cross-platform transfer (example below from Beijing Line 1/BT)\n\nPerpendicular stack interchange\n\nThis one is relatively interesting, and thanks to Tenwer for reminding me that even side platforms arranged properly can make decently good interchanges.\n\nThere are two sub-types of this interchange, but due to their functional similarity I group them under one big type.\n\nFirst up, the ‚Äú1+2 stack‚Äù. Or, one island platform stacked perpendicularly to two side platforms.\n\nThere‚Äôs two examples of this locally, plus one on the U-Bahn in Berlin that I won‚Äôt go into since I‚Äôm not that much into European metro systems, that is the MacPherson and Chinatown interchange stations. Of course, if you ask me, one is obviously done better than the other (no prizes for guessing which is which).\n\nHere‚Äôs a rough layout of a ‚Äú1+2‚Äù perpendicular stack.\n\nIt‚Äôs immensely convenient, and to some extent it is as effective as a stacked-island transfer layout for lines intersecting perpendicularly to each other! The catch, however, lies in the fact that you have to be in the right portion of the train for this to be convenient for you. Take MacPherson station for example. If you were on the CCL heading for the DTL in the Tampines direction, the convenience isn‚Äôt much if you were standing at the Dhoby Ghaut end of the CCL train. (the Expo-bound platform is aligned to the HarbourFront end of the CCL platform)\n\nThen there‚Äôs the ‚Äú2+2‚Äù perpendicular stack formation, and yes thank you once more Tenwer for reminding me that perpendicular stacks exist, for I wouldn‚Äôt have thought of this one without your timely reminder.\n\nIn a 2+2 stack, instead of a single island platform paired up to two side platforms perpendicularly, the island platform is replaced instead by two side platforms, essentially giving 4 side platforms arranged perpendicularly to one another. In short, this:\n\nI‚Äôm not sure if there is even such a configuration in the real world, but here‚Äôs a virtual example of what I mean, built in Minecraft (Yes, the game is wonderful): link here. Once again, the catch is that one has to be in the right position in the train to acheive a convenient transfer by directly lining up with the stairway.\n\nSeparate platforms within short distance\n\nSometimes, when it is simply geometrically impossible to do a cross platform transfer, because of grade changes beyond the acceptable range of 7% for metro trains or 2-3% for railway trains, or because the lines were planned some time apart, it is necessary to mandate a bit of walking between the platforms of two lines.\n\nTake Bishan station for example.\n\nThe NSL was planned all the way back in 1980, while the CCL that opened much later was only planned for the first time in 1990. The Bishan section was only planned in 2000! That‚Äôs 20 years apart!\n\n(And this station was probably the last one to feature some farsighted thinking, knowing how the demand would shoot up in 20 years, they split the NSL island platform into 2 side platforms)\n\nSince the CCL was a fully underground line, there was no choice but to open the station as separate sections, separated by a short walk in an air-con (though somewhat musty) walkway.\n\nInterchanges ‚Äì the bad\n\nThere are a few interchange types that are really a hassle to move through. If you are carrying bags of Ikea goods, you wouldn‚Äôt want to make a connection here.\n\nIn no particular order, again:\n\nSeparate platforms requiring a travelator (Yes, that far)\n\nOut of system transfer within short distance\n\nPointless cross platform transfer\n\nSeparate platforms a long walk apart\n\nSeparate platforms multiple levels apart\n\nSpecial: Not having an interchange at an intersection\n\nSeparate platforms requiring a travelator\n\nSomehow the planners at LTA decided to completely isolate the NEL ‚Äì barring the LRT APM connections at Sengkang and Punggol, the DTL connection at Chinatown and the CCL connection at HarbourFront, all the NEL transfer stations are one massive pain to change trains at.\n\nThankfully, in the initial connections at Dhoby Ghaut and Serangoon, they did provide travelators so we wouldn‚Äôt practically die from overwalking! (Side comment: The distances covered looks sufficient for an APM system to be installed, lol)\n\nI can say with confidence that the team that planned the various aspects of the NEL practiced next-level silo culture ‚Äì absolutely no communication between the alignment-planners and station planners, resulting in absolutely WTF transfer mazes at such an early stage in the MRT system. (This type of labyrinthine transfer systems are usually only seen in advanced metro systems with more than 10 lines, where 4 or more lines meet at a major station, for instance in Shanghai and Beijing)\n\nThe same can be said of the later transfer stations built on the Downtown Line. Just try making a transfer at Bugis or Bukit Panjang while carrying your 10kg worth of groceries.\n\nOut of system transfer within short distance\n\nSometimes, when the planners decide to brute-force an interchange at a structurally minor station (i.e. no provisions left for future expansion), the only option is to create an out-of-system transfer i.e. transfer requiring commuters to tap out and tap in again.\n\nWelcome to Newton station!\n\nWhen the NSL station opened in 1987, no one would expect it to play the role of a transfer station ‚Äì simply because such a line didn‚Äôt exist anywhere in LTA‚Äôs books! Hence N4 Newton station was only built with one set of faregates and 2 exits, and all the critical machinery crammed into the southern end of the platform, leaving no space at all for a possible expansion.\n\n15 years later the Bukit Timah line (today merged into the DTL as DTL2) came into existence for the first time. Looking at the map, LTA probably realised they completely messed up their network projections, since Orchard was already taken by the TS6 project (later the Thomson section of the TEL), and Somerset and Novena were structurally dwarfs too. Hence they had no choice but to stuff the transfer at Newton.\n\nWhat makes the inconvenience of having to fish out your wallet to make this transfer worse is the massive level change present at the DTL side of the station! You literally have to go up 4 levels and down 1 level or vice versa to make a transfer? Does the DTL have triple-decker trains or something? No?\n\nSh*t!\n\nPointless cross-platform transfer\n\n13 October 2021 edit: This section is now irrelevant commencing 29 August 2021 as the Batong and 1 lines are merged. Trains now run through service at Sihui and Sihui East, removing the need for a connection here.\n\nIn all the past paragraphs I‚Äôve gone to long lengths to praise the effectiveness and convenience they bring about to passengers. And so, most readers would think I wouldn‚Äôt find any fault with them. Well, yes, they‚Äôre by far the best form of rail-rail interchanging possible. But it can also backfire, however good it may be. One such example for cross-platform transfers would arise when the cross-platform transfer function is meaningless to the large number of passengers using the station to transfer to the other line.\n\nAbove, I‚Äôve briefly mentioned the inexplicably incoherent method that Chinese metro systems carry out with ‚Äú1+1‚Äù cross-platform transfer configurations involving branch lines. So I won‚Äôt go into detail on that here.\n\nIn the Chinese capital, there‚Äôs one station that technically qualifies as a ‚Äòcross-platform transfer‚Äô station, yet the design has effectively made it pointless!\n\nI present Sihui East, the terminus station of Beijing‚Äôs Line 1 and an interchange with the Ba Tong line.\n\nSince again, no good diagrams exist to explain its set-up, I‚Äôll have to draw one myself based off Wikipedia‚Äôs primitive descriptions.\n\nAlthough only Sihui East has the ‚Äúpointless cross-platform‚Äù configuration I‚Äôve included Sihui as well, since without that it‚Äôs hard to understand the context of the set-up.\n\nSo let‚Äôs say, you‚Äôve read that Sihui East is a ‚Äúcross platform transfer‚Äù and you happen to be heading to the Tongzhou district from, let‚Äôs say, Tiananmen Square, which Line 1 serves. Obviously, you would be making a transfer at either of these stations. Reaching Sihui, your train pulls into the station and you still see that familiar DKZ4 or SFM04 train, so you realise, said cross-platform transfer is located all the way at the end, at Sihui East. Once you get there‚Ä¶ you realise that yes, it is indeed at cross-platform transfer, but well‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt get you where you want to go, unlike the set up in southwestern Beijing (see above).\n\nWhile there is potential for a vastly cheap and convenient cross-platform transfer system acheived using the 1+2 configuration that has been described above (see Putra Heights), the way this station was set up doesn‚Äôt exploit said potential properly! You see, the cross-platform transfer does not get you where you want to go, that is, further into the city, or further out of the city. Instead, it leads you back from where you came from, or in the case of transferring to Line 1, it lands you an illegal move of riding the train into the turnback siding and back. Considering the intellect the Chinese engineers usually possess, this reflects quite badly on them. Then again, considering the Batong line is as old as our NEL, and that the Chinese didn‚Äôt have the most advanced understanding of rail transit back then (they had only 7 metro systems them, one in each ‚Äúmunicipality‚Äù city plus Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hong Kong), maybe I‚Äôll let this slide. But when you consider that you can‚Äôt undo what‚Äôs already done‚Ä¶\n\nSeparate platforms a long walk apart\n\nImagine working along Orchard Road and living along one of the Bukit Panjang APM stations.\n\nWhat would your commute pattern be like?\n\nIs this your answer?\n\nWhat are the two stations you would have to transfer at?\n\nDid you say Bukit Panjang and Newton?\n\nWe have just covered how badly set-up the Newton transfer was.\n\nNow let‚Äôs look at Bukit Panjang.\n\nThe station, again another manifestation of LTA‚Äôs lack of foresight and abysmal planning skills, is a total nightmare to navigate through. If Newton was given a B3 grade (and that‚Äôs being too lenient), even an F9 grade cannot encompass the level of incoherency shown in the DTL terminus! (You‚Äôll need a G10 for that E:D)\n\nLet‚Äôs say you have completed a day of tiring work as a salesman in one of the top shops along Orchard Road and intend to head home.\n\nYou cram in to the NSL along with lots of others (it‚Äôs peak hours, remember!) and nearly doze off on the 2.5 minute journey to Newton station. Thankfully before you slip into your zzz‚Äôs the door opens in your face and the hundreds of commuters rushing out behind you jolt you awake.\n\nAt the faregates, you fish out your wallet and druggedly head down the steps to the DTL platform.\n\nLuckily for you, the next transfer station is at the end of the line. You get to sleep a bit.\n\nBut when the train pulls into Bukit Panjang, you have to count on the pushing force of the crowd rushing to cram their way onto a tiny pod aka APM ‚Äúfake LRT‚Äù. Why?\n\nThe distance between the MRT and APM station is simply, WTF!\n\nOr in more elaborate detail: From the Downtown line platforms at level B2, there‚Äôs the daunting massive concourse one level up. Then you have a few choices from there. The more direct path would be to go up the escalators, twice, to an extremely long link bridge on Level 2 that joins up to the mezzaine level of the APM station structure (newly added between the ground and platform levels just for a badly planned transfer), and finally up to where you need to be, the APM platform. Or take the more comfy but circuitous-as-hell option of going through Hillion Mall, attempting to navigate through the entire mess of a layout common in shopping malls, (good luck!) and then when you finally thought you cleared everything, having to detour through the Bukit Panjang Bus Interchange, and then making a few twists and turns through the corridor at the canteen end of the bus interchange, before finally seeing that familiar, packed-to-the-brim pod running on concrete guideways.\n\nAgain, this is NOT how you plan a well-integrated public transport system. Really, whoever who approved this entire mess to be named and packaged as an ‚ÄúIntegrated‚Äù Transport Hub, should really go back to primary school and re-learn their vocabulary! Is having to walk a combined total of nearly 1 bus stop (350m) between two lines ‚Äúintegrated‚Äù?\n\nDon‚Äôt believe LTA‚Äôs utter hogwash about ‚ÄúBukit Panjang Integrated Transport Hub‚Äù. If they can‚Äôt get the MRT/APM integration right, they can forget about integrating buses with rail. And in the above case, they have indeed squarely failed at such.\n\nSeparate platforms multiple levels apart\n\nAt this point, I should really say this: The DTL is the epitome of poor planning. The Rochor mess and the absolutely thoughtless interchanges are testimony to that.\n\nAnd welcome, my friends, to Promenade, where LTA forgoed a paired stacked-island cross-platform transfer (first with Nicoll Highway, then with Bayfront) for a stupidly clumsy quadruple stacked side arrangement (for those saying this is a mouthful, it basically means 4 side platforms stacked on top of each other, stretching to a depth of 43m, or about the length of 2 DTL cars end to end.\n\nThis really doesn‚Äôt need more explanation. Just imagine how cumbersome it would be having to go up or down 3 levels just to‚Ä¶ continue your journey.\n\nI should probably do a post on the shoddy way in which LTA dealt with the Nicoll Highway collapse. It was a wasted opportunity to more efficient transfers between MRT lines!\n\nSpecial: Not having an interchange at an intersection\n\nI briefly mentioned the Rochor mess previously.\n\nHere was a huge wasted opportunity to provide a multi-destinational system out of the MRT.\n\nThe DTL, for all its faults given how it was the result of haphazardly mashing together 3 MRT and LRT lines in the 2008 plan, gave us a present in its ‚Äúintersection‚Äù near the present-day Rochor station. Passengers transiting between the north and east of Singapore could have had a much faster and convenient trip if they were able to get off the train at the junction and board the train heading east, saving them the hassle of going through the entire loop in the city (mind you, this takes a while, at least 25 minutes)\n\nUnfortunately, LTA‚Äôs big brain planners decided to prioritise cars instead (wow silo culture again ‚Äì was there any communication that the goal was to march forward into being a car-lite society?), and they decided to place the North South Corridor (a major road project) right on the spot where this interchange station would have been placed. Best of all, instead of having a Plan B on hand to alter the DTL alignment slightly to avoid the clash, those same planners casually split the station into two, Rochor and Jalan Besar! Now while LTA prior to the opening of the DTL had at least tried to remedy such situations by placing down underground malls, like as they did with the CityLink between City Hall and Esplanade, to further the austerity drive of LTA (I‚Äôll do a post on this soon) passengers are instead forced to walk through essentially open streets! To make matters worse, there is absolutely ZERO signage pointing between the two stations. Or adequate protection from the elements (you have to count on the half-sheltering of Sim Lim Square, and it‚Äôs absolute GG if you didn‚Äôt bring an umbrella, because there are roads to cross!\n\nAgain, when seeing such horridly embarrassing planning fails on the part of our public transport planning agency, one can‚Äôt help but stop to wonder if those jokes equating the acronym LTA to the Hokkien term for car wreck are indeed true! Given how most of the planners drive to work instead of using the very same public transport they design, it‚Äôs quite telling‚Ä¶\n\nSo we end up with this.\n\nAlso, by the way, that 15-minutes grace-period-for-you-to-walk-between-the-stations kind of stuff is really a band-aid to mitigate the effects of a top-down screw-up.\n\nLess experienced visitors coming in without the knowledge of the out-of-system connection may choose to forego travelling on the DTL in favour of a more convenient cab instead. That‚Äôs probably a bad image of Singapore‚Äôs public transit to leave on them.\n\nInterchanges ‚Äì the absolute WTF\n\nWe‚Äôve covered the good, the meh, and the bad. Now here‚Äôs the stations you absolutely don‚Äôt want to get lost in. Else, it‚Äôs (in the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonight).\n\nHere they are:\n\nThe interchange that was not to be\n\nNon-existent connection between different stations\n\nExtremely long walk between lines\n\nTwo separately-named stations superficially joined together\n\nCompletely isolated lines where connection infrastructure is nonexistent\n\nThe interchange that was not to be\n\nNot just Newton station. I am speaking of cross-platform transfers hastily designed with no foresight at all. Like Jurong East. Someone definitely did not think about the demand in 30 years time. And to whoever came up with the Woodlands Extension, thanks for making CCK-Yishun rides shorter. But I‚Äôll also hand you the middle finger for causing the overcrowding mess in Western Singapore.\n\nWhen you do not plan stations for potential interchanging (much less becoming a major interchange station), you end up with overcrowding and not being able to get on the train. In a shellnut, the system‚Äôs efficiency goes down. Like a rock.\n\nIn a nutshell: Plan ahead. 50 years ahead. Think about all the possibilities the network could have in the long term. Because the beauty of a public transit network, does not lie in its cool tech (soon outdated), or its architecture (I doubt anyone appreciates it), but its connections, forming a well-integrated network with seamless transfers. A transfer is a penalty imposed on the passenger in return for a more effective network. So let‚Äôs strive to make this penalty as low as possible.\n\nAs a counter to what Singapore is doing, just look at the former Ma On Shan Line stations (Tuen Ma line stations north of Hin Keng): despite only serving 4-car trains at the start the platforms were already provisioned for extensions to higher train capacities, and not to mention how Hong Kong at least tried making a somewhat filmsy ‚Äúgrid‚Äù (if you can even call it one) by giving an alternate option down to the CBD. Singapore? Only one option to the CBD for Western side residents, I guess.\n\nNon-existent connection between different stations\n\nI mentioned how Hong Kong‚Äôs MTR is a prime example of excellent well-integrated interchange stations between rail lines. However, beyond that, there are a few bad eggs in the network which spoil this reputation.\n\nI invite you to Tsim Sha Tsui station.\n\n‚ÄúWait, what? Tsim Sha Tsui is interchange station meh?‚Äù you ask.\n\nWell, yes, but actually no, but actually yes.\n\nBecause other than the Tsuen Wan line section (which most people think of), there is an out-of-system connection to a not-so-nearby station on the former KCR network, East Tsim Sha Tsui. The walk takes 15 minutes to complete, and it is a huge mess!\n\nMarcus Wong from Checkerboard Hill describes the WTF interchanging in further detail here.\n\nIt‚Äôs a good thing that this fact is reflected on the MTR map.\n\nExtremely long walk between lines\n\nHK takes the cake here again! Although Singapore has some WTF long connections between MRT lines, you probably wouldn‚Äôt want to transfer here at this station. Still, it‚Äôs the most convenient and fare-saving of all connections between the pre-merger MTR and KCR networks, barring Nam Cheong (which I mentioned earlier)\n\nThe prize for the longest transfer goes to‚Ä¶ Kowloon Tong!\n\nOpened in 1982, the station linked the newly electrified KCR network to the MTR Modified Initial System (basically the Kwun Tong line and the Tsuen Wan line north of the common section)\n\nSo when the KCR opened the East Rail in 1982, there was a mad rush by the MTR to implement a transfer between the two systems! And when you rush, you know the result ain‚Äôt gonna be good.\n\nHere‚Äôs what happened as a result.\n\nI can hear the pain of the commuters being forced to walk through this damn passageway every day.\n\nReally begs the question: Why wasn‚Äôt the MTR platforms shifted westwards to make a ‚Äú1+2‚Äù stack? It would have been so much better!\n\nTwo separately-named stations superficially joined together\n\nWhat is this, you ask?\n\nBasically, imagine stations XX and XY within a short distance. But because some complete amateur quite literally ripped up the potentially decent plans that would‚Äôve been made, the stations are forced to serve as interchanges between their respective lines and making the connection involves passing through passageways in other buildings, like malls or parks or whatever they can cook up.\n\nWe just covered East Tsim Sha Tsui/Tsim Sha Tsui pair. However, there is one more TWL/KCR pair that is even more agitating when looked at.\n\nWelcome to Mong Kok East! (and Mong Kok, on the TWL/KTL)\n\nGreat, there is absolutely no information on how to change trains between the two stations! Because they aren‚Äôt even close together!\n\nJust look at the MTR map! Find Mong Kok. The find Mong Kok East.\n\nSh*t!\n\nThen there‚Äôs Kuala Lumpur‚Äôs way of interfacing the KTM Komuter (an absolutely horrid service in itself, don‚Äôt get why myRapid isn‚Äôt taking over) with the LRT lines at the various stops north of KL Sentral.\n\nLook at the Kuala Lumpur/Pasar Seni, Bank Negara/Bandaraya and Putra/PWTC pairs.\n\nThen there‚Äôs also a pair that has a similar situation to the Mong Kok/Mong Kok East pair I mentioned above ‚Äì Sentul and Sentul Timur (Sentul East) Different lines, similar name, still try to claim ‚Äúconnection‚Äú? (It happens: to ‚Äúrelieve crowding‚Äù commuters are advised to ‚Äútake another station‚Äù, sometimes one that is a good 30 min walk away. (Where are the buses when you need them?)) Thankfully the map doesn‚Äôt join in the misleading of the public.\n\nCompletely isolated lines where connection infrastructure is nonexistent\n\nWell, here‚Äôs the worst of them all.\n\n(Wait, let me insert another section, sorry.\n\nHonourable mention for worst interchange: Masjid Jamek on the KJLRT and AP/SPLRT.\n\nLayout: (Good luck figuring it out)\n\nOk, end of broadcast. Time to go back to the section on non-existent interchanges)\n\nLook at the areas I circled in black.\n\nWhat do they all have in common?\n\nIf you answered ‚Äúwasted opportunity to connect to existing lines‚Äù, you are absolutely correct!\n\nI have already dealt with the issue of the DTL ‚Äúcross‚Äù at Rochor station.\n\nSo I‚Äôll talk about the rest.\n\n(Also, by the way, have you noticed that most of them were caused by the DTL? I seriously wonder how this whole mess got approved)\n\nDTL ‚Äì NSL/NEL (Fort Canning ‚Äì Dhoby Ghaut)\n\nFirstly, if you know remotely anything about the area, you should know that stepping out of the existing Dhoby Ghaut station leads you to Fort Canning Hill directly.\n\nIf you didn‚Äôt already know:\n\nI understand that having more lines run through Dhoby Ghaut would cause pandemonium there, especially since I have spoken of how the NEL completely messed up the simplicity of MRT stations.\n\nBut wouldn‚Äôt it have been easier to shift FCN a bit further south, place the DTL under the CCL platforms at Dhoby Ghaut (in a 1+2 perpendicular stack), and shift Bencoolen to the area around Queen Street. That way, tourists stepping off bus 170 at its terminus would at least have an MRT to guide them around!\n\nDTL ‚Äì CCL (Bencoolen ‚Äì Bras Basah)\n\nI guess having to use the method above would complicate things here.\n\nBut again, poor planning forces you to walk through a damn university (I repeat, a DAMN UNIVERSITY) in order to get on the other line. I‚Äôm completely impressed. Not in the good sense.\n\nEWL ‚Äì CCL (City Hall ‚Äì Esplanade)\n\nAt least this one was semi-properly done, with a linkway through the Citylink (part owned by SMRT if I‚Äôm not wrong) so they can claim commuters are still walking on transit property.\n\nStill, it‚Äôs a decent 10 minutes walk from end to end. And that‚Äôs assuming you don‚Äôt stop to buy tidbits, clothes, or whatnot from the shops lining the linkway.\n\nBut most would rather just take the CCL to Dhoby Ghaut and take the NSL back down. And it takes about the same time too!\n\nDTL ‚Äì NSL/EWL (Downtown/Telok Ayer ‚Äì Raffles Place)\n\nThe joke is really on us.\n\nOur ‚ÄúDowntown‚Äù station, while physically located downtown, is just a forlorn minor station with absolutely zero connection to other stations that would make it truly the ‚Äúdowntown‚Äù station.\n\nI think Raffles Place deserves to be renamed ‚ÄúDowntown‚Äù instead. Just look at the sheer number of people passing this station during peak hours and you‚Äôll understand its significance.\n\nStill, that begs the question.\n\nIf we could at least bother to install a linkway as a band-aid to patch up our pants-down f-up at City Hall/Esplanade, why couldn‚Äôt we do it here? Especially since the name ‚ÄúDowntown‚Äù has a special significance in public transportation, i.e. that it is the centrepiece of the network. (In terms of linguistic skill this is probably the only aspect that the Americans have us beat) But LTA and gang have clearly not thought of that special meaning attributed to the word ‚Äúdowntown‚Äù, and thought it could be smacked on any station!\n\nThen, why don‚Äôt we rename Jurong East, or Punggol, to ‚ÄúDowntown‚Äù, then? Both see large amounts of passenger flow too!\n\nAnyway, back to the connection part. Unlike the City Hall-Esplanade pair which at least has a decently coherent linear mall (Citylink) joining them in a relatively unconfusing manner, the connection between Raffles Place and Downtown involves going through one epic mess of malls that were already there and stood in the path of a straight line between the two stations. The fact that it takes 20 min to walk through the tangled web of malls is quite embarrasing on us‚Ä¶ (Between Raffles Place and Telok Ayer? There isn‚Äôt even anything, so like the Rochor mess, you have to hope it doesn‚Äôt rain.)\n\nConclusion\n\nArranged in order of best to worst:\n\nPaired stacked-island cross-platform\n\nStacked-island\n\nSingle stacked-island cross-platform\n\nDouble-terminus triple-island cross-platform\n\nDouble-island centric cross-platform interchange station\n\n‚ÄúAccidental‚Äù cross-platform interchange station\n\n‚Äú1+1‚Äù cross-platform interchange station\n\n‚Äú1+2‚Äù cross-platform interchange\n\nSeparate platforms within short distance\n\nPerpendicular stack cross-platform transfer\n\nSeparate platforms requiring a travelator\n\n‚Äú3+1‚Äù cross-platform transfer\n\nOut of system transfer within short distance\n\nSeparate platforms a long walk apart\n\nSeparate platforms multiple levels apart\n\nNot having an interchange at an intersection\n\nPointless cross-platform transfer\n\nThe interchange that was not to be\n\nNon-existent connection between different stations\n\nExtremely long walk between lines\n\nTwo separately-named stations superficially joined together\n\nCompletely isolated lines where connection infrastructure is nonexistent\n\nBasically, in a nutshell, best to worst, condensed:\n\nStacked-island cross-platform transfers\n\n‚Äú1+2‚Äù cross-platform transfers\n\nPerpendicular stack transfers\n\n‚Äú3+1‚Äù cross-platform transfers\n\nStacked Island (non cross-platform)\n\nShort transfer walk\n\nLong transfer walk\n\nLong out-of-system transfer\n\nIntegrated only in name\n\nCompletely disjointed lines and stations.\n\nTo end off, here‚Äôs a photo of the best type of interchanging:\n\nIn comparison to one of the worst:\n\nLiked this article?
