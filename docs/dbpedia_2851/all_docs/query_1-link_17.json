        "text": "Following the Land Transport Authority’s (LTA) announcement in October 2015 that the future Circle Line 6 (CCL6) Cantonment station1 will be integrated with the former Tanjong Pagar Railway Station building, LTA has today called a tender for advanced works to dismantle, repair, and reinstate the former railway station’s train platform canopy structures. The canopy structures will be fully reinstated after the completion of Cantonment station in 2025, and retain the sense of heritage and memories of the old train platform area.\n\nThe old train platform canopies are important to the history and memories of Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, a national monument with deep historical, architectural and social significance. The decision to reinstate the canopy structures was taken following consultations with members of the heritage community, as well as detailed studies conducted with an architectural conservation specialist on its technical viability.\n\nAs Cantonment station will be built under the platform area of the former railway station and carefully integrated with the railway station building, about 290 metres of each old platform will be dismantled to facilitate construction works. The first 80 metres of each platform extending from the railway station building is unaffected and will be protected throughout construction works. See Annex A [PDF, 38.2kb] for the locations of the platforms.\n\nCanopy structures to be carefully dismantled, repaired and fully reinstated\n\nStarting from the fourth quarter of this year, the appointed contractor will dismantle the canopy structures – comprising the roof, beams and columns, and store them at a nearby restoration yard. The appointed contractor will then repair and restore the structures, and reinstate them with reconstructed platform slabs in 2025 after the Cantonment station has been completed.\n\nAgencies and LTA’s appointed architectural conservation specialist will work closely with the appointed contractor to ensure that the affected canopy structures are sensitively treated and reintegrated with the rest of the platforms. See Annex B [PDF, 44kb] for an illustration on the parts of the affected platforms.\n\nMr Ho Weng Hin, Partner of Studio Lapis, an architectural conservation specialist consultancy firm said: \"The method of dismantling, restoring, and reinstating the platform structures was developed over months to concentrate on the canopy structures, which are of high heritage and architectural significance. This was done after conducting heritage surveys, studying existing conditions, and working with various parties to review the pros and cons of alternative strategies. The delicate ornamental antefixes will be separately dismantled first for protection, while canopy segments are braced and protected to ensure their integrity in transportation and storage. The platform base will be reconstructed to its original design and profile, incorporating two salvaged historic panels which have the length of the platforms stencilled on them.”\n\nEnhancing travelling experience and encouraging community use of historic railway station\n\nWith the integration of new and old train stations, residents and workers in the area will not only enjoy greater transport accessibility and connectivity, but also a unique travelling experience. The design of Cantonment station’s premises will take into consideration the existing design of the historic railway station, merging the past and present to create a unique environment that reflects the rich historical value of the National Monument.\n\nAs part of the Urban Redevelopment Authority’s plans for the Rail Corridor, Tanjong Pagar Railway Station will be used as a multi-functional community building for 20 years after the new MRT station is completed. The MRT station will give it a new lease of life, and contribute to making the railway station a highly-accessible and vibrant community node of the Rail Corridor.\n\nPublic open house of Tanjong Pagar Railway Station to continue until 25 December 2016\n\nIn response to the keen interest among Singaporeans to visit Tanjong Pagar Railway Station, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) has opened the State property on every public holiday since February 2015. SLA will continue to do so on every public holiday this year until Christmas Day (25 December 2016).\n\nTo facilitate the advanced works and subsequent MRT station construction, the railway station will be closed from 26 December 2016 until the completion of Cantonment station in 2025. Maintenance and stabilisation works will be carried out on the railway station building and mitigation measures put in place to protect it during construction works. LTA will also put in place measures to minimise any potential inconvenience and disturbances to residents and businesses nearby."
