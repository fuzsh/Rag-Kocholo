They may also refer to LTAâs MyTransport.SG mobile app and LTAâs and SMRTâs social media platforms for more details.\n\nThere will also be posters and station announcements at all CCL MRT stations and selected stations on other MRT lines that interchange with CCL stations.\n\nStation staff will also be deployed to help out at affected stations.\n\nMaintenance works\n\nAccording to a May 24 announcement by the Land Transport Authority (LTA), the service adjustments are to facilitate additional maintenance works along a tunnel segment between Promenade and Nicoll Highway stations.\n\nBased on routine inspections conducted by LTA and public transport operators, a small segment of the tunnel between Promenade and Nicoll Highway stations had been \"subject to greater pressure\".\n\nThere are no safety risks to CCL train operations, but precautionary maintenance and strengthening works will be carried out.\n\nThis includes the installation of steel supports to tunnel rings to ensure the tunnel's long-term integrity.\n\nLTA and the operators will continue to regularly monitor tunnels as part of their maintenance regime.\n\nTop image via Unsplash/Kit Suman"
