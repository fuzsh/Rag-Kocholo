        "text": "SINGAPORE – Train services on the Circle and Thomson-East Coast lines will end earlier on some days, and a platform each at three Circle Line stops will shut temporarily as part of a string of changes between October and May 2024 for rail expansion work.\n\nThe Land Transport Authority (LTA) and rail operator SMRT said on Thursday that the changes are to integrate Stage 6 of the Circle Line (CCL) and Stage 4 of the Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) with the existing network.\n\nOver four Sundays – Oct 15, 22 and 29 and Nov 5 – CCL services will end at 10pm, instead of as late as 12.38am, to allow the testing of a new automatic train supervision system. This system regulates the movement of driverless trains and is a key part of the line’s signalling system.\n\nThe early closures will affect about 13,700 passengers on each of the four Sundays.\n\nLTA and SMRT said the new supervision system will enable the operation of 23 new trains, three new stations and the expanded Kim Chuan Depot when Stage 6 of the CCL starts operations.\n\nEstimated to be completed by 2026, this extension will add three stops between HarbourFront and Marina Bay, closing the loop for the line.\n\nTo allow track work to connect the extension with the CCL’s HarbourFront station, one platform each at HarbourFront, Telok Blangah and Labrador Park stations will be closed temporarily from Jan 20 to May 24, 2024. This will affect an average of 43,000 passengers daily.\n\nA shuttle train will operate on the other platform between HarbourFront and Labrador Park, which is two stops away, at 10-minute intervals, LTA and SMRT said.\n\nLTA said the extensive work at HarbourFront would involve many contractors, and entail removing and replacing a portion of the track and cables. This includes hacking concrete on the track bed, and installing signalling cables and trackside equipment, as well as reconnecting the rails and testing.\n\nSeparately, instead of turning around at HarbourFront, CCL trains will do so alternately at Kent Ridge and Labrador Park to maintain peak-hour intervals at the busy stretch from Kent Ridge to Paya Lebar.\n\nAt peak hours, commuters can expect train intervals of about five minutes at stops between Kent Ridge and Labrador Park, said LTA and SMRT.\n\nAs an alternative to the CCL during the platform closure, commuters can use 11 public bus services (10, 30, 57, 61, 93, 97, 100, 143, 166, 188 and 963).\n\nIn all, the TEL service changes will affect about 19,200 commuters every weekend.\n\nLTA and SMRT said this is to allow the rigorous integrated testing of systems from Stages 1 to 4 of the TEL to prepare for the opening of Stage 4 in 2024.\n\nThe TEL is being built in five stages, and the eight-station Stage 4 runs from Founders’ Memorial to Bayshore. The Founders’ Memorial stop will start operations in tandem with the memorial’s expected opening in 2027.\n\nTwo shuttle bus services will serve commuters inconvenienced by the late opening. These will ply between Woodlands North and Caldecott, and between Caldecott and Outram Park, at intervals of five to 10 minutes.\n\nThere will not be shuttle bus services for commuters affected by the early closure.\n\nMr Yee Boon Cheow, LTA’s group director of rail (electrical and mechanical), said the late opening and early closure times were determined based on ridership data on the CCL and TEL to minimise impact on commuters.\n\nSome commuters The Straits Times interviewed were concerned about the inconvenience and extra travelling time the upcoming changes would bring.\n\nStudent Chan Jun Hao, 22, said the TEL’s early closure would be “very troublesome” because after 11.30pm, he would have to take a detour to reach his home in Bright Hill from Dhoby Ghaut, which he frequents for his part-time job and leisure.\n\nThe detours via the North-South Line and a bus transfer would add 20 minutes to his journey."
