They offer air-conditioned carriages, regularly scheduled trains, convenient locations and don’t freak out… They’re driverless!\n\nThe Singapore Metro is referred to as the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT). It has certainly earned the title of Mass Rapid Transport supporting 200,000 daily commuters!\n\nSingapore Metro – Finding a Metro Station in Singapore\n\nSingapore Metro – Cost of Riding Singapore Metro\n\nSingapore Metro – Buying a Ticket\n\nSingapore Metro – Singapore’s Metro Lines\n\nAs of this year, there are 122 MRT stations spread across six different tracks (lines) making up a total of 203 kilometres (126 miles).\n\nThe Singapore government has announced they want to double this length to 400 kilometres by 2040.\n\nBefore we talk about each of the Singapore metro lines, let’s talk about the basics of what you need to know for getting a metro in Singapore.\n\nHow to Find a Metro Station in Singapore?\n\nA better question is how could you not? They’re everywhere!\n\nYour first and best option is to simply look around on street corners for a sign pointing toward a metro stop.\n\nThey usually include the distance in meters as well.\n\nDiscover the fastest route to get to your destination with the Explore Singapore App!\n\nThe second option is to ask someone. Singaporeans are incredibly friendly and always happy to foreign guests in their country.\n\nWorried about not understanding the language? The vast majority of Singaporeans are bilingual! Discover more about Singapore’s Languages.\n\nThe final option for finding a metro stop in Singapore is Google/Apple maps!\n\nThat’s right folks, Singapore is NOT China. There’s no need to check the blocked sites of China because you’ll have access to all the apps you know and love.\n\nSingapore Language // The Simple Guide to the Languages of Singapore\n\nSingapore Language Simplified | A Complete Guide To understand Singapore language it is important to understand the history, geography and politics that have contributed to Singapore’s language. The short answer to what is the Singapore language is, there are four…\n\nHow Much Does Singapore Metro Cost?\n\nIt’s unbelievably cheap! And here is why:\n\nThis Singapore government does NOT want its roads congested with cars. In fact, to detour car ownership they’ve put a hefty $35,000 SGD ($25,253 USD) + 100% tax on top of the original price of the car. #SingaporeFactNO.25\n\nWhen you see that $200,000 Ferrari drive by (and you will) take a minute to appreciate how much it would have really cost!\n\nEssentially, the government was steering people away from the roads (pun intended) and onto their public transport system.\n\nTo ensure the average commuter wouldn’t get the short end of the stick, they made Singapore’s public transport incredibly efficient.\n\nBecause of this ticket prices on the Singapore metro range from:\n\nPrices vary depending on the distance travelled. Personally, I’ve never paid more than $2 ($1.44 USD) for any distance travelled.\n\nHow to Buy a Singapore Metro Ticket?\n\nWhen it comes to ticketing on Singapore’s metro, there are 3 options:\n\nEZ-Link\n\nTourist Pass\n\nStandard Ticket\n\nHere’s our breakdown of all the metro cards and why we think the EZ-Link should be your first choice before getting on the metro.\n\nHowever, it really depends on how long you’ll be staying in Singapore and how many train and bus rides you wish to take.\n\nSingapore MRT: EZ-Link Card\n\nFirst and most important thing to note:\n\nYou CAN’T buy an EZ-Link or Tourist Pass at all metro stops. You must be at one of the following:\n\nYou can also purchase an EZ-Link card from 7-Eleven.\n\nIf you purchase an EZ-Link card from one of the above Singapore metro stations, it will cost you $12.\n\nThis includes five Singapore Dollars (non-refundable) for the card and seven dollars will be added to the card for travel.\n\nIf purchased from 7-Eleven, same deal but it will cost you $10. Five for the card, five dollars credit added.\n\nYou can top up your EZ-Link at any metro station using one of these machines.\n\nDear Singapore Police: That sticker we added was done in photoshop!\n\nPutting stickers around town is considered vandalism and can result in $2,000 fines! Probably a contributing factor to Singapore’s pristine condition.\n\nSingapore Metro: Tourist Pass\n\nThe Singapore Tourist Pass (STP) gives you unlimited travel for up to three days. It’s price ranges from:\n\n1 day $10\n\n2 days $16\n\n3 days $20\n\nThe Singapore Tourist pass only really makes sense if you are in town for one day. Two to three days on the island you would have to be absolutely slamming the Singapore metro and busses to get your money’s worth.\n\nFor four or more days in Singapore, get an EZ-Link!\n\nCheck out our guides to the Beijing and Shanghai metros as well.\n\nStandard Ticket\n\nA standard ticket, as the name would imply, is pretty standard. Unlike the plastic EZ-Link and Tourist Pass, it’s made from paper so their deposit is much cheaper: 10c and this one is refundable. You can reload money onto them but they can only be used 6 times in a 30 day period.\n\nThey are more convenient because they can be purchased from any metro station. However, it can get annoying constantly having to line up at a machine before you commute.\n\nSingapore’s Metro Lines\n\nHere’s the breakdown of all the Singapore Metro lines:\n\nEast-West Line (Green)\n\nNorth-South Line (Red)\n\nNorth-East Line (Purple)\n\nCircle Line (Yellow)\n\nDowntown Line (Blue)\n\nThomson-East Coast Line (Brown)\n\nTo help visualise Singapore’s Metro lines we’ve placed it over Google maps.\n\nIt can be disorientating entering and exiting the metro so hopefully this will help.\n\nEast-West Line (Green)\n\nEast-West Line as you probably guessed takes you as far East as you can go on the metro (Changi Airport) to as far West as you can go (Tuas Link).\n\nNumber of stations: 35\n\nTime to travel: 77 minutes\n\nDistance: 57.2 kilometres (35.5 miles)\n\nMost of the Green Line is above ground! Meaning you get a petty good tour of the city the moment you get on the train from the airport. The only section below ground is between Lavender station to Tiong Bahru.\n\nStops on the Green Line:\n\nCool stuff on the green line.\n\nEverything between Bugis to Tiong Bahru and you’re in the middle of the action! Get out there and start exploring.\n\nTake a closer look at where all the Singapore metro lines can take you over the island.\n\nNorth-South Line (Red)\n\nThe North-South Line takes you North and South (obviously). However, take a closer look as it does a loop around the north of the island before coming back down.\n\nNumber of stations: 29\n\nTime to travel: 64 minutes\n\nDistance: 45 kilometres (28 miles)\n\nStops on the red line:\n\nCool stuff on the red line:\n\nThere should be two stations jumping out at you right now! Orchard and Marina Bay. Orchard station connecting with Singapore’s very famous lifestyle of the rich and the famous shopping street Orchard road. Marina Bay connecting to the also very infamous Marina bay sands hotel.\n\nNorth-East Line (Purple)\n\nThe North-East line doesn’t mean the line goes from North to East, but rather it heads in a Northeasterly direction.\n\nNumber of stations: 16\n\nTime to travel: 33 minutes\n\nDistance: 19.2 kilometres (11.9 miles)\n\nThe Purple Line is the second smallest line on the island, however it’s strategically very well placed to help commuters change lines.\n\nStops on the purple line:\n\nCool stuff on the purple line:\n\nTalk about worlds colliding? Chinatown and Little India are on the same line on Singapore metro! These two locations are an absolute must for any traveller of Singapore.\n\nNeed more reasons to visit?\n\nCircle Line (Yellow)\n\nThe circle line is (you guessed it) in the shape of a circle. It is most likely you wouldn’t need to complete a loop of the circle line with green, red, purple, blue and soon to be brown all offering fast trips across the circle.\n\nHowever, don’t underestimate the circle line’s wonderful offerings.\n\nNumber of stations: 30\n\nTime to travel: 65 minutes\n\nDistance: 35.5 kilometres (22.1 miles)\n\nStops on the yellow line:\n\nCool stuff on the yellow line:\n\nOf course, the station name that should be jumping out here is Botanic Gardens. It’s a UNESCO World Heritage Site and absolutely stunning. Another stop close to my heart is Holland Village. It’s got a great expat community there so you’ll find great western bars and cafes.\n\nDowntown Line (Blue)\n\nAs Mr Wilhelm would say “it’s all downtown”. That was true on Seinfeld in 1996 and it’s true in Singapore today!\n\nThe Downtown line as you’ve probably guessed it the best way to get Downtown. Everyone in the cooperate world of Singapore is on the Singapore metro heading Downtown during peak hour. You’ve been warned!\n\nNumber of stations: 34\n\nTime to travel: 75 minutes\n\nDistance: 41.9 kilometres (26.0 miles)\n\nStops on the blue line:\n\nCool stuff on the blue line:\n\nIf you’re feeling hungry then it’s a great time to be Downtown (literally). Go to the Downtown station and cross the street to Telok Ayer Market, one of Singapore’s oldest and biggest hawker centres!\n\nBayfront offers an incredible view of the Singapore skyline and you’ll get to see an incredible water show with fountains and projectors played in the bay every night.\n\nLastly, Bugis is another great area to explore with temples, shops and one of Singapore’s biggest markets.\n\nThomson-East Coast Line (Brown)\n\nThe final and smallest Singapore metro is the Thomson-East Coast Line. It is currently only 3 stops long (Woodlands North, Woodlands and Woodlands South). However, this line is not to be underestimated!\n\nOnce completed it will be 43 kilometres (27 miles) and connect with all other lines! To be continued…\n\nSingapore Metro – FAQ’s\n\nHow much does it cost to ride the Singapore Metro\n\nAdult fares cost anywhere between SGD $0.92 – $2.17 depending on the distance travelled.\n\nWhat time does the Metro close in Singapore?\n\nTypical operating hours are between 5:30am to 12:30am with extensions given on public holidays.\n\nHow many Metro Stations in Singapore?\n\nCurrently, there are 122 MRT stations spread across six different tracks (lines) making up a total of 203 kilometres (126 miles).\n\nAre there any trains out of Singapore?\n\nThere are no trains directly out of Singapore.\n\nHowever, with a short bus ride over the Singapore-Malaysia bridge to Johor Bahru (Malaysia), you’ll have all sorts of options across Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and more!\n\nWant more from LTL?\n\nIf you wish to hear more from LTL Mandarin School why not join our mailing list.\n\nWe give plenty of handy information on learning Chinese, useful apps to learn the language and everything going on at our LTL schools!\n\nSign up below and become part of our ever growing community!"
