It is built underneath the junction of Bras Basah Road, Raffles Boulevard and Nicoll Highway, and serves the surrounding district within the Downtown Core planning area.\n\nThe station gets its name from the nearby iconic performing arts centre, Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay, while serving nearby landmarks such as Raffles City, Raffles Hotel, Civilian War Memorial, South Beach, Suntec Convention Centre and One Raffles Link.\n\nBelow ground, a network of pedestrian underpasses connect the station to nearby developments.

Consisting of a set of seven pieces of wood block prints depicting various aspects of theatre, the artwork is a collage of early and later works by the renowned artist who passed away soon after the completion of this commission.
