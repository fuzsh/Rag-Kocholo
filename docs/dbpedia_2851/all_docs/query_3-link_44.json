        "text": "The Downtown Line is a 40km line that will facilitate direct travel from the northwestern and eastern areas of the island to the Central Business District (CBD) and Marina Bay. The Line will also provide a strategic transport link to support the development of the Marina Bay area. The Line, which will run largely underground with a fully automated system, will be built in three stages.\n\nSembawang E&C undertook this contract worth S$463 million, with the scope of the Contract covering the construction and completion of the Bayfront Station including associated tunnels. The Bayfront Station will serve as an interchange station for the Circle and Downtown Lines with the stationâ€™s twin-stacked tunnels connected to the Marina Bay and Landmark Stations.\n\nThe northern end of the Bayfront Station tunnel will be designed and constructed by the developer of the Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort, the Las Vegas Sands Corporation."
