Traveling from one end to the other takes about 60 minutes. The line is currently 34.6 km long with 30 stations and it is fully underground and automated.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nDate Event 28 May 2009 Bartley - Marymount 17 April 2010 Dhoby Ghaut - Bartley 8 October 2011 Marymount - HarbourFront 14 January 2012 Promenade - Marina Bay\n\nCircle Line 6[edit]\n\nOn 17 January 2013, the Land Transport Authority announced Circle Line 6 which will close the circle, running between Marina Bay and HarbourFront. It will be a 4 km extension with 3 stations, slated to be completed by 2026.[1][2]\n\nNicoll Highway Collapse[edit]\n\nOn 20 April 2004 at 3.30pm, the construction site of the Nicoll Highway station collapsed, apparently when a retaining wall used in the tunnel's construction gave way. The accident left a collapse zone 150m wide, 100m long, and 30m deep. Four workers were killed, with three more injured and one body which was never recovered.[3] Consequently, the station site was moved around 100m south of the initial location. Moreover, the tunnels between Promenade and Stadium were constructed on an alignment that bypassed the collapsed area.[4] The collapse also resulted in the completion of Circle Line 1 being pushed back from 2008 to 2010.\n\n2016 train disruptions[edit]\n\nIn late August 2016, intermittent signal interference led to a five-day series of train disruptions. The issue reappeared again in November.[5][6] A team of data scientists explored the data and discovered via a Marey Chart visualization that it was caused by hardware problems, sending errant signals from a \"rogue\" 830C train (846).[7]\n\nStations[edit]\n\nRolling stock[edit]\n\nThe rolling stock consists of Alstom Metropolis 830 and Alstom Metropolis 830C trains. These trains operate from Kim Chuan Depot near Tai Seng station.\n\nReferences[edit]\n\nMass Rapid Transit [ V • T • ] Overview History • Stations • Fare and Ticketing • Facilities • Safety • Security Lines North–South Line • East–West Line • North East Line • Circle Line • Downtown Line • Thomson–East Coast Line FutureJurong Region Line • Cross Island Line Rolling Stocks 151 • 151A • 151B • 151C • R151 • T251 • 651 • 751A • 751B • 751C • 830 • 830C • 851E • 951 FutureJ151 • CR151 Depots Bishan • Changi • Gali Batu • Kim Chuan • Mandai • Sengkang • Ulu Pandan • Tuas FutureChangi East • East Coast • Tengah\n\nRailway Lines in Singapore [ V • T • ] Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) North–South Line • East–West Line • North East Line • Circle Line • Downtown Line • Thomson–East Coast Line FutureJurong Region Line • Cross Island Line Light Rail Transit (LRT) Bukit Panjang LRT • Sengkang LRT • Punggol LRT Cross-border KTM Intercity FutureJohor Bahru–Singapore Rapid Transit System Others Changi Airport Skytrain • Sentosa Express DefunctSentosa Monorail"
