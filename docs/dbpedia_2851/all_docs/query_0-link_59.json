        "text": "I've been doing a lot of research. Please check this, but from what I've read, there are a few ways to leave the cruise terminal area (Marina Bay) and go see some sights. Gardens by the Bay has plenty of walkways inside the area, but it's a large area and first you'll need to get to it. The brown \"Thompson East Coast\" MRT (subway line) goes closest (to the stop called Gardens by the Bay), which I believe might be an end stop. But there's also a stop called Bayfront that is served by 2 MRT lines (Downtown & Circle) on the other side of the Gardens. Gardens by the Bay are free unless you want to go into the Cloud Forest or another of the buildings there, which I think are around $20. The area of \"Marina Bay\" is a good place in which to just walk around, along the waterfront. You'll see things like the pretty impressive Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Merlion, Art/Science building (flower shaped), Singapore Flyer wheel, etc. And Chinatown and Little India are good places if you want to see lots of temples & atmosphere.\n\nSince you're there at night, you should try to see the light show at the Supertree Grove in Gardens of the Bay. There's also a Spectra Light show too, on the water.\n\nThe cruise port is located near the Marina South Pier station, which is on the red North South line. Here's some draft information about the situation at the port about getting from the city to the port:\n\nPort (directions from city if walking\n\nOption 1: Board train along the East-West Line towards Pasir Ris or towards Downtown Station if coming from Downtown Line. Alight at Tanjong Pagar exit C or Downtown exit C. Board bus 402 at bus stop, near International Plaza (03223) or near Marina Bay Financial Centre (03391). Alight Marina Bay Cruise Centre. Option 2: Board train along NS line towards Marina Bay. Alight Marina S Pier Station, walk 600m 0.37 mi. along sheltered way to Cruise Centre.\n\nAddress 61 Marina Coastal Drive, info mbccs.com.sg. Recommend taxi to port to embark as MRT a little walk away, rain happens, hot, walking with bags rough. But going back out is public bus 400 to CBD starts 6, runs until 11:45p daily. Bus stop at coach bay at Level 1, single fare S$1.40 to S$2. Have exact fare; no change. In city, catch 400 at Tanjong Pagar Station (exit C) or Downtown Station (stop DT 17 “opposite DT station”, then exit C).\n\nYou could also check a fairly new website called \"Docked Discoveries\" for info on various ports (Asia, City/States section).\n\nHope this isn't too confusing. But at least it might give you some ideas. Best subway map I've found is here: https://mrtmapsingapore.com/\n\nTaxis are plentiful, I hear. The heat/humidity is crushing. The city is quite colorful. Enjoy!\n\nLooking at the Metro map (MRT), on a day in Singapore, I'd probably walk to the Marina South Pier MRT station (red North South line). I'd take it one stop and get off at the Marina Bay stop of the brown Thompson East Coast line. Then I'd take that line one stop to the Gardens by the Bay station, get off, and head toward the Supertree Grove in the middle of the Gardens. (I'm not sure if there are multiple exits, and if so, which one is closest to the Gardens. But I know you'll want to go west.)\n\nFrom the cruise port & Marina South Pier station, it looks like it would be relatively easy to just take the red North South line a couple stops up to Raffles Place or go one stop to Marina Bay stop and connect to Circle line in the direction of Harbour Front (west a ways), go 2 stops and get off at Promenade stop.\n\nI'm not big on taxis (not sure why, just that I'm not). However, part of the reason tends to be price. But from what I've read, it seems like it's not too expensive to take a taxi around the general area of what might be considered center city. Can anyone offer me a guess as to how much it would cost to go from, for example, to the Gardens or the Cruise Port from a hotel located in Chinatown (1900 Hotel, located on Mosque Street, near an MRT station, though I forget which one!) And will most taxis take credit card payments, even if it's a fairly short trip? And what about a taxi from say, the Gardens to the Rain Vortex at Jewel? About how much might that cost?"
