About

Marina Bay is a MRT Station located in Marina Bay. It has five exits.

The North South Line platforms are arranged in a conventional island platform layout. Prior to regular southbound trains being scheduled to turnaround at Marina South Pier, platforms at Marina Bay were used both for train turnarounds and trains heading to/from Marina South Pier. Using a set of points north of the station, terminating trains arriving from Raffles Place arrive at either Platform A or B to before heading back towards Raffles Place and Jurong East. At the same time, passing-through-trains call at Platform B towards Marina South Pier, and at Platform A towards Jurong East.

The Circle Line platform uses a conventional island platform layout. CCL platforms were renumbered from A & B to C & D respectively upon the opening of the TEL on 13 Nov 2022. As part of the Circle Line Extension, train services on the Circle Line will operate as a shuttle between Marina Bay and Stadium stations throughout most of the day. However, during the weekday peak hours, train services from Marina Bay will serve the full line, operating between Marina Bay and HarbourFront stations via Bishan. Both platforms are utilized alternately by terminating trains. With the platforms at Basement 1 accessible only via the Ticket Concourse / Transfer Hall at Basement 2, Marina Bay CCL station is the first underground MRT station to have its platform level above the concourse level.

The TEL platforms are arranged in a stacked side configuration. Heading south from Marina Bay station, trains pass through the unopened Marina South station.

Art In Transit

North-South Line

National Day Babies in 2015 by Tay Kay Chin: These 50 photographed images featured 53 Singaporeans born from year 1965 to 2014 as a birthday gift to Singapore in celebrating SG50. The 53 Singaporeans chosen reflects Singapore's demography in terms of gender, ethnic, and occupation. Sharing these photographs of people born on August 9, our National Day, who take different routes to success, the artist hopes to inspire all who passes by the artwork to strive and believe in one self and succeed in doing something extraordinary for the benefit of our nation.

Circle Line

Train Rides on Rainy Days by Nah Yong En: “Train Rides on Rainy Days” comprises of two sets of photographs, ‘greenery’ and ‘blue evening’ taken from the inside of MRT trains on the East-West and North-South Lines during rainy days. The photographic works are of places that we might probably have become so familiar with that we no longer consciously notice.

Flowers In Blossom II by Tay Chee Toh: The mobile of delicate sculptures resembling flowers was originally hung in Orchard station. It was re-commissioned as homage to the legacy of art in Singapore’s MRT train stations, from before the Art in Transit programme was launched in 1997 for the North East Line.

Thomson-East Coast Line

Walking into the Interstitial by Tang Ling Nah: Taking the form of trompe l’œil murals, the artwork draws attention to everyday spaces easily missed by commuters on the go. It also bridges the old Central Business District (CBD) and the new financial centre in Marina Bay, where this station is located.

The artist created original charcoal drawings which were then scanned and printed onto vitreous enamel panels. The artwork takes reference from the stairways, doors, windows and interstitial spaces, such as alleys and corridors, found in areas like Cecil Street, Raffles Place and Shenton Way in the old CBD. The old CBD is transposed into the new financial centre, creating uncanny moments of ‘unfamiliar’ familiarity and invoking memories of an ever-changing city.
