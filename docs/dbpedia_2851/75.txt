The North South Line was the first MRT line in Singapore. The line is currently 44 km long with 25 stations, and is operated by SMRT Corporation. This line is coloured red on the rail map.

As the name implies, the line connects central Singapore to both northern and southern parts of the island. Cross-platform transfer to the East West Line is provided at Jurong East, City Hall and Raffles Place stations, and North East Line at Dhoby Ghaut station.

Further Information

Three batches of rolling stock are in service, manufactured by Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI), Siemens AG and another manufactured jointly by Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) & Nippon Sharyo.

There is one depot at Bishan on the North-South line, which has maintenance and train overhaul facilities.

In early weekday mornings, there are direct cross-over trains to the East West Line.

In late afternoon/early evenings, two limited-services are operated :

Marina Bay - Yishun

Jurong East - Choa Chu Kang

Bishan is the only station on the entire MRT system to be at ground-level. Perhaps because of this, it is also the station with the highest number of accidents (most fatal) in recent history.
