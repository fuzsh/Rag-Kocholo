Marina Bay MRT station is an underground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) interchange station on the North-South Line (NSL) and Circle Line (CCL), operated by SMRT Trains. The station is located on the boundary of the Downtown Core and Straits View planning areas in Singapore and was built alongside Bayfront Avenue. As the name suggests, it is located near Marina Bay.

”Train Rides on Rainy Days” by Nah Yong En

“Train Rides on Rainy Days” comprises two sets of photographs, ‘greenery’ and ‘blue evening,’ taken from the inside of MRT trains on the East-West and North-South Lines during rainy days. The photographic works are of places we might probably have become so familiar with that we no longer consciously notice.

Just as rain brings cool relief and washes the city anew, this collection of images brings a refreshing element of nature into the underground station. The 14 raindrop photos depict scenes that commuters can see if they looked out of the window during a rainy train ride above ground.

TECO fabricated and supplied 30m² of vitreous enamel graphic panels to this project at the platform level. Vitreous enamel graphic panels combine aesthetically pleasing colors and glossy finishing with outstanding properties, such as anti-graffiti, fire-rated, corrosion protection, and impact resistance. Unaffected by the environment, the color of VE panels will not fade and remain as aesthetical as many decades to come.
