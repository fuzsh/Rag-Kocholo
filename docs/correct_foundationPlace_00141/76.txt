Modus Operandi are a marketing, sales and customer service development company with specialist experience in the hospitality, leisure and service industries.

I wanted a sensible website design and build that would give me maximum flexibility to strategically grow my businesses over time. I also wanted to incorporate SEO into the design and build without paying expensive SEO fees to a so called specialist. Epsilis provided the solution and have built sites for me that are performing well. Working with Michael has been a pleasure and behind his unassuming nature is a wealth of talent and experience that he is happy to share to improve your web presence and your business. Michael also provides an incredible ongoing support and advisory service and is always available to answer your questions and queries first hand. If you are considering creating a new website or revamping your old site then be sure to seek out the services of Michael Spencer and his company Epsilis”

I have created a selection of sites for Ursuline, originally using Drupal, and more recently WordPress based and most using the same overall brand look. The sites have a variety of advanced features like “Paid for Membership” and “Content Drip Feed”.
