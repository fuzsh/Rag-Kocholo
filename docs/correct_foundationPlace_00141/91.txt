OPERATIONAL POLICIES :

We work together to maintain the future of the human race. In the year 2961 M.O. Inc. was formed, banding together with other organizations lending that helping hand when needed. Some times we are hired to do whats not correct, Though still we get paid.

What we are looking for is men, women, and others that will apply to our cause and be wiling to help move the human race forward and help form alliances with other species. The Founders Modus Operandi were 4 men who today only one is left to take the name forward.
