About Modus Operandi:

Modus Operandi (MO) was founded in 2007 in the heart of Vancouver, and offers pivotal post-secondary contemporary dance training. The mission of MO is to nurture unique emergent voices in dance by continuously investigating and investing in a practice-based curriculum that welcomes all the possible ways to dance. MO seeks to remain nimble and responsive to the evolving dance ecology, to provide meaningful facilitation of dancers’ relationship to the form so it is empowered, long-lasting and uniquely theirs. Alumni are celebrated as some of Canada’s most radical and inspired new artists producing, creating and performing in an enormous range of formats, environments and organizations.
