It began a long, long, LONG time ago...

A wonderful MMORG (massive multiplayer online role-playing games) called Modus Operandi was born. It was founded by the Simutronics Corporation and joined other Simutronics largely successful MMORGs; DragonRealms, GemStone IV, and CyberStrike 2. When you logged in to Modus Operandi (MO), you were dropped at a visitor's center and given a flower. From there, the journey was up to you.

You could explore the island, solve mysteries, turn in wanted criminals (even other players!), scratch off lottery tickets, or just sit and chat with friends.

I had a character there - Angelica. Every time I logged on, I was greeted. It was friendly, fun, and a game that is, unfortunately, no longer around.

We NEED Modus Operandi. We need to let Simutronics and its partner company, Stillfront Group (who partnered with Simutronics in 2016), and CEO/Founder David Whatley, know that MO is a game WORTH bringing back.
