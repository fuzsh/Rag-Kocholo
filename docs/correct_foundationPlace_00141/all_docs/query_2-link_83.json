We nurture our employees by providing them with an inspiring and engaging work environment.\n\nThe privately held PrimeSoft Group consists of PrimeSoft Solutions, Inc., an Illinois C Corporation, Software Consortium, LLC, a Maryland S Corporation, and PrimeSoft IP Solutions Pvt. Ltd., a corporation registered under the laws of India.\n\nWe have experience building large-scale and secure enterprise applications that are scalable, reliable, and highly available. Our expertise not only includes building monolithic applications but also enabling digital transformation by developing applications based on microservices architecture.\n\nOur Agile teams with certified scrum masters, development and QA engineers are experienced in working with distributed teams across multiple time-zones to build, deploy, orchestrate, monitor, and support various applications. Today, our applications engineering group comprises engineers with experience in multiple technologies, frameworks, and deployment tools. Their experience ranges from specialization in UI/UX (Angular, React, React Native, iOS, Android and Responsive web design using Bootstrap, Material UI), frameworks (Ionic, Spring, Spring Boot, Hibernate, Spring WebFlux, Vert.x) to microservices development (Java, .Net, Python, Node.js, PHP).\n\nOur DevOps and infrastructure teams have set up and managed automation pipelines and scalable infrastructure on AWS and Azure cloud platforms for our clients. Our teams are sensitive to FinOps and SecOps, which are integral in infrastructure management. Jenkins, Shell Scripting, Power Shell, Linux, Kubernetes, OpenShift, Ansible, Terraform are some of the tools that we frequently use as part of our cloud service activities.\n\nWe have extensive experience in testing. Our test engineers are familiar with all major Test Management, Test Automation, and Test Framework tools such as Appium, TestComplete, etc. We have made a significant investment in developing a home-grown automation framework. This framework has a number of unique features; it can work in a Test-driven development (TDD) or Behavior-driven development (BDD) environment, is evidence-based, incorporates reusable libraries, works across multiple browsers, and works with multiple automation tools (Selenium, Appium, Protractor, WebDriverIO, Cucumber, SpecFlow, JMeter), as well as automation frameworks (TestNG, JUnit, Jasmine, Mocha, Karma, pytest).\n\nOur modus operandi\n\nWe develop a close partnership with the client’s marketing, product management, and R&D teams. The foundation for our client partnerships is based on our comprehensive understanding of their business, including markets, customers, and technology. We closely align our operations (processes, people, and systems) to the client’s business environment enabling seamless execution. Our service delivery model ensures that the client has a strategic cost and differentiated product advantage."
