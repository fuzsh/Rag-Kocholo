        "text": "Blog FinServ\n\nOperational Excellence at the New York Stock Exchange: Our Q&A with NYSE’s President\n\nMitigating the risk of operational failure is top of mind—and a top budget priority—for executives. A single unplanned event can have a disruptive effect across the organization, an outcome management teams work hard to avoid. For the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), operational resilience is critical given the role it plays in the global economy and capital flows. The NYSE, part of ICE, is the world’s largest equities exchange, running on an advanced deterministic trading technology platform. Its data, technology, and expertise have helped the NYSE stay resilient and outperform during periods of market volatility, global unrest, and record-shattering trading days. I recently got to sit down with Lynn Martin, President of NYSE, to discuss her experience leading the largest global exchange group and her approach to achieving operational excellence. How do you think about the business model of the New York Stock Exchange? We pride ourselves on being the stewards of the US capital market. We’re the leading platform for entrepreneurs and innovators to raise the capital they need to change the world. And, as the largest global exchange group, our role is to ensure that our markets remain open, efficient, and transparent—especially during volatile times—so that people can manage risk. How do you safeguard the environment that companies are listing on, and make it a place people trust when they’re looking to do business with you? You have to be rock solid operationally. You have to be state-of-the-art. You have to drive your platform forward and operate at the highest level—day in and day out—with operational excellence. Without operational excellence, you don't build trust and you’re never going to be able to scale your platform or create the next great innovation to drive your business forward. The resiliency of our infrastructure from the time a person even thinks about connecting to us to when that order is matched is something we pride ourselves on. We ensure that our systems are hardened with tremendous amounts of backup and resiliency built into each part of the path an order takes once it gets into our system. I imagine a high-profile system failure is completely intolerable to your business. What steps do you take to build up the operational resilience to withstand and deflect material business risk? A key component of building resiliency is ensuring that the next-gen technologies and tools are at the fingertips of the people monitoring the markets. We process almost three-quarters of a trillion incoming order messages daily through our pipes. When I started in my position two years ago, that was below half a trillion. Despite a 30-40% increase in message traffic, we've reduced response times because of the technologies we've invested in—including the PagerDuty Operations Cloud. We’ve integrated PagerDuty into our operational perimeter to ensure that, whenever we have a potential issue on any component of our system, we can respond efficiently. I've heard you talk about the importance of bringing human ingenuity together with the power of technology. In the current era of AI and automation, how are you looking at that balance to protect the interest of your business and your clients’ businesses? Automation has the power to transform the way businesses run. It's going to enable us to do a lot more with the information we have and be much more efficient. If you've got good data—and AI on top of good data—you're going to enable the human being to do higher value-add types of activities in a much more efficient fashion. Humans are going to need that level of automation because of the sheer growth in the magnitude of data. Importantly, though, if you don't have that person sitting on top to make sure the output of the algorithm makes sense, you're going to have a variety of unfortunate outcomes. Because of the sheer volume of messages that has increased on our system, our operations team would not be able to do their jobs as efficiently if they didn’t have PagerDuty. They take great pride in the fact that our response times for an average trade have been cut in half since the rollout of our new technology. How would you reflect on the business relationship between New York Stock Exchange and PagerDuty? What have you been able to accomplish through our journey together? One of my key focuses is to be the platform for our issuers to tell their stories. If you become an NYSE-listed company, you really are raising capital that you need to change the world. And we're just so proud to be the platform to allow you all to tell your stories. Since becoming a customer, I've had my head of operations personally come into my office and say, “I don't know who selected PagerDuty, but thank you from our entire operations team because you have made our lives so much better and so much more efficient”. Can you share an example of an innovation you've unlocked by virtue of having such outstanding stability in the core operation? Because of the stability of our platforms across our parent company, ICE, we’ve created many different data and analytics solutions that add transparency to the marketplace and give transparency to the risk that people manage every day. It has enabled us to be thought leaders on artificial intelligence (AI), specifically large language models (LLMs)—which we've had in production for over a decade—that are driving transparency in the opaque portions of our energy markets. Talk to me about the role technology integration plays in an M&A context. How do you bring platforms and technology together in service of an outstanding client experience? We have a very deliberate playbook at ICE. We always prefer to build, but if there’s something in the market that addresses a gap and gets us to market quicker, we’ll buy. Since I've been at ICE, I’ve done more than 50 acquisitions. These fall directly in our repeatable strategy of turning analog, paper-based processes into digital processes. As a result, we're able to efficiently integrate these technologies and identify synergies either on the cost or the revenue side. You've been leading an outstanding operational technology business transformation here at the New York Stock Exchange. What advice do you have to share with leaders who have to drive transformation over the next couple of quarters and years? Don't be afraid to make investments in your technology and people that will pay dividends in the medium to long term. Short-term, there may be operational issues you need to address. But always plan for the medium to long term. It's going to continue to be a data-driven world, and we have to harness the power that data gives us. At the New York Stock Exchange, data is necessary to ensure that the markets continue to move forward as transparently and securely as possible, and we don't lose sight of the fact that the US capital markets are the envy of the world.

Further, the medical devices and machines found in the niche space of optometry presents challenges. The equipment is built to last. And while entirely functional for its intended purpose, older machines are often unable to connect through API services or efficiently transfer data between systems. Over the years, the company developed its own business processes and in-house technologies to address these complexities. Specsavers embarked on a digital transformation to support its expansion into new markets. However, legacy and disparate systems hampered its ability to grow efficiently and be agile. To solve the challenges of legacy architecture and applications, Specsavers engineers turned to automation through orchestration. “Automation helps us deal with our technical debt,” says Simon Hamilton-Peach, Platform Engineer, Observability. “It bridges between legacy systems and helps integrate new systems with old systems.” A Framework for Standardization Over the span of a decade, point use cases for automation popped up throughout Specsavers. However, only a handful of subject matter experts knew how to use tools such as the OSS platform, Rundeck, and there was no agreed-to standard. As the importance of using automation to achieve business goals increased, it became necessary to approach it from an enterprise perspective. Specsavers’ Platform team selected PagerDuty Runbook Automation Self-Hosted as the platform to orchestrate their automation processes. This solution provided the granular levels of control the business required. “We needed to apply a level of governance to the way automation was being used across the estate,” says Andy Slater. “The approach wasn’t to seize control. We created a lightweight framework, including standards and best practices that closed the automation gap without stifling development.” PagerDuty Runbook Automation Self-Hosted has been successfully rolled out across the organization. Today, Specsavers executes over 120,000 jobs each month—equivalent to 225 days of effort or the work of 30 employees. “The system we designed with Runbook Automation Self-Hosted gives the ability for our users to be able to conveniently and easily use, create and perform automations and solutions,\" says Simon Hamilton-Peach. “The complexity typically experienced when using automation is completely removed.” A Spec-tacular Success: Automating the IT Service Desk Previously, addressing IT service desk inquiries was a manual process. Service Analysts handled incoming calls, troubleshooting issues using knowledge-based articles (KBs). This required a high level of technical expertise as they guided in-store partners through step-by-step instructions. Complex issues were often escalated to the Level 3 support team. With Runbook Automation Self-Hosted, the IT service desk has automated the steps within the KBs. With the click of a button, service analysts can execute a runbook or series of runbooks to fix the majority of problems. The team saves a huge amount of time by eliminating manual work, and the number of escalations to the Level 3 support team has been reduced by automating repeat issues. Further, we can now bring in personnel to the service desk more skilled in customer service since less technical expertise is required. Today, a junior employee can achieve effectiveness within one month, a 75% reduction in time from the previously required technical training. “Our service desk fundamentally relies on Runbook Automation Self-Hosted,” says Andy Slater. “It’s changed the way our metric of success is defined—it’s driving the right behaviors. It’s less about technical fixes, because that will take care of itself. Now, it’s all about customer satisfaction.” Visionary Efficiency: Edge Automation & Retail Store Operations Runbook Automation Self-Hosted has helped manage remote edge systems within its 2,000+ stores. “The technical debt isn’t consistent—we have different generations of technology within almost every store.” Andy Slater says. “Our software deployment teams rely heavily on Runbook Automation Self-Hosted to manage this complexity and improve efficiencies.” The deployment team has a standard build, and then a number of different deviations dependent on the specific store configuration. When teams need to upgrade something or do some remediation work, Runbook Automation Self-Hosted helps simplify those divergent paths on how to approach each store, and helps with push-button remedial fixes in the case that something else breaks. An Eye-Opening Improvement: More Appointments, More Revenue Specsavers addressed the challenge of missed or canceled appointments using Runbook Automation Self-Hosted. Text reminders were automated, giving customers the opportunity to cancel appointments. Every four hours, PagerDuty Runbook Automation Self-Hosted gets a list of around 500 customers requesting cancellations. Using Runbook Automation Self-Hosted, individual stores appointments are then canceled, freeing up availability for others, maximizing completed appointments, and increasing revenue. “This is just one example of how we’re driving real business value with Process Automation—we’re increasing store availability, which means more revenue for our stores,” says Simon Hamilton-Peach. Seeing Clear Results In less than one year, Specsavers has implemented and realized major benefits using PagerDuty Runbook Automation Self-Hosted, including: Operational efficiency at scale: Widespread adoption has expanded the benefits of previous siloed automations and complex, manual workflows throughout the company by centralizing IT support across 2000+ stores. Tasks resolved faster: 120,000 executions saves 225 days of manual effort per month, or the work of 30 employees. Faster onboarding: 75% reduction in the amount of time it takes to train a Service Analyst. Improved customer experience: One-click, first-time fixes allow Service Analysts to focus their work on improving customer satisfaction. Increased revenue: Real-time appointment availability maximizes the number of customer visits in stores and potential revenue. “The return we’ve gotten using PagerDuty Automation is phenomenal,” says Andy Slater. “We can track ROI on the effort that we put in as a team, and use the data to make business decisions about resource-sharing across departments. It’s a really powerful business case that we’re excited to continue building on into the future.” Focusing on the Future Specsavers is continuously improving its automation practice, and plans to use third party plugins like ServiceNow, Jira, and Cyberark in the future. The team is also working with partner Accenture to scale the use of automation to manage the extensive technology and supply chain complexities. Accenture will develop processes and scripts that teams can then integrate and deploy in Runbook Automation Self-Hosted. This will free up time to tackle bigger problems where there might currently be temporary fixes in place.

To scale, the need for an automation platform became imperative to preempt potential disruptions, particularly to avoid flight delays. Recognizing the magnitude of this endeavor, the airline needed an automation solution that works across infrastructure, data, and incidents—providing a unified orchestration layer to streamline operations at scale. Inefficiency and Toil Create Turbulence Engineers at Ryanair were managing tedious, manual tasks. For example, checking if a batch job ended required logging in and checking the logs—every time. It was slow and inefficient. And often, they were interrupted in the middle of a project. “Context switching burns people out,” says Diego Infiesta, Infrastructure Manager at Ryanair. “It’s stressful to leave what you’re working on to address something more urgent.” The team started automating certain recurring processes to improve operational agility and morale. Assessing if tasks were worthy of automating became a fundamental strategy. For example, how often does the team do this daily? Can we build self-service automation? Can these tasks be delegated safely? These were important questions the team needed to answer to understand the impact automation could have on their greater team. Over time, the team found success using automation. However, the growing number of automation use cases created its own layer of complexities. The absence of an overarching orchestration framework made it difficult to streamline and scale their automation efforts. “Our main challenge was that we had a lot of small-scale automations running everywhere, but we didn’t have anything wrapping it all together,” says Diego Infiesta, Infrastructure Manager at Ryanair. Soaring High with PagerDuty Runbook Automation Self-Hosted PagerDuty Runbook Automation Self-Hosted proved to be a game-changer for authoring, managing, and executing automated workflows that span across teams, technologies, and networks. It seamlessly integrates into Ryanair’s operations and works across its hybrid environment, seamlessly moving data between cloud and on-prem infrastructure. Infiesta says, “Runbook Automation Self-Hosted was so easy to deploy, and we saw the benefits right away.” Today, PagerDuty facilitates the execution of over 25,000 jobs daily, significantly enhancing operational efficiency. Some notable examples include: Disaster Recovery (DR): Ryanair’s DR process is standardized using Runbook Automation Self-Hosted, making it simple to execute the steps without human error. Auto-remediation: Self-healing is an important part of Ryanair’s incident response strategy. For example, if a web server stops responding at 3 A.M., an alert trigger goes to Runbook Automation Self-Hosted which will try to restart and fix it. If this doesn’t work, a human will be looped in. Security and Compliance: In the past, it took an engineer two weeks to provide all the evidence required for a Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) compliance auditor. Now with Runbook Automation Self-Hosted, Ryanair offers auditors a self-service portal to collect the information they need. This has reduced the amount of time spent on SOX audits by 90%. The list goes on, automating everything from data downloads to building reports. \"Just invest a small amount of time in doing a process that will save you a lot of time down the road,\" says Infiesta. Clear Skies Ahead With Runbook Automation Self-Hosted, engineers no longer need to manage mundane, time-consuming tasks. The team's newfound efficiency not only propelled current operations, but also positioned them nicely for future scalability and additional embedding of new automation. “The benefit of PagerDuty Runbook Automation Self-Hosted for us is that engineers can focus on improvement, training, cloud adoption, and cost optimization,” says Infiesta. “We’re more efficient and more resilient.” Hear more from Diego in his PagerDuty Connect London presentation including details about why they moved from Rundeck open source to PagerDuty Runbook Automation Self-Hosted, and how they address cultural challenges related to using automation.

To create stickier relationships with customers, more businesses are turning to programs like IAG Loyalty. Part of the International Airlines Group (IAG), the company operates the loyalty programs for IAG’s airlines—British Airways, Iberia, and Aer Lingus—and 125+ global brand partners in travel, retail, and financial services. As IAG Loyalty adds to its family of brand partners and brings new products to market, sustainable growth remains a top priority. “Our business has an ever-growing need to deliver new products and features more quickly,” says Colin Lewis, Head of Core Engineering at IAG Loyalty. “We don't want the growth of our team and complexity of our operations to grow linearly with the growth of our business. We need to do more without scaling our operating costs.” To deliver on those goals, IAG Loyalty underwent a major digital transformation—including migrating to the public cloud and adopting a DevSecOps approach to operations. Inefficient Workflows Slowed Resolution and Innovation Prior to IAG Loyalty’s efforts to modernize their operations, the company was challenged with long detection and resolution times for customer-impacting incidents. The existing triage and communication process was inefficient and ineffective. “People worked in silos, making it difficult to get teams together when there was a problem,” says James Headon, Cloud Operations Manager. “And when they came together, a lot of time was wasted. This slowed down the ability to resolve issues and get back to what they should actually be doing.” The team wanted a solution that was flexible and scalable. “In the DevSecOps space, technology moves very fast,” Colin Lewis says. “We need solutions that can be easily integrated into our environment—and for that integration to be simple, so we can flex and adapt as needed.” Fast Time to Value With PagerDuty IAG Loyalty determined that they needed one platform to manage their digital operations. The team piloted PagerDuty with their identity management service—integrating monitoring data into the platform, setting up on-call schedules, and defining escalation policies. After initial success, best practices were documented and PagerDuty was rolled out across all products. A consistent solution for incident management gave the platform team visibility across engineering, while allowing product teams to manage the technology locally without interference. Broad adoption also helped with collaboration and sped up incident response. With all of the data in one place, the right responders were mobilized immediately to focus on resolving the highest-urgency issues. A More Automated Way of Working To drive even faster resolution and lower operating costs, the team turned to PagerDuty AIOps and its machine learning capabilities. Using AIOps, they reduced noise on certain services by 70%. PagerDuty also surfaces actionable insights and provides required context from past incidents to determine probable root cause and drive to resolution faster. “There's no shortage of data these days,” Colin Lewis says. “But gathering insights across the top of that data is very hard. AI helps with that.\" With scale in mind, automation is a top priority for the team. PagerDuty was configured with code using Terraform to speed up onboarding of new teams. This ensures quality best practices and codifies service ownership at scale. “Where we are today with PagerDuty is a noticeably more automated way of working,” says James Headon. “We’ve reduced the amount of time to get people up and running, and the amount of time to resolve mission-critical issues. Now, we’re able to deliver value faster.” “Now, we’re able to deliver value faster.” - James Headon, Cloud Operations Manager at IAG Loyalty Real-Time Operational Updates for Leadership At IAG Loyalty, PagerDuty isn’t just for engineers. When there’s an issue putting the business at risk, the leadership team must immediately understand what’s happening and what’s being done to resolve the problem. “We operate a decentralized model, where visibility is absolutely paramount,” says Colin Lewis. Private Status Pages provides key stakeholders a customized view and proactively communicates the status of key services. During customer-impacting issues, it keeps teams aligned on a single source of truth and protects product teams from distractions. “The PagerDuty Operations Cloud gives us visibility of what’s happening across the estate—it shows us how we’re operating as a platform,” Colin Lewis says. Benefits with the PagerDuty Operations Cloud IAG Loyalty has built an automation framework that allows engineers to build products and services in a fast and safe way. This has laid the foundation for sustainable growth as a company. An essential part of the framework is the PagerDuty Operations Cloud, which has helped: Drive autonomy and accountability: PagerDuty enables a DevSecOps approach, empowering teams to be accountable for achieving business results while providing visibility across products. Accelerate innovation: Reducing alert noise by up to 70% gives teams time back for revenue-generating work. Provide leadership visibility: PagerDuty provides clear insights into mission-critical operations so the business can make quick decisions to minimize brand and revenue impact of incidents. “The services we provide are absolutely critical to IAG and the airlines. PagerDuty Operations Cloud helps us operate in a way that is reliable and can be trusted,” says Colin Lewis. “The PagerDuty Operations Cloud shows us how we’re operating as a platform.” - Colin Lewis, Head of Core Engineering at IAG Loyalty Focused on Continuous Improvement The team is focused on continuous improvement to move the business forward faster. One priority is using PagerDuty Status Pages externally to field feature requests and proactively communicate with IAG Loyalty’s airline and brand partners. “Part of my team manages communications to partners,” Colin Lewis says. “To be able to write that update once and broadcast it, or get partners to come and collect it from the status page will take a lot of legwork out of that.” Watch Colin & James’ 2-minute testimonial, learn more about how PagerDuty can help you grow as a business, or sign up for a free trial.\n\nBlog Media-Entertainment\n\nOperational Integrity at FOX: Our Q&A with Tubi Media Group’s CEO\n\nDigital transformation is (still) at the top of the executive agenda, particularly for companies in categories where business model disruption is afoot. Sustaining growth and relevance demands finding new sources of revenue, new ways of working, and new operational models. Fox Corporation is one of the world's leading producers and distributors of original entertainment, sports, and news content. In 2019, the company broke ground on a state-of-the-art technology and operations center in Tempe, Arizona. The new FOX Media Center signaled a strategic investment in the company’s digital, broadcast, streaming, and distribution capabilities, setting a new bar for operational excellence in the industry and turning the network model on its head. We sat down with Paul Cheesbrough, Chief Executive Officer of Tubi Media Group, part of the Fox Corporation, to discuss his experience leading this large-scale operational transformation and his modern approach to managing digital operations. How have the category and your business changed in the last few years? Creativity, storytelling, and journalism have always been core to our business, and over time, software engineering has become an increasingly important enabler in bringing our products to life for consumers. No matter what part of the company I’ve been in at FOX, I’ve always found the culture of the business to be innovative and disruptive. We’re often the underdog entering a space, pushing boundaries to better serve the consumer. What are the tenets of the experience you’re trying to build for your audience? How do you keep viewers coming back? The consumer is at the center of everything we do. And the consumer, from a media perspective, has never had more choice. If our load time is slow, or if the content isn’t as good compared to a competitor, they’ll quickly move elsewhere. Like all of our industry, we used to be a company that blasted content out and then looked at the ratings the day after. Now, it's completely real time. Everything is data-driven and coming back through a live feedback channel. This requires attention to detail. We have to make decisions on the fly depending on consumption spikes, customer feedback, things that are working, and things that aren’t. This all starts with operational integrity. We’ve put significant energy and effort into building a strong operation as the core of what we deliver to the consumer. Can you unpack the idea of operational integrity, and talk about the investments you’ve made to deliver a great consumer experience? In 2019, we were able to ask ourselves, if we were to build this today from scratch, how would an integrated broadcast-cable-digital-consumer operation look? And we did just that with our operational center in Tempe. We invested in facilities, in platforms, and in the displacement of technology debt to make sure we are building on a strong foundation. Our operational center has become integral to our business—a strategic capability. If you go to most media operations centers you get racks and racks of hardware. Ours is predominantly software-based, built around a very open, flexible data architecture running on the Amazon Web Services network backbone. We’re connected directly into their infrastructure, which reduces the latency for moving video around. We architected data into the heart of this operation from the beginning, which allows us to be predictive about, and avoid, on-air or streaming issues. We can make decisions on the fly depending on consumption spikes, customer feedback, things that are working, things that aren't. What role has PagerDuty played in the business transformation at FOX? PagerDuty has been essential infrastructure to us. It's the platform that brings together and instruments very important data. We've driven a lot of cost out of the operation through the introduction of automation—and PagerDuty has been a big part of that. It’s the thread that's common throughout our operation, orchestrating collaboration and integration across teams. It'd be hard for me to say that we have partnerships that are better than the one with PagerDuty. They’re a curious company—it's a wonderful attribute to have. The most senior members of your company want to spend time with us to observe and learn, and to see what the product can and can't do in the wild. And if it can't do something, then pretty soon down the line it can because of the feedback you've taken away. In 2023 you became the CEO of Tubi Media Group, which inherited its name from the Tubi acquisition. What was the strategic vision behind Tubi and its integration within FOX? FOX acquired the streaming service Tubi in 2020. Tubi was truly the underdog within the streaming market—scrappy, really trying to challenge the bigger streaming services while trying to establish the advertising video on demand (AVOD) category. The culture and DNA of the business is very engineering-oriented, and we’ve really tried to support, empower, and embrace that culture. So we built Tubi Media Group as the business unit inside FOX where our digital expertise, our platforms, and our product talent for all of the company reside. It still has its entrepreneurial roots, but it’s become a significant growth engine for the business as a whole. You mentioned culture—can you talk more about the kinds of talent, skills, and capabilities that are driving the company where it needs to go? The thing that keeps me awake at night—it feels like we're close to “zero legacy” now. But if we stand still for two or three years, legacy will creep back in. So how do we always keep one eye looking around the corner? How can we do things more effectively, faster? To do all of this, you have to have strong talent on the ground. So we spend a lot of time thinking about the work environment, how teams operate, and how we support interaction across teams—and really making sure that the work that our engineers are doing is cutting edge and interesting. One story was the 2023 Super Bowl, which we streamed out of the Tempe facility. We broke records in the U.S. We’re still the only broadcaster to have streamed the Super Bowl in 4K at that scale and volume. We broke latency records. And those are really tough engineering challenges—great, complex problems that attract the best engineers to work on them. You’ve invested in facilities, in technology, in partners, and in people. How do you balance driving efficiency at scale with innovation and growth? We're a technology and digital business within FOX now that's entirely focused on growth. We're able to scale the business faster and further because our cost structure on the core operation is in a really fit and healthy place, and it's in a fit and healthy place because of those investments we've made over the years. Central to our strategy, we’ve put our team’s capabilities, facilities, and platforms in place to power and support this level of operational integrity. You’d be surprised how many of the issues go away once you put that foundation in place. Building on this position of operational integrity has allowed us to really focus on the needle movers on revenue. It’s given us the time and air space to do the more glossy shiny stuff. Our velocity has improved; our creativity has improved. The team thinks about improvements to existing products and new products to launch. We’re continuing to raise the bar on world-class services we deliver to our customers.

For many people, this time of year conjures up associations with family, celebration, and renewal—but also snowstorms, crowded airports, and curveballs in travel plans. You may recall what happened last December, as unprecedented delays and cancellations created logistical nightmares for many families across the U.S. Travel companies can’t control the weather, but they can prepare for heavy demand amidst uncertainty. In these critical moments, an organization’s operational resilience is tested. No less than the preservation of revenue and reputation is at stake. For these brands, investing in their operational infrastructure isn’t optional. With the PagerDuty Operations Cloud, some of the world’s leading travel companies not only prevent travel disruptions, but also orchestrate and accelerate responses if issues do arise. They’re leveraging the power of automation and AI within PagerDuty to detect and diagnose disruptive events, mobilize responders, and streamline workflows at machine speed. Let’s hear from three travel leaders investing in their operational infrastructure to mitigate risk, provide reliable customer experiences, and ultimately win and protect revenue. A Surge in Bookings for TUI As the world’s largest integrated tourism organization, TUI provides end-to-end travel experiences with a network of 400 hotels, 130 aircraft, and 16 cruise ships across the globe. Customers turn to TUI so they can focus on their holiday, instead of the process of planning it. With PagerDuty, TUI was able to consolidate its tools for end-to-end, event-driven incident management. By streamlining its existing stack, the TUI team now has all the right information in one place. And PagerDuty AIOps and Event Orchestration have enabled TUI to automate scripts to recover from a service disruption. If there is a service disruption, TUI knows how to respond, with the help of PagerDuty. “The organization has become very agile and cost-effective,” says Yasin Quareshy, Head of Technology at TUI. “Not only is the service downtime reduced, we do see a higher booking rate from our customers.” For TUI, the business impact is in the millions of dollars saved. “The PagerDuty Operations Cloud is critical for TUI,” says Quareshy. “This is what is actually going to help us grow as a business when it comes to making sure that we provide quality services for our customers. We want to create trust with our customers and PagerDuty allows us to build that trust.” Hear more from Yasin Quareshy at TUI Carnival’s Reduction in Operating Costs As the world's largest experience enterprise, Carnival Corporation has become synonymous with the cruise line business. The brand takes pride in democratizing a premium vacation experience to all, with the guest experience as core to everything they do. With PagerDuty, Carnival replaced its traditional ticketing system for managing incidents with real-time operations. So instead of a long queue of tickets to react to, Carnival is able to proactively respond to issues before the guest is impacted. “We look to PagerDuty to integrate with the old world while moving us to a new world,” says John Padgett, Chief Experience and Innovation Officer at Carnival Corporation. In this new world, Carnival can prioritize the guest experience to ensure customer satisfaction remains as high as possible. “PagerDuty is very critical because we have to have that 24x7x365 complete reliability—the technology has to work all the time,” Padgett says. “It allows us to reduce costs while improving guest service.” Hear more from John Padgett at Carnival How Priceline Protects Revenue If you’ve ever been on the prowl for the best travel deal online, you know that things can change on a dime. And so when the moment is right, it’s incredibly important for a platform like Priceline to meet and exceed your expectations. “Our job is to make sure that the site is functioning quickly, accurately, and intuitively so that customers can find the deals they're looking for,” says Will Holmes, Senior Director for Site Operations at Priceline. “The customer experience is incredibly important.” The Priceline team is able to effectively monitor their digital operations in real time. “The operations center’s use of the PagerDuty Visibility Console has reduced our visual clutter and noise, and provided clarity,” says Eric Foxhall, Director of Site Reliability Operations. Holmes says that issues with Priceline’s site—even for short periods of time—could cost the company hundreds of offers. “Reducing the time of those incidents is the biggest business value we can ask for,” he says. “PagerDuty has given us the ability to save money.” Priceline’s partnership with PagerDuty has led to more than just tactical benefits for the team. “It's created a lot more visibility into what is happening—it's created a culture of support,” says Holmes. Hear more from Will Homes at Priceline Moving the Travel Industry Forward Customer expectations are continually on the rise, especially for digital excellence in service and experience. As these three leaders illustrate, travel remains an industry where the customer experience is the brand. Without it, everything else falls apart. It starts with the team itself: Empowering the organization to work better together—with the help of a platform powered by automation and AI—leads to more reliable and seamless experiences that keep customers coming back for more. Whether you’re addressing a single incident or the operational backbone of your enterprise, it’s imperative to be proactive and “audible-ready.” TUI, Carnival, and Priceline each identified operational excellence as a critical success factor to drive their business, and were proactive in their level of investment and innovation dedicated towards it—all in the name of securing trust, protecting their brand, and safeguarding revenue. The level of scrutiny may be heightened during the holiday season, but a reliable customer experience is paramount no matter the time of year. “With the PagerDuty Operations Cloud, the travel industry can provide exceptional experiences for travelers while maintaining the highest standards of service reliability,” says Tim Armandpour, Chief Technology Officer at PagerDuty. “In an industry where the customer experience is everything, we know that operational resilience and reliability are of utmost importance for our customers.” To continue your organization’s journey towards operational excellence, learn more about the PagerDuty Operations Cloud here or contact us to learn more.\n\nWritten Retail\n\nJohn Lewis & Partners Taps PagerDuty to Power Always-On Retail Experiences\n\nFounded in 1864, the John Lewis Partnership is the largest employee-owned business in the UK, with two main retail brands: John Lewis & Partners, a chain of high-end department stores, and Waitrose & Partners, a grocery retailer. For John Lewis & Partners, its online presence began in 2001 and has since grown considerably. The company moved from a monolithic ecommerce platform hosted in its data centers to a microservices-based platform on Google Cloud Platform. The move to the cloud made it easier to scale and deploy new services, helping accelerate digital innovation. As Rob Hornby, Lead Engineer and Product Owner for the John Lewis Digital Platform explained, “We now have 60 services running with more than 300 microservices on the platform and 5,000 deployments a year, a huge increase on the 10 a year we could previously deploy.” Simon Skelton, Platform & Operations Manager for johnlewis.com, has overall IT accountability for the smooth running of ecommerce operations. “We’ve done a lot over the years to tune the website to meet demand during key peaks, but our new digital platform has really helped us scale up and quickly meet the demands of customers,” he shared. Challenges of a Centralized Approach Having laid the foundations for digital innovation, John Lewis & Partners realized that its existing operations model wouldn’t scale to ensure a seamless, always-on experience for customers, which is paramount in an industry where just a few minutes of downtime can result in thousands of pounds in revenue loss. John Lewis & Partners followed a traditional operations model with a Network Operations Center (NOC) that had 24/7 eyes on glass for every alert. As its digital platform grew, so did its teams and the services they supported, to the point where it was extremely challenging for the NOC to efficiently route through the myriad of technical complexity. “Teams typically handed code over to Operations, but as we scaled the number of deployments and teams grew, and this became impractical,” explained Rob Hornby. Using PagerDuty for Faster Response Times and Delivery John Lewis & Partners turned to PagerDuty because the company needed a more effective incident response process that would enable the engineering teams to have full-service ownership and directly fix issues as they arose. “As we moved to the cloud and out of data centers towards a ‘build it, run it’ model, we needed to change our approach. We looked at a lot of different tools, but PagerDuty stood out and became our preferred option,” explained Skelton. PagerDuty helps John Lewis & Partners orchestrate the right response for every incident—ensuring the right people are brought together in the right place, at the right time. Moving from a centralized, resource-intensive approach to a full-service ownership model across all of the development teams has allowed John Lewis & Partners to identify and address issues more quickly. With PagerDuty, the company has managed to reduce time to acknowledge incidents from 10-15 minutes to 1-2 minutes. Delivering an Always-On Experience, Even During Peak Seasons Typically, John Lewis & Partners has three main peaks a year: Christmas, Summer Sale and Black Friday. These events require the retailer to scale swiftly while handling 10 times the usual traffic—at peak, that could be more than eight orders per second and tens of thousands of page views. With a full-service ownership model enabled by PagerDuty and a shift to the cloud, the staff and infrastructure were well prepared to deal with the increase in traffic during those peaks. So when people began shopping online in droves as a result of pandemic-related lockdowns in the UK, John Lewis & Partners was ready. “Like many retailers in the UK, we had to close all our shops at the end of March 2020, and the majority of our customer traffic immediately moved online. Our challenge was rapidly turning off all the website integrations with in-store services. We’ve never had to do this before, but it went remarkably well,” explained Simon Skelton. Scaling up and meeting the demands of customers whose only interface is digital, and mitigating any disruption quickly, have never been more important. “With stores closed, it is our only means of continuing as a business, so we’ve had to remain stable while also being able to iterate quickly and make sure the website is offering the same great level of service and information as our Partners do in stores,” shared Rob Hornby. “We’ve gone through our Summer Sale, which has broken all our records and we haven’t really broken a sweat Platform wise. We’ve been stable throughout.” “PagerDuty has been critical in ensuring we can rapidly respond to digital incidents so we don’t lose revenue to our competitors.” - Simon Skelton, Platform & Operations Manager, johnlewis.com Benefits of PagerDuty Since implementing PagerDuty, John Lewis & Partners has been able to respond quickly to continue meeting customers’ expectations, with benefits such as: Improving cross-team collaboration so they can focus more time on driving continued innovation in an ever-changing retail environment Significantly decrease the time to resolution when issues occur—teams are able to restore service three times faster than they could previously Greater visibility into the operational health of its systems and services “PagerDuty has been critical in ensuring we can rapidly respond to digital incidents so we don’t lose revenue to our competitors,” explained Simon Skelton. Additionally, even in light of the pandemic, Rob Hornby shared that the company’s platform and support model allowed the retailer to pretty seamlessly adapt, so PagerDuty was already BAU (business as usual) for many of its teams. “It fits really well with a remote working model,” he said. Future Looking In the future, John Lewis & Partners plans to use insights from PagerDuty to help support the postmortem process after incidents. Eager to improve how it manages incidents beyond the initial response, the team wants to better understand what went wrong in the first place, and what can be improved in the way people responded and the processes used. The retailer has also started mapping its technical services to business services to help improve cross-organizational communication during an incident, as it provides a clear view of the response to the business owners. “Over time, this may help replace our existing business email communications on incidents,” explained Rob Hornby. “In today’s climate, spikes in traffic could happen at any time, so we need to make sure we’re constantly ready to respond, which is where PagerDuty plays a key role. It has allowed us to automate our incident response processes so we can be more proactive, instead of leaving us reliant on manual and reactive processes,” concluded Simon Skelton.

In serving over 10% of the world’s Internet traffic, it’s imperative that Cloudflare’s services remain online for customers at scale, while guaranteeing SLA uptime by identifying and resolving incidents, long before operations are ever disrupted. Cloudflare’s Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team, lead by Michael Daly, sought an incident resolution solution which would help Cloudflare increase the stability of its operations, while delivering a flawless experience for every customer. Challenges: Visibility, Communication, and Escalation Cloudflare faced three challenges before adopting PagerDuty. The first was around optics. “We didn’t immediately know when something was broken because the engineering team did not receive automated alerts when an incident occurred,” Michael explained. The second challenge was in managing incidents. Once a problem was discovered, the engineering team relied on manual processes to address it. Engineers spent time diagnosing the cause of the problem, and if a solution required assistance from another department, SREs were required to contact that person over phone, text, or chat — a duty that became difficult if incidents occurred after working hours or on weekends. Given Cloudflare’s rapid growth, with less than 800,000 customers in 2013 to over 6 million in 2016, it was becoming difficult for Michael’s team to separate actionable, critical incidents from the growing volume of data generated by monitoring tools. While the team refused to dispose of potentially useful information, they needed to group related symptoms in order to gain actionable insight. Without the assistance of dynamic event management and triage, automation, and other capabilities available from PagerDuty, Michael and his staff had to evaluate the seriousness of each incident manually, a process that was becoming too slow to best serve the exponentially growing number of customers. “Mean-time-to-action has dropped from multiple minutes to seconds.” - Michael Daly, Engineering Manager, Cloudflare Increasing Stability and Response Time with PagerDuty By adopting PagerDuty, Cloudflare resolved all of these challenges. PagerDuty ensures that Michael and his team are always notified of incidents as soon as they occur and, if an incident should be handled by a different team, PagerDuty forwards the notification automatically to save time. The Cloudflare SRE team also uses the Operations Command Console, and benefit from capabilities like the highlighting of high-urgency incidents within the Major Incidents Application. As a result, with full-stack visibility into their infrastructure and pattern and anomaly detection, they no longer miss serious events. Michael explained, “When we adopted PagerDuty, we were able to take certain alerts and say to ourselves, this one is really important. We need to deal with it now.” In addition, other capabilities such as PagerDuty’s HipChat integration made it easier for Cloudflare’s SRE team to streamline communication, collaborate, automate ops-related tasks with commands, learn together, and more when responding to incidents. PagerDuty also eliminated the need for SREs to manually look up contact information for the right expert, as individuals, teams, or business stakeholders can be informed and recruited into an incident in just a click. With PagerDuty, they can get in touch instantly. Most importantly, PagerDuty reduced the time it takes Michael and his team to take action on incidents, to a small fraction of what it was previously. “Mean-time-to-action has dropped from minutes to seconds,” Michael said, adding that faster response time translates to greater service reliability and better customer outcomes — which is the ultimate goal and reason why Cloudflare sought out PagerDuty in the first place. “We had several options, but we chose PagerDuty because we had to do less work to make PagerDuty work with our systems. It was very nicely formatted, the API just worked, and the output from the app was very easy to interpret.” - Michael Daly, Engineering Manager, Cloudflare\n\nBlog Travel\n\nTransformation in Travel: Our Q&A with TUI's Head of Technology\n\nThe travel industry is experiencing an unprecedented surge in demand from people seeking adventure and eager to explore new destinations. Given an abundance of choice and the desire to have a personalized experience, customers are turning to tour operators to remove complexity from planning so they can focus on the holiday and not on the process of planning it. As the world’s largest integrated tourism organization, TUI provides end-to-end travel experiences with a network of 400 hotels, 130 aircraft, and 16 cruise ships across the globe. The company has orchestrated a business transformation and a technology transformation to stand up more resilient IT operations, drive efficiency, and power an outstanding digital experience for customers. We sat down with Yasin Quareshy, Head of Technology at TUI, to discuss the transformation, its outcomes, and the role that PagerDuty has played in TUI’s journey to accelerate innovation and win customer trust. Yasin, it seems like everyone is traveling right now. How is this impacting your business? The travel industry is in full recovery mode, and customers are demanding more choices and flexible itineraries. In the last month, we had 54 million searches on our websites. In response to this, we’re adding millions of holiday offerings and dynamic packages where customers can choose a combination of services that they’d like from us. For example, we now offer group tours for customers to travel with like-minded individuals, and we’ve simplified the process of adding extensions at the end of a trip, like a few days at a beachside hotel. Can you talk about TUI’s digital transformation? In the past, TUI grew significantly through acquisitions which resulted in separate IT functions using different technologies and operating processes. Siloed teams and paper-based processes were far too difficult to manage—especially as the business required more innovation to meet rising customer demands. We decided to consolidate everything into a single IT organization with a unified technology stack. Over the past several years, we‘ve transformed to be a technology-driven company. We rebuilt every part of the customer journey from the ground up, using the latest architecture solutions within AWS, and we’re building a high level of resiliency into the solutions and design. You also adopted a DevOps approach as you migrated to the cloud. Can you share more about this? This was not just a transformation of our technology, but also how we are organized. We adopted a DevOps way of working so the person who builds the product is responsible for maintaining and supporting it. Our engineers are given a great level of autonomy, and feel a sense of ownership and accountability in their work. Still, we recognized how much load we were putting onto our engineers. When something goes wrong, it can become quite intensive—responding to not only the time pressure, but the pressure to communicate a consistent set of information to the people who need to know what's actually going on. That’s where PagerDuty came in. We think most companies will relate to those challenges. How did TUI get started with PagerDuty and how are you using the platform today? We integrated all of our services, creating a single pane of glass showing what needs support, who’s supporting it, and what the dependencies are. Incident management was simplified with a single platform for orchestrating response and streamlining communications. This meant teams could focus on managing and resolving incidents without interruption or sharing ongoing recovery updates. But this has evolved. We’ve successfully rolled out PagerDuty across TUI globally. And now, most of the actions related to digital operations and incident resolution are automated. Can you talk more about automating response across your digital infrastructure? PagerDuty has brought the concept of automation to life for us. There’s a lot of automation built into PagerDuty’s AIOps solution. By integrating with applications in our existing stack like JIRA Service Desk and our monitoring tools, all of the information is available in one place. This has reduced the number of incidents and—if there is an issue—PagerDuty tells us exactly where the problem is. On average, the time to recover from an incident is at least 30% quicker. With automated recovery it can be 90% quicker. If we already know a scenario, PagerDuty learns and responds by executing automated scripts to recover from service disruptions. Customers don’t even notice that we’ve had an issue. The business impact is in the millions of dollars saved. Those are some incredible improvements. What impact is all of this having on this business? First, more innovation. Our DevOps engineers spend less time providing supporting functions and more time building great products. This means we’ve accelerated the amount of things that we deliver for our customers. Also, increased revenue. If there is a service disruption, we have a predictable way of responding to that. Reduced service downtime helps us keep to our customer promise, and as a result, we are seeing a higher booking rate. The PagerDuty Operations Cloud is critical for TUI. This is what is actually going to help us grow as a business when it comes to making sure that we provide quality services for our customers. We want to create trust with our customers and PagerDuty allows us to build that trust.

More than three-quarters of the world’s transaction revenue touches an SAP system. In recent years, SAP has been on a journey to digitally transform its business and move customer-facing services to the cloud. As part of his role within the Global Cloud Services (GCS) team, Mitchell Rose, Senior Program Manager, is responsible for the global uptime of these services. “SAP’s vision is to help the world run better and improve people’s lives,” he explained, “but to do this, we need to ensure that there are fewer—and less impactful—cloud outages and incidents that affect our customers.” The Global Cloud Services team’s vision is to help technology teams within SAP ensure that their cloud services and infrastructure remains always on through intelligent outage management. “This meant creating a major incident service that could scale at an SAP level, helping us to ensure the uptime of services such as Ariba, Concur, and Fieldglass,” said Rose. Challenges Hindered Major Incident Response Considering the above challenges, the team knew that developing and rolling out such a service in an organization the size of SAP would be challenging. Many teams were using in-house tools customized for their respective technology teams; however, they weren’t scalable across the entire organization. Over the years, the acquisitions by SAP led to the use of different tools and processes across the organization, making collaboration and cohesion difficult. “Across teams, there were very different operating models,” explained Rose. “There were differences in operational definitions, and the word ‘priority’ had different meanings to different teams. They also had different ticketing systems, ChatOps tools, processes, and practices. To be successful, we needed a best-of-breed platform that mapped to our vision for major incident response. This is why we adopted PagerDuty.” PagerDuty Helps Speed Up Major Incident Response SAP’s Global Cloud Services team uses PagerDuty to orchestrate their major incident response. Since adopting PagerDuty, SAP has improved its major incident handling, reducing initial response and communications times to critical incidents by 30% and resolution times by 26% in two months. “We have successfully reduced the impact and duration of major incidents,” shared Rose. “With PagerDuty, we’re able to engage the right people, on the right issues, at the right time. As a result, we’ve reduced the number of people needed to resolve major incidents by 25% in just two months.” PagerDuty has also helped improve communication between teams and stakeholders. When SAP needs to triage critical, customer-impacting incidents, such as cloud service disruptions, SAP activates “SWAT” mode, its internal critical response procedure. The SWAT team then drives internal business communications, including those responsible for customer communications. Through PagerDuty, the SWAT team has access to real-time information about the status of an incident, allowing them to keep other stakeholders—including senior management—updated. Decisions to engage SWAT mode are made more quickly as a result, helping to reduce major incident response time from hours to minutes in many cases. Driving Greater Collaboration and Ownership GCS has made PagerDuty a key part of its major incident framework so they can better collaborate with Major Incident Management (MIM) teams across SAP. Now, when a major incident occurs, the relevant team—such as the SuccessFactors or Ariba MIM team—is notified to help coordinate the best response. “PagerDuty helped us align core business and technology teams around a common operating model for major incident response,” said Rose. “By using a common framework, we have aligned on processes and criteria for severity and priority. We’re also driving clear responsibility for services during a major incident, which has been scaled at an SAP level.” “PagerDuty has become mission critical for SAP.” - Mitchell Rose, Senior Program Manager, SAP Benefits With PagerDuty Since implementing PagerDuty, SAP’s Global Cloud Services team has improved operational excellence, with benefits including: The ability to engage the right people with the right information in real time, optimizing response to major incidents A 25% reduction in the number of responders needed for major incidents, within two months Greater cross-team collaboration and ownership of services Improved real-time communication with the wider business about major incidents, helping to achieve internal performance SLAs Reduction in impact and duration of major incidents, with response times reduced by 30% and resolution times reduced by 26% Seamless integration with various commercial and in-house tools “PagerDuty has become mission critical for SAP, enabling our teams to collaborate and rapidly respond to major incidents, and helping us to continue to provide SAP customers with world-class digital services,” concluded Rose. Future Looking SAP’s Global Cloud Services team works hard to improve incident troubleshooting and will use PagerDuty postmortem reports, as well as past incidents, to help troubleshoot current issues. In addition, SAP wants to further automate its major incident response process by creating automated runbooks, aligned to key business impact metrics using PagerDuty.

CTC actively trades in a broad spectrum of asset classes, including equities, interest rates, and commodities. Its trading desks are open 20 hours a day, six days a week, and the company is recognized as a leading provider of liquidity and pricing on numerous equities and derivatives exchanges around the world. Because the market fluctuates by the microsecond, CTC’s critical applications and services need to always be online and available for users in a moment's notice to deliver a consistent customer experience, every time. “With our services directly tied into the open market, downtime is just not an option,” explained Luke Rotta, Manager, SRE and Observability at CTC. “If we’re not in the market, we’re not participating in the opportunity—and it’s a missed opportunity.” Rotta is responsible for managing observability at CTC, as well as overseeing the SRE team that supports, automates, and improves uptime for the pre-production and production environments. Before PagerDuty Before implementing PagerDuty, Rotta’s team experienced several challenges, including: Delays in response stemming from a manual on-call directory with outdated schedules and rotations Difficulty communicating with on-call responders during non-business hours Lack of automation embedded into the response process, which led to more manual work for on-call responders A legacy dashboard cluttered with unactionable events and alerts, creating delays in incident acknowledgement and resolution Alert storms that reduced the ability for teams to understand the makeup of, and respond effectively to, incidents With the recent push towards remote work, CTC was forced to quickly pivot operations to a digital-first model. Additionally, heightened market volatility meant that its customers also increased the frequency of their trading, making it more important than ever that the CTC trading platform stayed up and running at all times. To help achieve this, CTC needed to rethink its incident management process while continuing to maintain and deliver a consistent customer experience. This meant Rotta’s teams needed to refocus their efforts on day-to-day operations rather than long-term projects—and all in a new, remote-first environment. “Our teams are laser-focused on making sure systems can handle the increased capacity and deliver liquidity to the marketplace to keep our customers happy,” shared Rotta. Prioritizing Communication and Collaboration Before going remote, most information was communicated verbally in the office. Now, with the entire company working remotely, the ability to effectively communicate and collaborate across teams is more important than ever. PagerDuty helped CTC transform its incident communication channels to be completely digital. “PagerDuty really taught us to spin up an incident remotely and allowed us to centralize our incident management process to quickly assemble teams into a single channel and make decisions directly from there.” CTC also leverages Slack, part of PagerDuty’s ecosystem of over 600+ integrations, to improve incident communication and collaboration between teams, as well as for conducting postmortems. With the Slack integration, teams can create, respond, and resolve PagerDuty incidents directly inside the Slack interface, which alleviates the stress of multiple communication channels and allows all necessary teams to work through the incident together. “Since all teams are remote now, we just create the incident directly in Slack. The playbook tells everybody what Zoom room to jump into, and off we go,” shared Rotta. Improving Operational Visibility In a digital-first environment, it’s critical for stakeholders to have total visibility into the health of their critical systems and services in real time so they can quickly orchestrate a proper response when an incident occurs. Before PagerDuty, CTC used a traditional dashboard that would alert the team about service disruptions and incidents. “We would get what we call the ‘wall of red,’ which was quite literally a screen filled with hundreds of alerts, with no sense of what’s being impacted or what’s going on in our environment,” explained Rotta. To combat this issue, CTC implemented PagerDuty Event Intelligence to automatically group alerts together and cut down the noise for all mission-critical services and applications. “Before PagerDuty, we sometimes had 50-200 alerts coming in at once. With Event Intelligence, that number is now down to 5-10,” explained Rotta. With Event Intelligence, CTC’s response teams also have the context they need to quickly resolve an issue before it becomes widely customer-impacting. “The ability to reduce the noise and clear out alerts within the platform really frees up a lot of time for people on our SRE team to focus on higher-impact tasks,” said Rotta. Like many companies today, CTC needs to continue scaling to keep up with customer demand and new innovations. Even though speed is table stakes at a trading firm such as CTC, running non-latency-sensitive workloads within AWS has given CTC the ability to scale quicker and reduce time to market for ideas. Many of the new services deployed to AWS follow a you-build-it, you-own-it approach and PagerDuty provides a single way to escalate, track, and measure incidents across the company regardless of who owns or supports the service. “The ability to reduce the noise and clear out alerts within the platform really frees up a lot of time for people on our SRE team to focus on higher-impact tasks.” - Luke Rotta, Manager, SRE and Observability, CTC Benefits With PagerDuty Since implementing PagerDuty, CTC has seen several benefits, including: Reduced alert fatigue and improved incident response with PagerDuty Event Intelligence Faster mean-time-to-acknowledge/mean-time-to-respond (MTTA/MTTR) across all critical systems and services Improved day-to-day incident management and the ability to automate the hand-off of incidents from shift to shift An open line of communication with senior traders on the floor that escalates incidents to on-call managers across time zones when needed Seamless incident management experience for 24x7 applications running on AWS PagerDuty also helped support CTC’s business continuity strategy. “In this new, remote environment, employees can feel disconnected from what's going on, and we're trying to solve that with PagerDuty. Almost everyone at the company is on the PagerDuty platform, whether they’re a stakeholder or a full user,” shared Rotta. Future Looking CTC plans to continue expanding its use of PagerDuty across the organization. For example, the company has decided to focus more on metrics to inform future actions, so Rotta’s team is looking into Operational Reviews, as well as PagerDuty Analytics and Intelligent Dashboards, to help better understand team health and the business impact of incidents, measure SLAs, and gain the ability to seamlessly share metrics with executive leadership. “This could help drive decisions around what applications we need to invest in,” explained Rotta. Additionally, while CTC already has all of its major business services set up in Status Dashboards, the company is looking to extend its use across the company by providing executive leadership improved visibility into the status of an incident or a service. As the PagerDuty platform grows with CTC, Rotta and his team look forward to extending the platform's functionality across other parts of their infrastructure. “I like that it’s simple. I don’t have to manage anything because it just does its job,” he shared.

Through a variety of resources, NAMI, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, provides a lifeline to individuals and their families. NAMI is your trusted friend and your guide to navigate you through difficult times, because they’ve been there before and they know the way out. PagerDuty’s commitment to supporting our social impact customers allows for increased support and expansion of critical services, like the ones offered by NAMI. Based in Arlington, Va., NAMI, the United States’ largest grassroots mental health organization, has independent affiliates throughout the nation. Their mission is to provide advocacy, education, support and public awareness so that all individuals and families affected by mental illness can build better lives. It’s a mission PagerDuty proudly supports. They offer multiple programs, including free education and support groups led by those with lived experience with mental health issues. A key service and common first point of contact is NAMI’s HelpLine. The nationwide peer-support service provides information, resource referrals and support to people living with a mental health condition, their family members and caregivers, mental health providers and the public. The HelpLine is largely staffed by volunteers who answer questions, offer support and provide practical next steps. In 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the HelpLine was overwhelmed and stretched to its limit. [video width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" mp4=\"https://www.pagerduty.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NAMI_Video-Recording_FINAL.mp4\"][/video] Pandemic Increases Need For NAMI’s Services The pandemic sparked a huge increase in the need for NAMI’s resources and support. According to The World Health Organization, the global prevalence of anxiety and depression increased by a massive 25 percent during the first two years of the pandemic. At the same time, NAMI saw its HelpLine inquiries skyrocket. “In May of 2020, HelpLine calls went up more than 50 percent,” said Jessica Edwards, Chief Development Officer at NAMI. “The demand increased for our virtual support groups, our HelpLine, our resources online. Everything increased in a very dramatic way because people were really struggling,” Edwards said. The surge didn’t stop after that first month or even that year. The need for NAMI’s services became more crucial, especially as talking openly about mental health conditions became more accepted by society at large. “One of the only bright spots of the pandemic was that mental health finally got the attention that it really needed, because it was more comfortable for people to say they were not OK,” Edwards said. PagerDuty’s Impact Pricing Allows NAMI to Expand Services NAMI needed a way to scale and meet this growing demand for the HelpLine. When they were introduced to PagerDuty and learned about Impact Pricing for nonprofit customers, NAMI found a way to solve its technology needs, giving the HelpLine a much-needed boost. The ability to streamline their on-call schedule and simplify how volunteers were made aware of a crisis call allowed NAMI to scale for the increased demand for the HelpLine. With the support of PagerDuty, NAMI was able to add 40 new HelpLine volunteers and several new full-time staff. “We’re now able to keep pace with necessary capacity for volunteer support, as well as expand our offerings,” Edwards said. “More people are calling the HelpLine,” she added. “More people are wanting guidance and information. So, the more we’re able to leverage technology like PagerDuty to have more volunteers, the more people we can help.” Partnering With PagerDuty to Provide More Support Eliminating the stigma of mental health and steering the public conversation around resources and support is the main focus for NAMI. With help from PagerDuty, they plan to expand services, such as increasing the number of bilingual Spanish- and English-speaking HelpLine volunteers and interns. This gives more access to services to more people in need. “PagerDuty is a company and an organization that is authentic in leveraging technology for social change and social good,” Edwards said. “They really make a change and make a difference. And in our social impact world, these are the kinds of companies that NAMI loves to work and partner with.” Learn more about PagerDuty’s Impact Pricing and see how we help nonprofits accelerate their work and reach.

The company operates daily fantasy sports, a sportsbook, and a casino, providing fans with opportunities to put their own skin in the game by wagering on their favorite team. The growing gaming market in the US is driving increased competition. DraftKings is working to build the best, most trusted, and most customer-centric offerings while rapidly expanding into new markets—like a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace. Josh Engels, Director of Problem Management at DraftKings, is responsible for providing a stable environment to ensure the best fan experience. The priority is engineering resiliency by providing an incident management framework for teams across DraftKings to handle their own issues. “A lot of change occurs on the backend as we grow fast and expand into new markets. We have to make sure we’re stable and offer a great customer experience,” said Engels. Watch Out for a Gronk Spike Football weekends are a critical test for the platform. Gameday sees a steady stream of daily fantasy users picking their lineups ahead of kickoff. As soon as the first touchdown happens, DraftKings sees what they’ve termed a “Gronk Spike.” Fans open and refresh their apps, often doubling platform traffic and stressing the infrastructure. To prevent lost revenue, the company needs to ensure platform availability and rock-solid stability through constant gameday chaos. “Gaming is a highly competitive market,” explained Engels. “If a customer can’t access our service, they will immediately jump to a competitor.” During its start-up years, DraftKings relied on a few key people who knew about its infrastructure to actively monitor systems and fix problems. They were tied to their laptops, carrying them around all day and often distracted from other responsibilities. As the business expanded and the number of platform users grew, so did the number of teams and services. Engels said, “nobody wants to manually monitor 24/7 in a dashboard. We want to be alerted when we need to be notified about an incident.” The increasing complexity of managing technology caused alert fatigue and burnout for engineers. It was difficult to find time to work on new projects—projects that would keep DraftKings in front of the competition. Engels explained, “we need to help teams understand why they’re getting alerted and where these trends are, so they can have more time to innovate.” Using PagerDuty to Streamline Operations and Drive Improvements DraftKings teams adopted a service ownership model, with each product line responsible for writing their own code and supporting it in production. These teams operated under the Problem Management team’s incident management framework, with PagerDuty as its digital operations platform. PagerDuty provided visibility across systems, and enabled DraftKings to handle incidents quickly and reduce recurring problems. DraftKings integrated their key monitoring systems into PagerDuty, and set up schedules and escalations policies. Teams no longer had to carry a computer around. Now, the right person would be notified when there was an issue, providing teams flexibility and freedom. Engels shared, “with PagerDuty, when a service has an issue, we know exactly who's expected to resolve it and where that communication is happening. It’s allowed us to really scale the business.” As teams deploy services, everything is tied into PagerDuty. To reduce manual, repetitive work, an infrastructure as a code software tool is used for initial setup and onboarding. Whenever a new service is deployed, it automatically creates a service within PagerDuty and sets up the specific integrations required. This allows DraftKings to standardize service lists within PagerDuty. Engels commented, “you can look in PagerDuty and see the services we have and who owns them. This was hard to maintain at a growing company. Clarity on service ownership has been another huge benefit of PagerDuty.” Problem Management uses PagerDuty to drive stability, ensuring the product is available for customers. PagerDuty reports provide metrics to identify trends, for example, if there are a lot of incidents related to a particular feature. The data is used to communicate with the business—all the way up to the CTO—providing information around incident status, mean time to resolve, and SLAs. Engels explained, “metrics allow us to make decisions and drive improvements throughout the organization.” The PagerDuty Playbook DraftKings implemented PagerDuty response plays for major incidents—situations where too many alerts are coming in for a single person to manage, or multiple people are receiving alerts on an issue. For example, if Sportsbook has a major incident on football Sunday, the response play will pull in a key engineer with business expertise across the infrastructure as incident commander. The response play can also create an incident-specific video conference meeting and responders can join the conference bridge via PagerDuty. This drives quick resolution during DraftKing’s most critical moments. If there’s an outage, DraftKings will also use response plays to alert the customers as quickly as possible. The Customer Experience team is notified, and can immediately react by putting up a banner inside the app and pushing out communications on social media. This improves the fan experience by keeping them updated with what’s going on. Alternately, if a customer is the first to report an issue, the Customer Experience team uses PagerDuty’s email integration to create an incident and notify the right teams. “PagerDuty helps us know about issues before customers do...PagerDuty has really made us more efficient as a company.” - Josh Engels, Head of Problem Management at DraftKings Benefits with PagerDuty With PagerDuty, DraftKings has improved engineering resiliency and platform stability. Engineers no longer carry laptops around and Gronk Spikes are under control with PagerDuty orchestrating the right response, every time. Since implementing PagerDuty, DraftKings has benefited from: Customer Experience and Loyalty. DraftKings wins fans in a competitive market by maintaining a highly available platform, and proactively communicating when issues do occur. Incident Management. Problem Management’s framework, including PagerDuty’s platform for digital operations and a service ownership model, ensures the right person is notified and can quickly resolve incidents. Innovation. Engineers can focus on growing the product lines without the distraction and burnout of actively monitoring the infrastructure. Flexible Setup. In addition to integrating with monitoring systems, teams can also integrate tools used for their specific product line, and set up schedules and policies that make sense for them. All of this is streamlined using infrastructure as code software. Data-driven Decision Making: DraftKings uses PagerDuty reports to learn and improve operations. MTTR is now under 30 minutes, and issues proactively identified by internal stakeholders is above 90%—a significant improvement. Improved Communication. PagerDuty enables communication across the company for rapid response, including engineering, customer experience, and key business stakeholders.

Here are a few examples of how PagerDuty creates value for global industry leaders. The Value SAP Receives from PagerDuty SAP is a market leader in enterprise application software. And with more than three quarters of the world’s transaction revenue touching an SAP system, uptime is critical. SAP needed to digitally transform its business and move customer-facing services to the cloud. They also needed to ensure that there were fewer and less impactful incidents that could impact the customer experience and put revenue at risk. The task initially appeared easier said than done, especially given SAP’s size. Many teams were using custom in-house tools that weren’t scalable across the organization. There were “islands” of automation where certain sub-processes were moving quickly, but this acceleration wasn’t happening at scale. The exceptionally wide variety of tools and processes across business units and global theaters also made collaboration particularly burdensome. SAP’s Global Cloud Services team now uses PagerDuty to orchestrate their major incident response. We helped improve communication between teams and stakeholders, providing real-time information about the status of an incident and often reducing response time from hours to minutes. PagerDuty helped SAP achieve incredible results in just a couple of months, including: 25% reduction in the number of responders needed for major incidents. Reduced response times by 30%. Resolution times reduced by 26%. Greater cross-team collaboration and ownership of services. Seamless integration with various commercial and in-house tools.

With challenges that limit the capabilities of companies, such as limited employee resources and low customer tolerance for delays in services, reliable and affordable solutions are necessary. In this case, it means disrupting the traditional security industry. Organizations are achieving their goals by relying on automation and technology. Knightscope Leads the Way For the past nine years, Knightscope, an American advanced security technology company, has been leading the charge with its Autonomous Security Robots. The publicly traded company designs, builds and deploys Autonomous Security Robots for use in monitoring people and vehicles in public areas such as malls, parking lots, neighborhoods, and casinos. They have been innovating public safety using robots and proactive monitoring to deter and report security risks. Their mission is ambitious: to make America the safest country in the world. When Knightscope shipped their first robot in 2015, the security robot industry was still in its infancy. With little competition and a blank canvas on the landscape of the industry, Knightscope was a pioneer. They dove head first into the autonomous security robot space and now have contracts for more than 100 autonomous security robots. It Takes a Village All of the Knightscope robots are, essentially, vessels for the company’s API software. The data collected by the robots is their real product. Several departments work together to keep the systems rolling, and they need to ensure that they are working as efficiently as possible. Jane Miller, Senior Operations Manager, manages the Network Operations Center (NOC) at Knightscope, where the team is responsible for maintaining client’s robots—keeping them up and running 24/7. “They're our first line of defense for everything technical going on with our fleet of robots,” said Miller. The NOC needs to be able to handle potential software and hardware issues anytime, including after business hours, such as a computer’s hard drive within the robot filling up. Also, because Knightscope software is running in autonomous security robots, the robot’s vessel can end up with problems independent of the software glitches. For example, it could be vandalized or hit by a car. It may need human intervention in situations where it’s not sure what decision to make. In these situations, the on-call team member must resolve the issue or complete the diagnostics in preparation to pass it over to the appropriate team. Miller is also responsible for the technical client support of Knightscope’s Security Operations Center (KSOC), where Knightscope’s software interface allows clients to interact with their robots. Here, clients can view the video coming from the robots, and have an emergency phone call system where the robots can be programmed to call the Security Team. Clients can also prompt audio announcements if someone is seen as a threat or enters a restricted access zone. With all of the different systems and departments, resolving an issue could get complicated. Because they are a technology company at their core, they know they need a dependable and proven way to align all of the systems and teams. PagerDuty is Their Solution Knightscope has been using PagerDuty since 2015 to manage its real-time operations. It connects the PagerDuty API into its proprietary robotics software to monitor the robot hardware, software, and autonomous decision making. The teams will receive proactive notices via PagerDuty if a piece of software crashes unexpectedly, if the robot physically needs help, or if connection to the robot has been lost. PagerDuty also provides data about the health of the fleet of robots, ensuring new software releases or bug fixes are operating as expected. “We take care of making sure that the robots are doing everything they need to be doing from a security perspective, if it's having any hardware or software issues. If anything comes up, PagerDuty lets us know and we take care of it. If any new issues come up, we investigate, and escalate to our R&D teams,” said Miller. This is where PagerDuty Incident Response shows its value. When a robot isn’t responding the way it should, “We're using PagerDuty to make sure that the robots are doing everything they need to be doing to support the clients,” said Miller. In fact, it's a huge relief for new employees when they start working for Knightscope and see that they can rely on PagerDuty to tell them when something is wrong, instead of wading through mounds of data. PagerDuty has proven to be adaptable and reliable as Knightscope continues to develop new features and platforms. When a technology company, especially an industry disruptor, is at the forefront of tremendous progress, they need to ensure their systems are nimble and can change quickly. “We're still a startup culture, so we're always changing things. It's been really easy for the team to integrate PagerDuty into new technologies—to adapt and grow as we go. It keeps us production-ready; ready to work with our clients.” Knightscope has benefited from PagerDuty because it is: Easy to use - Easily integrated with their software using PagerDuty’s custom APIs. Adaptable and agile - Easy to implement new features, platforms, technologies. Flexible - Easily create and modify rotation schedules & notifications received how you want them. Cost effective - Onsite robots, available 24/7 reduce the need for human staff. The Future is Changing The future for Knightscope seems limitless. In the world of technology, change is certain. With ever changing priorities, crises, budgets and access to reliable employees, companies like Knightscope are constantly looking for ways to create effective and consistent solutions. They are pioneering the new age of security, and they rely on PagerDuty to achieve their goals.

The company operates over 16,000 secured trucks and serves customers in more than 100 countries. Technology is a key component of Brink’s long-term corporate strategy to drive growth and ensure exceptional customer support. In recent years, the company saw an opportunity to modernize and mature its IT ecosystem. Teams were managing workflows manually, and spending too much time and money on repetitive tasks. Deployments, migrations, and changes in the IT environment were also time consuming and often inconsistent. The company needed more scalable solutions moving forward. Identifying Toil The engineering team audited their processes and identified challenges that impacted productivity and overall employee satisfaction. One of these processes was distributing changes in information from one SaaS system of record to other operational systems and tools that lacked native integrations. Their as-is process required the user to manually extract data, modify it to fit the formats required by these other systems, cleanup the data, encrypt it, and then manually upload it to other operational systems. “In cases where native integrations didn’t exist, it was widely agreed that doing this manually was really painful,” explained Robert Powers, IT Automation Manager. While it was a well-documented process, it involved multiple manual steps and several systems across multiple departments. There was a risk of stale data and potential for human error and it took about 10 hours for teams to complete these jobs, adding up to 520 full-time equivalent (FTE) hours per year. Automation to Eliminate Toil and Drive Improvements To address these challenges, the team developed an automation practice using PagerDuty Runbook Automation Self-Hosted. Their goals were to reduce toil, and facilitate simpler and faster deployments, migrations, and changes in the tech stack. They saw automation as a way to drive agility and scalability for IT. “We chose PagerDuty Runbook Automation Self-Hosted because of its simplicity,” Powers commented. Brink’s turned to Runbook Automation Self-Hosted to solve their system of record data transfer challenges. ”By scheduling this workflow with Runbook Automation Self-Hosted and adding in notifications, we were able to turn this into a fully-automated, hands-off process with notifications on completion,” said Powers. Ops systems are now updated in less than one day, and any risk associated with using automation is mitigated by immediately being notified of automation failures. The cost to automate was 20 FTE hours, and the team is now spending 99% less time on the previously manual integration process. “We're saving someone time that they can use on more interesting tasks.” This first project proved its value quickly and helped other teams understand the benefits of automating processes. PagerDuty Runbook Automation Self-Hosted was an easy-to-use solution that eliminated pain in someone’s day-to-day life while reducing costs to the business. Enabling Self-Service Automation As Brink’s automation practice matured, the team focused on delegating the use of automation to other stakeholders—developing a self-service catalog of capabilities that teams could use without relying on a specialist for help. “This has significant potential to make our business much more agile,” explained Powers. Their next automation project aimed to reduce the time it took for expert engineers to provision virtual machines (VMs), and eliminate waiting time for developers who needed those VMs to deploy their software. The process involved users making requests, waiting for the request to be approved by a specialist, and once approved—for other experts to manually deploy and validate the hosts. It took about two weeks for a developer to receive their requested VMs, which was mainly spent waiting for reviews and approvals. By building a self-service automated workflow for building VMs, they reduced a developer’s waiting time from two weeks to 3 minutes. Powers said, \"We chose PagerDuty Runbook Automation Self-Hosted as the orchestrator for this workflow because it gave us the ability to manage these jobs programmatically via an API, which we could integrate with key resources on our platform. Additionally, we were able to present users with a simple and easy-to-use interface with unnecessary features turned off via the access control lists (ACLs) within Ru"
