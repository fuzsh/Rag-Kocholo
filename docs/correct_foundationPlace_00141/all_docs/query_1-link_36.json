Her diverse and eclectic sets blend sonic artifacts ancient and contemporaryâ€”sometimes at onceâ€”with soundtracks, dialogue, and field recordings to create a hauntological soundscape that bumps like a coffin lid. Restaurateur, agency head, DJ and label co-director Sean Bautista holds multiple residencies on Bangkok Community Radio, FM Belowground, and Manila Community Radioâ€”which he co-founded in 2020 as a decentralized volunteer-fueled platform to uplift underrepresented voices, and which Versailles is also a managing partner. \n\nAs part of MCRâ€™s ongoing effort to document the Bisaya regionâ€™s grassroots dance genre budots, theyâ€™re organizing research in Cebu and Davao to explore how privilege impacts understanding of vernacular music, collected through interviews and focus group discussions as well as fieldwork. To help support part of this research, the duo are currently fundraising. For more info, head to @rapidohataw âœ¨\n\nâ€º Full details via our bio ðŸ”—\n\nðŸ“· @sai.versailles\".",
