        "text": "Today’s the big day, folks! The Deckible app is up on the IOS and Google app stores.\n\nThis community is full of talented, insightful creators. I couldn’t be more thrilled about sharing the platform with the world. With options to sort and shuffle cards, journal, and meditate (and more), is by far the only app of its kind.\n\nIn-app and physical decks can also be purchased via deckible.com. We have 42 featured decks (my included) and two decks will be free for everyone as a sweet onboarding gift. My deck can be found here.\n\nShout out to Deckible founder Nick Kellet (and narrator of the video below) for being our fearless leader…and a great inspiration. For everyone interested in physical decks, orders are usually processed within 1–2 weeks, packed with a Fresnel lens and shipped with tracking.\n\nOrders can be placed via Etsy too. Discounts and bulk pricing are available on my website.\n\nI developed my to help people sit with life’s big questions. Whether you’re reflecting on your own, chatting with friends, or deliberating during a staff meeting, I designed it for solo and community reflection about what really matters.\n\nHere’s how I designed the structure of my deck:\n\nMapped a person’s life into ever-expanding circles (the self, the bio/chosen/adoptive family/-ies, the social conditions via households, relationships, community and religious centers, city/town/[un]incorporated community, state, nation, world)\n\nActively tried to avoid framing and language that was ableist, sexist, racist, xenophobic, classist, or victim-blaming\n\nBelieved that everyone is a cultural beneficiary, agent, and eventual ancestor (even if we don’t have children, we play personal roles in collectively bequeathing a world)\n\nAsked questions that would make my child self proud (for their bravery, playfulness, and transparency)\n\nConsidered how people would interact with the physical and digital versions of my deck\n\nGrowing up “reading” my mother and attempting to support her with her cognitive disability and pain condition made me ultra-sensitive to how people navigate the world and what we create. I really want the folks who’ll receive orders to enjoy the experience.\n\nAt its core, I want the deck to be reassuring without praising stagnation, thought provoking without being triggering, and innocent (no hollow gotcha questions) while probing.\n\nMy questions are framed with the understanding that certain conditions/circumstances pre-date us…and even still we’re compelled to contend with them according to our abilities and inclinations — hopefully with a set of solid values and a humane vision for the world in tow.\n\nThis pandemic has forced us to reconsider so many of the ideas, motivations, and historical circumstances (personal, familial, and cultural) that got us here. I think it’s important we (re)consider what keeps us going and why.\n\nSpanish and Braille versions are coming up soon. Looking forward to updating you.\n\n…\n\nBio at the time of original publication:\n\nRayshauna Gray is the creator of The Heart Work, a framework that helps people interrogate how imposter syndrome impacts their lives. Her recently released 72-card Modus Operandi Deck is designed for meaningful solo and group reflection.\n\nShe is one of the researchers delving into the history of enslaved people at Cambridge’s Longfellow House and Washington Headquarters. This project is spearheaded by the National Park Service and the National Council on Public History."
