        "text": "ENTREPRENEURIAL STYLES, CORPORATE CULTURES GIVE THESE SECOND-STAGE COMPANIES COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES\n\nOrlando, Fla. (September 2, 2015) — ISGF is among 50 statewide companies expected to see significant growth over the next several years. ISGF was selected from more than 500 nominees for Florida Companies to WatchSM, a statewide program managed by economic development group GrowFL, in association with the Edward Lowe Foundation.\n\nISGF’s management team, competitive market position and strong community involvement were among several factors that put them in contention for the award.\n\n“These stand-out companies are all led by entrepreneurs, and have demonstrated their capacity and intent to grow,” said Dr. Tom O’Neal, executive director of the Florida Economic Gardening Institute and associate vice president for the University of Central Florida’s Oﬃce of Research and Commercialization. “They also all have critical intellectual property or a niche position that gives them a competitive edge in their markets,” he said.\n\nJoining ISGF on the Florida Companies to Watch list are the following Florida-based businesses:\n\nAccessibility Services, Inc.

(Hollywood)\n\nYellowPepper (Miami)\n\nZobily (Sarasota)\n\n“This is a strong group of companies that deserve this special recognition given annually to the state’s top second stage companies,” said Dr. O’Neal. Second-stage companies are defined as those with six to 99 full-time employees and between $750,000 and $50 million in annual revenue. There are many programs and incubators promoting start-up businesses; GrowFL is the only Florida program that focuses exclusively on second-stage companies.\n\nThe 50 companies named the 2015 Florida Companies to Watch generated a total of more than $1.2 billion in revenue and added nearly 1,000 employees between 2011 and 2014. Together, the companies project a 23 percent increase in revenue and 19 percent increase in job growth in 2015. Companies named to the list will be oﬃcially recognized November 5 at the Hard Rock Live, Universal CityWalk, Orlando.\n\nFor more information, visit flctw.growfl.com.\n\n####\n\nMore About ISGF:\n\nFounded in 1991, ISGF specializes in Information Technology recruitment and staffing in 48 states.
