WHAT IS THE VALUE OF THE ENTREPRENEUR? “Out of every one hundred [people], ten shouldn't even be there, eighty are just targets, nine are the real fighters, and we are lucky to have them, for they make the battle. Ah, but the one, one is a warrior, and he will bring the others back.” ―Heraclitus\n\n6. © 2014 Modus Operandi, Inc. , All Rights Reserved. 6 • Innovation is stretching one’s conceptual boundaries and embracing the art of the possible • Innovation thus provides the underlying conceptual capital necessary to be entrepreneurial. • Innovation is about generating concepts and ideas that at their very core are disruptive • Provide an upheaval of commonly accepted norms • Entrepreneurs take innovative concepts and use them to produce new goods and services INNOVATION AND THE ENTREPRENEUR\n\n7. © 2015 Modus Operandi, Inc. , All Rights Reserved. 7 There is no single technology to rule all your data – it has to combine different approaches TRADITIONAL RESPONSES ARE NOT WORKING The following techniques are not enough: • Data Warehousing • Data Lakes • Over-reliance on Hadoop • More hardware • Front-end visualization tools\n\n8. © 2014 Modus Operandi, Inc. , All Rights Reserved. 8 APPLICATIONS TO SOFTWARE DESIGN & DEVELOPMENT • Data science is a growing field in academic settings • Can it actually be applied to real software? What would this look like? • Reasoning over big data is key • Applying formal logic to capture context is proving to be very valuable • Growing need to link business drivers to technology • Too much emphasis is spent on Volume and Velocity (for basic look-ups) • Metadata is once again a hot topic – especially with the rise in data Variety & Veracity\n\n9. © 2015 Modus Operandi, Inc. , All Rights Reserved. 9 LESSONS FROM THE INTELLIGENCE DOMAIN Real-World Data & Knowledge Capture Flexible UIs and Model Mgt. Ontologies and Data Models Large Scale Graph Stores Users, Collaborations, Curations The intelligence domain offers a glimpse into Data Science complexities: • Complex environments require detailed analytics capture • Large-scale connectivity is needed between data and real world facts • Reasoning is needed to infer missing data and codify patterns • Situational awareness needs context - Spatial, Temporal, Cognitive and Social Context all matter • Users need to collaborate over the same data simultaneously\n\n10. © 2015 Modus Operandi, Inc. , All Rights Reserved. 10 Advanced Big Data Analytics tool that integrates your data, automates processes and provides alerts when necessary - breaking down silos and barriers in your organization. Captures real human concepts and perspectives (in context) allowing your data to behave more like you do, rather than force you to behave like your data.\n\n11. © 2015 Modus Operandi, Inc. , All Rights Reserved. 11 • Advanced metaphysics – not just data models • Layered models connect data sources with higher- order classifications • Federation to scale • Implied patterns become explicit • Codifies organizational objectives • Tracks complex items of interest • Bridges to reference resources SMART-LAYERED DATA MODELS ARE NEEDED Data Source Models Multi- & Single-Source Data Integration Models Domain Models (Objs, Attributes, Process & Relations) System Lvl Models (Business Rules) Provenance,Trust UserAccessModels Upper-Lvl Models Meta-data Levels (Human Concepts) Data-centric Levels (Machine Language)\n\n12. © 2015 Modus Operandi, Inc. , All Rights Reserved. 12 ONTOLOGY GRAPH MAPPING Ontologies should be easily manipulated to integrate all data across an enterprise\n\n13. © 2015 Modus Operandi, Inc. , All Rights Reserved. 13 Doc Repo Provenance ARCHITECTING SOFTWARE FOR THE 21ST CENTURY Source Handler Artifact Process or BASE Predicate Store CSV Source Handler Artifact Process or MOVIA Modeler Tweak model Entity Manager Service Repopulate Refined Store Reasoner New Viz New Views Add-change Rules Items adapted for Specific Customer Engagement Statistical Analytical Processing EnterpriseResources"
