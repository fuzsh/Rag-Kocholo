Read on for tips and resources for the application process.\n\nOnce you have found a job opening you want to apply for, there are several steps to keep in mind during the application process. First, is researching the organization and job requirements. Knowing and incorporating information such as the professional background of the hiring manager, the value/goals driving the employers, and the modus operandi of the organization will help you stand out and heighten your credibility as an applicant.\n\nDon’t be afraid to call the hiring manager in the early stages of the application process. This communication can help you better gauge the position, what type of candidate they are looking for, and what will be expected of you. Additionally, it could be beneficial to ask more practical questions about the hiring process. Inquiring in regard to proper interview attire or even where to park for the interview may help reduce preparation stress. With the possibility of dozens or even hundreds of other applicants, calling the hiring manager with thoughtful concerns may grant additional name recognition once the application reviewing stage begins, however, do not simply call without a specific intent.\n\n​\n\nEnsuring that you feel comfortable in your potential work environment is equally as important as the job itself. Researching the composition of the board and leadership of the employers as well as whether they have an explicit equity statement are quick ways to gauge whether they are committed to ensuring inclusive working conditions. On the job listing itself, having a clear salary for the position is an easy way to determine whether you believe the work would be worth your time and effort. Additional means of verifying the employer’s commitment to an inclusive work environment can include recognition/participation in culturally relevant events and holidays, providing resources for professional development, collaborating with local community programs and leaders, whether they maintain citizenship requirements, and (if possible to research) whether your potential coworkers reflect a diverse and safe work environment.\n\nFollowing your preparation and research about the employers, it is time to start on the application. Most applications will require both a resume and a cover letter. Both Glassdoor and Indeed have appropriate resume examples and templates that you can use.\n\nIn lieu of interviewing every single applicant, cover letters serve as a barometer of your interests and personality for the hiring manager. The cover letter is likely the most important part of your application, so it will pay to take your time with it. For a do’s and don’ts list for cover letters, look up the Harvard Business Review’s guide to cover letters. Make sure to imbue your personality into your cover letter. This document is meant to bring the ‘human’ element of your application. Don’t be afraid to let your enthusiasm for the environment and the position shine through.\n\n​\n\nWhen gearing up to submit your application, double and triple check all your information to ensure it is correct and that you have included all the required information. It also doesn’t hurt to check your voicemail and rerecord if it’s less than professional. Ideally, you should hear back from the hiring manager within two weeks of submitting your application. If you haven’t, you can always follow up with an email or call to check on your application’s status.\n\nIf you are selected for an interview there are several things you can do to prepare. Refamiliarizing yourself with the organization's goals and track record can aid you in answering questions about why you applied or what you bring to them. Practicing with a friend or family member can help you be more precise in your answering and bring additional confidence to the interview. It may also be worthwhile to think of questions to ask the hiring manager for after the interview. The best questions to ask are ones that a) you are genuinely curious about and b) illustrate a clear professional and developmental interest in the organization. Topics such as opportunities for leadership development, training, workplace culture, and inter-department collaborations can demonstrate initiative and a personal investment in their work.\n\nPlaces to Find Opportunities\n\nLinkedIn can be a valuable resource to network with people in the environmental field and find relevant jobs, however, try not to apply for the positions directly through LinkedIn. Instead, look up the job opening on the employer’s website, as there are sometimes formatting and notification issues when using LinkedIn’s platform. The tables below offer more specialized resources that can help you find career and networking opportunities in your field of interest.​\n\n​​​​​​​\n\nOrganizations that Support Black Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) Networking and Environmental Engagement\n\n​​\n\nNational Groups\n\n​​\n\nLocal Groups\n\n​\n\nJob Boards\n\n​"
