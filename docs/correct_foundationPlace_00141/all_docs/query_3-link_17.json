I love gardening, science, data, and of course, yarn, knitting, color, and creating.\n\nOver 10 years ago, I began learning and working in farming with organic gardening practices. After years at a data-driven desk job, I wanted to incorporate gardening and creating back into my day to day. I wanted to do something that made me feel fully present and at peace.\n\nSo, I began dyeing yarn with natural dyes and plants from my garden. I fell in love. The gardening, science, experimenting, and creativity fulfilled my soul in a way I had not felt in a long time. Modus Operandi Fibers became a space to grow fully into myself, and then it became my business.\n\nI love sharing the beauty of and process behind naturally dyed yarn, especially with those new to working with naturally dyed items. By providing a wide array of bases, from superwash merino to rustic highland wool, I hope to have a little something for everyone, expanding the reach and love of naturally dyed yarn.\n\nThank you for being here. I hope you enjoy what I've created, and I can't wait to see what you create with MO Fibers naturally dyed yarn."
