Rivero, Chief of Police, University of Miami Police Department, Coral Gables, Florida; and John P. Pepper, Crime Prevention and Emergency Management Coordinator, University of Miami Police Department, Coral Gables, Florida Click to view the digital edition. atrol has been, is, and will continue to be the backbone of college and local policing. Response to emergency and nonemergency calls to patrol officers for service is a primary component of policing or, more specifically, reactive policing. Most law enforcement commanders would say they try to eliminate the need for their patrol officers to be reactive through the institution of various proactive patrol initiatives. It’s a valid concept in theory and in proven practice: prevent the crimes before they happen so reactive, after-the-fact response becomes unnecessary. The result is fewer persons victimized, less financial and personal loss, less overall crime, and more police recognition and appreciation. Everyone wins. Though many college and local law enforcement agencies are often busy with reactive call response, most agencies would cite that, at any given time, there is at least one officer available and not assigned to any call. The question then becomes how to best utilize these limited available patrol resources to proactively prevent future reactive responses. Random patrol has long been an accepted allocation of these available patrol resources. The University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida, sought a better and more effective methodology for preventing crime that is focused and targeted at the times and locations where crimes are likely to occur. Crime is often cited as unpredictable. To some extent, it is, but to some extent, it is not. It is basically impossible to know exactly when and where a specific crime is going to occur without good intelligence. It is, however, possible to identify general locations and corresponding times when crimes may be more likely to occur. Some law enforcement agencies have recognized this through crime analysis and crime mapping techniques. At certain times, in certain areas, and under certain conditions, crime will occur at an above-average rate; often, such situational convergences are referred to as “hot spots.” Some agencies use this information to direct available patrol resources to hot spots during the times of high crime incidence. Specific planned events also recognized the need for additional attention from current patrolling officers, as more people means more potential for crimes. Often, crime analysis data and event scheduling data lead to the issuance of general be-on- the-lookout (BOLO) notices and watch orders for regular on-duty officers. These are effective guidance tools. At the University of Miami, it was decided to institutionalize daily guidance to the officers thro ...\n\nFinal PaperI consider the internship as an opportunity that allo.docx\n\nFinal PaperI consider the internship as an opportunity that allo.docxssuser454af01\n\nFinal Paper I consider the internship as an opportunity that allows me to learn how the real work is and start apply what I have learned. As part of my internship, through a formal education program and as part of my education at University of New Haven. Despite the reason, every individual that experience an internship can attest to loads of skills, values, understanding and information attained through the experience. The latter information was proven true to me when I was assigned for an internship at the NHPD, New Haven Police Department. I was subjected to different situations and calls that relate different theories impacted to me through study lessons. The experience allowed me to recommend students in different fields to experience such an excellent internship program. The internship remains valuable learning experience for my colleagues, and me especially when they are undertaking different programs and trips relating to the U.S. criminal justice system. The internship program involved different experiences, such as processing evidence. The process of evidence collection starts with seizing of evidence. Also, officers at the NHPD demonstrated to me the process of identifying fingerprints, which helps in identification of the gun owner. The information proves valuable, as there are varied things that can never be present in class to facilitate first-hand understanding of a situation. Similarly, the internship allowed me to have a deeper understanding of the value and strategy of writing a police report. I thought that reading was only relevant to English classes, but it extends to my carrier. I learned valuable information from reading cases relating to robbery, homicide among other reports. Additionally, I attained additional information about the difference in police operations and the way in which they communicate. There are new strategies that I learned on communication and operation between police departments, other agencies and other private organizations like UNH. For Instance, the NHPD system applies the system of Community Policing. The system allows the public to attend the meetings, which consider a helpful tactic in fighting crime. I can confess that I was impressed by the system. During my ride along with a police officer at the NHPD, I noticed that the staff in department is cooperative and helpful. I expect to find the same situation in Saudi Arabia, but I prefer addressing the current situation. The staffs involve significant cooperation with the agents in relation to time and effort. Consequently, the team attains significant information in different cases. My internship experience provides me with information that might help me in improve the criminal system in Saudi Arabia to the better. Further, as part of my internship that involve presentation in the police department. Presentation remains valuable as it allowed my colleagues and I to see different aspects of the policing systems with Chief Roy Davis.

Private security investigators are hired by a business or organization and are not held to the high legal and ethical standard faced by the police but they also do not have the same power of discretion. Law enforcement is responsible for investigating crimes that occur within their jurisdiction while private security investigates legal, financial, and company matters. Public criminal investigation involve the search for a criminal that if identified will be arrested and tried for the crime while private investigation involve developing enough information to alert law enforcement of a crime. Differences and Similarities between Sectors The criminal investigation involves public officials hired by the state. The private investigation involves private security personnel hired to investigate different aspect for an organization. The public criminal investigator of the crime is a member of law enforcement and has the authority to investigate the crime from the state where they work. The criminal investigation begins once a crime has been reported or discovered by the police. Once the investigator arrives on scene they will be required to follow procedures outlined by their police department as well as follow the law when conducting their investigation. Once police develop a criminal suspect they must adhere to the law to ensure any evidence that is obtained is not excluded from the court process (Vessel, 2011). Once private security personnel develop a suspect for a crime they must alert the police. Police officers are restricted in their actions based on the civil liberties of the criminal suspect. When conducting searches for evidence, law enforcement must not conduct illegal searches to ensure evidence is not excluded and the rights of the offender are not violated. Police officers must also ensure when a criminal suspect will be interrogated that they are read their Miranda Rights in order to ensure any testimony provided by the suspect is not excluded from the court process. Private criminal investigators do not have the same restrictions and as long as they do not violate the law are not subject to the same rule and regulation as the police. The Exclusionary rule was created to ensure if police violate the rights of the defendants any evidence that is obtained can be excluded from the court process resulting in a guilty offender going free. Criminal investigators must also adhere to the uniform standards established when investigating and collecting evidence. This includes documenting the evidence when located and protecting the evidence from becoming damaged, lost, or destroyed.

Put yourself in the shoes of the officers in the scenarios. How would you ensure that the best possible outcome is accomplished? The branches of criminal justice may appear to function autonomously, but there is a lot of interaction and collaboration between them. In this part of the career investigation, you will need to think about some scenarios where communication and collaboration would be required for these branches to function effectively. Which branch appears to be more in line with how you approach communication and collaboration? Read the following scenarios and answer each prompt. How does the ability to conduct legal searches differ between the police officer, probation officer, and corrections officer in the performance of their duties? A police officer was conducting an investigation involving an incarcerated prisoner. The police officer would like to know who the prisoner spoke to on the phone and who visited him. Describe who the police officer would need to collaborate with to obtain that information, explaining why. Lou, a suspect the officer was investigating in a burglary case, was just convicted for that crime. Prior to his sentence, a pre-sentence report must be conducted. Who is most likely to conduct the investigation: the police officer, probation officer, or the corrections officer? Who will he or she collaborate with to complete the report? Support your response by explaining how this process impacts interagency collaboration. Select one court case from the Milestone One Guidelines and Rubric document where communication and collaboration was a driving factor, and discuss the impact of that case in reshaping the role of the corrections practitioner. Based on your findings regarding the differences in how each branch communicates with each other, which career path is most in line with your communication and collaboration practices and why? For additional details, please refer to the Milestone One Guidelines and Rubric document and the Final Project Document in the Assignment Guidelines and Rubrics section of the course. .\n\nhow would a police department exhibit different structure and procedur.docx\n\nhow would a police department exhibit different structure and procedur.docxcliftonl1\n\nhow would a police department exhibit different structure and procedures under the crime control model than it would under the due process model? Solution Two models of crime: the due process model and the crime control model posses their own advantages and disadvantages Due process model provides an each and every people have equal rights and they cannot be underprivileged of life, liberty, or property without proper legal procedures. When people are arrested due to a crime then also they have their own rights such that they does not harm anyone and it is facilitated by Due process model. There are various dissimilarities in-between the due process model and the crime control model: The due process model thinks that people who are arrested by means of any event there ma be a chance that particular person doesnot do it anything and somebody involve him in this case. So he will be protected until it was proven and statement should be given by the court. Where as the Crime Control Model Process states tha the person who was arrested is right person who has done all those crimes so that particular person must be punished accordingly with respect to the safty of the remaining public. Crime control system believes that if it had done by maintaining the Due process it will take long l But the due process has equal rights to all the people because in some situations the people who did not do the crime also has a chance that somebody involve them into this crime. So we have to give chance to prove themselves that they are not accused so generally the court fallowes the due process model that says that every one are equal before the law. .\n\nAccessing Data to Support Pesticide Residue and Emerging Contaminant Analysis...\n\nAccessing Data to Support Pesticide Residue and Emerging Contaminant Analysis...US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure\n\nIn recent years, the growth of scientific data and the increasing need for data sharing and collaboration in the field of environmental chemistry has led to the creation of various software and databases that facilitate research and development into the safety and toxicity of chemicals. The US-EPA Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure has been developing software and databases that serve the chemistry community for many years. This presentation will focus on several web-based software applications which have been developed at the USEPA and made available to the community. While the primary software application from the Center is the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard which provides access to data for >1.2 million chemicals (https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard), almost a dozen proof-of-concept applications have been built serving various capabilities. The publicly accessible proof-of-concept Cheminformatics Modules (https://www.epa.gov/chemicalresearch/cheminformatics) provides access to multiple applications in development allowing for hazard comparison for sets of chemicals, structure-substructure-similarity searching, structure alerts and batch QSAR prediction of both physicochemical and toxicity endpoints. A number of other applications, presently in development but not publicly accessible will also be discussed. These include AMOS, the database of Analytical Methods and Open Spectra. Analytical methods can vary in nature from detailed regulatory methods to more summary in nature. Regulatory method documents can include details of analytes which can be studied, supported matrices, reagents, methodological details, statistical performance, interlaboratory validation and other details. Summary methods provide a general overview of reagents, instrumentation and commonly a short list of analytes. Regulatory bodies including the US Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA), US Geological Survey (USGS), US Department of Agriculture (USDA) and others provide detailed analytical methods and collections of summary methods from the agrochemical industry, such as the US-EPA Environmental Chemistry Methods (https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-analytical-methods/environmental-chemistry-methods-ecm). Instrument vendors also provide access to many hundreds of application notes which can be considered as summary methods. AMOS presently contains >4,500 methods integrated to their chemical structures and > 230,000 public domain mass spectral data. AMOS allows for filtering of methods based on analyte, chemical class, method source and other related metadata. AMOS is an important facet of the developing Non-Targeted Analysis WebApp presently also in development at the EPA. This presentation will provide an overview of existing publicly accessible Dashboards and work in progress to support analysis of pesticides, veterinary drug residues, and other chemicals in food, animal feed, and environmental samples."
