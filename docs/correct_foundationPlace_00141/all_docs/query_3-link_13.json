It is where many trendy and groundbreaking routines and techniques were being shared. Some of these items have since been exposed while others remain hidden. You may have seen variations or even purchased some of these as single trick DVDs.\n\nThe eight issues of MO, which spanned from 1993-1996, were very exclusive. There are very few complete sets in existence and even single issues are almost impossible to find.\n\nContributors included: Arturo de Ascanio, Jack Birnman, Christian Chelman, Doug Conn, Daryl, Peter Duffie, \"State-Street\" Eddie Fay, Lee Freed, Phil Goldstein, Dan Harlan, Brad Henderson, Chris Kenner, Simon Lovell, Edward Marlo, Jon Racherbaumer, Steve Reynolds, Daniel Rhod, Jean-Jacques Sanvert, Bob Sheets, Ken Simmons, Gerry Surma, Jean-Pierre Vallarino and many others.\n\nSome of the routines and techniques include: Another Invisible 21-Card Trick, Ascanio’s Floating Double, Banded Together, Bravura Transposition, Calculated Invisible Toss, Caribbean Assembly, Chameleon Sandwich, Conn’s Opening, Don’t Be Superstitious, Eddie Marlo Lives!, Flutterless Bottom Deal, Graduates Interchange, In Situ Glimpse, Incomplete Surprise, Invisible Palm Festival, Janus Cards to Wallet, Kick-Counting On It!, Killer Kitson Miracle, Lollapalooza Prediction, Observation Test, On the Clip Palm, Playing the Light, Professional Color Vision, Psychic Leap Frog, Rhod Show, Rhumba Count Display, Royal Rollover, Sharper’s Image, Shifting, Whispering Thoughts, Stranger Succession Aces, Subtle Scoop Addition, Swivel Change, The Spectator Works Harder to Triumph, Total A-Band-a-Ment, Universal Mexican, Whispering Snitch and much more.\n\nPublished by Spade & Archer in 2014. 242 pages written and compiled by Jon Racherbaumer with an introduction by Meir Yedid. 8.5\"x11\" softcover with more than 180 photographs."
