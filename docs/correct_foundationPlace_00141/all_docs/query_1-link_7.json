        "text": "MO is a multi-year post-secondary program that provides relevant contemporary dance development to 30 aspiring professionals between the ages of 18 and 25. Each year of the program runs from September to June and is divided into three terms that are separated by winter and spring breaks. While every term incorporates all aspects of the curriculum, the central focus of the program evolves from foundational technique to creative practice and performance. Students train an average of 33 hours per week, with additional hours devoted to mentorship meetings and dialogue. The daily schedule includes one to two technique and conditioning classes followed by one to two complementary classes in performance and creation studies.\n\nBecause the student body is composed of dancers with a wide range of expertise and backgrounds, a core value of the program is that students at all levels continue to train together. In the first term, students are divided according to their needs and work in small groups for three to five hours per week. Although mentorship and assessment is ongoing throughout, the end of each term provides a period for reflection in which mentors and students can reassess development and objectives.\n\nRigorous & Diverse Foundational Training and repetition are the backbone of the curriculum, along with the development of sophisticated physiological understanding across multiple contemporary dance languages. We prioritize foundation classes, which are taught by core faculty and are programmed frequently. Twice a week the student body is divided to receive targeted lessons. Bodywork and somatic practices, including Movement Patterning, Body-Mind Centering, Pilates, Gyrokinesis, and Yoga, ensure that our students graduate with exceptional, relevant technical training.\n\nMO is hailed for the spectrum of methods and perspectives that we present to our students. Our program offers an intensive series of Unique Contemporary Dance Methods, including Hip Hop, Classical Indian, African Dance, Martial Arts, and Butoh, to further the relevance and adaptability of our students’ skillsets. Interpretation & Transformation, Theatre, and Voice introduce students to new interpretive territory and provide them with the tools to broaden and deepen artistic and technical skills, perspective, endurance, and connections between traditions.\n\nWe believe that Dance Making & Improvisation are critical tools for innovative independent artists and collaborators. These skills are incorporated into technique classes and also programmed separately, in dance making and improvisation classes.\n\nPartner Work is offered in several sessions in the form of technique classes and contact improvisation as well as diverse repertoire and within students’ own choreographic development.\n\nChoreographic Workshops bring the processes of active professional choreographers into experimental labs. Students engage with an assortment of creative perspectives, approaches, and environments, and are asked to contextualize their training, offer their perspectives, and contribute to momentum. In addition, students are involved with three to five New Creations for Performance each year.\n\nRepertoire includes the study of 10-20 excerpts of diverse and demanding solo, partnering, and ensemble work, and has recently included work from Kidd Pivot, Company 605, Serge Bennathan, Tentacle Tribe, Out Innerspace, Radical System Art, Justine A. Chambers, and Compagnie La Mer Noire.\n\nPublic Performance & Practice offers a breadth of performance experience in a variety of public locations. Students are introduced to the possibilities of outdoor performance and gatherings, and together with professionals, stage their own experiments, using content drawn from the professionals’ experience and the students’ own creativity and desires.\n\nDance on Screen has been a part of the MO curriculum since its inception and offers a new platform for students to explore and refine their creative interests. Students work individually and collectively behind and in front of the camera and with editing programs. They work with a variety of directives as well as create their own works supported by professionals. They learn new ways in which to collaborate and to disseminate their ideas, and come to consider sound, space, and dance in new ways. Each year a selection of dance on screen projects are shared at the year end performances and MO Sunset Screening.\n\nMentorship, Assessment & Career Navigation are ongoing activities that incorporate group dialogue, meetings, written assignments, and directed study. Each student receives a minimum of three individual meetings with the Directors in addition to group meetings, and personal feedback from faculty who watch class and who integrate feedback into their classes. Students learn to understand the demands inherent in each course and to relate them across their multi-year development. Students develop their goals, personal regimens, and critical self-assessments alongside their mentors. Dialogue, writing, and creative tasks empower students to take charge of their own progress through productive self-assessment.\n\nThe Graduate “Focus Group” offers programming for the third- and fourth-year students to further develop their own practice and amplify the practicum to match professional process. Activity is planned in collaboration with the students and designed to support their individual interests and needs. They prioritize their resources, drive their own process, bring their questions together for peer research, facilitate their own showings and feedback, and select their own mentors. Upon graduation, students’ portfolios include four to eight video projects, substantial solo and group material created by themselves, over 15 excerpts of professional repertoire, and over ten creations by professionals including solos, duets, ensemble, improvised, and evening-length works. A large collection of written work span their four-year development. With the assistance of mentors, they develop their choreographic voices and tools as well as their own regimens in physical therapy, improvisation, movement generation, and reflection. Collective writing, artistic statements, developmental questions, and dialogue help students to build a verbal and written language to support their physical one.\n\nMO offers 3 ways to audition for the Full-Time Program; by attending an intensive in-person, attending an audition day in-person, or by sending a video application.
