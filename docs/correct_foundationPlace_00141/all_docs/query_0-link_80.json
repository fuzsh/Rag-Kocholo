        "text": "In today’s technological world, human intertwinement with the rest of nature has been severely diminished. In our digital culture, many people hardly have any direct experience of and sense of connection with “the real” of the natural world. The author assumes that when we want to find ways to mend this gap, arts-based environmental education (AEE) can play a meaningful role. In AEE, artmaking is regarded as itself a way of potentially gaining new understandings about our natural environment. As a reflective practitioner, the author facilitated three different AEE activities, at several times and at diverse locations. On basis of his observations, memories, written notes, audio-visual recordings and interviews with participants, teachers and informed outsiders, he interpreted the experiences both of participants and himself. To this end he employed interpretative phenomenological analysis paired with autoethnography. The artmaking activities researched here aimed to bring about a shift in focus. Participants were encouraged to approach natural phenomena not head-on, but in an indirect way. Moreover, the artmaking process aspired to heighten their awareness to the presence of their embodied self at a certain place. The research questions that the author poses in this study are: (1) What is distinctive in the process of the AEE activities that I facilitate?; (2) Which specific competencies can be identified for a facilitator of AEE activities?; and (3) Does participating in the AEE activities that I facilitate enhance the ability of participants to have a direct experience of feeling connected to the natural world? In this explorative study, the author identifies facilitated estrangement through participating in AEE as an important catalyst when aiming to evoke such instances of transformative learning. In undergoing such moments, participants grope their way in a new liminal space. Artmaking can create favorable conditions for this to happen through its defamiliarizing effect which takes participants away from merely acting according to habit (on “autopilot”). The open-ended structure of the artmaking activities contributed to the creation of a learning arena in which emergent properties could become manifest. Thus, participants could potentially experience a sense of wonder and begin to acquire new understandings – a form of knowing that the author calls “rudimentary cognition.” The research further suggests that a facilitator should be able to bear witness to and hold the space for whatever enfolds in this encounter with artistic process in AEE. He or she must walk the tightrope between control and non-interfering. The analysis of the impacts of the AEE activities that were facilitated leads the author to conclude that it is doubtful whether these in and of themselves caused participants to experience the natural environment in demonstrable new and deep ways. He asserts that most of their awareness was focused on the internal level of their own embodied presence; engagement with place, the location where the AEE activity was performed, seemed secondary. The findings show that AEE activities first and foremost help bring about the ignition and augmentation of the participants’ fascination and curiosity, centered in an increased awareness of their own body and its interactions with the natural world. The present study can be seen as a contribution to efforts of envisaging innovative forms of sustainable education that challenge the way we have distanced ourselves from the more-than-human world.\n\nCan you imagine a world where no-one goes outside? Our world is under threat from human activities, from what we do, and the way we do it. This will have a huge impact on our future lives, and we need to think about how we protect places and the people, animals and plants found there. Whilst, there is a widely-recognised need to address this threat, there is a specific focus on how we can involve young people in this process. Within this, there is additional concern about how little time children and young people spend outside. My qualitative study responds to these concerns by exploring young people’s relationship with nature, and how this may be developed through the projects we offer them. The participating projects have been spread across England, from south-east to north-west, including rural, coastal and urban environments. The young people, aged between 11 and 25, were from diverse backgrounds, with a wide range of individual needs. This transdisciplinary research has used an...\n\nChildren are spending significantly less time in nature than ever before. The decline in nature based play has been precipitated by many factors, including: increased risk aversion and fear amongst parents, poor play opportunities for children and the rapid embrace of digital technology as recreation by young people. These factors all contribute to a collective and individual loss of childhood experience with nature. At the same time, young people are increasingly aware of the unprecedented level of climate change, pollution, habitat destruction and species extinction and the effect it could have on their futures. Thus, there is an urgent need for new approaches to environmental learning that celebrates children's agency, supporting them to directly contribute to ecological systems and global sustainability across communities. This paper explores the potential of creative nature-based play to contribute to children's identity and understanding of the natural world through a practice-led research project, Running Wild (2016). Running Wild was conducted with Polyglot Theatre in collaboration with Year 6 students from Mahogany Rise Primary School (Frankston North) and the Royal Botanic Gardens (Cranbourne). The aim of the project was to introduce the students to their natural reserve ('The Pines') through participatory art-making in collaboration with local artists, scientists and Indigenous elders. This included the opportunity for children to build their own habitats or 'cubbies' , make animal costumes and plant native seedlings at The Pines, resulting in an outdoor performance for their families and friends. Running Wild not only demonstrated increased nature-connection amongst the students, but also the importance of creative nature-based play in improving learning capacities and wellbeing, as well as promoting opportunities for environmental leadership."
