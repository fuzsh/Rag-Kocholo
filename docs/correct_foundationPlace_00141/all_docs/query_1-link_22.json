Grace Farms was designed by renowned architect Kazuyo Sejima – #SANAA co-founder and the 2nd woman to be awarded the #Pritzker Prize in 2010. Grace Farms Foundation was founded by women, and women are at the helm of the Foundation’s leadership. Five out of the Foundation’s 6 senior executives are women, over half of the directors and managers are women leading the team of nearly 100! The Foundation’s Board also has gender parity.\n\nFrom the start of opening Grace Farms in 2015 - our public benefit subsidiary, @gracefarmsfoods’ coffee is sourced exclusively from women-led co-ops in Ethiopia, Colombia, and Indonesia that we have partnered with since 2014. By partnering with these co-ops, every drip invests in female entrepreneurs and empowers women through financial independence. Each co-op has continued to grow, providing more employment to more women each year. On top of that, 100% of the profits helps Grace Farms’ work to end forced labor worldwide through the @dffmovement.\n\nTo continue celebrating International Women’s Day, and as part of the Foundation’s 4th annual Making Space for Women Series by @karen.kariuki, join a conversation with 4 elite university Presidents for the Foundation’s “Madam President: Women Leaders in Higher Education” program, featuring @presbeilock, President of @barnardcollege and President-Elect of @dartmouthcollege; Frances Bronet, President of @prattinstitute; Helene Gayle, MD, President of @spelman_college; and Laura Sparks, President of @thecooperunion for the Advancement of Science and Art. Grace Farms’ CEO and Founder, Sharon Prince, will moderate the panel. Of our country’s elite universities, just 22% are led by female presidents, according to a 2022 study by the American Association of University Women and the Eos Foundation Women’s Power Gap Initiative. It’s an honor to welcome transformative women leaders in higher education who continue to pave the way!
