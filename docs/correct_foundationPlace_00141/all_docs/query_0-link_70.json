        "text": "Tucked away in the FAQ section of Weave Movement Theatre’s website is an inconspicuous looking dot point. Under the heading “What will I learn in a Weave workshop” is the statement “Explore and push the limits of movement, questioning the norms and socially acceptable ways of moving and dancing”. Disabled people push physical limits and social norms every day, even without a workshop, so it’s powerful currency to see those experiences translated through the multidimensional looking glass that is Weave Theatre."
