        "text": "When faced with a problem to solve, your brain reaches an answer through a thinking process that associates pieces of information (data) together based on patterns you have learned. Movia’s living intelligence solution works the same way. Your organization’s experts work together to collect data, including documents, photos, multimedia, social media, GEOINT, MASINT, PAI/SOCMINT and other available information. Using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML), Movia™ breaks that information down into individual objects of knowledge and tags each with extensive metadata, empowering the objects to understand their origins and history and how they relate to other objects. The information objects are then stored in a knowledge graph, ready to assemble themselves into a response when a query is made.\n\nMovia™ goes beyond keyword searches to build linkages and correlations between these information objects, responding with the latest and most relevant information you need to inform your critical decisions. If information has been updated, it notifies those users that a change has been made since the last time they referenced it. Movia™ offers the latest knowledge available, providing living intelligence to your users.\n\nMovia’s integrated workflow enables process-compliant vetting, approval and integration of new knowledge. This encourages your Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to contribute special experiences and wisdom they would like to pass on to others. Because they can see near-real-time results, Movia helps you capture the tribal knowledge of your SMEs, making the rest of your team stronger by their experiences.\n\nWith Movia™, your responses are presented in your approved format, with visualizations that enable fast comprehension and situational awareness. Your team of experts will be more connected, feel empowered and discover the solutions for perplexing dilemmas faster than ever.\n\nMovia™ encourages your team to securely collaborate to provide the important data needed. Your team will find an advanced editor with more editing features and extensive templates. Whenever data is added or updated, it automatically routes it for approval, and it is added to the knowledge graph. When there is an update to the knowledge graph, team members are alerted and quickly see that their input matters. By receiving alerts of any changes, it replaces stale, outdated information with Living Intelligence.\n\nMovia™ also offers a unique document comparison capability, enabling users to quickly compare documents, displaying the similarities and differences between them. This celebrated feature is helping teams spot fraud, waste and abuse in government programs, protecting taxpayer dollars.\n\nMovia™ filters its responses to the clearance level appropriate for the users, preventing unauthorized users from viewing classified information. If policy allows, it can make available the unclassified information from within otherwise unavailable documents, delivering whatever knowledge can be securely shared. This keeps team members safe and eliminates the possibility of specified knowledge objects being viewed by those not cleared to see them. This is an innovative way to truly maximize the value of your organization’s knowledge and to avoid withholding information elements that could benefit your team members."
