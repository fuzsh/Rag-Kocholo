        "text": "ENTER impacts the socialization process of young people by incorporating the idea of Jewish peoplehood into their lives through formal and informal education. A growing consensus has emerged that by improving literacy, building knowledge and expanding opportunities for experiential learning—both in Israel and across the Jewish world—we can bolster solidarity, mutual responsibility and respect. A core aspect of Jewish peoplehood is the belief that we are part of one extended family, and through our efforts we believe this spirit can be nurtured and deepened. We are investing in formal education (school systems), informal education (youth movements, camps, experiential learning) and public education (traditional and social media).\n\nOur in-house data mapping points to a significant disconnect between researchers and operators, and the difficulty in yielding overarching lessons given the wide variety of methodologies and approaches in use. The “Jewish peoplehood index” – or set of indices – will identify trends, better distinguish sub-group variation, assess both attitudes and behaviours, and expand the measurement of interventions. Moreover, such data would provide a more nuanced, evidence-based understanding of the broader stresses and strains in Israel-Diaspora relations. To view the recommendations from our Jewish Peoplehood mapping project click here. For the full report, please click here.\n\nDare to Ask is a series of online videos that aims to offer insight into the lives of different communities and break down stereotypes while answering the questions people are afraid to ask. During the first season, Israelis answer questions regarding topics such as Judaism as a whole, American in the eyes of Israelis and more.\n\nThis simple and unique format allows for dealing with light and breezy questions alongside hard and tricky ones. The pilot season offers a unique insight to conflicting Israeli issues by showcasing a variety of different opinions and people tackling the same issue. By talking about taboo issues in such a manner, we can better understand tricky and complex situations in Israel and allow people to form their own opinion on the matter ahead.\n\nClick here to watch the full trailer. To watch the episodes – click here.\n\nDare to Ask is a join initiative between ENTER and The Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County.\n\nENTER’s One2One cross-cultural exchange, in partnership with RootOne, an initiative of The Jewish Education Project, and the Israeli Ministry of Education, allows young people to meet for a series of curated 1:1 video encounters focused on Jewish peoplehood.\n\nThe One2One program is an opportunity for Jewish high schoolers to connect around shared interests and Jewish life. One2One seeks to build connections between Jewish high schoolers from Israel and around the world. By raising awareness of Jewish values like “mutual responsibility” (arvut hadadit in Hebrew), the program aims to build a sense of Jewish peoplehood. To learn more about One2One, please visit here.\n\nENTER’s “Peoplehood Infused Schools” initiative, a collaboration with the Israeli Ministry of Education, Jewish federations, private donors, and the Jewish Agency, offers a certification for Israeli public schools that adopt an integrated set of values and programs designed to raise awareness about World Jewry. This initiative addresses a major gap, especially in the majority secular state-supported system (Mamlachti), where levels of Jewish peoplehood awareness are particularly low. The initiative is designed to complement more formal curriculum-based projects introduced in recent years by government ministries and national institutions. The program is based on a 5 pillars model which is implemented in each school based on its unique characters. Click here to learn more about the program.\n\nENTER initiated and co-sponsored a field mapping survey in Israel, to better understand its’ emerging Jewish Peoplehood professional ecosystem. The mapping effort is designed to improve the collective understanding of who is leading the Jewish Peoplehood field in Israel, how deeply this work is penetrating into Israeli society, and where gaps may exist. Over a period of six months, nearly 350 Israeli professionals representing over 60 organizations were surveyed. The findings of the mapping are available through a technological platform, and enable organizations to update their programs and projects and maintain a current, relevant snapshot of the sector at any given point in time. The findings and recommendations were presented at a major gathering of peoplehood professionals. The event, led by lead researcher Dr. Ezra Kopelowitz, and representatives of all the co-sponsors, included a keynote address from Dr. Nachman Shai, Minister of Diaspora Affairs.\n\nAlon Friedman is the Founding Executive Director of “ENTER: The Jewish Peoplehood Alliance”.\n\nBetween 2012-2019 Alon served as head of the Israel office of Hillel International and as CEO of the Hillels of Israel, operating 8 campus centers across the country.\n\nPrior to this position, Alon served as Associate Director of MASA Israel Programs (2008-2012), as the Executive Director of the WUJS Institute in Arad (2004-2008) and as a National Emissary (Shaliach), developing educational resources and cultivating pro-Israel activities among college students on North American campuses (2001-2004).\n\nAlon began his educational career in 1994 as a group leader for summer programs in Israel.
