        "meta_description": "The National Defense Mega Directory is the database dedicated to defense contractors, helping them find the products & services they need. Modus Operandi, Inc. - Modus Operandi is a high-tech software company serving the U.S. defense and intelligence community. Our purpose is to help defend and protect our country, our allies, and our planet by providing innovative software for transforming data into wisdom.\r\n\r\nAt Modus Operandi our passion is harnessing data to empower smarter decisions. We deliver technology that helps organizations discover the hidden patterns of potential threats and opportunities—the genius—locked in their data. Our approach combines our advanced solutions that leverage next generation semantic technologies, with our team’s rare engineering and scientific expertise, and our rigorous implementation methodology.\r\n\r\nWe are focused on the development and marketing of technology, services, and solutions to deliver information-based intelligence capabilities. Our solutions combine innovative semantic technology and defense sector software systems development. We have experience in the domains of command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR). Our software automates data evolution – the transformation of Data to Information to Knowledge and, ultimately, to Wisdom (DIKW).\r\n\r\nOur defense customers include the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, Missile Defense Agency, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. We typically support customer mission-environments that are characterized by large volumes of data—from multiple sources, in multiple formats, and representing multiple types of intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY MODUS OPERANDI\r\nModus Operandi, brings three unique elements to our engagements with our customers:\r\n\r\nOur innovative data evolution products and services portfolio.\r\nDIKW* technical knowledge and ISR domain expertise.\r\nWe learn the customer’s vision and make it our own.\r\n* DIKW = Data to Information to Knowledge to Wisdom\r\n\r\nDuring our engagements with our customers, we also offer this Promise:\r\n\r\nOur Promise to our Customers: We promise to provide visible, incremental capabilities which are responsive to your evolving needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORE VALUES\r\nAt Modus Operandi, our core values define the very heart of our company’s identity. We believe that the code of behavior defined by a shared value system is vital to a healthy culture. Our core values provide a solid foundation for delivering exceptional value to our customers.\r\n\r\nWe believe certain values should go without saying … things like producing quality work, acting with integrity, being honest…. Our guiding beliefs – our Ethos – go beyond these basic expectations. We demonstrate our core values in:\r\n\r\nWorking toward the greater good\r\nOur dedication to do what is needed to support our customers and our company\r\nFearlessness in taking on challenges and supporting the mission\r\nAcquiring, maintaining and demonstrating outstanding skills\r\nOur willingness to go above and beyond the call of duty\r\nActing in the spirit of All for one and one for all\r\nDoing what is right\r\nWe express this code of behavior in a single core value …\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Act with the Ethos of a Musketeer.\r\n\r\nMusketeers are most familiar to us through the fictional works of Alexandre Dumas, however his characters were based on real historical figures. Later, well after the publication of Dumas’ novels, we have the example of an American hero, the Marquis de Lafayette, who started his military career as a French Musketeer. Musketeers were dedicated to the service of their King their country, and their units, as we are to our customers, our company, and our colleagues. They continuously honed their skills, were fearless, and highly loyal to each other, and countless times went above and beyond the call of duty in service of the greater good.\r\n\r\nThe Musketeers embodied all of the behaviors found in the ethos of the people of Modus Operandi, and they are a fitting namesake for our core values.",
