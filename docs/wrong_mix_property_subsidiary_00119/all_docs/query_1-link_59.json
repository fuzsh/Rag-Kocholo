        "text": "LA JOLLA, CA, December 12, 2018 /24-7PressRelease/ -- Marquis Who's Who, the world's premier publisher of biographical profiles, is proud to present George Hans Burgin, PhD, with the Albert Nelson Marquis Lifetime Achievement Award. An accomplished listee, Dr. Burgin celebrates many years' experience in his professional network, and has been noted for achievements, leadership qualities, and the credentials and successes he has accrued in his field. As in all Marquis Who's Who biographical volumes, individuals profiled are selected on the basis of current reference value. Factors such as position, noteworthy accomplishments, visibility, and prominence in a field are all taken into account during the selection process.\n\nDr. Burgin is a computer scientist who has been involved in the field for more than 55 years. Since 2002, he has been a senior staff scientist with Natural Selection Inc. in La Jolla, California, a company that applies sophisticated, nature-inspired, computational intelligence algorithms for predictive analytics and forecasting.\n\nOver the course of his career, Dr. Burgin continuously climbed the ranks, earning both respect and expertise in the field. First working as a design specialist with General Dynamics Corporation in San Diego, California between 1962 and 1964, he then spent another 18 years as a senior scientist with Decision Science until 1982. He later served as a senior and chief scientist, principal staff engineer and chief engineer with several other reputable organizations, including Triton Network Systems Inc., IBM in Encinitas, California, and CommQuest Services Inc.\n\nDr. Burgin was responsible for the invention of the adaptive maneuvering logic air combat simulation program. He also holds several patents for an algorithm for a quadrature modulator pre-compensation. Furthermore, he has contributed numerous articles to academic journals, contributed to the proceedings of the Society of Photographic Instrumentation Engineers in volume 6700 in 2007, authored a program called \"Adaptive Maneuvering Logic\" and was a contributing author of the 1989 second edition of the book \"Simulation.\"\n\nThanks to his extensive experience in control systems for air to air combat, Dr. Burgin became a consultant in the design, development and testing of the Cyclocrane, invented by Art Crimmins, and built by Aerolift in Tillamook, OR. The cyclocrane was a highly maneuverable flying object, capable of landing and taking off in inaccessible areas to transport heavy objects such as logs. Dr. Burgin was present at the first piloted test flight in Tillamook in 1985. Despite successful test flights, it turned out that the cyclocrane was not suitable for commercial use because of very high costs.\n\nBeginning in 1979, Dr. Burgin taught for 10 years as a lecturer at San Diego State University in California. In recent years, he spoke at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' World Congress on Computational Intelligence in Beijing, China in 2014. He is a senior life member of the organization.\n\nHonored in 2018 with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Dr. Burgin has been showcased in every edition of Who's Who in America from 1989 to 2016 and every edition of Who's Who in the West from 2001 to 2015. He has also been cited in the first and 11th editions of Who's Who in Science and Engineering and the seventh and eighth editions of Who's Who in American Education.\n\nBorn in Liestal, Switzerland, Dr. Burgin later attended a local high school where many of his friends went on to study engineering at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland. Following the same path, he graduated from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in 1953 with a diploma in engineering, followed by a Doctor of Philosophy in electrical engineering in 1961. He also served as a first lieutenant in the Swiss Armed Forces. Relocating to the United States soon after, Dr. Burgin became a certified professional engineer in the state of California and began working for Convair Astronautics, which piqued his interest in the aerospace field.\n\nMarried to his wife Ulrike Franziska Burgin since July 1960, Dr. Burgin is the proud father of three and grandfather of six. In his down time, he enjoys rock polishing and jewelry making. He is also an avid runner who often competed in marathons.\n\nIn recognition of outstanding contributions to his profession and the Marquis Who's Who community, Dr. Burgin has been featured on the Albert Nelson Marquis Lifetime Achievement website.
