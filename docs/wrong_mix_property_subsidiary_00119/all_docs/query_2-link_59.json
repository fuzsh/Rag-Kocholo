Extensive work has been done on strain, dislocations, and mechanical stability of strained layers, and a large number of papers have appeared on these subjects during the last 15 years. This work is treated in detail in Chapters 2 and 3 and should be useful to engineers and material scientists concerned with effects of strain on the mechanical properties of crystalline layers of any material. The effects of strain on band structure, transport, and optical properties treated in Chapters 3 and 4 are more specific to GeSi strained layers. These chapters form the basis for understanding the design and modelling of strained-layer devices as discussed in Chapters 6 through 8. At the time of this writing, GeSi strained layer heterostructure bipolar transistors and optical detectors have shown great promise. One chapter is devoted to each of these two devices. Field effect devices are discussed in Chapter 8. Other devices that have been fabricated using GeSi strained layers are also discussed briefly in Chapter 8. In addition, this chapter contains a discussion of miscellaneous applications of GeSi alloys. The subject matter is treated at a level appropriate for students and researchers in material science, design, and modelling of semiconductor devices. In a monograph of this size, it is not possible to discuss the entire subject in a comprehensive manner. Excellent books and reviews on the MBE and CVD growth techniques have appeared. Growth technology and processes of device fabrication are not included in the book. However, the merits of the different technologies are discussed. Some four thousand papers of high quality have appeared on strained layers and devices in the last fifteen years. I have quoted over four hundred papers in the bibliography that are most relevant for a coherent discussion of the subject. To make the bibliography more useful, titles of the papers have been included. I must express my gratitude to the late Professor Sir K. S. Krishnan, F.R.S., who taught me the techniques of investigation. I have benefitted from interaction and collaboration with such a large number of colleagues that it is impossible to mention them all individually. Interaction and discussions with my graduate students at NPL, IIT and Solid State Physics Laboratory (all at Delhi) have been very stimulating. My several visits to Harwell Laboratory in the U.K. and interaction with Dr. A. B. Lidiard, Dr. A. E. Hughes, Dr. R. Bullough, Dr. A. M. Stoneham and Dr. A. Atkinson have been particularly useful. A considxi\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nerable part of this book was written during the time I worked at the Clarendon Laboratory. I am very grateful to Professor R. A. Cowley and Dr. 3. M. Baker for providing me with facilities at the laboratory. I have derived considerable benefit from my stay at IMEC and as a visiting professor of KU Leuven, TU Aachen and TU Delft. I am indebted to Professor R. Van Overstraeten, Professor R. Mertens and Professor P. Balk for providing me with these opportunities. I wish to extend special thanks to Mr. Charles G. Arthur, Vice President and Associate EditoriM Director of Academic Press for his personal support for this project. He and his colleagues always showed the utmost consideration to me. It was due to the skill and efforts of his colleague Mr. Joe O'Toole that the project could be completed in a relatively short time. He deserves my sincere thanks. The help of Ms. Pascha Gerlinger, head of the production department, was invaluable in removing the deficiencies in the typing and structure of the manuscript. I am grateful to Mr. T. J. Gosling for reading and making valuable comments on parts of the manuscript. Finally, I must thank sincerely my wife Sudha for her unfailing support and help during the preparation of this book. S. C. Jain Clarendon Laboratory April 4, 1994\n\nP r e f a c e to t h e s e c o n d edition The first edition of this book \"Germanium-Silicon Strained Layers and Heterostructures\" was published in 1994, but its writing was completed in early 1993. Since 1993 there has been a steady flow of new ideas, new understanding, new SiGe structures and new devices with enhanced performance. Several breakthroughs have been made in the growth and doping technology of these layers. High performance Heterostructure Bipolar Transistors (HBTs) for both analog and digital circuits have been developed and have gone into commercial production. The performance of the SiGe p-channel Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) has become comparable to that. of the n-channel Si-MOSFET. The second edition of the book describes the recent developments in the SiGe technology and modelling. Doping the SiGe layers with about 1% carbon suppresses undesirable transient enhanced diffusion of boron. Therefore SiGeC layers have acquired great importance. One whole chapter is devoted to the growth and diffusion in SiGeC layers. Effects of carbon on band structure, mobility, and device performance are discussed in other appropriate chapters. The number of papers that have been published recently on SiGe strained layers and devices is very large. We have quoted over 400 papers in the bibliography which are most relevant for a coherent discussion of the subject. To make the bibliography more useful, titles of the papers have been included. Only about 15% of these references are common with the first edition. According to the usage in the current literature, the name of the book has been changed from \"Germanium-Silicon Strained Layers and Heterostructures\" to \"Silicon-Germanium Strained Layers and Heterostructures\" The subject matter is treated at a level appropriate for students and senior researchers interested in material science, and in designing and modelling semiconductor devices. The book should be useful to engineers and scientists concerned with effects of strain on the properties of crystalline layers of any material and with the physics of Heterostructures. Almost all properties, mechanical, electrical, and optical, are affected by strain. One of us (SCJ) is grateful to Professor R. Mertens, Director of Materials, Components and Packaging (MCP) Division at IMEC, who introduced him xiii\n\nxiv\n\nPreface to the second edition\n\nto strain and SiGe Heterostructures in 1986. J. Poortmans, R. Mertens and other members of the MCP Division did extensive work on material properties of strained SiGe. SCJ participated in this work. Considerable work on Heterostructures has been done in the group of M. Willander at Gothenburg University/Chalmers University. Some of this work along with the work done at Bell Laboratories and at IBM laid the foundations of the SiGe technology. We have collaborated in the Heterostructure work with many scientists and colleagues at Gothenburg University/Chalmers University of Technology and at IMEC. In our most recent work we have collaborated with Prof. Herman Maes, the then Director of STDI Division at IMEC, and with other members of the STDI Division. We have been benefited by discussions we had with our colleagues. We express our sincere thanks to Ms. Amanda Weaver Manager of Materials Division at Elsevier for her continuous support and help without which it would have been difficult to complete this project. Dr. Lucy Dickinson, publishing editor, did a thorough job of checking the manuscript and made corrections/modifications which improved the manuscript considerably. We are grateful to both Ms. Weaver and Dr. Dickinson for their help. We are also grateful to IMEC librarian Greet Vanhoof and her colleague Karin Schoubben for the excellent work they did in providing us with bibliographies and obtaining papers, books and Conference Proceedings from libraries abroad. Finally, we thank sincerely our wives for their unfailing support and help during the preparation of this book.\n\nS. C. Jain IMEC, Kapeldreef 75 3001 Leuven, Belgium\n\nM. Willander Gothenburg University/Chalmers University of Technology Department of Physics S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nChapter 1\n\nIntroduction 1.1 1.1.1\n\nDevelopment of SiGe technology Early\n\ndevelopments\n\nExtensive work was done on Sil_xGex strained layers and devices during 1980s and early 1990s [1]. It was found that the strain induced changes in the band structure can be exploited to design high performance semiconductor devices. Strained layers fabricated by selective area growth can be used for monolithic integration of microwave and optoelectronic devices, for close packing density and for vertical integration for system applications. Methods of growth and characterization were developed during this period. Improvements in the understanding of material parameters were made and several devices were fabricated. Electron mobilities in excess of 173,000 cm 2 V-1 s-1 at 1.5 K were reported. Double Heterostructure Bipolar Transistors (DHBTs, or simply HBTs), optical detectors and many other devices were developed. HBTs with cutoff frequencies of 94 GHz, detectors for optical communication (1.3 to 1.5 #m range) and for defence and space applications (8 to 18 #m range), MOSFETs with high transconductance, high-mobility MODFETs and many new devices were developed. Previously many of these devices were being fabricated using exclusively III-V compound semiconductors. Extensive studies of selectively grown SiGe stripes, SiGe quantum wires and quantum dots were made. Raman shift Aw3 and the shift AE of the heavy hole luminescence band due to strain were measured and used for determination of strain. Most of this work is described in the first edition of this book published in 1994 [1]. 1.1.2\n\nRecent\n\ndevelopments\n\nThe progress in SiGe technology has been more rapid after the publication of the first edition of this book [1]. More than 400 papers are cited in the bibliography of the present book. The bibliography includes 21 papers published in 2002 [2][22], 60 published in 2001 [23]-[82], 44 published in 2000 [83]-[126], 34 published\n\n2\n\nCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\n\nin 1999 [127]-[160], 29 published in 1998 [161]-[189], 19 in 1997 [190]-[208], 17 in 1996 [209]-[225], and 12 in 1995 [226]-[237]. The above data do not imply that the number of papers published on SiGe was small in 1995 or in other earlier years. The number of papers quoted from any one year is not related to the total number published in that year. However the data does show that SiGe technology if of great topical importance. Recently significant advances have been made in our understanding of strain. Strain and strain relaxation in SiGe layers and devices have been discussed in Refs. [221, 197, 222, 163, 125]. Stresses in strained low dimensional samples (quantum wires and quantum dots) are highly nonuniform. Jain et al. (see references just cited) have shown that the stresses in low dimensional samples can be determined using the observed value of the Raman shift Aw3 or of the PL shift Aw3. Using the method of Jain et al. and the observed values of Aw3 and AE, the stresses in the low dimensional structures have been determined. In the early days SiGe HBT8 displayed reasonably high fT (unit current gain cutoff frequency) values and impressive performance in digital circuit gate delays [1,279]. At that time the analog circuits required higher voltages (10 V for analog as compared to 3.6 V for the digital circuits). Therefore development of the analog circuits was slow. However analog voltages have now decreased and the BVc~o are now comparable at 3.6 V for both anMog and digital circuits. Extensive work has been done to optimize the HBT for analog applications. HBTs with high values of fT and at the same time low values of intrinsic and extrinsic base resistances have now been designed and fabricated. Optimization of several parameters (low base-resistance, high fT, high fmax, low CB capacitance, and BVcEo ~ 3.6 V) has been done. Very recently record values of fmax -- 180 GHz [22] and of fT : 210 [82] GHz have been obtained. For analog circuits an additional figure of merit is the product of current gain/3 and Early voltage VA. Early effect with low values of the product/3VA is undesirable for the analog circuits. A large value of the product 3VA suppresses changes in the output current when large variation in bias voltage takes place [273]. In Si BJT, VA increases with the base doping NA but at the same time decreases, it is approximately inversely proportional to NA. Therefore the product/3VA can not be increased to high values. In SiGe HBTs both/3 and VA increase with strain induced bandgap reduction AEg. Therefore it is possible to obtain very high values of both fm~x and BVcF_,o, of fmax and fW and of the product /3VA [169, 200, 273]. High yield is necessary for high levels of integration. It is also important for reducing the cost and increasing the range of applications of the SiGe devices. SiGe BiCMOS technology is now as reliable as Si technology [62, 63]. Circuits involving 4000 to 1.8 million SiGe HBTs can be manufactured [176, 199]. Significant advances have also been made in p-channel MOSFETs [101]. The performance of SiGe p-MOSFETs has become as good as that of Si n-MOSFETs. This will have a great impact on CMOS technology. As the devices are scaled to 100 nm and sub-100 nm dimensions, transient enhanced diffusion (TED) of boron becomes a problem [20]. Though investigations of carbon doped layers were made in early and mid 1990s, and it was\n\n1.2.

Presumably the costs for the SiGe layers given in the table are for the MBE laboratory technology. The difference in costs of the Si and SiGe BiCMOS ICs is estimated to be very small.

In view of the technical importance of suppressing TED, extensive work has been done on carbon containing SiGe layers. Material parameters of the SiGeC layers have been studied. Equilibrium substitutional solubility of C, C~q, is small and is well known [183]. Stangl et al. [184] have investigated lattice parameters of SiGeC layers with Ge concentration up to 1.8% and carbon concentration up to 2%. A significant negative deviation from the Vegard's law was found. Electrical properties of SiGe are significantly affected by carbon [137]. Shivaram et al. [115] have measured the minority carrier lifetime in p+-Si/p-SiGeC/n-Si/n+-Si diodes. Band-structure of Sil_x_yGexCy quantum wells grown on Si(001) [186] and band offsets of p+Sil_x_yGexCy/p-Si(lO0) [189] have been investigated. By analyzing the optical data it was concluded that carbon decreases the valence band offset by 26 9 1 meV/% carbon. This value is practically the same as the reduction of bandgap of the SiGe layers by carbon [206, 189]. It is concluded that whole of the bandgap reduction is due to the change of the valence band edge, the effect on the conduction band offset is negligible. A whole chapter, chapter 4, is devoted to diffusion in SiGeC layers. Bandstructure of Sil_~_yGexCy layers, their optical and electrical properties and application of carbon to HBTs and FETs are discussed in other appropriate chapters.\n\n1.2\n\nCommercial production of SiGe devices\n\nSiGe HBTs have reached the market place. A review of the commercial applications has been published by Metzger [138]. Table 1.1 shows that the cost of SiGe circuits is only slightly more than that of the Si circuits and considerably lower than the cost of III-V circuits. The market for RF LSIs for microwave applications is increasing rapidly (see Fig. 1.1). Because of the low cost and other advantages, 10% of this i.e. $1.9 billion will be for SiGe ICs for wireless and optical communications. $1 billion will be for mixed signal and digital ICs\n\n4\n\nCHAPTER1.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFigure 1.1: Present communication market for SiGe ICs is $ 30 million. It will rise to $ 459 in 2002 and to $ 1.8 billion in 2005. The total communication market in 2005 will be a staggering $ 1 9 billion [138].\n\nand $ 800 million will be for the analog RFIC market. SiGe will share the market with GaAs for components found in the front-end of the receiver portion. These components are LNAs, IFs, mixers and VCOs [138]. Several companies are manufacturing SiGe HBT-based circuits [138]. IBM have an 8\" SiGe BiCMOS line in Burlington Vermont with fW -- 50 GHz, fmax -- 70 GHz, and gate-length of the CMOS process - 0.4 micron. IBM offers SiGe products for RF front-end applications. The devices are designed mainly for receiver components such as LNAs, VCOs, mixers and for discrete HBTs. Their first products are hand-held cellular and GPS. At present 70% of GPS applications are in the automotive applications. Their front end devices and circuits work at 3 V and in the frequency range 800-1900 MHz necessary for GSM, CDMA and PCS. IBM's LNA has a noise figure of 1.2 dB. IBM has also made foundry agreements with customers who can fabricate devices of their own design at the IBM facilities. Commquest, now a subsidiary of IBM, is developing a single chip system for a mother board to make devices such as laptops as wireless devices [138]. Lucent Technologies have started manufacturing SiGe ICs for SONET/SDH applications at 10 Gbps using 0.25 #m SiGe process [138]. So far these components have been the domain exclusively of expensive GaAs technology. In comparison to GaAs, the SiGe devices are smaller and use less current and less power. The process was developed at Bell Labs and the first products are expected to reach the market soon [138]. Temic has a 6\" SiGe HBT line at Heilbronn in Germany. Temic technology has changed from MBE-based technology developed originally at Daimler Benz\n\n1.3.

The Heilbronn facility also provides foundry type facilities. Temic has transferred the SiGe expertise to the existing Colorado Si BiCMOS facility in order to set up the SiGe BiCMOS production facility. Infineon in Germany have started manufacturing the first duM band SiGe LNAs and PLLs for mobile communication. NEC in Japan have set up a SiGe line at Yamagata for mass production of SiGe devices. More details of the commercial activities in this field are given in Ref. [138].\n\n1.3\n\nLandmarks devices\n\nin the\n\ndevelopment\n\nof SiGe\n\nSemiconductor heterostructure devices rely on the difference in the bandgaps of the two semiconductors used to fabricate the structure. The concept of the heterostructure device is not new: use of semiconductors of different bandgaps in a device was suggested by Shockley in a patent granted to him in 1951 [285]. The concept of a \"heterostructure\" contained in this patent is purely electrical, i.e., a semiconductor consisting of two zones that have different bandgaps. Ideally speaking, we want to have a piece of semiconductor with no discontinuities of any kind except a gradual or an abrupt change of bandgap. However, a heterostructure of different bandgaps can be constructed only by using two different semiconductors. In the early days of heterostructure devices, the emphasis was on finding a pair of semiconductors with differing bandgaps but with nearly the same lattice constant so that a good epilayer of one semiconductor could be grown on the other. In these lattice-matched heterostructures, the interface is of high quality without defects that can be detrimental to the relevant electrical properties. GaxAll_xAs and GaAs are closely lattice matched for all values of x. The bandgap of AlAs is much bigger than that of GaAs, and difference in bandgaps of GaxAll_~As and GaAs can be adjusted by varying the value of x. Ge is chemically compatible with Si and has a smaller bandgap so that it does offer the possibility of constructing heterostructures based on Si technology. Gnutzmann and Clausecker [253] suggested the possibility of fabricating a quasi-direct bandgap heterostructure using the zone folding effects of a superlattice and mentioned the possibility of using GeSi heterostructures for this purpose. The lattice mismatch between Si and Ge is rather large (4.2%), making it difficult to grow good quality layers of GexSil_~ alloys on a Si substrate. Many attempts to grow good Ge epilayers on Si were made in the late 1960s and early 1970s but device quality layers with good interfaces could not be grown (see review of Jain et el. [299] for references). The present success of strained layer epitaxy and devices is due to an important paper written many years ago by Frank and Van der Merwe [259] predicting that a coherent (or pseudomorphic) epilayer of a crystal can be grown on a substrate of slightly different lattice constant. The concepts of zones of different bandgaps in a device, contained in Shockley's 1951 patent, and of strained layer\n\n6\n\nC H A P T E R 1. I N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nepitaxy, contained in Frank and Van der Merwe's paper [259], were published several decades ahead of their times, for these ideas have been exploited only in recent years. Following the patent on heterostructures granted to Shockley in 1951, Kroemer wrote a paper on the theory and advantages of wide-gap emitters for bipolar transistors [1]. Several experimental papers on wide-gap transistors appeared in the late 1960s and 1970s (see [284] for references). Early attempts did not produce greatly improved transistors mainly because of the limitations of technology. Advances made in the technology of epitaxial growth (liquid phase epitaxy, MBE, MOCVD) were largely responsible for the subsequent success in developing high-performance GaxAll_xAs HBTs and other III-V compound semiconductor heterostructure devices (several excellent reviews on the subject are contained in the book edited by Sze [270]). The two ideas, one of electrical heterostructure contained in Shockley's patent and the other of mechanical heterostructure proposed by Frank and Van der Merwe, can be combined to develop and fabricate GexSil_x heterojunction devices. E. Kasper and his collaborators in Germany [271, 272] combined the concepts of an electrical heterostructure and a strained mechanical heterostructure and produced device-quality GexSil_x/Si heterostructures. Bean et al. [297] investigated extensively the experimental conditions under which good Ge~Sil_~ layers can be grown on Si using MBE. They determined experimentally the critical thickness (discussed in chapter 2) of GezSil_~ epilayers on Si(100) for all values of Ge fraction x. Recently considerable work has been to improve our understanding of strain relaxation and dislocation generation [197]. This work is discussed in details in chapters 2 and 3. Considerable work on cubic (unstrained) SiGe alloys was done in 1950s and 1960s. Some of this early work Sil_xGe~ alloys is very important. Measurements of carrier mobilities in the alloys were made by several groups [1]. These measurements are important for determining the effect of alloy scattering on the mobility. Braunstein et al. [300] made extensive measurements of fundamental optical absorption in the alloys and concluded that the conduction band remains Si-like for x < 0.8 and changes abruptly to become Ge-like at about x = 0.85. Accurate measurements of the lattice constants of the Sil_~Ge~ alloys were made for all values of x [1]. A large part of the modern physics of strained layers is based on the results of these early measurements. People [302] and Van de Walle and Martin [341] calculated the bandgaps and band offsets of the Ge~Si~_~/Si(100) structures. Lang et al. [340] determined experimentally values of bandgaps of the strained layers that agreed with the theoretical results. People et al. [417, 418] were the first to observe a twodimensional hole gas (2DHG) in modulation-doped Ge0.2Si0.8/Si superlattices (SLSs). In these SLSs, Si layers were doped with boron and 2DHG was formed in the Ge0.2Si0.s layers. Jorke and Herzog [419] fabricated the first symmetrically strained Ge0.45Si0.55/Si SLSs grown on a relaxed Ge0.25Si0.75/Si buffer. On doping the middle portion of the Ge0.45Si0.55 layers with a narrow Sb spike, they observed the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the strained Si layers. More recently important advances have been made in the performance of\n\n1.3.

Vegard's law is a reasonable approximation for the SiGe alloys Sil_~Ge~ alloys [1, 197, 125]. Therefore the lattice constants of the unstrained alloys is given by, a(X)Sil_xGex (1 - x)asi + XaGe. (2.1) -\n\n-\n\nThe lattice constant a(x) of the cubic S i l _ , G e , alloy is also bigger than that of Si. The difference between the two lattice constants depends on Ge concentration x. If the epitaxial layer of the alloy is grown on a Si substrate, there is a lattice mismatch between the substrate and the layer. If the layer is sufficiently thin, the growth is coherent and the epilayer is pseudomorphic. The lattice mismatch is accommodated by tetragonal distortion of the epilayer. The epilayer is compressed in the lateral directions and is extended in the vertical direction as shown in Fig. 2.1(a). The lateral dimensions of the layers are large as compared to their thicknesses. The edge induced relaxation (discussed in section 2.4.2) of strain can be neglected for such layers. The strain is homogeneous and is known as the misfit-strain. If the thickness of the layer is large and/or if the lattice mismatch is large, strain energy becomes too large. In this case energy is gained by the introduction of misfit dislocations. Misfit dislocations cause relaxation of strain. A relaxed epilayer containing dislocations is shown in Fig. 2.1(b). The missing plane constituting the dislocation is shown in the 3D view in Fig. 2.1(c). This figure shows both the threading dislocation (TD) and the misfit dislocation (MD). The missing half-plane which gives rise to the MDs and TDs is also shown separately. The mechanism of generation of dislocations is illustrated in Fig. 2.2. Numerous plan-view and cross-section TEM photographs of MDs exist in literature. We show ~ plan view TEM picture of a 50 nm SissGe15 layer grown at 700~ [120].

The net work of MDs becomes intense after heat treatment.

Combining Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2), we obtain fm(X) - 0.042x, (2.3) for Sil_xGe~/Si layers. For a given value of fro(x), there is a critical thickness h~ up to which the layers remain pseudomorphic. If the layer thickness h exceeds h~ and the layers are in thermal equilibrium, the theory [254] predicts that dislocations will be introduced. Many SiGe devices (e.g. SiGe HBTs) have a thin single crystal Si layer on top of the strained Sil_xGe~ layer. The top Si layer, designated as the cap layer, increases the stability of the strained Six_~Ge~ layer. The onset of dislocations and relaxation of strain in the Sil_~Gex layer are delayed, they occur at larger layer thicknesses (and/or larger Ge concentrations) and at higher temperatures. The dislocation structure in the capped layers is shown schematically in Fig. 2.4. In addition to a layer with free surface, layers with a thin cap, with a very thick cap and with a cap of intermediate thickness are shown. In the layer with thin cap shown in Fig. 2.4(b), missing dislocation planes penetrate the cap and dislocation structure is similar to that of a layer with free surface shown in Fig. 2.4(a). In SiGe HBTs the thickness of the single crystal emitter (which works as a cap) is less than that of the strained SiGe base layer. Therefore the HBT structure corresponds to Fig. 2.4(b). If the cap is very thick as shown in Fig. 2.4(c), the dislocation dipoles are formed. With intermediate thickness of the cap shown in Fig. 2.4(d) both dipoles and singles are formed.\n\n2.2 2.2.1\n\nStrain and dislocation energies Strain\n\nenergy\n\nThe homogeneous strain energy consists of the energy due to misfit strain, the energy due to average strain of the dislocation arrays and the product of these two terms due to interaction between the two strains.

We now consider two perpendicular arrays of interacting dislocations with a periodic distribution. Their strain field consists of an average homogeneous part and a fluctuating part with average equal to 0.

The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (2.7) gives contribution from the uniform biaxial strain, bl/p, due to the two arrays. Total energy ET of a partially relaxed layer is the sum of the energy EH and\n\n2-E s [1971 p\n\nET = EH + 2--EDs. P For large p, EDS ,~ E ~ and ET can be written as [197] 2\n\nE~ - EH + - g ~ .

(2.10)) are plotted as a function of strain relaxation [bl/Pl for 7 different values of the epilayer thickness h [276]. Since elastic constants of III-V, Si and Ge are not very different, the values of energy shown in Fig. 2.5 are also valid for GeSi/Si, InGaAs/GaAs and other epilayers as long as f m = 0.0042. The calculated value of h~ is 236 A for this composition. Each curve shows a minimum, the minimum becoming stronger and moving to larger values of [bl/p[ as h increases. The position of the minimum tends to move to fm as h approaches c~. These results show that for each thickness, there is a definite concentration 1/p~ of dislocations per unit length needed for the epilayer to be stable (the corresponding strain relaxation is [bl/Ps [). These minima in energy give pairs of values of he and [bl/ps I for stable configurations. The values of Ibl/p~ [ at which minima occur for different values of h increase with h, first rapidly and then slowly. For any given thickness, the concentration ]bl/p~] of dislocations is smaller if interactions of dislocations are not properly taken into account and E ~ instead of EDS is used in the energy expressions. However the average concentration of dislocations decreases for a non-periodic distribution. The observed concentrations are always much smaller than the predicted values for a periodic distribution. The discrepancy arises partly due to the non-periodic distribution and partly due to the difficulty in nucleating the dislocations.\n\n15\n\n2.2.

If the layer under consideration has a thick cap-layer on the top, the above expressions for energies are modified. If the cap is sufficiently thick, dislocation dipoles instead of dislocations are formed. A dipole consists of a pair of dislocations, one each at the upper and lower interfaces. Fig. 2.4 shows a schematic representation of a 60 ~ array of dislocations in an uncapped layer and dipoles in a capped layer. Both dislocations of the dipole are of 60 ~ type and a is the same as for the uncapped layers. The dislocations at the lower interface have a Burgers vector b and at the upper interface, a Burgers vector -b. The dipole spacing p is the spacing both in the upper and the lower array of dislocations (see Fig. 2.6). The angle O is the angle between the line joining the two dislocations of a dipole and perpendicular to the interface.

If interactions between the dipoles or between dislocations are neglected, the energy of a dipole in the capped layer is approximately twice as large as the energy of a dislocation in an identical uncapped layer. 2.2.3\n\nNon-periodic\n\narrays of dislocations\n\nThe energy of an array of dislocations is lowest if the distribution is periodic. However dislocations generally nucleate at heterogeneous sources (defects, impurities, ledges etc.) and therefore they are clustered. We therefore consider the energy of the arrays with irregular distribution of dislocations. The energy of interaction Ei(h, p) (per unit length of the dislocation lines) of a pair of dislocations is given by [324],\n\nEi(h,p) = Abl 2 [ln(4(h/p) 2 + 1)+\n\n+Ab22 [ln(4(h/p) 2 + 1 ) -\n\n4(h/p) 2 (4(h/p) 2 + 3)] (4(h/p)2 + 1) 2\n\n4(h/p) 2 (12(h/p) 2 + 1)] (4(h/~)~ + 1) ~\n\n+Ab32 [ln(4(h/p) 2 + 1 ) ( 1 - v)].\n\n(2.14)\n\nLet the number of dislocations be N + 1 with pi as the inter-dislocation spacing between the i th and (i + 1) th dislocations.

Fig. 2.7 shows the numerical values of the energy of two orthogonal arrays of periodic and non-periodic interacting dislocations. We can see from this figure that interactions between dislocations farther than the next-near neighbours are important. It is not a good approximation to replace non-periodic arrays with average spacing ~ by periodic arrays with spacing p = ~. This is more clearly demonstrated by curves 3 and 4. The total energy of an epilayer containing non-periodic arrays is obtained by adding together all the contributions discussed above. The energy values calculated in this manner for an epilayer with fm = 0.0042 are plotted in Fig. 2.8. Curve 1 is for the periodic arrays. Curves 2 and 3 are for Gaussian distributions and curve 4 is for a uniform-random distribution. For a given misfit the number of dislocations is smaller if the distributions is irregular. The number is not sensitive to the details of distribution but it does depend on the standard deviation. The number decreases as the standard deviation a increases.\n\n2.3 2.3.1\n\nCritical t h i c k n e s s Layers with free surfaces\n\nTo calculate equilibrium critical thickness, the sum of the energies of dislocations and strain is minimized and the spacing between the dislocations is allowed to\n\n18\n\nCHAPTER 2.

According to the equilibrium theory [254] the critical thickness is given by, 52(1 - zJcos 2 fl) In pchc (2.17) hc = 8r fro(1 + u)bl 7\" Here b is the Burgers vector, ~ is the angle between the dislocation line and the Burgers vector and is equal to 60 ~ for 60 ~ dislocations, bl - b cos ~, q is the core cut-off parameter and is taken to be equal to b and pc is the core-energy parameter. The above expression for h~ is approximate in that it does not take into account properly the interactions between dislocations. A more rigorous calculation of hc has been made [1]. Correct values of h~ differ only slightly from the values given by Eq. (2.17). For Sil_xGex/Si system Eq. (2.17) reduces to [2551, 0.55 h~ = - - In (10he), (2.18) x where hc is measured in nm. The experimental values of the critical thickness of the SiGe/Si layers are compared with the MB values calculated using Eq. (2.17) in Fig. 2.9. Creation of dislocations requires nucleation and propagation energies (see Fig. 2.2) which are large. At the usual temperatures (~ 550~ at which the layers are grown sufficient energy is not available for the generation of dislocations. Therefore the layers are not in equilibrium. Many of the experimental techniques can not detect a small number of dislocations or a small value of strain relaxation. Experimental values of critical thickness are therefore much\n\n20\n\nCHAPTER 2. STRAIN, STABILITY, RELIABILITY AND GROWTH\n\nlarger than the theoretical values. This explains the large discrepancy between Bean's experimental data [297] and theoretical values shown in Fig. 2.9. If layers are grown at higher temperatures, experimental values of critical thickness are found to be smaller [299] than Bean's values shown in Fig. 2.9. 2.3.2\n\nCapped\n\nstrained\n\nlayers\n\nWe have made calculations of the critical thickness hc,cap for a very thick cap (Fig. 2.4(c)) [256]. The calculated equilibrium values of hc,c~p are shown by the solid curve in Fig. 2.9. The equilibrium critical thickness hc,cap is twice as large as that of an uncapped layer at low mismatch and more than four times as large for the layers containing 80% Ge. For higher Ge concentrations the core energy parameters become important and elasticity theory does not give reliable results. The analytical expressions involved in the calculation of hc,cap are complicated. The expressions are given in our original paper [256]. The case of intermediate cap thickness, Fig. 2.4(d), has been treated analytically by Gosling et al. [257]. It is shown in this paper [257] that dislocation interactions [276] are very important in determining whether single dislocations or dipoles are formed. If interactions are neglected, the dipoles are not formed unless the cap thickness is at least 2 orders of magnitude larger than the strained-layer thickness. This result does not agree with the experimental observations. Dipoles have been observed when cap-layer thickness is about twice as large as that of the strained layer [255]. Gosling et al. [257] showed that the discrepancy can be resolved if dislocation interactions are included in the theory. They made detailed calculations for fm = 0.0084. The calculations predicted that dipoles should be formed at cap thicknesses similar to those that were used in the experiments [255]. We now discuss the case of thin caps shown in Fig. 2.4(b). In the IBM design of the SiGe HBTs typical thickness of the base layer is ~ 45 to 95 nm and that of the single crystal emitter (which works as a cap) is about half of the base thickness [169, 199, 126]. The Ge profile is not uniform, it is graded. In the German DB design the base thickness is smaller, 20 to 40 nm. All these cases correspond to Fig. 2.4(b). The following equations [1, 252] can be used to calculate the critical thickness of these layers irrespective of whether the Ge profiles are graded or uniform. heft -- hstrainedlayer -~- hcap~\n\n(2.19)\n\nand Xeff ~ ~\n\n1 --/he~ x(z)dz, J0\n\n/m,eff(Xe.) -- 0.042Xeff,\n\n(2.20) (2.21)\n\nwhere x(z) is the Ge concentration at depth z measured from the free surface.

This is the theoretical equilibrium value. As discussed earlier the experimental value is larger. 2.3.3\n\nCritical\n\nthicknesses\n\nof superlattices\n\nA superlattice is a stack of several periods, each period consisting of two thin strained layers of different semiconductors. The layers are pseudomorphic and have a common in-plane lattice constant. In Ge-Si superlattices, each of the two layers consists of GexSia_~ alloy with two different values of the composition x. Let the lattice constants of the two layers (relaxed, without strain) of a period be al and a2 and the thicknesses, dl and d2. The thin layers of the superlattice acquire an in-plane (parallel to the interfaces) lattice constant equal to that of the substrate, designated as all. The strains in the two layers are given by all - al ~1 -- ~ ~ - . all\n\n(2.22)\n\n= all - as\n\n(2.23)\n\nall\n\nIn order for the lattice to be in thermodynamic equilibrium, its structure must satisfy two conditions. (1) Each layer of the superlattice must have a thickness less than its own critical thickness, given by hi,\n\nh2 < h c l ( g l ) ,\n\nhc2(~2).\n\n(2.24)\n\nThe critical thicknesses he1 and he2 of the layers are somewhat larger than that of a single layer with free surface because these layers are sandwiched between two other layers. (2) The total thickness of the superlattice as a whole (i.e., the sum of thicknesses of all the periods) must be less than the critical thickness h~SL , which is equal to the critical thickness of the alloy with the same average composition as that of the superlattice [299, 302]. The critical thickness h SL of the superlattice as a whole can now be calculated using Eq. (2.17) with the misfit parameter f m = fSmL defined by,\n\n_C,fmL\n\n__\n\na~ - a~. = 0.042xa~,\n\n(2.25)\n\naav\n\nwith xa. given by -Xav --\n\nX l d l + x2d~ . dl + d2\n\n(2.26)\n\nThe result of Eq. (2.25) implies that for the purpose of calculation of stability, the superlattice can be regarded as one single layer of GexSia_x alloy with a value xav equal to the average value given by Eq. (2.26).\n\n22\n\nC H A P T E R 2.

If we now use a substrate with a lattice constant aav, the in-plane lattice constant continues to be equal to aav and the condition of minimum energy is satisfied. The superlattice fabricated on a buffer layer whose lattice constant is equal to a~v is known as a symmetrically strained superlattice. The second critical layer thickness of such a superlattice becomes infinite (see [99] for a recent review of symmetrically strained superlattices). Symmetrically strained lattices can be grown to very large thicknesses without generation of strain-relieving defects, provided the thickness of each layer is less than its critical layer thickness.\n\n2.4 2.4.1\n\nStability of strained layers Large area layers\n\nStiffier et al. [252] studied extensively the stability of SiGe strained layers capped with thin Si layers grown by UHV/CVD. Different Ge profile shapes (box, triangle and trapezoid) were investigated. Samples with average Ge concentrations up to 20% were studied. Samples were examined for the presence of misfit dislocations after a 950~ anneal for 30 min. Values of effective layer thickness are plotted as a function of effective maximum strain in Fig. 2.10. These thicknesses are he,el or hmax up to which the layers will remain free of defects on thermal treatment. The MB critical thickness given by Eq. (2.18) is also shown in the figure. The effective maximum strain is the actual average strain only if the layers are pseudomorphic. The strain in the relaxed layers shown by the filled symbols is smaller. To avoid confusion the words \"maximum effective strain\" instead of the words \"effective strain\" are used. Stiffier et al. [252] found that the layers remained pseudomorphic if heft <_ 1.65hc. The relation h~,ef - hmax - 1.65h~ versus maximum effective strain is shown by the dashed curve. The layer is stable against the introduction of misfit dislocations if the effective thickness versus maximum effective strain point for the layer lies on the left of the dashed curve. More recently Schonenberg et al. [199] have investigated the stability of both laterally large and small SiGe strained layers. In this case also the layers were grown by UHV/CVD and were annealed at 950~ for 30 min. Their data points for large layers (blanket wafers) are shown by the three circles in Fig. 2.10. The values of maximum effective strain in the three cases are 0.136, 0.220, and 0.321%. The thickness of the SiGe layer is 95 nm and that of the Si cap layer is 25 nm which gives a value of 120 nm for the effective thickness in each case. According to Stiffier's criterion, the second sample with 0.220 strain should have remained stable but was relaxed (see however Ref. [150]).\n\n2.4.

Triangles are for the CVD layers studied by Ribot [160]. Filled symbols show the relaxed layers with dislocations and the open symbols show the pseudomorphic layers.\n\nGosling et al. [257] have derived analytical expressions for the energy of singles, dipoles and of the strained layers containing either singles or dipoles. Using their theory it is possible to determine the thickness of the cap beyond which the dipoles are formed. Our recent calculations [124] show that when kinetic effects are included in the theory, only singles should be formed in the SiGe layers with the cap thicknesses studied in Refs. [199, 252]. Caymax and Decoutere [126] and Regolini, Ribot and co-workers [160, 170] have studied the stability of CVD grown SiGe layers. Caymax and Decoutere [126] fabricated two samples. The first was a control sample of 100 nm thickness and had a uniform Ge concentration of 15%. The second was a sample used in IMEC technology [168]. This layer was 60 nm thick with a triangular Ge profile. The peak concentration of Ge in this layer was 15%. The layer was capped with a 20 nm Si layer. The layers were grown selectively in patterned regions with poly-buffered LOCOS isolation. The layers were annealed at 800~ for 2 h and then subjected to RTA at 1070~ for 10 s. The first layer relaxed with a large number of dislocations but the second layer remained free of all defects. The two square symbols in Fig. 2.10 show the data points for these two layers. The effective thickness and maximum effective strain in the three layers studied by Ribot et al. [160] are shown by triangles in this figure. The maximum effective strains in the three layers were 0.20%, 0.26% and 0.35%. After thermal treatment (900 to 1000 ~ for up to 30 min [170]) only one layer with 0.35% strain was found to contain dislocations.\n\n24\n\nC H A P T E R 2.

The two straight line plots in (a) correspond to two different crystallographic directions of dislocations [249]. Figure (b) shows that a source at F generates a dislocation which traverses the whole large sample including the small shaded area A. If the small area A is not a part of the large area sample (see figure c) the source at F is ineffective in generating the dislocation in A.\n\n2.4.2\n\nS m a l l area layers\n\nIf the layers are laterally small (or simply small), generation of dislocations is suppressed. Suppression of plastic flow and generation of misfit dislocations in small layers occurs on two accounts. Firstly, the effective density of (heterogeneous) nucleation centers, known as sources, decreases in the small layers [249, 251]. This effect becomes significant when the lateral dimensions become less than 400 #m. Secondly, edge induced stress (or strain) relaxation becomes significant if layers are sufficiently small [221, 222, 125, 248, 227]. This effect becomes significant when the lateral dimensions are of the same order as the thickness of the layer. We first discuss case 1 i.e. reduction of effective number of sources studied by Fitzgerald et al. [249] in small InGaAs layers. Similar studies have been made in SiGe layers by Nobel et al. [251]. However the work of Fitzgerald et al. [249] is more extensive and their conclusions can be used to interpret experiments on SiGe layers also. Fitzgerald et al. [249] fabricated circular and rectangular mesas on a GaAs substrate. The linear dimensions of the mesas were in the range 67 to 400 #m. Ga~Inl_xAs layers with 1 - x = 0.05, and three values of thicknesses, 3500, 7000 and 82500 A, were grown on the mesas by MBE. To keep the strain small and avoid homogeneous nucleation, small values of 1 - x were chosen. The cathodoluminescence (CL) method was used to determine the concentration of dislocations. The measured concentration of dislocations in a circular mesa is shown in Fig. 2.11(a) for one set of samples. It is seen from Fig. 2.11(a) that the concentration of dislocations decreases dramatically with the decrease in mesa size. The explanation of this decrease is given in Figs. 2.11(b) and 2.11(c). As shown in Fig. 2.11(b), if the small circular layer 'A' is a part of the large area epilayer, the dislocation generated by a source F passes through the small layer. When the small layer is separated from the large area layer (Fig. c), the small area layer is free from the dislocations. As suggested by Fitzgerald et al. [249], the effective density of dislocation sources\n\n25\n\n2.4.

[199] studied the stability of small area trench-isolated SiGe layers grown on Si substrate. Samples were prepared on 8-inch patterned Si wafers with deep and shallow trench isolation as shown in Fig. 2.12. The deep trench isolation was filled with low-pressure chemical vapour deposited (LPCVD) silicon oxide and LPCVD polysilicon. The shallow trench was filled with annealed silicon oxide. Structures of three sizes were investigated: a small structure (similar to the IBM HBT [169]) which had an active area of 1.5 pm • 3.5 #m, a large structure with an active area of 37 pm • 180 pm and a blanket wafer with a very large area. The thickness of the SiGe layer was 95 nm and that of the single crystal Si cap layer was 25 nm in each case. Three Ge concentrations were used with graded profiles. The peak Ge concentrations were 5.5%, 9% and 13% and the corresponding strains (designated as effective strain eefr) averaged over the whole thickness of 120 nm were 0.136, 0.220, and 0.321%. The average concentration of Ge in the SiGe layer calculated from the effective values of strain given above are 4.53%, 7.33% and 10.7% respectively. Some blanket wafers were etched to transparency and examined for dislocations in a JEOL 4000FX electron microscope. The results obtained with the blanket wafers have already been discussed in section 2.3.2. The remaining wafers were processed through the deep and shallow trench isolation process steps. One group of samples were stressed by growing additional 47 nm of thermal oxide and the second group was annealed to minimize the stress in the isolation before the growth of SiGe layers. In all stressed samples (both small and large) dislocations were seen in the epilayer after 950~ anneal even with 0% Ge. In contrast no dislocations were seen in the finite area devices (after the same heat treatment) fabricated on the relaxed isolation substrate. The thickness predicted by Stiffier's criterion for the 0.321% effective strain is 82.5 nm. It\n\n26\n\nC H A P T E R 2.

We can draw the following conclusions from the results of these experiments. 9 If the substrate is not stressed due to trench isolation (i.e. the stress is removed by a suitable anneal), small size increases the effective critical thickness by a factor ~ 1.5 for a lateral size of a few microns. 9 Substrate stress has a profound effect on the stability of the SiGe strained layers. Stresses cau~d by the side-wall oxidation of the deep trenches can reduce the critical thickness by an amount much larger than the enhancement by the small size effect. 9 Stability of the blanket wafers can not be extrapolated to the stability of the SiGe layer in an actual functional device. Even if the blanket layer is unstable during the 950~ anneal, it may remain stable in the device due to small size effect. On the other hand if the substrate is stressed due to isolation or for other reasons, the instability caused by the substrate stresses may dominate. In this case even if the layers are stable in the blanket wafers, defects may be generated during the processing steps. 2.4.4\n\nThermal\n\nstability\n\nof surfaces\n\nof Sil_~Gex layers\n\nSugii et al. [56] also measured strain relaxation and surface roughening during the heat treatment of a GeSi heterostructure. The cross section of the sample used by Sugii et al. [56] is shown in Fig. 2.13. The layers were deposited by low pressure CVD (LPCVD). Before growing the top 25 nm Si strained layer, the surface of the Si0.TGe0.3 was treated by chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) to remove surface roughness and was chemically etched.

Strain relaxation was determined by monitoring the Si-Si Raman frequency in strained Si as well as in relaxed Si0.TGe0.3 annealed at different temperatures. Typical Raman spectra of a sample annealed at 850~ is shown in Fig. 2.14. The peak in strained Si is at 512 cm -1 and in relaxed Si0.TGeo.3 it is at 500 cm -1. The frequencies did not change on annealing up to 900~ On annealing at higher temperatures the frequency in relaxed Si0.TGe0.3 showed a blue shift whereas the frequency in strained Si showed a downward trend. This is caused by the diffusion of Ge from the Si0.TGe0.3 layer into the strained Si layer. This was confirmed by SIMS measurements. The effect of heat treatment on the surface roughness was investigated by AFM. AFM images of the as-grown sample and samples annealed at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 2.15. The scan was along the (100} direction and the scanning area was 20 #m square. Fig. 2.15 shows crossing hatching along the (110} directions in all the samples. Root-mean-square (rms) roughness is about 0.65 nm in the as grown sample. It increases with the temperature of annealing and attains a maximum of about 1.1 nm at 1000~ and then starts decreasing. Slip lines are also observed as shown by arrows in Fig. 2.15. The increase in roughness was attributed to the formation of dislocation lines associated with the appearance of slip lines. At higher temperatures strain is reduced by the diffusion of Ge and the surface becomes more stable. Since strain in Si remains constant by heat treatment up to 950~ for one hour or less, the thermal budget for this kind of structure should not be more\n\n28\n\nCHAPTER 2.

The stresses in the substrate are also modified under the edges. These so called edge induced stresses (or edge-induced stress relaxation) are confined to narrow regions in the large layers. Most of the layer is free from these changes in stresses. Fig. 2.16(b) shows that the effect of edge induced stresses engulfs the whole volume of the stripe. The stress induced under the stripe in the substrate is also considerable. The stress in the stripe is highly non-uniform. A quantum wire is essentially a stripe with small area of cross-section. In LOCOS structures the stripe material is nitride deposited on a Si substrate. In strained layer devices and quantum wires the stripe material is InGaAs deposited on a GaAs substrate or GeSi stripe\n\n30\n\nCHAPTER 2.

Origin of x is not always at the edge of the stripe as shown in this figure. deposited on a Si substrate. Stress or stress relaxation is induced near the edges by three mechanisms shown in the lower two panels of Fig. 2.16. Fig. 2.16(c) shows the stripe/substrate (S-S) structure before the edge-induced relaxation of stress in the stripe pqrs takes place. In mechanism 1 shown in Fig. 2.16(d) the edges of the stripe move outwards. They also drag the substrate planes outwards, inducing stress in the substrate as shown. No vertical displacement takes place. Fig. 2.16(e) illustrates the second mechanism. In this mechanism the edges also move out but they do not drag the substrate planes. In this case the displacement in the top part of the edges is large but in the bottom part (in contact with the substrate) it is zero. In the third mechanism shown in Fig. 2.16(f) the horizontal planes become curved, making the stripe convex upwards. Actual edge-induced relaxation takes place by the superposition of the three mechanisms [192]. We have analyzed all existing analytical models of stress calculation and we have shown that analytical models are not capable of calculating stress distribution in S-S or other low dimensional structures [221, 223] taking all the three mechanisms into account. Though the stripes shown in the figure are under compression, similar arguments can be used for stripes under tension. In that case all edge-induced displacements and changes in stresses will change sign. Stresses in the S-S structures depend on the elastic constants, geometry and dimensions of the stripe and the substrate [192]. For small Ge content, the elastic constants of the stripe and substrate may be taken to be equal to a good approximation. Different geometries used for fabricating stripes, quantum wires and quantum dots are shown in Fig. 2.17. Following Jain et al. [192, 223], we use the notation (l,h) to denote a stripe of thickness h and width 21 as shown in Fig. 2.17(a) and Fig. 2.17(/~). A circular mesa (representing a quantum dot) of radius r and thickness h is shown in Fig. 2.17(7) and denoted by (r, h). The dimensions of the substrate are indicated by using a subscript 's'. In the structure designated as a structure (Fig. 2.17(c~)) an unstrained stripe is grown below the main strained stripe. The unstrained stripe works as a virtual\n\n2.5.

The stresses are determined uniquely by the ratio of horizontal and vertical dimensions, therefore no units are attached to the dimensions [192].\n\n2.5.2\n\nEffect of d i m e n s i o n s\n\nIf substrate dimensions are not much larger than the stripe dimensions, the stresses in the S-S structure depend on all the dimensions i.e. l, h, l~, and h,. In this case Finite Element (FE) calculations of stresses must be made individually for each sample. However if 4, h~ > > l, h, the stresses depend only on the ratio I/h [192]. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.18 where calculated stresses in two stripes and substrates are plotted. Dimensions of the two samples are different but the ratio 1/h is the same in the two cases. The stresses in the two samples are not exactly the same for the two samples. There is some discrepancy near the center of the stripe and in the exposed part of the substrate. More detailed calculations showed that for the (50.5) sample the substrate dimensions were not sufficiently larger than the stripe dimensions. By repeating the calculations with larger dimensions of the substrate the discrepancy disappeared. This result is of great practical importance. If stresses are plotted in terms of normalized coordinates 1/h they can be used for many samples with different values of 1 and h. We have given calculated values of stresses for 13 different values of l/h [192, 163]. The values of stresses for other values of I/h can be obtained by interpolation. Calculated stresses in c~ and ~ structures are compared in Fig. 2.19. Fig. 2.19(a) shows the stresses in the stripes in the c~ structures with different values\n\n32\n\nCHAPTER 2.

Stresses calculated using an analytical model, designated as JA model, are also shown for comparison in figures (b) and (c). of l/h and at different distances (shown on the curves) from the edge of the stripe. Values of l and h for each value of I/h used in Fig. 2.19(a) and Fig. 2.19(b) are given in Table 2.1.

It becomes negative i.e. compression changes to tension (if the stress is tensile, it changes to compression) for smaller values of 1/h. The range of I/h over which the normalized stress has opposite sign is much larger near the edges. Solid symbols show the results for samples with different values of 1 and h but the same value of I/h as the open symbols on which they lie. The agreement of the open and the solid symbols demonstrates that the stress distribution is a unique function of I/h for the a structures also. Near the edges the stresses in the a and fl structures are quite different. Fig. 2.19(c) shows that the variation of stress with x and with depth z in the substrate is quite considerable. Using the Finite Element (FE) method we have calculated the elastic strain relaxation in small circular layers of radius R and thickness h i.e. in 7 structures. The normalised stress a/ao at the center of the small layers of several different dimensions is shown in Fig. 2.20. (a0 is the stress in the absence of the edgeinduced relaxation i.e. at the center of a large layer.) The thickness of the substrate does not affect the results provided it is larger than 2R.

Fig. 2.20 shows that the stresses in the layer are reduced for small values of R/h. If R/h is more than 100, there is no reduction of the stress at the center. The reduction increases rapidly as the value of R/h decreases. At R/h equal to 10, the reduction is about 20%. The stress becomes practically 0 at a value of R/h between 2 and 3. It becomes negative at R/h - 1 i.e. it changes from compressive to tensile. The results at the center of small square layers are practically the same. The situation at the edges is different. The reduction in stresses is large (not shown in the figure), it is large even at R/h = 100. Finally we show the calculated stresses in a SiGe quantum wire, which has been investigated experimentally, in Fig. 2.21. Layer thicknesses of the quantum wire are given on the left side of the figure. The structure of the quantum wire is shown later in Fig. 5.31(a) which shows it is an a structure. This is one quantum wire from the array of wires fabricated by Dietrich et al. [209]. FE calculations showed that interaction between the wires was negligible because of the a structure and because the height of the virtuM substrate was quite large. There was no stress in the main substrate on which all the wires were grown. Note the very large tensile stress in region 11 in Si and very large compressive stress in regions 2 and 3 in SiGe. Measured optical properties of the quantum structures are discussed in chapter 5.\n\n2.6\n\nPoly-SiGe and poly-SiGeC films\n\nPolycrystalline Si has played an important role in Si IC technology. It is used as a gate material for MOS transistors, as emitters in bipolar transistors [311] and in thin film transistors (TFTs) for flat panel displays [122].

Solid vertical and horizontal lines show the outer contour and interfaces before relaxation. The displaced surfaces and interfaces after the relaxation are shown by the dashed lines. The displacements are shown multiplied by a factor 14 for clarity. The dashed line for the lower interface between the GeSi and Si layers is hidden behind the narrow region 11 of high stress and can not be seen.\n\nSiGe (or simply poly-SiGe) has some potential advantages over polycrystalline Si. Poly-SiGe films can be grown at lower temperatures, the work function of these films can be adjusted by varying Ge concentration, and dopant activation can be increased [55, 122]. TFTs with x = 0.16 have been demonstrated [55]. Polycrystalline films are generally grown by solid-phase crystallization of amorphous SiGe films [55, 122]. The grain size, grain orientations, defects, and surface roughness are important characteristics for applications of the films. Grain size and orientation have great influence on the threshold voltage and channel mobility of the TFTs. Rodr{guez et al. [55] have investigated in detail the solid-phase crystallization process and final structure of the polycrystalline Sil_xGex films. Raman spectroscopy, UV reflectance and x-ray diffraction techniques were used to characterize the films. Values of x in the range 0.20-0.38 were used. The crystallization temperature was in the range 525 to 600~ If the films contain low Ge content and/or if they are crystallised at low temperatures, the lateral grain size is much larger than the film thickness. The films are textured in (111) direction. The grains are elliptical and the inter-grain defect density is low. In this regime the nucleation mostly occurs at the top native oxide and SiGe interface. As the Ge concentration increases, nucleation in the bulk of the film also takes place and the size of the grain decreases. The (111) texture changes towards randomly oriented polycrystals. For the highest Ge concentration investigated, bulk nucleation dominates. The grain size decreases\n\n2. 7.

[54] made similar investigations of growth of polycrystalline SiGe films using ellipsometric spectroscopy. They also found that the crystalline fraction was large, greater than 0.8 if Ge fraction is less than 30%. For x > 0.8, the fraction of crystalline material decreased to 0.6. The fraction of crystalline material also decreased at higher growth temperatures.\n\n2.7 2.7.1\n\nGrowth of strain relaxed layers Compositionally\n\ngraded\n\nlayers\n\nStrained Sil_~Ge, alloy layers are grown using MBE, CVD and other methods. A comprehensive review of the growth methods is beyond the scope of this book. Some of these methods are also discussed in Ref. [125]. A list of references on the growth methods is given in Refs. [245, 1]. Recently several papers have appeared on the growth of the relaxed Sil_~Ge~ layers. These papers focus on the reduction of number of threading dislocations. These layers are used for the growth of Si layers under tensile strain to obtain high electron mobilities [67, 120, 77]. The work reported in these papers is discussed in this and the following subsections. High mobility of electrons and holes is required for designing and fabricating metal-oxide-semiconductor transistors (MOSTs). Both n-MOST and p MOST are needed in advanced complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices. Ge or high Ge content Sil_~Ge, layers on Si are needed for making optoelectronic devices [141]. For obtaining high mobility of electrons in the Si or SiGe layer, the layer must have in-plane tensile strain. This is accomplished by growing pseudomorphic Si or Sil_~Ge~ layers on relaxed Sil_yG% buffer layers. If y > x, Sil_~Ge~ layers grown on the buffer layers are under tensile strain. In view of the importance of the advanced CMOS technology, several groups have done considerable work to obtain Sil_yG% buffer layers with low threading density [67, 76]. Compositionally graded relaxed Sil_yG% layers have been employed as virtual substrates in many other semiconductor heterostructures. Some typical examples are InGaAs/GaAs light emitting diodes (LEDs), InGaP/GaP LEDs with a transparent GaP substrate, and high quality GaAs/Ge/SiGe/Si solar cells [76]. Graded relaxed Sil_yG% buffer layers still have some deficiencies. In these layers Ge concentration is zero or very small near the Si substrate. The concentration increases continuously and monotonically as the buffer layer grows. Misfit dislocations are produced to relax the compressive strain. If the length of the misfit dislocations is small, a large number of threading dislocations (TDs) is produced. The lengths of the misfit dislocations increase by the glide motion of the TDs. Therefore efforts are made to avoid impediments to the propagation of TDs and to keep the nucleation of fresh dislocations to a minimum. Existing dislocations can impede the motion of the TDs [322]. In the best graded layers\n\n36\n\nC H A P T E R 2. S T R A I N , S T A B I L I T Y , R E L I A B I L I T Y A N D G R O W T H\n\nthe concentration of the TDs is ,~ 105 cm -2. If thick relaxed layers are grown with uniform Ge concentration, the concentration of TDs is in the range l0 s_ 109 cm -2. The surface of the buffer layers is not atomically smooth due to the cross-hatch pattern related to the pile up of dislocations. A large concentration of TDs and surface roughness adversely affects the performance of the active device grown on the buffer. The other disadvantage is that the thickness of the graded buffers needed to relax the strain without excessive generation of TDs is very large. If there are no impediments to the glide of the TDs, the number of TDs does not depend on the final composition of the layer. The concentration depends on the growth temperature and grading rate [76, and references given therein]. However in practice the concentration of TDs depends on other factors. In addition to the existing dislocations, the combination of surface roughness and strain also traps the TDs. Trapping of dislocations results in the pileup of the TDs. Since TDs do not relieve strain, fresh misfit dislocations are nucleated. Lee et al. [57] fabricated high quality relaxed Sil_xGe~ layers with x = 0.7 in the top layer using UHV-CVD. First graded layers with x = 0 - 0.6 and grading rate 100/#m were grown on Si substrates. These layers had a crosshatch rough surface. Crosshatch roughness is associated with the relaxation of strain and pile of dislocations. The crosshatch roughness can be removed by chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP). CMP also reduces the defect density in the top layer and minimizes the generation of further nucleation of dislocations as the additional layers are deposited [57]. The growth is continued at 750~ to increase x to 0.7. A 60/k Ge layer is then deposited at a low temperature of 400~ This layer is used as the active hole channel in MOS FETs. The low temperature growth avoids ripples on the surface which reduce the hole mobility. Finally a thin Si cap is grown to serve as the interface between the Ge channel and SiO2. The mismatch between Si and Si0.3Ge0.7 buffer layer is ~,, 3%. Again a low growth temperature is used to avoid islanding. The mobility obtained in the Ge channel is high (see chapter 5). Recently Leitz et al. [76] have investigated the generation of TDs and relaxation of strain in Si0.rGe0.3 layers. Substrate offcut affects significantly the concentration of TDs. If epilayers are deposited on on-axis substrate, the TD density varies exponentially with temperature, from 3.7 x 106 cm -2 at 650~ to 9.3 x 104 cm -2 at 900~ If the substrate is an offcut substrate the TD concentration is higher at higher temperatures. The net generation of the dislocations is not purely glide limited and has an activation energy of 1.38 eV.\n\n2.7.2\n\nStrain relaxation by hydrogen implantation\n\nTrinlmus et al. [104] have studied the effect of hydrogen implantation on the strain relaxation in 250 nm thick Si0.ssGe0.15 layers grown on Si substrate. Strain relaxation occurred more efficiently and at lower temperatures. Strain relaxation was complete in 7 min at a temperature as low as 800~ More importantly the threading dislocation density was low, below the limit of detection by TEM. Trinlmus et al. [104] have discussed possible mechanisms which relax\n\n2. 7.
