Students of innovation exist in companies and organizations, as well as in classrooms—working to get it done, learning how to accomplish it. Innovation is a field in itself, and it deserves careful reflection and study. Without interested students, our effort to write this book would hardly have been worth it. To my husband, Patrick, and our three outstanding children, Dan, Christine, and Kenny. What beautiful innovations you are. —Gina C. O’Connor My thanks go to my wife, Jane, for her wisdom and insights, and to our two children, Gabriel and Jeff, who continually present us with new and innovative approaches to life. —Richard Leifer To my wife, Catherine, my partner and the love of my life, and to our children, Catherine Maria, Michael, and Andrea, successful innovators all. —Albert S. Paulson Thank you to my husband, Garrett, my son, Ricky, my stepdaughter, Jennifer, and to their families for their understanding, enthusiasm, and patience about my work. I dedicate this book to my mother who passed away on February 11, 2007, for her appreciation of novelty and innovation and for teaching me not to be afraid of doing things differently. When I was young, she showed me how to stand up for myself and gave me the will to drive for excellence. My mom encouraged and supported my endeavors even when I made some missteps. She even stayed up all night with me when I was in high school and needed to meet a deadline that I had neglected to plan for appropriately. —Lois S.

You’ll soon notice that we are innovation enthusiasts. Actually we’re students of innovation, professors of innovation, innovators ourselves. We’ve studied large firms and start-ups, financial services organizations and manufacturing companies, public companies and private familyrun companies. We’ve studied innovation in one form or another, as academics, for nearly two decades and worked with numerous companies beyond those we’ve studied to help them become more accomplished innovators. Together, as part of a larger team, we have studied breakthrough innovation in large established companies, the subject of this book, since 1995, when the Research Program on Radical (or Breakthrough) Innovation at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute’s Lally School of Management and Technology originated. It has progressed in two phases: phase I ran from 1995 to 2000 and phase II from 2001 to 2006. In this Preface, we describe a bit about the research program so you’ll understand how we’ve come to the conclusions that we present to you in this, our second book. Our major conclusion is that innovation, which over the years has been a fad that comes and goes, is finally coming into its own. Innovation, we believe, is an emerging function in companies, much like marketing, quality, and finance have become functions in organizations over the past forty to fifty years. Companies are recognizing the need to develop an innovation capability that is sustained over time rather than a program du jour. They ix\n\nfpref.indd ix\n\n1/3/08 2:15:48 PM\n\nx\n\nPREFACE\n\nare struggling with how to do this because they don’t know how. Nevertheless, they’re focusing on the experiment and are investing heavily. Our research program began in 1995 with a generous grant from the Sloan Foundation and the sponsorship of the Industrial Research Institute, a professional organization of R&D Managers, Directors and Chief Technology Officers of Fortune 1000 companies. The objective of phase I was to learn how breakthrough innovation (which we’ll refer to as BI) projects were managed in large, established companies. We believed that management processes that worked well for incremental innovation would kill off breakthroughs before they got out of the starting gate, so we studied twelve projects in ten large, established companies over the course of five years. These were projects that senior leadership in the companies identified as potential breakthroughs. Over the five years that we tracked them, some were killed off, as expected, and others met with varying degrees of success. Several changed the game in their industries. On the basis of that study, a team of us from the research program wrote Radical Innovation: How Mature Firms Can Outsmart Upstarts, in which we identified the challenges of managing under high levels of uncertainty on many dimensions (we highlighted four: technical uncertainty, market uncertainty, resource uncertainty, and organizational uncertainty).1 The vast majority of projects we studied originated and progressed solely because of the strong will and persistence of a talented champion with ties to and protection from a senior management sponsor. Project teams and their leaders spent a great deal of time fighting against the norms of their companies, whose management systems, processes, and metrics were dedicated to efficiency, responding to market needs, and operational excellence. These were not the norms and infrastructure needed for the high-uncertainty environment of BI. We concluded that companies could do a much better job at developing management systems and infrastructures that supported, rather than antagonized, innovation champions\n\nfpref.indd x\n\n1/3/08 2:15:49 PM\n\nPREFACE\n\nxi\n\nand their teams. We coined a term, radical innovation hub, that we used to describe such a system. A hub is a central locus for BI activities: establishing, generating, and developing projects; providing coaching about dealing with ambiguity and uncertainty; accessing resources; networking; and gaining help for projects preparing to make the transition into business units or other receiving units. Hub members would run interference between project teams and the mainstream organization and ensure that the connections with the mainstream organization occur as necessary so that the breakthrough is accepted into the company rather than rejected or ignored. The hub would develop the right kind of skills in people, oversee a portfolio of breakthrough projects, and set up appropriate governance mechanisms for each project and the portfolio. And it would play many other roles that we observed as gaps in companies’ abilities to develop breakthroughs today. We noted the beginnings of a hub in two of the companies we studied, but that was all. And both of those were snuffed out by the end of the study period. Interesting, and discouraging. As soon as the first book was published in 2000, we began phase II. We needed to know how companies that wanted a sustained BI capability were executing it. Was a hub the right approach? What alternatives were being tried? We went back to the IRI and proposed a second study, and the results of that study form the basis for this book. This book is about building an innovation capability that will last. It’s about developing an innovation function. Companies are doing it. They’re getting there. It’s early yet, but it is happening. For phase II we sought participation from companies that had a declared strategic intent to develop or evolve a sustainable BI capability. The majority of those that agreed to participate were just getting started. Twelve companies eventually were included in the study and participated for the complete observation period of three and a half years, from 2001 to 2004. We were amazed at the attention innovation capability development has gained since the late 1990s.\n\nfpref.indd xi\n\n1/3/08 2:15:49 PM\n\nxii\n\nPREFACE\n\nOur research team was a group of ten academics from three universities and several Ph.D. and M.B.A. students.2 The team members represented had a wide variety of backgrounds, with expertise in technology policy, risk management, organizational development, marketing, information systems management, entrepreneurship, and strategy. After an initial brief interview to understand their BI initiative—its history, mandate, and structure—we visited the company. We asked about all aspects of the management system for innovation. We met with the individual or board responsible for the BI capability development (we’ll call this person or team the hub leadership). We met with the individual or team to whom the hub leader reported. We also met with the hub leader’s staff and, in some cases, team leaders of projects that were part of the breakthrough project portfolio. Every six months for three years following our site visit, we held a follow-up interview with the hub leader and whomever else she or he considered important for us to speak with at the time. In all cases except one, we spoke with the company president or a senior vice president or a chief technology or chief strategy officer of the company. About six months after we began our interviews, we began receiving inquiries from other companies that had heard of the study and wanted to participate. We formed a validation group comprising these firms that met at RPI every six months for the duration of the study. Those meetings were structured to address topics that were emerging as important in our interviews. Each company in the validation group (there were nine companies in all) reported on its practices, and we’d pose hypotheses for debate in those meetings. They were extremely helpful in providing even broader and richer context to what we were seeing in our initial twelve companies. Table P.1 lists the companies that provided projects for us to study in phase I, the twelve initial companies that volunteered to participate in this second phase, and the\n\nfpref.indd xii\n\n1/3/08 2:15:50 PM\n\nPREFACE\n\nxiii\n\nTable P.1 Study Participants Phase I (1995–2000)\n\nPhase II Initial Sample (2001–2005)\n\nPhase II Validation Sample (2002–2005)\n\nAir Products\n\n3M\n\nBose\n\nAnalog Devices\n\nAir Products\n\nDow-Corning\n\nDuPont\n\nAlbany International\n\nGuidant\n\nGE\n\nCorning\n\nHewlett-Packard\n\nGM\n\nDuPont\n\nIntel\n\nIBM\n\nGE\n\nP&G\n\nNortel Networks\n\nIBM\n\nPPG\n\nPolaroid\n\nJohnson & Johnson (Consumer Products Co.)\n\nRohm & Haas\n\nTexas Instruments\n\nKodak\n\nXerox\n\nUnited Technologies (Otis Elevator Division)\n\nMead-Westvaco Sealed Air Corporation Shell Chemicals\n\nvalidation set of companies for phase II as well.

Our research team met regularly to debate what we were learning. We had meetings that were facilitated by our IRI subcommittee cochairs, we had meetings in restaurants, we had meetings in conference rooms—all accompanied by laptops, flip charts, and Excel spreadsheets. The meetings were challenging, exhausting, and fun. Some of our views emerged in those large meetings and others through quiet study and smaller discussions. We’ve vetted our findings with our IRI sponsors, with members of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the Product Development and Management Association (PDMA), and the Strategy Executives Group of the Conference Board.\n\nfpref.indd xiii\n\n1/3/08 2:15:50 PM\n\nxiv\n\nPREFACE\n\nMidway through our data collection period and again at the end, we held workshops in which we invited members from all participating companies to discuss and validate what we thought we were learning. These too were challenging sessions. We delivered our findings, and we were questioned. We continued to develop our thinking. We watched their discussions among themselves, and we continued to learn. Even today we feel free to call on them for clarification of issues we’re struggling with as we continue to read for clues in those interview transcripts. They are a wonderful set of participants, they’re all interested in furthering their own learning and that of the collective and larger innovation community, and we are honored to have had the opportunity to work with them.

Peters\n\n1/3/08 2:15:50 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\nLeaders of established firms have worried about rejuvenation and new business creation for a long time. The more firmly established a company becomes, the more concerned with growth and renewal its leaders are. It’s easy to depend on the same product lines, the same customer segments, the familiar business models because they’re well understood. But the rest of the world does not stand still. Technology and competition march on, and companies that are not ahead of the pack by a long shot in developing new paths to growth by creating new markets and breakthrough innovations face commoditization, marginalization, and relentless competition for smaller and smaller market share. Companies need to develop a capability for breakthrough innovation. It raises the chance of long-term success. Besides, innovation can be fun. Really fun. And sometimes painful, but still fun. We find that many people just can’t help themselves. They are driven to participate in innovation-related activities despite the associated risks. Innovation brings meaning to their work lives. They want to be involved in nurturing new businesses and bringing leaps of value to the market. They’re proud of their companies and want to believe their companies are capable of offering much more. We know of stories of breakthrough innovation (BI): Corning’s development of optical fiber, Motorola’s pager device, GE’s CT scanner. But these occur infrequently, irregularly, and unpredictably. Companies need to develop a capability for BI so that it\n\nxv\n\nflast.indd xv\n\n1/3/08 2:16:17 PM\n\nxvi\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\noccurs over and over again rather than by happenstance. Some of them already have this capability. Innovation is emerging as an organizational function just like marketing has become established as a function in companies today. Forty years ago, few companies had marketing departments. None had chief marketing officers. Today many do because company leaders came to realize that marketing-related activities (selling, public relations, competitive intelligence, branding, market research) needed to be ongoing and ever present. Marketing could not be a program du jour or a special budget request. It needed to be embedded in the ongoing activities of the organization. The same thing has occurred with quality assurance, operations, and information systems. So it will be for innovation. BI isn’t a once-in-awhile sort of thing. Although large, mature companies have experienced it in this way, more can be done. Certainly innovation is vulnerable to the ups and downs of the business cycle, the industry cycle, and even the company’s own cycles, but it should not be extinguished. It needs to be continually present, just as marketing is continually present, even though the marketing budget may be squeezed or amplified given the company’s condition at any point in time. We need to develop the innovation function in companies, and by this, we mean BI. Companies have experimented with different approaches to developing a BI capability over the past forty to fifty years. None of these approaches, however, has addressed innovation as an ongoing business function that requires career paths, appropriate metrics, a clear mandate, and all the other elements that a sustainable function requires.\n\nHistorical Approaches to Innovation in Established Companies In 1985, Gifford Pinchot published Intrapreneuring: Why You Don’t Have to Leave the Corporation to Become an Entrepreneur, in which he prescribed that corporate entrepreneurs learn to seek out senior\n\nflast.indd xvi\n\n1/3/08 2:16:18 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nxvii\n\nsponsors for protection, break rules as needed, and get the new business created within the firm in spite of the resistance they’d face.1 Intrapreneuring became a mantra to those in companies with new-business-creation ambitions. But Pinchot’s model is one of exception rather than one of organizational capability. It depends on champions, on exceptional individuals. And we know that there are many breakthrough ideas that lie fallow because the idea generator and the opportunity recognizer aren’t always endowed with champion-like or maverick-like personalities.2 A skunk-works approach is another model companies have tried. This approach originated in the Lockheed Corporation during World War II and was used successfully to develop a high surveillance airplane that was used in the 1950s.3 Skunk works are relatively small work groups, physically separated from mainstream operations so as not to be subjected to the burdensome rules, overhead, or bureaucratic pressures of the corporation. They’re supposed to be sequestered to let the creative juices flow. IBM’s PC junior was developed in this manner, as were DuPont’s development of Lycra and Raychem’s development of the microwave oven. Japanese companies such as Cannon and Honda have also used this approach effectively. In all of these cases, the skunkworks approach was designed to develop a particular product and was not used as a systematic process for developing a pipeline of innovations. The famed Xerox PARC, designed as an ongoing skunk-works group to develop such a portfolio, failed as a source of growth and renewal for its mother company. PARC’s businesses were adopted and commercialized by others but rejected by its own sponsoring company, Xerox. PARC was criticized for being too isolated from the company. Another model companies have tried has been a corporate venturing unit, which emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s, inspired by the successes of venture capitalists themselves, who had backed start-ups such as Digital Equipment Corporation and Raychem.4 These were venture funds that companies established to invest in start-up organizations they perceived to have potential for high growth, expecting to capitalize financially, just as\n\nflast.indd xvii\n\n1/3/08 2:16:18 PM\n\nxviii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nstand-alone venture capital funds do, but also to strategically help the development of new technologies and markets from whom the firm would benefit. More than 25 percent of Fortune 500 firms had corporate venture investment programs during those years. When the capital markets declined in the late 1970s, corporate venture capital funds suffered the same fate as stand-alone venture capital funding. In the early 1980s, venture capital money rebounded, and corporations reinitiated corporate venturing activities, accounting for 12 percent of venture capital investing by 1986, only to be severely diminished once again after the 1987 market downturn.5 Almost 40 percent of corporate venture programs were abandoned within four years of their initiation, and by 1992, corporate venture capital investments accounted for only 5 percent of total venture capital investing.6 A third wave of corporate venture capital activity occurred in the late 1990s, again following the boom of venture capital activity that was fueled by Internet and other technologically based opportunities. Between 1995 and 1999, the number of U.S. companies that made corporate venture investments, looking for new revenue sources through the commercialization of new technologies, increased from 62 to 415, with investment dollars exploding from $542 million in 1996 to $16.5 billion in 2000.7 The business venture groups at Lucent Technologies, Cisco, and Nortel Networks were followed by many students of the corporate venture capital model, as they had healthy portfolios. These efforts, however, still suffered from lack of persistent experience and expertise in the managerial strategies necessary for operating in the regimes of high uncertainty that BI demands. In addition, although the portfolios were healthy from a financial standpoint in many cases, they failed to contribute to the overall strategic growth and renewal of the firm.8 Many of the portfolio companies never contributed to any new business growth of the mainstream sponsoring organization. At the same time that companies were placing investments in external small companies or internal ones that they spun out, a wave of internal corporate venturing experiments was taking\n\nflast.indd xviii\n\n1/3/08 2:16:18 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nxix\n\nplace. During the late 1970s and 1980s, new ventures divisions were forming to incubate, inside the organization, projects that didn’t fit the current business models or organizational structures of the firm. Most, however, were eventually disbanded, since the businesses were not achieving large-scale growth quickly enough, and managerial patience wore thin.9 So companies have tried many approaches in recent history, but none of these models has resulted in a sustained successful BI capability. Why? Because they’re dependent on individual champions, because they’re not part of the company’s strategy or strategic intent, or because they were singularly focused on one project (IBM’s move into the PC business, for example). IBM didn’t know, as a company, how to enact new business creation any better following that successful experience than it did before. There was little learning and little impact on the functioning of the organization largely because it operated in isolation from the rest of the company. How was the learning captured and put into repeated practice? Treating BI as a temporary program, an appendage to the mainstream organization, or a one-off project that the company invests in on an ad hoc basis is risky. It makes innovation vulnerable to the whims or fancy of whoever is in charge, the current financial picture of the firm, or the condition of the capital markets outside the firm. It’s either on or off, go or no go. Nortel Networks, for example, established a business ventures group in late 1996 whose purpose was to capture the creative ideas of those in the company with entrepreneurial talent and drive and develop those opportunities into businesses that would either be spun in to the company or spun out as stand-alone ventures. Joanne Hyland, vice president of the group, worked hard to find and develop a team of people who could coach the fledgling startups, help with market and economic analyses, and help negotiate external financing deals. She developed processes for finding and vetting the opportunities to develop a portfolio, set up oversight boards for each of her portfolio businesses, assembled a governance\n\nflast.indd xix\n\n1/3/08 2:16:19 PM\n\nxx\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nteam to help manage the portfolio itself, and developed processes that helped the entrepreneurs manage their way through the natural chaos of BI. Over the course of the next three years, the small group began to experience success. Of course, not all of the ventures succeeded; such is the nature of innovation on the edge. But a number of the ventures were successfully spun out of Nortel, and others were moved into the business units. Then the CEO retired and was replaced by a person who preferred acquisitions to internal organic growth. Within a year, the business ventures group was shut down, and all of the learning that had been built up in Hyland’s organization was lost. The management system she built was disbanded. All of those in the group left, and with them, out walked the organizational memory for how to create new businesses. If Nortel wanted to grow organically today, it could not draw on the experiences of the business ventures group because no one from that group is there anymore. Similarly, 3M’s chief technology officer in 2001, Paul Guehler, wanted to resurrect 3M’s new ventures group, which had been completely defunded fifteen years ago. The organizational memory, the practices, the people, the pipeline of projects were gone. He’d have to start from scratch. So over the past thirty or forty years, companies have invested time, people, and money into building new business creation entities, structures and processes, only to shut them down. What a waste. We not only need to find ways to maintain a constancy of the innovation function itself, but also to learn how to power it up and down as needed.\n\nMisunderstandings About Breakthrough Innovation In our discussions and interactions with companies, we have found a number of misunderstandings or gaps in understanding of BI, which lead to confusion about how to manage it.\n\nflast.indd xx\n\n1/3/08 2:16:19 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nxxi\n\nLack of an Innovation Strategy Most companies have clear strategies for operational excellence and even new product development, but very few have explicit strategies related to BI. It’s as if they believe breakthroughs will happen serendipitously or, even better, as the result of leadership’s declaration that they’re needed . . . now! This is probably exemplified by the initial resistance to and difficulty that established companies had in making total quality management a formal company strategy. Indeed, it took heroic efforts by W. Edwards Deming, Joseph Juran, and Philip Crosby, among others, to hammer away at U.S. companies regarding the importance of recognizing customer requirements for high-quality products. If it weren’t for the Japanese automobiles taking substantial market share away from Ford, Chrysler, and GM and almost putting those companies out of business, this new approach to doing business probably would not have been implemented. Indeed, it still took ten years, until the early 1990s, for the U.S. automobile makers to finally understand this concept. Will it take that level of urgency, a lifethreatening series of events, for companies to recognize the importance of developing an innovation capability? Our contention is that BI will not happen as an organizational capability unless it becomes part of the strategic portfolio of the company on a par with operational excellence and new product development. This means senior management must consider BI a corporate priority, be visible and audible with respect to supporting it, and provide corporate resources to get it done. As Nick Donofrio, IBM’s executive for innovation and technology (he used to be called simply IBM’s chief technology officer), said, “In the 21st century, innovation is my job. It is the most important thing I do for my organization. What I need to do is to take my organization away from where it is now and move it to a place of higher value.”10 Making BI a strategic priority protects it from becoming a flavor-of-the-month program without long-term survivability.\n\nflast.indd xxi\n\n1/3/08 2:16:19 PM\n\nxxii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe natural corporate antibodies of resistance to new ideas and programs will overwhelm nascent BI activities unless they are protected and given organizational validity, support, and attention. Lack of Distinction Between Invention and Innovation An invention is a new object, process, or technique. Firms that invest heavily in R&D reap the benefits of invention: many patents and many published papers. But that’s where it ends unless they also know how to innovate. Innovation is the introduction of something new to the marketplace. All of the rest of the work to develop an invention into a marketable offering and a business platform comprises innovation. Inventions are the inputs to innovation. Inventions, on their own, need not ever come to market. There’s much work involved in innovation beyond the initial discovery. We call that work incubation and acceleration, and we’ll introduce you to those, along with discovery, as the three major building blocks of a BI capability. For many companies, placing a strategic emphasis on BI will result in simply directing increasing amounts of resources toward it. After all, companies reason, if it’s important, they should invest in it. We would therefore expect that increasing investments in R&D would lead to increasing amounts of innovation, which should then lead to increasing organizational success. This line of reasoning led us to investigate these assertions carefully. We examined ten years of data relating R&D expenditures as a percentage of sales to sales growth, profitability, total stockholder returns, and degree of innovativeness in twenty-two industries for about twelve companies in each industry. For innovativeness, we used a portion of the Fortune magazine annual Most Admired Companies survey that asked industry peers (executives, managers, consultants in an industry) to rate companies in their industry. Each industry ranking is the result of the opinions of roughly five hundred people in that industry.\n\nflast.indd xxii\n\n1/3/08 2:16:20 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nxxiii\n\nWhat we found was quite surprising. First, we found no relationship between R&D expenditures as a percentage of sales and innovativeness. This means that simply investing in R&D more won’t lead to more innovation. Second, we found that R&D expenditures as a percentage of sales was consistently unrelated to sales growth and margins or stockholder returns, and in some cases, it was even negatively related to stockholder returns. This means that R&D investments don’t, in and of themselves, lead to better company performance. Third, we found that innovativeness was not related to profitability, but innovativeness was related to sales growth and stockholder returns. However, for firms in the sample that were rated as highly innovative, these relationships did not occur until after the third year. This means that it takes at least three years for innovation activity to have a financial impact on the company. These findings underline the importance of innovation to long-term company success. More important, they demonstrate the importance of investing in incubation and acceleration infrastructures and management systems rather than investing more in R&D. Although investment in R&D is obviously necessary, more than the industry average will not yield a return on that investment unless there is a concomitant investment in the rest of the innovation management system.11 Inappropriate Expectations for Breakthrough Innovation Even when senior management recognizes the importance of BI, there is often a lack of understanding of the investment required in terms of time horizons, complexity of creating new markets and new businesses, and the nature of the returns. The shortterm results are palpable, but they’re not measured in financial or stock return results. Immediate results include an energized workforce, renewed optimism, imaginative problem solving, new networks, and new opportunities. After a few early successes, there’s\n\nflast.indd xxiii\n\n1/3/08 2:16:20 PM\n\nxxiv\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\na buildup of confidence, a ‘can-do’ mentality. But it takes a long time for a portfolio of highly uncertain opportunities to be nurtured along and yield commercial and financial success. Typically management measures success in that way, and so traditionally, breakthrough innovation programs don’t last. That’s why we need to develop an innovation function that has appropriate metrics and evaluation criteria.\n\nManaging Breakthrough Innovation Applying what we already know about managing ongoing operations to managing business innovation would be a big mistake, but it’s done all the time because it’s what we know how to do. But managing BI is fundamentally different from managing other organizational activities, even new product development. Table I.1 highlights these differences. Our objective in writing this book is to help you address the problems of implementing an organizational innovation capability. It’s based on what others have done so that you can build on their experiences. We are not advocating that you change your ongoing operations. We are advocating that you add a new capability . . . : a BI capability. As Table I.1 shows, it’s quite distinct from what the mainstream organization does, and so the innovation function requires a management system that works for it rather than against it. It’s time that innovation was not an exception but rather a part of every company. Throughout this book, we point out the difficulties and challenges companies we’ve studied have faced as they are developing this BI capability. We also point to their successes, and there are many. No one has it all down yet. We share these stories so you can learn from the experiences of others and move more quickly to getting innovation institutionalized in your organization. We lay out a plan and strategy for developing this function given where you are now and your strategic intent. Not every business will compete on the basis of BI, but every company should\n\nflast.indd xxiv\n\n1/3/08 2:16:20 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nxxv\n\nTable I.1 Differences Between Managing Ongoing Operations and Breakthrough Innovation Management Issue\n\nflast.indd xxv\n\nOngoing Operations\n\nInnovation Function\n\nInnovation objective\n\nNew products to extend existing businesses\n\nBreakthrough innovation based on advanced technologies and business models yielding platforms to create new businesses\n\nTime orientation\n\nPresent and near future (one to two years)\n\nFar future (three or more years)\n\nStrategic objectives\n\nEfficiently and effectively satisfy and even delight current customers; plan for next generations\n\nCreate new markets based on new-to-the-world performance features or order-of-magnitude improvement in known features or cost; develop strategic intent for domain focus and allow opportunism\n\nCulture\n\nOperational excellence: customer intimacy and execution skills\n\nCultivation; employee intimacy and new business creation skills\n\nRisk profile\n\nRisk averse with a focus on system efficiency\n\nRisk mitigation through staged learning\n\nOpportunity selection\n\nCustomer driven, based on voice of the customer market research\n\nVision and possibilities tied to strategic intent\n\nInvestment timing and revenue focus\n\nNew products in six to eighteen months; profit-and-loss management with inyear revenue streams\n\nNew businesses in three to five or more years; return on investment over long term with portfolio management to hedge bets\n\nProject management processes\n\nPhase gate and concurrent engineering\n\nDiscovery-driven processes and learning plans\n\n1/3/08 2:16:20 PM\n\nxxvi\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nhave such a capability in place. The focus of the book is to understand the organizational system that’s needed to sustain innovation in your firm. We do this in parts. The first seven chapters describe the innovation system. Chapter One describes what a management system is and details how and why the management system for innovation must differ from one that supports a culture of operational excellence, the dominant culture in most established companies. Then we introduce the building blocks that comprise an innovation function. We refer to this as the DNA genetic structure of BI (Discovery, iNcubation, and Acceleration—note that we’ve cheated a bit on the “N”) and make the case for entrenching the innovation function right into the company rather than as an appendage. Chapter Two introduces the idea of an organization’s capacity for innovation. Why can some companies do this more easily than others, and why can some companies be more open to developing BI capability now rather than several years ago or several years hence? When capacity is rich, what do you do? When it’s strained, what do you do? Chapter Three is all about the discovery competency. Discovery is not the same thing as R&D. What activities are involved? What are the implications for R&D? How do the innovation management system elements play out in the discovery system? What challenges are firms facing in discovery, and what are some keys to doing it well? Chapter Four examines the incubation competency, the most difficult and overlooked of the three BI building blocks. If companies can learn how to master incubation, they greatly expand their options for new business creation. Chapter Five focuses on the third building block, acceleration. Acceleration was a surprise to us in the research program. Building critical mass in a new business must be handled carefully, and this chapter addresses the activities involved, approaches companies are taking to acceleration, and pitfalls associated with not attending to it properly.\n\nflast.indd xxvi\n\n1/3/08 2:16:21 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nxxvii\n\nThe discovery-incubation-acceleration system is the subject of Chapter Six. We find that few companies have a balanced effort across D, N, and A. What are the implications of this? What are the DNA system-level activities that have to be handled? What are some of the organizational structures that firms have developed to ensure that they are all happening? Finally, what are appropriate metrics for a DNA system? Chapter Seven is about orchestration. Let’s suppose that you’ve built an elaborate DNA system and it’s producing breakthrough businesses, but the mainstream organization cannot absorb your innovations. What has gone wrong? Who is the orchestrator, and what are some organizations’ approaches to orchestration? How do you orchestrate in munificent times? In lean times? What are some keys to effective orchestration? In Chapter Eight, we address how to get started developing a BI capability. What can you expect to face as you initiate this in your company? If you’ve already been at it awhile, what challenges have we seen companies encounter that you might avoid? It turns out there are some fairly predictable challenges that you may face, and we discuss options for how to handle them. Finally, Chapter Nine describes our thoughts on how to make innovation a sustainable activity. What does a mature BI capability look like? What does it need in companies in order to flourish? At the end of most of the chapters is a set of questions to help assess your company’s BI competency. Go through and score each question twice: first for how competent you perceive your company is now, and then give a score that you wish represented your company. List your average scores for the set of questions in each chapter in Appendix B at the back of the book and then plot them on the graph in the appendix to see your company’s BI profile. It’s time to recognize innovation as an organizational function and get started developing it in your company.\n\nflast.indd xxvii\n\n1/3/08 2:16:21 PM\n\nflast.indd xxviii\n\n1/3/08 2:16:21 PM\n\nGrabbing Lightning\n\nflast.indd xxix\n\n1/3/08 2:16:21 PM\n\nflast.indd xxx\n\n1/3/08 2:16:21 PM\n\n1 MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR INNOVATION\n\nCompanies are clamoring for innovation—breakthrough innovation. Every executive we’ve spoken with in the past ten years wants it. The trouble is they don’t know how to make it happen. “We’ve atrophied,” a senior technical leader at GE’s global research center told us four years ago. “We’ve been so focused on responding to our business units’ immediate needs and on taking cost out of our products that we’ve forgotten how to turn advanced technologies into breakthrough products and businesses.”\n\nStruggling to Market There are many reasons that companies struggle with getting breakthroughs to market. A few examples from project teams that we studied in the first phase of our research in the late 1990s illustrate some of the problems companies encounter all too often. Ultimately all of these companies developed a complete breakthrough innovation capability so they could overcome the sorts of challenges presented here.\n\nAir Products, Then and Now The management of Air Products, a large industrial gasses and performance materials company, knew they had to get growth through new initiatives. In the early 1980s, they realized they’d missed a major technological shift in air separation processes—methods to distill air into purer levels of its component parts, such as oxygen, 1\n\nc01.indd 1\n\n1/3/08 2:05:43 PM\n\n2\n\nGRABBING LIGHTNING\n\nnitrogen, hydrogen, and other gasses—and had been left behind. They hired a number of scientists with different backgrounds to help diversify their technological prowess in the mid-1980s. Part of that group was a small band of material scientists with expertise in ceramics materials, which Air Products’ technical community believed could potentially offer new-to-the-world features in gas and air separation processes that the company was famous for. But the investment yielded little, and the group was disbanded in the early 1990s. Several of these scientists, however, had come up with an idea for gas separation that was technically challenging but looked as if it could be a breakthrough in making high-purity, high-flux oxygen. The process would disrupt the oxygen distribution business because the oxygen would be made on site and would not need to be transported in the cylinders that are used today. These scientists labored diligently and developed Gantt charts, used stage-gate processes, and developed economic models. They began to realize that some of those project management processes could not work, since most of the markets they needed to contact were not ones in which the company currently participated, so they added a market analyst who came over from the field sales force. But then many market opportunities that they had initially explored had dried up. Still they labored on, now partnering with another development firm and securing government funding. Then the team’s leadership was changed. They were questioned by the corporate executive board regarding their slow progress, but since much of their funding was external, they were not a heavy drag on the firm and so have been allowed to continue. Thirteen years later, they have working prototypes and some first customers. Today Air Products has a functioning commercial development office (CDO) with staff who help develop such opportunities. They’re connected to the company’s newly formed growth board, so that the opportunities are aligned with company strategy for the future; in fact, they influence that strategic growth plan. They reach into various parts of the organization for the\n\nc01.indd 2\n\n1/3/08 2:05:44 PM\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR INNOVATION\n\n3\n\nhelp they need, be it R & D support, market connections, or manufacturing. The oxygen generation project continues, but in the meantime, the CDO has vetted and nurtured numerous other business opportunities. With the help of a staff who understands how to probe into new markets, recognize opportunities for the technological prowess the company has, and leverage networks inside and out of the company, a portfolio of breakthroughs, rather than just one, is on the horizon. Air Products is developing a breakthrough innovation capability. IBM, Then and Now In the early 1990s, Bernie Meyerson, an IBM research fellow, happened on a discovery, an alloy of silicon and germanium, that he believed could become the basis for high-performance new transistors with switching speeds up to four times faster than those of traditional semiconductors, with applications in the exploding wireless communications market.1 An important benefit was their ability to operate using only a fraction of normal power requirements for competing technologies. IBM’s ability to mass-produce silicon germanium would make it possible for hardware manufacturers to substitute chips made from this material for more costly, power-hungry, and exotic alternatives, such as gallium arsenide. Silicon germanium semiconductor technology offered a breakthrough price-to-performance ratio not available from these existing component technologies. Best of all, the new chip material could be manufactured with the same costly fabricating equipment used to make conventional silicon chips, potentially avoiding billions in new capital investments. The problem was that IBM was not interested. The company had made its money selling mainframes, not chips. And although it made chips, those were used only for internal customers; they were never sold to external original equipment manufacturers. But Meyerson could see the market coming, and he knew IBM had to be there. For most of the months and years that they worked\n\nc01.indd 3\n\n1/3/08 2:05:45 PM\n\n4\n\nGRABBING LIGHTNING\n\non the development of silicon germanium chips, he and his ad hoc team of collaborators had operated as a band of mavericks—tolerated but not officially sanctioned by the IBM R&D establishment. They made progress using bootlegged time and resources when the technology was outside IBM’s strategic framework. Meyerson’s relationship with Paul Horn, the senior vice president of R&D, was one of mutual trust and respect. Horn allowed Meyerson to continue with his work, though without his official approval. The silicon germanium project was broadly viewed as an irritating virus within the R&D host, which used the usual organizational antibodies to neutralize it: withholding funding, general naysaying, and subtle signals that it might not be “career smart” to associate with the project. Meyerson was immune to the implication of these signals due to his status as an IBM fellow. His project continued. Meyerson went to great lengths in preparing his presentations, showing his experimental data and contrasting them to performance data for pure silicon and for the leading contender for higher-performing, next-generation chips: gallium arsenide. Although the project was essentially a low-priority project among senior leaders within his own company at the time, Meyerson presented his data at a number of professional conferences and published articles in scholarly journals. Conference attendees representing Northern Telecom, Analog Devices, Hughes Electronics, and other leading companies recognized the potential of silicon germanium research and approached him to express their enthusiasm. These fellow scientists could see important applications of silicon germanium technology in their businesses, particularly in telecommunications. These potential uses were a revelation to the IBM researcher and helped him to fill in the details of what had initially been a fuzzy vision. When CEO Lou Gerstner dramatically shifted corporate strategy to include the sale of chips to external customers, Meyerson’s project quickly gained legitimacy. Now it was legitimized, but he envisioned a different sort of business model than IBM was used to. The company had a long history as a volume producer of memory\n\nc01.indd 4\n\n1/3/08 2:05:45 PM\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR INNOVATION\n\n5\n\nchips, an arrangement in which other firms provided the highervalue application design functions. Meyerson was aware of that history and knew that acceptance and funding of his project would probably lead to a similar outcome: IBM would get the high-volume chip-fabricating part of the value chain, while someone else would handle the smaller but higher-profit business of design. Meyerson believed that IBM should go after more of the value chain associated with the silicon germanium chip and expand IBM’s chipmaking activities beyond its traditional foundry operations. He and the project’s first business manager pushed for broader involvement in the value chain and resolved to work only with companies that were willing to let IBM in on the chip design issues relevant to the application. Meyerson hoped to learn these skills and eventually co-opt that part of the business for his company. He wanted IBM to use the development of the new chips as an opportunity to expand its design capabilities. In the end, his goal was partially accomplished when IBM’s CommQuest subsidiary was slated to design silicon germanium–enhanced chip sets for next-generation cellular phones. Other efforts were ongoing, like hiring a workforce trained in the specialty design coding work that was needed. The silicon germanium chip was announced in October 1998 and eventually became an industry standard, but it had to be rescued many times. Its success can be attributed to Myerson’s technical brilliance, rebellious personality, and tight connection to the senior vice president of research, Paul Horn. Meyerson is a one-man show. He refused to give up on his idea even though it contradicted the accepted technical wisdom, fell outside the strategic boundaries of the firm at the time, and met with substantial organizational resistance. His battles to get his idea heard ended up with—in his words—“lots of blood on the walls,” but his passion and perseverance eventually won out due to his personality and position. However, it could not be duplicated and could not be a model for a system design for repeated innovation. Beginning in 1999, a systematic approach to innovation was initiated, and today, IBM has a system in place to provide support\n\nc01.indd 5\n\n1/3/08 2:05:45 PM\n\n6\n\nGRABBING LIGHTNING\n\nfor people like Meyerson: the emerging business opportunity management system. Entrepreneurial scientists or novel ideas that crop up anywhere in the company now have a place to go to get management attention, resources, and help. Scientists make great discoveries, but few of them indeed are also willing and able to pursue customers, negotiate alliance deals, develop a business model, and consider plant location decisions, as Meyerson did, all the while working to convince the company to adopt the initiative as part of their strategy for future growth. The emerging business opportunity system is not dependent on a single senior leader. It encompasses a team with the responsibility for breakthrough innovation (BI) within IBM. This team also has a staff group of consultants who can help guide teams like Meyerson’s, so that they are not left to handle all aspects of innovation on their own. IBM and other large companies have always had characters like Meyerson. They’re finally realizing through the school of missed opportunities that they need a more systemic approach to enable breakthrough innovation.\n\nBuilding a Capability for Breakthrough Innovation Large, established companies have never excelled at breakthrough innovation. Their management systems are designed to ensure highly reliable, repeatable processes. Everyone sticks to a plan based on market research and competitive trend analyses that tell them what to do. Their strategies are driven by financial objectives that they promise Wall Street. For the most part, the objectives are short term in nature because much of executive compensation is tied to quarterly performance. Breakthroughs crop up once in awhile in big companies, but they occur because impassioned champions don’t quit. They break the rules and find protection from one or two powerful senior leaders who believe in them. Why must this be the case? Large, established companies have access to the money, brains, and market\n\nc01.indd 6\n\n1/3/08 2:05:46 PM\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR INNOVATION\n\n7\n\npower that they can draw on to make things happen. It’s a waste to allow BI to happen by chance alone. And senior leadership knows it. They also know they can’t save their way to the future or acquire companies as their only growth strategy. Research shows that firms that successfully commercialize breakthrough innovation reap above-normal returns and higher-than-average market value over the long term, but they must have adequate systems for managing high uncertainty in place to help leverage their investments.2 Since we wrote our first book, we have been amazed at the extent to which companies are investing in developing systems for breakthrough innovation.3 They are experimenting with building innovation functions, departments, and disciplines that serve the objectives of breakthrough innovation; beginning to think of portfolios of breakthroughs; worrying about how to professionalize the career path for those involved in breakthrough innovation; and concerned with governance models. In short, they’re developing management systems for innovation that parallel the finely tuned management systems for operational excellence. Corning, for example, now has a vice president for strategic growth and new business development, a newly created position, who reports to the chief technology officer and operates out of the research and development division. His initial mandate was to find and articulate opportunities for breakthrough innovation. He has a team of people, organized as the Exploratory Marketing and Technologies Group, whose charge mirrors that of those in Exploratory Research: find new opportunities. Over the past three years, Mark, the vice president, and his team recognized that finding opportunities wasn’t enough, so he built a business development team whose members work with the breakthrough project teams to nurture them through the development process. Why? Why can’t R&D do that? Because there are business questions that arise: • • • •\n\nc01.indd 7\n\nHow do we build this as a new business? What applications might there be? Who should we partner with? How do we go about building a new customer base?\n\n1/3/08 2:05:46 PM\n\n8\n\nGRABBING LIGHTNING\n\n• What are the economics? • Where should this reside within Corning? • What path should the technology development take? These questions aren’t new; other writers have described these in previous books.4 What is new is that Corning is doing something about this in a systematic way. It has a dedicated team of people who are developing this expertise, working with a portfolio of projects to help develop the business part of the innovations. So is IBM. The senior vice president of strategy, Bruce Harreld, has been leading a charge since 2000 to develop and run a management system for horizon 3 (H3) businesses, IBM’s label for far future opportunities, that is, breakthrough opportunities. Everything about an H3 is different from a horizon 1 (H1) business, which is a mainstream business. Performance is measured differently, and people are recruited and then reviewed differently. Everyone in general management at IBM has had to undergo training to understand these differences. At Sealed Air, CEO Bill Hickey and the vice president of engineering are building their infrastructure, which they know they need. Who’s in charge of finding new ideas? Who builds them out into new businesses? What kind of oversight has to happen to make sure the new ideas do not get squelched once they move to the operating units? Sealed Air recently installed a corporate business development function that nurtures these opportunities. They’re learning how as they go along, but they’re dedicated to making it happen. Sealed Air’s Business Innovation Board oversees the BI portfolio. They link the portfolio to the strategic intent of the company—not their current strategy, but their vision of the company’s future businesses. At Kodak, a company that has been faced with profound technological change in its core businesses, the Systems Concept Center (SCC) was the BI hub for more than ten years (1994–2004). Those in the SCC found that business ideas that were generated and tested could not survive when they moved into operating\n\nc01.indd 8\n\n1/3/08 2:05:47 PM\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR INNOVATION\n\n9\n\nunits, so they built an accelerator: an identified group with its own performance metrics, people, and oversight board who nurtured projects in a high-growth phase. The reason this group came about is that nothing else had worked for Kodak. Mainstream businesses could not find the talent, the interest, the understanding, or the resources to invest in small, high-potential breakthrough businesses that weren’t to the level of predictable sales and cost levels. It wasn’t their mandate and wasn’t part of their performance requirements, so it didn’t work. The interesting thing about all of these companies is that none of them is following a skunk-works model. They’re not relying solely on placing venture capital bets in external companies. They’re not relying on champions to get it done against all odds. All of them are experimenting with making BI happen as part of the heart and soul of their company rather than as an offshoot, afterthought, or secret. They are expecting to simultaneously deliver on today’s pressures and the future’s uncertainties. “Senior leadership realized that while our responsibility is the long-run health of the organization, we spent most of our time on immediate problems,” Bruce Harreld at IBM told us. “We had to change that.” Companies are experimenting and are trying to figure this all out. We have been studying twelve of them in depth for four years and another nine who check in with us regularly because they too want to learn. All of these companies qualified for participation in our study because they have a declared strategic intent to develop a breakthrough innovation capability (BIC)—not the capability to allow a maverick to sneak through the system but a management system whose objective is to enable breakthroughs over and over. Not one of these companies, in our estimation or their own, has a complete high-functioning system yet. Our opportunity has been to observe them, see their struggles and their victories, and identify pieces of systems in each of these companies that, taken together, can create a BIC. From these insights we’ve developed a model that we have been using and testing successfully. It provides the building blocks and modus operandi for developing\n\nc01.indd 9\n\n1/3/08 2:05:47 PM\n\n10\n\nGRABBING LIGHTNING\n\ninnovations that will change the game, shake up industries, and shake up companies’ existing businesses by bringing dramatic levels of new value to the marketplace. These are the risky, uncertain investments that make company executives who need to respond to shareholders and Wall Street analysts very nervous. It takes courage, but also discipline and persistence stemming from an innovation management system. To become an integral part of any company on an equal footing with operations, marketing, finance, human resources, quality and other core functions, innovation, we believe, needs to become its own discipline, its own function in companies today. And we see the signs. It’s early yet, but the cues are apparent. This book describes an integrated management system for breakthrough innovation, details how it must function and how it interacts with the mainstream organization. It also highlights challenges that firms face as they develop these systems, which, in many ways, require managing in counterintuitive ways and helps set companies on the path toward developing that capability.\n\nA Primer on Breakthrough Innovation Management Systems In this next section we offer some definitions and frameworks to guide the discussion throughout the rest of the book. We start by defining breakthrough innovation and then go on to the elements of a management system for innovation. Finally we define what a breakthrough innovation capability is. Once we have those concepts in place, we can develop them more completely in the chapters that follow. What We Mean by Breakthrough Innovation There are many definitions of breakthrough innovation. Some believe breakthroughs disrupt currently functioning markets,5 while others define a breakthrough as anything that earns the firm a standing in a new market domain. Some say breakthroughs are predicated on new scientific discoveries,6 while others suggest\n\nc01.indd 10\n\n1/3/08 2:05:47 PM\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR INNOVATION\n\n11\n\nthat many breakthroughs are the result of clever business model innovations.7 Indeed, there are any number of ways to achieve breakthrough innovation. Working with our set of twenty-one companies as well as the Research on Research subcommittee of the IRI devoted to this project, we defined a breakthrough innovation as the creation of a new platform or business domain that has high impact on current or new markets in terms of offering wholly new benefits and high impact on the firm through expansion into new market and technology domains, increased revenues, and ultimately increased profits.8 These high-impact levels, though, come with a set of challenges and dilemmas. As the long development periods unfold, risk and uncertainty associated with breakthrough opportunities abound. Companies find themselves in the situation of having to develop new technological competencies, create new market spaces, acquire different resources, and adapt their organizational structure to house the resulting new business, because breakthroughs may not easily fit into the current structure of the company. The firms in our study use different terminology for breakthrough innovation. We’ve heard terms like scope change innovations, game changers, moonshots, radical innovations, and rockets to communicate the idea of breakthroughs. In fact, most of them told us they consider several different levels of innovativeness. We list some of their classifications in Table 1.1. Your company probably has one as well. Some of these categorization schemes are organized by time horizon, some by fit with the current organization, some by degree of technological advance, some by impact on the market. But all of our company participants agreed that the categories in the far right column, no matter what they were called, were riskier and more uncertain than the ones listed on the left or in the center. So, no matter what definition we use for breakthrough innovation, we are dealing with innovation opportunities that offer the promise of new growth platforms. They also may take the company into technology domains, business arenas, and domains of expertise that are unfamiliar and, in fact, may not yet even exist.\n\nc01.indd 11\n\n1/3/08 2:05:48 PM\n\n12\n\nGRABBING LIGHTNING\n\nTable 1.1 Innovation Categories Degree of Uncertainty and Ambiguity Relatively Low Company 1 Company 2\n\nCompany 3 Company 4 Company 5\n\nHorizon 1 Making the most of what we have Incremental Today Incremental\n\nModerate\n\nHigh\n\nHorizon 2 Getting new business\n\nHorizon 3 Breaking new ground\n\nPlatform Tomorrow Major Improvements Substantial CEO projects\n\nBreakthrough Beyond Step-outs\n\nCompany 6 Company 7\n\nIncremental Business unit projects\n\nCompany 8\n\nIncremental\n\nLonger term\n\nCompany 9\n\nAligned\n\nWhite space projects\n\nTransformational Advanced technology programs “We don’t have a clue” Gray space (multialigned)\n\nYour Company\n\nUp to this point we’ve discussed breakthrough innovation and its various incarnations. But this book is about how to build a breakthrough innovation capability. A breakthrough innovation capability is the ability for a firm to commercialize breakthroughs repeatedly. It provides the foundation for a company’s ongoing renewal and growth. A firm with this capability has more operating than reliance on hero scientists, strong champions, or mavericks for breakthroughs every once in awhile. There is a system built into the company’s infrastructure that addresses uncertainty and risk. It is different from the mainstream management system that’s focused on the relatively low-uncertainty world of operational excellence and maintaining customer loyalty. It is, in essence, a management system for innovation.\n\nc01.indd 12\n\n1/3/08 2:05:48 PM\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR INNOVATION\n\n13\n\nWhat We Mean by a Management System To be successful, any established organization must have a set of systems, structures, and processes that allows it to function efficiently and effectively. Typically when companies are founded, they are run by the founding entrepreneur or the founding team who makes all decisions, writes every check, draws up invoices, hires all the people, and assesses their performance. Obviously this works for only a very short period of time. An organization that does not adopt mechanisms for managing routine activities finds its opportunities for growth hampered. A management system is that set of elements needed to make an organization function effectively and efficiently. It moves decision making and execution beyond the original founder and ensures that behaviors are oriented to achieving organizational objectives. The five necessary elements are shown in Figure 1.1. Figure 1.1 Management System Elements Mandate and Responsibilities\n\nMetrics and Reward Systems\n\nLeadership and Governance\n\nc01.indd 13\n\nStructure and Processes\n\nResources and Skills\n\n1/3/08 2:05:49 PM\n\n14\n\nGRABBING LIGHTNING\n\nMandate and Responsibilities. The system’s objective or mandate, the first element, is about its purpose and what it is responsible for. The management system for ongoing operations of any established company must efficiently and effectively manage current markets and operations, so as to responsibly leverage stakeholders’ investments into profits. An innovation management system has a different purpose: creating new businesses as platforms for the firm’s growth and future health. Structure and Processes. The second element is the organizational structure and processes designed for innovation. Is there a group, department, or division responsible for breakthrough innovation? To whom do they report? Where is the locus of innovation activity? Should the innovation system be organized hierarchically, or should it be flat? Is it centralized or decentralized? Formal or informal? Rigid or flexible? What about innovation-related processes? In an ongoing operation designed to efficiently and effectively deliver goods and services in response to customers’ needs, processes abound. Market research, production scheduling, purchasing, inventory management, supply chain management, capital equipment maintenance, and new product development and launch all are driven by well-hewn processes that have been refined with experience. Indeed, ISO 9000 and other manifestations of the quality movement in the 1980s and early 1990s are a testament to the importance of processes in terms of cost savings and quality improvement. But processes for breakthrough innovation defy the concept of step-by-step variance reduction that is inherent in the process improvement techniques we apply today. Every breakthrough innovation requires learning many, many new things. The familiar can, in fact, be detrimental. Innovation processes must differ from those for ongoing operations and take on a more experimental, learning-oriented nature. This does not mean to say that processes don’t exist, only that they’re different.\n\nc01.indd 14\n\n1/3/08 2:05:49 PM\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR INNOVATION\n\n15\n\nResources and Skills. System resources fuel the management system. How does the system access the resources it needs? Ongoing operations are self-funded, generally and are expected to generate returns beyond their expenses. Innovation systems, however, are investments and must receive resources from the larger corporation. Are the system resources provided consistently or in an ad hoc manner? Are they contingent or stable? Are they considered an investment or an expense? What about finding and developing the necessary skills for innovation? The types of skills and talent needed to accomplish the system’s objectives, and the definition of roles and responsibilities, as well as the mechanisms for developing and promoting that talent, must all be in place in order for any management system to function effectively. The skills necessary for innovation differ from those required to run an ongoing operation, and so one would expect to find different roles, career paths, and recruitment and development strategies for people in an innovation system than for those rising through the ranks of the mainstream organization. Leadership and Governance. How are decisions made? Who makes them? Leadership for ongoing operations is oriented toward execution of current plans, working to prevent any deviations. Decisions are made by those in positions of authority based on predefined sets of criteria. But leadership for new business creation and breakthrough innovation must set a culture that tolerates learning and experimentation, creativity, failure, and the parsing together of tidbits of information to chart a new course on a regular basis. Decisions may be made by a broader set of people, since gaining buy-in for these new businesses may be a strategic choice that involves a number of constituents in the company. Metrics and Reward Systems. Metrics used to measure the system’s performance and the reward systems for those operating within the system are the final element that rounds out the management system. In an ongoing operations system, individuals\n\nc01.indd 15\n\n1/3/08 2:05:50 PM\n\n16\n\nGRABBING LIGHTNING\n\nare rewarded for executing according to a plan, without deviating from the budget or the schedule. They are paid bonuses for following directions. In an innovation system, where the likelihood of failure is high, it’s inappropriate to reward for sticking to a plan since plans are upended regularly. What is the best way to reward those willing to take the path of uncertainty? Should breakthrough innovation teams have equity stakes in the ventures? Should the breakthrough innovation management system be measured on how much money it brings to the company? Over what time period? Adopting traditional near-term profit objectives for an innovation management system clearly would be foolish. How a Successful Management System Works A management system cannot be successful unless its elements reinforce one another. For example, if the decision-making criteria used to evaluate projects for funding are based on what is already known about success in familiar markets and with known technologies, but the projects being evaluated are characterized by high uncertainty and ambiguous outcomes (Will the technology work? What are the most likely applications? How might we derive value from this as a business? How will we develop the process innovations necessary to make this economically justifiable?), it’s very unlikely they’ll be funded. If the system’s objectives are to commercialize breakthrough opportunities, the decision criteria used must align with those objectives. Similarly, if the system’s objectives are operational excellence, hiring people who are highly creative but who struggle with sticking to a decision would be a disaster. Yet those very same people may thrive in an innovation system, where exploration and experimentation are highly valued. The management system for mainstream operations must differ from that of the breakthrough innovation function. Although the components of the system are the same, the way they operate is quite different, as illustrated in Table 1.2. The process for new product development in current lines of business fits with an\n\nc01.indd 16\n\n1/3/08 2:05:50 PM\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR INNOVATION\n\n17\n\nTable 1.2 A Comparison of Mainstream and Innovation Management Systems Mainstream Management Systems\n\nInnovation Management Systems\n\nObjectives and mandate\n\nEfficient, effective management of current markets and operations\n\nNew business creation in new and existing markets\n\nLeadership and culture\n\nPlanning and delivery oriented\n\nLearning and building oriented\n\nStructures\n\nClear and delineated\n\nFlexible\n\nProcesses\n\nStage-gate, project management oriented; avoid deviations from budget or schedule\n\nLearning and experimentation oriented, allow redirection based on new insights\n\nGovernance and decision making\n\nGo-or-kill criteria clear in advance, hierarchical decision making\n\nDecisions made based on strategic intent and continued learning; criteria not clear in advance; governance rather than hierarchy\n\nSkills and talent development\n\nFunctional expertise\n\nEntrepreneurial expertise\n\nSystem resources\n\nAnnual budget allocation\n\nResources acquired through many avenues\n\nMetrics\n\nOn-time delivery, cost containment, profitability\n\nPortfolio health and balance; connection with strategic intent of firm; new domains accessed; new resources garnered; new business starts\n\noperational excellence management system. It efficiently leverages what the organization knows for responding quickly and effectively to customer needs or competitive threats to current product lines or markets. But for breakthrough innovation, the company\n\nc01.indd 17\n\n1/3/08 2:05:50 PM\n\n18\n\nGRABBING LIGHTNING\n\nmust search for and create new knowledge, as well as leverage what it knows into new domains and develop new competencies to fill gaps as it goes. That’s a learning-oriented, experiment-based exploratory system, which is not traditionally rewarded in cultures of operational excellence. The point is that most successful firms have become adept in fine-tuning their mainstream management systems. But they’re telling us that they need new avenues for growth. Top-level managers are turning their attention to developing innovation systems that can be sustained, so they don’t have to rely on the one-off breakthroughs that occur by happenstance and strong personalities alone. Our research program has followed these efforts, and we’ve learned not only about what firms are doing but how they can do it better. Deﬁning a Breakthrough Innovation Capability A breakthrough innovation capability comprises three distinct building blocks, their interfaces with one another, and their interface with the rest of the organization. All of this is depicted in Figure 1.2. Let’s start with the building blocks: discovery, incubation, and acceleration. These are shown in Figure 1.3. How convenient that we can use the acronym DNA for discovery, incubation, and acceleration. (We know; we’re cheating a bit on iNcubation.) DNA, the biological sort, contains the genetic instructions for the development and functioning of organisms. DNA is the blueprint for an organism and its behavior. Similarly discovery, incubation, and acceleration are the building blocks of the innovation function in companies, Together they comprise an adaptable model for innovation in an organization. Discovery is the creation, recognition, articulation, and elaboration of opportunities. It encompasses many activities, including external scouting of technologies and hunting within the organization for good ideas and scientific research, all to find and generate ideas. But there’s more. Ideas are great, but they have to be\n\nc01.indd 18\n\n1/3/08 2:05:51 PM\n\nc01.indd 19\n\n1/3/08 2:05:51 PM\n\ninfluences\n\nExternal\n\nInternal influences\n\nD\n\nal er n I nt ce s uen l f in I\n\nEx tern al in f lue nces\n\nA\n\nFinancial stress of company\n\nTime\n\nPace of technological change\n\nGlobal economic expansion\n\nCulture, history of innovation\n\nCapacity\n\nSenior leadership declares need for more innovation\n\nStrained stock market\n\nEconomic expansion\n\nD\n\nNew competition\n\nA\n\nCapacity\n\nPoor earnings\n\nIndustry consolidation\n\nCEO change refocus on innovation I\n\nLawsuit\n\nFigure 1.2 Model of Breakthrough Innovation Capability\n\n20\n\nGRABBING LIGHTNING\n\nFigure 1.3 The Building Blocks of Breakthrough Innovation Capability Oversee Transitions/Interfaces\n\nDiscovery Creation, recognition, elaboration, articulation of opportunities Conceptualization • Basic research • Internal hunting • External hunting/ license/purchase/invest\n\nIncubation Evolving the opportunity into a business proposition Experimentation • Technical • Market learning • Market creation • Strategic domains\n\nAcceleration Ramping up the business to stand on its own Commercialization • Focus • Respond • Invest\n\ndeveloped, elaborated, and envisioned as business opportunities. These may be flickers of insight or combinations of technologies that together create enormous possibilities for bringing new value to the marketplace. Discovery requires creativity and a high degree of conceptual skill. Incubation is all about experimentation—experimenting with the technical side of opportunities but also with the market, the possible economic models that a fledgling business could adopt, the business strategy, partners, value chains, and operations-related options. Acceleration refers to the focused investment on stimulating growth. It takes the results of the experiments in incubation and leverages those to build businesses rapidly and develop the new business platform to a point of maturity where it can survive as part of the mainstream company. If a company does not have all three of these building blocks in place, its BIC is not fully evolved, and something will suffer. Now let’s return to the idea of a management system. The management system for innovation plays out differently for each of\n\nc01.indd 20\n\n1/3/08 2:05:51 PM\n\nMANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR INNOVATION\n\n21\n\nthe building blocks, as shown in Figure 1.4. The skills and metrics for discovery, for example, are different from those of incubation, and both differ from the skills and metrics needed for acceleration. So too do their objectives differ, their funding models, and their governance mechanisms. Each has its own expression of the innovation management system, but together they combine to form the company’s innovation function. Also notice that Figure 1.4 shows that DNA is not simply a linear system through which a new breakthrough business opportunity progresses. We think of discovery, incubation, and acceleration as sets of activities, each with its own portfolio of opportunities ongoing within it. Resource allocation, prioritization, pacing, and other portfolio-level decisions will have to be made within and across each building block. This means that D, N, and A can’t be managed separately; rather, Figure 1.4 Management Systems for Discovery, Incubation, and Acceleration\n\nStructure and Location Mandate Leadership and Governance Roles and Responsibilities Processes Metrics\n\nDiscovery\n\nStructure and Location Mandate Leadership and Governance Roles and Responsibilities Processes Metrics\n\nIncubation\n\nAcceleration\n\nStructure and Location Mandate Leadership and Governance Roles and Responsibilities Processes Metrics\n\nc01.indd 21\n\n1/3/08 2:05:52 PM\n\n22\n\nGRABBING LIGHTNING\n\nattention has to be paid to their interfaces. How will projects be moved from discovery to incubation? From incubation to acceleration? From incubation back to discovery if necessary? And how will new opportunities that become apparent in acceleration be captured in discovery? Someone must have responsibility for the overall function. Finally, the model in Figure 1.2 shows that the DNA system occurs in the broader context of the company, the industry, and the economy. The DNA’s interface with the rest of the organization will change based on these pressures that the organization is facing. We call that the organization’s capacity for innovation, the subject of the next chapter. As Figure 1.2 shows, capacity changes over time. Note the person in Figure 1.2 who is running interference between the innovation management system and the mainstream organization. The interface must be orchestrated (that’s why our figure shows a person with a baton) by either a single person such as a chief innovation officer or a board. Someone has to be held responsible for innovation in established companies. “If someone doesn’t own it, nobody owns it,” the saying goes. History shows that new business incubators, new ventures divisions, or other groups that have been founded to accomplish major innovation in companies often don’t last. Nortel Networks’ didn’t. Lucent’s didn’t. Xerox’s didn’t. Even 3M’s didn’t. Their average life span has been four years in fact.9 The idea that an orchestrator powers the innovation function up and down given the company’s ability to absorb new businesses is key to ensuring that the innovation capability is not lost, but remains part and parcel of the company, just as the marketing function remains even when marketing budgets must at times be cut. The rest of this book describes each of the pieces of this innovation function in detail. We provide examples of how firms are approaching discovery, incubation, and acceleration, knitting them together and handling the tricky aspect of orchestration. Not one of our participating companies is truly satisfied with its current systems, but many of them are making progress. They’re in it for the long run.\n\nc01.indd 22\n\n1/3/08 2:05:52 PM\n\n2 ASSESSING YOUR ORGANIZATION’S CAPACITY FOR BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATION\n\nRita (a fictitious name but a real person) was an assistant manager of project engineering for a large multidivisional firm ’s corporate engineering function. While attending an annual professional meeting of R&D managers, she heard a speaker on the subject of managing for breakthrough innovation (BI). Rita became aware, through further reading and correspondence with the speaker, of the challenges and different management approach required for managing for breakthrough innovations compared to traditional project management. She was enthralled with this new approach, which she believed could help her company plow new ground and move away from the faltering, riskaverse approach it traditionally took toward innovation. She described what she’d learned to Dave, her immediate boss, and he too became excited. Together they sought a sponsor in the senior management ranks to help them start an innovation hub. Through this sponsor (who was technical assistant to the group vice president of one of the company ’s largest groups), they requested the approval of the company’s president. The word from him was “go do it.” In fact, the president agreed to have regular meetings with the small team. They received some initial funds, and off they went, assembling the core staff team they needed, facilitating idea-generation workshops, and developing a pipeline of innovation projects that\n\n23\n\nc02.indd 23\n\n1/3/08 2:06:23 PM\n\n24\n\nGRABBING LIGHTNING\n\ndidn’t fit neatly within the company’s lines of business and could dramatically change the industry in which they were participating. Initially things went very well. They were finding people in the organization who were enthusiastically volunteering to work in their group. Employees in the business units were initially shy about stating their ideas for potential game-changing businesses they believed the company should initiate, but these idea-generation workshops really gained steam. People became enthused, and the group’s reputation spread. People from central R&D began to seek them out for business development help. In fact, they were becoming overloaded with work. The opportunities were great. Before too long, several of their projects matured to the point that larger investment amounts were needed. The group also needed a dependable, multiyear budget, since their portfolio of projects spanned longer time frames than the company’s traditional planning cycle. They also needed to add more people (they were a group of about five at the time). Some of the projects were evolving in a manner that did not fit into the company’s current business unit structure and would require some major organizational decisions. Then the company merged, and a lot of change was underway as the two companies worked to become one. The president became increasingly unavailable, and controls grew tighter. The group was given less and less discretionary money, and pressures to get one of its businesses launched grew. Rumors began to float that the president was going to bring in a new leader for innovation. This, in fact, happened in the group’s third year of operation, when he named a vice president of new ventures and BI. This person had had significant experience in the venture capital industry, starting companies from scratch. But he had not had experience as a member of a large, established company. Rita and Dave’s group was shut down within six months; only one of their projects remained. The new vice president brought in three projects that he’d known of from previous consulting experience with the firm and formed a ventures division. Those\n\nc02.indd 24\n\n1/3/08 2:06:24 PM\n\nASSESSING YOUR ORGANIZATION’S CAPACITY FOR BI\n\n25\n\nprojects remain in that division today. There is no pipeline. There are no staff members cultivating new opportunities, interacting with R&D or externally, or incubating potential businesses. Why not? Because the organization was not ready or able or willing to handle BI at the time. It had a constrained capacity for BI and, in fact, the more the president saw and learned of it, the more uncomfortable he became. What he wanted, in fact, was better incremental innovation. Between the president’s hands-off approach, his liaison to the venture capitalist consultant, the merger, and the company’s culture of winning through dominance of current markets, the context was not munificent enough for the innovation hub team to get their legs. They’d gotten a great start, but did not have the capabilities to convince the senior leadership team that innovation from within was vital to the company. They clearly heightened the president’s awareness of the benefits of innovation, and today they have four ventures growing in a separate organization. In addition, Rita now leads an innovation task force that is facilitating the business units’ innovation objectives and developing a strategy for innovation using partnerships, cross-linking opportunities across business units, and improved incremental innovation. Who knows? Someday this company may decide it has leveraged incremental innovation to its fullest and will look for the breakthroughs. If Rita and Dave are still there, they may be able to restart their innovation hub. But perhaps not. Companies cannot, and perhaps do not need to invest in BI at the same levels all the time. It’s certainly true that companies vary their investments in marketing or R&D as required by competitive conditions or current strategy. But companies always invest something in marketing or R&D. They never expunge it from their organization; they just manage it differently. So too with innovation. We call this the organization’s capacity for innovation. Depending on your company’s capacity at the time, the innovation function must be managed differently. But it should never be extinguished. That’s just too costly.\n\nc02.indd 25\n\n1/3/08 2:06:24 PM\n\n26\n\nGRABBING LIGHTNING\n\nCapacity for Innovation We define organizational capacity as the context and conditions for BI in the company at a given time. This includes the ability and will to resource and pace breakthrough innovations. Obviously capacity will vary. It is influenced by both internal and external factors. Some factors that influence capacity are fluid, meaning they change frequently, and others do not. Take a look at the model again, reprinted here as Figure 2.1. Notice the two sets of lines that form a boundary around the DNA system? Those represent the company’s capacity. The outer lines, on both the top and the bottom, represent the factors external to the company that are important to its ability and will to engage in BI, such as economic cycles, the entry of new competitors, or the pace of technological change. These factors cannot be managed, only anticipated (most of the time) and responded to appropriately. Examples of external influencers on capacity include: • A multi-billion-dollar lawsuit levied against one of our companies in the 1990s prevented attention to the matter of innovation until it was settled in 2002. • When the telecommunication market imploded in 2000 and, with it, the demand for fiber-optic cable, Corning’s revenues plunged by 50 percent in one year, from $6 billion to $3 billion. Its stock dove from a high of $113.33 on September 1, 2000, to a low of $1.10 on October 8, 2002. It dampened Corning’s ability to invest in innovation. • The aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist bombings threw the U.S. economy into a downward spin for approximately one and a half years. • The methods used to sequence the human genome have provided opportunities for directed drug discovery and new understanding of diseases.\n\nc02.indd 26\n\n1/3/08 2:06:24 PM\n\nc02.indd 27\n\n1/3/08 2:06:25 PM\n\ninfluences\n\nExternal\n\nInternal influences\n\nD\n\nal er n s I nt nce lue f n i I\n\nEx tern al in f lue nces\n\nA\n\nFinancial stress of company\n\nTime\n\nPace of technological change\n\nGlobal economic expansion\n\nCulture, history of innovation\n\nCapacity\n\nSenior leadership declares need for more innovation\n\nStrained stock market\n\nEconomic expansion\n\nD\n\nNew competition\n\nA\n\nCapacity\n\nPoor earnings\n\nIndustry consolidation\n\nCEO change refocus on innovation I\n\nLawsuit\n\nFigure 2.1 Model of Breakthrough Innovation Capability\n\n28\n\nGRABBING LIGHTNING\n\nAll of these factors are external influencers on a company’s capacity for innovation. They come from outside the organization and may affect only one organization, the entire set of industry players, or the economy as a whole. They may affect the capacity for innovation positively or negatively. But they’re not controllable and cannot be stopped. They have to be considered as a context. The most a company can do is remain aware of them, consider their impact on innovation, and set their expectations for innovation appropriately given the context. The inner lines in Figure 2.1 represent internal factors. Internal factors are company specific and are brought on the company by itself in some way. For example, Jerry Junkins, president and CEO of Texas Instruments (TI) died suddenly on a trip to Europe in May 1996. He had been the driving force behind innovation at TI and, in particular, the digital light processing (DLP) technology that was just coming to market at the time of his death. The DLP business accounts for nearly $2 billion in annual revenues today, but at the time it required Junkins’s support and leadership. Perhaps a key business unit’s earnings plummet due to a recall or a key business unit introduces a product that’s raking in very high margins. Or you’re in the commodity chemicals business, so the focus of your organization is always on cost reduction rather than other sorts of innovation. Or you’ve historically been a company that focuses on big engineering projects, and you’ve been successful at that. All of these examples are internally based influences on a company’s capacity. They’re not necessarily controllable, especially over the short term. Notice that the lines at the bottom of Figure 2.1 are less wavy than the lines on the top. That’s because the lines on the top represent factors (both external and internal) that can change easily and may change frequently. Those on the bottom represent factors that are comparatively stable; they may change in ten- or twentyor even fifty-year time horizons. So we have two dimensions of capacity. The first is the source of capacity influencers. Sources may be internal (such as a lack\n\nc02.indd 28\n\n1/3/08 2:06:25 PM\n\nASSESSING YOUR ORGANIZATION’S CAPACITY FOR BI\n\n29\n\nof appropriately skilled people or a CEO who is extremely supportive of innovation) or external (such as the general economic conditions, or a new strategy from a competitor). The second dimension to consider is the dynamism of capacity influencers. Some may be highly dynamic and change very quickly, such as competitive prices or a commitment to innovation as a result of a senior leadership change. Other capacity influencers may take many years to evolve, including the degree of industry turbulence. Turbulence in the elevator industry, for example, is very, very low and has been for many years. If we consider these two dimensions together, an interesting framework emerges, shown in Table 2.1. Externally Based, Highly Dynamic Inﬂuencers These are easily recognized, and there’s not much anyone can do about them. Stock market volatility plagues innovation, and\n\nTable 2.1 Sources of Capacity Inﬂuencers\n\nc02.indd 29\n\nInternal\n\nExternal\n\nHigh Dynamic Capacity Influences\n\nLeadership changes, merger, number of breakthrough projects in late stages, stated business innovation mandate and scope, status of core business\n\nStock market, venture capital environment, lawsuits, changes in regulations, new competitors, technology landscape, currency exchange rates, availability of appropriately trained workforce to draw on\n\nLow Dynamic Capacity Influences\n\nNature of technological innovation historically pursued, commitment to a particular product architecture, degree of capital intensity, belief system about innovation, organizational culture and values\n\nDegree of industry turbulence, strength of external networks, market structure, regulatory strength, trade barriers, presence of industry consortia conducting research or promoting innovationfriendly government policy\n\n1/3/08 2:06:25 PM\n\n30\n\nGRABBING LIGHTNING\n\nventure capital availability for new business creation outside the firm can create more start-ups to invest in. Regulatory changes, new competitors, and novel technical discoveries can all sway the firm’s ability and will to persist in developing its BI portfolio. Externally Based, Low Dynamism Inﬂuencers These influences can’t be changed readily. The elevator industry hasn’t had a major innovation in over a hundred years, the people at Otis Elevator told us when they developed the solution to the problem of limits on elevators in mile-high buildings. Some industries, such as the nuclear power and electric power industries, are run as oligopolies for years. Others, such as the defense industry, are plagued by regulatory oversight. Still others, like the pharmaceutical industry, compete on the basis of technological innovation and discovery. Internally Based, Highly Dynamic Inﬂuencers These influences on a company’s innovation capacity include senior leadership turnover, specifically cases in which the new leader places a new priority level on innovation. Examples include GE’s Jeff Immelt, who succeeded Jack Welch in 2001. Welch had started out as an entrepreneurial sort, but he migrated quickly to an operational focus on process excellence and growth through acquisition. While acquisitions continue to play a role in GE’s growth, Immelt recognized the need to return to innovation for GE ’s next waves of growth, and the company has completely refocused. Similarly, the return of Corning’s CEO, Jamie Houghton, from retirement to replace John Loose in April 2002 refocused the company on innovation. Mergers, like the Sealed Air and Cryovac merger in 1998 and GE’s acquisition of Amersham influence a company’s innovation capacity. Cryovac, it turns out, had a history of organic growth through technological innovation, whereas Sealed Air had grown primarily\n\nc02.indd 30\n\n1/3/08 2:06:25 PM\n\nASSESSING YOUR ORGANIZATION’S CAPACITY FOR BI\n\n31\n\nby acquisition. Through this partnership, Sealed Air gained increased capacity for innovation. The mandate for BI in a company can change on a whim as well. First, it’s supposed to focus on opportunities that are far into the future but aligned with the company’s current business units. Then it’s supposed to focus on white space opportunities: those that are adjacent to current business domains. Then it’s supposed to be focused on multialigned, or system-level, opportunities. And then it’s supposed to be project focused, then platform focused. It’s enough to drive anyone crazy. A final example of a highly dynamic internal influence is the status of the core businesses. The financial health of the operating companies has a clear impact on its ability and will to provide resources to and absorb new innovative businesses. It’s not always straightforward how, though. Companies that are swimming in money may not feel the sense of urgency needed to pay attention to growth opportunities. One of our company business innovation portfolio managers told us, in fact, that his greatest anxiety was that the senior leadership team would grow bored with the projects that he was incubating. Business was good, and top management needed to ensure that it would stay that way by making investments to ensure the growth and health of domains in which they already played. Here the excitement was in the growth of existing businesses rather than in investing in new businesses with returns far in the horizon. Internally Based, Low Dynamism Inﬂuencers These influencers of capacity are listed in the lower left cell of Table 2.1. The first is the nature of technolog"
