Leveraging the chips means that HPE can deliver the economics of a single processor, but with more performance than competing solutions that feature two processors. That ultimately results in 25 percent better price performance with the ProLiant DL325 Gen10. The server “reduces price in two ways,” said John Kolimago, executive vice president and general manager of cloud solutions at Blue Bell, Pa.-based Anexinet. “There’s the acquisition cost of the technology itself—that’s a big benefit. But where the rubber really meets the road is with the licensing models that many ISVs have, where they pay by the processor. If you can do the same amount of work on one processor, where previously it took two, you’ve effectively halved your licensing cost with your ISV.”\n\nSubcategory Winner—Customer Demand, Revenue and Profit: Cisco UCS C4200\n\nCisco’s Unified Computing System C4200 targets compute-intensive, scale-out workloads with its high-density, multi-node server that maximizes application performance and operational efficiency.
