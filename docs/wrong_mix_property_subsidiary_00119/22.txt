Hereâ€™s the plain truth about industry: When technologies advance exponentially, organizations get uncomfortable. The result of this discomfort is silence, and this silence echoes throughout the history of innovation. To IBM, Apple was they who must not be named. Japanese design made Detroit automakers go hush. The word "digital" caused Kodak to clap hands over their ears. With each of these, the mistake was the same - A refusal to address and tame the elephant in the room. Today's world is no different. OSICON 2023 is your chance to meet with fellow business leaders and discuss the ways innovation is changing life on Earth. Join us at Ohio's Toledo Zoo, November 7th-9th, to take part in talks with industry experts, peer reviews, learning tracks, trade show, plus lots of scheduled activities and fun. #erp #advancedmanufacturing #osicon https://osicon23.com/
