Originally started by Herman Hollerith as the Tabulating Machine Company in 1896. The company was later part of a merge arranged by Charles R. Flint that merged the International Time Recording Company, Computing Scale Company, and the Tabulating Machine Company on June 16, 1911, as the C-T-R (Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company).

In 1924, C-T-R adopted the name IBM (International Business Machines). Today, IBM is one of the most well-known and successful computer companies in the world and is sometimes called Big Blue.
