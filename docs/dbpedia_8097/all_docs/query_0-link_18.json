        "text": "She was seen as one of the more effective Remain campaigners during the referendum, famously launching a series of stinging, personal attacks on Boris Johnson in one brutal live TV debate.\n\nBecause of her high-profile and outspoken support for Remain, Rudd became a bête noire of the Brexiteers but has nevertheless been handed one of the biggest jobs in government.\n\nRemain or Leave? Remain\n\nAge: 52\n\nEducation: Private school, University of Edinburgh\n\nTrade Secretary: Liam Fox\n\nThe former GP and hardline Brexiteer was seen as having “a good campaign” after managing to oppose the government without overstepping the line.\n\nAs defense secretary in the coalition government, Fox was forced out of office for allowing a close friend too much access to his departmental work. Cameron offered him a return to government but in a much more junior role, which Fox turned down.\n\nHis return to government under May is a major revival of his political career after he finished last in the leadership contest to replace Cameron. Fox is a traditional Thatcherite free marketeer, committed to opening up new trade routes outside Europe.\n\nRemain or Leave? Leave\n\nAge: 54\n\nEducation: State school, University of Glasgow\n\nBrexit Secretary: David Davis\n\nThe former member of the territorial SAS has long been a thorn in Cameron’s side. But as a committed libertarian, Davis has also regularly clashed with May – particularly over plans to extend the right of the security services to monitor people’s internet history.\n\nAnd yet those who know May insist that she trusts him and respects his ability.\n\nOn Europe David has been as hardline as any Tory backbencher. In an article for the website Conservative Home earlier this month, Davis set out his vision for Brexit: “Trade deals. Tax cuts. And taking time before triggering Article 50. A Brexit economic strategy for Britain.”\n\nDavis wants tariff-free access to the single market and new powers to strike free trade deals with the rest of the world. But he is also willing to risk being forced out of the single market if that’s what it takes to regain control of Britain’s laws, taxes and immigration controls.\n\nRemain or Leave? Leave\n\nAge: 67\n\nEducation: State school, Warwick University, London Business School, Harvard\n\nDefense Secretary Michael Fallon\n\nIt is unsurprising that Fallon is the one senior Cabinet figure not to be moved in the first round of May’s cabinet reshuffle.\n\nUnder Cameron, Downing Street aides rated Fallon, a veteran Thatcherite, as the best operator in government. If there was a tricky interview, Fallon was the one to do it.\n\nAs defense secretary he has closed down any controversies and overseen military strikes in Iraq and Syria without complaint. He’s a safe pair of hands and the ultimate Westminster grown up. Former Number 10 aides believe he could easily be the next chancellor or foreign secretary.\n\nRemain or Leave? Remain\n\nAge: 64\n\nEducation: Private school, University of St Andrews\n\nJustice Secretary and Lord Chancellor: Liz Truss\n\nThe former environment secretary replaces Michael Gove in justice after he became one of the major casualties of May’s rapid-fire reshuffle.\n\nTruss also becomes the first woman to hold the post of Lord Chancellor. The two roles go together, although the position of justice secretary is less than 10 years old and the role of Lord Chancellor dates from the Middle Ages.\n\nA socially liberal Thatcherite, Truss originally backed Boris Johnson for the leadership before switching to May.\n\nTruss was a deputy director at Reform, a think tank, and worked in the energy and telecommunications industry for 10 years. She is a qualified management accountant.\n\nRemain or Leave? Remain\n\nAge: 40\n\nEducation: Private school, Oxford University\n\nEducation Secretary: Justine Greening\n\nGreening is one of the biggest winners in the May revolution, taking on Nicky Morgan’s old beat at education — and in doing so becoming the first Tory education secretary who went to a comprehensive school.\n\nThe former international development secretary also becomes the minister for women and equalities.\n\nIn June she revealed she is in a same-sex relationship, making her the only openly gay woman in the Tory cabinet.\n\nDespite being a Remain campaigner, she tweeted her announcement shortly after the referendum: “Sometimes you’re better off out.”\n\nRemain or Leave? Remain\n\nAge: 47\n\nEducation State school, Southampton University, London Business Center\n\nChief Whip: Gavin Williamson\n\nWilliamson was almost guaranteed a big job after winning huge admiration among May’s closest aides for the way he ran her leadership campaign.\n\nAs David Cameron’s parliamentary private secretary, Williamson acted as the prime minister’s eyes and ears in the House of Commons — the link between Number 10 and the Tory backbenchers.\n\nIn this role he was “never out of the tea rooms,” one admiring Conservative colleague said. After May announced her leadership bid Williamson got in touch with her team to say he would like to help. May personally called back and asked him to become her campaign coordinator.\n\nMay’s aides described his impact on the team as “brilliant,” and credited him with quickly assembling a team of loyal, hard-working backbenchers, whips and junior ministers.\n\nHe is widely liked on the backbenches and is seen in Westminster as an inspired choice at a time when discipline within the party will be crucial, although his lack of experience may count against him.\n\nRemain or Leave? Remain\n\nAge: 40\n\nEducation: State school, Bradford University\n\nConservative Party Chairman: Patrick McLoughlin\n\nThe new Conservative Party chairman epitomizes the change of guard at the top of the government. Where David Cameron appointed his old friend Lord Feldman as a fundraising CEO-style party chief, May has moved the working class former miner to take over the role.\n\nRemain or Leave? Remain\n\nAge: 58\n\nEducation: State school, Staffordshire College of Agriculture\n\nTransport Secretary: Chris Grayling\n\nThe former House of Commons leader could be forgiven for being slightly disappointed not to have landed a bigger job after bringing much-needed Euroskeptic kudos to May’s leadership campaign. Grayling, though, may have been hampered by his last stint running a department. After leaving the Ministry of Justice almost all his policies were reversed by Michael Gove.\n\nRemain or Leave? Leave\n\nAge: 54\n\nEducation: State school, University of Cambridge\n\nEnvironment Secretary: Andrea Leadsom\n\nA junior energy minister under David Cameron, Leadsom’s appointment to the cabinet would ordinarily be seen as a major promotion. But such was her ascendency until Monday’s dramatic decision to withdraw from the Tory leadership race that she may be underwhelmed by her new job. Before announcing that she planned to run for leader it was rumored that she was asking to be chancellor under Boris Johnson. May’s decision to offer Leadsom a cabinet position is another example of trying to build bridges within the party.\n\nRemain or Leave? Leave\n\nAge: 53\n\nEducation: State school, Warwick University\n\nCommunities and Local Government Secretary: Sajid Javid\n\nApart from Cameron and Osborne, the now former business secretary is widely regarded to have had the worst Brexit campaign of any minister. The high-flying former banker was an outspoken Euroskeptic but backed a vote to Remain, sparking anger among Brexiteers and mistrust among pro-Europeans. Javid backed Stephen Crabb for the leadership in a “blue collar dream team” but they fell badly in the second round of voting. His appointment as local government secretary is a sideways move from business.\n\nRemain or Leave? Remain\n\nAge: 46\n\nEducation: State school, Exeter University\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary: Damian Green\n\nA close friend of the new prime minister, Green has known May since university and worked with her in the Home Office during the early years of the coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. Green, who sits on the left wing of the party, is likely to take a far softer line on welfare cuts than his predecessor Iain Duncan Smith. His appointment to the department — beset by continuing problems with Duncan Smith’s universal credit scheme — is a clear sign of confidence from May.\n\nRemain or Leave? Remain\n\nAge: 60\n\nEducation: Grammar school, University of Oxford\n\nEnergy and Industrial Strategy Secretary: Greg Clark\n\nState school educated and raised in deprived Middlesbrough, Clark is another nod to May’s vision of a One Nation government. The former Communities Secretary is close to veteran Tory peer and former deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine who has pushed for a more interventionist economic policy to spur development in northern England. In her pitch for the Tory leadership May called for a more “strategic state” to help foster growth in key industries. The appointment of Clark, seen as a technocratic safe pair of hands, with new powers over “industrial strategy,” is a clear break from Osborne’s more free-market approach.\n\nRemain or Leave? Remain\n\nAge: 48\n\nEducation: State school, Cambridge University\n\nInternational Development Secretary: Priti Patel\n\nA hard-line Brexiteer and rising star on the Thatcherite right of the party, Patel is a counter-intuitive pick to oversee Britain’s foreign aid budget. Patel, though, is a second generation migrant, whose parents moved to the U.K. from Uganda. Expect a radically-different approach to aid spending.\n\nRemain or Leave? Leave\n\nAge: 44\n\nEducation: State school, Keele University\n\nCulture, Media and Sport Secretary: Karen Bradley\n\nA key May lieutenant, Bradley was always going to get a big job. The new culture secretary worked closely with May in the Home Office and quickly joined her leadership team following Cameron’s resignation last month.\n\nRemain or Leave? Remain\n\nAge: 46\n\nEducation: State school, Imperial College\n\nNorthern Ireland Secretary: James Brokenshire\n\nTechnocratic, reliable, loyal, Brokenshire is the ultimate Mayite Tory. Having worked in the Home Office for more than six years he was seen as an outside tip to take the department’s top job, replacing the new prime minister. Brokenshire was a loyal Remainer, which is seen as crucial in his new role in Northern Ireland because of its close links to the Republic, a keen EU member state. He replaces Theresa Villiers, one of the most outspoken Brexiteers who backed Andrea Leadsom for the leadership.\n\nRemain or Leave? Remain\n\nAge: 48\n\nEducation: State school, University of Exeter\n\nSacked\n\nGeorge Osborne – former chancellor of the exchequer\n\nMichael Gove – former justice secretary\n\nOliver Letwin – former Brexit minister\n\nJohn Whittingdale – former secretary of state for culture, media and sport\n\nNicky Morgan – former education secretary\n\nTheresa Villiers — former Northern Ireland secretary\n\nTina Stowell — former leader of the House of Lords"
