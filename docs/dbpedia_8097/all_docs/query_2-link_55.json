        "text": "Former Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire is recovering after having lung surgery.\n\nThe Conservative MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup stood down from Theresa May's Cabinet earlier this month after finding out he had a lesion on his lung.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, Mr Brokenshire posted a photo on Twitter of himself by his hospital bed, giving the thumbs up as he prepared to go home.\n\nHe wrote: \"Discharged from hospital this morning after my lung surgery.\n\n\"The NHS doctors, nurses and support staff were absolutely outstanding and I could not have been in better hands.\n\n\"One hard step done but now the steady recovery and recuperation ahead. Will be taking things steadily.\"\n\nLast week, Mr Brokenshire wrote for Sky News about his experience leading up to surgery.\n\nHe told how his illness had started out as \"an odd niggle with my lungs\" and how investigations showed it to be a small lesion on his right lung.\n\nHe was told that he needed surgery to remove it, along with a surrounding portion of the lung.\n\nWriting on Twitter before his surgery, Mr Brokenshire said: \"(It) has been a difficult 2018 so far with obvious challenges to come in the days and weeks ahead.\n\n\"(I) have been significantly strengthened by my wonderful family and after all the kind and humbling comments from so many people.\""
