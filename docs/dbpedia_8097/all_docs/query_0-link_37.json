        "text": "CV\n\nEducated in Brentwood, Essex, he went on to study politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University before going on to work in businesses in the UK and abroad.\n\nMr Hammond worked in companies specialising in manufacturing, consultancy, property and oil and gas before standing as an MP.\n\nHe held a number of shadow portfolios while the Conservatives were in opposition, including shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.\n\nIn 2010 he was appointed Secretary of state for Transport before winning the top defence job in 2011. In 2014 Mr Hammond became the Foreign Secretary.\n\nWhy was he promoted?\n\nA supporter and long-time friend of Mrs May, Mr Hammond is one of her closes allies in Parliament.\n\nInteresting fact\n\nHis old classmate TV presenter Richard Madeley let slip that Mr Hammond was a goth at school. \"Used to arrive in class in leather trench-coat with the Guardian under his arm\", he tweeted.\n\nBoris Johnson\n\nAge: 52\n\nMP for Henley between 2001 and 2008 and then MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip since 2015\n\nCV\n\nAfter studying at Oxford University Mr Johnson trained as a journalist at The Times but he was quickly sacked after making up a quote.\n\nHe moved to The Telegraph and in 1989 he became Brussels correspondent.\n\nIn 1999 he became editor of the Spectator magazine before standing as an MP in 2001 when he won the Henley seat.\n\nDuring this time he was vice-chair of the party before standing down to take up the position of Mayor of London. He also held shadow ministerial roles.\n\nAs his time as Mayor drew to a close Mr Johnson stood again as MP, winning a London seat in 2015.\n\nWhy?\n\nA Conservative big-hitter with a good reputation among members and voters in general Mr Johnson would be an asset if he were on-side.\n\nInteresting fact\n\nScotland Yard has been accused of wasting taxpayers' money by launching an investigation into the alleged theft by Boris Johnson of a cigar case from the home of Saddam Hussein's deputy prime minister thirteen years ago.\n\nBefore being elected as an MP in 2010 she set up a freelance recruitment business.\n\nMrs Rudd was Parliamentary private secretary to the Chancellor from 2012-2013 before becoming assistant whip.\n\nShe was appointed under-secretary of state in the Department for Energy and Climate Change in 2014 before becoming Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change in May 2015.\n\nWhy was she promoted?\n\nA supporter of Mrs May's leadership bid, Mrs Rudd was one of the so-called Cameron cuties tipped for success under David Cameron.\n\nInteresting fact\n\nOnce married to writer AA Gill, she got into trouble on her last day at Cheltenham Ladiesâ€™ College by tying all the chair legs together in the dining room, according to a friend.\n\nMrs Rudd also made a fleeting appearance in Four Weddings and a Funeral, Andrea Leadsom's favourite film.\n\nHe was a Minister in the Department for Education between 1990 and 1992 and has served on a number of key select committees.\n\nHe was appointed Minister for Business and Enterprise in 2012 and then an energy Minister in 2013.\n\nIn 2014 he took on the role of Minster for Portsmouth and was then appointed Defence Secretary the same year.\n\nWhy?\n\nSeen as a steady hand in Government Mr Fallon supported Remain during the EU referendum campaign and gave Mrs May his backing during the leadership contest.\n\nInteresting fact\n\nMr Fallon was one of a small number of Conservatives who tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade Margaret Thatcher not to resign as Prime Minister.\n\nDavid Davis\n\nAge: 67\n\nMP for Boothferry from 1987 to 1997 when the seat became Howden and Haltemprice.\n\nNew job: Secretary of State for European Union Relations (the new so-called Minister for Brexit)\n\nCV\n\nMr Davis went to university at Warwick where he studies computer science.\n\nHe later took a degree at the London Business School and at Harvard.\n\nHe became the assistant whip in the Treasury in 1990 before becoming parliamentary secretary between 1993 and 1994.\n\nMr Davis was handed the role of Foreign Office minister in 1994 and later took on a number of shadow roles after Labour won the election in 1997.\n\nOf these, the most high profile was shadow home secretary, which he held between 2003 and 2008.\n\nWhy was he promoted?\n\nHe resigned from his post as shadow home secretary amid a row over civil liberties but as a Brexit-supporting back-bench heavyweight Mr Davis could lend vital credence to Mrs May's EU negotiating team.\n\nInteresting fact\n\nWas forced to deny that a stunt involving two blonde women with large breasts wearing \"It's DD for me\" t-shirts was anything to do with him during his leadership bid in 2005.\n\nLiam Fox\n\nAge: 54\n\nMP for Woodspring from 1992 to 2010 which then became North Somerset in 2010.\n\nNew Job: Secretary of State for International Trade\n\nOld Job: Defence secretary (2010 to 2011)\n\nCV\n\nEducated at state school in Scotland Dr Fox later studied medicine at Glasgow University. He worked as a GP and a civilian army medical officer before becoming an MP in 1997.\n\nDr Fox was an advisor to Micheal Howard in the early 1990s before becoming a Government whip.\n\nHe held a number of shadow roles and was party chairman between 2003 to 2005, before becoming shadow secretary of state for defence.\n\nWhen the Conservatives formed a Coalition Government in 2010 he became the defence secretary until 2011, when he stepped down from the role amid controversy about his close friend Adam Werritty, who had allegedly introduced himself as an advisor.\n\nCV\n\nEducated at state school in Rotherham before studying economics at Southampton University.\n\nShe later achieved an MBA from the London Business School before becoming a finance manager at Centrica.\n\nCurrently the Secretary of State for International Development, a post she has held since 2012.\n\nPreviously Secretary of state for Transport and economic secretary for the Treasury.\n\nWhy?\n\nOne of Theresa May's key backers from the start, Ms Greening has long been a champion of women in Parliament, just like the new Prime Minister.\n\nInteresting fact\n\nMs Greening only recently came out as a lesbian, announcing she has a long-term partner.\n\nShe spent 10 years as a management accountant and economics director at Cable & Wireless before becoming deputy director of Reform education think tank.\n\nHer appointment as Justice Secretary has been welcomed by Frances Crook, Chief Executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe appointment represents a significant departure from the government under David Cameron, in which Michael Gove served as Justice Secretary. Mr Gove declined to comment on his discussions with Theresa May, saying: \"It has been a privilege to serve for six years and I wish the new Government very well.\"\n\nInteresting fact\n\nLiz Truss becomes the first ever female Lord Chancellor in the thousand-year history of the role."
