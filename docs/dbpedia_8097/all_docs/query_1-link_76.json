        "text": "Mr Brokenshire has been described as a ‘decent’ man, with a wide-ranging political career covering drugs policy, immigration and Northern Ireland policy\n\nSon of a former council chief executive, Mr Brokenshire has been described as a “decent” man with a wide-ranging political career covering drugs policy, immigration and Northern Ireland.\n\nConsidered a close ally to the prime minister, having served under her in the Home Office, this connection also has the potential for recrimination - there are accusations of Mr Brokenshire’s personal involvement in the Windrush scandal, having served as immigration minister at the time of the policy’s inception.\n\nLiam Booth-Smith, chief executive of the Localis thinktank, said: “The sector would be hard-pressed to find a more decent person on the Tory benches than James Brokenshire.”\n\nSeveral other commentators have described him as “bland” but “diligent”.\n\nBorn in Southend, Mr Brokenshire went to a grammar school in Essex and studied law at Exeter University. Before becoming an MP Mr Brokenshire worked as a lawyer for 13 years, advising on mergers and acquisitions in the real estate team at Jones Day.\n\nHe is the son of Peter Brokenshire who, after five years as Epping Forest DC’s chief executive, he became chief of Greenwich LBC and then joined the Audit Commission as a director where he remained for nine years before retiring.\n\nNotable moments in his political career include drafting the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and leading negotiations following the Northern Ireland Executive collapse.\n\nPolitical career"
