        "text": "WITH THE FILLING out of new PM Theresa May’s cabinet, Theresa Villiers is out and James Brokenshire has taken over the top Northern Ireland job.\n\nA relatively unknown quantity to those in the North, 48-year-old Brokenshire has previously served in cabinet as minister of state for immigration and came out in favour of a Remain vote in last month’s referendum.\n\nTweeting earlier this evening, the MP said that he was “delighted and honoured” to have been asked to serve in the position of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.\n\nComing into the job, Brokenshire will have plenty on his plate. First up will be how to deal with the delicate issue of Northern Ireland’s relationship with the Republic in a post-Brexit world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the issue of the border Brokenshire has marked it as a concern, without saying anything definite.\n\n“Another huge challenge is to ensure that we make a success of the UK’s decision to leave the European Union,” he said.\n\n“It is vital that Northern Ireland’s interests are fully protected and advanced including in relation to the border.\n\nI am looking forward to working closely over the coming weeks and months with the Executive, the Irish government and the whole community in Northern Ireland to build a brighter, more secure future for everyone.\n\nAlso on the agenda will be the implementation of the Stormont House and Fresh Start Agreements which are in place to help tackle paramilitarism.\n\nSecuring Stormont’s finances and the future of the Good Friday Agreement are also priorities for the new appointee.\n\nPrior to getting into politics, Brokenshire practised law for 13 years.\n\nOther cabinet positions held by Brokenshire included minister for crime prevention and security minister at the home office.\n\nDuring his time in government he led the negotiations with the Jordanian government that led to the deportation of radical preacher Abu Qatada, and also oversaw security operations in advance of the London 2012 Olympics.\n\nRead: Theresa Villiers resigns as Northern Ireland Secretary\n\nAlso: Here is a list of people, places and things Boris Johnson has insulted or knocked over"
