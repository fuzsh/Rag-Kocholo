We had followed James Brokenshire’s fight against illness with a sense of hope, and although aware of recent setbacks, to learn of his death is still very much a shock. James was well-liked by those he came into contact with, and I remember fondly the many positive qualities James exhibited, not least his calm and professional approach. I extend my sympathy to his loved ones.”\n\n“I am saddened to hear of James Brokenshire’s death. He fought his cancer battle with real courage, both during his treatment and in campaigning to enhance public understanding of this terrible disease.\n\n“My thoughts are very much with his family at this time.”"
