        "text": "The House of Commons observed a minute’s silence for James Brokenshire on Wednesday afternoon after the MP died following a long battle with lung cancer.\n\nBoris Johnson led tributes to Mr Brokenshire, 53, describing him as a “gentleman” who “commanded respect” across the House.\n\nMr Brokenshire, the Conservative MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup, who previously served as Northern Ireland secretary and security minister, died on October 7.\n\nPaying tribute, the Prime Minister said: “The many tributes paid to James are testament to the esteem in which he was held.\n\n“He was unflappable, earnest and sincere, and he brought those same down-to-earth qualities into other areas of his life.\n\n“His diligence, composure and experience as a lawyer proved so valuable to the government. We can only imagine how much more good he would have done if he had been given the chance.”\n\nSir Keir Starmer, Labour leader, said Mr Brokenshire was a man of “decency” and spoke of his time shadowing him as immigration minister.\n\nHe told the House: “James went out of his way to ensure that I was heard with respect. That was his character.\n\n“We forged a friendship which lasted until his untimely death. Anyone who got to know James ended up respecting him and liking him.”\n\nFormer Prime Minister Theresa May, under whom Mr Brokenshire served in a string of ministerial roles, paid tribute to an “outstanding minister” and a “true friend”.\n\nShe added: “He cared about people and he cared about the work he was doing. That came through in all the decisions he made and in the way in which he reached out across this house to ensure those decisions were the right ones.”\n\nThe SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford said James Brokenshire was “a young man who clearly had so much more to give” and a “dedicated minister”.\n\nMr Blackford said: “I think all of us across this House looked on with deep admiration and awe at the sheer bravery he showed while bravely battling against the cancer that, sadly, ultimately took his life.”\n\nMr Brokenshire announced he had been diagnosed with lung cancer in 2018 and he had surgery to remove the upper lobe of his right lung.\n\nAt the time, non-smoker Mr Brokenshire said he had been prompted to see his GP after coughing up a small amount of blood.\n\nHe became vocal in calling for national screening for lung cancer and in April 2018 used a debate in Parliament to call for a national programme to improve poor survival rates.\n\nRead More\n\nFamily ‘overwhelmed’ by tributes paid to James Brokenshire\n\nThousands raised for lung cancer charity in memory of James Brokenshire"
