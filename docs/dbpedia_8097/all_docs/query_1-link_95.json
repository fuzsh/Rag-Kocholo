        "text": "Amber Rudd’s departure this morning from the Home Office has caused yet another round of musical chairs at the Government.\n\nHousing and Communities Secretary, Sajid Javid (pictured right) has replaced her, and he, in turn, is replaced by James Brokenshire (pictured left). Mr Brokenshire was formerly Northern Ireland Secretary, but resigned due to ill health, but now returns to Government, following successful treatment.\n\nThis morning, he tweeted, “Honoured to have been asked by the Prime Minister to serve as Secretary of State at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. Looking forward to taking the Government’s agenda forward especially on buildings the homes our country needs.”\n\nThe ever-positive LibDem leader, Vince Cable, said that, “The trouble is only just beginning,” for Theresa May.\n\nMore background on the new Housing Minister here."
