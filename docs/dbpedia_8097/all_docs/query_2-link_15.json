        "text": "Fellow politicians have paid tribute to Tory MP James Brokenshire, who has died aged 53, having been diagnosed with lung cancer more than three years ago.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson described the father of three, a former Northern Ireland secretary, as the \"nicest, kindest\" colleague.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer called him \"a thoroughly decent man\".\n\nMr Brokenshire, a lifelong non-smoker, stood down as a Home Office minister earlier this year.\n\nHe died in hospital on Thursday night, having been admitted after his condition deteriorated.\n\nAn MP since 2005, Mr Brokenshire served in government under three prime ministers - David Cameron, Theresa May and Mr Johnson.\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has ordered that flags in Parliament's New Palace Yard be flown at half-mast to mark \"a profound loss to us all\".\n\nMrs May tweeted: \"Truly saddened by the death of James Brokenshire. He was an outstanding public servant, a talented minister and a loyal friend.\"\n\nAnd Mr Johnson tweeted that it was \"desperately sad\", adding: \"James was the nicest, kindest and most unassuming of politicians but also extraordinarily effective.\"\n\nMr Brokenshire, who was MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup in Kent, resigned as Northern Ireland secretary in January 2018 following his lung cancer diagnosis, but made a comeback to the cabinet a few months later as housing secretary.\n\nHe lost that job in July 2019, after Mr Johnson took over from Mrs May in 10 Downing Street.\n\nMr Brokenshire re-entered government as a Home Office minister in February last year, but stood down in July this year, due to poor health.\n\nFollowing his death, Mr Brokenshire's family expressed \"deep sadness\", adding: \"James was not only a brilliant government minister... but a dedicated constituency MP.\n\n\"But most importantly, he was a loving father to his three children, a devoted husband to Cathy and a faithful friend to so many.\"\n\nThe family also thanked NHS staff, including those at Guy's & St Thomas' hospital in London, for treating Mr Brokenshire \"with such warmth, diligence and professionalism over the past three-and-a-half years\".\n\nThey also shared a memorial page on his Twitter feed, which encouraged people to share memories and photos of Mr Brokenshire and to donate to the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation in lieu of flowers.\n\n\"In the last few years of his life James's passion was to help others with lung cancer, preventing others going through what he did,\" the memorial page said, describing him as an \"indefatigable campaigner for better lung cancer screening\".\n\nAfter his lung cancer diagnosis, Mr Brokenshire, a former lawyer, worked to promote greater awareness of the disease, urging people who showed symptoms to get tested.\n\nFellow Conservative MP Karen Bradley told the BBC News Channel the news of her \"understated\" friend's death was \"heartbreaking\", adding: \"I can't believe I'm not going to be able to sit down with James again and have a laugh about life, and chat about the issues that we both cared about.\n\n\"My thoughts are with Cathy and the family, who are just the most wonderful family. I'm devastated.\"\n\nSir Keir Starmer tweeted: \"James Brokenshire was a thoroughly decent man, dedicated and effective in all briefs he held.\n\n\"He fought his illness with dignity and bravery. I'm incredibly sad to learn of his death and send my condolences to his wife and children.\"\n\nThe UK's most senior civil servant, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, said: \"I had the personal privilege of working with him closely over a number of years and admired greatly his unwavering commitment to public service and compassion.\""
