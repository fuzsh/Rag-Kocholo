        "text": "“One of the most friendly, thoughtful and well-liked members of the House of Commons.”\n\nThis reform will mean that families renting privately can sleep easier at night, knowing that the housing market they rely on has become fairer as a result.\n\nIt should be about the relationships between towns, cities and regions, as well as between the four nations that make up our United Kingdom.\n\nLessons from my recent visit to India with Andy Street and Sir John Peace, Chair of the Midlands Engine Partnership.\n\nSleeping rough is more than the lack of a bed; it’s a personal and social tragedy. How we respond to it is a litmus test for our society.\n\nAs Sir Roger Scruton notes: “Architecture is a public art: whether we like it or not, we are forced to witness it.”"
