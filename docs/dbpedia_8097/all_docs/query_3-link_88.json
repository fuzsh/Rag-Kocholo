        "text": "General Election 2015 cabinet reshuffle: Sajid Javid – three things you need to know about the new business secretary in David Cameron’s cabinet\n\nDavid Cameron has lined up Sajid Javid as his new secretary of state for business in his first all-Conservative government.\n\n1. In government\n\nJavid has had a meteoric rise in politics, having gone from parliamentary candidate to secretary of state in less than five years.\n\nJavid was culture secretary in the last government, a role he picked up after Maria Miller resigned due to a row over expenses in 2014. It was a role that one commentator said was \"a bit like asking George Soros to run the Glastonbury festival\".\n\nJavid has considerable experience in business and finance – inside and outside of government.\n\nIn coalition, he was formerly a finance secretary and economic secretary to the treasury, after becoming an MP for the first time in the 2010 election. He was also private secretary to chancellor George Osborne.\n\n2. Before government\n\nBefore being elected in Bromsgrove, the London-born MP was a senior managing director at Deutsche Bank, before leaving for the politics game in 2009.\n\nHe was head hunted to the bank from Chase Manhattan where he was the youngest-ever vice president at the age of 25 and spent four years living in New York. While there, he campaigned for Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThe son of a bus conductor, Javid was the head of global credit trading for Asia at Deutsche Bank and worked in Singapore. He was also the global head of emerging market structuring.\n\nHe studied economics and politics at Exeter university where he also joined the Conservative Party.\n\n3. In future\n\nThe 45-year-old has had a stellar rise through the ranks of the Conservative Party and the coalition government – something that's set to continue with an all Tory cabinet and a leading role in it.\n\nAlthough he may now be the top business minister, in a 2010 interview he said the DWP would be his department of choice if he had a chance to run any.\n\nAs Conservative MPs and senior City figures want the new government to rein in taxes aimed at banks, they could find Javid's ear a sympathetic one considering his background.\n\nJavid has been tipped as a potential leader by many. After the revelation that David Cameron won't serve a third term, Javid was the fourth favourite to replace him at the top of the party with odds of 10/1, behind Boris Johnson, Theresa May and George Osborne."
