He had always been so supportive of Lamorbey and Sidcup Local History Society projects, from writing the foreword to our Great War booklet, being a presence throughout the day at our Great War Pageant and even taking a role in our illustrated talk on the Queen's Hospital at Bexley Book Buzz in 2020. He will be missed. Our thoughts are with his family."
