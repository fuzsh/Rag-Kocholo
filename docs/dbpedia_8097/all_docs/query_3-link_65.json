        "text": "Boris Johnson is assembling Britain's most right-wing government since the 1980s with a hardline new Cabinet on his first day in 10 Downing Street.\n\nMore than half of Theresa May's cabinet - 17 out of 30 - were either sacked or resigned in the new PM's brutal reshuffle last night.\n\nBoth Remainers and supporters of leadership rival Jeremy Hunt were shown the door as Johnson ruthlessly dumped enemies - including Mr Hunt himself who quit after refusing a demotion to Defence Secretary.\n\nRight-wing Tories Sajid Javid, Priti Patel and Dominic Raab were ushered in as Chancellor, Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary respectively.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock and DWP chief Amber Rudd kept their jobs after swallowing their pride - and principles - to offer some support for Mr Johnson.\n\nHated Esther McVey becomes Housing Minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg leads the Commons and disgraced former Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson returned as Education Secretary despite having to resign over a national security leak (which he denied).\n\nIt's thought to be the biggest clearout of Government ministers in political history - one that takes us back to the ideology of Margaret Thatcher, rewards hard Leavers and tilts towards a No Deal Brexit or a forced general election.\n\nIt shocked Westminster with its speed and viciousness, rewarding loyalists and ejecting ministers who were key to Mrs May’s regime, and those he feared might torpedo his plan to tear Britain out of the EU without a deal on October 31.\n\nIt's also so big that the sacked ministers are in line for more than £250,000 in severance pay between them.\n\nSo who's backed for promotion, who's sacked by the boss, and who's cracked under the pressure in Boris Johnson's new-look team?\n\nWe've had a look at them all - and their more chequered records.\n\nThis piece is being updated throughout the Cabinet reshuffle.\n\nBACKED: The new Cabinet in full\n\nPrime Minister: Boris Johnson\n\nChancellor: Sajid Javid\n\nHome Secretary: Priti Patel\n\nForeign Secretary: Dominic Raab\n\nDefence Secretary: Ben Wallace\n\nCabinet Office Minister: Michael Gove\n\nTrade Secretary: Liz Truss\n\nChief Secretary to the Treasury: Rishi Sunak\n\nHealth Secretary: Matt Hancock\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary: Amber Rudd\n\nEnvironment Secretary: Theresa Villiers\n\nBrexit Secretary: Stephen Barclay\n\nEducation Secretary: Gavin Williamson\n\nCulture Secretary: Nicky Morgan\n\nBusiness Secretary: Andrea Leadsom\n\nCommunities Secretary: Robert Jenrick\n\nJustice Secretary: Robert Buckland\n\nScottish Secretary: Alister Jack\n\nTransport Secretary: Grant Shapps\n\nInternational Development Secretary: Alok Sharma\n\nNorthern Ireland Secretary: Julian Smith\n\nWales Secretary: Alun Cairns\n\nAttorney General: Geoffrey Cox\n\nChief Whip: Mark Spencer\n\nConservative Party Chairman: James Cleverly\n\nLeader of the House of Commons: Jacob Rees-Mogg\n\nLeader of the House of Lords: Baroness Evans\n\nUniversities Minister: Jo Johnson\n\nHousing Minister: Esther McVey\n\nImmigration Minister: Brandon Lewis\n\nPaymaster General: Oliver Dowden\n\nBusiness Minister: Kwasi Kwarteng\n\nNorthern Powerhouse Minister: Jake Berry\n\nSACKED & CRACKED: All 17 Tories sacked or resigned\n\nTheresa May (PM) - the 18th\n\nDavid Lidington (Cabinet Office minister)\n\nPhilip Hammond (Chancellor)\n\nJeremy Hunt (Foreign Secretary)\n\nPenny Mordaunt (Defence Secretary)\n\nDavid Gauke (Justice Secretary)\n\nGreg Clark (Business Secretary)\n\nLiam Fox (Trade Secretary)\n\nDamian Hinds (Education Secretary)\n\nJames Brokenshire (Communities Secretary)\n\nChris Grayling (Transport Secretary)\n\nDavid Mundell (Scottish Secretary)\n\nKaren Bradley (Northern Ireland Secretary)\n\nRory Stewart (Trade Secretary)\n\nJeremy Wright (Culture Secretary)\n\nMel Stride (Commons Leader)\n\nJulian Smith (Chief Whip)\n\nCaroline Nokes (Immigration Minister)\n\nPORTRAITS OF THE INS AND OUTS\n\nBACKED: New hires to Cabinet\n\nChief Whip: Mark Spencer\n\nVOTED REMAIN\n\nThe MP for Sherwood since 2010 will be the PM's own Sheriff of Nottingham, trying to win over Tory MPs in Brexit votes despite a working majority of just one or two.\n\nIt's an about-turn for Mr Spencer - who voted Remain in the 2016 referendum.\n\nThe state-educated politician studied at Shuttleworth Agricultural College in Bedfordshire and joined his family's farming and farm shop business.\n\nHe joined Parliament in 2010 where he was a backbencher for six years. His big break was in the Tory whips' office, which he joined in June 2016.\n\nHe prompted fury in 2015 by suggesting a \"dying\" benefit claimant, sanctioned after he turned up four minutes late, should \"learn the discipline of timekeeping\".\n\nLabour MP Lisa Nandy said the man \"hadn’t eaten for 5 days\" and \"looked like he was dying\" but Mr Sherwood cut in: \"It is important that those who are seeking employment learn the discipline of timekeeping.\"\n\nSeparately, Mr Spencer - who receives at least £10,000 in rent per year from a farm - was one of 72 Tory landlords who voted against a Commons bid to force all homes to be \"fit for human habitation\" in 2016.\n\nHome Secretary: Priti Patel\n\nVOTED LEAVE\n\nShamed Tory ex minister Priti Patel will be handed a plum job in Boris Johnson's top team - with some tipping her as a possible Home Secretary.\n\nTheresa May sacked Ms Patel as International Development Secretary in 2017 after she had 'off-the-books' meetings with senior Israeli officials during a 'family holiday'.\n\nBut Mr Johnson was expected to trumpet her return to the Cabinet as part of a record number of ethnic minority politicians in the team.\n\nThe 47-year-old MP for Witham, Essex, is a hard-right Tory who backs tax cuts and supported the death penalty until 2016. She's also a Brexiteer 'ultra' who voted against Theresa May's deal all three times in Parliament.\n\nShe was slammed in December for suggesting the government could use possible Brexit food shortages as \"leverage\". A government report said No Deal could prompt food shortages in Ireland - infamously crippled by the 19th Century potato famine. But Ms Patel told The Times: \"Why hasn't this point been pressed home during negotiations?\"\n\nThe grammar school-educated Tory apparatchik was born in London to Gujarati parents who fled Uganda in the 1960s and studied at Essex and Keele Universities.\n\nShe worked for the Tories and Sir James Goldsmith's Referendum Party in the 1990s before returning as William Hague's deputy press secretary from 1997 to 2000 - eventually becoming an MP in 2010.\n\nCivil liberties campaigners will be concerned about Ms Patel's appointment as Home Secretary. For many years she argued for the return of capital punishment - though she says her mind has changed on the subject in recent years.\n\nForeign Secretary: Dominic Raab\n\nVOTED LEAVE\n\nDominic Raab is a hard Brexit backing, tax slashing right-wing ideologue who famously only learned how important the Dover-Calais trade route was for Britain after becoming Brexit Secretary.\n\nAfter crashing out of the race to succeed Theresa May, Mr Raab backed Boris Johnson and has been rewarded for his loyalty with one of the great offices of state.\n\nAn ex-Foreign Office lawyer, he left the civil service to become chief of staff to another former Brexit Secretary David Davis.\n\nHe was elected MP for Esher and Walton in 2010 and joined the government in 2015, quickly rising through the ranks.\n\nMr Raab in his short spell as Brexit Secretary admitted that he hadn't fully read the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nIn 2011 Mr Raab said \"feminists are now amongst the most obnoxious bigots\" and said it was time for men to start \"burning their briefs\".\n\nIn 2017 he said most food bank users were not \"languishing in poverty\" but were instead had \"cash flow\" problems and has branded Brits \"the worst idlers in the world\".\n\nHe will also be First Minister of State, which effectively makes him Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nEducation Secretary: Gavin Williamson\n\nVOTED REMAIN\n\nGavin Williamson was sacked as Defence Secretary over leaks from the National Security Council.\n\nThat was 84 days ago.\n\nHe's now returning to frontline politics as Secretary of State for Education.\n\nIt's unclear whether this also signals a return to government for Cronus the tarantula.\n\nBusiness Secretary: Andrea Leadsom\n\nVOTED LEAVE\n\nAndrea Leadsom resigned from Theresa May's cabinet a little over two months ago in protest against her Brexit Strategy.\n\nShe stood in the election to replace Mrs May, but was eliminated in the first round of voting. She placed eighth out of 10 candidates, attracting just 11 votes from her fellow Tory MPs.\n\nCulture Secretary:\n\nSecretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs: Theresa Villiers\n\nVOTED LEAVE\n\nTheresa Villiers will replace Michael Gove as Environment Secretary.\n\nIt marks a return to Cabinet for the former Northern Ireland Secretary, who served for four years from 2012.\n\nVilliers was one of the six Cabinet ministers who came out in support of Brexit during the EU referendum.\n\nFollowing the referendum, on 14 July 2016, Villiers resigned from her position as Northern Ireland Secretary after saying that Theresa May had offered her a post outside the Cabinet which was \"not one which I felt I could take on\".\n\nBut despite solid Brexit credentials in the eyes of Team Boris, Villiers may not survive the next election, she has a majority of just 353 votes in her seat of Chipping Barnet.\n\nCulture Secretary: Nicky Morgan\n\nVOTED REMAIN\n\nThe former Education Secretary was once part of the Tories’ pro-EU wing that proved awkward for May.\n\nBut her acceptance of the result, and her support for Johnson during the leadership contest, meant a return to Cabinet was likely.\n\nMP for the marginal seat of Loughborough, she impressed at Education after being drafted in to repair the damage to relations with teachers inflicted by Michael Gove.\n\nAt Culture, her job will be to revive the ministry which some believe has suffered under the lacklustre leadership of Jeremy Wright.\n\nThe job is known in Westminster as “Minister for Fun” because perks include free tickets to major sporting events, film and music award ceremonies, and nights at the opera or pop concerts.\n\nMorgan will certainly bring more spark to the role than Wright, but she will have had to convince Johnson she will fully back his fallback plan for a no-deal Brexit.\n\nInternational Development Secretary: Alok Sharma\n\nVOTED REMAIN\n\nThe MP for Reading West was expected to reach the Cabinet table for the first time after spending three years as a junior minister.\n\nThe married dad-of-two, 51, attended the private Reading Blue Coat school and the University of Salford before qualifying as a Deloitte chartered accountant.\n\nHe spent 16 years in banking including investment banking before joining Parliament in 2010. He was made a Foreign Office minister in 2016 followed by the Communities Department and Department for Work and Pensions.\n\nLast year he faced shouts of 'pathetic!' as he tried to deny Universal Credit was forcing people to food banks - something his boss Amber Rudd later admitted. He also admitted the DWP \"dropped the ball\" when a scathing internal report on the benefit was published almost 18 months late.\n\nHe voted Remain in the 2016 EU referendum.\n\nTransport Secretary: Grant Shapps\n\nVOTED LEAVE BUT HAS SINCE CHANGED HIS MIND\n\nAn unexpected return to the Cabinet for Grant Shapps, who has been out of the top team since 2015.\n\nHe was demoted by David Cameron from his job as party co-chairman and Minister without Portfolio after revelations about his second job and use of the assumed names \"Michael Green\" and \"Sebastian Fox.\"\n\nHis demotion came after he admitted to having \"over-firmly denied\" having had a second job while he was an MP.\n\nScotland Secretary: Alister Jack\n\nVOTED LEAVE\n\nAlister Jack's appointment was met with a resounding \"who\" in the corridors of Westminster.\n\nAnd with good reason. He's only been an MP since 2017.\n\nIn just two years, he's managed to have had a role on the Treasury Select Committee, be appointed an aide to Andrea Leadsom and be made an Assistant Government Whip.\n\nAnd now he's in the Cabinet.\n\nChief Secretary to the Treasury: Rishi Sunak\n\nVOTED LEAVE\n\nLocal Government Minister Mr Sunak is considered a rising star of the Conservative Party.\n\nHe is seen as a capable media performer and a confident politician with detail.\n\nAn early backer of Boris Johnson, Mr Sunak was wheeled out by his campaign to defuse accusations that their candidate was a racist.\n\nIn the Brexit referendum, Mr Sunak backed leaving the European Union.\n\nA former entrepreneur he worked in California as an investor before in 2015 winning the ultra-safe Conservative seat of Richmond in Yorkshire, after former leader William Hague stood down.\n\nMr Sunak is married to Akshata Murthy, daughter of Indian businessman and billionaire N. R. Narayana Murthy.\n\nHousing minister: Esther McVey\n\nVOTED LEAVE\n\nIt's a demotion from her previous job as Work and Pensions Secretary, but welfare slasher Esther McVey has been brought back into the cabinet as a Housing Minister.\n\nUniversities Minister: Jo Johnson\n\nVOTED REMAIN\n\nBoris Johnson has given his brother Jo his old job back.\n\nJohnson Jr was minister for Universities and Science from 2015, until Theresa May moved him to transport in 2018.\n\nHe quit as a minister in November so he could back a second Brexit referendum.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what he does if it looks like we're heading for no-deal.\n\nPaymaster General: Oliver Dowden\n\nVOTED REMAIN\n\nA paid-up member of the political establishment, Mr Dowden rose through the ranks of Conservative wonkery before ending up in No10 as an adviser to David Cameron, and promoted to deputy chief of staff.\n\nHe once joked to an American interviewer that his job as a special advisor was \"day-to-day crisis management\" and he is seen by Tory insiders as a safe pair of hands.\n\nIn 2015 Mr Dowden, who is called 'Olive' by friends, was elected to the safe tory seat of Hertsmere in Hertfordshire in 2015.\n\nHe was also given a goodbye gong by departing PM and former Boss David Cameron becoming a Commander of the Order of the British Empire.\n\nMr Dowden backed Remain in the 2016 referendum but has not joined the group of awkward Tory MPs opposing Brexit.\n\nBut as a close ally of the Cameron project, his promotion will be a potential red flag to the Tory traditionalists and eurosceptic hardliners who have pushed Mr Johnson to power.\n\nBACKED: Promoted from within\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer: Sajid Javid\n\nVOTED REMAIN (BUT A BORN-AGAIN BREXITEER)\n\nA \"reluctant\" remainer in the referendum, Sajid Javid is a born-again Brexiteer and has been promoted to the second-highest job in government.\n\nMr Javid ran for the leadership himself before swinging behind Mr Johnson in his race to be Prime Minister.\n\nMulti-millionaire banker Sajid Javid was the first Home Secretary from an ethnic minority.\n\nThe son of a bus driver, he was elected MP for Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, in 2010 and was quickly identified a a rising star.\n\nThe former City banker sat on the work and Pensions Select Committee, then the powerful Public Accounts Committee.\n\nMr Javid, who comes from a Muslim background but does not practise any religion, was particularly close to Chancellor George Osborne and was appointed a Treasury Minister in September 2012.\n\nHe was elevated to the Cabinet as Culture Secretary in April of that year and became Business Secretary in May 2015 after the Tories' shock election outright victory.\n\nHe had a picture of Margaret Thatcher hanging on his wall at University.\n\nDefence Secretary: Ben Wallace\n\nVOTED REMAIN\n\nBen Wallace gets a promotion from Security Minister to the top job at the Ministry of Defence.\n\nHe's a married father of three and has been MP for Wyre and Preston North since May 2010.\n\nAccording to his website, his first job after leaving school at 18 was as a ski instructor in Austria.\n\nHe went on to enter Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst and was commissioned into the Scots Guards aged 20.\n\nHe's also worked in the Aerospace industry.\n\nIn his spare time, he enjoys rugby, skiing and horse racing.\n\nCabinet Office minister: Michael Gove\n\nVOTED LEAVE\n\nJohnson's former leadership rival - and the man who infamously torpedoed his last run at being Prime Minister - is back in the fold.\n\nHe'll be Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Cabinet Office minister.\n\nBut unlike his predecessor David Lidington, he won't be de facto Deputy PM. That job goes to Dominic Raab.\n\nIt'll be a welcome change of pace for the former journalist, who has spent the last few years at DEFRA banning things.\n\nInternational Trade Secretary: Liz Truss\n\nVOTED REMAIN (BUT NOW SAYS SHE WOULD BACK LEAVE)\n\nLiz Truss has been moved to replace Liam Fox at the Department of International Trade.\n\nShe's previously served as Environment Secretary, Justice Secretary and most recently Chief Secretary to the Treasury.\n\nConsidering her passion for opening new pork markets and for ensuring the success of British cheese, she'll fit right in at DIT.\n\nCommunities Secretary: Robert Jenrick\n\nPromoted from a junior Treasury role, Jenrick becomes the youngest member of Johnson Cabinet and one of the youngest in any Cabinet in recent years.\n\nHe was elected to Parliament in a 2014 by-election in Newark, Notts, triggered by the resignation of Patrick Mercer.\n\nJenrick edited his student newspaper at Cambridge, and went on to become a solicitor, advising businesses and financial institutions on corporate law in London and Moscow, before quitting the profession and moving into business, before switching again, this time into politics.\n\nHe has three young daughters with wife Michal.\n\nJustice Secretary: Robert Buckland\n\nVOTED REMAIN\n\nRobert Buckland has been promoted from Prisons Minister to Johnson's top man in the Ministry of Justice.\n\nBuckland is a qualified Barrister and one of the few Remainers left in the cabinet after today's cull.\n\nHe previously served as Solicitor General from 2014-2019.\n\nNorthern Ireland Secretary: Julian Smith\n\nVOTED REMAIN\n\nTheresa May's Chief Whip has been sent to possibly the least desirable job in the British Government.\n\nHe'll be in charge of restoring power sharing to Northern Ireland. And then there's the thorny question of finding a way to make the border work with neither a backstop or customs checkpoints.\n\nMinister without Portfolio and Conservative Party Chairman: James Cleverly\n\nVOTED LEAVE\n\nFormer Army reservist James Cleverly gets bumped up from junior Brexit minister to Party chairman.\n\nPrior to Theresa May's last reshuffle, he was a deputy Party chair. After briefly standing in the leadership election, he shelved his own ambitions and became a loyal backer of Johnson through the rest of the campaign.\n\nHome Office Minister: Brandon Lewis\n\nVOTED LEAVE\n\nBrandon Lewis gets a ministerial role after 18 months as Tory Chairman.\n\nHis tenure as Party chief started out fairly badly. He faced calls for his resignation after it emerged security holes in the Tory Conference app had exposed the private mobile phone numbers of several senior minister to the internet.\n\nBut it ended on a more positive note, having overseen a broadly successful leadership campaign.\n\nSACKED: Dumped from the Cabinet\n\nForeign Secretary: Jeremy Hunt\n\nIn the most eye-popping move of the day, Johnson's former leadership rival will be leaving Government entirely.\n\nJohnson sacked him as Foreign Secretary and he turned down another job.\n\nHe tweeted: \"I would have been honoured to carry on my work at the Foreign Office but understand the need for a new Prime Minister to choose his team.\n\n\"Boris Johnson kindly offered me another role but after nine years in Cabinet & over 300 cabinet meetings now is the time to return to the backbenches from where PM will have my full support.\n\n\"I've been a cabinet minister for every hour my three gorgeous children have been alive.\n\n\"So whilst it may seem strange for someone who just tried to become PM (& is a terrible cliche) I have decided now is the time for the biggest challenge of all - to be a GOOD DAD!\n\n\"It has been a huge honour to be responsible for the finest diplomatic service in the world & to see the courage & wisdom of our diplomats & intelligence services.\n\n\"Thanks for guiding me with such patience & professionalism! Proud to have stood up alongside you for British values.\n\n\"Also most importantly heartfelt thanks to the 1/3 of Conservative Party members who supported me. Despite being the outsider, the #HastobeHunt campaign was spirited & smart (if I do say so myself).\n\n\"I was truly humbled with the confidence placed in me by so many people.\"\n\nDefence Secretary and Women and Equalities Minister: Penny Mordaunt\n\nDefence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who was made the first woman to hold the office after Gavin Williamson was sacked by Theresa May, has announced she will be returning to the backbenches.\n\nShe said on Twitter: \"I’m heading to the backbenches from where the PM will have my full support, as will my successors at DefenceHQ & WomenEqualities.\n\n\"Thank you to everyone who’s helped me get things done, especially our Armed Forces and civilians in defence for the last 85 days. We achieved much.\"\n\nIt's currently unclear if she resigned or was sacked.\n\nInternational Trade Secretary: Liam Fox\n\nLiam Fox announced he would not be returning to Government, but he too failed to say whether it was by his choice or Johnson's.\n\nHe tweeted: \"Sadly, I will be leaving the Government. It has been a privilege to have served as Secretary of State for International Trade these past 3 years.\n\n\"I am proud to have worked with a tremendously talented team @tradegovuk to boost trade & investment and prepare for Brexit.\n\n\"The world-class trade department we have built leaves the UK uniquely well-positioned to forge our new trading relationships beyond Europe and create a truly Global Britain.\n\n\"But we must first undertake the momentous task of delivering on the instruction of the British people and leave the European Union. I look forward to supporting @BorisJohnson and the government from the backbenches.\"\n\nBusiness Secretary: Greg Clark\n\nGreg Clark more or less said he had been sacked in a statement issued on Twitter.\n\nHe wrote: \"I warmly congratulate Boris Johnson on becoming Prime Minister. He is right to appoint a new team for a new premiership and I wish him and them well for the vital work ahead.\n\n\"It has been an honour to serve the country as Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy for the last 3 years; and as Communities Secretary, Universities &amp; Science Minister, Cities Minister, Financial Secretary to the Treasury & Planning Minister.\n\n\"I am grateful for the support of outstanding civil servants, special advisors and ministerial colleagues during that time. I look forward to participating fully in the work of Parliament and continuing to serve the people of Tunbridge Wells.\"\n\nEducation Secretary: Damian Hinds\n\nEducation Secretary Damian Hinds has also departed from Boris Johnson's cabinet.\n\nHe said: \"It has been the greatest privilege to serve as Education Secretary. Thank you to the brilliant team at @educationgovuk. And thank you to everyone working in education and children's care, for all you do. I look forward to supporting the government from the backbenches.\"\n\nCommunities Secretary: James Brokenshire\n\nDespite backing Johnson in the leadership contest, James Brokenshire is out of the Cabinet.\n\nHis last act in office was to reinstate sacked 'philosopher' Roger Scruton to his government advisory role.\n\nNorthern Ireland Secretary: Karen Bradley\n\nKaren Bradley is reportedly out as Northern Ireland Secretary.\n\nShe'll perhaps be best remembered for admitting in public that she was profoundly ignorant of Northern Ireland's political divisions.\n\nIn an interview with the House Magazine, she said: \"I freely admit that when I started this job, I didn’t understand some of the deep-seated and deep-rooted issues that there are in Northern Ireland.\"\n\nScotland Secretary: David Mundell\n\nMundell says he was \"disappointed, but not surprised\" to be leaving the Scotland office.\n\nThat's him sacked then.\n\nHe tweeted: \"Disappointed but not surprised to be leaving the Scotland Office after 9 years.\n\n\"Will, of course, support the new Government, but as I said to PM this afternoon I will also hold him to account on his commitments to the Union.\n\n\"Hope there’s still room on the backbenches!\"\n\nDigital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary: Jeremy Wright\n\nMr Wright, who never really seemed comfortable at the \"ministry of fun\", is reportedly gone.\n\nOf course, we'll never know for sure, because the ex-Digital minister is still not on Twitter.\n\nImmigration Minister (attends cabinet): Caroline Nokes\n\nMs Nokes was reportedly sacked as Immigration Minister.\n\nHer tweet announcing the news of her departure contains some brutal shade: \"My successor as Immigration Minister undoubtedly has a massive challenge ahead.\"\n\nLeader of the House of Commons: Mel Stride\n\nMel Stride was Leader of the House for 61 days. Barely enough time to get comfortable before heading back to the Backbenches.\n\nHe wrote: \"Huge honour to have served as Lord President and Leader of the House. Looking forward to continuing to support my constituents and our PM from backbenches.\n\n\"Huge thanks to all who supported me so brilliantly during my 5 yrs in govt - in the whips office, HMT and in Leader’s Office\"\n\nNO CHANGE\n\nHealth Secretary: Matt Hancock\n\nVOTED REMAIN\n\nThe only Health Secretary ever to have his own app is staying in charge of the NHS.\n\nThe tech-obsessed MP, who once launched his own app, pulled out of the contest to replace Theresa May after he came sixth in the first round of MPs votes.\n\nThe geeky son of software developers voted Remain in the Brexit referendum but has since backed Brexit.\n\nHis achievements in government have been limited, with him finally settling the pay dispute with NHS staff negotiated by Jeremy Hunt his only real achievement.\n\nBut in one of Westminster's most precarious Cabinet jobs sometimes no news can be seen as good news.\n\nAt just 40-years-old the former economist, who worked for both George Osborne and the Bank of England, is seen by more moderate Tories as a potential future leader.\n\nIf he can survive unscathed, and untainted, by Boris Johnson's government.\n\nBrexit Secretary: Stephen Barclay\n\nVOTED LEAVE\n\nStephen Barclay has been rewarded for failing to secure a Brexit deal that MPs could back under Theresa May by being allowed to keep his job as Brexit Secretary.\n\nStephen Barclay was appointed by Theresa May after both previous holders of the job - David Davis and Dominic Raab - quit over her plans for Brexit .\n\nBarclay - who calls himself Steve - is the 46-year-old MP for North East Cambridgeshire.\n\nThe former Axa insurance lawyer and dad-of-two was born in 1972, the son of a union official and civil servant, and grew up with three brothers who all played rugby.\n\nWork and Pensions Secretary: Amber Rudd\n\nVOTED REMAIN\n\nAmber Rudd has been rewarded for her latter-day conversion to accepting no-deal Brexit as an option by being allowed to keep her job.\n\nShe's also been made Women and Equalities Minister, which was previously part of departing Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt's job.\n\nAfter backing the Remain campaign at the referendum, she said last week: \"The situation is that we are leaving at the end of October but it would be so much better to get a deal. What we really need is for everybody’s effort to go into trying to get a deal.\"\n\nWales Secretary: Alun Cairns\n\nAlun Cairns has been Secretary of State for Wales since March 2016, and Boris Johnson doesn't see why he should stop now.\n\nHe has run the London Marathon seven times. His personal best is 3h 28m 02s, making him the seventh fastest MP ever.\n\nCRACKED: Resigned from Cabinet\n\nDeputy PM: David Lidington\n\nTheresa May's deputy David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, announced he was stepping down - and suggested he'll now fight No Deal.\n\nThe ardently pro-EU MP said he was \"relishing\" the chance to \"campaign freely\" on issues close to his heart.\n\nHe wrote: \"After 20 yrs on the front bench it's the right moment to move on. I shall leave the govt when Theresa May offers her resignation to The Queen.\n\n\"I shall do all I can to help new govt secure a deal to allow an orderly departure from the EU.\n\n\"After more than two decades of collective responsibility I'm now relishing the prospect of speaking & campaigning freely for the things that matter to me & to my constituents.\"\n\nChancellor: Philip Hammond\n\nPhilip Hammond confirmed he was getting ready to quit ahead of Boris Johnson taking over as PM.\n\nThe Chancellor is vehemently opposed to crashing out of the UK without a deal.\n\nHe said he wouldn't wait to be sacked by Boris Johnson but rather planned to resign after Theresa May's last PMQs in place on Wednesday.\n\nIn his resignation letter (below) he said: \"I believe that your successor must be free to choose a Chancellor who is fully aligned with his policy position.\"\n\nJustice Secretary: David Gauke\n\nJustice Secretary David Gauke served in Theresa May's Cabinet since she took office in June 2016.\n\nHe was so famed for his cool manner that he used to get \"uncorked\" by more senior Tories to face difficult questions.\n\nBut he said he would not be able to serve under Boris Johnson. \"Given that I've been in the Cabinet since Theresa May came to power, I think the appropriate thing is for me to resign to her,\" he said.\n\nHe's now tipped to form a \"Gaukeward Squad\" on the backbenches fighting against a No Deal Brexit.\n\nInternational Development Secretary: Rory Stewart\n\nThe International Development Secretary announced during his brief run for the party leadership that he would not serve in a Boris Johnson government.\n\nHe said on Twitter : \"Because of our differences on Brexit and prorogation, I wouldn’t be able to serve in a Boris Johnson cabinet.\"\n\nAnd he confirmed it with a tweet congratulating Johnson on his victory, and saying he would be on the \"backbench tomorrow serving Cumbria.\"\n\nThe tweet was accompanied by a picture of Stewart with two horses.\n\nTransport Secretary: Chris Grayling\n\nChris Grayling was paradoxically both one of the worst ministers ever and also one of the longest serving ministers of recent years.\n\nIt's now been confirmed he will return to the backbenches.\n\nA source close to Chris Grayling has said he was not sacked, despite a litany of failures littering his career.\n\nThey said: \"Chris packed up and said goodbye to his private office this morning. He’d told Boris he didn’t want to continue when he backed him.\"\n\nJUNIOR MINISTERS: Changes below Cabinet level\n\nResigned\n\nAlan Duncan (Foreign Office)\n\nAnne Milton (Education)\n\nBACKROOM TEAM: Best (and worst) of the rest\n\nIN: Dominic Cummings\n\nBoris Johnson has hired the infamous former boss of the Vote Leave campaign to work as a senior advisor to him in government.\n\nMPs voiced their fury as Dominic Cummings returned to the top tier of British politics, just months after being found in contempt of Parliament.\n\nMr Cummings is an abrasive former special advisor to Michael Gove who took on \"the blob\" of the teaching profession.\n\nHe was then one of the architects of the official Vote Leave campaign, serving as its campaign director, during the EU referendum in 2016.\n\nHis famously bullish style was portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch in a TV drama on the infighting that plagued the Leave camp.\n\nHe is said to have been a mastermind behind Vote Leave's most controversial messages, including the bus that falsely claimed we send £350million a week to the EU and messages misleadingly claiming Turkey was joining the EU.\n\nHe branded Tory Brexiteers in the ERG \"useful idiots\", called top Tory David Davis \"thick as mince\", claimed some Tory Brexiteers spent the referendum \"chasing girls\" and other Brexiteer economists were \"charlatans\".\n\nIN: Andrew Griffiths\n\nIt's also emerged Johnson plans to make multi-millionaire Andrew Griffiths an advisor.\n\nGriffiths hit headlines last month after it emerged he had loaned Johnson his £9.5m Westminster townhouse to use as a campaign HQ.\n\nLabour ’s Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office Jon Trickett MP said: \"Before he is even appointed Prime Minister, one of Boris Johnson's first acts is to dish out a powerful job in Number 10 to his super-rich pal who lent him his luxurious house in Westminster for the Tory leadership campaign.\n\n“The public would be forgiven for coming to the conclusion that Johnson’s friends can buy influence within the new administration.\n\n\"It's blindingly obvious – Boris Johnson and his government will act only in the interest of the wealthy elite.\"\n\nOUT: Sir Mick Davis\n\nTory Party Treasurer and chief executive Sir Mick Davis said he was on the way out.\n\nIt comes after the millionaire was forced to dig deep into his own pockets to keep the party funded under Theresa May.\n\nHe said: \"I think that our new leader, Boris Johnson, should be free to choose a team at CCHQ who can work together to ensure that this organisation realises its central purpose – a clear and decisive victory at the next General Election.\""
