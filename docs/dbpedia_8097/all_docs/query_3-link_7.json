        "text": "Click on the pictures to read profiles of David Cameron's Conservative-Lib Dem coalition cabinet:\n\nPRIME MINISTER - DAVID CAMERON\n\nConservative David Cameron was virtually unknown outside Westminster when he was elected Tory leader in December 2005 at the age of 39.\n\nThe Old Etonian had dazzled that year's party conference with his youthful dynamism and charisma, reportedly telling journalists he was the \"heir to Blair\".\n\nHe has sought to match the former PM by putting the Conservatives at the centre ground of British politics.\n\nBefore becoming leader, he was the Conservatives' campaign co-ordinator at the 2005 general election and shadow education secretary.\n\nHe was special adviser to Home Secretary Michael Howard and Chancellor Norman Lamont in the 1990s before spending seven years as a public relations executive with commercial broadcaster Carlton.\n\nIn just five years, Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg, at 43 the same age as Mr Cameron, has gone from political obscurity to the absolute front line of British politics.\n\nAfter becoming MP for Sheffield Hallam at the 2005 election, he was promoted to Europe spokesman, before moving on to the home affairs role.\n\nWhen Sir Menzies Campbell resigned as leader in 2007, he entered the race to succeed him, in the end narrowly beating Chris Huhne.\n\nHe has campaigned against the government over civil liberties and opposed the Conservatives' spending cuts plans, attempting to create a distance between the Lib Dems and what he calls the \"old parties\".\n\nBut he really came to prominence during the televised debates ahead of the general elections, being judged in polls to have been the big winner of the first one.\n\nHowever, this appeared to do little to help the Lib Dems when they actually lost seats on 6 May. The party, though, retained enough MPs to become the vital players in the hung parliament.\n\nFOREIGN SECRETARY - WILLIAM HAGUE\n\nSince he returned to the shadow cabinet in 2005, Conservative William Hague has become a key adviser to David Cameron, and was seen as de facto deputy party leader.\n\nThe new foreign secretary has plenty of experience to call upon, having been Tory leader himself from 1997 to 2001 and shadow foreign secretary until the election.\n\nA witty and engaging Commons performer who is popular with grassroots Tory members, Mr Hague entered Parliament in 1989 having been special adviser to Chancellor Sir Geoffrey Howe. He was soon promoted to be a social security minister and in 1995 entered the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Wales.\n\nIn addition to his duties as shadow foreign secretary, Mr Cameron put Mr Hague in charge of rebuilding the party in the North of England, as chairman of its Northern Board.\n\nMr Hague has said that as foreign secretary, he is determined to put in place a \"distinctive British foreign policy\" and the situation in Afghanistan is a priority.\n\nMinister of State (Europe) - David Lidington (Conservative) Once a special adviser to Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and a parliamentary aide to William Hague, he is regarded as being less eurosceptic than those who occupied this important role when the Tories were in opposition\n\nMinister of State - Jeremy Browne (Liberal Democrat) A former Lib Dem press chief, he has been MP for Taunton since 2005. Was the party's deputy Treasury spokesman before the election.\n\nMinister of State - Lord Howell (Conservative)\n\nJunior Foreign Office minister - Henry Bellingham (Conservative)\n\nJunior Foreign Office minister - Alistair Burt (Conservative)\n\nCHANCELLOR - GEORGE OSBORNE\n\nOne of David Cameron's closest friends and Conservative allies, George Osborne rose rapidly after becoming MP for Tatton in 2001.\n\nMichael Howard promoted him from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury to shadow chancellor in May 2005, at the age of 34.\n\nMr Osborne took a key role in the election campaign and has been at the forefront of the debate on how to deal with the recession and the UK's spending deficit.\n\nEven before Mr Cameron became leader the two were being likened to Labour's Blair/Brown duo. The two have emulated them by becoming prime minister and chancellor, but will want to avoid the spats.\n\nBefore entering Parliament, he was a special adviser in the agriculture department when the Tories were in government and later served as political secretary to William Hague.\n\nThe BBC understands that as chancellor, Mr Osborne, along with the Treasury will retain responsibility for overseeing banks and financial regulation.\n\nMr Osborne said the coalition government was planning to change the tax system \"to make it fairer for people on low and middle incomes\", and undertake \"long-term structural reform\" of the banking sector, education and the welfare state.\n\nFinancial Secretary - Mark Hoban (Conservative) A chartered accountant, he first stood for Parliament in 1997 before being elected in 2001.\n\nExchequer Secretary - David Gauke (Conservative)\n\nCommercial Secretary - Sir James Sassoon (Conservative) Not an MP. To be given peerage\n\nHOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER FOR WOMEN AND EQUALITY - THERESA MAY\n\nTheresa May is the biggest winner so far in jobs allocated in the new cabinet, becoming only the second woman to hold the post of Home Secretary.\n\nShe was the first woman to become Conservative Party chairman, under the leadership of Iain Duncan Smith.\n\nShe then took up the culture and family portfolios before being made shadow Commons leader by David Cameron.\n\nShe has been a keen advocate of positive action to recruit more women Tories to winnable seats and was a key architect of the \"A list\" of preferred candidates.\n\nA passionate moderniser she famously ruffled feathers when she told Tory activists they were seen as members of the \"nasty party\".\n\nMs May was the shadow work and pensions minister ahead of the election.\n\nImmigration Minister - Damian Green (Conservative)\n\nThe 54-year-old rattled the previous government over immigration and sparked a cause celebre after being arrested by police investigating leaks - from his new government department.\n\nSecurity Minister - Baroness Pauline Neville-Jones (Conservative)\n\nThe baroness, 70, is a former governor of the BBC and was the first woman to chair the UK's Joint Intelligence Committee. She has extensive experience in foreign affairs and security.\n\nPolice Minister - Nick Herbert (Conservative)\n\nThe 47-year-old is a previous shadow justice minister. More recently, the MP for Arundel and South Downs held a shadow environmental brief. The role of police minister is held jointly with the Ministry of Justice.\n\nMinister For Equalities - Lynne Featherstone (Liberal Democrat) First elected to Parliament in 2005, the former Haringey councillor and London Assembly member served as youth and equalities spokesperson for her party before the election.\n\nParliamentary Under Secretary of State - James Brokenshire (Conservative) Was a shadow Home Office minister when the Conservatives were in opposition. MP for Bexley.\n\nDEFENCE SECRETARY - PHILIP HAMMOND\n\nPhilip Hammond has built up a reputation as an articulate and effective Commons performer since being elected MP for Runnymede and Weybridge in 1997.\n\nA former director of companies supplying medical equipment, he was initially a member of the Conservative shadow health team before going on to serve as trade and industry spokesman. He also backed Michael Portillo's 2001 leadership bid.\n\nIn summer 2002, he went to shadow the now defunct Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and local government department before being made shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, at the age of 51, in the July 2007 reshuffle.\n\nHe became Transport Secretary after David Cameron's coalition took power after the 2010 election, building on his reputation there as an effective performer before being shifted into the defence brief after the resignation of Liam Fox from the job in October 2011.\n\nArmed Forces Minister - Nick Harvey (Liberal Democrat)\n\nThe 48-year-old MP for North Devon was his party's shadow defence secretary from 2006.\n\nJunior Defence Minister - Gerald Howarth (Conservative)\n\nGerald Howarth was the shadow defence minister from 2002, with responsibility for procurement and the air force.\n\nJunior Defence Minister - Andrew Robathan (Conservative)\n\nLORD CHANCELLOR AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOR JUSTICE - KEN CLARKE\n\nMr Cameron has previously said that Mr Clarke was a \"big figure\" with \"great experience\". He was the last chancellor to lead the UK out of recession - during the John Major government of the 1990s.\n\nHis return to the Tory frontbench last year was seen as somewhat of a gamble for Mr Cameron given that Mr Clarke - who held a host of ministerial jobs in the Thatcher and Major governments - had staunchly pro-European views.\n\nThese views were widely seen to be the reason for his failure to win the three party leadership contests he entered - but Mr Cameron decided that Mr Clarke's experience was worth the risk of reopening party splits.\n\nMr Clarke was president of the union at Cambridge, became a QC in 1980 and after a succession of junior ministerial jobs he served as health, education and home secretaries before becoming chancellor from 1993 to 1997.\n\nMinister of State - Lord McNally (Liberal Democrat)\n\nTom McNally is the Lib Dem Leader in the House of Lords. A former senior Downing Street adviser, MP and founding member of the SDP, he entered the House of Lords in 1995.\n\nJunior Justice Minister - Crispin Blunt (Conservative)\n\nJunior Justice Minister - Jonathan Djanogly (Conservative)\n\nHEALTH SECRETARY - ANDREW LANSLEY\n\nAndrew Lansley, a former civil servant, became an active Conservative in the 1980s after a spell as private secretary to Norman Tebbit.\n\nIn 1990 he became head of the Conservative Research Department and was one of the architects of the Tories' surprise 1992 election victory. However, he later faced criticism for his central role in the disastrous 2001 poll campaign.\n\nHe returned to the shadow cabinet in 2003 under Michael Howard as shadow health secretary, the role he continues to hold under David Cameron.\n\nMr Cameron had long guaranteed Mr Lansley - who has played a key role in convincing people that the NHS is a high priority for the Conservatives - the role of health secretary in a government led by him.\n\nMinister of State - Paul Burstow (Liberal Democrat) Former Liberal Democrat chief whip, he is regarded as an expert on care for the elderly\n\nMinister of State - Simon Burns (Conservative)\n\nJunior Health Minister - Anne Milton (Conservative)\n\nJunior Health Minister - Earl Howe (Conservative) One of about ninety remaining hereditary peers in the House of Lords, the former banker held a number of ministerial positions in the Major government. He has been a shadow health spokesman since 1997\n\nEDUCATION SECRETARY - MICHAEL GOVE\n\nTory Michael Gove was seen as one of the brightest talents in the 2005 intake. The former Times journalist is a key member of David Cameron's inner circle who helps write many of his speeches.\n\nAs the Tories' housing spokesman, Mr Gove made a name for himself as an effective Commons performer in attacks on the government's home information packs.\n\nHe was drafted into the shadow cabinet, as children, schools and families spokesman, at the age of 39 when his leader split the education brief in two to reflect Gordon Brown's Whitehall changes.\n\nMr Gove headed the Policy Exchange think tank for three years before landing the safe seat of Surrey Heath.\n\nHe had previously said he was prepared to give up a post in the new Cabinet to ensure the deal with the Lib Dems went ahead, but he sticks with the education brief in government.\n\nSchools Minister - Nick Gibb (Conservative)\n\nBorn in 1960, Nick Gibb was a shadow education and skills minister under Michael Howard in 2001, and then from May 2005 was shadow education minister and shadow schools minister. He also has frontbench trade and treasury experience.\n\nMinister of State - Sarah Teather (Liberal Democrat)\n\nSarah Teather was Britain's youngest MP when she was elected to Parliament in a by-election in Brent East in September 2003. She was the Liberal Democrats' shadow housing minister before the election.\n\nJunior minister - Tim Loughton (Conservative)\n\nBorn in 1962, the former fund manager was most recently the shadow minister of children. He also has experience of environment and health policy. Recently lived with families on a council estate for a reality TV show.\n\nParliamentary Under Secretary of State - Jonathan Hill (Conservative)\n\nBUSINESS SECRETARY - VINCE CABLE\n\nVince Cable has had a long journey to reach the front rank of politics, having been a Labour and then an SDP supporter before its merger with the Liberals to become the Liberal Democrats.\n\nAn economist by profession, he entered Parliament as MP for Twickenham in 1997 and has gradually built up his powerbase among the Lib Dems.\n\nAs the party's deputy leader and Treasury spokesman he saw his stock rising during the credit crunch because of his earlier warnings.\n\nWhen he stood in as temporary leader after the resignation of Sir Menzies Campbell, he memorably described Gordon Brown as going from \"Stalin to Mr Bean\".\n\nHe is also expected to be a member of a new ministerial committee which is dedicated to creating banking policy, and chaired by the chancellor.\n\nMinister of State - Mark Prisk (Conservative)\n\nMinister of State - John Hayes (Conservative)\n\nJunior Minister - Edward Davey (Liberal Democrat) Was the party's foreign affairs spokesman in opposition\n\nJunior Minister - Ed Vaizey (Conservative)\n\nJunior Minister - Baroness Wilcox (Conservative)\n\nWORK AND PENSIONS - IAIN DUNCAN SMITH\n\nThis is a return to the front line for former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, the MP for Chingford and Woodford Green.\n\nA former army officer, who saw active service in Northern Ireland, Mr Duncan Smith entered Parliament in 1992 and rapidly established himself as one of the Maastricht rebels that life so difficult for then Tory leader John Major.\n\nHe was seen as a rising star of the Eurosceptic right and, after a spell as shadow defence secretary under William Hague, was the surprise victor in the September 2001 leadership contest, beating better-known and more experienced, Europhile candidate Ken Clarke.\n\nHe had a torrid time as the Tory leader, failing to land any real blows on then PM Tony Blair and enduring a relentless barrage of criticism from the press and, in some cases, his own MPs.\n\nIn November 2002, he urged his party to \"unite or die\" in response to persistent whisperings of a challenge to his leadership, but a year later he was ousted after narrowly failing to win the backing of enough MPs in a vote of confidence.\n\nAfter losing the Tory leadership, he has successfully reinvented himself as a social reform champion who, with his centre-right think tank Centre for Social Justice, has played an influential role in developing Conservative policy on welfare and the \"broken society\".\n\nMinister of State - Chris Grayling (Conservative) The former shadow home secretary and MP for Epsom and Ewell, 48, was denied a Cabinet role. Earlier this year he was secretly recorded suggesting people who run B&Bs in their homes should have the right to reject homosexual guests.\n\nMinister of State - Steve Webb (Liberal Democrat) Elected to Parliament in 1997, the former professor of social policy at Bath University has held a number of frontbench positions. An expert on pensions, he is regarded as being on the left of the party.\n\nMinister for Welfare Reform - Lord Freud (Conservative) Welfare expert who advised Labour on reform of the benefits system but them switched sides and start working with the Conservatives. Was ennobled in 2009.\n\nJunior Minister - Maria Miller (Conservative) Was shadow families minister in opposition\n\nJunior Minister - Lord Freud\n\nENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE - CHRIS HUHNE\n\nChris Huhne has become Energy and Climate Change Secretary.
