        "text": "A FORMER special adviser from Co Armagh who was James Brokenshire's ministerial aide has spoken of his devastation at losing the \"best boss I will ever have\".\n\nPeter Cardwell from Richhill was appointed by ex-Prime Minister Theresa May to advise Mr Brokenshire when he took over the role as secretary of state from 2016 to 2018.\n\nHe was later Mr Brokenshire's special adviser again when he became Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government.\n\nSpeaking after Mr Brokenshire's death was announced yeterday, Mr Cardwell said he was a \"decent and very caring person\".\n\n\"James was the best of politicians, the best of humanity and the best of friends to me,\" he said.\n\n\"He was very diligent in his job, he took his work incredibly seriously. He combined integrity, humanity, diligence and fun. But not only that, he was a decent, very caring person and one of my best friends.\n\n\"Just three weeks ago we danced around his kitchen to Nicki Minaj and he was still the same James. He was the best boss I will ever have.\"\n\nMr Cardwell, a public speaker and political commentator who has worked as special adviser to four cabinet ministers, said Mr Brokenshire was committed to his role in Northern Ireland.\n\n\"He obviously had a tough time at the Northern Ireland Office, but he was so committed, often back and forth six times a week,\" he said.\n\n\"But he really loved Northern Ireland, even after he left he brought his family back on holidays there and he had real allegiance to the place.\n\n\"He was always saying to people they should visit and really stood up for the people of Northern Ireland.\""
