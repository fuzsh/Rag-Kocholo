        "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has praised former Tory minister James Brokenshire as “the nicest, kindest and most unassuming of politicians” after he died from lung cancer.\n\nThe MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup, who was 53-years-old, had announced in July he was resigning as Minister of State for Security at the Home Office because his recovery was “taking longer than anticipated”.\n\nMr Brokenshire’s family said he died peacefully in hospital on Thursday, with his loved ones at his bedside. He had been admitted on Sunday after his condition “rapidly deteriorated”.\n\n“It is with deep sadness that we announce the death of James Brokenshire MP at the age of 53,” a family statement said.\n\n“James died peacefully at Darent Valley Hospital yesterday evening with family members by his bedside. He had been in hospital since Sunday after his condition rapidly deteriorated.\n\n“James was not only a brilliant Government minister as both Security and Immigration Minister at the Home Office and Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office and Ministry for Housing, Communities & Local Government, but a dedicated constituency MP, first for Hornchurch from 2005 to 2010, and then for Old Bexley & Sidcup for the past 11 years.\n\n“But most importantly, he was a loving father to his three children, a devoted husband to Cathy and a faithful friend to so many.\n\n“We would like to thank all the NHS staff, particularly those at Guy’s & St Thomas’ in London, who cared for James with such warmth, diligence and professionalism over the past three-and-a-half years.\n\n“We would also ask that our privacy as a family is respected at this time.”\n\nThe father-of-three, who had held the roles of both Northern Ireland Secretary and Communities Secretary through his 16-year career as a parliamentarian, had been unwell since being diagnosed with recurring lung tumours in January.\n\nHe underwent surgery in February to remove his right lung and then began several courses of chemotherapy, tweeting at the start of June that he had completed chemo and was “recovering steadily”.\n\nIn July, when he announced he was stepping down from ministerial responsibilities, he said his “recovery from treatment and return to full duties is taking longer than anticipated” and wanted to “focus on restoring my health”.\n\nFollowing news of his death, his colleagues praised Mr Brokenshire for his decency and professionalism as an MP, minister and Secretary of State.\n\nMr Johnson tweeted: “Desperately sad to hear the news about James Brokenshire.\n\n“James was the nicest, kindest and most unassuming of politicians but also extraordinarily effective. He served with particular distinction in the Home Office and as Security Minister.\n\n“If the government needed something done well and speedily – and sensibly explained – James was the man to do it.\n\n“I worked with him for many years in London and I know how much he cared for the interests of his Bexley constituents.\n\n“His fight against cancer was heroic, and it is a measure of his resolve that he came back from a first bout with the disease to serve in government again. He will be missed by all who knew him. Our thoughts are with Cathy and his family.”\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak described him as “a man of public service and the highest integrity”.\n\nHe said: “He was a valued friend and colleague and will be deeply missed. My thoughts are with his family on this incredibly sad day.”\n\nFormer prime minister David Cameron, who first appointed Mr Brokenshire to a Home Office role, said: “Devastated to hear the heartbreaking news that James Brokenshire has died, well before his time.\n\n“He was a hard working and dedicated MP but, more than that, he was a thoroughly decent and lovely man, and devoted to his family. My thoughts and prayers are with them all today.”\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: “James Brokenshire was a thoroughly decent man, dedicated and effective in all briefs he held. He fought his illness with dignity and bravery.\n\n“I’m incredibly sad to learn of his death and send my condolences to his wife and children.”"
