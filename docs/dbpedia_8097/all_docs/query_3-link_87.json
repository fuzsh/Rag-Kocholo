        "text": "Britain's past five prime ministers today led tributes to Britain's former top civil servant Sir Jeremy Heywood who died aged 56 just ten days after retiring from No 10 - calling him 'the greatest public servant of our time'.\n\nThe former Cabinet Secretary lost his battle with cancer last November and was remembered at a memorial service attended by 2,000 mourners at Westminster Abbey this afternoon.\n\nMrs May, who said he worked tirelessly' in the service of the country including trying to deliver Brexit, arrived with Sir John Major and sat next to David Cameron, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown in the church.\n\nShe told the memorial service: 'The legend of Britain's Civil Service should no longer be the fictional story of Sir Humphrey but rather the true story of Sir Jeremy, the greatest public servant of our time.\n\n'He was not just an extraordinary adviser but an extraordinary doer. Nothing stopped him until he found a solution. Whatever the issue was, Jeremy always sorted it and time and time again'.\n\nSir Jeremy also worked for Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, who were also at the memorial service with their wives Cherie and Sarah.\n\nMr Blair told the congregation: 'He was calm in crisis, his fellow staff adored him and I depended on him and when he was gone I felt his absence like an ache'.\n\nHis successor Gordon Brown said: 'I know of no public servant who achieved more in such a short time', adding to howls of laughter: 'In May 2010 I left a handwritten note to David Cameron saying something like 'The country is in good hands, Jeremy is running it'.'\n\nMr Cameron said Lord Heywood, who helped him broker the coalition deal the Lib Dems in 2010, had a 'deep, moral sense of right and wrong' and was a man of 'genuine ability, talent and brain. We were so lucky to have him'.\n\nAnd Sir John Major, whose administration put Sir Jeremy in the Treasury to help Chancellor Norman Lamont fight back after Black Wednesday in 1992, said: 'Jeremy was a dedicated public servant who served with professionalism, dignity and grace'.\n\nEx-chancellor George Osborne and a number of Theresa May's serving ministers including Matt Hancock, James Brokenshire and Amber Rudd.\n\nLeading Labour figures from the Blair/Brown era including Ed and David Miliband, Jack Straw, Ed Balls and Alastair Campbell were also at the abbey.\n\nLord Heywood is survived by his wife of 22 years Suzanne and three children, including twins. Mrs Heywood said after his death that her husband, calling him: 'My Jeremy'.\n\nShe said: 'Jeremy could light up any room or conversation and loved hosting a good party.'\n\nAddressing the congregation, his widow highlighted that, despite the demands of his job, her husband had the ability to be 'completely present when he was with us despite the many challenges of his working life'.\n\nDuring the hour-long service, Welsh singer Cerys Matthews sang Bob Dylan's Don't Think Twice, It's All Right, and the Abbey's bells were rung at the end of the memorial event.\n\nLord Heywood revealed in the year he died that he had been diagnosed with cancer in June 2017, but remained in post during a summer of political upheaval triggered by the shock snap general election called by Theresa May.\n\nHe took a leave of absence in June and announced on October 24 that he was stepping down, with acting Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill taking over the role on a permanent basis.\n\nTen days after leaving No 10 for the last time he died.\n\nSir Mark Sedwill had said 'we will miss him more than we can say', praising Lord Heywood's 'extraordinary insight'.\n\nThe Cabinet Secretary is the post powerful post in the Civil Service and crucial adviser at the right hand of the Prime Minister. Lord Heywood was made Cabinet Secretary in 2012 and made head of the Civil Service in 2014.\n\nMr Heywood previously served as principal private secretary to prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, chief of staff to Mr Brown and Downing Street permanent secretary to David Cameron.\n\nEarlier in his career he had worked for Tory Chancellor Norman Lamont and helped to ease the impact of Black Wednesday in 1992.\n\nPrime Ministers of both major parties found him invaluable and Gordon Brown brought him back to Whitehall after he had temporarily left the civil service to work in the City.\n\nHe was made a member of the House of Lords on October 26, two days after his retirement, and made Lord Heywood of Whitehall.\n\nDuring an illustrious 30-year career at the heart of power, Lord Heywood played a crucial role in the formation of Britain's first coalition government in decades after the 2010 election, overseeing talks between David Cameron and Nick Clegg.\n\nHe worked closely with four Prime Ministers and sat at the right hand of both David Cameron and Theresa May as the Cabinet Secretary.\n\nLord Heywood was at times a controversial figure during his tenure and branded 'Sir Cover Up' by critics furious at his handling of Parliamentary inquires.\n\nHe has been unpopular with Brexiteers suspicious the Civil Service is not committed to delivering on the EU referendum result."
