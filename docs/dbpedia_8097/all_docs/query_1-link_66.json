        "text": "LONDON — Theresa May will be the new U.K. prime minister by Wednesday evening, David Cameron confirmed Monday.\n\nCameron said he would chair his last cabinet meeting on Tuesday, and on Wednesday take part in his last Prime Minister’s Questions in the House of Commons.\n\n“After that I expect to go to [Buckingham] Palace and offer my resignation, so we’ll have a new prime minister in that building behind me by Wednesday evening,” he said, indicating the prime minister’s residence at Number 10 Downing Street.\n\nIn a short statement, Cameron said Andrea Leadsom had made “absolutely the right decision to stand aside” in the Tory leadership contest, adding that May had the “overwhelming support” of the parliamentary party.\n\nHe said May, the home secretary, was “strong,” “competent” and that “she will have my full support.”\n\nOne of May’s first jobs will be a Cabinet reshuffle. Senior figures that have supported her leadership, including Chris Grayling, Liam Fox, David Davis, Priti Patel, James Brokenshire and Brandon Lewis, are in line for promotions into the Cabinet. May is also expected to give roles to key leadership backers Karen Bradley, Gavin Williamson, Simon Kirby and George Hollingbery.\n\nLong-standing chancellor George Osborne is expected to be replaced at the Treasury following May’s stark criticism of his record in a speech Monday morning.\n\nLeadsom quit the Tory leadership race after being left devastated by the fallout from an interview she gave to the Times newspaper over the weekend in which she suggested having children gave her an advantage over May. She also admitted that her teenage daughter had been less sure of her leadership bid than her older sons.\n\nLeadsom began the leadership contest as a rank outsider before Michael Gove threw his hat into the ring, derailing Boris Johnson’s ambitions. After Johnson pulled out of the contest, Gove was knocked out after failing to win enough support from MPs.\n\nIn the final round of voting Thursday, May won the support of 199 Tory MPs to Leadsom’s 84.\n\nIn her announcement Monday Leadsom said she did not think she had enough support among Tory MPs to run a stable government. She said new leadership was needed “urgently” to begin the work of pulling out of the European Union. “A nine-week leadership campaign at such a critical moment for our country is highly undesirable,” she said.\n\n“Theresa May carries over 60 percent of the support from the parliamentary party. She is ideally placed to implement Brexit on the best possible terms for the British people and she has promised that she will do so.”\n\n“For me personally, to have won the support of 84 colleagues last Thursday was a great expression of confidence to which I am incredibly grateful. Nevertheless, this is less than 25 percent of the parliamentary party and after careful consideration, I don’t believe this is sufficient support to lead a strong and stable government, should I win the leadership election.”\n\nLeadsom said that the interests of the country were best served “by the immediate appointment of a strong and well-supported prime minister.”\n\nHer announcement casts the Tories in stark contrast to the Labour Party, whose leader Jeremy Corbyn is facing a leadership challenge after losing the support of 80 percent of his MPs. Corbyn, however, has refused to stand down."
