        "text": "Hours after assuming her role as the new U.K. Prime Minister on Wednesday, Theresa May unveiled key figures in her new cabinet.\n\nThe key figures on her top team include Philip Hammond as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Amber Rudd as Home Secretary, and in a controversial move, Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary.\n\nLiam Fox returns to government as head of a new Department for International Trade while the newly created role of ‘Brexit minister,’ officially known as the Secretary of State for European Union Relations, will be filled by David Davis. George Osborne and Michael Gove are among those who have lost their frontbench jobs.\n\nThe second-female prime minister in Britain’s history is also expected to balance her cabinet with more female members of parliament (MPs) in senior positions. Till those announcements are made, here’s what we know about her top team:\n\nPhilip Hammond, Chancellor of the Exchequer\n\nThe former Foreign Secretary and long-time ally of May will take the position traditionally seen as second in command. He is seen as a safe pair of hands who will guide the country’s economy through the uncertainty sparked by the Brexit vote. The 60-year-old, who has been an MP since 1997, has handled complex ministerial briefs first as Transport Minister in the 2010 coalition government before becoming Secretary of State for Defence in 2011 and finally Foreign Secretary in 2014. In contrast to what outgoing Chancellor George Osborne said before the EU referendum, Hammond told the BBC on Thursday that there would be no emergency budget to address the vote’s economic aftershocks. Osborne had warned during the campaign that Brexit would trigger tax rises and budget cuts.\n\nAmber Rudd, Home Secretary\n\nRudd, who was a prominent Remain campaigner and protegé of Osborne, has taken over May’s former role where she will oversee Britain’s counter-terrorism efforts, immigration and the police. At 52, Rudd becomes the most senior woman in government after May but joined the Cabinet only last year as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change. The former investment banker, financial journalist and venture capitalist is a relative newcomer to politics having only become an MP in 2010.\n\nBoris Johnson, Foreign Secretary\n\nThe former Mayor of London, who had never held a cabinet position prior to his Wednesday appointment, was the leading campaigner for Britain to leave the E.U. The newspaper columnist and former Brussels correspondent, who has a history of diplomatic gaffes, began the initial stages of the Conservative Party leadership bid before dropping out unexpectedly when his ally Gove challenged him for the job. The New York-born Johnson studied at the prestigious all-boys boarding school Eton College before studying classics at Oxford University. He worked as a journalist for the London Times, the Telegraph and The Spectator, becoming an MP in 1999 and going on to become Mayor of London in 2008.\n\nDavid Davis, Secretary of State for European Union Relations\n\nThis long-standing Euroskeptic will take up a new role already nicknamed “Brexit minister.” Davis, 67, once attempted to win the Conservative Party leadership in 2005—where he came in second to May’s predecessor David Cameron. He served as Foreign Office minister under John Major in 1994 followed by a number of shadow roles while Labour was in power from 1997 to 2010. He has been called an untraditional Conservative, having being brought up by a single mother on a council estate in London, and has clashed with May in past over her proposed surveillance legislation. He has a master’s degree from Harvard University, and from a recent article written in Conservative Home, it is suggested he will seek to keep Britain’s access to the single market.\n\nLiam Fox, International Trade Secretary\n\nThe prominent Euroskeptic’s new mandate will be to secure new trade deals with the world, which the Leave campaign touted as a benefit to leaving the E.U. Fox, 54,who worked as a doctor before becoming an MP in 1992, has made two stabs as the role of leader of the Conservative Party: the first in 2005 against former Prime Minister David Cameron and the second, against May at the end of June. He resigned from his previous cabinet position as defence secretary in 2011 and voted against same-sex marriage in 2013. Fox was mentioned in the sleeve of the debut album of Natalia Imbruglia.\n\nElizabeth Truss, Justice Minister and Lord Chancellor\n\nThe former Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs takes up Gove’s former role as Justice Minister. Truss, usually known as ‘Liz,’ is also the first woman to become Lord Chancellor. Truss, 40, became a MP in 2010, when she was elected to her South West Norfolk seat. The qualified management consultant co-authored a 2012 booklet entitled Britannia Unchained that argued for more deregulation and alleged “the British are among the worst idlers in the world.” Unlike many of her cabinet colleagues Truss campaigned for Britain to remain in the E.U., arguing that the E.U. was responsible for major global environmental breakthroughs such as the reduction of acid rain and reducing the hole in the ozone layer.\n\nJustine Greening – Education Secretary and Minister for Women and Equalities The former international secretary became the first openly gay cabinet minister when she revealed in June that she is in a same-sex relationship. Born in the South Yorkshire town of Rotherham, the 47-year-old is also one of the few education secretaries to have attended a state school — or a public school, in the U.S. — without a selection criteria for students. The former accountant and finance manager was first elected as a Conservative Party MP in 2005, and went on to gain five years of cabinet experience under the 2010 coalition government. She too campaigned to remain within the E.U, and said after coming out: “I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you’re better off out.”\n\nMichael Fallon, Defence Minister\n\nFallon stays in his role of Defence Minister. The ally of Cameron and Osborne became an MP in 1983, and has had stints as business minister and energy minister. He was also forced to apologize to London Mayor Sadiq Khan after alleging Khan associated with a Muslim cleric who supported ISIS—a claim that was not true. The former director of gym chain, Bannatyne Fitness, is seen as a steady hand in government and gave May his backing during her leadership bid.\n\nPatrick McLoughlin, Party Chairman The long-serving transport secretary, who was Cameron’s chief whip, has taken the role of Conservative Party Chairman. This means the 57-year-old is now responsible for the Cabinet Office, which is responsible for supporting the Prime Minister and her cabinet.Gavin Williamson, Chief Whip The 40-year-old was Cameron’s former parliamentary private secretary and campaign manager for May’s Conservative leadership bid. His promotion to chief whip, who is concerned with the discipline of the Conservative Party members, is considered a big step-up for Williamson.\n\nJeremy Hunt, Health Secretary\n\nHunt stays on in his role as Health Secretary— his department is currently in a standoff with junior doctors, who are striking over recent attempts to impose a new contract on them. Hunt is a contemporary of Johnson and Cameron from Oxford University. It was mistakenly reported on Thursday morning that he lost his job, and Hunt did not shy away from pointing out the error:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Jeremy_Hunt/status/753560479658901504\n\nChris Grayling, Transport Secretary The 54-year-old’s latest role is seen as sideways move, not a promotion. As Justice Secretary, the Euroskeptic’s attempts at prisoner and court reform were criticized and largely done away with by successor Gove. Grayling also had roles as the employment minister and leader of the House of Commons. He was a television producer and management consultant prior to becoming an MP in 2001. He is seen as an adept political survivor who has shaken off a series of political controversies."
