        "text": "The prime minister confirmed this morning (30 April) that Javid has been promoted to home secretary after Amber Rudd quit the post after conceding she had ‘inadvertently misled’ MPs over what she knew about deportation targets.\n\nFormer Northern Ireland secretary Brokenshire will now replace Javid at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG), formerly the DCLG. He becomes the fourth secretary of state responsible for housing in the last three years, following on from Javid, Greg Clark and Eric Pickles.\n\nFollowing the announcement, Brokenshire tweeted that he was ‘honoured’, adding: ‘Looking forward to taking the government’s agenda forward, especially on building the homes our country needs.’\n\nThe MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup resigned from his government role in January to receive treatment to remove a tumour on his lung. The operation was successful and he has been recovering well.\n\nBritish Property Federation chief executive Melanie Leech welcomed Brokenshire’s appointment.\n\n‘While it is disappointing to lose Sajid Javid from housing, we welcome James Brokenshire and look forward to working with him to drive forward the government’s multi-tenure approach to new housing delivery and the policy changes to the National Planning Policy Framework,’ she said.\n\nBut Assael Architecture director Russell Pedley expressed disappointment at yet another change at the ministry. ‘The point of changing the DCLG to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government was to highlight the major issues we have within the housing market at the moment,’ he said. ‘However, the government’s actions here show that, once again, other departments take a priority over housing.\n\n‘If we are serious about fixing the broken housing market, delivering affordable homes at high volume and transforming the outdated delivery model, then we need consistent leadership at the top.’\n\nThe reshuffle also sees international development secretary Penny Mordaunt take on the additional role of minister for equalities, which Rudd had also held until today."
