        "text": "Conservative MP and former Northern Ireland secretary James Brokenshire has died at the age of 53, his family said in a statement.\n\nThe former Home Office minister had taken leave from his ministerial duties earlier this year after suffering from a second bout of lung cancer.\n\nHis family said on Friday that “James died peacefully at Darrant Valley Hospital yesterday evening with family members by his bedside”.\n\nThey paid tribute to his work as a “brilliant government minister” and a “dedicated constituency MP”, but also as a “loving father to his three children, a devoted husband to Cathy and a faithful friend to so many”.\n\nThey added that Brokenshire had been in hospital since Sunday “after his condition rapidly deteriorated” and thanked all the NHS staff who cared for him “with such warmth, diligence and professionalism over the past three-and-a-half years.”\n\nBoris Johnson led tributes to the Conservative MP, saying: “Desperately sad to hear the news about James Brokenshire.\n\n“James was the nicest, kindest and most unassuming of politicians but also extraordinarily effective.”\n\nMr Johnson added that “if the government needed something done well and speedily – and sensibly explained – James was the man to do it”.\n\nHe called Mr Brokenshire’s fight against cancer “heroic” and added that “he will be missed by all who knew him”.\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak remembered James Brokenshire as “a man of public service and the highest integrity”, in a social media post on Friday. He said: “He was a valued friend and colleague and will be deeply missed.”\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer paid tribute to Mr Brokenshire, saying he was “a thoroughly decent man, dedicated and effective in all briefs he held”.\n\nDeputy leader Angela Rayner said Mr Brokenshire had “been taken far too young” and said he was “unfailingly professional and kind”.\n\nTransport secretary Grant Shapps described Mr Brokenshire as “quite simply the nicest man in politics. A true gentleman”.\n\nThe father-of-three had initially been diagnosed with lung cancer in 2018 and, after receiving successful treatment, he was appointed by Boris Johnson to the Home Office in February 2020.\n\nHowever Mr Brokenshire was forced to step back from his government role in January after learning that his cancer had returned.\n\nHe disclosed in August that his recovery from his illness was taking longer than anticipated. Posting an update on social media on 31 August, he said: “Regrettably my cancer has progressed. Am starting a new line of treatment this week. Unwelcome news but keeping upbeat.”\n\nHe was first elected to parliament in 2005 as MP for the former constituency of Hornchurch. Before his death, he was Conservative MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup.\n\nHe went on to serve as secretary of state for Northern Ireland and for communities and local government under Theresa May and held a number of junior ministerial positions under Mr Johnson and David Cameron.\n\nSpeaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, remembered Mr Brokenshire’s “positivity and good sense of humour” in a statement issued on Friday.\n\nHe added: “He was a politician who commanded affection and respect from colleagues, no matter which party they represented.”\n\nChair of the Old Bexley and Sidcup Conservative Association, Evelyn Morrison, who worked with Mr Brokenshire for 12 years, said: “I’ve very devastated. A wonderful, wonderful MP. Lots of integrity. He worked so closely with us.”\n\nFormer prime ministers also expressed their condolences at their ex-minister’s death.\n\nMr Cameron said he was “devastated to hear the heartbreaking news that James Brokenshire has died, well before his time”, and Theresa May called him “an outstanding public servant, a talented minister and a loyal friend.”\n\nFormer first minister for Northern Ireland Arlene Foster described him as “gracious” and said she was “really shocked” that he had fallen ill so quickly.\n\nThe Teenage Cancer Trust said that “James was incredibly open about his diagnosis and treatment journey and used his platform to educate and inspire”."
