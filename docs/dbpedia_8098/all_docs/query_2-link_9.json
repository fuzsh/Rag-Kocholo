We have published a new blog article regarding Chinese pharmaceutical innovations. https://lnkd.in/gDXDeFeW According to the news “中国製薬、日本でもじわり存在感 | AnswersNews (ten-navi.com)” released by AnswersNews on 22/Sep/2023, Chinese pharmaceutical innovations are gaining prominence in Japan. In 2021, the anti-cancer drug “Hiyasta” developed in China was approved in Japan. In September 2023, Shanghai-based biotech firm, Haihe Biopharma, applied for gumarontinib in Japan. Takeda Pharmaceutical Company acquired the development and sales rights for the VEGFR inhibitor drug, fruquintinib, from Hong Kong’s HUTCHMED, aiming for obtaining approvals in Japan, the US, and Europe. Chinese pharmaceutical industry is rapidly growing in new drug development. In 2019, BeiGene’s BTK inhibitor, “Brukinsa”, became the first China-developed drug to gain approval in the US, and it is now approved in over 65 countries. The Chinese government strategy called “Made in China 2025” which was initiated in 2015, prioritized the biopharmaceutical sector and promoted innovation in new drug development. As of 2023, the Chinese pharmaceutical market ranks second globally, and four Chinese companies are listed in the top 50 global pharmaceutical companies. Among these companies, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals has marked its footprint in Japan, becoming the first Chinese company to initiate pharmaceutical sales there. Japanese pharmaceutical companies are also actively adopting Chinese innovations. Following Takeda’s agreement with HUTCHMED. EA Pharma has initiated joint research with Nanjing-based TransThera Sciences. In summary, Chinese pharmaceutical innovation is increasing its presence in Japan, and Japanese pharmaceutical companies are intensifying their efforts to incorporate Chinese innovations.\n\nBD plans to surf GLP-1 wave to a $1B drug delivery business by 2030 As the market for GLP-1 injections continues to grow, BD aims to ride that wave by providing drugmakers with its prefilled syringes. Biologic medications—including those blockbusters for diabetes and weight-loss—now account for more than 40% of the company’s total pharmaceutical systems revenue, CEO Tom Polen said on BD’s quarterly earnings call with investors. “Since 2023, BD has been the chosen partner for 19 out of the 23 new biologic drug approvals that use a prefilled syringe,” Polen added. “Second, as we consider the significant clinical potentials of GLP-1s, the strength of BD's innovation in this category, and our previously announced capacity expansion—we view GLP-1 drug delivery as a potential $1 billion product category by 2030.” That includes working with companies on both sides of a molecule. BD has contracts covering novel GLP-1s that are currently making their way through clinical trials, as well as more than 40 agreements for biosimilars, spanning pens, auto-injectors and syringes—including competitors for early-generation GLP-1s that are slated to enter the market within the next year. https://lnkd.in/eWksakCA\n\nPharmaceutical Drug Delivery Market to Worth $2,206.5 billion by 2026 ►𝗗𝗼𝘄𝗻𝗹𝗼𝗮𝗱 𝗣𝗗𝗙 𝗕𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗵𝘂𝗿𝗲-https://lnkd.in/gMTySA2t The global pharmaceutical drug delivery market in terms of revenue was estimated to be worth $1,656.9 billion in 2021 and is poised to reach $2,206.5 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 5.9% from 2021 to 2026.
