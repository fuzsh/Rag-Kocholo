        "text": "Simcere Pharmaceutical Group Limited's ( ) price-to-earnings (or \"P/E\") ratio of 17.5x might make it look like a strong sell right now compared to the market in Hong Kong, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 9x and even P/E's below 5x are quite common. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.\n\nSimcere Pharmaceutical Group could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.\n\nWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our will help you uncover what's on the horizon.\n\nDoes Growth Match The High P/E?\n\nThe only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Simcere Pharmaceutical Group's is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.\n\nTaking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 23%. Unfortunately, that's brought it right back to where it started three years ago with EPS growth being virtually non-existent overall during that time. So it appears to us that the company has had a mixed result in terms of growing earnings over that time.\n\nLooking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 28% per year during the coming three years according to the six analysts following the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 15% per year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.\n\nIn light of this, it's understandable that Simcere Pharmaceutical Group's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Simcere Pharmaceutical Group's P/E\n\nWhile the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.\n\nWe've established that Simcere Pharmaceutical Group maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.\n\nPlus, you should also learn about this .\n\nIf you're unsure about the strength of Simcere Pharmaceutical Group's business, why not explore for some other companies you may have missed.\n\nHave feedback on this article?
