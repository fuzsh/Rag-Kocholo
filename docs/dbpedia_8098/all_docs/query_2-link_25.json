        "text": "Simcere Pharmaceutical Group (HKG:2096) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 21% over the last three months. Given that stock prices are usually aligned with a company's financial performance in the long-term, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely to see if they had a hand to play in the recent price move. In this article, we decided to focus on Simcere Pharmaceutical Group's ROE.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Simcere Pharmaceutical Group\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Simcere Pharmaceutical Group is:\n\n9.9% = CN¥714m ÷ CN¥7.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every HK$1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated HK$0.10 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nSimcere Pharmaceutical Group's Earnings Growth And 9.9% ROE\n\nWhen you first look at it, Simcere Pharmaceutical Group's ROE doesn't look that attractive. However, its ROE is similar to the industry average of 12%, so we won't completely dismiss the company. Moreover, we are quite pleased to see that Simcere Pharmaceutical Group's net income grew significantly at a rate of 20% over the last five years. Given the slightly low ROE, it is likely that there could be some other aspects that are driving this growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Simcere Pharmaceutical Group's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 5.9%.\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Simcere Pharmaceutical Group's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.\n\nIs Simcere Pharmaceutical Group Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nThe three-year median payout ratio for Simcere Pharmaceutical Group is 36%, which is moderately low. The company is retaining the remaining 64%. By the looks of it, the dividend is well covered and Simcere Pharmaceutical Group is reinvesting its profits efficiently as evidenced by its exceptional growth which we discussed above.\n\nMoreover, Simcere Pharmaceutical Group is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of three years of paying a dividend. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 33%. Regardless, the future ROE for Simcere Pharmaceutical Group is predicted to rise to 16% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.\n\nSummary\n\nOn the whole, we do feel that Simcere Pharmaceutical Group has some positive attributes. Even in spite of the low rate of return, the company has posted impressive earnings growth as a result of reinvesting heavily into its business. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals? Click here to be taken to our analyst's forecasts page for the company."
