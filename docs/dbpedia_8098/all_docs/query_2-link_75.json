        "text": "Simcere Pharmaceutical Group Limited announced that, on October 15, 2023, a new indication of SIM0237 for injection, an anti-PD-L1/IL-15 bispecific antibody independently developed by the Group, has obtained the Clinical Trial Approval issued by the National Medical Products Administration (Guo Jia Yao Pin Jian Du Guan Li Ju) (the \"NMPA\") of China, which is intended to be applicable to patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). SIM0237 is an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody fused with IL-15/IL-15R sushi protein and developed in-house by utilizing the Group's self-owned protein engineering platform. It can block the PD-1/PD-L1 immunosuppressive pathway via binding to PD-L1 and activate the immune system through its IL-15 part, thus playing a dual synergistic role of relieving immunosuppression and boosting the immune system to exhibit antitumor effect.\n\nPreclinical studies showed that SIM0237 is more effective than PD-L1 or IL-15 mono treatment in mouse tumor models, suggesting a high potential for clinical development. Application for new-drug clinical trial of indication of SIM0237 for treating advanced solid tumors was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and China's NMPA on October 27, 2022 and December 23, 2022, respectively, and, at present, the relevant multi-regional clinical trial (MRCT) of the indication is in progress concurrently in China and the U.S."
