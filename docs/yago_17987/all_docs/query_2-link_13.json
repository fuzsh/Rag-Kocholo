Second, I rarely use the word “weird” when I blog about Japanese stuff, but the trailer for this film is weird (and thankfully in English). And third, the trailer is NSFW and definitely not suitable for children.\n\nI have no idea what Robo-geisha is about, that’s why I quote from the trailer: “Geisha is Japanese girl. Geisha is beautiful and wild. Geisha is robot!!”.\n\nThe movie also has samurai robots, a geisha robot army, school girl fembots and even “castle robots” in it."
