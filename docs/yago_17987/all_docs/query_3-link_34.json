        "text": "(Andy Synn weighs in from England with a review of the live show by Cannibal Corpse, The Black Dahlia Murder, and Hour of Penance in Nottingham.)\n\nPretty badass line-up, right? I definitely count myself lucky to have caught this tour, as not only have I never seen HoP live before, but I never miss a Black Dahlia show if I can help it, AND I’d been hearing awesome things about Cannibal Corpse’s form this time around.\n\nI count myself doubly lucky because the damn doors to the show were scheduled for half freaking 5, with Hour Of Penance hitting the stage at the ungodly time of 5:45 pm, a time when a huge number of people were either still in work, or still stuck in traffic. In fact I know several people who came from surrounding cities who missed the first two bands entirely, and barely made it in time to see Cannibal Corpse!\n\nBad form Rock City, bad form… Continue reading »\n\nWelcome to the 22nd — and final — part of our my list of the year’s most infectious extreme metal songs. In each installment, I’ve been posting at least two songs that made the cut. For more details about what this list is all about and how it was compiled, read the introductory post via this link. To see the selections that preceded the six I’m announcing today, click here. And in the near future I’ll compile all the songs in a single post.\n\nThat’s right — six songs, because 666. Have you figured out yet that I’m really terrible at making choices among things I really like? Do you begin to understand why I don’t compile my own year-list of the best albums? I mean, shit, this thing has grown to 22 installments and the only reason I’m finally stopping is because the month of January is over today and even I realize that it’s getting out of hand.\n\nBut we’re going out in a blaze of glory — a blaze of death metal glory, with six songs representing six different flavors of the genre, beginning with who else but . . .\n\nCANNIBAL CORPSE\n\nTheMadIsraeli reviewed this legendary band’s latest offering for us (here) and included this summing up: “Torture is the latest crusade in Cannibal Corpse’s tyrannical campaign to rule over everyone and everything with audio carnage so visceral that simply listening creates a serious risk of blood-vomiting convulsions. But Torture? Torture is officially the best album of the Corpsegrinder era yet.” Continue reading »\n\nI think this qualifies as a HOLY FUCKING SHIT moment, and if you disagree then your mouth must be much better behaved than mine.\n\nWord leaked last week about this tour, but yesterday it was confirmed, and dates were disclosed. The second annual DECIBEL MAGAZINE TOUR will include Cannibal Corpse, Napalm Death, and Immolation. In other words, genuine death metal and grind royalty from both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nOther face-ripping bands will join the sonic evisceration party on selected dates: Beyond Creation, Cretin, and Magrudergrind.\n\nI have to say that DECIBEL is not fucking around, any more than they did last year for the Euro-centric inaugural edition of this tour (which featured Behemoth, Watain, The Devil’s Blood, and In Solitude). It’s refreshing to see a tour packaged without any effort to pander in any way to the tastes of people who don’t want to get their fuckin’ teeth kicked in. Continue reading »\n\nThe PRP and Lambgoat have reported this morning that Cannibal Corpse, Misery Index, Hour of Penance, and Deeds of Flesh will be embarking on a continuation of THE U.S. TORTURE TOUR this fall. There has not yet been an official announcement, though one is expected soon. UPDATE: There has now been an official announcement by Cannibal Corpse, and here is a complete schedule:\n\n11/16 Huntsville, AL Crossroads Music Hall\n\n11/17 Little Rock, AR Juanitas\n\n11/18 Springfield, MO Outland Ballroom\n\n11/19 Bloomington, IL The Castle Theater\n\n11/20 Eau Claire, WI House Of Rock\n\n11/21 Madison, WI High Noon Saloon\n\n11/23 Flint, MI The Machine Shop\n\n11/24 Pittsburgh, PA Mr. Smalls\n\n11/25 Poughkeepsie, NY The Chance\n\n11/27 Providence, RI The Met\n\n11/28 New York, NY Rocks Off Concert Cruise aboard The Harbor Lights*\n\n11/29 Allentown, PA Crocodile Rock\n\n11/30 Asbury Park, NJ Stone Pony\n\n12/01 Washington, DC Rock N Roll Hotel\n\n12/03 Louisville, KY Headliners\n\n12/04 Spartanburg, SC Ground Zero\n\n12/06 Miami, FL Grand Central\n\n12/07 Tampa, FL Brass Mug\n\n*Show will not feature Hour of Penance\n\nThere will be maiming and killing and the consumption of human flesh and the picking of teeth with bone splinters. It’s nice to see that whoever organized this tour chose not to dilute the brutality by mixing and matching the genre styles. It’s just going to be 100% death metal hell.\n\nWe’ll fill in more details when we learn them.\n\nOh, and one more piece of titillating Hour of Penance news has surfaced. Continue reading »\n\nGood morning class. Our subject for today is that well-known romantic ballad by Cannibal Corpse, “I Cum Blood”.\n\nOf course, many of you know this gentle ode like the palm of your hand. But please raise those hands — how many of you have ever read the lyrics?\n\nI thought so. This is the problem with our instant-gratification society. You consume music so quickly and superficially. You get the quick headbang and then move on, without delving more deeply into the philosophical underpinnings of the artist’s inspiration and the nuances of the lyrical message. You miss the opportunity for personal growth that comes from a thoughtful exegesis of the words. You hear the noise and miss the poetry. This will not do.\n\nTo correct your shortcomings in music appreciation, we are privileged to have with us today Professor Big C, who will deliver for us a spoken-word recital of the lyrics to “I Cum Blood”.\n\nIt goes without saying that you have also neglected the heart-felt lyrical message in that classic Dying Fetus song, “Homicidal Retribution”, with its passionate protest against a justice system that allows killers to escape their just deserts. This tune, which appears on War of Attrition (2007), is one of your instructor’s favorite Dying Fetus ballads, and we are fortunate that the Relapse Records label has uploaded to YouTube for the first time a high-quality version of the official video for this masterwork. It was filmed at Philadelphia’s historic Eastern State Penitentiary. You will wish to familiarize yourself with its environs, because many of you are undoubtedly headed for similar accommodations.\n\nAfter you have reflected upon Professor Big C’s rendition of “I Cum Blood”, your next assignment will be to absorb the “Homicidal Retribution” video and write a 2,000-word essay on what it means to you. You may not use the words “fuck”, “fucking”, “awesome”, “shit”, “cum”, or “splooge” in your essay. Continue reading »\n\nPhro has obviously been spending way too much fucking time on his own blog or I would have found out about this movie from him instead of having to read about it on Skeletonwitch’s FB page.\n\nJust when you think zombie filmography has become so saturated that there’s nothing new to say about zombies, we get Zombie Ass: Toilet of the Dead. Leave it to the Japanese to take a tired old cinematic trope and breathe new life into the shit. I mean, don’t get me wrong: I like a crap zombie movie as much as the next dude, but they get kinda boring after a while — even when real life starts imitating art. But there’s a difference between a crap zombie movie and a craptastic movie with shit zombies and hot, gun-toting Japanese chicks wearing schoolgirl uniforms, which seems to be required dress for all hot Japanese chicks.\n\nZombie Ass, which premiered at a film festival in Austin, Texas (?!?) last fall and had its Japanese premiere in February 2012, was made by renowned Japanese director and legendary ass-fetishist Noboru Iguchi. It seems to involve poop-covered zombies crawling from outhouses, mutant intestinal parasites, and a lot of potent farting. Sounds awesome, no?\n\nThe odds of me seeing this movie are zero, but the “international” trailer for the film — complete with garbled English voiceover and titles — is fucking hysterical. Okay, to be more precise, it’s hysterical if you have a really juvenile, scatalogical sense of humor like I do, and I’m pretty sure you DO have that kind of sense of humor, or why else would you be wasting your time at this site? Continue reading »\n\n(TheMadIsraeli reviews the latest onslaught by Cannibal Corpse.)\n\nPAIN! DEATH! FLESH,BLOOD AND BONES EVERYWHERE! EAT EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE! REDUCE DIET TO NOTHING BUT HUMAN BRAIN MATTER!\n\nCannibal fucking Corpse man.\n\nHeretical-metal-fact-about-Israel time: I never really listened to Cannibal Corpse.\n\nI know. I know. I cried, too, once I realized my heresy, my crime against the metal lords and masters. The hype ramping up to their new album Torture caused me to go back and truly explore the band. I listened to the entire discography back to front, and realized . . .\n\nWHAT HAVE I BEEN FUCKING MISSING!?\n\nTorture is the latest crusade in Cannibal Corpse’s tyrannical campaign to rule over everyone and everything with audio carnage so visceral that simply listening creates a serious risk of blood-vomiting convulsions. But Torture? Torture is officially the best album of the Corpsegrinder era yet.\n\nBy using the rewind button a bit and revisiting roots that had been missing from the band’s sound since Corspegrinder’s introduction, Cannibal Corpse have succeeded in producing the finest slab of savagery in their latter period. Continue reading »\n\nAnd our Cannibal Corpse watch continues . . .\n\nNot long ago we featured a song from the band’s Torture album (which is out in official release today) that DECIBEL had premiered on-line. Today, the same song — “Encased In Concrete” — has become the subject of a new official video that debuted on Bloody Disgusting.\n\nLike the song, the video doesn’t hold still. In fact, I don’t think there’s a single frame that’s on screen for even one second. Epileptics beware. Also, yes, it features a dude being encased in concrete.\n\nThis song riiiiiiiiiips. The whole album riiiiiiiiiiips. The video does, too. Go HERE to watch it (it’s not yet embeddable or I’d just stick it up on our site).\n\nSo, because a certain record label has mistaken NCS for a legitimate organ of metal journalism (when in fact we were born out of wedlock), we have already heard the new Torture album by the almighty Cannibal Corpse. On March 13, when it issues forth from whatever kind of womb gives birth to something like this, everyone can hear it. But until then, the public streaming of new songs from the album is like a present for the ears.\n\nJust moments ago, the quite awesome DECIBEL magazine gave us one of those presents when they began streaming the fourth track from the album, “Encased In Concrete”. This motherfucker is like the detonation of a giant riff bomb. I counted three killer riffs (after I picked my teeth up off the floor), any one of which could have solidly anchored your average death metal onslaught. And that’s not counting the song’s intro, which is like the musical equivalent of being hosed down with a flamethrower.\n\nGo visit DECIBEL at this location to read the cool write-up about the album and stream the song. And if you’re too lazy to do that, the player is also here, after the jump. Continue reading »\n\nCannibal Corpse will be headlining SUMMER SLAUGHTER this summer and they’re about to leave for a tour of Europe. But in between those events, they’ll be headlining a 23-city tour of the U.S. beginning in April.\n\nToday, the band announced the U.S. Torture Tour 2012, sponsored by Metal Blade Records, Good Fight Entertainment, and dB Drum Shoes. It starts on April 5 in Jacksonville, Florida, and ends in Gainesville, Florida, on May 3.\n\nTheir support on this tour is first-class: Exhumed, Abysmal Dawn, and Arkaik. That will be a must-see show for death metalheads within spitting distance of any tour stop. Sadly, yours truly will be missing this tour, because the closest it will get to the Pacific Northwest is Colorado, and I can’t spit that far.\n\nThe full schedule is after the jump.
