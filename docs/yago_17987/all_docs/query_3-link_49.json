A superb soundtrack, some trippy visuals and excellent use of the setting make this a very worthwhile film. Maybe if Wheatley could've aced the more abstract scene this would've been a personal favorite, but it's still a very worthwhile film.\n\nRead all\n\nThe first hour is cool, as I have a soft spot for underwater adventure/horror films. The second hour brings all the meg action (and throws in a giant squid for good measure), but that part's not quite as exciting. It's pretty decent blockbuster entertainment and I hope Wheatley had fun making this, couldn't really see his hand in this film though, so he's probably better off doing his own thing.\n\nRead all\n\nMaxim de Winter is a wealthy Brit who falls in love with a young secretary on a vacation in Monte Carlo. He's still mourning the death of his late wife Rebecca, but for the first time in months he finds a welcome distraction. Soon after they marry, and he takes her with him to his estate in England. Not all the staff is happy to see a new face and Rebecca's memories still loom in every corner of the old house.\n\nThe cinematography is quite beautiful and the sound design is subtle but notable. The performances are all-round solid too. The build-up is slow, deliberate but effective. Much like Hitchcock's version though, the final 30 minutes feels rushed and puts too big of a focus on the narrative, which isn't all that interesting. It's a shame, but at least Wheatley offers a more than welcome improvement over Hitchcock's film."
