        "text": "Hey genre film geeks– yeah, I’m talking to you. Yeah, you! You animé-loving, horror-fiending, kung-fu fighting, lynchian-quiet-euro-art-house-maniac!\n\nThe International Fantasia Film Festival just announced the first wave of programming, and if this list — a tiny fraction of what’s to come — is any indication, then we’re in for a hell of a Summer!\n\nMobtreal extensively covered Fantasia last year, and we’ll be doing the same again this year… especially with this lineup.\n\nSome highlights under the jump:\n\n-First off, the poster art, by Donald Caron, is an absolutely gorgeous and loving tribute to the three heroes of genre film who passed away in the last few years, Bradbury, Harryhausen and Ackerman.\n\n-Honourary award for Mamoru Oshii and a screening of a remastered HD print of Ghost in the Shell!\n\n– An advanced screening of a film that I’ve been wanting to see for forever: MARVEL’S GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crIaEzXgqto\n\n-The much talked about and acclaimed JACKY IN THE KINGDOM OF WOMEN!\n\n-Brand-new films by Richard Linklater (DAZED & CONFUSED / A SCANNER DARKLY), John McNaughton (HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER / WILD THINGS)\n\n-And of course, your usual fair of the weird and poignant, to the amped up martial arts flicks, to the intelligent sci-fi, and the oddball horror!\n\nStoked!\n\nFantasia starts July 17th!\n\nEverything that we know is below:\n\nPress release\n\nFor immediate release\n\nThrough their work and energy, Harryhausen, Bradbury, and Ackerman have inspired many of the leading figures of genre cinema in recent decades, from George Lucas and Steven Spielberg to James Cameron, John Landis, Peter Jackson, Joe Dante, and Tim Burton. In 2005, Ray Harryhausen was the first recipient of Fantasia’s Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nThe poster art is also inspired by an old legend from Québecois folklore — La Chasse Galerie (otherwise known as “the Bewitched Canoe”) — in which lumberjacks, far away from their loved ones on New Year’s Eve, struck a deal with the devil to provide them with a means of quick transport over a great distance to their families. The devil obliged in providing them with a flying canoe, which he himself piloted. In the background, you can also see the festival’s black horse, itself inspired by another local folktale, the legend of the Cheval Noir. Fantasia has adopted the black horse as its emblematic symbol for the prize awarded by the main jury to the best film. We love the idea of fusing Québec folklore with the roots of modern genre creation and appreciation.\n\nFantasia’s 2014 poster art was created by award-winning Quebec illustrator Donald Caron.\n\nMamoru Oshii will be receiving his award on our opening night, July 17, before a special screening of the new HD master of GHOST IN THE SHELL, being re-issued by Manga Entertainment and Anchor Bay Entertainment in celebration of the 25th Anniversary of the original manga’s publication. This will be the first time the GITS HD print has been made available outside of Japan, lovingly restored, unadulterated and awe-inspiring in its beauty.\n\nOPENING FILM: JACKY IN THE KINGDOM OF WOMEN (JACKY AU ROYAUME DES FILLES)\n\nFantasia 2014 will launch with the Canadian premiere of JACKY IN THE KINGDOM OF WOMEN (Jacky au royaume des filles), a sharp political satire from comic book genius Riad Sattouf (LES BEAUX GOSSES) that took the Rotterdam Film Festival by storm.\n\nSet in the Democratic Republic of Bubunne where women lead and men are obligated to wear a veil and serve them, this subversive black comedy follows Jacky (Vincent Lacoste), a one-of-a-kind Cinderella, who wishes to marry the powerful and gorgeous Colonel (Charlotte Gainsbourg), daughter of the country’s leader (Anémone). You don’t think when you’re in love, you push on, and sometimes accidentally set off a coup d’état. The provocative and smart JACKY IN THE KINGDOM OF WOMEN couldn’t be more timely, urgent or funny.\n\nCENTERPIECE PRESENTATION: GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY\n\nFantasia will hold a special screening of the hotly anticipated new instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, starring Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, and the voice talents of Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper, directed by none other than James Gunn (SUPER, SLITHER) and presented in dazzling 3D.\n\nADDITIONAL FIRST WAVE ANNOUNCEMENTS INCLUDE:\n\nAMONG THE LIVING\n\nFrance Dir: Alexandre Bustillo, Julien Maury\n\nLeave it to the makers of INSIDE and LIVID to rework STAND BY ME as the horror film Stephen King always knew it could be. A tribute to ’80s cinema turned completely on its head, then decapitated. A standout at SXSW and the Brussels Fantastic Film Festival. Canadian Premiere\n\nANGRY VIDEO GAME NERD: THE MOVIE\n\nUSA Dir: Kevin Finn, James D. Rolfe\n\nHe is the enemy of the weak and wasteful, of garbage gameplay and lousy graphics, the one and only Angry Video Game Nerd! James D. Rolfe’s longstanding hit web series powers up to its big-screen debut! International Premiere\n\nBOYHOOD\n\nUSA Dir: Richard Linklater\n\nOver a decade ago, Richard Linklater assembled a cast he would film over a dozen years, to tell an utterly authentic tale of American childhood and adolescence. Many critics already call it one of the year’s best films, and so will you. Winner of the Silver Bear at the 2014 Berlin Film Festival and the Lone Star Award at SXSW 2014, this unique coming of age drama will launch the fifth edition of Fantasia’s Camera Lucida section. Quebec Premiere\n\nBROS BEFORE HOS\n\nNetherlands Dir: Steffen Haars, Flip Van der Kuil\n\nFollowing the awful breakup of their parents’ marriage, two brothers seal a pact that neither shall ever enter into a serious relationship with a woman. The Netherland’s renegade NEW KIDS team returns, still riotous and right on the edge of good taste. International Premiere\n\nCYBERNATURAL\n\nUSA Dir: Leo Gabriadze\n\nOn the anniversary of a teen’s suicide, the six cyberbullies responsible meet online for a group chat. A seventh, anonymous participant joins them. Told entirely way of a character’s computer screen, CYBERNATURAL brilliantly nails the ways in which we communicate and present ourselves online, hitting hard with a new kind of horror for an increasingly connected-yet-disconnected world. Produced by Timur Bekmambetov (WANTED, NIGHTWATCH). World Premiere\n\nCROWS EXPLODE\n\nJapan Dir: Toshiaki Toyoda\n\nFists will fly and beatings will abound, but the greatest battles are always in the hearts of the sneering, delinquent punks of the notorious Suzuran All-Boys High School. After Takashi Miike, it’s now BLUE SPRING director Toshiaki Toyoda’s turn to make a knuckle mark on the CROWS ZERO franchise. North American Premiere\n\nDEALER\n\nFrance Dir: Jean Luc Herbulot\n\nDirected with volcanic energy, DEALER is a sturdy thriller that drags its audience full-steam ahead through a Parisian underbelly filled with hoods and thugs, marking the powerful arrival of one of the most promising new voices in French genre cinema. A feature-film baptism filled with noise and fury. World Premiere\n\nGIOVANNI’S ISLAND\n\nJapan Dir: Mizuho Nishikubo\n\nA gracefully executed anime from Production I.G, examining the struggles of the Japanese in the immediate aftermath of World War II, from the perspective of a child.

Canadian Premiere\n\nTHE HARVEST\n\nUSA Dir: John McNaughton\n\nA surprising story told in twists, tears and blood, maverick HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER / WILD THINGS filmmaker John McNaughton’s long-awaited return stars Samantha Morton, Michael Shannon, Charlie Tahan and Peter Fonda and exists in a disquieting median space between sinister fairy tale and shattering human horror. International Premiere\n\nHAN GONG-JU\n\nSouth Korea Dir: Lee Su-jin\n\nA troubled teenage girl flees her past — is she guilty or a victim? A multiple prize winner, notably attaining the Silver Tiger Award at this year’s Rotterdam International Film Festival, HAN GONG-JU is a magnificent yet devastating debut feature of incredible narrative virtuosity. Canadian Premiere\n\nTHE HUNTRESSES\n\nSouth Korea Dir: Park Jae-hyun\n\nA trio of daring and dangerous bounty-hunting beauties find themselves in a high-risk, high-stakes game of subterfuge and swordplay in medieval Korea.

Canadian Premiere\n\nINTO THE STORM\n\nUSA Dir: Steven Quayle\n\nIn the span of a single day, the town of Silverton is ravaged by an unprecedented onslaught of tornadoes. The entire town is at the mercy of the erratic and deadly cyclones, even as storm trackers predict the worst is yet to come. Most people seek shelter, while others run towards the vortex, testing how far a storm chaser will go for that once-in-a-lifetime shot. Quebec Premiere\n\nKILLERS\n\nIndonesia/Japan Dir: The Mo Brothers\n\nTwo serial killers. One likes to kill, the other seeks justice. The problem is, the first one is mentoring the latter… Social media will bring a storm of blood over both Tokyo and Jakarta in this shocking yet incredibly smart horror thriller in the vein of THE CHASER and COLD FISH that floored audiences at Sundance. Canadian Premiere\n\nKITE\n\nUSA/Mexico Dir: Ralph Ziman\n\nThe controversial and influential anime finally sees a live-action adaptation, stylishly directed by award-winning South African filmmaker Ralph Ziman (JERUSALEMA) and backed by a cast that features Samuel L. Jackson, Callan McAuliffe, and India Eisley. The film succeeds brilliantly in blending the elements that made the original material a mythical piece of art. International Premiere\n\nLIVE\n\nJapan Dir: Noboru Iguchi\n\nWhen his mother is kidnapped and a stranger calls, Naoto is thrust into a public triathlon of death. DEAD SUSHI director Noboru Iguchi’s running go at the survival-race genre is loveably lurid, super-sanguinary fun. North American Premiere\n\nTHE MAN IN THE ORANGE JACKET\n\nLatvia Dir: Aik Karapetian\n\nA laid-off worker kills his ex-boss in cold blood, and assumes his lifestyle. The good times will be short-lived, however as things are about to take an unexpected turn. In a similar vein than Polanski:s THE TENANT, Armenian filmmaker Aik Karapetian’s audacious slasher is this year’s most groundbreaking work of dramatic horror. World Premiere\n\nTHE MIDNIGHT SWIM\n\nUSA Dir: Sarah Adina Smith\n\nSpirit Lake is unusually deep. No diver has ever managed to find the bottom. When Dr. Amelia Brooks disappears during a deep-water dive, her three daughters travel home. They find themselves unable to let go and become drawn into the mysteries of the lake.

Canadian Premiere\n\nPUZZLE\n\nJapan Dir: Eisuke Naito\n\nThe staff and students at Noriaki Hill High School have been given a game to play, one in which mistakes can be fatal.

North American Premiere\n\nTHE RECONSTRUCTION OF WILLIAM ZERO\n\nUSA Dir: Dan Bush\n\nA scientist awakens from a coma in the care of his twin brother, but neither may be exactly who they first appear to be. A cinematic jigsaw puzzle that delves into the darker side of science fiction, THE RECONSTRUCTION… marks the return of Dan Bush (2008’s THE SIGNAL) and stars Conal Byrne, Amy Seimetz and A.J. Bowen.
