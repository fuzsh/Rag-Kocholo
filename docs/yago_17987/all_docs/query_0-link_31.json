        "text": "Reader review by “Cletus.”\n\nDIRECTOR:\n\nFEATURING: Takumi Saito, Aya Kiguchi\n\nPLOT: Two sisters compete with each other for dominance in a secret society of geisha assassins, which is led by the evil head of a steel manufacturing corporation.\n\nWHY IT SHOULD MAKE THE LIST: Let’s start with the purposefully terrible dialogue. Move on to Tangu twins wearing phallic masks and matching bras. Maybe the absolutely ridiculous weapon placements including armpit swords, breast lasers, and stomach bombs. The guy with the stomach bomb has cocktail shrimp stuck in his eyes by the way. Oh yes: all this and much, much more.\n\nCOMMENTS: This movie must have been at least as fun to make as it is to watch. The first couple times I saw it I was alternating between jaw-dropping awe and side-splitting laughter. The insane and chaotic visual effects are so delightfully unpredictable and so relentless that around half an hour in you simply give in and enjoy the ride. It is purposefully bad in a rare way, and on multiple viewings it just seems to get better and better.\n\nWHAT THE CRITICS SAY:\n\n“…what you might see if you were to watch Power Rangers whilst taking a hit of acid every five minutes.”–Dave Robson, Sound on Sight (festival screening)\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n366 Weird Movies is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.
