        "text": "Today’s selection: Karate Robo Zaborgar (2011, dir. Noboru Iguchi)\n\nSubgenre: Henshin Hero (well, a bike that transforms into a hero)\n\nAvailable from: Well-Go\n\nA remake/sequel/parody of 1974’s Electroid Zaborgar TV series, Noboru Iguchi’s take on Zaborgar is crazy enough that you can tell the original was a Kazuo Koike creation. While the first act plays remarkably faithfully to the original show, the later part becomes the hypersexual insanity that one would expect from a Sushi Typhoon production (the movie’s own actor Hiroyuki Watanabe once informed me that Iguchi was a weirdo and that I probably shouldn’t watch his movies). While this is a recommend for fans of Iguchi’s work, it’s a necessity for fans of old-school Japanese super hero action."
