        "text": "In September 2018, the world-traveling Red Bull Music Academy returns to the city where it all began in celebration of its 20th anniversary. A total of 61 music-makers selected from across the globe will converge on the German capital for five weeks of lectures, studio sessions and one-of-a-kind music events. This yearâs edition will take place at the Funkhaus, a historic recording studio complex in East Berlin and one of the largest in the world.\n\nEvery year, the Academy receives thousands of applications from artists hailing from around the world. A jury carefully reads â and listens â through each and every submission, resulting in a class that reflects the diverse styles, methodologies and cultural backgrounds of the applicant pool. This year, artists representing 37 different nationalities, including Kenya, South Korea, Mexico, Canada, the Philippines, Russia, New Zealand, Spain, Turkey and Brazil, have been invited to attend the Red Bull Music Academy in Berlin, which takes place from September 8 to October 12.\n\nAmong the many sounds and styles championed by the incoming class of 2018 are evocative electronica from Japan; IDM from Iranâs underground club scene; new-school UK jazz; Afro-future dance music from South Africa; experimental hip-hop from Germany; Nigerian neo-soul; Georgian drone; industrial techno from Poland; post-punk from the US, and much, much more.\n\nEvery Academy is a world of its own, offering new insights and perspectives on sound. During their time in Berlin, the participants will attend lectures and workshops with some of musicâs brightest lights and work on music together in a custom-built, state-of-the-art recording environment. Concurrently, Red Bull Music will present a month-long festival of public concerts and club nights across the city. It all makes for a place where influential musicians meet a new generation, in a setting where both sides can learn from each other and celebrate musicâs past, present and future.\n\nFrom the refined piano of Chilly Gonzales to the elegance of modern dance icon Pina Bausch and the precisely engineered music of producer Alva Noto, there is a certain delicacy connecting the influences of Brighton-based artist Akiko Haruna. Trained as a pianist, violinist, flautist and dancer, she is fluent in the rules of music and composition, which she now breaks with her experimental noise output. Akikoâs current project comes after two years as a professional dancer, during which she appeared in music videos for artists including AlunaGeorge and John Newman. Now a full-time music student, Akiko flexes her myriad abilities in her own work, including the 2017 video for âi, omega,â a surreal black-and-white pastiche in which she dances, stretches and smiles eerily at the camera over the glitches and fuzz of her far-out soundscape.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nAnna Papaioannou has a knack for bridging together seemingly different things. Musically, she combines Greek folk and techno music with both digital and analog tools. She has extensive musical knowledge, having studied composition in Edinburgh and piano at a conservatory in Athens, and her professional background is in music and sound design for theater and film. As Anna Vs June, Papaioannouâs experimental instrumentation and soft yet steady vocals provide a sonic journey into the extreme boundaries of pop. Not one to shy away from layers and complex textures in her sound, it is the simple things from which Anna draws inspiration, such as travel and her friends. She was drawn to music as a simple escape and in her sound she comes full circle to recreate that same safe space.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nAs Atariame, Natalia Salmina draws emotional intensity out of a fog of obscured electronics and introverted folk melodies. Itâs music for times of solitude: Her 2017 album Fear is the World was written over a period of isolation during the St. Petersburg winter, but Salminaâs hermit-like approach to composing makes for the kind of compelling detail you can get lost in, whether the backdrop is the distorted static of âAlways the Youngestâ or the guitar-based âFluffy Paws,â where the echoes of the John Maus songs that she loved as a teenager are most evident. Salmina fell into music-making when, at the age of 12, she started strumming a guitar at a friendâs birthday party and got lost in her own world, despite not knowing how to play it; and that same careful exploration of her own headspace informs her work now.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nHeartbreak has prompted much of the greatest art ever made, and Adam Ovletrea knows why. âThereâs a purity in loss,â says the 23-year-old producer from Florida, âItâs fueled me at my lowest moments.â Ever since his uncle sat him down at age 13 and taught him how to use Pro Tools, Ovletrea has turned to music in those âlow moments,â amassing a catalogue of indie music thatâs cracked with sorrow, lit by hope and smoothed over with a lo-fi film. As bear, he released Breadcrumbs and Cruise Control, both proudly emo in a lasers-and-lightshows part of the United States. A touch Drake and with a dash of â80s new wave, Ovletreaâs songs are sweet, lovesick and danceable, with gently harmonized pleas atop plucky acoustic guitar riffs made silky with synths. They stick out, but in the best possible way.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nYou could say that Benjamim Sallum has joined the family business. The SÃ£o Paulo-based DJ/producer was first exposed to the cityâs vibrant electronic underground through his mother, a longstanding event producer. Sallumâs dad gave him a guitar when he was three, and he started making his own music less than a decade later. He now plays festivals and parties throughout Brazil, making acid and techno thatâs been released by Mexicoâs Quiero Recordings, and has founded his own label, Oxi, specialized in lo-fi tapes. Additionally, he crafts house, ambient and techno with My Girlfriend, a duo featuring 2014 RBMA Tokyo alum Pedro Zopelar. In 2017, My Girlfriend played the RBMA Festival in SÃ£o Paulo, opening for Theo Parrish, who Sallum â in job training since birth â first heard as a baby.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nIn Camille Mandokiâs strange, uncategorizable compositions, the Mexican singer and sound artist explores the wildest shores of catharsis. Her palette ranges from stumbling, decaying fairground music to menacing flurries of percussion; on her 2016 debut album, We Used to Talk for Hours, Mandoki used her voice as an instrument of choral beauty, but over the next two years began to bend it into warped shapes on cuts like âPriscilla Drumsâ and âFailure (Sound of an Animal)â. Confrontational in both modes, Mandokiâs drive to push the outer limits of her vocals can be reminiscent of Diamanda GalÃ¡s and Lydia Lunch, though as a performer â both by herself and with an all-female group she calls a âsound and body confession roomâ â her work is entirely unique.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nFrancisco Marujoâs last name means âsailor,â and the Lisbon producer describes his search for the missing pieces of his musical map as getting âlost in a sea of sound.â Itâs a description that suits his William Basinski-inspired ambient synthscapes to a tee. Under the name Carga AÃ©rea, Marujo creates shimmering washes of sound â sometimes warmly nostalgic, at others with a keen sense of drama. And heâs not afraid to push further outwards: His second EP, released at the end of 2017, was OcorrÃªncia Em Aberto, a cinematic 32-minute composition inspired by the forest fires that had raged around the Portuguese countryside that year. Itâs a testament to Marujoâs ability to tie the abstract nature of ambient music to real-life topics and locations.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nThe Polish producer CHINO describes his music as âsometimes oppressive, sometimes dystopian, but always with a bit of hope.â Artur Oles, as heâs known outside the club, considers his music as CHINO part of the emerging genre âwave,â employing icy synths and pounding kicks in a raw-edged take on techno. Regardless of his genre, Olesâ productions are as tastefully crafted as a nice sans serif â which makes sense, because when heâs not making music, Oles designs sleek posters for festivals and shows. This is music made to be blasted in a chilly warehouse filled with ravers â his beats are minimal and industrial. But, as he says, even on his steeliest tracks a little warmth shines through.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nMusic has always been a family affair for Tommy Impey: Growing up in a small UK burg, his parents made their home a haven of â80s jazz funk. No surprise, then, when Impey became a rising producer and DJ at the age of 18, after issuing his debut vinyl release, 2014âs Bangclap/4titude. This year heâs launched his own label, Ghost Notes, and hosts a show on NTS Radio of the same name, where he plays sounds that he describes as âpost-twilight.â Versatility has been a hallmark of Impeyâs production: His more recent work finds him blasting off into the ether with dazzling synths (as on âMidnight in Little Havanaâ) or crafting taut and clear-eyed industrial grime. Despite the vastly different sounds he produces, however, they all ultimately fall under one heading â blockbuster.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nBetween 2013 and 2016, Indira Force was half of Doprah, a neo-trip-hop duo who opened for Lorde and whose debut album, 2016âs Wasting, received international attention. When the band split, Force â who also composes film soundtracks, dance scores and even music for political campaigns â stepped out on her own to become indi. Despite her trepidation at embarking on a project by herself, her first solo album, 2017âs Precipice, was a triumph, performed with saxophonists, trombonists and a violin septet to bring Forceâs lush, baroque vision to life. Inspired by the natural world and the dreaming state, there are echoes of BjÃ¶rk and Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith in Forceâs music, whether stately and ornate â such as on âAirportalâ â or tactile, like the gently drifting âDemeter.â\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nBorn in a small industrial city in eastern Germany, Jacob Stoy first got into music when he was eight years old, working with his father to build loops using Mixman computer software. As a teenager, he gravitated towards playing guitar in jazz bands. Now, heâs part of a handful of promising projects that stand at the cross-section of dance music and the art world. Whether making his own beats or collaborating with the synth-pop band Room Service and the experimental duo Inkasso, Stoy has a knack for pumping grooves full of odd, gritty textures. Heâs released a handful of 12\"s on the labels Uncanny Valley, Abstract Animal and Eyes of My Eyes since 2012, and in 2017 he was busy doing DJing at clubs, festivals and radio shows, as well as solo live performances that occasionally saw him accompanied by dancers.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nProducer and DJ Jakinda Boya describes his style as âafro-future electronica,â pitched at the meeting point of some of South Africaâs most vital dance scenes: gqom, kwaito and hip-hop. As half of the Stiff Pap duo with rapper Ayema Problem, he told the story of an Umlazi teenagerâs first illicit after-dark experiences on their 2017 debut EP, Based on a Qho Story. From the bass-heavy banger âDlalaâ to the frenetic âLive From Eloxionâ to the airy, blissful âStiff Pap Forever,â its range is remarkable for a producer who had only begun his musical education two years prior, mostly self-taught from YouTube tutorials. This Kanye West and Culoe de Song fan, who once harbored ambitions to become a pro surfer, is situated at the heart of one of the most exciting scenes of the 2010s.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nIf thereâs one thing Jeanne Kaiser canât live without, itâs love: âThe human soul and the whole universe is made to give and receive love,â she says. As a singer, producer and classically-trained cellist who performs under the name Jeannel, she makes this powerful feeling clear with her dreamy, R&B-oriented pop: Her 2016 single âMind Tricksâ begins as an acoustic guitar strummer only to blossom into a wide-screen dreamscape of electronic beats and swirling synths. Usually backed by a full band, sheâs also experimented with stripped-down stage setups involving cello and a friend playing guitar and doing back-up vocals. Whether sheâs performing or in the studio, though, she always connects to her audience with a strong sense of compassion.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nThe Prague-based Slovakian artist Katarina Kubosiova began making music in her early 20s, because writing lyrics and songs felt like the only way she could fully express herself. As it turns out, her talent exceeded her expectations, taking her from confessional bedroom writing sessions to festival main stages throughout Slovakia and the Czech Republic, as well as to the hallowed halls of the Slovak National Theater, where she has recently worked on an adaptation of Sophoclesâ Antigone. Performing as Katarzia, Kubosiovaâs music oscillates between toughness and delicacy as her voice floats above both fractal beats and sumptuous analog soundscapes. She and her band toured extensively behind her sophomore album Agnostika, playing the Czech Republicâs Colours of Ostrava in 2017. The biggest music festival in Central Europe, it takes place not far from where Kubosiova grew up, but is nevertheless a long way from her bedroom.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nAbout two hours north of Toronto, thereâs a studio nestled in the woods where you can go to write and record, free from distraction. Itâs co-owned by Lisa Conway, a writer, musician and composer who makes kinetic avant-pop music under the name L CON. Conway, who holds both Canadian and Swiss citizenship, has composed music for performance artists, filmmakers and dancers, but itâs her solo work that expresses a vital, singular worldview and establishes her as a compelling artist to watch. Conway will layer seemingly disparate component parts â a violin, sinewy drum programming â highlighting the rhythmic or emotional threads that connect the whole. She also has the vocal chops to carry raw, minimal piano ballads; her work is engrossing, the kind of music that dims all the outside worldâs white noise.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nAs a baby in Jos, Nigeria, Lindsey Abudei was lulled to sleep by music on the radio. It was no surprise then, when she learned to sing by ear. Her parents poured their diverse musical tastes â Roberta Flack and the Beach Boys, Stevie Wonder and Sarah McLachlan â into their daughterâs eager, outstretched ears, and Abudei eventually shaped the influences into her own sound, neo-soul flecked with acoustic guitar riffs. After performing as the lead singer for the Jazzcats, and featuring on albums by MI and Jesse Jagz, she released her debut EP, 2013âs Brown, which won her third place in Radio France Internationaleâs Prix Decouvertes. In 2016, she dropped her debut album â¦And the Bass Is Queen, spreading her intoxicating blend of a pristine voice, delicate piano melodies and earthy basslines even further into the world, and just in time: Neo-soul needed a new voice.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nLoradeniz is a producer, classically educated pianist and vocalist who has been hailed as a rising indie talent in the Netherlands as well as Turkey. Inspired by traditional and folkloric music forms, and utilizing both electronic and acoustic elements, her sprawling, spacious arrangements are informed by her graduate and postgraduate studies in composition, production and sound design. Currently based in Amsterdam, and performing frequently in Istanbul, she describes her sound as a blend of contemporary classical, minimal and ambient. A certain pop and jazz sensibility shines through as well, as evidenced by the delicate harmonies and triumphant piano lines of 2017âs Mara EP, or the searing soul-imbued vocals of her recent song âJello,â with lyrics that quote the writing of Charles Bukowski.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nAs a young boy in Dublin, Daniel Coughlan was first inspired to make music by seeing the band Focus perform âSylviaâ on the television show The Old Grey Whistle Test. He has since built up his musical experience from âthe streetsâ and from the age of 13 has played in a number of bands simultaneously. These currently include Search Party Animal, self-described as âfive best friends having a bop to electro guitar pop bangers;â and indie electronic outfit Ã MAK, whose recent single, âGlow,â he co-wrote and produced. His production style weaves dream-pop vocals and pithy television sound bites into moongaze trip-hop. The lush instrumentation tells a story all its own, in the chords and downtempo basslines, yet Danielâs ability to align the vocal sampling into a common emotive thread creates a soulfully ambient vibe.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nAriel Schlichter is an Argentinian artist who most often releases music under the name Maqueta. When heâs not producing local Buenos Aires bands in his home studio, Schlichter makes his own woozy, seductive electro-pop. His songs feature hints of tropicalia and â80s synth-pop, all overlaid with plenty of reverb; his passionate vocals lend these slick productions melodrama and expansiveness. Just when you think youâve figured Schlichter out, he throws a curveball, like at the end of his 2017 track âMientras Miro el Cristal,â which transforms from a standard pop song into something much stranger. The song downshifts into slow motion, Schlichterâs vocals and drums dragging into a strange and ominous timbre, like the seconds before a car crash. Schlichterâs music is easy to enjoy, but with these experimental twists, itâll always keep you on your toes.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nTornike Margvelashvili, also known as Mess_Montage, produces melancholic ambient sounds with such a slow build that they engulf you before you even realize it. A self-proclaimed outsider to the mainstream musical universe, inspired by Georgian folk chant harmonies as well as the abstract and expressionist movements in art and film, Tornike has found his niche in layered electronic instrumentals best absorbed sitting or even lying down. At Tbilisi State Conservatoire, where he now teaches sound synthesis, he was one of the first students to attend from a non-classical background, and his studies have also taken him to the Royal Academy of Music in Aarhus, Denmark. He released his debut album, The Death of Optimus Prime, on Shimmering Moods Records in 2017, on which the shortest track is pushing six minutes. In Tornikeâs world, the best things are enjoyed nice and slow.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nWhen he was a child, Nathan Tulve was invited to the home of iconic Estonian composer Arvo PÃ¤rt, who was writing a piece of music for the choir conducted by Tulveâs father. PÃ¤rt played his composition on the piano for Tulve and his brother, whose young minds were blown by the stirring minimalism. Years later, Tulve had a similarly profound moment of sonic bliss when stumbling upon a track by Amnesia Scanner. This appreciation for disparate types of music and music-making has carried over to his own work, which Tulve produces as metabora. Incorporating elements of classical, metal, experimental electronic and more, he assembles spatial digital elements into soundscapes that breathe like organic matter. Heâs also co-produced Tallinnâs Club Felicity party series, collaborated with vocal ensemble Vox Clamantis and recently wrote an eight-minute track to soundtrack a dance performance. Regardless of the format, Tulveâs goal of blowing minds with music remains the same.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nIn 2017, Parker Mulherin spent 11 days driving from his native Memphis to Los Angeles, staying in roadside motels as he left the south for southern California. He stopped in New Mexico, the Grand Canyon, Las Vegas, exploring the country as one era of his life faded into the next with the same fluidity that his influences â Drake, the Beatles, James Blake â melt together to form Mulherinâs R&B output. Along for the roadtrip was Parkerâs twin brother Marshall, a 2015 RBMA alumnus and the other half of their duo, Mulherin. Parker first played music in the high school drum corps, then started making beats while attending Loyola University in New Orleans. He and his brother were noticed with the 2015 release of âDaily,â a demonstration of Mulherinâs spare arrangements and parallel vocals. Now settled in LA, Parker continues making music that bridges his Memphis influences and modernist, millennial approach.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nNewRa calls her music âan ode to bass and space,â but itâs less concerned with paying homage to those concepts and more interested in wrestling with them, fighting to gain new ground. While the Swiss-based producer and vocalist is perhaps best known as one-sixth of the deep house outfit Sirens of Lesbos, her solo venture unfolds much differently. NewRa plays with pace and texture in ways that make her music feel both warm and foreign, experimental but never academic. There are times she uses her voice as a songâs main melodic component; at other points, her vocals are merely mood lighting. As she strikes out on her own, NewRa is looking to grow as a producer and to hone her engineering skills, all in the service of fleshing out her already rich recordings.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nNick LeÃ³n found his place in the world of hip-hop by collaborating with some of the biggest rappers in South Florida â think Denzel Curry and Robb Banks. But as a growing sense of restlessness gnawed at the self-taught producer, he felt compelled to make the jump to the beat scene. The risk paid off. In 2016, the Miami-based LeÃ³n released his lush debut album, ProfecÃ­a, to rave reviews. Polished, yet humid as a hothouse and bursting with life thanks to the sampled chirps, clicks and hisses of the birds and insects that populate swampy Florida, the album branded LeÃ³n and his endlessly experimental beats as one of the most exciting producers to step onto the scene in years. With a film score, further production for other artists, DJ gigs galore and a label/collective he launched for other producers and bedroom musicians in Miami, Nick LeÃ³nâs hands are full, his heart happy and his beats teeming with (real) life.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nWhile heâs not yet a household name, Quinn Oulton has already made history. In February of 2017, the jazz instrumentalist and singer performed aboard British Airwaysâ inaugural flight to New Orleans, setting the record for the highest ever live jazz gig. When the plane landed, it was Mardi Gras and Oulton was thrust into the jazz epicenterâs most famous party. The London-based musician calls it one of the most significant experiences of his life, and an extension of the training heâs been steeped in since picking up the sax at age eight. He has formally studied jazz since childhood, performing in a variety of bands, attending Grammy Camp 2013 in Los Angeles and focusing on jazz saxophone at the Royal Academy of Music in London. Oulton spent much of 2017 producing his self-titled debut solo album, and working with his five-piece band Quinnâs Cars, who perform Oultonâs sumptuous arrangements while dressed as mechanics.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nAlexandra Vinogradova, who performs as Sasha Vinogradova, has a beautiful, versatile voice, a passion for performing live and a gift for writing indie-folk ballads rich with lush arrangements. Since her godfather first handed her a guitar when she was 16, sheâs honed her craft by following her intuition, inventing words while sheâs singing, taking influence from psychedelic bands like Can and working as a credentialed music therapist to help kids and adults heal from various ailments. Her 2017 album ÐÐ»Ð°ÑÐºÐ°Ð²Ð»Ñ features the five-piece Sirius Orchestra, who fill out her tender compositions with cello, violin, ukulele, trumpet and more. For her next project, Vinogradova hopes to record an album using just the human voice, incorporating lyrics and extended vocal techniques to make an âabstract clothâ of sounds.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nAt 16 years old, Joan CaÃ±ellas RodrÃ­guez found himself DJing at SÃ³nar Festival in his native Barcelona. After that splashy appearance, though, the producer and instrumentalist put his head back down and began developing his own sound. While studying audiovisual engineering at university, he recorded a soundtrack as well as a handful of minimal, unreleased songs. When working as InnoDB, he tilts towards the drone and ambient end of the spectrum. As Shelly (formerly DJ iTunes10.2), his music is rooted in bass music, pulsing with must-move synth runs and finished with a cosmopolitan sheen, yet it also swirls and swishes with sweet, earthy samples â a pure-voiced recording of a childrenâs choir, perhaps, or the chanting of a tribal chief. It all makes for a heady blend that would keep you on the dance floor at SÃ³nar â and beyond â until dawn.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nSamuel Namasaka has never been afraid to have a terrible idea. âThatâs where I learn all my lessons,â says the producer, DJ and instrumentalist. âIt gives me a clearer idea of what I want.â Thatâs never been an issue for Namasaka. Growing up in Nairobi, his mother made him play the piano. Though it was a difficult instrument, he fell in love with it and after two years of trudging, he finally began to fly, propelled by the âprocess of creation.â Since then, his passion has led to his working with the likes of Willow Smith and Tyler Cole, who were drawn to his slinky, soul-injected R&B. His soft-pedaled sound is more compelling the longer you listen â rich with instrumentation yet restrained, subtle yet funky, sweetly melodic yet full of sophisticated rhythms. And as evinced on his 2018 debut album, The Project Greatness, those âterrible ideasâ are few and far between.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nThough heâs only in his mid-20s, Gerardo Cedillo has been intimately involved in dance music for over a decade. He got his start as one half of Kry-Lon, a duo that sat at the forefront of the ânew raveâ scene in his hometown of Tijuana, Mexico. In the years since, Cedillo has grown enormously as a producer, DJ and multi-instrumentalist, and keeps himself busy running the label Vicario Musique Recordings. As Soul Of Hex, he conjures up astral deep house odysseys, drawing from the raw sensuality and restraint of classic house and techno, while incorporating jazzy flourishes and colorful shifts in tone, rhythm and texture. In 2014, Larry Heard himself stepped in to remix the Soul Of Hex track âLip Reading,â and his DJ schedule has been hectic ever since, including an appearance at Amsterdamâs Dekmantel Festival in 2017.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nGrowing up, Martyna Maja was a singer who wanted to be the next Amy Winehouse. However, a serious throat condition put the blocks on that dream. And so, as VTSS, self-described âlone wolfâ Maja draws on her inner strength to produce seriously banging industrial techno instead. Tracks such as âLinked,â to be released in 2018 on new label Intrepid Skin, and 2017âs debut single âUnuntrium,â start relentless and pile on more clanks, more beats and more cavernous machine roars, daring the speakers to buckle under their weight. Itâs pounding, peak-time stuff that forces the body to keep moving. Majaâs live sets up the ante even further, if anything, slotting in neatly alongside similarly stern artists like Helena Hauff and DJ Stingray.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nWhen Octavio MÃ¡rquez started going to raves as a teenager, he had no idea he would one day orchestrate the scene. But now he is the DJ behind the booth, unspooling hours of skittery Latin percussion and high-powered bass spiced with heavy doses of reggaeton and baile funk â frenetic music that challenges even the most tireless dancer to stay on the floor. His 2016 debut, Data Nomadics, is a fervent, 16-song album that won critical acclaim and saw him joining the ranks of Mexico Cityâs NAAFI collective later that year. Heâs also known for his high-octane remixes of everyone from Ariana Grande to MC Bin Laden. When he is not watching the sun rise, he is probably napping with his cat.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nGiacomo Mazzucato, who goes by the pseudonym Yakamoto Kotzuga, says he mostly plays guitar and bass. Yet his intricate, skittering beats suggest a kinship with many electronic styles, from downtempo to hip-hop to IDM. But thatâs not all this musically omnivorous Italian artist does. On his 2015 debut album, Usually Nowhere, squeaky synths provided a backdrop for jazzy compositions in the mold of Flying Lotus, interwoven with whispering samples. His latest album Slowly Fading, released in March 2018, employs ricocheting percussion and reverb-heavy synth lines, on tracks that range in mood from contemplative to melancholic and ominous. Mazzucato sounds like a different artist from song to song, ensuring that listening to his work is never dull.\n\n[Back to the full list]\n\nSusana Hernandez Pulido fell in love with music as a teenager, sneaking into the room where her best friendâs older brother kept his vinyl and turntables. Itâs an affair that has continued, as Susana has become an emerging figure in the Barcelona electronic scene. A classically trained pianist, Susana first established herself playing breakbeat and electro at raves in the south of Spain. Almost two decades later, the Barcelona resident played the cityâs taste-making SÃ³nar Festival in 2017 and teaches at two local music schools when sheâs not DJing or hosting her monthly Dublab show, La Guarida â âthe lair.â She makes music as Ylia, her dancefloor-oriented persona, and Terence, an ambient project dealing heavily in cosmic after-hours vibes. With this all coming after a period when Susana was ready to give up music, her trajectory is proving to be a love story built to last.\n\n[Back to the full list]"
