        "text": "Kongohki\n\nposted by Doresh Original SA post\n\nI'm on a roll right now. Let's tackle the most metal player option:\n\nTenra Bansho Zero\n\nKongohki\n\nPart blades, part guns, all metal.\n\nThe battlefields of Tenra are filled with lots of scary opponents to face, be it giant robots, samurais hulking out, or freaky cyborgs. But nothing is quite as pantsshittingly scary as the Kongohki - aka \"The Unbreakable Ones\", aka \"The Machines of Vajra\", aka \"surprise magitek killdroid that move faster than your eyes can follow\".\n\nKongohki are the result of trying to figure out a way to miniaturize Armours. Power-armor-sized Suit Armours took a while to take off is because the more you miniaturize, the more the Rider's body gets in the way.\n\nSometime in the past, someone apparently went \"If Riders transfer their soul into the meikyo mirror when piloting their Armour, can't we just get rid off their bodies somehow?\". And that's the whole trick: Summon the spirit of a dead Asura, put him into a meikyo mirror (out of which he can't escape thanks to his Karma), mindwipe him and violÃ . You've got yourself an obedient magitek robot.\n\nAlternatively, you can just yank out the meikyo mirror out of an Armour whose Rider went Asura. Then you just have to mindwipe it.\n\nThanks to them not having to store the useless fleshy body of a pilot, they are comparatively lightweight and effectively designed (to the point some of them look like skeletons). This helps them with their Overdrive ability that lets them move at blinding speeds, allowing them to add an exploding die mechanic to their physical checks. A Kongohki with high skill ratings is pretty darn scary.\n\nLike Armours, they gain bonus die based on how much Karma they have. Unlike meikyo Armours, they don't have to keep track of two Karma scores or have to worry about instantly turning Asura when they reach 108 Karma. This gives the mass-produced Kimen Kongohki less advantages compared to a Kimen Armour, but having easier access to replacement and alternative parts is still nifty.\n\nThe big roleplaying gimmick of the Kongohki (which actually has rules and is tied to a mandatory Fate) is that their mindwipe seal will start to weaken, resulting in confusing flashbacks of their former life (which you can just come up with on the fly unless you / the GM actually want to plan this out from the beginning) until they finally remember everything.\n\nWhen a Kongohki uncovers his former self, one of three things happens: Either they go \"Screw old me!\" and move on, they start liking their past and essentially continue were they left off, or they just go insane and go on a rampage. The latter is the most common outcome. It can also happen that the new personality is so strong that it erases the old memories before they can completely surface.\n\nAlternative Kongohki types\n\nAside from the the meikyo/kimenkyo mirror divide like with Armour, there exist a few special types of Kongohki:\n\nClassy.\n\nHeavy Assault Units are the result of reversing the miniaturization process, creating Kongohki that can reach the height of a medium Armour while still retaining their Overdrive ability. Similar to Great Armours, they have several \"pilots\" in the form of additional mirrors with Asuras bound into them. Heavy Assault Units tend to have one or two primary mirrors, with any additional mirrors being mindwiped so hard they barely have any sentience left and just act as gunners.\n\nThe big problem that makes these units so rare is that the high amount of bound souls in close proximity makes it very easy for one of them to go crazy.\n\nKongohki Servants are soulless Kimeno Kongohki that are controlled by a Shinto agent - the Puppeteer - interfacing with them and taking over the body. This removes the whole \"bound Asura remembering his past\" business, but it comes with the drawback that the Shinto agent's own body will fall into a trance and be an easy target.\n\nSlendergohki?\n\nAside from these Servants, there are the Priesthood- and NPC-exclusive Priesthooh Kongohki who are only used as guards for the two Court's HQs and the occasional assassination mission. They are extremely powerful (with physical attributes in the 20s), not powered by Heart Engines and apparently not made or run with any kind of magic. They're totally actual robots, or drones depending on whether or not they are remotely controlled.\n\nThey have no visible weaponry, and their statblock just calls their weapons \"Left Arm\" and \"Right Arm\". One of these is a ranged weapon, and I like to imagine that they shoot laser beams.\n\nKongohki Construction\n\nThis is a quick one: Kongohki are created just like Armour with the addition of mental attributes and can also take advantage of all the nifty Kijin armour. This lets you get pretty crazy with the design, be it a spider Kongohki or a multi-armed wizardbot.\n\nThis is what happens if a crazy onmyojutsu sorcerer turns Asura for the sole purpose of getting a rad Kongohki body optimized for spellcasting. Can't blame him.\n\nThough Kongohki do have somewhat different options: They can have a beast-like head and don't have miniature versions of some of the really big Armour cannons.\n\nBottom Line\n\nKongohki are probably the most badass alternative to a resurrection spell. Who wants to go back in his old body that failed you before if you can start a new life as a speedster death robot? Sure, you won't remember anything from your previous life, but that will just make it easier to come up with flashbacks.\n\nNext Time : Ninja - can TBZ grimdark them up?\n\nOni\n\nposted by Doresh Original SA post\n\nIn Tenra Bansho Zero, mechanica aka cybernetics do eat your soul, but so does everything else if you don't change or adapt.\n\nTenra Bansho Zero\n\nThere's some North America in my Feudal Japan.\n\nOni\n\nJapanese Rob Liefeld knows how to draw feet.\n\nOni are the native race of Tenra. They are visually indistinguishable from a human aside from the 1-2 horn growing on their foreheads (which gave them their human name) and have a strong Ainu / Native American theme going on, with the latter being the more dominant one (they even live in tipis).\n\nLike with the Native Americans, the human colonists of Tenra didn't wait long to fall into the real-life murder hobo shtick of \"Kill the natives and take their land\" - which is especially dickish seeing how Oni welcomed them with open arms.\n\nThe murder hoboism went into overdrive once the humans discovered that Oni hearts are roughly spherical gems that continue to provide an endless supply of energy even after the Oni has died. Encased in steel, these gems have become the Heart Engines that keep Armours and Kongohki operational. With both now being mass-produced, the demand shot through the roof, bringing the Oni that much closer to extinction.\n\nMind you that the general human population doesn't know about the true nature of the Heart Engine. People just assume they are named that way because they act as the \"heart\" of the Armour/Kongohki. Lords and of course the Priesthood do know the truth, and they have spend several generations propagating the image of Oni as fiendish man-eaters who are just one of the many monsters on Tenra. Villagers are therefore more than willing to report any Oni village they discover, so the brave lord can rally troops and mercenaries to harvest some hear... err, I mean free the villagers from this menace.\n\nRun for your lifes! She will eat us all!\n\nWhile Oni are individually stronger than a human and can live up to 1,000 years, they have never been as numerous as humans, and female Oni only become pregnate every couple decades. Not to mention that they don't really have anything of use against massed gunfire. Or giant robots and crazy fast killbots fueled by the hearts of their fallen.\n\nWith this grim outlook, Oni either live in hidden village and have resigned to their fate, or they lead a desprate fight against overwhelming odds. Others actually cut off their horns and hide in human society, which is a high prize to pay for an Oni in more than one ways.\n\n(And as a little creepy plot idea, it is theoretically possible for an Oni's soul to remain in his heart and eventually awaken...)\n\nFaith\n\nOni are known as the Lu-Tirae in their own tongue, which means something along the line of \"supervisor\" or \"caretaker\". This is because their god Yi-yil or the God-Who-Left created them to watch over Tenra while he is away somwhere in space, or maybe another plane of existance.\n\nWhile he is gone, another being known as Dii-go the Earth-Speaker (who is apparently somewhere inside of Tenra) acts as Yi-yil's voice and messenger, speaking to the Oni through their heart gems. This has made the Oni quite spiritual, and they like giving themselves body tattoos using variations on the simple geometric glyphs representing their little pantheon (they don't have an actual alphabet).\n\nStill, the situation for the Oni is far from good, and Dii-go's voice has become muffled and pained over time, causing some of the younger Oni to ditch a faith that doesn't seem to be doing them any good.\n\nResonance\n\nResonance - also known as Tae Rayi - is the term used to describe the innate supernatural powers of the Oni, which all involve manipulating surrounding Sha energy. These powers can be split into Alu (\"heaven\") which uses the horn(s) and Dii (\"earth\") which uses the heart gem.\n\nAlu\n\nOni horns aren't just for decoration. As a gift from Yi-yil, their horns grant them telephatic abilities. They can read mind and speak to others mentally. This power however is waning, and the Oni are no longer able to communicate entire telepathically like they used to in the olden days.\n\nNevertheless, this rudimentary hive mind resulted in the Oni not thinking of themselves as individuals, but as a collective. They don't even have first and second person pronouns in their own language, and their names are more like job descriptions than anything else. Still, the near-extinction and the culture clash with the humans has made more and more Oni become more individualistic.\n\nAlu masters can also use these telepathic powers for mind bullets.\n\nDii\n\nThe heart gem of an Oni is his connection with the land of Tenra, granting him a form of telekinesis. This is pretty straightforward: You start out only being able to move a couple kilograms, until you're able to hurl small temples around. Dii Masters can also wreck Shikigami by absorbing the Sha energy that keeps them alive.\n\nSpecial Tae Rayi\n\nEvery once in a while, an Oni is born with special Sha manipulation abilities that go beyond Alu and Dii:\n\nMighu: The Calm : A healing spell.\n\nTse-Yi: The Cloak : Creates an anti-magic zone that actively pushes out Shikigami and Samurai.\n\nEjah: The Blinding Gale : This lets an Oni mimic a Kongohki's Overdrive ability (aka more speed and power), though the strain will cause damage.\n\nKu-Yau: Claws of Light : Attacks with a sword or claw made out of pure energy.\n\nHalf-Oni\n\nDespite the hatred and propaganda, love does occasionally bloom between Oni and human, creating these offsprings.\n\nThere isn't really a lot in the book about these guys, aside from the obvious \"Has troubles fitting in any culture\" stuff. I'd also assume that humans will try to kill them as they are hard to distinguish from Oni. They also seem to provide the only bishounen artwork in all of TBZ, which I'll safe for later.\n\nPowerwise, Half-Oni have access to basic Resonance powers (though they do have a heart gem like a real Oni), but they are incapable of beeing born with the above special abilities.\n\nThe Makuu Nindo Revolt\n\nAfter the schism, it turned out that things could become even worse for the Shinto Priesthood: An Oni monk of the Ebon Mountain sect going by his Buddhist name Makuu Nindo started a revolt in the state of Kikoku , which was not only the place on Tenra with the highest Oni population, but also the one where humans were the must sadistic.\n\nWith the help of a mysterious woman known as the Sleeping Girl who may or may not have been an incarnation of Dii-go himself, Makuu Nindo united the Oni - and even a couple humans who had enough of their lords and/or the Priesthood - to start a large-scale attempt to make Kikoku their own.\n\nJust needs some Scottish face painting.\n\nGreatly outnumbered and outgunned, it seemed that this revolt was short-lived - if it wasn't for the Two Month Night : Tenra's entire Sha flow just stopped without warning, leading to a massacre on Kikoku's forces as Armours and Kongohki ceased to work, Shikigami vanished and Samurai found themselves depowered. It's like an Oni-Waaaaagh.\n\nTo counter this sudden turn of events, the Priesthood sent one of their airships to blow the rebels to Kingdom Come. Unfortunately for them, an elite rebel team managed to capture the ship, resulting in one of the Priesthood's biggest blunder..\n\nWith Kikoku now in the hands of Oni, things are far from behing peaceful. The Oni and their human alliance still can't quite get over generations of bloodshed, the neighboring lords aren't exactly on good terms with them, and the Priesthood is apparently looking for a way to locate and nuke Dii-go's physical body because they really don't like people stealing their toys.\n\nNext Time : The Shinto Priesthood - playing a dick. Also hacking."
