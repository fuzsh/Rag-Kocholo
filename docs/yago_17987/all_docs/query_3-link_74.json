My wish is only to make life happier and more beautiful for those who will go and see my films of fantasy.\n\n„\n\n— Eiji Tsuburaya in Caper Magazine, 1962\n\nEiji Tsuburaya (円谷 英二, Tsuburaya Eiji), born Eiichi Tsumuraya (圓谷 英一, Tsumuraya Eiichi), was a Japanese special effects director and cameraman. Tsuburaya rose to fame primarily due to his work on Toho's war, kaiju, and science fiction films between the 1940s and 60s, when he pioneered various tokusatsu (special effects) techniques such as suitmation. Tsuburaya was one of the creators of Godzilla, who would go on to become Toho's most famous creation and an international icon.\n\nIn 1963, Tsuburaya founded his own special effects studio, Tsuburaya Productions, which would become known for producing the Ultra Series. Tsuburaya himself served as supervisor for several of the studio's early tokusatsu television series, including Ultra Q, Ultraman and Ultraseven. Toward the end of his life, Tsuburaya received honorary credit for directing or supervising the special effects on some of Toho's kaiju films, even though his responsibilities with his own company and later declining health limited his involvement. Tsuburaya's duties at Toho would be taken up by his understudies Sadamasa Arikawa and Teruyoshi Nakano following his death from a heart attack on January 25, 1970. Tsuburaya Productions continued operating under his family until 2007, when it was acquired by TYO Inc. On January 11, 2019, the Eiji Tsuburaya Museum opened in his hometown of Sukagawa, commemorating his life and films.[6]\n\nSelected filmography\n\nDirector of special effects\n\nThe White-Haired Fiend (1949) [uncredited][7]\n\nFlowers of Raccoon Palace (1949)[7]\n\nThe Rainbow Man (1949) [uncredited][7]\n\nThe Ghost Train (1949) [uncredited][7]\n\nThe Invisible Man Appears (1949)[7]\n\nGodzilla (1954)[b]\n\nInvisible Man (1954)[c]\n\nGodzilla Raids Again (1955)\n\nHalf Human (1955)[d]\n\nThe Legend of the White Serpent (1956)\n\nRodan (1956)[d]\n\nThrone of Blood (1957) [uncredited]\n\nThe Mysterians (1957)\n\nThe H-Man (1958)\n\nVaran (1958)\n\nMonkey Sun (1959)\n\nThe Three Treasures (1959)\n\nBattle in Outer Space (1959)\n\nThe Secret of the Telegian (1960)\n\nThe Human Vapor (1960)\n\nMothra (1961)\n\nThe Youth and His Amulet (1961)\n\nThe Last War (1961)\n\nGorath (1962)\n\nKing Kong vs. Godzilla (1962)\n\nMatango (1963)\n\nSamurai Pirate (1963)\n\nAtragon (1963)\n\nMothra vs. Godzilla (1964)\n\nDogora (1964)\n\nGhidorah, the Three-Headed Monster (1964)\n\nFrankenstein vs. Baragon (1965)\n\nInvasion of Astro-Monster (1965)\n\nThe Adventures of Takla Makan (1966) [uncredited]\n\nUltraman (TV 1966-1967) [episodes 18-19, uncredited]\n\nThe War of the Gargantuas (1966)\n\nEbirah, Horror of the Deep (1966) [ceremonial title]\n\nKing Kong Escapes (1967)\n\nLatitude Zero (1969)\n\nThe Nature of Japan and the Dreams of Japanese (1970)\n\nSupervisor\n\nUltra Q (TV 1966)\n\nUltraman (TV 1966-1967)\n\nMonster Booska (TV 1966-1967)\n\nUltraman (1967) [compilation film]\n\nUltraseven (TV 1967-1968)\n\nMighty Jack (TV 1968)\n\nFight!

Bin Furuya, the original Ultraman suit actor, portrays a character based on him in Nezura 1964 (2021).\n\nA scientist named Eiji Tsuburaya appears in the Challenge of the GoBots episode \"Destroy All Guardians.\" He creates the dinosaurs Ichigar, Kaitodan, and Jerigan - stand-ins for Godzilla, Rodan, and Baragon, respectively.\n\nDr. Ishiro Serizawa's costume from his first scene in Godzilla (2014) is a reference to Tsuburaya's typical work outfit.[16] Godzilla-kun also wears this outfit in the first special episode of Godziban, \"Film the Dream!\"\n\nIn 1962, Tsuburaya made preparations for a film adaptation of The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, the same story upon which his special effects debut Princess Kaguya (1935) was based. Though he shelved the project to work on King Kong vs. Godzilla that year, he penned a script for \"Princess Kaguya\" years later while in hospice in Izu, but passed away soon after.[2] His first son Hajime attempted to realize the idea in his stead, recruiting Hiroyasu Yamaura to write a screenplay and Yoshiyuki Kuroda to direct, but this too fell through after Hajime's own death in 1973 on the same day that the film was scheduled to begin shooting. Toho Pictures would ultimately produce an unrelated movie adaptation of The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter with Fuji TV, entitled Princess from the Moon (1987), which featured effects by Tsuburaya's protégé Teruyoshi Nakano.\n\nOfficial Eiji Tsuburaya site (Japanese and English)\n\nOfficial Tsuburaya Productions site\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nThis is a list of references for Eiji Tsuburaya.
