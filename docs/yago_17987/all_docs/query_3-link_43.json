They are great for having an exciting time in a lively space, but occasionally enjoying somewhat different, high-quality skewers in a higher-quality restaurant can also be wonderful. Here are some high-class skewer restaurants that are also recommended for mature dates. Couples can enjoy a comfortable time by themselves while eating these skewers one by oneâ€”skewers that are made with the techniques and care of expert chefs.",

        "text": "This restaurant lets guests enjoy a rich collection of food that is at its most delicious on that day and during that season, mainly in Omakase style. Kushitei's standard ingredients, such as foie gras and Japanese Black Wagyu beef, are fried in a healthy way in a light batter. The crispy, light tastes and the delicious flavors of the ingredients juicily spreading in one's mouth provide a moment of bliss.\n\nThe counter features special seats that stimulate the five senses and let guests gaze at skewers being fried before their eyes. In addition, they have private rooms that are enjoyable to use in groups, including family and friends. The ease of use in any situation is another point that will make guests happy. The drinks include wine and champagne that smoothly blend with the crispy, light batter and the delicious oil, further drawing out the delicious flavors of the seasonal skewers.\n\nThis fried food restaurant is located a 1-minute walk from JR Ebisu Station, on the 5th floor of a building without an elevator. This restaurant is truly worth being called an urban refuge, as it does not even have a signboard out front and can only be reached by the stairs. The Chef's Choice Course, which lets guests taste tempura and skewers at the same time, is highly recommended. Guests can fully enjoy a wide variety of fried foods served in small portions, as well as several individual food items that shine with casual ingenuity.\n\nThe restaurant interior, unified in black, has a plain wooden counter made of a single board. It has a dignified appearance similar to a high-class sushi restaurant, and the relaxing Japanese atmosphere soothes the mind. Lining up and sitting at the counters where one can enjoy a meal while gazing at the sight of the cooking, two guests will no doubt start a lively conversation. For guests who want to spend a more comfortable time, highly private individual rooms are recommended.\n\nA skewer and wine restaurant located a 3-minute walk from JR Shinjuku Station. The skewer cuts created by the owner chef, who served as the head chef at the famous Osaka restaurant Rokukakutei, have luxurious flavors that let guests feel the seasons and surprises in each skewer. They are carefully skewed with no time or effort spared and are made with light flavors. The Omakase Course, served with 20 original skewers at the guests' pace, is a feast that even female guests can casually enjoy.\n\nThis retro yet modern space with downlights gently shining on it has a chic, cool, and mature atmosphere. They have mainly spacious counter seats as well as relaxing table seats. Guests can enjoy talking with the chef and gazing at the dynamic sight of the cooking. One by one, these scenes color the high-quality time spent with that special someone. The rare wine, which can be enjoyed at reasonable prices, can't be missed.\n\nIt is a 1-minute walk from Roppongi Station on the Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line. Located in a brilliant corner of this big city, this Japanese restaurant has an impressive Zen-style gate. Every day, the chefs go to Tsukiji Market themselves to carefully select seasonal ingredients. The restaurant is lined with various colorful and vivid foods that utilize the natural flavors of the ingredients. Among them, the skewers are masterpieces with an excellent reputation and are lightly seasoned so guests can fully enjoy the flavors packed into the ingredients. Between skewers, be sure to enjoy the steamed egg custard (\"chawanmushi\") and boiled foods.\n\nWhen guests open the door, they will find a relaxing space with a concentrated Japanese essence spreading out before their eyes. The restaurant only has 26 seats at the U-shaped counter located in its center, giving guests the feeling that they have been invited to a special space. The dynamic performance of the chefs frying and serving skewers before one's eyes is a true highlight. Freshly fried skewers are served one by one before guests' eyes match their pace. Enjoy delicious flavors without missing the timing of the serving.\n\nLocated a 10-minute walk from Shirokanedai Station, this skewer restaurant is in a location where it quietly melts into the calm townscape. The production by Mr. Minoru Hasegawa transforms skewers, which have a strong image as a low-brow food, into chic and high-quality courses. The 18 skewers, which use first-class ingredients, have new sensational flavors that are created with superior techniques and sense. The skewer courses start with the Japanese Tosa Brown Beef Tenderloin, with delicious red meat flavors that spread in one's mouth with every bite."
