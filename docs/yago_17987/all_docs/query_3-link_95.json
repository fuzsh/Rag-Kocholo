The name “M. Night Shyamalan” is like creative kryptonite in 2010, synonymous with unadulterated crap like The Happening, Lady in the Water, and his latest motion picture affront, The Last Airbender. So, rest assured that all he had to do with this otherwise intriguing thriller was craft the story and pay the bills. He left the actual scriptwriting and directing to others… and it shows. As a simple tale of four people trapped in an elevator — and the suicide/crime scene surrounding their involvement — the narrative is a tad too pat… Signs pat. But John Erick Dowdle does such a good job of setting up suspense and delivering payoffs that we ignore the cosmic coincidences and settle in for some decent scares. Luckily, this Devil delivers. Bill Gibron\n\nFilm: Robo-Geisha\n\nDirector: Noboru Iguchi\n\nCast: Aya Kiguchi, Hitomi Hasebe, Takumi Saito, Taro Shigaki, Etsuko Ikuta, Suzuki Matsuo, Naoto Takenaka\n\nImage: http://images.popmatters.com/news_art/r/robo_geisha.jpg\n\nDisplay as: List\n\nList number: 9\n\nDisplay Width: 200Robo-Geisha\n\nFunimation Entertainment\n\nYou generally don’t win Academy Awards for movies which feature lines like “She has a machine gun in her ass!”, but there are other rewards, like creating the funniest midnight movie ever. The plot: a crooked industrialist kidnaps geishas and surgically transforms them into robotic assassins as part of his plan to destroy Japanese national identity by blowing up Mount Fuji. If you’re still with me you’ll probably appreciate Robo-Geisha, a film which has too much of everything including blood splatter, hysterically bad dialogue, even worse dubbing, and action scenes which achieve new heights (or sink to new depths) of absurdity. It’s all presented in a perfectly timed succession of gags by director Noboru Iguchi who keeps you laughing so hard you barely have a chance to breathe. Sarah Boslaugh\n\nFilm: Jackass 3D\n\nDirector: Jeff Tremaine\n\nCast: Johnny Knoxville, Bam Margera, Chris Pontius, Steve-O, Ryan Dunn, Dave England, Jason “Wee Man” Acuña, Preston Lacy, Ehren McGhehey\n\nImage: http://images.popmatters.com/blog_art/j/jackass3dposter.jpg\n\nReview: http://ded5626.inmotionhosting.com/~popmat6/pm/post/132321-the-50-million-joys-of-jackass/\n\nDisplay as: List\n\nList number: 8\n\nDisplay Width: 200Jackass 3D\n\nParamount\n\nMaybe it’s the four years between installments. Perhaps the wealth of imitators, both professional and pimping themselves on the Web, have romanticized the original’s raunchy “talents”. It could be the inherent humor — no matter how juvenile and sophomoric — of watching grown men risk life, limb, and reputation in the service of some very salacious slapstick. With the new gimmick patina of 3D pushing the prurience right up and into our faces, Johnny Knoxville and his merry band of idiots reminded us that some brands of baser wit never go completely out of style. While we may feel horrible for laughing so hard, the key is that we are laughing. And since they are having such a seemingly good time, we can’t help but join in on the jaundiced festivities. Bill Gibron\n\nFilm: Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale\n\nDirector: Jalmari Helander\n\nCast: Tommi Korpela, Per Christian Ellefsen, Ville Virtanen, Jorma Tommila, Jonathan Hutchings, Onni Tommila\n\nImage: http://images.popmatters.com/blog_art/r/rareexports2.jpg\n\nReview: http://ded5626.inmotionhosting.com/~popmat6/pm/post/134348-you-better-watch-out-rare-exports-a-christmas-tale/\n\nDisplay as: List\n\nList number: 7\n\nDisplay Width: 200Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale\n\nOscilloscope Laboratories\n\nRare Exports is the best unholy Christmas creation ever. It’s the perfect combination of old world superstition and new age satire. Buried in between the animal carcasses, musty slaughterhouses, and Spartan living condition is still a child’s vivid imagination, only this time, the visions aren’t of candy and kindness, but of a horned demon with elf-like minions that may or may not resemble anorexic old men. Rare Exports wants to argue that the real meaning of Santa was always as an underage cautionary tale, a coal in the stocking vs. presents by the fire kind of behavioral modification. In this case, the wee ones don’t just need to be “good for goodness’s” sake, but a shout-out to God (or any other benevolent deity) might help the Hellish cause as well. Bill Gibron\n\nFilm: Machete\n\nDirector: Robert Rodriguez\n\nCast: Danny Trejo, Steven Seagal, Michelle Rodriguez, Jeff Fahey, Cheech Marin, Lindsay Lohan, Don Johnson, Jessica Alba, Robert De Niro\n\nImage: http://images.popmatters.com/blog_art/m/macheteposter2.jpg\n\nReview: http://ded5626.inmotionhosting.com/~popmat6/pm/review/130570-machete/\n\nDisplay as: List\n\nList number: 6\n\nDisplay Width: 200 Machete\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nMachete first appeared on the big screen during Easter weekend 2007. The trailer, based on Robert Rodriguez’s script (and star vehicle for Danny Trejo),was one of several sideline gags accompanyingPlanet Terror and Death Proof. Yet somehow, those few minutes of Machete seemed more grindhouse than Grindhouse. Emerging as a feature in fall 2010 with star Trejo and trashy aesthetic intact, the vigilante tale is essentially a checklist of guilty pleasures. A strung-out Lindsay Lohan dons a habit. Jessica Alba and Michelle Rodriguez enforce justice with the power of limitless sex appeal. Jeff Fahey delivers his lines with a preternatural awareness of how a B-movie actor should speak. Gory set pieces punctuate the plot and occasionally illustrate heretofore cinematically unexplored functions of human anatomy. Presiding over all of this is genre film powerhouse Trejo — long in the wings and now a star. Trejo’s face is neither fresh nor new, but it is without a doubt that of an avenging action hero. Thomas Britt\n\n5 – 1\n\nFilm: For Colored Girls\n\nDirector: Tyler Perry\n\nCast: Janet Jackson, Thandie Newton, Whoopi Goldberg, Loretta Devine, Anika Noni Rose, Kimberly Elise, Kerry Washington, Phylicia Rashad\n\nImage: http://images.popmatters.com/film_art/c/coloredgirls-poster.jpg\n\nReview: http://ded5626.inmotionhosting.com/~popmat6/pm/review/133156-for-colored-girls/\n\nDisplay as: List\n\nList number: 5\n\nDisplay Width: 200For Colored Girls\n\nLionsgate\n\nFor those familiar with Tyler Perry’s previous films, this adaptation will not be a surprise. The material intrinsically plays into the writer’s well known frame of retro-reference, and while not as bawdy and burlesque as his other works, it sums up his strategies surprisingly well. At his core, Perry is a showman, someone who understands the inherent value in melodrama, manipulation, and most importantly, music. His theatrical pieces are like revivals, simplistic Bible and relationship messages measured out in cliche filled conversations and powerful gospel songs. In the case of For Colored Girls, poems are now the tunes. Indeed, this adaptation is unusual in that it feels like a musical without a score. In the movie translation of the title, Perry never lays a foundation for the concept. He just sets up his story, introduces his cast, and then delivers the devastating insights. Bill Gibron\n\nFilm: Hot Tub Time Machine\n\nDirector: Steve Pink\n\nCast: John Cusack, Rob Corddry, Craig Robinson, Clark Duke, Chevy Chase, Collette Wolfe, Crispin Glover, Lizzy Caplan\n\nImage: http://images.popmatters.com/news_art/h/hot-tub-time-poster.jpg\n\nRevie: http://ded5626.inmotionhosting.com/~popmat6/pm/review/123020-hot-tub-time-machine/\n\nDisplay as: List\n\nList number: 4\n\nDisplay Width: 200 Hot Tub Time Machine\n\nMGM\n\nThe title says it all. Hot Tub Time Machine is a high-concept comedy that’s completely aware of its utter silliness, and mostly embraces it. Getting former teen icon John Cusack to tweak his ’80s roles by playing a dissatisfied fortysomething who travels back in time with his buddies to a rockin’ Greed decade ski resort was great. But what really makes the movie work is the rest of the cast of friends. The always-dependable Craig Robinson, the perfectly-cast Rob Corddry as the pompous ass, and Clark Duke in a breakout performance as the young nephew who wasn’t alive in the ’80s. What makes the movie a guilty pleasure are its missteps, like too many cheap jokes about fashion and music and the casual homophobia. There’s also the uselessness of Chevy Chase’s hot tub repairman, not to mention the painfully forced romantic subplot between Cusack and Lizzy Caplan. But the real joy of Hot Tub Time Machine comes from its shameless tweaking of time travel cliches, particularly those found in Back to the Future. The kicker is seeing Marty McFly’s Back to the Future dad, Crispin Glover, as a grumpy one-armed bellhop in the present who has both arms and a sunny attitude in the past. Chris Conaton\n\nFilm: The Book of Eli\n\nDirector: Albert Hughes, Allen Hughes\n\nCast: Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman, Mila Kunis, Ray Stevenson, Jennifer Beals\n\nImage: http://images.popmatters.com/news_art/b/book-of-eli-poster.jpg\n\nReview: http://ded5626.inmotionhosting.com/~popmat6/pm/review/119050-the-book-of-eli/\n\nDisplay as: List\n\nList number: 3\n\nDisplay Width: 200The Book of Eli\n\nWarner Brothers\n\nIf The Road Warrior was a morality play that met up with M. Night Shayamalan (when he made quality films), the end result would be The Book of Eli. A simple concept of a man on a mission to preserve a book that will save post-nuclear holocaust mankind, The Book of Eli’s screenwriter Gary Whitta endows his tale with several surprises and well-written roles that don’t play like stock characters. Denzel Washington stars as Eli, the aforementioned man whose aforementioned mission is complicated by Carnegie (Gary Oldman), an opportunistic warlord / Wild West throwback who has seized power in one of the world’s last thriving outposts and wants the book for his own ends. With top-shelf action scenes choreographed by martial artist Jeff Imada and equally top-notch performances from the always-solid Washington and Oldman and a strong showing by Mila Kunis (now receiving raves for her pirouette-turn in Black Swan), The Book of Eli’s surprise twist of an ending jettisons the film into the rare category of “guilty pleasure” viewing minus the guilt. Lana Cooper\n\nFilm: Kick-Ass\n\nDirector: Matthew Vaughn\n\nCast: Aaron Johnson, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Chloë Grace Moretz, Nicolas Cage, Mark Strong\n\nImage: http://images.popmatters.com/news_art/k/kick-ass-poster.jpg\n\nReview: http://ded5626.inmotionhosting.com/~popmat6/pm/post/129003-taking-names-and-chewing-geek-gum-kick-ass/\n\nDisplay as: List\n\nList number: 2\n\nDisplay Width: 200Kick-Ass\n\nUniversal\n\nIt should have been more popular. Instead of arguing over the controversial nature of a clearly fictional tween assassin, cults and online shrines should be speaking out about their love for Hit-Girl’s heroism. As an attempt to both mimic and mock the superhero ethic, as a warm love letter to the genre and another noted installment in same, this more than meta geek out should have been the Spring’s break out hit. Instead, its invention and excitement were moderated by a proto-PC desire to turn every aspect of the movie into a full blown debate. Three decades ago, kids could ninja their way through a lame family film experience and no one really cared. Add in a serious subtext and some curse words, and suddenly it’s time to readjust one’s moral compass. Too bad they missed the fantastic forest for the talking point trees.
