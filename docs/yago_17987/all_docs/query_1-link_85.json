        "text": "NSFW: art both imitates and is imitated by life in The Wild Hunt; this suspense/thriller dives into the world of LARP (live action role-playing) with actual LARPers as background actors.\n\nWe liked John Travolta in the first From Paris With Love trailer, but this red band trailer with NSFW language shows how out of his mind his character Wax is; totally un-PC, but totally worth it.\n\nTotally, utterly NSFW: this Hit Girl teaser trailer for Kick-Ass is truly red band (plus a flash of purple), with plenty of over-the-top (and under the belt) gun and sword violence.\n\nNSFW: it’s a good thing that this debut trailer for Kane & Lynch 2 is deliberately low quality; if Lynch’s flashbacks got any more visceral, we’d have to wipe the blood off our monitor.\n\nNSFW: Spartacus: Blood and Sand’s mix of live action and graphic novel violence may be an obvious knock-off of 300, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing; it premieres 1/22/2010 on Starz.\n\nExtremely NSFW: Paranormal Activities: Deleted Scenes could have done without the raunchy scene in the middle, but it’s otherwise a hilarious look at what ghosts do in their off-time.\n\nAmerica may have healthcare issues, but thank Miyamato that you’re not being pilled and probed by Nintendo: Dr. Mario with Lyrics is a NSFW musical skit about STDs in the ER.\n\nNSFW: we admit that Smokin’ Aces 2: Assassins’ Ball is sexy, somewhat dumb fun, but anyone who liked the original is going to love this new trailer; the prequel arrives on DVD 1/19.\n\nNSFW: Still can’t wrap your noggin’ around Google Wave? This Pulp Fiction mashup by Joe Sabia should “bang” some sense into your head; it’s basically chat with 72 point font and pictures.\n\nSlightly NSFW: The voice acting is hammy and it starts off slow, but The Seafarer redeems itself in the second half: think giant robots with laser beams, machine guns and cannons.\n\nNSFW: Like Austin Powers meets Ghost in the Shell meets every B-horror flick ever created, Robo-Geisha is so over-the-top in terms of ways to die it’s almost ensured a cult following.\n\nNSFW: Eclectic Method shows off their epic remixing skills with the Tarantino Mixtape; true to his films, it’s a brilliant mix of violence, bad behavior and quirky dialogue. Thanks, Jake!\n\nNSFW x a billion: One-Eyed Monster stars porn star Ron Jeremy in a horror/comedy flick about a certain famous “member”; folks, do not watch this anywhere near children.\n\nNSFW, NS for ladies and definitely NS for anyone with a brain, Sexy Lightsaber Fight has little going for it other than two chicks losing their clothing, which for some is more than enough."
