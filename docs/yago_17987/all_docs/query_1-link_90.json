The sci-fi mech story line etc. I was wonder if anyone had any good recommendations on sci-fi mech kind of movies or TV shows that I can watch on DVD from Netflix or Netflix instant streaming? Thanks. </div></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR><BR>Macross plus<BR><BR>robotech movie set in the future of that universe)<BR><BR><BR>It is a bit trippy but neon genesis evangellion has robot goodness.<BR><BR>I am not super super into anime enough to give you really good recommendations though.\n\nOr you can support Steve Yun and watch \"Robotech: the Shadow Chronicals\"<BR><BR>Other Mecha series of note: The Gundam series. There's a cojillion of these, all over the quality range. I rather enjoyed the recent Gundam 00 series.<BR><BR>Macross Frontier is another recent series. It is the latest sequel to the original macross, Macross+, etc. It is NOT liscenced in the US, and is unlikely to EVER be liscenced (Thank you Carl Macek, may you DIAF). As such, the only real way you can get it is as fan subs. IIRC this is legal, as long as you get rid of the files if it ever gets liscenced in the US, or buy the DVD. IMO Frontier is an excellent series, with music by Yoko Kanno, and some of the best animation ever. It is EXTREMELY thick with the fan-service, however, but eh. . .\n\nTo the OP:<BR>I third a recommendation of the Gundam series. There's more Gundam series than there are Star Trek at this point, grab a few and see if you like them.<BR><BR>If you liked the sci-fi part of Robotech, I recommend the Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex series as well. It's 2 series of ~24 episodes each.<BR><BR>For a military-styled mecha, I recommend Full Metal Panic. The 1st and 3rd series are what I'd recommend, the 2nd is a hilarious comedy.<BR><BR>If you can find it (it's quite old), Gasaraki was a nice weird mecha anime.<BR><BLOCKQUOTE class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\"><div class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote-title\">quote:</div><div class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote-content\">Originally posted by DeedlitCryogenic:<BR>IIRC this is legal, as long as you get rid of the files if it ever gets liscenced in the US, or buy the DVD. </div></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>LOL, downloading fansubs isn't within the bounds of the law by any stretch of the imagination. All the stuff you said after 'as long as' is basically what the anime community has come up with as morally acceptable. Download away, buy what you can afford, is how I do things."
