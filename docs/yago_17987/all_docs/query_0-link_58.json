        "text": "FISHY DISHY!\n\nBullied waitress Keiko (Rina Takeda) is forced to call on her martial arts skills when a vengeful former drug lab employee infects a sushi banquet with a regeneration serum, which causes the fishy delicacies to sprout wings and savage teeth, and turns him into a giant axe-wielding tuna. Can Keiko, a former sushi chef (Shigeru Matsuzaki) and an acid-spitting egg roll save the suits before they all turn into sashimi-spewing zombies?\n\nHOLY FLYING TUNA ROLL!\n\nThis goofy caper, inspired by Piranha 3D and 1978’s Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, comes from the warped imagination of Noburo Iguchi (Robo-Geisha, The ABCs of Death), whose hyper camerawork lets the comical cartoon gore flow, while Takeda executes the stunt scenes with great bravado. It’s all silly, puerile fun and if it weren’t for the odd breast shot, this zom-com could almost be an episode of Power Rangers Megaforce. And if you watch the English dubbed version, included in this release, the humour and visual gags are also strangely reminiscent of the cult late-1970s TV show, Monkey.\n\nTHE VERDICT\n\nA might-see.\n\nOut on Blu-ray and DVD in the UK from Monster Pictures.\n\n[youtube:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma3jia7kO3E%5D"
