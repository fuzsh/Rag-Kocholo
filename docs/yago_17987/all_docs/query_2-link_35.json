From the same team that brought us the amazing MACHINE GIRL and the visual effects wizards behing TOKYO GORE POLICE comes ROBOGEISHA which looks like a true wonder to behold. Just wait till you see FRIED SHRIMP and HIP KATANA. This is the sort of mind bending lunacy that I have come to covet. Japan is indeed a magical island... to produce stuff like this and Miyazaki... amazing."
