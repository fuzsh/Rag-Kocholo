(Japanese audio with English subtitles) - 16:51 in HD!\n\n• Original Japanese trailer (Japanese audio with English subtitles) - 2:02 in HD!\n\n• 8 Funimation Previews\n\nBitrate:\n\nDescription: The twisted geniuses behind The Machine Girl and Tokyo Gore Police present a tale of sibling rivalry, chainsaw faces, machine gun boobs, and butt blades. Kikuke is a geisha known for her glamour and grace. Yoshie is her abused sister, banished to the shadows. When a mysterious corporation transforms their soft bodies into murderous machines, the rival vixens rush toward an ultraviolent final confrontation.\n\nThe Film:\n\nThe concept of a robotic geisha is unquestionably a stroke of genius. Clearly, there has always been something other worldly and automaton-like about this unique breed of Japanese woman – and this is aside from their sinister, passively servile relations with men. This idea, paired with the acclaimed director of similarly-themed comedy horror The Machine Girl, seems like a marriage made in gonzo Japanarama heaven.\n\nIt’s glorious for a while. The central, rather cute, set up sees two young, rival sisters – one geisha (Hitomi Hasebe), one geisha’s assistant (Aya Kiguchi) - competing for their tyrannical master’s attention (played with indifference by Saitô). He’s a young steel baron – a perfect bachelor, if you ignore his megalomaniacal tendencies. But love is illogical, and these two girls begin a game of one-upmanship in the surgery room. The metal in their bodies would certainly be a risk to airport security, and their mother would probably wish the sisters had just got that lip, tongue and entire face piercing after all.\n\nExcerpt from James Benefield at Eye For Film located HERE\n\n“Machine Girl” director Iguchi Noboru returns with more unfettered craziness in the form of “Robo Geisha”, a film which has already become somewhat of a cult sensation after its jaw dropping trailer notched up an incredible number of internet views. Aiming to take the new wave of Japanese mayhem cinema to the next level, the film features special effects from “Tokyo Gore Police” and “Vampire Girl vs. Frankenstein Girl” director Nishimura Yoshihiro. As if the presence of two such genre masterminds wasn’t enough, the film features gorgeous gravure idol Kiguchi Aya in the lead, with Hasebe Hitomi (“Battle Royale 2”) as her sister and chief rival.\n\nExcerpt from James Mudge at Beyond Hollywood located HERE Image : NOTE: The below Blu-ray captures were taken directly from the Blu-ray disc.\n\nRoboGeisha was shot on HD but doesn't really excel visually on Blu-ray. This is a single-layered transfer with a lowish bitrate and has some decent moments of detail and outdoor sequences are more impressive but there is some softness that I would have expected the high-definition to overcome. Colors seem brighter and truer than SD and there is no blockiness. Contrast, however, is not a premium levels. There are plenty of effects in RoboGeisha and although not always blending in well - the 1080P transfer seems to replicate the production intent with costumes and quick cuts. Perhaps I am being too harsh and this may very well be as good as this movie can look in the newer format. It's hard to be sure. RoboGeisha's frequent eye-candy visuals keep your eyes attentive but there isn't any depth to rate it especially high. It looks okay - better than SD could relate but not anywhere near the best Blu-ray has to offer. I think tighter image quality would actually benefit the film expression as it is a kind of retina-feast with less in the way of plot or character development.\n\nCLICK EACH BLU-RAY CAPTURE TO SEE ALL IMAGES IN FULL 1920X1080 RESOLUTION\n\nAudio :\n\nThere is an untested English DUB via a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track at 2137 kbps and the original Japanese is also offered in lossless but only 2.0 channel stereo at a measly 622 kbps. Bad choice - although the latter does seem to be the 'default'. The audio was reasonably unremarkable with effect sounds showing a shade of bass depth - but often feeling flat. The track transfer is nothing special. There are optional English subtitles and m\n\ny Momitsu has identified it as being a region 'A'-locked.\n\nExtras :\n\nExtras consist of the 15-minute RoboGeisha 'spin-off' (we are warned to watch the feature first - but I can't see why - unless it gves away the ass-wielding sword sequence). It is entitled Fearsome Geisha Corps - Go to Hell!. A great title but less 'umphhh' than the main film although running similar themes - will less production effects. It has Japanese audio with English subtitles and is in HD. We also get an encouragingly fertile original Japanese trailer lasting 2:02 and, what I would deem as the best extra - 8 Funimation previews. It seems as though some good stuff is coming down the pike.\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\nThe concept of these films always seems better than the execution but it is so amusing to see how many sexual bents can be included without an ounce of genitalia... or any nudity at all (in keeping with Japan's strict policy of such). But there is plenty of blood-splattering violence. They hint around at the typical perversions; pretty Japanese girls as nurses (being covered in an ejaculate-like substance - in this case, breast milk), or schoolgirls in uniform (looking up their skirts), bondage - though mostly for the male baddies etc. This is pretty cheap but the exploitation can still have some amusement. There continues a parody/mocking of the 'Pink' genre films. Although this isn't quite as good as - The Machine Girl - it has attracted some attention from genre-specific fans seeking something unique and playful. Getting 'in the mood' for this is simple enough. The Blu-ray ain't world class - but is a cool way to indulge in the wacky, comic book-style, antics of RoboGeisha - if you are keen. Otherwise, you are not missing much at all here.\n\nGary Tooze\n\nNovember 11th, 2010"
