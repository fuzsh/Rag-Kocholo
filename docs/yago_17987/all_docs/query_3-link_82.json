        "text": "Mashin Sentai Kiramager (translated as meaning Machine Task Force Sparkling Rangers) is the 44th entry of Super Sentai. Its main motifs are gemstones and vehicles. The series also makes many references to Middle Eastern, Indian, Egyptian and Norse mythology.\n\nPlease provide your own knowledge to this page if possible. Descriptions written in italics are speculation and not solid facts.\n\nA gemstone (also known as a gem, jewel, or precious stone) is a piece of mineral crystal which is cut and polished for use in jewelry or other adornments. Interestingly, some materials that are referred to as gemstones are not actually crystals or even rocks at all.\n\nEtymology\n\nMashin, while it could be based on the English word \"machine\", may also be based on a Japanese word meaning \"sorcery\".\n\nKiramager appears to be based on the Japanese word kirameki, meaning \"sparkling\".\n\nThe Kiramagers[]\n\nEach of the Kiramagers are based on a specific gemstone. They each represent a different occupation, which is the basis of their role call written in a combination of Japanese and English. They all exhibit high levels of Kiramental (combination of kiramai and mental), a powerful magic that turns their occupational skills into superhuman abilities.\n\nThe names of the Kiramagers are possibly based on significant figures from their profession, especially from Japan's past. Also, their surnames seem to be ironic insults against their occupation. The Japanese word in their role calls also seem to end in the sound \"-ki\".\n\nJuru Atsuta[]\n\nAlias: KiramaiRed, Creation Warrior\n\nGemstone Basis: Ruby\n\nThe ruby is a blood-red gemstone formed from the chemical compound aluminum oxide or corundum. Its name comes from the Latin word ruber, meaning \"red\". The red coloring comes from the presence of the chemical element chromium.\n\nProfession: Artist\n\nJuru's Kiramental gives him the ability to manipulate reality by bringing his drawings to life.\n\nRoll Call: Hirameki Sparkling\n\nHirameki can be translated as \"insight\" or \"inspiration\". Juru's roll call can therefore be translated as meaning The Sparkling Inspiration.\n\nEtymology\n\nJuru may come from the Japanese pronunciation of the word \"jewel\".\n\nAtsuta contains atsu, which means \"passion\" in Japanese.\n\nJuru's given name could be based on the unit of energy joule, as a reference to its inventor James Prescott Joule.\n\nTametomo Imizu[]\n\nAlias: KiramaiYellow, Shooting Warrior\n\nGemstone Basis: Topaz\n\nTopaz is a yellow-colored gemstone formed from a mixture of aluminum and fluorine. Its name comes from Topazios, the Greek name for St. John's Island in the Red Sea where a yellow crystal (now believed to be peridot) was mined in ancient times.\n\nProfession: E-sports Player\n\nTametomo's Kiramental translates his video game expertise into precise shooting. He therefore serves as the Kiramager's expert on firearms and long-range combat.\n\nRoll Call: Michibiki Shooting\n\nMichibiki can be translated to meaning \"guidance\" or \"leading\". Tametomo's roll call can therefore be translated as \"The Guided Shooting\".\n\nEtymology\n\nTametomo's given name is translated from kanji as \"For the dawn\".\n\nImizu is a lesser used surname that means \"shooting the water\". Attacking water is ultimately pointless, so it insults Tametomo's skill with firearms.\n\nKiramaiYellow's given name is likely a reference to Minamoto no Tametomo, a legendary Japanese samurai who was famous for his archery skills.\n\nSena Hayami[]\n\nAlias: KiramaiGreen, Speed Warrior\n\nGemstone Basis: Emerald\n\nEmerald is a green-colored gemstone that is a variety of beryl colored green by chromium and/or vanadium. Its name comes from the French word esmeraude, which derives from the Ancient Greek smaragdos, meaning \"green gem\".\n\nProfession: Athlete\n\nSena is a track runner whose Kiramental allows her to run at superhuman speeds for long periods of time without tiring. She is therefore the fastest of the Kiramagers.\n\nRoll Call: Totsugeki Lightning\n\nTotsugeki can be translated as \"assault\", \"charge\" or \"sudden attack\". Sena's roll call can therefore be translated as \"The Lightning Assault\".\n\nEtymology\n\nSena as a feminine name could be translated as \"distinguished world\", which could reference her being a celebrity.\n\nSena's surname seems to be based on \"hayai\", a Japanese word meaning fast. Her surname also translates as meaning \"early sight\". Her surname hints that the average person is unable to see Sena as anything more than a good athlete.\n\nSena's given name may be a reference to Lady Tsukiyama (who was nicknamed Sena prior to getting married), a Japanese noble and aristocrat from the Sengoku period.\n\nThe RangerWiki gives two other possible sources for her first name. One is Ayrton Senna, a Brazilian race car driver. The other is the fictional character Sena Kobayakawa from the series Eyeshield 21, which is itself sports-themed.\n\nShiguru Oshikiri[]\n\nAlias: KiramaiBlue, Slashing Warrior\n\nGemstone Basis: Sapphire\n\nSapphire is a blue-colored gemstone that is a variety of the mineral corundum. The blue coloring can come from many different elements like iron, titanium, and magnesium. Its name comes from the Greek word sappheiros, meaning \"blue stone\".\n\nInterestingly, rubies and sapphires are actually the same crystal differentiated only by color. This may explain Shiguru's friendship with Juru.\n\nProfession: Actor\n\nShiguru works as a professional actor who primarily works on films involving swordfighting. His Kiramental allows these skills to manifest in the real world, making him the Kiramager's expert in close-range combat.\n\nRoll Call: Kissaki Unstoppable\n\nKissaki is a Japanese term referring to the tip of a Japanese sword. Shiguru's roll call can therefore be translated as meaning \"The Unstoppable Edge\".\n\nEtymology\n\nShiguru's given name appears to be a misspelling of the given name Shigeru, but the possible theme naming seems to say otherwise. TV Tropes says that his name may be derived from Siguror, an alternative name for the Norse hero Siegfried.\n\nOshikiri can be translated as meaning \"straw cutter\". Shiguru isn't actually a great swordsman, but rather an actor who uses a tough façade to give people that impression.\n\nSayo Ooharu[]\n\nAlias: KiramaiPink, Healing Warrior\n\nGemstone Basis: Rhodolite (RangerWiki)\n\nRhodolite is a rose-pink gemstone that is a variety of pyrope, a mineral in the garnet group. The name comes from the Greek root \"rhodon\", meaning \"rose-like\".\n\nProfession: Nurse\n\nA nurse is defined as a person trained to care for those who are sick, especially in a hospital. Sayo's Kiramental expands this into serving as the team's healer and emotional support.\n\nWhile nurses can be any gender, popular culture associates them as female. This could explain Sayo's role as the team's most feminine member.\n\nRoll Call: Tesabaki Incredible\n\nTesabaki can be translated as meaning \"handling\" or \"manipulation\". Sayo's roll call can therefore be translated as \"Incredible Dexterity\".\n\nEtymology\n\nSayo's given name can mean \"born at night\". As a standard word, it can mean \"evening\".\n\nSayo's surname is written using kanji that mean \"great healing\". However, another possible writing of her name gives it the meaning \"big stretch\". This presents the idea that people overestimate Sayo's abilities.\n\nSayo's surname is also a possible reference to the film The Life of Oharu.\n\nTakamichi Crystalia[]\n\nAlias: KiramaiSilver, Shining Kiramai Stone\n\nGemstone Basis: Diamond\n\nDiamonds are a broad category of gemstones. While coming in a variety of colors, they are most commonly known as pearly white or silver. The name comes from the Greek word \"adamas\", meaning unbreakable.\n\nDiamonds are one of the most sought after gemstones in the world, which explains Takamichi's status as the Sixth Ranger of Kiramager.\n\nProfession: Treasure Hunter\n\nRoll Call: Tsuranuki Shining\n\nTsuranuki can be translated as meaning \"Piercing\" or \"Penetrate\". Takamichi's roll call can therefore be translated as \"The Shining Breakthrough\".\n\nEtymology\n\nTakamichi's given name means \"treasure path\". This is keeping his treasure hunter theme going strong.\n\nHanaya Akujiki[]\n\nCreated and owned by GamepadtheDreamer\n\nAlias: KiramaiJade, Elemental Warrior\n\nGemstone Basis: Jade\n\nJade is an ornamental mineral that actually can refer to either nephrite or jadeite. It is most commonly known as being a unique shade green, though they can also be yellow or white. The name heals from the Spanish term piedra de ijadam meaning \"loin stone\", which refers to the ancient belief that jade could cure illnesses in the loins and kidneys. Jade is exceptionally special in Chinese and Mexican culture.\n\nProfession: Chef\n\nHanaya's Kiramental turns her cooking skills into elemental manipulation, controlling fire, water, air, electricity, and ice.\n\nRoll Call: Kabayaki Delicious\n\nKabayaki is a specific type of preparation used for cooking fish in Japan.\n\nEtymology\n\nHanaya's given name translates to \"excellent, fine\". Fine is a common word used by food critics when referencing a good dish.\n\nHanaya's surname translates to \"eating inferior food\". This is a major component of Hanaya's character, the fact that she actually uses her Kiramental to get away with not putting all her effort into making good food.\n\nHanaya's first name is derived from Hanaya Yohei, the inventor of modern day Tokyo-style nigiri sushi.\n\nCyril Yogiri[]\n\nCreated and owned by GamepadtheDreamer\n\nAlias: KiramaiGarnet, Magical Warrior\n\nGemstone Basis: Garnet\n\nGarnet is a group of silicate minerals which have been used as gemstones since the Bronze Age. The word comes from the Middle English word \"gernet\", meaning 'dark red'.\n\nProfession: Stage Magician\n\nRoll Call: Maho-teki Wonder\n\nMaho-teki can be translated as meaning \"magical\". Cyril's roll call can therefore be translated as \"The Magical Wonder\".\n\nEtymology\n\nCyril is a masculine given name of Greek origin which meaning 'lord' or 'master'.\n\nCyril's surname is written using kanji meaning 'night mist'.\n\nCyril's given name is derived from Cyril Takayama, an American stage magician of French and Japanese descent best known for performing in Japan.\n\nJulian[]\n\nCreated and owned by Gabutyrafan2022\n\nAlias: KiramaiBlack, Wild Warrior\n\nGemstone Basis: Onyx\n\nOnyx is a variety of the mineral chalcedony which possesses parallel bands. While it can come in almost any color, it is most famously known as black. The name means \"fingernail\" in Greek, which this gemstone can resemble when colored correctly.\n\nProfession: Zookeeper\n\nJulian reasons become Zookeeper to care Animals at the Zoo\n\nRoll Call: Shinka Power\n\nShinka is the be translated as meaning \"evolution\". Julian roll call can therefore be translated as \"The Evolution Power\"\n\nUmbra[]\n\nCreated and owned by R4veg0yl3\n\nAlias: KiramaiUmbra, Savage Warrior\n\nGemstone Basis: Obsidian\n\nObsidian is a naturally occurring volcanic glass classified as an igneous rock formed from cooled lava extruded from a volcano. It is primarily used to manufacture cutting and piercing tools due to its sharp edges. It is also used as a gemstone colored jet black or gray. Obsidian is named after Obsidius, the Roman believed to have first discovered the stone in Aethiopia.\n\nProfession: Bounty Hunter\n\nUmbra's Kiramental increases his fighting and tracking capabilities, making him the ultimate hunter and the best at hand to hand combat.\n\nRoll Call: Dokidoki Terror\n\nDokidoki is the Japanese onomatopoeia for a beating heart. Umbra's roll call can therefore be translated as \"The Heart-Pounding Terror\".\n\nEtymology\n\nUmbra is defined as 'the darkest part of a shadow, especially the cone-shaped region of full shadow cast by Earth, the Moon, or another body during an eclipse'. It is the Latin word for 'shadow'.\n\nMizuki Kakihara\n\nAlias: Kiramai Scarlet, Love Warrior\n\nGemstone Basis: Carnelian\n\nTo be Added\n\nProfession: Student\n\nTo be added\n\nEquipment[]\n\nKiramai Changer[]\n\nThe Kirameki Henshin Brace Kiramai Changer (Sparkling Transformation Brace Kiramai Changer) is the primary transformation device of the Kiramagers, a wristwatch device modeled after a rubber tire.

Hairi Masu!\" with the same standby loop as Blast Mode) to perform a special attack.\n\nThe Kiramai Stones[]\n\nThe Kiramai Stones are the main partners of the Kiramagers and are the source of their powers, thus sharing the same gemstone basis as their Kiramager. Juru used his Kiramental to grant the Kiramai Stones the ability to turn into Mashin, vehicles that can be used to fight against the giant Jamen Beasts and combine into Kiramai Giants.\n\nThe following six Mashin are the personal partners of the Kiramagers.\n\nMashin Fire[]\n\nAlias: Red Kiramai Stone\n\nGemstone Basis: Ruby\n\nVehicle Basis: Fire Truck\n\nA fire truck, also known as a fire engine, is a specially modified vehicle used by firefighters for transportation and storing water to put out fires.\n\nPartner: KiramaiRed\n\nPrior to becoming Mashin Fire, the Red Kiramai Stone imagined itself as a sports car-like Mashin called Mashin Makka. This name is likely based on Mach, makka (a Japanese word meaning bright red), and ka (a reading of the kanji for fire or the Japanese pronunciation of car).\n\nJuru's main Mashin being a fire truck may reference his own hotblooded personality. It also may be his interpretation of Kiramagers as rescue forces.\n\nMashin Shovellow[]\n\nAlias: Yellow Kiramai Stone\n\nGemstone Basis: Topaz\n\nVehicle Basis: Excavator\n\nAn excavator is a piece of heavy construction equipment. They are mainly used for digging trenches, holes, and foundations.\n\nPartner: KiramaiYellow\n\nEtymology: This Mashin's name is a combination of shovel (the Japanese word for the excavator) and yellow (his color).\n\nJuru himself acknowledges that the basis behind Tametomo's vehicle is that his color is yellow, which is commonly associated in popular culture with construction equipment like excavators.\n\nMashin Mach[]\n\nAlias: Green Kiramai Stone\n\nGemstone Basis: Emerald\n\nVehicle Basis: Sports Car\n\nSports cars are cars that are built for thrills through reaching high speeds quickly and possess great handling.\n\nPartner: KiramaiGreen\n\nEtymology: Mach is a unit of measurement that compares the speed of a vehicle to the speed of sound. For example, a Mach 2 can go twice the speed of sound.\n\nJuru's inspiration for Sena's vehicle is her own emphasis on speed, similar to sports cars being designed to move quickly.\n\nMashin Jetter[]\n\nAlias: Blue Kiramai Stone\n\nGemstone Basis: Sapphire\n\nVehicle Basis: Fighter Jet\n\nA fighter jet is a fixed-wing military aircraft designed for air-to-air combat. The term used here is very broad, as military aircraft are often classified under their specific combat abilities and by a number of codenames. If anyone can label the specific jet this character is based on, please provide your knowledge.\n\nPartner: KiramaiBlue\n\nEtymology: This Mashin's name is most likely a simple corruption of the word jet. However, its name in Japanese romaji (Jetta) also resembles the German word for a jet stream.\n\nJuru gave Shiguru a fighter jet due to its general shape (a wide base that slims down the body into a sharp pointed end) resembling a sword.\n\nMashin Helico[]\n\nAlias: Pink Kiramai Stone\n\nGemstone Basis: Rhodolite\n\nVehicle Basis: Helicopter\n\nThe helicopter is a type of rotorcraft that can generate lift and thrust through the use of horizontally spinning rotors. They are unique among aircraft due to taking off and landing vertically. Most modern designs also possess a smaller vertical propeller attached to the back for more stability.\n\nPartner: KiramaiPink\n\nEtymology: This Mashin's name is based on the Greek word \"helico\" (one of the root words of helicopter) which translates to \"spiral\", a line that curves in a continuous or gradually winding pattern.\n\nJuru gave Sayo this vehicle basis because helicopters are used by emergency medical services to quickly transport the injured and sick to facilities like a hospital before their condition worsens.\n\nMashin Drijan[]\n\nMashin Drijan is a modified version of Takamichi's original vehicle, Super Heavy Machine Drijan. Unlike all of the other Mashin, Takamichi himself turns into the Shining Kiramai Stone and fuses with Drijan instead of Drijan transforming from a Mashin Stone form.\n\nGemstone Basis: Diamond\n\nVehicle Basis: Drill Tank\n\nThe drill tank is a fictional vehicle seen in common fiction which moves using treads and uses a gigantic drill to dig through any surface. They are most commonly seen in works of fiction involving subterranean adventures (below the surface of the Earth).\n\nPartner: KiramaiSilver\n\nEtymology: This Mashin's name is potentially a combination of Drill and Jan (a Japanese onomatopeia meaning \"flashy display\", referencing the Kiramager's association with shininess).\n\nTakamichi is a treasure hunter, meaning that he likely has to explore many different types of terrains. Real life treasure hunters often explore cave systems and underground surfaces, so possessing a drill tank to reach these areas would be beneficial to Takamichi. This Mashin is unique in being the only one not based on a real-life vehicle, which keeps the Sentai tradition of the Sixth Ranger being unique among the team.\n\nMashin Metron[]\n\nCreated and owned by GamepadtheDreamer\n\nAlias: Chartreuse Kiramai Stone\n\nGemstone Basis: Jade\n\nVehicle Basis: F1 Race Car (Short for Formula One)\n\nA Formula One car is a single-seat, open-cockpit, open-wheel car used primarily for Formula One racing. The name derives from the specific rules and regulations of the races, thus possessing a \"formula\" for how to they are done. They are unique compared to other cars because their main engine is located behind the driver's seat.\n\nPartner: KiramaiJade\n\nEtymology: This Mashin's name is a combination of metric and tron.\n\nThe metric system is a measuring system based around the meter, which itself is a unit of length.\n\nTron is a suffix used in reference to electronic devices and machines. The word is also informally used as a verb for rushing past someone to get ahead of them, as a reference to the classic movie TRON and its legendary Light Cycle sequence.\n\nIt could also be viewed as a reference to Megatron, the main antagonist of the Transformers franchise which also is about transforming vehicles.\n\nJuru gave Hanaya a Formula One car because her occupation as a chef involves following a specific set of instructions (recipes) similar to the strict nature of Formula One.\n\nMashin Illusand[]\n\nCreated and owned by GamepadtheDreamer\n\nAlias: Crimson Kiramai Stone\n\nGemstone Basis: Garnet\n\nVehicle Basis: Dune Buggy\n\nA dune buggy, also known as a beach buggy, is a recreational motor vehicle with large wheels and wide tires designed for usage in sand-covered environments like beaches and deserts. They are typically created through the modification of an existing road vehicle.\n\nPartner: KiramaiGarnet\n\nEtymology: This Mashin's name is a combination of illusion and sand.\n\nMashin Dumprime[]\n\nCreated and owned by Gabutyrafan2022\n\nAlias: Taupe Kiramai Stone\n\nGemstone Basis: Onyx\n\nVehicle Basis: Dump Truck\n\nPartner: KiramaiBlack\n\nEtymology: This Mashin's name is a Combination of Dump Truck and Prime\n\nIt could also be viewed as a reference to Optimus Prime\n\nMashin Shredavator[]\n\nCreated and owned by R4veg0yle\n\nAlias: Dark Kiramai Stone\n\nGemstone Basis: Obsidian\n\nVehicle Basis: Bucket Wheel Excavator\n\nA bucket-wheel excavator (BWE) is a large heavy equipment machine used in surface mining since the 1920s. They rank among the largest vehicles ever produced and the largest (Bagger 293) currently holds the Guinness World Record for the heaviest land-based vehicle ever constructed.\n\nPartner: KiramaiUmbra\n\nEtymology: This Mashin's name is a combination of Shred and excavator.\n\nJuru gave Umbra a bucket wheel excavator because he generally is quite intimidating, even out of battle, same with bucket wheel excavators because of they're large size and appearance.\n\nMashin Rockegleam[]\n\nCreated and owned by R4veg0yle\n\nAlias: Metal Kiramai Stone\n\nGemstone Basis: Hematite\n\nHematite is a common iron oxide compound mineral widely found in rocks and coils. It commonly is found naturally in black or silver-gray, but also can be brown or red. It is often mined as a source of iron ore. The name is derived from the Greek word for blood (\"haima\") due to the red coloration of some varieties.\n\nVehicle Basis: Rocket\n\nA rocket is a vehicle that uses jet propulsion to generate thrust. Their usage for military and recreational purposes dates back to at least 13th-century China, but they also are the enabling technology of the Space Age in the 20th century. The word comes from the Italian word \"rocchetto\", meaning 'spool'.\n\nPartner: KiramaiUmbra\n\nEtymology: This Mashin's name is a combination of rocket and gleam.\n\nJuru gave Umbra a space rocket because he generally possesses a calm demeanour, which Astronauts would require when a rocket takes off.\n\nMashin Militank[]\n\nCreated and owned by R4veg0yle\n\nAlias: Indigo Kiramai Stone\n\nGemstone Basis: Sugilite\n\nSugilite, also referred to as lavulite and luvulite by gem collectors, is a rare pink to purple cyclosilicate mineral.

Its most common uses are for the production of pencils, lubricants, and electrodes. Under high pressures and tempatures, graphite can be converted into diamond. The name comes from the Greek word \"graphein\" which means 'write'.\n\nVehicle Basis: Biplane\n\nA biplane is a fixed-wing aircraft with two main wings stacked one above the other. The first powered, controlled aeroplane to fly, the Wright Flyer, used a biplane wing arrangement, as did many aircraft in the early years of aviation. While a biplane wing structure has a structural advantage over a monoplane, it produces more drag than a monoplane wing.\n\nWeapon Form: Scissors\n\nEtymology: This Mashin's name is a combination of snip and plane.\n\nThe following five Mashin are special Mashin that the Kiramagers obtain over the course of the series. While Mashin Jouki is particularly affiliated with Galza, the other four have no particular Kiramager partner.\n\nMashin Jouki[]\n\nAlias: Black Kiramai Stone\n\nGemstone Basis: Onyx\n\nOnyx is a variety of the mineral chalcedony which possesses parallel bands.

The name is intended to be a pun on \"houseki\" (the Japanese word for a gemstone).\n\nOmegajin[]\n\nCreated and owned by Gabutyrafan2022\n\nComponents: Mashin Dumprime, Mashin Subclawer, Mashi Jeebazooka\n\nSignature Weapon: PrimeClaw\n\nMain Finisher: Kiramai Omega Crush\n\nForeverful Tiger[]\n\ncreated and owned by Gabutyrafan2022\n\nComponent: Mashin Torakku, Mashin Byakko\n\nSignature Weapon: Snow Claws\n\nSpecial Attack: Savage Attack\n\nMain Finisher: Foreverful Blizzard\n\nHakkojin[]\n\nCreated and owned by R4veg0yl3\n\nComponents: Mashin Shredavator, Mashin Rockegleam, Mashin Militank\n\nSignature Weapon: Shredavator Buzzsaw\n\nMain Finisher: Kiramai Saw Punch\n\nEtymology: Hakkojin's name can be literally translated as 'Luminescent God'.\n\nVengeful Hydra[]\n\ncreated and owned by R4veg0yl3\n\nComponents: Mashin Kuruzu, Mashin Hyieldall\n\nSigniture Weapon: Bronze Scimitars/Bronze Glaive\n\nSpecial Attack: Mighty Speardush\n\nMain Finisher: Vengeful Consequence\n\nThe word consequence is a result or effect, typically one that is unwelcome or unpleasant.\n\nYodonheim[]\n\nThe Dark Empire Yodonheim (Yami no Teikoku Yodonheimu) are the main antagonists of the Kiramagers. They are generally themed around the concept of masks. The name is a combination of \"yo\" (demon in Japanese) and Jotunheimr, the realm of the giants in Norse mythology.\n\nEach of the main Yodonheim generals appears to have an animal motif, specifically an animal associated in culture as evil or dangerous. Their names also allude to the concept of corruption or dirtiness to oppose the bright and colorful Kiramagers.\n\nEmperor Yodon[]\n\nRank: Emperor\n\nMotif: Snake\n\nCombining this motif with Yodonheim's connections to Norse mythology, Emperor Yodon may allude to Jormungandr. Due to him having two extra faces, he is based on Ravana.\n\nEtymology: Yodon's name comes from yodomu, which can mean \"to be sedimented\" in Japanese. Sediment is dirt that gets mixed into rock, which would obviously make gemstones less shiny.\n\nGalza[]\n\nFull Title: Treacherous Demon General Galza (Uragiri no Oni-Shogun Garuza)\n\nMotif: Crescent Moon, Wolf\n\nCombining this motif with the series's connections to Middle Eastern mythology and Norse mythology, Galza may allude Asena and Fenrir. His crescent armor may allude Máni. The crescent style can be found in Muslim motifs.\n\nEtymology: Galza's name has many possible origins. The first two allude to Galza being a good person in the past, and the last continues Yodonheim's theme of Norse mythology.\n\nGulzar (an Arabic word meaning \"garden\")\n\nGolzar (a Persian word meaning \"beautiful\")\n\nUtgaroa-Loki (Utogaruza-roki, the lord of the castle Utgaro in the realm of Jotunheimr from Norse mythology)\n\nCarantula[]\n\nFull Title: Dark Masked Magician Carantula (Yami no Kamen Tsukai Kuranchura)\n\nMotif: Spider, Poison Dart Frog\n\nEtymology: His name appears to be based on mascara (the Spanish word for \"mask\") and tarantula (a specific type of arachnid).\n\nNumajo[]\n\nFull Title: Witch of the Stagnant Sea Numajo (Teitai Umi no Majo Numajo)\n\nMotif: Ocean Wave\n\nEtymology: Her name is a combination of numa (Japanese for \"swamp\") and \"majo\" (one possible Japanese word for \"witch\").\n\nMinjo[]\n\nFull Title: Nightmare Maestro Minjo (Akumu no Maesutoro Minjo)\n\nMotif: Dreamcatcher, Venetian Mask\n\nEtymology: Unknown\n\nYodonna[]\n\nAlias: Shuka (human disguise)\n\nMotif: Crow\n\nYodonna ties into Norse mythology by referencing Huginn and Muninn, a pair of ravens that observe the world of Midgard and reports back to Odin.\n\nEtymology: Her name seems to be a combination of Yodon (a hint towards her true identity), donna (Italian for \"woman\") and onna (a Japanese word meaning \"woman\").\n\nShadon[]\n\nRank: General\n\nMotif: Crocodile, Avocado, Military Sniper\n\nEtymology: Shadon's name may be based on the word shadow and \"Yodon\" (the overall entity he is a part of).\n\nGarvourer[]\n\nCreated and owned by R4veg0yle\n\nFull Title: Tenacious Carnage General Garvourer\n\nMotif: Gargoyle, Golden Eagle\n\nGarvourer’s eagle like motif with the series's connections to Norse mythology, Garvourer may allude to Hræsvelgr.\n\nGarvourer's form also contains elements of an arctic wolf, a golden eagle, bones and smoke.\n\nEtymology: Garvourer's name is based on the words \"Gargoyle\" and \"devourer\".\n\nBechats[]\n\nRank: Foot Soldiers\n\nMotif: Mud, Mudraker\n\nThe Mudracker, is a journalist from the Progressive Era of the United States dedicated to exposing corruption in established institutions.\n\nEtymology: The name seems to be based on the Japanese phrase bechabecha, meaning \"gooey\" or \"messy\".\n\nJamen[]\n\nThe Jamen are the main Monsters of the Week that serve as commanders in Yodonheim. Each one is a regular Bechat that is granted a special mask by Carantula that enhances their strength and grants them special powers. They each share the same goal: gather negative energy to fill a gauge on Carantula's staff to summon an Invasion Gate portal to summon a Jamen Beast. They can be categorized by the color of their main suits: Black-Body, Red-Body, Gold-Body, and Silver-Body.\n\nThe name Jamen has several different etymologies. It appears to overall be a pun on \"kamen\", the Japanese word for a mask. The \"ka\" sound is replaced with \"ja\", a Japanese sound refering to evil. In the original word, \"men\" is spelled with a kanji meaning face. Hence, Jamen likely means \"Evil Face\" or \"Evil Mask\".\n\nBlack Body Jamen[]\n\nRugby Jamen\n\nMotif: Rugby\n\nRugby is a sport originating from England in the early 19th century.\n\nRugby Jamen's mask is modelled after a Rugby ball specifically, with the grass underneath meaning its upward position is based on someone holding it in place on the ground so another player on their team may kick it.\n\nFreezer Jamen\n\nMotif: Freezer\n\nFreezers are a specific type of refrigerator, used in households to keep them cold during the summertime.\n\nFreezer Jamen's design appears to resemble a freezer whose door has opened, resulting in the cold air spilling out of it.\n\nFreezer Jamen's design is theorized to be based on Snow Miser from the Christmas movie The Year Without A Santa Claus. The head bears an odd resemblance to the character, especially the icicle-like goatee and angular facial shape. Further evidence to this theory comes from Freezer Jamen's rivalry with his partner Oven Jamen, mirroring Snow Miser's rivalry with his brother Heat Miser from the film.\n\nReset Button Jamen\n\nMotif: Time Loop\n\nReset Button Jamen appears to be based on the storytelling trope of the time loop, where a character in the story becomes trapped in a situation where they keep experiencing the same period of time (usually a day) happening repeatedly. Some versions of this trope have the loop reset naturally, while in other cases the loop is triggered by something. This trope was most likely popularized by the 1993 movie Groundhog Day, staring popular actor Bill Murray experiencing this phenomenon on the titular holiday.\n\nReset Button Jamen's mask also possesses the mathematical symbol for infinity, which is the concept of something that is endless. The design also vaguely resembles a globe, a spherical model of the planet Earth.\n\nReset Button's infinity symbol likely represents how his existence will trap Tametomo inside the time loop forever. The globe design may reference how only Tametomo is aware of the time loop, with the rest of the world living in blissful ignorance.\n\nSumikae Jamen\n\nMotif: House\n\nSumikae (or Sumika) is a Japanese word for \"living\" or \"residence\" which indicates this monster's resemblance to a modern home. His special ability is the Moving-Out Beam, which allows him to force two people to swap bodies.\n\nMoving out is an informal phrase meaning \"to leave one's house, apartment, etc., and go to live somewhere else.\" (Definition from Merrian-Webster)\n\nThe Moving Out Beam is likely a visual analogy on how body swaps involve leaving your old body behind (similar to leaving your current residence) and being in someelse's body (aka living in a new residence).\n\nSafe Jamen\n\nMotif: Safe\n\nA safe is a secure lockable box that is used to protect valuables from being stolen or damaged. It is most commonly used by banks for smaller amounts of money and temporary storage, with the larger amounts being stored in a vault for higher security and wider space. Safe Jamen specifically seems to be modeled after a safe with a number keypad on it, which in real life requires a password (a specific combination of numbers pressed in a certain order) to open it and retrieve the objects inside.\n\nSafe Jamen's extreme durability is likely a reference to a safe's job, which is to protect the contents inside.\n\nSuper Glue Jamen\n\nMotif: Super Glue\n\nSuper Glue is a type of adhesive made of a chemical mixture called cyanoacrylates. Most commonly stored inside a bottle, super glue is so named due to its especially good ability to keep items stuck together compared to other types of adhesives.\n\nGolf Jamen\n\nMotif: Golf Course\n\nGolf is a sport that was invented by Scotland in the 15th century, involving using a club to hit specially designed balls into a series of holes across a predesigned course. Golf courses tend to be designed with similar elements such as using sand and water as \"hazards\" to challenge the player. Tall flagpoles are usually placed inside of the holes to help players spot where the hole is from a distance.\n\nGolf Jamen himself appears to be a depiction of a simple golf course, with a sand hazard and water hazard being stylized into the image of a face (the sand forms a left eye and the water forms the mouth). It also has a flag sticking out of the top of his head.\n\nGolf Jamen may be based on a common joke in the Super Sentai that golf is the \"enemy\" of all tokusatsu due to Toei often postponing airings of new episodes in favor of golf tournaments.\n\nWire Jamen\n\nMotif: Wires\n\nA wire is a strand or rod of cylindrical, flexible metal that can be used to transmit electrical and telecommunication signals across large distances.\n\nThe Wire Jamen's shapeshifting ability could be a reference to wires being capable of carrying the same signal as other wires or electrical devices, hence Wire Jamen is mimicking other people. His mind control could refer to the belief that real-life mind control is transmitted in the form of waves, similar to telecommunication signals.\n\nThe following three Jamen exclusively appeared in the Kiramager stage shows. The first two were in Kiramager G-Rosso, and Football Helmet Jamen appeared in Ressha Sentai ToQger ToQ 1gou Appears.\n\n3D Printer Jamen\n\nMotif: 3D Printer\n\n3D Printing, also known as additive manufacturing, is the process of constructing a three-dimensional object from a digital 3D model.\n\n3D Printer Jamen is based on the design of a type of printer used for this process, which is currently producing a red skull. He wields an axe that resembles a jigsaw puzzle piece.\n\nThis Jamen's axe being a puzzle piece may be a clever reference to one of the most common uses of 3D printing today: the production of specific pieces to be used in the construction of much larger machines.\n\nRadio Jamen\n\nMotif: Radio\n\nA radio reciever, commonly shortened to simply radio, is an electronic device used to receive transmitted radio waves and convert them into a recognizable form (commonly audio). The most common usage of the radio is the spreading of information across great distances.\n\nAir Conditioner Jamen\n\nMotif: Air Conditioner\n\nAir conditioning, often abbreviated as A/C (US) or air con (UK), is the process of removing heat from an enclosed space to achieve a more comfortable interior environment (sometimes referred to as 'comfort cooling') and in some cases also strictly controlling the humidity of internal air. Air conditioning can be achieved using a mechanical 'air conditioner' or by other methods, including passive cooling and ventilative cooling. Air conditioning is a member of a family of systems and techniques that provide heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC).\n\nFootball Helmet Jamen\n\nMotif: American Football\n\nAmerican Football, referred to simply as football in the United States and Canada, is a sport played by two teams on a rectangular field. While the rules are complex, the simplest description of the game involves players attempting to carry a specially designed ball down the field to the opposing teams \"end zone\" to score points. Players on the opposing team try to physically tackle the player holding the ball and push them down so they touch the ground. It should not be confused with the similar sport of soccer, which is also called football in many countries outside of the United States.\n\nThis Jamen is specifically modeled after an American Football helmet, a piece of headwear worn by players to protect against serious injury.\n\nMakeup Jamen\n\nCreated and owned by GamepadtheDreamer\n\nMotif: Makeup Kit\n\nWeightlifting Jamen\n\nCreated and owned by Mariooto\n\nMotif: Weightlifting\n\nPuppetry Jamen\n\nCreated and owned by Mariooto\n\nMotif: Puppetry\n\nFossil Jamen\n\nCreated and owned by R4veg0yl3\n\nMotif: Fossil\n\nA fossil is any preserved remains, impression, or trace of any once-living thing from a past geological age.

This is achieved by using a flash of light to replicate the specific light frequencies of an area onto a piece of photographic film.\n\nThis Jamen seems to be specifically based on a single-lens reflex camera, which has the ability to let the user view through the lens what the camera will capture in order to perfect the image they which to capture.\n\nThe Digital Camera Jamen's power appears to be a play on words, as he literally \"captures\" the person being photographed rather than replicating their image.\n\nHyakunin Isshu Jamen\n\nMotif: Hyakunin Isshu\n\nThis Jamen is based on the traditional Japanese card game of uta-garuta played using Japanese karuta playing cards. The name Hyakunin Isshu is based on the poetry anthology book that inspired the game. The name itself generally means \"One hundred people, one poem each\".\n\nPlaying the game requires two different decks, the yomifuda (reading cards) and torifuda (grabbing cards), each containing one hundred cards each based on one of the Hyakunin Isshu poems. The torifuda cards are neatly arranged on the play area face up. In each round, one player draws from their yomifuda deck and reads the poem written on it. During the reading, both the reader and their opposing player search the laid out torifuda cards for the finishing phrase of the poem being read printing on one of them and attempts to be the first to spot and grab the correct card.

When the fish eats the bait or inspects the lure, the fish's mouth gets caught in the hook.

Joysticks are most commonly seen on video game controllers and airplane flight controls.\n\nJoystick Jamen appears to be specifically modelled after a video game controller. His ability to control a person's motor functions after scanning them is similar to joysticks on video game controllers being used to control the movement of a virtual avatar in the game being played.\n\nMusic Jamen\n\nMotif: Musical Note, Microphone\n\nMusic is, in simple terms, a series of vocal and/or instrumental sounds combined in a specific way to produce a harmonious rhythm that produces various emotions on the listeners.\n\nMusic Jamen seems to be specifically modelled after a G-clef, a symbol used in the written form of music, and a microphone.\n\nMusic Jamen's ability to control people through his concert tickets or direct possession may be based on the ability of music to manipulate one's emotional state.\n\nMarshmallow Jamen\n\nMotif: Marshmallow\n\nThe marshmallow is a type of confectionary consisting of sugar, water, and gelatin whipped together into an edible material that is solid and soft simultaneously.

Though proper shinobi are recorded as being established during the Sengoku period (15th century Japan), their precursors could have existed as early as the 12th century. The Japanese Meiji Restoration of 1868 led to ninjas becoming a topic of mystery and intrigue, which has since spread into popular culture worldwide. The modern perception is based more on the legends and folklore surrounding them rather than actual history. The words ninja and shinobi actually are based on different readings of the same kanji which can be roughly translated as 'sneaking person'.\n\nNinja Jamen appears to be based after a ninja.\n\nInk Jamen\n\nCreated and owned by R4veg0yl3\n\nMotif: Ink\n\nInk is a gel, sol, or solution that contains at least one colorant, such as a dye or pigment, and is used to color a surface to produce an image, text, or design.

When an Invasion Gate is summoned, the Jamen Beast uses it as a portal to come to Earth. It is then equipped with a Jamen of its own which grants it special abilities. There are seven canonical Jamen Beast species revealed.\n\nThe Jamen Beasts all appear to be modelled after unpleasant looking animals and/or invasive species. Their Jamen's motif is almost always connected to the human-sized Jamen that summoned it, though there are exceptions.\n\nHildon-Type Jamen Beasts[]\n\nThe Hildon Jamen Beast is modelled after the leech. Its name is based on hiru, the Japanese name for the creature.\n\nFaucet Hildon\n\nMotif: Water Faucet\n\nA tap, also known as a faucet, is a valve used to control the release of a liquid or gas.\n\nThe Faucet Jamen appears to be modelled after a water faucet, often seen on sinks.\n\nCloud Hildon\n\nMotif: Cloud\n\nSummoned by: Digital Camera Jamen\n\nConnection: The Cloud Hildon, in additional to a traditional cloud, may also be based on cloud storage.\n\nWanage Hildon\n\nMotif: Ring Toss\n\nRing toss is a common carnival game where players toss rings at a peg.\n\nSummoned By: Carantula\n\nJukebox Hildon\n\nMotif: Jukebox\n\nA jukebox is a music-playing machine which allows a patron a selection of songs to play in exchange for a small fee.

It's name is based on zarigani, the Japanese name for the animal.\n\nRugger Ligany\n\nJapanese Name: Raga Rigani\n\nMotif: Rugby\n\nSummoned By: Rugby Jamen\n\nRugger Ligany seems to be based on a rugby player rather than the rugby ball itself. It carries around a gas tank in a similar manner to how rugby players carry the ball around the field.\n\nConnection: Both Rugby Jamen and Rugger Ligany are based on aspects of the rugby sport, with the Jamen being the rugby ball itself and the Jamen Beast being the players.\n\nCatcher Ligany\n\nJapanese Name: Kyatcha Rigani\n\nMotif: Crane Game\n\nA crane game (also known as a claw crane, claw machine, and toy crane) is a type of arcade game found in many public areas. The objective is to operate a crane using a joystick and button to grab a prize (most commonly a stuffed animal) inside the machine.\n\nSummoned By: Joystick Jamen\n\nAccording to the RangerWiki, Catcher Ligany's ability to slide along the streets may emulate the jittery and awkward movements that make crane games intentionally frustrating.\n\nConnection: Both Joystick Jamen and Catcher Ligany are based on games played in casual situations (video games are often played at home and crane games are found in arcades, supermarkets, and restaurants). Both video game controllers and the control panel of most crane games often have joysticks.\n\nHassha Button Ligany\n\nJapanese Name: Hassha Botan Rigani\n\nMotif: Launch Button, Missile Battery\n\nA launch button is a cultural concept involving a big red button that is used to activate military-grade missiles or rockets. In real life, the process the military uses to fire missiles is much more complex than a single button since pushing it by mistake would lead to catastrophic damage.\n\nHassha Button may also be based on the \"nuclear button\", a figurative term used to refer to the permission given to high-ranking federal officials to use nuclear weapons if they so desire.\n\nSummoned By: Reset Button Jamen\n\nEtymology: Hassha is a Japanese word meaning \"launch\", so this Jamen Beast's name means \"Launch Button Ligany\".\n\nConnection: Both Reset Button and Hassha Button Ligany are obviously based on buttons, specifically buttons that normally shouldn't be pushed due to the effects being undesireable (time loops are frustrating to deal with and launch buttons cause massive damage).\n\nHassha Ligany\n\nJapanese Name: Hassha Rigani\n\nMotif: Missile Battery\n\nMissile batteries are a tool used by military organizations during warefare to store and fire a large amount of missiles all at once rather than firing them one by one.\n\nSummoned By: Marshmallow Jamen\n\nEtymology: Based on the information given above, this monster's name translates to \"Launch Ligany\". The similar naming is due to Hassha Ligany being a remodeling of the Hassha Button Ligany with the button being removed in both design and name.\n\nConnection: This comparison is a bit of a stretch, but the Marshmallow Jamen was capable of \"triggering\"(figuratively) a traumatic memory from Takamichi's past similar to missile batteries being \"triggered\" (literally) to activate its missiles to cause damage.\n\nGold Bar Ligany\n\nJapanese Name: Kinkai Rigani\n\nMotif: Gold Bars\n\nGold is a chemical element that is considered a valuable resource and currency. This Jamen Beast's mask is based on the popular practice of turning gold into bars for easier storage and transport.\n\nSummoned By: Safe Jamen\n\nConnection: Both Safe Jamen and Gold Bar Ligany are associated with currency, banks, money, and the storage of valuables.\n\nTank Ligany\n\nJapanese Name: Tanku Rigani\n\nMotif: Tank\n\nA tank is an armored fighting vehicle used as an offensive weapon during front-line ground combat. They are a mainstay of modern military battles thanks to their heavy firepower, impressive durability, and good mobility. In modern language, the word refers to anything that is considered especially tough and/or powerful.\n\nSummoned By: Nazokaze Jamen\n\nConnection: Currently Unknown\n\nCat Can Ligany\n\nJapanese Name: Neko Kan Rigani\n\nMotif: Cat Food\n\nCat food is food, normally stored in cans, that has been specially created for the purpose of consumption by house cats. The Cat Can Ligany also has its tongue sticking out, which resembles a tuna fish. This hints that the Cat Can Ligany may specifically be a can of tuna, a popular choice for cat food.\n\nSummoned By: Maneki-neko Jamen\n\nConnection: Both Maneki-neko Jamen and Cat Can Ligany are connected directly to house cats (the Maneki-neko is literally modelled off of a house cat and cat food is a requirement for anyone who wishes to keep a cat as a pet).\n\nSwan Boat Ligany\n\nCreated and owned by GamepadtheDreamer\n\nMotif: Swan Boat\n\nSummoned By: Rubber Ducky Jamen\n\nConnection: TBA\n\nShellga[]\n\nThe Shellga Jamen Beast is modelled after the sea snail.\n\nVise Shellga\n\nJapanese Name: Manriki Sheruga\n\nMotif: Vise\n\nA Vise is a mechanical device used to secure an object in place so that work can be done on it.\n\nSummoned by: Vise Jamen\n\nConnection: Both Vise Jamen and Vise Shellga are based on the vise.\n\nStage Shellga\n\nJapanese Name: Suteji Sheruga\n\nMotif: Stage\n\nSummoned by: Music Jamen\n\nConnection: Music Jamen summoning a stage-themed Jamen Beast is likely a reference to public music ventures like concerts.\n\nHaejigoku Shellga\n\nMotif: Venus Flytrap\n\nSummoned by: Carantula\n\nEtymology: Haejigoku (literally meaning \"a fly's hell\") is the Japanese name for this plant.\n\nGlue Shellga\n\nMotif: Glue\n\nAdhesive, also known as glue or paste, is any non-metallic substance that is applied to one or two surfaces to bind them together.\n\nSummoned By: Glue Jamen\n\nSuper Glue Shellga\n\nMotif: Super Glue\n\nSuper Glue is a type of adhesive made of a chemical mixture called cyanoacrylates. Most commonly stored inside a bottle, super glue is so named due to its especially good ability to keep items stuck together compared to other types of adhesives.\n\nSummoned By: Super Glue Jamen\n\nShield Shellga\n\nMotif: Shield\n\nSummoned By: Nazokake Jamen\n\nJishiki Shellga\n\nMotif: Knowledge\n\nSummoned By: Wire Jamen\n\nBasra[]\n\nThe Basra Jamen Beast is modelled after the largemouth bass, a freshwater fish that is often targeted by commercial fisherman.
