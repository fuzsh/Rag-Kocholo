ROBOGEISHA (Funimation, 2009) D: Noboru Iguchi, w/ Aya Kiguchi, Hitomi Hasebe. Rating: NNNN DVD package: NNNN Rating: NNNN

From the moment the penis-nosed goblin girls erupt from the singing and dancing geisha, we know we’re in the lunatic world of Noboru Iguchi (Machine Girl), where bodies and machines merge and fly apart at will and there’s no such thing as excess.

Yoshie (Aya Kiguchi) is the abused Cinderella suffering in the shadow of her beautiful, selfish geisha sister, Kikue (Hitomi Hasebe). When the girls are kidnapped by an evil corporation and pitted against one another, Yoshie discovers a talent for violence and turns the tables and their love-hate relationship grows more complex. At the same time, a motley crew of the relatives of other girls who’ve become corporate assassins are planning an attack to rescue their loved ones.

The penis noses are, of course, weaponized. Ditto armpits, breasts and other parts. Above all, there is the ass sword, with its incredible power to embarrass.

Given the elegant set design and more than merely competent CG and miniature work, the sloppiness of Iguchi’s fight scenes seems jarring at first, but it’s a distancing device to remind us that there’s a theme running through the film about the destruction of the Japanese family and a vision of corporate drones as child soldiers.

A 15-minute spinoff in the extras: Geishacop: Fearsome Geisha Corps – Go To Hell offers more of the demented same.
