        "text": "We are grateful for your interest in Horizon Christian School and believe our school is a fantastic choice for the education of your student(s). Our school is a place where all Pre-K through 12th grade students are welcome. We are located in Tualatin, Oregon, serving nearly 700 students, on two beautiful campuses. For over 40 years we have provided excellence in academics, arts, athletics, and extracurricular activities, all built on the foundation of a Christ-centered faith and community. We believe each child is unique, and we use every opportunity to help them to discover and grow in the gifts and abilities that God has given them.\n\nWe are a college-preparatory school that takes student learning far beyond memorization. Our goal is to prepare every student in their academic and personal development for each transition that will take place over their educational journey. Over 90% of our high school graduates go on to attend college, while the remaining are headed directly to careers, trades, pursuing ministry or the mission field.\n\nWhether it is in the classroom, athletic fields, playground, or in our extracurricular activities, we are committed to creating environments of spiritual growth and academic rigor. It is our privilege to offer our community academically strong, faith-based educational programs for Pre-K through 12th-grade, and International students 7th through 12th grade."
