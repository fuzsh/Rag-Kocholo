        "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WSMV) - Every medical student has their own reason for pursuing a career in the medical field.\n\nSydelle Davis says, for her, it was completely unexpected.\n\n”When I was 14 my best friend passed away,” Davis explained. “Before then I wanted to be an actress.”\n\nThat’s what’s behind her desire to become a pediatrician.\n\n”You hear so many terrible stories about not being heard, being people of color so that’s really where my mind went to and its crazy cause it was at such a young age,” she admitted.\n\nNow in her second year at Meharry Medical College, she says she realizes there’s a much bigger need.\n\nDr. James E.K. Hildreth, the president and CEO of Meharry outlines that need: there are not enough black and brown doctors.\n\n”The data is very clear when the workforce matches the communities they care for the healthcare workforce,” Hildreth said. “I mean, the outcomes are better.”\n\nBut with money from Bloomberg Philanthropies, he says they can better address those needs.\n\n“It will be used to support our students, infrastructure, investing in programs,” Hildreth explained. “Bloomberg’s intent was to better allow students to go into medicine and other healthcare professions and accumulate wealth by having less debt to deal with when they graduate.”\n\nHildreth believes the ripple effect can be felt right here in Tennessee.\n\n“Meharry trains a lot of students from Tennessee and a lot of those students stay in Tennessee to practice medicine,” she said. “So, while we’re a private institution, we serve a very public need.”\n\nA need Sydelle Davis is willing to take on.\n\n”It gives us the ability to have that common connection where we can understand...being black, being a person of color in the healthcare field.”"
