Look no further than our guide with side-by-side comparisons of tuition, class size, acceptance rates, and other need-to-know information.\n\nA few caveats, before you dive in:\n\nData is voluntarily self-reported for the most recently completed academic year. Information is subject to change. A dash indicates data was not shared or is not applicable. Tuition ranges might not reflect pre-K, part-time attendance, sibling discounts, rates for boarding or international students, or required fees. Schools offering only preschool and/or kindergarten were excluded, as were most schools that did not complete Portland Monthly’s survey.\n\nInformation on language immersion, focus options, magnets, and other special programs at public schools can be found on the websites of Portland Public Schools and the many other metro-area school districts.\n\nRecent state report cards and standardized test results are available at oregon.gov/ode.\n\nCounty School Grade range offered School philosophy type/religious/affiliation/student body makeup Website Address City State ZIP Phone number Application deadline Acceptance rate (%) K-12 tuition range Average financial aid grant ($) Students receiving financial aid (%) Total K-12 enrollment for 2021-2022 school year Students identifying as Black or African American (%) Students identifying as Asian/Pacific Islander (%) Students identifying as Caucasian (%) Students identifying as Hispanic/Latino (%) Students identifying as Multiracial/Other (%) Average class size Number of full-time faculty Total hours in a school day Number of school days in a normal school year Are uniforms or specific clothing items required? *some grades only Do the school have an on-site library?
