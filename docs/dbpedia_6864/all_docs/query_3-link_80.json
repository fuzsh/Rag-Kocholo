        "text": "HCA wants to be clear of our goal. We want to honor Christ’s calling to make the world a better place by the way we \"love one another.” In this day and age, raising a child to do that well can be difficult. We want to be clear that HCA is not the “little Christian school you send your child to protect them from the world.” We are a school you send your children to so that they can someday change the world.\n\nAt HCA, we believe that parents are the number one spiritual influence in their child’s life. We also believe that the student’s church should be the second influence in his/her life. At HCA, we are honored that a family would choose us to be third. That being said, we also understand that there are many backgrounds and denominations that attend HCA. We describe this as a multi-denominational community, not simply non-denominational. Because of this, we have decided to “double down” on what is core to the Christian faith (Statement of Faith), and have a culture of grace around what is not core (denominational orthodoxy), as there will be differences in how Christians live out their faith.\n\nElementary Monitoring includes creating a 412 plan from existing documentation (504, IEP, Ed Psych), accommodations, and frequent check-ins.\n\nBasic Secondary 412 Monitoring includes a 412 Plan with classroom supports and /or testing accommodations created from professional evaluations*, communication with parents, monitoring student performance (grades, homework, missing assignments), consulting with students and parents, conferences as needed and Academic Planning Conference, coordination of outside therapies, and Standardized Testing Accommodations (with appropriate documentation).\n\n*Valid, recent documentation is required (IEP with Educational/Psychological testing from public school or private Ed/Psych testing) documenting an identified disability. Based upon collected data and date of testing, additional testing may be required, especially when in transition years. Ed Psych testing will need to be updated during the student’s Junior year in order to continue receiving accommodations in college.\n\nMiddle School 412 Monitoring includes the Basic Secondary Monitoring listed above, plus Study Hall class where the student is assisted by a teacher with homework, planning, study skills, projects, and student check-in several times a week to go over agenda, planning, maintaining assignments, grades, etc.\n\nAcademic Progress Monitoring will be administered in the Fall and Spring in student’s area of concern and communicated with families.\n\nAll discounts are netted against tuition only (excludes Fees).\n\nTotal combined discounts are limited to 50% of a student’s tuition.\n\nDiscounts are listed in the order they will be applied. Each discount is applied on the net tuition due after the previous discount has been applied.\n\nNote: Estimated credits from Georgia Special Needs (“GSN”) are applied PRIOR to tuition discounts. All tuition discounts are applied to the net amount paid by the family after any GSN credits.\n\nCurrent students can “lock-in” the 2023-2024 tuition rates for the 2024-2025 school year by paying your 2024-2025 Enrollment Fee in full by January 31, 2024. The Early Commitment Discount is designed to reward families who reenroll by January 31st, thereby helping the school administration plan for our next school year.\n\n1/31/24 “Lock-In” Tuition Rates for 2024-2025\n\n1 st – 5th Grade $12,350\n\n6 th – 12th Grade $13,750\n\nThis discount is not available to new applicants.\n\nThrough GaSSO and other outlets of receiving financial resources, Horizon Christian Academy is able to provide financial aid to those in need. The HCA Scholarship Committee gives preferences to families in need of financial aid and decides additional awards based on merit and other considerations. The Financial Aid season runs JanuaryMarch prior to the upcoming school year. A link to apply for financial aid will be available in reenrollment agreements. No financial assistance is awarded unless a family has first applied through the financial aid portal. Phase One of Scholarships will be awarded in February. Families will be required to have 2022 filed tax returns AND 2023 W2/1099s when applying for financial aid. Students MUST be enrolled prior to applying for financial aid."
