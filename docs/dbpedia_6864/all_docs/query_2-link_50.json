        "text": "We believe that administering our financial aid based on need alone is critical to ensuring that all students who are admitted to Yale will have the ability to enroll regardless of any financial limitations they may have at the outset. Need-based aid allows us to direct our institutional resources to the students who truly require and will benefit most from them, and it helps maintain socio-economic diversity at the Law School. By applying the same pre-set principles to all students, we are able to bring transparency and consistency to our financial aid process. These concepts of equity, fairness, and universal access – which underlie need-based aid – reflect the values of the Yale Law School community. We deliver aid through a process that meets the criteria of federal regulations and institutional policies while serving the needs of students in a fair and equitable manner. Please refer to the 2024-2025 JD Financial Aid Handbook for more details.\n\nAs stated in our 2024-2025 JD Financial Aid Handbook, we expect students to provide the Financial Aid Office with accurate information about their financial situation and notify us of any significant changes whenever they occur; meet the deadlines and submit all requirements and reporting responsibilities promptly and carefully; and, if requested submit additional documentation for the purposes of reconciling discrepancies, providing clarification of application data, or if selected for federal or institutional verification purposes. In addition, federal regulations require that the University report any information that indicates that an applicant may have engaged in fraud or other criminal misconduct in connection with his or her federal loan application. The information will be reported to the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Education or other law enforcement officials. Please note: For non-U.S. Citizens, the information on the Student visa form and the financial aid application must correspond. If the information varies, it must be corrected or it will be reported to the Office of International Students and Scholars.\n\nExample of Award Packaging Parameters\n\nYLS determines financial need and offers aid to meet that need based on the following two-part calculation:\n\nCost of Attendance1(i.e. Budget)\n\nminus contribution (student + parent+ spouse)2\n\n= student's amount of financial need\n\nNeed is then filled with a set amount of unit loan funds and then by a Yale Law School Institutional Scholarship\n\nStudent's amount of financial need\n\nminus unit loans3 (based on class year)\n\n= YLS Institutional scholarships award\n\n1 Includes tuition, fees, health insurance, and an allotment for living expenses\n\n2 Combination of student assets, income, and, if applicable, spouse and parent resources\n\n3 Unit loan amounts are established annually and vary by class year\n\nAward Packaging Parameters\n\nAcademic year financial aid consists of need-based grants and loans. The primary goal of our financial aid program is to ensure that all admitted students can afford to attend Yale Law School regardless of their financial resources. We determine the financial aid offers based on a budget of tuition and fees plus allowances for living expenses, books, and travel.\n\nThe process of applying for financial aid differs for both new admit students and continuing students, as well as for those students only seeking loan support versus those seeking a full financial aid package of both loans and scholarships.\n\nFinancial Aid Support\n\nUsing a combination of loans and grants/scholarships, we make every effort to provide students with the difference between their resources (such as family resources, summer earnings, and student savings) and the cost of attending Yale Law School.\n\nFor the 2023-2024 academic year, 71% of our J.D. student body received some form of financial aid, and 62% qualified for Law School institutional scholarships. For students on scholarship the median amount is approximately $37,964, and 80% receive approximately $20,000 or more. In total, Yale Law School disbursed $14 million in institutional support to its J.D. candidates.\n\nStudents are expected to help meet the cost of their education through savings and employment.\n\nStudent Assets\n\nStudents are expected to exhaust their savings and other financial assets (determined at the beginning of Law School) by contributing one-half in their first year and the remaining half in their second year. Students must conserve the assets anticipated for use in the second year; the Law School’s second year financial aid calculation will assume that these assets are available. This schedule of expenditure (as opposed to one requiring all assets to be consumed before any grant aid is offered) is designed to lessen the financial impact of withdrawal from the Law School after the first year. It is also designed to back-load loans and thus reduce the interest that accrues. Additional assets acquired during Law School are considered to be fully available to meet Law School expenses.\n\nSummer Employment\n\nThe determination of the expected summer contribution for continuing students is based on the following steps:\n\nThe calculation of gross earnings is based on the weekly rate of pay for students’ full-time job(s) applied to the number of weeks worked.\n\nFor students who split employment between more than one full-time employer, gross earnings will be derived by calculating a weighted average weekly income for all full-time weeks worked. This average income will be applied to the actual number of weeks worked.\n\nFor students who split employment between a full-time compensated position and a full-time unpaid internship, gross earnings will be derived by reducing gross income by the standard weekly living allowance for weeks working at the unpaid position.\n\nNext, we calculate a tax deduction for federal, state, and FICA taxes. For the state tax rate, we use either the tax rate of the state in which the student worked or Connecticut’s income tax rate, whichever is greater. This tax deduction is subtracted from gross earnings.\n\nFor students who work in multiple states, we will base the state portion of the tax calculation on the state with the higher tax rate\n\nNext, we deduct $8,000 for summer living expenses.\n\nNext, we deduct a savings component (after taking into account the deductions above), which will be retained by students and thereby decrease the student contribution:\n\nFor weeks 1-10 we will deduct 15%; and\n\nFor weeks 11 and greater we will deduct 75%.\n\nThe remaining income will be the student’s summer income contribution. In most cases, the summer income contribution is not paid to the law school, rather it is retained by the student to pay for part of the cost of living during the academic year.\n\nBecause the tax rate is normally based on an annualized projection for each pay period, some employers will withhold more in federal taxes when employed at the company for a shorter period of time (i.e. summer only). To avoid the higher tax deduction, we suggest you speak to your employer’s HR office about adjusting the federal tax withholding since you will only be employed there for a few weeks during the summer. You can find more details about this procedure in the IRS Publication 15-A, page 24 (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15a.pdf).\n\nSummer contributions of $2,500 are imputed to students in all classes who choose not to work during the summer. We expect that students entering the Law School will contribute the higher of a summer contribution calculated by the formula above or $2,500.\n\nContinuing students interested in summer public interest and government employment should consider the Law School's programs of direct support for such work through Summer Public Interest Fellowships (SPIF). Students who participate in SPIF generally do not have a summer contribution as their SPIF grant is less than or equal to the $8,000 exclusion.\n\nTerm-time Employment\n\nTerm-time income in excess of $5,000 will be considered as an asset to meet financial need. Seventy percent of gross income minus $3,500 (shelter) will be applied first to replace any unmet summer contribution expectation, parental contribution that is not in fact available, or to meet expenses in excess of the basic budget. If no such shortfall exists or if the net income exceeds the shortfall, the income (or that portion in excess of the shortfall) will be used to reduce unit loan dollar-for-dollar. If term-time income is $5,000 or less, the student does not have to report the income to the Financial Aid Office.\n\nFor current 1Ls and 2Ls-adjustments for any term time employment completed during the current 2024-2025 academic year will be factored into your next academic year (2025-2026) aid award. Students will report their term-time income on the 2025-2026 FAAST application (Note: those students who opt not to complete FAAST (i.e. loan consideration only) will be asked to supply this information separately on an addendum to their Notification and Confirmation form. Students whose income exceeds the parameters outlined in the policy above will see a calculation for term time income on their 2025-2026 aid award letter in their student contribution (along with any existing assets and summer earnings contributions). As such, students should plan accordingly knowing that any income derived in 2024-2025 may affect their 2025-2026 aid award.\n\nFor 3Ls-students will receive an e-mail at the beginning of the Spring 2025 term requesting that they report term time employment for the current academic year 2024-2025. Based on this data, students will be informed if a term time adjustment of their aid is required. If so, 3L students will have the choice of 1) having funds adjusted directly off their student account or 2) having the adjustment made in the amount of COAP eligible loans they have incurred while enrolled. By offering two options, students who cannot afford to lose direct funds in their spring term have the option of the COAP adjustment.\n\nFor more detailed information and examples, review the FAQ links below\n\nSummer Employment Policy FAQs\n\nTerm Time Employment Policy FAQs\n\nYale Law School grants:\n\nGrants provided from the Law School's institutional resources and through the generosity of our endowed scholarship funds are awarded solely on the basis of the institution need based aid calculation as outlined above.\n\nThe Law School does not give merit-based or criteria-based scholarships. The maximum possible grant is the amount of tuition (exceptions do apply). The same need based calculation applies to U.S. citizens, permanent residents and international students, who are reviewed for eligibility for institutional scholarships in the same manner.\n\nSpecial or endowed scholarships, such as those listed in the Law School Bulletin, are awarded only to students with demonstrated financial need and do not increase the recipients awards. Questions to assess a student's eligibility for specific endowed scholarship criteria are included on FAAST and, as such, no separate application is necessary. If the student is notified that their institutional need-based scholarship was supported through one of our endowed funds, they will be asked to submit a resume and may be asked to write a thank you acknowledgment to the fund donor for stewardship purposes. Students may also have opportunities to meet or otherwise thank donors directly.\n\nGrants are distributed by crediting 50% each term to the student's term bill account.\n\nThe Hurst Horizon Scholarship:\n\nThe Hurst Horizon Scholarship is a full-tuition scholarship for J.D. students with very significant financial need, specificially those from families whose income is up to 200% of the federal poverty guidelines and their family's assets are below $150K. The scholarship is awarded on an annual basis for the upcoming academic year and is disbursed in equal amounts at the beginning of each semester. Only J.D. students who are enrolled and in good standing are eligible for the Scholarship.\n\nFor students whose non-custodial parent was waived from the financial aid process due to extraordinary circumstances, the determination will be based on the custodial household only. For students whose parent(s) have both been waived from the process, we will use the student’s prior year income/household size to determine eligibility for the scholarship. For students whose parents are divorced/separated/never married, and we have both biological parents’ FAAST application, we will use a combined household income to determine eligibility. Students who are 29 or older will have to submit parental income, asset, and household information if they would like to be considered for the scholarship.\n\nThe Yellow Ribbon Program:\n\nYale Law School is a full participant in the Yellow Ribbon program, a supplemental scholarship designed to assist eligible veterans pay for college, graduate school, or professional school. Veterans who are 100% eligible for Post 9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33), 100% of tuition and fees (including mandatory health fees) will be covered by a combination of Chapter 33 benefits, the federal Yellow Ribbon contribution, and a Yellow Ribbon matching contribution from Yale Law School. Eligibility can vary so individual veterans should consult with the Veterans Affairs to determine eligibility.\n\nScholarships and grants from outside sources:\n\nScholarships or grants from outside sources will be applied to the loan portion of a Yale Law School award dollar-for-dollar. Note - regardless of the size of the outside scholarship, you must notify the Financial Aid Office of the source and amount of the award as soon as possible."
