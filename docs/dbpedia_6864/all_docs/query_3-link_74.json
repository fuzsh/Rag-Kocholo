        "text": "Are you a talented early-career scientist who has already produced excellent supervised work, is ready to work independently and shows potential to be a research leader? The ERC Starting Grant could be for you.\n\nWho can apply?\n\nResearchers of any nationality with 2-7 years of experience since completion of PhD, a scientific track record showing great promise and an excellent research proposal can apply.\n\nExtension of eligibility\n\nEligibility can be extended for reasons such as maternity, paternity, illness, national service, training, natural disasters, or asylum.\n\nCheck out the Parental leave webpage and the latest ERC Work Programme to find the specific rules regarding eligibility criteria.\n\nPhD defence date\n\nThe European Research Council (ERC) has changed the reference date for calculating the eligibility window for the Starting and Consolidator Grant calls in their Work Programme 2023.\n\nInstead of the date of the actual award, the certified date of the successful PhD defence will be used as a reference point. This change was made to ensure fair competition in terms of career stage, as the term \"award\" varies across countries and universities.\n\nFor applicants where no defence/viva was organised in the awarding institution, the applicant should provide a written confirmation from that awarding institution stating that no defence/viva was organised and indicating the date when the PhD was approved.\n\nWhat proposals are eligible?\n\nCriteria\n\nApplications can be made in any field of research\n\nThe ERC's grants operate on a 'bottom-up' basis without predetermined priorities.\n\nLocation\n\nResearch must be conducted in a public or private research organisation (known as a host institution/HI). It could be the HI where the applicant already works, or any other HI located in one of the EU Member States or associated countries.\n\nHost Institution\n\nApplications for an ERC grant require a single Principal Investigator (PI) to submit the application on behalf of their host institution.\n\nThe host institution must offer suitable conditions for the PI to independently lead the research and manage funding. The PI can be hosted by any legal entity in an EU Member State or associated country.\n\nThe PI does not need to be employed by the host institution at the time of proposal submission, but a mutual agreement and commitment are necessary if the proposal is successful.\n\nTeam\n\nERC grants support projects carried out by an individual researcher who can employ researchers of any nationality as team members. It is also possible to have one or more team members located in a non-European country.\n\nVacancies and agreements\n\nVacancies for team members interested in joining an ERC led research project, can be published on the Euraxess-Jobs portal.\n\nInitiatives, under the form of 'Implementing Arrangements', exist for ERC-funded teams in Europe to host non-European talented scientists. Find out more about the agreements.\n\nUK’s participation in Horizon Europe\n\nThe European Commission and the United Kingdom have reached a political agreement on the UK's participation in Horizon Europe, the EU's research, and innovation programme. Read more\n\nHow much?\n\nStarting Grants may be awarded up to € 1.5 million for a period of 5 years. (pro rata for projects of shorter duration). However, an additional € 1 million can be made available to cover eligible “start-up” costs for researchers moving from a third country to the EU or an associated country and/or the purchase of major equipment and/or access to large facilities and/or other major experimental and field work costs.\n\nAn ERC grant can cover up to 100% of the total eligible direct costs of the research plus a contribution of 25% of the total eligible costs towards indirect costs.\n\nHow to apply?\n\nERC grant applications can only be submitted in response to a Call for Proposals.\n\nThe ERC has yearly calls for proposals covering all scientific fields.\n\nFor an ERC grant application to be complete, it needs to include the administrative forms, the research proposal and the supplementary documents. The completed proposal should be submitted by the specified closing date.\n\nCalls are published on this page, the EU Funding & Tenders Portal and in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\nStep by step\n\nBefore the call is published:\n\nFind out which ERC grant and which call is suitable for you.\n\nIdentify the host institution and team members you would like to work with. (see also the online research partner search services)\n\nContact the National Contact Point (NCP) in your country for support.\n\nOnce the call is open:\n\nRead the call documents carefully.\n\nContact the host institution and gather all the details you need for the application.\n\nStart writing your proposal. Allow time for other people to review your draft. Your NCP, peers and other scientists can all give you helpful support and feedback.\n\nFamiliarise yourself with the EU submission service. This is the online system through which proposals must be submitted.\n\nSubmit your proposal as early as possible. Deadlines cannot be changed under any circumstances. You can update your submitted proposal any time before the deadline by simply submitting a new version, which will overwrite the old one.\n\nYou will get an ‘acknowledgement of receipt’ by e-mail for each submission.\n\nAfter the deadline:\n\nThe ERC will check whether your proposal meets the call’s eligibility criteria.\n\nExternal experts will evaluate all the eligible proposals.\n\nYou will receive further information as your proposal progresses through the evaluation. For more information we invite you to consult the timeframe for the current call.\n\nHow does the evaluation process work?\n\nProposals are evaluated by selected international peer reviewers who evaluate proposals on the basis of excellence as the sole criterion. It will be applied to the evaluation of both the research project and the Principal Investigator in conjunction.\n\nTask and composition of the evaluation panels\n\nPeer reviewers are in charge of assessing and scoring the proposals. Those who pass the quality threshold are ranked. Depending on the call budget available, a budgetary cut-off applies to the ranking list and only the highest ranked proposals are offered an ERC grant until the call's budget has been used.\n\nFor each call there are 28 panels, each covering a sub-section of one of three domains:\n\n1. Life Sciences (LS)\n\n2. Physical and Engineering Sciences (PE)\n\n3. Social Sciences and Humanities (SH)\n\nEach ERC panel consists of a chairman and 10-16 members. The panel chair and the panel members are selected by the ERC Scientific Council on the basis of their scientific reputation.\n\nIn addition to the panel members (who act as “generalists”), the ERC evaluations rely on input from remote experts external to the panel, called referees. They are scientists and scholars who bring in the necessary specialised expertise.\n\nBefore the deadline of a call, the names of the panel chairs are published on the ERC website. Similarly, the names of panel members are published, however, after the evaluation process is concluded. See all panel members\n\nSearching for data on ERC funded projects and proposals?\n\nYou can use two different platforms for views and analysis of ERC funded projects and evaluated proposals.\n\nERC dashboard\n\nThis dashboard allows you to:\n\nFilter by multiple criteria: Refine your search by funding scheme, country, year, panel, and more\n\nExport data: Export results and graphs for detailed analysis and presentation\n\nDiscover how to use the ERC dashboard with the quick start guide\n\nERC Research Information System (ERIS)\n\nERIS provides advanced features to analyze research data:\n\nRich filters: Apply filters on any available data field for more precise searches\n\nText mining: Use text mining capabilities to uncover patterns and insights\n\nDynamic visualizations: Access a variety of visual tools, including interactive word clouds and clustering tools\n\nProject outputs & bibliometrics: Search and view comprehensive data on project outputs and bibliometrics\n\nExport data: Export results and graphs data for further analysis and presentation\n\nInterested to learn more?"
