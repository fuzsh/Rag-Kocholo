        "text": "What Electricians Do About this section\n\nElectricians install, maintain, and repair electrical power, communications, lighting, and control systems in homes, businesses, and factories.\n\nDuties\n\nElectricians typically do the following:\n\nRead blueprints or technical diagrams\n\nInstall and maintain wiring, control, and lighting systems\n\nInspect electrical components, such as transformers and circuit breakers\n\nIdentify electrical problems using a variety of testing devices\n\nRepair or replace wiring, equipment, or fixtures using handtools and power tools\n\nFollow state and local building regulations based on the National Electrical Code\n\nDirect and train workers to install, maintain, or repair electrical wiring or equipment\n\nAlmost every building has an electrical power, communications, lighting, and control system that is installed during construction and maintained after that. These systems power the lights, appliances, and equipment that make people’s lives and jobs easier and more comfortable.\n\nInstalling electrical systems in newly constructed buildings is often less complicated than maintaining equipment in existing buildings because electrical wiring is more easily accessible during construction. Maintaining equipment and systems involves identifying problems and repairing broken equipment that is sometimes difficult to reach. Maintenance work may include fixing or replacing parts, light fixtures, control systems, motors, and other types of electrical equipment.\n\nElectricians read blueprints, which include technical diagrams of electrical systems that show the location of circuits, outlets, and other equipment. They use different types of handtools and power tools, such as conduit benders, to run and protect wiring. Other commonly used tools include screwdrivers, wire strippers, drills, and saws. While troubleshooting, electricians also may use ammeters, voltmeters, thermal scanners, and cable testers to find problems and ensure that components are working properly.\n\nMany electricians work alone, but sometimes they collaborate with others. For example, experienced electricians may work with building engineers and architects to help design electrical systems for new construction. Some electricians may also consult with other construction specialists, such as elevator installers and heating and air conditioning workers, to help install or maintain electrical or power systems. Electricians employed by large companies are likely to work as part of a crew; they may direct helpers and apprentices to complete jobs.\n\nLineman electricians install distribution and transmission lines to deliver electricity from its source to customers; this occupation is covered in the line installers and repairers profile.\n\nWork Environment About this section\n\nElectricians held about 779,800 jobs in 2023. The largest employers of electricians were as follows:\n\nElectrical contractors and other wiring installation contractors 67% Self-employed workers 7 Manufacturing 6 Government 3 Employment services 3\n\nElectricians work indoors and outdoors at homes, businesses, factories, and construction sites. Because electricians must travel to different worksites, local or long-distance commuting is often required.\n\nOn the jobsite, they occasionally work in cramped spaces. The long periods of standing and kneeling can be tiring. Electricians may be exposed to dirt, dust, debris, or fumes. Those working outside may be exposed to hot or cold temperatures and inclement weather. Those who work in factories are often subject to noisy machinery.\n\nElectricians may be required to work at great heights, such as when working on construction sites, inside buildings, or on renewable energy projects.\n\nMany electricians work alone, but sometimes they collaborate with others. Electricians employed by large companies are likely to work as part of a crew, directing helpers and apprentices to complete jobs.\n\nInjuries and Illnesses\n\nWorking with electricity is dangerous. Electricians must take precautions to avoid getting hurt. Although accidents are potentially fatal, common injuries include electrical shocks, falls, burns, and other minor injuries.\n\nTo reduce these risks, workers must wear protective clothing and safety glasses. Electricians who are subject to loud noises, such as those in factories, must wear hearing protection.\n\nWork Schedules\n\nAlmost all electricians work full time. Work schedules may include evenings and weekends. Overtime is common.\n\nSelf-employed electricians often work in residential construction and may be able to set their own schedule.\n\nHow to Become an Electrician About this section\n\nMost electricians learn through an apprenticeship, but some start out by attending a technical school. Most states require electricians to be licensed. For more information, contact your local or state electrical licensing board.\n\nEducation\n\nA high school diploma or equivalent is required to become an electrician.\n\nSome electricians start out by attending a technical school. Many technical schools offer programs related to circuitry, safety practices, and basic electrical information. Graduates of these programs usually receive credit toward their apprenticeship.\n\nTraining\n\nMost electricians learn their trade in a 4- or 5-year apprenticeship program. For each year of the program, apprentices typically receive 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training as well as some technical instruction.\n\nWorkers who gained electrical experience in the military or in the construction industry may qualify for a shortened apprenticeship based on their experience and testing.\n\nTechnical instruction for apprentices includes electrical theory, blueprint reading, mathematics, electrical code requirements, and safety and first-aid practices. They may also receive specialized training related to soldering, communications, fire alarm systems, and elevators.\n\nSeveral groups, including unions and contractor associations, sponsor apprenticeship programs. Apprenticeship requirements vary by state and locality.\n\nSome electrical contractors have their own training programs, which are not recognized apprenticeship programs but include both technical and on-the-job training. Although most workers enter apprenticeships directly, some electricians enter apprenticeship programs after working as a helper. The Home Builders Institute offers a preapprenticeship certificate training (PACT) program for eight construction trades, including electricians.\n\nAfter completing an apprenticeship program, electricians are considered to be journey workers and may perform duties on their own, subject to local or state licensing requirements.\n\nLicenses, Certifications, and Registrations\n\nMost states require electricians to pass a test and be licensed. Requirements vary by state. For more information, contact your local or state electrical licensing board. Many of the requirements can be found on the National Electrical Contractors Association’s website.\n\nThe tests have questions related to the National Electrical Code and state and local electrical codes, all of which set standards for the safe installation of electrical wiring and equipment.\n\nElectricians may be required to take continuing education courses in order to maintain their licenses. These courses are usually related to safety practices, changes to the electrical code, and training from manufacturers in specific products.\n\nElectricians may obtain additional certifications, which demonstrate competency in areas such as solar photovoltaic, electrical generating, or lighting systems.\n\nElectricians may be required to have a driver’s license.\n\nAdvancement\n\nAfter meeting additional requirements and working as a qualified electrician, journey workers may advance to become master electricians. Electricians may also find opportunities to advance to supervisor or to other roles in project management.\n\nImportant Qualities\n\nColor vision. Electricians must identify electrical wires by color.\n\nCritical-thinking skills. Electricians perform tests and use the results to diagnose problems. For example, when an outlet is not working, they may use a multimeter to check the voltage, amperage, or resistance in order to determine the best course of action.\n\nCustomer-service skills. Electricians work with people on a regular basis. They should be friendly and be able to address customers’ questions.\n\nPhysical stamina. Electricians often need to move around all day while running wire and connecting fixtures to the wire.\n\nPhysical strength. Electricians need to be strong enough to move heavy components, which may weigh up to 50 pounds.\n\nTroubleshooting skills. Electricians find, diagnose, and repair problems. For example, if a motor stops working, they perform tests to determine the cause of its failure and then, depending on the results, fix or replace the motor."
