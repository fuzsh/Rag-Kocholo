        "text": "With all the businesses closing in Amarillo, we were scared that we would be losing another store.\n\nFortunately, Amarillo was spared from the cuts and this store will remain open.\n\nBig Lots!\n\nA few weeks ago the company announced that they would be closing stores across the country. They are looking to close 315 stores out of their 1390 stores, with 35 - 40 of those stores would be closed in 2024. The company is still cautious about its ability to survive.\n\nIf you visit the store location site of the Big Lots website, you can see the stores that are marked for closure and I have some good news.\n\nAmarillo Isn't Listed As Closing\n\nFor now, both our stores are safe. Big Lots has been a staple in Amarillo discount shopping for decades. The store at 34th and Bell was so popular, that they eventually opened up a store at I-40 and Grand to make shopping available on each side of Amarillo.\n\nAs of right now, all stores in Texas have been spared in this round of cuts.\n\nThis is great news, but if the company cannot pull itself out of the red, then it is more than likely more stores will close or the company will shutdown all altogether. Their sales have been declining over several quarters.\n\nBig Lots is a great store to shop for all sorts of home items including furniture, home decor, grocery items, pet items, health and beauty items just to name a few. Plus, when Halloween and Christmas roll around they have some of the best and most affordable decorations.\n\nIf you hope to keep Big Lots alive, then the only solution is to keep shopping with them regularly."
