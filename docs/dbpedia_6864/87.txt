At Horizon Christian Schools we are committed to developing each student’s unique, God-given talents and gift, from football to math; music to language—are seen as a way to address, Jesus Christ, the ever-present, unchanging “audience of one.” Our curriculum is rigorous and balanced, and core subjects satisfy credits mandated by the State of Oregon for graduation and all courses are presented from a Biblical, Christ centered perspective. Over 70% of the students participate in one or more sports. Our Drama, choir and art programs open doors for students of all skill levels to be involved. Student activities take center stage with the Harvest Party, 12 Days of Christmas, Color Wars, and Spring Formal. Clubs are another venue for students to be involved, develop leadership skills and serve God and the community. By teaching students to love God and to love each other, Horizon Christian High School builds scholars and champions ready to both engage in intellectual and athletic pursuits and serve the community. Horizon Christian Schools is a school of opportunities. What have you always wanted to try? What do you dream of doing? Come to Horizon and pursue your dream and discover God’s plan for you.
