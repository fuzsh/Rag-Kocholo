        "text": "I have a few questions for Cardinals fans: Did Kevin Kolb rack up 14 yards of offense and no first downs in the third quarter of Sunday’s win over Seattle? Was Kevin Kolb the one who threw a bad interception while trying to throw a ball away? Did Kevin Kolb roll over on John Skelton’s ankle and force him out of the game? I didn’t think so.\n\nAnswer me this: When your team is trailing in the fourth quarter and hasn’t been able to move the ball at all in the second half, why in the name of common sense would you boo the one player capable of getting your team back in the game?\n\nThere are two possible answers: A) You know nothing about the game of football. Or B) you do know something, but are so hell-bent on hating a guy because he got a big contract a year ago and hasn’t lived up to expectations, that you can’t bear the thought of pulling for him.\n\nEither way, for those who booed Kolb, it was a low-class move. It’s not like he’s been Derek Anderson bad.\n\nFortunately, Kolb tuned out the white noise and mostly led the game-winning 80-yard drive, including the go-ahead touchdown pass to Andre Roberts.\n\nAfter the 20-16 win, Kolb said he wasn’t aware of the jeers at the time, but even after he was told about them, he shrugged it off.\n\n“It’s a ‘what can you do for me now league’. I understand that. Hopefully people learned a little bit about my personality today,” Kolb said.\n\nKolb’s teammates were just as excited for him. The first thing veteran safety Adrian Wilson addressed when he walked up to the post-game podium: “I want to talk about Kevin Kolb. Let’s talk about how poetic he was.”\n\nLarry Fitzgerald seemed to take it a step further. “Kevin’s our guy now. We’re gonna ride with him.”\n\nSeeing as how Kolb’s teammates are behind him, maybe it’s time that fans are too.\n\nI’m not writing on whether or not Kolb should’ve been named the starter instead of Skelton. I’m not even saying he should be the guy once Skelton is healthy enough to play.\n\nWhat I am saying is that Kolb appears to be the starting quarterback for the immediate future. Maybe fans need to get over themselves and whatever expectations they’ve placed on him (realistic or not), and pull for him to succeed.\n\nGet over your bitterness, frustration, ignorance, stupidity or whatever it is that had you pulling against the most important player on the field at the most important part of the game, and try something original, like cheering for him.\n\nHere’s to Kevin Kolb stepping up his game in crunch time. Hopefully Cardinals fans will start doing the same."
