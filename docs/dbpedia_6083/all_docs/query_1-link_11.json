        "text": "Palo Verde Generating Station (PVGS), located about 50 miles west of Phoenix near Wintersburg, is the largest nuclear energy facility in the United States. Palo Verde generates 4,000 megawatts in service of 4 million inhabitants of Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas.\n\nNuclear power plants use the heat generated from nuclear fission (PDF) in a contained environment to convert water to steam, powering generators to produce electricity. The potential danger from an incident at a nuclear power plant is exposure to radiation. This exposure could come from the release of radioactive material from the plant into the environment, usually characterized by a plume of radioactive gases and particles.\n\nLocal and state governments, federal agencies, and the electric utilities have emergency response plans in the unlikely event of a nuclear power plant incident. The emergency response plans identify two “emergency planning zones” around the plant, the 10-Mile Emergency Planning Zone (PDF) and the 50-Mile Emergency Planning Zone (PDF). Emergency officials may ask those who live and work within the 10-mile radius to take protective actions such as sheltering, evacuation or proceed to the Reception and Care Center for the distribution of potassium iodide.\n\nRESOURCES\n\nRead More"
