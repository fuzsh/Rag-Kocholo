I pushed them outside their comfort zones, giving them plenty of speaking practice in the context of giving directions, and talking about airport layouts and runway incursions. We have 3 more immersive days to build their skills and confidence which comes from good practice and repetition. #aviationenglish #communicationskills #icaoenglish #confidenceiskey #mindsetmatters"
