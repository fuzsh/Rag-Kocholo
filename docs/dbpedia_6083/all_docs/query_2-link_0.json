This document provides an introduction and examples of verbal classification test questions. There are 5 types of relationships that can exist between items in these questions: 1) relationship based on position of letters/alphabets, 2) relationship based on small and capital letters, 3) relationship based on vowel and consonant, 4) relationship based on repetition and skipping patterns, and 5) miscellaneous relationships. Examples are given for each type of relationship using letters, words, or numbers. The goal is to identify which item is different from the others in the group based on the underlying relationship.",
