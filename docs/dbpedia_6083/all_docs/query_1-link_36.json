        "text": "Diamondbacks's Eric Chavez retires after knee injury doesn't get better\n\nCINCINNATI – His knee injury refusing to improve, veteran third baseman Eric Chavez has decided to retire.\n\nThe Diamondbacks made the announcement after Wednesday afternoon's game against the Cincinnati Reds. Chavez, who did not accompany the team on the road trip, is expected to speak to reporters at Chase Field prior to tonight's game against the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nFor years, Chavez was one of the better third basemen in baseball, hitting .273 and averaging 28 homers a year from 2000 to 2006, a stretch in which he won six Gold Glove awards.\n\nBut his career was derailed by injuries. Over a four-year span, Chavez needed two back surgeries and three shoulder surgeries. From 2007 to 2010, he played in just 154 games.\n\nHe had found new life in recent seasons in a bench role, contributing offensively while not putting too great a toll on his body. He batted .281 with nine homers in 228 at-bats for the Diamondbacks last season. He was hitting .246 with a .795 OPS in 69 at-bats this year.\n\nParra rumors\n\nRight fielder Gerardo Parra is having a disappointing season, and if recent trends hold that must mean the Diamondbacks are considering trading him.\n\nParra's name popped up in trade rumors Tuesday, with rival executives saying the Diamondbacks are shopping the veteran outfielder.\n\nIn years past, when Parra was desperate for everyday at-bats with the Diamondbacks, he might have been open to a deal. But he told reporters Wednesday he would prefer not to be traded.\n\n\"I try not to think anything about it because I'm happy being here,\" he said. \"I'm happy being with the Diamondbacks. But that's baseball.\"\n\nParra has a .256 average, a .301 on-base and a .360 slugging percentage. All are career lows. Scouts say his speed is down from previous years. A two-time Gold Glove winner, Parra's defensive numbers are down, as well.\n\nParra's down year isn't the only thing potentially driving down his trade value. He'll be arbitration-eligible next season for the third time, which could drive his salary above $6 million. Given his production is down across the board, Parra might be non-tendered.\n\nUp Next\n\nD-Backs vs. Pirates\n\nWhen: Thursday, 6:40 p.m.\n\nWhere: Chase Field (roof hotline: 602-462-6262).\n\nTV/Radio: FSAZ/KTAR-AM 620, KMVP-FM 98.7, KSUN-AM 1400.\n\nPitching matchup: Diamondbacks RHP Josh Collmenter (8-5, 4.03) vs. Pirates LHP Jeff Locke (2-2, 3.54).\n\nNotable: Collmenter is coming off a rough start on Saturday in Philadelphia, where he gave up six runs on 11 hits in 2 2/3 innings. … He had given up one run in seven innings in each of his previous two starts. … Collmenter hasn't faced the Pirates since making a relief appearance against them in August of last season. … Locke pitched well against the Diamondbacks on July 1, giving up just two runs in eight innings at PNC Park. … He was roughed up by the Rockies at Coors Field on Saturday, when he gave up six runs in 6 2/3 innings.\n\nUpcoming pitchers:\n\nFriday: At Chase Field, 6:40 p.m., Diamondbacks LHP Vidal Nuño (0-2, 3.47) vs. Pirates RHP Edinson Volquez (8-7, 3.87).\n\nSaturday: At Chase Field, 5:10 p.m., Diamondbacks RHP Chase Anderson (6-4, 3.34) vs. Pirates RHP Vance Worley (4-1, 2.54)."
