There was something worrisome about Anya, who spends her days studying at Orange Planet. Alice and Athena are seniors who haven’t seen each other for a long time because they are busy with each other. Because of that, Alice seems to be avoiding meeting Athena, who is not well for some reason. When I asked my friends Ai and Azusa to help me find a way for seniors to meet him, Anya realized that there was a “scenery” that she could see just because she was herself.\n\nSource: Aria Official Website"
