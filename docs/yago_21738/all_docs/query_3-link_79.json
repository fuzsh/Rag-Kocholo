        "text": "We're barrelling towards the end of the year which can only mean one thing: it's ARIA Awards season.\n\nThe 2023 ARIA Awards nominations were revealed on Thursday morning (21 September) via a YouTube livestream, and a heap of legends have nabbed nods for their excellent work over the last 12 months.\n\nThere are some big sweeps and hot contests among the ARIA nominations, so let's dig into who's looking to take home a big pointy award this year.\n\nWho's nabbed the most noms?\n\nThe one artist looking to truly clean up at the ARIAs this year (as he did back in 2021) is none other than the roach himself, Genesis Owusu.\n\nThe Ghanian-Australian creative visionary is up for a whopping seven nominations for his second record STRUGGLER, including Album Of The Year, Best Solo Artist, Best Independent Release and Best Hip Hop/Rap Release.\n\nHot on Genny Wu's heels are Dom Dolla, G Flip and Troye Sivan with six nods each, including competing with him for Best Solo Artist.\n\nIt's been a whopping year for Dom Dolla, who dropped an unreal collab with Nelly Furtado among everything else.\n\nHe's a four-time nominee, one-time ARIA winner (in 2020 for 'San Frandisco') so it's unsurprising he's looking at taking home the chocolates for Best Australian Live Act, and both Best Dance/Electronic and the public-voted Song Of The Year for 'Rhyme Dust' with MK.\n\n2023 has been nothing short of a rush for Troye Sivan. Perth's pop prince is capping it all off with a home run of ARIA nominations, including Best Pop Release, Best Produced Release, Best Engineered Release and also has his eye on Best Electronic/Dance Release and Song Of The Year.\n\nThis isn't Troye's first rodeo, either. He's previously been nominated for a whopping 13 awards, taking home two public-voted awards in 2016 for 'Youth' from Blue Neighbourhood.\n\nIt's undeniable that G Flip has also had a huge year with a move to Los Angeles, releasing their sophomore album DRUMMER and finding a whole new legion of fans with their appearances on Selling Sunset with partner Chrishell Stause.\n\nAfter being nominated three times before with no wins, they're doubling their P.B. with six nods, including Album Of The Year, Best Australian Live Act, Best Rock Album and Best Video.\n\nPlus, shout-out to Tkay Maidza and Flume, who are nominated for their buzzy joint 'Silent Assassin'.\n\nARIA favourites...\n\nYoung soul sensation Budjerah could continue his winning streak. After claiming the 2021 Breakthrough Artist Award and 2022 Best Soul/R&B Release for Conversations, he's scored five nominations.\n\nDitto DMA'S, who have been nominated many times in the past but walked away empty-handed. You've gotta 'Believe' the Hottest 100 of Like A Version toppers could come good this year.\n\nKing Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard are up for four trophies but are the ones to beat in the Best Hard Rock/Heavy Metal category, having won twice before (in 2016 and 2020).\n\nThe prolific rockers are in the running again with *deep breath* PetroDragonic Apocalypse; or, Dawn of Eternal Night: An Annihilation of Planet Earth.\n\nAnother ARIA favourite with four nominations is Kylie Minogue, and it could be the first time in 20 years she brings home a pointy trophy.\n\nThe Australian queen of pop has won 17 ARIAs since 1988 but the runaway viral success of 'Padam Padam' is looking down the barrel of four potential wins: Best Solo Artist, Best Pop Relesase, Best Independent Release, and the public-voted Song of the Year.\n\n...And first-timers\n\nPop darlings Cub Sport and Peach PRC could both taste ARIAs glory for the first time, with three nods each. It'd be a fitting win given both are part of only a handful of Australians to reach #1 on the ARIA Album Charts so far this year.\n\nIt's all first-timers up for the hotly contested Michael Gudinski Breakthrough Award (named after the late, great Mushroom mogul) with indie rockers Teenage Dads, Pacific Avenue and Royel Otis squaring off against pop newcomer Charley and DIY soul charmer grentperez.\n\nWe're also stoked to see nods for electronic siblings Lastlings, drill king KAHUKX, and the young Soul/R&B guns Forest Claudette, Jada Weazel, PANIA, KYE, and Chanel Loren.\n\nBut wait… there's more.\n\nFour-time ARIA winners The Teskey Brothers are looking to add to their collection with four nominations, while Dan Sultan's excellent self-titled album has him in the running for three awards.\n\nThat includes the Best Solo Artist award, which has faced criticism since the ARIAs scrapped gendered categories in 2021. While it's still majority male - with two non-binary and female artists in the mix of 2023 nominees - it does feel like some progress.\n\nThe pool includes Genesis Owusu, G Flip, Budjerah, returning favourite The Kid LAROI, Meg Mac for her comeback album Matter Of Time, and Jen Cloher's empowering I Am The River, The River Is Me.\n\nMelbourne band Jet are to be inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame, 20 years on from their world-storming debut album Get Born, which scored six ARIA wins and topped triple j's Hottest 100 with mega-hit 'Are You Gonna Be My Girl?'.\n\n\"We’re honoured and humbled by it and grateful for the recognition,\" bass player Mark Wilson told ABC's Jess Maguire, reflecting on the band's early years and how an iPod commercial skyrocketed their profile.\n\nThe winners will be unveiled on Wednesday 15 November as part of the ARIA Awards, taking place at the Hordern Pavilion on Gadigal Land.\n\nUntil then, here's the full list of 2023 nominees.\n\nAlbum of the Year\n\nDMA'S — How Many Dreams?
