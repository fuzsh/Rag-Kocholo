        "text": "A private television channel has offered a prize of 180 million lire for a film script based on a story called “The Morning Girl”, written by a famous author. Winner of the prize is a girl, Luce, a young filmmaker, popular with the critics, who comes to Rome for the occasion. While the producer is trying to get the film off the ground, Luce, nearsighted and visionary, is busy looking for the actor who can play the key role in the film. The producer, persecuted by his creditors, is unable to increase the budget. The director is unable to free herself from her visions and from her attachment to her mother. When the situation gets worse and Luce is forced to give up the film, even though she managed to find the right person, her mother’s last will remains, offering new and paradoxical hope for the producer and the recognition of her own growth that gives Luce the strength to continue."
