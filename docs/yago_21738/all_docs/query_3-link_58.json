        "text": "Muse Asia has announced through their social media that they will be hosting a fan screening of Aria the CREPUSCOLO on June 26 this year at Singapore’s Golden Village VivoCity. Aside from the film screening, the Singapore-based distributor is also hosting a giveaway on its social media in celebration of the Aria franchise’s 15th anniversary. The film first opened in Japan on March 5 this year and was previously announced to be slated for release in Malaysia and Brunei as well.\n\nJunichi Satō (A Whisker Away), who directed all previous seasons of ARIA, returned as chief director and scriptwriter, while Takahiro Notori, who was previously the episode director and storyboarder, directed the movie at J.C.Staff. Yoko Ito (Skate-Leading Stars) served as character designer and chief animation director, while Choro Club and Takeshi Senoo composed the music. Shochiku is producing the film, and Shochiku ODS Jigyou-shitsu is distributing it.\n\nThe cast includes Ryou Hirohashi (My Hero Academia series) as Alice Caroll, Rina Satou (A Certain Scientific Railgun series, A Certain Magical Index series) as Athena Glory (a role formerly played by the late Tomoko Kawakami), Ai Kayano (Sword Art Online: Alicization – War of Underworld) as Anya Dostoyevskaya, and Kiyono Yasuno (Are You Lost?) as Aletta.\n\nThe ARIA manga ran from 2002 to 2008. It received an anime adaptation titled ARIA The ANIMATION in 2005, followed by ARIA The NATURAL in 2006, ARIA the OVA: ~ARRIETTA~ in 2007, ARIA The ORIGINATION in 2008, and ARIA The AVVENIRE in 2015.\n\nMuse Asia describes the story as:\n\nThe season is fall and the city of Neo-Venezia is covered in fallen leaves. Something is bothering Anya, who works at Orange Planet.\n\nHer senior colleagues Alice and Athena haven’t seen each other due to their busy schedules, which is making Athena feel sad. But for some reason, Alice seems to be avoiding her altogether.\n\nWith her friends Ai and Azusa’s help, Anya tries to find a definitive way for Alice and Athena to get together. But during this time, Anya learns of a situation that only she can see because of where she stands."
