        "text": "This weekend the film industry lost another giant. Nicolas Roeg sadly passed away and as someone who had got to know him a little later in his life the news hit me for six. Attempting to write an appreciation of Nic Roeg, I knew that the great man, fascinated with time and non-linear storytelling, would have hated a by-the-numbers obituary. Rather I decided to give a little insight to the gracious man I met.\n\n\"You'll have to excuse my grasshopper mind,\" apologised Nicolas Roeg, the master himself, as I took my seat opposite him in his study festooned with books. Our meeting was the culmination of over a year's correspondence in my quest for him to open up to me about his film The Man Who Fell To Earth for a large-format book detailing the making of the iconic film starring David Bowie.\n\nWhen finally the fruits of my endeavours came in the form of an invite to visit Nic at his Notting Hill home, I excitedly arrived at the allotted time armed with a bountiful of questions, which I had actually handwritten – this not being my chosen formulae, preferring instead to have some pulse points scribbled down that I wish to hit, allowing conversations to evolve. However, with questions in hand and like a feverish schoolboy let loose in the tuck shop I was determined to decamp from our encounter laden down with goodies from this cinematic magician; even Nic's warning of \"how difficult it is for me to make a comment about a past that is still alive...\" could not dampen my fervour.\n\nWhat came next was a masterclass as to how he had spent his career creating cinematic jigsaw puzzles for audiences to discover, dissemble and reassemble, each resulting in a slightly different intellectual answer – not always satisfactory, but always challenging and stimulating his audience, we were left with questions and ambiguities, but importantly also a thirst for more; his films demanded repeat viewings.\n\nAnd as challenging as his films were so was trying to interview him. My first question resulted in an answer so convoluted that I abandoned my set examination and instead decided to float within the beautifully murky waters of Nic's mind. Harriet, Nic's wife, arrived armed with drinks and immediately asked me if Nic was behaving himself and giving me what I required. Harriet's appeal was received by Nic with his impish grin and I knew that I was on a ride of discovery that I was going to throughly enjoy.\n\nNic Roeg was truly the most cinematic of film-makers\n\nI had met one of my heroes and he was living up to every one of my hopes and dreams. Nic Roeg was truly the most cinematic of film-makers, preferring to converse in images, and I was seduced.\n\nMy next foray into the great provocateur's work came with a call from legendary producer Sandy Lieberson with the idea of writing another large-format book, this time a look at the iconic Performance, which Sandy had produced for co-directors Nic Roeg and Donald Cammell. With Mick Jagger and James Fox quickly acquiescing to being interrogated by me, and aligned with Sandy's treasure trove of archival material, I was once again to pay homage to my hero.\n\nThe first Nic Roeg film I saw was Track 29. Gary Oldman was one of the new turks on the block and I traipsed along to the Southbank Centre for a Q&A screening with Mr Oldman and his director. That evening I made a vow to investigate all of the work of this visionary director; I was late to the party but determined to make up for lost time, and in quick succession I had devoured Walkabout, Don't Look Now, Bad Timing, Eureka, Insignificance, Castaway and, of course, The Man Who Fell To Earth and the film he co-directed with Donald Cammell and which I have lived with for the past two years, Performance.\n\nI learnt that Nic had started out as a tea boy at Marylebone Studios, working his way up through the ranks, becoming recognised as one of the foremost cinematographers of his generation. Lighting Fahrenheit 451, Far From The Madding Crowd, Lawrence Of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago, he captured celluloid magic for François Truffaut, John Schlesinger and David Lean.\n\nSandy once told me that a Nic Roeg film is only appreciated by wider audience many years later and I put that to Nic. What was it like not to have that validation from both critics and audiences alike? \"Lonely\" came the reply. \"It makes you feel lonely. My name is above the title and the backlash and reviews made me feel lonely. It can upset you.\"\n\nWithout wishing to be overdramatic my heart sank. Here was one of my all-time favourites telling me that the critical bashing he had to endure had made him feel cast adrift. I, too, felt low with this admission.\n\nA few months later myself, Sandy and my Coattail Publishing partner, Steve Wilkin, had been invited to Hamburg to witness the Stones kick off their European tour. Nursing a few drinks in the hotel bar I told the guys of Nic's admission. Quickly I formed a plan to show Nic just how loved he was by his contemporaries. With Harriet's blessing I set about asking many who had been touched and influenced by his work to speak to me.\n\nSo, running alongside finishing Performance, I cast my investigative net out to the great and good of the arts with the idea to form another book, A Man Who Fell To Earth, a celebration of Nic Roeg, which I aim to finish in the new year and find a publisher, but, suffice to say, everyone I contacted has agreed to speak to me, such is the love and admiration for the mercurial Nic Roeg.\n\nBrian Cox (actor)\n\nSadly I never got to work with Nic. I did actually go up for his film Eureka and there was one point that it looked like I was going to do it, but sadly it never happened. But it didn't deter my thinking that he is one of the greatest ever film-makers.\n\nAnjelica Huston (actor)\n\n“There is nobody like Nic. He is such an adorable man, such a fantastic artist and completely unique. I adore him and I adored working with him. He had such a deep penetration and immersion into his subject matter, in our case Roald Dahl's Witches.”\n\nJarvis Cocker (musician)\n\n“I became fascinated with Nic Roeg after seeing his films on TV as a kid. At that age you are not looking at who the director was, they just resonated with me. Nic's films use the camera to tell a story; what's being said is not really the point of a scene. He is really a proper film-maker in that respect. He will find ways to manipulate the image to get his point across. I really connected too with how much he loves to mess about with time.”\n\nSam Taylor-Johnson (film-maker)\n\n“It was actually Nic's films that inspired me to make the short film Love You More. The feeling of wanting to be a film-maker and realising that wanting to be a film-maker does not mean that you have to give up your artistic stripes. I ended up contacting Nic and went over and chatted with him. I wanted to understand how you do a great love scene and he said you don't need to ask me, you know how to do it. I sat there a little dejected thinking, ‘That's not advice!’ He followed that up by saying just trust your instincts and you'll know how to do it. And it was, of course, the right advice.”\n\n**Terry Gilliam (film-maker) **\n\n“I am in constant turmoil watching Nic's films. But at least they stick with me and that is what I love about him. I have no idea how they are made. I don’t understand the reason they are made. That is why he intrigues me: he does stuff that is difficult, he makes it difficult for himself. It is interesting because of that. You are dealing with someone who is making something that is utterly unquiet and personal and nobody else could do it. That is the stuff that I love.”\n\nIrvine Welsh (writer)\n\n“You had Cammell and Roeg with their literary references, who came together to skilfully blend them all in Performance. They grabbed a train of thought and went with it. This is why it really resonates and so many films have referenced it since. Performance, like Lindsay Anderson's If, Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange and Get Carter, films which were a kinda rejection of the British kitchen-sink dramas. Performance has an influential place in the world of film and it’s had a huge effect on film-makers. I loved how they took the studio's money and spunked it on an art house movie. Kinda ballsy!”\n\nRIP, Nicolas Roeg, a cinematic poet and man who did indeed fall to earth.\n\nNow read:\n\nJoe Alwyn on working with Sir Ben Kingsley and the role of Mr Taylor Swift\n\nChamber Music: About The Wu-Tang (in 36 Pieces) unlocks the nine-piece puzzle\n\nMeet the mastermind behind those epic Fantastic Beasts costumes"
