        "text": "The World Cup, beautiful music, dangerous defenders and recreational drumming – all the meanderings of a lapsed football fan.\n\nIt had been a long time since I have watched a football match. The opportunity arose on Saturday 22 October, for me to take myself to the newly refurbished Meadowbank Stadium and watch the mighty F.C. Edinburgh take on the pride of Lanarkshire, Airdrieonians. This is not a football report but to explain why my mind wandered away from football, to music to film and video and prawns. I should explain that the result, despite Airdrieonians equalising in the 47th minute, wasn’t a game that Edinburgh ever looked like they were going to lose. Another reason for shutting down and meandering through the back corridors of this old head, was the accompanying drumming. That, and the predictable goings-on on the pitch meant my mind wandered (a lot).\n\nIn the olden days, I used to attend Meadowbank to watch football in an amiable silence marred only by an off or on the ball incident which elicited some response from the crowd. When I say crowd, I mean the few hundred diehards who frequented the stadium of a Saturday afternoon.\n\nBack to the F.C. Edinburgh v Airdrieonians and my meanderings. Like flicking through channels on the TV with a remote control, I move back and forward through years of stored rubbish in my head. Whilst the young footballers attempted to gain the upper hand on their opponents and the young drummers recreate the word Ed-in-burggghhhhh. I stop off at a point many years ago…\n\nFor a time, I was a member of the Edinburgh Cine and Video Club. For one Halloween night, many Halloween nights ago, the members were charged with the task of producing a film/video of things that scared us. I had collected a lot of video clips to cut together a kind of ‘pop’ video of scary things such as heights and prawns, and scariest of all, Dave McPherson scoring an own goal in the 1993 Rangers v Hibernian Scottish League Cup Final at Hampden – a low diving header into the corner of his own net. At the other end of the park this would have been a stunning goal. Thankfully for Mr McPherson, his team scored two goals to cancel out his error. All of this and more were set to the soundtrack of a hauntingly beautiful work by the 17th century Italian composer Lotti, his Crucifixus a8. It was maybe a bit obvious to set ugly, scary images to beautiful music, but I like it and it worked. I managed to enrage one member who walked out, I still don’t know whether it was heights, prawns or Dave McPherson which maddened him.\n\nAntonio Lotti was born in 1667, he lived most of his life in Venice, beginning and ending there, his middle years were spent in Germany. The Crucifixus is perhaps his most well-known work. There is some confusing information out there about Antonio Lotti and writings on the composer spending more time, bafflingly, talking of the things he didn’t do and the works he didn’t write, rather than the things he did. Apart from his middle years in which he wrote many secular works, mostly for the theatre, most of his output is devoted to the church and his last 20 years at San Marco in Venice was devoted to his sacred writings.\n\nIt is half-time and the score remains 1-1. During the break, as Meadowbank does not have a Tannoy, I read the scores for all the other Scottish football matches played today.\n\nThe second half resumes.\n\nA short 12 minutes later my attention was drawn back to the events in Meadowbank, what should be an easy clearance for the Airdrie keeper spun off his glove and into his net. 2 – 1.\n\nAs mentioned, Meadowbank does not have the joy of a Tannoy system. Or if it does, they didn’t inflict it on us during this match.\n\nFootball teams around the country use Tannoy systems to play music to usher teams onto the pitch or onto success. The music used could be described as from the sublime to the ridiculous, a cliché well worth trotting out at this point and as this is a blog about football and music, both no stranger to the odd, overused cliché.\n\nJust a short hop from where I sit at my kitchen table writing this, is Easter Road, home of Hibernian F.C. Often heard there is the evocative “Sunshine on Leith” by the Proclaimers. It is unexpectantly moving to hear that song sung there by a near capacity crowd, men, women and children all giving voice to their anthem.\n\nHibernian’s arch-rivals across the city at Tynecastle park, Heart of Midlothian or as the song says, “H-E–A-R-T-S, if you cannae spell it then here’s what it says, Hearts, Hearts, glorious Hearts”. This song has welcomed teams to Tynecastle for very many years, recorded by Hector Nicol and the Kelvin Country Dance Band. Hector and his band also recorded “Glory, Glory to the Hibees”, for Hibernian F.C., “the Terrors of Tanadice” for Dundee United FC and “Dark blues of Dundee”, for Dundee FC. Hector was prolific in the football song department. St Mirren-supporting Nicol (1920-1985) was a Scottish born singer and composer of football songs, successful and admired as an actor and comedian. His tragic personal life almost prematurely ended his performing career.\n\nLeicester City have been marching, or perhaps galloping on, to the Post Horn Gallop. This work by German born cornet virtuoso, Herman Koenig, has been a staple at the King Power Stadium. Koenig was a composer and designed a cornet which still bears his name. Koenig was well known to London audiences as a member of Louis Jullien’s Drury Lane Orchestra, with which he toured America in 1853.\n\nFor some reason Tottenham Hotspur enter to the portentous Duel of the Fates from “The Phantom Menace”, part of the Star Wars Franchise.\n\nStrangely, Watford FC and Everton both use the theme from the 60s TV favourite Z-Cars.\n\nRather predictably Southampton, known as the Saints march on to “When the Saints, go marching in”.\n\nThere are many more.\n\nThings at Meadowbank are coming to an end with the score stuck at 2-1. Airdrie are trying to find a goal to salvage something from a bad day and Edinburgh are defending, somewhat comfortably, with forays into their opponents’ half with the hope of extending their lead. The citizens are happy and drumming to show their delight. Airdrie fans are winding their way home perhaps having given up on a last-minute equaliser.\n\nWith moments to go in the match at Meadowbank, I think perhaps I should concentrate more on what’s happening in front of me but I am distracted by the thought that we are in a World Cup year. I replay some of the golden musical moments of World Cups past. For someone of my years, Scotland’s appearances at World Cups are a distant memory and we are only left with the hope that one day it might happen again, we might just qualify. Not this year though. For those that intend to watch, this year’s controversial World Cup starts on 20 November.\n\nSoon the broadcasting companies will unveil their branding for these shows and music which, in past years, has become famous for introducing World Cup highlights and no doubt this year will do so again. Something will rival Nessun Dorma or The Pavane by Faure.\n\nThe pick of the BBC’s theme music over the years was in 1982, when they used from the musical, Cats by Andrew Lloyd Webber, The Jellicle Cat.\n\nFor the 1990 opening credits they used Nessun Dorma from Turandot by Puccini.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, in 1994 for the World Cup in America, the BBC chose the Aria America from Leonard Bernstein’s musical West Side Story.\n\nFor the 1998 World Cup in France and the last time Scotland appeared, the BBC chose the Pavane by Faure sedate, poised and for some, typically French.\n\nJump forward one World Cup, to the 2006 finals in Germany and the BBC chose the music of a German born naturalised Englishman, George Fredrich Handel and a chorus from Judas Maccabaeus.\n\nProbably one of the biggest add-on events of the World Cups was the concert(s) by the Three Tenors, Placido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Jose Carreras with the conductor, Zubin Mehta. An open-air extravaganza which took place on the eve of the World Cup final in the Baths of Caracalla. This live broadcast event spawned an industry which would continue till their last concert together in 2003. The three sang together in the next World Cups and toured stadia around the world.\n\nAt Meadowbank Stadium, the 90 minutes have come and gone and we are in extra time. With each attack by the plucky Airdrieonians, they are left dangerously open at the back and in the 95th minute Edinburgh take advantage of the gaps and score a third. And as Kenneth Wolstenholme said 56 years ago at the World Cup at Wembley, “come on ye, F. C. Ed-in-burgghhhhhh!”\n\nNo, he didn’t. He famously said, “some people are on the pitch, they think it’s all over. It is now”.\n\nIt is over for F. C. Edinburgh, and it is over for Airdrieonians. No one was on the pitch and there was no great surprise at the outcome. The drummers drummed and the players left the pitch to muted applause, and we all wind our merry ways home. Sometimes at football grounds you are sent home to the sound of music, sometimes to the sound of the Tannoy announcing the scores from around the grounds, but on Saturday 22 October at Meadowbank Stadium it is a general hum of quiet conversation.\n\nA lot of the music mentioned is available at our streaming site Naxos Music.\n\nMaybe the next article will be classical composers, singers, musicians, songwriters and Popes who were footballers or avid fans of the game, like Shostakovitch, a lifelong supporter of Zenit Leningrad. Until then, check out these football related albums at Naxos, including an album called “Good Sport! nostalgic music for the armchair athlete”.\n\nFor the past 25 weeks or so, we have been writing articles based on our A-Z of music, music inspired by Space, RSNO, Trains, Nixon in China, Joe Hisaishi and so on. As we go to the end of the alphabet we have been putting some thought to XYZ and who or what should be represented in those articles. I immediately thought of Y for Yamashta, Stomu Yamashta (or Yamash’ta), a Japanese born percussionist and composer who created the Red Buddha theatre and the show “The Man from the East”.\n\nWhen we were carving up the alphabet between us, I claimed Y for Yamashta and thought no more of it till just this week when I actually sat down to write this article. I began to think about why my first thought was Stomu Yamashta. Was it because it is probably the only Y I know, which it probably is, and what did I actually know about him, what did I know of his music?\n\nThe truthful answer is not much, and I realised that whole wish to write this is based on a 48 year old experience which has remained with me and although the images are not strong, the feeling and the effects that the music and the experience had on me, is. The music has been with me, I had the soundtrack album on vinyl and then on CD so, the music has always been with me.\n\nI have owned a copy of the soundtrack album, since practically the day after I saw the show, and now in these days of downloads and streaming I can access it on the internet whenever it pops into my head, which because I am writing about it, it is now an ever present earworm.\n\nI was a very young 12 year old with an fledgling talented musician, older brother, who was trying to experience and soak up as many musical happenings as he could. Thinking back that seems an easier thing to do to then, than now. I have a feeling that my brother had heard of Stomu Yamashta and his Red Buddha Theatre and its mix of Jazz, Rock and Japanese Kabuki theatre, and thought to himself that this was something that he should see and more importantly that I should see also. Somehow he persuaded our father that he should allow us to go.\n\nA few things strike me at this point, I was 12 and this show’s content should, almost certainly, have come with a warning. The show contained nudity and scenes which must have been upsetting and unsettling, given its subject matter, the events in Hiroshima only 28 years before this show was devised, the dropping of the nuclear bomb.\n\nPerhaps, Glasgow City Council, in those far off days of yore were less aware of theatre content. Even as I say that, I doubt that is not fully true, I can remember the furore over the performances of Hair the Musical, which played at Jimmy Logan’s Metropole Theatre. I can remember my parents going to see this, to see what the fuss was about, I was nine or ten and “The Fuss” was never explained to me. And so a 16 year old and his 12 year old brother were allowed to attended The Man from the East, a much sought after ticket – a theatrical event.\n\nAs far as I can remember these performances took place twice in Glasgow. I saw it at the Kings Theatre in 1973 and then the performance was repeated at the Proms the following year, 1974.\n\nI wish I could remember more of this experience, but the images are few. A sunrise, a busy commuter subway, homeless older people scrabbling for food and young girl and her grandmother desperately looking for somewhere safe to lay down their heads. Layering of images, mixing multiple things on stage at one time. Being a mix of Kabuki and Rock/Jazz Music there were performers with masks and highly decorated faces and costumes, a spectacle which jarred with some of the more ordinary naturalistically dressed performers. Even as I write that I wonder how true my memories are, or if I have devised my own show to go with the music I know well.\n\nI am afraid to say we do not have much of Stomu Yamashta’s work in the library’s collection. We used to have a copy of the Man from The East on CD, I think, many years ago before I worked here. I persuaded the then Music Librarian that he should have a copy of this in the collection, unfortunately it is no longer the case. Perhaps someone liked it as much as I did.\n\nTsutomu Yamashita, or as he called himself, Stomu Yamashta was born in Kyoto on the 15 March 1947. He attended Kyoto Academy of Music in 1960 and one year later joined both the Kyoto and Osaka Philharmonic Orchestras as a percussionist. He also worked for the Tokyo Film Studios, a prodigious and precocious talent who made his debut as a soloist in 1963. A year later he was in America studying first at the Interlochen Arts Academy, then at Berklee School of Jazz in Boston. In those study years he also took on many engagements as a player and a soloist, notable a bravura premiere of Heuwell Tircuit’s Concerto for Solo Percussion, playing more than 47 different instruments.\n\nHe was sought after by the most noteworthy of the 20th century’s composers Hans Werner Henze, Toru Takemitsu, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies with Henze and Davies writing works for him.\n\nWith Steve Winwood, Michael Shieve, Klaus Schulze and Al Di Meola he formed the legendary group supergroup GO, they recorded two albums Go, and Go Too and a concert performance in France, Yamashta started the group in 1976 and they were active for two years. With Morris Pert he formed Come to the Edge, a collaboration which produced the album Floating Music and Morris Pert was also part of the Red Buddha Theatre. Yamashta formed and was the driving force behind the Red Buddha Theatre and their successful performances in London Paris and Glasgow and further European tour. His wife, violinist Hisako Yamashta has joined him in many of his projects most notably East Winds, a project which produced two albums One by One and Freedom is Frightening.\n\nSome of his music was used by Nicolas Roeg in the film The Man who fell to Earth. He also collaborated with Peter Maxwell Davies on the score for Ken Russell’s The Devils and with John Williams for John Altman’s film, Images. A driven innovator whose musical stylings straddled the worlds of the 20th century avantgarde to rock and jazz. Equally at home and equally a master of all these styles.\n\nThere are examples of the work of Stomu Yamashta and a lot of his collaborators on our Naxos Classics and Naxos Jazz music streaming sites. You can search there for Stomu Yamashta, Steve Winwood, Morris Pert, Al Di Meola, Michael Shrieve and Klaus Schulze.\n\nTo find out more about Stomu Yamashta, see also:\n\nPerfect Sound Forever: The Infinite Horizons of Stomu Yamash’ta\n\nListen to the world: Stomu Yamash’ta, The Man from the East\n\nor explore Stomu Yamashta’s other bands:\n\nEast Wind\n\nGo\n\nCome to the Edge.\n\nSome of the histories of the ukulele are quite exact about when its inventors arrived in Hawaii, their names, their place of origin and how the name ukulele came about.\n\nLet’s start with the name. Most of the ukulele histories, if they mention where the name originated, tell the story of the last king, and penultimate monarch, of the islands, Kalakaua. Kalakaua, himself a ukulele player, watched a player demonstrate their skills on the ukulele, their fast finger work and strumming techniques and the King likened the player’s finger work to that of a jumping flea, a ukulele.\n\n—- The Hawaiians had the word, ukulele, before the instrument appeared, it is the word that the islanders used for cat fleas. —-\n\nThis tale is recounted often in many slightly different ways, by many different people, this version is told by Alvin D Keech, ukulele player, teacher and maker and Hawaiian resident until 1915. Told as if he had actually been there, which he hadn’t, in an article written in 1931, which was reprinted in The Hawaiian Steel Guitar and Its Great Hawaiian Musicians.\n\n—- There is another version which has it that ukulele translates as ‘the gift that came here’. ‘Uku’ can translate as gift and ‘lele’ as coming or comes here, not jumping. —-\n\nThe instrument most mentioned as basis for the ukulele is the Machete de Braga or Braguinha, a 4 string, steel or gut strung instrument popular in Portugal and the Maderia Islands. In one very exact retelling of the arrival of this instrument in Hawaii, the Musician Joao Fernandez arrives in Honolulu Harbour in 1879 and plays his Braguinha and sings Portuguese folk songs, this retelling also mentions three Portuguese craftsmen, Manuel Nunes, Augusto Dias, and Jose do Espirito who arrived in Honolulu Harbour around the same time, and this version of the history of the ukulele, credits them with building the first true Hawaiian ukuleles, adaptions of Fernandez’s Braguinha. As with most stories the world over, when a tale has a recent past every family will have a version, some families will know someone who was the brother of the friend of someone who once knew the man/woman who held the strings as the maker of the first ukulele strung the first ukulele. There are many variations, differing slightly from the above, some more exact and detailed, some vaguer and blurry round the facts.\n\nThe main points to take from all the histories are that small 4/6 stringed instruments arrived in Honolulu from Portugal in the late 1870s. The instruments built on Hawaii based on the instruments brought into the island became what we know today as the ukulele. The instrument on which the ukulele is based, is most often cited as the Machete de Braga or Braguinha or Brinquinho. There seem to be many versions of these size of small string instruments often listed as sub-sets of the lute family. In an ethnomusicological listing they, ukuleles, are known as a composite chordophone. They appear the world over, their appearance and size is a requirement of their need to be portable. They are the instrument of the traveller, the sailor or soldier. Which explains why very similar sized and sounding instruments are found in many different places around the globe. The names are also very similar Machete de Braga, Braguinha, Brinquinho, Cavaquinho, Cuatro, Cavaco.\n\nMany of these instruments stayed in their eventual homes of Portugal, Brazil, Venezuela but the ukulele was the version of this family of instruments which conquered the world and continues to enchant, delight and entertain.\n\nIn 2015 the BBC, published a few online articles about the history of the ukulele and how to be a famous uke player etc etc, one of these articles included this list of ‘famous’ uke players Joe Strummer, Elvis Presley, George Harrison, John Lennon, Phil Jupitus, Paul McCartney, Adam Sandler, Frank Skinner, Gloria Swanson, Marlon Brando, Kate Pierson, Mick Fleetwood, Noel Fielding, Russell Brand, Poison Ivy, Pete Townshend, Elvis Costello, Kate Bush, Barack Obama, Doris Day, Marilyn Monroe, Adrian Edmondson, Benny Hill, Buster Keaton, Harry Hill, Joni Mitchell. This is a list a of famous players with a wide appeal, and this is not a comprehensive list. There are players from earlier generations and later, younger players who have a wide following on different social media channels. Fans following of uke players from the very earliest of superstars like Cliff Edwards known as Ukulele Ike, in the thirties, who was also the voice of Jiminy Cricket in Pinocchio, or George Formby, in the forties and fifties to recent stars like Jake Shimabukuro, Israel Kamakawiwo’ole and James Hill, mean that the uke has gone in and out of favour, as the stars who played the uke moved in and out of favour. It so happens that at the moment it is enjoying an especially purple patch.\n\nThe main overriding reason for its popularity and its longevity is, the uke is easy to pick up. Ukes are small, portable and within a short time, very short in some cases, you can know enough chords to sing along to your favourite hits or karaoke hot picks.\n\nUkes are also relatively inexpensive, not an easy thing to quantify, my inexpensive is different from the next uke player. I bought my first uke about eighteen years ago and it cost about £15, it was purple, and I got it from Rae Macintosh which at that time was still on Queensferry Street and it was a good starter uke. A criticism of lower priced starter ukes is that they don’t hold their tuning, slip out of tune easily, which can be true but my first one didn’t. If you look carefully good lower priced ukes are out there to find. Most of the tutors and teaching websites advise paying slightly more than that. Which is probably true, most of those sites recommend that paying between £40 to £80 which will get you a good first uke. After that, the sky is the limit on what you want to pay for a uke, a hand-built uke made to measure to your own preferences could start at around £5000. With my birthday coming up, my fingers are crossed.\n\nUkes come in various sizes, soprano, concert, tenor, baritone and bass. The ones probably most seen are either the soprano which is about 17/19 inches long or the concert which is slightly larger at about 21 inches in length. The four strings of the soprano or concert uke are tuned to G,C,E,A. The G string is normally tuned higher than the C string, so in uke circles they say, it sounds like, or to use the ‘My Dog Has Fleas’ tuning. This kind of tuneful mnemonic refers to the way American children were taught in the sixties. This tuning is known as re-entrant tuning, although, some players prefer to tune the G string lower than the C string this is known as linear tuning. Some players prefer to tune their ukes to ADF#B, this one tone higher makes the string tighter. The GCEA tuning is most common for the soprano, concert and tenor ukes, The baritone is different as usually it is linear tuned DGBE which is the same as the top four strings of the guitar. Soprano, concert, tenor, baritone is a matter of choice and what feels most comfortable in your hands.\n\nThere is also a wide variety of shapes and colours of ukes out there. In the beginning of the uke, most resembling a small guitar. Then there was, what became known as the pineapple uke which, as its name suggests has the curving shape of a Pineapple, without the knobbly bits. In approximately 1916/17, the banjolele’s first appearance is credited to makers Alvin D Keech and John A Bolander. Marketed as a banjo ukulele or banjolele it had the body of a banjo and the neck and tuning of the ukulele, so it is a cut and shut job!\n\nMost famously, this was the instrument of choice of George Formby, world-famous, English comedian, actor and singer-songwriter.\n\nUke Tales: a story often told\n\nAPRIL 11, 2019\n\nby Sandor Nagyszalanczy\n\nOn this web blog, Sander tells a long story about buying a uke in the home of uke’s Hawaii and about the importance of how you make your choice, play it and if it sounds right to you, then that’s probably your uke.\n\nWith the most recent upsurge in the popularity of the uke you can find all shapes and sizes, there are flying V ukes, round ukes, cigar box ukes, oil can ukes, electric ukes, resonator ukes.\n\nI mentioned I got my first uke about eighteen years ago. I first came across the ukulele, properly when watching the “Concert for George” broadcast on the BBC on the 16 April 2004.\n\nGeorge Harrison, Beatle, film producer, composer, lyricist, husband, guitarist, ukuleleist, died on the 29 November 2001. One year later, on the 29 November 2002 his widow, Olivia Harrison organised a ‘Concert for George’. The Concert for George was a get together of a lot a George’s friends, mostly musicians that he had played with over the years. It was a happy joyous jam session/concert which was rounded off by the incomparable Joe Brown, one of George’s oldest friends and fellow uke player. He sang the beautiful Gus Kahn/Isham Jones song, “I’ll see you in my Dreams”, which I, tired and emotional after wrangling my children to bed found Joe Brown’s unsentimental delivery, emotional and moving.\n\nAs with a lot of things in this world, I am almost sorry this song has become so popular. I wanted this to be my little secret, my favourite song which I could choose to let people know about, but I think lots of people know about it, and since the Concert for George, this song has practically become Joe Brown’s theme song. This for me is part of the joy of the uke and instruments like the uke. They are fun, plinky plonky, cheery happy-go-lucky little musical instruments which shouldn’t hold much emotional sway but they do, and is that the musician, the song or the time and the place? Maybe its all of the above, music and its impact on you is such an amalgam of time and place, story and people, music and musician.\n\nThis little jumping flea packs a joyous punch in many ways. The uke is one of the wonders of the world, which makes everyone just a bit more equal and a bit more happy, whether you are strumming your three chord version of Stairway to Heaven or fingerpicking your own arrangement of a Bach Violin Partita for the uke, you are a uke player like all the people mentioned in this article, now try not to let it become an obsession.\n\n*******************************************\n\nAs a wee postscript, my birthday has just passed and there was no ukulele, hand-built to my specifications, at an eyewatering price, but there was a rather lovely banjolele, given to me by my lovely family. They are yet to find out just how annoying I can be with, My Little Ukulele in my Hand.\n\nWe have made two playlists with some suggestions for uke listening on Naxos Music Library and Naxos Jazz.\n\nWe’ve reached S in our Musical Alphabet and Natasha from the Music Library invites you to turn your gaze skywards and listen…\n\nSpace. It’s the final frontier, or so they say. An infinite inky blanket, bejewelled by galaxies, nebulas, planets, comets, moons, and stars. So vast it’s almost unfathomable, so much unknown that it can be a little disconcerting, so breathtaking in its awe-inspiring beauty. It’s fascinated me for the longest time; for many years, my parents’ Collins Gem book entitled The Night Sky would often accompany me on my adventures. I might not have been able to digest the technical language when I was 6 but it didn’t stop me from pouring over page after page of constellation maps, pretending to charter my own journey to the stars (in a very similar fashion to Daffy Duck in Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century). I still find myself involuntarily craning my neck towards a clear sky to see how many stars and constellations I can spot (even with that Collins Gem book being omnipresent, I can still only really identify three). It’s little wonder that space and its mystique provides huge inspiration to so many and musicians are certainly no exception.\n\nAlmost certainly the most famous original composition inspired by celestial bodies is Gustav Holst’s The Planets, an orchestral suite in which each of its seven movements is inspired by a planet in our solar system and its significance in astrology. A conversation about astrology whilst on holiday in Spain in 1913 with composer and teacher Balfour Gardiner and the Bax brothers – composer Arnold and writer Clifford – set the groundwork for Holst’s composition as he became greatly intrigued by the subject. Inspirations for the piece are said to include Five Pieces for Orchestra by Arnold Schoenberg – Holst having attended one of the performances held in London in 1912 and 1914 – and the booklet What is a Horoscope? by astrologer Alan Leo. The movements Mercury, the Winged Messenger and Neptune, the Mystic take their names from Leo’s works.\n\nHolst’s daughter, Imogen, stated that her father struggled with the structure of pieces such as symphonies and so enjoyed composing a suite in which each movement is distinct. The instrumentation for the suite is intentionally grand in order to capture the scale and colour needed to convey the subject matter. The Planets‘ premiere took place on 29th September 1918, a private performance conducted by Adrian Boult, organised by Gardiner and given as a farewell to Holst, who was about to be stationed in Salonika to teach music to troops during the final stages of World War I. It was a hastily organised affair: the orchestra only saw the music two hours before the performance and the soprano and alto chorus needed for Neptune was recruited from both Morley College and St Paul’s Girls School, institutions at which Holst taught. Holst inscribed Boult’s copy of the score: “This copy is the property of Adrian Boult who first caused the Planets to shine in public and thereby earned the gratitude of Gustav Holst.” The first three public performances of the suite were incomplete. The first of these, held on 27th February 1919, was again conducted by Boult and he made the decision to only perform five of the seven movements, his reasoning being that the public was not ready for the new musical experience the work presented. Holst disliked incomplete performances, and was particularly dissatisfied if Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity was the last movement. He felt this provided too much of a happy ending compared to real life (the suite’s final movement Neptune is much more open-ended and eerie). The entirety of the suite wasn’t performed in public until 15 November 1920, marking the first time Neptune was played for the public.\n\nComposed between 1914 and 1917, Holst had originally planned for the seven movements to match the order of the planets, starting with Mercury, the last to be composed in 1916. However, Holst decided that planetary order should give way to musical merit, beginning the suite with the much more sinister Mars, the Bringer of War, the first movement to be completed. Despite Holst’s preference for the work to be a unified piece, sections such as Mars and Jupiter have become incredibly famous away from the rest of the suite. Part of this is down to Holst himself; he agreed to the central theme of Jupiter, Thaxted (named after the village where Holst lived for much of his life), to be used as the tune for the hymn I Vow To Thee My Country. Imogen Holst noted that when her father was asked to set Sir Cecil Spring Rice’s words to music, he was relieved to find that they fit to Thaxted as he was over-worked. Though initially maligned by critics, The Planets has become one of the most popular and recognisable works of classical music of the last hundred years.\n\nThe dwarf planet, Pluto, was discovered thirteen years after the completion of The Planets and four years before Holst’s death in 1934. Holst had no interest adding the new ninth planet to his work as he had become frustrated that the suite’s popularity eclipsed his other work. Other composers have taken up the challenge of portraying Pluto, including Leonard Bernstein’s improvised Pluto, the Unpredictable. The most well-known depiction, Pluto, the Renewer, was composed by Colin Matthews, having been commissioned by Kent Nagano and the Hallé Orchestra in 2000 as an addition to Holst’s suite (Pluto was still classified as a planet at this point). In his thoughts listed in the piece’s premiere programme notes, Matthews notes he felt Holst’s work finished perfectly with Neptune fading into deeper space, wondering how he could add to it. With Pluto’s astrological significance proving a little hazy and, having labelled himself a sceptic, Matthews decided to forgo this aspect (bar the piece’s title) and chose to start Pluto where Neptune finished; he even adapted the end of Neptune to run straight into Pluto for performance. Matthews has stated that, with so little known about Pluto, he was inspired by solar winds and comets on the edge of the solar system, informing the fast tempo and bombastic elements of the piece. Matthews dedicated the work to Imogen Holst, with whom he had worked with, and notes that he “suspect[s she] would have been both amused and dismayed by this venture”.\n\nHolst’s suite has been a source of inspiration to many over the years and a very notable example is another iconic space-themed score. John Williams’ work on the Star Wars films has become so instantly recognisable that even those unfamiliar with the series can easily hum the main theme or The Imperial March. Williams was recommended to George Lucas, the writer/director of the first Star Wars film, Episode IV: A New Hope, by Lucas’ friend, Stephen Spielberg. Williams’ work on Spielberg’s film Jaws certainly helped add an extra dimension to the story – primarily with the infamous, incredibly threatening main theme – and he was rewarded with an Academy Award for Best Original Score. Lucas originally wanted to use existing music for the soundtrack to Star Wars (something he later came to deny), stating that the music would help the audience connect to the fantastical setting. This stylistic choice would have echoed the soundtrack to 2001: A Space Odyssey, a great source of inspiration for Lucas’ epic space-opera. The composers and pieces Lucas chose served as basis on which Williams developed his score. Consequently, there are some striking similarities within Williams’ score to Holst’s Mars movement, Erich Korngold’s theme for the film Kings Row, and Igor Stravinsky’s The Rite of Spring. Williams also scored the other eight films within the three Star Wars trilogies, with nods to contemporaries such as Hans Zimmer, Tan Dun, and Howard Shore.\n\nThe Star Wars scores contain a large number of leitmotifs, most representing particular characters or concepts. These themes aren’t always used to fit the narrative (i.e. the character they are written for isn’t the main focus of the scene) but instead they are used to compliment the atmosphere of the scene. Williams incorporated as much new material as possible with each passing film, though several themes are present across the series: for instance, Old Ben’s Theme, which later became known as The Force Theme, appears more than one hundred times across the trilogies. The result is a behemoth of film music; Williams won, amongst many other awards, the Best Original Score Academy Award for the original Star Wars soundtrack, whilst the album became the best-selling symphonic album of all time.\n\nIn the battle of the main space media franchises, you’ll find Star Wars in one corner and its predecessor, Star Trek, in the other. The Star Trek canon is now comprised of ten TV series, thirteen films, and various other adaptations but it all began with the Original Series, first broadcast in 1966. Created by Gene Roddenberry, the series followed the crew of the USS Enterprise as they explored the reaches of space. If you were ever unsure of the premise of the show, the opening monologue before the theme tune would always enlighten you, with the Enterprise’s mission detailed by the ship’s captain: Captain James T. Kirk immortalised by William Shatner’s unusual cadence in The Original Series, followed by an updated version given in Sir Patrick Stewart’s sonorous tones as Captain Jean-Luc Picard in the The Next Generation (my personal favourite series in the franchise), which first aired in 1987.\n\nThe theme for The Original Series was composed by Alexander Courage and featured soprano Loulie Jean Norman singing the wordless melody. Roddenberry had written lyrics for the theme, though these were never used. This was his intention in order to claim a co-composer credit and earn half of the theme’s royalties. Courage, who was displeased with Roddenberry’s unethical strategy, was not the only one who suffered in such a fashion: Norman’s singing was removed from the third season theme so she wasn’t paid any royalties. The Next Generation’s theme is an adaptation of the theme for Star Trek: The Motion Picture, composed by Jerry Goldsmith. The first two series’ themes begin with the same quiet opening notes to introduce their captains’ monologues, before diving into fast-paced and sweeping melodies to stir up a sense of adventure in the viewer. The themes for the third and fourth entities in the Star Trek canon, Deep Space Nine and Voyager – composed by Dennis McCarthy and Goldsmith respectively – are much more sombre in tone to reflect the more sorrowful storylines. All the themes utilise brass instruments to help set the tone of each series, evoking feelings of grandeur, anguish, and daring.\n\nOf course, there is one giant of the science-fiction genre that does not use any original music at all. Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey features a soundtrack that is entirely comprised of existing classical music. Pieces by Richard Strauss, Johann Strauss II, György Ligeti, and Aram Khachaturium are used in the film inspired by the prolific science-fiction author Arthur C. Clarke’s short story The Sentinel (Clarke also co-wrote the screenplay with Kubrick). The juxtaposition of the music and the visuals in the film help raise each element to new heights; it’s almost impossible to hear Richard Strauss’ tone poem Also sprach Zarathustra and not picture the Dawn of Man sequence, or Johann Strauss II’s waltz The Blue Danube without envisaging the space station-docking scene (or any of the many parodies these scenes have spawned). Ligeti’s music was suggested to Kubrick by his wife, Christiane, and Charlene Pederson, who heard pieces on the BBC whilst creating sculptures of aliens for Kubrick. Ligeti’s work certainly helps to bring a sense of the unearthly and unease to the film, particularly considering much of the film is dialogue-free. The sweet love song Daisy Bell, written by Harry Dacre, takes on a different tone when sung by the computer HAL 9000. This was included in the screenplay and subsequent novel by Clarke as he had seen the first instance of computer speech synthesis, which happened to be an IBM 704 programmed to sing Daisy Bell in 1962.\n\nHowever, a number of composers were approached to score 2001 during production. The first, British composer Frank Cordell, has said that his work was primarily arrangements of Gustav Mahler pieces; this score was never released. A full score by American composer Alex North, with whom Kubrick had worked on Sparticus and Dr. Strangelove, was recorded after North persuaded Kubrick that guide tracks were not needed and he could achieve Kubrick’s vision with entirely new music. Despite North’s efforts, Kubrick disliked and dismissed the score and chose to use the guide pieces that we hear in the film. Kubrick later stated that he did not see the point in using work by film composers, however good they may be, when they were never going to be as good as composers such as Mozart or Beethoven. North was unaware his work was scrapped from the film until he attended its premiere, leaving him devastated and humiliated. In 1993, two years after North’s death, the aforementioned Jerry Goldsmith conducted and produced a recording of North’s 2001 score and a later recording, produced in 2007 by Intrada Records, contained cues to allow the listener to match the music precisely to its intended place in the film.\n\nOne of the most recent and notable pieces drawing on space for inspiration is Virtual Choir 5: Deep Field by Eric Whitacre. Beginning with Virtual Choir 1: Lux Aurumque in 2009, Whitacre has championed the ability to create music with others without the need to be present together. Virtual Choir 5 featured in a 2018 film detailing the story of the Hubble Space Telescope and its Deep Field images: Deep Field: The Impossible Magnitude of our Universe. From one (relatively) small section of sky in the Ursa Major constellation, the Hubble Space Telescope captured images of over 3,000 galaxies that were previously undiscovered over an eleven day period in December 1995. In collaboration with scientists and visualisers from the Space Telescope Science Institute, Whitacre’s music echoes the beauty and magnificence of the astounding images. The choir itself is composed of over 8,000 voices from 126 countries. Whitacre thought that Virtual Choir 5 would be his last, having stated he had no idea how he could follow the majesty of space. However, the overwhelming need for a sense of community during the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in Whitacre writing a new piece specifically for Virtual Choir 6: Sing Gently; over 17,500 singers from 129 countries participated (I was fortunate enough to be one of them).\n\nNew discoveries about the universe are constant and no doubt will be a source of inspiration for many more musicians to come. Of course, there are many pieces and songs that I haven’t touched upon here – Debussy’s Clair de Lune, David Bowie’s Space Oddity, Terry Riley and Kronos Quartet’s Sun Rings, to name a few. For now, I’ll tilt my head back towards the sky and hum the Red Dwarf theme to myself.\n\nYou can find a playlist of these space-related pieces on our Naxos Classical catalogue, as well as related items in our collections at the Music Library.\n\nThere is a wealth of novels which have music, musical instruments, musicians or composers at their core, fictionalised accounts of real people and real accounts of fictionalised characters. Annie Proulx’s Accordion Crimes, a wonderful account of the century long journey and the owners of an accordion from Sicily to America, or Vikram Seth’s An Equal Music, the long story of a break up and a reconciliation, of sorts. Nick Hornby’s High Fidelity or Roddy Doyle’s The Commitments, the list is long covering all kinds of music and all kinds of fiction. We asked a few of our colleagues to pick their favourites and review them for you here.\n\nDouglas from the Music Library takes a look/listen to this audiobook available at Overdrive, The Noise of Time by Julian Barnes.\n\nA fictionalised biography of Dmitri Shostakovich which through three “meetings with power” lays out for us the very great compromises made by artistic communities in Russia during the reign of Stalin and Khrushchev. The novel opens with Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich awaiting his fate, sitting with his packed suitcase in the hallway outside his apartment. Waiting for the lift doors to open and two men in suits to come for him and take him to the Big House. Where he could expect a bullet to the head for his artistic crimes, listed in a Pravda article, probably written by Stalin, denouncing his Opera “Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk”. The first of two killer assassinations, by the state, of this work.\n\nThe dates, the names, the compositions, the main events are all as they should be, in this imagined version of a very real life. How Dmitri Dmitriyevich reacts and comments through his internal and external monologues and conversations are for the greatest part down to Julian Barnes. It is this commentary which, one main thread of the novel, makes us question the veracity of any of Shostakovich’s written dialogue with the world. The Shostakovich of the novel comments on this saying his written output will be worthless to future scholars of his thoughts and deeds. Through the novel Dmitri Dmitriyevich alludes to how the state put words in his mouth or wrote words which were attributed to him.\n\nAt his death, of heart failure on August 9 1975, Shostakovich was probably one of the most successful soviet composers of the 20th century. But is his legacy and his survival, that of a man who did what he did to stay alive, and keep his family alive, or is it that the things he did and said, he truly believed, because he was a party man, leading a charmed life. Whichever of those statements you believe, few of us will ever be made to examine ourselves and the strength of our believes and how strongly we would hold on to those believes in the face of imprisonment or death.\n\nI recommend you don’t listen to this as an audiobook when you are out for your daily constitutional, it could end in tears.\n\nBorrow The Noise of Time as an audiobook\n\nDoris from Central Library introduces Daisy Jones and the Six by Taylor Jenkins Reid\n\nThis evocative novel captures the hedonistic lifestyle of a fictional Los Angeles-based seventies band, The Six. Though the band is made up, Taylor Jenkins Reid has made no secret of her love of Stevie Nicks and The Six is reportedly inspired by Fleetwood Mac.\n\nDaisy Jones and The Six experience highs and lows over a period of years, revealed through interviews with a journalist and written as transcripts. Readers witness the accelerated rise to fame of Daisy Jones and the Six, the struggles of producing a hit album and being on tour and the eventual breakdown of the band.\n\nComplicated relationships are at the heart of the novel. Not only is there the romantic entanglement between Daisy Jones and Billy Dunne, the married front man of the group, but the tension between Billy and his brother Graham is well written, as are the interactions between the other members of the band. Big personalities and tortured souls feature heavily in this book, adding a vibrancy and sadness to the novel.\n\nI read Daisy Jones and the Six during the first lockdown in April 2020. Given that we were unable to escape to sunnier and warmer climes, this made the book even more poignant. While plane rides to California were off limits, it certainly made me listen to Fleetwood Mac’s album Rumours with a renewed perspective.\n\nBorrow Daisy Jones and the Six as an ebook or an audiobook\n\nBronwen from the Art & Design and Music team tells us about Polly Samson’s A Theatre for Dreamers\n\nIf ever there was a book to transport us to a world of sea, sun and bohemia Polly Samson’s novel A Theatre for Dreamers would top the bill! Set on the Greek island of Hydra in 1960, through the eyes of our narrator Erica we are dropped into the artistic set living on the island that includes the authors Charmian Cliff and George Johnstone and the Norwegian couple author Axel Jensen and wife Marianne Ihlen. Into their lives comes the young Canadian, charismatic musician and poet Leonard Cohen who meets his muse Marianne and turns the lives of this bohemian set around as we see musician and muse increasingly drawn to each other.\n\nErica is fulfilling her late mother’s dream for her to experience an adventure and though Erica is largely outside the main events, we see her eyes opened and innocence lost as wars are waged between the bohemian men and the women on the island over their respective allotted writing time contrasting with the locals who struggle to make a living and feed their families and for whom art is not an option. This book is blissful escapism and captures a period of time in the life of Leonard Cohen.\n\nLeonard Cohen lived on Hydra 1960 to 1967 and continued to make short visits throughout his life right up to his death in 2016.\n\nBorrow A Theatre for Dreamers as an ebook or an audiobook, and sample interpretations of Cohen’s music on Naxos Jazz. Go to playlists and select Listen and Read and select the Leonard Cohen playlist.\n\nOur colleague Fumiko, is normally based in Morningside Library but during the post lockdown period she joined us in Central Library, below she tells us about the author Murakami and his book Norwegian Wood.\n\n‘I was thirty-seven then, strapped in my seat as the huge 747 plunged through dense cloud cover on approach to the Hamburg airport. Cold November rains drenched the earth and lent everything the gloomy air of a Flemish landscape: the ground crew in rain gear, a flag atop a squat airport building, a BMW billboard. So—Germany again.\n\nOnce the plane was on the ground, soft music began to flow from the ceiling speakers: a sweet orchestral cover version of the Beatles’ ‘Norwegian Wood’. The melody never failed to send a shudder through me, but this time it hit me harder than ever.’\n\n— Haruki Murakami’s ‘Norwegian Wood’ starts with these lines.\n\nMurakami uses various genre of music in his books from pop, rock, jazz to classic music, which attracts many readers. Since I like to listen to any type of music, it was a pleasure when I read Norwegian Wood first time and I devoted my time reading his books one after another.\n\nIn Norwegian Wood, he uses Beatles ‘Norwegian Wood‘ of course and their many other songs and other pop, folk and rock musicians.\n\nFor jazz, Henry Mancini ‘Dear Heart’, Bill Evans ‘Waltz for Debbie’, Miles Davis ‘Kind of blue’, Thelonius Monk ‘Honeysuckle Rose’ and many jazz players are mentioned.\n\nFor classic music, the book mentions Debussy ‘Claire de Lune’, Brahms ‘Fourth Symphony’ and ‘Second Piano Concert’, Ravel ‘Pavane for Dead Princess’ and Bach ‘Inventions’ and many mentions about classic music composers.\n\nCleverly using this blend of the music, he describes the mood and the lives of young people in the sixties in Japan effectively and gives the people in the books character.\n\nYou can borrow Norwegian Wood as an audiobook and many of his other via Overdrive/Libby app. And moreover, you can enjoy the music in his books with library’s online services, Naxos Music and Naxos Jazz without any advertisement!\n\nA library user from Edinburgh, David, introduces Trumpet by Jackie Kay.\n\nTrumpet is the stunning debut novel by the writer/poet Jackie Kay. First published in 1998 it is, as you would expect, beautifully written and tells, mostly through a series of flashbacks, the story of the life of a great Scottish jazz trumpeter Joss Moody.\n\nThe novel starts after Moody’s death when it is revealed that Joss had been born Josephine but had chosen to live her life as a man, a fact that was kept a secret from all but his wife. Through the recollections and reactions of his family and friends we follow his story from 1927. The book deals sensitively with the many issues that this situation creates. His loving wife Millie the only person who knew the truth tells much of the tale and her version contrasts with the reaction of his adopted son Colman whose reaction to the news is at times less than sympathetic.\n\nThe novel is in part influenced by the true story of the American jazz musician Billy Tipton who found fame as a pianist and band leader and who had been born Dorothy Lucille Tipton. It is a moving story, sensitively and brilliantly told but it also works on other levels as well as dealing with issues of sexual and racial identity.\n\nBorrow Trumpet by Jackie Kay as an ebook or an audiobook.\n\nIn his review, David mentions the jazz musician Billy Tipton, Suits me: the double life of Billy Tipton by Diane Wood Middlebrook is available to borrow from the Music Library when we reopen.\n\nZoe works in the Libraries’ Central Lending department and is busily collaborating with colleagues from other departments to launch our new online Craft Group. Ursula le Guin is one of the most read science fiction/fantasy novelists, and below Zoe shares with us her regard for her work.\n\nUrsula le Guin, perhaps best known for her Earthsea series, wrote many more science fiction and fantasy books for both children and adults over her long lifetime. She was a peerless world-builder, philosopher and scholar of human nature. One of her books, ‘Always Coming Home’, available on the shelves at Central Library, is about the lives of an imagined tribe of people, 500 years into the future. Le Guin collaborated with analogue composer Todd Barton to invent the music of this world, and a soundtrack to the immersive experience of reading this unconventional book. The resulting album, created with its own music notation, is ‘Music and Poetry of the Kesh’.\n\nLibrary reader Daniel from Leith reviews Utopia Avenue\n\nDavid Mitchell’s Utopia Avenue took me right into the sixties London music scene and then further afield to America. Along the way I met famous musicians of the time and had a few words with them. I went to a great party at the Chelsea Hotel and felt very rock and roll. In fact, my only real disappointment was not to have met Jim Morrison of The Doors.\n\nThe book concentrates on the experiences of three members of Utopia Avenue, and deals with many of the all too human personal stories that are the backdrop to finding fame and fortune. These form the basis of many of the band’s eclectic songs and music, and hence the story the book tells.\n\nI’ve been left trying to decide, if Utopia Avenue actually was a real band from the 60s, who would they have been? I reckon they were somewhere between Jefferson Airplane and Fairport Convention, with a touch of The Yardbirds. The whole book felt very tangible and I wanted to be there among it all.\n\nUtopia Avenue is available to borrow in hard copy\n\nMairi too joined us at Central Library in the first post lockdown period from her home library, Oxgangs. If you are not already aware of the works of Mitch Albom, Mairi introduces us to part of what to expect in The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto.\n\nWhat do you choose to read during a global pandemic? Words I never thought I would utter!\n\nI decided on a fairy tale for adults, and Mitch Albom is the master of them. I had avoided this book as I thought it was about a puppet! I couldn’t have been more wrong, the strings in question were on a classical guitar.\n\nI was transported around the world with the most eclectic musical accompaniment.\n\nStarting with Mozarts Eine Kleine Nachtmusic. It was August 1930 in Villarreal and in an erratic 6/5 tempo we met Francisco Tarrega, travelling on to Hector Villa-Lobos living in the Brazilian Rainforest writing his twelve etudes. The a Taverna playing flamenco.\n\nThe protaginist travels to England by boat to escape Franco, and abandoned on a dock there he meets Django Reinhardt heading to America to tour with Duke Ellington, as he speaks no English the young man accompanies him to Detroit! He finds love to the tune of Avalon, enjoys solace on Waiheke Island, then travels to New York to teach, and via La Catedral by Agustin Barrios we return to Villarreal where the symphony ends.\n\nI would add all living musicians – Marcus Belgrave, Roger McGuinn, Lyle Lovett, Ingrid Michaelson, Paul Stanley, Tony Bennett, Winstom Marsalis and John Pizzarelli were all happy and proud to be included in this book!\n\nWe have created some playlists of some of the music mentioned in the books above.\n\nAll you need is your library card to log on to Naxos and then go to ‘Playlists’ to stream or download this literature-inspired list of tracks."
