        "text": "\"[Russell's] episode is really something quite special The sequence gives Russells imagination full reign and showcases his exceptional lighting, design and compositional skills in an uplifting parable about the triumph of life over death\" (Andrew Pragasam in The Spinning Image, click here)\n\nAria from 1987 is a compilation film. A number of directors were each given 50,000 pounds to make a short film based on an opera. Ken Russell chose an excerpt Nessun Dorma from Turandot.\n\nLinzi Drew, the star, says \"Nessun Dorma... from Turandot translates as ´None Shall Sleep´, and Ken's idea was to portray an accident victim who is comatose... His inspiration came from losing someone close to him in a car crash\".\n\nThe film is one of Russell's best and is highly recommended.\n\nKen's segment was filmed in a studio in Battersea.\n\nOther directors at their peak in the Aria films include Altman and Jean Luc Goddard. Disappointing are Roeg and especially Derek Jarman. According to imdb.com Orson Welles and Frederico Fellini were planned to take part but withdrew for health reasons, and Woody Allen had a scheduling conflict so also pulled out.\n\nI like the comment from Nina in a blog comment \"godard, altman and jarman in one movie doesnt sound like something that should work and tbh it doesnt rlly but the music is pretty and it makes me wanna watch more ken russell so who cares\" (Letterboxd, 2 Mar 2018, click here)\n\nAll images from the DVD of the film."
