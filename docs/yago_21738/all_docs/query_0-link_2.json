        "text": "If you like opera and bare breasts, here’s your movie.\n\nTen segments made by ten different directors, all set to and inspired by different (and sometimes multiple) arias from eight different composers. You got all that? You’ll want a notepad for this one. I’m not going to go through every piece of music and each composer, or even the actors in each story, because it’s too much and you can click here for that. What I am going to do, however, is pass out awards for each director’s segments, in order of appearance:\n\nNicolas Roeg: most bonkers\n\nCharles Sturridge: best understanding of how music movements should go with images\n\nJean-Luc Godard: most interesting to think about after the fact\n\nJulien…\n\nPart 14 of the January Film list\n\n3rd Nicolas Roeg (after Don't Look Now and The Witches), 1st Charles Sturridge, 15th Jean-Luc Godard, 2nd Julian Temple (after The Filth and the Fury), 1st Bruce Beresford, 9th Robert Altman (after The Player, M*A*S*H, Nashville, 3 Women, Short Cuts, Gosford Park, Cookie's Fortune and O.C. and Stiggs), 1st Franc Roddam, 7th Ken Russell (after Altered States, Lair of the White Worm, Pop Goes the Easel, Crimes of Passion, Gothic and The Devils), 6th Derek Jarman (after Caravaggio, The Angelic Conversation, Edward II, War Requiem and The Tempest), 1st Bill Bryden\n\nThe cinematic equivalent of Fans, the Malcolm McLaren album that tries to mix R&B and Opera and does so in a manner…\n\nAn oddity for sure: Aria is an anthology of ten short films by ten different directors, all set to operatic arias. The ten segments are loosely connected via a character played by John Hurt. Otherwise there’s no theme or direction to the segments. Each director takes a distinct approach, creating a visual world or story under the music, with only occasional dialogue added.\n\nMusic videos were in their prime when this came out. This movie seems like the music-video format applied to opera and/or an excuse for a lot of famous directors to play around with their favorite arias.\n\nI’m not sure how opera lovers and/or movie lovers might react to this. It’s really odd. I saw it more or…\n\nA rag-bag of short pieces that just about stand on their own, but barely exist as a coherent whole - despite a weak attempt at a linking theme with John Hurt's Pagliacci character - unless the baring of breasts is the uniting factor, such is the frequency of their exposure.\n\nIn terms of aptitude, Russell hits the nail on the head, Jarman charms, Godard inevitably bewilders and Sturridge flounders in stodge. The rest fit in somewhere in between, but it’s hardly a scintillating selection. I understand the brief was any aria in the RCA record library whereas maybe narrowing focus to a single composer or style might have tightened things given the wildly different directors in tow.\n\nI suppose being…\n\nWhen Kai White's review put this film on my radar a couple of weeks back, the lineup of directors, stars and arias was too good to pass up and my local library came through (again) with a copy. Having watched it, the question of why it was made intrigued me too. It is not really an opera sampler for people who don’t know much about opera and the disjunction, in most of the selections, between the aria libretto and the images on the screen is likely to puzzle those who know the arias/operas.\n\nThe long ‘Making of’ documentary which is an extra on the Umbrella DVD throws some light on the intentions of Producer Don Boyd who spent three years (and a…"
