        "text": "The official website for the Aria franchise began streaming a trailer on Tuesday for the Aria the Benedizione anime film that reveals that the film will open in Japan on December 3.\n\nThe site also revealed the film's theme song artists, new characters, returning staff, and a new visual. Yui Makino is performing both the opening theme song \"Espero\" and the ending theme song \"Undine: 2021 edizione\" (a new recording of the opening theme song for the Aria the Animation series).\n\nThe new characters and cast includes: (character name romanizations are not confirmed)\n\nSumi Shimamoto as Asuka R. Baggio\n\nAkiko Hiramatsu as Airi S. Granzchesta\n\nAria the Benedizione will be the third and final project in the \"Blue Curtain Call\" series that includes Aria the Avvenire and Aria the Crepuscolo.\n\nJunichi Satō, who directed all previous Aria anime, returns as chief director and scriptwriter, while Takahiro Natori, an episode director and storyboarder from previous Aria anime, is the new director at J.C. Staff. Yōko Itō (Amanchu!, Skate-Leading Stars) is the character designer and chief animation director. Choro Club and Takeshi Senoo return from previous Aria anime to provide the music. Shochiku is producing the film, and Shochiku ODS Jigyō-shitsu is distributing.\n\nAria the Crepuscolo opened in Japan on March 5. Ryō Hirohashi and Ai Kayano reprised their roles as Alice Carroll and Anya Dostoyevskaya, respectively in the film. Rina Satō played the character Athena Glor, replacing the late Tomoko Kawakami from previous anime adaptations of Kozue Amano's Aria manga.\n\nRight Stuf's Nozomi Entertainment label released the first anime on DVD, and it describes the original 2005 Aria the Animation television anime:\n\nAkari Mizunashi, at the age of 15, has left everything behind to travel to a sparkling planet covered in water, Aqua, formerly known as Mars. By the 24th century, humans have found a way to colonize the formerly uninhabitable planet.\n\nMore than anything, Akari wants to be an \"undine\" - a female gondolier who navigates the canals of the Aquan city of Neo-Venezia. The city itself is a faithful replication of Manhome's (Earth) city of Venice. To make sure that residents and tourists alike get the most from Neo-Venezia's many wonders, companies offering guided tours via gondola were formed, one of which is named Aria Company.\n\nAs she begins her training with the prestigious Aria Company, will she be up to the challenges that await her on the path to achieve her dream?\n\nHal Film Maker animated the 2005 television series Aria the Animation, and the anime later inspired two more television series — Aria the Natural in 2006 and Aria the Origination in 2008 — as well as original video anime (OVAs) — Aria the OVA ~Arietta~ in 2007 and Aria the Avvenire in 2015. Junichi Satō (Sailor Moon, Princess Tutu) directed all installments in the anime franchise."
