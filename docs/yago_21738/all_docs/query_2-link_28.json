        "text": "13 films + Articles + thoughts from me\n\nThis article, Fatal Attraction: Cinema and Opera from Opera Vision is a great primer on the relationship between cinema and opera.\n\nSTARTING OFF\n\nThe Tales of Hoffmann, dir. Michael Powell + Eric Pressberg (1951)\n\nGood essay by Bruce Eder on the Tales of Hoffmann from the Criterion collection\n\nExcerpt from this essay by Jeff Seroy:\n\n“Why all the fuss? What is Tales of Hoffmann? Simply put, it’s a film version of Jacques Offenbach’s opera with dance added. But it’s also a swerving, hyperornamental, terminally self-aware, grandly ambitious, experimental bag of tricks, at once dazzling and daze-inducing.”\n\nMS fragments\n\nMaximal cinema\n\nhyperornamental\n\nTotal cinema vs composed cinema\n\nattempt to include all visual arts in one single space\n\n2. THE MAGIC FLUTE, dir. Ingmar Bergman (1975)\n\nFrom Peter Cowie,\n\nWhen does an opera become a film? Certainly in Act Two, when the Queen of the Night, her face transformed into a mask of fury by waxen make-up and a livid green filter, harangues Pamina in Der Hölle Rache. And certainly in the climactic sequence when Monostatos and his minions advance threateningly towards the camera. In spite of such frissons, and for all the inevitable skulls that mock the hapless Papageno in the House of Trials, this is a witty, rumbustious Flute, played and sung at fast tempo throughout.\n\nMS fragments\n\nA cinematic adaptation of a theatrical experience\n\nconstantly asking the question of when does an opera become a film? When does it lift off?\n\nbeauty of the color, shot by the extraordinary Sven Nykvist.\n\nsound design extends the musical experience by layering the grand soundscape of the singers and orchestra with the human sounds of the actors: footsteps, chewing, whispers.\n\nWith the magic flute, Bergman invents a genre that we now take for granted.\n\nALSO watch everything by Bergman.\n\n3 . Elektra, dir.Gotz Friedrich (1982)\n\nMS fragments\n\nINSANE! THE CLOSE UPS! MAD MAX but ELEKTRA!\n\nPairs with: Mother! by Darren Aronovksy\n\nAlso: Fassbinder, The Bitter Tears of Petra van Kant. Different realities, parallel emotional worlds.\n\n4. Boris Godunov, dir. Andrzej Zulawski\n\nSmart ideas from David Cairnes. (Do read that essay if you watch this film. And do watch this film.)\n\nA particularly evocative bit:\n\nShamelessly theatrical in its design, the film begins with an audience attending a performance in a nineteenth-century opera house, before exploding the fourth wall and the viewer's mind, bursting out onto giant sets and exteriors which could never be contained within a proscenium. Yet the stylisation of the stage is never abandoned, with real landscapes transformed by carefully placed fake buildings, and trees and rocks painted, in the manner of Antonioni, to impart the richness of a Van Gogh. All this is shot by Żuławski's ceaselessly, aggressively roving camera: you have to imagine the Scorsese of Goodfellas doing one too many lines of coke and going all Mad Max, determined to drive his dolly crashing through the cinema screen and into the audience's laps.\n\nMS Fragments:\n\nTHIS IS A MUST WATCH. It is Weird and Wild with capital W’s. It is a director really engaging with the tension between these two languages.\n\nEverything is thrown at the wall.\n\nPossible pairing: The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (Buñuel), or Opening Night (Cassavettes). Neither are as wizzbang, but both are excellent explorations of the human performance within and beyond the boundaries of theater.\n\nIs Ruggero Raimondi opera’s greatest movie star? (No offense to the legacy of Anna Moffo, of course)\n\nMichael Powell on drugs.\n\nFluidity between theatrical and cinematic worlds. Both, constantly, ALL THE TIME!\n\n5. Carmen, dir. Francesco Rosi\n\nFrom a 1984 NYTimes review:\n\nWith the exception of several sequences, Mr. Rosi doesn't attempt to embellish the original opera by opening it up in obvious ways to take advantage of the camera's mobility. Yet, when he does do just that, he does it with purposeful effect.\n\nThe film's opening sequence is a brutal, sorrowful intimation of things to come - close-ups, in slow-motion, of a great bull in the last moments of his unequal fight with the torero. As the bull, blood pulsating from the wounds in his body and then gushing from his mouth, struggles in ever smaller circles to renew his attack, we hear the cheers of the crowd, which become a kind of prelude to the familiar overture that, here, suddenly sounds less commonplace than ironic.\n\nMS Fragments:\n\nRather than stage lame productions that attempt to evoke this film’s mise-en-scène, we should just play the film. It’ll scratch the same itch for less money and general suffering.\n\nI think of this in the same way I think of the recentish film adaption of Rent. It’s more or less the thing, albeit it with some camera stuff and cinematic flow.\n\nRaimondi. What a guy.\n\n6. Cavalleria Rusticana, dir. Franco Zeffirelli (1981)\n\nIMO, not as good as his La Traviata, but still useful to understanding how he is thinking about theater vs cinema.\n\nMS Fragments:\n\nZeffirelli…what can you say. Not my thing. But so impressive. He is actively trying to close the distance between theater and cinema.\n\nTHE NEXT THREE\n\n7. Parsifal, dir. Hans-Jürgen Syberberg (1982)\n\nThis is the kind of film that people write long analytical books about. Both because the subject matter attracts such obsessive and dedicated scholarship, and because Syberberg is an artist trying to think deeply about the German construction of identity + mythology + symbolism.\n\nInteresting context from Derrick Everett.\n\nSusan Sonntag on Syberberg.\n\n8. Wozzeck, dir. Joachim Hess (1972)\n\nSome context from operaramblings.\n\nFrom the linked blog post:\n\n“In any event there is some really good cinematography. Very effective use is made of atmospheric long shots, especially during the orchestral interludes, but mostly the singers are filmed in close up with the camera typically lingering for a long time on the same shot. It really reinforces the creepiness and is far more effective than cutting to a new angle every two seconds.\n\nMS Fragments:\n\nEffectively deals with feelings of claustrophobia and containment.\n\nRestraint in editing.\n\nMusical cinematography\n\n9. Don Giovanni, dir. Joseph Losey (1979)\n\nA review from Judith Martin at the time of release. I found this to be rather prescient re: our current moment.\n\n“Loving opera does not necessarily lead to loving filmed opera, in the movies or on television, no matter how excellent the credentials of those making the film. By its nature, filmed opera uses mechanically reproduced sound and it subjects broad theatrical conventions to the literal scrutiny of the camera.\n\nSo your true opera fan will usually concede, at most, that an opera movie is only better than no opera, and perhaps a useful way of introducing the form to people who will then go and support the real thing.”\n\nA v. serious critical unpacking (not my style, but notable for its intensity) by Colin Gardner\n\nMS fragments:\n\nThis is useful to watch because Losey really points to an interpretation.\n\n10. The Death of Klinghoffer, dir. Penny Woolcock (2003)\n\nFrom Penny Woolcock’s essay on the film:\n\nWe had more luck before we started. The budget for the Death of Klinghoffer was 2.5 million pounds, huge for television at that time and unheard of for an arts film. Jan was surprised when it was quickly nodded through the budget round. She popped in to see Tim Gardam, at that time Director of Programmes. “You approved The Death of Klinghoffer?” “Yeah”, he replied. “It’s great.” Jan was relieved. Months later when we were in the middle of the shoot Tim came into her office and saw a panoramic picture of our cruise liner. “What the hell is that?” “It’s our boat!” beamed Jan. “Isn’t it great?” Tim hit the roof. It turned out that he had misread the figures and thought he was approving a budget of £250,000 not £2.5 million.\n\nThat is a lot of money but given what we were trying to do it was peanuts. We restaged the war over the foundation of the state of Israel, recorded the LSO at Abbey Road Studios, sailed around the Med with a large cast and a bunch of opera singers any one of whom could have got a sore throat and so on and on. We could only squeak through if every single thing went right, every single day. We had to get what they call a bond for the film – it’s a kind of insurance. Without it the filming would not go ahead.\n\nALSO! Her essay on filmmaking is worthwhile.\n\nMS Fragments\n\nBlend of contemporary music and docudrama suggests an interesting kind of hybrid form.\n\nI’ve never found this to be the most successful score and this film doesn’t convince me otherwise.\n\nMade-for-TV is safer for opera bc of distribution. Multiple entities don’t have to agree that opera is a worthwhile thing to put on film, economically speaking..\n\n11. La Boheme, dir. Robert Dornhelm (2008)\n\nOpening of Anna Picard’s review of the film for Independent.\n\nCan grand opera ever work at the movies? As shorthand for passion, obsession or sophistication, it has played a useful supporting role in everything from art house to horror.\n\nSung by Elmer Fudd and Bugs Bunny, lampooned by the Marx Brothers and Danny Kaye, it has proved a great subject for comedy. Yet with the exception of Ingmar Bergman's jewel-box film of The Magic Flute, and the offbeat extrapolations of Derek Jarman, Nicolas Roeg, Robert Altman, Ken Russell, Bruce Beresford and Jean-Luc Godard in Don Boyd's Aria, opera has almost always looked false on film.\n\nIt's curious that two art forms so adept at enchantment have failed to form a stronger relationship. One hundred and 16 years ago, Thomas Edison predicted that synchronised sound and vision would bring opera to a man's parlour. And Edison was partly right. We now have some astonishing records of staged productions on DVD. But imagine an Almodovar L'Heure espagnole, a Brothers Quay Fairy Queen, a Terence Davies Eugene Onegin, a Scorsese Fanciulla del West. Though Woody Allen, Abbas Kiarostami and Sofia Coppola are directing operas, they're not directing them for the cinema. Whether flirting with real time and real locations (Giuseppe Patroni Griffi's 1992 Tosca), juxtaposing footage of the recording sessions with live action (Benoît Jacquot's 2001 Tosca) or sprinkling Mozart with CGI (Kenneth Branagh's 2006 The Magic Flute), opera on film has progressed remarkably little since Joseph Losey's Don Giovanni (1979).\n\nMS fragments\n\nStar vehicle. Not much more.\n\nMade me miss Rolando Villazón in his glory days.\n\nNetrebko gets more ferocious by the day.\n\n12. The Magic Flute, dir. Kenneth Branagh (2006)\n\nFrom Peter Conrad’s review of the film\n\nThe script's comment is terse: 'Confirmation of an indifferent universe.' Modernising The Magic Flute, Branagh forces it to confront an existential absurdity that Mozart knew nothing about. Sarastro's field hospital is said to be 'like a lunatic asylum designed by Dali and Kafka'. On one of its beds I noticed an extra, cast as a wounded soldier, lying down to rest. He was legless, and had parked his detachable pins by the bedside. I wondered how he'd managed the trick. Then when he got up and reassembled himself for the next take, I saw that he was an actual double amputee. Some losses cannot be repaired, by magic or by music. Even so, Branagh's final image - to be filled in by computer graphics - will hark back to the rational 18th century, when music symbolised harmony and promised to restore paradise. As the last chords die away, the flute twirls weightlessly in mid-air, turned to radiant gold by the sun. It may be too late for Mozart to save our hell-bent world. Even so, it's pleasing to think that, thanks to Voyager, The Magic Flute may one day entertain the angels, or convert extra-terrestrials to opera.\n\nMS fragments\n\nHey! I’m here for it!\n\nWay, way, way too many ideas here, but many of them work for me.\n\nI appreciate the attempt at engagement and invention, even if it doesn’t cohere. In the spirit of the piece itself.\n\n13. Madame Butterfly, dir. Frédéric Mitterrand (1995)\n\nFrom the Roger Ebert review.\n\nThis beautiful new film version of “Madame Butterfly” is not a revisionist approach; it films Puccini's opera more or less as it was intended to be seen, and of course that is what we want (I am not looking forward to the Baz Luhrmann version, with Pinkerton as the leader of a motorcycle gang, and Butterfly as the daughter of a Korean grocer in the Bronx). The approach is traditional, the pace is attentive, and yet the emotion is still all there, and when Pinkerton's carriage comes rolling up with his new family inside, my blood boils"
