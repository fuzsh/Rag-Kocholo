(February 2019)\n\nTemplate:Infobox film awards\n\nThe 91st Academy Awards ceremony, presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), honored the best films of 2018, and took place at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. The ceremony was held on February 24, 2019. During the ceremony, AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 24 categories. The ceremony was televised in the United States by the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), produced by Donna Gigliotti and Glenn Weiss, with Weiss also serving as director.[1] It was the first ceremony in three decades, since the 61st Academy Awards in 1989, to be conducted with no host.\n\nIn related events, the Academy held its 10th Annual Governors Awards ceremony at the Grand Ballroom of the Hollywood and Highland Center on November 18, 2018.[2] The Academy Scientific and Technical Awards were presented by host actor David Oyelowo on February 9, 2019, in a ceremony at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills.[3]\n\nGreen Book won three awards, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor for Mahershala Ali's portrayal of Don Shirley, and Bohemian Rhapsody led the ceremony with four awards, including Best Actor for Rami Malek's portrayal of Freddie Mercury. Roma and Black Panther also received three awards apiece, with the former winning Best Director for Alfonso Cuarón and becoming the first Mexican submission to win Best Foreign Language Film. Olivia Colman was awarded Best Actress for portraying Anne, Queen of Great Britain in The Favourite.[4] With a U.S. viewership of 29.6 million, it marked a 12% increase over the 2018 ceremony.[5][6][7]\n\nWinners and nominees[]\n\nThe nominees for the 91st Academy Awards were announced on January 22, 2019, at 5:20 a.m. PST (13:20 UTC), at the Academy's Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, by actors Kumail Nanjiani and Tracee Ellis Ross.[8][9]\n\nAwards[]\n\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger ( ).[10]\n\nGreen Book – Jim Burke, Charles B.

The proposal was met with wide criticism, as the award's implied focus on blockbuster films was considered to be demeaning towards artistic films and other non-mainstream pictures (with the award's title suggesting that such films were not \"popular\"), that it could diminish the chance for critically successful mainstream films to also be nominated for Best Picture (such as, in particular, Black Panther, although the Academy stated that a single film could be nominated in both categories),[26] and for being a ploy to boost ratings.[27][28][29][30] The Academy announced the following month that it would postpone the new category in order to seek additional input.[31] Academy president John Bailey admitted that the proposed category was intended to help improve viewership, and noted that the concept of a separate award for commercial film dates back to the 1st Academy Awards (which had separate categories for \"Outstanding Picture\" and \"Best Unique and Artistic Picture\").[32]\n\nIn January 2019, it was reported that as part of an effort to shorten the ceremony, only two of the nominees for Best Original Song (\"All the Stars\" and \"Shallow\") would be performed live.[33] After a negative reaction from audiences and industry musicians, including Lin-Manuel Miranda and members of the music branch,[34] the Academy backtracked and announced that all five songs would be performed (although Variety later reported that \"All the Stars\" would not be performed due to \"logistics and timing\" issues with the song's performers).[35][36]\n\nThe following month, the Academy announced that the presentation of the awards for Best Cinematography, Best Live Action Short Film, Best Film Editing, and Best Makeup and Hairstyling—would occur during commercial breaks. They said that these presentations would be streamed so viewers could watch them live online, and that the winners' acceptance speeches would be replayed later in the broadcast. The decision received extensive backlash from audiences, and from filmmakers including Guillermo del Toro, Christopher Nolan, Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Damien Chazelle, Spike Lee, Joe Dante and Alfonso Cuarón (the latter of whom was nominated and won in one of the aforementioned categories).[37][38] Four days later, the Academy reversed the decision and announced that all 24 categories would be presented live.[39]\n\nABC scheduled a \"sneak peak\" of its new dramedy Whiskey Cavalier after the ceremony and late local news, ahead of its premiere the following Wednesday.[40]\n\nBox office performance of Best Picture nominees[]\n\nNorth American Box Office Gross for Best Picture Nominees[41] Film Pre-nomination\n\n(before January 22) Post-nomination\n\n(January 22 – February 24) Post-awards\n\n(after February 24) Total Black Panther $700.1 million N/A N/A $700.1 million Bohemian Rhapsody $202.5 million $10.6 million $3.1 million $216.2 million A Star Is Born $204.8 million $6 million $4.4 million $215.2 million Green Book $42.5 million $27.2 million $15.2 million $84.8 million BlacKkKlansman $48.5 million $806,590 N/A $49.3 million Vice $39.5 million $7.6 million $719,876 $47.8 million The Favourite $23 million $9.1 million $2.1 million $34.4 million Roma[lower-alpha 1] N/A N/A N/A N/A Total: $1.278 billion $60.8 million $25.6 million $1.348 billion Average: $157.6 million $8.7 million $3.7 million $192.6 million\n\nAt the time of the nominations announcement on January 22, 2019, the combined North American box office gross of seven of the eight[lower-alpha 1] Best Picture nominees was $1.261 billion, the highest total for Best Picture nominees since the 83rd Academy Awards in 2011.[42][43] The average per-film gross was $157 million, although only three films (Black Panther, A Star Is Born and Bohemian Rhapsody) had actually made over $50 million before the announcement.\n\nThirty-two nominations went to twelve of the year's fifty top-grossing movies. Of those, only seven films—Black Panther (1st), Incredibles 2 (3rd), Bohemian Rhapsody (12th), A Star Is Born (13th), Ralph Breaks the Internet (14th), Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (18th) and Green Book (46th)—were nominated for Best Picture, Best Animated Feature or any of the directing, acting or screenwriting awards. The other top 50 box-office hits that earned nominations were Avengers: Infinity War (2nd), Solo: A Star Wars Story (10th), A Quiet Place (15th), Mary Poppins Returns (19th), Ready Player One (24th), and Christopher Robin (34th).\n\nHost selection[]\n\nThe 90th Academy Awards in 2018 had the lowest Nielsen ratings of all time, with less than half of the 57.25 million viewers of the 70th in 1998. In October 2018, the Academy asked Dwayne Johnson to host the 91st ceremony, believing that the popularity of Hollywood's highest-paid actor would help increase the audience. Johnson immediately began planning what he described as an \"audience first\" show, but could not change his schedule of filming Hobbs & Shaw and a Jumanji sequel.[44]\n\nAfter considering using one host for each of the three hours,Template:R on December 4, 2018, the Academy announced that Kevin Hart would host the ceremony.[45] Hart expressed that it was truly an honor and a thrill to be asked to host the Academy Awards.[46] A controversy emerged when past jokes and comments made by Hart were found to contain anti-gay slurs and language; Hart withdrew from hosting duties on December 6, saying he did not want to be a \"distraction\" to the ceremony.[47][48] Previous Oscar hosts such as Seth MacFarlane, Ellen DeGeneres, Neil Patrick Harris, Chris Rock, and Jimmy Kimmel expressed no interest in hosting the show.[49]\n\nOn January 9, 2019, it was reported that the Academy planned to hold the ceremony without a host, and instead have selected presenters introduce segments and awards. No replacement host was announced, and it became the first ceremony without a designated host since the 61st Academy Awards in 1989.[50]\n\nRatings and reception[]\n\nMedia publications responded more positively to the show than those in recent years, with many praising the no-host approach.[51] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the show holds an approval rating of 70% based on 40 critics, and summarized, \"Strong musical performances, a steady, somewhat sluggish pace, and a few genuinely surprising moments helped the hostless 91st Oscars create an entertainingly efficient -- if not entirely satisfying -- ceremony.\"[52]\n\nThe American telecast drew 29.6 million U.S. viewers, a 12% increase in viewership over the 2018 ceremony (which were the lowest-rated Academy Awards to date). The show also drew a 7.7 rating for the 18–49 demographic.[53][54]\n\nIn Memoriam[]\n\nThe annual In Memoriam segment was introduced by the President of the Academy John Bailey with Gustavo Dudamel conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic on the notes of the \"Leaving Home\" theme from Superman by John Williams.[55]\n\nThe segment paid tribute to the following 50 artists:\n\nSee also[]\n\n46th Annie Awards\n\n72nd British Academy Film Awards\n\n44th César Awards\n\n24th Critics' Choice Awards\n\n46th Daytime Emmy Awards\n\n31st European Film Awards\n\n76th Golden Globe Awards\n\n39th Golden Raspberry Awards\n\n22nd Hollywood Film Awards\n\n34th Independent Spirit Awards\n\n71st Primetime Emmy Awards\n\n23rd Satellite Awards\n\n45th Saturn Awards\n\n25th Screen Actors Guild Awards\n\n73rd Tony Awards\n\nList of submissions to the 91st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\n\nNotes[]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nOfficial websites\n\nAcademy Awards official website\n\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences official website\n\n91st Annual Academy Awards of Merit for Achievements During 2018 – 91st Oscars Rules\n\nOscar's Channel at YouTube (run by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences)\n\nNews resources\n\nOscars 2018 at BBC News\n\nOscars 2019 at The Guardian\n\nAcademy Awards *Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS)\n\nRecords\n\nmost wins per ceremony\n\nOscar season\n\nOscar speech\n\nOscar bait\n\nGovernors Awards\n\nNicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting\n\nPre-show\n\nAwards of Merit\n\nPicture\n\nDirector\n\nActor\n\nActress\n\nSupporting Actor\n\nSupporting Actress\n\nAdapted Screenplay\n\nOriginal Screenplay\n\nAnimated Feature\n\nDocumentary Feature Film\n\nInternational Feature Film\n\nAnimated Short Film\n\nDocumentary Short Film\n\nLive Action Short Film\n\nCinematography\n\nCostume Design\n\nFilm Editing\n\nMakeup and Hairstyling\n\nOriginal Score\n\nOriginal Song\n\nProduction Design\n\nSound\n\nVisual Effects\n\nProposed awards\n\nPopular Film\n\nSpecial awards Governors Awards\n\nAcademy Honorary Award\n\nIrving G.
