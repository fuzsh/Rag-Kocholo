        "text": "Troye Sivan emerged the biggest winner at this year’s ARIA Awards, which took place today (November 15) at Sydney’s Hordern Pavilion. Check out the full list of winners below.\n\nSivan took home four awards of six nominations for ‘Rush’, the lead single off his latest album ‘Something To Give Each Other’: Song of the Year Presented by YouTube, Best Solo Artist, Best Engineered Release and Best Produced Release presented by Neumann. The latter two gongs were shared with ‘Rush’ producer Styalz Fuego.\n\nLeading the nominees was Genesis Owusu, who was up for seven awards this year for his sophomore album ‘Struggler’. The Canberran genre-bender and NME Cover artist was the second-most awarded artist tonight with three trophies: Album of the Year, Best Hip Hop/Rap Release, and Best Independent Release presented by PPCA.\n\nAnother notable win came from Kylie Minogue, who won Best Pop Release for ‘Padam Padam’ – her first ARIA Award in 21 years. G Flip and Forest Claudette won two ARIA Awards each, the former for Best Australian Live Act and Best Video with Kyle Caulfield for ‘Good Enough’. Forest Claudette won their first-ever ARIA Award for Best Soul and R&B Release, which was televised for the first time this year (following criticism of the category by artists and industry figures in 2022), and the award for Best Cover Art.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaylor Swift beat out the likes of Beyoncé, Drake and Ed Sheeran for the publicly voted award of Most Popular International Artist. It comes ahead of her sold-out Australia leg of the Eras Tour next year.\n\nThe Hordern stage saw performances by G Flip, Peach PRC, Budjerah and Jessica Mauboy. The ARIAs marked 50 years of hip-hop with a performance featuring Bliss n Eso, Barkaa, 1200 Techniques, DJ Krissy, and Sound Unlimited Posse featuring Kye. Fanny Lumsden and Brad Cox’s performances took place in tribute to the late Aussie country legend Joy McKean, while Jet performed a hits medley to celebrate their induction into the ARIA Hall of Fame.\n\nNotable presenters this year included Sivan, who presented G Flip with Best Video, and Dolly Parton, who appeared via video to announce Fanny Lumsden’s win for Best Country Album. “It’s great to see country music doing so well down under,” Parton remarked.\n\nHere are the 2023 ARIA Awards winners:\n\nRecommended\n\nAlbum of the Year\n\nDMA’S – ‘How Many Dreams?’\n\nG Flip – ‘Drummer’\n\nGenesis Owusu – ‘Struggler’ – WINNER\n\nMatt Corby – ‘Everything’s Fine’\n\nThe Teskey Brothers – ‘The Winding Way’\n\nBest Solo Artist\n\nBudjerah – ‘2step’ – Ed Sheeran (Feat.
