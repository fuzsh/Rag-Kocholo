        "text": "Children should be scared. Not, like, in an existential way, but once in a while it’s a good thing—a fun thing, a perhaps even character building thing—to be a little frightened, at least when entering a land of make-believe where there are no real-world stakes. I spent much of my movie-watching life as a kid creeped out but fascinated. I couldn’t yet identify that Bette Davis was an iconic kween, but I was certainly rattled by her lurking presence in The Watcher in the Woods. I loved, and kind of hated, the icky, puppet-y gunk of Labyrinth. And then there was The Witches, a 1990 oddity directed by Nicolas Roeg of all people, which didn’t quite capture the true spirit of the beloved Roald Dahl book, but certainly took care to actually be scary.\n\nThat movie comes up a lot when my fellow Old Millennial friends and I talk about how kids’ movies just aren’t the same anymore. It’s a tired conversation at this point, one that involves the same confirmation bias at work in, say, the assumption that there are no toy commercials on TV anymore. (In fact you’re just not seeing them because you no longer watch programming that would have toy ads served against it.) But even considering that narrow perspective, I do think children’s movies have slickened and brightened over the years. They’re mostly animated these days, and mostly made by studios with the intent to delight and inspire—not cow children into a sort of worldly nervousness. They just wouldn’t make The Witches in 2020, my friends and I say, shaking our heads.\n\nExcept, well, they have. And the new Witches comes from a beloved auteur of the 1980s (and 1990s, and 2000s, to some extent): Robert Zemeckis. The tech-obsessed fabulist has beat a wayward course through his latter day career all the way to an adaptation of Dahl’s book, at a time when Dahl’s legacy is up for serious debate (due to his staunch anti-Semitism, among other things) and when children’s cinema seems less tolerant of a nasty, sad little story of a boy who is turned into a mouse by a witch and stays that way. It’s kind of thrilling that Warner Bros—which has decided to release the film on its HBO Max streaming service (on October 22) rather than wait for movie theaters to return to peak business—bothered to make the movie at all, let alone that they allowed some of the darkness to remain.\n\nRoeg infamously softened the ending of Dahl’s story for his otherwise uncompromising version of The Witches, a surprising choice from the guy who made Walkabout and Don’t Look Now. Zemeckis—who wrote the new adaptation with Guillermo del Toro and Kenya Barris—finds his own ways to nicen things up, but there is still some discomfort and terror in his alternately wretched and gleaming film. Though I was mostly bored watching the new Witches, there is a sharp, glinting edge to be found and enjoyed here and there—pops of grim life that suggest a broader, more charitable respect for kids’ tolerance and sophistication than has most PG fare.\n\nPerhaps the most significant alteration to the original text is that the fearsome witches who stalk our young hero (Jahzir Bruno) and his grandmother (Octavia Spencer) are known to operate in a targeted way. They prey particularly on poor children and children of color, assuming those kids are less likely to be missed or seriously searched for when they are turned into rodents or chickens or otherwise vanished from human life. Given that the boy and his grandmother are Black, and spend most of the film in 1960s Alabama, and that most of the witches they square off against are white, Zemeckis’s film is adding an entirely new layer of tension to the much smaller scale of the book—one intriguingly reactive to the mores and awarenesses of today. Yet this potentially vast dimension is introduced only to be quickly forgotten. Zemeckis’s Witches has trouble balancing its modernity with its loyalty to Dahl’s original. I respect the struggle to honor both facets, but Zemeckis never finds the right pitch.\n\nThe opening stretches of the film—meaning, everything before the boy and his grandmother head to a hotel where, unbeknownst to them, a big witches’ convention is being held—have a grim sense of undertow that ably simulates the troubled coziness of Dahl’s book. Chris Rock narrates the story: the death of the boy’s parents in a car wreck, his grieving, his deepening bond with his firm but kindly grandmother. Spencer and Bruno forge an endearing connection, a warming rapport that seems genuinely violated when the witches come threatening—we want to watch them defend it.\n\nOnce the hotel stuff kicks in, though, Zemeckis’s machine starts to move erratically. The pace quickens to a sprint, the digital effects balloon and metastasize, and the film loses much of its pleasing texture. Anne Hathway shows up as the wicked Grand High Witch, lilting and hooting and slurring in a Trondheim by way of Novgorod by way of Zagreb by way of Neptune accent. She takes up a lot of energy when she’s around, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Anjelica Huston enjoys her own dominance in the 1990 version, though Huston is still—somehow!—less theatrical than Hathaway is here.\n\nThis witch is a lot. And while some of that hamminess plays gamely, too much of Hathaway’s performance must be navigated around Zemeckis’s computer business: a snaky dress that seems alive, a gaping monster’s jaw hidden sometimes with makeup, a constant hovering three feet off the ground. Hathaway tears the scenery down because, it feels like, she wasn’t sure on the day how much work the CGI would be doing when added in post. So we get a lot of acting and a lot of special effects at once, converging storms that blight out any rich minor detail, any mote of creepy credibility, that has managed to sneak its way in and survive up to that point.\n\nThere are some charming bits to be enjoyed, though, from the sight of cute little mice scurrying around a hotel on an important mission to the many subtle ways the film reminds us that one particular kid is fat. Well, no—that second thing is a joke motif unnecessarily held over from a nearly 40-year-old book written by a notoriously mean person. There are other ways to keep The Witches bold and prickly that don’t involve relentlessly teasing one child for his weight. There’s that weird balance problem again, Zemeckis not doing the right math about what to maintain from the book and what to excise or update.\n\nSuch nuances (or lack thereof) might not matter much to the film’s intended audience. Most vitally, the film has frightening, wiggly moments that ought to send young viewers happily scooting forward on the couch, or just as happily hiding under a throw pillow. The film, at its best, is gross and silly and amiably unsettling, which may be all that counts. I wish Zemeckis had, like Roeg, given The Witches more terror of the banal. Roeg’s hotel is so eerily plain compared to this fabulous one, his witches so dour and lady-next-door compared to Zemeckis’s glam fashionistas. I wish there were more practical effects and fewer computer ones that too easily flout the laws of physics. But we older people spend a lot of time wishing things were different, don’t we? It’s probably better, then, to focus on some other, more adult concerns and leave this Witches—in all its mess and magic—to the mice it was made for.\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n— November Cover Star Gal Gadot Is in a League of Her Own\n\n— A First Look at Diana and Margaret Thatcher in The Crown Season Four\n\n— Celebs Roast Trump in Rhyme for John Lithgow’s Trumpty Dumpty Book\n\n— Brace Yourself for George Clooney’s Apocalyptic Movie The Midnight Sky\n\n— The Best Shows and Movies Streaming This October\n\n— Inside Netflix’s Latest Binge-able Escape, Emily in Paris\n\n— The Crown’s Young Stars on Prince Charles and Princess Di\n\n— From the Archive: How Hollywood Sharks, Mafia Kingpins, and Cinematic Geniuses Shaped The Godfather\n\n— Not a subscriber?
