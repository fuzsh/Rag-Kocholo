        "text": "This months cover story goes to an upcoming actress who is about to break the streaming system with her new debut movie, 'Better Nate Than Ever' and starring in the new series 'High School Musical: The Musical The Series', it is the talented, Aria Brooks.\n\nWe talk to Aria about her upcoming projects, working with big names such as Lisa Kudrow and Joshua Bassett and all music.\n\nHello Aria! Thank you so much for talking to us! We’ve got so much to talk about but first, let’s talk about your new Disney+ movie, “Better Nate Than Ever”. You’re playing the role of Libby! How excited are you for everyone to see this movie?\n\nI am beyond excited for everyone to see this movie! I think the cast and crew put so much hard work, passion, and love into this film that will translate on screen.\n\nHow did you prepare yourself for this role?\n\nI started by reading the book when I got the audition. During rehearsals, Rueby Wood (Nate) and I sat down and wrote out the details of our characters. Tim Federle is such a fantastic writer, and he already created the perfect blueprint for Libby, so I just expounded on that.\n\nHow did it feel working alongside Lisa Kudrow, Joshua Bassett, Rueby Wood, and Michelle Federer?\n\nIt’s still so surreal to me. Working alongside talented, iconic, and down-to-earth people was indeed a blessing. It was a great work environment, and I made some lifelong friends.\n\nNow you’re sticking around with Disney as you’re joining the third season of 'High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.' I’ve watched the first two seasons and they’re fabulous! Is there anything you can tell us so far about the show and your character?\n\nI cannot say much yet, but I play Alex, an eighth-grade camper at Camp Shallow Lake. I can’t wait for you to meet her!\n\nYou’ve also released music at the beginning of the year! Congratulations! What inspired you to write music about mental health, the challenges of your journey becoming a performer, and how you overcame them?\n\nMusic has always helped me whether I create it or listen to it. Music is my therapy, and I wanted to share that outlet with the world. I hope my music will touch people and become a safe space for them.\n\nWhat has been your favourite song you’ve ever written?\n\nMy favorite song I’ve written is still unreleased! However, my favorite released song is “CHECKMATE”. It is so catchy and such a lyrical song.\n\nIf you could pick any dream role to play? Who would it be and why?\n\nI would love to be the lead in a fantasy or action movie. I love magical films and superhero/espionage movies. I’d have so much fun in a role like that.\n\nNow that we’re coming to the end of our interview. Have you got any plans for the future?\n\nI am going to continue acting and starring in movies and TV shows. I will definitely be releasing more music. Also, I would like to get some of my screenplays on their feet.\n\nThanks for chatting to us Aria!\n\nAria's new movie 'Better Nate Than Ever' is streaming now on Disney+"
