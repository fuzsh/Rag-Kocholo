For tax rate information, you may wish to consult an independent tax advisor. Please note, except in the event you are a resident of Mainland China, you may elect to make payment of the purchase price for this lot in the cryptocurrency Ether. Payment in Ether must be made via a digital wallet transfer of Ether to Christie’s. If you do not already have one, please obtain a hosted digital wallet at Coinbase Custody Trust; Coinbase, Inc.; Fidelity Digital Assets Services, LLC; Gemini Trust Company, LLC; or Paxos Trust Company, LLC. The digital wallet must be registered to you, or, if you registered to bid as a company, then in the name of the company. Please note that setting up a digital wallet can take a week or more, depending on the service provider’s account opening requirements. Only Ether payments sent from digital wallets maintained at the above listed platforms will be accepted. We will not recognize payments from digital wallets hosted at other exchanges or self-hosted wallets. Partial payments of a lot from multiple digital wallets are not allowed. You agree, upon our request, to provide documentation confirming that the Ether payment was made from a digital wallet registered in your name and maintained at one of the platforms listed above. Partial payments of a lot from multiple digital wallets will not be allowed. The cryptocurrency amount will be calculated by us based on the most recent published CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate (BRR and ETHUSD_RR) index rate as published at 11 am EST on the date that the sale closes and will remain valid for the forty-eight (48) hour period in which the buyer must make payment in accordance with the buyer’s agreement. The relevant exchange rate will be disclosed in the invoice. For further information and to view our Buyers Premium rates, please view the Conditions of Sale via the link below."
