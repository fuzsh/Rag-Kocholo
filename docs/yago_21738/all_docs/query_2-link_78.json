        "text": "At tonight's awards ceremony marking the end of the 40th Cannes Film Festival, the audience at the Festival Palace loudly jeered the announcement that Maurice Pialat's ''Under Satan's Sun'' had won the Golden Palm, the festival's top prize.\n\nNot in some time has the festival's premier award caused such vocal outrage. The French film, adapted from a novel by Georges Bernanos, is a serious, thoroughly unexceptional tale about a simple country priest, played by Gerard Depardieu, who wrestles with his doubts and, on one occasion, the devil himself.\n\nWhen his acceptance remarks were interrupted by boos, Mr. Pialat shook his fist at the audience and walked offstage.\n\nNot all of the prizes were so unpopular. The audience gave the evening's biggest hand to Marcello Mastroianni, who won as best actor for ''Dark Eyes,'' the Chekhovian Italian film by a Soviet director, Nikita Mikhalkov. Equally popular was the award to Barbara Hershey for her performance as a hard-bitten Louisiana bayou woman in ''Shy People,'' directed by Andrei Konchalovsky, Mr. Mikhalkov's brother, who is based in Los Angeles.\n\nNamed best director was Wim Wenders, who made the German ''Wings of Desire,'' an uncharacteristically sentimental Wenders work about a guardian angel who falls in love and elects to stay on earth. 'Cruel and Arbitrary'\n\nThat compromise was to be the theme of this year's awards was hinted at two days ago when Yves Montand, the president of the festival jury, said privately that the entire prize-giving business was ''a cruel and arbitrary process.'' Mr. Montand said of the jury deliberations: ''You talk and vote, talk and vote, and at the end, the winner is something you didn't know that anybody liked.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
