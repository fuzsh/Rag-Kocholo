        "text": "Giuseppe Verdi never cried out ''I want my MTV,'' but he's gotten it anyhow. So have Wagner, Puccini and the other composers whose work has been given the rock-video treatment by 10 opera-loving film directors in ''Aria,'' the composite film that opened yesterday at the Regency. The best of ''Aria'' isn't any more than cheerful kitsch, and a lot of it is junk. But the underlying idea, that of unleashing these film makers and encouraging them to set their flakiest daydreams to beautiful music, is at least as amusing as it is profane.\n\nThe best of the 10 segments is, perhaps predictably, the rare one without lofty pretensions. It's the skit involving an adulterous husband and wife who have both unwittingly scheduled their trysts for the same hideaway, California's blindingly garish Madonna Inn. Directed by Julien Temple, whose vast experience directing bona fide rock videos has given him better-than-average preparation for this job, it makes witty use of ''Rigoletto,'' some of which even comes out of the mouth of an Elvis impersonator. Buck Henry, Anita Morris and Beverly D'Angelo romp mischievously through their brief roles.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum is Bruce Beresford's film of a duet from ''Die Tote Stadt'' by Korngold in which a man imagines that his dead wife has returned to him. Mr. Beresford - who, along with the rest of the film makers, has evidently been encouraged to work high-toned nudity into the proceedings whenever possible - stages this with the two naked singers perched prettily on a bed. The lip-synching is terrible. And the delayed gratification, always a factor when opera singers stop the action to voice their emotions, is in this case almost a joke.\n\nNo less peculiar is Jean-Luc Godard's film set to Jean Baptiste Lully's ''Armide.'' This segment is obscure even by Mr. Godard's standards, which is saying something; while it does derive loosely from the opera itself, the film maker's idea of setting the scene at a gymnasium among weight lifters who utterly ignore two swooning, casually naked young lovelies has its ludicrous side. So does Robert Altman's Grand Guignol approach to Jean Philippe Rameau's ''Les Boreades,'' in which a band of gruesomely made-up extras (partly the cast of Mr. Altman's film ''Beyond Therapy'') plays an audience of lunatics. The most prettily pretentious segment of all is from Charles Sturridge, the director of ''Brideshead Revisited,'' as he accompanies Verdi's ''Forza del Destino'' with black-and-white footage of children stealing and burning a Mercedes-Benz."
