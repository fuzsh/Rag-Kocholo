Glastonbury Fayre has just been released on DVD in Britain with a commentary with Roeg and a review here that clarifies the situation - apparently Roeg shot the film and did a rough cut then left to make Don't Look Now, whereupon it was finished by Peter Neal (who is credited as the only director involved on imdb). However I would take issue with with the packaging hyperbole that the film has been \"unseen for over thirty years since its cinema release\", since the BBC showed the film a few years ago as part of their warm ups for their annual Glastonbury coverage.\n\nI also love the BBFC warning on the back of the DVD that the film \"contains full frontal nudity and drug taking\". It seems so obvious that it was a Nic Roeg film now!\n\nRe: Nicolas Roeg\n\nQuote\n\n#3 Post by antnield » Fri Feb 04, 2011 11:25 am\n\nInterview with Roeg from the Winter 1984/85 edition of Sight & Sound in which he discusses working with Truffaut on Fahrenheit 451.\n\nRe: Nicolas Roeg\n\nQuote\n\n#4 Post by Robin Davies » Sat Feb 05, 2011 12:39 pm\n\nThere's a Nic Roeg season at the BFI Southbank in London next month.\n\nRe: Nicolas Roeg\n\nQuote\n\n#5 Post by MichaelB » Thu Mar 03, 2011 6:28 am\n\nThere is indeed - and I've just uploaded a full 1080p HD trailer of Walkabout onto YouTube.\n\nRe: Nicolas Roeg\n\nQuote\n\n#6 Post by Duncan Hopper » Thu Mar 03, 2011 6:40 am\n\nHe was there last night introducing 'Eureka'.

It's a film that's charlie sheen crazy and it has some over the top acting but I think it's the last true Roeg film. Insignificance is honestly much better, tighter and enjoyable but contains none of the sexual obsession or uncomfortable violence that always kept the audience tittering between a profound reaction or nausea. It's a film that needs rehabilitation and he should be the first out there stumping for its merits.\n\nRe: Nicolas Roeg\n\nQuote\n\n#13 Post by Robin Davies » Fri Mar 04, 2011 4:24 pm\n\nMichaelB wrote:It was a relatively late reschedule, so it's only just been announced.\n\nNo, the reschedule was announced on the BFI website on or before the 28th January.\n\nRe: Nicolas Roeg\n\nQuote\n\n#14 Post by MichaelB » Fri Mar 04, 2011 4:39 pm\n\nNic Roeg's participation was announced this week.\n\nRe: Nicolas Roeg\n\nQuote\n\n#15 Post by Robin Davies » Sat Mar 05, 2011 11:05 am\n\nMichaelB wrote:Nic Roeg's participation was announced this week.\n\nAh, I see.\n\nI thought Jenny Agutter might be a bigger draw though!\n\nRe: Nicolas Roeg\n\nQuote\n\n#16 Post by MichaelB » Thu Mar 10, 2011 10:53 am\n\nRoeg on Eureka, filmed during the 2 March event mentioned above.\n\nRe: Nicolas Roeg\n\nQuote\n\n#17 Post by j99 » Fri Mar 11, 2011 12:30 pm\n\nA Guardian interview about the current BFI retrospective.\n\nRe: Nicolas Roeg\n\nQuote\n\n#18 Post by MichaelB » Thu Mar 17, 2011 1:00 pm\n\nWalkabout has an unexpected fan.\n\nRe: Nicolas Roeg\n\nQuote\n\n#20 Post by Robin Davies » Thu Mar 17, 2011 4:36 pm\n\nI suppose John Simon is a useful negative barometer of film quality.
