        "text": "i once had a major hollywood ep snap at me a bit because i basically said that people hold up \"citizen kane\" like some sort of holy grail and i don't think doing that is super great. he didn't like that. and told me if i ever wanted support or funding from people like him or his friends, i better respect the history of hollywood. that was over 5 years ago but i still think about the sting of that conversation sometimes. it wasn't his words that stung. it was the fact that i wanted to not seek to copy what has already been done, and not blindly obsess over pretense and snobby bookshelf armchair reverence. and he felt the need to press that out of me, if only in firm words. that isn't to say it isn't a great film, or there wasn't huge cinematic innovation in its creation (because it obviously was and there absolutely was). but to hold anything as an end-all of filmmaking and try to recreate the heart of it over and over instead of lauding that it was done, thinking what could be better, and growing from there is kind of the problem with hollywood. never mind the inherent static that comes with being told over and over (at the time) that you can't give a first time feature director any sort of budget, and knowing this first-time feature director didn't even want the job and was chased by hollywood to give him millions of dollars (given inflation) to direct the movie. the whole point of the film being amazing was all the rules it broke and all the innovation in cinematic storytelling. yet now so many (especially newer) filmmakers want to make \"the next 'citizen kane'\" when they should be making the next amazing breakthrough in storytelling. have i seen the film in full? of course. does the line \"rosebud\" haunt me? of course. does it inspire me to try to find ways to innovate, tell stories differently, take risks, try new things, do things in ways people say \"isn't the way it is done\" - of course. and by that very inspiration, i have no desire to make \"the next 'citizen kane'.\" because isn't that the point?"
