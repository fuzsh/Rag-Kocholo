        "text": "In this ongoing series, we revisit some of our favorite music movies—from artist docs and concert films to biopics and fictional music flicks—that are available to stream or rent. Our selections this month focus on musician-actors finding their perfect roles. Stream The Man Who Fell to Earth on Amazon Prime.\n\nOut of all the dozens of nonfiction films made about David Bowie, none is as notorious as Cracked Actor. The short, dense BBC documentary dispatched director Alan Yentob to the U.S. in late 1974 to chat with the 27-year-old artist in the rare moments when he wasn’t touring Diamond Dogs, recording Young Americans, or stuffing his delicate nostrils with cocaine. Bowie’s appearance in the doc is alarming; always slight, he’d crossed the fine line separating fashionable svelteness from skin-stretched-over-bones frailty. In an early scene, he sits in the backseat of a limo weaving through the desert, swigging 2 percent milk and riffing on how he, like the fly he’s spotted in the carton, is a “foreign body” in America.\n\nShambolic as it was, this performance landed Bowie his first, and probably greatest, leading-man role in a major motion picture. British filmmaker Nicolas Roeg, whose achievements in the first half of the ’70s had rivaled the musician’s own—beginning with the bad-trip Mick Jagger showcase Performance, followed by harsh childhood fantasy Walkabout and the parental horrors of Don’t Look Now—originally had other names in mind to play the title character in his adaptation of Walter Tevis’ 1963 science fiction novel The Man Who Fell to Earth. Along with Peter O’Toole, the author Michael Crichton made the shortlist because, at 6-foot-9, he matched the otherworldly height of Tevis’ extraterrestrial protagonist.\n\nBut when casting agent Maggie Abbott screened Cracked Actor for Roeg, he was sold—so much so that he spent eight hours waiting at Bowie’s home when the star failed to show up for their first meeting. It’s not hard to see why. Tevis (who also wrote The Queen’s Gambit and The Hustler) described his humanoid-alien hero, living under the name Thomas Jerome Newton, as “improbably slight, his features delicate, his fingers long, thin, and the skin almost translucent, hairless. There was an elfin quality to his face, a fine boyish look to the wide, intelligent eyes.” If anyone fit this description, it was Bowie. What’s unfortunate is that, due to some combination of that physical resemblance, his freshly killed-off extraterrestrial alter-ego Ziggy Stardust, and the heavily sensationalized fact that he spent much of the mid-’70s in a coke-fueled fugue state, Bowie rarely gets the credit he deserves for crafting his character. The writer Philip Hoare summed up the general impression in the David Bowie Is exhibition catalog: “The Man Who Fell to Earth works because he’s playing David Bowie.”\n\nThat assessment undersells not only Bowie’s dynamic performance, but also the complexity of his alien visitor as written. A poetic, philosophical, and profoundly melancholy work of sci-fi expressionism, the film follows Newton as his quest to procure water for his advanced but dehydrated planet takes him to our own world. After landing in New Mexico, he hires a patent lawyer (Buck Henry) to help harness the technological breakthroughs of his native civilization, build a corporate empire, and amass the billions of dollars he needs to make a spaceship to return to a planet whose survival depends on his success. Along the way, Newton—who is initially polite and soft-spoken but emotionally detached—falls for a hotel employee (Candy Clark’s sweet, callow Mary-Lou), becomes addicted to alcohol and television, and sees his long-planned homecoming thwarted by a conspiracy of the government, rival megacorps, and his own confidants.\n\nParticularly as interpreted by Roeg and screenwriter Paul Mayersberg, the story echoes some of the most formative tales in Judeo-Christian mythology: Lucifer’s fall from heaven, Adam and Eve’s expulsion from the Garden of Eden, the betrayal and persecution of Jesus Christ. (Roeg actually roots the plot even deeper in Western culture, invoking Greek mythology with a shot of the Renaissance painting Landscape With the Fall of Icarus—another man who fell to earth.) These are stories of negative transformation, from a holy being into one that is doomed; their tragedy comes in tracing how the protagonist’s hubris, divinity, or both give way to human frailty. Bowie framed the narrative similarly in a 1976 Melody Maker interview: “It’s very much the thing of someone with a purist idea in the beginning and the whole concept becoming corrupt as it is carried out. It’s a very, very sad film.”\n\nDoing justice to a character’s soul-deep transformation requires nuance—which is to say it requires understanding, alertness, and yes, acting on the part of the performer. Much of the press surrounding The Man Who Fell to Earth, over the years, has described Bowie as an amateur or a non-actor—which ignores the fact that, before spending the better part of two years inhabiting a character of his own creation, he’d trained in mime with underground legend Lindsay Kemp. With that in mind, it’s not so surprising that in early scenes he manages to convey both the authority of a superior life form and his character’s discomfort in such a flimsy excuse for his own skin, purely through his tense movements and gentle, purposeful tone of voice. Though his subtle tics can be easy to miss, I’ve never seen a human being put on eyeglasses the way he does—securing them on his ears first, then the bridge of his nose—at his first meeting with the lawyer. By the end of the film, however, Newton’s stiffness has wholly abated; drunkenly chasing Mary-Lou around his bedroom with a revolver in his hand, he’s all sloppy, spontaneous emotion. It takes a certain amount of control to move between what are more or less opposite states of being.\n\nAlthough he had a fearsome cocaine habit going in early 1975, Bowie temporarily cleaned up in anticipation of a summer spent on set in the New Mexico desert, the quintessentially American, almost dystopian backdrop of both UFO folklore and the waking nightmare of atomic bomb testing. Instead of drugs, Bowie brought a small entourage of handlers and hundreds of books. (“I was dead scared of leaving them in New York because I was knocking around with some pretty dodgy people and I didn't want any of them nicking my books,” he explained, a few decades later.)\n\nAnd he made a largely positive, if unconventional, impression on his collaborators. Tony Richmond, the talented cinematographer whose panoramic style drew out parallels between the sun-bleached red clay canyons and Bowie’s bleach-streaked orange hair, remembered him as “great to work with—a bit weird, but great. He always turned up on time.” He was conscientious, too. “What was really neat about Bowie was that he always wanted to run dialogue and rehearse, which I attribute to him being a musician,” Candy Clark told biographer Marc Spitz. “We wanted to get it right and Nic wanted it word for word.” In a wild, behind-the-scenes Creem cover story from December 1975, Roeg insisted Bowie had brought more than just his spacey aura to the role. “I think a lot of rock stars think they can just transfer their art or their personality to film,” Roeg reflected. “David is quite an exception to the rule.”\n\nOf course The Man Who Fell to Earth capitalizes on who Bowie was, both physically and within popular culture, as well as what he could do as an actor practicing a craft. Roeg set many scenes in the same limo Bowie rides around in throughout Cracked Actor; cast his bodyguard, Tony Mascia, as the alien’s chauffeur; kept the singer’s two-tone hairstyle; and let him choose his own, Japanese-influenced wardrobe. Who can say if the overall impression he creates, of a creature whose body and soul is rejecting the world it’s been transplanted into, is just the default state of an addict in withdrawal? Yet beyond the superficial, Bowie apparently came to feel there was, as he put it to NME in 1980, “very little essence of myself” in the role. In fact, it seemed that he’d found the experience of ceding his creative sovereignty to Roeg quite psychologically grueling. Perhaps that’s why such tension arose over his attempts at an original score, which might have given Bowie more of a voice in the final product, but which the director rejected in favor of some relatively bland music by John Phillips.\n\nThe myth surrounding The Man Who Fell to Earth implies that Roeg essentially built a movie around Bowie, who simply had to show up at call time with his preternatural strangeness, his emaciated form, and his overstimulated twitch. My suspicion is that what the director really saw in Cracked Actor was a man in the same transitional place with his art that Thomas Jerome Newton was in with existence. “One half of me is putting a concept forward and the other half is trying to sort out my own emotions,” Bowie told Yentob. “I couldn’t decide whether I was writing characters or they were writing me.” Which meant Ziggy Stardust had to be sacrificed to save his creator, even if it was hard to see what—or who—a worthy successor might be.\n\nIf Bowie’s career felt to him, at the time, like a dying planet, then Ziggy was the life force that had drained out of it—one he’d have to travel far from home to replenish, only to end up on a very different mission. Like his cinematic avatar, he would need to metamorphose or die. Newton never got to make his own return voyage, but inhabiting a character of someone else’s invention might well have put Bowie on a path back to himself.\n\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
