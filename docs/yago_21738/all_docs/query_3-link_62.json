        "text": "The album is dead, long live the film soundtrack.\n\nSo seems to be the odd catch-cry of local music buyers, according to surprising end-of-year sales figures released by ARIA on Thursday.\n\nIn a year where Drake and Ariana Grande dominated headlines, and local faves Amy Shark and Troye Sivan earned popular and critical raves, 2018's biggest album turned out to be an unlikely outlier: the soundtrack to Hugh Jackman's P.T. Barnum-inspired movie musical The Greatest Showman.\n\nReleased way back on Boxing Day in 2017, which perhaps partly accounts for its loftier numbers, the album spent 49 weeks in the top ten last year, earning sales \"in excess of 3x Platinum\", ARIA revealed (a \"Platinum\" accreditation from ARIA signifies at least 70,000 copies shipped).\n\nThe Greatest Showman's result marks the first time a soundtrack has topped ARIA's end-of-year album chart since Moulin Rouge in 2001.\n\nAlso landing prominent spots on the list were the soundtracks to Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's A Star Is Born (3), Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody (5), the Kendrick Lamar-curated Black Panther (20), and Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again (22).\n\nOnly three artist albums actually released in 2018 finished among the year's top ten, and all by male rappers: Post Malone's Beerbongs & Bentleys (4), Eminem's Kamikaze (6), and Drake's Scorpion (7). ? by controversial rapper XXXTentacion finished at #12, after interest piqued following his June murder.\n\nAmy Shark was the highest-selling local artist on the albums list, with her ARIA-winning Love Monster finishing at #14. Vance Joy's Nation of Two (18) and Keith Urban's Graffiti U (19) were the only other Australian works among the top 20.\n\nThe list marks the second consecutive year three soundtracks have featured among the end of year top ten, with Moana (5), Trolls (6) and Guardians of the Galaxy 2 (9) featured last year.\n\nIn a more hopeful sign, Sydney pop-rockers 5 Seconds of Summer had the top-selling single of 2018 with Youngblood, becoming the first local act to top the end-of-year singles charts since Anthony Callea with The Prayer in 2005.\n\n\"We've always said to be recognised in our home country is more special than anything. To have the number one song of 2018 is a very proud moment for this band,\" 5SOS said in a statement.\n\nSydney crooner Dean Lewis also placed highly, with his torch-burner Be Alright the fourth-highest-selling single behind Drake's God's Plan and Ed Sheeran's Perfect. Amy Shark's I Said Hi, the next placed Aussie single, finished at #31."
