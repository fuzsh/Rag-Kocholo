        "text": "In Jarman’s hands, it’s not an illogical way to approach cinema. Jarman got his start as a painter in London in the 1960s and he continued to paint even after his filmmaking career took off. And as a director, he consistently returned to classic themes often, the kind beloved by Renaissance painters—martyrdom, melodrama, self-destruction. The sheer overwhelming look of his movies command the audience to stare as much as watch, effectively blurring the lines between fine art and film. Plot matters in his work, yes, but it’s never foremost. Language, too, can be more of a sensory experience than a narrative one. Jarman’s first movie, Sebastiane, made in 1976, is entirely in Latin.\n\nBut the lasting power of Jarman’s films may be that, no matter how aesthetically beautiful they are, they never soften their radical edge. This was part of his political project: to open the annals of art history and, through his movies, use that history to invigorate punk, leftist themes so often wiped out by more mainstream treatments of history. In Edward II, for instance, the gay love story between the King and Piers Gaveston of Christopher Marlowe’s play is elevated and made central. In Caravaggio, the painter’s bohemian delinquency is turned into his charm. But it’s Blue, the movie Jarman made as he was dying from complications due to AIDS, that might be his most harrowing legacy. Due to the disease, Jarman was losing, of all things, his eyesight, and Blue would be his final, overwhelmingly visual testament to film. The screen is filled with just one hue, a gleaming blue. Various voices, including Jarman’s, flow through a dialogue about love and loss. With nothing but color filling the screen, you’re reminded why something as everyday as the ability to see can become a revolutionary experience."
