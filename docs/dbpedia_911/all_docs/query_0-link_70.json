        "text": "Mercedes-Benz is gearing up to roll out an updated version of its G-Class, featuring a novel kinetic suspension system borrowed from the cutting-edge tech used in its current SL and GT models.\n\nThis updated suspension is expected to dramatically enhance both ride comfort and handling. Instead of the conventional anti-roll bars, the new system employs an interconnected damping setup that uses electro-hydraulic flow valves to dynamically alter both rebound and compression. These changes are calculated based on multiple variables such as speed, steering angle, body movement, and the state of the road.\n\nAdding another layer to the system's intricacy is how it operates when one wheel compresses. The damper's piston extends upwards, channeling hydraulic fluid to the other side, aiding the rebound on the opposite damper. The dampers' stiffness is regulated by two nitrogen gas-filled accumulators, which store excess hydraulic fluid and distribute it to the flow valves when required.\n\nWards Auto recently had the chance to experience the new system as a passenger in a 2025 Mercedes-Benz G-Class. They noted that the system not only boosts the vehicle's on-road performance but also enhances its off-road capabilities, including wheel articulation.\n\nRalf Haug, the head of suspension development at Mercedes-AMG, stated, “It gives us greater breadth of ability between the various driving modes. We’re able to go softer at one end and firmer at the other end of the spectrum, than we are with the more conventional suspension and the anti-roll bars that we use today. It also offers faster and more fluid response with greater body control and the foundation for than we have now. We saw the advantages it brought to our sports cars and immediately began thinking what it could do for our off-road models.”\n\nThe report from Wards Auto mentioned that the prototype they rode in appeared to outperform the previous G-Class in terms of handling while also delivering a smoother ride. The system also excels at reducing body roll and enhances off-road grip.\n\nThe innovative suspension technology was previously most notably adopted by Citroen in the World Rally Championship during the early 2000s, prior to being banned by the FIA. The system was commercialized by Tenneco under its Monroe brand and is presently employed by both McLaren and Rivian."
