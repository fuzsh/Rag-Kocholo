        "text": "With over 60 years of off-road heritage, the Land Cruiser has become an icon in the 4WD market. Its unrivalled off-road performance and durability have earned it a rock-solid reputation as one of the world’s toughest and most reliable 4x4s.\n\nKey to the Land Cruiser’s peerless off-road capability is its combination of a highly durable, deformation-resistant, body-on-frame construction with the unique level of guidance and technical support it offers drivers. Several user-friendly functions not only make tricky sections passable in terrain where even the most skilful drivers might otherwise struggle, but also assist beginners with their driving technique.\n\nThe Land Cruiser is now available with a new 2.8 litre D-4D turbo-diesel. It delivers 130 kW/177 DIN hp and can be mated to a 6-speed manual gearbox or a brand new 6-speed automatic transmission.\n\nHelping even unskilled drivers maximise the vehicle’s off road performance, the Land Cruiser’s all terrain support systems make it one of the most technically advanced, safe, pleasurable and easy to use four-wheel drive vehicles in the world.\n\nHowever, recognising that style, comfort and on-road performance are equally important to customers, the Land Cruiser combines this full off-road capability with a stylish exterior design, high standards of quality and comfort, a new Toyota Touch 2 Go Plus multimedia system and superior on-road driving pleasure.\n\nNo other SUV can offer the new Land Cruiser’s unique combination of off-road performance and on-road dynamics. Its powerful road presence, enhanced ride quality and high levels of on-board technology hallmark it as a premium 4x4 with the perfect blend of go anywhere capability, comfort and refinement.\n\nNEW 2.8 D-4D AND TRUSTED 4.0 VVT-i ENGINES\n\n• New 2.8 litre, four-cylinder turbodiesel engine available with new 6-speed Super ECT automatic or 6-speed manual\n\n• 7% increase in maximum torque, 11% increase in low speed torque, 9% increase in fuel efficiency\n\n• 4.0 VVT-i now available with 6-speed automatic transmission\n\nAll-new 2.8 D-4D Global Diesel Engine Technology\n\nAvailable on 3-door and 5-door models, Toyota’s newly developed 2.8 D-4D Global Diesel (GD) engine combines an 11% increase in low speed torque and a 7% increase in maximum torque with a 9% reduction in average fuel consumption.\n\nThe engine features Toyota’s first-ever urea Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system that can eliminate up to 99% of NOx emissions, one of the main causes of air pollution.\n\nThe new 2,755 cc, 16 valve, DOHC four-cylinder engine comes equipped with a new, variable nozzle turbocharger with intercooler and develops 130 kW/177 DIN hp at 3,400 rpm.\n\nMated to the new 6-speed Super ECT automatic transmission, the 2.8 D-4D develops an impressive 370 Nm of torque at only 1,200 rpm, and a maximum 450 Nm of torque between 1,600 and 2,400 rpm. It will accelerate from 0-100 km/h in 12.7 seconds, and on to a top speed of 175 km/h. Average fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are reduced by 9% to 7.4 l/100 km (7.2 l/100 km for 3-door) and 194 g/km (190 g/km for 3-door) respectively.\n\nWhen mated to the 6-speed manual transmission, the Land Cruiser 2.8 D-4D develops maximum of 420 Nm of torque between 1,400 and 2,400 rpm. It will accelerate from 0-100 km/h in 12.1 seconds, and on to a top speed of 175 km/h while returning an average fuel consumption of 7.4 l/100 km (7.2 l/100 km for 3-door) and CO2 emissions of 194 g/km (190 g/km for 3-door).\n\nThe new 2.8 D-4D engine incorporates a comprehensive range of measures designed to save weight, enhance combustion efficiency and reduce friction.\n\nA resin head cover has been adopted, and the thickness of the entire cylinder head has been reduced. The resultant weight reduction contributes significantly to lowering energy consumption and, hence, improving fuel efficiency.\n\nThe efficiency of the intake and exhaust ports, and the fuel injection system, has been optimised to maximise torque. Two intake ports are used in unison, according to the engine speed: a tangential port that produces a high swirl flow, agitating the air/fuel mixture to enhance combustion efficiency, and a helical port that achieves a high flow volume.\n\nThe engine features an electronically controlled, common-rail type fuel injection system that achieves higher pressure and more advanced injection pressure control, and a new piston shape has been adopted to match the new shape of the combustion chamber.\n\nPrecise pilot injection matching the state of the ambient air occurs before the main injection to shorten ignition delay, combining stable combustion in even the world’s harshest environments with quiet operation and high thermal efficiency.\n\nThe new turbocharger is 30% smaller than its predecessor and features a newly-developed turbine for improved efficiency, and a newly-developed impeller that provides instantaneous acceleration response and produces maximum torque over a wide rev range.\n\nThe unit is equipped with a water-cooled Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system with an EGR cooler bypass function, and also benefits from a swirl control valve in the intake manifold.\n\nThe adjacent positioning of the catalyst combines cleaner performance with a reduction in size of some 30% and a reduction in the number of exhaust system components from 18 to just three. The elimination of up to 99% of NOx emissions through use of Toyota’s urea Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system ensures the 2.8 D-4D Land Cruiser complies with Euro 6 regulations.\n\nMechanical friction within the engine has been minimised through the adoption of a high-efficiency vacuum pump, a roller rocker-type valve train and a low friction timing chain, further improving combustion efficiency.\n\nEnhanced 6-speed Super intelligent Electronically Controlled Automatic Transmission\n\nThe 2.8 D-4D engine is mated to a 6-speed Super intelligent Electronically Controlled automatic Transmission (6 Super ECT) which benefits from several new control systems designed to improve both fuel economy and driving performance.\n\nHigh-speed Gear Effective Utilisation Control determines the availability of high-speed gears in real time according to driving conditions. For instance, taking into account vehicle loading and throttle setting, the system will determine whether 6th gear is available or the vehicle should remain in 5th to achieve the optimum balance of driving power and fuel efficiency.\n\nDeceleration Downshift Control optimises downshifts when decelerating to improve fuel efficiency. The fuel supply is automatically cut off during periods of engine braking, unless engine speed drops to the low rpm threshold , when fuel injection is resumed to prevent engine stalling. Accordingly, the transmission maximises engine braking by selecting a lower gear to prevent engine speed dropping below the low rpm threshold, thus extending fuel cut off periods to drastically enhance fuel economy.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)-SHIFT Control incorporates Accelerator Immediate Close and Immediate Open Control. The former makes it easier to maintain the current gear when the accelerator pedal is suddenly released, enhancing both engine braking force and responsiveness when accelerating again. The latter performs downshifts immediately on sudden depression of the accelerator pedal, enhancing throttle response.\n\n4.0 VVT-i petrol engine\n\nOnly available on 5-door models, the petrol engine is a lightweight, 3,956 cc, 24 valve, chain-driven DOHC, direct injection V6 with Dual VVT-i. The 4.0 VVT-i is now mated to the new 6-speed super ECT automatic transmission and develops 207 kW / 282 DIN hp at 5,600 rpm and 385 Nm of torque at 4,400 rpm. While achieving 0-100 km/h acceleration in 10.9 seconds and a top speed of 175 km/h, it generates CO2 emissions of 248 g/km, and returns 10.6 l/100 km in the combined cycle.\n\nUNRIVALED ON- AND OFF-ROAD DRIVING PERFORMANCE\n\n• Electronically modulated Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System\n\n• Multi-Terrain Select System\n\n• Angle gauge, traction control and differential lock operation screens for enhanced off-road performance\n\nSuspension\n\nThe Land Cruiser benefits from a front independent double wishbone and rear four-link with lateral rod suspension. The shock absorber oil seal construction and damping force have been optimised to help ensure reliability whilst improving handling stability and ride comfort.\n\nThe Land Cruiser may also be equipped with an electronically modulated Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS), which optimises the effect of the front and rear stabilisers for enhanced performance both on- and off-road.\n\nThe front cylinder rod diameter, rear cylinder piston diameter, front stabiliser bar diameter and thickness, front stabiliser bush inner diameter, front lower arm stabiliser bracket thickness and frame KDSS bracket thickness have all been developed to ensure a gentle vehicle behaviour, revising the front/rear weight transfer whilst cornering, and promoting excellent handling stability and ride comfort.\n\nThe Land Cruiser further benefits from an Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS) system which allows the driver to fine tune the vehicle’s ride characteristics with a choice of ‘Normal’, ‘Comfort’ and ‘Sport’ settings.\n\nOperating in conjunction with AVS, an electronically modulated rear air suspension features five control modes –including an Auto Levelling function and a switchable Height Control function- to maintain optimum control of the rear four-link with lateral rod suspension regardless of occupant numbers or payload.\n\nOff-Road Performance\n\nOff-road, KDSS virtually disconnects both front and rear stabiliser bars, further enhancing the Land Cruiser’s outstanding wheel articulation to ensure ground contact for all tyres over even the most severe terrain. And both AVS and the electronically modulated rear air suspension systems feature bespoke, off-road settings to maximise the vehicle’s all-terrain abilities.\n\nThe Land Cruiser’s proven, permanent four-wheel drive, two-motor transfer system employs a Torsen Limited Slip Differential (LSD) in the centre differential. It is capable of automatically varying torque distribution between the front and rear wheels from 50:50 to approximately 30:70, in order to provide optimum torque distribution for any given scenario. In addition, the rear differential may be locked to maximise the vehicle’s off-road capabilities.\n\nFurther enhancing the Land Cruiser’s permanent four-wheel drive technology, an Active Traction Control system (A-TRC) uses both brake and engine control to distribute torque appropriately to all four wheels.\n\nAvailable on all models with six-speed automatic transmission a Multi-Terrain Select system (MTS) offers drivers a choice of five terrain modes: Mud & Sand, Loose Rock, Mogul, Rock and Dirt & Rock. The system automatically modifies the vehicle’s throttle, braking and traction control systems to suit the off-road conditions, providing the driver with optimum traction and vehicle control for any given scenario.\n\nOffering a choice of five speed settings, Crawl Control automatically controls the engine and brakes to maintain a set vehicle speed, helping the driver slowly descent or ascend slopes at a walking pace, or free the vehicle when stuck, without the need to touch the pedals.\n\nOff-Road Driver Assistance\n\nEasy control of these diverse systems and monitoring of the vehicle’s off-road performance is ensured by the centre console control panel and the addition of a multi-information screen.\n\nCentral to the panel, a switchable dial offers control of both the Multi-terrain Select system and Crawl Control speed adjustment. The panel further incorporates 4WD, AVS, MTS and Crawl Control, and centre and rear differential locking switches, offering drivers complete control of all the Land Cruiser’s off-road systems via one intuitive, simple-to-operate panel.\n\nLocated between the Optitron meters in the driver’s instrument binnacle, a 4.2” colour Thin Film Transistor (TFT) multi-information display operates in conjunction with the steering wheel-mounted multi-information switch to provide the driver with a comprehensive range of vehicle information. This includes MTS mode and prompting, vehicle suspension height and off-road system operation in real time.\n\nEnhanced off-road driving assistance is provided by an angle gauge, traction control operation at each wheel and differential lock operation screens. Information regarding individual wheel traction control, steering angle and differential lock operation can be displayed simultaneously, enhancing driver assistance during challenging off-road conditions.\n\nWhen MTS begins operation, a Multi-terrain Monitor will automatically display the view ahead of the vehicle on the 7” centre console display screen. Using front, front and rear side, and rear cameras, the system features a versatile display mode capable of showing either independent or combined, front, side and rear views.\n\nThe Multi-terrain Monitor also displays a comprehensive range of additional information, including the view range of the cameras, the locations of obstacles detected by the clearance sonar, steering linked guide lines which predict the path of the front tyres, vehicle width and length parallel lines, and the position of the front and rear tyre contact patches.\n\nBOLD DESIGN AND REFINED INTERIOR QUALITY\n\n• Front design featuring an evolution of the classic Land Cruiser grille and LED headlamps\n\n• Intuitive, switchable dial for simple control of off-road features\n\n• 4.2” colour TFT multi-information display offering a comprehensive range of vehicle information\n\n• New Brown & Black dual-tone leather interior\n\nExterior Design\n\nThe Land Cruiser measures an overall length of 4,780 mm (4,355 mm for the 3-door model) and boasts exceptional manoeuvrability with a minimum turning circle of just 5.8 metres (5.2 metres for the 3-door model).\n\nThe 32 degree off-road approach angle, the 25 degree departure and 22 degree ramp breakover angles ensure the model’s off-road abilities.\n\nThe exterior design of successive Land Cruiser generations has combined the stylish aesthetics of a vehicle entirely at home in any environment with the robust image of durability and power expected from a genuine four-wheel drive machine.\n\nThe front of the Land Cruiser draws on several structural elements from this unique design heritage.
