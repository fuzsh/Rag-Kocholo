        "text": "The system utilizes valved hydraulic dampening to help control both the rebound and compression stroke of the suspension, making landings on challenging, unforgiving terrain safer and more controlled by eliminating bounce on initial impact.\n\nThe TiSHX suspension system utulizes titanium and aluminum for a better performance-to-weight ratio. The shaft is coated in titanium nitride to reduce seal stiction and friction while providing wear and corrosion resistance.\n\nThe weight reduction achieved with titanium allows for use of a wider and more robust spring, increasing performance and preventing premature failure due to fatigue without a significant weight penalty to the system.\n\nThe TiSHX is a true bolt-on system ready to go out of the box and does not require any calibration. Our engineers and test pilots spent hundreds of hours in the field fine-tuning and adjusting the dampening for top performance at minimum and maximum gross weight. The shock length is adjustable to ensure a perfect fit for each aircraft.\n\nThe TiSHX pairs with an optional lightweight safety cable system that utilizes titanium lugs and offers additional peace of mind."
