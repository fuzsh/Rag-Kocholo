        "text": "BEGINNING YEARS â BRISK BLAST FOUNDED\n\nIn 1916, cars still rode on carriage springs.\n\nIn 1916, cars still rode on carriage springs. After all, early drivers had bigger things to worry about than the quality of their ride. Like keeping their cars from rolling over the rocks and ruts that often passed for roads. Flat tires were frequent and service stations werenât. Drivers had no choice but to patch and re-inflate their own tires along the roadside.\n\nPARTNERSHIP FORMED\n\nIn 1918, McIntyre became Meyerâs partner and vice president.\n\nTo a young mechanic and entrepreneur name August F. Meyer, this was an opportunity too great to pass up. It seemed logical to Meyer that, with all those flat tires, there should be quite a market for tire pumps. Lured by two acres of prime downtown land and a $500 cash bonus from the Chamber of Commerce, Meyer established the Brisk Blast Manufacturing Company in Monroe, Michigan. Meyerâs next step was to purchase the assets of a St. Louis, Missouri business that made tire pumps. Under Meyerâs leadership, Brisk Blast became a leading producer of tire pumps.\n\nSoon, Brisk Blast was producing over 5,000 tire pumps a week. And Meyer saw bigger things ahead.\n\nSo did a local Dodge dealer named Charles S. McIntyre. McIntyre knew the auto industry. And Meyer knew a fellow visionary when he saw one. In 1918, McIntyre became Meyerâs partner and vice president.\n\nMONROE AUTO EQUIPMENT COMPANY\n\nIn 1919, Brisk Blast became the Monroe Automobile Equipment Manufacturing Company.\n\nIn 1919, as the company continued to grow and diversify, Brisk Blast became The Monroe Automobile Equipment Manufacturing Company. Then, more simply, The Monroe Auto Equipment Company.\n\nThe Monroe spirit of innovation was already hard at work when the company perfected the first self-oiled, single-barreled tire pump. Sales climbed to over two million a year.\n\nFIRST SHOCK INTRODUCED\n\nIn 1926, the first MonroeÂ® Shock Eliminator was introduced.\n\nBy the mid-1920s however, two important development changed the nature of Monroeâs business forever. Across the country, service stations started offering free air. And, in Detroit, they started manufacturing cars with spare tires as standard equipment.\n\nBy this time, Monroe was busy applying the technology of the single-barreled tire pump to a purpose no one else had yet envisioned: smoothing the ride for Americaâs drivers. In 1926, the first Monroe Shock Eliminator was introduced. Over the years, one Monroe innovation followed another.\n\nMONRO-MATICÂ® SHOCK\n\nIn 1951, the Monro-MaticÂ® became the best known shock absorber in the world.\n\nIn 1951, the Monro-Matic became the best known shock absorber in the word. In fact, it remained the standard of the aftermarket industry and the shock used by most American carmakers through the 1950s.\n\nRACING AT INDIANAPOLIS 500\n\nIn 1953, Bill Vukovich won the Indianapolis 500 of Monroe shocks.\n\nMeanwhile, Monroe began demonstrating the quality and importance of its products in other ways. In 1953, Bill Vukovich won the Indianapolis 500 on Monroe shocks. That win was followed by a long and rich history of Monroe racing victories, each one making Monroe shocks better known to drivers all over the words."
