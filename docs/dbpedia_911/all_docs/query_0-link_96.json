        "text": "Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE)\n\n[ undergraduate program | graduate program | faculty ]\n\nAll courses, faculty listings, and curricular and degree requirements described herein are subject to change or deletion without notice.\n\nCourses\n\nFor course descriptions not found in the UC San Diego General Catalog 2024–25, please contact the department for more information.\n\nAll undergraduate students enrolled in MAE courses or admitted to an MAE program are expected to meet prerequisite and performance standards, i.e., students may not enroll in any MAE courses or courses in another department which are required for the major prior to having satisfied prerequisite courses with a C– or better. (The department does not consider D or F grades as adequate preparation for subsequent material.) Additional details are given under the various program outlines, course descriptions, and admission procedures for the Jacobs School of Engineering in this catalog. Furthermore, the majority of MAE courses have enrollment restrictions that give priority to or are open only to students who have been admitted to an MAE major. Where these restrictions apply, the registrar will not enroll other students except by department stamp on class enrollment cards. The department expects that students will adhere to these policies of their own volition and enroll in courses accordingly. Students are advised that they may be dropped at any time from course rosters if prerequisites have not been met.\n\nWhile most lower-division courses are offered more than once each year, many MAE upper-division courses are taught only once per year, and courses are scheduled to be consistent with the curricula as shown in the tables. When possible, MAE does offer selected large enrollment courses more than once each year.\n\nLower Division\n\nMAE 02.
