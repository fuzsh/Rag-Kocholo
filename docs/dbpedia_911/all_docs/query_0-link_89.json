        "text": "Why Use the Developability Classification System (DCS)?\n\nApproximately 40-75% of drugs in current development pipelines can be considered to have either poor bioavailability, nonlinear pharmacokinetics, or a significant food effect on drug bioavailability due to low solubility.\n\nA suboptimal formulation can have significant negative effects on both project timelines and patient exposure; for example, a too-low dose can impact therapeutic effect. If a formulation strategy is not performed properly, delays and surprises can add up to two years to your development.\n\nOur pharmaceutical scientists are expertly trained in the developability classification system (DCS), which uses a visual ranking to predict the factors that are critical to in vivo performance, such as drug solubility.\n\nTo select the most appropriate formulation strategy, the DCS classifies potential drug molecules into five categories: Class I, Class IIa, Class IIb, Class III, and Class IV.\n\nApplying DCS as a Formulation Strategy During Hit-to-Lead\n\nIn traditional preformulation approaches during the hit-to-lead phase, the kinetic solubility and Caco-2 cell permeability of several potential drug series are determined. These evaluations are critical for conducting early ADME and biology studies, but potential challenges to oral drug delivery are rarely considered at this stage.\n\nThe hit-to-lead stage is seen as an early opportunity to understand potential development risks associated with a chemical series. Using in-house assays, the solubility in fasted state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF) and permeability in Caco-2 cells are determined.\n\nThis data is then evaluated using an in-house DCS tool to determine a classification and risk factor for a series. This information guides formulation strategy scientists to an appropriate series to take forward and to determine a suitable development pathway during lead optimization.\n\nDCS During Lead Optimization for Maximum Drug Bioavailability\n\nThe DCS class is determined as part of the comprehensive early pharmaceutics assessment at the end of lead optimization. The thermodynamic FaSSIF solubility and Caco-2 permeability data are assessed to determine the classification. The API is assessed further to determine the rDCS classification, leveraging proprietary dissolution, and precipitation assays.\n\nWhen incorporating DCS into a formulation strategy, clients have a full understanding of potential barriers to drug bioavailability and elucidates strategies to overcome them. Determination of this classification empowers both the formulator and the chemist, ensuring more predictable drug bioavailability and a formulation strategy that can be taken forward.\n\nOur chemistry team works collaboratively with our formulation strategy experts to make decisions on the most appropriate compound to take forward for safety assessment trials and beyond.\n\nHow We Can Advance Your Formulation Strategy?\n\nFollowing determination of a compound’s DCS class, here’s what you can do next:\n\nUsing data derived from ADME and solid-state studies, a suitable drug candidate can be nominated.\n\nFurther dissolution studies can be performed to refine the classification further. These studies account for biorelevant conditions, inhibition of crystallization, a compound’s ionization properties, and potential food effects.\n\nInitiate appropriate formulation strategy in order to maximize exposure of the drug for PK studies or safety studies when delivered orally.\n\nFormulation TechnologyDCS ClassificationIIIaIIbIIIIVAPI in a Capsule••Solubilizers••••Crystallization Inhibitors••Complexation•••Miconization••Salt Formation••Polymorph Screen••Amorphous Dispersions••Lipid Vehicles••Nano Suspension••Prodrug Formation••\n\nOur comprehensive set of pharmaceutical sciences and approaches can bring your formulation strategy to the next level. We work with clients to seamlessly develop and execute the most cost-effective strategy based on the outcomes of the DCS.\n\nHow Can We Help You?"
