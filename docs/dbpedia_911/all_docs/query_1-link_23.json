        "text": "Monroe Intelligent Suspension announces that its CVSA2/Kinetic H2 suspension system is featured on the new McLaren 750S supercar, and available to provide superior performance for a broad range of vehicles.\n\n“We are proud to have helped McLaren establish a new benchmark for vehicle dynamics and driver engagement. Kinetic suspension technology enables the capabilities of this powerful automobile,” said Romain Nollet, group vice president and general manager at Monroe Ride Solutions.\n\nThe 750S is a replacement for the 720S. With a 4.0L twin-turbo V-8 engine producing up to 750 hp and 800 pound-feet of torque, the 750S accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0-62 mph) in 2.8 seconds, with a top speed of 332 km/h (206 mph), according to the company.\n\nAvailable in coupe and spider body styles, the model features the third generation of McLaren’s Proactive Chassis Control system, with the CVSA2/Kinetic H2 system as its centerpiece. Kinetic H2 is a hydraulic system with four CVSA2 electronic dampers offering adaptive hydraulic roll control technology that helps maintain optimal stability in all conditions.\n\nThe CVSA2/Kinetic H2 system helps reduce vehicle weight by replacing mechanical anti-roll bars, officials noted. The system’s versatility allows its use on a variety of vehicles."
