        "text": "Interesting and reminds me of my roots at Conti. I joined in 2003 and we just stopped a semi dry system after the Bosch system in the Mercedes E class was not accepted by the market due the pedal feeling of the fallback level. Now we see the technology returning which just proofs that the long term thinking will happen at some point, just have to get the right time for it. But by the way, people tend to forget that brakes are not just for safety and nowadays sustainable. They also offer comfort. In 2003 we developed the Hill Start Assist. The brakes remain applied even after the brake pedal is released and hence cars are not rolling away anymore. In 2003 this function was innovation, today it is commodity\n\nInfrared technology is widely used in the manufacturing of motor vehicles. From driving mirrors to windscreen wiper fluid cylinders, virtually every component of a car comes into contact with infrared at least once during its production. That's why selecting the right emitter is crucial to achieve the desired effect. Excelitas Noblelight offers a large range of infrared emitters, making it easy to select the perfect one for your manufacturing needs. Their emitters are suitable for a variety of applications, including drying and curing car body paint, bonding friction material on brake parts, and welding light cluster assemblies. Trust Excelitas Noblelight to provide the right infrared emitter for your needs.\n\nðŸ”§ Maximizing Camshaft Position Sensor Efficiency ðŸ”§ Keeping your United Motor Products' camshaft position sensor in top condition is key to your vehicle's performance. This sensor plays a vital role in synchronizing engine timing, affecting both fuel efficiency and emissions. A common issue is sensor contamination, which can lead to inaccurate readings and engine misfires. Regular checks for dirt or oil deposits and ensuring a clean connection can prevent these problems. Remember, a properly functioning camshaft position sensor not only optimizes your engine's performance but also prolongs its life. Trust United Motor Products for sensors that deliver precision and reliability every time you hit the road. #UnitedMotorProducts #CamshaftPositionSensor #TechTip #AutoMaintenance #CarRepair #VehiclePerformance #EngineTiming #AutomotiveCare #CarMechanics #AutoEngineering\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dShVfGqc I'm using gate motors to make a three wheel electric vehicle (low speed) as the front drive train. The rear motorcycle wheel will steer using a damper system and the angle of the wheel. More than probably actuated hydraulic shocks to control the height of each side of the wheel, in turn the angle."
