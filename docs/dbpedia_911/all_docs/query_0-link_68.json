        "text": "Taylor Devices Fluid Dampers offer an optimized solution with non-linear characteristics that are held to tight tolerances so they do not degrade after a seismic event and Taylor Devices Dampers allow perfect re-centering of the structure due to near-zero resistance force at near zero velocities. In fact they are instantly ready for the next aftershock or future earthquake. Automobile suspensions converged to viscous damping-type shock absorbers over 100 years ago for the same reason: to be ready for the next bump.\n\nTaylor Devices Dampers also allow for relief of forces that could otherwise build up in BRB’s as a result of creep and shrinkage as a building ages. BRB’s are yielding members and therefore their characteristics and life are unpredictable after use. BRB’s need to be replaced after a significant seismic event. They add stiffness which can be counter-productive when adding damping. BRB’s cannot provide energy dissipation for low level earthquakes, BRB’s only function as a brace, until a larger earthquake strikes, when they may or may not yield. BRB’s also increase acceleration levels in the structure, due to their added stiffness and hysteretic behavior.\n\nFriction devices produce a constant force output which increases the maximum column stress under any deflection of the structure, because of their hysteretic behavior. Taylor Devices Dampers do not increase column stresses since their force output is out of phase with the deflection stresses of the structure. Friction dampers cause continual stress during all thermal expansion and contraction of the structure. Additionally, friction devices restrict a structure from restoring itself to the original position after dynamic events. Taylor Devices Dampers always allow the structure to re-center itself.\n\nVisco-elastic devices have an output that is between that of a damper and a spring. During significant seismic events, the spring force dominates, producing a response that increases column stresses at any deflection point. This does not happen with Taylor Devices Dampers. One of the most serious problems with visco-elastic devices is an unacceptable increase in force at low temperatures coupled with an accompanying overloading of the bonding agent used to “glue” the visco-elastic material to its steel attachments. At high temperatures, unacceptable softening or reduction of output force occurs. This thermal variance over the temperature range can be in the range of 50 to 1. In comparison, Taylor Devices Dampers include a bi-metallic orifice that acts like a thermostat to provide uniform performance over a temperature range of -40°F to +160°F. This proprietary feature also allows the damping function to remain completely stable throughout many cycles of operation that may occur during a significant seismic event.\n\nSimply stated, Taylor Devices’ Fluid Dampers provide an optimized solution, they are reliable, predictable, re-usable and their benefits have been proven through decades of use. This is the same reason that automobiles have used fluid damping devices within their suspension for more than a century to soften the impact to cars as they drive over bumps, and instantly be ready for the next bump."
