One that is likely to make waves is the Teslasuit, which uses a full-body suit to offer haptic feedback, enhancing the immersion through the sense of touch. It also offers an array of biometric sensors enabling the user’s heartbeat, perspiration, and other stress indicators to be measured. Its potential uses are unlimited.\n\nUsing electro-tactile haptic feedback, the Teslasuit can mimic sensations like bumping into a wall, touching an object, or the impact of a punch in AR/VR settings. We witnessed these sensations first-hand at CES 2019. From the prickly patter of raindrops to the growing waves of static, we experienced how the Teslasuit can bring virtual worlds to life.\n\nArtur Sychov\n\nFounder & CEO of Somnium Space\n\nTESLASUIT brings the next level of immersion for users allowing for the first time ever to feel Somnium Space’s virtual environment. We are excited to deliver this exclusive and strategic partnership with the TESLASUIT team and to work closely together in order to push the boundaries of what is possible further.\n\nComplete sensory VR immersion is years away, but is one of the most oft-requested and dreamed about advances in the industry. Teslasuit appears to be the next product to market that aims to let you feel it all in VR, and it looks a hell of a lot like Wade’s suit.\n\nThe Teslasuit has been around for a while, but the technology remains impressively futuristic. We poured our lockdown bod into one (yes, they do go very, very large) and, frankly, VR is never going to be same. A virtual drive in a racing car was next and, again, once we forgot we were sitting in a booth at FutureLab, the sensation was quite something.\n\nOne of the most exciting devices shown is something straight out of a movie: Teslasuit. Simply put, whoever wears the suit feels like they are actually in whatever environment they see and hear. If you've seen Steven Spielberg's Ready Player One, this suit is what you see in the movie.\n\nBernard Marr\n\nFuturist, Influencer\n\nNew methods of teaching and learning will become increasingly effective as new technologies emerge.

As soon as I zip into the jet-black, skin-tight, space-agey Teslasuit, I am mentally transported. And that’s before I even put on the VR goggles. After calibration, the extended-reality experience begins. I put on the virtual reality goggles and my real-world surroundings melt away. My imagination keeps returning to acupuncture, which I’ve never experienced.\n\nThe Teslasuit has been around for a while, but the technology remains impressively futuristic.

It’s a very interesting concept because the feeling of the G force that they give you is your own muscles fighting the other muscle group to make the movement.\n\nOne of the most exciting devices shown is something straight out of a movie: Teslasuit.
