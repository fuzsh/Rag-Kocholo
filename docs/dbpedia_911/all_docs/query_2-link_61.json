        "text": "Update 10:39 AM ET: Rivian clarified new suspension is not due to recent recall.\n\nThe Rivian R1T all-electric pickup and R1S all-electric SUV will equip a new intelligent suspension system geared for hypercars.\n\nRivian will source its new suspension system from Tenneco, its previous suspension provider. However, the R1T and R1S will now utilize Tenneco’s CVSA2/Kinetic® H2 semi-active suspension technology, which will be integrated into the pickup’s skateboard chassis.\n\nRivian sourced the R1T’s central valve body block from Tenneco, with a similar unit being supplied to McLaren, MotorTrend said last year. Variable-orifice shock valves were also used on the R1T and were manufactured by Öhlins Racing, which Tenneco purchased in 2019.\n\nTenneco said its CVSA2/Kinetic® H2 suspension tech was developed in close partnership with Rivian and other automakers. Henrik Johansson, VP and General Manager of Tenneco’s Advanced Suspension Technologies, said the goal was to increase ride performance for battery-electric and hybrid vehicles.\n\nThe CVSA2/Kinetic® H2 technology improves ride performance with continuously controlled damping and advanced hydraulic roll control. By eliminating the need for traditional sway bars, weight reductions and decoupled single-wheel disturbances provide better road contact and traction, offering better damping and roll control systems than comparable options. Exceptional off-road performance is also enabled by the suspension’s Kinetic® roll control system, which offers increased handling agility and comfort.\n\nRivian R1T and R1S models will also utilize Tenneco Clevite Elastomers front and rear suspension bushings and top mounts, among other parts, to contribute to a smoother, quieter, and more comfortable ride. These additional parts dramatically reduce noise and vibrations to improve ride quality and cabin comfort.\n\nRivian equips new hypercar-focused suspension system"
