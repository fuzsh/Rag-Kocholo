        "text": "Wheel sizing\n\nSo from the ground up, let’s start with wheel sizing. From the tyre dynamics article, it should now be clear that the greatest contact patch size is desirable from a dynamics point of view. However in a practical sense there are implications; clearly a physical limit on wheel diameter and width exists.\n\nWidth and diameter are usually limited, directly or indirectly to a maximum size by the regulations. But let’s ignore that for a moment and concentrate on the theory: more contact area on a given tyre means a higher cornering stiffness. A fact that can be exploited both in adjusting the balance of a chassis and improving absolute lateral acceleration.\n\nThere are however, downsides to increasing width and diameter of a wheel and tyre assembly, which leads us nicely to the next topic; energy and inertia.\n\nEnergy and Inertia\n\nWheel and suspension components and their association with the notorious ‘unsprung mass’ needs little introduction. However, the importance of this mass when associated with dynamics is perhaps less understood further than that it should be minimised.\n\nThe unsprung mass of the vehicle when in motion is both rotational (in the case of wheel assembly) and translational. It is the inherent inertias of these components which we need to watch out for. A high inertia requires relatively large amounts of energy transfer to accelerate and decelerate, affecting the response of the system.\n\nGiven that these unsprung components are continually accelerating, decelerating and changing the orientation of the rotational axis (steered wheels) during a lap, the sensitivity of the vehicle to these inertias becomes important.\n\nIn the rotational sense this is significant; overcoming these inertias absorbs energy that would otherwise be used for acceleration and braking of the vehicle. Influencing factors here are the mass of the wheel but more importantly the radius, which is a squared term in the rotational inertia equation.\n\nTranslationally, the effect is that as the unsprung mass travels into compression over a perturbation in the track surface, it is given a large amount of kinetic energy. This energy then has to be absorbed by the springs and dampers and ultimately leads to larger oscillations in contact patch pressure. This reduces the average grip level over a given track surface, clearly it is desirable to keep this mass to a minimum. As we will see in later sections, minimising these variations in contact pressure is high in order of priority within racecar vehicle dynamics.\n\nSuspension configurations\n\nFurther to communicating forces from the ground into the chassis (and vice versa), the suspension is also responsible for presenting the wheel to the road surface in the desired orientation – the intricacies of which are highly important in the sense of tyre dynamics.\n\nThe configuration most widely seen in racecars is the Double Wishbone/A-Arm system so we will direct our focus here. With short and ‘tidy’ load paths; members are loaded almost exclusively in tension and compression offering package and weight (inertia) advantages over other configurations, but it also offers the greatest control over the kinematic behaviour of the wheel in response to vertical displacements.\n\nLet’s imagine a theoretical, well set-up race car with 3° of negative camber and 0.2° of toe out at the rear wheels. The driver enters the car into a turn and the chassis experiences 3° of roll once equilibrium is reached. The outside rear tyre therefore is now perfectly upright relative to the road surface (on the assumption of no tyre distortion) and has maximised its contact area. Meanwhile, the 0.2° of toe out is serving to increase the slip angle at the outside rear wheels and move the tyres towards the slip angle at which peak lateral force is generated.\n\nHow does the Mercedes F1 DAS system dynamically change toe?\n\nThis method of adjustment allows chassis balance to be finely tuned and is easily measured and adjusted trackside with very simple equipment such as below.\n\nJack Lambert, Lead Development Engineer for Jaguar I-PACE eTROPHY highlights; ‘We do adjust our geometry for each particular circuit, adapting the characteristics of the car to suit specific corner styles we see at our city circuits – if we need a little more agility, or stability for example.’\n\nThere is no one-size-fits all solution to wheel geometry and the optimal set-up is unique to each car and even further, unique to each application, however knowledge of what characteristic is influenced with each geometry change and having a clear objective can certainly help.\n\nFurther to static camber and toe on a vehicle, there are methods we can use to manipulate these characteristics dynamically, as steering angle and wheel travel are introduced. These fall into the domain of kinematics and compliance and will be discussed in the next section."
