        "text": "Work the Triceps, Biceps, Chest, Legs, and Core with the Kinetic Bands Body Weight Workout System\n\nMyosource is the parent company of Kbandstraining\n\nWhat is Suspension Training? The purpose of suspension training is for the user to work against the force and tension of their own body weight. This is a type of resistance training used to develop muscle, joint, tendon, and ligament stability, flexibility, strength, and endurance all at the same time. A benefit for using the Kinetic Bands Body Weight Workout System is the ability to burn calories, workout with intensity, and reduce the chances of injury.\n\nHistorically, people have used ropes and other items for Suspension Training. These items were found to work, but were very difficult to use without a pulley-type mechanism. They were also cumbersome and uncomfortable to grip. Kinetic Bands Body Weight Workout System contains easy to grip cushioned handles, comes in a compact bag, is easy to use, and is very affordable.\n\nVIDEO EXERCISES USING THE KINETIC BANDS BODY WEIGHT WORKOUT SYSTEM:\n\nONE LEGGED SQUATS AND JUMPS: This exercise is all about balance, core strength, and fat burning. It is important to keep a good pace and intensity throughout the entire workout. If you find yourself slowing down, pick up the pace to keep the intensity going.\n\nAttach the workout system to an elevated strong and solid object.\n\nWith a handle in each hand, stand on the left leg and lean back, keeping the right leg out in front and off of the ground.\n\nLower the body by bending the knee and then stand back up.\n\nPerform 12 reps on each side.\n\nRemember to keep the chest high the whole time.\n\nAfter performing 12 reps on each side, release the handles and perform 12 jumps.\n\nBend the knees into a squat position.\n\nExplode off of the feet, driving the body into the jump.\n\nAs you are leaving the ground, straighten the legs into a full jump.\n\nWork for depth and stick each landing with soft feet.\n\nWhen landing, bend the knees into a squat position once again, exploding upward into another jump.\n\nAfter performing 12 jumps repeat the One-Legged Squats with the KB Duo.\n\nPUSHUPS AND FLYS: This exercise is great for intense strength building in the chest. Perform 3 sets of 12-15 reps each.\n\nSlide the feet into the handles of the workout system.\n\nGet into a pushup position. The feet will be suspended off the ground. For the more advanced, push out to elevate the feet even higher off of the ground.\n\nMaintain balance and control.\n\nAfter completing Suspension Pushups, work with the Myosource Upper Body Kinetic Bands. This particular exercise is not about speed, but how you flex your muscles and stay in control.\n\nPlace the Myosource Upper Body Kinetic Bands around a pole or stable object.\n\nGrab the handles and face away from the pole or stable object.\n\nPlace the left foot in front of the right with the left knee slightly bent.\n\nStand far enough away from the pole or stable object to where the bands are ready to expand.\n\nPull the bands forward in front of the body and then backwards to the starting position. Repeat.\n\nROWS AND REVERSE FLYS: During the rows you are going to have to work to take the feet out front under you and challenge yourself. If you lay back and do not get enough resistance you will not get much out of the exercise. This set is a Row to Reverse Fly. The rows will build strength and the reverse flys will build power.\n\nStand forward holding the handles of the workout system.\n\nLean back at an angle, keeping body straight. Hold the body up to the handles.\n\nLower the body down until the arms are full extended.\n\nPull back up to where the body and handles are touching.\n\nPerform 10-12 reps. After, walk the legs out to perform 10-12 reps of the Reverse Flys.\n\nPull the body upward to the handles, extending the arms outward.\n\nLower the body back down.\n\nMake a line with the shoulders.\n\nStay under control to strengthen the muscles by getting a good flex.\n\nTRICEPS EXTENSION:\n\nHold on to the handles of the workout system facing outward.\n\nThe feet will be under where the System is contacted.\n\nBring the arms out to where the body is fully extended at an angle with the arms overhead.\n\nThe body will look like an angled line with the elbows bent.\n\nExtend the elbows to make the arms straight, squeezing the triceps each time.\n\nWhen the butt starts sticking up take a couple steps to straighten the back out.\n\nPerform 16-20 reps while maintaining high intensity."
