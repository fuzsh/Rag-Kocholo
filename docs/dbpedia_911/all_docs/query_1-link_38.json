        "text": "Harness greater control over your SV performance.\n\nReplacing traditional anti-roll bars with a sophisticated hydraulic circuit, the 6D Dynamics suspension system provides exceptional levels of roll support and significantly reduced pitch when accelerating and braking. In fact, this world-first system controls roll so effectively that 1.1g of lateral acceleration is available on the fitted all-season tyres.\n\nThe result is the most engaging Range Rover Sport of all time.\n\nAlongside an 8kg weight saving over traditional anti-roll systems, 6D Dynamics suspension intelligently responds to different driving styles – giving you a breadth of handling characteristics to reflect your current environment.\n\nA new SV Mode includes a unique calibration for roll stiffness, pitch stiffness, compression and rebound damping as well as lowering the car a further 15mm to ensure the ultimate dynamic driving.\n\nAnd because the vehicle stays flatter and the weight is distributed more evenly, more braking power is channelled to the rear for improved brake performance.\n\nThis is the supreme ride comfort and capability you expect from a Range Rover, with the reduced roll and stiffness you expect from a sports car.\n\nMeaningful weight savings, strength and stiffness. The attributes that push the boundaries of driving dynamics are all present in the SV 23-inch carbon wheel. Born from three years of rigorous development and testing, it represents a relentless focus on the exceptional.\n\nFeaturing an innovative split five-spoke design – made possible by the intricate layering of carbon fibre weaves – the combined wheelset offers a weight saving of 21kg over its forged aluminium equivalent. This equates quicker acceleration and deceleration, increased agility, and enhanced fuel economy.**\n\nThe superior strength and stiffness offered by the innovative carbon composite structure and moulding process also means greater steering stability. It’s a wheel that pushes the boundaries of driving dynamics and improves driver enjoyment on-road and off-road.\n\nThese are available in satin or dark tinted gloss lacquer options, depending on the chosen body colour.\n\nDeveloped in collaboration with the world leader in brake technology, Brembo, Range Rover Sport SV features a unique Integrated Power Booster (IPB) braking system for unrivalled stopping performance.\n\nDesigned with enhanced resistance to high temperatures and peerless pressure distribution, this performance braking system achieves exceptional power, fade resistance, and reduced wear. Calibrated by the SV team to deliver the most responsive pedal feel ever in a Range Rover.\n\nInformed by the application of Formula 1 technology, the 440mm discs are the largest fitted to a production vehicle.\n\nGuaranteeing high mechanical strength and durability, the lightweight ceramic material of each brake is reinforced with carbon fibre and features an additional ceramic friction layer on both surfaces of the disc. Unsprang mass is reduced by a significant 34kg across all four corners.\n\nEven with the intense heat generated from the spirited track sessions – and testing at more than twice the requirements of the AMS (Automotive Sport) standard – the unique eight piston cross layout delivers an optimised circulation of pad pressure and a fade resistance surpassing many sports cars.\n\nAssisted by parallel twin-scroll turbochargers for responsive power and boosting across the rev range, Range Rover Sport SV ensures enhanced driveability, peak power, and efficiency over any previous V8 Range Rover.\n\nEach cylinder features spray bore technology – replacing typical steel liners with an extremely thin spray-on metallurgy. This reduces weight and friction, while improving heat transfer and thermal efficiency. The Valvetronic variable intake and double VANOS valve actuation system augment the cam operation for optimal combustion performance.\n\nIn Dynamic Launch Mode, the MHEV system increases performance with electronic assistance to provide the vehicle’s most responsive acceleration.\n\nAcoustically, Range Rover SV sounds as good as it drives. The active exhaust system features two-stage electronically controlled valves to deliver a purposeful, modulated pulsing at lighter throttle openings.\n\nWhen SV Mode is activated, the mapping changes to a more performance orientated set-up – allowing the exhaust valves to be open and stay open more frequently. With increased engine speed and a greater, more sustained air flow, SV’s crisp, hard-edged character resonates with full theatrical effect.\n\nUsed by professional music producers and sound designers around the world, SUBPAC™ vibrotactile technology combines AI optimising software with two haptic amplifiers and four in-built transducers.\n\nAugmenting the vehicle’s 29 speaker MeridianTM Signature Sound System. It’s a complete revolution of automotive audio and a paradigm shift in your experience of music.\n\nWith six wellness modes, ranging from ‘calm’ to ‘invigorating’, biometric testing has shown the Body and Soul seat to have measurable benefits for occupants, including reduced stress and improved concentration.\n\nSupported by intuitive safety alerts, the SV Body and Soul seat takes the most immersive, personal media experience on every journey."
