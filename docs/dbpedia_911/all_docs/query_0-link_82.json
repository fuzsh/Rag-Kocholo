Enabling you to dispense as many as 12 different reagents simultaneously by utilizing 96 independently controlled outputs. Dispense any volume, of any reagent, into any well.\n\nBroad Range of Applications\n\nHigh Throughput Screening (HTS)\n\nAssay Development and Design of Experiment (DoE)\n\nEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA)\n\nPolymerase Chain-reaction (PCR) Workflows - Real-time and Digital\n\nBiochemical assay development and screening\n\nCell Culture and Bead-Based Assays\n\nNext Generation Sequencing (NGS) - Library Preparation\n\nOverview of the TEMPEST®\n\nState-of-the-art Dispensing Technology\n\nAt the core of the Tempest is a microfluidic design that can dispense discrete volumes of liquid with incredible precision across a wide range of sample types and viscosities.\n\nKey Features\n\nHigh Precision\n\nLow Volume Dispensing\n\nMinimize Reagent Waste\n\nSpeed and Throughput\n\nKeep Cells and Beads Suspended\n\nIntegrate with External Systems\n\nImport CSV Templates\n\nIncubation Re-Stack Option\n\nNo Consumables\n\nMicro-diaphragm Technology\n\nKey Features\n\nHigh Precision\n\nLow Volume Dispensing\n\nMinimize Reagent Waste\n\nSpeed and Throughput\n\nKeep Cells and Beads Suspended\n\nIntegrate with External Systems\n\nImport CSV Templates\n\nIncubation Re-Stack Option\n\nNo Consumables\n\nMicro-diaphragm Technology\n\nUnparalleled Ease and Excellence\n\nThe Tempest Liquid Dispenser utilizes patented microdiaphragm pump technology to allow researchers to maximize workflow efficiency from genomics to high-throughput screening workflows.\n\nEASE OF USE: The Tempest software is extremely user-friendly allowing for easy experimental design. The standard gradient and backfill buttons make designing an experiment even easier and faster.\n\nCOST SAVINGS:\n\nMiniaturize assay design and reduce reagent usage\n\nSave precious reagents through low dead volumes\n\nPrevent failed experiments with clog-free dispensing technology\n\nIntuitive software interface and experimental design\n\nNo Consumables. All components can be easily cleaned and re-used\n\n“A fantastic instrument! We use the Tempest in our high throughput biochemical profiling service. The team now has an automated process for our reagent additions that requires certain concentrations to be added to a plate in a \"cherry picking\" type of methodology. What was once done by two individuals can now be done by one. The Tempest has worked great\"\n\nChris Updike\n\nProduction Scientist\n\nSave on Consumables with Tipless Dispensing\n\nThe Tempest uses a patented microdiaphragm pump that meters and dispenses discrete volumes of liquid. This valve cluster can fill and dispense as fast as 10 times per second. This proven technology is incredibly fast and precise.\n\nWhen Speed Matters\n\nEach 8-nozzled microfluidic chip dispenses reagents rapidly with minimal waste. Most tasks are completed in fewer than 40 seconds:\n\nTypical Dispense Rates\n\n200 nL to 96-well plate = 3 seconds\n\n200 nL to 384-well plate = 6 seconds\n\n200 nL to 1536-well plate = 11 seconds\n\n5 μL to 96-well plate = 4 seconds\n\n1 uL to 384-well plate = 5 seconds\n\n10 μL to 384-well plate = 9 seconds\n\n20 μL to 384-well plate = 13 seconds\n\nThe Tempest can be customized to fit your application and budget. The system offers, plate stackers, a bar code scanner, independent vs general controls, as well as, any combination of up to 12 high (1 μL and 5 μL), or low volume (200 nL and 1 μL), microfluidic chips.\n\n“The Tempest allowed us to significantly scale up our biochemical HTS capabilities and has proven to be a reliable and accurate dispenser. We love the Smart Batch delayed dispensing feature as it greatly facilitates assay development work and converting end-point assays into kinetic assays, providing us more insightful data! The versatility of the Tempest in improving multiple workflows can't be overstated!\"\n\nOmar Alkhatib\n\nSenior Scientist II\n\nSave Time on Your Dispenses with Continuous Flow\n\nThe Continuous Flow (CF) chip adds exceptionally fast plate filling to the Tempest system's trusted reliability and precise low-volume dispensing. The CF chip uses a pressurized reservoir to dispense a constant stream of liquid from all eight nozzle positions and can be installed alongside the standard diaphragm chips to provide a complete automation solution to your plate-filling needs.\n\nCV <3% across all eight nozzles when filling a 96-well plate\n\nAdjustable flow rates, capable of >400 µL per second\n\nFill a 96-deep-well plate with 2 mL per well in under 2 minutes\n\nPlay Video\n\nPlay Video\n\n“We use the Tempest in a fully automated set-up for medium throughput quantitative analysis. The CVs are great and due to the ultra-low dead volume, we could dramatically reduce reagent costings. Furthermore, the very innovative and robust dispensing technology lead to reduced maintenance compared to the dispenser we used before. We are also very happy with the support by FORMULATRIX personnel. We definitely recommend the Tempest!”\n\nJohannes Fels\n\nPrinciple Scientist\n\nEasy-to-use Software\n\nThe software provides a straightforward, user-friendly way to design and execute even the most complex dispensing protocols. The control software offers an intuitive visual layout of both the plate design and the hardware setup, and provides tools to create gradient designs and backfills. Microsoft Excel integration allows you to manually edit well volumes for additional control.\n\nEasy-to-use Software\n\nThe software provides a straightforward, user-friendly way to design and execute even the most complex dispensing protocols.

End user adoption has been fantastic and the team would like to purchase more Tempests! Assistance from support personnel and sales is exceptional. This is the best non-contact small volume dispenser on the market.\n\nAnonymous Review\n\nA leading bio-instrumentation company\n\nWhat we enjoy the most about tempest:\n\nThe minimal dead volume required makes it very attractive as you save a lot\n\nThe CV for small volume(1 to 2ul) appears much more consistent than peristaltic pump competitor.\n\nThe speed at which it is dispensed is much more gentle than a peristaltic pump competitor or a bioraptr. It has a level of value for adherent cells as you are more likely to loose less cells.\n\n1\n\nReview the TEMPEST®\n\nAll fields are required.\n\nFirst Name\n\nEmail\n\nemail\n\nLast Name\n\nCompany/Institute\n\nRemain Anonymous?\n\nYesNo\n\nRating\n\nstarstarstarstarstar\n\nReview\n\n0 /\n\nkeyboard_arrow_leftPrevious\n\nNextkeyboard_arrow_right\n\n1\n\nRequest More Information\n\nAll fields are required.\n\nFirst Name\n\nno-icon\n\nLast Name\n\nno-icon\n\nEmail\n\nemail\n\nPhone #your full name\n\nCompany/Institute\n\nno-icon\n\nCountry\n\nState\n\nCity\n\nPostal Code\n\nHow Did You Hear About Us?\n\nRequest Brochure\n\nMANTIS Liquid DispenserTEMPEST Liquid DispenserFLO i8 Liquid HandlerF.A.S.T.
