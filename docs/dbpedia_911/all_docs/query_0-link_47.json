Engineering Biology\n\nVision\n\nSynthetic biology can be defined as the design and fabrication of biological components and systems that do not already exist in the natural world, for useful purposes. Engineering biology is the process of identifying synthetic biology solutions and translating them into products, or in MOD’s terms, capability.\n\nEngineering biology is a disruptive technology. Synthetic biology and engineering biology can provide new capability for UK defence and security, solving historically intractable defence problems.\n\nTechnical challenges\n\nThe top 3 challenge areas identified as potentially benefitting for engineering biology approaches have been identified as:\n\nMaterials\n\nCurrent processes to make existing military grade materials suffer from various drawbacks: availability of raw materials, unsustainable costs, high energy consumption, handling of toxic waste, and possibly compromising on some desirable properties to meet performance requirements. For many of these problems, traditional materials approaches have made progress but are facing diminishing returns on their efforts.\n\nThe UK Government has also made commitments to zero carbon targets in the future, which means pursuing less energy-intense approaches.\n\nConsequently, availability of many military relevant materials becomes limited and poses potential supply-chain risks for these countries.\n\nThere is also a pressing need for novel materials to provide new or enhanced capabilities, such as functional materials, where existing traditional materials science approaches have failed to make much progress.\n\nPower and energy\n\nEngineering biology concepts could provide a step change in power and energy provision, addressing several challenges currently faced in the area.\n\nHigh energy batteries can be flammable and explosive when abused. Approaches that can mitigate this either at the chemistry level by using novel cell materials or using engineered biology materials to prevent fire and thermal runaway as an appliqué to standard commercial off-the-shelf cells would be of interest.\n\nDespite significant research and advances in batteries (and other power sources) new military capability still require higher energy rechargeable batteries in smaller weights and volumes. Next-generation rechargeable batteries promise over 400 watt-hour per kilogram and 800 watt-hours per litre but there is interest in any technology that can improve these metrics even further. Primary (non-rechargeable) batteries are used less often, but are still used where their even higher specific energy and energy density warrants it. Engineered biology approaches to produce very high specific energy (>500 watt-hour per kilogram) and (1000 watt-hours per litre) single use batteries would also be of interest.\n\nSensing\n\nSensing is a fundamental enabler of defence and security activities. However, there is always a requirement for more sensitive sensors to a wider range of stimuli. Robustness is also necessary to avoid, for example, dazzling of sensitive sensors.\n\nCapabilities\n\nDelivery of this programme requires capabilities in:\n\nchemical, biological, and radiological\n\nhuman and social sciences\n\nexplosives and energetics\n\nsensing\n\nscience and technology futures and incubator\n\nadvanced materials\n\nabove water systems\n\nunder water systems\n\nair systems\n\nland systems\n\nhomeland security and counter-terrorism systems\n\nweapons\n\nBenefit to UK defence and security\n\nMaterials\n\nnew energetics\n\nlightweight armour\n\nDNA data storage\n\nself-healing polymers\n\nreactive camouflage\n\nPower\n\ndiversified fuel sources\n\nplace and forget power sources\n\nultra high efficiency solar\n\nnew battery paradigms\n\nSensing\n\nolfactory mimicry\n\nbioassembled sensing structures\n\nautonmous microbial reconnaissance\n\nbioquantum sensing\n\n2.

This includes the development of an ethical framework for human augmentation and the use of wargaming.\n\nThe project is also working with the UK armed forces to identify their problems, the challenges that they face (now and in the future) and their likely needs. The intent is to explore where human augmentation technologies could be applied to support the personnel who defend the UK and maintain national security.\n\nStrategic capabilities\n\nDelivery of this programme requires capabilities in:\n\nhuman and social sciences\n\nscience and technology futures and incubator\n\nchemical, biological and radiological\n\nadvanced materials\n\nAI and data science\n\nrobotics and autonomous systems\n\nBenefits to UK defence and security\n\nThis programme will:\n\nestablish a coherent approach to human augmentation throughout MOD and partners across government\n\ninform the defence vision and strategic ambition for human augmentation\n\nenable UK defence to prioritise the opportunities that are presented by emerging technology and those generation-after-next interventions to the present and future challenges concerning human performance\n\nidentify and develop generation-after-next technologies which will enable end user(s) and the UK armed forces to achieve their desired outcomes.\n\nlead the development of the likely mandated human augmentation policy\n\n3.

Support to Operations and Crises\n\nVision\n\nTo be the lead steward (and indispensable source) of technical support – science, engineering, technology, analysis – to operations and crises. To deliver timely, evidence-based and actionable responses to meet the urgent needs of operations in the UK and overseas, and at times of emergency.\n\nSupport to Operations and Crises facilitates the application of multi-disciplinary, cutting-edge skills that reside throughout the MOD’s strategic science and technology capabilities. It enables the MOD’s research portfolio to deliver novel solutions to urgent challenges directly to the front line (defending the UK and keeping it secure).\n\nThe vision is achieved by deploying experts or reachback to assured technical advice at the right time, in the right way and to the right people who need it most urgently. Informing strategic and tactical decisions by responding to commanders’ urgent science and technology requirements.
