The heritage and quality of the General Kinetic Engineering Corp ActiveShock product range are fully retained and supported as part of Horstman Canadaâ€™s ongoing operations.

Horstman active technology has been developed to provide the ultimate in high-performance suspension.

Proven on platforms such as the LAV-25, High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), SCANIA TGB30 and Lancer.

This technology differs from conventional suspension in that the absorbed energy is electrical, not heat, and is regenerative when the vehicle wheel is pushed toward bump (jounce), and powered when extending toward rebound.

Suitable for all vehicle systems, including wheeled and tracked, at all weight classes and providing true innovation to all-electric vehicles.
