RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. -- Arthur Lake, who played Dagwood Bumstead of the popular comic strip, 'Blondie,' in more than two dozen movies, died Friday of a heart attack. He was 81.

Lake suffered the attack Friday afternoon at his Indian Wells home, where he has been living in retirement. His wife, Patricia, and son, Arthur Jr., tried unsuccessfully to save him.

He died at Eisenhower Medical Center at 1:48 p.m.

Deputy Riverside County Coroner Nancy Traver said the apparent cause of the heart attack was arterial disease.

Movie fans knew Lake as the dim-witted husband of Blondie, played by Penny Singleton in the series of Columbia Pictures films based on the Chic Young comic strip characters.

Dagwood's high-pitched call for help -- 'Blonnnndie!!!' -- became his trademark.

The studio was in financial straits when it cast Lake and Singleton in its first 'Blondie' film for $85,000. The movie grossed $9 million and led to sequels including, 'Blondie Meets the Boss' and 'Blondie Brings Up Baby.'

Filmologist Don Miller called the signing of Lake as Dagwood 'the greatest piece of casting in the history of movies.' Lake 'made Dagwood a bit more dumb that he was in the funnies and etched the characterization more broadly. He was Dagwood Bumstead.'

Lake enjoyed his reputation as Dagwood and appeared at benefits where a huge Dagwood sandwich would often be bestowed upon him.

Lake was born April 17, 1905 as Arthur Silverlake in Corbin, Ky. His father and uncle formed an aerial act, 'The Flying Silverlakes,' with a touring circus. When Arthur was 3, he and his sister joined the family in a vaudeville act.

He moved to Hollywood with his mother at age 12 and made his acting debut in 'Jack and the Beanstalk' in 1917. Growing up, he went on to appear in such films as 'Dance Hall' in 1929, 'Indiscreet' with Gloria Swanson in 1931, 'Orchids to You' in 1935 and 'Topper' in 1937.
