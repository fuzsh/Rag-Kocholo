In 1972, she went back to work at the Montrose Post Office working her way up to Postmaster. She loved working there and was always happy to see her customers and would greet them with a warm smile, always patient and understanding with their requests. When Roberta retired in 2000, she said, \"What I will miss the most are my customers.\" and even in old age as she forgot customers names she always remember their post box numbers.\n\nRoberta spent her retirement at the house that she and Gaston built in Beaver Falls, B.C. She loved reading, gardening, aerobics, playing piano and for a time volunteering at the Fruitvale Library.\n\nRoberta was a loving daughter, sister, wife and mother. She had a wonderful sense of humour and was a positive influence to her family. She was a believer in dreams and encouraged her sons to follow their passions. She was the foundation of her family and will be greatly missed.\n\nShe is survived by her three sons; Mark (Jennifer), Michael and Glen, her granddaughter Misha and her sister Diane MacDonald.
