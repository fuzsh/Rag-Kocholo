        "text": "Lambert F. Florin (1905-1993) was born in Rainier, Ore., to Carl Hjalmar and Nanny Maria Florin. He died at his home in Portland, Or. Florin attended high schools in Portland and Vancouver, Wash. Until the early 1960s, he worked as a floral designer for Tommy Luke Flowers (Portland), with a stint during World War II in the Portland Fire Department. He and his wife, Dorothie, had one daughter.\n\nBy the early 1960s, Florin had combined his passion for ghost towns and photography to make a living writing heavily illustrated books on the subject, starting with Western Ghost Towns, published in 1961 by Superior Publishing. Superior remained his publisher throughout his writing career, which concluded in 1982 with Gold Locations in Oregon and Washington. Florin had a variety of other historical interests that fueled his writing, including historic cemeteries, churches, trees, and even outhouses. He also contributed illustrated articles to numerous magazines, including Alaska Sportsman, Desert Magazine, Frontier Times, and True West.\n\nFlorin's interest in historic trees led him to collect seed from a single-needle pinyon in Rockland, Nev., and plant it on the grounds of his Portland home on Tolman Street. The tree is one of the Heritage Trees of Portland, Or..\n\nThe collection consists primarily of photographs taken between 1960 and 1980 by Lambert Florin to illustrate his books on the history of the American West, along with some historic images he collected for his many projects. Major subjects documented by the collection include: ghost towns, abandoned mining operations, nineteenth century architecture, horse-drawn vehicles, grave markers, privies, and western trees. Many of the images were published by Superior Publishing Company (Seattle) in the following books written by Florin, which contain extended caption information for many of the images in the collection:\n\nRestrictions on Use\n\nThe Oregon Historical Society is the owner of the materials in the Research Library and makes available reproductions for research, publication, and other uses.
