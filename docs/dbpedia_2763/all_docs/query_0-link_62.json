        "text": "I left Hoswick, Sandwick Parish, Shetland, on Monday, the 21st day of October 1907, in company with my daughter Christina Agnes, the wife of William J. Manson, M.P.P., British Columbia, and their four children, who had been home on a visit from America, and were now on their return voyage.\n\nOn leaving by a carriage at the gate in front of my house, we were surrounded by a number of kind friends, principally women, evidently sorry to part with us. After bidding them all good-bye, we proceeded to Lerwick, 14 miles distant.\n\nOn our way north through the parish of Sandwick, we often had to stop, in order to bid farewell to friends who had come from villages, anxious to getas no doubt they thoughta last look of us; and now as I am writing in a far-away land, I am aware that their thoughts have been verified, as some of them have passed away into the eternal world. Almost the last one in the parish we parted with was my youngest daughter EmilyMrs George W. Goudieand as her mother had passed away only a few months before, I had enough to do to suppress my feelings, which were of a painful nature. The day was fine, and having left early in the forenoon, and the steamer on which we had to embark was not to leave Lerwick for Leith till 8 oclock at night, we had plenty of time to journey on in a slow, sure way. We halted now and again to shake hands with friends who wished to bid us goodbye as we passed along the road. On arriving at Lerwick we were received in a very friendly way by my nephew, Mr Charles J. Duncan, and his wife, and hospitably entertained. A few hours were spent in the town seeing friends and making purchases, and our berths having been secured and our luggage on board, we were soon comfortably placed in our respective cabins in the good s. s. St Rognvald. We arrived at Kirkwall, in the Orkney Islands, the following morning at 7 oclock. This was Tuesday, the 22nd October, and we left this port, the capital of Orkney, at 8 a.m., the sea being quite smooth. As we moved out, I noticed a number of fishing smacks in the harbour laden with salted wet cod fish from Iceland, and I was told by one of the officers of the steamer that the fish was sold to Messrs Chalmers & Co., merchants in the town. The principal of that firm I used to know as a merchant in Leith when I was in business there a number of years ago. On our way to Aberdeen we called at St Margarets Hope, a few miles from Kirkwall, and I had a walk on the pier recently built there. It had been raised about the same time that the much-talked-of large pier at Broonies Taing, Shetland, was constructed. I may mention here that I was not long a member of the County Council of Shetland before I began to agitate as to the necessity of getting a pier built at Broonies Taing, and, in order to show what perseverance can do, the building of the pier, mostly by Government money, became an accomplished fact, after fighting fiercely for about twelve years all opposition both in the County Council and outside of it. The Council was composed of menat least some of them who took more care of their selfish interests than the good of the community at large. It was rather a strange coincidence that I met on the pier at St Margarets Hope the gentleman who first proposed the scheme. We shook hands and congratulated each other 011 having lived to see both our projects carried to a successful issue at the same time.\n\nAfter bidding good-bye to this gentleman, I stepped 011 board the boat. She steamed on her way to the granite city, Aberdeen, and after a fine passage we arrived there the same day at 11 oclock at night. We had to take another steamer for Leith, as the St Rognvald had to be put in dock for repairs. There was some trouble in getting ourselves and luggage properly secured in the sister steamer, St Giles, at such a late hour, but once on board we were all right, having as good berths in the cabin as we had in the other boat. There is a restaurant in connection with the North of Scotland and Orkney and Shetland Steam Navigation Company near by the wharf where the steamers lie, thus giving passengers an opportunity to rest and take refreshments. Mrs Manson and I had coffee and something to eat, after which, the night being fine, and as the boat would not leave till 4 oclock next morning, we had a short walk. On our return we got on board and retired to rest. After a refreshing sleep we had a hearty breakfast, and enjoyed a chat now and again with passengers. We arrived at Leith between 1 and 2 oclock in the afternoon, and on nearing the quay 1 noticed it to be covered with men, women, and children, some of them evidently looking out for friends who had come by the steamer, but many, as I imagined, were there for no other purpose than to see and be seen. We had nine trunks, some of them large, and as we had to take steamer to London in the course of a few days we got them all placed in the Companys store close by, so that they would be ready for being readdressed and brought to the steamer. There were a number of vehicles and men in charge of them on the wharf, and we were very fortunate in employing a man named MLeod to drive us to our hotel in Edinburgh. He turned out to be one of the most obliging, punctual, and careful of cabmen, and we engaged him to take us from our hotel to the London boat, Fingal, at Leith Docks on Saturday, the 26th day of October. He came at the time arranged, and we got him to bring our luggage from the Shetland steamers store to the Fingal. This he did to our satisfaction, and we had pleasure in paying him what he charged.\n\nWe had spent by this time nearly four days in Edinburgh, seeing friends and making purchases.\n\nMy nephew, Mr Robert Duncan, and my grand-nephew, Mr Richard T. Johnson, and his wife, came on board to see us leaving. I may mention that Mrs Johnson had brought with them their baby boy, Sinclairnamed after meso that I might see him a second time while on my way to British Columbia. We left Leith about 7 p.m., and, now that we were on our way direct to the capital of the United Kingdom, we felt thankful that the sea was so smooth that no feeling of sickness annoyed us, and that for a time we were out of the whirling and exciting commotion of city life. Shortly after we withdrew from the company of the other passengers, in order to refresh ourselves by getting rest and sleep.\n\nSunday morning, the 26th October, dawned as the large steamer was ploughing the deep along the English coast towards the great city of London. As the weather was continuing fine, everyone on board appeared to be in good spirits. I had slept well, feeling much better both in regard to relaxation, appetite, and temper of mind, and I heard nothing to the contrary as to the condition of mind and body of those travelling along with me.\n\nWe all enjoyed a good breakfast of ham, eggs, and tea, also fish and other kinds of food, so that, although I was lengthening the distance between me and my old home in Shetland, I was cheerfully looking forward to getting a sight of London for the third time.\n\nI had conversation with Captain Dawson, who had command of the steamer. Owing to many vessels, large and small, sailing along the coast, he kept far to seaward to avoid collision. We arrived at Gravesend on Monday morning about 8 oclock, being the 28th day of October, and we were 21 miles from London. Up to this time we had steamed from Leith about 400 miles, and enjoyed the voyage very much. Before I leave making remarks about the steamer, I may mention that there was a painted map on the side of the galley naming the places along the coast which we passed, and I found it to be very interesting and instructive. The usual scenes on land and water, as we neared the great city of commerce and learning, met our gaze, while we carefully moved amongst the shipping at Hermitage Wharf, where the London and Edinburgh Shipping Company berth their steamers. We saw our luggage carefully warehoused there, and readdressed per rail to Liverpool, thence to the s.s. LaTce Erie, to sail for Montreal on the 6th November. I forgot to mention that as we entered the river Thames we were enveloped in a dense fog, thereby being under the necessity of lying at anchor and keeping the bell ringing almost every minute for several hours. This detained us so long that we lost the tide, and the passengers in consequence had to land in a small boat about 2 oclock in the afternoon of the following day, and call for their luggage at the wharf in the evening, when the steamer would be alongside.\n\nThis was on Monday the 28th October, and during the interval we went to the Stanley Dining Rooms, 99 Minories, E.C.Walter J. Bugden, proprietorand had dinner. The charges were moderate and the food bountiful and excellent.\n\nIt was shortly after this that we saw our luggage secured in the Companys warehouse, after which we first took a train and then a cab to see an English family with whom my daughter was acquainted, tlieir residence being 48 Harburton Road, Highgate, London, W.\n\nOn arriving there we were received with the greatest kindness, so much so that my daughter and her four children were not allowed to go to other lodgings.\n\nI put up in the Angel Inn, Highgate Hill, close by, where I received every attention, and enjoyed a refreshing sleep. After breakfast I called to see my daughter and grandchildren, where, to my surprise, I met the Rev. H. B. Oddy, who was at one time a Methodist preacher in Shetland, and had married a daughter Helenof the late William Hay of Sandfield, Sandwick Parish, Shetland, and grand-daughter of the late Rev. John Tulloch, who was Congregational minister in the same parish for a great many years. Mr Oddy had Mrs Oddy with him, and, as it happened, they were acquainted with the same people as my daughter was, namely, Mr and Mrs Smith, and meeting as we did, it made us all very happy. I may mention here that Mr Oddy had seen his way to become a Congrega-tionalist, and was now pastor of a church of that denomination at Southminster, Essex.\n\nHe turned out to be one of my best friends while in London, taking me round as he did to see as much of it as time would allow. The following are some of the places we visited. Tube railway to Leicester Square, National Gallery, Portrait of W. E. Gladstone, and many famous pictures, Trafalgar Square, Nelson Monument, Whitehall and St Jamess Palace, Government Offices, Downing Street with residence of Prime-Minister, Houses of Parliament, St Margarets Church, Westminster Abbey, W. E. Gladstones grave, Poets Corner with graves of Tennyson and Browning, Westminster Bridge, St Thomass Hospital, The Embankment, National Liberal Club, Strand, Law Courts, Fleet Street with all the newspaper offices, Ludgate Hill, Memorial Hall, St Pauls Cathedral, St Pauls Churchyard, where are some of the best shops in London, such as drapers, etc.; Cheapside, Bow Church, with day service, the preacher being Rev. Marcus Rainford; Guild Hallhad luncheon with Mr Oddy here; Mansion House, Royal Exchange, Bank of England, London Wall, London Bridge Monument, Covent Garden, Hotel Cecilone of the largest hotels in the world.\n\nWe travelled to and from the city by the underground railway, 125 feet below the surface, at the rate of 30 miles per hour. We also visited Waterloo Park, in which is St Josephs Roman Catholic Church, and we both went into it and heard some one groaning. At the same time a clergyman told me that there are 80,000 women of a certain questionable class in London, and I wondered if that person groaning was one of them getting a priest to pardon her sins.\n\nMy daughter, her children, and I visited the Crystal Palace on Wednesday, 30th October, and on the following day we called at the London and Edinburgh Shipping Companys Office to see about our luggage, and make it ready to be lifted by a cart to the station where the train leaves for Liverpool. We found the man in charge of the luggage very civil and obliging, and, in course of conversation, I came to know that he was a member of a Baptist Church, that his name was George Bright, and that he was married a sccond time. He said he had seen much of the world, spoke highly of his deceased wife as having been a devoted Christian, and now in the evening of his life he had been entrusted to do duty as a servant of the Company.\n\nI shook hands with him as we parted, and he asked God to bless me and bring me safe to the land of my destination. We thereafter called at the Canadian Pacific Railway Office to make sure that our tickets were all right, and, after getting these papers marked as being correct, we returned to our respective lodgings, where I enjoyed a third sleep in the Angel Inn. It is a nice old-fashioned house, and, being near the suburbs of the city, it is in a healthy situation, the proprietor and his servants being most attentive in every respect. They said they would be very pleased to see me in their house again.\n\nThe month of November had now dawned, and, after bidding my hotel friends good-bye, I walked the short distance of about one mile to Mr Smiths residence to accompany my daughter and her children to St Pancras Railway Station, where we were to take train for Liverpool at 10 a.m. Taking a conveyance we were in good time at the station, and arrived at Liverpool about 2 oclock p.m. We immediately thereafter called at the Canadian Pacific Railway Office to arrange some matters in connection with the passage across the Atlantic, and shortly after proceeded by ferry-boat to Birkenhead in order to see Mr John Stewart, 32 Howard Avenue, Liscord. On arriving there we were received with a very hearty welcome, several of his daughters and his son John, a commission agent, being present. We were pressingly asked to take tea with them, and after that was over, Mr Stewart, being an old intimate friend, and a native of Shetland, showed me through his house, which is a very fine one. Shortly after that we six guests bade the family good-bye. I may mention here that Mr John Stewart is a brother to Mr William Stewart, woolbroker, Leith, and to Mr George Stewart, author of the book entitled Shetland Fireside Tales, who resides in British Columbia. While taking tea with Mr Stewart he reminded me of an incident in our young days which I had entirely forgotten. He told me that when I was in my teens in charge of a day school in Levenwick, Shetland, 1 hit him on the side of his head for being unruly, and that I was the only man who had ever done that. Mr Stewart told the story in such a jocular way as to make all at table enjoy a hearty laugh. One of his daughters accompanied us to the car which was to take us near to the ferry. We crossed to the other side of the water and took the boat Carlow, lying in Nelson Dock, which was to leave for Dublin, Ireland, at 9 p.m.\n\nAfter a fine passage, we arrived there at 6 oclock the following morning. Mr W. Davidson, my grand-nephew by law, came on board to meet us, and in a very accommodating vehicle we drove to his house, and were received kindly by Mrs Davidson, Alice Johnson, and her two sisters, Helen and Lyla, who chanced to be there at the same time. Some years before I had been in Belfast when engaged in business in Leith, but this was my first visit to Dublin. This being the capital of Ireland, I felt much inclined to see through the city and get a view of the principal things worthy of observation. I therefore procured a guide and saw the following:Sackville Street, Nelsons Pillar, Trinity College, Bank of Ireland, Archway at Stevens Green erected in memory of soldiers who fell in South Africa at the time of the Boer war, College of Surgeons, Dublin Castle, Christ Church Cathedral, Four Courts, Custom House, and the International Exhibition, which was being held there at the time. I also went to see Guinness Brewery, which was founded about the year 1759, by the ancestors of the Guinness family. In order to give an idea of the quantity of stout or beer of all kinds sent out every year from this great source of the brewing interests, I may say that no less than 591,000,000 gallons of water are used annually, most of which come from the springs feeding the upper level of the Grand Canal in the County of Kildare. The total number of staff and employees is 3240.\n\nAn official of the Company, who is employed for the purpose of showing all visitors through the brewery, pointed out to us the various departments, and ultimately we were asked to step into a small neatly furnished room, where, if we were so inclined, we could have a glass of stout free of charge. The view I got of this wonderful establishment was very interesting, and to give anything like a full description of it would fill an ordinary sized volume. That being so, I shall now proceed to give an account of our future movements. My visit to the brewery was on 4th November, previous to which I had been visiting other places of interest, and now to-morrow being the 5th of the month, and our boat, the Lake Erie, to leave Liverpool for Montreal on the 6th, I felt somewhat anxious about getting ready to leave Dublin, so as to be in time for the liner. The evening of the 4th had given us time to pack up our traps. After a refreshing sleep and taking breakfast early next morning, we were in good time at the side of the steamer Wicklozo, bound for Liverpool. We were accompanied by Mrs Davidson and other friends to the boat to see us away ; but as she did not sail till 1 oclock, and the Lake Erie was to leave Liverpool the following day, I again began to get greatly solicitous about our being in time for the liner. Glad was 1 when the pealing of the bell announced our leaving the wharf, and so onward we bounded, the steamer making good way. We arrived late at night, so that we slept on board, and the steward having supplied us with a good breakfast, and not having overlooked the charge for allowing us to sleep in the steamer after our arrival, we hurriedly made for the shore. We made some calls in great haste, and at last were ready to embark on board the big steamer, with the hope that she would carry us safely across the Atlantic Ocean. She was so large and the tide so far out, that she could not come alongside the wharf. A small steamer called a tender by several trips took the passengers off', and just as I was setting my feet on the gangway, a gentleman tapped me on the shoulder, and asked if I were Mr Duncan. I replied by saying, Yes, that is my name, at the same time putting the question, Who are you, please. The reply was, My name is Williamson from Sandness, Shetland. He accompanied me on board the small steamer, and, as we had a few minutes to talk, he told me that he had been a sea captain and was now retired, and was living in Liverpool. Being a reader of the Shetland Times, he had always read my notes in that paper with great pleasure, and, having learned that I was to leave by the Lalce Erie, he had addressed two or three gentlemen before he spoke to me, because he was very anxious to see the writer of the notes referred to. As I have said, we only had a few minutes to speak to each other, and after getting his address I promised that, if I returned home by way of Liverpool, I would call to see him. So we bade each other good-bye with a Norse grip of hands, hoping to meet again.\n\nAfter all the changes I had passed through since leaving my house at Hoswick, I felt thankful to get on board the big steamer. I was not long on her deck before I began to make friends.\n\nMy daughter, her four children, our luggage, and myself now being safely on board, I was much relieved in mind. I had selected one of the best berths in the first cabinnow secondjust opposite the chief stewards office, and he turned out to be a gentleman from Scotland, of the name of Taylor, but had resided in Liverpool for a number of years. I got to be very friendly with Mr Taylor, partly arising from the fact that I had spent 25 years of my life in Leith and Edinburgh, near which he had resided, and, as he was a bit up in years like myself, we had much to talk about in common.\n\nThere were about three hundred passengers, more than the half of them emigrants in the steerage. We in the best second cabin received our first meal of roast beef, etc., seated at tables such as one can see in a first class hotel. The stewards and stewardesses were everything that could be desired, always ready to carefully serve, and it was noticeable that passengers occupied at all times the same seats at the tables, where they were first placed when they came on board. At all the tables the same rule was observed, and there were four meals of excellent food served every day. I think that the passengers in the steerage were supplied in the same way, but those in the first-class cabin were not allowed to mingle with the other class either in their apartments below, or when they assembled on the deck. I noticed, however, that the steerage passengers were cheerful, and often had sportive games on that part of the deck allotted to them.\n\nOn arriving near Belfast, a steamer came off with goods. She had a number of people on board to see the big liner, and some of them to meet friends as well. Among these were my grand-nieceAgnes Rockliffeand her husband, Mr Cleland, who is a partner in the publishing business of William W. Cleland, Belfast. Although a young man, he has travelled abroad, and was very desirous to see me, which would be for the first time. The desire was strengthened by the fact that his mother-in-law, my late brother Roberts daughter, was named after my late wife and myself, her name being Catherine Sinclair Duncan, now Mrs Rockliffe. Although a widow, she is wonderfully cheerful. She is much given to travelling, and I think she has a notion of visiting British Columbia. Mr Cleland kindly made me a present of a volume, entitled The Old Book Tested, by the Rev. John White, Belfast, and published by William W. Cleland, 61 High Street of that city. I have enjoyed the reading of it very much.\n\nThis being the morning of the 7th November and being near Belfast, a number of passengers are writing letters to be taken to the shore to be posted, and goods are being taken on board from the steamer referred to. Our boat is to leave at 1 oclock p.m. Conversation is going on among the passengers as they begin to get acquainted with each other; the children accompanying their parents and guardians to the other side of the ocean are all in great glee, running hither and thither on the deck. Everything is being made as secure as possible against storms, life-boats in particular being lashed with strong ropes to unmovables. On the deck, prepared for fastening, life-belts in great numbers are already placed so as to be easily obtained, and in fact all kinds of preparations are made and being made for emergencies. The time is nearing when those for the shore must leave the Lake Erie, and so there can be heard the word good-bye, as a number make their way to the small steamer. Immediately thereafter the big one began to move, and we were fairly under way to the Western world. About 3 oclock p.m. we were passing along the coast of Ireland not far from Belfast, and on Friday the 8th November we were ploughing the Atlantic Ocean at the rate of twelve miles an hour.\n\nThe wind was blowing a nice breeze from about south-west, and the sea was smooth. At about 11 oclock in the forenoon, the wind freshened up from the same direction, making it comfortable for passengers to have a walk on the deck. In this way, gentlemen began to get acquainted with each other, and, as time went on, the ladies had a chance to form a friendly feeling, the one with the other, in the same way. When the boat was rolling a little, it was no rare thing to see gentlemen assisting ladies. Sometimes one could be seen so gallant as to take a lady in each arm for a walk, and occasionally I did that myself, so as to steady them, because at times when by themselves there was a tumble, a thing everybody dislikes, especially the ladies. I may mention here that one day when it was very inviting as to weather, a stout, fine-looking young lady was walking alone, when on a sudden the steamer lurched, and down went the lady. She was hurt, but not seriously. I chanced to be on deck at the time, and rushed to her assistance, and ever after that when the steamer was rolling, she seemed quite pleased when I asked her to take my arm. But tumbling was not altogether confined to the ladies, as sometimes a gentleman could be seen to stagger. One day as I was walking at the heels of a very tall fellow of uppish bearing, down he went, fortunately falling on the soft part of his back. He was not injured, but his haughty gait was altered on a sudden, and he looked rather queer as he lay on his back on the deck of the steamer, surrounded by a number of spectators, some of whom were unable to refrain from laughing.\n\nIt may be well to notice at this stage of the voyage that all the passengers appeared to be well satisfied as to the suitability of their berths, and the meals were served punctually as follows:Breakfast at 8.30 a.m., luncheon at 1 p.m., dinner at 6 p.m., and supper at 9 p.m. Each table was attended by two stewards. At the end of the voyage the passengers acknowledge their attention by placing ill their hands a piece of money. At least I did so to the one who served me, and I think all the other passengers acted in a similar way. Up to about 1 oclock, or a little after noon, those who had been enjoying a walk began to disappear to prepare for luncheon. I was told, however, that two or three of the Indies were sea-sick, and would therefore be absent from the table.\n\nAs the evening neared and the night came on, the sea got somewhat rough. Just where I was sitting musing on the past, the present, and what I may have to pass through in the future, the captain,of the Lake Erie and the medical officer were walking arm in arm on the deck. Now and then they took a glance at me, as I did at them, as they passed. Captain F. Carey, to whom I have just referred, appeared to be a very smart gentleman, as also did the medical officer, Dr M. J. Johnson. The latter ^ave one the impression that we had a doctor in our midst on whom we could depend in limes of sickness.\n\nNow after supper it is getting near to ten oclock, and Miss Madge Rodgers is playing some fine pieces of music on the piano, a thing she often did to amuse the company.\n\nSaturday morning, 9th November, the wind was blowing strong from north-west, and at noon we had run 665 miles. The Lake Eric is a fine boat* slow but sure, giving accommodation of a comfortable nature to passengers, officers, crew, and all classes of servants employed on board. Seats and sheds on the deck were provided here and there, so that anyone could rest, read, or talk at pleasure, and many took advantage of the privilege. A rather large number of children were playing on the deck to-day, and my four grandchildren are among them, racing about in great glee. I heard one passenger say that the more slowly the boat went the better, so that enjoyment might be lengthened. It was understood, however, that she would take 12 days from Liverpool to Montreal, the opinions giving an opportunity to induce people to bet. No doubt, on the quiet, that was done, the sum staked being spent in the purchase of beer or something stronger, there being plenty of all sorts of drink for sale on board.\n\nAs the hours passed, it began to blow strong from about west, the sea appeared to rise more than it had done since leaving the land, now many miles to the east of us. In the evening stars began to twinkle, and the new moon made her appearance in the south-west sky. It was now getting near 11 oclock at night, when in other vessels carrying passengers I have seen too much drinking and quarrelling going on. Up to the present time I have pleasure in saying that there has been nothing but order and friendly greetings on board the Lake Erie since leaving Liverpool. The stewards and stewardesses have been most exemplary. I had conversation with the chief steward, Mr Taylor, to-day, who tells me that he has under his charge seventy-five stewards, stewardesses, cooks, and others. After he had listened to a small part of what I had experienced, he suggested, in great sincerity, that I should deliver a lecture on the Shetland Islands. I told him that I would think over the matter and let him know. He was so much in earnest, however, that before we bade each other good-night I said that if the captain and purser were agreeable to it, I would not object. Afterwards I was informed that I should get the use of the largest saloon in the steamer, and that either the captain or the purser would occupy the chair.\n\nSunday, 10th November.I slept well last night, and after breakfast I went on deck, and found that it was blowing strong from west. The sea had become rather boisterous, making the boat plunge a good deal, but she was keeping steady, and going at the rate of 12 knots an hour. Church service was conducted by the captain in one of the large saloons, commencing at 10.30 a.m. Immediately after breakfast I could see many dressed in Sunday attire, and the worship was conducted in accordance with the rules of the Church of England. A large number of ladies and gentlemen attended the service, and I think they all took part in the praise. The worship continued for an hour or more, and at the conclusion a collection was taken in aid of the Montreal Seamans Orphanage. I was informed that on the eastward voyage, the collection is taken in favour of the Liverpool Seamans Orphanage. A few of the young lady passengers were on their way to get married, which in conversation came to be known in course of time as the young ladies got acquainted with each other. Occasionally they were asked in a friendly way by young gentlemen to take a walk on the deck, and many a joke passed between them. In the evening a religious meeting was held in a saloon at 7.30, when a young lady presided at the piano, the captain being present, and there was a fair attendance. There were a good many children on board, and they had tables prepared for them at which they took their food an hour before the older people. It was a fine sight to see them all so beautifully dressed, attended to by stewardesses, as also to see them at their games in a room set apart for the purpose. A good many of the steerage passengers assembled on that part of the deck set apart for them, on this day appearing very happy, and I was told that they were mostly from Wales. I went to bed early and slept well, no doubt a good deal owing to the steady way the boat had been going during the time I was in dreamland. On the morning of 11th November, about an hour before breakfast, I went on deck, where I met two young ladies ready for a walk. Offering them both my arms, they accepted, and so an old man had an hour of enjoyment of conversation with a young lady in each arm, while at the same time he gave commendable pleasure to others, and that is what I think should be done in such circumstances. A black board was hung up in a prominent place, on which was marked the distance we ran every twenty-four hours. This was seen every day at 12 oclock noon, which helped to break the monotony often experienced in passing over a wide expanse of ocean, such as the Atlantic. At first I found the Lake Erie to be very similar to a large hotel, the passages being so numerous, the stairs at so many places, the saloons and smaller dining-rooms, berths, and other conveniences so difficult to find; but after a while I got to know the different windings and cross passages, but even to the end of the voyage I noticed that some of the passengers were at times a little bewildered.\n\nI had sometimes taken a rest in the smoking room, so to-day after dinner I went into it, and sat down in a quiet comer. The room is large and well furnished with comfortable upholstery seats, while small fixed tables are placed here and there, to be used by those who feel inclined to patronise the liquor seller, who was behind his bar close by.\n\nA good many gentlemen were present, some of them lounging lazily, others in small groups at tables having their beer or other kinds of drink, and occasionally a smoke, while at the same time various subjects were being discussed.\n\nOthers were playing games on the check er-board, the domino game not being overlooked. I was at times conversing with some one, but oftener jotting down my notes. This went on in the smoking room day after day without a quarrel, and at the end of the voyage a few who had formed friendships met in front of the bar to have a drink, and, with the shaking of hands, bid each other good-bye. Just as I was observing what was going on, and thinking of how to write down my notes, a messenger, about 8 p.m., interposed, informing me that a select company had been formed to spend an hour or two in conversation and music in one of the saloons, and he had been sent to ask me if I would join them, and I consented. But before leaving the smoking room, I think it right to say that the man who had charge of the sale of drink at the place mentioned was not allowed to commence selling it till 11 oclock in the forenoon, and I think that was a suitable hour, because by that time it would be understood that every one on board would have had their breakfast. Returning to the social meeting, I found that the company had a cheerful appearance, and that singing, aided by a lady presiding at the piano, was the principal part of the entertainment.\n\nI was asked to favour the company with a song, a request I fully expected,^although, taking into account my age of eighty-one years, I thought they might have let me off.\n\nI however endeavoured to let them hear my voice as best I could, singing in my old-fashioned style, and it seemed by the way it was received that I had not altogether lost the methodif ever I had itto please a few friends with a song. It turned out that before the conclusion of the different parts of the entertainment I had to sing another.\n\nOne of the amusements on board was staking a small sum as to the distance run every 24 hours, and the individual guessing the number of miles nearest would be the winnerthe sum, as I understood, to be spent in treating friends to a drink.\n\nShortly before midnight, the wind was blowing strong from about west, the sea getting up very fast, and inducing the sailors to see that everything oil deck was made secure in case the boat rolled or shipped heavy lumps of water.\n\nAll who can are now getting to their berths to sleep, but, heavy weather being expected, there is not the same cheerfulness among the passengers as usual. Some are talking about being half across the Atlantic, of getting nearer and nearer the eastern shore of America with west wind to smoothen the sea, and so on, while some of the passengers tattle and speak about other things.\n\nTuesday morning, 12th November, the wind is still blowing from the west, but not so strong as it was last night. The sea is also down, and the passengers look cheerful with the exception of a few ladies who are sea-sick. There are some fowls resembling gulls flying about the steamer. After breakfast I took a walk arm in arm with a Mr Froud, a young gentleman from the south of England on his way to British Columbia to purchase land to clear and form a homestead. He has a brother and sister along with him. They got acquainted with my .daughter, Mrs W. J. Manson, when she along with her children were spending a few months in England. Now they are looking forward to the time when their parents, also a brother and sister, may join them, and so form a new home. About midday we were enveloped in a thick fog, so that the steam whistle had to be often used in order to avoid colliding with other vessels; but strange to say, notwithstanding the great amount of shipping on the Atlantic, up to this time we have not sighted either a steamer or a sailing vessel since leaving the coast of Ireland.\n\nA number of steerage passengers were on deck to-day amusing themselves by means of various kinds of sports, and their children at times danced with ioy, using their skipping ropes to give them still more pleasure, little thinking that they were on their way to heavy toil, some of it likely to be the cutting down of trees in clearing land for cultivation.\n\nThe chief steward, being aware that it was pretty well known in the steamer that I had delivered a lecture on Shetland in Edinburgh and other towns in Scotland, thought that, in accordance with our previous talk on the subject, I should deliver the same lecture in one of the saloons. As the captain and other officers were agreeable to it, I arranged to give it on this day at 7.30 p.m. Accordingly the chief steward put up a notice in a conspicuous place so that all the passengers might know that the lecture would be delivered, and it being something new to be talked about, it was in that way well advertised.\n\nWhile slowly walking on the deck, pondering in my mind some things in connection with the lecture, I could see that many eyes were turned towards me, and I had therefore to withdraw to a quiet corner for a while to look over notes in connection with the lecture. I was informed by two or three parties that there would be a good many people present to listen to what I had got to say, and so it turned out to be. The saloon, which was more like a hall than a room, was filled with richly dressed people. As I took my place at the head of a long table, Mr Carruthers, the purser, came forward to take the chair, the captain having to be on special duty on account of foggy weather. The usual respectful salute greeted me and my chairman as we took our respective places. The audience were evidently quite pleased, for the delivery of the lecture would be a change from the ordinary routine of a voyage on the ocean.\n\nThe chairman in introducing me told the people that I had been a member of the County Council of Shetland for fifteen years, and that the subject of my lecture was such that he had no doubt it would give satisfaction. I took nearly two hours to deliver the lecture, even after curtailing more than I cared to do, and at the conclusion, the chairman rose to propose a vote of thanks to me, at the same time expressing his appreciation of what he had listened to. He said he felt sure that everyone present had been much pleased. The proposal was responded to heartily, and, after an enthusiastic expression of thanks had been awarded to the chairman, a very social meeting came to a close. I may mention here that Mr Taylor, who seconded a vote of thanks to me, said that he understood that I intended to return from British Columbia, and that, if I did so, he hoped that I would cross the Atlantic by the Lake Eric, and if possible bring friends with me of the same class as those accompanying me now, meaning my daughter and her four children.\n\nThe fact is, I had been accustomed to much travelling both at home and abroad, especially throughout the various towns in Scotland, and on meeting Mr Taylor, a Scotsman, we had got well acquainted, and therefore he appeared very glad to have the chance to express himself towards me in the friendly way he did. Although I was feeling the effects of bereavement very severely, I took good care not to show it, either when talking to an individual or to any assemblage. I have found long ago, that however much sorrow a man may experience, he should never when in public appear melancholy, because as a rule the world does not sympathise with people in trouble, and, more than that, I think undue serious reflection leads to disarrangement of the mind. Up to this stage, I have had to converse with men and women of almost every country under the sun, and yet only a small portion of the journey I have undertaken has been accomplished, and as far back as I can remember, notwithstanding adverse circumstances at times while connected with public affairs (some of them rather alarming and apt to bring me into much trouble), I have nevertheless always endeavoured to make myself as agreeable as possible when in company, and meet every body with a smile. Yes, I admire the words of the poet on the subject as follows:\n\nIf the skys by clouds oercast,\n\nAnd your feet grow weary,\n\nStill look onward, upward,\n\nStill be cheery.\n\nIf you are by care oppressed,\n\nAnd no help seems near thee,\n\nDo not be downcast,\n\nStill be cheery.\n\nIf the road be rough and steep,\n\nAnd the days be dreary,\n\nFace the world with sunny smile,\n\nStill be cheery.\n\nIn replying to the very kind remarks made by Mr Taylor and Mr Carruthers, I said that if, on my return to Scotland, I take a steamer for Liverpool, I would, if at all possible, be a passenger again on the Lake Erie, with the expectation of meeting the same officers and crew. I also referred to the excellent accommodation there was in the boat, not only as to berths and private conveniences, but as also how well the boat was fitted up and properly furnished with the most modern appliances for safety and comfort, including electric bells and electric lights, and servants ready to attend on a moments notice.\n\nI often went on deck to enjoy the fresh air, and to have a look at the wide waste of water which was at times wonderfully smooth, and to-day, while the steamer was keeping her course head a-wind, I began to think of my trip round the world long ago in sailing ships. When there was a head-wind, they often had to be put on the other tack, and the great commotion that took place among the passengers, when pots, pans, dishes, yea, even youngsters, and many things movable of a light nature would take a race to the other side of the ship.\n\nThe morning of Wednesday, 13th November, dawned, and the movements of the large vessel apprised me, as I lay in my berth, that the sea had got up. Oil getting to the breakfast table, I noticed that there were a few absentees. The wind had increased, raising the sea to such an extent that some of the passengers had become sea-sick, which accounted for their absence when the morning meal was placed on the table. Although the vessel kept rolling, some of the young people would venture on deck to have a walk in twos and threes. Ladies old and young tried this too, and there were several tumbles, inducing others to lose their gravity in laughter, but none would admit at the time that there was any injury done, such as bruises, until the following day when a lady confessed that she had been a little hurt by a fall on the deck the day before. A gentleman, who listened to my lecture, has just called on me, saying that a concert is to take place this evening, and that the purser would be glad if I would take the chair. I consented. A number of people assembled, songs were sung by ladies and also by gentlemen, a lady presided at the piano, and for two hours, during which time we had got about 30 miles nearer our destination, we had enjoyed English, Scotch, and Irish songs. All appeared to be pleased from time to time, as the different pieces were rendered, and the violin music was much appreciated.\n\nOne of the amusements at this time was the getting up of a Limerick, more especially for the purpose of giving pleasure to the ladies, and the words were poetically put together as follows by some one of the passengers or crew:\n\nA passenger on the Lake Erie,\n\nBoarded the boat bright and cheery\n\nBut when he saw pork on the end of his fork,\n\nThe fourth line had to be supplied by twenty ladies, each of whom had given a small sum of money to some one of the officers as treasurer, and after a gentleman, appointed as judge, had decided which line was the most suitable to complete the verse, the lady who was the author of that line was to receive the money. I was asked to be the judge, and reluctantly consented, because, as a rule, it is well understood that it is not easy to please the ladies.\n\nI was, however, told by one of the officers that my decision was received by all the ladies with satisfaction, and, strange to say, the winner was Miss Carrick, a young lady from England on her way to Canada to get married. She spoke to me afterwards, and was quite pleased of course, and said it would be something to speak about when meeting with her intended.\n\nWhen in conversation with passengers they came to know that I had visited Australia, and that I had written a book called A Journal of My Trip round the World, I came to learn that I could have sold many copies on board the boat. As midnight drew near all became quiet except the ponderous engines, the noise of which did not annoy, but in connection with the wind it created a kind of loud humming noise not at all disagreeable to the ear. During the day the sea had been somewhat lumpy, sending a spray now and again in over the deck.\n\nBetween 11 and 12 oclock noon of the 14th November I noticed the captain and the first officer, sextants in hand, standing close to each other on a certain part of the main deck about half way between the stem and stem of the vessel, looking at the sun as he appeared from under a cloud.\n\nThe sky was cloudy at the time, and therefore they had to watch their chance of seeing him. They applied their eyes to the proper place on the sextant at the very moment two or three times, and then both went to their respective rooms to make their calculations and compare notes, with a view to ascertaining the latitude we were in and the direction of Montreal. By another calculation they ascertained our longitude, and thereby learned the distance we had still to run.\n\nA short time after this there appeared on the board, to which I have referred, a run of 221 miles during the last 24 hours. We had advanced on our voyage 1787 miles. In the afternoon the wind became rather stormy, the sea began to appear like so many little hills breaking over each other, but the liner went through it with ease as if she were passing over big wreaths of snow. At the same time some of the passengers could steady each other in walking, and often one could hear the remark The Lake Erie is a fine boat. At the conclusion of the concert to which I have alluded, the captain was present for a while seemingly enjoying the music, recitations, and speeches, and, as it was got up to aid the Montreal Sailors Institute, a lady with a plate in her Hand took the contributions at the door of the saloon.\n\nNext morning, the 15th November, I got up in good time, as it was said we might see land during the day, always a welcome sight to those who travel by sea, and it was not long before we sighted Capo Clear, Newfoundland, which has a lighthouse on it. As we got nearer to the coast, many like myself strained their eyes and used their magnifying glasses to get a look of the land that some of us had never seen before. Those who had come to settle in this new country looked thoughtful as we passed from one prominent part of land to another along the Newfoundland coast, no doubt meditating as to what they might have to experience in the land of their adoption. I thought of the time when I used to sell tons of Newfoundland codfish in Scotland.\n\nBooks and maps for the passengers were plentiful in the steamer, and in a certain room there was a library where every opportunity was given to those who had an inclination to read to select a volume, and peruse it at leisure.\n\nBeing anxious to see the land, I was on deck early this morning, the 16th November, but the air was very cold, there being snow on the hills, as I could see, and we were going ahead very fast, being not far from the shore. The breakfast tables were at the proper hour always loaded with the best of food, there being porridge and milk for the first course, and so on ; what anyone preferred was brought by stewards ready to attend.\n\nAbout 3 oclock in the afternoon we passed Cape Ray, a very bold headland, where there is a fog-signal, and the principal headlands we passed were Cape Race, Cape Cod, Cape Pine, Cape St Mary, and Platte Point; Cape Ray I have mentioned. As we crossed the sea between Newfoundland and the mainland of America, I noticed some gentlemen very carefully taking notes of some sort, but I did not see anything very special demanding great attention.\n\nOn the afternoon of this day notice was given that a social meeting would be held in one of the saloons in the evening at 7.30, when anyone who might feel inclined could favour the company with a song. Mr Carruthers, the purser, and Mr Taylor, the chief steward, took a great interest in the matter, all with a view to keep the passengers in a cheerful mood. It was expected that voluntary performers, able and willing to sing, recite, and speechify, would not be wanting.\n\nThe meeting turned out to be quite a success, the saloon being filled from the beginning. The performances were excellent, one young lady after another presiding at the piano and giving the greatest satisfaction. So the entertainments in connection with a pleasant voyage came to a close.\n\nOil Sunday, 17th November, it was expected we would see land on entering the Gulf of St Lawrence. I got up early, and I found many others, having the same thought in their minds, had done so too. As we proceeded up this wonderful arm of the ocean, I looked in the direction where Canadian land would likely be seen, and I observed a lighthouse on the left. As time passed, houses and farms came in sight, studding the shore for many miles, the steamer going at the rate of 15 knots an hour. More farms and houses came into view, and now and again a mansion magnificently large and architecturally beautiful. I was told that a number of these smaller houses were occupied by fishermen ; but as this was Sunday no boats were seen on the water engaged in fishing. It was said that in a short time we would see a small steamer making for us having the pilot on board, who would take full charge of the Lake Erie, and bring her to Quebec.\n\nDivine service was conducted in the large saloon in the forenoon, the place being filled. Great attention was observable, and no doubt a feeling of thankfulness to the Giver of all good pervaded the minds of many. About 4 oclock in the evening, we passed the island Anticosti, when we were heading onwards at a great rate, and about 7 oclock the moon was shining in a clear sky, her beams, as it were, dancing on a slightly ruffled sea. As the night wore on, the cold became intense, inducing all the passengers to put on their overcoats and walk with quick step to keep themselves warm. At the same time the ladies secluded themselves in their respective berths, and so avoided the exposure to the cold air. A few ladies and gentlemen rested in a saloon where a lady was playing sacred music on the piano, occasionally singing as her fingers touched the notes, and others joining in, the meeting became a service of praise. A young lad dressed in regimental attire announced by bugle that the supper was ready. This method of notice was followed at the time of every meal, the lad having been appointed to fill this department.\n\nMonday morning, the 18th November, the weather is not so cold as it was yesterday. Two pilots have come on board; a large quantity of luggage owned by passengers leaving at Quebec is being taken out of the hold, the sea is smooth, the vessel is steaming at the rate of 15 miles an hour, and she is nearing the quarantine station named Rozile. About 12 noon I noticed a small steamer coming from that direction, and she soon became known to be the boat bringing the doctor, and, as she neared us, there was a rush to the side of the Lake Erie to see the stranger as he came on board to examine the emigrants. Immediately after stepping on deck, and shaking hands with some of the leading officials, he took his place at the entrance of that part of the liner where the emigrants had their berths. The opening was only so wide as to allow one person to come out at a time, thus giving him an opportunity to examine them one by one. I stood a few yards from where the process was going on, noticing carefully the men, women, and children as they made their appearance. I noticed that all the doctor did was to look at their eyes, and ask them to open their mouths. He tucked their chins, as I thought, pretty strongly, and took a good look at their tongues, as they shoved them out to be seen. Out of a large number of emigrants, only two or three were found to require re-examination, which after being done they passed. So the doctor left, and we stood on for Quebec. At the same time the thought amused me as I recalled how the doctor iiad tipped up the hats of the maidens and married women, and with his right hand had felt about their heads to make sure that they were free of disease.\n\nWe arrived at Quebec about 4 oclock in the afternoon, where I witnessed a tremendous commotion, as the big liner moved slowly to the side of the pier which extended a long way out in the river. A great many people rushed to that side of the deck next to the pier. A quantity of luggage was being landed by men and boys working like slaves, and some one was heard saying,  Much need for machinery here. While I was watching how the luggage was being tossed about, a gentleman tapped me on the shoulder, and said that the Dominion doctor wished to see me in a room close by. On appearing before him, I noticed that one of the officers of the vessel was sitting alongside of him, and, as the doctor looked up at me, he said, Mr Duncan, as a passenger, I see you are down in this list aged eighty-one. I am sure you dont look more than sixty. I thanked him for the compliment, and told him that nevertheless the figures were correct. He then said, Do you intend to reside in Canada, or are you a tourist? I replied, saying, I am a tourist; but it was on my tongue to add, If I find the Canadian people kind, and anxious that I should become a member of the Dominion Parliament, I might change my mind.\n\nI did not care, however, to make so free with a Government official in a strange land, but I was told afterwards that had I done so the doctor would have taken it as a good joke. In coming up the River St Lawrence to Quebec, my attention had been drawn to several objects of interest, some of them historical, but the ruins of the awful bridge collapse on 29th August 1903, when 60 men were killed, was specially pointed out to me. It was a sight I shall never forget.\n\nI was informed that apart from the loss of human life, the financial loss amounted to about one and a half million dollars. I looked hard and very thoughtfully at the wreckage, as it lay in a dreadfully confused heap under and above the water.\n\nOn getting under way for Montreal, we steamed up the river, getting a fine view of the grand scenery on and beyond the banks on each side, the most of it being beautifully laid out farms and handsome residences. As night came on, buoys could be seen on the water lighted up by electricity on the right and on the left, but in order to keep out of danger the anchor was let down, and a move was made to get up a service of song to commence at 8 oclock. Several of the passengers allowed their names to be put on the programme as willing to take part in the entertainment. The time for meeting was looked forward to with much\n\nEleasure. The weather was fine, the moon shining rightly, the air rather mild, thus giving every inducement for the people to walk on the deck. Nevertheless a goodly number attended the service of song, and a lady presided at the piano. . I was asked to take the chair. The large saloon was well filled with old and young, the songs were favourably received, and at the conclusion one of the passengers, a Mr Dunsmore, moved a vote of thanks to all the officers of the Lake Erie for the great kindness the passengers had received from them while crossing the- Atlantic Ocean. The motion was seconded and responded to with great enthusiasm, much being said in favour of all those employed on board the vessel, and a very happy meeting was brought to a close by singing the National Anthem. After this supper was served, then we had a walk on the deck. As parties met each other they talked about Montreal and the likelihood of being there to-morrow afternoon.\n\nTuesday, the 19th November, was enjoyable, the weather being fine. From about 11 oclock last night till near the time to take breakfast, the boat lay at anchor in mid-channel of the river, but shortly after that we M ere again proceeding up through this wonderful stream, which to look upon was more like a gulf of the ocean. Sure enough, however, we were now in fresh water, which was coming from the mountains and lakes of America. At some places the liver was much narrower than at others, but it often widened, forming openings like small bays. On each side, as we moved on, the scenery was still more beautiful, and I imagined would be even more beauteous in summer when the leaves of the trees are green, and the flowers and fields are in blossom. We arrived at Montreal at 4 p.m., where I witnessed an enormous quantity of luggage put on the wharf. Each passenger was expected to be present to claim his own, and the warehouse close by for accommodation formed an area of hundreds of square yards covered with people and goods of all sorts. In the midst of all this, a richly-dressed lady came to me, and said,  Sir, I wish to say that I was much pleased with what you said and sang, when you were in the chair at the concerts and service of song on the Lake Erie. While thanking her, we shook hands, and she left to proceed on a land journey.\n\nDuring this interview, I was at the same time endeavouring to keep close by my four grandchildren, while their mother was looking after our luggage. The trunks, numbering nine, along with packages of a lighter nature, were brought to one place. These had to be seen and examined by a Government official, and the nine large pieces of luggage made ready to be lifted to the station of the Canadian Pacific Railway.\n\nFrom that station, we had to commence our land journey of about 3000 miles across the continent of America to Vancouver City on the Pacific coast, and, as the train was not to leave till 10 minutes past 10 the following night, the next thing we had to do was to look out for an hotel, where we could put up. We were directed to the Queens, which we found to be suitable, the accommodation being excellent, but we had to pay accordingly.\n\nThe dining-room of the hotel was very large, measuring, as I imagined, about 60 feet long by 50 wide, covered with tables and chairs almost all occupied by ladies and gentlemen, attended to (as I saw at the time.\n\nI was there by waiters dressed up in the most modern style. In order to serve with punctuality, they were racing from one place to another, evidently willing to please all comers, because, as I was told, many came to dine who were strangers like ourselves, just for a day or two passing through the city.\n\nWhile dining, instrumental music was supplied, there being an orchestral gallery for musicians at one of the ends of the dining hall. As I experienced, the music proved to be a good appetiser.\n\nOn getting to this hotel, we were shown to our bedrooms, and so my first sleep in Montreal was on the 19th November 1907, and I enjoyed the refreshing rest.\n\nThe morning of Tuesday the 20th was fine, giving me a good impression of the weather at the west side of the Atlantic. But let me begin with the days proceedings. On opening my eyes, I found myself in a bed so large that it could easily have accommodated four people. The furnishings of the large room were superb and beautiful. The room was lighted up by electricity. There was a very neat arrangement supplied for telephoning, also a wardrobe, dressing table, a large square mirror, a very suitable easy chair constructed upon the most convenient spring principle, covered with velvet, and everything else required in a bedroom, such as a washstand and all the furnishings therewith. To give a full description of the hotel would fill pages of an ordinary sized book, but I may mention that the large building has a front entrance of a most imposing structure, inviting as it were visitors and guests to a hall as they enter. There are a number of seats on the left where any one frequenting the house can rest, read the newspapers, and converse with each other if so inclined.\n\nFronting the door, at about 20 feet distant, there is a counter about 15 feet long, at the back of which clerks are employed in connection with the business being done in the hotel. The most part of this consists in keeping an account of bedrooms occupied and unoccupied, and transacting money matters, such as giving receipts for payments, as also selling postage stamps, receiving letters to mail, giving instructions as to rooms into which luggage may be safely placed, and giving general information to enquirers.\n\nOn one side of the entrance hall, there is a room for ladies requiring to write letters, the paper, pens, and ink at their hands on the desks for their use, all free of charge. There was a similar room close by for gentlemen upon the same principle. From this same hall, near the counter to which I have referred, is a stair of white marble steps, leading to hundreds of bedrooms, all numbered. The different flats can also be reached by a hydraulic lift, which is moved up and down to accommodate all those who do not care to ascend and descend by means of steps. This connection is from the lowest floor to the top flat of the building, stopping as any one in the lift may require, free of charge. This is a great convenience for people having apartments in such a large hotel. I several times went up and down on it myself, and the guard was always careful as we came to the different floors to nicely steady the lift.\n\nAfter breakfast, and the day being favourable as to weather, I endeavoured to see as much of Montreal as time would allow me. One sight in particular surpassed all the others, and that was a view of the great city from the top of Mount Royal. From this very beautiful elevation I saw how the city was laid out, and how the flat, bright iron roofs of thousands of large massy buildings glanced with impressive effect, a sight which very vividly presents itself to my inner vision as I now write. During the few hours I had at disposal, I could only get a glance at the public buildings which lay in my way as I passed through some of the streets. The thought ot getting settled down in the train, which M as to be my home for five or six days, very much occupied my mind. I had therefore to hurry through, and, at the time mentioned, my daughter, her four children, and myself were in our places in a train said to be 1000 feet long. On getting to the railway carriage, I found it difficult to find my sleeping berth, but at last got fairly snugged down in a comfortable enclosure, furnished with sheets and blankets, also cushions and cover. These made a good bed in what is called a sleeping car, a number of which were provided for first-class passengers. In connection with this there was every necessary convenience, and a cooking stove for their use as well. The other part of the train, called the colonist, was not so well furnished, but the accommodation was fairly good. I may mention here that on each side of the sleeping cars, the seats were so constructed as to form beds at a certain hour at night, there being another tier of beds above the lower ones. These were fixed up in a way during the day so as not to be seen.\n\nBy this arrangement an aisle or walk from the one end of the train to the other is formed. There is one car fitted up as a dining-room, where any passenger can dine, but the charges are high, and over and above that, it is understood that when leaving the table after having breakfast, dinner, or supper, the individual served will place a small bit of money under one of the plates as a perquisite to the waiter.\n\nAt the commencement of the journey, each passenger was shown to his own special seat, wnich was numbered. Family groups and parties had seats fronting each other as required, with a table between, the leaf of which could fold down when not wanted. The passengers in these cars appeared to be very respectable, and we soon began to get acquainted with each other, so that the time did not lie so heavy on us as one would be inclined to imagine.\n\nThe first night in the train M as, as a matter of course, a little troublesome, but a very nice, obliging man as porter put all the passengers in their proper places, and, when the seats were made into beds, heavy brown coloured curtains were hung up in front of each every night, and taken down in the morning.\n\nOur heavy luggage had all been checked and put in the luggage car, but several packages such as valises had to be taken in our berths. As we noticed passengers going out at some of the stations at which the train stopped, we had to be careful to see that none of it was lifted. .\n\nAt such times I heard of nothing being lost except a watch belonging to a young lady, who entered the train as others were going out. Just before she sat down, she exclaimed, Oh, Ive lost my watch!\n\nAt the same moment I had been in the colonist car to see a passenger who had come with me in the Lake Erie. As I was shaking hands with him, I, having just been reading, was holding my glasses loosely in my left hand, when on a sudden I missed them. Although I searched about the floor of the car, they were not to be found. I was told afterwards that a suspicious looking man had just gone out as the train stopped, and it was thought that he had snatched my glasses and the ladys watch, for after searching over the floor again and other parts of the car, neither the watch nor the glasses could be found.\n\nI fortunately chanced to have another pair of glasses with me, otherwise I Mould have been very much put about by being prevented from writing, reading, and taking notes satisfactorily. The suspicious man, to whom I have referred, had been sitting in the colonist car, the fares being much less than those in the other; and as it happens at times that questionable characters take advantage of the low fares, there is some risk connected with that M ay of travelling. Apart from other danger, when asleep on a hard wooden seat one is apt to be robbed of his watch, or perhaps something more valuable.\n\nPeople travelling from Montreal to the Pacific coast have, from the one ocean to the other, an exceptional chance to increase their knowledge of the interior of America. In fact, to have been in Montreal or any other place merely on the coast, is almost not to have been in America at all. While proceeding west, a stop is made from time to time at stations on the railway, and, at some of them, a little while is given to passengers to look round to see a bit of the country at their leisure. At the same time, this is a privilege to any one who may be taking notes of what is worthy of observation.\n\nFrom the American millionaire down to the poorest class, human beings of all nationalities can be seen. Especially in the great expensive dining-car one can get a glance of the valuable jewellery and dress which decorate rich people. I did not visit that car often, but many did, the most of them, as I supposed, of what is called  the upper ten  in the Old Country. In talking to them, I felt quite at home, and some of them were fond of conversation.\n\nAs we were nearing the Rocky Mountains, many eyes Mere fixed on the high hills and deep valleys along which we were passingat last getting a view of snow-clad peaks of mountains high up in the air, along the sides of which ledge-like roads had been made for the rails. At some places the height above the train and the depth below were such as to fill the mind with fear and awe.\n\nAt places like that, we moved very slowly, and now and again, when looking out of the window of the cur,\n\nI could see the fore-end of the train in a serpentine-like form enter a tunnel, seeking, as it M ere, her way through hills and mountains, along zigzagged precipices and curves, with the greatest of caution exercised by the official in charge of the engine.\n\nThe same care was needful on the other side of the mountains when descending, the thought of which occupied my mind, and I have no doubt many others were experiencing the same feeling.\n\nThere being no concerts, such as we had on the steamer, the journey was sometimes wearisome, and there being no room for a walk, we had to keep our seats day after day. Of course, the scenery and stoppages to some extent broke the monotony. Passengers coming in at almost every station created considerable stir, they looking at us and we looking at them. There was no want of babies of many colours and shape to increase the matrimonial music. One day, when we were more than half across the continent, a gentleman was pressed to sing a Scotch song, because he was a Scotchman. When he had just commenced some one reminded him that it was Sunday, but he got out of his kind of embarrassment by informing his interrupter that the Scotch Sunday was past.\n\nSometimes we saw buffaloes, and at a station where the passengers had liberty to leave the train for a while, I came to a place where a man was playing with a black bear, just as one would play with a young dog. At times I thought that he was making too free with the animal, and we, the spectators, kept a respectful distance from the pair.\n\nWhen stopping at a station a few hundred miles from the Pacific coast, I noticed that some friends met each other with kisses, again and again embracing each other, leading me to imagine that they had been separated for years. It was quite apparent that with them affection and joy were mutual. As we arrived at another station, to remain for a short time, a young gentleman made his way in the sleeping car, asking for me. Who was this but one of my grandsons, Ernest Manson, whom I had never seen before, and who as a teacher had principal charge of a public school in the district. We clutched each others hands as father and son would do, feeling for a moment as if we were speechless. Then we began to talk, but alas! the time was short, notice being given that the train was about to start. So we had to part with the hope that we would soon see our way to meet again, and have more time to converse. At a stage farther on, where we had a few minutes to allow some passengers to go out and others to come in, two young ladies came in haste asking for me. One of them was my granddaughter Catherine Manson, from Nanaimo, Vancouver Island, who had visited Shetland lately, and a Miss Mercer, a grand-daughter of Mr William Manson, who had left Setter, Sandwick Parish, Shetland, many years ago, and settled in Nanaimo, British Columbia. The young ladies were teaching in schools not far from the station, and being aware that Mrs Manson, her four children, and myself were in the train, they had come to see us, and the meeting was very pleasant.\n\nThe lengthy and crowded train arrived at last at our destinationthe large flourishing Vancouver city and terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The time of our arrival was on Monday, the 25th November 1907, at 3 oclock in the afternoon. The time we had taken to cross the continent was 5 days 12 hours. My daughters husband, Mr W. J. Manson, who had come more than an hundred miles from the coast to meet us, was in the train, and on getting out he brought two vehicles, each drawn by two horses, to convey us and part of our luggage to his residence not far distant. A Chinaman, in his service as cook, had prepared a good dinner, which we all enjoyed. The house was situated in the suburbs of the city, surrounded with trees which skirted the border of a large garden studded with plants and flowers, some of them very beautiful. My first sleep in Vancouver City was in this house, a room having been prepared for me, most suitable in every way. My son-in-law, W. J. Manson, gave me a hearty welcome and asked me to make myself at home in his house. He placed for my use a valuable library, there being a large collection of books. A few days after this, my daughter, Mrs Laurence Manson, and her son, Douglas, arrived from Nanaimo, Vancouver Island, purposely to see me and ask me to accompany them to their home in that western part of British Columbia, where the great industry of coal-mining is carried on, and where her husband is largely connected with commerce as a general merchant. He is owner of houses and much land in the colony, and also has many investments.\n\nAfter a few days seeing through Vancouver City, we took the S.S. Joan for Nanaimo at 1.30 p.m. The weather was fine, the scenery all around most attractive, and to describe what I have seen of the place during the last few days, and what I now see on leaving it, would require the pen of a much more able observer and writer than I am. To think that during the last 20 years, the commercial city of Vancouver has risen so rapidly as to have public buildings, churches, stores, wharfs, and shipping, with a population of more than 80,000, and many more people pouring into it, is something wonderful. But such is the case, and houses are in demand more than the supply can meet, a thing which is encouraging trade in the way of building. Carpenters in particular are well employed, and that leads to employing men in other departments. The passage to Nanaimo was a very pleasant one, passing as we did a number of islands, some of them inhabited partly by Indians, who live by hunting and fishing, caring for nothing more than they can eat and drink. It so happened that a number of them of both sexes were on board, and I had a good look at them. Some of them M ere half-breeds, of whom I was told that there was a very large number at one time, arising from the fact that, in the early days of the colony of British Columbia, there were hundreds of strong white men who settled down in family life with Indian women.\n\nSome of the white men at that time, however, were coarse and wicked, never hesitating to draw aside Indian women from moral goodness, so that by disease of a foreign nature, small-pox included, hundreds of the women, not knowing what was the matter with them, rushed into the sea to be cured, as they thought. The result of this was often death, and in some cases decease was instantaneous. There are efforts made by the Canadian Government now in force to civilise and Christianise the Indians, but I have it from the lips of those who are engaged in the work, that in many cases it is almost impossible to get many of them to give up their savage mode of^ living. Although they somewhat withdraw from it for a time, the very least temptation draws them aside to their old customs.\n\nIt took the steamer about three hours to bring us to Nanaimo wharf, and there we were met by my son-in-law, Mr Laurence Manson, who had a carriage waiting for us. We drove to his residence, and I could scarcely believe that I was at last in my daughter Catherines house in British Columbia, and away from home in Shetland about 8000 miles. Though far advanced in years, sure enough it was a reality, and at this time, one by one, three of my grandchildren I had never seen, now grown up to manhood and womanhood, came forward to shake hands with me, while their father and mother stood by my side smiling.\n\nIt was a picturesque sight, and I may mention here that when in Vancouver City, my daughterMrs W. J. Mansonand I were taking a walk in one of the most fashionable streets, when she entered a large establishment in the drapery line to make a purchase. She asked me to wait at the door till she should come back. This I willingly did, and just as I was standing looking round at what I had never seen before, a tall young lady came out of the door, and, looking up in my face, said Grandpa, how are you? This young lady, taller than I, was Margaret Leisk, my grand-daughter, whom I had not seen from the time that she was an infant on her way in Glasgow, Scotland, to British Columbia, along with her mother and brother. Now she was in charge of one of the departments in this place of business, and my daughter had planned to ask her to go to the door and give me a surprise. This' she certainly did, as I would not have at first look recognised her as being a relative of mine.\n\nBeing on a public sidewalk, where there were so many people passing, I could not take the girl in my arms, and salute her as my feelings induced me to do, but I confess that I almost lost the controlling power while grasping the hand of her who was next to being my own daughter, especially I having come, as it were, from another world to see her. This meeting with one of my many grandchildren, and other near relatives I had to see in a country so far away from my native land, gives a good idea of the numerous friendly interviews I have had, not only with relatives, but with many others, some of whom came from a great distance to see me. I received invitations by letter from various individuals to call, some of them strangers to me, but who for many years had been reading my reports of news from Sandwick Parish in the Shetland Times newspaper. They apparently had a great desire to have a while of my company.\n\nI therefore visited many places and many people, it being a mutual pleasure to give and get news.\n\nAs Shetlanders are scattered over almost all parts of the world, many of them return from far away homes to visit their native land. But as I think very few, if any at all, at my age, namely 81 years; leave Shetland to travel over as I did more than 8000 miles to see relatives so far away. Before setting out, I began to wonder how I would be received by them in their homes. Well, I can with pleasure say in all truthfulness that during my travels, and that is not little, I have never experienced such kindness and\n\nhospitality as that which has been shown me in British Columbia, not only by kith and kin, but by others. One gentlemana relativesaid to me, when talking over the subject, My dear friend, you ought to be paid for coming so far to see us. I have received kindness in many places, but that surprised me much, and it just demonstrates the fact that there is a yearning desire on the part of not a few to see any one newly come from the Old Country.\n\nYes, several with whom I had conversation would willingly spend the money in order to get only a glimpse of the heather hills and pebbly beaches, on which they rambled in their young days, if they could only get away from business engagements and family cares. Often the question was put to me, What do you think of this country? As also I have been now and again asked, Are you going to remain in this country? But oh! the questions which have been put to me by Shetlanders are very numerous, and glad was I to answer when I was able in accordance with my knowledge. A few friends tried hard to persuade me to remain in this new country, where so many near and dear to me were residing in happy homes and in comfortable circumstances. I had, however, arranged in a way so as to be back to Shetland in November 1908, and could not think of departing from my resolution. After a while in British Columbia, becoming aware that I would have to go to Alaska to see my son there, I had to plan anew and communicate accordingly with my friends at home.\n\nBut I must now return to my surroundings in the house of my son-in-law, in the city of Nanaimo. I had been in the dining-room to replenish the  inner-man, there being a bountiful supply of different kinds of food on the table for the family group and myself. It was my own blame if I did not partake freely of the good things that were set before me. Indeed, I saw at a glance that along with my son-in-law, daughter, and grandchildren, I could make myself at home, and I did it in my old-fashioned, cheerful way. Many expressions of congratulation came from the hearts and lips of all present while the dinner was being enjoyed. One could easily see that the meeting was a mutually pleasurable enjoyment. After dinner, I took a rest in one of the easy chairs close by the fire which was blazing in a grate, the heat being more than I thought was safe. My mind and eyes were fairly well exercised, and one thing that specially attracted my attention was the gasalier hung from the ceiling, lighted by gas manufactured on the premises. Sometime after I was shown the simple process of producing ^as-light for their seven-roomed house, and a large store, cellars, and warehouse. It was explained to me that upon this principle the lighting up of the whole premises can be done much cheaper than by using gas from any other source.\n\nAfter having a look through the house, and the supper over, I was shown to my bedroom, and for the first time I slept on Vancouver Island, British Columbia.\n\nI had a sound refreshing sleep without disturbing dreams, but, on awakening, naturally enough I thought of old times and some of the steps I had taken in my long, wilderness journey. While musing on the past, the present, and what might happen in the future, someone tapped at my bedroom door. Who was this but my daughter Catherine, with a cup of tea and a fine biscuit, which she handed to me with a smile, wishing to know if I had slept well. My thoughts rushed back to the time when she was an infant in the arms of her mother, now in heaven, and to many of the associations therewith connected in our home at that time in Leith, Scotland. Well, 1 was left alone to enjoy my cup of tea, and meditate about more than home affairs. I was fully aware of the fact that I had set out on a journey I had resolved to carry through with a cheerful spirit, and that in all circumstances nothing should be allowed to interfere with my usual lively deportment, meet whom I may, be he clergyman or layman, merchantman or labouringman. Ladies and all should see that I had made up my mind to be happy, and endeavour to make others enjoy the same benefit, quite in accordance with the spirit of the poet who composed the following lines:\n\nSo we will sing and banish melancholy;\n\nTroubles may come, well do the best we can\n\nTo drive cares away, for grief it is a folly;\n\nPut your shoulder to the wheel is a motto for every man.\n\nAfter a short rest, I got up and put myself in trim for the breakfast table, where Mr Manson and the other members of the family were taking their seats. There I was asked to take the chair prepared for me, and to make myself at home. Now seated as a family group, there was no restriction as to putting and answering questions, and while the teeth were busy masticating the food, the tongues were well employed in conversation, especially about Shetland. As there are a good many Shetlanders in Nanaimo, some of them soon began to call in order to see me, and so my talking began in earnest, often resulting in several invitations to dine and spend an evening with them at their homes.\n\nAfter a while I got on the streets of the city, taking in my hand the silver-mounted walking-stick, with which I was presented as a token of respect by the people of Sandwick, Shetland, when I set out on this journey. I found that with this ornamental prop I was quite prepared, having such a weapon to defend myself against any attack which might be made on me by dogs, which the Indians keep in great numbers on their reserve in the neighbourhood. Just as in Vancouver City, the streets of Nanaimo are very broad, mostly laid out in such a way as to cross each other, so as to form rectangles. Some of the stores are very large, but a number of others are small, and almost all of them are constructed of wood. My son-in-law took me through his business premises one day^ showing me all the different kinds of goods he had in stock, and I think that, in accordance with the old saying, everything wanted  from a needle to an anchor1 was to be seen in that store. I was told that the value of the stock would be about £3000 sterling.\n\nMuch is sold to people who call at the store, but the business is mostly done by travellers calling on the customers every week soliciting orders. When made ready for delivery, the goods are put in waggons drawn by horses. I noticed that Mr Manson keeps three fine ones, w hich are also used for a carriage. In this way customers are regularly supplied with goods, the waggons taking them to their places of residence. This is a great convenience, and I was led to understand that mostly all the other merchants in Nanaimo act upon the same principle. There are some very fine houses in the city, and also in the suburbs, and churches with their spires, school-houses, theatres, drinking saloons, hotels, halls, and a number of other public buildings of considerable size. Some of them are built of stone, others partly of bricks, but mostly all the structures, including the wharves, are constructed of wood, there being any quantity of that material obtainable in the district. Indeed, Vancouver Island is thickly wooded, some of the trees being about 300 feet high, and many of them 6 feet or more in diameter. Hundreds of families are now living in comfort on farms, which have been taken from the forest by their own labourmany of the trees I have described having been cut down and cleared away by them, principally by the older members of the households. Then in regard to roads, it is wonderful to think of the progress made in that way. There are hundreds of miles of broad, well-made highways and trails, constructed through forests. In order to see as much of bush life as possible, I travelled long distances, sometimes alone, but often with a guide.\n\nOne day as I was passing over a part of the road, where there was a forest on the one side and a farm on the other, I noticed a great number of cattle on a grassy field close by, and also swine of a big size eating grass. I said to my guide, But swine go loose like that?\" Oh, yes, he said, that farmer allows his pigs to suck his cows. I lifted up my arms in astonishment, and said, Surely not\"; but he declared that it as a fact, and I could not but believe him, because I knew him to be a member of a Christian church. I learned afterwards that as pigs sell to good advantage, they get all the buttermilk to drink along with other feeding stuff, but it is not often they get sweet milk. It was a very exceptional thing for a pig to be allowed to suck a cow.\n\nBut I asked him how it came to pass that the cow allowed the pig to suck her. He appeared not to know very well how that came about, out as calves are allowed to suck cows, we thought that perhaps the cow would accept the pig as a calf. As a rule, the cows are of a large size, and some of them produce a great quantity of milk, from which the cream is taken by a machine called a separator. At certain times this is sent to a creamery in the district, where the butter is made ready for the market.\n\nIt is the men who attend to the milking, and on one occasion I accompanied a milker and his assistant, who went to milk thirty cows. These were standing in a row separated from each other by wooden partitions, and all under a wrater-tight roof in a big warm building.\n\nThis I did for the purpose of seeing how the men acted in milking, as that kind of dairy work. is done by women in the Old Country. Carrying an iron pail, the milker entered the door of the building where the hind legs of the cows could be seen in a row, and, placing the iron pail at the side of one of the hind legs of the cow, he began to milk, and continued doing so for a few minutes. On a sudden she struck the pail with her foot, and the milk was lost. As it went, I said to myself, There is loss in dairying as well as in buying and selling, as I know by experience. I said to the milker, That is a loss ; perhaps the cow does not want me here. Ah, he said, she has a prank of doing that, but there is plenty more in her big bag. So he righted the pail and commenced to milk again. I left him to finish the work he had commenced, but I thought the milking was a thing more suitable for women. But perhaps where there are such a large number of cows, more women would have to be employed than two, and my view of the matter that the milking should be done by women may arise from prejudice, I never having seen it done by men before.\n\nHaving received a letter from my son-in-law in Vancouver City, asking me to spend Christmas evening in his house along with a few friends, I took steamer leaving Nanaimo on the 25th December 1907, at 7 a.m. There were a number of passengers, no doubt many of them going, as I was, to the big city to enjoy Christmas with their friends, and, as the people in a new country very soon get acquainted with each other, I began to meet gentlemen fond of conversation, so that the few hours steaming across this part of the Gulf of Georgia was pleasurable. The sea being smooth, there was no one annoyed with sea-sickness.\n\nAs we neared the wharf at Vancouver City, I noticed Mr Fred Froud, who came from Liverpool in the Lake Erie when I came, waiting to accompany me to Mr Mansons residence. He (Mr Froud) was one of the party who were to be at the Christmas festival.\n\nA good many ladies and gentlemen were invited to this entertainment, some of them of political distinction. This no doubt arose from the fact that Mr Manson, the host, is a member of the Provincial Parliament of British Columbia. I may mention here that all the members of that body are paid for their services, and are allowed to travel on several lines of railway in Canada free of charge. When we were all seated at the festive table, it formed a very friendly appearance, and my daughter and her husband seemed quite pleased to have so many guests to welcome and entertain.\n\nWhile making remarks about things in general, we avoided talking on religious and political subjects, bringing to mind what a Shetland mechanic, who settled in Ireland, told me long ago, If you keep clear of arguing about religion and politics, you will get along in Ireland well enough.\" One course after another was placed on the table by the hands of a Chinaman, employed in the house principally as cook, but who might be called a general servant. It looked as if no one thought that strange but myself. I came to know, however, that it is no rare thing in British Columbia to have Chinamen in respectable houses to cook and serve at table. I must say that the one to whom I have referred knew his business exceedingly well, and I think I am a fairly good judge, because a great portion of my time in Scotland, and sometimes abroad, I have had to put up at hotels and sometimes in private houses, where great attention was given to the rules of etiquette. In course of conversation, much was said about Shetland, there being so many in the company from that far north part of the world. Although during my commercial career I had been absent from it for about twenty-five years, I nevertheless always did what I could during that time to further the welfare of the people of that country. Latterly, when again living among them,\n\nI had taken a great interest in getting some of their grievances redressed, especially during the fifteen years I represented the Division of Sand wick in the County Council. That being so, many questions were put to me about roads, piers, lighthouses, and the famous Hoswick Whale case, all with which I had much to do, and my answers appeared to give satisfaction.\n\nThen it came to my turn to ask questions about British Columbia, and there being gentlemen present quite capable of answering, I received much information, and that in connection with what I have seen of the country is very much in accordance with what I have read in a newspaper, Walker's WeeklyBritish Columbia is a land of magnificent opportunity. There is a prodigality of natural wealth everywhere, in the hills, in the fertile valleys, in the huge forests and the rivers, lakes, and ocean that washes its indented shores.\n\nFew sections can claim pre-eminence over the others in potential wealth. It will be many hundreds of years before the great province is fully developed, and at that time a better idea will be obtained as to which particular localities are the leaders.\n\nAfter a little while of conversation, we withdrew from the dining-room to the drawing-room, where innocent games were played. We had also singing, and music from the piano and violin. In this way a few hours were spent in a happy spirit both by old and young, a good many of the latter being present. Mr and M s Manson enlivened the company with their genial smile of welcome till a late hour, and after an enjoyable entertainment the guests left for their respective homes.\n\nThe people of Vancouver City are much given to fine ornamental dress and sociality, but especially on Christmas and other holidays. They turn out in great numbers to enjoy sight-seeing on the broad, beautiful streets, also in the public parks. They also engage in boating and bathing, which they do promiscuously, but of course, particularly well dressed for the occasion. It is no rare thing to see a gentleman at such times alongside a lady teaching her to swim. I noticed that on a certain holiday when on English Bay beach, and I made the remark to some one near, What an excellent thing it is to know how to swim when so many people are travelling by sea, even though it were to have no more knowledge than to be able to float for a few minutes in cases of accident on the water.\n\nThere are various sources of amusement for young people, but parents in general are very careful in keeping their children out of danger and questionable company, especially their daughters; and, if it so happens that anyone is assaulted or drawn aside so as to lose her character, woe betide the guilty destroyer. At any moment a bullet may pass through his skull, even at a time when he would least expect it. That may sometimes be done by a brother of the injured girl, or it may happen that the fiend as they call him may be mobbed and wounded.\n\nI often had the privilege of being in the company of leading public men, clergymen included, and I learned that strict measures are in force to preserve order and good discipline, so that the people of British Columbia shall be a blessing to themselves and to the world at large. Their great desire is that the children should be well educated, that family life be made sacred, and that anyone found disturbing the peace of a home or that of a community should be severely punished. The almost universal rule is that master and servants at meal-time sha1! sit at the same table, so that it often happens that a gentleman of an aristocratic family and his lady have their servants at table with them, a Chinaman being an exception to serve as a tablemaid would do. To show how little employers of labour think of rank, many of them prefer to be addressed by the name as it is found in the register of their births, than to be designated master, and that kind of brotherly feeling seems to predominate among the people of the colony.\n\nOn the 21st December 1907 I met Captain Thomas Halcrow, a native of Stove, Sand wick Parish, Shetland, whose ship was lying at a port on the Pacific coast. By rail and walking, he travelled many miles to see me, and as I met him unexpectedly, he said, Do you know me? I took a good look at him, and then said, O yes, you are Captain Thomas Halcrow from Stove, Shetland. For hours we enjoyed each others company, newsing principally about the people of the parish and the improvements made there in late years, especially the construction of the pier at Broonies Taing. Almost all the Shetlanders I met were interested in hearing about that pier, and when I told them that it and the boat-slip alongside of it had cost about £6000 sterling, they were perfectly amazed, wondering where the money had come from. Thus they bade me on several times to give them some particulars of how the scheme was proposed, and through all its stages how it was ultimately brought to a successful issue. I may mention here a part of what I told them. Some years previous to the constitution of the County Council of Shetland, a Government Commission had been appointed to inquire into the state of affairs existing in the Western Highlands and Islands of Scotland, of which the Shetland Islands, numbering about an hundred, are the most northern. On finding their way to Lerwick, the capital, they held meetings in the Sheriff Courtroom, to hear what representatives of districts in Shetland had to say in regard to grievances and the necessity for improvements, especially in connection with the development of the fishing. A meeting was held in my mission hall at Hoswick, when leading Sandwick parishioners discussed the state of affairs, and when I brought under their notice the great necessity for a pier at Broonies Taing. The late Mr Malcolm Goudie of the Linds with those present supported me in that suggestion, and I was appointed to bring the matter before the Commission at their first sitting. When my turn came to speak, I did my best to demonstrate the fact that for various reasons, it was of great importance to have a pier constructed at Broonies Taing, and of such dimensions as to allow large steamers to come alongside. I next gave a description of the site with an outline of the coast, the entrance to Hoswick Bay on the east side of which lay Broonies Taing, and, on concluding what I had got to say, I was thanked by the chairman for the clear and interesting way I had brought the matter under the knowledge of the Commissioners. I then began to write about the proposal in the Shetland Times newspaper, and, having been elected to represent the Sandwick Division of the County in the Shetland County Council, I from time to time brought the scheme up for discussion in the face of mucli opposition, until at last, after several years of pleading tlie case, it was taken up by others who came to my assistance. The leaders of these were Bailie Malcolm Smith of Leith, and Mr George R. Jamieson, merchant, Edinburgh, both being natives of Sandwick Parish. With the valuable assistance of the late John Bruce, Esq., of Sumburgh, who was Convener of the County Council, an application was made to Government, resulting in obtaining a Provisional Order. So from stage to stage of procedure, taking years from the start, the pier and boat-slip were constructed, and there are a number of herring fishing stations near, at which are employed hundreds of people. The successful issue of the undertaking has proved to be a great benefit to the community. There is a strong heavy parapet of concrete built on the most exposed side of the pier, in which is placed a tablet of dressed freestone, upon which is engraved my name along with others as trustees who acted with me as promoters of the scheme.\n\nI shall now turn my attention to British Columbia; and to begin with, I may mention that on one occasion I was invited to attend the examination of an Indian day school, the teacher a white gentleman who was also a missionary among the Indian people. The inspector of Indian missions was present, also his wife. The school building was constructed of wood, and very well seated, also a good platform at one end, where there was a writing desk and some chairs.\n\nThere was also a blackboard on the left-hand side of the teacher as he stood up at the desk. The scholars in front of him were "
