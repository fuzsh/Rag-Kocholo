        "text": "Update: A list current in May 2017 can be found here: https://digitize.library.ubc.ca/uncategorized/bc-historical-newspapers-update-2017/\n\nThe BC Historical Newspapers portal is one of our most heavily used digital collections. Occasionally we are delightfully surprised to find out about the creative ways people find to use the collections. Two of our favourite projects come to us courtesy of the great work by folks at Heritage Vancouver and the Revelstoke Museum & Archives: Heritage Vancouver used the Daily Building Record to locate previously missing 1912 Vancouver building permits for the Heritage Vancouver Society Building Permits Database Revelstoke Museum & Archives is using several BC Historical Newspapers titles in the history of snow and avalanche research for an upcoming exhibit. In the process, they are finding information on previously unknown avalanche events and will be adding them to the Canadian Avalanche Centre Database Have you used the BC Historical Newspapers for your own project? Let us know by leaving a comment below!\n\nNew in BC Historical Newspapers\n\nOver the past few months, DI staff have been quietly adding issues to the BC Historical Newspapers portal. Since the site first launched in November 2011 we have added 9 new titles in addition to completing the remaining partial runs of 9 of the original titles. In all we have added an additional 8000 issues consisting of over 42,000 pages of community newspapers, nearly matching the original 45,000 pages.\n\nAdditional Issues added Cumberland News 1897-1915 District Ledger (Fernie) Various other titles 1893-1919 Boundary Creek Times (Greenwood) 1896-1911 Ledge (Greenwood) 1906-1926 Moyie Leader 1898-1911 Economist (Nelson) 1897-1906 Miner (Nelson) 1890 (not 1891)-1898 Tribune (Nelson) 1892-1902 Daily Building Record (Vancouver) 1912-1914\n\nRecently added titles Anaconda News 1901-1905\n\nCoast News (Gibsons)\n\n(Courtesy of Sunshine Coast Museum and Archives)\n\n1945-1977, 1983-1989 Enderby Press & Walker’s Weekly (various other titles) 1909-1921 The Independent (Vancover) 1900-1903 Western Call (Vancouver) 1910-1916 Orchard City Record (Kelowna) 1908-1911 Nicola Valley News (Merritt) 1910-1916 Revelstoke Herald 1897-1905\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nA pilot project to move the digitized back issues of UBC’s student newspaper, the Ubyssey from its current home to the BC Historical Newspapers portal has been completed. Starting later this year, we will begin adding issues from 1918-2010. Thanks to the support from a very generous donor, we will also begin adding over 100 titles of early community newspapers in 2013-2014. Coming up:"
