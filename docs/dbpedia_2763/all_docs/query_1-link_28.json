Additionally, in 2010 and 2006 Heyerdahl won Leo Awards for Best Supporting Performance by a Male in a Dramatic Series for \"Sanctuary\" and Best Guest Performance by a Male in a Dramatic Series respectfully for his performance as Jan Van Der Heyden in \"The Collector.\"\n\nIn 2009, Heyerdahl was nominated for Best Supporting Performance by a Male in a Dramatic Series for \"Sanctuary- Revelations Part 2\" and a Gemini Award nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Guest Role in a Dramatic Series, also for \"Sanctuary.\"\n\nOn stage, Heyerdahl has a long list of theatre credits including \"Love's Labour's Lost\", \"The Changeling\" and \"Knight of the Burning Pestle\" at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, \"The Glace Bay Miners' Museum\", \"The Last Comedy\", and \"Savage Love\", to name a few.\n\nMost recently, Heyerdahl shot a leading role alongside Susan Sarandon, Donald Sutherland and Ellen Burstyn in the indie crime-drama \"The Calling,\" Gil Bellows in \"3 Days in Havana\" and Michael Eklund in \"Eadwaerd.\" Heyerdahl is internationally known for his dual roles of John Druitt and Bigfoot in SyFy's hit series \"Sanctuary\" and the mega hit \"Twilight\" franchise as the \"sensitive\" Volturi Leader Marcus.\n\nAdam Beach was born in Ashern, Manitoba, the son of Sally and Dennis Beach, and was raised on the Dog Creek First Nations Reserve, with his two brothers. A troubled childhood saw his mother killed by a drunk driver, and his alcoholic father drowned only weeks afterward. The three brothers went to live with their grandmother and then with their uncle and aunt in Winnipeg, where Adam joined drama classes and began acting in local theatre productions.\n\nSince then he has appeared in over 60 films and television programs. His performance in the Academy Award-nominated Clint Eastwood-directed Flags of Our Fathers (2006) was phenomenal. He played Ira Hayes, a Pima Native American who was one of the six US Marines to raise the American flag on Iwo Jima and who found the resulting fame hard to handle, subsequently giving way to alcoholism. This alone would have been an emotional role for Adam to play; however, during filming, both his grandmother and best friend passed away. His role as Hayes is both realistic and heartbreaking, earning him two Best Supporting Actor Award Nominations. He stands out well above the rest of the cast.\n\nAdam has been further nominated for three Awards for his role in Begrabt mein Herz am Wounded Knee (2007) including a Golden Globe. He has put in terrific performances in the comedy film Joe Dreck (2001) and the John Woo World War II war epic Windtalkers (2002) in which he co-starred with Nicolas Cage.\n\nHe headlined the cast in the Walt Disney production Squanto - Der große Krieger (1994), featured in John Singleton's Vier Brüder (2005) and starred with Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig in the science fiction-western smash hit Cowboys & Aliens (2011). He had a starring recurring role in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999) and Big Love (2006).\n\nIn 2016, he played Christopher Weiss / Slipknot in the supervillain film Suicide Squad (2016).\n\nAdam hopes to be appointed leader of his Lake Manitoba First Nation."
