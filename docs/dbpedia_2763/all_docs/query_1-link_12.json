        "meta_description": "The tug, SS Ymir was launched in 1899 at the Canadian Pacific Railway shipyard at Nelson on Lake Kootenay,  British  Columbia.    The  tug  was  the  first  built  for  CPR’s  barge  service  on  Kootenay  Lake.    It  was  designed  to  push  or  tow  railroad  car  barges,  some  carrying  as  many  as  15  loaded  rail  cars,  between  Nelson,  Procter,  and  Kootenay  Landing  in  southern  British  Columbia.  CPR  would  eventually  complete  a  rail  line  linking those points, but not before 1928. Ymir was a wooden-hulled, screw-driven tug of about 90 gross tons with the following dimensions:. 77.7 ft (23.7 m) long, 16.7 ft (5.1 m) beam, 6.5 ft (2m) hull depth, 27.3 hp steam engine. Ymir  does  not  have  a  colorful  history  involving  collisions,  being  frozen  in  ice,  fires,  or  other  mishaps.    Instead,  she  is  remembered  as  a  steady,  dependable  vessel  doing  its  part  during  the  hectic Klondike gold rush days  and  the  years  following.    She  was  retired  in  the  late  1920’s  after  CPR  completed  rail  service  around  Kootenay Lake. \n\t\n\tThe SS Ymir was built in 1898 in Nelson by J.M. Bulger for the CPR. It transported rail cars on the Nelson - Kootenay Landing barge run until 1909. After that, it was used as a relief vessel for newer more powerful tugboats. It burned in 1909 and was rebuilt and refitted in 1914 with more space for passengers. It relieved the Moyie on the Crawford Bay run from 1923 to 1929 when it was scuttled in front of the Nelson Shipyard. Today, the wreck is a popular dive site.\n\t\n\tIn the late 1800's the lake steamers accepted mail offered to them in much the same manner as those on the coast and with the exception of the S.S. Aberdeen, which was a recognized R.P.O., they rarely applied the ship's hand stamp to the letters or postcards. As the rail service provided by the Canadian Pacific Railway Lake and River Service and its subsidiaries expanded official Railway Post Offices were established and the transporting of mail by ship was transferred to land based R.P.O. routes. - this article was written by William Topping.\n\t\n\tLINK to a photo of - The tug SS Ymir on Kootenay Lake - <a href=\"https://search-bcarchives.royalbcmuseum.bc.ca/uploads/r/null/5/a/5ad1382338e520233c4886ff2436c91bb519218949f4b1722aea48dd447f90cb/a-00335_141.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">search-bcarchives.royalbcmuseum.bc.ca/uploads/r/null/5/a/...</a>\n\t\n\tWritten on the CPR S.S.
