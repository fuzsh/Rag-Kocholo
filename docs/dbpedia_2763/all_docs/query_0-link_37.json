The London Gazette of October 29, 1943 gave the following particulars: Flying Officer Trigg had rendered outstanding service on convoy escort and anti-submarine duties. He had completed his operational sorties and had invariably displayed skill and courage of a very high order. One day in August, 1943, he undertook, as captain and pilot, a patrol in a Liberator aircraft although he had not previously made any operational sorties in that type of aircraft. After a search of eight hours’ duration, a surfaced U-boat was sighted. F/O Trigg immediately prepared to attack. During the approach the aircraft received many hits from the submarine’s antiaircraft guns and burst into flames. F/O Trigg could have broken off the engagement and made a forced landing in the sea; but if he continued the attack every second spent in the air would dimish his chances of survival. There could have been no hesitation or doubt in his mind. In spite of the precarious condition of his aircraft, he maintained his course and executed a masterly and devastating attack. A short distance further on the Liberator dived into the sea with gallant captain and crew. The U-boat sank within 20 minutes and some of her crew were picked up later in a rubber dinghy that had broken loose from the Liberator. Trigg was the only one of the crew to be decorated. The V.C. was awarded due to the details provided by one of the German survivors of U468.

The citation reads – “One night in July 1943, Flying Officer Hall and Sergeant Goudy were captain and rear gunner respectively of an aircraft detailed to attack Cologne. When nearing the target area the bomber was intercepted by an enemy fighter but Flying Officer Hall evaded it. A few minutes later the aircraft was illuminated by a cone of searchlights and hit by anti-aircraft fire but Flying Officer Hall held to his course and pressed home his attack. Almost immediately the bomber was hit by gun fire from an enemy fighter and sustained severe damage. Skilful evading action enabled Flying Officer Hall to fly clear of the defenses and course was set for base. At the beginning of the action Sergeant Gaudy was seriously wounded, sustaining a fracture of the hip bone and pelvis, splinters of which pierced organs in his abdomen. In spite of this, Sergeant Gaudy refrained from informing his captain of his injuries until another Wounded comrade had received attention. During the return flight he remained constantly alert to the possibility of enemy interferences and gave reassuring replies to his captain’s repeated inquiries as to his welfare. On reaching the English coast morphia had to be administered to him as his pains from his injuries were unendurable.
