        "text": "“One must take the trouble to find out what is peculiar in each nation; and do it without being infected by its greed. One must stand apart, a devotee of none, but profoundly and honestly interested in all of them.”\n\nElias Canetti\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Columbia River and it tributaries drain the mountainous southeast corner of British Columbia, an area roughly the size of Nova Scotia or the state of Maine. This triangular region, of some 26,000 square miles, comprising the present East and West Kootenay districts plus the Boundary District, is closed off by the Rocky Mountains on the east and the Monashee Mountains on the west and north. Only to the south, along the international boundary, does the Kootenay-Boundary region lie open to easy entry up the river valleys which drain its mountain slopes. Within this great triangle, moated by the encircling Kootenay and Columbia Rivers, the space is wholly filled by closely spaced, north-south trending mountain ranges, from east to west the Selkirks, the Purcells, the Valhallas, and the Rossland and Boundary Ranges of the Monashees, with their intervening lakes and river valleys. It is a folded and crumpled landscape of high, forested mountains, and deep, narrow valleys with but very few riparian strips suitable for farming. With scant agricultural potential, and formidably difficult of access, except from the U.S., it has always been one of the hinterlands of British Columbia. Indeed, it should have remained as empty as the Omineca, but for one circumstance it contained rich deposits of valuable minerals.\n\nHad it not been for the presence of gold, silver, copper, and coal in quantity, costly mountain railways would never have been built into Kootenay-Boundary. Nor would the Americans have been interested in entering this isolated region to prospect and mine. Without the mineral wealth which brought the railways, there would have been no settlement at all, save for perhaps a few ranchers shipping cattle into the Spokane market.\n\nThe Mining Era on the Canadian Columbia, the period from 1854 until 1929, was largely American inspired, American financed and supplied. The mineral deposits of the Kootenay and Boundary Districts were close to the border, in some cases straddling it. They were relatively easy of access by American trails, roads, steamer routes, and railroads from the growing inland entrepot of Spokane. Capital to open and develop the mines was available in Spokane at a time when the coastal merchants of British Columbia had turned their backs on the Kootenays after two unfortunate experiences. For them it was a district too isolated behind its mountains, and too dominated by Spokane interests to make it a worthwhile risk for their capital.\n\nOnly when Canadian railroads and steamer lines penetrated this mountain-ringed fastness did Canadian and British investors enter to buy back its mining assets from the Americans who had been first on the scene.\n\nThe period of American incursion and the great mining boom left its mark on the Kootenay-Boundary. As the automobile era began in 1920, Interior British Columbians were driving on the right hand side of the road, as did the Americans, while motorists in Vancouver and Victoria drove on the left. Kootenay and Boundary families did their Christmas shopping in Spokane, a few hours away by train or down easy roads, rather than take the longer train trip to Vancouver. If an auto trip to the Coast was necessary, one crossed the border, and used the U.S. highways. There was no road connection at all between the Interior and the Coast until 1927.\n\nThe easy entry into Interior British Columbia from the U.S., and the commercial aggressiveness of the Americans had always been a matter of anxiety to British Columbia governments, both Colonial and Provincial. From the year the first group of Oregon-bound settlers laboured across the summit of the Blue Mountains in 1820 into the vast basin of the Columbia River, the Colonial officials of the British lands in the Northwest began to fear an American invasion and possible annexation. These armed and often unruly American settlers were steeped in the doctrines of Republicanism, self government, and, especially dangerous in the British view, “Manifest Destiny,” the assertion that Americans alone had some special, quasi-divine right to rule and enlighten the entire North American continent, from the North Pole to Panama, and from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific. In the mouths of their jingoistic politicians, “Manifest Destiny” became an incitement to military conquest, and a continuing nightmare to the rulers of British North America.\n\nHad the British reflected, they might have seen that “Manifest Destiny” was simply the American version of their own Imperial Doctrine, which held that the English, by virtue of their uniquely stable government, and supposed talent for wise rule, were favoured by God as the prime civilizers and most capable administrators of the globe.\n\nThe lands that became the Colony and later the Province of British Columbia never suffered the feared American invasion, but were subject to successive incursions of preponderant numbers of Americans with a single object in view the availability of gold, silver, and copper to the man who would dig it. These sudden rushes of armed and populist Americans across the line, mouthing the slogans of greed, and ruthless exploitation, changed the culture and customs of British Columbia. From a lethargic Crown Colony, with a British Naval Base, ruled and dominated by a single London trading corporation, autocratic, class bound, and unashamedly monopolistic, British Columbia was suddenly plunged into a wild, fast-profit mining economy. Its citizens, influenced by the get rich quick values of San Francisco, became fierce exploiters of the hinterlands, grasping for huge, unrepeatable profits in minerals, fish, timber and ranch lands. The province, for its first fifty years was a turbulent, unruly, scarcely governable region of unrestrained private plunder and official corruption, obsessed by a piratical fever to rush in, seize the resource, and get out swiftly with the gains.\n\nThe Colonial Governments were obliged to bend their laws, and even to recast them to accommodate wishes of the overwhelming number of American miners moving onto their soil. Imperial mining laws were revised to conform with those in the U.S. In all but one of the the rushes, Americans outnumbered British fifty to one, and were accustomed to making their own law as they had in California. The Colonials had to accede or risk a confrontation with a superior force. To the horror of the Colonial Office in London, coins were minted of miners’ gold in American denominations. American dollars were the universal medium of commercial exchange, only the Government and the Hudson’s Bay Company kept their accounts in pounds sterling. Further, as the merchants found their own bonanzas in provisioning the successive gold rushes, they actively catered to them, subsidizing ship passage for gold seekers, circulating handbills and advertisements in California and Oregon cities to solicit placer miners, and promising easy and well traveled routes to the gold fields. To accommodate the miners and the B.C. merchants’ efforts to supply them, the government built roads and trails to the mines, and an armed Gold Escort service was maintained to transport the miner’s bullion to the B.C. mint.\n\nThe scarcity of arable land and the severe disincentives put in the way of independent agricultural immigration by the Colonial Government prevented the Nineteenth Century province from developing a typically Canadian political base of independent farmers, stable and conservative. Instead, a wholly exploitive society of speculators evolved, not seeking land, but rather its plunderable resources. Miners, gamblers in their souls, later fishers, mining the coastal waters, ranchers, exploiting ever larger acreages of public grasslands, and lumbermen, stripping the mountains of their forests, created the buccaneer values of this isolated Province, values which still dominate its turbulent and murky politics.\n\nThe first Colonial Governors had apprehended an American attempt to seize their Colony by force, and discouraged by restrictive legislation, any American immigration which they feared might lead to annexation. The later Governors and Premiers sought to cash in on the gold rushes by advertising them in the manner of a World Fair. Miners, they learned with relief, seldom settled, and could be counted on to safely leave when the gold ran out. Meanwhile they could be provisioned at great profit. This continuing obsession with easy riches, with the high stakes gambles of mining, fishing, and lumbering, left an unacknowledged mark, a looter’s mark, on the consciousness of British Columbians.\n\nIn the great railway building era from 1896 until 1916, the Provincial politicians dangled railway charters with huge land grants to entice Americans and Canadians alike to build a railway network into the southeast of the Province to develop the mineral potential there. It became a somewhat cynical game, baiting with grants of cash and lands the American companies to build the lines which would force Canada’s reluctant national railway to extend its own competing tracks into the area. The always commercially aggressive Americans built quickly; the more deliberate Canadian Pacific was forced to respond with tracks of its own.\n\nIn the Kootenay-Boundary districts, the American incursion and the inauguration of the mining industry by American capital was chauvinistically forgotten as British and Canadian financiers after 1895 bought back the industry from the Americans, and with the exodus of U.S. mine owners, Kootenay-Boundary society became, for the first time, Canadian, only its distinctively U.S. architecture betraying its origin.\n\nThe mining era had brought in the costly railroads to move the ores out and coal and merchandise in. With the decline of mining, the presence of this rail network on the ground encouraged the development of a forest industry utilizing these easy export routes to U.S. markets. In a reversal of mining history, the major forest enterprises begun by Canadians in the 1920s were acquired by American firms in the 1950 – 1990 period. When, as is bound to happen, the profitable timber is gone and the American firms, like their mining companies, leave, the Kootenay- Boundary will likely become another Yukon, living on seasonal tourist catering, and romanticized versions of its past for the entertainment of visitors.\n\nIt was the exploitation of minerals, and nothing else, that brought the railways, the population, and supported the tiny pockets of agriculture in this sea of mountains. How that mining era began, flourished and declined, and the changes it wrought along the Columbia, the Kootenay and the Kettle Rivers is the subject of this work.\n\nChapter 1\n\nBEFORE THE EUROPEANS\n\nTHE GEOLOGY\n\nBritish Columbia’s attachment to Canada has always been tenuous. Not just politically and socially, but geographically as well. In the almost inconceivable reaches of geological time, some billion years ago, whatever continent existed in the western hemisphere of our globe split apart somewhere west of where the Rocky Mountains are now. In the Northwest, the split ran through what is now the extreme eastern parts of Washington State and British Columbia. Whatever land existed west of that split was rafted off on the fiery mantle of the globe as a tectonic plate, much as a lump of butter skids across a hot griddle. It is believed to have skidded off somewhere to the northwest, and probably became part of Siberia and northern China. We believe that because rocks in eastern Siberia and Northeast China exactly match the rocks of western Canada of the same age, while the present rocks of Washington, Oregon, and British Columbia are a total mismatch with the rest of North America.\n\nAfter the western continent lost its western portion in this way, the Pacific Ocean, or whatever ocean was out there, lapped at a broad coastal plain where the Rockies are now, probably looking similar to the Atlantic coastal plain of today. For about 800 million years nothing happened, at least nothing we know about. But roughly 200 million years ago, things began to move. The Atlantic Ocean opened, splitting the existing land mass into Europe and North America. The opening of the Atlantic Ocean created the continent of North America and pushed it westward. As the Atlantic Ocean opened, shoving North America west, the Pacific Ocean shrank, and old ocean floor was pushed down under the edge of the westward advancing continent.\n\nWhen ocean floors are driven down into the hot mantle of the earth, they melt. Ocean floors are composed of all the sand, gravel, and silt that eroded from the hills and mountains, ran down the rivers, and formed beds of sediment under the seas. Along with the sand, clay and silt were the minerals contained in the original mountains, ground fine by their long tumble to the ocean. When these old sea floors were shoved down into the mantle and melted, they were lighter than the surrounding rock since they contained water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. This lighter melt rose through the surrounding heavier rock as lava. The water it contained, at several thousand degrees Centigrade, dissolved the mineral grains, and carried them along with the rock to the surface in plumes of mineral-rich superheated liquid. This boiling soup of water and minerals cooled, and deposited those minerals in fractures of the surrounding rock.. If the surrounding rock were limestone, it acted as a sponge and soaked up the mineral soup. If it were impermeable granite, the minerals were laid down in thin veins. If the rising mineral bearing plume encountered a lake or swamp at the surface, it flattened out and spread as a horizontal bed of mineral enriched lake bottom sediment which, heated from below, slowly turned to stone. In time these new, mineral-rich rocks would be shoved up as mountains. And in time these mountains would in their turn be eroded away, and tumbled down the rivers to form new seabeds. Such beds would, in the fullness of geologic time, be shoved under another moving tectonic plate, and melted, recycling the minerals again into ascending columns of superheated water. The earth constantly recycles its constituents in this way, and will continue to do so. In distant time our junk-choked land fills will be worn away, tumbled into rivers, and the old bottles, tin cans, and wrecked cars distributed as tiny grains of mineral in sea floor sediments. And those grains will eventually be melted and dissolved to plume upward into the surface rocks to be mined all over again by whatever or whomever does the mining, some hundreds of million years from now.\n\nIn our area of B.C. and Washington, 200 million years ago, with the swallowing of old sea floors, the western coastal plain was crumpled up and forced against the continent. All its sedimentary rocks now form what is known as the Kootenay Arc, a tightly folded belt of limestone and sandy rocks that marks the former western edge of North America. Underneath, the molten ocean floor with its water and minerals rose toward the surface, forming volcanic vents and bulging up huge masses of granite lying below the old smashed up coastal plain. The great Nelson batholith which underlies most of the central Kootenay, was one of those rising bulges of old ocean crust.\n\nAs North America continued to be pushed westward across the globe it encountered whatever islands happened to be in the eastern Pacific at that time. Some were large islands on the order of the size of Japan or Borneo or New Zealand. The collision was very slow, a few inches a year, but the force was immense, so great that these small island continents welded themselves onto North America. The first was the Okanagan micro-continent which welded onto the Kootenay Arc some 100 million years ago. The melting of its basement rocks in the mantle formed a chain of volcanoes which erupted about 50 miles inland all along what are now the Okanagan Highlands and Monashee mountains. A new west coast was formed approximately down the line of the Okanagan Valley and the Columbia River into Oregon.\n\nFifty million years ago the Cascades micro-continent, was encountered and welded itself onto that Okanagan Coast. Its chain of Cascaded volcanoes, again about 50 miles from the new coast, are still occasionally active today. The next micro-continent to collide, is the present Vancouver Island, moving inexorably toward the mainland at 2 inches a year. Some millions of years onward, when it is welded onto us, it will have its own chain of volcanoes down its spine as well.\n\nIt is evident, that geologically considered, British Columbia does not belong to Canada, or even North America, at all. Our land is a collage of large, Pacific Islands, assembled haphazardly onto the continent by welds of once molten rock.\n\nTHE PEOPLE\n\nSpookily, our human history reflects the geological record. Isolated in deep and narrow valleys between the old volcano chains, human communication had always been difficult. The Aboriginals, living in their mountain-divided domains, developed some forty different dialects of seven main language groups, a greater diversity than in any other North American region, a mark of the isolation in which they developed.\n\nAnd we Ex-Europeans of the B. C. Interior today, dotted in small settlements along winding valleys remote from the centers of culture and power, exist, in some ways not unlike aboriginal societies, culturally self sufficient and socially self absorbed, almost as though these were the still wild Pacific Islands, uncertainly joined to an unknown continent. In the depth of winter, even today, with the mountain passes closed or rendered dangerous by snow and avalanches, we inhabit, in our tiny, fragmented colonies, the ancient Pacific night.\n\nAt the time of the first European contact with the Aboriginals, the best estimates are that there were perhaps 100,000 Indians living in what is now British Columbia, and perhaps another 100,000 in what now comprise Washington and Oregon. The more northerly forest peoples lived in mountain valleys and pockets of grasslands along the rivers. All these northern Indians subsisted on the plentiful salmon of the rivers and the game of the grasslands. Trails and river corridors permitted trade during the summers with the Indians of the Coast. Winter brought total isolation, and a dependence on stored food.\n\nSouth of approximately the 48th parallel of latitude, the dense fir and cedar forest gave way to open grassy plains of the semi-arid Columbia Plateau. The grasslands Indians living here had all acquired horses by the end of the Eighteenth Century. The horses of the Mexicans had been spread northwards by persistent Indian trading and theft, and a semi-nomadic horse culture, similar to that of the Great Plains east of the Rockies, was adopted by the Columbia Basin Indians. The ownership of horses allowed annual treks over the Rockies to kill buffalo, the meat being packed back on horses for winter food. North of the 48th parallel, only the Kootenay Indians had horses, as they had extensive grasslands in the East Kootenay to pasture them. Ownership of horses permitted much more trading and intercourse between bands, and the Salish language, with its many dialects, prevailed as the means of communication. By the time of the arrival of the Europeans, the grasslands Indians ranged over the entire Columbia – Snake Basin and were allied by marriage with their neighbours. North of 48 the Indians lived in isolated pockets of grassland, and only in summer were in communication with their neighbours. The forest trails and mountain passes were the summer links between the Kootenais and the Lakes (Sinixt) Indians, the Shuswaps and Okanagans. As well, the passes though the Bitterroot and southern Rocky Mountains linked the Kootenais with the Flatheads and were used each fall by the buffalo hunters coming and going.\n\nToday our annual auto trips, always dreading snow, across the succession of mountain passes to visit relatives in Calgary or Vancouver, or to consult some obdurate government bureau in Victoria, duplicate exactly the family treks of the Aboriginals two centuries before. In British Columbia, more than in any other province, our geography determines our customs, just as it always had those of the First Nations. Their borrowed horse culture made these trips possible for them; the automobile makes it possible for us. The Columbia Basin Indians counted their wealth in horses; we count ours in automobiles, and deface our homes with two and three car garages.\n\nChapter 2\n\nTHE EUROPEAN EXPLORERS\n\nThe Aboriginals first contact with the Europeans came in 1744 when the Spanish mariner, Juan Perez made a landfall on the Queen Charlotte Islands, and met the Haida who came out in canoes to trade. Spain claimed the entire Northwest under the Bull of Pope Alexander VI of 1493 which divided the New World lands between Spain and Portugal. It had come to the ears of the Spanish King, Carlos II, that the Russians had been sending out parties to begin a sea otter trade with the Aboriginals of Alaska. The Viceroy of Mexico was instructed to send out expeditions to establish a Spanish claim to the Northwest Coast, and seek for the supposed Strait of Ainan that was believed, on the basis of fictitious maps, to connect the Pacific Coast with Hudson’s Bay.\n\nPerez was sent north in the frigate, Santiago, from Monterey in Alta California in 1774, to sail north to latitude 60º north to investigate what other Europeans might be doing in those waters, to make contact with the natives, and on his return voyage to make “Acts of Possession” at suitable places. The voyage was only a partial success. Dangerous shoal waters, cold, and contrary winds, and sickness among the crew, were all reasons Perez gave on his return for failing to make a landing and turning around at latitude 55º N. The truth probably is that Perez was scared. The precipitous mountains, densely forested, descending to the shore, all empty of human habitation, the fjord-like inlets shrouded in perpetual fogs and beset with hazardous rocks daunted this seaman. To be cast away by misadventure on such an inhospitable shore would mean certain death by starvation to a European. His ship’s carpenters dismantled the wooden cross they had made with a message claiming the land for Spain, and Perez sailed for sunny California and home.\n\nBut on his way back, on the 18th of July, sailing past the Queen Charlotte Islands, he was sighted by the Haida Indians. Those aboard the Santiago saw a series of fires lighted along the coast to signal their presence as they sailed past. On the 20th large Haida canoes came out, almost as long as the tiny Santiago. The cautious Haida refused to come aboard the Santiago; the prudent Spaniards refused to go ashore. Some trade ensued with the sailors letting down knives and trinkets from the ship by rope, and pulling up furs and Chilkat blankets. They saw that one of the Indians had a harpoon with an iron head. This may have come from the Russians; alternatively, it may have come from Aboriginal Siberian ironworkers by repeated trades down the Alaska coast. Further south, at Nootka Sound, Perez encountered more natives, and these apparently came aboard his tiny ship, for in the lively trading, one of them lifted some silver spoons from Jose Martinez, the second officer.\n\nThe Spanish Viceroy was understandably dissatisfied with this timid expedition. He demoted Perez and sent the Santiago north again in 1775, commanded by Bruno Heceta, along with the even smaller (at 36 feet) Sonora under Bodega y Quadra. This was to overcome the mariners’ objection that all would perish should the Santago be wrecked on one of those hostile shores. Heceta was ordered to sail north to Latitude 65º and make the Act of Possession.\n\nBut Heceta, even more cautious than Perez, turned around at the southern tip of Vancouver Island and sailed back to Monterrey. Bodega y Quadra however, in Sonora, not larger than a Haida canoe, went as far north as 57º and there made the symbolic Act of Possession. That seemed to satisfy the Viceroy for the time being, since no more northern expeditions were sent out.\n\nThe British, too, had heard of Russian activities on the Northwest Coast, and of the secretive Spanish expeditions in that area. In 1776, the master mariner, Captain James Cook was sent out at his own insistence to explore this unknown Coast for the shadowy Straits of Ainan, which, if they existed, the Admiralty was determined, should be firmly held in British hands as an All British route to the Far East.\n\nCook, sailing around the Horn, came up through the South Pacific Islands to “discover” Hawaii, whose inhabitants, competent seafarers in their own right, thought they needed no “discovery” by anyone. Cook reached the Oregon Coast in March, 1778, but stormy weather prevented a landing. By 29 March he was in Nootka Sound, greeted by the Indians in their canoes, eager to trade, among other things, the same silver spoons purloined from Jose Martinez four years previous.\n\nUnlike the Spanish, Cook came ashore, sent his men into forest to cut spars and spare masts. He replenished the Resolution’s water casks and brewed spruce beer from the local spruce needles as a remedy against scurvy. Cook again sailed north at the end of April getting his ship into the Aleutian Islands and returning to Hawaii for the winter where he was killed in February 1779 in a skirmish with the locals.\n\nHis second in command, Charles Clerke, took over, and entered the Bering Sea, sailing north until he was blocked by ice. Clerke died of tuberculosis in August 1779, and Lieutenant Gore took over to sail the expedition south to Canton, where to their surprise, the crew discovered that the sea otter pelts they had traded for with the Indians, brought amazingly high prices. They sailed back to England with the news, which, like the Russians and the Spanish, the British tried to keep secret. But crew members let it out. John Ledyard, deserting to America published his account of the voyage in 1783, telling the world that “skins which did not cost the purchaser six pence sterling, sold in China for 100 dollars.”\n\nThe news that these bleak lands, as hostile as the Norwegian Fjords, would support a trade in furs to China more valuable than anyone had dreamed, brought the commercial world to the Northwest. For the next seventy years the Northwest, that dark and mythic land, would see a great commercial struggle for domination of its trade while distant governments fumbled toward a solution to its sovereignty.\n\nChapter 3\n\nTHE FUR TRADE INTERLUDE\n\nThe significance of the Fur Trade Era to later mining development on the Columbia was the establishment of the first permanent European settlements in the Northwest, and the improvement of the Aboriginals’ trails for use by pack stock, and on the Columbia Plateau by wagon. Not less important, the question of sovereignty was finally resolved, and a border was surveyed and monumented, dividing the Northwest into American territory and British.\n\nIn September, 1805, in an eerie coincidence, the Columbia drainage was being entered by two parties almost simultaneously. The Canadian fur traders, under Simon Fraser of the Northwest Company of Montreal, were entering through Howse Pass in the Rockies, while five hundred miles to the south, Lewis and Clark were crossing Lehmi Pass to enter the Salmon River watershed for the Americans. The Americans returned east the following year to report to their government, but the Northwesters under Fraser and James Thompson stayed, establishing year-round trading posts from Fort St James in the north to Kullyspell in Montana and Spokan House in present Washington.\n\nThe immense distances the furs had to be transported on mens’ backs across the Rockies and by canoe down the rivers and lakes to Lake Superior at Fort William, prompted the Canadian company to find an outlet to the Pacific where furs might be carried back to Montreal in ships and supplies sent out. In 1811, David Thompson, for the Northwest Company, set out to find that route to the Pacific. In June 1811, he left Kootenai House near lake Windermere on the Canadian Upper Columbia, and traveled south along the great Rocky Mountain Trench and the Kootenay River to where Jennings, Montana is today. From there the party took the Flathead Indian trail south to Saleesh House on the Clark Fork River. Spokan House was reached in a few days, and from there Thompson and his men took the Indian trail to Kettle Falls on the Columbia River. They paused there to build a boat, embarked and descended the Columbia to the Pacific. At the river’s mouth they found the fort of John Astor’s American Pacific Fur Company which had been established from the sea from New York.\n\nThe question of sovereignty was ticklish. The Europeans coveted land anywhere, aboriginally occupied or not. Spain claimed as far north as the Russian settlements at latitude 57º North. The British claimed on the basis of Captains Cook and Vancouver’s explorations of the coast and Lieutenant Boughton’s ascent of the Columbia as far as present Vancouver, Washington. The American expansionists cited the explorations of Lewis and Clark and the discovery of the mouth of the Columbia by the American Captain Gray.\n\nOn the ground, at Fort Astoria, the two parties, David Thompson for the Canadians, and David Stuart (also a Canadian in the employ of Astor) for the American company, being both practical men rather than political zealots, sensibly decided to cooperate and trade jointly.\n\nStuart moved up the Columbia with his men that year, trading as they went. They found the Indians well disposed and eager to trade. At the mouth of the Wenatchee River they traded one yard of calico and two yards of ribbon for four horses, and found Chief Sop eager to trade even more horses. Stuart founded Fort Okanogan two miles above the confluence of the Okanagan and Columbia rivers and left trader Ross there. With the rest of his men he ascended the Okanagan, and crossed over the low divide to the South Thompson. At the confluence of the north and south Thompson rivers he established a post, calling it Fort Kamloops. A few weeks later a party of Northwesters established their Fort Kamloops close nearby. Sending most of his party back to Astoria, Stuart and Montigny wintered at Kamloops, Ross at Okanagan. Trading was brisk and enormously profitable. In the 188 days Ross remained at Fort Okanagan, he took in 1550 beaver skins worth $12,000 at the Canton, China market at a cost in trade goods of $175. The Northwest fur trade, the Astorians discovered, was hugely profitable and worth a contest with the Northwest Company.\n\nDavid Thompson returned up the Columbia to the Snake River and ascended it to the mouth of the Palouse. From there he took the Indian trail to the Spokane River and turned west again to Kettle Falls, reaching it on August 28. Finan Mc Donald had been up the Columbia from Kettle Falls as far as present Revelstoke, but there was still that stretch of the river from the Illecillewat River to Boat Encampment to be explored. On September 2, Thompson, with 8 canoes of Sinixt Indians began the last leg of his journey. The first night the party camped somewhere above the site of present Northport, Washington . On the next day they got as far as Murphy Creek in B.C. On September 5 they camped at present Castlegar, getting as far as Deer Park the next day. On the 7th they entered Lower Arrow Lake, and paddled to a campsite somewhere below Edgewood. All of Thompson’s campsites were most probably the established camps of the Indians in his party. The Sinixt Indian families had long established summer fishing grounds and camps along the Arrow Lakes. September 8 the party camped in “the Narrows,” possibly Burton or Mosquito Creek. Thompson and his men entered Upper Arrow Lake on the next day and got as far as Halcyon. One the 10th they cleared the Upper Lake and camped somewhere along the river above Arrowhead. On the next day they reached the Illecillewat at present Revelstoke. The river above Revelstoke had rapids and white water, and their progress was slowed. Probably they lined the canoes through the worst of the water. They camped somewhere near Eight Mile Creek. On the 13th Thompson reported “a hard day,”making 12 miles, passing through Steamboat Rapids, and camping near Carnes Creek. The next day they passed Downie Creek at noon and then had to ascend or line through Death Rapids (Thompson says negotiating it with “care and safety”) where so many voyageurs and miners would be drowned in succeeding years. By September 18 they were back at Boat Encampment and Thompson made a short exploratory trip up the Canoe River to examine the country for its fur potential. Then it was time to head back on foot across the Rockies for supplies and trading goods.\n\nThe pragmatic cooperation between the Northwest Company men and Astor’s traders was destroyed the very next year by the news that the War of 1812 had broken out between the British and the Americans. With war, the men at Astoria felt threatened. The British had warships in the Pacific, the Americans none. British naval ships could blockade any American post, preventing furs from being shipped. If that happened,. the Astorians were ready to abandon the Fort, and try to take what furs they had back across the Rockies on foot.\n\nThe Northwest Company, taking advantage of the state of war, had sent out its ship the Isaac Todd, armed with cannon as a privateer, to sail around the Horn and capture Fort Astoria.\n\nAt the same time, the Northwester, John Stuart, came down the Columbia with 70 men to camp\n\nopposite Fort Astoria and wait for the Isaac Todd with her guns. With the Northwesters at their gates, and the Isaac Todd expected any week, the Astorians, most of whom were Canadians recruited from the Northwest Company, considered a third option. On the 16th of October, 1813, the men of the American Pacific Fur Company sold Fort Astoria with all of its furs and supplies to the Northwesters for $80,000 in credit notes. Most of its men then promptly joined their former employer, the Northwest Company. Astoria was promptly renamed, “Fort George,” and became a Northwest Company post.\n\nThis pragmatic solution was to be shortly undone by a glory-seeking British Navy Captain. Captain Black sailed his frigate, HMS Raccoon, into the mouth of the Columbia two weeks later to “capture” Fort Astoria. What he found was disappointing to a glory-hungry Naval Captain; a shabby log fort, already British, squatting in the mud at the edge of an impenetrable forest. “Why I could batter it down with my guns in two hours,” he wrote. Nevertheless, he came ashore with his marines, took formal possession in the King’s name, raised a flagpole, hoisted the Union Jack, fired a salute, and broke a bottle of wine against the pole. This was supposed to solemnize the occasion, but the thoughts of the thirsty\n\nNorthwesters as they saw the precious wine trickling into the mud could scarcely have been solemn.\n\nThis formal act of Captain Black converted a simple commercial transaction into a “seizure,” an “Act of War,” and was to have serious consequences. The Treaty of Ghent, which ended the War of 1812, provided for “Status quo ante;” all military conquests were to be returned to their original owners, and the Americans prodded by Jacob Astor, were insistent on having Astoria restored to them. Thus, the British lost the only post south of the Columbia, and with it, any claims to territory south of the river.\n\nTHE COMPANY WAR\n\nThe Northwest Company had been formed in Montreal in 1763 to take over the French Quebecers’ fur trade which had fallen into disarray after the French defeat at the Plains of Abraham. Its principals were Scots Jacobite noblemen obliged to flee their homeland after their defeat at the battle of Culloden in 1745. Many were Catholic; all bitterly hated the British. The rival London based Hudson’s Bay Company had a Royal Charter awarding it a monopoly on trade in all lands draining into Hudson’s Bay. The Northwesters had begun by moving legally into those areas south of the Height of Land where the HBC had no exclusive rights. Gradually, following the beaver, the Northwesters began to invade the territory the HBC considered it own, and set up rival posts. The HBC countered by sending its trappers south to the Missouri river and west to the Rockies, at that time claimed by Spain.\n\nThe HBC was a trading company on the model of the East India Company, caste-bound and exclusively British. Its traders had to be white, gentlemen, and of good family. All others, French, Metis, Iroquois, were the company’s indentured servants, and could never rise to the rank of Trader. The Northwesters, on the other hand, were a more egalitarian group, each one of whom was a shareholder in the company and partook of its profits. A young man, even one of mixed blood, could enter as a clerk and rise by diligence to the the rank of Trader. The Northwesters to a man hated the English, and by sharp trading, and physical harassment, tried to drive the HBC posts out of the areas they coveted. The HBC responded by encouraging the Aboriginals, who had some reason to resent the Northwester’s sharp trading practices, to raid their fur brigades and steal their furs, which the HBC would then buy. In the lands between Lake Superior and the Rockies a kind of post-Jacobite war between Scots and English continued, with no government in place to put a stop to it.\n\nWest of the Rockies was peace. This was Northwest Company’s preserve; the HBC had no posts on the Pacific Slope. The furs from “New Caledonia,” the lands north of the Thompson River, went out across Athabaska Pass over the Rockies, and by canoe down the rivers through HBC territory to Fort William on Lake Superior. From there, large boats carried them down the lakes to Montreal.\n\nFurs from “Columbia,” the lands south of the Thompson, went down the Columbia River to Fort George (Astoria) where they were loaded on the Isaac Todd. It was the Isaac Todd on one of her supply trips to Fort George that brought the first white woman to the Northwest. Jane Barnes was an adventurous barmaid from Portsmouth, England, seeking a well to do husband. In this endeavour, she shipped aboard one of the supply voyages of the Isaac Todd as the mistress of one of its officers. At Fort George, however, she found herself scorned by the Northwesters who found her pretensions to be a great lady simply because she was the only lady, ridiculous. The pragmatic Northwesters much preferred to take Indian wives who conferred valuable trading alliances to various tribes in the area. Finding the Fort George Scots more concerned with the trading advantages of a marriage than romance, the indignant Miss Barnes left Fort George with the Isaac Todd, to disembark in Hong Kong where she married a wealthy Englishman.\n\nThe Isaac Todd circled the globe on every voyage. Leaving Montreal with a cargo of provisions and trader’s goods, she called at Fort George to resupply the traders and take on the year’s harvest of furs. She then sailed to Hong Kong and Canton where the best and showiest furs could be traded for tea and porcelain ware. From China, the Isaac Todd sailed to England to disembark the remainder of her furs and take on a cargo of trade goods, a good deal of alcohol included. At Montreal she loaded up with provisions, potatoes, flour, dried cod,and set out again for Fort George.\n\nIn the Boundary Treaty of 1819, the Americans and the British, neither feeling strong enough to oust the other, agreed on a dual sovereignty for the Northwest, with citizens of both nations free to enter and to trade. The Aboriginals, essential parties to this trade, were not, of course, consulted. With this treaty the Spanish claims were settled. It fixed the northern boundary of Mexico from the Pacific to the Rockies at latitude 42º North, the present northern boundary of California, Nevada and Utah.\n\nThis anomalous situation of dual sovereignty with non interference in Aboriginal affairs continued without the shadow of a government presence by either country, and was broken only by rare visits of naval vessels along the coast, “showing the flag.” Peace was kept and a sort of rude order maintained by dialogs between the traders and the chiefs of the various Indian nations.\n\nTroubles erupted only along the coastline where the Northwest Company had no presence, and where American independent trading vessels (“The Bostons,” as the Indians called them) were guilty of depredations among the coastal Indians. Their practice was to demand that the Indians trade; if they refused, they were harassed and their villages burned under the cannon of the trading ships. From these abuses, a pervasive Indian hostility toward the “Boston Men” developed that was to last well into the mining era.\n\nEast of the Rockies, a virtual civil war between the two companies had developed, Scots against Englishmen, with the British under Lord Selkirk settling Scots farmers in the Red River Colony. As the Colony with its fort, blocked the Northwester’s supply route from Fort William, open warfare broke out. Lord Selkirk’s Colony was attacked, burnt and destroyed by the Northwesters. It was reoccupied and rebuilt by the Britishers, only to be sacked again. The Governor General of the Canadas was obliged to send in British troops to arrest the leaders on both sides. To compel peace, the Colonial Office in 1821 required the two companies to unite. The Northwest Company was folded into the HBC with each Northwester receiving one HBC share. The new HBC was then given official warrant to extend its operations to the Pacific.\n\nThe reason the HBC was selected to take over the Northwest Company was the British distrust of the Montreallers. The Colonial Office could see that in the Northwest, the sovereignty issue with the Americans was bound to come to a head. It felt that it was essential that a London company, wholly British controlled, should be the commercial entity in this contentious region. The Montreallers were not trusted by the British; they shipped their furs to New York, not London. Many of them had built mansions in New York with their profits, and all were on excellent terms with the Americans. It was feared in London that the Northwest Company might well, for commercial reasons, make common cause with the Americans and lose the Northwest to the Yankees. Therefore they had to be brought under direct British supervision. Whether this might have happened is unclear; the point was the British thought it might, and an alliance between disaffected Scots and Americans would be dangerous for all of Canada in the British view.\n\nThe augmented HBC chose George Simpson to be its Governor in Chief in North America. Simpson was a cold, harsh man, unpleasant in person, but a whirlwind of energy. He at once made a tour of the Northwest and instituted thoroughgoing changes. Some posts that had not been productive were closed, new ones in promising territory were opened, and a first program of agriculture begun. The posts were now to grow their own food and not depend on costly foodstuffs shipped out from Britain or Montreal on the Isaac Todd.\n\nIn the 1830s the American expansionists were clamoring for the annexation of the Oregon Territory, as they called the entire Northwest. Governor Simpson, along with his London masters, foresaw that in any division of territory, the lands south of the Columbia would most likely fall to the Americans. He therefore closed the indefensible Fort George (though returned to the Americans, Jacob Astor chose not to reopen it as a trading post, and the British had continued their trade out of an American post) on the south bank of the river, and founded a new headquarters for the Columbia Department at Fort Vancouver, 50 miles upstream and on the north bank, opposite the mouth of the Willamette. The Columbia Department was placed in charge of the Canadian born, former Northwester, Dr. John Mc Loughlin. Archibald Mc Donald took over at Fort Colvile on the upper Columbia where the Basin grasslands gave way to the northern forests. William Connolly was in charge of the New Caledonia Department at Fort St James. All these former Northwesters who liked to live well, had to be chivvied and verbally harassed by Governor Simpson to bring their establishments into line with the much more frugal and self sufficient style of the HBC.\n\nSimpson also had to deal with the American trappers who were now beginning to cross the Rockies and take furs from that same Northwest territory which was by agreement, open to both nations. Governor Simpson conceived the plan of trapping out the western slope of the Rockies, to render it bare of furs, thus discouraging American entry. To undertake this dangerous and ticklish task of trapping out the headwaters of the Snake River and the western slopes of the Rockies under the harassment of the Americans, Simpson chose wild Peter Ogden, a Northwester who had skipped west across the Rockies in 1821 to avoid a murder warrant. “That dangerous fellow, Ogden,” was sent on five successive expeditions to create a beaverless strip around the eastern and southern reaches of the Northwest. Such expeditions were not without great danger; the American trappers were encountered, and chose to believe the Northwest was American soil, regardless of international conventions. An uneasy hostility resulted, but both groups were restrained by the presence of superior numbers of Indians. In a pinch, the whites would stick together.\n\nSimpson’s scheme worked. After a few years the American fur traders were discouraged; the HBC bought their Fort Hall (near Pocotello) from them in 1837. However, a rush of land hungry settlers was something Governor Simpson had not counted on. Over the trails blazed by Peter Ogden and the American fur traders (“The Oregon Trail”), they came, to settle in the Willamette Valley, south of the Columbia. The HBC tried to counter this by sending out its own party of French Canadian settlers, company employees. But the French Canadians quickly had enough of the autocratic Governor Simpson and the class-conscious British. They threw in their lot with the Americans, and settled in the Willamette Valley, south of the Columbia.\n\nThe new American settlers at once petitioned their government to annex Oregon. Jingoist politicians in the East and Midwest took up the cry, and demanded all the lands up to the Russian line at 57º North. President Polk, elected on an expansionist platform, declared American title to the Northwest was “clear and unquestionable.” This stunning repudiation of the treaty of 1819 left the British thunderstruck. Negotiations over a division of the Northwest between the Americans and the British government began in 1846. The HBC had proposed in 1825 a line that ran down the Rockies from the 49th parallel, cut east through Missoula to headwaters of the Clearwater River, then down to the Snake and Columbia. In 1846 the British were willing to settle for less, a line along the 49th parallel to the Columbia River, and down the Columbia to the Pacific. This was reasonable; it placed all of the British occupied and administered area with Britain, and the American settled areas with the Americans. The Americans, however, insisted on a port on Puget Sound. They threatened war, and demanded the 49th parallel straight to the Pacific, cutting Vancouver Island in two.\n\nOn the ground the American position was weak. Their “war hawks” had dragged them that year into a war with Mexico. Their Army was then in Mexico, their navy in the Gulf of Mexico, while a British naval squadron cruised the North Pacific facing no opposition. Had the British stood firm, it is likely they would have got their border down the Columbia.\n\nHowever, the British Foreign Secretary at this time was a pacifist idealist, Lord Aberdeen, determined, like Neville Chamberlain a century later, to appease the belligerent Americans with territory he chose to believe was of no importance to Britain. Aberdeen got the Americans to draw their line around the southern tip of Vancouver Island and then gave them their boundary and everything north of the Columbia up to 49º north. The day the news that treaty was signed in Washington, the British Government fell. The supine Aberdeen was replaced by a spirited Palmerston who would have certainly gone to war rather than concede British occupied and administered territory. But the deed was done and a furious Governor Simpson, would have to live with it.\n\nWith the drawing of the line, the HBC moved its headquarters and depot to a new Fort Victoria on Vancouver Island. By the treaty the HBC was empowered to continue to operate its posts and to own land in the new Oregon Territory. The Fur Trade, however was diminishing., demand for beaver was down. In 1844, some Florentine hatters produced the first black silk top hat. It was an instant success. Silk hats were the fashion all over Europe, and the beaver hat became gradually obsolete. Vagaries in fashion, as well as politics, were determining the future of the Hudson’s Bay Company.\n\nBeginning with Governor Simpson’s decrees that each HBC post should become self sufficient in food, the company was now developing an agricultural enterprise. HBC produced grain, potatoes, dried salmon, cattle, horse, coal, and lumber. Simpson had noted the absence of refrigeration in San Francisco and beef rotting before it could be sold. With characteristic energy, he chartered a number of ships and sent them north to the Gulf of Alaska where the seamen chopped loads of ice from the glaciers and icebergs. The HBC sold this ice to San Francisco butchers.\n\nIn 1848 the HBC set up the first sawmill in Victoria to supply local needs. Captain Grant and others were beginning an export trade in Douglas Fir logs for spars and masts. The British Admiralty had tested a shipment of Douglas Fir in 1847 for naval use and found the new species superior to any available in Europe. In 1860 the Anderson Mill was set up at the head of Alberni Inlet, producing Douglas Fir lumber exclusively for export. In order to offset the $1 per thousand board feet duty the Americans imposed, the HBC, controlling all resources, lowered its royalty on timber accordingly to allow the Anderson mill to compete in the U.S. market. This would set the future pattern for the export oriented timber industry in British Columbia; to this day American import regulations determine timber royalties for the B.C. government.\n\nThese HBC products found eager markets in Hawaii, San Francisco, and with the new American settlements on Puget Sound. All this mercantile trade was kept as a monopoly by the HBC, however, under its amended charter of 1821. Actually, quite illegally, since the HBC monopoly by proclamation extended only to trade with the Aboriginals.\n\nWith all of Governor Simpson’s energy, and following him, the vigour and determination of Governor James Douglas, the HBC never quite fully converted itself to a mercantile establishment. Its traders and officials all felt themselves a kind of British Proconsuls charged with bringing orderly rule to a wild and distant land. Customers in want of supplies, might come to the HBC posts where their wants would be accommodated, but no HBC man would stoop to deliberately soliciting their trade; that was Yankee pushiness, and beneath the dignity of a Royally chartered institution.\n\nThe new government in Britain realized that the ambiguous situation of the lands north of the 49th parallel continued to make them vulnerable to the American doctrine of “Manifest Destiny” and the U.S. political expansionists. These lands were not politically organized parts of the empire, but merely British claims, “possessions.” Accordingly, in 1849, Vancouver Island, but not the mainland, was created a British Crown Colony. At the same time, so as not to make it a drain on the British Exchequer, it was granted entirely to the Hudson’s Bay Company on the condition that the company establish a settlement of British colonists. All the island land became HBC property to sell or lease. In this way the Empire gained a colony but left the expense of its maintenance and administration to a private corporation. It was a cheap solution, but ultimately unwise. In those first ten years of its existence, the Colony of Vancouver Island, poor and isolated, with its handful of HBC officers and servants, functioned in fact as a hinterland of San Francisco which was its principal commercial partner.\n\nAll that was to change in September, 1854. While Peter Ogden, that wildest and most intrepid of the Northwesters, lay dying in his Oregon home where he had deliberately retired out of British control, an HBC teamster, Joseph Morell and his companions at the Fort Colvile HBC post, found gold in the gravel bars along the Columbia River.\n\nChapter 4\n\nTHE ORIGINS OF WESTERN MINING\n\nAlthough a few of the Americans moving west in the 1840s had seen gold panning practiced along the the mountain streams of North Carolina and Georgia, it was the Mexicans who were the first miners in the west. A great silver rush began in Mexico in 1543, and in the next ten years more silver was produced than had been seized in the Spanish Conquest. Mexico had a school of mines from 1792, while up until 1849 the United States had not a single public assayer.\n\nIn the European monarchical tradition, gold and silver were “Royal Metals,” belonging to the Crown. Miners might be licensed to extract them, but the Crown would then take from them its “Royal Fifth.” This seizure was bitterly resented, and miners sought to evade it in whatever way they could. Within the settled parts of Mexico, a discovery of mineral had to be “denounced” to the local authorities, the equivalent of staking a claim. And from that moment the miners were subject to close supervision to ensure that the “Quinto,” or “Royal Fifth” did not escape the Crown. A wealthy or well connected mine owner might induce the authorities to look the other way by judicious bribery, but poor miners with no influence at the Vice Regal Court were subject to harassing exactions by local authorities as well as the forfeiture of the “Quinto.” They had but one recourse.\n\nThe Court of Spain had drawn the “Rim of Christendom” at the boundary of Arizona and New Mexico with Sonora and Chihuahua. The lands north of that line were declared to be “in partibus infidelorum,” the lands of the infidels. These lands were to be entered only with military escort to protect the traveler from hostile Aboriginals, and in the case of miners, to seize their “Quinto” for the Crown.\n\nTo evade these forfeitures, a system of clandestine mining in the frontier regions evolved.\n\nEach spring, quiet groups of Mexican miners would set out from their wintering places at Sonora or Chihuahua City to slip over the “Rim of Christendom” without escort, and once in the Indian lands, would hire Apache Indians as guides and interpreters to secure peaceful passage through the Aboriginal lands. These clandestine Mexican miners moved surreptitiously, avoided contact with the American fur trappers, and mined in total secrecy, closing their workings at the end of each season, so that others would not find them. Old Spanish/Mexican workings have been found in all of the Southwest states as far north as Utah and Wyoming.\n\nWhen the gold seekers of 1849 entered California they found the Mexicans already in place, washing the gold from the gravel bars of the Sierra. James Marshall is credited with the “discovery” of gold in California, but the clandestine Mexican miners had been quietly removing California gold for some time. The same was true in Colorado in the 1870s; the Mexican miners were already on the silver deposits when the Americans arrived, and were the only ones who knew how to extract silver bullion from its ores. The Americans learned their mining techniques from the Mexicans, but it was not in their nature to adopt the characteristic Mexican secrecy about their work. There was no “Quinto” in America; minerals found in the earth could be claimed in full by the man who dug them. In the absence of existing regulations, the California miners made their own “Miners Law,” establishing number and size of claims permitted each man, days of work — Sunday was sacrosanct — and the means whereby claims might be held, sold or leased.\n\nWhen the California miners heard the news of a gold strike in British Columbia and headed north, they were to cross, at the 49th Parallel, another rim, the “Rim of Republican Institutions,” and enter into a British possession, where the Monarchical Doctrine still held: gold and silver were “Royal Metals,” and belonged absolutely to the Crown.\n\nThe tiny Colony of Vancouver Island was then ruled by “Old Squaretoes,” Chief Factor James Douglas, of the Hudson’s Bay Company, which operated the only stores Governor Douglas permitted to exist. As well, he was Agent Manager for the Puget Sound Agricultural Company which operated the HBC farms and ranches. Further, as Land Agent for the HBC, he was the sole seller of lands in the Colony. The Colonial Office had sent out Richard Blanshard as Colonial Governor, but poor Blanshard had found that there was no Governor’s house for him; he had to board and room at the HBC post. As he was not an employee of the HBC he had to pay the full 300% markup on any purchased. As well, Governor Blanshard found he had no servants, no police, no judge, nothing whatever with which to set up an administration. After an ineffectual year in which he was barely tolerated by the HBC, and without a private fortune, he acknowledged defeat and went back to England. James Douglas, “Old Squaretoes,” was then named Governor by default. Thus, with all the economic power in the colony absolutely in his hands, Chief Factor Douglas now had all political power delivered to him as well. He ruled with a legislative council he had appointed, consisting of himself, John Tod, former HBC Chief Trader at Fort Kamloops, and Captain James Cooper who had begun farming with some Kanaka labourers brought from Hawaii. There was also a single immigrant in the colony, Captain Grant, who began farming outside Victoria.\n\nIt was tight little company Colony, 3000 miles from Hong Kong, the nearest British base, and 2000 miles from Canada over a wilderness which had only foot trails and canoe routes for communication. San Francisco was its market for hides, dried fish, potatoes and livestock, and the Colony functioned as an economic satellite of California, only politically British.\n\nThere was scant immigration. Governor Douglas, and the Colonial Office, fearing American annexation, if U.S. settlers poured in to set up their own government as they had in Oregon, framed the immigration rules specifically to keep out Americans. To discourage them, the price of land was set at £1 (appx. $5) per acre, with a minimum purchase of 20 acres. For every hundred acres purchased, the settler must bring with him at his own expense “five single men or three married couples” to work the land. It was a Squire and Tenant society that the Governor Douglas sought to reproduce in his colony, a little England. But at the same time, any English freedman could step across the 49th parallel, become naturalized as an American, and select land in Oregon or Washington for 25¢ per acre. And this was what many HBC employees, having completed their term of service, chose to do. There was no profit in freedmen farming Vancouver Island; the HBC’s Puget Sound Agricultural Company was furnishing all the local market could absorb; an independent farmer had no market unless he exported his produce to the U.S. or Hawaii.\n\nThe HBC indentured labourers on the Company’s farms and mills earned £17 per year (about $85), while the going rate for free labor was £70 ($350) per year. As a result, many of them deserted to the American Territories. The Colony was loosing as many immigrants as it gained; the immigration policy was a failure. “Old Squaretoes” apparently liked it that way. He was absolutely in charge, and was determined his Colony should stay as it was: British, orderly, and respectful of its betters. Only one factor could change that, the Americans, and Governor Douglas feared and hated them.\n\nGOLD\n\nTo the south, in California by 1850, were tens of thousands of restless miners whose claims were no longer yielding “an ounce a day,” the minimum deemed sufficient to support one man. They were beginning to filter north, seeking new gold fields. There had been reports of gold finds in the Queen Charlotte Islands, north of the Colony. On August 18, 1850, the unfortunate Governor Blanshard had written to Colonial Secretary, Earl Grey,\n\n“I have seen a very rich specimen of gold ore, said to have been brought by the Indians of Queen Charlotte’s Islands.”\n\nThe HBC officers at Fort Simpson had got hold of some California nuggets and had asked the Indians if they had seen anything similar. The Indians said that they had, and some weeks later an old Indian woman came in with a 21 ounce specimen of gold in quartz. The next year, following the Haida Indians’ directions, the HBC men found at Mitchell Harbour on the west coast of Moresby Island, a vein, 6 inches wide in quartz, striking northwest, parallel with the coast. The HBC men had come prepared with powder and chisels and blasted out the vein. But the Haida Indians, quite naturally supposing themselves to be the owners of the mineral, would rush in after each blast, pick up all the gold they could, and carry it off with cries of triumph. They defended their right to do so with drawn knives, and harassed the HBC men at their work. The handful of company men felt this work was proving to be too hazardous, and after sone days work, fearing bloodshed, they withdrew.\n\nHowever, the news of gold on the Queen Charlottes leaked out and in 1851 two ships set out from Puget sound with 60 American miners headed for the Queen Charlotte discovery.\n\nThe Queen Charlotte Islands were not part of the Vancouver Island Colony. They were claimed by the British and the HBC had the exclusive right to trade with the Haida who lived there, but beyond that, Douglas had no legal authority. The Puget Sound miners found small pockets of placer gold, but harassed by the warlike Haidas, and disappointed by their meagre takings, gave up.\n\nThe following year Governor Douglas learned that six ships had set sail from San Francisco with 500 men bound for the Queen Charlottes. He communicated his anxiety to the Colonial Secretary in London,\n\n“These vessels are chartered by large bodies of American adventurers, who are proceeding thither for the purpose of digging gold; and if they succeed in that object, it is said to be their intention to colonize the island, and establish an independent government, until by force or fraud, they become annexed to the U.S.”\n\nThe six ships were real and bound for the Charlottes, but any plan to colonize the island was most probably Governor Douglas’ hostile fantasy. Placer gold miners have very seldom been colonists. The Californians’ object was to find gold, to dig it, and to take it back to San Francisco to spend in high living. The idea that they might try to colonize a wilderness of islands where there was not a thing to buy with their gold, was absurd. Governor Douglas obviously wanted to exclude all foreigners from the gold fields, and he was angling with the Colonial Office for authority to do so.\n\nThe Colonial Office, not wishing to anger the Americans by excluding them, but concerned that some authority be placed over these nomadic miners, made “Old Squaretoes” Lieutenant Governor of all the British lands west of the Rockies, but it specifically required him to treat all nationals equally with the British. With this new authority, Governor Douglas hastily imported a set of Australian mining regulations and proclaimed them for the Queen Charlotte Islands. The doctrine of the “Royal Fifth” had lapsed in England, but precious metals were still the property of the Crown and could be mined only by licence from the Queen’s representative.\n\nThe Australian regulations now proclaimed for the Colony, the islands, and the mainland, required a miner to pay the government $3.00 per month for a license to mine gold, and claims could be no greater than 12 ft. by 12 ft., one to a man.\n\nTo further discourage the Americans, Governor Douglas recruited HBC men to go north at once, establish themselves on the vein and face down the Haidas. When the U.S. ships arrived they found the one vein of gold taken over by the HBC men, and unable to find any other deposits, they sailed for home, not bothering to put in at Victoria to pay their licence fees. The danger past, Governor Douglas and his tight little colony lapsed back into the accustomed somnolence of English colonial gentlemen.\n\nChapter 5\n\nGOLD ON THE COLUMBIA\n\nThe first report of a mineral occurrence in the Upper Columbia Basin was that of British naturalist, David Douglas. While accompanying an HBC trading party in 1825, he reached Kootenay Lake and either observed, or more likely was shown, the prominent outcrops of “chicamon rocks” by the local Indians. British Columbia historians have assumed that the Hudson’s Bay men had shown the local Indians how to break off chunks of the galena outcrop above the lake on the Riondel peninsula, and melt them in a fire to cast bullets for their muskets. It may have been that the Sinixt and Kootenay Indians had shown the HBC men. The fact that the Indians had mined galena from outcrops east of Northport, WA before they were “discovered” by American miners, suggests that it was the aboriginals, rather than the HBC men who began the mining of galena in a small way. All of these deposits of galena (lead sulfide), they called “Dead Medicine,” their term for musket balls.\n\nThe chief factor at Fort Colvile from 1833 – 1844 was the educated and energetic Archibald Mc Donald. Learning of the Kootenay Lake lead deposit from his men, he visited it personally in September, 1844 to determine its value. He drew a map of the location, collected a number of samples, and sent them down the river to Dr. John McLaughlin at Fort Vancouver to be forwarded to England for assay. In his letter to HBC Governor James Douglas, he describes the location.\n\n“The ore is picked up on the 2nd eminence of the Presque-Isle at “A”, about 100 feet high. There is something of a crater at top, and ‘tis from the debris or heaving up of old, covering the land side of the conical hill that the ore is found in loose lumps among the earth…I cut my initial in a large tree along side…”\n\nChief Factor McLoughlin forwarded the samples to Archibald Barclay, the Secretary of the Company, in London with his observations in a letter of November 23, 1844.\n\n“From a small portion of the metal tested here, a considerable quantity of very fine soft lead was obtained; but our mode of analysis was not sufficiently accurate to detect the traces of any more precious metal.\n\n“It is not probable that mining operations could be carried on to advantage at Flat Bow (Kootenay) Lake, the distance being about 600 miles from the sea coast, and the water navigation so difficult and dangerous that the metal would have to be transported with pack horses more than half the distance by land. The mine is also on the south side of the Columbia River, and will therefore, in all probability, eventually fall within the limits of the United States Territory, and, if the reported mineral wealth of that part of the country becomes known to the Americans, it will raise its value, and may become an additional motive with their Government to make good their claims.”\n\nSeveral things are clear from this letter. Mc Loughlin, if not Governor Simpson and the HBC, already accepted that the British would eventually have to cede the land south of the Columbia to the Americans. But as long as the status of dual sovereignty endured, it would be best to keep knowledge of any mineral deposits in the District of Columbia confidential, lest it arouse the cupidity of the Americans.\n\nA source of lead for musket balls was a significant find in the Northwest. All HBC lead was coming from England by ship, and a local source would be a source of considerable profit for the company. But the letter also indicates the impracticability of exploiting the deposit since the Bonnington Falls and rapids of the Lower Kootenay River blocked the usual HBC transport by bateaux, and a portage of about 30 miles by pack animals would be required around these obstructions.\n\nA discovery of lead might be kept confidential within the Company, but gold was a different matter. The news of the rich gold strikes in California was being discussed all over the Northwest in the 1850s. Dozens of HBC employees deserted to join the parties of men heading south for the California diggings. A few, still loyal to the company, or unwilling to leave their families and ranches in the Washington Territory, wondered. Was it worth heading south to join the rush, or might there be gold on the Columbia or its tributaries? The HBC posts in the Interior had been supplied with small sample of gold nuggets from the California diggings. These were shown to employees and Indians and the question asked: Had they ever seen anything like this? The possibility induced Fort Colvile teamster Joseph Morel, who was gathering driftwood on the shore of the Columbia in 1854, to experimentally wash out a few pans of gravel.\n\nIn the Northwest 1854 was one of those years when one era comes to a close and new one opens. In that year the fur trade in the Northwest was dwindling owing to a reduced demand for beaver pelts. The HBC was more and more turning to its farms, coal mines, and sawmills to try to develop a trade in flour, coal and lumber with the growing market of Americans to the south. Two events in the same month metaphorically signalled the change. On September 27, in Oregon City, that most intrepid of all the HBC fur traders, Peter Skene Ogden slowly slipped from life. In the same month, HBC teamster Joseph Morel and his fellows found placer gold in the gravel bars and rock crevices of the Columbia River near Ft. Colvile.\n\nPlacer gold consists of the particles and nuggets eroded out of the quartz ledges in the mountains by glacial and water erosion. They are carried downstream by any fast running current of water, but being heavier than sand or rock, are dropped to the bottom whenever the current slows down. What had been found in the California rivers in 1848 were the accumulated nuggets and grains of gold that had been caught in rock crevices on the bottoms of the river, and underneath gravel bars on the insweep of curves of the river where the water runs more slowly than on the outsweeps. This was what Morel and his fellow miners were looking for in the late summer of 1854 as they probed the rock crevices of the Columbia during low water and and dug into the gravel bars at the river bends.\n\nThe first few flakes of gold shining up from the HBC men’s pans were enormously and immediately consequential for the region. A gold strike could not be hidden, no matter what the HBC policy might be. Gold miners (the secretive Mexicans aside) cannot be silenced; they will pour out their take for the day on the saloon bar to impress their cronies. All that fall, excited men from Fort Colvile dug into the Columbia river bars, working slowly upstream. The treaty of 1846 had set the British – American boundary at the Forty-Ninth Parallel. Exactly where that line intersected the Columbia was a matter of guesswork. The crude instruments available to Colvile Chief Factor, Angus Mc Donald suggested that border would fall somewhere close to the confluence of the Pend Orielle and the Columbia, but a precise determination would have to await the arrival of the Boundary Commission surveyors. Meanwhile, a man named Walker, part Indian, found gold on the Pend Orielle, a large tributary of the Columbia. The swift running Pend Orielle, on joining the Columbia, slows down to the rate of the larger river, and drops its gold. Here the richest bars were found. Men digging these gravels were making $4 to $10 per day, better than a month’s wages for most. Two hundred ounces were taken from the Columbia that season. It was bought by Chief Factor Angus Mc Donald at Ft. Colvile for $12 per ounce. That autumn it was discreetly sent overland by pack train on the 1849 HBC trail to Ft. Hope, and on to Victoria the next year. As it turned out, the Pend Orielle diggings were a bare half mile inside British territory, and became the first mining entry into the Canadian portion of the Upper Columbia Basin. Just across the Columbia from these rich diggings and a quarter mile upstream, the HBC men began construction of a new post, Fort Shepherd, in 1856, on British soil, from which they hoped to control any commercial entry into the British Columbia.\n\nThe post was needed at once. The news was out: there was placer gold on the Upper Columbia. Men rushed north from Walla Walla and from the exhausted diggings in California, and in the spring of 1855 the first Colvile Gold Rush was underway. That year the Columbia, the Pend Orielle, and their tributaries were lined with men, almost all Americans, digging the gravels for the gold that lay along the bedrock. The mining era on the Upper Columbia had begun.\n\nBut this Columbia mining was being carried out by a largely American force, in an area chiefly served by American merchants whose merchandise came up the easy military wagon roads from Walla Walla and White Bluffs on the navigable Middle Columbia. The isolated HBC Fort Colvile (and after 1856, Ft. Shepherd), were linked to Victoria only by the old HBC Brigade trails over the rugged Cascades, one from Osoyoos Lake and the other from Kamloops. These were crude horse trails with no bridges, no easy switchback gradients, and dangerous in the extreme. The fur brigades and special expresses always took extra horses along; it was not uncommon to lose half their stock on the terrible mountain descents which were taken by the Indian packers straight down in a wild slide. Until some dependable, year round, link with the Coast could be established, the Columbia mines would remain largely an American operation.\n\nThe Pend Orielle diggings were located approximately where the boundary was believed to be located, as the river ran east from its mouth on the Columbia and no one possessed an instrument capable of accurately establishing latitude within a few hundred yards. However, in 1859, British Army Captain John Palliser’s “British North American Exploring Expedition” was making its way west into British Columbia with the intention of reuniting its scattered parties at HBC Fort Colvile. Captain Palliser himself came down the Kootenay River from Kootenay Lake to the Columbia. Traveling down river he stopped at Fort Shepherd where he was asked by the HBC men at the fort and the miners from the Pend Orielle to take an observation to determine definitively whether the Fort and the placer grounds were actually in British territory as supposed. Palliser took his observation and finding Fort Shepherd to be 3/4 of a mile ( 1.2 Km) within British Columbia, reported,\n\n“While I was observing, a circle of Scotchmen, Americans, and Indians, surrounded me, anxiously awaiting my decision as to whether the diggings were in American territory or not; strange to say, the Americans were quite as much pleased at my pronouncing in favour of Her Majesty, as the Scotchmen, and the Indians began cheering for King George.”\n\nGeorge III had been dead thirty-nine years, but was still fixed in the Indian imagination as their protector against the “Bostons.” The Americans’ gratification had much to do with the fact that many of the Pend Orielle miners were deserters from the U.S. army. The long tradition of the Kootenays as a refuge for disaffected Americans begins with the Pend Orielle miners in 1859.\n\nChapter 6\n\nTHE THOMPSON AND FRASER RUSH\n\nContrary to popular opinion which centres all B.C. history on the Europeans of the Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island, the Fraser River rush began with a discovery by an Indian on the Thompson River. Governor Douglas wrote to Colonial Secretary Labouchere in 1856,\n\n“Gold was first found by an Indian on the Thompson River 1 mile below the Nicomen. He is since dead. The Indian was taking a drink out of the river. Having no vessel he was quaffing from the stream when he perceived a shining pebble which he picked up and it proved to be gold. The whole tribe forthwith began to collect the glittering metal”\n\nWilliam Peon, the chief of the Fraser Band, set his people to work gathering the gold, and took $500 worth of flakes and nuggets he had found to Chief Trader Mc Lean at Ft. Kamloops. Mc Lean, a brutal man who hated Indians, refused to buy the gold declaring he had no means to weigh such small quantities. On his reporting the find, however, Governor Douglas ordered him to buy all gold brought in, and sent him a supply of long handled iron spoons to enable the Indians to extract the nuggets from the underwater crevices.\n\nChief Peon, on being rebuffed by Mc Lean, took the tribe’s gold to Ft. Colvile, in the Washington Territory, and presented it at the general store operated by Francis Wolff, a discharged American soldier, some miles southeast of the HBC post The fact that Chief Peon took his gold all the way to Colvile, an 800 mile round trip, rather than the 80 miles down the Fraser to the HBC post at Hope is instructive. Chief Peon had learned that the Americans, in this case, Wolff and his partner J. T. Demers, would pay more for gold than the stingy HBC’s $12 per ounce.\n\nThe Columbia and Pend Orielle placers were by that year nearing exhaustion and being sold to the industrious Chinese who would work patiently for another ten years. Wolff and Demers, excited by Chief Peon’s new find, recruited 18 prospective miners from their cronies, outfitted them with supplies from their store, and set out for the Thompson River country where Chief Peon had said he had found his gold. The party took the old Indian trail that led from Kettle Falls on the Columbia, up the Kettle River valley past Rock Creek. At the forks they continued up the West Kettle River to Kettle Bar, near what is now the Spruce Grove Cafe on the Monashee Highway. Crossing into the Shuswap drainage past Mc Intyre Lake, they descended Cherry Creek to the Shuswap River which led them to the Thompson and Ft.Kamloops. At least one other packer and another party of miners followed the same route, and were on the Thompson with Wolff and his men that year.\n\nThe Thompson River Indians opposed the American miners’ attempts to take over their placer grounds. Governor Douglas, who preferred that the mining be done by Indians, wanted no Americans at all on the Thompson. The danger of annexation exercised his mind. He “..admire(d) the wisdom and foresight of the Indians” and instructed Mc Lean at Kamloops to restrain the Indians (from violence) and discourage the Americans. More than this he could not do, as the British had set up no government at all for the mainland territory; no one had legal powers there. Wolff’s party persevered, and in the spring of 1858 Wolff was in The Dalles with $5,000 of gold he had recovered from the Thompson. Governor Douglas, for the HBC, had sent in February 800 ounces of gold to the San Francisco mint. The arrival of that gold spread the news in California and a rush began.2\n\nIn California, by 1858, the placer mines were nearly exhausted, and the miners, unable to make the “ounce a day” which was considered by them a decent return, were restless and bored. The stagnant situation at the Mother Lode mines was much as Mark Twain described in his The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calveras County. The men of ‘48 and ‘49 who had struck it rich had gone home to buy farms and businesses. The remainder who had drunk or gambled away their stakes, or never achieved much at all, were at the dead point of betting on frogs or how many flies would settle on a dead dog.\n\nWhen the news broke of the strike on the Thompson and Fraser, it generated wild excitement; here was a second chance for the unsuccessful and the improvident. The irrational “gold fever” struck at once. Newspapers reported a general exodus, stage coaches crowded with miners headed for the Fraser although the roads ran only to Chico and Red Bluff. Some went via San Francisco and chartered vessels for Victoria. Others hoping to avoid the British customs duties, chose the inland route. One paper recorded 250 miners bound for the Fraser on foot by the inland route passing through Oroville, California on the way north, moving at “… a perfect rush, whooping and yelling as they pass along the road…” A party of 500 French Crimean War veterans, mounted and armed, and divided into companies in military fashion, were on the road north via Shasta, Klamath Lake and Peter Ogden’s old route to The Dalles on the Columbia.\n\nIt could not have happened at a worse time for the Indians. During that summer Governor Stevens of the new Washington Territory had held a Council at Walla Walla where he had met with the Columbia Basin Chiefs, and maneuvered them into signing a series of treaties which ceded certain Indian lands to the government, and set aside certain large tracts as Indian homelands or reservations from which whites were barred. But even as the ink on the treaties dried, armed and bellicose miners, hurrying north from California and Oregon to join the Thompson rush, entered those lands now closed to them. They arrogantly dug up the creeks for gold, shot the Aborignals’ game, and abused the Indian women. Finding that the signing of the treaties was followed by even greater incursions and depredations than before, the Chiefs lost all trust in the promises of the whites, closed their lands, and prepared for war.\n\nA GOLD RUSH THROUGH A WAR\n\nInvading miners were shot by Indians in the Yakima Valley, and the U.S. troops sent to punish them were defeated by the Indians at Toppenish. Open warfare began. General Wool, commanding the army’s Department of the Pacific had issued an order in 1855 closing the lands east of the Cascades to white settlers,\n\n“No emigrants or other whites, except the Hudson (sic) Bay Company, or persons having ceded right from the Indians, will be permitted to settle or remain in the Indian country, or on land not ceded by treaty, confirmed by the Senate and approved by the President of the United States.\n\n“These orders are not, however, to apply to the miners engaged in collecting gold at the Colville mines. The miners will, however, be notified that should they interfere with the Indians, or their squaws, they will be punished or sent out of the country.”\n\nThe exemption of the miners probably had a shaky basis on remarks made in 1853 to General Alvord at the Dalles by the Chiefs of Yakimas, Cayuses, and Walla Wallas, that,\n\n“They always liked to have gentlemen, Hudson(sic) Bay Company men or officers of the army or engineers pass through their country, to whom they would extend every token of hospitality. They did not object to persons merely hunting, or those wearing swords, but they dreaded the approach of whites with ploughs, axes, and shovels in their hands.”\n\nThese chiefs of 1853 had never seen the bellicose California miners in full cry; they soon would. Possibly General Wool chose to identify the miners as “gentlemen.” From his post in San Francisco, he should have known better.\n\nIn 1858, with white settlement still forbidden, and the war in progress, The Dalles was the main outfitting centre for the inland route. It was reached from Portland and the Pacific by sternwheel steamer with a short portage at Cascade, and from inland California by trail from Shasta via Klamath Falls. At The Dalles, a regular “hurrah camp,” as Charles Frush called it, pack trains and wagon trains prepared to strike out into the largely unknown and now definitely hostile country of the Columbia Basin. To the end of May, 300 men were estimated to have passed through The Dalles headed north, and another 400 to 500 were fitting out for the trip. Bands of Cayuse and Nez Perce Indians had brought herds of horses, and were offering them for sale at The Dalles to the miners. Then the news came that Colonel Steptoe and his men had been defeated by the Indians in the Palouse country to the east. The army was attempting to quell the Indian hostilities that had begun with the depredations of the Columbia River rush in 1855; at the same time armed Californians were forming into bands at The Dalles, preparing to move into the Indian lands, even though a war was in progress.\n\nThe Indian’s changed attitude of 1858 was reported by a party of miners who encountered them at the mouth of the Yakima River. They were told that the important Indian chiefs had met, and decided that the soldiers and “Bostons” (Americans in the Chinook jargon, a trade language) should not pass, but that the French and the Hudson Bay men could. The years of cultivation of fair and friendly relations with the Aboriginals by the Hudson’s Bay Company and their French-Canadian employees were evident here, as were the outrages and sorry history of pillage and rape by the Americans, individualism’s dark side.\n\nWhile some of the miners turned back at the news of Col. Steptoe’s defeat, and the determination of the Indians to block them, most pressed on grouped in armed companies, usually with an Indian or an ex- HBC man as guide. The passage of the Mc Loughlin party to the Thompson was perhaps the most difficult.\n\nIt was led by David Mc Loughlin, son of Dr. John Mc Loughlin the former Chief Factor at Ft. Vancouver, 36 years of age, and one who had known the Columbia country intimately from his years with the HBC. The McLoughlin Brigade consisted of 150 to 185 men, with 400 horses and mules carrying provisions for three months. They had among them, 90 to 100 rifles and 20 to 25 other “heavy arms.” Most were from California and included Oregonians, Frenchmen, Metis, and “camp followers,” as in any quasi military expedition.\n\nThey left The Dalles on July 5, and reached Walulla, or old Fort Walla Walla, after several days march along the river. But even before reaching Walulla, stealthy Indians had managed to drive off some of their horses. This horse stealing by night had been a recognized practice among the Northwest tribes for more than a century. Horses would be stolen from the whites or from other Indians, and then sold back to their owners as a regular thing. Then, if possible, the horses would be stolen again, and again resold. Among the Indians it was a recognized honourable vocation, a means of acquiring wealth and prestige. The HBC custom was to mount guard on their horses at night, pursue any thieves, and insist on restitution which was generally forthcoming. The American fur traders had done the same. The miners, however, too intent on getting to the gold fields in the quickest possible time, seldom pursued thieves; rather they frequently shot any lone Indians as presumed thieves, violating the traditional ethics of the Aboriginal Northwest. Thus, for the Americans, once the miners entered the west, implacable Indian hostility would result, and the U.S. Army would have to be be called upon to quell the outraged Indians.\n\nOn July 13, the Mc Loughlin party left Walulla to head north on the old HBC trail David Mc Loughlin knew so well. They kept to the right bank of the Columbia, hired the local Indians to ferry them across the Snake river at its confluence with the Columbia, and continued along the shore to the White Bluffs landing. From there they took the HBC trail northeast to Scootenay Springs, and headed north, around the eastern nose of the Saddle Mountains to Moses Lake, a route that afforded grazing for the horses and mules.\n\nThe HBC trails were well marked, some miles of them still survive along the benches back of Okanagan Lake in British Columbia. The trails were about four feet wide, pounded into the ground by the hooves of thousands of horses and pack mules for half a century. Each trail had several diverging routes for use in different seasons. The fall and winter routes were the shortest, along the river and lakesides. The Spring and Summer routes had to avoid the soft, marshy ground and the swollen creek mouths carrying the runoff from the high mountains behind. They were located higher up on the gravel benches on dryer ground, and where the creeks afforded easier crossings. Crucially important were the grazing meadows. A Hudson Bay Fur Brigade of 400 or so horses and mules, could strip the forage from the grasslands in a single passage. Campsites and trail detours were therefore arranged to access the best and deepest meadows along the route. As well, springs that might be flowing in June and July, would frequently be dry by September, and detours would have to be made to permanent water sources for campsites.\n\nFor the Mc Laughlin party, the trail from Moses Lake struck across the plain to Soap Lake, the south entrance to the Grand Coulee. They followed the chain of lakes and marshes up the Coulee, being spied on by fifty Sinkiuse Indians under Qual- chan, hoping to give battle or steal the miner’s horses. The Indians found the Mc Loughlin party too large to attack, but followed, hoping for an opportunity to steal some horses. In the account they gave later on, the Indians observed one persistent straggler, a Mr. Hillburn, in the party, lagging behind the main body each day. They decided not to kill him hoping that if the party saw that one of their members could follow behind in safety, they would relax their vigilance. David Mc Loughlin, however, was too experienced to allow any slackening of discipline; the horses were well guarded, and the Indians gave up. As an expression of their frustration, before they turned away they crept up behind the party and shot the straggler at what is now Dead Man’s Spring, just south of present Coulee City. As it was determined by the Indians that Qual-chan’s bullet killed the Californian, he was entitled to the scalp, the man’s horse, and his equipment.\n\nWhile the Mc Louglin party made their way up the Grand Coulee, the chiefs of the Chelan, Sinkiuse and Okanogan Indians conferred and decided to join all their forces to do battle with the miners. They agreed to meet at the mouth of the Okanogan River to spy on the party and decide on a place to ambush it. The HBC trail climbed out of the Grand Coulee by Barker Canyon and led across the rolling tableland of the Columbia Plateau to Foster Creek and down to the Columbia a short way upstream from Fort Okanogan and the mouth of the Okanogan River. Here Chief Moses and his Indians met them in parley. Moses was in a vengeful mood since his brother Quil-ten-e-nock had been killed by miners turned back earlier that spring near the mouth of the Wenatchee River. He now chose to believe that the killers were in the Mc Loughlin party.\n\nA parley was held lasting all night with Mc Loughlin, the canny trader, offering to pay the Indians to ferry his men across the the river to the fort. Finally Moses agreed, but stipulated, that once across the river the miners would be subject to attack and killed.\n\nThe next day the miners were ferried over, while the packstock swam the Columbia, some few being swept away and seized by the Indians. Now in imminent danger, Mc Loughlin formed an advance and a rear guard of 25 heavily armed men each. The entire party stretched out for a mile on the HBC trail north. The Okanogan river flows through a narrow canyon between present Riverside and the rail siding of Janis. There, at the mouth of Tunk Creek, the Indians set up their ambush. They felled trees across the trail and piled up rocks for a breastworks on the bluffs above the river. Francis Wolff, who was in the party, recounts what happened,\n\n“We entered the mouth (of the canyon) with the guard in advance and had proceeded about 100 yards when one of the men noticed some wilted bushes and thinking strange of it went to examine them when the Indians behind it suspecting that we had noticed their ambush, fired. Then shots came from the sides and rear of us, evidently trying to drive us into the Canyon. Men threw themselves from their horses and those not killed or wounded retuned the fire.\n\nMy horse on which I had my cantenas (a money box) with $2000 gold dust … got away from me and ran up the canyon about 75 yards toward the Indians. I went for him, and got him and returned to our line.”\n\nThe miners were trapped by the Indians in the narrow canyon, and spent an anxious night. The Indians made an attempt to burn them out by setting fire to the grass and brush, but the miners made rafts and ferried their baggage across to the west bank of the river where they could climb the canyon wall and escape. The horses on the following day we led to a ford downriver and brought across, and the party proceeded for a couple of miles and camped. While some made litters for the five wounded, others returned to the canyon to find the Indian positions abandoned. They buried their three dead and returned to camp.\n\nOn the following day, the party made another ten miles north and camped, making a protective circle of packs around them. Again the Indians returned to try to stampede the horses, but only succeeded in running off a few. A parley with the war chiefs was held and Mc Loughlin arranged a kind of treaty. Tobacco, blankets and other gifts were given to the chiefs who promised no more shooting., and the party was given permission to pass. Still, the Chiefs could not promise to control some of their more eager warriors. The next night more shooting broke out, and the Indians made another attempt to drive off horses. Francis Wolff had arranged with his partner at Colville that a band of cattle would be driven over the Colville Trail to join the McLoughlin party at Osooyos Lake to supply meat for the miners. When they were but four miles from meeting, the Indians stampeded the cattle and drove them off. Miners of the Mc Loughlin party, testing the Similkameen River for gold, found some of the Indians drying meat from the stolen cattle and captured them. One, however, escaped and told the other Indians that the captives were to be hung. Another conflict seemed inevitable, when Chief Trader Angus Mac Donald, from Ft. Colvile, arrived with an HBC party, taking furs to Ft. Hope. Mac Donald had been told by the Indians that his party would be attacked and two “Bostons” killed if the captive Indians were not released. Again the Indians were specifically targeting the Americans in the party, not the French or British. It was the Americans who had been identified by the Sinkiuse as malefactors and murderers. American bad behaviour in the Washington Territory probably resulted from the large percentage of Mexican War veterans among them. In California, the Americans had only to intimidate the Indians there who had been demoralized and made dependent on a white society by decades of Mission indoctrination. Only in the Shasta country, beyond the reach of the Mexicans, had the Americans encountered armed resistance by the Indians. For most of the miners this fierce opposition by the Sinkiuse and Yakimas acting as Nations and owners of the land, was a shock and an outrage. They attempted to intimidate what they believed was a degenerate society; the Indians, to their consternation, fought back.\n\nMac Donald who had the respect of the Sinkiuse who knew him well, promised that if the Americans would release the Indian captives, he would accompany the party to the Thompson and ensure their safe passage. This was done, the captives were let go,and the party reached the Thompson River unmolested. The Americans later complained, that all through the trip, the French packers and the Metis had kept almost entirely out of the fighting. Of course. Steeped in the traditions of the HBC, they could see that it was the belligerent Americans who had outraged the Indians, and the American Army which was conducting a war against them. The most prudent course was to not ally oneself with this Yankee policy of intimidation and conquest.\n\nAnother party of miners on the same route left an inexcusable trail of blood and destruction behind them. Herman Francis Reinhart recalled that after crossing into British territory about the beginning of July in 1858,\n\n“For a few days we traveled along with great care, constantly on the lookout for an Indian attack.\n\nWe crossed several nice streams and fine looking farming and grazing land, and got to the British line… In a few days we got to Okanogan Lake. Our advanced guards saw some Indians just leaving their camp and cross the lake in their canoes in fear of us. The boys saw a couple of their dogs at their old camp ground, and shot them down, and they saw some old huts where the Indians had stored a lot of berries for the winter, blackberries and nuts, fifty or a hundred bushels. They helped themselfs to the berries and nuts, filling several sacks to take along, and the balance they just emptied into the lake, destroying them so that the Indians would not have them for provision for winter. I and a great many others, expressed the opinion that it was very imprudent and uncalled for, and no doubt the Indians would retaliate. But they only laughed and thought it great fun to to kill their dogs and destroy and rob them of their provisions. Most everyone but those who had done it disapproved of the whole affair.\n\n“The next night we camped on the bank of Lake Okanogan, which is about 150 miles long and from one to six miles wide. Next morning a man named White, of Company B, could not find his horse. Some of his friends helped hunt for it, but as the train went on the men were coming down the hill, and someone fired a shot at White, and some men above him on the hill saw some Indians trying to cut White\n\noff from his companions. The men called to White to go down as the Indians were after him. So they gave up the horse, and did not look any more for the train had already started on.\n\n“We traveled along the lake all day and camped on the banks at night. Every morning after we left camp some Indians would come across the lake in canoes and look over our camp grounds to look if we had left or thrown away anything (sometimes we threw away old clothes, hats, shoes, shirts, or old blankets or crusts of bread or meat, and they would come and get them after we left… That morning the advance guard planned to punish the Indians if they should come to camp a usual after we left. So right after breakfast some 25 men concealed themselves in a gulch close to camp, and the train went on as usual. We were passing along a high trail close to the lake and we soon saw three or four canoes start to come across from the other side, with seven or eight Indians in each canoe, to go to our camping place. I had gone with the train some one and one fourth to one and one half miles, when we heard some shooting. I stopped to listen and counted over fifty shots. In course of half an hour our advance guard that had formed the ambush came up to us and"
