It is a free-for-all.\n\nA jury exhibition on the other hand is one in which pictures entered for exhibition are selected on their merits by a special committee appointed for that purpose.\n\nThe present Exhibition Committee favours holding a non-jury show every second or third year, with a jury exhibition in the years in between.\n\nLAWREN HARRIS,\n\nChairman, Exhibition Committee.\n\nSeptember 22nd, 1945."
