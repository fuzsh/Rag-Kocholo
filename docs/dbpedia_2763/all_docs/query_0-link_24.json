        "text": "Introduction\n\nCertainly one of the more stunning tranportation posters ever printed. Side- and stern-wheelers are rostered along with passengers ships that were luxurious and state-of-the-art in the first decade of the twentieth century. The Empresses of China, India and Japan, built in the latter part of the nineteenth century, embody the transition from sail to steam with their schooner-like hulls, bowsprits and figureheads.\n\nThe following excerpts described how the CPR's shipping services came to be:\n\nIn this article, the gallery section catalogues the photos we have come across at major Canadian archives for the illustrated ships. The menu below, in accordance with the poster's legend, summarizes our findings. (Note in passing its mispelling \"Kush[sic:k]anook\".) Photographs do not appear to be available for all ships. The documentary evidence is also uneven with some vessels like the Empresses having captured the attention of many photographers. The menu links lead to entry points into the body of the article where selected images show off these ships in the best way possible. Build and disposal details regarding every CP ship can be obtained from TheShipsList.\n\nShips Menu\n\nEmpress of Britain (RMS ⚓ 1905 Built ⚓ 1919 Returned to owners ⚓ 1930 Scrapped)\n\nEmpress of Ireland (RMS ⚓ 1906 Built ⚓ 1914 Sunk after collision with another ship)\n\nLake Manitoba (1901 Built ⚓ 1903 Taken over with Beaver Line ⚓ 1918 Sold)\n\nLake Erie (1899 Built ⚓ 1903 Taken over with Beaver Line ⚓ 1916 Sold)\n\nLake Champlain (1900 Built ⚓ 1903 Taken over with Beaver Line ⚓ 1949 Scrapped)\n\nMontreal\n\nCruizer\n\nEmpress of India (RMS ⚓ 1890 Built ⚓ 1914 Sold ⚓ 1949 Scrapped)\n\nNot surprisingly, her sister ship, the Empress of Japan, had identical balusters:\n\nEmpress of Japan (RMS ⚓ 1890 Built ⚓ 1926 Scrapped)\n\nEmpress of China (RMS ⚓ 1891 Built ⚓ 1911 Wrecked ⚓ 1912 Scrapped)\n\nMonteagle (1899 Built ⚓ 1903 Taken over with Beaver Line ⚓ 1926 Scrapped)\n\nKeewatin (1907 Clyde-built ⚓ 1966 Sold ⚓ Preserved at Port McNicoll)\n\nJones, p.116: «At 330 feet in length, [Keewatin and Assiniboia] could each take on board about 280 passengers and 86 crew members. Both ships featured a main lounge, two decks high, with staterooms on both levels, Stained glass skylights and a profusion of potted plants on rafters above the public rooms added to the charm and popularity of the ships.»\n\nJones, p.117: «Amidships, the dining rooms were capable of seating more than one hundred. The Assiniboia and Keewatin offered solid fare, as a rule quite palatable. Various cuts of meat and fillets of local lake fish were supplemented by a variety of seasonal vegetables and desserts. In keeping with tradition, cups of bouillon were served on deck in mid-morning, and four o’clock tea was de rigueur.»\n\nJones, p.109: «All three of the CPR's original Great Lakes steamers that had been built in Scotland [Algoma, Alberta and Athabasca], as well as the other two Clyde-built vessels that later joined the service [Keewatin and Assiniboia], had to be cut in half to pass through the Beauharnois and Cornwall canals on the Quebec and Ontario sections of the man-made St. Lawrence navigation system. … [All] were reunited at Buffalo, and their fittings were installed at Port Colbourne.»\n\nAssiniboia (1907 Clyde-built ⚓ 1968 Sold)\n\nManitoba (1889 Built by Polson Iron Works in Owen Sound ⚓ 1951 Scrapped)\n\nJones, p.113: «Slightly bigger than the Alberta and Athabasca, at about three hundred feet in length, the Manitoba came to be regarded, for a time, as the finest passenger ship on the Great Lakes, entering service as the flagship of the CPR's Great Lakes Fleet.»\n\nHer engines had been salvaged from the CPR's Algoma which had run aground and broken in half off Greenstone Island, near Isle Royale, on 7 November 1885—the same day the CPR's last spike was being driven at Craigellachie.:p.114\n\nAthabasca (1883 Clyde-built ⚓ 1946 Sold to a Florida fruit carrier)\n\nIt is interesting to note in passing the resurgence of wind-assisted propulsion.\n\nAlberta (1883 Clyde-built ⚓ 1946 Sold to a Florida fruit carrier)\n\nPrincess Charlotte (1908 Built ⚓ 1949 Sold)\n\nThe round table was likely the captain's table.\n\nPrincess Victoria (1902 Built ⚓ 1952 Sold)\n\nFrancis Mawson Rattenbury, at the time CPR's Western Division Architect, designed the interior.\n\nPrincess Mary (1910 Built ⚓ 1952 Sold)\n\nPrincess Royal (1907 Built ⚓ 1931 Sold)\n\nJoan (1892 Built ⚓ 1905 Taken over from Esquimalt & Nanaimo ⚓ 1914 Sold)\n\nCharmer (1887 Built ⚓ 1901 Taken over with Canadian Pacific Navigation Co. ⚓ 1912 Sold)\n\nPrincess Beatrice (Sept 1903 Built ⚓ 1928 Scrapped)\n\nPrincess May (1888 Built ⚓ 1905 Purchased from Marty & D'Abbadie ⚓ 1919 Sold)\n\nOn August 5, 1910, she had run aground on Sentinel Island Reef in Alaska:\n\nAmur (1890 Built ⚓ 1901 Taken over with Canadian Pacific Navigation Co. ⚓ 1911 Sold)\n\nPrincess Adelaide (1910 Built ⚓ 1949 Sold)\n\nTees (1893 Built ⚓ 1901 Taken over with Canadian Pacific Navigation Co. ⚓ 1923 Sold)\n\nCzar\n\nThe unidentified ship is readily recognised as one of the Pacific Empresses.\n\nNanoose (1908 Built ⚓ ⚓ 1946 Sold)\n\nTransfer Barge No1\n\nPrincess Ena (1907 Built ⚓ ⚓ 1931 Sold)\n\nOtter (1900 Built ⚓ 1901 Taken over with Canadian Pacific Navigation Co. ⚓ 1931 Sold)\n\nQueen City (1894 Built ⚓ 1901 Taken over with Canadian Pacific Navigation Co. ⚓ 1916 Burnt out)\n\nCity Of Nanaimo (1891 Built ⚓ 1901 Taken over from Esquimalt & Nanaimo ⚓ 1912 Sold)\n\nBeaver (1898 Built ⚓ 1901 Taken over with Canadian Pacific Navigation Co. ⚓ 1919 Sold)\n\nHosmer (Rebuilt in 1925 after a fire)\n\nMinto (November 19, 1898 Built ⚓ 1954 Presented to Nakusp Chamber of Commerce)\n\nSandon\n\nMoyie (October 22 1898 Built ⚓ 1956 Retired; restored & preserved at Kaslo)\n\nYmir\n\nKokanee (1896 Built ⚓ 1897 Purchased from Columbia & Kootenay Steam Navigation ⚓ 1923 Scrapped)\n\nKuskanook (May 1906 Built ⚓ 1931 Retired ⚓ 1934 Sold)\n\nCox, p. 19: «The KUSKANOOK was the fastest steamer on Kootenay Lake...»\n\nOkanagan (April 16 1907 Built ⚓ 1934 Laid up ⚓ 1938 Hulked)\n\nKootenay (April 1897 Built ⚓ 1920 Sold)\n\nRossland (1897 Built ⚓ 1916 Sank under weight of snow)\n\nAberdeen (May 22, 1893 Built ⚓ 1916 Withdrawn from service ⚓ 1919 Scrapped)\n\nCox, p. 13: «The S.S. ABERDEEN was the first C.P.R. stern wheel steamer on the Okanagan Lake. It was built at Okanagan Landing and launched there in May, 1893. The ABERDEEN burned wood until 1902 and then was converted to a coal burner. The ABERDEEN was named in honour of Lord and Lady Aberdeen, who had a ranch in the Guisachan District of Kelowna. It was 148 feet long; the beam was 30 feet; and the gross tonnage was 554. The sternwheeler provided employment for a number of people who cut cords of four foot wood to heat the vessels[sic] steam boiler, until her conversion to coal.»\n\nSlocan (May 1897 Built ⚓ 1928 Sold)\n\nNelson (1891 Built ⚓ 1897 Purchased from Columbia & Kootenay Steam Navigation ⚓ 1913 Withdrawn from service ⚓ 1914 Burnt by CP)\n\nYork\n\nS.S.

Of that 52, 12 were sunk by mines, torpedoes and shelling, and 2 others were lost through marine accident. Five were converted into mock battleships in one of the most amusing stories of the war, Winston Churchill, Britain's First Lord of the Admiralty, dreamed up the idea of disguising merchant ships as battleships and having them accompany convoys to confuse the Germans and give them a false notion of British strength.\n\nThe five ships were meticulously converted. All cargo hoists and derricks were removed and replaced by an imposing wood and canvas superstructure, complete with threatening-looking wooden twelve-inch guns. There were nice touches, such as six huge anchors replacing the two original smaller ones and twin rows of portholes along the side where none had previously existed.\n\nThe special squadron was completed for duty in May, 1915. Unfortunately, the dummy battleships, which had a top speed of only eight knots, couldn't keep up with real battleships, which routinely steamed in the twenty-knot range. What's more, the plywood superstructure had a tendency to buckle and cave in the wind. The squadron was esentially useless, and by September, 1915, had been cast aside.»\n\nGallery\n\nArchives of Ontario\n\nBritish Columbia Archives\n\nBritish Columbia Regional Digitized History\n\nCity of Vancouver Archives\n\nCape Breton University, Beaton Institute\n\nEx Glenbow Archives\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada\n\nMcCord Museum\n\nSimon Fraser University Digitized Collections\n\nToronto Public Library\n\nUniversity of British Columbia Library\n\nVancouver Public Library\n\nReferences\n\nCox, D.
