        "text": "Launcelot de Lake is the most worshipful knight of King Arthur famous as the noblest knight in the world.\n\nFamily[]\n\nHe is the son of King Ban of Benwick (6,iii) and Elaine. He is the father of Sir Galahad.\n\nLauncelot had brethren, nephews, and cousins. The knights of his blood are noble men and dread shame. (8,xxii) Sir Lionel was his nephew (6,i) but called him his brother. Blamore and Bleoberis de Ganis are also his nigh cousins. (8,xv)(19,xi) (sister's sons (8,xvii) or brother's sons (8,xxii)) Others of his blood were Ector, Bors, Galihodin, Galihud (19,xi)(7,xxvii) Gahalantine, Menaduke, Villiars the Valiant and Hebes le Renoumes. (19,xi)\n\nEarly life[]\n\nWhen he was born, his first name was \"Galahad\" until his mother confirmed him as Launcleot. (4,i)\n\nWhile King Mark was setting the tomb of Sir Lanceor and Colombe, Merlin prophecised that Launcelot and Tristram, the truest lovers, will fight the greatest battle that will ever be, but they won't slay each other; he wrote their names on the tomb with gold letters. (2,viii)\n\nAfter the death of Balin, Merlin predicted that his sword can be handled only by the best knight in the world, and that shall be Launcelot or Galahad, and with it he will slay the man that in the world he loved best, Sir Gawaine. Launcelot also through his nobleness will forbid Merlin's bed of madness on the lost island. (2,xix) Thus Launcelot would be one of the knights who overmatched Gawaine, despite his thrice might. (4,xviii)\n\nWhen Arthur said to Merlin that he wants to marry Guenever, Merlin tried to warn him that covertly that she and Launcelot will love each other, and then his tale went to the adventures of Sangreal. (3,i)\n\nWhen he was young, King Claudas was waging war against his father. Merlin (and Nimue) visited them and Merlin prophecized that within 20 years he will revenge them and be famous as the most glorious man in all Christendom, and his mother will live to see him and live many years more. (4,i)\n\nIn the following years Launcelot entered the service of King Arthur at Camelot.\n\nWhen he appeared to Arthur he didn't seem to be that strong at first. (9,i) When he was first made knight, he was often put to the worse upon horseback, but ever upon foot he recovered his renown, and slew and defoiled many knights of the Round Table; therefore the rebukes he did unto many knights causeth them that be men of prowess. (9,iv)\n\nNimue was afraid of his prowess and never allowed her beloved Pelleas to joust or fight against him, and made it so that he fought only on his side. (4,xxviii)\n\nLiber VIII[]\n\nAt some point Launcelot conquered gloriously the Dolorous Guard and gained fame after it. (8,x) Later Arthur had to be there with him, and couldn't be in Camelot when Anguish came. (8,xx)\n\nIt was learned that Sir Carados had fought Gawaine and captured him. Launcelot met him as he was going to his castle and he saw Gawaine bound after him, and asked how is he; he replied that only he or Tristram could help him. Heavy with these words, he bade Carados to lay him down and fight. Carados called him a fool and threatened to do the same to him; Launcelot said to spare him not because he would not spare him either. Soon they met each other and brake their spears, then pulled swords and fought on horseback for more than an hour. Finally he smote a buffet that pierce Carados's brain-pan. He then pulled Carados by the collar under his horse's feet, alighted, pulled off his helm and decapitated him. Then he released Gawaine. This tale was related to Tristram who admired him. (8,xxviii) Tristram was frequently compared to Launcelot, and his love to La Beale Isoud was compared to Launcelot's love to Guenever. (8,xxxii)\n\nIn turn, Launcelot loved Tristram for his noble deeds. But Sir Suppinabiles who visited Arthur's court from Brittany brought him the news that he married the king's daughter, Isoud la Blanche Mains. Hearing this, he cursed him for such a noble knight being untrue to his love; and instructed Suppinabiles to tell Tristram that from now on he won't love him and to warn him that he will be his mortal enemy. (8,xxxvi)\n\nAs the White Knight[]\n\nSoon after Launcelot rode incognito in white armour to a quest, when Frol requested to joust with him, and Launcelot smote him down.\n\nMuch later he was roding towards Frol and another knight, and seeing him again, Frol challenged him. The White Knight said that there was no need, but reluctantly feutred their spears and overthrew Frol once again and rode his way slowly. Then the other knight, who understood that he was from the Round Table, rode after and asked to tell his name. The White Knight agreed said on the condition that he will not reveal it to others, and to tell his. The other knight was Sir Lamorak, and the the White Knight revealed he was Launcelot. They put up their swords and kissed heartily each other with joy. Lamorak offered to serve him but Launcelot said nobody of such noble blood should serve him and that he is on a quest that he is on a quest he must be alone. Lamorak blessed him and they departed. (8,xl)\n\nLiber IX[]\n\nWhen Launcelot came to the court, he heard how the young knight La Cote Male Taile slew the lion, and how he took upon him the adventure of the black shield. He said to his fellows that it was a shame for them to let such a young knight to take the hardest adventure on him to his destruction. He said how Maledisant had it to seek the most proved knights until Breuse Saunce Pite stole it, but Tristram won it back and returned it to the damsel. (8,xx) He felt obliged to go after him. (9,v)\n\n7 days later Launcelot overtook him and saluted him and the damsel. Mordred left the company and Launcelot rode with them all day. The damsel always rebuked La Cote Male Taile; making Launcelot to answer for him, and she started rebuking Launcelot. Meanwhile a damsel came with a letter from Tristram, explaining his marriage with Isoud, so Launcelot departed to read that letter and write a reply. (9,v)\n\nThe morning he woke up and delivered the damsel with his letters to Tristram and rode after La Cote Male Taile. (9,v)\n\nFight with Nerovens[]\n\nOn a bridge a knight challenged him to joust, and Launcelot smote him down; they continued on foot a noble and mighty battle, until Launcelot smote him down grovelling upon his hands and knees. The knight yielded him, and Launcelot accepted his surrender. (9,v)\n\nThe knight asked his name, but Launcelot refused and asked him first. He said he was Nerovens, who had been knighted by him. He was glad that he proved a good knight and said who he is. Nerovens regretted and fell to his feet to kiss them but Launcelot didn't let him. They made great joy and Nerovens told him to not go by the Castle of Pendragon, because he heard of a knight of the Round Table who was taken prisoner the previous day. (9,v) As it was his fellow, he swore to rescue him with his life. He rode fast to the castle and in front of it came 6 knights and attacked him. Launcelot feutred his spear and smote the foremost, 3 hit him and 3 failed. Launcelot passed through them and turned around to pass another time; he smote another through the breast and broke his spear. The other 4 drew lashed at him with their swords, and with his every stroke Launcelot threw them from their horses; then he rode hurling into the castle. (9,vi)\n\nBattle with Sir Brian[]\n\nInside the lord of the castle, Sir Brian de les Isles prepared himself. They feutred their spears and hurled together that both their horses rashed down. They dismounted and prepared shields and swords, and flang together as wood men. Finally he managed such a buffet that Brian fell on his knees. Launcelot rashed on him and pulled off his helm. He then yielded to his mercy and grace. Launcelot forced him to release all his prisoners; inside he found 30 of Arthur's knights and 40 ladies and freed them along with La Cote Male Taile, then left. (9,vi)\n\nMeanwhile a damsel came from Nerovens and told everyone that it was the best knight of the world, Sir Launcelot who defeated them. Brian, his lady and all his knights were glad that such a man defeated them, and Maledisant regretted for rebuking him. (9,vi) Soon La Cote Male Taile and the damsel overtook him, and she asked for his forgiveness, saying that now she realised that he was Launcelot, whom she sought long. He asked how she knew it, and she said Nerovens's damosel told her his name. Launcelot blamed her and Nerovens, and said that he will ride with them only on the condition that she won't rebuke the knight any more, because he is a good knight who will prove noble, and he followed him to save him. The damsel revealed that she rebuked him to dissuade him from the quest, as he was too young for it. Launcelot understood, and said that he will call her Bienpensant. (9,vii)\n\nAfter a long time they came to a bridge at the border of Surluse. Many people came and said that because Brewnor holds the black shield, only one might pass the bridge. Launcelot offered to pass first, but La Cote Male Taile asked to enter the fortress; Launcelot was cautious, but the knight prayed him to put himself in the adventure, so he reluctantly let him. Indeed, inside he was attacked, and for two hourse he and the damsel watched as he fought Sir Plenorius. The damsel said that he fights for long, and Launcelot agreed that he is a noble knight, considering it being his first battle and his grievous wounds, he manages to endure against that good knight. (9,vii) Saying that, he saw La Cote Male Taile to fall down, and Plenorius taking him up to his tower. As promised, he went to the bridge and shouted Plenorius to deliver the prisoner or come to fight.\n\nBattle with Plenorius[]\n\nSoon Plenorius came with his horse. They feutred the spears and clashed like thunder, their horses falling down. They avoided them, pulled out swords and clashed like bulls. Under great strokes and foins Launcelot won ground pushing him back until they reached his tower gate. Launcelot recognised him as a good knight but said that his life is in his hand and should yield him and his prisoner. Then Plenorius struck migthily on his helm that fire sprang out of his eyes. Launcelot doubled his strokes so thick, and hit him so mightily that Plenorius fell on his knees. Launcelot leapt on him and pulled him grovelling down. Plenorius then yielded him, his tower and all his prisoners, which he accepted. (9,viii)\n\nThe Launcelot rode to the other bridge where he jousted with other 3 of his brethren, Pillounes, Pellogris and Pelladris, smiting them first on horseback, then beating them on foot and made them yield. He returned to Plenorius and released his prisoners, including King Carados. Launcelot offered to La Cote Male Taile all the fortresses and bridges, but he instead preferred Plenorius to keep his livelihood and to be a knight of King Arthur. Launcelot agreed, and ordered Plenorius to come with his brethren at the next feast, to become a Knight of the Round Table as there will be a vacant seat. (9,viii)\n\nThe following days they rested there until La Cote Male Taile was healed of his wounds. (9,viii)\n\nWar with Rome[]\n\nWhen 12 ambassadors from Rome asked truage for Emperor Lucius, Arthur held a council. (5,i) Launcelot was there, and when it was decided to make war, he with all other promised to contribute to the war with every other. (5,ii)\n\nLauncelot departed with Arthur for the War, and when he was wroth when Artur resigned the rule of the realm and Guenever to other knights, for he had left Tristram back for the love of Beale Isoud. (5,iii) This must be an anachronism because Tristram was either too young or hadn't met Isoud yet.\n\nAfter the Battle of Burgoyne, he with Sir Cador and other knights took Roman prisoners to Paris. (5,vi)\n\nBattle of Champayne[]\n\nOn the morning, as they were to pass through a wood on their way to Paris, he sent soe knights to scout the woods. But they returned telling that there lay in an ambush 60,000 Romans. Then he put in array his knights and men of war, and met with the Romans. He fought so nobly showing his prowess and might slaying down right on every side, that nobody could endure his strokes and Saracens fled from him like sheep. Later when Arthur came, Cador praised Launcelot for his prowess and manhood, and his cousins. Arthur said that they would lose no glory if they came back seeing they were overmatched, and Launcelot and Cador said that this shame would never be recovered. (5,vii)\n\nBattle of Sessoine[]\n\nThen they went to Sessoine and in preparation for the battle, Launcelot with Bors de Ganis, Kay, Marrok and Marhaus were to await on King Arthur. (5,viii)\n\nReturn to England[]\n\nAfter the War, the French book mentions Launcelot first; like other knights of the Round Table made many joust and tournaments and increased in noble deeds and prowess. In all tournaments for life and death he passed all others, overcome only by treason or enchantment. The Queen had him in favour above al others, and Launcelot likewise loved her above all other ladies, and for her did many deeds, and saved her from fire through his noble chivalry.\n\nBook VII[]\n\nOne time he and/or Gawaine killed someone. His sister told her lover, Sir Ironside to take revenge on Arthur's knights. (7,xvii)\n\nGawaine and Launcelot were angry with Sir Kay for mocking the kitchen knave, calling him \"Beaumains\". Launcelot asked him to stop mocking, believe that eh would prove a man of rgreat worship, and Kay replied that the boy has what he is asking. Launcelot reminded to him how he mocked Sir Brewnor, and that turned him to anger afterward, but Kay replied that Beaumains was different from Brewnor. After meat Launcelot, of his great gentleness and courtesy, invited him to his chamber to eat and drink enough, as did later Gawaine, but Beaumains refused and obeyed only Kay. As Beaumains was treated poorly, Launcelot and Gawaine gave him gold to spend, and clothes. (7,ii)\n\nA year later Launcelot was in Carlion for the feast of Pentecost; Beaumains came in full armour to him and took his leave to ride after a damsel, and asked to hurry after him. (7,iii) Kay rode after Baumains to show him who is better, and Launcelot with Gawaine told him to stay, but Kay rode away. Launcelot rode after him and saw how Baumains defeated him only with a sword. Baumains invited Launcelot to joust so they prepared, and came together that both fell down and were bruised sore. Launcelot stood up and helped Baumains from his horse, but in turn he invited to fight on foot, so they rushed together, tracing and rasing like boars, thrusting for an hour, and Launcelot marveled of his strength, feeling like a giant to him, and started to fear that he would be shamed. He told him to not fight that dangerously because they don't have such a big quarrel. (7,iv) He knighted Beaumains, and he charged Launcelot not to reveal his name until he requires him so. (7,v)(7,xviii)(7,xxix)\n\nWhen the Red Knight was overcome by Beaumains and came to surrender to Launcelot and Gawaine or the evil he had done. (7,xviii) Launcelot and he came to Arthur to tell him that a goodly lord was coming with an army of knights. It was the Red Knight who came to yield to Arthur, and he kneeled before Launcelot and Gawaine and asked for forgiveness for his enmity against them. (7,xxiii) Arthur and Gawaine marvelled. Launcelot assured them that Beaumains came of a full noble blood and few men living can match his might and hardiness, and noble prowess. Arthur asked him if he knew his name and whence he came and his blood; Launcelot said he does, and that's why he knighted him, but Beaumains charged him not to reveal his name. (7,xviii)\n\nWhen Queen Margawse came asking for her son Gareth and all realized that he was Beaumains, Gawaine and his brothers offered to go and seek him. Launcelot and Baudwin instead the King should send an invitation to Dame Lionesse to come the court and help him to find Gareth. Arthur agreed. (7,xxvi)\n\nThe Lady announced a jousts between Arthur and her knights on the Assumption of our Lady so he and some of his blood went to Castle Dangerous with Arthur. (7,xxvii) During the tournament Sir Persant came in and Launcelot smote him with his horse to the earth; Persant's brethren then met with Launcelot's kin. (7,xxviii)\n\nLater Arthur marveled at the prowess of a strong knight of many colors fighting for Lionesse, and asked Launcelot to encounter with him. Launcelot noticed how he loved and was doing great labor for a lady, with many deeds, and didn't agree to deprive him of his worship after doing so well, but let him savor his honour. (7,xxviii) Then there was a drawing of swords and Launcelot met with Sir Turquine and smote each other, and his brother Carados came to support him; but Launcelot, the noblest knight of the world worshipfully fought with them both, and all wondered of his noblesse. Then came the colorful knight, and hurtled them in-sunder, without striking Launcelot at all, despite of the opponent side; Launcelot supposed that he should be Gareth. (7,xxix)\n\nWhen Arthur finally reunited with Gareth, it was decided to make Gareth's and Lionesse's wedding at Kink Kenadon on Michaelmas. Arthur rode with his fellowship there and so Gareth came to the king again and rode with him. Gareth and Launcelot made great joy with each other, as they loved each other most than any other knights. Gareth was mostly with his company as he hated Gawaine's violent condition. (7,xxxiv)\n\nOn the third day of jousting Launcelot overthrew 50 knights, and did many marvellous deeds of arms, that all men wondered on him. (7,xxxv)\n\nLiber VI[]\n\nWhen he rested long enough, he decided to meet strange adventures and prepared with Sir Lionel to leave. (6,i)\n\nIt was Thursday (6,vi) and as they reached a deep plain, Launcelot was heavy because of the noon heat and Lionel showed him a great apple-tree with a fair shadow. They tied their horses and he lay under the shadow, with his helm under his head. While he was sleeping, Lionel was caught by Sir Turquine. (6,i) When Sir Ector de Maris learned that Launcelot left, he was angry with himself and rode out to find him but he too ended up captive in Turquine's castle. (6,ii)\n\nBetrayal[]\n\nAs Launcelot was sleeping he was seen by four queens: Morgan le Fay, the Queen of Northgalis, the Queen of Eastland, and the Queen of the Out Isles, and they began to strive on him. Morgan offered to take him with them and let him choose his lover. She put a spell that he'd sleep for 6 hours, they laid him on his shield. 2 of their knights bare him on horseback to the castle Chariot, and they laid him in a cold chamber. At night a damsel brought him his supper. He awoke and responded that he was confused, not knowing how he found himself there, if not by enchantment. The damsel said he should not worry and he'd find out by morning. Launcelot thanked her for her good will and he slept alone.\n\nIn the morning of Friday (6,vi) the four queens visited him and exchanged greetings. Morgan said that he lost Guenever for ever, and she him, and he should choose one of them or die in the prison. Launcelot said he'd prefer to die than choose any of these enchantresses, and defended Guenever saying she is the truest lady to Arthur. The queens then left him there mourning. (6,iii)\n\nThe damsel came again to bring his dinner and he said that he never had so ill days in his life. She offered to free him in return of a favor and he agreed. She heard his name as Launcelot the flower of knights, and asked him to help her father next Tuesday who will have a tournament against the King of Northgalis. Her father is King Bagdemagus whom Launcelot know and agreed to help her.\n\nFighting for Bagdemagus[]\n\nOn the morning of Saturday (6,vi) he was ready. She freed him of his 12 locks, and once he was armed, she brought him to his horse, he mounted and took his great spear and shield. According to her instructions he started to go to an abbey of white monks 10 miles away and wait her and the King. He rode into a great forest but all day couldn't find a highway. (6,iv)\n\nAt night he was in a slade, and saw a pavilion and decided to rest. He dismounted and tied his horse, unarmed himself and inside he found a bed where he lay disappointed. (6,iv) Within an hour someone laid by him, hugged and began to kiss him; feeling a rough beard, and remembering the recent treachery, he started out of the bed, the other knight after him, both got their swords; the other knight went out but Launcelot followed him and by a little slake he wounded him almost mortally. The knight yielded to him and Launcelot granted him and asked why he came into the bed. The knight said that the pavilion is his, and expected his lady to be there. Launcelot apologized and explained that he was adread of treason, and told him to go inside to rest and he stanched his blood. Soon after the lady came and seeing her lord wounded she cried out on Launcelot, but the knight comforted her. The lady asked his name, and she recognised him by his speech, knowing him better than he knows. She asked him to promise, for the harms he did to them, to accept Belleus to Arthur's court and help him to be made knight of the Round Table. Launcelot invited them for the next high feast and promised to do his best, if they prove worthy.\n\nAs they talked Sunday (6,vi) dawned. He armed himself, took his horse, and with their instructions, he reached the abbey within 2 hours. (6,v) He rode within the yard and the damsel sent men to take his horse to the stable and him to a fair chamber where he was unarmed, and the lady sent to him a long gown. She joined him and welcomed him happily. Before evening king Bagdemagus also joined them to the chamber, embraced Launcelot and they were both glad. He told his story, how he was captured and freed by his daughter, obliged to serve her and her kindred and promising to help him on Tuesday. Asking which knights fought for the King of Northgalis, the king said that they were Mador, Mordred and Gahalantine. Launcelot adviced the king to choose 3 knights and send them with white shields to him, so that they ambush the enemy party. That night they rested and Bagdemagus left.\n\nIndeed he sent to Launcelot 3 knights with 4 white shields. On Tuesday they lodged in a little leaved wood beside where the tournament should be. (6,vi) The tournament went bad for Bagdemagus then came Launcelot with the knights and he thrust in in the thickest press with his spear, he broke the backs of 4 knights and smote down another, and the King of Northgalis himself. The 3 knights of Arthur noticed him, Sir Mador moving first against him but Launcelot smote him down. Then he was aware of Mordred, got a great spear and met him, giving such a buffet that broke the arson of his saddle and fell down. Gahalantine followed, and they drove with all their strength that both spears rboke in their hands; they exchanged grim strokes with their swords, and Launcelot was wroth out of measure until he smote him on the helm, causing his horse to run away with him swooned. He got another great spear, and brought to earth 16 knights, some of them together with their horses before it broke and took another, smiting 12 more knights, and most of them never throve after. Eventually Bagdemagus was the winner.\n\nLauncelot rode with the king to Bagdemagus's castle and there he celebrated with the king and his daughter and received gifts. At the morning he said he will go to seek Lionel, took his horse, and betaught them all to God, telling the damsel to let him know any time she needs his service, and he won't fail her as a true knight. (6,vii)\n\nAgainst Turquine[]\n\nHe reached the forest where he slept and in the midst of a highway he met a damsel on a white palfrey. He told that he seeks adventures and asked her about the forest, and she said that she will take him to Sir Turquine, who will not be overmatched by anyone else. She asked him to promise to help her and other distressed damsels with a false knight. (6,vii)\n\nThen she brought him to a ford and a tree where hung a basin with hanged shields. He watered his horse and beat the basn with the butt of his spear so hard till the bottom fell out. He saw nothing and rode along the gates of a manor almost half-an-hour. Then he saw a great knight that drove a horse bearing a bounded up knight, Gaheris. Launcelot told the damsel he'd rescue that knight and all the prisoners. They gripped their spears and saw each other and Launcelot asked the knight to put Gaheris off the horse and prove their strengths. (6,vii) They rode as fast as possible, smiting each other in the midst of their shields, stonied as their horses's backs brast. They dismounted, took shields and pulled swords. They came together and exchanged strong strokes that neither shields nor harness could hold, causing grimly wounds, and bled grievously. They trased and rased for 2 hours, trying to hit any bare place, until they leaned on their swords breathless. Turquine said that he is the biggest and best breathed man he ever met, equal to the one he hates, and asked his name, ready to accord with him and deliver the prisoners, if it's not that one. Launcelot asked to know the knight he hates. He said about Launcelot who killed his brother and asked again his name. Launcelot revealed it was him, and that he defies thim. Turquine challenged him again. They hurtled as wild bulls rushing and lashing with shields and swords, and sometimes fell both on their noses. After more than 2 hours, without rest, Launcelot took many wounds. (6,viii) Eventually Launcelot noticed that Turquine ws tired and couldn't lift the shield high, so he fiercely leapt upon him, grasping the beaver of his helmed, plucked him down on his knees and took off his helm to cut his neck.\n\nThen he said to the damsel that he can follow her but has no horse, and she suggested to borrow Gaheris's horse while he is sent to deliver the prisoners. Indeed, he prayed Gaheris to not be grieved to take his horse, and he gladly accepted for saving his life and asked his name. Launcelot said who he is, and saved him for the love of Arthur and Gawaine, and told him to enter the manor to find there many knights of the Round Table, telling his greetings and instructions to take whatever they can find, then tell his brothers to wait for him at the court, as now he must follow the damsel. (6,ix)\n\nThey rode on a fair highway and the damsel told him about a knight stalking that way and how he steals or rapes all ladies and gentlewomen. Launcelot said that it's a pity to live who shames the order of knighthood contrary to his oath; he suggested to her to ride before him while he stays behind hidden, and will come to her rescue as soon as she is troubled, and will show him about knighthood. Indeed, the damsel was soon assaulted by the knight, and as she cried, Launcelot ran as ast as he could and cursed the knight, calling him traitor for distressing the women. Seeing that he pulled his sword, Launcelot threw his spear and drew out his, and clave his head and neck unto the throat, saying he has the payment he deserved. He asked the damsel for any other service; the damsel blessed him and wondered that he is wifeless and how it is said that he is enchanted by Guenever so that he won't be able to love another, causing sorrow to women of the land. He replied that he can't stop people say what they please, and that he doesn't wish to marry and leave arms, tournaments, battles and adventures; and also he doesn't want paramours, fearing God, as the adventurous and lecherous knights are unhappy and unfortunate in wars, overcome by lesser knights, or by misfortune the slay better men. With that they departed.(6,x)\n\nDelivering Tintagil[]\n\nThen for more than 2 days he rode in a deep forest and had strait lodging. On the third day he rode oever a long bridge and a foul churl stopped him, smote his horse on the nose that it turned about, forbidding him to pass. He replied that he may not ride beside and asked why. The churl said it's not his choice and attacked him with an iron club; Launcelot pulled his sword and stroke aback, and clave his head unto the paps. The bridge led to a fair village where all men and women complained for killing the chief porter of their castle; he ignored them and rode straight inside, dismounted, tied his horse to a ring on the wall and went to a fair green court. Thinking that it was a fair place to fight, he dressed him. Looking about, people in doors and windows cursed him. (6,x)\n\nImmediately came against him 2 great giants. He put his shield in front and blocked a stroke of a giant, and clave his head with his sword. The other tried to flee but Launcelot ran after him and smote him on the shoulder and clave him to the navel. He went into the hall, and came 60 ladies and damosels, who knelt before him and thanked God and him for freeing them. They said they were kept prisoners for 7 years and did the most worship than any other knight that they will bear record, and asked his name. Once he said his name, they replied that never any other knight overthrow these giants, and they were wished for him, and he was the only knight the giants feared. Launcelot sent greetings to their friends, and asked to give him cheer whenever he comes in any of their marches, and offers the castle's treasure to them for all their troubles, and to the lord of the castle. They replied that the castle is Tintagil, and its lord was a duke. He blessed them and departed. (6,xi)\n\nHe rode into many strange and wild countries, through many waters and valleys and wasn't lodged well, until he found a fair courtelage, and an old gentlewoman lodged him and he made mirth for him and his horse. Later she brought him to a fair garret over the gate, to his bed, where he unarmed and set his harness by, and slept on the bed. He woke up when someone knocked at the gate furiously, so he rose up and looked at the window and saw 3 knights riding and lashing on Kay knocking with swords. He thought it is shame to see 3 knights against one, and he would be partially guilty for his death so he took his harness and climbed down the window with a sheet, and challenged them to leave the sole knight and come on him. Indeed they dismounted and turned against Launcelot and there was a great battle, and assailed him on every side with many great strokes. As the sole knight prepared to help him, Launcelot said that he wants no help, as it was himself who came to help him. Indeed, within 6 strokes, he struck them down. The 3 yielded to him, but Launcelot didn't accept, but to rather yield to Kay, or he won't grant their lives. The knights refused saying that they would overcome him if he didn't help him, and there is no reason to yield to him. Launcelot repeated his offer, and made them choose whether to die or live, as if they are yielded, it will be to Kay. The knights agreed, to save their lives, and Launcelot commanded them to come to the court of King Arthur on Whitsunday and offer themselves as prisoners to Queen Guenever's grace and mercy, in the name of Sir Kay. The knights swore to do so upon their swords each, and Launcelot let them depart. He knocked at the gate with the pommel of his sword; the gentlewoman was surprised to see him again, and he said that rose and leapt out at his window to help an old fellow. Only near the light Kay realised it was Launcelot and knelt down, thanking for saving him twice; but Launcelot replied he did nothing but what he had to, and offered him to rest. After Kay supped, they went to their beds and lodged together in one bed. (6,xi)\n\nIn Kay's armour[]\n\nLauncelot arose early on the morning while Kay was sleeping, and armed himself with Kay's armour and shield. And from the stable he took Kay's horse, and took his leave of the gentlewoman and departed. When Kay woke up, he realized that he left his armour so that he will ride safely. (6,xi) He rode long in a great wood and reached a low country; on a long bridge stood 3 pavilions and as he passed by the squires silently, they thought he was proud Sir Kay. Gaunter, one of them armed himself and came close and challenged him; Launcelot turned around, they feutred their spears and came together with all their might, and Launcelot smote down both horse and man. His brother, Gilmere, realized he was bigger than Kay and probably had killed him; the other, Raynold, supposed it would be Launcelot or Tristram or Pelleas. They overtook him with their horses and Gilmere ran to him with his spear, but Launcelot smote him down. Raynold said he would not have to do with such a strong man but should take part with their dead brothers and they hurtled together with all their might, shivered both their spears, drew swords and lashed together. Seeing the other two coming he smote a sore stroke to Raynold that he fell down, and the other two. Bloodied, Raynold started up to him, and Launcelot recognised him, saying he was close to him when he was knighted, and he doesn't want to slay him, being a good knight. Raynold thanked him and offered to yield if he tells his real name, as he is not Kay. Launcelot replied that they should yield to Guenever on Whitsundey as prisoners, saying they were sent by Kay. They swore to do so and Launcelot left. (6,xii)\n\nHE rode into a deep forest, then a slade and saw 4 knights of the Round Table hovering under an oak. One ran against him with a spear so Launcelot knew it was Sagramour and feutred his spear and smote him sore tha he fell with his horse. Ector de Maris followed but he smote him through the shield and shoulder than he fell with his horse to the earth, with his spear holding. A third also followed and Launcelot knew it was Uwaine and met him on the plain, and from his buffet he was astonied. The last knight came and Launcelot knew it was Gawaine; they ran with their horses with all their might, and smote each other in midst of the shield and he charged so strong that Gawaine's horse reversed up-so-down. Launcelot passed on a pace and smiled, and blessed whoever made his spear, that he never had a better one. (6,xiii)\n\nLauncelot rode a great while in a deep forest, and saw and followed a black brachet that was tracing, seemingly a hurt deer, and noticed a trace of blood which he followed, as the brachet looked behind her. She led him through a great marsh and over an old and feeble bridge into an old manor. In the midst of a great hall was a dead knight. His wife came mourning and accused him for bringing her sorrow, but he replied that he never harmed that knight, and he was brought by a brachet, and he is much grieved by her. The lady believed him and said that the man who killed her husband was much wounded. Launcelot asked his name and she replied it was Gilbert the Bastard. Launcelot wished her comfort and left. He departed and entered the forest again, and there he met Meliot's sister who knew him well, and said that she was looking for him, to help her brother who fought with Sir Gilbert and was wounded, and according to a sorceress he would be cured only with a special cloth and sword that a knight should find in the Chapel Perilous. Launcelot asked her brother's name, who was Meliot de Logres whom he knew as a fellow of the Round Table. The damsel directed him to the highway to find the Chapel, as she will wait for him. (6,xiv)\n\nHe reached the chapel, dismounted and tied his horse to a little gate. Entering the churchyard he saw in the front of the chapel many shields which he had seen borne before by their knights, turned upside-down, and by him were 30 great knights in black, ready to fight, grinning and gnashing at him. Seeing their countenance he was afraid and put his shield before him and had his sword ready; as he was about to go through them, they scattered on either side to let him pass, and he took courage. Inside the chapel only a dim lamp was burning and Gilbert's corpse hilled with a silk cloth. Launcelot stooped down and cut a piece, and felt fear as if the earth trembled a little. He took also a fair sword laying by the corpse and ran outside. (6,xv)\n\nIn the yard the knights commanded him with a grimly voice to drop the sword or he'd die. He responded that they should fight to see whether he lives or dies with no big words. Right so he passed throughout them. Beyond the chapelyard she met Launcelot and told him to leave the sword behind or he'd die for it which Launcelot refused. She confirmed that if he did so, he would never see Guenever again, and Launcelot said he'd be a fool if he did. Then she requested to kiss her but once, which he refused. She admitted that she did he did so he'd die and she'd have his balmed corpse with her; she desired him for 7 years and ordained all this for him and Gawaine; she would love and serve his body, as she couldn't have him alive, but now she lost all her labour. Launcelot blessed himself and took his horse and left. He returned to Meliot's sister who was happy to see him and together rode to a castle thereby where Meliot lay and anon he recognised him, pale as the earth. Meliot begged him to save him. Launcelot leapt to him and touched his wounds with the sword, then wiped them with the cloth. Meliot was healed and there was great joy between them and celebrated.\n\nThe next morning he took his leave and bade Meliot to go to Arthur's court soon at Pentecost, where he can find him, and they departed. (6,xv) He rode through many strange countries, over marshes and valleys, and as he passed beyond a fair castle, 2 bells rang, and a falcon flew over his head toward a high elm to take perch and the long lunes about its feet over-cast about a bough; and when it attempted to fly again, it hung by the legs and Launcelot was sorry to see it. Then a lady came out of the castle and cried to Launcelot to help her fetch her hawk or her lord would destroy her. Launcelot asked her lord's name and she said he was Phelot. As the lady knew his name and required his knighthood, he promised to help her, although he is an ill climber and the tree was very high with few boughs. He dismounted and asked the lady to disarm him, he put off all his clothes unto his shirt and breech and climbed up; he tied the lines to a great rotten branch and threw it down to the lady. Phelot came out of the groves all armed with sword in hand and stood at the bole of the tree to slay him. Launcelot condemned their treason for wanting to kill an unarmed man and asked him to hang his sword upon a bough with his harness so that he can fight honorably, but Phelot refused. As they stayed there, Launcelot noticed a rownsepyk, a big leafless bough, and broke it off and came lower and when his horse stood by, he leapt on its further side. Phelot lashed at him but Launcelot blocked him with the rownsepyk, and smote him on the head; as Phelot fell down, Launcelot took his sword and cut his neck; the lady cried in distress and Launcelot replied the shame of their treachery fell on both, and she swooned. He got his armour as well as he could, fearing that others might come from Phelot's castle and rode away. (6,xvi)\n\nHe continued throughout marches and many wild ways. In a valley he saw a knight, Sir Pedivere, chasing his wife to slay her, and she cried for help. Seeing this, Launcelot rode between them, and chastised the knight for shaming himself and all knights. The knight said that he wills lay her anyway. Launcelot forbid him and warned that he will fight him. The knight said that his wife betrayed him, but she denied it, but he is jealous of her cousin and asked Launcelot to save her, and Launcelot assured her, and the knight agreed to comply to him. Launcelot rode on the one side and the lady on the other for a while when Pedivere told him to look behind as they are chased and immediately he decapitated his wife. Seeing this Launcelot cursed him for shaming him, dismounted and pulled his sword to slay him, but he fell down and cried for mercy, which Launcelot refused and challenged him, but the knight said he won't rise until he gives him mercy. Launcelot offered to undress expect his shirt and sword but the knight still refused. Then he ordered Pedivere to take the body and head of his wife and swear upon his sword to bear it always on his back and seek Guenever to ask for judgement. Finally Launcelot asked his name and cursed the hour he was born. When Pedivere met Guenever, she said that it was a great rebuke unto Launcelot; but his worship is not known in many countries. (6,xvii)\n\n2 days before the feast of Pentecost Launcelot returned home (perhaps in Camelot) and Arthur and the court were happy to see him. Gawaine, Uwain, Sagramore and Ector saw it was Launcelot in Kay's armour who had smote them and they smiled and laughed to each other. Then the former prisoners of Turquine came and honored Launcelot. Gaheris said to Arthur about the battle, and Kay how he saved his life and had his adversaries yield to him, and let his harness to him to ride safely. Raynold, Gaunter and Gilmere were also there and were glad to see that they were defeated by Launcelot. And Meliot also said how he saved his life. The story with the 4 sorceress queens was known, and his deeds in the tournament. Then came Belleus and his lady and Launcelot requested to be made knight of the Round Table. And so at that time Sir Launcelot had the greatest name of any knight of the world, and he was most honoured. (6,xviii)"
