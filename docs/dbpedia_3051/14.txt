King Baudouin of Belgium, Europe’s longest-reigning monarch, died of a heart attack while on holiday in Spain. “The nation is in mourning,” said Belgian radio in opening remarks broadcasting news of the death of the 62-year-old monarch. Baudouin, known as “le roi triste” (The Sad King) by his subjects, occupied the throne for 42 years. His reign began in July 1951 after his father Leopold III abdicated. Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene flew to Granada, in southern Spain, to accompany Baudouin’s widow, Queen Fabiola, on the Belgian air force flight bringing the king’s body back to Brussels.Successor Belgium’s Prince Philippe, a shy and reserved man, is widely expected to take over the throne of his uncle Baudouin. King Baudouin and his wife Queen Fabiola had no children.
