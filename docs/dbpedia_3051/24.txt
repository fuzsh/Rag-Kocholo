King Baudouin of Belgium died of heart failure Saturday while vacationing in Spain, a government spokesman said.

The king, 62, died in Motril, a town in southern Spain on the Mediterranean coast, said a spokesman for Spain's Ministry of the Presidency. The king and his wife, Queen Fabiola, had been vacationing there since July 22.

The Belgian news agency Belga quoted Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene as saying the king died about 9:30 p.m. after a cardiac arrest.

King Baudouin had been in ill health in recent years, undergoing heart surgery to repair a mitral valve in 1992.

Baudouin's 42 years as king began dramatically when he took over the throne from his disgraced father, Leopold III, who became unpopular after he refused government orders to leave Belgium in 1940.

Leopold's abdication catapulted Baudouin into a job for which, at age 20, he was unprepared.

Over the years, he became a unifying force in a country marked by deep linguistic divisions.

Baudouin gained the reputation of being scrupulously impartial in dealing with disputes between his Flemish- and French-speaking populations.

Though only a ceremonial king, Baudouin played a stabilizing role in the disputes between the groups.

The monarch's body was to be flown to Belgium immediately, the Spanish government spokesman said.

Prince Philippe, his nephew, is next in line for the throne. The king had no children.
