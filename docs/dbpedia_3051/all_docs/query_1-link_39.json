        "text": "Tens of thousands of Belgians bid farewell to King Baudouin Saturday as fighter jets flew over the palace in a final salute and royalty from around the world joined in a funeral procession.\n\nBaudouin's casket - covered by Belgium's red, yellow and black flag - was taken from the downtown palace where the monarch worked during his 42-year reign.As fighter jets flew overhead, the coffin was placed on a gun carriage and pulled by an armored personnel carrier to St. Michael's cathedral, 900 yards away.\n\nQueen Fabiola - who wore a white suit and had asked those attending the funeral not to wear black or come veiled - followed on foot. She led a group of heads of state for a slow-paced, one-hour walk to the cathedral on a warm, sunny day. Tens of thousands lined the funeral route.\n\nThose joining her included Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko of Japan, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, King Juan Carlos and Queen Sophia of Spain, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, Grand Duke Jean and Grand Duchess Josephine-Charlotte of Luxembourg, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia.\n\nBaudouin died July 31 of a heart attack while vacationing in Spain."
