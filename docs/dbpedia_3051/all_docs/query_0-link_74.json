        "text": "KING LEOPOLD, owing to some\n\ncause which has not yet\n\nbeen explained, lost control of the\n\ncar while he was driving on the\n\nroad beside the lake at Kuss-\n\nnacht. The vehicle swerved into\n\na belt of trees alongside the lake,\n\nand the Queen, who was sharing\n\nthe front seat with the King, was\n\nkilled instantly.\n\nThe chauffeur, who was in the\n\nrear seat, escaped injury.\n\nAccording to another version of the\n\ntragedy the Queen (formerly Princess\n\nAstrid of Sweden) was alone in the\n\nback seat of the car at the time of\n\nthe occurrence, and she experienced\n\nthe full force of the impact with the\n\ntree.\n\nLater details suggest that the car\n\nhad not recovered its direction after it\n\nhad negotiated a sharp curve on a nar-\n\nrow road at the water's edge.\n\nKing Leopold and Queen Astrid had\n\nbeen spending a holiday of some\n\nweeks' duration in the Swiss and Ital-\n\nian Alps. They had just visited Dolo-\n\nmite Peak (in the Tyrol), where there\n\nis a tablet commemorating the late\n\nKing's Albert's feat in having ascended\n\nthe peak.\n\nTheir Majesties had been staying at\n\na villa near Lucerne. After King Leo-\n\npold's wounds had been bandaged he\n\nwas taken back to the villa, to which\n\nplace the body of Queen Astrid was\n\nalso removed.\n\nSTORY OF EYE-WITNESS\n\nAn eye-witness states that the car\n\nwas travelling at 30 miles an hour,\n\nwhen it suddenly skidded, hit a small\n\nembankment a foot high, and re-\n\nbounded against a tree.\n\nThe Queen was thrown through the\n\nwindow of the car. She was terribly\n\ncut, and her skull was fractured.\n\nThe car, with the King still clinging\n\nto the wheel, ran into a small field,"
