        "text": "Baudouin I, the King of Belgium for 42 years and one of the more reclusive of Europe's dwindling monarchs, died yesterday while vacationing in Motril, a town in the province of Granada in southern Spain. He was 62.\n\nA spokesman for the Spanish Government attributed the death to a heart attack. The king had been in ill health for two years, having undergone prostate surgery in 1991 and an open-heart operation last year. Baudouin was the fifth king of the Belgians.\n\nShy, ever one to shun the dramatic, Baudouin (pronounced bode-WANN) was never a star player on the European political or social stage. He came to power in Brussels at the age of 20 after the abdication of his father, King Leopold 3d. Rarely Seen in Public\n\nKing Baudouin and Queen Fabiola were something of an enigma, as they were rarely seen in public, gave few speeches, and avoided the glitter and pomp enjoyed by many of Europe's other royals.\n\nEven his ascent to the monarchy came under a cloud since Leopold had been widely criticized for surrendering Belgium to the Nazis when German forces slashed through the country in 1940.\n\nThe King leaves no direct heir. Next in line to the throne is Prince Albert, Baudouin's brother, yet officials in Brussels said he has been expected to offer it to his eldest son, Philippe.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
