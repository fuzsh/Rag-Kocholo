Our activities aim to foster sustainable and positive change in society, in Belgium, Europe and around the world.\n\nThanks to the support we give, we empower organisations and citizens working to create a better society. We accompany philanthropists and donors (individuals, companies, or organisations) wishing to take action for the common good on any continent and in any area of the general interest, notably through our founding membership of the Myriad alliance for borderless giving.\n\nThe King Baudouin Foundation has at its disposal its own capital. Its independent governing bodies represent the pluralism of society."
