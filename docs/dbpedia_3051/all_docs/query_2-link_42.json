        "text": "For such a small country, Belgium has been a major European battleground over the centuries.\n\nOccupied by Germany during both world wars, it experienced an economic boom in the post-war years to become a model Western European liberal democracy.\n\nHowever, there has also been a growing divide between the mainly Dutch-speaking north and the mainly French-speaking south, as well as concerns about the growth of Islamic extremism among immigrant communities in the capital, Brussels.\n\nBrussels is the headquarters of the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato), making it the polyglot home of an army of international diplomats and civil servants.\n\nKing Philippe succeeded to the throne in July 2013 on the abdication of his father, Albert II, who stepped down on health grounds.\n\nRespect for the monarchy is one of the few factors that crosses the communal divide in Belgium, and King Albert exercised his constitutional authority in advising political leaders on the formation of a government during the 2010-2011 parliamentary stalemate.\n\nPrime minister: Alexander De Croo\n\nSome key dates in Belgium's history:\n\n1830 - Declaration of independence from Netherlands.\n\n1914-18 World War One: Germany invades and conquers majority of the country, the Belgian army withdraws and holds its position behind Yser river until 1918.\n\n1920 - Belgium abandons neutrality and signs military alliance with France.\n\n1930 - Flanders and Wallonia legally become unilingual regions.\n\n1940 - World War Two.

Government pledges to invest in renewable energy sources and gas.\n\n2004 - Child killer Marc Dutroux sentenced to life for rape and murder of several young girls. His conviction comes eight years after his arrest and follows complex investigations.\n\nHigh court rules far-right Vlaams Blok racist and strips it of funding and TV access rights, forcing it to disband.

Thirty-two people are killed and more than 300 injured.\n\n2021 - Devastating floods hit parts of western Europe.
