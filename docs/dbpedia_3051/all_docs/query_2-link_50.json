        "text": "For centuries, from the invasion of the Franks in the 5th century to the installation of the Dukes of Burgundy in the 14th century, Belgium was the scene of numerous confrontations.\n\nShared on many occasions and placed under various influences, it was only in 1830 that Belgium found its own identity with the declaration of its independence.\n\nGrand Place, Brüssel © TBFB\n\n1831 Leopold I of Saxe-Coburg becomes the first sovereign.\n\n1865-1909 Reign of Leopold II marked by colonial conquests in Africa.\n\n1914 Despite its neutrality, Belgium is invaded by Germany.\n\n1925 Locarno Agreements: Belgium sees its borders with Germany guaranteed.\n\n1940-1945 New occupation of the territory by German troops.\n\n1944 Customs union signed with Luxembourg and the Netherlands.\n\n1949 Belgium joins NATO.\n\n1951 Heavily criticised for his rapid surrender to the Germans, Leopold III abdicates in favour of his son Baudouin I.\n\n1957 Belgium is a founding member of the EEC.\n\n1977 The Egmont Pact divides Belgium into three relatively independent regions.\n\n1993 The new Constitution officially establishes a federal country made up of three regions: the Flemish Region, the Walloon Region and Brussels-Capital.\n\n1993 Death of Baudouin I. His brother Albert succeeds him.\n\n1999 The President of the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD), Guy Verhofstadt, is the new Belgian Prime Minister, a position he retains after the 2003 parliamentary elections.\n\n2007 Guy Verhofstadt resigns in June following the parliamentary elections. Since then, Belgium has been without a government. The Flemish and Walloon political parties are negotiating the formation of a new coalition government.\n\n2008 On 20 March Yves Leterme becomes Prime Minister and sets up a government based on a grand coalition. On 30 December, Herman van Rompuy is appointed Prime Minister.\n\n2010 At the end of April, the Leterme government resigns. However, Yves Leterme remains Head of Government. In June, in the advanced parliamentary elections, the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) under Bart de Wever wins in Flanders (28%) while the Socialists (35%) under Elio di Rupo wins in Wallonia. In September, the pre-negotiations for the formation of the government by Elio di Rupo fail. On 21 October, King Albert II appoints the Flemish Socialist Johan Vande Lanotte as the new mediator to try to bring the country out of the crisis.\n\n2011 At the end of January the mediator Johan Vande Lanotte resigns. In July, Belgium “celebrates” the 400 days without a government.\n\n2019 Charles Michel is appointed President of the European Council.\n\nIt all began in 1929, when Georges Rémi (Hergé) scribbles the first lines of Tintin, a little reporter who was going to go around the planet… and even be the first man on the Moon! In 1938, the Belgian publisher Dupuis launched the weekly magazine “Spirou”. This was another important step in the history of comics, as this newspaper became a real school for Belgian cartoonists. The enormous success it achieved was emulated by Franquin and his “Gaston”, Peyo and “Les Schtroumpfs”, Morris and “Lucky Luke”. As for the “Journal de Tintin”, in which authors such as Edgar P. Jacobs, creator of “Blake et Mortimer”, Jacques Martin of “Alix”, Greg of “Achille Talon”, Tibet and André-Paul Duchâteau of “Ric Hochet”, and Jean Roba, author of “Boule et Bill”, collaborated, it was created in 1946 by Raymond Leblanc. Today, Belgian comics are still as exciting and varied as ever. Amongst the talented cartoonists and scriptwriters, let’s mention : Jean Van Hamme and Philippe Francq with “Largo Winch”, Tome and Janry “Le petit Spirou”, Yves Swolfs with “Durango” as well as Philippe Geluck and his inénarrable “Chat”. Brussels is undoubtedly the capital of comics, with its Belgian comic strip centre and numerous murals spread throughout the city.\n\nBelgisches Comicmuseum © TBFB"
