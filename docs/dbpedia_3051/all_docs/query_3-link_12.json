It's believed that the mix-up was simply caused by someone having mistaken the hand-writing of 'Leopard' with 'Leopold'. It was an honest mistake, but I believe the valet got a sharp talking to, or at least certainly recieved typed instructions thereafter.\n\nI doubt that such a mistake would have drawn much attention from the other guests, many of who were wearing the Order of Leopold I. It was a rather unexpected death, and most would have been more concerned with HM King Albert and HM Queen Fabiola.\n\nRoyal Fan\n\nHeir Presumptive\n\nJoined\n\nSep 19, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n2,323\n\nCity\n\nMonterey\n\nCountry\n\nUnited States\n\nWonder if Albert II Will have a Funeral as Large as this just wondering (I Wish him many years)\n\nLadyLeana\n\nRoyal Blogger, TRF Author\n\nJoined\n\nJun 1, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n1,270\n\nCity\n\n-\n\nCountry\n\nBelgium\n\nNo, it was each individual's personal choice.\n\nThat's not true, I'm afraid.\n\nIt was Fabiola's special request that nobody should wear black or hats. Unfortunately, some did not comply. Probably because she made them all walk behind the coffin towards the church\n\nQueen Fabiola wore white clothes because she wanted to give a message of hope. She did not want to mourn his death, but celebrate his life.\n\nBoudewijn was, at that time, the longest reigning monarch in Europe, so many people knew him, and many important people came to his funeral to pay their respects.\n\nlucien\n\nMajesty\n\nJoined\n\nJun 19, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n7,628\n\nCity\n\nAmsterdam\n\nCountry\n\nNetherlands\n\n16 Years ago today,HM died in Motril at the \"Villa Astrida\".\n\nIt was incomprehensible that he had died that sunday(july 31st was a sunday in 1993),and it absolutely was unbelieveble and moving to watch the genuine mourning for this deeply loved and respected Monarch,the long lines waiting to pay their respect,day and night.\n\nThe Monarchs of this world came to pay their respects at the funeral,all of them,even Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko,and,a rare occasion,HM Queen Elisabeth II was present at the St.Michiel and St.Gudele Cathedral in Brussels that saturday of the funeral.\n\nfraxales\n\nGentry\n\nJoined\n\nSep 7, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n73\n\nCity\n\nCape Town\n\nCountry\n\nSouth Africa\n\nGee, I can't believe it was so long ago; I seem to remember the wearing of white being requested by the late King (something about not mourning his death). Also, requests like these are not necessarily heeded mostly due to so many different cultures, traditions and customs coming together - you cannot expect the Empress of Japan and the Queen of England not to wear a hat, nor will a Muslim lady attend such a function without a headcovering of sorts.\n\nAlso, they are not forced to follow the coffin to church - it is tradition throughout much of Europe; the same happened in Oslo for the funeral of King Olav V in what I believe were sub-zero temperatures!\n\nMarengo\n\nAdministrator\n\nJoined\n\nAug 13, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n27,573\n\nCity\n\nSão Paulo\n\nCountry\n\nBrazil\n\nA clip from youtube, showing some guests:\n\nBeroemde gasten op de uitvaart van Koning Boudewijn - YouTube\n\ncomplete funeral:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj_QMeLBmIo\n\nLast edited: Jan 23, 2014\n\nMbruno\n\nMajesty\n\nJoined\n\nMay 17, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n9,707\n\nCity\n\nPittsburgh\n\nCountry\n\nUnited States\n\nNobody knows about him?? I think Baudouin and his wife Fabiola were one of the most popular king and queens of Europe...\n\nHe died om July 31, 1993 in his summer residence in the south of Spain.\n\nHis funeral was great, and even the British Queen Elizabeth II came to this funeral (and she often leaves her country for a funeral or wedding).\n\nKing Baudouin was (correct me if I'm wrong):\n\nThe brother of Grand Duchess Joséphine Charlotte of Luxembourg.\n\nFirst cousin to King Harald V or Norway.\n\nSecond cousin to Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.\n\nSecond cousin once removed to King Carl XVi Gustaf of Sweden and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (Note: not sure)\n\nThird cousin to Queen Elizabeth II of the UK and Queen Sofia of Spain.\n\nThat also explains why some many royals were in attendance.\n\nLast edited: Oct 11, 2015\n\nMarengo\n\nAdministrator\n\nJoined\n\nAug 13, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n27,573\n\nCity\n\nSão Paulo\n\nCountry\n\nBrazil\n\nI think it is pretty normal that all European monarchs -save the British one- show up at the funeral of another reigning monarch. The only surprise is the attendance of the British queen, who made an exception this time as it was summer holiday and it looked bad if she didn't go.\n\nIt was a great honour that the emperor and empress of Japan attended the funeral; which was partly due to the friendship of the two couples.\n\nI still remember the utter shock that the death of the king was. There was an enormous and dignified grief in Belgium, without the hysterics. Hundreds of thousands tried to pay their last respects and the palace had to stay open till the early hours of the night. People were standing in line for hours & hours in the hot August weather, many fainted due to the heat. I also remember the speculation of the succession, which did not seem clear in the press as it was expected that Philippe would succeed his uncle and that Albert would step aside. A scenario that would have been more likely if the king had lived longer.\n\nNotable absentee was the princess de Rethy.\n\nLast edited: Oct 12, 2015"
