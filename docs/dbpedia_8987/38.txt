Botch are heading to Australia

Botch, a groundbreaking American mathcore band hailing from Tacoma, Washington, burst onto the music scene in the early 1990s. Formed in 1993, the group comprised guitarist Dave Knudson, bassist Brian Cook, drummer Tim Latona, and vocalist Dave Verellen. Botch swiftly gained recognition for their unique blend of hardcore punk, metal, and math rock, crafting a sound that was both intricate and tumultuous.

During the mid-1990s, Botch unveiled their debut EP, “Faction,” in 1995, followed by “The John Birch Conspiracy Theory” in 1996, showcasing their raw energy and technical prowess. These releases set the stage for their full-length debut, “American Nervoso,” in 1998, marking a pivotal moment for the band with its intricate guitar work, unconventional time signatures, and Verellen’s distinctive vocals.

Botch’s music was distinguished by dissonant riffs, unpredictable song structures, and an unrelenting intensity that set them apart in the realms of mathcore and metalcore. Their unorthodox approach to songwriting and performance proved influential, inspiring numerous bands to push the boundaries of musical expression.

A standout achievement for Botch was their 1999 album, “We Are the Romans,” often hailed as a landmark in the mathcore genre. This release showcased the band’s technical prowess, pushing the boundaries of heavy music and solidifying their status as pioneers in the hardcore scene.

Despite critical acclaim, internal struggles led to Botch disbanding in 2002. The members pursued diverse musical projects, with Knudson joining the successful post-rock band Minus the Bear, and Cook becoming the bassist for the renowned metal band Russian Circles.

In the aftermath of their breakup, Botch’s influence continued to grow, shaping the landscape for new generations of bands citing them as a major inspiration. Their impact transcended musical contributions, playing a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of heavy and experimental music.

In 2006, Hydra Head Records released “An Anthology of Dead Ends,” a retrospective compilation featuring unreleased tracks, demos, and live recordings, providing fans with a comprehensive look at Botch’s discography. This compilation served as a testament to the enduring legacy and influence Botch had on the hardcore and metal scenes.

In 2020, Botch surprised fans with the announcement of a reunion tour to celebrate the 20th anniversary of “We Are the Romans.” Despite disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, the announcement revitalized interest in the band’s music, reaffirming their position as pioneers in the heavy music realm.

Botch’s impact on the hardcore and metal genres remains significant, their innovative approach to composition and performance continuing to inspire musicians across various musical landscapes. The band’s legacy lives on through their influential recordings and the enduring admiration of fans who appreciate their unique and groundbreaking contributions to heavy music.

Fast forward to May 2024, and the legendary mathcore pioneers, Botch, are gearing up for an electrifying Australian tour. This tour marks Botch’s first-ever venture onto Australian soil, promising an extraordinary experience for fans Down Under.

As Botch brings their unparalleled live performance to Australian shores, fans can expect a sonic adventure, transcending the ordinary and reaffirming the band’s enduring legacy. Don’t miss the chance to be part of history as Botch makes their mark in the heart of Australia.
