        "text": "A lot can happen in two decades, but Botch touring the nation wasn’t supposed to be one of those things. Until now. The Pacific Northwest thrashcore (is that a word?) quartet got thousands of nearing-into-middle age metal fans abuzz when this tour announcement dropped, and as luck would have it, Boston got the crown jewel of the entire tour.\n\nDepending on Nate Newton’s onstage musings about the first time meeting Botch, which was in a basement show in Milwaukee or Madison in 1997, or Brian Cook’s recollection that it was a house show in Norfolk, Virginia that was accompanied by an unplanned fire the year before, it really doesn’t matter. These bands have a lot of history together, and the bonds forged between the Hydra Head/Deathwish collective cannot be diminished by time."
