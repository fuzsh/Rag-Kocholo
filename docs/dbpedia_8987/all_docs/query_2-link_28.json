        "text": "Today, I want to take a look back at another of the many, many excellent bands my friend Rachel introduced to me back in the late 90s. Last year, I reflected on Lozenge, a fantastic band of musicians that I first heard on a mix-tape she made for me while I lived in Toledo. That same tape was packed with other incredible songs, one of which was from a NW hardcore band calling themselves Botch. I can’t exactly recall which tune it was, but I was hooked. It was thick as a brick sounding, boiling over with attitude and aggression, musically challenging, and memorable. I immediately took to the world wide web to learn more about this band and discovered they were on Hydrahead Records and were either about to release or had just released We Are The Romans. When I got that album in the mail, I was even further blown away. This band was right up my alley – savage heaviness with originality, artistic vision, and unbridled chaos. It fit right in with the Deadguy and Dillinger Escape Plan records I was jamming at the time. I went on to pick up American Nervoso (some used bin?) and An Anthology Of Dead Ends (pre-order from HH), and was in love with all of it.\n\nBotch was formed in 1993 in Tacoma, Washington while the guys were all in high school. Drummer Tim Latona was involved with jazz styles at the time, and was approached by guitarist Dave Knudson to jam. They recruited Brian Cook to play bass, and found Dave Verellen to handle vocals, allegedly because he couldn’t play any other instrument.\n\nThe group’s early output was more along the lines of straight-edge hardcore stuff, before the angular influence of bands like Helmet and Drive Like Jehu took hold. After just a few years, the band had evolved into the beast with which I had fallen in love. They toured Canada, they toured the States.. they did so with little support from anyone, until catching the ear of Aaron Turner (Isis, OMG, Sumac, etc.) at Hydra Head records, who ultimately signed them and went on to release their two LPs and the final “EP-by-default” that was entitled “An Anthology Of Dead Ends.” The band garnered tons of critical praise, but little commercial success during their prime, despite tours with bands like DEP, Jesuit, Blood Brothers, and more. They officially broke up in 2002 due to creative strife within the band. “An Anthology Of Dead Ends” cataloged what material the band was able to craft before dissolution. I never got to see them live. Bummer.\n\nThe members of Botch have gone on to play in other notable bands. Knudson founded well-known indie-rockers, Minus The Bear. Cook went on to found These Arms Are Snakes, joined established rockers Russian Circles, and most recently joined Sumac with Aaron Turner and the drummer from Baptists. Verellen fronted Narrows. The amount of talent and creativity in this band was awesome.\n\nThere is a short-list of bands I would drive hours to see reunited (going to Detroit to see Refused a few years back, for example), but Botch is definitely on there. With any luck, maybe that will happen someday.\n\nThe Unifying Themes Of Sex, Death, And Religion (1996) – A compilation of earlier releases, this record features material from the John Birch Conspiracy Theory and Faction EPs, later re-issued to include additional material from splits and other compilations. I never officially got a copy of this, but I did get copies of the songs from somewhere. The band’s take on O Fortuna is killer, and historically credited for catching Turner’s ear all those years ago and inspiring him to work with the band. I’ll also forever love their cover of the B-52s Rock Lobster that appears on later issues of this album. This is a solid collection of tunes, for sure, but shows the band not-yet fully forged into what they would become.\n\nAmerican Nervoso (1998) – The album kicks off with a riff that would make Paige Hamilton proud and digs its claws in from there. Hooks, windy riffs, massive head-bangers… this record packs quite a punch and I love it. The down-tuned chugging sounds so gnarly on this record, and that’s just one dimension of this multi-faceted release. I didn’t get a full copy of this record until probably 2002 or so, but even then, 4 years after it’s release, it sounded fresh and honest. The band tears through riffs and ideas with brutal efficiency, but doesn’t forget to include the hooks that makes it all “sing” in my ears. The first three cuts alone kick more butt than many lesser bands could ever dream, and there’s still six more tracks of awesome after that. Highlights are tough since the whole dang thing rips so hard, but Dali’s Praying Mantis has always been a personal favorite of mine.\n\nWe Are The Romans (1999) – This record is most often cited as the band’s high water mark, and for good reason. This thing is a juggernaut of rock and roll might. This was the first Botch album I bought and it kicked my ass from day one. Listen to the winding riff that opens the record (To Our Friends In The Great White North) and try not to find yourself writhing in spastic delight. This record is so pissed and catchy and HEAVY! Dang, now I want to sit down in front of a ripping stereo and let this thing just tear into me. This is one of my all time favorites, and I can listen to it start to finish anytime, any place, anywhere. The band did a great job of mixing up moods and styles on this album, covering a ton of territory and excelling the entire time. Again, it’s hard to point out highlights, but the opener, Transitions From Persona To Object, C. Thomas Howell As The Soul Man, and Man The Ramparts have always floored me. This is a bona fide masterpiece!"
