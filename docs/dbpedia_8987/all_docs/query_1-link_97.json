        "text": "Florida hardcore band Colonial Wound released a new EP last week with New Morality Zine called, Degradation. It’s three tracks of headrushing punk, strung together with manically contortive grooves and propelled by a fateful, plunging rhythm that invokes the dread of tripping down the gullet of an open elevator shaft.\n\nThey’ve been favorably compared to post-metal bands like Isis, and while perhaps this is spiritually appropriate, their sound has a metallic edge to it that brings them into the company of late ’90s metalcore like Converge, Botch, and early Cave In.\n\nWhen I first heard Degradation, it blew my puny, little brain like an ape witnessing electricity arching between contact points for the first time. I knew I needed to chat with the band, and so I reached out with some inquiries. I hope you enjoy reading the band’s responses and listening to their new record. They’re a very genuine and talented group of people who deserve a few minutes of your attention today.\n\nYou can stream and buy Degradation below and keep scrolling to read our exclusive interview with the band:\n\nDegradation by COLONIAL WOUND\n\nInterview conducted via email on April 28, 2021. It has been edited slightly for the sake of clarity.\n\nWhat was the starting point for writing and recording your new EP, Degradation?\n\nWhen Jeremy came into the fold, really. We just wrote until we felt as though we had a strong set of songs. We were pretty eager to showcase material that included Jeremy, and we felt good about the feel of these three songs as a quick and powerful listen.\n\nWhere did the image on the cover come from?\n\nIt was a painting that Carl (Auge) had already done, so we picked it from what he told us was available. We were pretty mesmerized by the colorway and overall feel and it went well with the overall theme of the EP.\n\nWhat moods and ideas are you attempting to give life to on this release?\n\nPushing people to do a better job at recognizing the degradation of things due to our inability to take a step back and look at the big picture. Personally, societally, just the general problem we seem to have of failing to be inwardly and outwardly reflective.\n\nYou seem to have more control over the direction these songs are headed when compared to previous releases, is this something you worked towards, or is it a conscience of your becoming more comfortable playing together and working together as musicians?\n\nThank you. I think our comfort level is part of it, yeah. Kind of just realizing where we wanted to take this and what we all wanted out of it. We still write in a very “free” way, but we just have a better overall idea of where it should all go.\n\nHow did you get connected with New Morality Zine in Chicago?\n\nNick actually approached us to press Untitled on vinyl in early 2020. We were already moving on doing that with Eric at Dropping Bombs. When we finished up recording Degradation, we were thinking of who might be interested in releasing it so we reached out to Nick and he was into the idea. We’ve been pretty fortunate with the two people/labels we’ve teamed up with to release our music thus far. They’ve both gone above and beyond to make these releases special.\n\nI’ve heard comparisons of your material to Isis and Pelican? Do you see your style of hardcore as having points of overlap with those kinds of post-metal bands?\n\nSomewhat, yeah. I recognize that there’s some parts that give off post-metal-ish vibes but that definitely isn’t the focus. At the same time, we don’t intentionally avoid touching on stuff like that either. Really depends on what the songwriting calls for. We have backgrounds in that style, so it definitely bleeds through but, our focus is more rooted in the chaotic side of things. In our mind, we’re a hardcore band by nature of approach.\n\nTo what extent does post-metal overlap with hardcore in your mind, if at all? Who are the key bands in this regard?\n\nPersonally, I get different things from each, but I don’t think of them as being too far off from one another. Stuff in that arena that I hold in high regard would be bands like Knut, Coalesce, Harkonen, etc.\n\nFor those who don’t live there, can you tell us how surviving the pandemic has been for you in Florida? How much of a help has the state government been during this ordeal?\n\nIt’s mostly just been fending for yourself. Being smart about where you’re going, what you’re doing, and taking the proper precautions. The state government hasn’t done much in terms of financial aid to those out of work, our governor really shit the bed on having any sort of plan of any kind. It’s basically just been a free-for-all. It’s been tough to navigate but it just boils down to being smart about how you’re approaching everyday life.\n\nWhen venues start opening up by you, what do you expect to be different? What do you hope will be the same?\n\nI expect a greater appreciation for the experience of seeing bands in a live setting from most. I hope we are able to safely go back to how everything used to be, but with a stronger emphasis on actually supporting bands so that underground music can thrive. Some areas are better at this than others, so this statement isn’t all-encompassing but, I sincerely hope that people can recognize the importance of going to shows, paying for music, buying merch, and just being better at doing their part in being supportive.\n\nAny final thoughts for our readers?\n\nBe kind to one another.\n\nBuy Degradation from New Morality Zine here."
