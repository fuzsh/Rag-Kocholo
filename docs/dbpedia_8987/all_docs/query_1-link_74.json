We do not accept cancelations or exchanges on the following: Products benefitting charitable organizations, face masks, items tagged final run/sale, free or promotional items, any items damaged during shipping or opening, make-up, perishable goods, items washed, worn or unsealed, including vinyl/CDs that have been opened.\n\nPre-Orders\n\nPre-ordering an album does not mean you'll receive it before the rest of the world. In fact, depending on where you live and the ship date, you may not get the album until after its official release date. All pre-order products will display an expected \"SHIPS ON OR AROUND\" date in the product description, which is subject to change, due to unexpected delays, beyond our control. Additional items purchased on the same ticket as a pre-order will not ship until the time specified in the description of the pre-ordered item.\n\nFinal Run\n\nItems with the \"Final Run\" tag are not eligible for exchanges.\n\nVinyl & Posters\n\nVinyl records and posters are pristine when packed. Please be aware we DO NOT issue refunds or replacements for minor cosmetic damage, such as corner dings, bends, split inserts, and so on. We pack our vinyl and posters securely and carefully in custom crafted boxes and tubes, but in some cases this type of wear is simply unavoidable during transit.\n\nUS Orders\n\nDomestic orders take 1-2 business days to process, plus transit time.\n\nInternational Orders\n\nWe ship just about everywhere. International orders take 1-2 days to process, plus transit time. Please note international shipments can often be unreliable and most delays happen at customs offices. ALL international customers are subject to the laws, duties and taxes of their destination country. Hello Merch is not responsible for any items lost, stolen or damaged during domestic transit.\n\nUSPS Media Mail\n\nThis method is offered to US customers as an old school budget service for vinyl, but highly discouraged, as it poses a greater risk for delays and damage.
