        "text": "Mathcore outfit Botch have got a lot going on since their return last August. For starters, they released their first new song in two decades, then then they began touring the U.S., and now they’ve got their own ridiculous burger over at Kuma’s Corner. And now as they continue touring the U.S. until December at the latest, the band’s unveiled even more plans for live shows — only this time they’re going across the pond for “one last run” through the U.K. and Europe.\n\nAnnounced earlier today, the shows will run from March 8 in Prague and continue until their final stop in Athens, Greece. All along the way, the band will hit major points like Berlin, Paris, and London. Drummer Tim Latona said the planned run was an exciting prospect, as it’s been a very long time since Botch has been in those markets.\n\n“Going back to tour the EU and UK with Botch is absolutely the fulfilment of a multi-decade dream of mine. We’re so excited to share our music again with all of our fans!”\n\nTickets for the band’s U.K. and European tour dates are available right now.\n\nLater this month, on October 27, the band will release a remastered version of An Anthology of Dead Ends via Sargent House. Originally recorded and released in 2002 as the band’s de facto swan song, this new version will be available both digitally and on vinyl, should you decide to pre-order it through Sargent House.\n\nFor the full list of tour dates, both in the U.S. and abroad, can be found below.\n\nALL UK and EU BOTCH headline dates, 2024:\n\nMarch 8 – Prague, CZ – Meet Factory [Tickets]\n\nMarch 9 – Vienna, AT – Arena [Tickets]\n\nMarch 10 – Chemnitz, DE – AJZ [Tickets]\n\nMarch 12 – Berlin, DE – Festsaal Kreuzberg [Tickets]\n\nMarch 13 – Copenhagen, DK – Vega [Tickets]\n\nMarch 14 – Hamburg, DE – Uebel & Gefährlich [Tickets]\n\nMarch 15 – Brussels, BE – Botanique [Tickets]\n\nMarch 17 – Wiesbaden, DE – Schlachthof [Tickets]\n\nMarch 18 – Esch-Sur-Alzette, LUX – Rockhal [Tickets]\n\nMarch 19 – Paris, FR – Elysee Montmartre [Tickets]\n\nMarch 21 – Bristol, UK – Marble Factory [Tickets]\n\nMarch 22 – Manchester, UK – New Century Hall [Tickets]\n\nMarch 23 – London, UK – Electric Ballroom [Tickets]\n\nMarch 25 – Athens, GR – Gagarin 205 [Tickets]"
