        "text": "Revolution Hall, Portland, OR\n\n10/7/2023\n\nEven if you don’t know about Botch, you know about the bands that they were responsible. First, there are all of the other bands started by its members: guitarist Dave Knudson co-founded Minus the Bear; bassist Brian Cook has been in These Arms Are Snakes, Russian Circles and Sumac (who are opening for the reunited hardcore band’s triple-header at Revolution Hall); singer Dave Verellen adopts drumming duties in indie-folk group Roy, alongside Cook. Even outside of that, their specific blend of hardcore vocals, punishing rhythm section and highly technical guitar-worshipping of mathcore have influenced everyone from Dillinger Escape Plan and The Bled to more current bands like KEN mode and The Armed. The Tacoma group had last played back in 2002, but few bands ever really end forever anymore.\n\nTo say the crowd was excited is an understatement. Though they played a few Seattle dates earlier this year, and did a small tour in Europe and Japan, this was the official start of the band’s reunion tour. Though it’s probably kind of exhausting to play double-duty for a tour like this, Cook’s Sumac were the perfect opener for the show, their set sequenced as a perfect lead-in to the main event; they started as more straightforward metal sound giving way to heavier, sludgier textures that felt capable of swallowing you whole if you allowed it. As the crowd filled in between sets, it was clear that this was going to be a rowdy night. For some shows, that can be exhausting — others, though, that rowdiness has the power to make it feel more like a religious experience, just sweaty bodies pressed against each other, united by the love of some powerful art.\n\nAny delusion that this would be a night of sweaty dudes headbanging while they stood watching the band were shattered almost immediately, as the crowd surged forward, pressing me against the barricade. The photographer next to me, who had been standing behind someone else, found himself directly next to me, thanks to the rogue wave of people reacting to “Spaim” from the band’s An Anthology of Dead Ends EP, the band’s final release (not counting posthumous live album 061502). They’d play the entirety of that EP over the course of the evening, as well as dipping into their two-album catalog of American Nervoso (1998) and We Are the Romans (1999), each song presenting more opportunities for Verellen to come to the edge of the stage to scream at the audience, causing them to surge forth yet again. It was, in short, beautiful chaos, and every song somehow feels a little more hard-hitting all these years later, purely because they now come with the confidence of two extra decades worth of experience across more than half a dozen bands.\n\nIt didn’t help that the band had one of the most disorienting light displays I’ve seen in quite some time. Blinding lights and punishing strobes spanned across essentially every song, and mixed with the heavy fog that lingered in the air, there were times when it became impossible to make out Cook or Verellen’s outlines as they stood towards the back of the stage. The sound, the lights, the fog and the crowd all came together to create a sensory assault that made it easy to oscillate between feeling repelled and seduced, especially in moments where the ripple of people getting shoved on the edge of the pit meant someone got domino-knocked into you.\n\n“This is the part where we’re going to go stand in the corner for a few minutes,” joked Verellen as they launched into set closer “Hutton’s Great Heat Engine.” When they came back, he reflected on one major change between the band that played their last show at Seattle’s Showbox in June of ‘02: “We used to not like to play in front of people ‒ we got nervous, so we had lots of bright lights and faced away from the audience.” The blinding lights remain, but when standing before a rapturous crowd screaming unambiguous statements like “YOU CHANGED MY LIFE, I LOVE YOU!,” it’s easy to imagine the nervousness that comes from facing the crowd just melting away. Midway through the set, they played “One Twenty Two,” their first new song since their original run. Will there be more from the band, or will they recede back into comfortable dormancy? Who knows — but hoping for more Botch, loaded with 20 years of confidence and wisdom, doesn’t seem all that unlikely."
