        "text": "The slow un-retirement of mathcore legends Botch continues to unfold before our very eyes, as the band has just announced that they’ll be hitting the road for the first time in 20 years and committing to a 14-date tour later this year.\n\nAs you may recall, the band began announcing reunion shows after releasing their first new song in two decades, “One Twenty Two.” It’s all been a very exciting series of events, if we’re being honest.\n\nNow, the newly announced tour will start with a three night stint in their hometown of Tacoma, Washington starting on February 17, before coming to an end on December 12 in San Francisco. While these aren’t their first shows back, that distinction goes to their sold out gig tomorrow night in Tacoma, but the tour promises to be a killer opportunity to see this band live.\n\nIn addition to the tour, the band will commemorate the 25th anniversary of their debut album American Nervoso by reissuing it on the date it was originally released, March 24, via Sargent House.\n\nBotch originally formed in 1993 in Tacoma, Washington. They released three EPs and two albums, including the boundary-obliterating We Are the Romans in 1999, which was also recently reissued.\n\nSo check out the dates below and get your tickets today. You don’t want to miss this one.\n\nBOTCH TOUR 2023"
