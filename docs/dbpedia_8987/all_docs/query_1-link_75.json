        "text": "Interview\n\nAMENRA\n\nMardi 14 mars 2006\n\n1.Hello pals, how is going AMEN RA since the new album \"Mass III\" is out?\n\nI guess you in front of nice success with such album? Distributed all over\n\nEurope and even in the States by Earache? Are you happy of all that\n\nhappenning to you?\n\nMaybe you ought to rephrase that question.’coz the deal with codebreaker is off.due to financial reasons (concerning the label). And therefore the deal with earache also went down the drain…\n\nTechnically the mass III album isn’t officially released yet, since the releasedate on HYPERTENSIONRECORDS is set on the 23rd of February..\n\nWe are really proud of what we have accomplished on this alsbum,the recording went really well and we were lucky to be able to work with zlaya hadzic, who mixed the record together with our own vince.\n\nI am really happy that we got the deal with our good friends of hypertension, that makes us labelmates with our friends of starkweather and red sparowes..\n\n2. Actually AMEN RA is on the road for a couple of years already. I\n\nremember have seen you for the first time on a show in a squat in Gent\n\nyears ago. That was already awesome. Next one was to open for great\n\nscreamo band FUNERAL DINER from the States in Frontline in Gent again. And\n\nnow you have made a mini tour with awesome PELLICAN (us) and are back from\n\na tour with veterans STARKWEATHER (us). Music has evolved through years to\n\nget deeply and darkly emotional but surely extremely heavy as fuck! Why\n\ncreating such music...From where comes that feeling od \"darkness\"?\n\nI don’t know really. It’s just there.\n\nDifferent mental states that a man endures during the process of life can be divided in extremes.either you’re happy or you’re unhappy.something in between is not worth mentioning, you know. people don’t think about life until they are confronted with one of those extremes.positive or negative..i suppose we picked that negative side to sing praises to…\n\nWhy?\n\nIt’s not like we made a decision to write dark n heavy music.it’s just what came out of our fingers.it’s us.\n\nThe music has always been deeply personal/emotional that never evolved..but the creative process hasn’t changed at all..\n\nChange is always..there is no point in not evolving. every human wants to evolve into something better…\n\n3. Actually how was both tour with PELLICAN (us) and STARKWEATHER (us)? We\n\ndon't see the band touring a lot outside of Belgium? Are you limited by\n\nthe fact you are working full-time job?\n\nYes and no.\n\nOnly now we feel that the time has come to look beyond the borders of our lil country.we weren’t working on a certain scheme or something that we had to to this or that.we just start with Belgium and move further away from home as time passes.there is no plan to quickly conquer Europe and then the world..\n\nWe don’t play all that often…that is why it took a while for the people here to get to know us, now that they have, it’s time to expand that territory, slowly but surely.\n\nThe full time jobs aren’t really the issue here.\n\n4. AMEN RA seems to be a very productive band untill now : \"Mass I\", split\n\nwith VUUR, the 4-way split CD on my label Heart On Fire with Impure Muzik\n\nand Recap Rec, the LP on Grave Escape Records, the \"sermons\" MCD, and now\n\nthe \"Mass III\". Have i forget something? What's next for the band? What's\n\nthe best records in all of that for you and why?\n\nYou haven’t forgotten anything my friend.\n\nPretty productive it’s okayit’s not like we ve been sitting still and doing nothing that’s true.\n\nWe released most of it by ourselves, coz we felt it was time to get those particular songs in the open.for every certain period there’s a certain mass that has to be held, stories to be told whatever..you know what I mean..\n\nNext?\n\nThere’s the official release of mass III, there’s a split with kortrijks HITCH coming on vlasvegas recs, probably a split with our friends of RISE AND FALL..maybe starkweather..and then off course by the end of 2006 we ll start recording for our mass IV album..\n\nI suppose every band likes their most recent work most, coz that is still close huh.you still remember the vibe of making those song in our lil rehearsal room. Wounds of the lyrics still hurt.i’d have to say mass III\n\n5. AMEN RA seems to pay a lot of attention the artwork stuff. Like the\n\ngreat one sided LP on Grave Escape and so on. Again all are very dark\n\nstuff. I guess some of you are working like graphist or so? Do you see an\n\nalbum like a full artie thing, from music to artwork?\n\nKjm our bassplayer is a graphic designer, does a zine called bats and has his own clothes brand called tête de mort.. I do most art direction for our artwork and kluze a close friend of ours does most of our artwork and designs..\n\n.yup music artwork lyrics everything.it’s a package deal.i feel we only get our message across when there s a clear message spoken.all those different aspects have to form a greater whole..\n\nEverything is so important to us..\n\n6. I've already witness something going around christian imagery in the\n\nvisuals and lyrics of AMEN RA. I mean cross, but with a crow on it. But\n\nalso title like \"am Kreuz\" (for Christ maybe?), \"ritual\", \"offerande\",\n\n\"sermons\", ... Even songs were called \"prayers\"...and in the lyrics we see\n\nsuch imagery used? Why? is there a special meaning? Or is it just a tool\n\nof expression?\n\nIt is a tool of expression indeed.the metaphors used in the bible or catholic religion are so strong and embody the sphere of the music so well, that it has become a part of the music through the years..the cross as a symbol for pain, martyrs..the dove nailed to the cross..symbolically the image of the highest for being a martyr for everything beneath him..\n\nLife is sacrifice.you give to receive.\n\nI am not catholic or whatever.but I do believe in life itself.everyone has to believe in themselves..that is why in a way.we are creating our own religion our own belief..we believe in life.in ourselves..\n\nI means a hell of a lot to us, but it’s all difficult to explain\n\n7. Collin, you seem to write deeply personal lyrics. Very dark, and kind\n\nof an outlet for depression or oppression? I had already witness such kind\n\nof lyrics when you were in SPINELESS...but here it is even more dark. I\n\nhad read a reason of it in the Semtex magazine...but am not sure if i can\n\nask it about you again?\n\nI am not a depressed human being. I look at everything in a realistic way.\n\nThe thing is I tend to absorb and reflect upon negative aspects of life more..\n\nI sing about the things that hurt you me everyone.i create a certain sphere that everyone want to get out as quick as possible. I sing about adversity.\n\nAnd no the fact that my dad died isn’t my only drive.millions of people lost loved ones.shitloads of people aren’t such a happy person as I am.well I empathise.i feel what we all feel.when we think we are the most pathetic person on earth.\n\nLike you said yourself.i sung like that in spineless that is ten years ago now.and I still sing like that.and I always will..\n\n8. Some of you were part of SPINELESS before. And you surely don't know\n\nbut i was big fan of your band? What do you think of it, regarding the\n\npast? Maybe you think it's funny i was fan of that band? I should put some\n\nold SPINELESS pics on ShootMeAgain maybe? Is the band still link to what\n\nwe could call the H8000? What's your felling about this? Are still\n\nstraight edge like xSPINELESSx ? (that one is a stupid one...who cares\n\nagain about being XXX today?)\n\nno I didn’t know you were a fan of spineless and I’m thankful for that.\n\nI do care about being sxe today.and no that’s not a stupid question.some of us have been sxe for over a decade now.and it’s not because we don’t x up or write songs about it anymore that we don’t support that certain lifestyle anymore.see .it isn’t important indeed to relationships with eachother.it’s not like we care about whos sxe and who s not in amenra.there are far more important things to keep ourselves busy with these days.\n\nWe are still linked to h8000 yes.because we ‘re still a bad from that h 8000 area.and since we’re still linked to the hc scene from time to time.people still stick that logo on us.it doesn’t bother me.i don’t care.\n\nI think it’s funny.the h 8000 crew was our crew when we were teenagers.it was really cool hanging out together then.when you’re that age.you need shit like that to identify with.you just want to be a part of something.you know.\n\nIt s funny..\n\n9. I've seen you two times playing in Liège...But that city seems to be a\n\nfucking bad experience for you on the two times? First one there was a\n\ncrusty drunken punk fucking up the show you played. And second one was on\n\nthe show with ENGINE DOWN (us)...A show I co-organized in a bad club\n\ncalled \"Phoenix\"...and that time the club organizers asked you always to\n\nturn down the volume...harrassing you all the time, and even cutting up\n\nenergy while playing. Would you play Liège again? ;-) Have you got such\n\nhorrible adventures in other places? We want bad stories...\n\nno only liege sucked hard ;)\n\nhaha\n\nwell.yeah the volume is always our big problem.\n\nI remember we played with ultraphallus.i’m glad I got to see em then.\n\nAnd yes of course we d love to play liege again.\n\n10. I read and heard you had played a show for a demonstration of\n\nunderwear by \"La Fille d'O\"? Wasn't it strange for you, playing hard and\n\nheavy music on a demonstration of girls in underwears? What was the\n\nfeedback you had there? What was the response you got from the scene after\n\nthat experience?\n\nWell.they hadn’t heard something like that before.eh.\n\nMurielle, who does the la fille do lingery line, is a good friend of ours and she asked if we wanted to do that.it was in the historical centre in an old postbuilding.it was a one in a life time opportunity to play there for us.plus it was a whole new audience for us.so why wouldn’t we.,?I never really saw what all happened I wasn’t really fonned of the idea but hey we did it…\n\nI was kinda weird.especially for the 12 girls how the fuck do you dance on amenra? I wouldn’t know…\n\n11. AMEN RA members are also part of other activities in the scene, or at\n\nleast music wise i guess? I think of BATS mag, Yoda zine maybe, sound\n\nengineering, etc etc. Please developp and promote your other activities?\n\nMathieu me and vince play in a sideproject called kingdom.it’s instrumental for now.\n\nVince does electronics in officer jones.he s a sound engineer producer makes your dvds whatever he does it all.matt n me are busy solo too.mondy like I said does bats zine with ape and has his own clothing line called la tête de mort\n\nMe and kjm are into art, and do art shows/exhibitions from time to time\n\n12. What are the bands that influence and have influence AMEN RA music?\n\nWho are your music gods? Some would say ISIS, NEUROSIS stuff but i would\n\nhave also read bands like BOTCH, and CONVERGE?\n\nFuck.everything and everyone that crosses my path and leaves me in awe…is my inspiration.life is our inspiration man.\n\nFuck.massive attack tool wovenhand you name it..\n\nYeah.maybe the main recaognisable ones are neurosis and isis.pelican switchblade..\n\nEverything we hear and see inspires us.it’s not like we make music with 5cd in our hands..\n\n13. You are all part of the hardcore scene for a while now...How do you\n\nsee the evolution of the Belgian hardcore scene? Stagnation? Evolution\n\nsince that H8000 vibe? Diversification? Boring?\n\nDiversification does the trick well…like I said some thing we’re still h8000 hc you know.the thing is we don’t belong anywhere anymore.and that is cool.it’s not like 9years ago where everyone was playing metalcore or whatever anymore.more subscenes thrive..\n\n14. You all seem to become kind of \"crazy\" while you play...Like if you\n\nwere only in your own world you create with the atmosphere you bring at\n\nthe show with music, and lights. But also i've witness Collin having his\n\nown moves when he sing...kind of animal move maybe? Very expressing...\n\nIs this all part of AMEN RA, part of a whole concept? Explain.\n\nI guess so it’s not like we have a choreography going on.you just let go.you know.it’s not like we have to jump on a certain part of song fuck that shit.\n\nWe close our eyes.and do or move wherever the fuck we wnat\n\n15. What AMEN RA knows about the Wallonie scene? If there's one existing...?\n\nnot much.i think we ‘re not seeing enough of it.get us over there ;)\n\n16. Ok, thank you RA, thank you all of the answers. And thank you for the\n\ngreat songs you offered me to release on the 4-way split CD with GAMENESS,\n\nGANTZ, and VUUR. Final words to you...And hope to see you more often in\n\nWallonie.\n\nThank you j\n\nget Facebook count\n\nURL : https://www.shootmeagain.com/interviews/24_amenra\n\nAPI URL : https://graph.facebook.com/v2.7/?id=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shootmeagain.com%2Finterviews%2F24_amenra&access_token=146373435406736|7f51b20e2f61d883164b12276c50cec6\n\nContent fetchedstring '{ \"id\": \"https://www.shootmeagain.com/interviews/24_amenra\"}' (length=64)\n\nJson\n\narray (length=1)\n\n'id' => string 'https://www.shootmeagain.com/interviews/24_amenra' (length=51)\n\nCount :\n\nget Google+ count\n\nURL : https://www.shootmeagain.com/interviews/24_amenra\n\nAPI URL : https://clients6.google.com/rpc?key=AIzaSyCKSbrvQasunBoV16zDH9R33D88CeLr9gQ\n\nERROR: HTTP error 404 Document Not Found : The server can not find the requested page in the URL.\n\n► COMMENTAIRES"
