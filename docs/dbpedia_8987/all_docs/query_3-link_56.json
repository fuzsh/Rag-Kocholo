        "text": "author PP date 08/03/24\n\nThere was a time when nobody believed in a Botch reunion. After all, the iconic mathcore pioneers hadn't been a band in well over twenty years with no indication of return. Then the stars aligned and Botch played a reunion show that sold out in mere seconds.\n\nIt was a spark of something greater, as the band decided to share that experience with a whole lot of other people, ranging from a few one-offs in 2023 including a performance at Hellfest, to the impending European tour that the band is embarking on today.\n\nWith that in mind, we decided it was a good idea to catch up with the band for an interview ahead of their Danish stop to probe the band's drummer Tim Latona, and their vocalist Dave Verellen about the band's two legendary albums and what's in store for us on this tour.\n\nThe band had just arrived in Prague, Czech Republic, but managed to find time for us to hop on a short, twenty-minute recorded Zoom interview. During this interview, we go through the band's thoughts and approach to recording their two albums, and how it felt like back then writing albums that later turned out to be foundational material for mathcore in general.\n\nWe also touch upon whether the band intends to write another album in the future, and even talk about what their non-Botch day jobs are like in a fascinating and cozy interview. It's not every day you get a chance to talk to some of the all-time greats in a specific genre of music.\n\nWithout further ado, enjoy our interview below:"
