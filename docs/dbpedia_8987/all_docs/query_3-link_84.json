        "text": "IN FLAMES In Flames represent the best of metal’s past, present, and future. In Flames are as vital and even more energized today than when they unleashed classics like Come Clarity and Clayman in decades past. The band built a stunning reputation with devastating, crowd-moving, inspired performances around the world at every major rock and metal festival imaginable, headlining multiple treks, and touring with the likes of Slipknot, Megadeth, Judas Priest, Killswitch Engage, Within Temptation, and Lamb Of God. They regularly headline some of the biggest stages and festivals in the world. Foregone, the furious fourteenth studio album, combines the greatest aggressive, metallic, and melodic strengths of their landmark records with the seasoned songwriting of their postmodern era. The melodic guitars, crushing riffs, and high-speed tempos that define much of the In Flames catalog first crystalized on their second album, The Jester Race (1996), complete with hints of the catchy choruses to come. Whoracle (1997) is the rawest and arguably heaviest In Flames album from the 90s. Metal Hammer declared melodeath masterpiece Colony (1999) “an undisputed fireball of an album.” A sense of pride, accomplishment, and continued vitality are evident every time the band takes the stage, and all over Foregone. Melodic death metal pioneers and innovative purveyors of groove, the artistry, influence, stature, and future of In Flames loom as large as the heavy metal horizon itself. ARCH ENEMY Arch Enemy are incapable of making bad records, a point they hammer home with album number 11, the mighty ‘Deceivers’. Delivering a maelstrom of diamond-hard riffing wrapped around cinematic melodies, thunderous drumming and towering vocals, they are unstoppable and sound incredibly energized. Their third full-length with vocalist Alissa White-Gluz and second with guitarist Jeff Loomis, the Swedish extreme metal quintet are operating at the highest level, and ‘Deceivers’ easily stands toe-to-toe with the highlights of their storied catalogue. Roaring to life with ‘Handshake With Hell’ they make it clear they are out for blood, and every track is a highlight, from the moody ‘Poisoned Arrow’ to the titanically anthemic ‘One Last Time’. Launched in 1995 by guitarist/songwriter Michael Amott (ex-Carcass) and vocalist Johan Liiva, 1996 debut album ‘Black Earth’ bolstered the flagging death metal genre and showed that it still had mainstream potential. 1998’s scathing ‘Stigmata’ and 1999’s more refined ‘Burning Bridges’ followed, and in 2000 Liiva stepped down, with Angela Gossow taking his place. 2001 marked her recording debut, ‘Wages Of Sin’, which was the sound of a band revitalized, and they broke wider with 2003’s ‘Anthems Of Rebellion’, largely thanks to single ‘We Will Rise’. 2005’s ‘Doomsday Machine’ was easily their most successful effort of their career up to that time, without sacrificing their integrity, following this up with the thrashier ‘Rise Of The Tyrant’ (2007) and Gossow’s swan song, 2011’s ‘Khaos Legions’. With Gossow now the band’s manager, White-Gluz made her recording debut with 2014’s ‘War Eternal’, which sounded fresh and hungry, and they followed this up with 2017’s towering ‘Will To Power’, which alongside the blazing melo-death attack features the band’s first clean-sung power-ballad, ‘Reason To Believe’, adding a new dimension to their sound. Now they move forward with ‘Deceivers’, continually proving they are masters of their craft.\n\nPOWERWOLF – a name that fills every disciple of melodic heavy metal with joy and stands for a successful quintet that needs no more introduction after 15 years of steep ascent. The anniversary was celebrated with a best-of release in 2020, which united the highlights of all six studio albums released to date – including both long-running hits from early works, and more recent hits from their latest album Interludium (Deluxe Version) released early this year. HAMMERFALL – No matter how much everything changes in culture and the world at a large, heavy metal endures. It empowers. It engages. It engenders strength and it outlasts fads. The same can be said for HAMMERFALL. This message rings out louder than ever for HammerFall. The group’s impact can be felt in nearly every corner of heavy music. In true HAMMERFALL fashion, their last studio album, Crimson Thunder – 20 Year Anniversary of the previous alum released in 2002, received widespread praise from the fans, their peers and the industry. The riffs hit harder, the rhythms thundered louder and the choruses soared higher than ever."
