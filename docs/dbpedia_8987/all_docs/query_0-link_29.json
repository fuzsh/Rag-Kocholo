Starting October 5th, Botch will kickstart their first US tour in over two decades, a momentous occasion that fans have eagerly anticipated.\n\nWith a lineup of shows set to happen across the country, and with supporting acts ranging from Helms Alee to Converge, the tour promises to be an epic recollection of Botch’s signature energy and raw power.\n\nPreorders for “An Anthology of Dead Ends” vinyl are now open.\n\nBotch on tour:"
