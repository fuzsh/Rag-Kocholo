        "text": "Metalcore veterans Botch played a pair of farewell shows over the weekend. Founding members Brian Cook, Dave Knudson, Tim Latona and Dave Verellen took over the Showbox in Seattle, celebrating their legacy with what they called “A Weekend Of Dead Ends.”\n\nBotch formed in 1993 and released two studio albums before their initial breakup in 2002. They reunited in 2022, releasing new music for the first time in 20 years, and embarked on a full reunion tour the following year. In the interim, the members went on to form bands including Minus The Bear and These Arms Are Snakes.\n\nSee fan-captured videos of Botch’s farewell gig below."
