        "text": "DETAILS:\n\nBOTCH ANNOUNCE FIRST EVER AUSTRALIAN TOUR FOR MAY 2024\n\nBOTCH. IS. BACK.\n\nLegendary Tacoma, Washington mathcore/hardcore/metal band Botch have announced their first ever Australian tour for May 2024.\n\nBassist Brian Cook, guitarist David Knudson, drummer Tim Latona and vocalist Dave Verellen formed Botch in 1993, becoming one of the most ground-breaking and influential bands during a pivotal shift in heavy music, before splitting in 2002 at the height of their popularity. Their split made way for members to form and play in other highly notable and influential bands including Minus the Bear, These Arms Are Snakes, Narrows, SUMAC, Russian Circles and Torment & Glory.\n\nThe legend of Botch has grown over the past twenty years, but despite continued clamour from fans, there were no plans for the band to get back together.\n\nThen, in August 2022, Botch released “One Twenty Two”, their first song in twenty years – the surprise drop lit the online metal world ablaze. The track’s two minutes of biting, twisting riffage brought Botch’s legacy to the forefront of fan’s minds again, with impeccable execution.\n\nIn October, just one day after announcing they would be playing two back to back shows at Seattle’s 1200-capacity Showbox, the band was shocked to see tickets for both nights sold out in just 13 seconds.\n\nNow, their reunion has gifted fans a long-awaited Australian tour for May 2024.\n\nWhat can fans expect from the reunification of this seminal act?\n\nAs The Stranger notes - at a typical Botch show during their prime, the band thrashed about on stage, yet somehow they always managed to nail all the minute intricacies. Since coming back together, they have been dedicated to making sure they could replicate what they became known for in the first place.\n\nAs David Knudson says:\n\n“We don’t want to half-ass it…we want to be fucking tight as we ever were, if not tighter. We don’t want to disappoint a fan that’s never seen us live. So you know, it’s all in or nothing.”\n\nThere’s not much more that needs to be said. Botch. Is. Back.\n\nBOTCH AUSTRALIAN TOUR MAY 2024\n\nFri 17 May – Max Watts, Melbourne VIC\n\nSat 18 May – Max Watts, Melbourne VIC\n\nSun 19 May – The Gov, Adelaide SA\n\nTue 21 May – Rosemount Hotel, Perth WA\n\nThu 23 May – The Triffid, Brisbane QLD\n\nFri 24 May – Manning Bar, Sydney\n\nSat 25 May – Manning Bar, Sydney"
