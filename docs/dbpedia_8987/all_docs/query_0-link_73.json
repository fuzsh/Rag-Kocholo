The members of Botch are Dave Verellen, Tim Latona, Dave Knudson and Brian Cook.\n\nBotch was founded in 1993 in Tacoma, Wash. The group spent several years as a garage band only, releasing a handful of demos and EPs before attracting the attention of Hydra Head Records. Botch signed to Hydra Head Records in the late '90s, releasing their albums American Nervoso and We Are the Romans through the label in 1998 and 1999, respectively.\n\nIn the years that followed, Botch’s profile continued to grow. They amassed a devoted cult following due to their sophisticated musicianship and tongue-in-cheek lyrics. By the early 2000s, the band had toured with well-known acts like Ink & Dagger, The Dillinger Escape Plan and The Blood Brothers. Though Botch disbanded in 2002, they reunited in 2022 and continue to tour and record today.\n\nDo not miss your chance to see this hard-hitting rock group perform live.
