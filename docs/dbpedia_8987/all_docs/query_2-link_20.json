        "text": "Article number: 634457122574 Availability: In stock\n\n25th Anniversary Edition LP On Transparent Purple Vinyl\n\nIncludes Digital Download\n\nLegendary Tacoma, Washington mathcore/hardcore/metal band Botch’s debut full-length American Nervoso was originally recorded in 1998, eventually becoming one of the most ground-breaking records during a pivotal shift in heavy music. Now, the band’s debut album is set to be re-issued on Sargent House 25 years after its original release.\n\nThe album features white-hot guitar action, scathing vocals, sweet bass moves, and torrential drums, smashing existing precepts of hardcore and redefining both the word and the music for a generation of kids and grizzled vets alike. Bassist Brian Cook, guitarist David Knudson, drummer Tim Latona, and vocalist Dave Verellen formed Botch in 1993, eventually becoming one of the most significant bands of their time before playing their final show on June 15, 2002.\n\nThe members would go on to play in These Arms Are Snakes, Minus the Bear, and Russian Circles, among others, with acclaim for the band coming mostly post-breakup. Over 20 years since they played their final show, Botch are reuniting for select dates in the Pacific Northwest in February 2023."
