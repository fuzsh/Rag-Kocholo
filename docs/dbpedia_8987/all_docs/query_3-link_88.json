        "text": "It’s been 20 years since the Tacoma, Washington-based mathcore legends Botch officially graced the stage as a cohesive unit, but that’s all about to change early next year – and we can’t be any more stoked than we already are.\n\nOn February 24 and 25, 2023, Botch will head back to the venue where they originally hung it up in June 2002 – the Showbox in Seattle. Since that fateful gig, the band remained a fragment of metal history, having broken up due to internal struggles between Tim Latona and Dave Knudson. Since then, the band’s various members have since gone on to work on other projects.\n\nBack in August, Botch first showed signs of life by releasing a new song titled “One Twenty Two,” which was to be included in a re-issue of the band’s second album, We Are the Romans. More recently, members of the band played “Saint Matthew Returns to the Womb” on October 15 at a private birthday party for producer Matt Bayles."
