        "text": "Botch was an American metalcore band formed 1993 in Tacoma, Washington, by Brian Cook, Dave Knudson, Tim Latona and Dave Verellen. The band spent four years as a garage band and released several demos and EPs before signing to Hydra Head Records. They recorded two excellent studio albums American Nervosa and We Are the Romans, before disbanding in June 2002. They also released the excellent EP An Anthology of Dead Ends and the live album 061502. Botch's music was a major early influence on the mathcore and metalcore styles, and their final album We Are the Romans is cited by many music critics as one of the most influential progressive metal albums of the period.\n\nArtist Website: botch.bandcamp.com\n\nFeatured Albums: Botch"
