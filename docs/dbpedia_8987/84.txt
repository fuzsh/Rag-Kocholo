Botch, formed in 1993 in Seattle by vocalist Dave Verellen and virtuoso guitarist David Knudson, dwell at the border between post-metal and metal-core. The experiment first attempted on American Nervoso (1997) blossomed on the high-entropic We Are the Romans (1999).

After the band dissolved, David Knudson joined Minus The Bear.
