Botch are a rock band from Tacoma, Washington.

Formed in 1993, they released two studio albums before splitting in 2002: 1998's 'American Nervoso' and 1999's 'We Are the Romans'. The members went on to form other projectswith Dave Knudson notably forming Minus The Bearbefore reforming in 2022.

Botch will head to the UK and Europe in March 2024, ahead of an Australian trek in May. Catch them live by checking tour dates and ticket information via Stereoboard.
