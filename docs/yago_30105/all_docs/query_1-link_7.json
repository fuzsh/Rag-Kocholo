        "text": "The last Grand Prince of Moscow and first Tsar of Russia, Ivan IV's reign started on a promising note, with the conquest of the khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan, before taking a turn for the worst with the outbreak of the Livonian War and ending with self-harming actions like the Massacre of Novgorod and the killing of his son and heir, Ivan Ivanovich.\n\nA good part of this decline can be owed to Ivan's growing paranoia and descent into madness, so what if he, among other things, didn't lose both of his parents at such a young age (Vasili III died when he was three years old, and Elena Glinskaya died when he was eight [and was just 27 years old at the time of her death])? How could having a saner and more reasonable Ivan IV affect Russia in the mid to late 16th century?\n\n@alexmilman and @Lalli can correct me, but didn't things only start going downhill after Anastasia Romanova die though?\n\nThere are several incidents. Anastasia had a calming influence on Ivan. Maria, his second wife, encouraged his vengeance.\n\nIvan had a severe fever and was believed to have been close to death. Many of the nobles refused to swear allegiance to Ivan's son probably because they feared another long regency.\n\nHigh fevers are associated with madness, especially in the era of no medical care\n\nCould Russia have won the Livonian War (say, by taking and keeping Reval, Dorpat and Narva at the very least)? I read a thread discussing the topic recently, and IIRC one of the posts said that the Russians \"reverted\" to a type of warfare not suited for that place and time.\n\nAlso, could the oprichnina be avoided?\n\n@alexmilman\n\nCould Russia have won the Livonian War (say, by taking and keeping Reval, Dorpat and Narva at the very least)?

By that time Tsardom already had a regular infantry with the firearms, strong artillery and few thousands foreign mercenaries so the whole thing hardly was absolutely necessary and the system definitely was backward by that time.\n\nAlso, could the oprichnina be avoided?\n\n@alexmilman\n\nThere are numerous theories on the subject from it being just Ivan’s paranoia and all the way to it being rationalized as a tool necessary for dealing with the restrictions upon Tsar’s power.

Could a slightly different Ivan, plus something else (a big war with the Crimeans and Ottomans, perhaps?), convince Moscow to take the deal and perhaps gain control of Narva, Dorpat and Reval?"
