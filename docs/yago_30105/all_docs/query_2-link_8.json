        "text": "480 years ago, 4 on April 1538, the great Russian princess Elena Glinskaya, the wife of Vasily III and the mother of Ivan Vasilyevich, suddenly died. The boyar rule began for the Russian state.\n\nElena Glinskaya\n\nThe daughter of Prince Vasily Lvovich from the Lithuanian clan Glinsky and his wife Anna Yaksic, who was from Serbia, the daughter of a Serbian voivode. Born around 1508 (exact date of birth is not known).\n\nHelen's uncle, Prince Mikhail Lvovich, was a major statesman of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Russia. After the defeat of the rebellion Glinsky fled with his relatives to Moscow. Among the refugees was young Elena. According to legend, Glinsky were descended from Mamaia, \"who beat Dmitry Ivanovich on the Don\". Before expulsion, the Glinsky owned cities and lands in the territory of present-day Left-Bank Ukraine.\n\nIn 1526, Helen became the second wife of the Grand Duke of Moscow and All Russia Vasily III. The first marriage, he was married to Solomonia from the ancient and noble family of the Saburovs. But with her sovereign decided to divorce, because of her infertility. After twenty years of marriage, Solomonia never gave birth. Basil was very concerned about this fact, as opposed to his brothers or their possible sons become candidates for the throne. The decision on divorce was supported by the Boyar Duma and part of the clergy.\n\nIn the 1525 year, with the approval of Metropolitan Daniil, Vasily III divorced Solomonia. Such a divorce with a violent reference of his wife to the monastery was the first in stories Rus. In November 1525, Solomonia was tonsured in the Moscow Mother of God Christmas Monastery under the name of Sofia. Later, Solomon was transferred to the Pokrovsky Monastery of the city of Suzdal, which she used to support as the Grand Duchess. There is a legend that Solomonia was pregnant during the tonsure and already in the monastery gave birth to the boy George.\n\nVasily chose Elena Glinskaya as his wife not only for political reasons. According to historians, the swiftness of the divorce and the wedding itself testified that the young princess greatly liked the Russian sovereign. Chronicles call the only reason why the Grand Duke chose Helen: “lepotas for her face and beauty”. The prince fell in love with a young and intelligent beauty. Elena, in comparison with Solomonia, in the opinion of the Moscow boyars, was rootless. Among Elena's opponents were Simeon Kurbsky and relatives of the Grand Duchess Solomonia - Saburov, Godunov. But she was beautiful, young, brought up in a European way, well-educated (she knew German and Polish, she spoke and wrote in Latin), which sharply stood out from among Russian women. For the sake of a young beautiful wife, Prince Vasily himself \"was young\", he even shaved his beard (which was not welcomed in Russia then). In 1530, the long-awaited son, Ivan (in the future, Ivan the Terrible), and later the son, Yuri, who, as it turned out, was painful, was born to the prince's couple.\n\nIt should be noted that already in this period in Russia, an elite opposition was taking shape in the course of sovereigns to strengthen autocratic power. Vasily III continued the line of his father Ivan III to strengthen the central (autocratic) power. Not everyone liked this. The top of the Russian aristocracy was Shuisky, Kurbsky, Kubensky, Rostovsky, Mikulinsky, Vorotynsky, etc. Their ancestors were relatively recently independent princes - Suzdal, Yaroslavl, Rostov, Tver, etc. The rulers of independent states. And they came from the older branches of the kind of Rurik, and Moscow grand dukes - from the youngest. There were also persons related to the grand duke himself. Thus, a noble turncoat from Lithuania, Prince of Belsky, Ivan III married his sister's daughter; The baptized Kazan prince Peter was married to the sister of Vasily III, and the native of Lithuania Mstislavsky - to his niece. Also, the Grand Duke had four brothers: Yuri Dmitrovsky, Simeon Kaluzhsky, Dmitry Uglichsky and Andrei Staritsky. Under the will of Ivan III, they received fiefdoms. Two of them, Simeon and Dmitry, for the 1520 years. went into another world, but Yuri and Andrew retained vast possessions, their own courtyards and troops. As the closest relatives of the sovereign, they were forgiven for something that was not forgiven for others. However, they were unhappy, they wanted more - power, land, wealth. If Tsar Vasily had been left without an heir, then the Moscow table would go to Yury Dmitrovsky or Andrey Staritsky.\n\nMany representatives of the aristocracy considered their position not much lower than the sovereign, were unhappy with the current situation, were not averse to \"correct\" it. They behaved independently, often failing the sovereign's instructions. But the high position allowed them to avoid the deserved punishment. The main temptation for a number of representatives of the aristocracy was to return to the old order of feudal fragmentation or to introduce orders similar to the Polish or Lithuanian. There, the magnates could dictate their will to the monarchs and rule uncontrollably in their domains. They envied the self-will and independence of the Polish-Lithuanian aristocracy, their “freedoms”. It is clear that the western neighbors of Russia and Rome tried to use these sentiments in order to subjugate the Russian land, destroy the \"Orthodox heresy\" and seize the Russian wealth. That is, the situation was quite shaky. Illness, death, the absence of an heir could immediately destroy the autocracy and centralized state that was taking shape in Russia, and served as the beginning of an internecine quarrel and unrest. And all this in very difficult foreign policy conditions, when strong enemies surrounded Russia on all strategic directions.\n\nVasily harshly suppressed the tendency towards the resumption of the fragmentation of Russia. He finally deprived Pskov of independence. The reason for this was the complaints of the local poor against oppression by the nobility and the rich, who crushed the veche democracy. In turn, the local nobility and merchants complained about the grand duke's governor. Basil ordered to cancel the Chamber. Veche bell removed and sent to Novgorod. Vasily arrived in Pskov and did the same to him as his father did with the Novgorod Republic in 1478. 300 most noble families of the city were resettled in the lands of Moscow, and their villages were given to Moscow service people.\n\nThen came the turn of the Ryazan land. Ryazan has long been listed in the \"podruchnikami\" of Moscow. There, under infant Prince Ivan, his mother ruled, who was subordinate to Moscow and received her support. But the boy grew up and decided to ally with the Crimean Khanate. This led to a new internecine strife, the collapse of the defensive system in the south, opened the way for Crimean brigands to the depths of Russia. In 1517, Vasily summoned Ryazan Prince Ivan Ivanovich to Moscow and ordered him to be put in custody. They guarded him badly, so he fled to Lithuania. Ryazan inheritance eliminated.\n\nIn 1523, the Seversky unit prince Vasily Shemyakin was arrested, convicted of secret communication and correspondence with Lithuania. For various reasons, the Chernigov, Rila and Starodub princes were deprived of their sovereign rights. The processes of centralization of the Russian state were logical, but increased the number of those who were dissatisfied with the policies of Moscow. Oppositional sentiments persisted in Novgorod and Pskov, despite the defeat of the local boyars. The local nobility, including the new one, and the merchants remembered the old “freedoms”. Foreigners looked for contacts with them, tried to use them in their own interests.\n\nSovereign Basil and the people who supported him, including part of the clergy, decided to take extraordinary measures in order to preserve autocratic power and not to give the throne to Yuri or Andrey. Hence, such an extraordinary and unprecedented decision - a divorce from his wife.\n\nVasily's family happiness was short-lived; in the fall of 1533, the sovereign caught a cold on a hunt and became seriously ill. On his deathbed, he blessed his son Ivan for a great reign and handed him \"the scepter of great Russia\", and he ordered his \"wife Olena with the boyar council\" \"under the son of his son, before the age of his son\". Obviously, Vasily was very much afraid for the fate of his wife and son. Before his death, he forced the brothers to repeat the oath to Prince Ivan (the first time he took an oath from them in the year 1531). He called the boyars to \"observe tightly\" his son and state. I specifically asked Mikhail Glinsky for the child and Elena to \"shed their blood.\" Basil felt a threat to his son and autocracy.\n\n1526 Vasily III, the Grand Duke of Moscow, introduces his bride, Elena Glinskaya, into the palace. Painting by Claudia Lebedeva\n\nElena's board\n\nAndrei Staritsky, boyar Zakharyin-Yuryev, princes Mikhail Glinsky, Vasily and Ivan Shuysky, Mikhail Vorontsov and voivode Tuchkov were included in the regency council with the child-emperor. Obviously, Tsar Vasily wanted to unite representatives of various boyar clans in the council. However, the intrigue began almost immediately.\n\nThe first conspiracy was organized by Yury Dmitrovsky. Vasily did not trust his brother, an accomplice in the old Shuisky conspiracy, and did not even include him in the Regency Council. The conspirators believed that the oath to the Grand Duke was invalid. Andrei Shuisky joined the conspiracy. But the plot was revealed. At the beginning of 1534, Prince Yuri with his boyars and Andrei Shuisky were arrested. Two years later he died in prison, his inheritance was liquidated. The boyars did not protest against the imprisonment of their brother, as did his brother Andrei Staritsky. He was the winner. Now the role of the nearest candidate to the throne passed to him. Moreover, he also wanted to profit at the expense of his brother. However, Elena refused to satisfy his request. In compensation, Andrew gave a large number of gifts.\n\nWe know little about Elena Glinskaya. Chroniclers gave extremely meager characteristics of Russian figures, usually recorded only events. From them we only know about the beauty of the princess. But the facts of her government say that she was very clever. It is not surprising that she became the first ruler of the Russian state after Grand Duchess Olga. Probably, Grand Duke Basil, dying, did not think about such a possibility. Therefore, he tried to strengthen his wife and son with regents, relatives and the church. But she became a real ruler, and she handled it pretty well with the burden of power. The hostile relations that had developed between the Regency Council and the Boyar Duma, as well as various boyar groups, played in its favor. The Duma was a lawful, well-established body, and the boyars painfully perceived the elevation of seven guardians appointed by the dying man’s bedside. Helena played on these contradictions, making her decisions.\n\nIn addition, the princess found a reliable military support. Her favorite was Ivan Fedorovich Sheepskin Telepnev-Obolensky. An experienced commander who distinguished himself in battles with Lithuania, the Crimea and Kazan. Thus, in 1530, Prince Obolensky was appointed the first voivode of the right-wing regiment in the cavalry rati during the campaign against the Kazan Khanate under the command of the boyar Prince Mikhail Glinsky. He breached the city wall, the first to burst into the outskirts of the capital of the Khanate. Only the criminal inaction of the main governor saved Kazan from falling. In 1533, during the next Crimean invasion, the prince Telepnev-Obolensky once again distinguished himself and the grand duke granted him the highest rank of equestrian and sent him to Voivodeship in Kolomna. His sister Agrippina (Agrafena) Chelyadnina became mother (educator) of Prince Ivan (the future king). After the death of the grand duke, still a young princess and a dashing commander, who always commanded advanced units in the war, was in the thick of things, they agreed.\n\nIt is interesting that the mother of Ivan the Terrible, like himself, was tried to vilify the foreigners, the local Western liberals, starting with the freemason historian Karamzin, more forcefully. They accused Yury Dmitrovsky and Andrey Staritsky of persecuting “innocent” people. Fanned \"criminal connection\" of Helen with Prince Ivan Fedorovich. However, in that era, this connection was not \"criminal.\" A woman, a widow, needed support and help, and received her. Therefore, the church, which was then not afraid to say its word, did not protest. In addition, there is no information that the empress gave her favorite pet with patrimonies, awards and money. Moreover, Obolensky did not even become the main commander. He conceded the command of a representative of the oldest and most distinguished families, as it was and was content with the secondary position of the governor of the advanced regiment.\n\nGrand Duchess Elena Glinskaya.
