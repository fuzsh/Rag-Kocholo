        "text": "The church of the Ascension was built in the first of half of the 16th Century by order of the great Muscovite prince Vasilii 3rd. According to legend he decided to thank god for the birth of his son – the future first Russian Tsar Ivan the Terrible. But this is of course just a legend. Ivan the Terrible was born in 1530 and the church was completed in 1532. It is not possible that such a large and complex building could have been built in just two years. In fact construction started in 1528 so it is unlikely it was in honour of such a vow. It is more likely it was built so that the prince and his wife could pray for an heir. And the son appeared before the church was completed.\n\nThe church of the Ascension was considered the first marquee roofed brick church in Rus – old Russia – for a long time. This is because the date it was built is actually known. However more than likely the first church of this kind was the church of the trinity in the Alexandrovsky district (now known as the town of Alexandrov in the Vladimir region). But the Kolomenskoe church is without doubt is an example of architectural perfection.\n\nIt is believed that the architect of the church of the Ascension was the Italian Petrok Malyi. He was inspired by traditional Russian wooden marquee churches. Interestingly it is much easier to build a wooden marquee than a stone one. It is easier to make a cupola from stone. However prince Vasilii wanted a customary marquee roof. The Italian carried out this wish brilliantly.\n\nThe church of the Ascension rising up into the sky is a nice way to interpret the royal passage to heaven. The square foundation is a symbol of the earthly world and the round top is heaven while the octahedral marquee connects them.\n\nThe church of the Ascension was the tallest building of its time. It is 52 metres high. The walls are mainly 3 metres thick while they are 2,5 metres thick at the top. The height of the space inside the church is just 42 metres.\n\nThe most famous Kolomenskoe church – the hipped roof church of the Ascension, was built on the order of the great prince Vasilii 3rd. Some believe it was to celebrate the birth of his son, Ivan, others think it was so the prince had somewhere to pray for a long awaited heir. And Vasilii needed god’s help.\n\nThe young Vasilii had a traditional Byzantine and Moscow style wedding. From all over the world beautiful girls, including the bride, gathered in the capital. There were at least 1000 of them. And from all these he chose the best one – Solomoniya Saburova.\n\nVasilii 3rd was married to Solomoniya Saburova for 20 years. And yet no baby was born. It ended in the first divorce in Russian history, a violent one. The patriarch of Jerusalem Mark predicted: ”If you marry for the second time a malicious child will be born. Your empire will be filled with horror and grief, and there will be rivers of blood.”\n\nVasilii 3rd married Elena Glinskaya after his divorce from Solomoniya. They waited for 4 more years for a child. Eventually in 1530 a boy was born – Vanya – the future Ivan the Terrible. Prince Vasilii was 54.\n\nAnd three years later Vasilii died from blood infection caused by an abscess on the left hip. And the prince also forbade his brothers from marrying, so that their children did not try to get the throne. Mark’s prophecy came true.\n\nThere were rivers of blood, and the Ryuriks dynasty was interrupted by the death of Ivan the Terrible."
