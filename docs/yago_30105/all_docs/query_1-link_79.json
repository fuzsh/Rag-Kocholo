        "text": "In the face of Morrie's overwhelming compassion and tenderness, Ivan Ilych presents an opposite lifestyle. After a pleasantly carefree childhood he turned towards ambition and pursued an ever-larger salary and an ever-increasing social rank. Ivan lived without values and without attachments, easily moving between cities and jobs. He cared little for the great inconvenience of his family, and even less for his wife: \"he hate[d] her with his whole soul\" (Ivn, 139). Commitment was a prison to be avoided at all costs, a detriment to his proper and official existence. Genuine love touched Ivan only rarely and certainly not during the dying moments when he needed it the most.\n\nIvan IV Vasilyevich (1530-1584), was the first of two children of Basil III and Elena Glinskaya. Ivan came into the world on August 25, 1530. Nearly a year after this Ivan's father died when he was only three. Basil had died due to a small, little pimple on his thigh that had developed into a deadly sore. Basil requested at his deathbed that his son Ivan would become the ruler of Russia when he became a man at age 15. Once Basil died the boyars took over Russia, denying Ivan's right to the throne. Ivan's mother then with other trusted boyars took over the ruling party. Elena was able to successfully rule Russia for four years, until she died suddenly in 1538, apparently from poisoning, leaving eight-year-old Ivan an orphan. They had ended and that Ivan had complete power. On Sunday, January 16, 1547, Ivan was crowned czar in Moscow's lavish Cathedral of the Assumption. Ivan soon married Anastasia Romanovna-Zakharyina-Yurueva. Anastasia bore him six children of whom only two survived infancy. At times Ivan was very devote; he used to throw himself before the icons, banging his head against the floor. It resulted in a callosity at his forehead. Once Ivan even did a public confession of his sins in Moscow.\n\nThe One and Only Ivan by Katherine Applegate is about Ivan, a silverback gorilla who is raised by a human and lives in captivity at the Exit 8 Big Top Mall and Video Arcade. Ivan is brought to the Exit 8 after being captured and separated from his family while living in the wild. Ivan considers his new habitat a “domain” and refuses to admit that he is living in a cage. However, when Stella, an elephant, dies as a result of neglect, Ivan is forced to accept his situation. Moreover, he has to fight to keep the promise he made to save Ruby, a young elephant, from going down the same path as the rest of them. In her novel, The One and Only Ivan, Applegate uses characterization, setting, and plot to convey Ivan’s determination to become a protector.\n\nTolstoy also employs irony as he examines the plight of Ivan Ilych. This highlights the differences between Ilych's perception of his own life and reality while also allowing the reader to take part in some of the tearing anguish Ivan feels in having to submit to the wrongdoings in his life. Tolstoy compares Ivan Ilych's struggle to the plight of a man condemned to death as he \"struggles in the hands of an executioner\" (61). Ivan Ilych does not see death as a natural process, but as a punishment controlled by a merciless executioner, ironically much like the merciless judge he once was. Ivan Ilych's feels that death is an undeserved punishment because he never considered his own mortality. His obsession with social adroitness made mortality feel like a punishment, and his justification of this obsession made it impossible for him to let go of his life. Ivan Ilych believed he had lived his life up to social standards and because of this he would not have to endure the terrible agony of death that is beset among ordinary people. In reality he was blind to his shallow life and the transgressions he made.\n\nThe Death of Ivan Ilyich was a short, but is one of the greates of fiction. Ivan was a successful member of the state bureaucracy. Through out his life he had to do arrange it without complication. He is the perfect example of conforming, such as ‘’other-directed’’ man because he discovers the lies behind his successful life. The story opens with a deeplu significant way. The reader later on talks about Ivans early years. First, Tolstoy presents the death of Ivan. He told his wife and closets friends, Pete Ivanovitch. They were really worry about Ivan’s life than any other could be. They also worry about their own affairs. They pretend that feelings of ehat they do not feel. Ivans life could be concern for him after\n\nIvan Ilych’s marriage to Praskovya Fedorovna is not built on true love, instead it is built on Ivan Ilych once again, trying to fit in with society. To prove that Ivan Ilych did not get married based off true love the narrator says, “Ivan Ilych might have aspired to a more brilliant match, but even this was good. He had his salary, and she, he hoped, would have an equal income.” (Tolstoy) This quote proves that Ivan Ilych was conforming to society and he married his wife just because it was the right thing to do since everyone else was doing it which is shown when the narrator says “Ivan might have aspired to a more brilliant match” meaning that he was not completely satisfied with his wife. Ivan Ilych did not look at the deeper meaning of marriage, he only looked at the materialistic and physical things that came along with his wife which is why they both did not live a happy life together. When Ivan Ilych got ill the narrator says, “her husband had a dreadful temper and made her life miserable, she began to feel sorry for herself, and the more she pitied herself the more she hated her husband. She began to wish he would die” (Tolstoy). This expresses the hate that Praskovya Fedorovna felt towards her husband due to the fact that she realized Ivan Ilych never cared for her or her family and he only cared about his social status. Ivan Ilych was a bad husband because of his immorality and thus his wife is insurgent against him. Here,\n\nIn Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy’s The Death of Ivan Ilych, protagonist Ivan Ilych lives a life he considers to be marvelous and filled with the things he wants and considers important (both physical and emotional). He has a wonderful job he's good at, a beautiful family, a lovely house, and friends to play games like bridge with in the evenings. One day, when he is fixing up his new home before his family arrives, he hits his side after slipping by making bad step on a ladder. He convinces himself that it is only a bruise, and that the pain will pass. The pain doesn't simply pass, though. Doctor after doctor attempts to diagnose what might possibly be wrong with him, but none of them are able to agree on what his injury is. As he continues to live his life as he planned, the sensation of pain continues to come back to him repeatedly until he is eventually on his deathbed. As he realizes he is approaching the very end of his life, Ivan Ilych ponders over his life and begins to question himself, asking “What if my whole life has been wrong?” (Tolstoy 54). He comes to the conclusion that the things that are important are not tangible items such as money or property. Rather, he decides that the things that truly matter in life are intangible, such as happiness, compassion, and facing the truth. He realizes too late that these important feelings and concepts have been missing from his life all along.\n\nPeople find a significant amount of ways in order to express and get our feelings elsewhere we can use our body language or gestures along with volume. Screaming may be the most bizarre and consists when it comes to expressing emotion, but when it comes down to it whatever gets the job done is acceptable. Not saying that this allows a good thing to do, because it is very unacceptable to just act out. In the short story novel The Death of Ivan Ilych, Ivan comes down with a terminal illness after falling off the ladder on his side."
