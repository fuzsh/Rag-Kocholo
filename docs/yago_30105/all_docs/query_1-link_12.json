        "text": "Like if it was more just to it's people? I mean they could tone down alot of their antisemitism and persecution however with the Romanovs you can only do so much because in order to keep such a large diverse empire subservient you have to rule with an Iron fist. Perhaps there could be a popular revolt pre ww1 that could see a constitutional monarchy take over but even then I cant imagine it being \"good\" at best we get a slightly better alternative than the soviet union. I\n\nThe only way I could see the Tsar as being ‚Äògood‚Äô would be for the position of Tsar to be reduced in power to a figurehead with real power belonging to a democratically elected leadership (either parliamentary or presidential). And even then it would be a relative term given that it‚Äôs not like countries that became constitutional monarchies were necessarily benevolent historically speaking.\n\nHow would a Constitution help? The Russian Empire saw the Tsar essentially reduced to a figurehead with a flailing Constitutional system, and that didn't solve anything at all. The British style model of Constitutionalism isn't a universal recipe for success. Russia basically has a millennium of iron handed rule by the Tsars. The Rurukids ruled Russia for 800 years, and after that the Romanovs ruled for 300 years. It has no real history or tradition of \"democracy.\" This was tried in Germany with the Weimar System and it failed miserably. Russia had been a Parliamentary Republic with the February Revolution, and that government was so inept that it was overthrown by favor of the Bolshevik Revolution.\n\nIf the Decemberist Revolt doesn't occur and say Grand Duke Constantine isn't so overtly indifferent to the grievances of the Poles and its Constitutional stipulations then Nicholas I would likely keep many of his brother's more liberal policies with a hands off approach to governance. Nicholas I became very reactionary after the massive revolt against him.\n\nAnother possibility is if Alexander II avoids being assassinated which means that Alexander III doesn't become an ultra-reactionary.\n\nIvan the Terrible dies in infancy. Without him Russia is much better off, since it doesn't even exist anymore. üôÉ\n\n(More seriously, don't you have a particular period to give us?)\n\nIvan was, of course, a deviation even by the Russian standards (but it seems that in folklore his image is not too bad and ‚ÄúTerrible‚Äù is only one of the possible translations of the Russian nickname and not necessarily a correct one; ‚ÄúTerrifying (to the enemies)‚Äù can do as well, after all, city ‚ÄúGrozny‚Äù definitely did not mean Terrible‚Äù) but the Russian state already existed: unification was completed by Ivan III ‚Äúthe Great‚Äù (not to be confused with the bell tower of the same name in Kremlin üòÇ).\n\nRussia was generally ‚Äúbetter off‚Äù (in the terms of the government being a lesser pain in people‚Äôs posterior) under the rulers who used their power for not being engaged into the major wars, economic projects requiring massive forced involvement of their subjects, etc. which means, potentially, Feodor III or PIII (we can only guess) or AIII (while he was alive ‚Äúeverybody‚Äù was criticizing him but after his death people started recognizing that these were reasonably good and quiet times.\n\nTsar British style as a good option assumes that those in power are adequate for the task. Where these rare creatures could be found in Russia of the XVI-early XX in the needed numbers is anybody‚Äôs guess. Experiment with a good administrator being elected as a Tsar (Boris Godunov) ended up in a major disaster (part of which was not his fault but nonetheless).\n\nMaybe the Crimean defeat is worse? Say, Russia's fleet gets totally routed and the Treaty of Paris is way harsher on Russia. That should provide the incentive and political capital for early and sweeping reforms of the Russian state necessary to help it survive and modernise her army, meaning the state does much better in WW1 and avoids the situation of collapse.\n\nRussian Black Sea fleet was completely destroyed in OTL CW and the Baltic fleet proved to be too obsolete for any practical usage. The post CW reforms had been as swift and sweeping as was realistically possible and agreement to the harsher conditions of peace would undermine government‚Äôs credentials.\n\nNow, an idea that declaration and conduct of the major reforms by a government is a solution of all problems is somewhat idealistic (Peter I tried this with the disastrous results). Country needs finances, technological base, qualified specialists and many other things that could not be produced by a royal signature on a piece of paper. Russia was lacking pretty much all ‚Äúingredients‚Äù besides being a predominantly agricultural country in which the peasants (liberated with the land) had neither wish no incentive of turning themselves into the industrial workers and the merchant class was too weak and inexperienced to became the industrialists overnight. Russian high education system was producing too few engineers to satisfy the needs of a speedy industrialization and situation with the technicians was similar.\n\nNeedless to say that the tsar who was conducting all these major social reforms had been, as a token of a gratitude, assassinated.\n\nNow, one of the prerequisites of being ‚Äúgood‚Äù would be keeping Russia out of the major wars by maintaining a peaceful foreign policy while having a strong and modern army. Which means no Ottoman War, no RJW and no WWI (nine of them was necessary to Russia and each of them could be avoided). Being ‚Äúgood‚Äù and having subjects killed by the hundreds of thousands or millions for any reason except for defense against the aggression is incompatible.\n\nHow about Ivan III never decides to disinherit his grandson (i.e. and the boy learns to keep his head down)? @Lalli\n\nWhere is a guarantee that an alternative is substantially better? Ivan III was not himself necessarily ‚Äúgood‚Äù for his subjects and neither were his predecessors or immediate successor. Taking into an account general geopolitical and domestic situation a ‚Äúgood‚Äù ruler was pretty much impossible because of the need to conduct wars on all fronts and to keep in check his entourage. Childhood of Ivan IV is an example of what happens domestically in an absense of a ‚Äústrong hand‚Äù.\n\nWhere is a guarantee that an alternative is substantially better?

But figured if we're talking about a POD as far back as killing Ivan Grozniy in childhood why not go one generation further and eliminate Grozniy entirely? Since apparently the reason Vasili III married his first wife was because there were no Orthodox princesses to be found - yet, according to some records, Elena Glinskaya's was one said princess from Serbia.\n\nDmitri Vnuk was betrothed to Elisabet of Denmark (which makes me wonder why the attitude to a NON-Orthodox bride changed so much between Dmitri's imprisonment in 1502 and Vasili's marriage in 1505).\n\nNever said Dmitri Ivanovich Vnuk would be better.

The 2nd point was that qualifications for being ‚Äúgood Tsar‚Äù were not defined clearly and we can only guess what they could be. The one thing is clear: a reasonably meak and good-natured person on the throne during these times would be a disaster unless the real ruling is done by a ruthless and decisive person who is a true power behind the throne. Feodor I, who was seemingly a reasonably nice individual, got reputation of a dimwit and not a single good word. Ivan IV also was seemingly a nice person and he was pushed aside by Naryshkin clique and ended up with a reputation of semi-idiot. Notice that while the Russian history was full of impostors there were no false Feodor I or Ivan IV and the real Dmitry was a rather violent child but this did not prevent the people from lining behind the impostor who took his name."
