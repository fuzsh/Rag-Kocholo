        "text": "Dr. Balveen (Biba) Singh, DO, is a compassionate and dedicated psychiatrist certified by the American Board of Psychiatry. She serves patients in both New York and California, drawing from a wealth of experience across diverse psychiatric settings. Dr. Singh is widely respected in her field and also actively participates in renowned institutions including Garnet Health Medical Center, the Mental Health Association of Rockland, and Touro Medical College.\n\nDr. Singh's journey into medicine began against a backdrop of musical talent cultivated from an early age. Inspired by her father's career in psychiatry, she set her sights on becoming a doctor. She gained admission into the esteemed 7-year medical program at the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine. Despite opportunities in the music industry, her commitment to education prevailed, leading to the attainment of her Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree in 2005.\n\nDuring her residency, Dr. Singh pursued her parallel passion for music, culminating in the release of her first album in India in 2009. While juggling the responsibilities of being both a resident and later an attending physician at Garnet Health Medical Center, she continued to actively engage in singing and performing in Bollywood, often making trips to India.\n\nDr. Singh's fascination with mental health prompted her to pursue board certification in psychiatry through the American Osteopathic Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (AOBPN). This certification validates her proficiency in diagnosing and treating mental disorders, enabling her to provide holistic patient care.\n\nBeyond her medical career, Dr. Singh maintains a profound connection to her musical roots. She remains active in the music industry, recording and releasing singles and albums. Her unwavering dedication to both medicine and music is a testament to her lifelong commitment to healing and self-expression.\n\nDespite her demanding schedule, Dr. Singh credits her unwavering support system, comprised of her family and loved ones, as instrumental to her success. Her insatiable thirst for knowledge, coupled with her innate ability to balance her diverse pursuits, has solidified her position as a well-rounded and accomplished professional."
