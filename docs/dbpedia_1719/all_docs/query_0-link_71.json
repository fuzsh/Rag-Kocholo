C. Sikdar Biology is the science of living substances (ityadravayas) The field of Jalna Biology differentiates the living from the non-living by using the word Jidatthikayat (organism) to refer to any living things, plant or animal, just as modern Blology does. So It is relatively easy to see that a man, a Sala tree', a creepers and an earthworms are living, whereas pieces of matter (pud gala), e g carth, stones, etc, are not go. But according to modern Biology, \"it is more difficult to decide whether such things as viruses are alive.\" Jaina Biology states that the fabric of life of all plants and animala is paryaptie (Sakti = vital force) or Pranao (life force), in another way, Lc. paryapti appears to be the actual living material of all plants and animals. There are stated to be six kinds of paryapti10, viz. ahara paryapti (vital force by which beings take, digest, absorb and transform molecules of food par. ticles into khala (waste products) and rasa (chyle = molecules of nutrients or energy),11 sariraparyapti (vital force by which chyle or molecules of nutrlonts = (rastbhutamaharam) are utilized by beings for the release of energy, the building of blood, tissue, fat, bone, marrow, semen, etc , indriyaparyapti (vital force by which molecules of nutrients or chyles suitablo for building senses aro taken in and provided to the proper place so that beings can have the perceptual knowledge of the desired sense-objects by the sense-organs),14 ucchvasaparyaptils (vital force by which particles of respiration are taken in, oxidized for energy and left out (as carbon dioxide and water), bhaca paryapti. (vital force by which beings, having taken proper particles of speech, omit them as speech) and manahparyapti? (vital force by which beings, having taken particles (or dusts) of mind transform them as the mental force, i.e. thought). It appears that this paryapti (vital force) is not a single substance but Varies considerably from organism to organism (1 e, one-sensed to five-genaed being), among the various parts of a single animal or plant, and from one time to anothers within a single organ or part of an animal or plant, Thero are six paryaptis, but they share certain fundamental physical and chomical characteristics 18 It is stated that there are ten kinds of prang80 (living material or life force), viz five indriya pranas (hife force of five senses), ucshvasa prana (life force of rospiration), Zuprana (life force of length of life), manovakkayapranas (life forces of mind, speech and hody). Sambodhi 8.1 Page #4 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ J. C. Sikdar Actually speaking, these ten pranas are almost contained in glx paryaptis, e.g Indriya paryapti contains five indriya pranas, anaprana paryapti=ucchvasa prana, Jarira paryapti = kayaprana, bhasaparyapti - vak prana, manah paryapti = manah. prana, only ayuprana appears to be an addition Thus it is found that most of the paryaptis and the pranas have common names. So the question is whether there is any difference between them. The Gommatasura explains the difference in this way that paryapti is attainment of the capacity of developing body, mind, speech, and five sengen, whilo prana is the activity of those functionaries, 21 It is further explained that one-sensed beings poss088 four pranas or balas (life forces), viz sense of touch, respiration, length of life, body and speech, three-senscd beings bave seven pranas, viz. senses of touch, taste aad smell, respiration, length of life, body and speech, four-sensed beings have eight pranas, viz senses of touch, taste, smell and sight, rospiration, length of life, body and speech. In asamjh pancendriyajtvas (five-sonsod belngs having no physical mind but psychical mind, there are nine pranas, vrz, senses of touch, taste, smell, sight and hearing, respiration, length of life, body and speech, while there are ten pranas in samjhi pafcendnya jivas (five-sensed beings having physical mind), viz, senses of touch, taste, amell alght and hearing, respiration, length of life, body, speech and mind. 41 According to the Carvakas, life (as well as consciousness) is a result of peculiar chemical combination of non-living matter, or the four elements, in organic forms, just as the intoxicating property of spirituous liquor is the repult of the fermentation of unlatoxicating rice and molasses ** Similarly, the lastinctive movements and expression of new born babies (sucking, joy, grief, fear, etc) take place mechanically as a result of external stimuli as much as the opening and closing of the lotus and other flowers at different times of the day or night, or the movement of iron under the influence of load. stone.\" In tho same way, the spontaneous reproduction of living organisms frequently occurs, e.g. animalcules develop \"in moisture or lofusions, espcially under the influence of gentle warmth (Syedaja, uznaja, danhtamatakadayak) se or the maggots or other worms originate in the rainy season due to the atmospheric moisture in the constitutent particles of curds and the like and begin to live and move in 80 short a time, 27 Acarya Haribhadra has refuted Bhitacaltanyavada of the Materialists long before the Sahhhya in the following manner. It is the doctrine of the materlalists that this world 18 formed of only five groet elements (mahabhfitas), vit earth, etc, and there is no existence of soul nor the unseen force anywhere In the world.15 The other Materialists maintain the view on the contrary that clements are non-CODCIOUS (acetana). Consciousness is not the charactor of elemonts, Page #5 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ The Fabrics of life as conceived in Jaina biology nor the result of elements, while soul is the name of that tattva (reality) with which (Soul) consciouness is related (as character or result) 29 If consciouSAC88 would have been the character (quality) of elements, then it should have been found in all elements at all times, just like that the existence (existentiality), etc. (general character) and hardness, etc. (particular character) are found in the elements at all times in which they are found 80 Now Haribhadra refutes Bhutacalranyayada in this way that couscousness extata in elements as force (bakti), for this reason it is not perceptible, but consciousne88 existing in elements as force cannot be said to be nonexisting 10 elements.az This force (sakti) and consciousness are either non-different by all means from each other or different by all means from each other If they are non-different, then this force becomes consciousness and if they are different, Consciousness should be related with something else 82 Again, the point of non-manifestation of cetapa (consciousness) does not seem to be logical, because there is no other entity (vastu), covering, consciousness and it is for this reason that the number of realities will go against the doctrine of the Materialists on the admission of the existence of gome such entity 38 Haribhadra further advances the argument to refute the contention of the Materialists that this thing is directly proved that the element has got the nature of these two qualities or characters-hardness and non-livingness and when consciousness is not of the nature of these two characters (1.c. cannot exist with these two), then how can it be accepted that it was born out of elements,84 If consciousness does not exist in individual (1.e. uncombined) elements, then it cannot exist in the combined clements just as oll cannot exist in Gand particles. And if consciousness exists in the combined elements, then It should exist also in individual eldments and so on. 86 In conclusion Harbhadra maintains tbe view, aster refuting the doctrine of Bhutacaitanyavada of the Materialists with his cogent arguments that the existence of force (sakti), etc, in soul, and of the unseen force and this (adista), which makes the possibility of Sakti, etc in soul, should be accepted * unseen force (adrsta), which is different from soul, is real and of many kinds and comes into relation with soul 90 The Sankhya makes the reply to the materialists' view on castanya in the following manner that the intoxicating power in liquor is a foroe, 1.e. a tendency to motion. This force is the resultant of the subtile motions pre. sont in the particles of the fermented rice, molasses, etc. A motion of a Page #6 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ J. C Sikdar tendency to motion can in this way be the resultant of several other motions or tendencies\". \"But cartainya (consciousness) 19 not a motion, and oannot be the resultant of (unconscious) natural forces or motions Neither can the consciousness of the self or the organism as a whole be supposed to be the resultant of innumerable constituent particles of the body. One central abiding intelligence 18 simpler and therefore more legitimate hypothesis than an assemblage of consciousness latent in different Bhutas or particles.\"97 The Sankhya philosophy maintains the view that prana (llfe) is not vayu (bio-mechanical force) nor it is mere mechanical motion generated from the impluslon of vayu. The five vital forces, viz. Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana and Vyanase are stated to be Vayu io metaphorical way. Prana (life) is in reality a reflex activity, a resultant force of the various concurrent activit109 of the Antahkarana, 1e \"of the sensori-motor (Fnanendriya-Karmendriya), the emotivo manah and the apperceptive reactions of the organism\"40 According to Vimanabhiksu, this explains the disturbing (elevating or depressing) effect on the vitality of pleasurable or painful emotions like kama-love of mind (manas), one of the internal senses involved in the reactions of the living organism.<< Thus Prana of the Samkhya is not a Vayu nor 18 it evolved from the inorganic matters (Bhutas), \"but it is only a complex reflex activity (Sambhugatkaortti) generated from the operation of the psyco-physical forces in the organism.\" In agreement with the Sankhya the Vendantists bold the view that \"Prana Is nelthor a Vayu nor the operation of a Vayu,\"43 But they differ from the former's view that Prana is a mere reflex or resultant of concurrent sensorimotor, emotive and apperceptive reactions of the organism. If eleven birds, put in a cage, concurrently and continually strike against the bars of it in tho apo direction, it may move on under the impact of converted action, But the sensory and motor activities cannot in this way produce the vital activity of the organism, because the loss of one or moro of the senses does not result in the loss of life. This is above all the radical distinction bet. ween them There is the sameness of kind (Samajarty atya) between the motions of the individual birds and the resultant motion of the cage, but Prana 18 not explalned by sensations, but it is a separate principle (or force), just as the mind and antahkaranas generally are regarded in the Sankhya. It is A sort of subtilo \"ether-principle\" (adhyalmayayu) pervasive of the organism, not gross vayu, all the samo subtilized matter like the mind itself, as everything other than the soul (atma), according to the Vedanta, 18 materjal (jada). \"Prana 19 prior to the senses, for it regulates the development of the fertilized egg, which would putrefy, if it were not living, and the senses with their apperatus originate aubsequently from the fertilized egg.\"44 Page #7 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ The Fabrics of life as conceived in Jaina biology Caraka45 explains Vayu as the impelling force, the prime pover, which seta 10 motion the organism, the organs (including the senses and the mind), arranges the cells and tissues, unfolds or develops the foetal structure out of the fertilized ovum. According to Caraka and Susruta's, there are five chief Vayus with different functions for the maintenance of the animal life, viz. Prana, Udana, Samana, Vyana and Apana as mentioned in the Sankhya. Sufruta 47 describes Prana as baving its course in the mouth and function in deglutition, hiccough, respiration etc., Udana jo articulation and singing, Samana as digesting the food substance in the stomach in conjunction with the animal heat, Vyana as causing the flow of blood and sweat, and Apana with its seat in the intestinal region as throwing out the urino-gential secretions 48 In the mediaeval philosophy there is mention of forty nine Vayus amcog wbich there are ten chief Vayus, viz (1) Prana (2) Apana (3) Vyana (4) Samana (5) Udana (6) Naga (7) Kurma, (8) Kekara or Krakara (9) Devadatta and (10) Dhananjaya 50 Prana bas the function in the ideo-motor verbal mechanism and vocal apparatus, the respiratory system, the muscles, In coughing, singing, etc., A pana in ejecting the excret1008 and wastes, the urine, the faecca, the sperm and germ-ceils, etc, Vyana 10 extension, contraction, and flexion of the mus. cles, tendons, and ligaments, and stored up energy of the muscles, Udana in maintaining the erect posture of the body, Naga in involuntary retching, vomiting, Kurma, in the automatic movement of the eyelids, winking, etc,, Krkara in the appetites, hunger and thirst, Devadatta in bringing about yawn. ing, dozing, etc and Dhananjaya in causing coma, swooping and tranco, a The study of the different views on Prana or Vayu shows that Jalna paryapti or Prana is neither a result of peculiar chemical combinations of non-living matter as advocated by the Carvakas nor a complex reflex activity of the Sankhya but a sort of separate principie (adhyatma vayu) pervaalve of the organism as defined by the Vedanta, an impelling force, the primemover of Caraka and Susruta, It appears to be the actual living material of ali plants and animals like protoplasm of modern Biology. Jama paryapti and prana, the two unique forces, not explainable in terms of Physics and Chemistry, are associated with and control life The concept of these forces may be called vitalism which contains the view that living and non-living systems are basically different and obey different laws Many of the phenomena of life that appear to be so mysterious in Jaina Biology may be explained by physical and chemical principies with the discovery of future research in this field So it is reasonable to suppose that paryapti, a mysterious aspect of life, although not identifiable with protoplasm, comes nearer to the latter because of its unique functions in the organism, Page #8 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ J C Sikdar According to modern Biology, \"protoplasm is the actual living material of all plants and animals This is not a single substance but varies considerably from organism to organism, among the various parts of a single animal or plant, and from one time to another with a single organ or part of an animal or plant, There are many kinds of protoplasm, but they share certain fundamental physical and chemical characteristics\" 52 6 \"The protoplasm of the human body and of all plants and animals exists in discrete portions known as cells There are the microscopic units of structure of the body, each of them is an independent, functional unit, and the processes of the body are the sum of the co-ordinated functions of its cells. These cellular units vary considerably in size, shape and function. Some of the smallest animals have bodies made of a single cell, others such as a man or an oak tree are made of countless billions of cells fitted together,\" The major types of organic substances found in protoplasm are carbohydrates, protein, ipids, nucleic acids and steriods 54 \"Some of these are required for the structural integrity of the cell, others to supply energy for its functioning and still others are of prime importance in regulating metabolism within the cell's \"Carbohydrates and fats (lipids) have only a small role in the structure of protoplasia but are important as sources of fuel, carbohydrates are readily available fuel, fats are more permanently stored supplies of energy. Nucleie acids have a primary role in storing and transmitting information Proteins are structural and functional constituents of protoplasm, but may serve as fuel after deamination The body can convert each of these substances into xbers to some extent Protoplasm is a colloidal system, with protein moleles and water forming the two phases, and many of the properties of protoplasm - muscle contraction, ameboid motion, and so on - depend on the rapid change from sol (liquid condition) to gel (solid or semi-solid) state and back.\"** References I Bhagavatt Sutra, 20 2, 665, 2 Bhagavalt Sutra 33 1 844, Uttaradhayana Sutra, 36 155.

Page #13 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ THE ARCHITECTURAL DATA IN THE NIRVANAKALIKA OF PADALIPTA-SURI M. A. Dhaky The Nirvanakaliha is a Jaina pratistha-tantra of some esteem and antiquity,1 For some years it has been one of the major sources for the study of the iconography of Jainas' Yaksas and Yakse. The authorship according to the colophon, goes to Padailpta-San, a disciple of Mandanagani, who, in turn, was a disciple of Sangamasimha, \"tho crest_jewel of the Vidyadhara-vamsa of the Svetambra-sect.\" This Sangamasiraha and the Sangamasiddha of Vidyadhara-kula who passed away after fast-untodeath on Mt satrunjaya 10 V S 1064/A D 1008 (according to the contemporancous Pundarika image inscription), are now looked upon as one and the same person 2 The Nirvanakallka may then have to be dated to the first quarter of the eleventh century: The work is, in main, concerned with the installation rites of Jaina Image and Jaina temple; as a result, it became at samo stage unavoidable on author's part to refer to the architectural members of the temple, The references, though succinct, are pertinent and to some exteat useful alao, for they provide small but significant additions to our knowledge on templo-terminogology. The first of such references 18 concerning the consecration of the door (doara-pratistha) The toxt, in that context, refers to Yaksesa (Kubera) and Sri (=Laksmi) above the door-sill (udumbara). Next does It mention the door-guardian (dvarapala) Kala together with Ganga, and his counterpart Mabakaia together with Yamuna respectively in the right and left jambs or Sakha-s. The text further qualifies that these six divialties be settled there by \"command of Jina\" (Jinaghaya) << dydrapala puja-adikam karma kftva dyarangani kasay-adibhih ardhva-udumbara Yaksesa-Sriyam ca yo atmano dakisina-vama-fakhayoh Kala-Gange Mahakala-Yamune voyased iti devala sakam Jiwajnaya gaanirodhya etc \" Next, 10 the context of the invocation and settling of the 'nacious' Chrt-pratistha), the text refers to the sanctuary (garbhagyha) above the antefix on the fronton (Sukandsa). *Tatab Sukanas ordbvam garbhagshe .. etc \" A little further, the text describes the rites relating to the wall-mouldings and the superstructure of sacred building or prasada. It montions, Page #14 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ 12 M A Dhaky in order, the pot (kumbhaha), the major friezo (jangha),* the spire (fikhara), the neck (kantha) and the myrabolan (amalasaraka); \"Tadanu prasadan gatva kumbhaka jangha-sikhara-kantha amalasarakesu brahma-pancakam Pithivyadini ca tattvadi vinyasya puspaksatadibbih mula. mantrena prasadamadhivasayet,\" The text further refers to the crowding members of the temple, namely, the peak (culaka), the pitcher final (kalaba), the banner (dhvaja) and the sacred wheel (dharmacakra) in order of the sequence 10 placement. <Page #15 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ The Architectural Data In the Nirvanakallka of Padhipta-Kari 13 cubita above, leads to the increase in wealth and food; that wlzich goes above by four, causes increase in the royal treasury; and that which sours high by five cubits, sels in green times just as it results in the augmentation of nation's possessions \"Mukte bastocchrite kalasat karta rogalanka-varjitah syat | Dvihastocchrite bahu-prajo bhavati / Tri-hastocchrite dhana-dhaayair vardhate Catur hast occhrite oppa.vrddbth | Panca-hastoccbrilc subbikam tastraVrddbi s ceti\" The Nirvanahallka dwells on several other vastu rites and associated ceremonies in which it brietly biots to architectural terms, but no other reference is so significant as those cited and briefly discussed in the fore. going pages.

So does Mobanlal Dalicband Desni cf Jaina Sahitya-no Sansksipla Itihasa, Gujarati, Bombay 1933, p. 104.) Munl Kalyanvijaya places it around the fifth century of Vikrama Era or raughly in the fourth century of Chrutian Era (Cf Sri Kalyana kalika Paricaya, Gujarati, Ahmedabad 1956. P 51) The content, the language, the advanced stage hinted by the elaborations in rite, the medieval elegance and finesse and some of the architectural terms used indicate the times not earlier than the end of the tenth or the beginning of the next century. The vastusatras give the name of Nandi instead of Kala In any case Nandi or Kala and Mahakala are brahmanical divinities figuring as door-guardians of the Sivate temples. Its presence in a Jaina work is rather intriguing. The doorguardjans specified for the Jama temple in Western Indian Vastusastrus are quite different and pertain to the Indras of different lokas in general, The fluviatilo goddesses Ganga and Yamuna are of course featured among the door-divinties, The text mentions only kumbhaka which one of the five mouldings of the Vedlbandha or lower part of the wall There is no reference to parha or socle The treatment here is somewhat summary, or it may have implication in terms of xyle, a temple in the late Prathara idiom perhaps In any case the terminology is purely Northern, or more precisely the one that prevailed in Central and Western India from at least the tenth century onwards The Culaka etc., by lnference, could have come above the amalasaraka The calaka could be the conical hat-like member with rounded top as on the Gop temple (Ca Late 6th Century), the Sun temple at Sri-pagara (Ca. 7th century), and as $ Page #16 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ M, A. Dhaky late as the Nandehvara group of temples (Ca, early 10th century), all 10 Saurdefra The Maha-Gurjara and M&ru-Gurjara temples show candrika (moon-cap) instead The placement of dharmacakra seems in accord with the injunction of the vastu Sastras that ayudha or weapon of the divinity be placed above the kalaba as the emblem or cognizance of the particular divinity Since Jina possesses no weapon, dharmacakra reems to be the sudattute thought proper in the context of his temple, 6.

CRITICAL BACKGROUND : As with the European Romances written in Middle Ages, so in Sanskrit, the Romances like Bana's Kadambars and Dhanapala's Tilaka. madjari are, in general, works of fiction in which the imagination is unrestricted In form they were long, resembling works of poetry in rhymed or alliterative prose occasionally interpersed with a verse or two. They concentrate on story rather than on character, and the story concerns unrcal people engaged in strange, ofteu supernatural, adventures. Their wide appeal is as a hterature of escape The remarks of Mr. W. P. Ker though meant for the medieval European authors of twelfth century Romances, strangely apply to Sanskrit Prose-romances variety of incident, remoteness of scene, and all the incredible things in the world, had been at the disposal of medieval authors. Mere furniture counts for a good deal in the best ro.nances, and they are full of descriptions of richca and splendours lo such passages of ornamental description the name of strange people and of foreign kings have the same kind of value &a the names of precious stones, and sometimes they are introduced on their account, Sometime this fashion of rich description and alluston bas been overdone, There may be discovered in some writers u preference for classic subjecta in their ornamental digressions, or for the graceful forms of allegory One function of romance is to make an immedlate literary profit out of all accessible books of learning. It was a quick-witted age and knew how to turn quotations and allusions Much of its art is bestowed to making pedantry look attractive. II DESCRIPTION, SCENE AND RETROSPECT When a povelist balts his moving world and tells us what he secs, says Phyllis Bentley,8 we term that type of narrative as description'; when he moves it slowly and tells us single specific .actions we have learned to term that type of narrative a 'scene', when he rolls bis fictitious world rapidly by the integrated campaign, the come total of a character, & summarised account of his gradual conversion to a new course of life, It can be called 'retrospect' or 'summary'. The description, the scene and the summary have quite distinct uses, distinct parts to play in fiction. The scene gives the reader feeling of Sambodhi 3.1 Page #20 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ N. M. Kansara participating in the action very intensely, and is therefore used for intense moments, such as the cr1918, the climax and a sequence of actions. The summary is most frequentiy used to convey rapidly a sketch of past. The proper use, the right mingiing, of sceno, desoription and summary is the art of fictitions narrative The later novelists, too, employ devices to make summary appear as scene and thus robit of its tedium, casting it in the guise of one character's reflections upon another, dialogue between the two characters and so on.

They are King Meghavahana's meeting with the Vidyadhara Muni (pp. 25-37); his meeting with god Jyalanaprabha (pp. 38-45), which includes int a picture of & sacked Vidyadhara city and its royal palace (pp. 40_41); the king's encounter with the Vetala (pp. 46-52), and with the Goddess An (pp. 54-61); the night-attack and the consequent flerce battle onding with the capture of Samaraketu (pp. 83-94), falling Priyadarsann being cheght by hand by Taraka and their consequent love and marriage (pp. 127 129); the break of voyage by the Dayal forces, their hullabaloo at the time of landing and camplog (pp. 136-141); the preparatory orders of the maltors to their subordinates just before raising the anchors of their vessels at the start of a vovage (pp. 145-146); Harivahana's meeting with Gandhamka (pp. 164-17), bis encounter with a mad elephant (pp. 185-186); Kamalagupta's Invocation of the help of the divine agency to carry the reply back to Harivabana (p. 194); Samaraketu entering the tomple of ad their concl, falling Prive battle onding Page #23 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ Dhanapala and some aspects of modern fictional technique 21 Lord Rsabha ard prayirg to the image of the Jina (pp 216-219), his meeting with Gandharvaka (pp. 222-223), Harivahana's viety of the world as seen from atop the Vaitadhya mountain (pp. 239-240), Harivahana's view of the regions passing below as he is being carried in the sky by the flylog elephant (pp 242-243) his meeting with Malayasundari (pp 256-259), the assembly of the Vidyadhara Emperor Vicitravirya in the temple of Lord Mahavira (pp. 266-267); Sa maraketu sailing in a boat (p 276), Malayasundari's attempt at suicide by hangiog herself and Bandhusundari's attempt at rescuing her (pp. 301-309), Taranagalekha scolding Malayasundari (pp. 335-336), Harvabana's meeting with Tulakamanjari at the temple of Lord Rsabha (pp. 360-366); Mabodara stopping Gandharvaka's aeroplane and cursing him (pp 381-383), the Vidyadhara couple competing for committing suicide by falling first from a precipice (pp 397-398), the goblins trying to hinder Harivabana as lie sat steadily propitiating the mystic Vidyas (pp. 399-400), and the Maharst impartiog religious Instruction to an audience (pp 406-413) (C) RESTROSPECT or SUMMARY Dhanapala has employed the technique of retrospect on a number of Occasions with various intentions, such as keeping the audience abreast of the story related upto a point, drawing their attention to the skill displayed by him in or the purpose served by a particular device or description, and to enhance the curlosity by posing new questions relating to the missing links in the story and thereby setting their imagination to work The following instances are worth noticing particularly in the light of the technique of retrospect (1) The whole passage comprising the questions posed by Samaraketu to Gandharvaka (pp 223, 20ff,) reminds the audience about the past events regarding the promise of Gandharvaka to return to Ayodhya and his mission of delivering the message of Citralekha to Vicitravirya. (2) The incidents about Malayasundart being stealthily kidnapped by the Vidyadharas, her talk with Victravirya, her love at first sight with Samarakrtu, and her attempt at drowning herself in the occan, are recapitulated by way of retrospect in the course of the narration of silent thinking of Malayasundari (p 310, 4ff) (3) A missiog link is supplied when Samaraketu's efforts at saving Malayasundari are pictured briefly by means of a passiog reference to past events of that occasion by Bandhusundari ( P 314, 8ff) (4) The repetition of the same words of Malayasundari (p. 320, 20ff) by Taraka are meant to serve as the lever by him to goad Samaraketu to zo to Kanci, and, while reminding him of the incident of Malayasundari's acceptance of his love by throwing the garland in bls neck and conveying Page #24 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ N 41. Kansara her message apparently addressed to the templc-priest boy but slyly meant for Taraka and Sainaraketu (p 288, 2011), it indicates the future course of events in the narrative (5) The reflective brief monologue of Harivahana, while emphasizing the inoral indirectly, reminds the audience of the turo of events that have taken place in the life of Prince Harivaband consequent to his being carried uff by the flying elephant (346 8ff) (6) While consoliog Malayasundari about the well-being of SamaraRetu, Harivahana recouots in passing the incidents of the nigbt-attack by, and capture of, Samaraketu, bis dejection on listening to the interpretation of the unidentified love-letter, and his message to Malayasundari despat. ched thruugh Gandharvaka (p 317, 1f). (7) The words of Harivabana, retorting Tulakamanjart (p 363, 3fT.) are mcant to recuunt the acidents connected with his first encounter with her in the Cardamon bower. (8) The report of Gandharvaka (pp 378-384) supplies the missing links while linking in passing the past events about his carrying the message to Vicuravirya, ahout Samaraketu's letter despatched through him, about Malayasundari's transportation to a remote hermitage and her attempt at suicide by eating the poisonous fruit there, about Hariyabana being carried away by the flying elephant, about the incidents of the parrot, about the attempts at suicide by Samaraketu and Malayasundars and their rescue, and about the latter finding herself suddenly in the Aeroplane floating in the waters of the Adrstapara lake, (9) In the course of revealing the past births of the heroes tha heroi. nes, the poet summarizes, through the medium of Maharsi (pp. 411ff ). the past events about the meeting of King Megbavahana with god Jvalana. prabha and about Sumalt's dalliance with Svayamprabha. (D) COMINGLING OF THE DISCRIPTIONS, AND ETC. - Over and above the forgoing discussion and enumeration of the instances of descriptions, scenes and summaries, it is necessary to point out to some aspects of the technique of comlogling them in the course of the narrative by Dhanapala. There are instaaces wben the poet, while he describes a particular psychological situation or a mood, seeks to create a scenic effect, as for Instance in the depiction of King Meghavahana's apxiety due to want of a son. Here Dhapapala conjures up a scene wherein the Devarse, the Putrs, the line of the Iksvakus, the Goddess-of-Fortune, the Earth, tbe sub. jects, the youthful ago and the Vedic Dharma, all of them simultaneously urge the king to fulfil his obligations to them by procuring a son in order Page #25 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ Dhanapala and some aspects of modern fictional technique 29 to, respectively, preserve the ancestral scholarly tradition, to ensure uninterrupted oblations, to provide a guide, to supply a resort, to offer a substratum, to give protection, to bid farewell with regrets, and to scold him The overall picture that emerges is that of a man surrounded by a number of grumbling persoos goading or gheraoing him repeatedly to fulfil their demands Here is a specimen of a description assuming the garb of a scene, There are, on the other hand, Instances where the scene takes up the form of a description in the TM, as for instances, in the description of the regions beyond the outskirts of the city of Kanci up to the sea-shore (pp. 118-122) Dhanapala here pictures the rows of villagers standing in wait for the approaching royal procession of Samaraketu when he starts on a Daval expedition The successive series of scenes here consists of the waiting villagers, with their peculiar dresses, thinking habits, peculiar responses to the members of the procession, their, eagerness, the disadvantage taken of their absence in their fields by government officials and robbers, their exploitation by village money-lenders, their houses and so on; all these are depicted in the form of a single compound phrase, running for about two pages, and cast in the garb of descriptive narration, though actually it is a constantly moving focus on various aspects of village life. III NARRATIVE CONVENTION : The commencement of Dhanapala's TM can be classed as the fairy-tale formula\" of \"Once apon a time... and then they lived happily ever after's, which neatly escapsulates the action of the story, placing it in a detached perspective; It cxists in an ordered sequonce, irrelevancies elimina. ted But the narrative is not quite as straightforward as that. In order to involve the listener directly in the story, Dhanapala frequently adopts the convention of pretending that things are happening here and now; imagery and dialogue are made to work before our cyes, though he actually utilizes the past tense in his narration. One advantage of this is that he is free to call upon his characters to appear when he needs them. Since he knows the outcome of his story he is in a position to pick the salient points of its development and show the character in action at those points only.? IV POINT OF VIEW: Some times several narrators exist in the samo novel, 80 that one narrative fits 1Dside another like a set of Chinese boxes, this is Emily Bronte's technique in Wathering Heights': In Dhanapala's TM, too, the role of tho narrator is transferred from the author himself to Samaraketu to Harivahana, the latter's narrative incorporating in itself the narrative of Malayasundars, Gandharvaka and etc., much in the same manner of the above mentioned set of Chinese boxes. Page #26 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ N. M. Kansara V: TIME No narrative exists that does not create some kind of time scheme every novel is both an organization of events in time' and 'a piece of history' 10 One of the functions of the story-teller is to be everywhere at the same time, mindful of past history, conscious of the present and aware of the possibilities of the future In the narrative all known or expected time can be brought to focus on the immediate event, and in the process the \"novellst's clock\" 18 made to tell different times simultaneoualy,1 On the simplest level, wc demand that a povel offer an authentic version of reality 18 Dhanapala seems to be rather particular with his time acheme. The narrative begins about ono vear before the birth of Prince Harivahana, The king met with the Vidyadhara Muni and god Jvalanaprabha and obtained the boon from the Goddess Sri within three months prior to the conception of Harvabana by Queen Madiravati. Sixteen years are allowed to elapse to enable Prince Harivahana to come of age and properly be educated in various arts and crafts so as to equip him for his role of a hero.18 Vajrayudha launched his attack on kanc and laid the siege of the city in the sarad season of Harivahana's sixteenth year 11 It was on Madana-trayodasi day, ie on the thirteenth day of the bright half probably of the month of Caitra, 15 that Vajrayudha demanded the hand of Malayasundari as a price of peace On the same Dight Malayagundari tried to commit suicide in the Kusumakara garden at Kanclo and was saved by Samaraketu who had a brief meeting with her for an hour or so in the presence of Bandhusuadari, before he launched his surprise nigbt-attack against Vajrayudha These events seem to have taken place roughly between about 8-30 pm, to 10-30 pm, Early next morning Malayasundari wag sent away to the remote hermitage of Kulapati santatapa Meanwhile, at about mid-night Samaraketu launched his nigbt-attack17 and was captured alive. And in a few days he arrived at the court of King Meghav hana at Ayodhya roughly in the month of Vaisakha Thus, the slege of Kanc lasted for about six dionths or so. Interestingly enough, it was on the same Madana-trayodasi day of Samaraketu's surprise night-attack at Kunci that Manjiraka came acrosa, and picked up, a strange love letter near the temple of Cupid in the Mattakokila garden at Ayodhya 118 He seems to have kept it with him for about a year, or somewhat less and forgotten it, bat, he seems to be reminded of it perhaps due to some point in the poetic meet reminiscent of a cognate situation ! In the Summer season of Harivahana's seventeenth year Samaraketu accompanied him in the Mattakokila garden,19 and Manjeraka produced Page #27 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ Dhanapala and some aspects of modern fictional technique ,25 the love-letter before the former for interpretation, and Samaraketu began to relato his story. Now, prior to his night-attack against Vajrayudba on Madana-trayodasi, Samaraketu arrived and stayed at Kance for five or six days. Prior to this, he saw Malayasundari at the temple on the Ratnakata island on the day next to that of the Kaumudi-mahotsaya, 1.e the full-moon day of the month of Karttika, el the same day on which the Holy-Bath Ceremony of Lord Mahavira was performed by the Vidyadharas at mid-night. At that time Malayasundari was sixteen, aa and Samaraketu had already completed his eighteenth year,28 Thus, Malayasundari was of the game age as that of Harivahana, and Samaraketu was elder to the prince by two years! It, thus, follows that \"Malayasundars was first seen by Samaraketu about six months prior to his night-attack. Gandharvaka started with Citralekha's errand and mot Harivahana on the same day on which the latter went to the Mattakoklla garden at Ayo dhya. The letter of Samaraketa despatched through Gandharvaka on that day reached Malayasindart the very next day when she was about to drown herself in the Adrolapara lake 1 On the same day, but before the moulago was found by Malayasundari, Gandharvaka incurred the curse of Mahodara and was transformed into a parrot,95 Malayasundari was born to Gandharvadatta in the third or fourth year after the latter's marriage with King Kusumasokhara of Kanc,4 The message sent by Citralek ba, through Gandharvaka, to Vicitravirya shows that the identity of Gandharvadatta was well-established when Gandharvaka first met Harivahana, When Gandharvadatta was kidnapped and soparated from her kins, she was about ten years of age and abe was most probably married in her sixteenth year. Thus, her identity was established roughly in her thirty-sixth year! It was roughly before as many years that King Meghavahana was busy enjoying love-sports with his queens, though fruitlessly so far as a male issuo was concerned And it was roughly in his early fifties that he was epilghtened by the Vidyadhara Muni. (This was roughly the age at which Dhanapala himself was enlightened by Mahendrasarl, throngh his disciplc Sobhana Munt, the younger brother of Dhanapala I) After the departure of Gandharvaks from Ayodhya, Harlvaehana passed the Grisma and the Varsa sasons; he set out on a visit of his domains at the start of the Sarad season, 17 In the meantimo, after Gandharvaka carried unconscloua Malaysanndart in the aeropiane and, baying incurred the curse of Mahodara, bocamo a parrot, Citramaya walted for about six months to exoouto the advice of Gandhryakers 490 then, assuming the form of Harivahana's Sambodhi 3.1 Page #28 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ 16 N M. Kansara favourite elephant, carried him to the Ekasmga region, 89 rhus, Harivahana walted for Gandharvaka for about four months, so and travelled in ble domains for about two months, before he was carried away by the mad clephant, After the disappearance of Harivahana, Samaraketu travelled to the north of Laubitya mountain, and passed through the Vindhya forest and, at the end of six months, arrived at Mount Ekasmga and met Harivahana again. The month of Margasaha passed when he was on his way, *1 Harivahana ceremoniously entered the Vidyadhara city of Gagapavailabba and was coronated as the Emperor of the Vidyadharas on the same day on which Samaraketu arrived and met him on Mount Ekasrriga ? And prior to that, Harivabapa propitiated the mystic Vidyas for six months. This roughly colocides with the time just after his being kidnapped by the flying clephant and bis arrival at Ekanga During the six months of Harivahana's penance, Tilakamanjari was waiting for the expiry of tho period of su months stipulated by her father for searching out the prince! It seems Harivuhana met Tilakamanjari the very next day, was invited by her on the second day, returned to Ayodhya on the third day, returned to Vaitadhya on the fifth day, and started his penance and propitiation of the mystic Vidyas on the sixth day after his arrival to the region for the int time. About a wook may be assumed to have been probably spent by Samaraketa dunag this very perlod 10 waiting for the news about, Hacivana, getting a message from him, and sotting out in search of him, The events move in such a quick succes8100, By the time Hartvahana met Malayasundari for the first time at the temple on Mount Ekarriga, she was about etghteen years. Thus, about two years seem to have clapsed between the periods when Samaraketa and Harichana saw her for the first times respectively. It ta, thus very clear that our dovelist-poet skillfully offered an 'authentio' version of reality by compressing the actual action of the TM In period of roughly two years, though by constantly moving the focus back and forth from past to present, he created an illusion of covering an expanse of three births of both the sets of the heroes and the heroines, Here can we claim that Dhanapaela has succeeded in maintaining the Aristotelian 'unity of time, and with the help of the supernatural the unity of place too, though the places of action are situated at, and separated by, thousands of miles from one another. CAUSE AND CONTINGENCY : Tho novel, in its dealings with human affairs, implicitly acknowledges the place of circumstancial, though not causal, evidence. Questions of Fplevhace are consequently very ambiguous ; what is relevant to a narratiye Page #29 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ Dhanapala and some aspects of modern fictional technique 27 includos both the causal and the contingent,88 Graham Hough makes a tellingly obvious, though often ignored, point the novel Inclados more of merely contingent, the accidental, than any other hterary kind.al Dhanapala has made profuse use of the contingent, and later on revealed the causal behind itThe following fow specimens would suffice to confirm this point (1) The surprise night-attack by Samaraketu8s, which apparontly looks accidental having no connection wbatsoever with the current story of Meghavahana and Harivahana, 18 found later on to be causally connected with Malayasuodari's love for Samaraketu who resorts to that out-of-theway measure in order to uphold the honour of both her father and himself and win her on the strength of his own character rather than elope with ber and betray the trust pat by her, as also by his own, father in him.\" (2) The strange music from the unknown island87 which attracts the attention of, and impela, Samaraketu to trace the source of It looks quito contingent But we later on know that it was the music of the festival of the Holy-Bath Coremony of Lord Mahavira,88 (3) The sudden appearance of a parrot on tho scene in response to the invocation of Kamalagupta84 looks atrangely accidental and mysterious at the point, but the myatery turns into a natural causal consequence when we find that the parrot is none else but Gandharvaka, cursed by Mahodara, and that he carried the message in keeping with his promise to Hartvahana, VII CHARACTER AND SYMBOLISM. Just as dialogue and manners can be used by the novelist to 'place' bis characters socially and culturally, so a fabrio of symbolism may enablo the writer to create a moral or intellectual framework for the action of his novel, Symbolism allows an author to link the limited world of his characters to one of the greateat systems of values, so that we are made to compare the happening in the novel with their mythological or historical paralleis. Specific actions in the story illustrate general patterns of behaviour, and the private character acquires a new importance when he 1s seen in the light of 218 symbolic counterpart. A aystem of symbolism usually depends on the existence of a commonly known body of Ideas and beliefs. In Western literature three basic systems recur most frequently ; the symbolism of Christianity, of classical mythology and of Romanticisin. Christian morality 18 of course ingralned into the history of the novel, a Dhanapala's TM has its own system of symbolism Whon once we keep in mind the extreme respect and love he had for his royal patrons like Munja and Bhoja, the characters like Meghavahana, Harivahana and Page #30 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ N. M, Kansara Sumaraketu reveal lo them many of the traits of their personality. And in view of the environment in which the poet lived, it la but natural that the symbolism of classical Hindu and Jalpa mythology and morality lavariably enter into the working of the charactor, The typical Jainistic attitude of Harivabana to huntlog, the importanco of pilgrimage to Jalna holy places, the merit carned by building Jalna, tompics, the religious fervour in worshipping the images of the Tirthan - karts, the implicit faith in them as the Saviours from the interminable ocean of transmigratory existence, as the Supreme Guides on the path of Eternal Blise, the necessity of putting undidching falth in their teaching - all these values permeate in the whole body of the TM. The uponding Vindhya forest symbolizes the common world of pleasaros, the \"Adrstaparasuthsara\" of the TM; the Adretapara lake is the symbol of the essence of religion, here Jainism; the heavonly enjoyments are symbolized by the garden oncompassing the Jalna tompie; and the state of Final Emancipation is symbolized by the Jaisa temple with an image of the Torthankaras lastalled thercia. Again, the characters also symbolize particular rellgous attitutes, Thus, Harivahana represents in essence a perfectly devout Jalpa householder; Samaraketu & man ongrossed in worldly pleasures and non-Jalna. way of Itfe; the flying clephant symbolizes the divine assistance availablo to the devout followers Vlewed from tbls symbolical angle the TM afforda a glimpse of the fourth dirocasion, VIN CHARACTER AND LOCATION: The sense of the visual interaction betweon character and landscape can be a striking a featuro of fiction as a necessary element in cinema, Walle the twentieth-century development of movies has sharpened the weiter's Awareness of the techniquo, effective landscape is not essentially a # modern device. Dhanapala, and for that matter all the wrlters liko Subandhu, Bang, Dindio and others, of classical Sanskrit Prose-Romances, are very much fond of giving elaborato pictures of the cities, the palaces, and of the gardens, the temples, the river-banks, the lying-in chambers and etc., where the action of the novel takes place. Dbanapala's descriptions of Ayodhya and Kuace, the royal palaces of Meghavahana and Tuakamanjari, the Mattakoklla garden, tbe Adprlapara lake and the sandy shore thereof, the Jaint temples, the Ratnakata island, the Vladbya forest, the Asoka tree in the Kusumakara garden - all these scrve as a luxuriously beautiful and uppropriate background for, and location of various actions in the TM. Page #31 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ Dhana pala and some aspects of modern fictional technique IX : CHARACTER AND SUBMERGED FORM Itta a character of the novel that It is in a constant process of Invention: a particular type of story gains currency, lasts for twenty-five or fifty years - In the case of Sangkrit novels of medieval ages, for a century or two -, then fados. Over the same period new categories will have come Into the oxistence and cach will probably have only a limited apan. The history of the novel is littered with the husk of such temporary forms. The eigbtoenth century picturesque novel, the romance, the Victorian adventure atory and improving moral tale all these were appropriate to the conditions of their own time. Sooner or later they became over-worked, and for a time were dropped altogether ag useful structures But the writers of overy poriod have returned to these apparently burnt-out types, adopting thom for an Ironic or satiric purposo.45 Though we cannot claim that Dhanapala \"revived\" the form of narration developed by Bana in order to adopt it for some satiric purpose, wo are gure that he adopted it to his own purpose of a gubtly allegorical narrative. A sobtlo satirical polot of view with reference to tho structure of Bana'a novela may possibly be found in the remarks where he calls the Katbus based on the story from Gunadhya's BIhatkatby ag \"veritablo cloak gewed from rags\".46 Moreover, a reference in the TM to an important incident from Bana's Kadambari, viz., the one conceroing tho curse locurred by Valsampayana and his transformation into a parrot, Gandharvaka's remarks about the lacredibility of this motif if handled without proper rational basis, and the passing reforence to the lack of the knowledge of dramaturgy marring the peculiarity of the literary form, if viewed In propor perspective of literary history and of Dhanapala's performance, would definitoly reveal the subtlo satirical vein in his master piece with referonce to handling of this form by his predecessors. X. CONCLUSION The above discussion, with reference to the technique of fiction as found in tho modern Western fiction, illustrates how the techniques which are deemed to be modern by modern critics of both the occidental and oriental literatures, were in fact not quite unknown to the mediaval Sanskrit writers of Proso-Romances, and herein lies the universal value and appoal of Sanakrit Prose-Romance as medieval Indian novel.

It is a tribute to their catholicity and sagacity that some of the rarest works of different sects are found in Jaina Bhandaras only. However, despito all safeguards natural factors coupled with wanton destruction by foreign marauding bordes have resulted in the loss of a sizablo mass of literature. Vivahavallabhamohakavya (VM) 18 one such work which sooms to have been irretrivably lost. It is known only through its 17th canto, the full text of which is happily preserved in a Ms in the collection of Agarchand Nabata, the noted Jaina savant and antiquarian of Bikaner, The M8 itself is defective Soven of its folios are lost. The remalning seventeen (8-24) contain, besides the extant canto of VM, ton shorter works or parts thereof. The Ms is not dated, but, on palcographic grounds, can be assigned to the 15th century As the colophon would indicate, the VM had for Its theme the lifeaccount of Tirthankara Neminatha, with particular stress on his proposed marriage with Rajimati, the charming daughter of Ugrasena. The present canto sets forth, in charming language, Rajmatr's admonition to Neml and her realisation of the knowledge of self. In view of the sequenco of events of Nomi's lifo as described in Hariyathapurana of Jinagena I, the admonition could have been occasioned by her robuttal through Nemi's sodden acceptance of monkhood in proference to the joys of marttal life. The young Nemi had countenancod bis marriage but was so repelled by the proposed mass anmal-killings that he abandoned it right in the midst of its execution. This left poor Rajimati aghast But instead of dissipating herself in mundane pursuits she follow in the footsteps of her Lord, In this philosopbical canto she makes a fervent appeal to the Lord to bloss her with spiritual illamination Following this she feels with the poet that knowledge of self alono 18 real. All olge is illusion. It is a gateway to salvation. (3) This is also quintessence of the teachings of the master (30). It acts at naught the physical and mental afflictions and leads to the fulfiment of desires, Self-realisation stabiliscs the mind which enables the person to concentrato on deeper problems of life. (24, 27). Nemi's life has been the subjoct of two sapskrit Mahakavyas In Jaina literature, Vagbhata's Nemintryana and Kirtiraja's Neminathamahakavya are so well known. Considering the events as set forth thorein, it can be safely assumed that the VM must have contained at least threo more cantos, describing the Lord's ponance and sormon and his attalpment of knowledge (Kalyalya and salvation.)

Ag such its loss is to be lamented. Tho extant canto of the poem is written in Adi yamaka, the last word or a part thereof of the proceeding verse forming the beginning of each following verso, interspersed with other figures of spoech like U pama.
