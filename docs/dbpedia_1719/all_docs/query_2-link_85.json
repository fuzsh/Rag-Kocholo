        "text": "Who is the DJ with the most worldwide appeal? There are quite a few gunnin’ for the title, and Marshmello just firmly planted his sugary flag in the second-most populated country in the world with an international collaboration titled “Biba,” a Hindi-language crossover with Indian stars Pritam and Shirley Setia.\n\nMarshmello’s signature synth sounds bang in the background of a tune driven by rhythmic guitar starring some powerful male vocals from singers Pradeep Singh Sran and Dev Neg intermittently.. The song was co-composed by Pritam, a Bollywood music icon. Shirley Setia comes in for the feminine touch a couple verses in. The hook is hot and ready for dance floors from Bombay to Los Angeles, which is exactly what the masked one had in mind when he got in the studio.\n\n“I went to India for the first time ever a few years ago, and I had no clue how much it would change me,” Marshmello is qouted in a press release. “The amount of love, strength and compassion the people of India have is remarkable. I’ve never been somewhere where I felt so appreciated and loved by so many, and from that moment on, it became one of my favorite places. I always wanted to do something for the culture. When I connected with Pritam, I told him we have to do something fun together, something that makes you want to get up and dance, and I think ‘Biba’ is perfect for that.”\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\n“Biba” is out on Artist Originals, a label that specializes in bridging the gap between Western and Indian audiences. It’s the same label responsible for Dillon Francis‘ remix of “Bom Diggy” by Zack Knight and Jasmin Walia.\n\n“When I first met [Marshmello’s manager] Moe [Shalizi], he told me he grew up in a house that had Devdas and SRK [Shahrukh Khan] movies playing all day,” Indian streaming service JioSaavn COO Gaurav Sharma is quoted. “Music is an incredible way for cultures to connect and find common ground, and that was really the genesis of all of this. Mello wanted to make music that was authentic to India for the millions of fans he had here. He wanted to be part of the culture — not just feature in it, and that meant a lot to us. Music in India is evolving — it’s taking more risks, it’s becoming more artist driven, and it’s becoming more international. ‘Biba’ represents all of that.”\n\nCheck out “Biba” below, out now on AO."
