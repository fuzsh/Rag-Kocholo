Her forthcoming release, “Akhian,” is a rendition from Late Surinder Kaur’s folk classic. This song touches a chord with Biba and she decided to do a remake. Biba said,\n\n“It’s such a popular song, it’s one of my favorites I wanted to make a modern version for the younger generation to hear the song too.”\n\nLook out for a totally different concept in the accompanying music video, directed by Hemant Thavathia and shot in USA at beautiful ‘Wing’s Castle’ in upstate NY. The song is produced by talented singer and producer Mandeep Dhaliwal, from Calgary, Canada who has released multiple albums of his own with Jugni records. “Akhian” also has a remix produced by – Sorin Pavelesco, a Canadian producer and member of BTB music productions, and rapper Mr. Bolly. Check out the remix of “Akhian.”\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1UgCjb5pPU\n\nBiba was discoverd by the legendary Bollywood and Bhangra singer, Daler Mendhi who pushed her to release her first pop album in 2009 titled ‘Biba.’ The album was produced by Bollywood music director Santokh Singh (Channa Veh Ghar Aja) and launched in India by Bollywood singer Mika Singh.\n\nThe album hit the charts across the globe bringing overnight success to this young starlet. She then went on to releasing her second album in 2011 ‘Biba For You’ this was launched by Bollywood maestro singer Bappi Lahiri in Mumbai. Since then Biba Singh has toured around India, USA, Canada and opened for acts like RDB, Imran Khan and Bollywood Singers. She was born and raised in New York, but very often travelled back to the UK and India, and parents always stressed about culture and knowing their roots. Biba is not just a pretty entertainer but a Doctor by profession and specializes in psychiatry!\n\n“Education was always very important in my home, but I always had a strong passion for music as well. When I completed my education, I decided that now I could pursue my music professionally as well as being a Doctor by day. I love both my professions and I’m thankful to God for giving me the opportunity to utilize both” ~ Biba Singh.\n\n“Akhian” is out NOW on iTunes and be sure to keep it locked on Urban Asian for more updates on Biba Singh!\n\nPost Views: 5"
