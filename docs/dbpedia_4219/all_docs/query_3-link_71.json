        "text": "How would you describe your style?\n\nPlayful, colourful and theatrical.\n\nHow important are your stage outfits to the performance?\n\nVery important. People coming to the show expect a spectacle.\n\nWhy do you always end up going barefoot?\n\nI try to keep my shoes on for several songs, but I like to run around on stage and at some point, the heels have to go. I can't have the shoes jeopardising the performance - even if they are Louboutins.\n\nDo you separate your stage wardrobe from your everyday?\n\nNo, it's interchangeable. I hold on to key pieces but I am loaned a lot of outfits by PRs and designers that I wear once - giving them a hell of an outing - before returning them.\n\nWhich colours and shapes suit you best?\n\nI'm a fan of high waists - it's like a classic embrace by a handsome man - cinching you around the middle.\n\nI've also got a weakness for off-the-shoulder tops, emphasising the neck and collarbone, which is a very feminine place.\n\nAs for colour, I embrace it.\n\nI lived with my grandmother in Malawi for a year when I was 10 - she was a creative seamstress and I was inspired by that and the tropical existence.\n\nWhat are your favourite fashion eras?\n\nThe early 40s for the pencil skirt, plus the 60s, 70s and 80s - society was going through so many changes and women were becoming liberated.\n\nThe fashions reflected that.\n\nWho is your style icon?\n\nApart from my grandmother, my mother.\n\nMy friends were amazed by her outfits when she picked me up from school.\n\nDo you have a beauty secret?\n\nI particularly like Mizani Supreme oil with argan oil, which makes my hair easy to manage.\n\nWho is your favourite designer?\n\nYves Saint Laurent stands out.\n\nDo you have a favourite high-street shop?\n\nI'm not a fan of mass production but I like the collaboration between designer and high-street shops, which makes fashion affordable.\n\nAre you a fan of vintage?\n\nYes, I love charity shops and markets like Borough, Deptford and the Columbia road. You can find real gems.\n\nHow many shoes and handbags do you own?\n\nI'm not a handbag fan - I keep everything in one and use it to death. I have a lot more shoes - probably around 40 pairs.\n\nIs there an \"old favourite\" you turn to in a wardrobe crisis?\n\nI don't have wardrobe crises - the trick is to be inventive and rework your wardrobe.\n\nWhat is the most expensive item in your wardrobe?\n\nA leather jacket that cost Â£10,000, but I didn't pay for it - I sang for it.\n\nWhat is the oldest item in your wardrobe?\n\nA long, pink, early-60s dress I bought as a teenager.\n\nWhat is your best piece of fashion advice?\n\nFind your style identity. I found mine early on, probably because I'm a twin. I was fed up of being dressed the same as my sister and wanted to be seen as an individual.\n\nWhat is your favourite piece of jewellery?\n\nA copper bangle my mum gave me when we were in Zimbabwe.\n\nWhat item of clothing would you save from a burning house?\n\nThe pieces given to me by my mother and my grandmother.\n\nShingai is the celebrity ambassador for the Afro, mixed-race and curly hair brand, Mizani, part of the L'Oreal Professional Products Division.
