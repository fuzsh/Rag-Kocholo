        "text": "Times Square, a source of unembarrassed endorsement, does not have a billboard for the London band Noisettes. This is odd, because Noisettes are what billboards were invented to announce: improbably big entertainment. If you can see Noisettes during their American tour, which runs through April, do so. If you can’t, buy their début album, “What’s the Time Mr. Wolf?” (Universal), a smart, relentlessly exuberant thirty-eight-minute demonstration of chutzpah and musicianship, despite the band’s affinity with the fizzy amateur energy of punk.\n\nThe twenty-six-year-old singer Shingai Shoniwa, the daughter of a single mother from Zimbabwe, studied circus skills at a London youth club as a teen-ager, and performed briefly in an obscure rock band called Sonarfly with her Noisettes songwriting partner, the guitarist Dan Smith. Shoniwa looks like an African supermodel, and has a penchant for wearing face paint and fur hats. Onstage, she entirely ignores the performance tendencies of indie rock: slouch, stand still, lean, and hop, if pressed. She leaps, crouches, bangs the floor, runs around, and waggles her tongue, if necessary. Shoniwa’s voice occasionally sounds a bit like PJ Harvey’s, especially on the pounding “IWE,” if Harvey were a bit higher on life. There are moments when Shoniwa screams like a 1976 punk, and then drops down and sings like a balladeer. The range of “What’s the Time Mr. Wolf?” is flummoxing in the most pleasant way. “Cannot Even (Break Free)” is a waltz that starts like one of Radiohead’s quieter moments, forgets what it’s doing, and turns into a Led Zeppelin song with an extremely sharp edge. “Don’t Give Up” will make more than one person think of a very hopped-up version of the White Stripes, while “Count of Monte Christo” is a sunny acoustic number that might make it past a Norah Jones fan. Except for this bit when Shoniwa starts to, well, let loose. Which is exactly what you want her to do. Preferably near you, and often. ♦"
