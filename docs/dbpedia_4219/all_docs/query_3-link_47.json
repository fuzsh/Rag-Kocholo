        "text": "Noisettes singer Shingai Shoniwa has spoken for the first time of her ordeal at the hands of a stalker, saying it was like \"murder in slow motion\".\n\nThe musician's ex-partner Pardeep Sall bombarded her with phone calls and texts, and even entered her flat, after refusing to accept their break up.\n\nStalking is a \"personal terrorism\" that left her fearing for her safety and forced her parents to move house, she told the Victoria Derbyshire programme.\n\nSall was convicted of stalking in May.\n\nHe was also found guilty of harassment and given a 12-week suspended prison sentence and an indefinite restraining order. He denies the offences, and is appealing the conviction.\n\nShoniwa, whose band had a hit with Don't Upset the Rhythm (Go Baby Go) in 2009, made the decision to speak publicly to highlight a call by MPs and campaigners for the maximum stalking prison sentences to be doubled from five to 10 years.\n\nHer own experience of stalking, which began last year, was a \"terrorising campaign\" that was like being \"killed from the inside out slowly\", she said.\n\n\"It's literally like murder in slow motion. It's a sinister kind of personal terrorism that should not be tolerated,\" she said.\n\n\"It's nothing that I would wish upon anybody.\n\n\"The perpetrator involved in my case used to brag about having ruined other people's lives before, and that's when I saw warning signs.\n\n\"He would go around bragging that he was above the law and it was really exciting to damage people and try to play this psychological game that doesn't just affect them, but extends to their families and dozens of people around them.\"\n\nThe \"ricochet effect\" of the harassment left her constantly worried about the safety of her friends and family, Shoniwa said.\n\nThe judge who sentenced Shoniwa's stalker said he had been \"in the grips of a very powerful obsession\", according to reports., external"
