        "text": "There are perks that come with being not-quite-famous yet.\n\nFor one, you can sit on a fan’s lap without getting bum rushed by worried security. At a bigger, more high-profile venue, Noisettes singer and bassist Shingai Shoniwa would have been surrounded by a team of beefy bodyguards after venturing into the crowd.\n\nBut at a moderately crowded Great Scott in Allston on Monday night, she hopped off the stage, crooned from a table top, then plopped into a listener’s lap and sang to him, no problem.\n\nShoniwa is certainly the focal point of this buzz-worthy trio’s indie rock/r & b aesthetic. She resembles a slightly less fierce version of Grace Jones mixed with the demure diva of Diana Ross. She sounds a bit like Welsh soul siren Duffy and seems more like a character in a superhero drama than a real person. Over-the-top and mysterious, Shoniwa isn’t quite a bad girl, but she’s on her way there.\n\nNow two albums deep into their career, the up-and-coming London outfit – Shoniwa, guitarist Dan Smith and drummer Jamie Morrison – opened their hourlong set with the title track of their sophomore album, “Wild Young Hearts” (due out in the United States on Sept. 22) and the retro-flavored “Never Forget You.”\n\nActually, most of their new songs are retro-flavored: the New Wave-inspired “Saturday Night,” the ’80s rock shuffle of “24 Hours” and the disco fun of “Don’t Upset the Rhythm (Go Baby Go),” which lived up to its name.\n\nAs such, the Noisettes don’t have an easily definable identity. They switched from borderline psychedelic rock to Motown-inspired r & b to stripped-down numbers such as “Every Now and Then” and the acoustic “Sometimes.”\n\nShoniwa certainly has the energy and chameleonlike persona necessary to suit any song. She delivered high-pitched yelps and yaps on “Don’t Give Up” (from the band’s debut, “What’s the Time, Mr. Wolf?”), while writhing appropriately on the meditative “Atticus.”\n\nThough the group’s between-song banter got tedious, their Motown-meets-uptown flavor was consistently appealing.\n\nNew York duo Phantogram offered a hypnotic, ethereal opening set that seemed to defy sonic rules. Using only a guitar and keyboard, the technologically-assisted twosome of Sarah Barthel and Joshua Carter created textured, spacey soundscapes reminiscent of Zero 7, Moby and Pink Floyd.\n\nNOISETTES, with PHANTOGRAM. At Great Scott, Allston, Monday night"
