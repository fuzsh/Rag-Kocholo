        "text": "London – Best known as the frontwoman of indie rock band Noisettes, Shingai Shoniwa has made her mark on both music and fashion. She launched into stardom with the release of the band's album Wild Young Hearts in 2009, which achieved several top 10 hits including chart-toppers Don't Upset the Rhythm (Go Baby Go) and Never Forget You (which in 2020 became a Tiktok trend accumulating over 3 billion views). Multi-talented performer, Shingai has captivated audiences with her electric stage presence, playing at festivals such as Coachella and Glastonbury, and collaborating with music legends such as Patti Smith, Annie Lennox, Paul McCartney, and Dizzee Rascal. Shingai is also known for her eccentric style and bold stage costumes, in keeping with her genre-bending sound. A selection of ten pieces from her innovative and flamboyant wardrobe, including designs by Thierry Mugler and Jean Paul Gaultier, will be offered at Bonhams Pop X Culture sale on Thursday 20 October at New Bond Street, London.\n\nMeg Randell, Head of Bonhams Designer Handbags and Fashion Department, commented: \"For Shingai, fashion and music go hand in hand. A true fashionista at heart, the stage and video-worn garments showcased within our sale offer us insight into her creative and expressive personality, many of which will remind fans of times when they have seen one of show-stopping performances. With items from designers such as Dolce & Gabbana, Thierry Mugler, Moschino, and Chanel, as well as custom pieces like the broken-hearted jacket - they all have a story to tell.\"\n\nShingai Shoniwa commented: \"Working with Bonhams has been a riveting experience from the start. With their extensive knowledge of Pop Culture, we've been able to jointly create and curate this collection. These pieces symbolize the most epic moments in my career so far and I hope they are valued as much as we have cherished them, looking forward to them taking on a new lease of life. The proceeds from the sale will go towards my new chapter as an independent artist and consciously creative entrepreneur. Team Shingai is building a creative sustainability project in Southern Africa and this sale will send us one step closer to our dream. Have fun and enjoy the looks - for they all have a story to tell.\"\n\nThe selection in the sale includes:\n\nShingai Shoniwa: A Golden Sequin Halterneck Top Worn on the Noisettes Wild Young Hearts Album Cover Photoshoot, 2009, estimate £300 - 400\n\nShingai says: \"The photoshoot for the \"Wild Young Hearts\" album artwork had to be epic. And the theme of my love of nature running through my style showed no sign of letting up. I love the contrast of this gold 70s halter neck top against the red flowers. Nasrin Jean- Baptiste was my stylist at that time, we created some unforgettable looks together across our 3 albums and countless tours between 2008 - 2013. My style is eccentric yet reflective of my Bantu and bold South London roots. We really changed the game in terms of the landscape of music and fashion, paving the way for women of colour to be more carefree in their style choices and influencing the style of female artist such as Janelle Monae, Lizzo, Solange, Lianne La Havas and Laura Mvula.\n\nShingai Shoniwa: Worn at 2012 Olympics, 'Broken-Heart' Jacket, 2012, estimate £500 – 700\n\nShingai says: \"This outfit means so much to me and I'm definitely going to miss it. It was designed in collaboration with Mieke Schady - a dear friend of mine based in New York. She really understood how we could take the Shingai stage looks to the next level. I really like to make statements so that the clothes almost match up with the essence and the mood of the music that I'm writing at that time. We were touring the \"Wild Young Hearts\" album and got the opportunity to perform at the 2012 Olympics Festival. The patterns around the side of the heart symbolize my Bantu roots - an eccentric pattern work that was often known in Ndebele and Shona culture. The gold represents the abundance of gold that we have within ourselves and beneath our soil and the heart represents my generosity of spirit and commitment in doing what I love, which is music.\"\n\nShingai Shoniwa / Tour de Force: Worn at V Festival, Red Three-Piece Ensemble, 2011, estimate £600-800\n\nShingai says: \"I'm a big fan of an outfit that can be worn separately or as one ensemble if you're feeling brave, this outfit was inspired by armour. On stage, I invoke the spirit of the warrior goddesses that came before me using my superpowers to move the audience. We toured our music with creative audacity and would rarely turn down a show, so the sheer number of performances was a Tour de Force in itself. When Nasrin (my stylist at the time) and I discovered the work of Tour de Force - an independent, one-woman brand - we knew that she would make something unforgettable. The contrast of sewing styles with the lattice embellishments on the hips and legs reminded me of Gogo Elizabeth as she never wanted to waste offcuts and would stitch together different fabrics into a cohesive piece. The more you get to know this outfit, the more you appreciate the finer details such as the tasselling on the waist and the statement shoulders that form dramatic golden spirals.\n\nShingai Shoniwa / Jean Paul Gaultier: Worn on Noisettes \"Never Forget You\" Music Video, Jean Paul Gaultier Body-Con Dress, early 1990s, estimate £300 – 500\n\nShingai says: \"I hail from a family of fearless yet flamboyant women. My mum was a teenage freedom fighter who arrived here in exile during the late 70s Rhodesian war. How they managed to maintain such vibrant style on a tight budget in grey Thatcherite Britain never ceases to amaze me. I came into music via theatre and the dramatic arts so safe or middle of the road stage outfits were never going to cut it for me. This 90s Gaultier Dress was to grace my opening scene in the video of \"Never Forget You\", has had over 3 billion streams and a huge recent revival on TikTok, so I guess she was worth every penny.\"\n\nShingai Shoniwa / Dolce & Gabbana: Worn at Glastonbury, The Annual Girlguiding Big Gig at Wembley Arena, Dolce & Gabbana Gold and Silver Lamé Top, 2009, estimate £400 - 600\n\nShingai says: \"This piece was fun to wear and more comfortable that it looks. I love pairing haute couture or exceptionally bougie pieces with my own eccentric flare. I chose the lightning bolt leather guitar strap to match it with my Fender Jaguar Bass, this way I can ensure that even people in way back at Wembley and at the main stage at Glastonbury could enjoy it.\"\n\nShingai Shoniwa / Amechi: Worn at Trabendo, Paris; Capital FM Jingle Bell Ball at O2 Arena, London, Black, estimate £400-600\n\nShingai says: \"I first met Amechi Ihenacho when I was living in a warehouse flat in pre- gentrified Dalston, an area that was vibrant, super diverse and super affordable for artists. Amechi had a vintage shop which doubled up as his atelier and occasional bar, frequently visited by Pam Hogg, Florence Welch and Paloma Faith. I told him I wanted a cape and high waisted shorts for an upcoming tour and when he showed me the fabric he had in mind (black sequins with giant crimson roses), I almost fainted.\n\n\"I first debuted the outfit at the Trabendo in Paris, it was the last night of what had been an unforgettable European Tour with Muse. When I arrived, there were a thousand and one red roses sent and set on stage by an Italian super fan. After the show I asked why a thousand and one roses, he replied that the most roses ever sent to a singer were a thousand - to J.Lo. However, he felt that my talent eclipsed any singer that he has witnessed for a long time and the thousand and one roses went on to provide the stage decoration for our final tour that year.\"\n\nShingai Shoniwa / Jean Paul Gaultier: A Pop Art 'Smoking Lips' Skirt, Autumn 1992, estimate £200 - 300\n\nShingai says: \"This skirt was gifted to me by a friend of mine in Brockley, London, where I grew up. She was the girlfriend of the frontman of Known - a band whose lead singer, guitar player was often referred to as the Jimi Hendrix of Lewisham. I love the early 90s love letters to 60s pop art where designers such as Gaultier and Moschino Cheap & Chic among others would adorn classic haute couture shapes with brazen and bizarre nods to previous key moments in style and design. I feel that it is important for artists regardless of their craft to have an understanding or at least respect of their lineage. I find that the work, case in point of Azzedine Alaïa, Yves Saint Laurent and so many others, is only enriched by the inclusion of their North African Roots.\"\n\nShingai Shoniwa / Thierry Mugler: Worn at V Festival; Glastonbury, A Canary Yellow Two-Piece Skirt Suit, 1990s, estimate £300-500\n\nShingai says: \"This Mugler piece was found by my stylist at one of my favourite vintage shops - Rellik on Golborne Road. I love this shop as it always has rare and archive pieces and I tend to like the more weird and wonderful stuff when it comes to vintage fashion.\n\nThierry Mugler has always been one of my favourite designers. I love his signature scalloping around the neckline and shoulder pads that give the outfit an edgy and empowering look.\"\n\nShingai Shoniwa / Moschino: Worn at the Scala, London, Moschino Couture 'Golden Needle' Playsuit, 2009, estimate £200 - 300\n\nShingai says: \"The show at the Scala was a pivotal moment for us as we opened up for The Heavy who were huge in America. It was an incendiary performance and led to our first big American tour. Almost every stage outfit has a story as my spirit would usually lead me to a piece. When I clocked the Moschino playsuit embellished with gold sewing needles it automatically reminded me of my grandmother. I was sent to live with her upon my father's passing when I was 9. She was an important matriarchal figure in our village not far from Lilongwe, Malawi. She was also the most skilled dressmaker and designer for miles. Gogo (grandmother in Zulu) and I would bond whilst I sat at the base of the sewing machine, I was her little assistant, threading needles of all shapes and sizes as she proceeded to sew up my broken heart. That year spent with Gogo cemented my desire to create as I saw how happy it made people. I'd give anything for Gogo to have been able to see me shine in an outfit so symbolic of who she was, black and gold, but she passed away when I was 15. Her legacy lives on in my style, creativity and of course my love of unique playsuits.\""
