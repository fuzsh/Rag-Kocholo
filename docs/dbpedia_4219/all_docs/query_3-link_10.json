        "text": "Shingai will be launching her new solo EP with a gig at the Albany on 13 September.\n\nHuge stage persona, Shoniwa looks like what the New Yorker called “an African supermodel”, and she frequently performs in bare feet while wearing face paint or fur hats on stage.\n\nShingai Shoniwa has provided backing vocals for different indie rock, electronic, and punk rock artists and helped celebrate Jack Daniel’s birthday in Lynchburg, Tennessee. She has performed and collaborated with rapper Dizzee Rascal and featured in Jools’ Annual Hootenanny (aired by BBC), where she performed a version of Don’t Upset the Rhythm with Joolls Holland.\n\nRead more about Shingai Shoniwa.\n\nTop image shows Shingai Shoniwa."
