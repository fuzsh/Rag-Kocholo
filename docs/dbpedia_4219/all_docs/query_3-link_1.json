        "text": "British musical artist (born 1981)\n\nMusical artist\n\nShingai Elizabeth Maria Shoniwa[2] ( shing-GHY; born 1 September 1981), known professionally as Shingai is a British[3] singer, songwriter, musician, and actress, best known as the vocalist and bassist for the English indie rock band Noisettes. In 2017, she launched her solo career and released her debut solo album in 2020.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nShingai was born and grew up in Lewisham, South East London.[4] Her parents are both Zimbabweans who migrated to the United Kingdom. That experience, Shoniwa says, informs her music. \"Wanting to escape from reality can inspire the greatest and most trivial creative natures in people,\" and \"I think escapism is something that connects all of us. Everybody has their own little soundtrack, and I guess I’m trying to make my own soundtrack to my escape plan. I want people to realise that there's so much more.\"[5] Her first name, Shingai, means \"be bold/courageous/strong\" in the Shona language.[6][7]\n\nShe first wanted to be an actress, and for a while joined the Lost Vagueness crew as a burlesque performer.[8][9][10] She studied circus skills at a London youth club as a teenager.[8] When she graduated, she attended art school and dabbled in local theatre. Her classmate and friend, Dan Smith, would hold what she called \"ridiculous jam sessions — too many people strumming broken guitars thinking they're Syd Barrett\". She then went on to study at the BRIT School for Performing Arts & Technology in Croydon.[11] One day she joined him singing, and the two quickly formed a group called the Noisettes.[11] Their first release in 2002 was on a compilation called \"Raison D'Etre London Vol 1\" Compiled by Yvan Serrano (Dustaphonics) regrouping some of London's up and coming artists, also featuring Charlie Winston among others.\n\nMusic career\n\n[edit]\n\nCritical response to Shingai's performance has largely been positive. Rolling Stone magazine said that \"Shingai is a living, breathing manifestation of the rock & roll spirit, with a voice that is equal parts Iggy Pop and Billie Holiday.\"[12] In her stage persona, Shingai looks like what the New Yorker called \"an African supermodel\",[8] and she frequently performs in bare feet while wearing face paint or fur hats on stage.[8]\n\nShingai has provided backing vocals for different indie rock, electronic, and punk rock artists including, Guillemots with their song \"Made Up Love Song#43\" and \"Over the Stairs\". Shingai made an appearance on Annie Lennox's 2007 album, Songs Of Mass Destruction on the single \"Sing\". The track, about the fight against HIV and AIDS, included 22 other renowned female artists such as Madonna, Melissa Etheridge, Gladys Knight, and Celine Dion.[13]\n\nShingai, along with Patti Smith and Juliette Lewis, helped celebrate Jack Daniel's birthday in Lynchburg, Tennessee, on 13 October 2007. The three were joined by The New Silver Cornet Band for the show, which took place at the company's distillery. The event was part of the 157th birthday celebrations for Jack Daniel, who was born in September 1850. The Birthday JD Set opened to specially invited guests and competition winners only.[14]\n\nOn 19 November 2009, Shingai performed with rapper Dizzee Rascal at the Royal Albert Hall for an event to raise money for charity. Additional collaboration of Shingai with Rascal related to a version of the latter's song \"Holiday\".\n\nShingai is credited for vocals of Dennis Ferrer's \"Hey Hey\" dance/house track, released in late November 2009.\n\nOn 31 December 2009 Shingai was featured in the Annual Hootenanny 2010 show (aired by BBC), where she performed together with Jools Holland a version of \"Don't Upset the Rhythm\" and contributed to the vocals of tail-song \"Down By The Riverside\".\n\nIn 2013, Shingai appeared on the album Chrome Black Gold by Chrome Hoof, singing lead on four tracks. She also made appearances live with the band.[15]\n\nShe released her first solo album, Too Bold, in October 2020.[16]\n\nOn June 25, 2021 Mark Knight from Toolroom Records released his first album of original music entitled Untold Business with a track titled \"Feel The Pressure\" featuring Shingai on vocals.\n\nOther endeavours\n\n[edit]\n\nShingai joined Amnesty International's Make Some Noise and appeared in an Instant Karma! video singing John Lennon's song \"Imagine\" to raise awareness for the conflict in Darfur.[17]\n\nOn 8 September 2009, Shingai appeared as a special guest on the Five discussion programme The Wright Stuff.\n\nShingai is also signed with NEXT Model Management in London.[18]\n\nShingai provides the voice of the character Teal on the CBeebies show The Adventures of Abney & Teal.\n\nSolo discography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nToo Bold (2020)\n\nExtended plays\n\n[edit]\n\nAncient Futures (2019)\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Coming Home\" (2019)\n\n\"Zimtron\" (2019)\n\n\"Champion Styles\" (2019)\n\n\"Love and Affection\" (2019)\n\n\"War Drums\" (2020)\n\n\"Echoes of You\" (2020)\n\n\"We Roll\" (2020)\n\n\"In This World\" feat.
