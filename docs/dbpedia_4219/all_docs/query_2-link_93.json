        "text": "Second thing I will share from \"Historien om Sverige\" is the importance of educating your users. If you just 3d-scan something and give your client a file, there is a big risk it will never actually get used. There are a ton of ways you can use a scan, but it will only get done if everyone involved knows it is possible. In episode 1 there is a short clip of a stone axe rotating on a turntable. The crew has to go to the museum. Members of staff has to get the item. Light and camera has to be rigged. Then you can shoot it. This exact axe was scanned by me for the museum a year ago. It took me 30 minutes to find the file, import it in #Blender, find the camera angle, animate it and match the lights. Then it rendered in 40 minutes while I sat on the sofa. And no one had to handle the original artifact. PS. They probably filmed a lot of other stuff, that isn't scanned, that same day to save some time."
