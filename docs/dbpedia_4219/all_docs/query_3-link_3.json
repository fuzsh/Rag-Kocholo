        "text": "At first I was very excited to watch this programme. I was born and grew up in Cape Town South Africa and having been living in the UK for 23 years now any connection to my home is a joy.\n\nI am not blind to the history in South Africa or the poverty that affects so many... however I was very disappointed and even quite angry that Ade goes to Johannesburg and then says take me to where the white people live and the programme shows only mansions...\n\nI can tell you that I did not grow up in a mansion and I know for a fact that there are many white families who are very poor, homeless and are struggling to survive just as there are black families.\n\nI also know that there are many very successful and wealthy black people in SA as well as many wealthy white people. However those white people didn't steal anything to become wealthy .. they worked for their wealth as did the black people.\n\nAnother thing that wasn't mentioned was that since the government changed that black people do have an advantage when applying for jobs because the law states that there need to be a % of black people in employment with each company for this reason when a job is advertised it will say affirmative action which means that if a white person more qualified that a black person apply for the same job then the black person will get the job. This is 26 years on from when Mandela came into power and by now you would expect for there to be some sort of equality to remove the racial differences.\n\nI think as a presenter Ade should have been less biased. Yes show the strengths of the black people after what they have been through but show it with factual information and not in a way that eludes to nothing having changed in SA since the government changed.\n\nBecause there have been changes - a big ongoing one is the idea that black people should steal farms back from white people and they do so by going onto people's farms and murdering the whole family and then taking over their farm that they have worked their lives to build up.\n\nI believe that everyone's life is precious regardless of the colour of their skin."
