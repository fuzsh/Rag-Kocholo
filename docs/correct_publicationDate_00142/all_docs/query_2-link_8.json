        "text": "Limited to 1,000 numbered copies. This scarce edition is complete with 174 plates, each with a protective tissue guard. Spines are bright, evidence of not being exposed to the sun. Scattered chipping to the heads of the spines of about half of the volumes, with scattered rubbing to the raised bands. Else a bright and luxurious set.\n\nEdward Bulwer-Lytton was a British Parliamentarian and author. Bulwer-Lytton served non-consecutive periods as a Member of Parliament, but he wrote consistently throughout his life. While Bulwer-Lytton is not widely remembered today, he was a popular author whose novels Godolphin (1822), The Last Days of Pompeii (1834), and Vril (1871), the last of which is an early and pioneering work of science fiction, were widely read. This finely bound set captures the extent of Bulwer-Lytton's writing career. From the Thomas M. Whitehead Collection of Books About Books."
