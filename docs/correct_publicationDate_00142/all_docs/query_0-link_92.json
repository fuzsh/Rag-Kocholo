        "text": "Volume one of a collection of weird tales by a Victorian master of the gothic and occult\n\nIn his time, the aristocratic Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1st Baron Lytton) was one of the most popular and prolific writers in the English language as well as a notable administrator who held the post of secretary of state for the colonies under Derby's government during the Victorian era. Today, few remember his works or indeed how he has left his mark on the language. For example we owe him acknowledgement for the expressions, 'the pen is mightier than the sword,' 'the great unwashed' and for the infamous opening line of his novel, Paul Clifford, 'It was a dark and stormy night.' This last contribution has inspired humorists for decades and even a writing competition. However, it would be unfair to Bulwer-Lytton to consider him solely by these diversions. Here was a well regarded writer of poetry and stage plays, of historical novels, mysteries, romances, science fiction and of excellently crafted tales of the supernatural and the occult-the subject of this special four volume collection from Leonaur. Several of his works were converted into operas and Bulwer-Lytton was also the editor of popular magazines, The New Monthly and The Monthly Chronicle. It is not uncommon for prolific writers to turn their talents to a variety of genres and in any event Bulwer-Lytton belonged to the golden age of gothic and supernatural writing in which there were several highly regarded authors whose contributions remain cherished to this day. In his retrospective view of the very finest writers of ghost stories, the author M. R. James (widely accepted as a master of the genre himself) made special note of Bulwer-Lytton's, 'The Haunters and the Haunted.' However, the author's particular interest in the occult found expression in his writings on the bizarre and many of his most chilling tales have this at their core.\n\nThe first volume of this Leonaur four volume collection includes a novel Asmodeus at Large, a novella 'Falkland,' ten short stories and two ballads of the strange and unusual.\n\nThis substantial collection is available in softcover and hardback with dustjacket for collectors. Leonaur hardbacks feature gold foil lettering on their spines, cloth bindings and fabric head and tail bands."
