        "text": "Bulwer-Lytton was born on 25 May 1803 to General William Earle Bulwer of Heydon Hall and Wood Dalling, Norfolk and Elizabeth Barbara Lytton, daughter of Richard Warburton Lytton of Knebworth, Hertfordshire. He had two elder brothers, William Earle Lytton Bulwer (1799–1877) and Henry (1801–1872), later Lord Dalling and Bulwer.\n\nWhen Edward was four his father died and his mother moved to London. He was a delicate, neurotic child and was discontented at a number of boarding schools. But he was precocious and Mr Wallington at Baling encouraged him to publish, at the age of fifteen, an immature work, Ishmael and Other Poems.\n\nIn 1822 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he met John Auldjo, but shortly afterwards moved to Trinity Hall. In 1825 he won the Chancellor’s Gold Medal for English verse. In the following year he took his B.A. degree and printed, for private circulation, a small volume of poems, Weeds and Wild Flowers.\n\nHe purchased a commission in the army, but sold it without serving.\n\nEdward Bulwer-Lytton. His Harold, the Last of the Saxons (1848) was the source for Verdi’s opera Aroldo\n\nIn August 1827, against his mother’s wishes, he married Rosina Doyle Wheeler (1802–1882), a famous Irish beauty. When they married his mother withdrew his allowance and he was forced to work for a living. They had two children, Lady Emily Elizabeth Bulwer-Lytton (1828–1848), and (Edward) Robert Lytton Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton (1831–1891) who became Governor-General and Viceroy of British India (1876–1880).\n\nHis writing and political work strained their marriage while his infidelity embittered Rosina; in 1833 they separated acrimoniously and in 1836 the separation became legal. Three years later, Rosina published Cheveley, or the Man of Honour (1839), a near-libellous fiction bitterly satirising her husband’s alleged hypocrisy.\n\nIn June 1858, when her husband was standing as parliamentary candidate for Hertfordshire, she indignantly denounced him at the hustings. He retaliated by threatening her publishers, withholding her allowance, and denying access to the children. Finally he had her committed to a mental asylum. But, after a public outcry she was released a few weeks later. This incident was chronicled in her memoir, A Blighted Life (1880). For years she continued her attacks upon her husband’s character.\n\nThe death of Bulwer-Lytton’s mother in 1843 greatly saddened him. His own “exhaustion of toil and study had been completed by great anxiety and grief”, and by “about the January of 1844, I was thoroughly shattered”. In his mother’s room, Bulwer-Lytton “had inscribed above the mantelpiece a request that future generations preserve the room as his beloved mother had used it”; it remains essentially unchanged to this day.\n\nOn 20 February 1844, in accordance with his mother’s will, he changed his surname from ‘Bulwer’ to ‘Bulwer-Lytton’ and assumed the arms of Lytton by royal licence. His widowed mother had done the same in 1811. But, his brothers remained plain ‘Bulwer’.\n\nBy chance he encountered a copy of “Captain Claridge’s work on the “Water Cure”, as practised by Priessnitz, at Graefenberg”, and “making allowances for certain exaggerations therein”, pondered the option of travelling to Graefenberg, but preferred to find something closer to home, with access to his own doctors in case of failure: “I who scarcely lived through a day without leech or potion!”.\n\nAfter reading a pamphlet by Doctor James Wilson, who operated a hydropathic establishment with James Manby Gully at Malvern, he stayed there for “some nine or ten weeks”, after which he “continued the system some seven weeks longer under Doctor Weiss, at Petersham”, then again at “Doctor Schmidt’s magnificent hydropathic establishment at Boppart” (at the former Marienberg Convent at Boppard), after developing a cold and fever upon his return home.\n\nWhen King Otto of Greece abdicated in 1862, he was offered the crown of Greece, which he declined.\n\nIn 1866 Bulwer-Lytton was raised to the peerage as Baron Lytton.\n\nThe English Rosicrucian society, founded in 1867 by Robert Wentworth Little, claimed Bulwer-Lytton as their ‘Grand Patron’, but he wrote to the society complaining that he was ‘extremely surprised’ by their use of the title, as he had ‘never sanctioned such’. Nevertheless, a number of esoteric groups have continued to claim Bulwer-Lytton as their own, chiefly because some of his writings—such as the 1842 book Zanoni—have included Rosicrucian and other esoteric notions. According to the Fulham Football Club, he once resided in the original Craven Cottage, today the site of their stadium.\n\nBulwer-Lytton had long suffered with a disease of the ear and for the last two or three years of his life he lived in Torquay nursing his health. Following an operation to cure deafness, an abscess formed in his ear and burst; he endured intense pain for a week and died at 2am on 18 January 1873 just short of his 70th birthday. The cause of death was not clear but it was thought that the infection had affected his brain and caused a fit. Rosina outlived him by nine years. Against his wishes, Bulwer-Lytton was honoured with a burial in Westminster Abbey.\n\nHis unfinished history Athens: Its Rise and Fall was published posthumously.\n\nBulwer-Lytton’s literary career began in 1820—with the publication of a book of poems—and spanned much of the nineteenth century. He wrote in a variety of genres, including historical fiction, mystery, romance, the occult, and science fiction. He financed his extravagant life with a varied and prolific literary output, sometimes publishing anonymously.\n\n1849 printing of Pelham with Hablot K. Browne (Phiz) frontispiece: Pelham’s electioneering visit to the Revd. Combermere St Quintin, who is surprised at dinner with his family.\n\nIn 1828 Pelham brought him public acclaim and established his reputation as a wit and dandy. The book also made a significant contribution in the changing of men’s fashion. Prior to the novel, evening wear for men could be of any colour, but the upper-class quickly adopted the habit of using black evening wear only, a habit that is still dominant, just as the characters in Pelham. Its intricate plot and humorous, intimate portrayal of pre-Victorian dandyism kept gossips busy trying to associate public figures with characters in the book. Pelham resembled Benjamin Disraeli’s recent first novel Vivian Grey (1827).\n\nBulwer-Lytton admired Benjamin’s father, Isaac D’Israeli, himself a noted author. They began corresponding in the late 1820s and met for the first time in March 1830, when Isaac D’Israeli dined at Bulwer-Lytton’s house. (Also present that evening were Charles Pelham Villiers and Alexander Cockburn. The young Villiers was to have a long parliamentary career, while Cockburn became Lord Chief Justice of England in 1859.)\n\nBulwer-Lytton reached the height of his popularity with the publication of Godolphin (1833). This was followed by The Pilgrims of the Rhine (1834), The Last Days of Pompeii (1834), Rienzi, Last of the Roman Tribunes (1835), and Harold, the Last of the Saxons (1848). The Last Days of Pompeii was inspired by Karl Briullov’s painting, The Last Day of Pompeii, which Bulwer-Lytton saw in Milan.\n\nHe also wrote the horror story “The Haunted and the Haunters” or “The House and the Brain” (1859). Another novel dealing with a supernatural theme was A Strange Story (1862), which was an influence on Bram Stoker’s Dracula.\n\nBulwer-Lyton penned many other works, including The Coming Race or Vril: The Power of the Coming Race (1871), which drew heavily on his interest in the occult and contributed to the birth of the science fiction genre. Its story of a subterranean race waiting to reclaim the surface of the Earth is an early science fiction theme. The book popularised the Hollow Earth theory and may have inspired Nazi mysticism. His term “vril” lent its name to Bovril meat extract. Adopted by theosophists and occultists since the 1870s, “vril” would develop into a major esoteric topic, and eventually become closely associated with the ideas of an esoteric neo-Nazism after 1945.\n\nHis play, Money (1840), was first produced at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, London, on 8 December 1840. The first American production was at the Old Park Theater in New York on 1 February 1841. Subsequent productions include the Prince of Wales’s Theatre’s in 1872 and it was also the inaugural play at the new California Theatre in San Francisco in 1869.\n\nAmong Bulwer-Lytton’s lesser-known contributions to literature is that he convinced Charles Dickens to revise the ending of Great Expectations to make it more palatable to the reading public, as in the original version of the novel, Pip and Estella do not get together."
