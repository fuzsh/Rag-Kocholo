Middletown, CT: Wesleyan UP, 2005.\n\n5 1/2\" x 8 1/2\" 280 pages\n\n$34.95 Cloth, 0-8195-6749-3\n\n“The Coming Race is arguably one of the most important science fiction novels in the English language. Impressive in its breadth, this edition represents a very valuable teaching aid in both undergraduate and graduate courses on fantasy and science fiction.” — Nicholas Ruddick, author of Ultimate Island: On the Nature of British Science Fiction\n\n“The Coming Race is a fascinating novel. Seed's edition of this seminal work is manifestly superior to previous ones and a significant contribution to Lytton studies.”—Toby Widdicombe, University of Alaska, Anchorage"
