        "text": "Edward George Earle Lytton, Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron (1803-1873), British novelist and statesman, was born in London, May 25, 1803. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge. Bulwer-Lytton achieved an extraordinary contemporary reputation as a novelist. Some of his best known novels are 'Eugene Aram', 1832, The Last Days of Pompeii, 1834, Rienzi, 1835, Zanoni, 1842, Harold, 1848, and Kenelm Chiullingly, an autobiographical novel, 1873. Bulwer-Lytton entered politics early in life and became a Member of Parliament in 1831; he was made a baronet in 1838, and was appointed Colonial Secretary in 1858. In 1858, Governor James Douglas named the town of Lytton as a mark of respect for Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton. Sir Edward was the Secretary of State for the colonies and was very interested in the colony of British Columbia. Sir Edward died in Devonshire, Jan. 18, 1873. Some of his historical novels, especially the Last Days of Pompeii, are still widely read."
