        "text": "C.D. Warner, et al., comp.\n\nThe Library of the World’s Best Literature. An Anthology in Thirty Volumes. 1917.\n\nLord Edward Bulwer-Lytton (18031873)\n\nBulwer-Lytton, Edward, Lord Lytton. An English novelist, playwright, and poet, brother of Henry Lytton Earle Bulwer; born in London, May 25, 1803; died in Torquay, Jan. 18, 1873. He was the son of Gen. Earle Bulwer and Elizabeth B. Lytton, heiress of Knebworth, to whose estates he succeeded in 1844 and assumed the surname of Lytton. In 1847 and again in 1852, he sat in Parliament; and in 1858–59 was colonial secretary, during which he called into existence the colonies of British Columbia and Queensland. In 1866 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Lytton. Altogether his works exceed sixty in number, and fill 110 volumes. Among the most famous of his novels are: ‘Falkland’ (1827); ‘Pelham’ (1828); ‘Devereux’ (1829); ‘Paul Clifford’ (1830); ‘Eugene Aram’ (1832); ‘Godolphin’ (1833); ‘Pilgrims of the Rhine’ (1834); ‘Last Days of Pompeii’ (1834); ‘Rienzi’ (1837); ‘Ernest Maltravers’ (1837); ‘Alice, or the Mysteries’ (1838); ‘Last of the Barons’ (1843); ‘Harold’ (1843); ‘The Caxtons’ (1850); ‘My Novel’ (1853); ‘What Will He Do with It?’ (1859); ‘A Strange Story’ (1862); ‘The Coming Race’ (1871); ‘Kenelm Chillingly’ (1873); and ‘The Parisians’ (1873). Three of his dramas—‘The Lady of Lyons’ (1838); ‘Richelieu’ (1838); and ‘Money’ (1848)—still hold the stage. (See Critical and Biographical Introduction)."
