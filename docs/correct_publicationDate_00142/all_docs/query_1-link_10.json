        "text": "October 14, 2010\n\nBeautiful and evocative. Typically Bulwer-Lytton. Made me cry almost from the beginning.\n\nThe unfairness of life is fodder for most novelists, and perhaps no one expresses it more passionately than Edward Bulwer-Lytton. His characters are abruptly thrown into poverty from wealth, and must make their own way in the world. The disparate lives of the rich and poor are highlighted in Victorian Technicolor, and if his stories are sometimes unlikely, his characters are not.\n\nSo, for lack of a scrap of paper, Philip and his brother Sidney, heirs to a large estate, find themselves thrown out on the street. Somehow, against all odds, they must prove their rights...even to bear their father's name.\n\n\"Night and Morning\" is not as wordy as some of his other novels, and completely lacks the out-of-control sentences that occasionally mar \"Paul Clifford.\" Instead of the usual multiple interwoven plots, he sticks to a few and does them nicely.\n\nI read the Project Gutenberg edition, which has the usual scanning errors, but is not bad overall.\n\nSeptember 12, 2017\n\nA guy marries secretly in order not too loose his inheritance. Unfortunately, just when rich uncle finally dies he himself falls off his horse. Everything goes to his brother Robert. Robert chooses not to believe in the marriage. Widow, Catherine goes to court but nothing can be proved. Vicar dead, first witness dead, second vanished, register destroyed copy of register vanished. Now, the two rightful heirs have nothing. But the younger, Sydney is sent to an uncle, the older, Philip, starts apprenticeship. So far, so good. But, Sydney is unhappy and then Mother dies. Philip escapes with little brother, but not for long. For some reason Robert and his son, Arthur want to save Sydney, Philip due to some displayed arrogance is considered bad. But there is also some guy Spencer, also an uncle, I believe, who gets hands on the fellow. And, unthankful, he writes to his brother that he prefers a life with a pony to brotherly love. No wonder Philip goes out into the world with some doubtful friends. One, Gawtry, is a coiner, but at heart a good fellow. It gets more and more complicated from here on. And for a while I was lost, but BL got me again. In the end, Philip, returning as some mysterious French guy with some nice love affair that is mentioned in passing, gets his honored name back. Before that he suffers another loss. He falls in love with his cousin, the daughter of his enemy. He is allowed to get her hand, the only way for Robert to clinch to the fortune, but then it appears she is really in love with Sydney. Isn’t this exciting?\n\nThis is all to the good, so he can marry his true love, Fanny in the end.\n\nNow, Fanny is the best character, she is depicted as an idiot. Talking of herself as Fanny, but the love for Philip somehow improves her. Sounds crude, but BL really manages to make it convincing. Then we have the real villain, Lord Lilburne, amazingly good. He is Granddad of Fanny.\n\nAbsolutely marvelous.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers."
