        "text": "Vril, the Power of the Coming Race is an 1871 novel by Edward Bulwer-Lytton. Its readers have been those who believed that its account of a subterranean master race and the energy-form called \"Vril\" was real, to the degree that theosophists, including Helena Blavatsky, William Scott-Elliot, and Rudolf Steiner, accepted the book as being somewhat based on occult truth. A book, The Morning of the Magicians (1960), suggested that a secret Vril Society existed in pre-Nazi Berlin. Despite no solid evidence that the society existed.\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nEdward George Earle Lytton Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton PC (1803–1873), was an English novelist, poet, playwright, and politician. He was immensely popular with the reading public and wrote a stream of bestselling novels which earned him a considerable fortune. He coined the phrases \"the great unwashed\", \"pursuit of the almighty dollar\", \"the pen is mightier than the sword\", \"dweller on the threshold\", as well as the well-known opening line \"It was a dark and stormy night\".\n\n\"About this title\" may belong to another edition of this title."
