It owes much of its character to Edward Bulwer Lytton, first Baron Lytton (1803-1873), a politician, socialite, scholar, diplomat and novelist. The third youngest son of William Earle Bulwer of Heydon Hall, Norfolk and Elizabeth Barbara, daughter of Richard Warbuton Lytton of Knebworth, Bulwer financed his extravagant life as a man of fashion and a politician by a versatile and prolific literary output. After he inherited Knebworth in 1843, Bulwer Lytton transformed the Tudor manor house into a palace with battlements, turrets, domes and gargoyles. The house became his refuge where he could read, write and entertain. In 1838 Bulwer Lytton, who was friends with Dickens and Disraeli, received a baronetcy for his services to literature and was created Baron Lytton of Knebworth in 1866.\n\nBULWER LYTTON, Edward George Earle Lytton, first Baron Lytton (1803-1873).
