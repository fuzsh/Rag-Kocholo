        "text": "Earlier this month, I spent a week at Dickens camp, at the University of California in Santa Cruz, reading “Great Expectations,” with two hundred and sixty Dickens fans and Dickens scholars. I write about that in this week’s issue of the magazine. About the only thing a lot of people who read “Great Expectations” in high school remember about it is that Dickens was persuaded to rewrite the ending—thereby, nearly ruining the book—on the advice of a man named Edward Bulwer Lytton.\n\nDickens and Bulwer were friends—Dickens named one of his sons Edward Bulwer Lytton Dickens—and Dickens was Bulwer’s editor, and, although no one reads Bulwer any more, he was, in the nineteenth century, one of only a few English novelists to rival Dickens in sales. Bulwer’s been out of fashion since about the First World War and, lately, he’s so far out that, since 1982, the English Department at San Jose State has been holding an annual Edward Bulwer Lytton Fiction Contest, for the most dreadful first line of a novel, inspired by the sentence with which Bulwer began “Paul Clifford”:\n\nIt was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents—except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.\n\nIn 2003, that contest inspired Mikhail Simkin, an electrical engineer at U.C.L.A., to post a quiz on a Web site called “Dickens or Bulwer?” Its (wobbly) premise is, if Dickens is the best writer ever, and Bulwer the worst, shouldn’t you be able to tell which of them wrote, for instance, this?\n\nIt was a rimy morning, and very damp. I had seen the damp lying on the outside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying there all night, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief. Now, I saw the damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sort of spiders’ webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade. On every rail and gate, wet lay clammy; and the marsh-mist was so thick, that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our village—a direction which they never accepted, for they never came there—was invisible to me until I was quite close under it.\n\nSimkin analyzed the results of about ten thousand quiz-takers and found that their average score was 48.2% correct—a coin toss. (“A rimy morning and very damp” is from “Great Expectations.”) When he re-ran his analysis, using only answers given by people whose I.P. addresses located them at Ivy League or Oxbridge universities, he got the same result. Looking at a single passage is no way to judge a novel, of course, but Simkin’s quiz is probably measuring something: people who take the quiz aren’t trying to decide which passage is Dickensian, and which Bulwerian: they’re trying to decide which is better, and they can’t. Or is something else going on? You can take the quiz here.\n\nI’m still not sure what to make of this but, plainly, I must have been making a nuisance of myself by muttering about it at home, because, one night after I got back from camp, I and some kids I know pretty well were sitting around the television watching the Red Sox when the oldest asked, “Who’s that on the mound for the Twins?” and the next younger said, “That would be Edward Bulwer Lytton,” and the littlest said, “Yeah. He stinks.”"
