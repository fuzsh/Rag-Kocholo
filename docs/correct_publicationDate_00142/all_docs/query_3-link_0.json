        "text": "Edward George Earle Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton (born May 25, 1803, London, England—died January 18, 1873, Torquay, Devonshire) was a British politician, poet, and critic, chiefly remembered, however, as a prolific novelist. His books, though dated, remain immensely readable, and his experiences lend his work an unusual historical interest.\n\nBulwer-Lytton was the youngest son of General William Bulwer and Elizabeth Lytton. After leaving the University of Cambridge, he visited Paris and Versailles. Back in England, he met Rosina Doyle Wheeler, an Irish woman, whom he married in 1827. He published an unsuccessful novel during the same year, but Pelham (1828), the adventures of a dandy, inaugurated his career as a fluent, popular novelist. The couple’s extravagant style of living necessitated a large output of work, and the strain made Bulwer-Lytton an irritable and negligent husband. After many violent quarrels, he and Rosina were legally separated in 1836. Bulwer-Lytton’s political career began in 1831, when he entered Parliament as Liberal member for Lincoln. In 1841 he retired in protest against repeal of the Corn Laws. This, together with his friendship with Benjamin Disraeli, converted him into a Tory, and in 1852 he returned to the House as member for Hertfordshire.\n\nBulwer-Lytton’s literary activity had, meanwhile, been immense. His popularity was largely a result of his skill in anticipating and satisfying changes in public taste. He flirted quite successfully with the theatre, though his plays have not endured. Having started as a novelist with Pelham, which combined Gothic romance with a setting of the fashionable world, he then embarked on a series of historical novels, weighted with meticulous detail, the most notable of which were The Last Days of Pompeii, 3 vol. (1834), and Harold, the Last of the Saxon Kings (1848). In Eugene Aram, 3 vol. (1832), he made use of current fascination with criminals and the underworld. He turned to realism and the portrayal of English society in The Caxtons, 3 vol. (1849), and My Novel (1853). Bulwer-Lytton also published several volumes of poetry, a satirical novel in verse (containing an attack on Alfred, Lord Tennyson, the poet laureate), and an unsuccessful long epic, King Arthur (1848). He was created a peer in 1866."
