        "text": "“It was a dark and stormy night” never struck me as such a terrible sentence. Nothing divinely inspired, certainly, but informative as to the weather, and certainly not deserving to be immortalized as a specimen of lousy writing. The author of this volume certainly feels that way, finding his subject underappreciated, misunderstood, and unfairly tarred by having a contest for bad fiction named for him. Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1803-1873) wrote many novels dealing with crime, notably his first, Pelham (1828), and the two “Newgate novels,” Paul Clifford (1830), whence came that notorious weather report, concerning “a possible prototype of E.W. Hornung’s gentleman thief Raffles”; and Eugene Aram (1832), which “anticipated Alfred Hitchcock’s film adaptation of Robert Bloch’s Psycho in 1960.” He was also a student of the occult, in which area he may have influenced prolific 20th-century thriller writer Dennis Wheatley. The difference between them: in A Strange Story (1862), Bulwer-Lytton’s “real point was to discuss the nature of the soul and its relation to mortality. Wheatley never professed to be writing more than a good story, but the occult element that made Wheatley so popular was exactly what caused Bulwer- Lytton’s critics to censure him.”\n\nThe many references to those who may have influenced or been influenced by Bulwer-Lytton shows author Huckvale’s wide knowledge of English literature as well as contemporary popular culture. Among the names mentioned: Poe, Dickens, Shaw, Haggard, Rohmer, Doyle, and Wilde. This is a very readable and enjoyable exploration of a unique literary figure’s life and work."
