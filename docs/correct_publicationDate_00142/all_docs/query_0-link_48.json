He served as a Whig MP from 1831 to 1841 and a Conservative MP from 1851 to 1866. He was Secretary of State for the Colonies from June 1858 to June 1859, during which time he selected Richard Clement Moody to be the founder of British Columbia. Bulwer-Lytton was offered the Crown of Greece in 1862, after the abdication of King Otto, but declined it. He became Baron Lytton of Knebworth in the British peerage in 1862. On 20 February 1844, in accordance with his mother's will, he changed his surname from 'Bulwer' to 'Bulwer-Lytton' and assumed the arms of Lytton by royal licence. His widowed mother had done the same in 1811. His brothers remained plain \"Bulwer\". [4]\n\nNotable Works\n\nAmong his notable works are various novels:\n\nThe Last Days of Pompei, 1834, inspired by a painting he saw in Milan\n\nRienzi, the last of the Roman Tribunes, 1835. Composer Richard Wagner based his opera Rienzi, der Letzte der Tribunen upon this novel. The opera premiered in 1843 and was almost a bigger success than the novel itself.\n\nHarold, the last of the Saxons, 1848, another work that inspired an opera. This time Guiseppe Verdi was inspired by the work and based his opera Aroldo on the novel.\n\nVril, the Power of the Coming Race, 1871, an early science fiction novel about a subterranean race waiting to reclaim the surface of the earth\n\nSources\n\n↑ Baptism: \"England Births and Christenings, 1538-1975\"\n\nFamilySearch Record: JWZ5-3LZ (accessed 2 January 2023)\n\nEdward George Earl Lytton baptism on 15 Mar 1810 (born 25 May 1803), son of William Earl Bulwer Lytton & Elizabeth, in Marylebone, London, England, United Kingdom.\n\n↑ Marriage: \"England Marriages, 1538–1973\"\n\nFamilySearch Record: NKN6-74D (accessed 2 January 2023)\n\nEdward George Lytton Bulwer marriage to Anna Rosina Wheeler on 29 Aug 1827 in Westminster, London, England, United Kingdom.\n\n↑ Death Registration: \"England & Wales General Register Office\"\n\nGRO Online Indexes - Death (accessed 2 January 2023)\n\nLytton, Edward George Caile Lytton (Age at death: 67).\n\nGRO Reference: 1873 Jan-Feb-Mar in Newton Abbot Volume 05B Page 127.\n\n↑ [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bulwer-Lytton Wikipedia: Edward Bulwer-Lytton\n\nEdward Bulwer-Lytton, The Last Days of Pompeii, 1834, p 2.\n\nSee Also:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bulwer-Lytton\n\nAndrew Brown, ‘Lytton, Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer , first Baron Lytton (1803–1873)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 28 Aug 2016\n\n\"British Newspaper Archive, Family Notices,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QPCV-XCQC : 17 April 2019), Edward Lytton Bulwer, Esq, Norwich, Norfolk, England, United Kingdom; records extracted FamilySearch and images digitized by FindMyPast; citing Norwich, Norfolk, England, United Kingdom, 1 Sep 1827, The British Newspaper Archive, Ireland; FHL microfilm .\n\n\"England Births and Christenings, 1538-1975\", database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:J77R-RQ8 : 19 March 2020), Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer in entry for Emily Elizabeth Bulwer, 1828.\n\n\"England Births and Christenings, 1538-1975\", database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:JWZ5-3LZ : 19 September 2020), Edward George Earl Lytton, 1810.\n\n\"England Marriages, 1538–1973 \", database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:NKN6-74D : 13 March 2020), Edward George Lytton Bulwer, 1827.\n\n\"British Newspaper Archive, Family Notices,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QPZQ-VLM6 : 17 April 2019), Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer-Lytton, Lord, Exeter, Devon, England, United Kingdom; records extracted FamilySearch and images digitized by FindMyPast; citing Exeter, Devon, England, United Kingdom, 21 Jan 1873, The British Newspaper Archive, Ireland; FHL microfilm .\n\n\"England and Wales, National Index of Wills and Administrations, 1858-1957,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QPJS-TQ3P : 30 August 2018), Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer, Sep 1874; citing Probate, England, United Kingdom, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, Great Britain.; FHL microfilm .\n\nThe Spectator: Review of Rienzi: The Spectator, (1835).
