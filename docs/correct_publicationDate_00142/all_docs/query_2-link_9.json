        "text": "(1803–73). The 19th-century British novelist Edward Bulwer-Lytton was one of the most prolific and popular fiction writers of his era. He was also a poet, playwright, critic, and political leader.\n\nBulwer-Lytton was born on May 25, 1803, in London, England. After leaving the University of Cambridge, he visited Paris and Versailles in France. Back in England, he met Rosina Doyle Wheeler, an Irish woman, whom he married in 1827. His political career began in 1831, when he entered Parliament as a Liberal. In 1841 he retired in protest against the repeal of the Corn Laws, which restricted the import and export of grain. This, together with his friendship with Benjamin Disraeli, converted him into a Tory, and in 1852 he returned to the House as a Tory member.\n\nBulwer-Lytton’s literary activity had, meanwhile, been immense. A successful early novel, Pelham (1828), combined Gothic romance with a setting of the fashionable world. He then embarked on a series of historical novels, weighted with meticulous detail, the most notable of which were The Last Days of Pompeii, 3 vol., (1834), and Harold, the Last of the Saxon Kings (1848). He realistically portrayed English society in The Caxtons, 3 vol. (1849), and My Novel (1853). Bulwer-Lytton also published several volumes of poetry, a satirical novel in verse (containing an attack on Alfred, Lord Tennyson, the poet laureate), and an unsuccessful long epic, King Arthur (1848).\n\nBulwer-Lytton was created a peer in 1866. He died on January 18, 1873, in Torquay, Devonshire, England."
