        "text": "Edward George Bulwer-Lytton , who began his prolific career as Edward Bulwer, wrote many kinds of novelsâ€”from the silver-fork genre (whose name derived from a derisive reference to Bulwer himself as a silver fork polisher\n\nMitchell, Sally, editor. Victorian Britain: An Encyclopedia. Garland Press.\n\n103\n\nin Fraser's Magazine ) and domestic fiction to crime or Newgate novels (the forerunner of sensation fiction), science fiction, and occult stories. He also wrote three plays, several books of poetry, and an Arthurian epic, as well as editing The New Monthly Magazine from 1831 to 1833.\n\nMitchell, Sally, editor.
