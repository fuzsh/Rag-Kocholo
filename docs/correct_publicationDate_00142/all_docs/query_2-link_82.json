First Edition. 8vo, as issued in the printer's original state in drab paper boards,with paper lettering labels on the spines. xvi, 315; 296; 315 pp. A very handsome set, a bit age mellowed, internally sound, some expected light wear to the hinges and some rubbing to the labels. FIRST EDITION, RARE IN ORIGINAL BOARDS. The first edition of a classic of historical fiction. Bulwer's most celebrated work was inspired by his visit to the studio of the Russian painter Karl Bryullov at Rome, where an enormous canvas representing the catastrophe was hung. This is now in the Hermitage, covering much of the wall. \"The Last Days of Pompeii is one of the best-documented examples of a novel in the boards and label period for which the earliest bindings were supplied by wholesalers, and not by the publisher. It was a practice at this time, just before publication, to offer trade subscribers a small extra discount on copies in quires. The \"Bentley Private List\" (1834, back wrapper) gives details for \"The Last Days of Pompeii\". At the trade subscription on September 24, 1834, five days before publication, the book in quires was offered at 21s. 3d., with the added incentive of 25 copies for the price of 24. 'The total subscription was 729.copies, and every single one of those copies was to be supplied in quires. Consequently, on publication day not a single copy in the publisher's binding crossed a bookshop or library counter; and Bentley-bound copies would only have been issued to supply later orders.' (Carter, \"Binding Variants\", pp. 33-35). Longmans were the single largest subscriber, taking 200 copies (for the price of 192), amounting to 27% of the total subscription. These copies would have been boarded for publication by Longmans, hence the Longmans' catalogue here. Of the six possible binding variants listed by Carter in \"Binding Variants\" and \"More Binding Variants\", this is 'A'.

A fourteen volume uniformly bound set of the works of 'Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton', each with illustrated frontispieces. Fourteen volumes. Edward George Earl Bulwer-Lytton was an English novelist, playwright, and politician. One of the greatest novelists of his day, Bulwer-Lytton\"s literary career began in 1820, with the publication of his first book of poems, and continued throughout the nineteenth century. He wrote in a variety of genres, including historical fiction, mystery, romance, the occult and science fiction, offering a fascinating insight into the Victorian era. In 1828 he attracted general attention with Pelham, an intimate study of the dandyism of the age that kept gossips busy in identifying the characters with the leading men of the time. By 1833, he had reached the height of his popularity with Godolphin, followed by The Pilgrims of the Rhine (1834), The Last Days of Pompeii (1834), Rienzi (1835), and Harold: Last of the Saxon Kings (1848). The Last Days of Pompeii was inspired by the painting on the same subject by Russian painting Karl Briullov (Carlo Brullo) which Bulwer-Lytton saw in Milan. Pelham had been partly inspired by Benjamin Disraeli\"s first novel Vivian Grey. Bulwer-Lytton was an admirer of Benjamin\"s father Isaac D\"Israeli, himself a noted literary figure, and had corresponded with him. Bulwer-Lytton and Disraeli began corresponding themselves in the late 1820s, and met for the first time in March of 1830, when Disraeli dined at Bulwer-Lytton\"s house. Also present that evening were Charles Pelham Villiers and Alexander Cockburn. Although young at the time, Villiers went on to an exceptionally long parliamentary career, while Cockburn became Lord Chief Justice of England in 1859. In half calf bindings with marbles boards. Externally sound. There is some wear to the extremities and the spine label on Zanoni is becoming loose. There is an ink signature on a front end paper in most of the volumes.

Note: Bulwer-Lytton's story of fictional events in Pompeii in the days leading up to the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which destroyed the city. About the author: Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1803-1873), or, to give him his full name, Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton (which should be enough Lyttons for anyone). For a short while during the 1820s and 1830s, he was the most popular novelist in Britain, until he was eclipsed by an even more popular and successful man, Charles Dickens. His popularity waned quickly, even during his own lifetime, and his reputation has never been restored. And yet, although his novels are not read much nowadays, there are still reasons to celebrate this writer. Here are our five favourite reasons. 1. He changed the way men dressed and still influences the way they dress today. In his first successful novel Pelham (1828), published when Lytton was only in his mid-twenties (he had already published several novels prior to this), Lytton set the trend for men's evening dress. Prior to Lytton's novel, the colour of smart evening wear for men could be any colour; Lytton changed that. In this, a 'silver fork' novel about upper-class fashionable society, the men wear black evening wear, and when the novel was a runaway success this fashion was adopted by the real gentry. It has been with us ever since. 2. He coined the phrase 'the pen is mightier than the sword'. This first appeared in his 1839 play Richelieu. The saying has since achieved the status of general proverb, but it had a definite origin and a definite author, and it's Bulwer-Lytton we have to thank for it. Although Bulwer-Lytton provides the true origin of the phrase 'the pen is mightier than the sword', the sentiment it expresses had been around for some time before. 3. He wrote an early work of science fiction. While Jules Verne was writing his groundbreaking works of what became known as science fiction, Bulwer-Lytton was helping to lay the groundwork for the English tradition in his 1871 novel The Coming Race. In this novel, the narrator accidentally finds himself in a subterranean utopian world populated by a telepathic people known as the Vril-ya. They power themselves with the help of a life-giving fluid known as Vril, whose properties are many and diverse, ranging from healing to killing. Some people, including the Theosophists, even thought that Vril actually existed. The power of fiction 4. He helped to inspire the name for Bovril. This is thanks to The Coming Race in which that mysterious substance with life-giving properties, which Lytton names Vril, is at the heart of the power of the Vril-ya. When the makers of Bovril, the beef extract, were casting around for a name for their new product, they formed their brand name by blending 'bovine' with 'Vril', suggesting that this beefy drink had life-giving properties similar to those provided by Lytton's fictional elixir. 5. He was the first person to use the most famous (infamous?) opening line in all of fiction. That is, he opened his 1830 novel Paul Clifford with the words, 'It was a dark and stormy night' Elmore Leonard once advised writers, 'Never open a book with weather', but Lytton didn't shy away from using such a device, and this opening line may serve to explain why he is not widely read any more, with his novels decried as poorly written. However, this line has inspired an unusual legacy, in the shape of the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, an annual competition sponsored by San Jose State University in California. The aim of the contest is to find a deliberately bad opening line for a new novel. Past winners have included this gem from Sue Fondrie, in 2011: 'Cheryl's mind turned like the vanes of a wind-powered turbine, chopping her sparrow-like thoughts into bloody pieces that fell onto a growing pile of forgotten memories.' As this contest shows, Bulwer-Lytton has not been completely forgotten; but quite what he'd make of his legacy, we cannot say. And we haven't even mentioned that he was offered the throne of Greece in 1862 (he declined, in case you were wondering).\n\nHardcover. Condition: Very Good+. Dust Jacket Condition: Very Good.

In it he tries to show the meeting of cultures, the decadence of Rome, corruption of ancient Eastern religions, and the latest cultural trends. It ends with an escape from Pompeii amid the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE, and the characters' eventual conversion to Christianity. This classic story has been adapted for film, theater and television. ** Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer-Lytton (1803-1873) was an English writer and politician of note. His writing was prolific, and he published a wide range of material including historical fiction, mystery, romance, the occult and science fiction. His works sold well and helped finance his extravagant lifestyle. His legacy exists in English \"turns of phrase\" that made a lasting impact on our culture, having coined the following: \"the pen is mightier than the sword\"; \"pursuit of the almighty dollar\"; \"the great unwashed\"; and \"dweller on the threshold.\" He also penned the \"seminal archetypal example of florid, melodramatic fiction writing\" with the opening phrase to his book Paul Clifford: \"It was a dark and stormy night\" (perhaps best known for it's use by Snoopy in the Peanuts comic). ** 513 pages. 7.5 x 11.5 inches. ** ** Postage for oversized and international shipping will be calculated by size and weight.
