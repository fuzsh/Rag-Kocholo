Couched in an elevated literary tone, packed with paranormal happenings, and laced with allusions to facets of the esoteric path well-known to AMORC members, Zanoni rates as high-quality literary entertainment for the esoterically inclined. However, twenty-first century Rosicrucians reading Zanoni for the first time are often bewildered by the stilted authorial tone and unexpected literary features of this nineteenth century novel, a fiction classic beloved by generations of AMORC readers for its colorful portrayal of issues and techniques intimately connected to the Rosicrucian path. This paper renders Zanoni more readily understandable for today's readers by situating it within its historical and literary context in the field of literary genre study. It evaluates three genre categories into which the novel Zanoni might fit. Considering theme, setting, plot, character, dialogue, and narrative voice, the paper demonstrates that this novel employs and embodies the features of three distinct genres: Goth, Silver Fork, and Occult Fiction. Further, the paper reveals how the use of literary conventions drawn from each of these genres provides an opportunity for Bulwer-Lytton to showcase philosophical and spiritual principles advocated by the Rosicrucian Order both in his day and in ours. In sum, this paper provides a comfortable and informed platform from which the reader can enter and enjoy Zanoni. « Zanoni » de Bulwer-Lytton : Une aventure victorienne à l'intérieur de la conscience Par Maureen Richmond, M.A. Résumé Le roman de Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Zanoni (1842) intègre et illustre au moins trois genres importants dans le monde littéraire victorien : 1) le Ghost ou Goth, 2) le genre « à la mode », sentimental, aussi appelé « silver fork » dépeignant les hautes classes de la société, et 3) le roman occultiste. Les caractéristiques de ces genres se marient avec l'intérêt inné de l'auteur pour la métaphysique, l'occultisme, le classicisme, l'idéalisme et la philosophie spirituelle, en un résultat intellectuellement riche qui aborde des questions existentielles, connues depuis toujours, mais qui étaient tout particulièrement à l'étude dans l'Angleterre victorienne. Le message primordial de ce roman est : tandis que la communion avec les mondes spirituels plus élevés ennoblit la conscience humaine, l'effort de se détacher complètement des préoccupations terrestres semble aller à l'encontre la vraie nature de l'homme. L'auteur gère l'intrigue de manière à affirmer la\n\nCe projet de thèse, choisi en vue de l'obtention du doctorat des littératures française, francophones et comparée, consiste en une démarche littéraire comparatiste, axée sur dix romans rattachés, en théorie, au genre historique, et... more\n\nCe projet de thèse, choisi en vue de l'obtention du doctorat des littératures française, francophones et comparée, consiste en une démarche littéraire comparatiste, axée sur dix romans rattachés, en théorie, au genre historique, et traitant tous de l'Antiquité. Le corpus des œuvres, établi sur une période recouvrant les XIXe et XXe siècles, comprend quatre romans français : Les Martyrs de Chateaubriand (1809), Le Roman de la momie de Théophile Gautier (1858), Salammbô de Gustave Flaubert (1862), Mémoires d'Hadrien de Marguerite Yourcenar (1951) ; et six romans étrangers : The Last Days of Pompeii d'Edward G. Bulwer-Lytton (1834), Quo vadis ? de Henryk Sienkiewicz (1895), Siddhartha. Eine Indische Dichtung de Hermann Hesse (1922), Der Tod des Vergil de Hermann Broch (1945), Aztec de Gary Jennings (1980) et Creation de Gore Vidal (1981). Cet échantillonnage représentatif du genre archéo-fictif tient compte principalement de la notoriété des romans historiques, de leur diversité géographique et culturelle, et de leur adhérence au sujet de thèse. En effet, chaque roman s'apparente à une tentative remarquable de reconstitution \" archéologico-littéraire \" d'une civilisation antique anéantie par l'érosion du temps : l'Egypte ancienne, Carthage, Rome, Pompéi, la Grèce, la Perse, l'Inde, le Cathay (la Chine antique) et l'empire aztèque. \" Les destinées et les croyances religieuses \" constituent le sujet unificateur qui relie ces romans à leur contexte littéraire. Le problème générique du roman historique ; le substrat religieux dans l'anastylose archéofictive ; la transfiguration religieuse des lieux et du langage dessinent les principales orientations littéraires de la thèse.\n\nThis Ph.D thesis, chosen for the doctoral degree of French, French-speaking and comparative literatures, consists in a comparative literary approach, axed on ten historical novels, theoretically attached to the historical genre, and dealing all with antiquity. The corpus of works, established on a period covering the 19th and the 20th centuries, includes four French novels: Les Martyrs by François-René de Chateaubriand (1809), Le Roman de la momie by Théophile Gautier (1858), Salammbô by Gustave Flaubert (1862), Mémoires d'Hadrien by Marguerite Yourcenar (1951); and six foreign novels: The Last Days of Pompeii by Edward G. Bulwer-Lytton (1834), Quo vadis ? by Henryk Sienkiewicz (1895), Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse (1922), Der Tod des Vergil by Hermann Broch (1945), Aztec by Gary Jennings (1980) and Creation by Gore Vidal (1981). This representative selection of samples from the archaeo-fictive genre takes mainly into account the notoriety of the historical novels, their geographical and cultural diversity, and their adhesion to the subject of the thesis. Indeed, each novel is akin to a remarkable \" archaeologico-literary \" recovery's attempt of an ancient civilization annihilated by the erosion of time: the Ancient Egypt, Carthage, Rome, Pompeii, Greece, Persia, India, Cathay (Ancient China) and the Aztec empire. The generic problem of the historical novel; the religious substratum in the archaeofictive anastylosis; the transfiguration of the landscape and the language draw the main literary and thematic lines of the thesis.\n\nH.G.

Wells is sometimes credited with a stylistic rupture that separated science fiction from other fantastic genres, eschewing magical elements in favour of empiricist and rationalist knowledge. While there is merit to this narrative, this article argues for a more complex genre heritage by evaluating the fiction of Edward Bulwer-Lytton as an indicative example of a competing nineteenth-century strand of occult science fiction. This form, quite popular in the period, drew on methods of scientific legitimation used by esoteric traditions like Theosophy and Spiritualism, as well as theories of the mind such as clairvoyance and telepathy, producing fiction that dialogued with scientific currents of the day but without a rejection of magic. Indeed, noting that Wells consciously exploited the narrative value of esoteric science in a number of his early short stories, the article argues that the fiction of authors like Bulwer-Lytton is distinguished from the form championed by Wells not by an exorcism of magic but by a productive occlusion of it. The article concludes by outlining the methods and continuing influence of this occlusion, arguing that esoteric sciences have continued to influence and generate the tropes, novums, and stylistics of science fiction.\n\nThe course focuses on different aspects of the historical evolution of western esotericism in the modern period, from the eighteenth century up to the present days.

The aim is to follow both the internal development, understood from the specific perspective of the field, and the broader cultural context in which western esotericism has taken shape, in order to understand both the inside logics of esotericism and its responses to external social pressure. Every year a different theme is chosen that offers a unique entry point in this historical development. For this year, the subject will be modern western esotericism and politics. Esotericism has been often identified with right-wing or reactionary politics. Authors such as Theodor Adorno and Umberto Eco have argued that there is an essential link between esotericism and political movements of the 20 th century such as nazism and fascism. Esotericism is therefore supposed to be reactionary by nature. Is this idea tenable, or does it call for a more complex picture? Starting in the 1960s authors such as Frances Yates have argued that esoteric ideas may have played a role in the origins and the development of modern science. The connection between freemasonry and Enlightenment ideas in the 18th century, on the other hand, has been emphasized by a number of authors. During the 19 th century, movements such as spiritualism and occultism were more often identified with liberal, progressive, and generally left-wing ideas, than with conservatism. Finally, even in the 20 th century, it is not hard to find movements and authors associating esoteric concepts and practices with political ideas that are at the antipodes of the organicist, totalitarian vision of nazi-fascism. Indeed, as this course shall show, a number of highly influential esoteric movements are linked directly to the anarchist tradition. Finally, we shall investigate a number of esoteric currents that allege to represent a post-political form of politics. The course will focus on these problematic issues, and will try to highlight their complexity through the use of both primary sources and secondary literature.\n\nDuring the mid- to late nineteenth century, Japan’s linguistic situation was quite complicated.

There were multiple writing styles and literary authors would select from them based on genre and subject matter. Among the “high” literary styles used by educated people was one called kanbun yomikudashibun-chō, a style that had developed in imitation of the Japanese adaptations of Classical Chinese texts. This chapter examines the stylistic choices faced by translators as they completed some of the first important literary translations from European languages in the midst of this complicated linguistic system. As case studies, this chapter examines two famous translations dating from 1878: the translation of Jules Verne (1828–1905) by Kawashima Chūnosuke (1853–1938) and the translation of Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1803–1873) by Niwa Jun’ichirō (1851–1919). Although both were published in the same year, they reveal radically different translation strategies and a profoundly different attitude toward the use of language.\n\nThe Bengali novelist Trailokyanath Mukhopadhyay is remembered in our times as a writer of fantastic tales.

This article studies his presentation of ghosts and the supernatural, which frequently appear in his stories. It is commonly assumed that his writings contain a polemic against the belief in ghosts. Scholars feel that as a didactic writer he attacked all superstitious beliefs of his countrymen, including the belief in the supernatural. This article contests this somewhat oversimplified view. To do so, it minutely considers biographical evidences. It also studies in details some of his more conventional ghost stories. Particular attention is paid to his adaptation of Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton’s “The Haunted and the Haunters”. By comparing these two stories, it is shown how Trailokyanath’s version deviates from the original to provide a more conventional explanation of the haunting. He thereby converts Lytton’s more unconventional rendering of the occult to a typical ghost story. Thus the author therefore did not write ghost stories simply to scoff at the belief in the supernatural. Based on these evidences, it is argued that Trailokyanath’s thinking was never unidirectional as the scholars assume. It is necessary to recognize the contradictions inherent in his thinking to arrive at an objective evaluation of his works.\n\nDemonstrating that nineteenth-century historical novelists played their rational, trustworthy narrators against shifting and untrustworthy depictions of space and place, Tom Bragg argues that the result was a flexible form of fiction that... more\n\nDemonstrating that nineteenth-century historical novelists played their rational, trustworthy narrators against shifting and untrustworthy depictions of space and place, Tom Bragg argues that the result was a flexible form of fiction that could be modified to reflect both the different historical visions of the authors and the changing aesthetic tastes of the reader. Bragg focuses on Scott, William Harrison Ainsworth, and Edward Bulwer Lytton, identifying links between spatial representation and the historical novel's multi-generic rendering of history and narrative. Even though their understanding of history and historical process could not be more different, all writers employed space and place to mirror narrative, stimulate discussion, interrogate historical inquiry, or otherwise comment beyond the rational, factual narrator's point of view. Bragg also traces how landscape depictions in all three authors' works inculcated heroic masculine values to show how a dominating theme of the genre endures even through widely differing versions of the form. In taking historical novels beyond the localized questions of political and regional context, Bragg reveals the genre's relevance to general discussions about the novel and its development. Nineteenth-century readers of the novel understood historical fiction to be epic and serious, moral and healthful, patriotic but also universal. Space and Narrative in the Nineteenth-Century British Historical Novel takes this readership at its word and acknowledges the complexity and diversity of the form by examining one of its few continuous features: a flexibly metaphorical valuation of space and place.\n\nMelodramatic representations of disability pervaded not only novels by Dickens, but also doctors' treatises on blindness, educators' arguments for \"special\" education, and even the writing of disabled people themselves.

Drawing on extensive primary research, Martha Stoddard Holmes introduces readers to popular literary and dramatic works that explored culturally risky questions like \"can disabled men work?\" and \"should disabled women have babies?\" and makes connections between literary plots and medical, social, and educational debates of the day. The first book of its kind, Fictions of Affliction contributes a new emphasis to Victorian literary and cultural studies and offers new readings of works by canonic and becoming-canonic writers like Dickens, Wilkie Collins, and others.\n\nWritten for Wordsworth Editions on Dickens’ Birthday.

And exploration of the evolution of the Newgate novel or 'criminal romance' and the attendant moral panic from Bulwer-Lytton's Paul Clifford and Eugene Aram to Rookwood and Jack Sheppard by WH Ainsworth and Dickens' Oliver Twist:\n\nWhen considering an author as culturally monolithic as Charles Dickens, it’s easy to forget that he wasn’t born the national author, anymore than Shakespeare was. As a young journalist in the early-1830s, although already possessed of considerable talent and ambition, he was just another freelance writer in the Darwinian world of London publishing. As a court reporter, Dickens covered debates in the Commons as well as following election campaigns around the country and reporting on them for the Morning Chronicle. These travels became the bases for a series of ‘sketches’ of everyday life in several periodicals, written under the pseudonym ‘Boz’. And the rest is history, as they say. John Macrone published Sketches by ‘Boz’ to considerable popular and critical acclaim in 1836, Chapman and Hall offered Dickens the humorous sporting serial that became The Pickwick Papers, another hit; he assumed the editorship of Bentley’s Miscellany and began serialising Oliver Twist, arguably one of the most iconic English novels of the 19th century, multiply adapted for stage and screen. In short, Dickens’ rise was meteoric. Or was it?\n\nBy the mid-1830s, Dickens’ star was undoubtedly in ascendance, but since the death of Sir Walter Scott in 1832, no obvious successor to the throne of English letters had yet been crowned, although the smart money was on a colourful historical novelist from Manchester called William Harrison Ainsworth, closely followed by the radical Whig MP Edward Bulwer-Lytton. Both authors were hugely popular in the 1830s and both were conceptually linked through the development of what came to be known among reviewers as the ‘Newgate’ novel. As the term implies, the heroes of these novels were criminals, often lifted from the pages of Newgate Calendars, lurid accounts of crimes, trials and executions named after the infamous prison.\n\nThis article provides readings of three stories, all featuring mesmeric clairvoyance, and published within a five-year period: George Eliot’s short story “The Lifted Veil; Edward Bulwer-Lytton’s novel A Strange Story; and George... more\n\nThis article provides readings of three stories, all featuring mesmeric clairvoyance, and published within a five-year period: George Eliot’s short story “The Lifted Veil; Edward Bulwer-Lytton’s novel A Strange Story; and George MacDonald’s The Portent, published in three parts in The Cornhill Magazine from May-July, 1860, then revised, expanded and published in a single volume in 1864. Although the three authors use mesmerism for different ends, the texts share a tendency to treat mesmeric clairvoyance with suspicion; it is depicted as neither desirable nor useful, and the opportunities afforded by mesmerism are repeatedly restricted, denied, or relinquished. In part this negative portrayal is a reflection of the skepticism with which mesmerism was often viewed, as demonstrated by Grove and Skae above. However, it is not just mesmeric clairvoyance which is suppressed, but the different values which it has come to represent by the end of each narrative."
