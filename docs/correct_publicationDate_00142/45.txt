Vril, the Power of the Coming Race is an 1871 novel by Edward Bulwer-Lytton. Its readers have been those who believed that its account of a subterranean master race and the energy-form called "Vril" was real, to the degree that theosophists, including Helena Blavatsky, William Scott-Elliot, and Rudolf Steiner, accepted the book as being somewhat based on occult truth. A book, The Morning of the Magicians (1960), suggested that a secret Vril Society existed in pre-Nazi Berlin. Despite no solid evidence that the society existed.
