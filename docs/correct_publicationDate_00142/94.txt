Written by Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, an English aristocrat this beautiful copy of one of his Gothic novel Ernest Maltravers that was written in 1837. It has an inscription inside the cover from 1896. It was published by Belford, Clark & Co that were defunct by the turn of the century.

The title page is torn from the spine but the spine is tightly bound. For a book that is well over 100 years old it is in excellent overall condition.
