Belur Halebidu is the second in line of our world-heritage UNESCO Karnataka series. Before assuming that I am on a world heritage roll;Hampi was a planned trip, Belur Halebidu was not. Happening to be in Chikmaglur, getting back to Bangalore seemed to be a bad idea without covering Belur Halebidu, a mere 30 kms away. (The roads defy physics; few things in life come close to riding an already battered Activa on roads fit for trekking). The temples at Belur made up for the bone rattling ride.

Belur

A proposed UNESCO World-Heritage, the Chennakesava temple at Belur is considered to be one of the highlights of the Hoysala rule in India. The temple was more far more intricate than the ones at Hampi. (It lacked the old-world rustic charm and preservation of Hampi, though).

The black granite, perfectly round pillars were something I noticed for the first time in Belur. (They became a norm later as I progressed to Halebidu and the other temples at Belur.) The bracket figures were intricate. (The guys building these must have had some patience!)

Halebidu

Halebidu is to Hoysala what Vitthala is to Vijayanagara. You know you are in for a treat when you see a sign quoting Percy Brown declaring Halebidu to be the supreme climax of Indian architecture. (No clue if he had been to the rest of the country’s historic marvels as well, but yeah, close enough!)

With perfectly lined pathways, and lawns surrounding the temples, it is evident ASI is doing its bit to attract tourist worldwide to this UNESCO world heritage site. That’s the difference between Hampi and Halebidu; Hampi retains the old world charm; except for the few tar roads and the odd electricity pole, it’s hard to assume you are in the 21st century and in the midst of a world famous tourist spot. Halebidu, on the other hand, with its manicured lawns, peddlers trying to sell you guidebooks and shops selling knickknacks right outside the temple complex, your journey back in time gets a rude jolt the moment you step out the temple gates.

The Hoysaleshwara temple at Halebidu is the pinnacle of the Hoysala dynasty’s prowess in architecture. This (below!) was a figurine at the entrance!

The roof of the Hoysaleshwara temple is marvelous.

Random tip: Every time you visit archeological monuments in Karnataka, look up!

There are two massive monoliths of Nandi at Halebidu. Thankfully, a barricade has been put up to prevent idiots from trying to proclaim their everlasting love. (The damage is evident).

Halebidu has a Kedareshwara temple (a stone’s throw away from the Hoysaleshwara).

Belur Halebidu is around 220 kilometers from Bangalore. A weekend trip is ideal to cover both in exquisite detail.
