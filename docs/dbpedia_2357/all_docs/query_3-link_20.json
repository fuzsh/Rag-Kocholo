        "text": "Category: happiness\n\nWanderings and Sojournings\n\nEvery â€˜soulâ€™ that owes its existence on this earth, would yearn to wander i.e, roam around, at times, and soujourn i.e, stay calm, at times. The definition of soul, is at times, beyond what can be comprehended by our mind. One such beautiful soul, is the river Cauvery, also spelled as Kaveri, who has captivated many other souls, by her grace and bounty.\n\nThis blog post, is more of a photo blog, travelling along the river Kaveri, from its source at Talakaveri to its ultimate destination, the great Bay of Bengal.\n\nI have had the opportunity to visit many significant spots along the river, and capture some beautiful moments, which I wish to post here!\n\nA previous blogpost, explains much in detail, about Pichavaram â€“ â€œTravelogue â€“ Pichavaramâ€œ\n\nGod Bless\n\nCBC VIBGYOR BLOG TAG 2 â€“ INDIGO\n\nThis post is part of the CHENNAI BLOGGER CLUBâ€™S CBC VIBGYOR BLOG TAG 2 where some of us will write a post on the colours of VIBGYOR each day starting 1st of May to the 7th of May, 2020.\n\nThe colour theme for todayâ€™s post is INDIGO\n\nIndigo is the colour placed in the second position of the visible spectrum of the hues. The deep colour is much popularized by the denim fabric, which was initially dyed using the extract from the â€˜indigoâ€™ plant.\n\nAs much my memory travels behind over the lane, I can recollect my first tryst with denim jeans, probably at the age 7-8, when my grandparents took me for shopping to Mota Royal Arcade, one of the very few malls that existed in Bangalore, during the splendid 90s.\n\nWearing denim jeans was much a fantasy and a fashionable thing to do, at that time, and is still so! It gave an immense level of happiness to wear one, and roam around!\n\nDenim was supposed to be the tough garment of the labourers, going through the wear and tear. It gradually developed into a fashionable garment and still continues to be so, in hues of indigo and few others too.\n\nGod Bless\n\nTemple Tales\n\nThiruvilandur\n\nIn continuation of the previous post about Mayiladuthurai, here is the next post on Thiruvilandhur, another famous neighborhood within the town limits of Mayiladuthurai, where the Parimala Ranganathar Temple is situated.\n\nThiruvilandur, also known as Thiruindhalur, is a Diyva Desam (Temple/Holy Places, glorified in the works of Alwars) Lord Vishnu resides, in the form of Parimala Ranganathar.\n\nGently resting on the five hooded serpent Adisesha, flanked by Sridevi and Sri Boodevi, worshiped by Lord Brahma, with Surya and Chandra, Kaveri and Ganga, the Lord smiles calmly, within the rectangular sanctum, illuminated by the ghee lamps, besieged in the aroma of fresh Tulasi leaves!\n\nAs per the legends, the moon is said to have been cursed to lose his shine, and was relieved of the curse and regained his splendor, by performing penance and worshiping the Lord at Thiruvilandur.\n\nThe uniqueness of this temple, is the presence of Kaveri and Ganga, personified as Goddesses, present within the sanctum, worshiping Lord Parimala Ranganathar.\n\nThe temple is quite spacious, with several beautifully carved stone pillars. The temple pond, abounded by fishes, is situated right opposite to the temple.\n\nThis temple is said to be the Antya or Tail end of the Ranganathar Temples situated along the banks of the river Kaveri, over its course. The Adi or beginning being Ranganatha Temple at Srirangapatna near Mysore, followed by Ranganatha Temple at Shivasamudra, then the humongous Ranganathar Temple at Srirangam, the Sarangapani Temple at Kumbakonam being other four Ranganatha Temples, in order.\n\nThe temple has a calm atmosphere, intercepted by the occasional chants of the devotees and recitals of the priests. Several festivals are celebrated in the temple, throughout the year. It is no exaggeration, to mention this little neighborhood as a fragment of Vaikunta on earth!\n\nCheers. God Bless.\n\nTemple Tales\n\nContinuing from my previous posts, about the trip to Delhi, I start another series of posts â€“ Temple Tales. Right now, iâ€™m based at Mayiladuthurai, a vibrant town in the heart of Tamil Nadu. Mayiladuthurai is a temple town, with many temples, big and small abounding the neighborhood. It is also the base for visiting the various other popular temples, temple-circuit of Tamil Nadu.\n\nMayiladuthurai\n\nMayiladuthurai, which was earlier known as Mayavaram, Mayuram, is a vibrant town, situated on the banks of the river Kaveri. The place derives its name from Mayuranathar Temple, which is the largest of the many temples in Mayavaram.\n\nMayuranathar Temple is an ancient one, dedicated to Lord Shiva. Legend has it that, Parvathi in the form of a Peahen, worshiped Shiva. Hence, the Lord gets the name Mayura â€“ Nathar (Peafowl â€“ Lord). Historically it also mentioned that Mayavaram was abounded by peafowls.\n\nHistorically, the huge temple complex was built, re-built by the Chozha kings. And currently, it is administered by Dharumapura Adheenam, a Saivite monastic institution. The temple is situated about a kilometer to the south of the river Kaveri.\n\nThe temple is surrounded by North Madavilagam, South Madavilagam, Mela Veedhi (West Street) and Keela Veedhi (East Street), on the four sides, on each direction, as indicated by the names. The names of the streets, were found quite captivating. Usually temples have mada veedhis around them, as I had known, and these names were new to me!\n\nMayiladuthurai is also a bustling trade hub. There are several shops selling a variety of products. Owning to the temple circuit, there is huge inflow of pilgrims, and other tourists to this place, throughout the year.\n\nThe tales of this beautiful town, is to be continued, in the next post too.\n\nCheers. God Bless.\n\nTravelogue â€“ Agra\n\nIn continuation of the previous post Travelogue â€“ Delhi, I carry on herewith with my next post, on the trip to Agra.\n\nIt was a misty Sunday morning, that we mobilized, to set out over the widespread Yamuna Expressway, enroute to Agra. The path was lined with occasional fields, some abandoned stations, grazing cattles, random buildings, Dhabas, huge electric transmission towers.. the list of interesting sightings are endless. Though these werenâ€™t anything new to be seen, all of them had an inquisitive quality, which seemed as if they wanted to display to the South Indian visitors!\n\nToo obvious to be said, our visit stop was at the Taj Mahal. The crowd to enter the fortified enclosure of the wonder, was quite huge, given the weekend, with about two hours being spent in the serpentine queue. Honestly speaking, I wasnâ€™t that big a fan of the Taj Mahal, and have even commented on how over rated the building is! Well, the marble wonder, proved me wrong at the first live sight I had. The mausoleum stood calm, bathed in the shining rays of the sun. The monument seemed to grow in size, as we proceeded further towards it!\n\nWe got to spend some quality time relishing on the beauty in stone. The interior of the mausoleum housed the tombs (or replica) of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz. The mighty Yamuna was smoothly meandering along.\n\nAfter spending some quality time with the Taj Mahal, we bid adieu to it, and moved to the Agra Fort. It was this, that came as a surprise. The Agra Fort Complex is one severely underrated destination/monument. Built of red stand stone, with interior chambers built of white marble, and also some splendid inlay works, this is yet another monument, matching (or should I say towering) the magnificence of the adjacent Taj Mahal!\n\nThe fort complex, was well designed with demarcated quarters for the royals, soldiers, public meetings, and various other Mughalistic occasions. The Mughals seemed to have a specific love towards setting up artificial water formations, that were designed in a quite interesting manner, be it the formations at the fort, or the fountains at Taj Mahal.\n\nAnother interesting feature of the Mughal architecture is the extensive usage of marble inlays, be it a fort, or a mausoleum, or a private chamber, or a public gateway!\n\nFew other clicks of the majestic Agra Fortâ€¦\n\nThe sole day tour to Agra, was worth every minute spent, though it requires several days to explore through the streets of the old city!\n\nMany more travelogues coming up!\n\nCheers. God Bless.\n\nTumkur Diary\n\nIâ€™ve been in and around Tumkur for quite a few months. A place that Iâ€™ve heard of, located in maps, heard occasionally, and had never thought would visit, forget â€˜live*â€™ here.\n\nA calm, and vibrant place, when compared to the neighboring Bengaluru, Tumkur (oops itâ€™s Tumakuru now!) is famous for the Siddaganga Mutt and the 109 year old and still rocking Swamiji. He is referred to as Nadedaduva Devaru (Walking God), and no amount of praise can be attributed to the yeoman service that he has done, and is doing for the betterment of the society.\n\nTumkur is also famous for its numerous colleges, that it is known as the Educational District of Karnataka [FYI, Chennai also has a lot of engineering colleges ðŸ˜‰ Only a Chennaikaaran/kaari can appreciate a subtle joke here!]\n\nTumkur has got another nickname â€“ Kalpatharu Naadu â€“ A place that gives boons to all! Yeah it has given several boons to me, that Iâ€™d treasure for a lifetime and more [Again FYI, Chennai is known as Vandhaarai Vaazha Veikum Chennai â€“ A place that helps a person to thrive, when he comes here, to Chennai]\n\nTumkur is surrounded by hills, small and large which gives an opportunity for a lot of sceneries and weekend escapes. The Siddaganga Mutt itself is situated at the foothills of a range of hills, with the Siddaganga Temple situated over a small hill. Siddarbetta, Siddagange, Chinnaga Betta are few other popular hills with temples, in this region. Madhugiri (which translates to honey-hill) is another rocky place, bit far from here, which has the second largest monolith of Asia, along with some ancient forts.\n\nTumkur, already a city with good facilities, is under development to be a smart city, with facilities like full wi-fi connectivity, rapid transportation system, and to name. Tumkur is very well connected to Bangalore, around 75 kms away, with bus and train facilities. Tumkur enjoys the same climate as of Bangalore, with almost same facilities, yet lesser pollution, lesser traffic and cheaper cost of living. No wonder it is already a smart city!\n\n*I didnâ€™t want to use the word stay, for youâ€™d have understood that I havenâ€™t stayed, but lived in Tumkur!\n\nCheers\n\nGod Bless\n\nSongs of Spring\n\nSpring season is loved by everyone. And more by those, for whom, the springs blows away the harsh and cold winds of winter, literally and metaphorically!\n\nIt could be the truth, or psychological effect, or a beautiful imagination, the onset of this period of time (last final weeks and February, and the beginning weeks of March) brings a sudden gush of energy and happiness into me, every year, right from childhood.\n\nProbably it could be, because of the anticipation of completing the annual exams (Iâ€™ve never feared exams ðŸ˜‰ ) and enjoying the long summer holidays, the happiness of playing on streets without fear of rains disrupting (actually I loved rain, but the fact that Iâ€™d be pulled into home, by grandma, made me detest it slightly) the excitement of family tours, the joy of watching TV without any restrictions, the happiness of relishing pulpy, sweet-tangy mangoes, and the reasons could go on and on, in the days of childhood.\n\nMeanwhile, semester holidays which arrived during spring/summer gave me uninterrupted time to read books, start blogging ðŸ™‚ , occasionally go out and play (I stopped playing out, once getting into college, unlike my friends. Not sure if a good or bad thing ðŸ˜€ ) and few to name, to happen in the later days of my life.\n\nNow spring/summer doesnâ€™t make a difference in the routine or â€˜timetableâ€™ of the day. Yet the spirit of spring remains intact and brings in a fresh wave of energy, from nowhere.\n\nWell, on a second thought, if we make and take the best of any situation, and derive happiness from it, everyday of life is spring, with flowers blooming around and butterflies abounding everywhere!\n\nSharing an all time favourite song of mine..that matches the situation here!\n\nP.S..the title for this post was inspired by one of the chapters in my 6th standard English Literary textbook â€“ Songbird in Spring Time â€“ a short biography on M.S.Subbulakshmi. One of the few chapters from my school textbooks that I can never forget!\n\nCheers\n\nGod Bless\n\nTwo Thousand 15\n\nA post with specially picked photos from my phone, that defined the year 2015 for me\n\nIts twenty days since the beginning of 2016, and a budding procrastinator is here with a recap of 2015!\n\nCheers_________________________________________\n\nGod Bless\n\nFood Glorious Food\n\nItâ€™s a while, and it seems like Iâ€™m on an exile. And when I decided to return back to post, what can be better than one of my favourite topics, rather the favourite of many â€“ Food, Glorious Food!\n\nFood is the basic necessity, for survival for any organism. For some organisms, food is a matter of life and death, for some it is a luxury, for some a celebration or a fantasy, or happiness, or divine, or something beyond.\n\nI was always taught from childhood that food (any food) is divine, and should always be treated with respect. Food must never be wasted, but at the same time, our body must not be overloaded. This is perhaps the only lesson Iâ€™ve religiously followed until now!\n\nAt this moment I recollect a conversation from one of my favourite books â€“ The Pregnant King. //And I run to fetch the book, to type the lines as they are, from the book//\n\nâ€“ â€“ Once, while wandering in the woods, they came upon the carcass of a wild buffalo teeming with maggots. â€˜How disgustingâ€™, cringed Shilavati.\n\nâ€˜I donâ€™t think the maggots will agree with youâ€™, said Prasenajit. Shilavati realized the wisdom in her husbandâ€™s simple words. The human way is not the only way in this world. â€“ â€“\n\nOneâ€™s disgust is someone elseâ€™s food, someoneâ€™s waste could be oneâ€™s food, and thatâ€™s the way our beautiful universe is meant to be.\n\nLetâ€™s stop with philosophy and move to the fun part. Did miss saying food could be fun? Yes food must be respected and not wasted, yet there can be a lot of fun over food. Trying out new cuisines to eat, or cook, trying new recipes, spending a calm afternoon with only food for company, a romantic time with beloved and food! And wading through the tough times, or celebrating happiness, or nothing for that matter, food always and should come in, to be a part of that moment to complete it, in my honest opinion!\n\nWhen it comes to food, one habit of mine seems to be a boon as well a curse. Iâ€™m still to determine, from where Iâ€™ve acquired this habit of eating slow. I have no idea of when, or how it started, but Iâ€™ve always eaten slowly. This comes as a great boon because, eating slowly come with a lot of benefits, as discussed everywhere. And it becomes a nightmare while having a formal lunch with team members!\n\nIâ€™ve got several advises too, to speed up the process of my eating. But why would I give up the temptation to relish the moment, slowly ðŸ˜€\n\nHave food, have fun and please do not waste them!\n\nP.S.. Food, Glorious Food, is one of my favourite poem, from Oliver Twist\n\nCheers\n\nGod Bless\n\nMeanwhile..\n\nWhile I was away for a while, this happened!\n\nWords and Lines was rated as one of the Top 15 Creative Writing Blogs in India by Baggout.\n\nThis is very great, and honour for me. Thanks a ton to Baggout, my dear fellow bloggers and friends who inspire me a lot, to blog and to live ðŸ™‚\n\nFollowing is the badge, provided by Baggout.\n\nAnd also check out this post to find out the other awesome blogs â€“ Top 15 Creative Writing Blogs in India\n\nCheers\n\nGod Bless\n\nDoodling\n\nIâ€™m left with nothing to do, for next 2 weeks. And I chose my favourite pastime â€“ doodling. Hereâ€™s one of them, just a random doodle, without any theme. Open to interpretations ðŸ™‚\n\nCheers\n\nGod Bless\n\nLoveWins, Oh but really?\n\nIn a significant judgement, the Supreme Court of the US has recognized the equal status of its LGBT citizens. Itâ€™s nice to see people offering their support by various means. There is so much positivity, hope, warmth shown all around in the social media. But how much of it is genuine? Is India ready for such a change? Are Indians willing to accept such a reform wholeheartedly? All I had to say about this were 5 things, as tweets.\n\nStatus updates, profile pic changes, etc are good and give a positive feel, but how many actually support LGBT wholeheartedly? (1)\n\nConstitutions, courts can give mandates, but itâ€™s up to the people to overcome prejudices! (2)\n\nTalking about India, when just tweeting about gay things can fetch rude, â€˜well-wisher warningâ€™ messages, miles to go ahead! (3)\n\nAnyway, people judge, hate, love, accept according to their capabilities but one leads their own lives ðŸ™‚ Smile and cheers! (4)\n\nFinally, plant rights didnâ€™t make me a plant, hence gay rights wonâ€™t make me gay! Thanks and sorry for the ranting-tweeting spree! (5)\n\nHope iâ€™m clear headed and have summarized my thoughts.\n\nAgain emphasizing that there is so much positivity, love and warmth all around. Wishing and praying that it lasts genuinely forever and Love Wins always. Union of souls is beyond the spectrum of gender, orientation, religion, caste, creed, *whatever differences have been created by humans* and we have a long way to reach there!\n\nP.S. Supporting gayness doesnâ€™t make me gay (if iâ€™m not already, actually ðŸ˜‰ ) And the term gay actually means happiness (if you donâ€™t know already) Special cheers!\n\nCheers\n\nGod Bless\n\n3D â€˜Sâ€™tuff\n\nIt has been a long time since iâ€™d posted anything on animation. Itâ€™s long time since I opened 3D S Max and designed few models. High time to brush up. And posting few of my favourite models that iâ€™d been designing over the past few months in 3D S Max..\n\nCheers\n\nGod Bless\n\nVacation Chronicles ~ 3\n\nMelkote\n\nFollowing the earlier two posts â€“ Vacation Chronicles ~ 1 and Vacation Chronicles ~ 2 â€“ The stones are alive! here goes the third and concluding post on my vacation.\n\nThis post is completely dedicated to a beautiful, clean, serene, divine, calm, picturesque, peaceful, little town in Karnataka, named Melkote. It is at a distance of about 50 kms from Mysore and has good, accessible road from there. And still, iâ€™m still out of adjectives to sing the praise of this place!\n\nMelkote, also known as ThiruNarayanaPuram is more of a pilgrimage center, than a tourist spot, and thatâ€™s the main reason we were there (remember I had mentioned family vacation/pilgrimage in the earlier post?) The CheluvaNarayana Temple and the YogaNarasimha Swamy Temple atop a small hill are the important temples, apart from a few other ancient, antique temples here.\n\nMelkote is quiet, little town with few ancient temples, many clean and pristine ponds surrounded by lush greenery, simple and traditional homes, clean roads, little shops, a Sanskrit college and academy, scenic vistas, humble and helpful people, which makes a person fall in love with this place again and again!\n\nThe YogaNarasimha Swamy temple is situated atop a small hill. Visiting this temple requires a climb of around 200 rock cut steps, which are covered by lush greenery, and occasional stone mantapa. There were many monkeys and goats along this way too, giving us a good company.\n\nAnd not to forget the yummy Puliogare and Chakare Pongal that we got to taste here. Simply divine! And for the uninitiated, Puliogare and Chakare Pongal are a delicacy present in many South Indian Temples. They are supposed to be second most important aspect of the temple, the first being the Lord ðŸ˜‰\n\nFrom the various experiences that I had here, the one I loved the most are the divinity and the cleanliness of this place. Divinity is beyond the scope of any explanation and our understanding! So moving on to the cleanliness aspect, the temples, roads, ponds, public washrooms are maintained so well in this little town!\n\nOverall, the pilgrimage to Melkote was nourishing to the soul, pumping up more faith into the mind and lifting up our spirits.\n\nCheck out the following links, which provide more information on Melkote. Please do pay a visit to this place and get an experience of a lifetime!\n\nMelkote â€“ Wikipedia\n\nMelkote â€“ Anudinam\n\n***The pictures included in this post were taken by me***\n\nCheers\n\nGod Bless\n\nVacation Chronicles ~ 2\n\nThe stones are alive!\n\nContinuing from my previous post â€“ Vacation Chronicles ~ 1, here I go with my second post. Without any explanation, by the end of this post, you would know why â€˜The stones are alive!â€™\n\nStanding at the threshold\n\nof the mighty and impressive\n\nChennakeshava Devasthana*,\n\nI wonder,\n\nDo I bow to the Lord\n\nOr the spirit of the sculptors?\n\nThen, I feel His charm\n\nAnd I bow to the Lord,\n\nwho dwells in and as\n\nthe soul of the sculptor,\n\nAnd of the stone!\n\nThe following pictures were taken at the ChennaKeshava Temple complex at Belur, Karnataka. ChennaKeshava expands to â€˜Chennagi Iruva Keshavaâ€™ which means the Handsome Keshava, in Kannada. His temple is beautiful, but His charm is matchless!\n\nChronicle to be concluded in next post Vacation Chronicles ~ 3 â€“ Melkote\n\n*Devasthana = Place of God ~ Temple\n\n***The pictures included in this post were taken by me***\n\nCheers\n\nGod Bless"
