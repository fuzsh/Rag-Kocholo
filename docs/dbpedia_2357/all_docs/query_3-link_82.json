        "text": "Shravanabelagola is a city of ponds and temples in the Hassan district of Karnataka, India. It is one of the most important Jain pilgrimage and cultural heritage sites in South India. The main attraction of Shravanabelagola is the Bahubali Gomateshwara statue, one of the largest monolithic statues in the world and one of the seven wonders of India.\n\nThis article will provide you with all the information you need to know about Shravanabelagola, its history, significance, attractions, festivals, and travel guide.\n\nHistory and Legend of Bahubali Gomateshwara\n\nBahubali or Gomateshwara was the son of Rishabhanatha, the first Tirthankara or spiritual teacher of Jains. According to Jain legend, Bahubali was a powerful king who renounced his kingdom and attained enlightenment after a fierce battle with his brother Bharata. He stood in meditation for a year on a hill, during which vines grew around his legs and ants crawled over his body. He achieved Kevala Jnana or omniscience and became a Jina or conqueror of inner enemies.\n\nThe Bahubali Gomateshwara statue on Vindhyagiri Hill in Shravanabelagola was built by Chavundaraya, a minister and commander of the Ganga dynasty, in 981 CE. He was inspired by a dream in which he saw the statue on the hill. He commissioned the sculptor Arunagiri to carve the statue out of a single block of granite. The statue is 58 feet tall and depicts Bahubali in the Kayotsarga posture, standing erect with arms by his side, eyes closed, and a serene expression on his face. The statue has intricate carvings of vines, ants, snakes, and elephants on its body and pedestal. The statue is considered a masterpiece of Indian art and architecture.\n\nMahamastakabhisheka: The Grand Anointing Festival\n\nThe Mahamastakabhisheka is a grand anointing festival that is held once in 12 years to honor the Bahubali Gomateshwara statue. The festival is a celebration of peace, harmony, and spirituality among Jains and other communities. The festival lasts for several days, during which thousands of devotees gather at Shravanabelagola to witness and participate in the rituals and ceremonies.\n\nThe main ritual of the festival is the anointing or abhisheka of the statue with various substances, such as milk, honey, saffron, sandalwood, turmeric, and gold coins. The substances are poured from large vessels or kalashas by priests and dignitaries from a scaffolding erected around the statue.\n\nThe anointing symbolizes the purification and consecration of the statue as well as the devotion and gratitude of the devotees. The anointing is followed by other rituals, such as offering prayers, flowers, fruits, and lamps to the statue; reciting hymns and mantras; performing dances and music; and taking vows of non-violence, truthfulness, non-attachment, and self-control.\n\nThe Mahamastakabhisheka festival is a spectacle of color, sound, and emotion that attracts millions of visitors from across India and abroad. The festival showcases the rich culture and heritage of Jainism as well as the unity and diversity of India. The festival also promotes social welfare and environmental awareness among the participants. The last Mahamastakabhisheka festival was held in 2018 , while the next one is expected to be held in 2030.\n\nTemples and Monuments on Vindhyagiri and Chandragiri Hills\n\nShravanabelagola has many temples and monuments on both Vindhyagiri and Chandragiri hills that are worth visiting for their history, architecture, and religious significance. Some of the notable ones are:\n\nChandragiri Hill Temple:\n\nThis temple is located on Chandragiri Hill, opposite to Vindhyagiri Hill.

It also preserves many ancient manuscripts, sculptures, paintings, and relics related to Jainism.\n\nJain Culture and Beliefs in Shravanabelagola\n\nJainism is an ancient religion that teaches non-violence, truthfulness, non-attachment, and self-control as the means to attain liberation from the cycle of birth and death. Jainism believes in the existence of Tirthankaras, who are enlightened beings who have attained Kevala Jnana or omniscience and have shown the path of salvation to others.\n\nJainism also believes in the existence of Jinas, who are liberated souls who have conquered their inner enemies such as anger, greed, pride, and delusion. Jainism also believes in the concepts of Dharma, which is the principle of cosmic order; Karma, which is the cause and effect of actions; Ahimsa, which is non-violence towards all living beings; Anekantavada, which is the multiplicity of viewpoints; Syadvada, which is the conditional expression of truth; and Aparigraha, which is non-possession or detachment from worldly things.\n\nJainism has two major sects: Digambara and Shvetambara. Digambara means “sky-clad” or naked, while Shvetambara means “white-clad” or clothed. The main difference between them is their interpretation of the ascetic practices of Tirthankaras and Jinas. Digambaras believe that Tirthankaras and Jinas renounced all possessions, including clothes, while Shvetambaras believe that they wore white clothes or robes. Digambaras also believe that women cannot attain Kevala Jnana or liberation unless they are reborn as men, while Shvetambaras believe that women can attain both.\n\nShravanabelagola is a stronghold of Digambara Jainism in South India. It has been a center of Jain culture, learning, and art for over a thousand years. The people of Shravanabelagola follow the teachings and traditions of Digambara Jainism with utmost devotion and reverence.
