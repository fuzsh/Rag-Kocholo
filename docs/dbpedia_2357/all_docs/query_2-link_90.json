        "text": "Quote History\n\nOriginally Posted By headstoner:\n\nThanks! I'm getting confused with people talking Inca, Mayan, Egyptian and also every location under the sun. Lol The argument has gone off the rails.\n\nThe very beginning of that video is already a bit misleading, that is not how to properly use a chisel to cut a stone. It looked like he was trying to smash his way through the stone, that very seldom works if quality is the end result.\n\nThe second image of the tool marks on stone look exactly like the tool marks left from diamond cutting with a cable or even a saw. I now wonder if they may have used the rope and sand method, but may have affixed diamonds to the ropes or used small particles and diamond dust.

It's copper, not bronze, and doesn't explain everything.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeS5lrmyD74\n\nIt is instructive from the standpoint that soft materials that were well documented in use and readily available can cut hard granite. It doesn't take extraordinary technology.\n\nThere's also been some work with pendulum saws that replicate the kind of stone cutting you see at Mycenaean sites - which have also been put forward as too technologically advanced and only explainable with fantastical methods.\n\nBTW Headstoner - glad you're still around mate\n\nThanks! I'm getting confused with people talking Inca, Mayan, Egyptian and also every location under the sun. Lol The argument has gone off the rails.\n\nThe very beginning of that video is already a bit misleading, that is not how to properly use a chisel to cut a stone. It looked like he was trying to smash his way through the stone, that very seldom works if quality is the end result.\n\nThe second image of the tool marks on stone look exactly like the tool marks left from diamond cutting with a cable or even a saw. I now wonder if they may have used the rope and sand method, but may have affixed diamonds to the ropes or used small particles and diamond dust. That would surely make very precise cuts.\n\nEdit: I just finished the video, very interesting for sure. I would even bet that they would have used those methods(which we still use today) and added more ingenuity to them. It certainly shows soft metals cutting stone, but ibwould think after doing it thatvway they could come up with better ways to cut even faster.\n\nI meant on this earth as well as in this thread man\n\nIt amazes me that we quickly abandon relatively mundane expaltions for the supernatural.\n\nThe pendulum saw for example. When first put out there a few of the usual suspects immediately claimed it couldn't cut all the way through the spans of stone we see at the Cyclopian sites. It was an immediate and pretty reflexive denunciation. The claim was the saw would get fouled and wouldn't cut deep enough. It was odd because quite a few had already figured out why the offset was there.\n\nAttached File\n\nFWIW there's some pretty blatant misinformation in this thread. Claims the Andean stone masons didn't have metal tools. Even at early Tiwanaku sites we have well accepted evidence of metal securing rocks together. So they had at least copper and there's a great deal of evidence for arsencial and at least by the Inca had tin - even high bismuth bronzes. Bismuth bronze isn't very useful for stone work but pretty and it indicates they had a decent level of metallurgical tradition. Regardless there's ample evidence of hard mineral tools that would do the job, as Headstoner as a master stone carver (I apologize if the title is incorrect) has attested too.\n\nThe second is, a lot of this ancient stonework - especially in \"production\" areas like walls and large works - were softer sandstone and limestone. So it's not that difficult to work. Harder to work stuff like granite - andesite and basalt were used for monuments and statuary - as well as some limited large scale structures, but it was limited. If there was no investment of labor necessary since the methods were so advanced why not use the \"good\" stuff for everything. Regardless there's again ample evidence of the type (diorite/dolomite pounders, hard mineral cutters and grinders, sand) and methods to cut and shape stone. I doesn't take electric grinders or laser beams - it took time and craftsmanship.\n\nQuote History\n\nOriginally Posted By Alacrity:\n\nI meant on this earth as well as in this thread man\n\nIt amazes me that we quickly abandon relatively mundane expaltions for the supernatural.\n\nThe pendulum saw for example.

In some structures the hardness level of the stones is such that bronze tooling would stand ZERO chance of shaping a single block within 30 years, let alone an entire structure in a mere decade or two. I'm not talking about granite.\n\nLook at some of the oriental columns that were lathe spun. Multi-ton columns far larger than a man, spun with apparent ease, and cut/polished to near mirror like finishes. Fine cutting grooves and detail work that would have simply bent narrow bronze tooling. Super fine detail grooves in this example:\n\nHand rubbed? lol\n\nThese people had access to some sort of tooling that made this stuff easy. The intricate detail work is mm's thin in some places. Sorry, but no way were soft, manual hand tools used to create these fine details.. These people had acess to power tools of some sort. Electric? Maybe not.. Sound operated or vibrational? Who know..?\n\nThis throws off the accepted/taught timeline of man having steel or other very hard metals by centuries.\n\nObviously spun. Also, no way those lengthwise flutes were cut with soft chisels. Damn things had to be milled after lathe turning:\n\nModern man trying to replicate these hasn't been too successful and has to involve multi-ton STEEL machinery to accomplish it..\n\nThen there's the modern interpretation of how they were moved hundreds of miles. On log rollers or finely cut stone ball bearings since some of those have been found..\n\nSorry, but people aren't moving these on log rollers. There's not a log on the planet that would hold this kind of tonnage. Let alone the varying terrain underneath those rollers for hundred of miles..\n\n\"They built earthen ramps to position the stones into place\" is a complete joke..\n\nSome of these stones definitely had to be poured or cast in to place, possibly carved details afterwards.\n\nJust shaping and test-fitting this 12 angle block alone boggles the mind. It would take CNC work these days to make it so perfect AND to get it in to place would still take huge machinery, etc. Lots of things to consider here..\n\nWe don't know 1% of how they did ANY of this. That much is clear. But it certainly is far, far earlier than any Inca civiliation. I'm starting to believe more and more about a race of giant people, possibly 15ft tall give or take.. Or larger. Evidence has been found that supports this, but various museums and churches suppress this info. I found a compilation of news articles a while back on the numbers of giant skeletons found and it's in the thousands now. They'e been finding them worldwide for over 100 years now, but ALL of those articles are nearly impossible to find unless you search old newspaper records on microfiche. In-depth articles anyway.. It's another interesting area of study. Double rows of teeth are certainly interesting.. Knowing there was megafauna on Earth at one time only serves to help add weight to this.

Or do you mean composite pillars?\n\nAnd the large monolithic modern photo implied, as did your claim above mocking \"hand rubbed\" implying wasn't possible because they were too large. They are relatively easily handled round stone slabs, stacked and pinned - like the rest of the ancient world did.\n\nI hope you realize I'm VERY OPEN to these claims so I'm not at all trying to get you.

It doesn't take extraordinary technology.\n\nThere's also been some work with pendulum saws that replicate the kind of stone cutting you see at Mycenaean sites - which have also been put forward as too technologically advanced and only explainable with fantastical methods.\n\nBTW Headstoner - glad you're still around mate\n\nWorth noting that puma punku and several other sites had evidence of on-site copper smelting found at those locations.\n\nIt is also worth noting that you can see the original saw marks through hard stone (granite, quartzite, Basalt) all over the place in Egypt and the NOVA crew in no way replicates it. NOVA made a wallowed out crooked grove. The people who sawed stone in Egypt made cuts a fraction of an inch wide and completely straight.\n\nWhat fraction of an inch? I truly loathe that idiom, because it's so horrendously imprecise. 7/8ths is a fraction, after all.\n\nyeah I am sorry for that. 3/16\" seems to be pretty normal in Egypt. Kept very straight for 10-12-16 feet or more in stuf that is 6 or 8 or 12 feet wide. Granite, quartzite, Basalt. Then you have bowls and vases, and curved surfaced that are mirror perfect in symmetry made of the same stuff, Granite quartzite and basalt.\n\nModern copper is generally 70%-85% copper and the remaining alloys are specifically added to harden the copper.\n\nModern copper alloys are probably harder than bronze was when it was made back in the day.\n\nQuote History\n\nOriginally Posted By waterglass:\n\nNope.

We haven't become dramatically more intelligent than ancient modern humans, we have the same basic wetware. Now throw in thousands of laborers, and some determination, and you can do some pretty amazing things.\n\nOccam's razor usually cuts right through topics like this.\n\nThat man is clearly an ET/Human hybrid.

If you can create either one of those AC current is possible. Then it is a hop and skip to simple radios. The trick is knowing how to. I think they could have done a lot with chemistry.\n\nI think it is possible for people to have figured a lot of stuff out and then utterly disappear.\n\nI consider our society of the last 100 years to be fantastical. splitting atoms, coordinated supply chains spanning the earth communicating real time thanks to satelites. expanding the population of the earth and using atomic energy (medical and industrial usages) to save billions of lives on and on and on... That is fantastical and I do not believe anyone has achieved it before us.\n\nI don't think most people would give up their technical advances to others out of some sense of compassion. I think most peoples would consider doing so to be giving up a huge advantage in power that could be used against them. Without sharing tech and having the kind of world spanning networks of goods and information sharing we have accomplished I think it would be impossible to do what we have.\n\nbut to answer your question, beyond being able to rule out aliens, IDK."
