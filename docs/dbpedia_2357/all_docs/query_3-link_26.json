Is this is a secret government organization or an underground bunker? No. This is a historic structure known as the Adalaj Ni Vav. Almost perfectly aligned along the North – South axis, its design is totally unique. It does not have an entrance on the North side at all, and no entryways in the center of the structure as well. But on this side, it has 3 entrances with steps, in three directions, right to next to one another. Why was such a unique architecture built many centuries ago? What are these three octagonal structures on top?\n\nNow, let’s get on the ground and try to get a closer view. This is a very surprising structure, because nothing is visible from the ground level. Usually, I show you structures starting from ground level and going up. In this one, we start from the ground level and we are going to go down. Yes, this is an underground structure, but you know how many levels, how many floors go underground? It goes five stories below, it has 5 different levels. What do experts say about this structure? Experts call this the Adalaj Step well, and It was designed with 2 separate wells to provide water to the public. A giant structure with so many levels and carvings just to provide water? But there is an even more weird claim. Wikipedia calls this an Indo – Islamic structure meaning that the structure was built by both Hindus and Muslims? How is this possible?\n\nWe have come more than 75 feet deep and we have reached the bottom most level of this structure, and you can see this circular well. It looks remarkably simple, seems to be about 12 feet in diameter, and just 30 feet deep. There are steps radiating on all four sides to help people access water from all sides. Is this well, really the primary purpose of building this vast 5 storied underground structure?\n\nAs you can see, there seems to be nothing else here, so let’s go back up and look at the other details. No. Wait, what about the second well, I told you there are 2 wells here, right? Where is the second well? Let us go past this first well, and see if we can find it. After we go past the first well, there is another structure. And you can see a narrow entrance here, it is just 2 feet wide. It is so narrow that only one person can go through. And here, we can see the secret, second well. It is smaller than the first well, and it is also less deep. If you look carefully into the well, you can see the bottom, it is probably less than 15 feet deep. Why would anyone build 2 separate wells right next to one another? I mean they are for the same purpose, to drink water, right? Today, imagine you are building a house, would you dig 2 separate wells, or put 2 bore wells, right next to each other? This would be like putting 2 separate entrances in front of your house, nobody does it, because there should be no use for this. But the original builders must have a had a valid purpose for this, and we cannot understand what it is. Why is this well hidden from public view?\n\nAnd see here, very fascinating carving – 2 kissing fish. What do they mean? I have repeatedly shown you carvings like this, they indicate the presence of ground water underneath, and here we see it directly in the walls of the well. And look at the walls, you can see the shallow rectangular chambers – 3 chambers specifically. Inside these chambers, you can find carvings of Hindu Gods. And each chamber would be visible from one floor. Why did they put these carvings and chambers in this wall? What is the real reason for building such a fantastic, 5 storied structure? As we come out of the second well, you see.. this area between these 2 wells is completely covered. Look carefully, do you see anything strange?\n\nNow, from this side of the first well, look at the architecture carefully. There are no dome shaped arches, this looks like a typical Hindu architecture. They put large pillars on the sides, and had very wide rectangular passages. And notice the pillars. The pillars are not made of bricks, they are not plastered, they are made of giant sandstone blocks.\n\nBut now, let us go to the opposite side of the same well, and look at the other side. This is shocking, because it is a completely different architecture. These are Islamic doorways, with those typical curves and arches. They are not made of giant stone blocks, they are all made of bricks, and they are covered with plaster. This is a typical muslim construction, that you see in a mosque. So on one side, you see a Hindu architecture, and on the other side we see a Muslim architecture. Who really built this structure – Hindus or Muslims?\n\nTo understand this, let us explore this place and try to analyze some of its carvings. On top, you can see the classic Islamic style. There are symmetric Minars. There is this large minar on the left side, on the other side, again, there is an identical large minar. Right next to it you can see this tower, and again you can see an identical minar on the other side as well. And you can see this 3rd minar, on both sides. This kind of symmetric alignment of Minars is found in Mosques not only in India, but also around the world, so it is clearly a Muslim style of carving.\n\nBut right below this, you can see that this gets even more confusing. You can see these elephants, and you can also see horses. And you can see other animals like Yali, very typical of Hindu carvings and what’s even more interesting, you can also see carvings of human beings. Muslims are not allowed to carve humans or animals, because they do not want idol worship. These animals, especially the Yali is very typical of Hindu structures. And you can see this Yali, carved in many places in this structure, and you can also see the bells hanging at the end of chains in many places all over the structure. Bells are also forbidden in Islam.\n\nSo who built it – Hindus or Muslims? Hindus started the construction and almost near the end of the construction, Muslims took over the structure. And Muslims finished the rest of the structure. This is why archeologists call it an Indo-Islamic structure. But how did they both co-operate and complete this ancient structure? Because in my channel I have shown you several ancient temples that have been destroyed by Muslims, right?\n\nBecause the Adalaj Stepwell is not a true ancient structure. Now normally, I don’t show you any structure that is not ancient, I show you structures that are built 800 years or older. But the Adalaj Step well is only 525 years old. In India this falls into a timeline called medieval history, not ancient history. Why did Hindus and Muslims combine together and create the structure?\n\nBecause times are slowly changing at this point. In the ancient timeline, Muslims were foreign invaders who came from a different country, they could easily dehumanize the Hindus as “inhuman or infidels”, because they had never seen this culture. But in the medieval times, Muslim rulers were born here and they grew up watching Hindus side by side, so they were not foreigners and they somewhat adapted to Hindu culture, and Hindus also adjusted with them.\n\nBut who started the construction, what did they originally worship? Locals say the construction was started by a queen by the name of Ruda Devi. And she worshipped a deity called Bhageshwari, who is carved on that floor.. let us go take a look at this deity. Today, Goddess Bhageshwari is worshipped as an idol in many Indian states, but how was she depicted 500 years ago? As we reach this area, we are surprised. We see a massive lion like animal, It looks brilliant and it is shown with one limb up in the air. If you look at its face, you are not reminded of a lion, it looks more like the extinct saber-toothed tiger. It is adorned with a bell on its neck, but do you see this Trident in the background? It is a very interesting depiction, it is not clear if the Trident is simply placed in the background, or if the trident has pierced the lion. But there is another stunning detail, there are 2 eyes carved between the prongs of the trident, creating a face like appearance. This is an amazing carving with so many, mystical, hidden details. Look at the small metal trident here, you can see the fresh flowers right next to it, this means they are still worshipping this carving everyday, a ritual that is ongoing for many centuries. But where is Goddess Bhageshwari? Look at this area, this part has been deliberately destroyed. Let me try to re-create this with photoshop. You can clearly see that she is standing and petting the lion’s face with one hand. This could be the Goddess Bhageshwari, shown as a powerful deity and carved petting a massive lion. Or maybe the face that is created inside the trident represents her. Both these depictions are quite different from today’s idols of her.\n\nBut look at this figure. What is this? Is it a dinosaur? A large, stout body, thick legs and a very long neck? Or, are we having a distorted view of the carving, because it is destroyed? At the bottom you can see these elephants on both sides, let me show you a closeup of one pair and let’s see what we can find. You see this large bell like object in the center? And if you look carefullly you can also see the small bells attached to them. But you see these weird things here, look at these patterns. Why are they carved on these elephants? What is the meaning of these patterns?\n\nCloseby, there is another carving. It looks similar to the previous carving, but instead of the trident, see what is there? Yeah that same pattern, this is a type of knot. Why is it carved in this important place? Why are they performing rituals on it, even today? What is its meaning? You can see the bells with chains on both sides, and also on the animal’s neck. But there is something very strange about this animal. At least that one looked like an extinct lion like species. This one looks totally different. It has a very different face, it has a curved snout, and look at those bulgy eyes. Is this one of the horns, it seems to be curved like the horns of a ram. However, it does have a mane like that of a lion and you can also see that its body and legs are similar to a lion. What animal is this? Is this some type of a prehistoric extinct animal? Again, at the exact same area, you can see something has been deliberately demolished. What is it? Is it the ancient Hindu Goddess Bhageshwari? But there is yet another strange figure here. Look carefully, is this a dinosaur? We know of these large plant eating dinosaurs like sauropods. Did the original builders carve dinosaurs? If this is not a dinosaur, What other animal could this be? It has 4 legs, so it is definitely not a bird, what animal looks like this?\n\nThis site is full of many strange, unexplained carvings hiding in deep, dark areas. This is where the secret information lies. Here you can see something that looks just like meaningless flower patterns. But look carefully, you can see an insane amount of knots. In the outer circle, you can see 8 knots, and in the inner circle, you can see 4 knots. What is the meaning of this carving? All over this structure, you can see the same knot carved in the most obscure places. Why?\n\nIt is normal to see carvings of various deities in Hindu structures and floral designs in Islamic structures. But in this structure, you see some very strange, mystical patterns.\n\nLook at this one, a very odd carving with a lot of details. Inside is a flower, with some petals, and surrounding that, we can see gear like teeth, then and you can see the radiating patterns on all directions. And you can see three chains connecting a jar at the bottom. There are 4 bells carved around it. Very interesting carving, But what does it mean?\n\n, you can see the floral work commonly known as Jali in India. you can find similar carvings in many Mosques and Muslim structures. And this is intricate stone work because this entire panel is carved out of a single stone, and it needs a lot of work. You can insert your finger inside, and it comes out the back. So imagine the amount of work needed to create these carvings. Some claim that these are mystical Sufi symbols. And look at this one, I know this one looks the same as the previous one I showed you, but this one has 2 chakras at the top and bottom, and the previous one did not. Some call this an Islamic mystical symbol but local Hindus claim that this is Kalpavriksha or a divine tree.\n\nI hope you liked this video, because I have never shown you an Indo-Islamic structure, you can see the change in the mindset, where Hindus and Muslims are adjusting to each other. And you see the these 2 stoneworks side by side. While the Islamic Invaders who came a 1000 years ago, would have completely demolished these carvings, the Muslims in Medieval times adjusted to it, and even completed the structure. While ancient Hindus would have completely abandoned the structure, if Muslims took over a place, medieval Hindus continued to visit and use it and even performed rituals or pooja, which continues to this day.\n\n–Praveen Mohan\n\n𝐄𝐗𝐏𝐄𝐑𝐓𝐒 𝐖𝐈𝐒𝐇 𝐓𝐇𝐈𝐒 𝐃𝐎𝐄𝐒 𝐍𝐎𝐓 𝐄𝐗𝐈𝐒𝐓\n\n𝐓𝐇𝐄𝐘 𝐀𝐑𝐄 𝐂𝐎𝐕𝐄𝐑𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐈𝐓 𝐔𝐏\n\n𝐌𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐓𝐞𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐬 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐨 𝐀 𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐄𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐍𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭?\n\n𝐒𝐍𝐀𝐊𝐄, 𝐌𝐎𝐍𝐊𝐄𝐘 & 𝐋𝐈𝐙𝐀𝐑𝐃 – 𝐀𝐍𝐂𝐈𝐄𝐍𝐓 𝐈𝐍𝐃𝐈𝐀𝐍 𝐒𝐄𝐂𝐑𝐄𝐓 𝐑𝐄𝐕𝐄𝐀𝐋𝐄𝐃\n\n–Praveen Mohan\n\n𝐘𝐎𝐔 𝐂𝐀𝐍𝐍𝐎𝐓 𝐔𝐍𝐒𝐄𝐄 𝐓𝐇𝐈𝐒 | 𝐌𝐄𝐃𝐈𝐀 𝐖𝐀𝐍𝐓𝐒 𝐓𝐎 𝐇𝐈𝐃𝐄 𝐓𝐇𝐈𝐒 𝐓𝐄𝐌𝐏𝐋𝐄\n\n–Praveen Mohan\n\n𝐓𝐇𝐄𝐘 𝐖𝐈𝐋𝐋 𝐍𝐄𝐕𝐄𝐑 𝐏𝐑𝐈𝐍𝐓 𝐓𝐇𝐈𝐒 𝐈𝐍 𝐁𝐎𝐎𝐊𝐒\n\nHey guys, today we are going into the ancient temple of Tirupperunturai, and I am going to show you some impossible carvings found here.\n\nBut wait, we have already walked past a miracle. Two miracles. Look at these carvings. Look at their height. Yes, they are made of stone, and in this picture, you can see my height and you can compare that with the height of these statues. Each statue is about a whopping 15 feet tall.\n\nIn today’s world of new age marketing where the substance is 10% and marketing is 90%, we do not value the ancient system of modesty. The ancient builders deliberately placed these extraordinary carvings in unnoticeable locations, and wanted you to miss them. If you enter this temple, there is a 99% chance that you are not going to enter like this, and then turn around and look at these giant carvings. You are probably going to walk straight into the temple without looking back. And by the time you are finished exploring this huge temple and are going home, you would be too tired to observe these 2 statues. So, the ancient builders intentionally put them here not to be seen, but why?\n\nBut it is not just the Giant size that stuns us, if we examine the micro details, it is even more stunning. At the top of the left Giant, there are 4 different bands. The first one shows the Sun and the Crescent moon alternating, symbolizing day, and night. The next band shows a series of strange cylinders and each cylinder looks shiny at the top, but has some patterns below. Each one is a Sahasralinga, a type of Linga indicating the presence of Lord Shiva. Below that we can see another band studded with chakras and conchs. The Chakra and Conch signify Lord Vishnu, the protector of everything, and below that you can see a band with a bunch of circles. If you count the number of circles, there are 9 circles, the navagrahas or the 9 heavenly factors that affect planet earth. So, this deity is basically wearing the entire universe as a bunch of garlands, as he appears to be towering over the universe.\n\nHis hair and his fierce looking face have a lot of fantastic details but I am gonna skip that and go to the weapons. On the top 2 hands, he is holding some weird things. Can you tell me what they are? This is a quiver, a bag which holds a bunch of arrows, and you can see that he is pulling out one arrow using just 2 fingers. On the other hand, this is a bow, it looks tiny in his hand, simply because he is a giant. But there is a detail here that is just unbelievable. Look at the string of the bow, how it goes like this with enough space, but here it is tightly clasping his thumb. The string is stretched because he has inserted his thumb, and now there is tension, this is technically called elastic tension, so it has to align tightly with his thumb. And then again, you can see that there is enough space between the bow and the string here, after the thumb. A fantastic detail that cannot even be seen with the naked eye, I had to zoom in with my DSLR, that’s how I found it. On this hand, you can see an animal, it is actually a deer, and on the other side, you can see a tiny, axe like weapon. There are long stories attached to these two things called Maan and Mazhu. In the hand below, you can see a trident, and you can easily mistake it for the Shiva’s trident or the Trishul, but again another strange detail. In the center, it is not just a prong, it somewhat looks like a piece of the vertebral column, right? This is another weapon called Vajra, which can produce the power of a lightning. So, it is a combo weapon, where you can electrocute the enemy while impaling him with a trident. On this side, there is another strange weapon that looks like a ring. You can see how his finger is inserted into the ring, of course he is a giant, so the ring looks tiny next to hm. However, I have already shown you a ring like ancient weapon called the Chakra. This is what he is holding. And below that, this is a shield, a round shield with a protrusion in the front, but from this angle, it looks strange, and on the other hand, you can see a sword or a dagger. And he has two more arms by the way, and look what he is doing with them. He is holding someone by his hair, and he is going to cut his head off. Look at the longsword he is holding in the other hand, and how it is placed on the victim’s neck. Now, what is fascinating is how he is holding the sword. This is not how a soldier holds a sword, a soldier typically holds a sword firmly in his hand while fighting someone. But this deity is a Giant, right? And the victim is tiny. Because of the size, you should imagine how a biologist would hold a scalpel while dissecting a frog. He would just hold it with 2 fingers, because he is not afraid of the frog. And that’s exactly what we see in this statue, he is holding the longsword casually with his 2 fingers and is going to dissect the victim. And look here, he is wearing a shin guard made of chains, to protect his shin, just like today’s soccer players. If you are a warrior, you definitely need shin guards. Not to mention his sandals, I mean look at the height of the sole, these are huge, why does a giant who is already giant, need more elevation, and you can even see the strap going around. But look at this detail, the kneecap, look at how it is projecting out, and looks like a cup. This is exactly how a human knee would look, and look at the shin bone, how it protrudes like a line. Now, look at the carving, and you can see the exact same detail.\n\nI am not going to discuss this statue on the other side, but there many many differences between these 2 statues, for example, his eyes are open and you can see a weird expression. He is not using a sword; he is using a long spear and the victim is lying on the floor. But look at this detail here on the back of his leg. There is a depression, a thin line of depression between the shin bone and his calf muscles. If you observe a human body, when a person’s leg is elevated, this depression does not appear, but if he is standing, this depression becomes clearly visible. So, imagine the mindset of ancient builders who paid attention to the microdetails in anatomy, while carving these15 feet tall, macro statues.\n\nLook at this horseman here. You can see this little bump on his knee, right next to the knee cap. Now look at this bump on a real human leg. I don’t want to complicate this by going into the anatomical name of this bump, but these are fascinating details and look at the muscles of his thighs. See how it is curving down because of gravity. And, they not only paid attention to human anatomy, look at this horse, notice its teeth? You may think this looks more like human teeth, it looks exaggerated, right? No, horses have teeth that look perfect, quite similar to the teeth of humans. And look at the back of the jaw, there is not much teeth here, again look at the statue and look at how the sculptor was paying attention to the anatomy of the horse, carving the inside of its mouth.\n\nBut it gets better, look at how this man is holding a long spear, ready to attack someone. Look at his chest muscles, his pectoral muscles, see how well defined they are, and below that, look at his rib bone, these bones comes out when you are inhaling. Your rib cage becomes prominent, when you breathe in. And why is he holding his breath? Because he is lifting this huge spear. Next time when you lift something heavy, notice what happens. You will hold your breath and your rib bones will come out. But, look at the back of his hand. See these 4 lines, they look familiar, don’t they? Now, you just turned your hand, and looked at the back of your hand, didn’t you? You may think these are nerves or veins, but these are tendons that join muscles to bones. Each tendon is going up one finger and you can see how they are flaring up. They are only coming out, because he is lifting a heavy spear and he is holding it in this position. But look, in the same carving, let me show you the other hand. Where are the tendons? They are not visible, because he is merely holding the reins with this hand, so there is no tension, that’s why the tendons are not flaring up. Today, you will only find these details in medical texts about anatomy, these tendons are called extensor digitorum tendons. So, understand the profound knowledge and wisdom of ancient sculptors. Some historians say ancient Indian kings used slaves to make these carvings. Will a slave, who is forced into labor, create such details?\n\nLook at this figure, look at his chin. He has a bump on his chin, but adults rarely have such bumps, but you can see this mostly in babies. Lots of babies have these chin bumps. But why does this deity have it? He is Lord Karthikeya, the youngest or the baby of Shiva’s family. That’s why he is shown with a chin bump. And look at his belly, he still has baby fat. And look at his leg here, look at this projection on the ankle. You can see how it is carved perfectly, exactly like a human leg. But keep an eye on this area, above his toes, you don’t see anything here, right? Now, let me show you this carving, look at this deity’s leg. You can see the same bone protruding out, but look at this, you can see a tendon. This is a tendon going to the big toe. In medical texts, there is a fancy name for this, it is called the Tendon of extensor hallucis longus. And look here, you can see a bunch of other tendons as well, and all these fibrous things flaring up. Now, you saw the tendons on a grown man, or a grown god, but let’s go back to the baby god Karthikeya. Look above his toes, you cannot see any tendons. Why? Because he has baby fat covering his tendons.\n\nNow, let’s go back to the grown-up God Narasimha because we are not done yet. Lord Narasimha is destroying someone, using his bare hands, by ripping his intestines out. You can see how his fingers are going into the victim’s belly, but do you see the problem here? This large tube-like thing is the large intestine or the colon, and these two smaller tubular things are the small intestine. This is extraordinary, when we see external details like bones and tendons, we can claim that the sculptors were using models and just carved what they saw. But how could this sculptor carve the small intestine and the large intestine, he would have had to cut someone’s belly open to see these details.\n\nNow, I have shown you just 5 or 6 carvings in this ancient temple, and there are more than one thousand carvings in this temple. So, imagine how long we would need, to discuss all these carvings of the temple. Have you ever seen such details anywhere? Who knew, this temple in a small village of South India, would have such incredible carvings? How did ancient builders understand so much about human anatomy?\n\n–Praveen Mohan\n\nThe 𝐁𝐀𝐍𝐍𝐄𝐃 𝐅𝐈𝐋𝐄𝐒 of Tirupperunturai Temple\n\nHey guys, today we are going into an extraordinary ancient temple called Tirupperunthurai. And inside this temple, there are unbelievable carvings that can rewrite history.\n\nWhen we enter this chamber, your eyes are naturally attracted the deity inside the chamber, but look on top of the doorway. On the lintel, you see a number of patterns. What are they? What do they mean? Are they meaningless patterns carved just for decoration? No, let us take a closer look at them.\n\nIn Chemistry classes, we learn about molecules made of different atoms, are these molecules? Or, are they simple flower designs? Don’t they remind you of stars in the sky? Yes, these are 27 Lunar stations called Nakshatras, you can see these stations in the night sky. Lunar station, that’s a fancy word, right? What is that? It is not a space station or something like that, take the sky or the ecliptic and you can split that into 27 segments using groups of stars as markers for each segment. Each segment is called a Nakshatra or a star system. Why? To calculate time, dates, seasons, everything can be done using these nakshatras. Today most people think that these are used solely for astrology.\n\nBut think about how ancient people calculate time during the night? Did they not have any indicators of how to tell time during night time? No, you can tell time by following the positions of stars, groups of stars, etc. So these nakshatras were also used in Astronomy.\n\nBut are these carvings really showing lunar stations? Or, am I just guessing? You can see these inscriptions here, these are written in ancient Tamil language, and I can read them even today, here it says “Uthram”, here it says “Pooram” it is called Poorva in Sanskrit. These are the names of the lunar stations or Nakshatras clearly written under each rectangle. And inside each rectangle, we can the shape and position of stars, so there is no doubt that these are in fact, nakshatras. And this script also tells us something important, this is an ancient script that is somewhat different from today’s script used in Tamil language. They have used a big circle to represent the ‘mm’ sound, this is not how we write Tamil today. This confirms that these carvings were done during ancient times.\n\nBut, these carvings are not supposed to exist in this ancient temple, they should not show these details. Why am I saying this? Look at this rectangle, this is called Magha, and you can clearly see 4 stars making up the Lunar station. This is called Regulus in Today’s astronomy, but the strange feature is that, Regulus or Magha will appear to be a single star for the naked eye. And only when you use a telescope, you realize that it is made of 4 stars Regulus A, B, C and D. Yet, these 4 stars and its positions are accurately carved under the name Magha. So, without using an advanced telescope, how could ancient builders carve these details?\n\nHere is another one, this text says Revathi, which refers to ‘Zeta Piscium’ in modern astronomy. This is a ‘quintuple star system’ meaning it is made of 5 stars, quintuple means 5. But again, all these 5 stars are not visible to the naked eye and we need a telescope to see the 5 stars. But surprisingly, these 5 stars and their positions are carved accurately in this ancient temple.\n\nMainstream experts tell us that the telescope was invented only about 400 years ago in Europe. And only in the last few centuries, the telescopes came to India. So how can we see this kind of advanced information in this ancient temple? Are these carvings new, carved in the last 100 years? The script seems to defy this idea, it must be older, and I could not find any direct evidence that this was carved recently.\n\nBut in 2014, Archeologists found inscriptions in the temple, and these inscriptions confirm that this temple was built between 862 and 879 A.D. These inscriptions also tell us the name of the builder, as well as the king who ruled this region at that time. This means that this temple was built more than 1100 years ago.\n\nAccording to historians, the most recent expansion or re-construction happened in the 16th century. So, this means, the carvings we see are at least 500 years old, but the telescope was only invented 100 years later. And the telescope did not even come to India for another 100 years. So how do we see these details that can only be observed using telescopes?\n\nRemember, I am being very conservative in my estimate. I am not taking the oldest construction date which is 1100 years ago, I am taking the most recent known date of expansion & re-construction and even that, is 100 years older than the mainstream timeline of the invention of telescope. So how did ancient builders carve these star systems accurately?\n\nBut, we have ancient carvings of the telescope in Hindu temples. I have shown you 2 carvings, in 2 different temples, both of them show a cylindrical device, placed on one eye, with the other end pointing to the sky. These are clearly telescope like devices. Archeologists accept that both these carvings are about 900 years old. This explains how, they observed and documented all these star systems and lunar stations perfectly.\n\nBut right next to these star systems, you can see these strange Gods. Who are they? Is it possible that they have the answers to our questions? How did ancient builders understand the stars so much? Did they use advanced technology like telescopes to study the sky? If not, how could they carve these nakshatras or lunar stations accurately, with the exact number of stars?\n\n–Praveen Mohan"
