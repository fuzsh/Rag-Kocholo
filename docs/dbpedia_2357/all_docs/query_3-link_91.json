        "text": "Indian temple is considered to be a synonym for Indian architecture worldwide. Most of the authors describe temples only with the physical form of the temple. During the 18th & 19th C, there was literature published to evaluate the architecture of these temples. The interpretation is very superficial; restricting the explanations only to the visible structure excluding any consideration of the philosophy/ science behind the construction of the temples. This method to describe and analyze the temples continues to be followed by the majority of scholars widely. The ignorance about the philosophies mentioned in the oriental literature is evident. This paper aims to establish a need to have an “Indian” viewpoint to appreciate the temples holistically.\n\nEach epoch possesses a discernible construction methodology that is inherently unique and emblematic of the prevailing ideologies, cultural progress, artistic inclinations, and architectural prowess of its particular civilization. From a nuanced standpoint, Hindu Temples stand out as embodiments of knowledge, artistic brilliance, architectural magnificence, and cultural legacy, symbolizing the pinnacle of building technology in the ancient Indian subcontinent. The timeless principles and customs of Indian Temples go beyond historical boundaries, echoing deeply in the present context, thereby sustaining the flexibility of traditional Indian values and wielding a significant effect on the socio-economic tapestry of society. This scholarly work delves into the intricacies of temple styles, design principles, geometric configurations, structural systems, and the intricate construction technologies intrinsic to Indian temples. The exposition meticulously unfolds the distinctive architectural styles and elements inherent in Hindu Temples. Furthermore, a comprehensive elucidation of the geometric design principles that underscored Indian temple construction is expounded upon within this discourse. The paper meticulously delineates the construction technology, commencing with the meticulous assembly of adept teams, through the stages of meticulous planning and intricate carving, and culminating in the seamless assembly of individual components.\n\nLocal traditions govern temple architectural typologies; often, structural styles and building methods were progressively blended depending on congregation of experts and promotion of construction activity. While the texts enumerate many nuances in temple architectural styles, only about twenty-odd types dominate the landscape. Early natural caves and frescoed caverns, inspired by Buddhist prayer halls, evolved to rock-cut caves, which progressively incorporated iconographic objects and sculptures. The form evolved from simple, functional structures to imposing, magnificent buildings, which indicate progression of elaboration of and opulence in rituals― it reflects complexities in symbolism too. Local materials and influences determined regional preferences for designs, which evidence mutual inductance and overlapping of styles. This paper documents the diverse and numerous Hindu temple architecture styles based on not only the designs and traditions that are more recurrently featured in ancient texts, but also the exemplars and archetypes that are most commonly observed in ancient temple structures.\n\nThis volume is a study of the beginning and evolution of temple architecture in India which covers sculptures and carvings as well. With over a hundred plates of temples and carvings on them including cave facades and pillar depictions it deals with temples constructed by the different ancient and medieval dynasties in Indian history particularly the early western Calukyan and later western Calukyans Pallava Pandya, Cola Hoyasala and Nayaka with illustrations that include maps plans of caves and even viharas and caityas it undertakes a study of the temples found in different states of India. The research discusses the variations in plans and elevations to examine development of temple architecture over time and new experiment actions in the building of temples by use of various materials. Reconstructing art and architectural styles from the remnants of the ruined temples in many places it explains terms and concepts in temple building and architecture and cites examples of various temple style and traditions including the best and earliest ones. The focus is on the Dravida and Nagara temple styles and a third hybrid form of sikhara that developed in the Deccan. Many Jaina temples are also covered.\n\nComplexities and Intricacies of the South Indian Temples the evolution of the Dravidian temple design and Architecture took over a 1000 years. Here is the complete story. CONTENTS Introduction page 3 Chapter 1-Dravidian Architecture :History of Temple Architecture in South India page 8 Chapter 2-Shaivite landscapes of “India” and South East Asian Countries and the conflict between the followers of Shiva and Vishnu/ Vaishnavism vs Shaivism Chapter 3-Vimana Temples – Architectural Marvel Of South India page 50 Chapter 4-GOPURA of South Indian Mandirs page 70 CHAPTER 5-Structural Integrity of the South Indian Temples page 95 Chapter 6-The Meenakshi Temple of Madurai mpage 125 Chapter 7-SACREDNESS of HINDU TEMPLES page 156\n\nThis handbook is a comprehensive study of the archaeology, social history and the cultural landscape of the Hindu temple. Perhaps the most recognizable of the material forms of Hinduism, temples are lived, dynamic spaces. They are significant sites for the creation of cultural heritage, both in the past and in the present. Drawing on historiographical surveys and in-depth case studies, the volume centres the material form of the Hindu temple as an entry point to study its many adaptations and transformations from the early centuries ce to the 20th century. It highlights the vibrancy and dynamism of the shrine in different locales and studies the active participation of the community for its establishment, maintenance and survival. The illustrated handbook takes a unique approach by focusing on the social base of the temple rather than its aesthetics or chronological linear development. It fills a significant gap in the study of Hinduism and will be an indispensable resource for scholars of archaeology, Hinduism, Indian history, religious studies, museum studies, South Asian history and Southeast Asian history.\n\nEvery style of building construction reflects a clearly distinctive basic principle that represents a particular culture and era. In this context, the Indian Hindu temples are not only the abode of God and place of worship, but they are also the cradle of knowledge, art, architecture and culture. A temple structure is considered to be everlasting and it should signify the art, architectural and cultural milieu of the period built. It also helps to retain and expand the social and cultural values of Hinduism among the people from one generation to another. This study intends to show that, a temple structure irrespective of its value can act as an artefact of the present generation's culture, knowledge and technological developments.\n\nArt, in many contexts, is seen to have symbolic meanings, pertaining to the context and contributing to it positively. When the shapes and patterns used to create art, starts to acquire meaning contextually, it transcends into &#39;symbolism&#39;. Therefore art contributes in the overall understanding of the structure and ambience. Also, shape evolving into patterns is, more often than not, an algorithmic process. These patterns in consideration are characterised to be fractal in nature. Therefore a logical connection can be made between patterns and their meanings, that is, fractals and symbolism. In Hindu religious architecture, the shapes have a set of meanings, their combinations have certain meanings, and the patterns evolved from them have, either a higher metaphorical meaning or a totally new interpretation. In this paper, symbolic art has been considered in the context of Hindu religious architecture and attempts to link the independent disciplines of &#39;symbolism&#39; and..."
