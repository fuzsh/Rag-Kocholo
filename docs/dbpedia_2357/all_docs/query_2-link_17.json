Compiled by experienced educators and subject matter experts, the solutions reflect in-depth knowledge and analysis, yet full accuracy can only be assured after the release of the official key by UPSC.\n\nConsider the following statements:\n\nStatement-1: The atmosphere is heated more by incoming solar radiation than by terrestrial radiation. Statement-II: Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are good absorbers of long wave radiation.\n\nWhich one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?\n\n(a) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II explains Statement-I\n\n(b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct, but Statement-II does not explain Statement-I\n\n(c) Statement-I is correct, but Statement-II is incorrect\n\n(d) Statement-I is incorrect, but Statement-II is correct\n\nContents\n\nToggle\n\nExplanation\n\nThe correct answer is: (d) Statement-I is incorrect, but Statement-II is correct.\n\nStatement-I is incorrect: The atmosphere is not heated more by incoming solar radiation than by terrestrial radiation. Instead, it is mainly heated by long wave terrestrial radiation. The Earth’s surface absorbs shortwave solar radiation and re-radiates it as longwave infrared radiation, which is then absorbed by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, heating it from below.\n\nStatement-II is correct: Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are indeed good absorbers of long wave radiation. These gases absorb the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface and re-radiate it, contributing to the warming of the atmosphere.\n\nLearn more\n\nTerrestrial Radiation:\n\nThe Earth receives solar energy in the form of shortwave radiation.\n\nAfter absorbing this energy, the Earth re-radiates it as longwave infrared radiation.\n\nThis longwave radiation is absorbed by atmospheric gases, particularly carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.\n\nThis process is known as terrestrial radiation and is the primary way the atmosphere is heated.\n\nGreenhouse Effect:\n\nGreenhouse gases such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and others absorb longwave infrared radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface.\n\nThese gases then re-radiate the energy in all directions, including back towards the Earth’s surface, creating a warming effect known as the greenhouse effect.\n\nThis effect is crucial for maintaining the Earth’s temperature, making it habitable.\n\nInsolation:\n\nInsolation refers to the incoming solar radiation that reaches the Earth’s surface.\n\nThe atmosphere is largely transparent to this shortwave solar radiation, allowing it to pass through and be absorbed by the Earth’s surface.\n\nHowever, the atmosphere absorbs only a small fraction of this shortwave radiation directly.\n\nEnergy Balance:\n\nThe Earth’s energy balance involves the absorption of solar radiation and the emission of terrestrial radiation.\n\nApproximately 30% of incoming solar radiation is reflected back to space, while the remaining 70% is absorbed by the Earth’s surface and atmosphere.\n\nThe absorbed energy is eventually re-radiated as longwave infrared radiation, which is then absorbed by greenhouse gases, maintaining the Earth’s energy balance and temperature.\n\nRole of Greenhouse Gases:\n\nWater vapor and carbon dioxide are the most significant greenhouse gases in terms of their ability to absorb and re-radiate infrared radiation.\n\nThese gases trap heat within the atmosphere, preventing it from escaping into space, thus warming the planet.\n\nWithout the natural greenhouse effect, the Earth’s average temperature would be significantly lower, making it less hospitable for life.\n\nBy understanding these processes, it becomes clear that the atmosphere is primarily heated by terrestrial radiation rather than direct solar radiation, and greenhouse gases play a crucial role in this heating mechanism.\n\nReflection in IAS EXPRESS\n\n[collapse]\n\nConsider the following statements:\n\nStatement-I: Thickness of the troposphere at the equator is much greater as compared to poles.\n\nStatement-II: At the equator, heat is transported to great heights by strong convectional currents.\n\nWhich one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?\n\n(a) Both Statement-I and Statement-II’ are correct and Statement-II explains Statement-I\n\n(b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct, but Statement-II does not explain Statement-I\n\n(c) Statement-I is correct, but Statement-II is incorrect\n\n(d) Statement-I is incorrect, but Statement-II is correct\n\nExpress Learning Programme (ELP)\n\nLearn/Revise 10X Faster!\n\nPrelims Sureshots – Most Probable Topics for UPSC Prelims\n\nA Compilation of the Most Probable Topics for UPSC Prelims, including Schemes, Freedom Fighters, Judgments, Acts, National Parks, Government Agencies, Space Missions, and more. Get a guaranteed 120+ marks!\n\nExplanation\n\nCorrect Answer: (a) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II explains Statement-I\n\nStatement-I: The thickness of the troposphere at the equator is much greater as compared to the poles.\n\nThis statement is correct. The troposphere is thicker at the equator due to higher temperatures, which cause thermal expansion and stronger convectional currents that push the troposphere to greater heights.\n\nStatement-II: At the equator, heat is transported to great heights by strong convectional currents.\n\nThis statement is correct. The equator receives more solar radiation, leading to higher temperatures and stronger convectional currents that transport heat to higher altitudes.\n\nExplanation: Statement-II explains Statement-I because the strong convectional currents at the equator, driven by higher temperatures, result in the expansion of the troposphere, making it thicker at the equator compared to the poles.\n\nLearn more\n\nTroposphere: The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth’s atmosphere, extending from the surface to an average height of about 8 km at the poles and 18 km at the equator.\n\nThermal Expansion: The equator is warmer, causing the air to expand and rise, leading to a thicker troposphere.\n\nConvectional Currents: Strong convectional currents at the equator transport heat to great heights, contributing to the increased thickness of the troposphere.\n\nCentrifugal Force: The Earth’s rotation causes a centrifugal force that is strongest at the equator, pushing the atmosphere to greater heights.\n\nSeasonal Variation: The thickness of the troposphere varies with the seasons, being thicker in the summer and thinner in the winter.\n\nGravitational Pull: The gravitational pull is stronger at the poles, leading to a contraction of the atmosphere and a thinner troposphere.\n\nThese factors collectively explain why the troposphere is thicker at the equator than at the poles.\n\nReflection in IAS EXPRESS\n\n[collapse]\n\nConsider the following:\n\nPyroclastic debris\n\nAsh and dust\n\nNitrogen compounds\n\nSulphur compounds\n\nHow many of the above are products of volcanic eruptions?\n\n(a) Only one\n\n(b) Only two\n\n(c) Only three\n\n(d) All four\n\nExplanation\n\nCorrect Answer: (d) All four\n\nPyroclastic debris: These are fragments of rock ejected during explosive volcanic eruptions. They include various sizes of particles such as ash, lapilli, blocks, and bombs.\n\nAsh and dust: Volcanic ash consists of fine particles of pulverized rock, minerals, and volcanic glass created during explosive eruptions. These particles can be carried by wind over large distances.\n\nNitrogen compounds: Volcanic lightning during eruptions can fix atmospheric nitrogen into bioavailable forms such as nitrate. This process involves the breaking of the dinitrogen bond and subsequent reactions with oxygen.\n\nSulphur compounds: Volcanic eruptions release gases such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). These gases can form sulfuric acid and other sulfur compounds in the atmosphere.\n\nLearn more\n\nPyroclastic debris:\n\nDefinition: Fragments of rock ejected during explosive volcanic eruptions.\n\nTypes: Includes ash (particles <2 mm), lapilli (2-64 mm), blocks (angular fragments >64 mm), and bombs (rounded fragments >64 mm).\n\nFormation: Created by the violent expansion of gas that shreds magma into small particles.\n\nAsh and dust:\n\nDefinition: Fine particles of pulverized rock, minerals, and volcanic glass.\n\nDispersal: Can be carried by wind over large distances, affecting areas far from the eruption site.\n\nImpact: Can cause respiratory issues, damage machinery, and disrupt transportation and communication systems.\n\nNitrogen compounds:\n\nFormation: Created by volcanic lightning, which breaks the dinitrogen bond in the atmosphere.\n\nTypes: Includes nitrate and ammonia, which are essential for biological processes.\n\nRole in prebiotic chemistry: Volcanic lightning may have contributed to the synthesis of nitrogen compounds necessary for the emergence of life.\n\nSulphur compounds:\n\nTypes: Includes sulfur dioxide (SO2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S).\n\nSources: Emitted from volcanic vents, fumaroles, and during eruptions.\n\nImpact: Can form sulfuric acid in the atmosphere, contributing to acid rain and affecting climate.\n\nAll four options listed are indeed products of volcanic eruptions, confirming the correct answer is (d) All four.\n\nReflection in IAS EXPRESS\n\n[collapse]\n\nWhich of the following is/are correct inference/inferences from isothermal maps in the month of January?\n\n1. The isotherms deviate to the north over the ocean and to the south over the continent.\n\n2. The presence of cold ocean currents, Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift make the North Atlantic Ocean colder and the isotherms bend towards the north.\n\nSelect the answer using the code given below:\n\n(a) 1 only\n\n(b) 2 only\n\n(c) Both 1 and 2\n\n(d) Neither 1 nor 2\n\nExplanation\n\nThe correct answer is (a) 1 only.\n\nStatement 1: The isotherms deviate to the north over the ocean and to the south over the continent. This is correct. In January, the isotherms bend northward over the oceans due to the warming effect of warm ocean currents like the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift, and they bend southward over the continents due to the cooling effect of the landmasses .\n\nStatement 2: The presence of cold ocean currents, Gulf Stream, and North Atlantic Drift make the North Atlantic Ocean colder and the isotherms bend towards the north. This is incorrect. The Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift are warm ocean currents, not cold. They warm the Northern Atlantic Ocean, causing the isotherms to bend northward, indicating warmer temperatures .\n\nLearn more\n\nIsotherms: Lines on a map connecting points with the same temperature at a given time or over a specified period. They are used in meteorology to depict temperature distribution.\n\nJanuary Temperature Distribution:\n\nNorthern Hemisphere: Isotherms deviate north over the ocean due to warm currents like the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift, and south over the continents due to the cooling effect of landmasses.\n\nSouthern Hemisphere: Isotherms are more parallel to latitudes due to the ocean’s moderating effect, leading to more gradual temperature variations.\n\nFactors Influencing Isotherms:\n\nLatitude: Temperature generally decreases from the equator to the poles.\n\nLand and Water: Land heats and cools more rapidly than water, causing deviations in isotherms.\n\nOcean Currents: Warm currents (e.g., Gulf Stream) cause northward bends, while cold currents cause southward bends.\n\nTopography: Mountains and valleys can affect local temperature distributions, causing deviations in isotherms.\n\nSeasonal Variations:\n\nJanuary: More pronounced deviations in the northern hemisphere due to larger landmasses and significant temperature differences between land and sea.\n\nJuly: Isotherms generally follow latitudes more closely, with less pronounced deviations compared to January.\n\nUnderstanding these patterns helps in comprehending global temperature distributions and the climatic influences of various geographical features.\n\nReflection in IAS EXPRESS\n\n[collapse]\n\nWhich of the following countries are well known as the two largest cocoa producers in the world?\n\n(a) Algeria and Morocco\n\n(b) Botswana and Namibia\n\n(c) Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana\n\n(d) Madagascar and Mozambique\n\nExplanation\n\nThe two largest cocoa producers in the world are Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana (c).\n\n(a) Algeria and Morocco: These countries are not known for significant cocoa production.

The quantity of water vapour in the air depends on the rate of evaporation and the temperature of the air, which determines its holding capacity. Both temperature and evaporation decrease with altitude, resulting in a rapid decrease in water vapour with altitude .\n\nStatement 2: Its percentage is maximum at the poles.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. Water vapour is present in varying amounts in the atmosphere, but its concentration is generally lower in arid or very cold locations, such as polar regions. The amount of water vapour is higher in warmer regions and decreases from the equator towards the poles .\n\nLearn more\n\nWater Vapour:\n\nDefinition: Water vapour is the gaseous phase of water, produced from the evaporation or boiling of liquid water or from the sublimation of ice .\n\nProperties: It is transparent and less dense than most other constituents of air. It plays a crucial role in the hydrologic cycle and atmospheric processes .\n\nRole in Climate: Water vapour is a significant greenhouse gas, contributing more to the greenhouse effect than non-condensable gases like carbon dioxide and methane. It acts as a feedback mechanism, amplifying the effects of initial warming forces .\n\nDistribution: The concentration of water vapour in the atmosphere varies, typically making up 2-3% of the atmosphere on average, but can be as high as 4% in some regions. It is lower in colder and arid regions .\n\nAltitude Effect: The amount of water vapour decreases with altitude due to lower temperatures and reduced evaporation rates at higher altitudes .\n\nHydrologic Cycle: Water vapour is a key component of the hydrologic cycle, contributing to cloud formation, precipitation, and the overall distribution of water on Earth .\n\nClimate Impact: As a greenhouse gas, water vapour creates a positive feedback loop for global warming. Increased temperatures lead to higher evaporation rates, which in turn increase the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, further enhancing warming .\n\nReflection in IAS EXPRESS\n\n[collapse]\n\nConsider the following description:\n\nAnnual and daily range of temperatures is low.\n\nPrecipitation occurs throughout the year.\n\nPrecipitation varies between 50 cm – 250 cm.\n\nWhat is this type of climate?\n\n(a) Equatorial climate\n\n(b) China type climate\n\n(c) Humid subtropical climate\n\n(d) Marine West coast climate\n\nCorrect Answer: (d) Marine West coast climate\n\nAnnual and daily range of temperatures is low: The Marine West Coast climate is characterized by minimal temperature extremes and a small annual temperature range of about 10-15 °C (50-59 °F) .\n\nPrecipitation occurs throughout the year: This climate type experiences abundant precipitation year-round, with annual accumulations generally ranging from 50 to 250 cm (20 to 98 inches) .\n\nPrecipitation varies between 50 cm – 250 cm: The Marine West Coast climate typically has precipitation totals within this range, although local totals can exceed 500 cm (197 inches) where onshore winds encounter mountain ranges .\n\nExplanation of Options:\n\n(a) Equatorial climate:\n\nHigh temperatures year-round: Equatorial climates have consistently high temperatures, averaging around 26-28 °C (79-82 °F) .\n\nHigh annual rainfall: These regions receive significant rainfall, often exceeding 200 cm (79 inches) annually, with no dry season .\n\nSmall temperature range: The annual temperature range is very small, typically around 3 °C (5.4 °F) .\n\n(b) China type climate:\n\nHot, humid summers and cold, dry winters: This climate features significant temperature variations between summer and winter, with hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters .\n\nModerate to high rainfall: Rainfall ranges from 60 to 150 cm (24 to 59 inches) annually, with a distinct summer peak due to monsoonal influences .\n\nSeasonal variations: The climate is influenced by monsoons, leading to distinct wet and dry seasons .\n\n(c) Humid subtropical climate:\n\nHot, humid summers and mild winters: This climate is characterized by hot, humid summers and cool to mild winters .\n\nEvenly distributed precipitation: Rainfall is generally well-distributed throughout the year, with annual totals ranging from 75 to over 200 cm (30 to 79 inches) .\n\nSummer peak in rainfall: Many regions experience a summer peak in rainfall due to convectional thunderstorms and tropical cyclones .\n\n(d) Marine West coast climate:\n\nMild temperatures year-round: This climate has mild summers and winters, with a small annual temperature range .\n\nYear-round precipitation: Precipitation occurs throughout the year, with annual totals ranging from 50 to 250 cm (20 to 98 inches) .\n\nHigh humidity and cloud cover: The climate is noted for its high humidity and frequent cloud cover .\n\nLearn more\n\nGeographical Distribution: The Marine West Coast climate is found on the western sides of continents between 35° and 60° N and S latitude.

As the wind speed increases, the deflection caused by the Coriolis force also increases. This means that higher wind speeds result in a greater Coriolis effect, leading to more significant deflection of the wind’s path .\n\nStatement 2: It is maximum at the poles and is absent at the equator.\n\nThe Coriolis force is maximum at the poles and absent at the equator. This is because the Coriolis effect is directly proportional to the sine of the latitude. At the poles, the latitude is 90 degrees, making the sine value 1, thus maximizing the Coriolis force. At the equator, the latitude is 0 degrees, making the sine value 0, thus nullifying the Coriolis force .\n\nLearn more\n\nDefinition: The Coriolis force is an inertial force that acts on objects in motion within a rotating frame of reference, such as the Earth. It causes moving objects to be deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nCause: The primary cause of the Coriolis effect is the rotation of the Earth. As the Earth spins, different latitudes rotate at different speeds, causing the deflection of moving objects.\n\nImpact on Weather: The Coriolis effect significantly influences weather patterns. It affects the direction of trade winds, cyclones, and ocean currents. In the Northern Hemisphere, cyclones rotate counterclockwise, while in the Southern Hemisphere, they rotate clockwise.\n\nDependence on Latitude: The Coriolis force is zero at the equator and increases with latitude, reaching its maximum at the poles. This variation is due to the change in the tangential velocity of the Earth’s surface with latitude.\n\nImpact on Human Activities: The Coriolis effect impacts aviation and ballistics. Pilots and snipers must account for the Coriolis force when charting flight paths or aiming over long distances.\n\nExamples: A common example is the deflection of a projectile fired northward from the equator, which lands east of its intended path due to the higher eastward velocity at the equator compared to higher latitudes.\n\nMathematical Expression: The magnitude of the Coriolis force is given by the formula 2𝜈𝜔sin⁡𝜙, where 𝜈 is the velocity of the object, 𝜔 is the angular velocity of the Earth, and ϕ is the latitude.\n\nGlobal Wind Patterns: The Coriolis effect contributes to the formation of Hadley cells, Ferrel cells, and Polar cells, which are responsible for the prevailing wind patterns observed on Earth.\n\nReflection in IAS EXPRESS\n\n[collapse]\n\nOn June 21 every year, which of the following latitude(s) experience(s) a sunlight of more than 12 hours?\n\nEquator\n\nTropic of Cancer\n\nTropic of Capricorn\n\nArctic Circle\n\nSelect the correct answer using the code given below:\n\n(a) 1 only\n\n(b) 2 only\n\n(c) 3 and 4\n\n(d) 2 and 4\n\nCorrect Answer: (d) 2 and 4\n\nEquator: On June 21, the equator experiences approximately 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness. This is because the equator is not significantly affected by the tilt of the Earth’s axis during the solstices, resulting in nearly equal day and night lengths throughout the year.\n\nTropic of Cancer: On June 21, the Tropic of Cancer (23.5° North latitude) experiences more than 12 hours of daylight. This is because the sun is directly overhead at noon, making it the longest day of the year for this latitude.\n\nTropic of Capricorn: On June 21, the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5° South latitude) experiences less than 12 hours of daylight. This is because it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and the sun is at its lowest point in the sky for this latitude.\n\nArctic Circle: On June 21, the Arctic Circle (66.5° North latitude) experiences 24 hours of daylight. This phenomenon is known as the “midnight sun,” where the sun does not set, resulting in continuous daylight.\n\nLearn more\n\nSummer Solstice: The summer solstice occurs when one of Earth’s poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. In the Northern Hemisphere, this happens around June 21, marking the longest day of the year with the most daylight hours. The sun is directly overhead at the Tropic of Cancer (23.5° North latitude) at noon.\n\nEarth’s Tilt: The Earth’s axis is tilted at an angle of 23.5° relative to its orbital plane around the Sun. This tilt is responsible for the changing seasons and varying lengths of daylight throughout the year.\n\nDaylight Variation: The amount of daylight varies significantly with latitude. Near the equator, day and night lengths remain relatively constant throughout the year. As one moves towards the poles, the variation becomes more extreme, with polar regions experiencing continuous daylight or darkness during solstices.\n\nEquinoxes: Equinoxes occur twice a year when the Earth’s axis is not tilted toward or away from the Sun, resulting in nearly equal day and night lengths globally. The vernal (spring) equinox occurs around March 20-21, and the autumnal (fall) equinox occurs around September 22-23.\n\nCultural Significance: The summer solstice has been celebrated in various cultures throughout history. In many European traditions, it is known as Midsummer and is associated with festivals and rituals celebrating fertility and the abundance of the growing season.\n\nReflection in IAS EXPRESS\n\n[collapse]\n\nOne of the following regions has the world’s largest tropical peatland, which holds about three years worth of global carbon emissions from fossil fuels; and the possible destruction of which can exert detrimental effect on the global climate. Which one of the following denotes that region?\n\n(a) Amazon Basin\n\n(b) Congo Basin\n\n(c) Kikori Basin\n\n(d) Rio de la Plata Basin\n\nCorrect Answer: (b) Congo Basin\n\nThe Congo Basin is home to the world’s largest tropical peatland, which holds about three years’ worth of global carbon emissions from fossil fuels. The peatlands in the central Congo Basin cover approximately 167,600 square kilometers and store between 26 and 32 billion tonnes of carbon, making them a critical carbon sink. Only 8% of this peat carbon lies within nationally protected areas, suggesting vulnerability to future land-use changes .\n\nExplanation of Options:\n\nAmazon Basin: While the Amazon Basin contains significant peatlands, they are not as extensive as those in the Congo Basin. The Amazon’s peatlands are important for regional carbon cycling and habitat diversity but do not match the Congo Basin in terms of carbon storage capacity .\n\nCongo Basin: The Congo Basin peatlands are the largest tropical peatland complex in the world, covering 36% of the world’s tropical peatland area and storing 28% of the world’s tropical peat carbon. These peatlands are crucial in the fight against climate change due to their massive carbon storage capacity .\n\nKikori Basin: Located in Papua New Guinea, the Kikori Basin has significant peat swamp forests but does not compare to the Congo Basin in terms of size or carbon storage. The Kikori Basin is known for its biodiversity and ecological importance but is not the largest tropical peatland .\n\nRio de la Plata Basin: This basin, located in South America, is primarily known for its extensive river system and does not contain significant peatland areas. It is not relevant to the context of tropical peatlands and their carbon storage capabilities .\n\nLearn More\n\nImportance of Peatlands:\n\nCarbon Storage: Peatlands store a significant amount of carbon, preventing it from being released into the atmosphere and contributing to climate change. The Congo Basin peatlands alone store between 26 and 32 billion tonnes of carbon .\n\nClimate Regulation: Peatlands help regulate the climate by acting as carbon sinks. They store carbon that plants have absorbed from the atmosphere, providing a net-cooling effect .\n\nBiodiversity: Peatlands support diverse ecosystems, including many plant and animal species. The Congo Basin peatlands are home to endangered species such as the western lowland gorilla and the African forest elephant .\n\nThreats to Peatlands:\n\nLand-Use Changes: Activities such as logging, mining, and agriculture can lead to the drainage and degradation of peatlands, releasing stored carbon into the atmosphere and exacerbating climate change .\n\nOil Exploration: In the Congo Basin, oil exploration poses a significant threat to peatlands. The DRC government has auctioned large areas of peatland for oil development, which could lead to substantial carbon emissions if the peatlands are disturbed .\n\nConservation Efforts:\n\nProtected Areas: Only a small percentage of peatlands are currently protected. Increasing the number of protected areas is crucial to preserving these vital ecosystems .\n\nSustainable Management: Engaging with governments, local communities, and industries to find a balance between development and conservation is essential for the long-term protection of peatlands .\n\nReflection in IAS EXPRESS\n\n[collapse]\n\nWith reference to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that are used in making many consumer products, consider the following statements:\n\nPFAS are found to be widespread in drinking water, food and food packaging materials.\n\nPFAS are not easily degraded in the environment.\n\nPersistent exposure to PFAS can lead to bioaccumulation in animal bodies.\n\nWhich of the statements given above are correct?\n\n(a) 1 and 2 only\n\n(b) 2 and 3 only\n\n(c) 1 and 3 only\n\n(d) 1, 2 and 3\n\nCorrect Answer: (d) 1, 2 and 3\n\nExplanation:\n\nStatement 1: PFAS are found to be widespread in drinking water, food, and food packaging materials.\n\nCorrect.

This relationship is a classic example of coevolution, where both species have evolved together to become mutually dependent. The fig wasp lays its eggs inside the fig fruit, and in the process, it pollinates the fig flowers, ensuring the reproduction of both the fig tree and the wasp.\n\nMahua: The mahua tree is pollinated by various insects, including bees and moths, but it does not have a unique relationship with a single insect species for pollination.\n\nSandalwood: Sandalwood trees are primarily pollinated by wind and insects, but there is no specific insect that has a unique coevolved relationship with sandalwood for pollination.\n\nSilk cotton: The silk cotton tree is pollinated by a variety of insects and birds, and it does not rely on a single insect species for its pollination.\n\nLearn more\n\nCoevolution: This is the process where two or more species influence each other’s evolutionary pathway. In the case of the fig tree and the fig wasp, both species have developed traits that benefit each other, leading to a highly specialized and interdependent relationship.\n\nMutualism: The relationship between the fig tree and the fig wasp is an example of mutualism, where both species benefit. The fig tree gets pollinated, and the fig wasp gets a place to lay its eggs and a food source for its larvae.\n\nPollination: This is the transfer of pollen from the male part of a flower to the female part, enabling fertilization. Insects, birds, wind, and water can all act as pollinators.\n\nSpecialized Pollination: Some plants have evolved to be pollinated by a single species of insect, which can lead to a highly efficient but risky pollination strategy. If the insect species declines, the plant’s reproduction can be severely affected.\n\nBiodiversity and Ecosystem Health: The coevolution of plants and their pollinators is crucial for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem health. The loss of a pollinator species can have cascading effects on the ecosystem.\n\nConsider the following:\n\nButterflies\n\nFish\n\nFrogs\n\nHow many of the above have poisonous species among them?\n\n(a) Only one\n\n(b) Only two\n\n(c) All three\n\n(d) None\n\nThe correct answer is (c) All three.\n\nExplanation:\n\nButterflies:\n\nMany butterflies are poisonous.
