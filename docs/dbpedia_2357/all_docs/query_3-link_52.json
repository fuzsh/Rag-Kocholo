        "text": "Yom Kippur War: Overview\n\nContext: In a recent development on October 7, 2023, Hamas launched an attack on Israel. This action by Hamas has shifted the spotlight back to the 'Yom Kippur War,' which took place from October 6 to October 25, 1973.\n\nPalestine was a territory under the Ottoman Rule.\n\nFollowing the Sykes-Picot Accord, Palestine was given to England as a protectorate.\n\nAntisemitic attitude of Hitler and ostracization of Jews in Europe, led to a decision where England and USA tried to resettle Jews in their original homeland.\n\nPalestine at that time was Arab state inhabited by Muslims.\n\nThe incoming migrant Jews with the aid of USA and Britain, dominated the local Arab population and tried to carve out a state and marginalise Arabs in two pockets of West Bank and Gaza.\n\nThus, Arabs were made as a Stateless-refugees in their own country.\n\nThis created a lot of anger and resistance in other neighbouring Arab countries which wanted to restore the status of fellow Arabs in Palestine.\n\nAbout Six-Day War of 1967:\n\nThe Six-Day War, also known as the Arab-Israeli War of 1967, was a conflict that took place between Israel and the Arab nations of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan.\n\nIt was triggered by Palestinian guerrilla attacks on Israel from bases in Syria, which escalated tensions between the two parties.\n\nSyria, fearing an impending Israeli invasion, sought support from Egypt.\n\nIn response, Egypt ordered the withdrawal of UN peacekeeping forces from the Sinai Peninsula and deployed its troops there.\n\nAdditionally, Egypt and Jordan entered into a mutual defence treaty, heightening the atmosphere of confrontation.\n\nFeeling encircled and under the perceived threat of an imminent Arab attack, Israel initiated a pre-emptive strike against the three Arab states on June 5, 1967.\n\nThis military action resulted in Israel gaining control of the Sinai Peninsula, Gaza Strip, West Bank of the Jordan River, Old City of Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights.\n\nThe status of these occupied territories later became a major point of contention between the conflicting parties.\n\nWhat was Yom Kippur War?\n\nThe Yom Kippur war, also known as the October war or the Ramadan war, marked a pivotal moment in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict. This conflict, fought from October 6 to 25, 1973, involved Israel on one side and Egypt and Syria on the other.\n\nCauses and Course of war:\n\n1.Israel's Post-1967 Ascendancy:\n\nFollowing its decisive victory in the Six-Day War of 1967, Israel had emerged as a dominant regional power.\n\nIt annexed territories, including the Golan Heights from Syria and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, setting the stage for future tensions.\n\n2.Anwar Sadat's Diplomatic Calculus:\n\nAnwar el-Sadat became Egypt's president in 1970.\n\nThe country was facing economical-challenges, no longer to sustain continuous conflict with Israel.\n\nSadat hatched a bold plan to attack Israel, hoping that even an unsuccessful assault would compel Israel to consider peace with Egypt.\n\nIn 1972, he took significant diplomatic steps, expelling Soviet advisers from Egypt and establishing diplomatic channels with Washington (Israel's key ally).\n\nA new alliance with Syria was forged, setting the stage for a coordinated attack on Israel.\n\n4.The Outbreak of War on Yom Kippur:\n\nThe Yom Kippur war commenced on October 6, 1973 which is a significant date for Judaism.\n\nArab coalition forces launched surprise attacks on Israeli-occupied territories.\n\nThe attack, during the holy Islamic month of Ramadan, further exacerbated Israel's unpreparedness as many of its soldiers were on leave for Yom Kippur.\n\nConsequently, Egypt and Syria initially made substantial gains.\n\n5.The Course of Battle and International Involvement:\n\nIsrael eventually rallied its forces and counterattacked.\n\nFighting intensified primarily in the Golan Heights and the Sinai Peninsula.\n\nU.S. President Richard Nixon issued a global nuclear alert due to heightened geopolitical tensions.\n\nComparing the Yom Kippur War to the recent Operation Al-Aqsa Flood\n\nRecently, Hamas initiated 'Operation Al-Aqsa Flood.' The surge of violence has been attributed to the longstanding tensions between Israel and the Palestinians, notably stemming from the dispute over the sacred Al-Aqsa Mosque compound.\n\nThe episode has drawn comparisons to the Yom Kippur War of 1973, marking one of the deadliest assaults on Israel since that time.\n\nDespite its advanced intelligence and interception systems, Israel was caught off guard by the sudden onslaught by Hamas, echoing the Yom Kippur War, during which Israel also found itself ill-prepared due to many soldiers being on leave for Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism.\n\nType 096: China’s Advanced Nuclear Armed Submarines\n\nContext: According to a US report, China is equipping its nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines with advanced JL-3 submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) along with Type 096, the country’s next-generation ballistic missile submarine, that are capable of targeting the continental United States.\n\nAbout Type 096:\n\nType 096 is a class of nuclear powered ballistic missile submarines.\n\nIt will be armed with the JL-3 Nuclear capable Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM). JL-3 is reported as a solid-fueled missile with ranges of over 9,000 km or 10,000 km .\n\nType 096 is the third-generation Sub-surface ballistic nuclear (SSBN) submarine.\n\nSSBNs perform a specialised mission of strategic nuclear deterrence.\n\nTo perform this, SSBNs are armed with submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), which are large, long-range missiles armed with multiple nuclear warheads.\n\nIt has a large pressure hull diameter to incorporate more sound isolation.\n\nIt will complement the existing Type 094 Jin class SSBN. Type 096 are rumoured to be able to carry 24 SLBMs, compared to the 12 of the existing Type 094 Jin class SSBN.\n\nAsian Games: A brief history\n\nContext: India topped the medals table in four sports in the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou\n\nAbout Asian Games\n\nAlso known as Asiad, is a continental multi-sport event held every fourth year among athletes from all over Asia.\n\nMotto is Ever Onward\n\nSince 1982, it has been regulated by the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA), earlier it was by Asian Games Federation (AGF).\n\nRecognised by the International Olympic Committee and is the second largest multi-sport event after the Olympics.\n\n1st edition: 1951 Asian Games in New Delhi\n\n19th edition: 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou, China\n\n20th edition: 2026 Asian Games in Nagoya, Japan\n\nIndia is a founder member of Asian Games.\n\nIndia is one of the seven countries to have participated in all the editions of the Asian Games.\n\nIsrael has not taken part in the Asian Games since 1974.\n\nChina topped the list with 383,followed by Japan.\n\nBreakdance popularly known as ‘breaking’, the sport makes its Asian Games debut this year.\n\nIndia at Asian Games\n\nIndia’s campaign at the 19th Asian Games ended with 28 gold, 38 silver and 41 bronze to a total of 107 medals. This is the best-ever performance of the Indian contingent at the continental event.\n\nIndia also managed to top the medal table in four different events at this edition of the Asiad- archery, cricket, kabaddi and hockey.\n\nIndia made its cricket debut at this edition of the Asian Games.\n\nOrganisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)\n\nContext: Recently, production cuts by major oil producers’ cartel OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum has led to the rise in crude oil price. The Petroleum Minister of India, has highlighted its adverse impact on major consuming nations and urged OPEC to bring balance and affordability in the oil markets.\n\nMore about the news:\n\nIndia ranks as the third-largest consumer of crude oil globally, with a substantial 85% of its oil needs being supplied by imports.\n\nHeavy reliance on imports exposes the Indian economy to significant fluctuations in oil prices.\n\nFor instance: Price volatility can trigger inflationary pressures, disrupt the trade balance, deplete foreign exchange reserves, and pose threats to the post-pandemic recovery.\n\nAbout OPEC\n\nOrganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is a coalition of major oil-producing nations that collaborate to collectively influence the global oil market.\n\nEstablishment: 1960 in Baghdad.\n\nFive Founding members: Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela.\n\nPresent Member Countries: Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Algeria, Angola, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Libya, Nigeria, United Arab Emirates.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), OPEC's combined oil production rate (including gas condensate) represented 44% of the world's total in 2016, and OPEC held 81.5% of the world's \"proven\" oil reserves.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, OPEC underwent a series of restructuring steps that shifting global oil production landscape in favour of oil-producing countries, diminishing the dominance of Anglo-American oil corporations known as the \"Seven Sisters.\"\n\nThe admission of a new member nation necessitates the agreement of three-quarters of OPEC's existing members, including all five of the founding countries. Sudan submitted an application to join in October 2015, it has not yet become a member.\n\nOrganisation and Structure\n\nBefore OPEC's formation, individual oil-producing states faced punitive measures when attempting to alter the governance of oil production within their borders.\n\nThe fundamental principle underlying OPEC is that its members collectively benefit from limiting global oil supply to drive up prices.\n\nDecision-making within OPEC follows these principles:\n\nOPEC Conference, led by delegations, headed by member countries' oil ministers, serves as the organization's highest authority.\n\nOPEC secretary general functions as the organization's chief executive.\n\nConference typically convenes at the Vienna headquarters at least twice a year.\n\nIt generally operates on the basis of unanimity and \"one member, one vote,\" with each country contributing an equal membership fee to the annual budget.\n\nGiven, Saudi Arabia's status as the world's largest and most profitable oil exporter, capable of acting as the traditional swing producer to balance the global market, it effectively serves as the de facto leader of OPEC.\n\nOPEC+\n\nIn response to the steep drop in oil prices, primarily driven by substantial increases in U.S. shale oil production, OPEC entered into an agreement with ten other oil-producing nations in 2016, forming what is now recognized as OPEC+.\n\nThis informal coalition of nations, collectively referred to as OPEC+, comprises Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Brunei, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Oman, Russia, South Sudan, and Sudan.\n\nAmong these ten nations was Russia, the world's third-largest oil producer as of 2022, responsible for 13% of the global oil output.\n\nPublications and Reports\n\nThe OPEC Secretariat produces a wide range of publications with the aim of keeping the public informed about the Organization's activities and disseminating data and insights related to OPEC Member Countries and the global oil industry.\n\nMonthly Oil Market Report, which delves into critical issues confronting the worldwide oil market.\n\nWorld Oil Outlook, known as WOO, presents OPEC's medium- to long-term perspective on the global oil market.\n\nLegend of Sammakka-Sarakka\n\nContext: Recently, Union Cabinet Ministry, approved a tribal university for Telangana-‘the Sarakka Central Tribal University’. The Central Government announced the establishment of the university as a part of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014. The University is to be named after Sammakka-Sarakka, revered by the local tribal community.\n\nSammakka-Sarakka Jatara:\n\nAs per the legends, Sammakka was married to a feudal chief of the Kakatiyas dynasty (ruled over the Warangal region). Sarakka/Saralamma was the daughter of Sammakka.\n\nKakatiya dynasty ruler, Prataprudra imposed taxes on the Koya tribe and later declared battle on the tribe when the chief was not able to pay the taxes.\n\nThe Sammakka Sarakka Jathara/Medaram Jathara, a biennial festival is celebrated to commemorate this battle of the 13th-century, in which the mother-daughter duo participated against the local rulers in protest against the imposition of taxes.\n\nSammakka and Sarakka are worshipped as the protector of Koya tribe.\n\nThe festival shows no Vedic or Brahmanic influence.\n\nThe ritual of the festival includes taking holy dip in Jampanna Vagu (a stream), a tributary of River Godavari.\n\nFrom Medaram, the Jathara begins and priests belonging to Koya tribe perform the rituals. Medaram is situated in the Eturnagaram Wildlife Sanctuary, a part of Dandakaranya forest.\n\nVarious tribal and non-tribal communities participate in the festival, from Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chattishgarh, Odisha, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Jharkhand.\n\nIt is the second largest fair of India, and is often referred to as the Kumbh Mela of the tribals.\n\nThe festival is declared a state festival by the Telangana government.\n\nWhat are Nanoparticles?\n\nContext: A recent study shows that in urban environments, ultrafine particles of 1 to 100 nanometers, can contribute up to 90% to the total particle number concentration. Largely originating from vehicle emissions, the nanoparticles can move from the respiratory system to other parts of the human body which has the potential to cause more chronic and acute illnesses.\n\nOrigin of nanoparticles\n\nNanoparticles occur naturally in the environment but the major nanoparticle pollutants arise due to Anthropogenic emissions.\n\nNatural pollutants:\n\nSea emits aerosol of salt that ends up floating around in the atmosphere.\n\nSmoke from volcanoes and fires contains a huge variety of nanoparticles.\n\nDust from deserts.\n\nTrees emit nanoparticles of hydrocarbon compounds such as terpenes (which produce blue haze seen in forests).\n\nAnthropogenic pollutants:\n\nMajorly emitted by large industrial processes, power stations, jet aircraft, vehicles (powered by internal combustion engines) and household fuels.\n\nTypes of nanoparticles emitted include- partially burned hydrocarbons (in soot), ceria (cerium oxide; from vehicle exhaust catalysts), metallic dust (from brake linings), calcium carbonate (in engine lubricating oils), and silica (from car tires).\n\nConcentration of NPs can be influenced by Meteorology and other factors.\n\nWith the rise in relative humidity, coagulation of these particles results in their concentration becoming high.\n\nHigher wind speed can result in the dispersion of these particles.\n\nGeneral facts about Nanoparticles:\n\nNanoparticles are extremely small particles that are sized between 1 and 100 nanometers.\n\nSize: A nanometer is one billionth of a metre. The small size allows nanoparticles to have unique properties compared to larger particles.\n\nProperties: Nanoparticles have unique optical, electrical, magnetic, chemical, mechanical, thermal, and quantum properties compared to bulk materials. Their high surface area-to-volume ratio also results in enhanced reactivity, solubility, and heat transfer.\n\nKey examples include:\n\nIron oxide nanoparticles are superparamagnetic for data storage, while cobalt has high coercivity.\n\nNanoparticles make good catalysts due to their high surface reactivity.\n\nMechanical strength increases for nanoparticles of metals like Aluminium.\n\nCeramic nanoparticles strengthen composites.\n\nQuantum effects dominate at the nanoscale.\n\nMetal nanoparticles like gold and silver have vivid colours due to localised surface plasmon resonance.\n\nSemiconductor quantum dots have tunable conductivity and fluorescence.\n\nApplication of Nanoparticles:\n\nMedicine & Healthcare - Drug delivery, bioimaging, diagnostics, dental care, sunscreens, antimicrobial coatings.\n\nElectronics - Nanoelectronics, sensors, data storage devices, quantum dot displays.\n\nEnergy - Solar cells, lithium-ion batteries, fuel additives, hydrogen generation and storage.\n\nEnvironment - Pollutant degradation, water treatment, nano-filtration, catalytic converters.\n\nAgriculture - Pesticides, fertilizers, pathogen detection, encapsulated agrochemicals.\n\nFood & Packaging - Antimicrobial films, improved barrier properties, moisture control, and thermal stability.\n\nCosmetics - UV protection in sunscreens, long-lasting colour pigments, anti-ageing creams.\n\nTextiles - Stain and wrinkle-resistant fabrics, lightweight protective clothing, moisture wicking.\n\nPaints & Coatings - Anti-corrosive coatings, thermal barrier coatings, anti-fouling paints.\n\nAutomotive - Fuel cells, lighter and stronger materials, advanced lubricants.\n\nAerospace - Lighter and stronger composites, structural health monitoring.\n\nDefence - Lightweight soldier armour, surveillance, sensors, nanocoatings for equipment.\n\nConcerns are associated with Nanoparticles:\n\nRespiratory effects - Inhaled nanoparticles can deposit in lungs, causing inflammation, fibrosis, asthma, and lesions. Links to lung cancer have also been reported.\n\nCardiovascular toxicity - Nanoparticles like PM2.5 can enter bloodstream and damage blood vessels and heart tissue, leading to thrombosis, arrhythmia and myo-cardiac cell death.\n\nSkin penetration - Nanoparticles in cosmetics and sunscreens may be absorbed through skin, entering bloodstream. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles caused DNA damage in mice's skin.\n\nBioaccumulation up food chain - Nanoparticles concentrate in algae/plankton, get absorbed by fish/animals which are later consumed by humans, leading to biomagnification.\n\nWater contamination - Release of nanoparticles into rivers, lakes and groundwater from product waste. Can be toxic to aquatic life. Difficult to filter out nanoparticles.\n\nSoil pollution - Accumulation in sewage sludge applied as fertilizer. Runoff from landfills. Alters microbial communities in soil.\n\nAir pollution - Nanoparticle emissions into the air, leading to reduced air quality.\n\nNobel Prize for Chemistry 2023\n\nContext: The 2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to Alexei Ekimov, Louis Brus, and Moungi Bawendi for their work on quantum dots.\n\nBasic background:\n\nFundamental facts of Chemistry:\n\nEvery element exhibits specific properties determined by the number of electrons in its atoms and the distribution of these electrons around the nucleus.\n\nSo, every piece of a pure element exhibits the same properties regardless of its size.\n\nE.g., Pure gold has properties different from silver or any other element. Also, a large 100-gram piece of Gold will have exact properties like a small 10-milligram piece.\n\nPeculiar behaviour at Nanoscale:\n\nParticles in the nanoscale range behave slightly differently from larger particles of the same element. E.g., A nanoparticle of gold (sizes in the range of 1 to 100 billionth of a metre) displays properties different in some respects from larger particles of gold.\n\nReasons for deviation: This is because when the size of the particles is reduced to the nanoscale, electrons in the atoms find themselves squeezed or constrained in a small space giving rise to quantum effects.\n\nThe Nobel-winning research:\n\nThe scientists were independently successful in developing efficient methods to produce nano-sized particles that behaved slightly differently than larger particles of the same element. These nanoparticles with special properties were called quantum dots.\n\nQuantum dots:\n\nQuantum dots are tiny particles or nanocrystals of semiconducting material with a diameter in the range of 2–10 nm (10–50 atoms).\n\nQDs are nanosized in all three dimensions and are made from a semiconductor such as Silicon.\n\nThey behave like artificial atoms, as they can have a fixed number of electrons in a confined space, leading to unique properties that are size-dependent.\n\nQDs exhibit special properties when they interact with light.\n\nIn general, the colour of any material depends on the wavelengths of the light spectrum absorbed or reflected by the material.\n\nHowever, quantum dots made from the same material will re-emit/give out different colours of light depending on their size. The biggest quantum dots produce the longest wavelengths (and lowest frequencies), while the smallest dots make shorter wavelengths (and higher frequencies).\n\nApplications:\n\nBioimaging: QDs are considered to be superior to traditional organic dyes and can be used in bioimaging.\n\nQDs are 20 times brighter and 100 times more stable than traditional fluorescent dyes.\n\nUnlike organic dyes, which operate over a limited range of colours and degrade relatively quickly, quantum dyes are very bright, can be made to produce any colour of visible light, and last indefinitely as they are photostable.\n\nBio-sensors: QD sensors can detect the presence of pathogens in food or water, or monitor the levels of pollutants in the environment.\n\nTargeted Cancer treatment:\n\nQDs exhibit specific optoelectronic properties. They can be used for fluorescence imaging where quantum dots are injected into the body, which when encounters a cancer cell, attaches to it. When a light of a certain frequency is shined, QD lights up and doctors can exactly target these cells.\n\nQDs can be targeted at single organs much more precisely than conventional drugs, reducing the side effects characteristic of untargeted, traditional chemotherapy.\n\nBecause of their nano size; they possess a large surface area ensuring higher drug loading capacity and can tag the nanocarriers in biological systems.\n\nOptical applications:\n\nDue to their unique optical properties, QDs could be used to make smaller and more efficient image sensors like CMOS sensors.\n\nQDs can be used in computer screens and displays due to their important advantages:\n\nQLEDs are capable of emitting all colours depending on their size. Thus, they provide high-definition, brighter and more colourful displays. Quantum dots are brighter than organic LEDs (OLEDs).\n\nQDs produce light themselves and need no backlight which makes them energy efficient.\n\nPhotovoltaic devices: QDs have the potential to boost the efficiency of silicon photovoltaic cells.\n\nPhotonics: QDs are best suited for photonics-based computing capable of achieving high speeds.\n\nCDSCO Report Uncovers Alarming Levels of Contaminants in Indian Cough Syrups\n\nContext: According to a report released by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), the nation's top drug regulator, at least five batches of cough and allergic rhinitis syrups from two Indian manufacturers have been found to contain higher than permissible levels of contaminants - diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol.\n\nAbout Ethylene glycol and Di Ethylene Glycol (DEG)\n\nEthylene glycol and Di Ethylene Glycol (DEG) are colourless, odourless, sweetish-tasting substances that are mostly used for industrial purposes ranging from antifreeze formulations to brake fluids, paints, plastics etc. The pharmaceutical grade can be used for medicines and consumer products in the quantity that is recommended.\n\nNote: According to the WHO, the accepted safety level for ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol is no more than 0.10%.\n\n** The two contaminants are known to be toxic in humans and can cause abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, inability to pass urine, and acute kidney injury that may result in death especially in children.\n\nAbout Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation(CDSCO)\n\nEstablished: 2005\n\nWork under: Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India.\n\nHeadquarter: New Delhi\n\nFunctions:\n\nIt is assigned duties under Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.\n\nUnder the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, CDSCO is responsible for approval of Drugs, Conduct of Clinical Trials, laying down the standards for Drugs, control over the quality of imported Drugs in the country and coordination of the activities of State Drug Control Organizations by providing expert advice with a view of bring about the uniformity in the enforcement of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.\n\nFurther CDSCO along with state regulators, is jointly responsible for grant of licenses of certain specialized categories of critical Drugs such as blood and blood products, I. V. Fluids, Vaccine and Sera.\n\nNote: The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) is a government regulatory agency that controls the prices of pharmaceutical drugs in India.\n\nNobel Prize in Physics for Attosecond Physics\n\nContext: The Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the Nobel Prize winners in Physics for 2023 for experimental methods that generate attosecond pulses of light for the study of electron dynamics in matter.\n\nNobel Prize in Physics:\n\nFrance’s Pierre Agostini, Hungarian-Austrian Ferenc Krausz and French-Swedish Anne L’Huillier won the Nobel Prize in physics for experimental methods that generate pulses of light measured in the attosecond (10-18 seconds) that enable the study of electrons inside atoms and molecules using attosecond spectroscopy.\n\nElectron movements in atoms and molecules are so rapid that they are measured in attoseconds. An attosecond is to one second as one second is to the age of the universe.\n\nBasic background:\n\nAnalogy: In our everyday lives, we are unable to observe the processes completely that happen fast. For example, when a bullet is fired at an apple, we see the outcome — a smashed apple — but are unable to capture the entire process which takes barely a few milliseconds. However, a camera having a very high shutter speed makes it possible to see every step of the bullet piercing the apple and coming out of it, destroying the apple in the process.\n\nDynamics at Atomic scale: At atomic and subatomic levels, processes (movement of electrons, or energy dynamics) happen at an incredibly fast rate, i.e., they take just a few picoseconds (a trillionth of a second, or 10-12 seconds) or femtoseconds (10-15 seconds). To observe these processes, scientists use unimaginably short pulses of light, like using extremely high shutter-speed cameras. But then they hit a barrier.\n\nExisting challenges at sub-atomic scale:\n\nTo observe any process, measurement must be made at a pace quicker than the rate of change.\n\nLight pulses which are the only plausible tool to capture processes at the atomic level cannot be made indefinitely shorter.\n\nLight consists of waves or vibrations in an electromagnetic field. The shortest possible pulse would have to be at least one cycle long, equivalent to its wavelength.\n\nAttoseconds science:\n\nFemtosecond pulses have enabled scientists to observe the processes happening at the atomic or molecular level.\n\nBut at the sub-atomic level, dynamics of sub-atomic particles happen even faster, at the level of attoseconds. Ex. Dynamics of electrons are 100 to 1,000 times faster than that of an atom. (Lower the inertia, faster the dynamics).\n\nThese femtosecond pulses were longer than the sub-atomic motion that was happening in a matter of attoseconds and the production of shorter pulses of light, in the attosecond range, did not seem possible.\n\nSo, Scientists were unable to glimpse the motion of electrons with existing technologies, as for a long time, femtosecond ‘photography’ was considered the limit.\n\nNobel-winning research:\n\nThe works of Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz and Anne L’Huillier made it possible to observe phenomena happening at the timescale of Attoseconds as they demonstrated a way to create extremely short pulses of light that can be used to measure the rapid processes at which electrons operate.\n\nWorking independently, the scientists devised experimental methods by mixing lights of different wavelengths to produce attosecond pulses of light which can enable the exploration of electron-dynamics in matter.\n\nThe observation of every step of a process is necessary to fully understand it.\n\nIt has made it possible to examine the rapid moves or changes in sub-atomic scales and allows scientists to control the process by tweaking the intermediate steps and obtaining desired results.\n\nPotential Applications:\n\nAttosecond science has potential applications in a variety of areas, from electronics to medicine, across disciplines in physics, chemistry and biology.\n\nIn Electronics:\n\nHelp to measure the time it takes for an electron to be tugged away from an atom and to examine how the time this takes depends on how tightly the electron is bound to the atom’s nucleus.\n\nReconstruct how the distribution of electrons oscillates from side to side in molecules and materials, earlier the distribution of electrons could only be measured as an average.\n\nTest internal processes of matter and identify different events.\n\nAttosecond physics can enable us to understand and control how electrons behave in a material.\n\nHelp in designing more efficient electronic gadgets.\n\nIn Medicine:\n\nAttosecond pulses can be used to identify different molecules, such as in medical diagnostics. Study molecular-level changes in blood to identify diseases.\n\nKrausz group has developed a new in vitro diagnostic analytical technique to detect characteristic molecular traces of diseases in blood samples. This technique allows monitoring of many molecules at the same time and the radiation is non-ionising and therefore not harmful.\n\nUMMEED: Comprehensive School Plan for Suicide Prevention\n\nContext: The Ministry of Education released draft guidelines known as UMMEED (Understand, Motivate, Manage, Empathise, Empower, Develop), for schools to prevent suicide among students.\n\nReason for increasing cases of suicides among students\n\nSuicide is a complex interplay of personal and social factors, which is rarely caused by a single circumstance or event. It has an impact on the family, school and community at large.\n\nStudents go through many transitions during their school life which can cause extreme stress, for example, transition from home to school, from one school to another, school to college, losing a parent/sibling/friend/near and dear one, etc.\n\nAlso experience changes as they progress through the developmental stages, leading to concerns such as those related to physical changes and appearance, peer pressure, career decisions, academic pressure, and pressuring students into preparing for competitive examinations.\n\nNegative school environment like negative relationships with peers/teachers, discrimination, bullying, harassment, humiliation, isolation, etc.\n\nAbsence of school-family connects, parental neglect/ abuse, lack of acceptance/recognition by family members, family history of suicide, Criticism/ bullying by family members .\n\nWarning Signs of Students at Risk\n\nFeelings: Hopelessness, guilt, shame, self-hatred, exhaustion persistent sadness among students.\n\nBehaviours: Withdrawal from Social Interactions, friends, classmates, and family, lack of concentration such as being absent-minded, forgetful, and/or restlessness in class, sudden, mood changes, change in appetite/sleeping patterns.\n\nActions: Lack of Participation, losing interest in previously enjoyed school activities, being careless about safety, use of substances (smoking, alcohol, etc.), decline in overall quality of academic and other school work and becoming detached.\n\nAbout UMMEED\n\nTo serve as directions to schools for enhancing sensitivity, and understanding, and providing support in case of reported self-harm.\n\nGuidelines have been issued under the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020, which aims for holistic education, encompassing cognitive and emotional development.\n\nTaking proactive steps to identify students exhibiting warning signs and thereby at risk for self-harm, creating a dedicated team in school, promoting a supportive school environment, and building the capacity of the stakeholders\n\nPlan of action for schools\n\nSetting up of School Wellness Team (SWT): This may be formed under the leadership of the School Principal, where each member of SWT is oriented in handling crises.\n\nWhen a student displaying warning signs has been identified by any stakeholder, they need to be reported to the SWT, which takes immediate action.\n\nIt plays an important role in the implementation of school activities directed towards creating awareness about mental well-being, leading to suicide prevention.\n\nIt is important for the school to review the effectiveness of SWT and its functioning on an annual basis.\n\nPromoting a positive school environment: To be prepared to respond to a crisis, it is also important to promote and strengthen the protective factors and reduce the risk factors.\n\nIt plays a pivotal role in supporting student well-being and reducing the risk of suicide. Raising awareness about mental health is an integral part of it.\n\nIt promotes open dialogue, which can reduce the stigma associated with seeking help and encourage students to reach out for support without fear of judgment or isolation.\n\nActions for promoting a positive school environment:\n\nEncouraging peer support: Through group activities, clubs, events, etc.\n\nOrganising activities regularly for relaxing/reducing stress: Like yoga, meditation, art, music, etc.\n\nProviding channels for expression: Such as access to a trained counsellor, help boxes, or suggestions boxes to express concerns and seek help.\n\nCompiling resources to seek support: Helpline numbers, phone numbers and email IDs of Counsellors and SWT members, brochures and pamphlets on causes, risk factors, protective factors, warning signs, etc.\n\nIntegrating Mental Well-being in School Functioning: Including aspects of mental well-being in daily interactions, open discussions, assembly time, different programmes, subject-teaching, etc.)\n\nCreating a Safe Environment in School and Beyond: In school: Locking empty classrooms, lighting up dark corridors, cleaning gardens and areas with excess growth of grass and places beyond school: vigilance at railway tracks, river banks, bridges, cliffs, medical shops, etc.\n\nEncouraging School-Community Partnerships: Among all stakeholders: school administrators, teachers, counsellors, students, medical staff, supporting staff, parents, and community.\n\nBuilding Awareness about Mental Well-being among all Stakeholders: Through Role plays, Storytelling, Nukkad natak, Rallies, Posters, Exhibitions, Annual Day themes, etc.)\n\nBuilding capacity for different stakeholders to prevent suicides and respond to crises in schools, it is crucial to empower all stakeholders, including teachers, staff, students, and families.\n\nResponding immediately and supporting students at risk: Immediate action is required in both situations of at-risk behaviours, i.e., when the student is displaying warning signs and attempting self-harm through maintaining records of at-risk behaviours of a student and follow-up on the student and SWT members need to connect with parents after the incident to follow up on the student.\n\nThey divided warning signs into three categories– feelings, behaviour and actions.\n\nStudents who exhibit feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, worthlessness, guilt and shame, or have a lack of concentration, withdrawal from social interactions and sudden mood swings are at risk.\n\nThey also place students with reckless behaviour, talking about self-harm or ending life and becoming detached, among others, as those displaying warning signs.\n\nAppraisal of actions taken by the school: Schools should conduct regular assessments to reflect on their suicide prevention efforts. SWT and other stakeholders should meet periodically to discuss their experiences in implementing guidelines and analyse feedback for areas needing improvement.\n\nPest outbreak threatens Cotton Crop\n\nContext: The Pink Bollworm pest has infected the Cotton Crop in the states of Haryana and Rajasthan.\n\nPink Bollworm\n\nPink Bollworm is considered possibly the most destructive pest on cotton worldwide.\n\nIt is native to India but is now found in nearly all the cotton-growing countries of the globe.\n\nDescription: The larvae have distinctive pink bands, and the larval stage, is the most destructive and identifiable stage. The adults are small moths about 3/8 inch long.\n\nThreat:\n\nAdults lay eggs on cotton bolls; once hatched, the larvae burrow into the developing fruits (bolls) of cotton plants, eat the seeds and damage the fibres of the cotton.\n\nThe damage affects both the weight and quality of the harvested bolls containing the lint fibre and seeds inside, thus, reducing both the yield and quality.\n\nWhen the larvae mature, they cut out the boll and drop to the ground and cocoon near the soil surface.\n\nThe larvae can also survive in the seed after the ginning process and if the seed is not fumigated, they will emerge from the stored seed the next spring.\n\nApart from cotton, they can also attack hibiscus and okra.\n\nWhat’s the issue?\n\nThe Pink Bollworm (PBW) infestation has been common in the cotton belt of northern Rajasthan, Haryana and Southwestern Punjab since 2021. However, the damage reported is much more widespread and serious in 2023.\n\nThe Bt cotton – which incorporates genes from a soil bacterium that codes for proteins toxic to the American bollworm – has lost its efficacy against the Pink Bollworm.\n\nThe pink bollworm infestation is higher this year because of early rains making it conducive for the worms to grow and fester.\n\nBt Cotton:\n\nBt cotton is a genetically modified pest-resistant plant cotton variety modified by the insertion of one or more genes (Cry1 Ac) from the soil bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis.\n\nStrains of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis produce toxins that are harmful to a variety of insects and it has been found to combat American bollworm – moth larvae that commonly attack cotton crops.\n\nBt cotton is India's first transgenic crop formally approved for commercial cultivation in 2002.\n\nAim of introducing Bt cotton to India was to reduce the amount of insecticide needed in farming cotton.\n\nBenefits: Reduction in production cost, increase in profit, reduced farming risk and improved economic outlook for cotton, does not harm non-target beneficial insects, helpful in improving wildlife population, reduced run-off of insecticides and air pollution.\n\nBhagat Singh’s Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam\n\nContext: On the occasion of Bhagat Singh's birth anniversary on September 28th, it is pertinent to delve into his perspective on the theme of India's G20 presidency, \"Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.\" This theme reflects the idea that the world is one family, and it carries significant relevance in the context of India's global leadership role within the G20.\n\nMore about the news:\n\nThe success of India in garnering consensus in the joint declaration of the G20 was seen as a pivotal moment in the country's ascendancy on the global stage.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi celebrated this achievement, emphasizing that India's vision was not merely a slogan but a comprehensive philosophy deeply rooted in its cultural heritage.\n\nHe highlighted that the world was taking note of India's human-centric model of development, one that prioritizes inclusivity both domestically and internationally.\n\nThe G20 declaration explicitly expressed concern about religious hatred and called for an end to the trust deficit, advocating for an era of cooperation.\n\nBhagat Singh's views on the concept of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’:\n\nIn his early years, Bhagat Singh was captivated by the concept of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, envisioning a world united as one family bound by love and mutual respect.\n\nHis essay 'Vishwa Prem,' published in the Hindi weekly ‘Matwala’ in 1924, reflects his contemplation on the social and political hurdles obstructing the realization of this dream.\n\nBhagat Singh posed a thought-provoking question and grappled with various complex issues, including communalism, hatred, violence, oppression, poverty, untouchability, and casteism.\n\nHe highlighted the disturbing reality that mere religious affiliation had become a sufficient reason for enmity between religious groups.\n\nBhagat Singh firmly advocated for the elimination of divisive elements, such as the distinction between the touchable and untouchable communities.\n\nIn his influential essay 'Why I am an Atheist,' Bhagat Singh showcased his rational and critical thinking.\n\nHe suspected that some self-proclaimed social reformers held superficial political stances.\n\nHe didn't hesitate to criticise prominent figures like Madan Mohan Malviya, questioning their sincerity in eradicating untouchability.\n\nHe asked whether those who loudly proclaimed universal brotherhood genuinely aimed to bring about such a transformation.\n\nAbout Bhagat Singh:\n\nBhagat Singh, a prominent figure in India's struggle for independence, played a crucial role in the fight against British colonial rule. His early life, evolution as a revolutionary, and lasting legacy are all integral parts of his story.\n\nBhagat Singh's Birth and Education:\n\nBorn on September 28, 1907, in Lyallpur, which is now in Pakistan, Bhagat Singh's upbringing was steeped in the atmosphere of patriotic fervour.\n\nHe received his education at the Dayanand Anglo Vedic High School and National College in Lahore.\n\nThese institutions were closely associated with Arya Samaj and the freedom movement, exposing Bhagat Singh to the ideals of Indian independence from a young age.\n\nFamily Influence on His Ideals:\n\nBhagat Singh's family played a pivotal role in shaping his political consciousness.\n\nHis father and uncle, Ajit Singh, were actively involved in progressive politics, participating in significant events like the Canal Colonization Bill agitation in 1907 and the Ghadar Movement of 1914–1915.\n\nEntry into National College and Ideological Shift:\n\nIn 1923, Bhagat Singh enrolled at the National College in Lahore, which had been established as a response to Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation movement.\n\nGandhi had urged Indian students to boycott educational institutions subsidized by the British government.\n\nBhagat Singh's journey into the freedom movement began to take a more radical turn during this time.\n\nBhagat Singh's contributions to the Freedom Movement:\n\nInitial Support for Non-Cooperation:\n\nInitially, Bhagat Singh aligned himself with Mahatma Gandhi and the Non-Cooperation Movement.\n\nHowever, his perspective shifted when Gandhi withdrew the movement following the Chauri Chaura incident.\n\nThis incident led Bhagat Singh to embrace revolutionary nationalism as a means to achieve India's independence.\n\nInfluence of Tragic Events:\n\nTragic events such as the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919 and the violence against unarmed Akali protestors at Nankana Sahib in 1921 deeply affected Bhagat Singh's worldview, fuelling his determination to free India from British rule.\n\nAssociation with Revolutionary Groups:\n\nIn 1924, Bhagat Singh became a member of the Hindustan Republican Association, founded by Sachindranath Sanyal.\n\nHe formed a close bond with Chandra Shekhar Azad, the main organizer of the association.\n\nBhagat Singh's commitment to the cause led him to establish the Naujawan Bharat Sabha in 1926, aiming to mobilize peasants and workers against British rule.\n\nRole in \"Kirti\" and HSRA:\n\nBhagat Singh also contributed to the monthly magazine \"Kirti\" published by the 'Workers and Peasants Party.' For a year, he served on the editorial board of \"Kirti.\"\n\nIn 1928, he, along with Sukhdev, Chandrashekhar Azad, and others, founded the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA).\n\nBhagat Singh's Revolutionary Activities:\n\nShift Towards Armed Revolution:\n\nBhagat Singh's association with HSRA introduced him to the philosophy of armed revolution.\n\nHis commitment to the cause led to his arrest in 1927, initially for his association with the Kakori Case and an article published under the pseudonym Vidrohi.\n\nInvolvement in the Saunders Case:\n\nThe tragic death of Lala Lajpat Rai during a protest against the Simon Commission in 1928 marked a turning point.\n\nIn an unfortunate case of mistaken identity, Bhagat Singh and his associates assassinated J.P. Saunders, leading to the Lahore Conspiracy Case.\n\nCentral Assembly Bombing:\n\nIn 1929, Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt threw a bomb in the Central Assembly at Delhi, accompanied by pro-revolutionary slogans.\n\nTheir intention was not to cause harm but to make the ‘deaf hear’. Both were arrested without resistance, using the trial as a platform for their revolutionary message.\n\nThe Trial and Death of Bhagat Singh:\n\nHunger Strike for Political Prisoners:\n\nDuring their trial in 1929, Bhagat Singh and his comrades initiated a hunger strike in Lahore prison to demand better conditions for political prisoners.\n\nTheir strike garnered widespread support from leaders, including Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nSentencing and Execution:\n\nDespite widespread appeals, Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru were sentenced to death.\n\nThe execution was carried out on March 23, 1931, a day ahead of the scheduled date, at Lahore Jail.\n\nMarch 23 is observed as Martyrs' Day, paying tribute to him and fellow freedom fighters.\n\nIndividual Heroism vs. Mass Movement\n\nBhagat Singh initially believed in individual heroism but later realized the need for a broad-based mass movement to effectively challenge the British Empire.\n\nRenowned quotes by Bhagat Singh:\n\nBombs and pistols do not make a revolution. The sword of revolution is sharpened on the whetting stone of ideas.\n\nBut mere faith and blind faith is dangerous: it dulls the brain and makes a man reactionary.\n\nRevolution is an inalienable right of mankind. Freedom is an imperishable birthright of all. Labour is the real sustainer of society.\n\nWorks of Bhagat Singh: ‘Why I Am an Atheist’; ‘Ideas on freedom, liberty and revolution: Jail notes of a revolutionary’; ‘Ideas of a Nation’; ‘To Young Political Workers."
