It consisted of many janapadas like Maharashtra, Mahiṣaka, Aśmaka, Vidarbha, Kuntala, Śūrpāraka, Krathakaiśika, Kānchi, Kerala, Kāvera, Murala, Vānavāsaka, Simhala, Chola, Dandaka, Pāndya, Pallava, Gānga, Nāsikya, Konkaṇa, Kollagiri and Vallāra, to name the prominent ones. The modern Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh states consist of Maharashtra, Vidarbha, Krathakaiśika, Dandaka, Śūrpāraka, Nāsikya and Konkaṇa janapadas and Karnataka state consists of Kuntala, Vānavāsaka, Murala, Mahiṣaka (Mysore) and Gānga Janapadas. Telangana and Andhra Pradesh were part of Aśmaka janapada. Kerala state consists of Kollagiri and Kerala janapadas. Tamilnadu comprises Kānchi, Pallava, Chola, Pāndya and Vallāra (Velir) janapadas. The chronological history of Tamilnadu, Kerala, Kaliṅga and Telangana & Andhra Pradesh will be discussed threadbare in upcoming chapters. We will discuss primarily the chronological history of Maharashtra and Karnataka in this chapter. Seemingly, Vidarbha, Śūrpāraka, Kuntala and Mahiṣaka janapadas existed since Rigvedic era. Rigvedic Rishi Agastya’s wife Lopāmudrā was the daughter of a Vidarbha king. Chandrahāsa was the king of Kuntala and a contemporary of Devakiputra Krishna as indicated in Jaiminiya Aśvamedha. Paraśurāma came to Śūrpāraka region in the Vedic era. Mahiṣāsura was the king of Mahiṣa mandala (Mysore). The central Karnataka was known as Kishkindha during the Rāmāyaṇa era. Mahābhārata refers to Kuntala, Vanavāsi, Mahiṣaka, Konkaṇa, Śūrpāraka and Vidarbha kingdoms. Sahadeva subjugated the king of Śūrpāraka,\n\n2 | The Chronology of India : From Mahabharata to Medieval Era\n\nking of Kishkindha, Vānara kings Mainda and Dwivida and king of Talavanapura during the Rājasūya Yajna. After Mahābhārata war, the cities of Pratiṣṭhāna and Vanavāsi emerged as coveted political capitals of Kuntala kingdom. Undoubtedly, Kuntala janapada was extended up to Pratiṣṭhāna during ancient times. Rajaśekhara’s Viddhaśālabhañjikā relates the story of Kuntala King Chanḍa-Mahāsena alias Virapāla and his daughter Kuvalayamālā who was a contemporary of Kalachuri or Chedi King Vidyādharamalla alias Karpūravarṣa and Lāta King Chandra Varmā. Seemingly, Kuntala King Chanḍa-Mahāsena might have flourished around 2500 BCE. Soḍhala’s Udayasundarīkathā relates the story of King Malayavāhana of Kuntala, whose capital was Pratiṣṭhāna. He was the contemporary of Nāga King Śikhanḍatilaka, father of Udayasundarī. According to Guṇāḍhya’s Brihatkathā and Someśvara’s Kathāsaritsāgara, King Dīpakarṇi was ruling in Pratiṣṭhāna. He found an abandoned child close to the den of a lion and adopted him. Probably, Śāta was a synonym for lion in a Prakrit dialect. Thus, the child came to be known as “Śātavāhana”. King Dīpakarṇi placed his adopted son Śātavāhana on the throne of Pratiṣṭhāna. Thus, the Śātavāhana dynasty came into existence around 2500 BCE. Kathāsaritsāgara mentions that King Śūdraka I (2300-2200 BCE) gave Karṇāta kingdom to Vīravara and his son Sattvavara. One Śātavāhana king was the contemporary of Guṇāḍhya, the author of Brihatkathā and Śarvavarmā, the author of Kātantra Vyākarana around 2200-2100 BCE. One of the pillar inscriptions of King Aśoka I (1765-1737 BCE) has reference to the Śātavāhanas. Seemingly, Mahāpadma Nanda annexed the kingdom of Śātavāhanas and also the Aśmaka kingdom around 1650 BCE. Therefore, the Śātavāhanas migrated to Telangana region and became the vassals of Andhra kings (Andhrabhrityas). A branch of Śātavāhanas known as Chutu Śātakarṇis established their kingdom in Vanavāsi roughly around 1400-1300 BCE. Vātsyāyana’s Kāmasutra (1000 BCE) mentions a Śātakarṇi king of Kuntala. Some coins found in Karwar region refer to Chutu Śātakarṇi kings Chutukulānanda, Mulananda and Śivananda. The Nāgārjunakonda inscription of the Abhira King Vasuṣeṇa refers to King\n\nThe Dakśiṇāpatha Kingdoms | 3\n\nVishnurudraśivalānanda Śātakarṇi of the city of Vanavāsa (Vanavāsakena ca Vishnurudraśivalānanda Śātakarṇinā…).1 The Chutu Śātakarṇis reigned over Vanavāsi of Kuntala till the rise of Kadaṁba dynasty around 500 BCE. King Simuka of the Śātavāhana dynasty (826-803 BCE) re-established his kingdom in Pratiṣṭhāna but also extended up to Magadha. The rise of Vikramāditya I (719-659 BCE) and Śālivāhana (659-630 BCE) led to the decline of the Śātavāhanas in Pratiṣṭhāna but Gautamīputra Śātakarṇi (439-418 BCE) again re-established the power of Śātavāhanas for a short period. King Vindhyaśakti (385-365 BCE) founded the rule of Vākāṭaka dynasty in the 4th century BCE. The Vākāṭakas reigned over Vidarbha and Vatsagulma regions of Maharashtra around 385-150 BCE. The Kadaṁba Dynasty of Vanavāsi The Kadaṁba dynasty was founded by Mayūraśarman in the beginning of the 5th Century BCE. He was the descendant of a Vedic Brahmana family “Hārīti” and belonged to the “Mānavya” gotra. The rulers of this family were called Kadaṁbas as they would take special care of a “Kadaṁba” tree blossoming near their house. The Kadaṁbas were the rulers of the Kuntala region (North-west of Karṇātaka) and Vanavāsi (also called as Vaijayantī) was their capital. The Talagunda (Sthānakundura) pillar inscription2 narrates the history of the Kadaṁba dynasty. “Once Mayūraśarman, along with his teacher Viraśarman went to the capital of the Pallavas (Kāñchipuram) in order to complete his Vedic studies. There he had a fierce quarrel with a Pallava official, who was riding a horse (tatra Pallavāśva-saṁsthena kalabhena tīvreṇa roṣitaḥ). He was enraged by the helplessness of Brahmanas against Kśatriyas and decided to adopt the life of a Kśatriya. He overpowered the Pallava guards of the frontier and occupied the inaccessible forests around Śriparvata (Śriśailam in Kurnool District). He established himself as the powerful ruler of the area and also levied tribute on the Bāṇa King Bṛhad Bāṇa. The Pallavas sent an army to eliminate him but he inflicted heavy losses on them. Ultimately, the Pallavas accepted him as an ally and recognised him as the king of a territory between Amara Ocean (Western Ocean) and Premara country (unidentifiable, but very likely, an eastern landmark).”\n\n4 | The Chronology of India : From Mahabharata to Medieval Era\n\nThus, the Brahmana Mayūraśarman became a Kśatriya Mayūravarman and founded the kingdom of the Kadaṁba dynasty. Only the Candravalli inscription3 written in Mahārāṣtrī Prakrit belong to the reign of Mayūraśarman. He was succeeded by his son Kaṅgavarman. Bhagīratha, the son of Kaṅgavarman, had two sons, Raghu and Kākustha. The Halsi plates of Yuvarāja Kākusthavarman I4 are dated in the eightieth victorious year. Probably, the 80th year was counted from the commencement of Mayūravarman’s reign. Kākusthavarman I became a powerful ruler and married off his daughters to the royal families of the Guptas and other dynasties. It appears that he was a contemporary of Mādhavagupta and his son Ādityasena of the Krishnagupta dynasty (wrongly identified as the Later Guptas). The Shāhpur inscription of Ādityasena is dated in Śri Harsha era 66 (391 BCE) considering the epoch of Śri Harsha era in 457 BCE. Śāntivarman I was the son of Kākusthavarman I. Talagunda pillar inscription was written during the reign of Śāntivarman I. It is also recorded in the inscription that Kākusthavarman I constructed a great tank near a Śhiva temple of Sthānakundura at which, Śātakarṇi (probably, Chutu Śātakarṇi kings) and other kings had worshipped. The recently unearthed Gudnapur inscription5 tells us that Viraśarman was the grandfather of Mayūravarman. Mṛgeśavarman I was the son of Śāntivarman I who married the daughter of the king of Kekaya. Ravivarman I was the son of Mṛgeśa who killed the King Viṣṇudāsa (nihatya Viṣṇudāsam). This inscription also mentions the Nītiśāstra (Arthaśāstra) of Viṣṇugupta. Interestingly, this inscription is a grant to “Kāmadevālaya” and refers to “Madanotsava” (festival of love) during the season of Vasanta. “Kāmadevāyatana” in Mṛccḥakaṭikam of Sūdraka and “Kāmadevagṛha” in Kādambarī of Bāṇabhaṭṭa also indicate the existence of such social institutions. The Gudnapur inscription probably carries the earliest reference to “Kāmadevālaya”. The chronology of the Kadaṁbas up to Ravivarman I: Mayūraśarman Kaṅgavarman Bhagīratha\n\nŚaka era (583 BCE) 103-123 123-143 143-163\n\nIn CE 480-460 BCE 460-440 BCE 440-420 BCE\n\nThe Dakśiṇāpatha Kingdoms | 5\n\nRaghu Kākusthavarman I Śāntivarman I Mṛgeśavarman I Ravivarman I\n\n163-173 173-203 203-223 223-243 243-268\n\n420-410 BCE 410-380 BCE 380-360 BCE 360-340 BCE 340-315 BCE\n\nThe Ammānikā grant of Śāntivarman II6 tells us that Śarvavarman, who was born in the dynasty of Mayūraśarman, became the king and thereafter, his son Siṁhavarman I took over the reins. Śāntivarman II, the son of Siṁhavarman I, issued the Ammānikā grant in Śaka 232 (352351 BCE), that elapsed in his 7th regnal year (Dvātriṁśaduttara-dviśateṣu Śaka-varṣeṣvatīteṣu pravardhamāna-vijaya-rājya-saṁvatsare saptame varttamāne Vanavāsyām adhivasati vijayaskandhāvāre Śrāvaṇa-sitadvādaśyām). Thus, Śāntivarman II ascended the throne in Śaka 226 (358357 BCE). However, Historians rejected the Ammānikā grant because Śaka 232 cannot be accommodated in the distorted chronology of the Kadaṁbas. In fact, they are ignorant of the Śaka era that commenced in 583 BCE. Śarvavarman Siṁhavarman I Śāntivarman II\n\nŚaka era (583 BCE) 203-213 213-226 226-258\n\nIn CE 380-370 BCE 370-357 BCE 357-325 BCE\n\nThe subsequent grants of the Kadaṁbas tell us that another Kākusthavarman or Kākusthavarman II had two sons, Śāntivarman III & Krishnavarman I and also a daughter, who was married off to the Gaṅga King Mādhava II (304-259 BCE). Krishnavarman I became a powerful ruler in Dakśiṇāpatha and one of the most influential rulers of the Kadaṁbas. The Gaṅga King Avinīta (258-194 BCE) proudly recorded in his grants that he was the son of the beloved sister of Krishnavarman I. Krishnavarman I had two sons namely Viṣṇuvarman and Devavarman. According to the Bālāghāt plates,7 the Vākāṭaka King Narendrasena married Ajjhita Bhaṭṭārikā, a daughter of the lord of Kuntala. The lord of Kuntala referred to was very likely Viṣṇuvarman. In the Birur grant,8 Viṣṇuvarman tells us that Śāntivarman III was the elder brother of his father Krishnavarman I. Siṁhavarman II was the son of\n\n6 | The Chronology of India : From Mahabharata to Medieval Era\n\nViṣṇuvarman and Krishnavarman II was the son of Siṁhavarman II. The Bannahalli grant9 of Krishnavarman II was issued in his 7th regnal year and on the 5th tithi of Śukla pakśa of Kārttika month and Jyeṣṭha nakśatra. The Tagare grant10 tells us that Ajavarman was the son of Krishnavarman II, Bhogivarman was the son of Ajavarman and Viṣṇuvarman II was the son of Bhogivarman. Mṛgeśavarman was the eldest son of Śāntivarman III. Of the seven dated inscriptions of Mṛgeśavarman, three are dated in an old tradition that was in vogue till the first half of the 4th century BCE. The study of the inscriptions of Mṛgeśavarman reveals the following: Inscriptions of Mṛgeśavarman I (Genealogy not given): 1. 2nd Regnal year11 2. 4th Regnal year12 3. 6th Regnal year13 4. 7th Regnal year14\n\n10th day of fourth pakśa (fortnight) of Hemanta.

Moreover, the names of the engravers of the inscriptions also do not match. Thus, Mṛgeśavarman of inscriptions 1 to 4 was a different person, who flourished before the Mṛgeśavarman of inscriptions 5 to 7. Probably, Mṛgeśavarman I reigned around 360-340 BCE.\n\nThe Dakśiṇāpatha Kingdoms | 7\n\nIt appears that Śāntivarman III’s elder son Mṛgeśavarman II started ruling during the reign of his uncle Krishnavarman I. Ravivarman II, the son of Mṛgeśavarman II, ruled for more than 35 years. The Ajjibal-Sirsi plates18 of Ravivarman II are dated in his 35th regnal year. Harivarman was the son of Ravivarman II. The Sangoli grant19 of Harivarman was issued in his 8th regnal year and on the occasion of Sāyana Tulā saṅkrānti (viṣuva) and the new moon day of Āśvayuja month, which regularly corresponds to 16th Sep 141 BCE. The Halsi grant20 of Harivarman was issued in his 5th regnal year at the request of the Sendraka King Bhānuśakti. One grant of Nikumbhāllaśakti,21 the grandson of Bhānuśakti is dated in Kalachuri year 404 (0-1 CE). Therefore, the date of Bhānuśakti can be fixed around 14590 BCE. It may be noted here that the Kalachuri-Chedi era commenced in 402 BCE. Except the Ammānikā grant, none of the grants of the early Kadaṁbas refers to the Śaka era. Therefore, we have no other option but to derive the chronology of the Early Kadaṁbas based on the inputs mentioned above. The chronology of the Kadaṁbas given here is based entirely on the dates of Kākusthavarman’s 1st regnal year (80th year from Mayūraśarman), Śāntivarman I’s 7th regnal year (Śaka 232), the Gaṅga King Mādhava II (293-259 BCE), Avinīta (258-194 BCE) and the Sendraka King Bhānuśakti (145-90 BCE). Māndhātṛvarman,22 the son of Kumāravarman, also ruled for some time, and so did Madhuvarman23 and Dāmodara24 but more information Kākusthavarman II\n\nŚaka 268-303 (315-280 BCE) Śaka era In CE (583 BCE) Śantivarman III 303-353 280-230 BCE Mrgesavarman II 353-393 230-190 BCE Ravivarman I 393-434 190-149 BCE Harivarman 434-463 149-120 BCE\n\nKrishnavarman I Vishnuvarman I Simhavarman II Krishnavarman II Ajavarman Bhogivarman Visnuvarman II\n\nŚaka era (583 BCE) 323-353 353-378 378-401 402-423 423-448 448-468 468?\n\nIn CE 260-230 BCE 230-205 BCE 205-182 BCE 181-160 BCE 160-135 BCE 135-115 BCE 115?\n\n8 | The Chronology of India : From Mahabharata to Medieval Era\n\nis not available in the inscriptions. The early Chālukya King Kīrtivarman I invaded Vanavāsi in the second half of the 2nd century BCE, bringing the rule of the Kadaṁba dynasty came to an end. The Kadaṁbas could not reestablish themselves due to the rise of the early Chālukyas of Badami and subsequently the rise of the Rāṣṭrakūṭas. It appears that a branch of the later Kadaṁbas was ruling in Goa around the 11th century CE. Two grants of Jayakeśi I are dated in the Śaka era (583 BCE). The Panjim grant25 of Jayakeśi I was issued in Śakānta 981 (1059 CE) [Candra-vasu-graha-nimite śāke varṣe vikāriṇi prāpte, Āṣāḍha-kṛṣṇa-pakśe vāre śaśalakśmaṇas-tathāṣṭamyām ।]. Raya viragal26 of Jayakeśi I was written in Śaka 993 (1071 CE), Virodhikṛt saṁvatsara and on the 14th tithi of the dark fortnight of Jyeṣṭha month, Monday, on the occasion of Saṁkramaṇa. The date regularly corresponds to 30th Jun 1071 CE. The day was indeed Monday according to the epoch of Maya’s Sūrya Siddhānta, i.e., 22 Feb 6778 BCE, Sunday and the epoch of Śakānta era, i.e., 1 Apr 78 CE, Sunday (It was Thursday in Julian calendar). The Kaikeya Kings of Karnātaka A stone inscription from Anaji in the Davanagere Taluk of Chitradurga district refers to the Kekaya King Sivānandavarmā (Parama-Māheśvaraḥ … Ātreyagotraḥ Soma-vaṁśhodbhavaḥ Ikśvākubhirapi Rājarśibhiḥ kṛtāvāhavivāhānām Kekayānām kule Jātaḥ Sivānandavarmā…). Prabhāvatī, the queen of Kadamba King Mrigeśavarman and the mother of Ravivarman was born in the Kaikeya family. Seemingly, some royal families of Kekaya janapada had migrated to Karnataka during the period 1500-500 BCE when Yavanas, Kushanas and Śakas dominated over Kekaya janapada. The Bāṇa Dynasty Bāṇas were the one of the earliest rulers of Kolār region of Karṇātaka and some parts of Andhra Pradesh. They claimed to be descendants of King Bāṇa who was the son of Mahābali. They might have been connected with Mahābalipuram. Koṅgani Varman, the founder of the Gaṅga dynasty, had possibly conquered some parts of the Bāṇa kingdom in the 5th century BCE. Many inscriptions of the Bāṇa kings were found in the Kolār region.\n\nThe Dakśiṇāpatha Kingdoms | 9\n\nThe Mudyanur grant of the Bāṇa King Malladeva Nandivarmā tells us that after many Bāṇa kings had passed away, there was a king named Nandivarmā (400-375 BCE) whose grandson Malladeva Nandivarmā was ruling in Śaka 261 (322 BCE). Malladeva Nandivarmā, the son of Vijayāditya (375-344 BCE), issued the Mudyanur grant in his 23rd regnal year, which means he ascended the throne in Śaka 239 (344 BCE). The selected text from the Mudyanur Grant:27 “Ekaṣaṣṭṭuttara-dvaya-śate Śakābdaḥ Pravardhamānātmanaḥ trayo-viṁśati-vartamāna-Vilambi-saṁvatsare Kārttika-śukla-pakśe trayodaśyām Somavāre Aśvinyām nakśatre....”\n\nŚaka 261 (323-322 BCE) elapsed, Vilambi saṁvatsara, 23rd regnal year, 13th tithi of the bright fortnight of Kārttika month, Aśvinī nakśatra and Monday. This regularly corresponds to 18th Oct 322 BCE and the weekday was Monday (Thursday in Julian calendar). The year 322-321 BCE was Vilambi Saṁvatsara. Interestingly, the backside of the first plate of the Mudyanur grant is an erased Gaṅga grant. The genealogy of the Gaṅga kings is given up to the time of Harivarman on the erased side which also validates the date of the Mudyanur grant. The Gaṅga King Harivarman ruled around 415-365 BCE and the Mudyanur grant was issued in 322 BCE. Therefore, Malladeva Nandivarmā was a contemporary of the Gaṅga King Vishnugopa. JF Fleet and Kielhorn declared the Mudyanur grant as spurious because the Jovian year “Vilambi” and the weekday (Monday) given in the grant are not regular. Interestingly, JF Fleet accepted many epigraphs in which the given Jovian year or weekday is not regular. The inconsistency in his approach indicates that Fleet was not comfortable with the early Śaka year given in the Mudyanur grant. It is evident that Fleet applied different yardsticks for the epigraphs dated prior to the 6th century CE and the epigraphs dated from the 6th century onwards, clearly exposing his fraudulent slant in not accepting authentic and bonafide Indian epigraphs of antiquity. The Early Chālukyas of Badami Vātāpi or Badami (in Bagalkot district of Karṇātaka) was the capital of\n\n10 | The Chronology of India : From Mahabharata to Medieval Era\n\nthe early Chālukya dynasty. Ptolemy mentions Badami as “Badiamaioi” indicating that Badami was a place of some significance. Pulakeśin I, the founder of the Chālukya Empire in Vātāpi, according to the Altem or British Museum copper plates, was the grandson of Jayasiṁha and son of Raṇarāga. The Aihole inscription28 also gives a similar lineage of the Chālukyas. Pulakeśin I ruled from Śaka 411 (172 BCE) to Śaka 466 (117 BCE). Here is the selected text from the Altem or British Museum copper plates:29 “Śaka-nṛpābdeṣvekādaśottareṣu catuś-śateṣu vyatīteṣu Vibhavasaṁvatsare pravartamāne, Kṛte ca ye,Vaiśākhodita-pūrṇa-puṇyadivase rāho (hau) vidhau (vidhor) mandalam śliṣṭe.........”\n\n“411 years elapsed in Śaka era, in the Jovian year of Vibhava and on the occasion of lunar eclipse, on full moon day of Vaiśākha month and moon in Viśākhā nakśatra”. Considering 583 BCE as the epoch, Śaka 411th year, i.e., 173-172 BCE elapsed and 172-171 BCE current, the day of 19th Apr 172 BCE was the full moon day of Vaiśākha month and the moon was also in Viśākhā nakśatra. A penumbral lunar eclipse was visible at Badami starting at 19:44 hrs and ending at 21:32 hrs. If 78 CE had been the epoch, 1st May 489 CE was the full moon day of Vaiśākha month but no lunar eclipse was visible at Badami nor was the moon in Viśākhā nakśatra. Pulakeśin I was also known as “Vallabheśvara”. He constructed the fort in Badami in Śaka 465 elapsed as mentioned in a Badami inscription.30 Pulakeśin I had two sons; Kīrtivarman I and Mangalīśvara. Pulakeśin I was succeeded by his elder son Kīrtivarman I. According to Chālukya inscriptions, Kīrtivarman I defeated the rulers of Aṅga, Vaṅga, Kaliṅga, Gaṅga, Magadha, Madraka, Kerala, Kadaṁba etc. His younger brother Mangalīśvara succeeded him as the ruler of Badami in Śaka 489 (95 BCE). Here is the selected text from the Badami cave inscription of Mangalīśvara:31 “Pravardhamāna-rājya-saṁvatsare dvādaśe rājyābhiṣeka-saṁvatsareṣu-atikrānteṣu pañcasu Kārttika-paurṇamāsyām”\n\nŚaka-nṛpatiśateṣu mahā-\n\nThe Dakśiṇāpatha Kingdoms | 11\n\n“500 years elapsed in the Śaka era, in the 12th year of reign, on full moon day of Kārttika month.” The year of 84-83 BCE was the elapsed year of Śaka 500 and 83-82 BCE was the 12th regnal year of Mangalīśvara and 19th Oct 83 BCE was the full moon day of Kārttika month and the moon was also in Kṛttikā nakśatra. Maṅgalīśvara also conquered Revatīdvīpa (near Goa). He conspired to secure the succession for his son but Satyāśraya-Pulakeśin II, the son of Kīrtivarman I, rebelled and in the ensuing civil war between Maṅgalīśvara and Pulakeśin II, Maṅgalīśvara lost his life as stated in the Aihole inscription. Due to the civil war, the Chālukya Empire became highly vulnerable. Pulakeśin II had the greater responsibility to reinstate the authority of the Chālukyas in Kuntala (Northern Karṇātaka) and Dakśiṇāpatha. Therefore, he decided to put his older son KokkulIa Vikramāditya on the throne in Śaka 515 (69 BCE) and personally led the army to counter the invasions of neighbouring kings. He conquered “Vanavāsi” the capital of Kadaṁbas. He also defeated the Gaṅgas of Mysore, Lātas, Mauryas, Mālavas and Gurjaras. Pulakeśin II defeated Harsha, the king of Uttarāpatha by Śaka 530 (53 BCE) as stated in the Kurtakoti grant of Vikramāditya; it was the greatest achievement of Pulakeśin II. He also defeated the Pallava king and won more than 100 wars against neighbouring kings between Śaka 515 and Śaka 531 (69-53 BCE) and laid strong foundations to Chālukya kingdom. He was referred to in the Hyderabad copper plates as “Samara-śatasaṁghaṭṭa-paranṛpati-parājayopalabdha-parameśvarāparanāmadheyaḥ” which meant that Pulakeśin II achieved the title of “Parameśvara” by defeating other kings in hundred wars. Pulakeśin II took over the reins of Badami in Śaka 532 (52 BCE) from his older son Kokkulla Vikramāditya and appointed him as Viceroy of the Lāta region. Buddhavarasarāja, the younger brother of Pulakeśin II and the uncle of Vikramāditya, was also placed there to support Kokkulla Vikramāditya. The Sanjan grant of Buddhavarasarāja32 indicates this clearly. This grant was issued on the occasion of a solar eclipse on the new moon day of Pauṣa month but the Śaka year is not mentioned. There was\n\n12 | The Chronology of India : From Mahabharata to Medieval Era\n\nonly one solar eclipse which occurred on Pauṣa Amāvāsya, i.e., 5th Jan 28 BCE between Śaka 515 and Śaka 602 (69 BCE-19 CE). Śaka 515 was the 1st regnal year of Kokkulla Vikramāditya whereas Śaka 602 was the last regnal year of Vikramāditya I. Thus, the date of the Sanjan grant can be conclusively fixed on 5th Jan 28 BCE. This means Kokkulla Vikramāditya was ruling the Lāta region in Śaka 555 (28 BCE). It can also be construed that the Chālukya rule in Gurjara was established by Śaka 532 (52 BCE) and Kokkulla Vikramāditya was the first ruler of Gujarat branch of Chālukyas. In fact, he was the author of the Kurtakoti grant issued in Śaka 530 elapsed when he was ruling from Badami. Vikramāditya I, the youngest son of Pulakeśin II, ruled between Śaka 577 and Śaka 602 (6 BCE-19 CE). Therefore, Vikramāditya I cannot be the author of the Kurtakoti grant and thus, it follows that Vikramāditya I was the younger brother of Kokkulla Vikramāditya. JF Fleet rejected the Kurtakoti grant as spurious because he could not explain the total solar eclipse in Śaka 530 elapsed and the rule of Vikramāditya between Śaka 515 to Śaka 602. Interestingly, he also attempted to mislead Indologists by overruling Walter Elliot and Dr. Burnell about the Śaka year of the Kurtakoti grant. He argued that it was Śaka 532 and not Śaka 530. I suspect that JF Fleet deliberately distorted the Śaka year of the Kurtakoti grant because it provides the strongest epigraphic evidence, i.e., total solar eclipse with enough verifiable details. Pulakeśin II had three younger brothers namely Kubja Vishnuvardhana, Buddhavarasarāja and Dharāśraya Jayasiṁhavarmā. As stated above, Buddhavarasarāja was supporting Kokkulla Vikramāditya in the Gurjara region. Pulakeśin II appointed Kubja Vishnuvardhana, who later founded Eastern Chālukya dynasty at Veṅgi as Viceroy of coastal Andhra region. It seems that Pulakeśin II also appointed his brother Dharāśraya Jayasiṁhavarmā as Viceroy near Balegrāma (Belgaum). The Nirpan grant of Nāgavardhana,33 issued by Tribhuvanāśraya Nāgavardhanarāja, the son of Dharāśraya Jayasiṁhavarmarāja, clearly tells us about the brother of Pulakeśin II. Pulakeśin II had at least six sons, namely Kokkulla Vikramāditya, Chandrāditya, Raṇarāgavarmā, Ādityavarmā, Vikramāditya I and Dharāśraya Jayasiṁhavarmā.\n\nThe Dakśiṇāpatha Kingdoms | 13\n\nJF Fleet declared the Nirpan grant spurious because one of the sons of Pulakeśin II was named Dharāśraya Jayasiṁhavarmā. Can the fact that an uncle and nephew have the same name be uncommon, unusual, objectionable or indefensible? JF Fleet deliberately concocted convoluted theories to prove that some Indian inscriptions were spurious or forgeries in order to convince other Indologists that some Indian inscriptions were not genuine and hence, need to be rejected. By selectively rejecting some inscriptions as spurious, JF Fleet succeeded in distorting the chronology of ancient India. It appears that any Indian inscription dated prior to the 4th century CE, was pushed to a corner by JF Fleet. The controversy about the chronology of the Gaṅga dynasty between B Lewis Rice and JF Fleet is enough to understand the devious mind-set of JF Fleet. Pulakeśin II was ruling in Śaka 557 (26 BCE) as mentioned in the Aihole inscription.34 Śaka 577 (6 BCE) was the first regnal year of Vikramāditya I. The Nerur grant35 and Kochre grant36 of Queen Vijayabhaṭṭārikā (the wife of Chandrāditya, the elder brother of Vikramāditya I) were probably issued between Śaka 561 and Śaka 577. The Nerur grant was issued in the 5th regnal year of Vijayabhaṭṭārikā on the 2nd tithi of the dark fortnight of Āśvayuja month and on the occasion of “Viṣuva”. Viṣuva or Viṣuvatkāla means Sāyana Meṣa Saṅkrānti (21st Mar) or Sāyana Tulā Saṅkrānti (23rd Sep). Therefore, the Nerur grant was issued on Sāyana Tulā Saṅkrānti, on kṛṣṇa-pakśa dvitīyā of Āśvayuja corresponding to only one date, i.e., 23rd Sep 18 BCE between Śaka 561 to Śaka 577. Thus, Vijayabhaṭṭārikā’s 1st regnal year was Śaka 562 (22-21 BCE). It appears that Pulakeśin II was alive up to Śaka 561 (23-22 BCE). Vijayabhaṭṭārikā’s grant clearly mentions that Vikramāditya I was the successor of the Chālukya Empire (Sva-vamśajām lakśmīm prāpya ca parameśvaram nivārita-Vikramādityaḥ). Probably, Vikramāditya I had to encounter internal conflicts for succession as well as invasions from neighbouring kings after the death of Pulakeśin II. It is likely that Vikramāditya I took the responsibility of re-establishing the supremacy of the Chālukyas. He allowed Vijayabhaṭṭārikā, the wife of his elder brother Chandrāditya to take over the reins in Vātāpi and he himself led the army to counter aggressive neighbouring kings. Vijayabhaṭṭārikā ruled between\n\n14 | The Chronology of India : From Mahabharata to Medieval Era\n\nŚaka 562 (22-21 BCE) and Śaka 576 (8-7 BCE). Vikramāditya I ascended the throne in Śaka year 577 (6 BCE). Here is the selected text from the Talamanchi (Nellore) plates of Vikramāditya I:37 “Viditamastu vosmābhiḥ pravardhamāna-vijayarājya-ṣadvatsare Śrāvaṇamāsa-Sūryagrahaṇe” (In the 6th regnal year and on the occasion of solar eclipse in Śrāvaṇa month).\n\nThe Solar eclipse was visible on 31st Jul 1 BCE in Nellore and the day was the new moon day of Śrāvaṇa month. The Savnur plates38 of Vikramāditya I are dated in Śaka 597 (14 CE). Vikramāditya I was succeeded by his son Vinayāditya in Śaka 602 (18-19 CE). Here is the selected text from the Dayyamdinne plates of Vinayāditya:39\n\n“Caturddaśottara-ṣaṭccḥateṣu Śaka-varṣeṣu atīteṣu pravardhamānavijayarājya-saṁvatsare dvādaśe varttamāne........... āṣādhapaurṇamāsyām dakśiṇāyana-kāle” (Śaka 614 elapsed, 12th regnal year, full moon day of Āṣāḍha month, on the occasion of Dakśiṇāyana Saṅkrānti).\n\nThe current year is 30-31 CE and 31-32 CE is elapsed. The date regularly corresponds to 22nd / 23rd Jun 31 CE. This date cannot be explained in the epoch of Śakānta era (78 CE). Here is the selected text from the Kendur plates of Kīrtivarman II:40 “Viditamevāstu vosmābhiḥ dvisaptatyuttara ṣaṭccḥateṣu Śakavarṣeṣvatīteṣu pravardhamāna-vijayarājya-saṁvatsare ṣaṣṭhe varttamāne...........

The strongest epigraphic evidence, i.e., one total solar eclipse and two partial solar eclipses cannot be explained in the Śakānta era. Thus, it is evident that the early Chālukyas used the epoch of the Śaka era that commenced in 583 BCE. The text of the following two inscriptions needs to be verified from the original plates to ascertain the actual details of the date because it appears that there are some errors in the transcription. 1.\n\nLunar eclipse on the full moon day of Jyeṣṭha?

It needs verification from the original plates.\n\nRegular in case Śaka 645 elapsed is correct but regnal year cannot be the 28th. Total Lunar eclipse was visible on 20th Aug 723 CE.\n\nThe chronology of the early Chālukyas given by JF Fleet and his followers consists of many distortions. In fact, JF Fleet appears to be obsessed with his concocted idea that Pulakeśin II and Harshavardhana were contemporaries of the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsang. According to JF Fleet, Hiuen Tsang visited the court of Ho-li-sha-fa-t’an-ha or Harshavardhana, otherwise called Shi-lo-o’-t’ie-to or Śīlāditya and apparently visited a capital of the kingdom of Mo-ho-la-ch’a or Maharashtra, the king of which was named Pu-lo-ki-she or Pulakeśin II.54 Since Hiuen Tsang sojourned in India from 629 CE to 645 CE, JF Fleet argued that the date of defeat of Harshavardhana cannot be earlier than 630 CE. Thus, he distorted the entire chronology of the early Chālukyas by rejecting the Altem plates (Śaka 411), the Kurtakoti plates (Śaka 530) and the Kanadalgaon plates (issued in the 5th regnal year of Pulakeśin II or Śaka 537) as spurious or forgery. The Kurtakoti and Kanadalgaon plates refer explicitly to the defeat of Harshavardhana that means Pulakeśin II defeated Harshavardhana at\n\nThe Dakśiṇāpatha Kingdoms | 19\n\nprior to Śaka 530 (53 BCE). This date in Śakānta era should be before 608 CE but JF Fleet argued for the date 630 CE. Truly speaking, the idea to link Pulakesin II and Hiuen Tsang with Harshavardhana of Sthāṇvīśvara is not only baseless speculation but also a palpable forgery because Pulakeśin II flourished in the 1st century BCE whereas Harshavardhana lived in the 5th century BCE because Harshavardhana founded the Sri Harsha era in 457 BCE. In fact, Harsha or Harshavardhana mentioned in the Chālukya inscriptions was Harsha Vikramāditya of Ujjain and not Harshavardhana of Puṣpabhūti dynasty. Pulakeśin II might have defeated Harsha Vikramāditya of Ujjain. Thus, Pulakeśin II and Harsha Vikramāditya lived in the 1st century BCE. As the Chinese chronology explained in the third volume, Hiuen Tsang sojourned in India around 30-15 BCE. Therefore, Hiuen Tsang can be their contemporary. Interestingly, another historian James Fergusson speculated that Pulakeśin II was a contemporary of Khusru II of Persia. He referred to an Arabic chronicle, which records the fact that in the 36th regnal year of Khusru II of Persia (74-36 BCE), gifts and letters were exchanged between him and Pulakeśin II.55 He also speculated about a painting in one of Ajanta caves depicting the presentation of a letter from a Persian king to an Indian king, supposedly Pulakeśin II. Since Pulakeśin II and Khusru II were contemporaries, they might have exchanged gifts and letters in 38 BCE. The Early Chālukyas of Gujarat Kokkulla Vikramāditya, the elder son of Pulakeśin II, was the founder of the Gujarat branch of the early Chālukyas. He was appointed the Viceroy of Gurjara region around Śaka 532 (51 BCE) by his father Pulakeśin II and he was ably supported by Buddhavarasarāja, his father’s younger brother. Many inscriptions of the early Chālukyas referred to Kalachuri-Chedi era because Kalachuri-Chedi era was popular in this region. It may be noted that Kalachuri-Chedi era commenced in 402 BCE. Dharāśraya Jayasiṁhavarmā, the youngest brother of Kokkulla Vikramāditya, succeeded him. He had three sons namely Śryāśraya Sīlāditya, Jayāśraya Vinayāditya Maṅgalarasa and Avanijanāśraya Puṇakeśirāja. The Navasāri grant of Puṇakeśirāja56 was issued in\n\n20 | The Chronology of India : From Mahabharata to Medieval Era\n\nKalachuri year 490 (87-88 CE). This establishes that the Gujarat branch of the Chālukyas was ruling right up to 88 CE. The rise of the Rāṣṭrakūṭas ended the rule of the early Chālukyas. It appears that a Chālukya king Satyāśrayadeva was ruling in the Khandesh region at the end of the 4th Century CE. He was the author of the Pimpalner grant. Interestingly, the Pimpalner grant is the earliest grant to refer to the Śaka-nṛpa-kālātīta era or Śakānta era indicating the beginning of the use of the Śakānta era in the 4th century CE. The Pimpalner grant itself is the strongest evidence to reject the modern chronology of the early Chālukyas. Here is the selected text from the Pimpalner Plates of Chālukya Satyāśrayadeva:57\n\n“Svasti Śaka-nṛpa-kālātīta-saṁvatsara-śateṣu tri (tri) ṣu daśottareṣvasyām saṁvatsara-māsa-pakśa-divasa-pūrvyāyām tithau”\n\nThe date expressed in this inscription as “Śaka-nṛpa-kālātītasaṁvatsara-śateṣu” indicating the epoch of “Śaka-nṛpa- kālātīta” (the end of Śaka era) in 78 CE and not the epoch of “Śaka-nṛpa-rājyābhiṣeka” (the coronation of Śaka king). Earlier, all the inscriptions of the Chālukyas mentioned the date as “Śaka-varṣeṣu-atīteṣu” explicitly referring to the epoch of 583 BCE. The date given in Pimpalner Plates is Śakānta 310 that corresponds to 388 CE. It seems that the Chālukyas re-instated themselves in Khandesh (Central India) by 388 CE. JF Fleet rejected the Pimpalner grant and called it a “modern forgery” because it was written in late characters. The Pimpalner grant was written in late characters because it belongs to a period that came 300 years after the last inscriptions of the Early Chālukyas. This one instance is evidence enough to expose the shallowness of JF Fleet’s palaeography; he had erected the structure of palaeography based on his distorted and concocted chronology. Actually, Fleet’s distorted palaeography in itself is a “modern forgery”. A palaeography derived from the distorted chronology cannot be accepted as evidence till the fundamental issues in ancient Indian chronology get resolved. Moreover, palaeography can be supporting evidence only for dating inscriptions.\n\nThe Dakśiṇāpatha Kingdoms | 21\n\nThe chronology of early Chālukyas of Gujarat: Śaka era Kalachuri- Śakānta In CE (583 BCE) Chedi era era (402 BCE) (78 CE) Kokkulla Vikramāditya (elder son of Pulakeśin II) 532-573 352-393 — 51-10 BCE Dharāśraya Jayasiṁha 573-616 393-436 — 10 BCE-33 CE Śryāśraya Sīlāditya 601-623 421-443 — 18-40 CE Jayāśraya Vinayāditya 593-653 413-473 — 10-70 CE Avanijanāśraya Puṇakeśirāja 653-670 473-490 — 70-87 CE No inscriptions available between 78 CE to 388 CE Satyāśrayadeva — — 310 388 CE\n\nThe verifiable epigraphic evidence: The Sanjan plates of Buddhavarasarāja:58 Solar Eclipse on the new moon day of Pauṣa month. Considering the epoch of the Śaka era in 583 BCE, a solar eclipse was visible on 5th Jan 28 BCE (there was only one solar eclipse occurred on Pauṣa Amāvāsyā between Śaka 515 and Śaka 602). The Nasik plates of Dharāśraya Jayasiṁha:59 The 10th tithi of the bright fortnight of Chaitra month and “Viṣuva” or Sāyana Meṣa Saṅkrānti. The date corresponds to 18th Mar 34 CE (the 436th year of the KalachuriChedi era, i.e., 33-34 CE is current and 34-35 CE is elapsed considering the epoch in 402 BCE). The Pimpalner plates of Satyāśrayadeva:60 Solar eclipse in Śakānta era 310 elapsed. The year was 388-389 CE considering the epoch in 78 CE. A solar eclipse was visible on 18th Aug 388 CE between 13:30 hrs to 16:20 hrs. It is evident that Western historians and many Indian historians too were ignorant of the different epochs of the Śaka era and the Śakānta era. Pandit Bhagvanlal Indraji opined that Navasāri grant of Śīlāditya is a forgery because he could not understand the date of the grant and thought that the name “Śīlāditya” cannot be a Chālukya.61 JF Fleet also declared some grants of the early Chālukyas of Gujarat spurious. Actually, these Indologists were ignorant of the real epoch of the Kalachuri-Chedi\n\n22 | The Chronology of India : From Mahabharata to Medieval Era\n\nera. Moreover, when Vikramāditya, Vinayāditya and Vijayāditya can be Chālukyas then why not Śīlāditya? I take strong objection to this tendency to declare certain Indian inscriptions spurious or forgeries without any concrete evidence. It seems preposterous to think that the early Chālukya kings got the weird idea of forging copper plates in anticipation that some wise men from the West will write their history in the 19th and 20th centuries CE!! And it would have been well nigh impossible for a common man of that era to forge copper plates and a royal seal. As it is well established that Indians had a sophisticated knowledge of the lunisolar calendar from the Vedic period, it would be farcical to think that a common man could mislead learned people with spurious dates and eclipses. In all my extensive studies in this area, I have not once encountered a spurious inscription till date while quite a few of the chronologies propounded by Western scholars are ill-founded, unsubstantiated and hence, spurious. Inscriptions of the Early Chālukyas Prior to Pulakeśin I It is evident from certain inscriptions that Jayasiṁha I, the grandfather of Pulakeśin I, was not the earliest king of the Chālukyas. It appears that the Kaira grant of Vijayarāja,62 the Maruturu grant of Satyāśraya Śri Pṛthivīvallabha,63 the Nerur and Huli grants of Mangalarāja,64 the Godachi grant of Katti Arasa65 and the Mudhol grant of Pugavarman66 were issued in periods prior to the reign of Jayasiṁha I. Interestingly, all of the above grants except Mudhol grant mention the phrase “SvāmiMahāsena-pādānudhyātānām”, a common feature in the grants of the Kadaṁba Dynasty. None of the Badami Chālukya grants from the time of Pulakeśin I mention “Svāmi-Mahāsena-pādānudhyātānām” but Veṅgi Chālukyas used it occasionally. Historians have erred in identifying the Satyāśraya of Maruturu grant to be Pulakeśin II, the Katti Arasa of Godachi grant to be Kīrtivarman I, the Maṅgalarāja of Nerur grant to be Maṅgalīśvara and the Pugavarman of Mudhol grant to be the son of Pulakeśin I. There is no evidence to prove them as such. Unfortunately, these inscriptions are not dated. Only the Kaira grant of Vijayarāja mentions a date in unknown era as\n\nThe Dakśiṇāpatha Kingdoms | 23\n\n“Saṁvatsara,394,Vaiśākha śu 15”. Thus, the Kaira grant was issued on full moon day of Vaiśākha month in the year 394. The Kaira grant also tells us that Vijayarāja was the son of Budhavarmā and the grandson of Jayasiṁha. It is certain that the date of the Kaira grant was not recorded in the Śaka era. In my opinion, the Kaira grant probably refers to the Kārttikādi Vikrama era (719 BCE), also known as “Kṛta era” and “Mālava-gaṇa era”. Western historians concocted the theory that the Kṛta, Mālava-gaṇa and Vikrama eras have the same epoch that commenced in 57 BCE. However, the Kārttikādi Vikrama or Kṛta or Mālava-gaṇa era commenced in 719 BCE. Thus, the Kaira grant was probably issued in 326-325 BCE. Most probably, early Chālukya kings Vijayarāja, Satyāśraya Śri Pṛthivīvallabha, Maṅgalarāja, Katti Arasa, Maṅgalarāja and Pugavarman reigned around 350-250 BCE. The Huli grant mentions Ravishakti, son of Kannasakti who belonged to Phanikula and who was the king of the Sendrakas. Interestingly, the seal of Huli grant contains the figure of a standing tigress, suckling its cub which was probably the emblem of the early Sendrakas. A comprehensive list of important inscriptions of the early Chālukyas of Badami is provided in Appendix IV. The Early Rāṣṭrakūṭas Seemingly, the Rāṣṭrakūṭas were the descendants of Raṣṭrikas or Raṭhikas mentioned in the edicts of Aśoka. According to a Tamil chronicle namely “Koṅgu-deśa-rājakkal”, seven Raṭṭa kings ruled over the Koṅgu region before the rise of the Ganga dynasty. The Uṅdikavāṭikā grant of Abhimanyu67 is the earliest available copper plate inscription of early Rāṣṭrakūṭas. The emblem of this grant bears a Siṁha (lion). Mānāṅka was the founder of the early Rāṣṭrakūṭa dynasty of Mānapura (later Mānyakheṭa or Malkhed). The Hiṅgni Berdi plates of Vibhurāja68 and the Paṅḍuraṅga-palli grant of Avidheya69 also belong to the same lineage of Rāṣṭrakūṭas. Avidheya also claimed to be ruling over Kuntala (Northern Karṇātaka). Unfortunately, these inscriptions are dated either in the regnal years or undated.\n\n24 | The Chronology of India : From Mahabharata to Medieval Era\n\nThe genealogy of the Early Rāṣṭrakūṭas:\n\nMānānka (250 BCE)\n\nDevarāja (230 BCE) (wife Syavalāngi Mahādevi) Vibhurāja (215 BCF)\n\nAvidheeya\n\nMānarāja\n\nBhavisya 205 BCE Abhimanyu 200 BCE\n\nThe Nagardhan plates of Swāmirāja70 and the Tiwarkheda plates of Nannarāja71 indicate that the early Rāṣṭrakūṭas of Achalapura ruled over the region of Vidarbha around Śaka 553 (30 BCE). It appears that the Rāṣṭrakūṭas shifted their base to Vidarbha following the establishment of the Chālukya kingdom in Northern Karṇātaka. Thus, the date of Mānāṅka, Devarāja and Abhimanyu must be fixed as being prior to Chālukya Pulakeśin I (172-117 BCE). The Gokak plates72 of Sendraka King Indrananda mention a Rāṣṭrakūṭa King Dejjā Mahārāja. These plates are dated in Āguptāyika era 845 elapsed. Considering the epoch of the Āguptāyika era in 950 BCE, the year, in which these plates were issued, was 105 BCE. Thus, one Rāṣṭrakūṭa King Dejjā Mahārāja was ruling in the 2nd century BCE.

Govindarāja was succeeded by his son, Karkarāja. The Bhindon grant of the feudatory of Karkarāja74 tells us that Karkarāja was also called “Pratāpaśīla”. Indrarāja was the son of Karkarāja. Indrarāja defeated the Western Chālukya king and married his daughter.75 Dantidurga, the Son of Indrarāja, was the first founder of Rāṣṭrakūṭa Empire. He built the Daśāvatāra temple at his capital Elāpura (Ellora). He defeated the Chālukya King Vallabha, i.e. Kīrtivarman II, the kings of Kāñchi (Pallava), Kerala, Chola, Pāṅḍya, Śri Harsha, Vajraṭa and Karṇāṭaka between Śaka 671-675 (88-92 CE) [Kāñchiśa-Keralanarādhipa-CholaPāṅḍya-Śri-Harsha-Vajraṭa-vibheda-vidhāna- dakśam, Karṇāṭakam].76 He defeated the kings of the Gurjara dynasty in Ujjain and made them his “Pratīhāra” or door keepers. He also extended his empire up to the Konkan region. Three copper plate grants of Dantidurga: The Ellora Plates:77 Śaka 663 current, Āśvayuja month, Śuddha trayodaśī, Somavāra (Monday). The date corresponds to 8th Oct 78 CE. The Manor Plates:78 Śaka 671 current, i.e., 88 CE. No details for verification. The Samangad Plates:79 Śaka 675 elapsed, Māgha month, Rathasaptamī (7th day in bright fortnight). The date corresponds to 4th Jan 92 CE. After the untimely death of Dantidurga, Krishnarāja or Krishna I, the son of Karkarāja and the uncle of Dantidurga, took over the reins.\n\n26 | The Chronology of India : From Mahabharata to Medieval Era\n\nHe annexed the kingdom of the early Chālukyas and Manna-nagara (Mānapura) from the Gaṅgas.80 His son Govindarāja II was appointed as Yuvarāja in Śaka 692 (109 CE).81 Govinda II subjugated the Eastern Chālukya King of Veṅgi Vishnurāja or Vishnuvardhana IV. He and the Pallava King Nandivarmā also played a role in the coronation of Gaṅga King Śivamāra II. The copper plate grants of Krishnarāja I & Govindarāja II: The Manne Plates of Krishnarāja I:82 Śaka 680 current, “Hemalamba” saṁvatsara, new moon day of Āśvayuja and solar eclipse. Probably, the day was 24th Oct 97 CE). The Barsi Plates of Krishnarāja I:83 Śaka 687 current (103-104 CE), “Śubhakṛt” saṁvatsara, new moon day of Jyeṣṭha month and solar eclipse. The date corresponds to 22nd Jun 103 CE. The Talegaon plates of Krishnarāja I:84 Śaka 690 current (106-107 CE), “Plavaṅga” saṁvatsara, new moon day of Vaiśākha month and solar eclipse. Vaiśākha amāvāsyā occurred on 21st Apr 106 CE and a solar eclipse was visible between 16:56 hrs and 18:28 hrs. The Alas Plates of Govindaraja II:85 Śaka 692 current, “Saumya” śamvatsara, Āṣāḍha śuklapakśa saptami. The date corresponds to 3rd Jun 108 CE. Govinda II also known as “Vallabha”, was referred to as “JagattuṅgaPrabhūtavarṣa-Pratāpāvaloka-Śrivallabha”. The Pimpri plates of Dhārāvarṣa-Dhruvadeva86 clearly mention that Govindarāja was called “Vallabha” (Vallabhākhyaḥ...... Śrigovindarājo). The Rāṣṭrakūṭa kings were in general called as “Vallabha”. In the concluding Praśasti of a Jain Purāṇa “Harivaṁśa”, Jinasena states: “Śākeṣvabdaśateṣu Saptaṣu diśam pañcottareṣūttarām, Pātīndrāyudhanāmni Kṛṣṇanṛpaje Śrivallabhe dakśiṇām, Pūrvām Śrimadavanti-bhūbṛti nṛpe vatsādhirāje’param, Śauryānāmadhimandale Jayayute vire varāhe’vati” 87\n\n“During the Śaka year 705 (121-122 CE), Śrivallabha (Govindarāja or his brother Dhruvarāja) ruled in the South, Indrāyudha in the North, Vatsarāja of Avanti in the East and Varāha or Jayavarāha of Śaurya territory (Saurāṣṭra) was ruling in the West.” These directions are given\n\nThe Dakśiṇāpatha Kingdoms | 27\n\nwith reference to Vardhamānapura (Śripārśvālaya-Nannarāja-vasatau), probably Wadhwan in Jhālāvad division of Kāṭhiāwād. Only one inscription of Pratīhāra Vatsarāja that was issued in Śaka kāla 717 elapsed (134-135 CE), is available. Muni-śaśi-naga-saṁsthe yāti kāle Śakānām । Surabhi-charama māse śukla-pakśe daśamyām ॥88\n\nThe date referred to is the 10th tithi of the bright fortnight of Surabhicharama (last month of Vasanta ritu i.e. Vaiśākha) month in Śaka year 717 elapsed corresponding to 21st Apr 134 CE. This inscription mentions the victories of Vatsarāja over the Karṇāta, Lāṭa rulers, Jayāpīda of Kashmir and the king of Gauda (avajitāśeṣa-Karṇāṭa-Lāṭair bhaṅgtvā dikśu kśatārir-jjaya-janita-Jayāpīda-pīdasya yasya). The Jayāpīda mentioned in this inscription was Chippata Jayāpīda who ruled over Kashmir around 102-114 CE. Kuvalayamāla of Uddyotana Sūri89 was composed in Śaka 700 (116-117 CE) at Jāvālipura (Jalor) during the reign of Vatsarāja. Thus, Vatsarāja was a contemporary of Rāṣṭrakūṭa Govinda II and Dhārāvarṣa Dhruva. The reference of Śaka-kāla in the inscription of Vatsarāja indicates the epoch of the Śaka era (583 BCE) and not the epoch of Śaka Kālātīta era (78 CE). It is evident that Vatsarāja ruled at Avanti in the beginning of the 2nd century when the Śaka era was still in vogue. It appears that Nāgabhaṭa II shifted his capital from Avanti to Kānyakubja and used the Kārttikādi Vikrama era (719-718 BCE) in his inscriptions. Dhārāvarṣa Dhruva, the second son of Krishnarāja and the younger brother of Govinda II, succeeded his elder brother around Śaka 700-706 (117-123 CE). It may be noted that the Pimpri grant of Dhārāvarṣa Dhruvarāja was issued in Śakānta 697 (775 CE) [Śaka-nṛpakālātīta-saṁvatsara-śata-ṣaṭke sapta-navatyadhike....]. Interestingly, the Dhruvarāja of the Pimpri grant himself tells us about his ancestor Dhruvarāja. “Tasyānujaḥ Sri-Dhruvarāja-nāmā mahānubhāvo-vihata-pratāpaḥ prasādhitā’śeṣa-narendra-cakraḥ krameṇa vālārka-vapur-babhūva”90\n\nThe verb “babhūva” is used only in the narration of events that took place in the remote past and certainly would not have been used for the\n\n28 | The Chronology of India : From Mahabharata to Medieval Era\n\nreigning King Dhruvarāja. Therefore, it is evident that Dhruvarāja II of the Pimpri grant refers to his ancestor Dhruvarāja I. Thus, the reign of Dhruvarāja, the younger brother of Govindarāja, flourished in the 2nd century CE, whereas Dhruvarāja II of the Pimpri grant ruled in the 8th century CE. It appears that Dhruvarāja I was coronated by the ministers around Śaka 700-706 (117-123 CE) as Govindarāja became increasingly addicted to women and shirked from his responsibilities. Dhruva, who was also called “Nirupama”, imprisoned the powerful Gaṅga king (Śivamāra II) and defeated Vatsarāja who attempted to seize the Gauda (Bengal) kingdom.91 Dhārāvarṣa’s son Govinda III, who ascended the throne as Yuvarāja around Śaka 720 (137 CE), ensured the release of the imprisoned Gaṅga King (Śivamāra II). Three copper plate grants of Govinda III: The Manne plates:92 Śaka 724 (140-141 CE), Lunar eclipse and Puṣya nakśatra. Total Lunar eclipse was visible on 11th Dec 140 CE from 19:57 hrs to 1:22 hrs. (The nakśatra was Ārdra according to modern Sūrya Siddhānta; needs verification.) The Manne plates:93 Śaka 732 elapsed (148-149 CE), Full moon day of Pauṣa month, Puṣya nakśatra and lunar eclipse. The lunar eclipse was visible on 11th Jan 149 CE. The Kadaṁba plates:94 Śaka 735 elapsed, 10th tithi of the bright fortnight of Jyeṣṭha month, Puṣya nakśatra. The date corresponds to 12th May 151 CE. (The nakśatra was Uttara Phālguni not Puṣya.) Lokasena, the disciple of Guṇabhadra, wrote a “Praśasti” at the end of Uttarapurāṇa. Lokasena’s praśasti tells us that Jinasena, the guru of Guṇabhadra, was a contemporary of the Rāṣṭrakūṭa King Amoghavarṣa. King Akālavarṣa was ruling during Lokasena’s time. Lokasena clearly mentions the Śaka era as “Śaka-nṛpa-kālābhyantara” to distinguish it from “Śaka-nṛpa-Kālātīta”. “Akālavarṣa-bhūpāle pālayatyakhilānilam...... Śaka-nṛpa-kālābhyantaraviṁśatyadhikāṣta-śata-mitābdānte Maṅgala-mahārtha-kāriṇi Piṅgalanāmani samasta-jana-sukhade।” “Śrī-Pañcamyām budh-ārdra-yuga-divasa kare Maṅtri-vāre Budhāṁśe,\n\nThe Dakśiṇāpatha Kingdoms | 29\n\npūrvyāyām Siṁha-lagne Dhanuṣi Dharaṇije Vṛścike Kau Tulāyām sarpe śukle kulīre gavi ca Suraguruḥ niṣṭhitam bhāvyavaryaiḥ, prāpte jyām sarvasāram jagati vijayate puṇyametat purāṇam ॥”95\n\nAccording to Lokasena, the Rāṣṭrakūṭa King Akālavarṣa was reigning in Śaka 820. “Śaka-nṛpa-kālābhyantara” clearly indicates the epoch of 583 BCE and not 78 CE. Śri Pañchami is a special ritual performed on the Pañchami tithi before “Nandīśvara” a Jain festival. The Nandīśvara festival is observed in the months of Āṣāḍha, Kārttika and Phālguna in the bright fortnight from the Aṣṭami tithi to Paurṇamāsi. Final day, i.e., Paurṇamāsi of Nandīśvara is called “Taledevasa”. Śrāvaṇa Kṛṣṇa Pañchami was also called as Śri Pañchami. In order to fix the exact Śri Pañchami referred to in the Uttara Purāṇa, we have to compute the date based on the details given by Lokasena. The Eastern Chālukya inscriptions refer to the Rāṣṭrakūṭas as Raṭṭas. The grant of Ammarāja I96 tells us that Vijayāditya Narendra Mrigarāja fought 108 battles in 12 years against the forces of the Raṭṭas and Gaṅgas. Narendra Mrigarāja (141-180 CE) was a contemporary of Govinda III & Amoghavarṣa I. This grant also tells us that Guṇagāṅka Vijayāditya (182226 CE), at the instigation of the king of the Raṭṭas, conquered the Gaṅgas and cut off the head of Maṅgi in battle field. He also terrorised Krishna (Akālavarṣa Krishnarāja II) and burnt his city. Later, the province of Veṅgi was overrun by the new Raṭṭa claimants, probably, during the reign of Chālukya Bhīma (227-256 CE). Two Inscriptions of Akālavarṣa Krishnarāja II: The Saundatti Inscription of Pṛthivīrāma, a feudatory of Krishnarāja II:97 Śaka 797 elapsed, Manmatha saṁvatsara. 213-214 CE elapsed and 214-215 CE is current; no details for verification. The Mulgund Inscription of Rāṣṭrakūṭa Krishnavallabha:98 Śaka 824 elapsed, and Dundubhi saṁvatsara. 240-241 CE elapsed and 241-242 CE is current; no details for verification. The Chronology of the Early Rāṣṭrakūṭa Dynasty: The list of inscriptions of the early Rāṣṭrakūṭas is given in Appendix V. The chronology of Early Rāṣṭrakūṭas has been reconstructed based on the inscriptions dated in Śaka era (583 BCE).\n\n30 | The Chronology of India : From Mahabharata to Medieval Era Govindarāja Karkarāja Indrarāja Dantidurga (also known as Sāhasatuṅga, Khaḍgāvaloka) Krishnarāja (also known as Akālavarṣa, Shubhattuṅga) Govindarāja II (also known as Prabhūtavarṣa) Dhruvarāja (also known as Dhārāvarṣa, Nirupama) Govindarāja III (also known as Prabhūtavarṣa, Jagattuṅga) Amoghavarṣa I Akālavarṣa Krishnaraja II\n\nŚaka era (583 BCE) 600-620? 620-640? 640-661?\n\nIn CE 16-37 CE? 37-56 CE? 57-77 CE?\n\n662-676\n\n78-93 CE\n\n677-692\n\n94-109 CE\n\n692-706\n\n109-123 CE\n\n706-724\n\n123-140 CE\n\n724-740 740-796 797-832\n\n140-157 CE 157-213 CE 213-249 CE\n\nAccording to the Pulivarru grant of Ammarāja I, Indaparāja was the king of Mānyakheṭa (Śri-Mānyakheṭādhipatirindaparāja nāmā viditamahāraṭṭavaṁśajaḥ prakaṭaguṇaḥ).99 Ammarāja ruled for seven years around 257-263 CE. The author of “Jwālā Mālini Kalpa” stated that he completed the work in Śaka 861 elapsed (278-279 CE) during the reign of Krishnarāja (Aṣṭa-śata-saika-ṣaṣti-pramāṇa-Śaka-saṁvatsareṣu atīteṣu Śri-Mānyakheṭa-kaṭake parvaṇyakśaya-tritīyāyām.... Śri-Krishnarājarājye samāptametat....).100 The Chedi King Krishnarāja was probably ruling around Śaka 861 (278-279 CE). According to the Shravanabelagola inscription,101 Indrarāja III died in Śaka 904 (320-321 CE). The rule of the Rāṣṭrakūṭas ended due to the rise of Western Chālukyas in the beginning of the 4th century CE. The Date of Ellora’s Kailash Temple Kailash temple of Ellora is the largest single monolithic structure and one of the greatest manmade wonders of the world. This Śiva temple is located close to the famous Ghrishneshvara Jyotirlinga temple. Evidently, Ellora is an ancient center of Śaivism. There are total 34 rock-carved templemonastery caves excavated out of Ellora hills. Out of 34 caves, 12 are Buddhist caves on the southern side (Caves,1-12), 17 are Hindu caves in\n\nThe Dakśiṇāpatha Kingdoms | 31\n\nthe middle (13-29) and 5 are Jain caves at the northern end (30-34). These caves have been serially numbered from 1 to 34 starting from southern end of the hill to the northern end. The Kailash temple is the 16th Cave. Archaeologists and historians generally agree that these caves of Ellora were built in the following three phases: • Early Hindu Phase - 400-600 CE (Caves 17-19) • Buddhist Phase - 600-730 CE (Caves 1-12) • Hindu and Jain Phase - 730-950 CE (Hindu Caves 13-16 & Jain Caves 30-34) It is evident from the chronological history of Ellora that Hindu temple caves are the earliest structures in the hills of Ellora. Buddhist and Jain caves have been excavated later. But historians unreasonably date the Daśāvatāra temple (Cave 15) and the Kailash temple (Cave 16) in the later phase citing epigraphic evidence. According to them, Daśāvatāra temple cave was excavated during the time of Rāṣṭrakūṭa King Dantidurga and Kailash temple cave was excavated during the reign of King Krishna I. Ferguson and Burgess speculated that “All the superfluous wealth of the Rāṣṭrakūṭa prince (Krishna I) was placed at the disposal of the Brahmanas, to commemorate their triumph over the Buddhists, the Kailash must always remain a miracle of patient industry applied to well defined purpose.” German scholar Hermann Goetz says102: “The Kailash is generally dated into the middle of the 8th century approximately, on the evidence of reference in inscriptions of the Rāṣṭrakūṭa dynasty which attribute its erection to Krishnarāja I (757-772 CE). However, on the closer inspection the problem appears not so simple. The Kailash is not a homogenous building erected under one ruler. Its very size alone excludes the possibility of its having been excavated and sculptured within the fifteen years of Krishnarāja’s reign. For the narrowness of space and the technical resources then available had to keep in bounds even the ambitions of such a strong ruler.” Goetz made an exhaustive study of Kailash temple and speculated its development through eight architectural phases. According to Goetz, the lion and elephant frieze on the lower plinth of the Kailash temple was carved during the first half of the 11th century.\n\n32 | The Chronology of India : From Mahabharata to Medieval Era\n\nAccording to historians, the general design of the Kailash temple is inspired by the architecture of the Virūpākśa temple of Pattadakal. It is also observed that there are a number of panels which belong to the period of early Chālukyas. Historians thought that Chālukyan artists were present at Ellora because the Kailash temple was being carved out on a Chālukyan prototype, i.e., Virūpākśa temple of Pattadakal. Thus, the historians have propounded the following three main hypotheses: 1. Kailash temple (Cave 16), Daśāvatāra temple (Cave no. 15), Cave no. 13 and 14 have been excavated after the Buddhist phase. These caves cannot be erected without having advanced skills of rock-carving. Therefore, the Caves from 13 to 16 must be dated after the Buddhist phase. The monoliths of Cave no. 13-16 are situated prominently in the hill of Ellora and the best monoliths among the available ones for rock-cut temples. It is evident that whoever occupies the hill first, he would naturally select these monoliths for excavation of caves. For the sake of argument, let us assume that Hindus occupied the hills first but Buddhists took over the hill before Hindus could plan a temple on this best monolith. Now the question arises that why Buddhists neglected this best monolith and erected the caves only on the southern end of the hill? Why everyone had conspired to reserve or earmark this monolith for the future construction of the Kailash temple? It seems highly unlikely that Buddhists left this monolith untouched though it was available. In reality, Kailash temple and Daśāvatāra temple had been already erected on this monolith before the Buddhist occupation of the hill. Therefore, Daśāvatāra and Kailash temple caves must be dated in the earliest phase. 2. The Daśāvatāra cave inscription, Kailash temple inscription, Kadamba copper plates and Bagumra copper plates clearly indicate that the Caves 13, 14, 15 and 16 were excavated during the time of the Rāṣṭrakūṭa kings Dantidurga and Krishna I. The inscription of Daśāvatāra Cave (No. 15) opens with an address to Śiva and Parvati.103 It contains 29 4/3 ślokas. This inscription eulogizes the Rāṣṭrakūṭa dynasty and gives the following genealogy of King Dantidurga:\n\nThe Dakśiṇāpatha Kingdoms | 33\n\n1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.\n\nDantivarmā Indrarāja Govinda Karka Indra Dantidurga\n\nThe contents of the inscription clearly indicate that this inscription was written after the death of King Dantidurga. This inscription is a eulogy of Rāṣṭrakūṭa King Dantidurga and it does not give any information about the construction of Daśāvatāra temple. Moreover, it is written in early Devanagari characters which unambiguously indicates that this inscription was written at least 150-200 years after the date of Dantidurga. Kailash Temple has a small inscription as “Svasti Kannaradeva”104 there were three Rāṣṭrakūṭa kings, having the name of Krishna or Kannara. Moreover, this inscription simply mentions the name of Kannaradeva. This cannot be the evidence to establish that King Kannaradeva erected the Kailash temple. The Kadamba copper plates also simply eulogize King Krishna I and metaphorically state that King Krishna I was like a Kanneshvara temple.105 The Bagumra copper plates clearly indicate the existence of the Śiva Temple in Elapura before the time of King Krishna I. These plates’ record; “when King Krishna saw this wonderful temple, he admired it to be the real Kailash of Shiva. He had full praise for the Śilpi (Sculptor). King Krishna also wondered that even the Śilpi might have been surprised after seeing what he had created.” These plates also say that the people have great admiration for this wonderful edifice since ancient times (satatam bahu carcayanti).106 Evidently, the epigraphic evidence unambiguously suggests that the Kailash temple was excavated at least a few hundred years before the time of King Krishna I. Therefore, historians have wrongly concluded that the Ellora caves (13 to 16) were excavated during the reign of Rāṣṭrakūṭa King Dantidurga and Krishna I.\n\n34 | The Chronology of India : From Mahabharata to Medieval Era\n\n3. Kailash temple was erected during the time of Rāṣṭrakūṭas because the Kailash temple was being carved out on a Chālukyan prototype, i.e., Virūpākśa temple of Pattadakal. Since historians wrongly dated the Kailash temple, it is, therefore, speculated that the Ślipi (sculptor) of Kailash temple has copied the design from Virūpākśa temple of Pattadakal. If we correct the date of Kailash temple, it is more likely that the architect of Virūpākśa temple has copied the design from Kailash temple. In view of the above, we can conclude that the Rāṣṭrakūṭa kings did not excavate the Daśāvatāra and Kailash temples in Ellora hills but these Hindu temple-caves were erected at least a few hundred years before the time of the early Rāṣṭrakūṭas. When Dantidurga and his uncle Krishna I defeated the Chālukya kings and took control over northern Maharashtra, they established their capital in Elāpura (Ellora and Devagiri fort). A copper plate inscription of Dantidurga dated Śaka 663 is also found in Ellora.107 In all probability, an inscription was engraved on the west side of a mandapa in front of Daśāvatāra temple when a considerable time could have elapsed after the death of Dantidurga because this inscription was written in early Devanagari characters. The Bagumra copper plates unambiguously inform us that Kailash temple was in existence since ancient times and King Krishna himself admired this wonderful edifice and the Śilpi (sculptor). Kokāsa : The Sūtradhāra (Architect) and Śilpi (Sculptor) of Kailash Temple According to the later Kalachuri inscriptions of Ratanpur, Chhatisgarh, Kokāsa was the great Sūtradhāra (architect) and Ślipi (sculptor) of ancient times.108 These inscriptions refer to the descendants of Kokāsa living in Chhatisgarh. The medieval literary sources of Maharashtra clearly record that Kokāsa was the architect of the Kailash temple. This temple was known as Manikeshwar temple in ancient times. MK Dhavalikar writes; “There is considerable literary evidence of the medieval period which refers to this rock temple as the Manikeshwar cave temple because it was built by a centain queen Manikavati of the king of Elapura. The story goes that a certain king of Alajapura (Achalapur in\n\nThe Dakśiṇāpatha Kingdoms | 35\n\nAmaravati, Maharashtra) had committed a certain sin in his previous birth, and as a result, was suffering from incurable disease. Curiously enough, the king suffered from the disease only during the night whereas during day time he was his normal healthy self. Once the king went on a hunting expedition to Mahisamala (Mahisamala near Ellora) and bathed in the tank at that place. After bath he found that he was cured of the disease probably because the sin which he had committed in his previous birth was washed off. The queen, who had accompanied the king, worshipped the god Ghrishneshwar at Elapura and took a religious vow that if the king was cured, she would build a temple in the honour or Shiva. Naturally therefore when the king was cured, she requested the king to build the temple immediately. She decided to observe fast until she saw the sikhara of the temple. The king agreed, but no architect on earth would have been able to build the temple is such a short time. The king summoned many artists, but they all said that it would take at least sixteen months to build a temple with its sikhara. There was, however, one shilpi who would do the job; he was one Kokāsa, a resident of Paithan (ancient Pratishthana), but he would not start his day without a bath in the Godavari River. He was summoned and the king told him his predicament. Kokāsa accepted the challenge and assured the king that the queen could have the darshana of the sikhara within a week’s time. Kokāsa then began to carve out the sikhara within a week and saved the royal couple from their predicament. The temple was then named after the queen as Manikeshwar and the king established a settlement at the site.”109 Evidently, the architect of the Kailash temple was Kokāsa. Medieval literature eulogizes Kokāsa to be the incarnation of Viśvakarmā. He erected the Kailash Cave-temple on the request of the King Ela or Aila of Achalapur and his queen Manikavati. Since the Kailash temple was erected following the religious vow of queen Manikavati, the Kailash was called “Manikeshwar Temple” in ancient times. The Date of Queen Manikavati of Achalapura Achalapura (close to ancient Amaravati, Maharashtra) was the ancient kingdom of central India. It appears that Achalapura was the capital of a clan of the Aila dynasty. Sanskrit poet Dandi records that Bharavi’s\n\n36 | The Chronology of India : From Mahabharata to Medieval Era\n\nancestors migrated from Anandapur of north-western India and settled in Achalapura. According to an excerpt published in 1801 in the sixth volume of the Asiatic Researches or Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, the name of the king was Ela or Aila who built the city of Elapura. He also excavated the temples, and built the fortress of Devagiri (Daulatabad). According to Purāṇas, the Aila kings belonged to the lunar dynasty. Unfortunately, there is no information about the time of the Aila king and his queen Manikavati. In all probability, they lived before the rise of the later Śātavāhanas (828-334 BCE) in Maharashtra. Therefore, Kailash temple might have been erected before the 9th century BCE. It may also be noted that the Kailash temple was the first cave-temple of the hills of Ellora. In view of the above, we can summarize the following chronology of Ellora caves considering the epoch of the Śaka era (583 BCE): • Early Phase [Hindu Caves (13-29)] : 1000-830 BCE. • Middle Phase [Buddhist Caves] : 800-500 BCE. • Later Phase [Jain Caves] : 100 BCE-300 CE. The Later Rāṣṭrakūṭas Interestingly, the Rāṣṭrakūṭas were ruling till they were conquered by the early Chālukya Jayasiṁha I (225-200 BCE). The Miraj plates110 tell us that Chālukya Jayasiṁha I defeated one Rāṣṭrakūṭa King Indra, the son of Krishna to establish the Chālukya kingdom. “Yo Rāṣṭrakūṭa-kulamindra iti prasiddhaṁ Kṛṣṇāhvayasya sutamaṣṭaśatebhasainyaṁ। nirjitya dagdha-nṛpa-pañca-śato babhāra bhūyaśchālukya-kula-vallabha-rājalakśmīṁ ॥”\n\nTwo Bijapur inscriptions111 of Vīranārāyaṇa dated in Śaka 1109 (17th Oct 525 CE) and Navasāri grant112 tells us that Vīranārāyaṇa regained and re-established the Rāṣṭrakūṭa Empire which was lost to the Chālukyas. “Nimagnām yaschālukyābdhau Raṭṭa-rājya-śriyam punaḥ, Pṛthvīmivoddharan Dhīro Vīranārāyaṇo’bhavat ।”\n\nIt is evident that the early Chālukya Jayasiṁha I dethroned Rāṣṭrakūṭa King Indra, the son of Krishna and founded the early Chālukya kingdom.\n\nThe Dakśiṇāpatha Kingdoms | 37\n\nDantidurga and Krishnarāja established the Rāṣṭrakūṭa Empire by defeating the early Chālukyas at the end of the 1st century CE. It appears that the Rāṣṭrakūṭas again lost their kingdom to the Chālukyas in the beginning of the 4th century CE. Some later inscriptions of the Rāṣṭrakūṭas claim that the Rāṣṭrakūṭas were the Yādavas and the descendants of Yadu. It seems that the Rāṣṭrakūṭa-Yādava King Vīranārāyāṇa re-established the rule of the Rāṣṭrakūṭas again in the 6th century CE. The Tadakal (Gulbarga) inscription113 of Amoghavarṣa, the earliest inscription of the later Rāṣṭrakūṭas to mention Vīranārāyaṇa, is dated in Śakānta 651 (729 CE). Interestingly, this inscription starts with the invocation “Namastuṅga ciraścuṁbi....” which is commonly found in Yādava inscriptions. The list of inscriptions of the later Rāṣṭrakūṭas dated in Śakakālātīta era, i.e., Śakānta era (78 CE) is given in Appendix VI. We can easily reconstruct the chronology of the later Rāṣṭrakūṭas and the Gujarat branch of the Rāṣṭrakūṭas who ruled around the period from the 8th to 10th century CE.

Early Gaṅgas started ruling over the Koṅgu region of Tamilnadu (the\n\n38 | The Chronology of India : From Mahabharata to Medieval Era\n\nmodern districts of Salem, Dharmapuri and Coimbatore) Anantapur and Kolār districts and gradually established the empire of the Gaṅgas in Gaṅgavādi, i.e., Bangalore, Tumkur and Mysore districts. Elephant was the emblem of Gaṅga dynasty. The majority of Early Gaṅga inscriptions were found in this region. There are several theories about the origin of the Gaṅga Dynasty. The inscriptions of the Western Gaṅgas claim that the Gaṅgas were Jāhnavīyas (sons of Gaṅga) and belonged to the Kāṇvāyana gotra. It seems that the Gaṅgas were either direct descendants of the imperial Kāṇvāyana dynasty of Magadha or an offshoot. According to later Gaṅga inscriptions, Hariśchandra had a son named Bharata. Vijayamahādevi, the wife of Bharata, took a bath in the Gaṅga River at the time of conception and the son born subsequently was named Gaṅgādatta. The descendants of Gaṅgādatta were the Gaṅgas. Most probably, the Gaṅgas belonged to a branch of the Bharata dynasty. According to later Jain records, Gaṅga King Padmanābha sent his sons, Diḍiga and Mādhava, towards the south during the time of aggression from a neighbouring ruler (Mahipāla of Ujjain). Diḍiga and Mādhava arrived at Perur and met a Jain Āchārya Siṁhanandi who supported them in establishing the kingdom of the Gaṅga Dynasty in Kuvalālapura (Kolār). Later inscriptions like the Kulagana plates of Śivamāra I and the Kudlur plates of Mārasimha also refer to the Jain Āchārya Siṁhanandi. This story may have evolved because Jain Āchāryas secured the patronage of later Gaṅga kings. Koṅgani Varman was the founder of the Gaṅga dynasty of Tālavanapura. Kudlapura stone inscription114 gives a date as Śaka 25 elapsed (Śakavarṣam gateṣu pañcaviṁśati 25 neya), Śubhakṛt saṁvatsara, Phālguna śuddha pañcamī, Rohiṇī nakśatra and Śanivāra (Saturday) referring to Prathama Gaṅga (First Gaṅga) Koṅgani Mādhava Varman. This corresponds to 7th Feb 557 BCE; however, the weekday was Wednesday. No further information is available as to how Śaka 25 is linked to the first Gaṅga King Koṅgani Mādhava Varman but the nakśatra was Rohiṇī on 7th Feb 557 BCE. Possibly, the forefathers of Koṅgani Varman established the Gaṅga kingdom in Śaka 25 (557 BCE). According\n\nThe Dakśiṇāpatha Kingdoms | 39\n\nto the Hebbata grant of Durvinīta,115 Mādhava Varmā or Madivarmā was the father of Koṅgani Varman. A Tamil Chronicle116 called “Koṅgudeśa-Rājakkal” places the reign of Koṅgani Varman in Śaka 111 (473472 BCE). Earlier, seven kings of Raṭṭa lineage had ruled over the Koṅgu region. Koṅgani Varman dethroned the last Raṭṭa king Śri Vikrama Deva Chakravarty and established the Gaṅga kingdom in Koṅgudeśa in Śaka 111. The Sasanakota grant117 was issued in the 1st regnal year of Mādhava Varman I, the son of Koṅgani Varman and the Kandasala grant118 was issued in his 9th regnal year. He was a learned king, who had authored a commentary on the “Dattaka Sūtra”. Mādhava Varman I had three sons – namely, Krishnavarman also known as Vijaya Krishnavarman, Āryavarman also known as Ayyavarman and Harivarman also known as Arivarman. The Tanjore plates (Śaka 169)119 and the Tagadur plates (Śaka 188)120 indicate that Harivarman was the one of the earliest users of the Śaka era (583 BCE) in South India. Possibly, the Śaka era calendar had become popular by then. These plates provide verifiable details of the reign of Mādhava Varman I. The Tanjore Plates: Śaka 169 elapsed, “Prabhava” Saṁvatsara, New moon day of Phālguna month, Revatī nakśatra, Vṛddhi yoga, Vṛṣabha lagna and Bṛguvāra (Friday). 415-414 BCE elapsed and 414-413 BCE is current. 1st Mar 413 BCE was the new moon day of Phālguna and the nakśatra was Revati. The Tagadur Plates: Śaka 188 elapsed, “Vibhava” saṁvatsara, the 10th tithi of the bright fortnight of Phālguna month, Punarvasu nakśatra and Guruvāra (Thursday). 396-395 BCE elapsed and 395-394 BCE is current. 9th/10th Feb 394 BCE was the śukla daśamī of Phālguna month and the nakśatra was Punarvasu. The Kudlur Plates:121 Year 88? or 188? or 198? The era is not mentioned. Māgha māsa, Amāvāsyā, Svāti nakśatra, Sūrya grahaṇa, Somavāra need verification. The Kudlur grant probably refers to the 88th year of Gaṅga rule from Koṅgani Varman (Śaka 111). Thus, the year intended is probably, 198th year of Śaka (386-385 BCE). A solar eclipse occurred on 25th Sep 386 BCE when the nakśatra was Svāti but the month was Āśvina. It is not possible to have Svāti nakśatra on Magha Amāvāsyā.\n\n40 | The Chronology of India : From Mahabharata to Medieval Era\n\nHarivarman was also the earliest Gaṅga king to be associated with Tālavanapura (Tālakad). The Tanjore grant of Harivarman relates to an interesting story: A Buddhist philosopher named “Vādimadagajendra” came to Tālavanapura and affixed a letter of challenge on the main door of the palace for a debate on the subject of the existence of the soul. A Brahmana named Mādhava Bhaṭṭa took the challenge and, in the debate which took place in the court of Harivarman, he put forth his arguments in favour of the existence of the soul (ātmā) while the Buddhist scholar denied the existence of the soul. Mādhava Bhaṭṭa defeated the Buddhist scholar and established the theory of the existence of the soul. A very pleased Harivarman gave the Brahmana the title “Vādibhasiṁha” and gifted him “Varakodu” or Orekodu village in the east of Mysore. JF Fleet declared the Tanjore grant spurious because he could not digest the early date of the grant (Śaka 169). On the basis of his palaeography, which in itself is based on distorted chronology, he propagated that the grant was written in the late characters of the 10th century. In reality, the archaic Telugu-Kannada script had remained the same almost for 1000 years. This can be construed from the Tanjore plates (Śaka 169) and Sudi plates (Śaka 860). There are many other instances of such scripts that continued without any major change. For example, the cuneiform script of Babylon remained almost the same for more than 1000 years. Truly speaking, John Faithful Fleet’s unfaithful palaeography is a forgery and spurious, not the Tanjore grant. Western historians and their followers tied themselves in knots by selectively declaring some of the Gaṅga inscriptions as forgeries or spurious based on their distorted theory of palaeography. There is still a divergence of opinion among historians in this regard. Palaeography can be supporting evidence but it cannot be the primary evidence to reject certain inscriptions as forgeries. Unfortunately, some of the inscriptions have been rejected because they were found to be contrary to the distorted chronology given by Western historians, whereas their entire theory of palaeography was based on the distorted chronology of ancient India. There is a genuine need to study the evolution of ancient Indian scripts without any prejudice from the theories propounded by Western\n\nThe Dakśiṇāpatha Kingdoms | 41\n\nscholars. Just for the sake of argument, if any inscription is found in late characters, is it not possible that a replica or a copy of the damaged ancient inscription might have been made at a later date with the permission of a descendant king of the same dynasty? The tendency to declare ancient Indian inscriptions as forgeries or spurious without any concrete evidence is highly objectionable and must be repudiated with the contempt it deserves. In fact, the entire nonsense of rejecting inscriptions forgeries was started by JF Fleet. As the dates given in certain Gaṅga inscriptions cannot be correctly calculated in Śakānta era (78 CE), he came up this insidious scheme of labelling these inscriptions forgeries and or spurious. These Gaṅga inscriptions clearly refer to “Śaka-varṣeṣu atīteśhu” not “Śaka-kālātīta-saṁvatsara-śateṣu”. Thus, these Gaṅga inscriptions belong to the Śaka era (583 BCE) not the Śakānta era (78 CE). Interestingly, JF Fleet initially believed that all Gaṅga kings up to Śripuruṣa were fictitious personalities but he had to change his stand later. B Lewis Rice, then Director of the archaeological researches in Mysore, accepted all Gaṅga inscriptions as genuine but JF Fleet was wily enough to overrule him. As shown above, the dates of inscriptions of Harivarman can be correctly calculated, considering the epoch of Śaka era in 583 BCE. Harivarman had two brothers namely Āryavarman and Krishnavarman. Historians generally accept that Āryavarman and Krishnavarman are the same personality but there is no concrete evidence to prove it. It appears that there was a succession struggle between the three brothers. The Pallava King Siṁhavarman coronated Āryavarman and later, the Pallava King Skandavarman coronated Mādhava Siṁhavarman, the son of Āryavarman as the successor of the Gaṅga kingdom in Kuvalāla or Kolār region.122 Krishnavarman or Vijaya Krishnavarman123 also ruled for some time and later, his son Siṁhavarman124 became the king. There is no further information available about the descendants of Āryavarman and Krishnavarman. Harivarman’s son Vishnugopa succeeded him. It seems that Harivarman and Vishnugopa ruled for over a century. The Harihar grant of the unnamed son of Vishnugopa125 was issued around Śaka 272\n\n42 | The Chronology of India : From Mahabharata to Medieval Era\n\n(311-310 BCE) in “Sādhāraṇa” saṁvatsara. Vishnugopa had two sons. According to Lewis Rice, Rāja Malla was probably the unnamed son of Vishnugopa who issued Harihar grant. Mādhava II was the second son of Vishnugopa. He married the sister of the Kadaṁba King Krishnavarman. Mallohalli plates126 indicate that Mādhava II ruled for over 29 years. JF Fleet declared it spurious because his distorted chronology had not enough room to accommodate the rule of more than 29 years of Mādhava II. The Bannitalapura grant of Mādhava II was issued on the occasion of lunar eclipse on Mārgaśīrṣa Pūrṇimā in Śaka 280 (304-303 BCE). The date regularly corresponds to 1st Nov 304 BCE and it is quite likely that 304-303 BCE was the first regnal year of Mādhava II. The chronology of the Early Gaṅga Kings up to Mādhava II:\n\nMādivarmā or Mādhava Varman Koṅgani Varman Mādhava I Harivarman Vishnugopa Unnamed elder son of Vishnugopa Mādhava II (Younger son of Vishnugopa)\n\nŚaka era (583 BCE)\n\nIn CE\n\n25? 111-134 135-167 168-218 219-269 270-280 280-324\n\n?? 472-447 BCE 448-416 BCE 415-365 BCE 364-314 BCE 313-304 BCE 304-259 BCE\n\nAvinīta was the successor of Mādhava II. It is evident from the Sringeri127 and Kondinjeruru128 plates that Avinīta was the youngest child. He was coronated while still in the lap of his mother (Jananī-devatāṅkaparyaṅkatala-samadhigata-rājya-vaibhava-vilāsena). Avinīta married the daughter of the Punnāta King Skandavarman. He had two sons namely Durvinīta and Nirvinīta. Based on the regnal years mentioned in the inscriptions, it is evident that Avinīta and Durvinīta, father and son, also ruled for over a century. Avinīta might have had the longer tenure because he became king when still a child. Thus, it seems that Avinīta ruled for 64 years from Śaka 325 to Śaka 389 (258-194 BCE). The verifiable details of inscriptions of the Gaṅga King Avinīta: The Śṛngeri Grant:129 2nd regnal year, Vaiśākha śukla 5 and Pauṣa śukla daśamī, Rohiṇī nakśatra with reference to Avinita’s mother\n\nThe Dakśiṇāpatha Kingdoms | 43\n\nBṛhad Devi. 21st Mar 257 BCE was Vaiśākha śukla pañcamī and 17th Dec 257 BCE was Pauṣa śukla daśamī and the nakśatra Rohiṇī. The Residency Plates:130 25th Regnal year, Kārttika śukla pañcamī, Uttarāṣāḍha nakśatra. The date was 18th Oct 233 BCE and moon was at Uttarāṣāḍhā nakśatra. The Kudunjeruvu Grant:131 25th regnal year, Bhādrapada śukla daśamī, Pūrvabhadrā nakśatra, Thursday. Uttarāṣāḍhā was on daśamī (25th Aug 233 BCE) and Pūrvabhadrā was on Pūrṇimā (29th Aug 233 BCE). The Merkara Grant:132 Śaka 388, Māgha month, śukla pañcami, Svāti nakśatra, Somavāra (Monday). The date was 26th Dec 196 BCE, but the nakśatra was Pūrvabhadrā. The date was probably 10th Jan 195 BCE, Māgha kṛṣṇa pañcamī, Svāti nakśatra.\n\nDurvinīta, the son of Avinīta and the daughter of the Punnāta King Skandavarman, succeeded his father. He was a great patron of learning. He wrote a commentary on the 15th Sarga (canto) of Kirātārjunīyam in his 20th regnal year (173 BCE). The great poet Bhāravi was the author of Kirātārjunīyam. Durvinīta authored a grammatical work known as “Śabdāvatāra” and translated “Bṛhat-Kathā” into Sanskrit. Guṇāḍhya (2200-2100 BCE) authored Bṛhat-Kathā in Paiśāchi dialect of Prakrit and it was known as “Vaḍḍa-Kathā”. Bhāravi was a contemporary of Gaṅga King Durvinīta. A Sanskrit work “Avantisundarīkathā” narrates an interesting story about Bhāravi. One day, Bhāravi met the Pallava King Siṁhavishnu as a stranger and recited a Sanskrit verse in praise of Narasiṁha, incarnation of Vishnu. Pallava Siṁhavishnu enquired of Bhāravi, who the author of this verse was. Bhāravi replied thus: “In the North-West there is a town named Anandapura, the crest jewel of Ārya-deśa, from which a family of Brahmanas of the Kauśika gotra migrated and settled at Achalapura. Narayaṇaswāmi, a member of this family, had a son named Dāmodara, who became a great scholar and was known as Bhāravi. He became a friend of the Chālukya Vishnuvardhana. On one occasion, he accompanied the king on a hunting expedition and while in the forest had to eat animal flesh. To expiate this sin, he set out on\n\n44 | The Chronology of India : From Mahabharata to Medieval Era\n\na pilgrimage and finally settled in the court of Durvinīta. He is the author of this verse.”133 It is evident that Bhāravi was a contemporary of the Chālukya Vishnuvardhana, the Gaṅga Durvinīta and the Pallava Siṁhavishnu. The Cellur grant of Chālukya Vira Choda,134 Kalpataru grant of Vijayāditya135 and the inscription of Tribhuvanamalla136 tell us that Chālukya kings were endowed with the special coronation names Vishnuvardhana and Vijayāditya (Vishnuvardhana-Vijayādityādi-viśeṣa-nāmnām). Vishnuvardhana - Jayasiṁha I Vijayāditya - Raṇarāga Vishnuvardhana - Pulakeśin I\n\nBased on the regnal period of Pulakeśin I (172-117 BCE), it is evident that Bhāravi lived between 220 BCE and 140 BCE. Bhāravi was a contemporary of the early Chālukya Vishnuvardhana-Jayasiṁha I or Vishnuvardhana-Pulakeśin I and not the Eastern Chālukya Kubja Vishnuvardhana as wrongly identified by historians. The inscriptions of Durvinīta indicate that he ruled for over 40 years. Some inscriptions refer to him as “Vṛddharāja”. Thus, the reign of Durvinīta can be fixed between Śaka 390 and Śaka 445 (193-138 BCE). Historians wrongly identified Nirvinīta as Durvinīta. The Tagare grant137 of Polavīra mentions Nirvinīta as the son of Avinīta. The Serugunda stone inscription138 also mentions Nirvinīta. It is more logical to conclude that Avinīta had two sons, i.e., Durvinīta and Nirvinīta. Polavīra was the son of Nirvinīta not Durvinīta. The verifiable details of Gaṅga king Durvinīta’s inscriptions:\n\nThe Kadagattur Grant:139 4th regnal year, Māgha śuddha Saptamī and Revatī nakśatra. The date corresponds to 22nd Dec 190 BCE.\n\nThe Uttanur Plates:140 20th regnal year, Kārttika Pūrṇimā, Kṛttikā nakśatra and Abhijit muhūrta. The date corresponds to 24th Oct 173 BCE.\n\nThe Hebbata Grant:141 31st regnal year, Phālguna Pūrṇimā, Uttara... nakśatra. The date corresponds to 18th Feb 161 BCE, Phālguna pūrṇimā and Uttara Phālgunī nakśatra.\n\nThe Dakśiṇāpatha Kingdoms | 45\n\nThe Saliggame Grant:142 39th regnal year, Kārttika śuddha puṇya tithi, Śatabhiṣaj nakśatra. The date corresponds to 30th Sep 155 BCE, Kārttika śuddha daśamī and Śatabhiṣaj nakśatra. The Nallala Grant:143 40th regnal year, Vaiśākha prathama pakśa, parva (lunar eclipse?), Viśākhā nakśatra, brāhma muhūrta. The date corresponds to 1st Apr 154 BCE, Vaiśākha Pūrṇimā and Viśākhā nakśatra. A lunar eclipse was also visible at 19:28 hrs. Muṣkara, the son of Durvinīta, also had a very long reign though his records are very few. The British museum grant of Muṣkara144 mentions him as “Mokkara Vṛddharāja”. JF Fleet declared it spurious because he could not accommodate a “Vṛddharāja” in his distorted chronology. Kulagana grant145 of Śivamāra I also refers to him as “Śrimat Koṅgani Vṛddharāja”. Śrivikrama succeeded his father Muṣkara and married the daughter of Sindhurāja (Śakala-digantara-prasiddha-Sindhurāja-duhitṛvaraḥ). He also married the daughter of a Chola king descended from the reputed Karikāla. The Bedirur grant146 tells us that Bhūvikrama was born to Śrivikrama and the daughter of a Chola king (Kārita-kāverītīra-karikālakula-vaṁśotpanna-Chola-nṛpati-putrī-putraḥ). Bhūvikrama started ruling from Śaka 531 (52 BCE) because the Bedirur grant was issued in his 25th regnal year (Śaka 556). He defeated a Pallava king during his reign and ruled for a long period. Śivakumāra or Śivamāra I, the youngest brother of Bhūvikrama, succeeded him. He was also known as Navakāma. The Hallagere grant147 of his 34th regnal year is dated, Śaka 635 (51-52 CE) which means Śivamāra I ascended the throne in Śaka 601 (17-18 CE). Bhūvikrama’s reign appears to be very long from Śaka 531(52 BCE) to Śaka 600 (17 CE) and is probably inclusive of his reign as Yuvarāja. Śivamāra I ruled up to Śaka 648 (65 CE) and lived a full life of hundred years. Śivamāra’s grandson Śripuruṣa succeeded him. The Javali plates148 give Śaka 672 (89 CE) as his 25th regnal year and the Nallamangala plates149 give Śaka 698 (115 CE) as his 50th regnal year. Thus, Śaka 699 (116 CE) was probably the last year of Śripuruṣa’s reign. Interestingly, the reigns of all Gaṅga kings up to Śripuruṣa spanned long periods. The Kulagana plates150 used the term “Vṛddharāja” (grand\n\n46 | The Chronology of India : From Mahabharata to Medieval Era\n\nold king) for almost all of these kings. The Gaṅga kings were patrons of learning and rarely ventured to expand the territories of the Gaṅga Empire. They maintained peaceful relations with neighbouring kings. It appears that Bhūvikrama had the longest reign of 69 years; there is nothing inherently improbable about the duration of the reign of Bhūvikrama as he may have started his rule at the age of 15 or 16 as Yuvarāja. Śivamāra II succeeded Śripuruṣa in Śaka 700 (117 CE). According to the Manne plates,151 Śivamāra ventured to defeat the Vallabha army consisting of Rāṣṭrakūṭa, Chālukya, Haihaya and other brave leaders encamped at the village called Mudugudur. The Manne grant of Govinda III152 tells us that Dhārāvarṣa Dhruva imprisoned a Gaṅga king and that the imprisoned Gaṅga was certainly Śivamāra II. Later, Yuvarāja Govinda III pardoned and released him. Thus, the Gaṅgas became the allies of the Rāṣṭrakūṭas. The Manne plates of Śivamāra II inform us that Śivamāradeva was reinstated by Rāṣṭrakūṭa Govindarāja III and Pallava Nandivarmā (Rāṣṭrakūṭa - Pallavānvaya - tilakābhyām mūrdhābhiṣikta - Govindarāja - Nandivarmā - bhidheyābhyām samanuṣṭhita - rājyābhiṣekābhyām). Yuvarāja Mārasiṁha ascended the throne in Śaka 719 (136 CE) because the Kottimba grant of his 3rd regnal year is dated, Śaka 721 (138 CE). The verifiable details of Gaṅga inscriptions: The Arekere grant of Śrivikrama:153 1st regnal year, Kārttika Pūrṇimā, Rohiṇī nakśatra, lunar eclipse and Somavāra (Monday). The date corresponds to 27th Oct 81 BCE, Kārttika Pūrṇimā and Rohiṇī nakśatra. Lunar Eclipse was visible between 20:14 hrs to 1:06 hrs but it was Saturday. The Bedirur grant of Bhūvikrama:154 Śaka 556, 25th regnal year, Chaitra śukla daśamī, Maghā nakśatra, Thursday. The date corresponds to 13th Mar 28 BCE, Chaitra śukla daśamī and Āśleṣa/ Maghā nakśatra. The Agali grant of Śripuruṣa:155 Śaka 669 elapsed, 22nd regnal year, Māgha śukla trayodaśī, Punarvasu nakśatra. The date corresponds to 5th/6th Jan 87 CE and the nakśatra was Punarvasu.\n\nThe Dakśiṇāpatha Kingdoms | 47\n\nThe Javali grant of Śripuruṣa:156 Śaka 672 elapsed, 25th regnal year, Vaiśākha śukla daśamī, Uttara Phālgunī nakśatra, saṁkrānti in Vṛṣabha rāśi. The date corresponds to 19th Apr 88 CE and the nakśatra was Uttara Phālguni. The Hosur grant of Śripuruṣa:157 Śaka 684 elapsed, Vaiśākha śukla Pūrṇimā. Viśākhā nakśatra, lunar eclipse, Śukravāra (Friday). Irregular. The lunar eclipse was on 25th Mar 99 CE but it was Chaitra Pūrṇimā and Viśākhā nakśatra; needs verification from the original text of the inscription. The Manne plates of Mārasiṁha:158 Śaka 719, Āṣāḍha śukla? Pañcamī, Uttara bhadrā nakśatra. Irregular; needs verification from the original text of the inscription. The Kottimba grant of Mārasiṁha:159 Śaka 721, Śrāvaṇa, śuddha pūrṇimā, Dhaniṣṭhā nakśatra, Lunar eclipse, Somavāra (Monday). The date corresponds to 29th Jul 139 CE, Śrāvaṇa Pūrṇimā and the nakśatra was Dhaniṣṭhā. A lunar eclipse was visible between 4:18 hrs to 5:51 hrs. The Perjjarangi grant of Rājamalla I:160 Śaka 741 elapsed (158-159 CE), Solar eclipse. The solar eclipse was visible on 13th Jul 158 CE between 14.03 hrs to 15.19 hrs. The Narsapura grant of Rājamalla II:161 Śaka 824, Phālguna month, śukla pakśa, pañcamī, Rohiṇī nakśatra, Budhavāra (Wednesday). Rohiṇī nakśatra was on Saptamī and not on pañcamī and the day was 6th Feb 241 CE. The Gattavadipura grant of Rāja"
