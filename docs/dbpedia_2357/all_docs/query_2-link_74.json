        "text": "With a cool climate, this tech capital and the world’s back-office is the hottest destination in India. Bangalore is one of the country’s fastest growing cities, its population burgeoning from 1.6 million in 1970 to over 7 million today. While the IT sector is one of the biggest economic drivers of the city, real estate, banks, hotels, media and a whole lot of emerging industries keep the city pulsating. With an educated upwardly mobile populace, Bangalore is the test market for any new consumer product launch, from credit cards to clothing brands to biscuits and liquor."
