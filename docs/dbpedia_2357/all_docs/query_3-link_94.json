        "text": "In News\n\nIn yet another move to close the regulatory gap between banks and shadow banks, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has mandated exposure limits to the non-banking finance companies, in line with commercial banks.\n\nAbout the News\n\nGroup exposure limit determines the maximum amount a bank can lend to one business house. This is done to prevent the troubles at entity having a spillover effect on the bank which could lead to a systemic risk.\n\nThe new rules set the exposure limit for NBFCs as follows:\n\nIn case of breach of the large exposure limits, the NBFCs have to report to the department of supervision of RBI, thus being barred from undertaking any further exposure (at the entity or group level) until it is down within the limit.\n\nThe RBI has also warned that any failure to comply with the exposure limit may lead to imposition of penalties on the NBFCs.\n\nSignificance of the move:\n\nIn the wake of the many defaults seen in the shadow banking space (like IL&FS crisis), RBI has been harmonising regulations between the NBFCs and the banks.\n\nRBI had come out with scale-based regulations for the NBFC sector, wherein large NBFCs will be subjected to greater scrutiny akin to that of the banks.\n\nThe recent move by the RBI will harmonize regulations for upper-layer non-banks, commercial banks and co-operative banks, leaving little room for arbitrage.\n\nWithout the cap on exposure, there was an inherent credit risk associated with loans given by NBFCs.\n\nThe rules will help avoid concentration of risk and insulate lenders from shocks owing to failure of any large borrower account.\n\nBy creating a large exposure framework, RBI is also prodding large borrowers to tap funds from the markets instead of solely relying on bank loans.\n\nSince market exposures will be in the form of tradeable securities, the price discovery of an asset is better, as markets react faster than the banking sector on fresh information about a company.\n\nThe move to bring NBFCs on par with banks on large exposures, and a string of other measures by the central bank, have also led to speculation that the sector may enter a phase of consolidation.\n\nSources:\n\nNBFC- Non-Operative Financial Holding Company (NOFHC)\n\nRBI caps lending limits of NBFCs to bring them on a par with those of banks\n\nIndia: B&F: Consolidation In NBFC Secto\n\nNon-Banking Financial Companies\n\nNonbank Financial Companies (NBFCs)\n\nIn News\n\nThere has been a political controversy in Maharashtra over the demand to remove loudspeakers from mosques which has given rise to some fundamental questions regarding noise pollution.\n\nAbout the News\n\nFor this, the Maharashtra government is relying on provisions of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000 to negotiate the controversy over the use of loudspeakers by mosques.\n\nThe Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000:\n\nSection 2 (a) of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 includes noise in the definition of ‘air pollutant’.\n\nNoise pollution and its sources are regulated under the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000 under The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.\n\nThe Act has defined ambient acceptable noise levels, silence zones, restrictions on the use of loudspeakers, horns, sound-emitting construction equipment, and bursting of crackers.\n\nIt has also laid down the responsibility for enforcement.\n\nWhat constitutes ‘noise’ under the law?\n\nAs per the Central Pollution Control Board’s mandate for noise pollution, ‘noise’ is defined as unwanted sound.\n\nThreshold for acceptable level of noise: Noise pollution Rules have defined the acceptable level of noise in different zones for both daytime and nighttime.\n\nIn industrial areas, the permissible limit is 75 decibels (unit of sound; tenth of a ‘bell’, symbol dB) for daytime (6 am to 10 pm), and 70 dB for night (10 pm to 6 am).\n\nIn commercial areas, these ceilings are fixed at 65 dB and 55 dB, while in residential areas they are 55 dB and 45 dB during daytime and night respectively.\n\nIn silence zones, i.e., an area comprising not less than 100 metres around hospitals, educational institutions and courts, it is 50 dB in the daytime and 40 dB during the night.\n\nThe Rules around the use of loudspeakers\n\nThe noise level at the boundary of the public place, where a loudspeaker or public address system or any other noise source is being used, shall not exceed 10 dB (A) above the ambient noise standards for the area or 75 dB (A), whichever is lower.\n\nA loudspeaker or a public address system shall not be used except after obtaining written permission from the designated authority.\n\nThe state government can provide exemption during any cultural or religious festive occasion of a limited duration not exceeding 15 days in all during a calendar year.\n\nThe violation of norms regarding the use of loudspeakers/public address systems can result in seizure of the equipment, and a fine of Rs 10,000.\n\nFor Article related to this topic, refer: https://edukemy.com/current-affairs/gazette/2022-03-14/unep-frontiers-2022-report-noise-blazes-and-mismatches\n\nSource:\n\nExplained: What constitutes ‘noise’, and how can noise pollution harm you?\n\nNoise Pollution\n\nImage source:\n\nConsequences of Noise Pollution\n\nIndia: IMA to create awareness on effects of noise pollution\n\nOn April 21, 1526 the first Battle of Panipat was fought between the invading forces of Babur and the Lodi Empire. The Mughal forces of Babur, the Timurid ruler of Kabulistan, defeated the much larger ruling army of Ibrahim Lodi, Sultan of Delhi. It marked the beginning of the Mughal Empire. This was one of the earliest battles involving gunpowder firearms and field artillery. The new war tactics introduced by Babur were the tulughma and the araba. Tulughma meant dividing the whole army into various units, viz. the Left, the Right and the Centre. The Left and Right divisions were further subdivided into Forward and Rear divisions. Through this a small army could be used to surround the enemy from all the sides. The Centre Forward division was then provided with carts (araba) which were placed in rows facing the enemy and tied to each other with animal hide ropes. These two tactics made Babur’s artillery lethal. The guns and cannons could be fired without any fear of being hit as they were shielded by the bullock carts which were held in place due to the hide ropes holding them together.\n\nOn April 21, India celebrates National Civil Services day.

At some borders, customs officials examine 80-100 percent of all the goods that pass through. If countries adopted advanced risk management practices, consignments could be cleared far more quickly.\n\nTime efficient: Early implementation of the BBIN Motor Vehicles Agreement (MVA) can lead to shorter transport routes, quicker travel times, and lower costs, in addition to a smaller carbon footprint. World Bank analysis finds that under the MVA, a truck traveling from Agartala in India’s north east to Kolkata port will take 65 percent less time and be 68 percent cheaper.\n\nCutting trade cost: OECD data shows that if countries in the region were to fully implement the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) - which aims to simplify paperwork and harmonize customs procedures - trade costs for lower middle-income economies such as the BBIN nations could come down by over 17 percent.\n\nDigitize, Automate:\n\nImproved transparency: The digitization and automation of customs and other procedures can also lead to faster and more transparent clearances.\n\nBetter harmonization: Digitization has the added advantage of enabling countries to harmonize their data, facilitating data exchanges and allowing traders and government officials to take evidence-based decisions.\n\nFaster clearance: Single electronic gateways will allow importers and exporters to file their documents electronically. Once fully operational, these National Single Windows are expected to dramatically reduce clearance times.\n\nEconomic benefits:\n\nReducing complexity: It will lead to upgrading procedures for cargo handling, storage, tariff calculation and payment at border points which will ease the complexity of cross-border trade.\n\nIncreased income: In Bangladesh, seamless connectivity with India can raise national income by as much as 17 percent, while India would gain by 8 percent.\n\nBridge Infrastructure Gaps: an integrated multimodal transport network will go far in promoting the smoother movement of goods.\n\nGateway to South-east: The implementation of the agreement is expected to improve the value chain in sub-regional trade. It is expected to become the gateway to southeast and east Asia.\n\nTourism potential: Through NNIN, all the four countries can take the full advantage of ‘tourism potential’ with rich natural and cultural attractions, including many of the world’s major Buddhist sites.\n\nCountering China: It will help in countering Chinese aspirations which has tried to focus on the tourism sector in South Asia with the help of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).\n\nWhat are the Challenges to BBIN project?\n\nInfrastructure gaps:\n\nLimited movements: At the moment, large gaps remain even within nations, multimodal freight operations are limited; this is even less so for cross-border movement.\n\nMismatch: There is mismatch in handling capacity between the various check posts across countries. For example, while India’s Petrapole border can handle up to 750 trucks a day, Bangladesh’s Benapole point on the other side can only clear 370 of them.\n\nDominance of India:\n\nSkewed trade balance: India is a dominant member of BBIN with almost 90 per cent trade volume in its favour and thus other countries in the group may not have their priorities completely aligned with India.\n\nDifference in objectives: Countries like Bhutan often puts its emphasis on maintaining its leading rank in the gross national happiness index over economic growth. Consequently, there have been some reservations in Bhutan about free movement of cargo and people within the sub-region.\n\nPolitical issues:\n\nIssue of illegal migrants: Within the BBIN countries there are political problems and issues of mistrust. For example, India is facing problem of illegal Bangladeshi migrants which has been a political hot potato for many years.\n\nTrade blockade: India and Nepal experienced a political standoff where Nepal accused India of creating trade blockages.\n\nThreat to informal economy: Local issues may rise as any attempt to streamline trans movement will be resisted by economic agents who are essentially rent-seekers who have gained from the non-transparency and inadequacy of the system.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nImproving logistics:\n\nRails and inland waterways: There is need for stronger efforts to move freight onto rail networks and inland waterways to make the most of the multimodal nature of marine containers.\n\nCapacity building of roads: Roads too needs attention as although roads carry around 70 percent of the freight on these regional corridors, most are crowded two-lane thoroughfares where trucks travel at 30 kilometers per hour or less, and some sections are incapable of carrying larger vehicles or containers.\n\nIncorporating stakeholders:\n\nCalculative approach: For the BBIN initiative to achieve success, it is important to calibrate the speed and level of its ambitions.\n\nImproving heterogeneity: It must be recognised that even within the BBIN group there is significant heterogeneity in terms of economic size and level of economic development. Therefore, the political objectives and policy priorities of these countries might be very different.\n\nNational security: With national security issues increasingly becoming an area of major concern, the long-term acceptability and success of BBIN will depend on how well these challenges are taken up within the framework.\n\nWay Forward\n\nThe BBIN initiative is a welcome sub-regional integration project for India as it allows India to bypass Pakistan and discuss connectivity issues with Bhutan, Bangladesh and Nepal, which has proved difficult at the SAARC level. Besides it integrating well with India's 'Look East Policy', this initiative can also solve India's longstanding problem of locational disadvantage and poor connectivity of its north-eastern states. Thus, BBIN initiative fits well with the new wave of developing massive transnational road and rail connectivity networks. All these will facilitate intra- and inter-regional trade in goods and services. It may also help develop sub-regional and regional value chains, which can be further integrated with global production networks.\n\nQuestion: The BBIN initiative is a boon to India’s regional connectivity ambitions. But this initiative comes with its set of challenges. Elaborate.\n\nSOURCES:\n\nBBIN:\n\nImage:\n\nWhat will it take to connect the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal (BBIN) sub-region?:\n\nIntra BBIN trade:\n\nThis is image Martian dawn on the plains of Elysium Planitia, captured by the InSight rover. Elysium Planitia is the second largest volcanic region on Mars. Elysium Mons is the largest volcano in this region. InSight (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport, is a Mars lander which is the first robotic explorer to study the crust, mantle and core of Mars.\n\nThe InSight rover has two primary science objectives: to understand the formation and evolution of the terrestrial planet by investigating the interior structure and processes of Mars and to determine the present level of tectonic activity and meteorite impact rate on the planet. In comparison with other planets that could be too small or too large, Mars preserves the record of its formation and can give insights into how the planet formed. This makes it the perfect laboratory from which to study the formation and evolution of rocky planets.\n\nSources:\n\nELYSIUM PLANITIA:\n\nNASA shares picture of Martian sunrise clicked by InSight rover:\n\nThis is image of Murchison meteorite. Japanese planetary scientists studying three carbon-rich meteorites have suggested a crucial link between the building blocks of life on Earth and asteroids. The researchers propose that materials required for the building blocks of life were likely deposited on earth by carbon-rich asteroids as meteorites. The scientists have confirmed the presence of all five primary nucleobases in the three meteorites. These nucleobases — indicated by the letters G, C, T, A, and U — make up all DNA and RNA.\n\nThe three meteorites studied were the Murchison meteorite (Australia, 1969), Tagish Lake meteorite (Canada, 2000), and Lake Murray meteorite (USA, 1933). Nucleobases are biological compounds containing nitrogen that form the basis for nucleic acids — ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Nucleic acids are essential components for life as we understand it.\n\nSource:\n\nDid space sow seeds of life on Earth?

Bylaws say that only temporary structures on public lands can be demolished without notice, however what is temporary and what is not needs to be settled as per due process. This due process is not followed in this case.\n\nAs per the author, this kind of violation of the due process affects all citizens and goes against the constitutional promise to protect lives and safeguard rights. Thus, illegal encroachments need to be addressed as per the law and the Supreme Court must address this principle at the earliest.\n\nWhy should you read this article?\n\nTo know about the sequence of events at the Jahangirpuri demolition drive in northwest Delhi.\n\nTo know about the due process to be followed in a demolition drive.\n\nTo know about the consequences of such a violation of due process.\n\nSource:\n\nDue process lies at heart of citizens’ rights, freedoms.\n\nEssence: The editorial provides insight into the possibility of wheat export from India due to war crisis. The common argument being presented is that wheat surplus could be exported and could fetch additional gains for agriculture sector.\n\nHowever, India needs to plan its wheat export well as limitations to wheat export are far many than its advantages- the wheat stocks are marginal and fragile, food inflation is rising (political appetite for opposition), respecting international trading pacts during times when production won’t be as good, etc. Container handling cost, logistics movement charge render our wheat expensive and remove the competitive advantage.\n\nIndia must focus on increasing the quality of product, access newer markets and innovation in products than hastily exporting wheat considering it a short-term advantage.\n\nWhy should you read this article?\n\nTo understand the shortcomings of wheat export.\n\nTo know the trading disadvantage in India with respect to exporting products.\n\nSource:\n\nDon’t rush into export ‘opportunity presented by Russia-Ukraine conflict\n\nEssence: The editorial talks about the objectives of the Criminal Procedure (Identification) Act and explains how it is in alignment with the Constitutional norms. The idea has been to facilitate the identification and investigation in criminal matters. The scope of measurements has been expanded in the act by only combining the terms mentioned in the previous Identification of Prisoners Act and CrPC. The scope of medical examination of the accused has been a part of Law Commission recommendations. There are no controversies regarding scientific techniques like polygraphy, narcoanalysis, etc. as they do not fall under procedures. Under the Act, data for all persons convicted would be collected. However, biological data for petty offenses won’t be collected and would be in proportion to the crime committed. Provision of better technology will only help in faster and effective rendering of justice.\n\nWhy should you read this article?\n\nTo understand the intricacies of CPA and the advantages of its coming to existence.\n\nSource:\n\nUnfounded apprehensions about this act"
