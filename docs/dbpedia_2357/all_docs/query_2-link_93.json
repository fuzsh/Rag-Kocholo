In this setting the Indian Jain temple architecture are not just the house of Tirthankar idol and place of worship, they are additionally the depository of information, craftsmanship, architecture and culture. The practices and customs of temples exist in history as well as in present time impact. The socio-cultural existence of its kins offers congruity to conventional religious and cultural qualities. The advancement of Jain architecture is set apart by its strict adherence to the first ancient models that were gotten from religious thought and that proceeded over numerous centuries. The Jain religion and its logic incredibly affected Jain temple Architecture in its developmental procedure which proceeds till this date. Hence this exposition through authentic research and other narrative, literary works and hypothetical examination on ancient treatise and current research works on the Jain temple Architecture of India draws out the ideas that have been received since ancient circumstances for the construction of the holy Jain caves and temples, the science associated with the construction of the temple structure and the procedures required alongside the expertise it took to build such buildings. India has given with the gifts of the different religious beliefs.

The most awesome of every Jain temple are found in Bihar Region. In India, Bihar has a portion of the essential examples of Jain Artchitecture. Jain architecture can't be certified with its very own style, for in any case it was just about a branch of the Hindu and the Buddhist styles. In the underlying years, numerous Jain temples were made abutting the Buddhist temples following the Buddhist rock-cut style. At first these temples were basically cut out of rock faces and the utilization of blocks were relatively insignificant. In any case, in later years Jains began building temple-urban communities on slopes in view of the idea of mountains of interminability. Contrasted with the quantity of Hindu temples in India, Jain temples are few and dispersed out. The Jain used to separate their more prepared and harmed sanctuaries and made new ones of every comparable place. Then again Jain temples had a specific aggressor air around them, likely as a result of looters who may have diverted wealth. Encompassed by troubled dividers, the Jain temples are partitioned into wards in a way like sustained urban communities with parapets and specialties to repulse equipped animosity. Each ward thusly was watched by monstrous bastions at its closures, with an invigorated portal as the principle entrance. The reason being that Jain temples are the most extravagant temples in the world, outperforming even Mughal buildings as far as loftiness and material richness. Together these viewpoints draw out the workmanship, science and theory behind the construction of the Jain temple which is as significant today as it used to be in the ancient circumstances. A congruity of custom and a science which has its root in the beginning of human consciousness. India has a profound established culture and human progress returning to 5000 years ever.

INTRODUCTION In the legitimate works of Jain (called Agamas), the beautiful word \"Arhat\" joins Lord Rishabh Dev. The religion proposed by \"Arhat\" is known as \"Arhat dharma\". This is the obsolete name of the Jain religion. In the ancient structure of Vaidika, for example, Padmapurana, Matsyapurana, Shiv Purana, therefore, we find the proposal for Arhat dharma. The verbalization \"Arhat\" remained in vogue until Lord Parshvanath. The lord Sri Mahavir was better known as 'Shraman Bhagwan' (Dutt, 1908). The statement of \"Jin\" is the institution of the \"Jain religion\". One who has relied on the preaching of \"Jin\" and that which follows him is called \"Jain\". Since the Buddhism, religion was supported by Buddha and Christianity was supported by Jesus, so too the religion supported by Jin (Arhat) was called Jain Religion (Dwivedi 0. P., 1989). Since the follower of Shiva is called 'Shaiv', the supporter of Vishnu is called Vaishnav; therefore, the admirer of \"Jin\" is called Jain. Jesus, Shiva and Vishnu are precious names. In any case, the \"Jin\" verbalization does not refer to any person. The Jain religion does not appreciate the evaluation of a man. He loves the genuine properties of a soul that has reached the state of \"Jin\", that is, which has destroyed the front of the karma in learning, in the nature and in the essence of the soul (Dwivedi R. C., 1975). As per Jain religion, there were twenty-four Tirthankars who existed. As per Jain custom, Lord Rishabh was the first who taught the lesson of Ahimsa to the world. So he could be known as a reformer of the Jain religion or a rejuvenation of security that existed a long time ago and had a long tradition (Eisenstadt, 1984). 1.2 PRESENT STATE OF RESEARCH ON JAIN ARCHITECTURE Jain temples of India reveal the impact of Jains in the country. Due to the presence of a number of pilgrimage sites and historical sites in Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha, Jain Architecture has a special impact. The Jains have been great temple builders in India, particularly in Rajsthan, Karnataka, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Bihar and Odisha. In Patna, Page #22 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ there are thirteen Jain temples, which belong to both the Swetamaber and Digamber sects. Jainism has had a critical effect on the elaboration of an agreement of logic and ethics that has had an essential effect on all parts of Indian culture through ages; from the Upanishad period to the circumstances of Mahatma Gandhi. The philosophical thoughts that are regularly considered Indian are Karma, Ahimsa, Moksa, restoration; these began at the school of thought of Sramana or were disseminated and elaborated by the teachers of Jain. These ideas were later adapted to Hinduism and to different religions, regularly in an alternative framework and with different nuances of implications. The Jains have also had a major impact on the culture and language of Karnataka, southern India and Gujarat in general. The Jains are among the richest and the most generous Indians. The Present day and medieval Jains assembled numerous temples, particularly in western India. The most punctual Jain landmarks were temples in light of the Brahmanical Hindu temple design and cloisters for Jain ministers. Generally, specialists in antiquated India had a place with non-denominational societies which were set up to loan their administrations to any supporter, regardless of whether Hindu, Buddhist, or Jain. Large portions of the styles they utilized were an element of the time and place as opposed to the specific religion. Thus, Jain craftsmanship from this period is elaborately like Hindu or Buddhist workmanship, in spite of the fact that its subjects and iconography are particularly Jain. With some minor varieties, the western fashion of Indian craftsmanship continued all through the sixteenth century and until the seventeenth century. The rise of Islam was added to affect the Jain Art and Achitecture but did not affect its character that badly. Among the most important monuments of Jain are the caves of Udaygiri and Khandgiri, situated close to the city of Bhubaneshwar in Odisha, India. The Dilwara Temple complex consists of five intricate marble temples, each one dedicated to the Tirthankar. Among its most important components is the Rang Mandap, a magnificent passage maintained by twelve columns and crowned by an imposing central vault, and the navchowki, an accumulation of nine rectangular roofs, equally luxuriously cut. The columns in the main hall are cut into the similarities of the 2 Page #23 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ women playing melodic instruments and sixteen vidyadevis, or goddess; everyone has an image that speaks to his learning branch. ► Jainism is a trans-theistic religion endorsing peacefulness toward every living being; it started in the Indian subcontinent in the sixth century BC. ► Jainism has affected and added to numerous aesthetic circles in India, for example, painting, model, and Architecture. > Modern and medieval Jains fabricated numerous temples, particularly in the western India. The most punctual Jain landmarks were temples in view of the Brahmanical Hindu temple design and religious communities for Jain community. Among the important Jain point of interest are the Udaygiri and Khandgiri Caves in Odisha, rock cut caves as private squares for Jain monks were built in the midst of the leadership of King Kharavela of Kalinga (200- 170 BC). Built under Chalukya's supervision in Rajasthan between the years 11th and 13th CE, the Dilwara Temple complex includes five extravagant marble shrines cut; each product is a Tirthankar's place. > Ten sanctuaries in Pattadakal, Karnatakawith a Jain sanctuary, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. There is a combination of different construction styles of Hindu and Jain temple. > The Jain Shrine (Jain Narayana Shrine) was constructed by Rashtrakutas. It almost took the floor and height design after the Kailasnath shrine at Kanchipuram. It was a totally creative and admirable period of Dravida's design. ► Jains were, in the same way, skilled designers such as Hindu sanctuaries and shrines and excursion sites can be discovered throughout the country. The most important destination for Jains is Bihar region. 3 Page #24 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ In Deccan, probably the most important Jain temples are found in Ellora, Maharastraand Aihole, Karnataka. There are a number of important historical and unique temples and structure lying throughout the country. Specifically in the region of Bihar, we have a number of pilgrimage sites and temples with unique features. All these were recorded, but there is no information about the Architectural feature and style known. This work is an attempt to deliberate the work of Architecture of Bihar region. 1.3 REVIEW OF THE EXISTING LITERATURE Each style of building development reflects a clear central domain that addresses a specific culture and time. For instance, the firm and condition based building layout in Jain Architecture demonstrates an intricate tendency, anyway the building arranges for which is an important even by current measures depending upon their religion and legacy (Brown, 1942). As evidence from the ancient sacred texts of Jain, the sanctuary is the microcosm of the universe and the enormous application is considered fundamental for the human body, the psyche and the soul; with the individual a microcosm (Hardy, 2007). The structure of the Jain temple presents the basic data about the science and cosmology of the period in which they were produced. It is an image of the outer universe and the internal universe. In which the outer universe is conferred to such an extent that the galactic relationship varies between the structures of the temple. The movements of the sun, the moon and the planets, while the internal cosmos is directed with respect to the perception in the core of the temple. The distinctive levels of the superstructure contrast with the levels of consciousness (Kak, 2005). There were no cases of the use of vaults or arches in Hindu temple Architecture, however, curved specialties were made on the surface of the seperators and occasionally carried loads from above. In the middle of the Mauryan administration, the stone was used as a means for segments and statues. The Mauryan ruler Ashoka (268 BC-232 BC) used stone as a means of presenting the bill and resilience known as \"Dhamma\" through stone orders and section orders. The stone decrees were cut into the living rock, which later advanced towards the opportunity to be a source of comfort for the structural exercises in the stone (Beck, 2006). Page #25 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ The Tirthankars populated their skies with a segment of the divine creatures. Jain's temples, in the same way, required a great deal of images presented in unique style of Architecture and for a given region and period, the design of the Jain temple is still different from the design of other temples fundamentally for its iconography and for some surviving to its design (Hardy, 2007). The Chalukya-Rashtrakuta domain of the district toward the west understood the upper Deccan affiliations winding up greatly unmistakable from what obtained in the lower Deccan, in this way demonstrating two neighbourhood expressions. That was because the northern zone laid closer the destinations of the prior Jainism give in artistry and shake design. The abilities and customs that had won for over eight centuries among the close-by organizations of specialists like this proceeded in the ages that took up by Jain shake Architecture and surrender craftsmanship (Deglurkar). Pranoti Kiran Meghal (Meghal, 2018) introduced Jain Architecture from 5th century, which is still seen in different parts of Maharashtra. According to 2011 enumeration, biggest populace of Jain dwells in Maharashtra. The creation was finished in the Fifth century in the Architecture, and the arrangement of material is likewise changed. This change is unmistakably seen in the above case from Ellora caves and Anjaneri temples as of late developed by Shirdi temple. At the point when separated into locales, Marathwada and Western Maharashtra indicates maximum advancement of Jain Architecture from antiquated circumstances, while Khandesh demonstrates minimum improvement while Konkan zone demonstrates no improvement of Jain Architecture. Vidarbha indicates improvement of a wide range of Architecture besides cave Architecture. As it may be, with change in time, new temples are getting worked in all districts of Maharashtra including Konkan. Furthermore, they are developed by utilizing current material, procedures and arranging of ideas. 1.4 RATIONALE OF THE STUDY Art and Architecture for long have gone about as vehicles of communicating personality of a particular community or culture through their particular styles and attributes. An architectural style helps in keeping up notable coherence inside the limits of a particular culture, while again it likewise gives peculiarity to the shape in contrast with the surrounding assembled environment. All things considered, all Page #26 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ through the world, religion has propelled Architecture, which is obvious from the archeological records essentially in light of the fact that religious landmarks were frequently worked from more perpetual building materials (Flugel, 1999). The Temples are, an indispensable part of the Jain religious and social life. The Temples are more than a position of worship. They fill in as focus of education, meeting place and a rest house for the voyagers notwithstanding typifying the Tirthankars. The investigation of the Art and Architecture of the Jains has, lamentably, remained a subject of concern for architects and art historians. Since little work has been done on the Jain Architecture, the present work may end up being a search of its own style and uniqueness after critical analysis of Jain Caves of Odisha and Jain temples of Bihar and Jharkhand. There is a requirement for saving the tradition, and for expanding it through procedure of modernisation. Without a doubt, there is an earnest requirement for comprehensive documentation, top to bottom investigation and intensive research in the field of the Jain Architecture. 1.5 AIM OF THE STUDY ► Study Jainism through its history, ethics, values, culture and other important religions (Hindu, Islam, Buddhism, Shikhism) in India and elements of religious buildings. ► Study the influence of Jain religion and other parallel religious buildings on religious buildings and vice versa. ► Analyzing the elements of Jain Architecture in the Bihar region with reference to time and other religious buildings. > Identifying the changes in Architectural style / construction material occurred during the various periods. > Analyzing the influence of Jain Architecture on Regional Architecture.

H2: Jain Architecture influences the Architecture of other contemporary religion. H3: Jain Architecture influences the Architecture of Bihar region. H4: Jain Architecture has relation with the magnificent artistic creation. 1.9 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY Based on the problem of research, the present research work is divided into two parts. The first part of research is qualitative bottom up approach. In this, author attempt to understand Jain history, values, culture and ethics and try to relate its implication on Jain Architecture. As there are several religions in India, so the style of all these Hindu, Islamic, Budhhist, and Sikh religion and their Architecture with time period need to be understood. The author attempt to make a relation between their Architecture, which influences each other. It categorize Jain Architecture and its elements as native or nonnative to its style of Architecture. Second part of research is based on quantitative type. Details of all the sample caves and temples of Bihar region is collected in standard format as given in figure 1.2 and annexure VI (Inventory for Jain religion buildings under study in Bihar Region).

The Architectural features of all these temples and other structures of prayer is discussed. The research is limited to study of the Jain caves of Odisha and Jain temples of Bihar and Jharkhand. All these three Jainism centres are collectively termed as Bihar region in this research. The Khandgiri and Udaygiri caves of Odisha and Jain temples of Bihar and Jharkhand have been taken as the sample case study. The plan form, elevational form, interior and exterior features, building material and construction techniques of these structures and temples are covered under study. The analysis of these samples are only for the superstructure and not substructure. The major limitation is that, the research is essentially based on primary sources - opinion surveys, consultation with historians and archeologists and authors own case study as well as secondary sources - literature survey. Due to constraints in accessibility of certain sources, some information might have been omitted from the study. Therefore, the work is largely dependent on personal observation and understanding of the author as well as of the experts in various fields, along with subjective assessment of various fields of considerations. 1.11 OVERVIEW OF THESIS Chapter 1: Research Background Chapter 2: Jainism and Its Relevance to Architecture Chapter 3: Indian Major Religion, Timeline and Its Relevance to Architecture and Elements Chapter 4: The Jain Temple Chapter 5: The Geometry of Jain Temple Chapter 6: Dimensional Analysis Chapter 7: Influence of Jain Architecture on Regional Architecture Chapter 8: Inference 11 Page #32 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ CHAPTER 2 JAINISM AND ITS RELEVANCE TO ARCHITECTURE 2.1 ORIGIN OF JAINISM Adinath or Rishabh Dev is \"considered as the harbinger of human progress. Since he presented the Karma-bhumi (the season of development); set up the social foundations of marriage, family, law, esteem, state, and so on. He demonstrated mankind the headway of land, unmistakable articulations and claims to distinction, analyzing, composing and number juggling; amassed towns and urban communities; and essentially, drove the various types of activities with a view to give another sort of social demand suggested for developing the welfare of human animals\". The Jain most of the time express that the indigenous name of India, that is BhArat, comes after the name of Bharat the eldest son of Lord Rishabh Dev. He had surrendered his position of remarkable quality and had denied the world for plausibility; his other discernible young son was Bahubali, who is on the same path adored by the Jain, but not as a Tirthankar. From now on, the other twenty-three Tirthankars that ended with the Lord Sri Mahavir followed the Lord Sri Rishabh Dev. A time-line spread of Jain religion in India from the 500 BC till present date is shown in figure 2.1. As per the census 2011 presently Maharashtra has highest population of Jains in India, followed by Delhi, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and other states. Bihar region (Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha) have only 1.02% of Jain Population. As it is evidence that, the Jain religion first started in Bihar and spread to other parts of India. 2.1.1 Jain Architecture The dedication of Jain Architecture to standard art in India has been remarkable. The extensive Jain temples and the extraordinary framed purposes of Karnataka, Maharashtra and Rajasthan are acclaimed worldwide. The Jain Architecture cannot be confirmed by its particular exceptional style, since it was only a branch of Hindu and Buddhist styles. In significant years, several Jain temples were built that flanked the Buddhist temples following the style of the Buddhist beating cut. In the beginning, these temples were regularly cleaned up by the shake faces and the use of squares in every 12 Page #33 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ realistic sense was immaterial. However, in recent years, Jains have begun to build temple urban groups on slopes in light of the likelihood of accumulation of propagation.

Source: (Author) Shown variously in association with the extension of Hindu temples in India, the Jain temples are few and remain outside. The latter used to break down the more stable, demolished temples, and build new ones on a relative site. Naturally, the Jain temples had a specific quality of assailant around them. The reason is that the temples of Jains are the richest temples on the planet, even surpassing the Mughal structures. 13 Page #34 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ Interior design of Jain temples The dedication of the Jains to the craftsmanship and the setting was extremely important in shaping the famous dazzling appearances, particularly in the type of paintings, temples and representations scattered throughout the country and covering a period of exploration in the perception from more reliable until time limit. The settlement of the Indus Valley (around 2300-1750 BC) is India's most provoked human progress. Mohen-Jo-Daro male seal figure also indicates existence of Jain religion (Shah, 1998, p. 3). In the third century BC, the exposed and kayotsarga-mudra, which proposed the full gravity of photography, were related only to Jin. In the 1st century, with the figure of Parsvanatha, scheduled dhyanamudra inside, is in the collection of the State Museum of Lucknow. In the middle of the period, new structures and iconographic features (except the Jin) of various deities were pointed. The parikara (casing) of the images of Jin is also made up of figurative frames Navagrahas, Sarashwati, Lakshmi and small figure Jin. Furthermore, the standard figures Astapratiharyas and yaksa-yaksi have been cut in the same way. Precision and folding near ornaments and other distinctive ornaments are parts of the Jain medieval figures (Pal, 1996). Lord Parshavanath Figure: 2.2 - Lord Parshavanath Statue Source: (Samet-Shikhar, 2018) 14 Page #35 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ Jain craftsmanships and works have the fundamental objectives of keeping up-to-date, protecting and extensively recommending the lifestyle. Palitana is a standout among the different habitats for a meeting of icons. At one point recently, all the Jin icons were uncovered, with no signs of identification, in any case, later had inscriptions such as a lion (Mahavira), a hooded cobra (Parshavanath) and a bull (Rishabhadev) and so on occasionally without eight promising images on both sides to see the confirmation prints. The photographs of various lesser heavenly creatures were in like way intertwined they included demigods etc (Eliade, 1961). This symbolizes that craftsmanship is particularly basic in the conditions of Gujarat and Rajasthan in India. The temple that makes manpower is equally notable in Jain's Achitecture. The great design and the Jain figure are found in the caves excavated in Mathura, Bundelkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha. In Udaigiri and Khandgiri various caves have been found. A piece of cells has cutting grids on the spacers. In a little bit of the cell, the floor rises to the back to fill it like a pillow. A couple of cells has low levels for the beds (Eliot, 1962). The extension of the cells is centered with authorities that receive enough light, and the cells open on a tunnel. The natural spaces of Udaygiri in some of caves have two floors and a patio in the front. The best and most beautiful of the caves of Udaigiri is cave - 1 called Rani-Gumpha or Rani. (Gumpha, the word of the area to be kept). The design of the campus is rectangular, arranged on three sides of a quadrant. The highest portion of the verandah expands outward like a ledge (eaves). The areas have been cut to support the roof of the house and give the holes an effect of essential homes. Lower storey has a cell with three small caves and a gallery with columns. Two dwarpalas (guards) are prepared ready to secure on both sides of the verandah. Despite the way the columns have been separated, the capitals must be discovered with bulls and carved lions. The way to the cells are determined by the themes of the lotus and the vines that come out of the mouth of the animals. The cutout friezes that represent the social theme of a master who returns successfully from a fight embellish the rear partitions of the galleries. Work in upper 15 Page #36 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ storey is superior to that of lower storey. The shape of the Tirthankars cut into cell separators is a subsequent expansion to the Khandgiri. Jain Architecture in the History of India The Jains, who have contributed to the craft and design field since the early days. Statues of Tirthankar Risabhadeva and figure revealed yogis or key uncovered ideas recorded on some ceramic seals. Artifacts from the ancient Indus Valley civilization found in Mohenjodaro, and beyond the denudated red stone statue are equivalently old. The last one is remarkably similar to focus stone to clean up the image of Jain of Lohanipur (Patna), sometimes attributed Mauryan (fourth BC). King Kharavela of Kalinga as engravings Hathigumpha, who has restored the image of Jain taken from Magadha to (4th century BC). During the period of Satavahana (60 BC to 225 AD), Mathura and Saurastra were the central reign (Shah, 1998, pp. 3-7). In the Gupta period It is said that the Gupta period (from 4th to 7th AD) was the splendid time of ancient Indian culture. After the period of Gupta; Kakkula, Vatsaraja and Mahendrapala were Jains rulers in the Pratihara line. Chittod was the capital of Paramaras where Kalakacarya and Haribhadra gave their lives for the change of craftsmanship and design. Jains, in the middle of Candela, Khajuraho, Devagadh, Mahoba, Madanapur, Canderi, Ahar, Papora and Gwalior line wrapped around celebrating his Jainism craftsmanship. Some essential incisions, toranas, images and other sculptural material can be found in Tripuri. As noted in recent times, the status of Bihar has been evident from the early days with regard to Jain culture (Shah, 1998, pp. 13-16). East India Jainism has a long history since the ninth century BC just like the 23rd Dharma Chaturyam Tirthankar Sri Parshvanath, who focused on Satya (truth), Ahimsa (quiet), Achaurya (not taken) and Aparigraha (non-possessiveness) that was served. Chaturyam Dharma was the pioneer of Sri Mahavir's religious and social demand. The Eastern India as needed are unequivocally preserved in the ancient history of Jainism. Jainism had a phenomenal support in the time of King Chetaka, the pioneer of Vaishali, Bimbisar (Shrenika) and king Ajatshtru of Shishunaga (642-413 BC), the rulers of 16 Page #37 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ nandas (413-322 BC) and the emperor Chandragupta Maurya (322-298 B.C.) of the Maurya dynasty. In this context, it is also proposed that Jainism was on a similar path slandered by Emperor Ashoka before it was changed to Buddhism. He also helped to spread Jainism in Kashmir. Ashoka's nephew, Emperor Samprati was on a similar path, extended his help to Jainism (Ghosh, 1974, p. 69). South India Jainism reaches south India at Shravanbelagola 300 BC due to drought in Bihar region for the long time. The sangh moved to south under the leadership of Acharya Bhudrabahu. The sovereign Chandragupta Maurya was part of the sangh. Jainism also made an \"obligation concerning the realization and gigantic during the Vijayanagar Empire (1336-1565 C.E.) (Ghosh, 1974, p. 92). West India The improvement of the Jains from the eastern part to the western part of India did not produce any vulnerability at some time in the third century BC. Taking after the diminution of the influence of Jain in the Maurya Empire. Some ideas of the relic of Jainism in the West India by the way in which Lord Neminath, the twenty-second Tirthankar of the Jain had attended the salvation on Mount Girnar in the Junagarh area of Gujarat in the second millennium BC. \"In addition, ancient academic statements claim that Lord Sri Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankar, had gone to the place of Marathavada and Maharastra in the middle of his religious journey to various parts of India\". The main group of religious seriousness Jain met in Vallabhi and expressly expressed the Jain law. Maharashtra from the third century onwards, \"the decision arrangements equipped Satavahanas of Paithans, Chalukyas of Kalyan, Rastrakutas of Malakhed, Yadava of Devagiri and Silaharas of Kolhapur and Konkan increased their praise praised to a huge extent to the Jain religion\". Jains in Maharastra claim to have four essential Siddhakshetras (places where Tirthankars or blessed individuals in particular, to have nirvana) in Gajapantha (Nasik District), Magitungi (Khamdesh District), Kunthalagiri (Osmanabad District) and Muktagiri (Amraoti District) (Ghosh, 1974, p. 85). Page #38 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ North India With minor special cases, all of the finished Jainism structures was to be impeded to ensure sublime help in the middle of a couple of times fundamental to Muslim control in northern India. As part of its Din-e-Elahi approach, Mughal emperor Akbar was clearly dedicated for Jainism. He had rejected the butchering of animals between the days of Paryushan in 1583 CE. At first, Jahangir had denied this course of action. Again announced the same in 1610 CE. The sovereign Shahjahan was more tolerant of Jainism and allowed a Jain Temple to construct first. Jains have contributed the structural parts of the Red Fort at New Delhi and in the same way; they traded with the inhabitants of the area (Ghosh, 1974, p. 143). 2.1.2 Sects in Jainism Even in this case Jainism was not an unprecedented case. Spreading expansive parts of India, shifting the clarifications of Jain's statutes, and limiting current leaders, at the time caused the marked areas and sub-fragments within Jainism in different inspirations that led time in its long history. The most fundamental sects in Jainism are known as Digamber and Swetamber groups. The division of sects took place is about 600 years after Lord Sri Mahavira's nirvana. Bhagwan Mahaveer (599-527 BCE) Shvetambar Digambar Taranpanth (Ca 1490) Lonka Sect 1452 CE Sthanakvasi 1653 CE Terapanth (1760 CE) Kanjiswami (1889-1981) Terahpanth (1626 CE) Terapanth Deravasi Murtipujak Sthanakvasi Rajchandra Sub-sects Kanjipanth Bisapanth Terakpanth Tarampanth Figure: 2.3 - Jainism: Major Sects and Sub-sects Source: (Sect division, n.d.) 18 Page #39 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ Sub-sects of Digamber There are three basic subsections within the Digamber Jain, which are in particular Bisapantha, Terapantha, and Taranpantha. Bisapanth This is the main extraordinary sub-sect (appreciating the image) of the janism of Digamber, whose devotees strengthen the relationship of Bhattarak (head of religious or mythological meetings) that flourished in the medieval period from the fourteenth to the nineteenth century. The temple is based on cult icons of Kshetrapals, Padmawati and other deities along with those of the Tirathankaras. The Bisapanthi \"appreciate these icons with saffron, fragrant agargianti. (Sangave, 2006). Terapanth This reformist sub-group began within Bisapantha sooner or later in the middle of the seventeenth century as a restriction on the control and direction of the Bhattaraka. Hence, his motivation compares in the same way after the improvement of Adhyatma in northern India. As shown Lath \"the Terapanth itself a branch of the Adhyatma of Banarsi proclaims quickly, and inverts its Adiguru, the creator instructor\". In their temples, the Terapanthis show symbols Tirathankaras and not of Kshetrapalas, Padmawati and various deities. They worship icons with sustenance created by the oldest plant (known as sachitta), with the holy rice called 'Aksata', nails of carnation, stick sandle, almonds, dry coconuts, dates, etc. Taranpanth This non-reverential subquestion was created by Taran Swamy (1448-1515 C.E.), who suffered from Islam from the point of view and lessons of Lonka Shah, the coordinator of the subsection of meaning Sthnakvasi of Jainism Swetamber from the other. In their temples, Taranpanthis worship blessed coordinator fourteen books, near consecrated books Digamber Jainism. As for the station's capabilities, the Taranpanthis are surprisingly liberal and other Digamber subsections. Page #40 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ Shrimad Rajchandra 'Sub-Sect' Shrimad Rajchanda (formal name Rajchandbhai Ravjibhai Shri Mehta) was considered to be the who started this sect. \"The different emotions and practices of Mahatma Gandhi began from the position of his Rajchandra Gandhi organization towards the adjustment of women, the opportunity to reduce positions, Satyagraha (battle of truth) and was developed for Rajchandra. Kanji Swamy Panth In recent decades, another sub-band called Kanji Panth Swamy has emerged in Digamber Jainism, known by its creator, Kanji Swamy. The nischaya-Naya provides a supplement on discernment and a true method for the evaluation of the spirit with a perspective of refinement; in any case, the vyavahar-Naya is a short point or brief passenger leading us to modify the problems of useful life in daily existence. Highlighting the past, the Kanji-Panth obviously needs to force religious traditions into Jainism (Fischer, Jain, & Jyotindra, 1977). The panth is similarly not perfect for the state exposed in Jainism. It is much celebrated with the educated class and the diasporic encounter, and its effect has spread widely. In any case, another interesting conclusion is that \"the poorer and smaller Digambers tend to strengthen the KSP\". However, the Kanji Panth has made a clear division within the social order of Digamber Jain in the north and center of India. The intellectuals took for granted rejecting the Anekantavada instruction in this context the tendency of a naya to the heaviness of Sonagarh. Moreover, Jaipur and Mumbai are the basic convergences of Kanji-Panth. Sub-Sects Swetamber As a Digamber, Swetamber Jain also isolated in three sub-sects imperatives, for particular Murtipujak, Sthanakavasi and Terapanth. These are quickly discussed as below: 20 Page #41 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ Murtipujak Murtipujakas (these people generally called Dera-vases or Chaitya-vases (Temple tenants), Mandir-Margi (frequented the temple) or Pujera (fans) were the main source of Swetamber Jainism. Recovered Tirthankars icons are extravagant decorated with materials. It is complete with flowers, common things, saffron and other things. Both male and female, religious severity wear white cloths and mouth covered with cloths while talking, otherwise keep them in hands and remain in temples or in specially preserved structures known as Upashrayas estimators of this subgroup are mostly concentrated in Gujarat, but constantly now also found in most of the cities gigantic and urban groups of India. Sthanakvasi This group was initially known as the Lonka petition developed by Lonka Shah in Ahmedabad in 1474 C.E. it was then updated in 1653 CE by a layman based in Surat, Viraji. Around that time, the devotees were known as Dhundiliyas (seekers). Sthanakavasis do not place values in the construction of temples, a symbol of love and excursion. The life of the monks uses white cloths and cover the mouth with superficial stripes. Sthanakvasis are generally found in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana. Terapanth A branch of the sub-association Sthnakvasi, Terapanthi sub-sect was developed in 1760 AD. Acharya Bhikanji like Sthnakvasis, even Terapanthis have no confidence in symbolizing appreciation. Since its inception nearly 250 years ago, it has been solidly administered with less than eleven progressive Acharyas del Panth, including the current occupant Acharya Mahashraman. His ninth pro-Acharya Tulsi (1914-1997) had earned a great name and distinction for his development of Anubrata, who emphasized five small guarantees in Jainism for the proper flourishing of the masses. For the most part, especially by accumulating areas of Rajasthan, Terapanthis are similarly a bit honest and urban communities in northern and central India (Fischer K. , 1957). To add, there is nothing surprising that a religion indicating Anekantvad (fundamental relativisim) should have such a variety of sects and sub-seven and that even with assortments of controversies and experiences occurring within and between them. In 21 Page #42 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ addition to responses including doctrinal feelings and differentiations, open considerations, conflicts and heat modes, also have been observed and clashes between Digamber and Swetamber for even the obligation related to places. Jain Architecture Associations All Jain cults, sects and sub-classifications have their specific affiliations whose annual social affairs are managed locally, nationally or internationally. It subordinates to the level of the alliance and the needs of the moment, think of a wide range of issues related to the meeting at these events and social traditions. Thus, for example, around Bharatvarshiya Digamber Jain Mahasabha, for several years, had considered endless questions. For example, the need to maintain a specific character of the Jains recovery and proper maintenance of Jain sites. A prerequisite for social change within the meeting, especially as regards the marriage of young people, the sharing of framework development houses and homes for disadvantaged people. Education and opportunities for women; enthusiasm for Mahavir Jayanti's declaration as an open possibility in 1939 and shortly thereafter, in the mid-1950s; fortifying for the developments of Satyagraha, Swadeshi and habitual challenge of Mahatma Gandhi. The possibility, in a Jains tradition required another constitutive role and delimitation of the Council, in any case, has not increased (Flugel, Peter, 1995-96). 2.2 JAIN COSMOLOGY As indicated by the Jain-doctrine, the world is eternal and ephemeral. It listens just to its own laws and stays unaltered in its essential nature despite the fact that its parts change. No god has made it, ruled it and can destroy it. As opposed to most different religions, since Jains deny most unquestionably the existence of an imperishable, allforceful most noteworthy \"Lord\" who creates the universe, rules it, and destroys it. The acknowledgment of a creator and destroyer appears to them to be unjustified and selfcontradictory and must be rejected both from the perspective of logic and profound quality The perspectives on the nature of god are altogether different among the individual. Indian and non-Indian systems, which Jains have questioned and do as such, even at this point. Most importantly, Hinduism has delivered a wealth of different doctrines on god and his association with the world. Doctrines, which seem to have depleted every 22 Page #43 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ one of the conceivable outcomes of considering, begun with the outrageous monotheism, which makes the most honed qualification between god, matter and souls. Up to the absolute best theophany for which the world is an unfilled appearance and god is everything. Three sorts of belief in god can be principally recognized. The primary view: God is a perfect, omniscient, all-powerful, inescapable, kind and favored element. Which creates and destroys the world, which is too generic but not the same as it is and controls autonomously the souls and substances in it. This view, which is to be sure near Christianity and of Islam. It has been pushed especially by the NyayaVaisesika-rationalists and the scholars of various Vaisnavite and Saivite sects. A moment gathering of systems educates: matter and souls are doubtlessly unique in relation to god at the season of the origin of the world and are managed by him. In any case, they have risen originally from god; god has formed himself into them and takes them back again into himself. These hypotheses have been proposed by the Vaisnavite and Saivtaism schools in the most extraordinary ways (Flugel, 1999, pp. 7-75). The third view at long last takes a gander at god, Brahma, as the main genuine sat, the total. The majority of the marvels in the world are just a Maya, a fantasy, which is \"developed\" from the supreme being by the oblivious; actually, every soul is indistinguishable with God, and all distinction is just an illusionary appearance, as incredible as a fantasy or a Fata Morgana. An acosmic theophany of this sort experienced its weighty improvement in Sarikara's Advaita-philosophy; yet it is additionally found among Vaisnavas, Saivas, and Saktas and in other Indian systems. Jain-savants considered inside and out every one of these doctrines and attempted to discredit them in the most acuminous way. The suspicion that the world must have a creator originates from the origination that it is a product, similar to a pot; and precisely in this way, similar to the products having a cause, the world all in all must likewise have one. As an evidence for this that the world is to be likened with natural products, it is said that it is liable to change like those. If this somehow happened to be right, then god should likewise be a product, in light of the fact that specific changes must also occur in it on account of the movement of making, pulverizing, and so on practised. 23 Page #44 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ 2.3 SPREAD OF JAINISM WITH TIME > Lord Sri Mahaveer, the last Tirthankar is generally regarded as the founder of Jain religion. ► There are twenty-four jinas or saints who were attained nirvana and possessed high place in Jain Architecture. ► Jina implies \"conqueror\" or, then again \"leader\" from which the Jain is determined. One particular variety found in Jain temples is that they are four confronted or \"chaumukh”. Thus rather than a solitary figure with single face, one path, with one access to the cell, they gave a fourfold picture or a gathering of four different Tirthankars. > This requires the holy place chamber with four entryways, which influenced impressively the layout design of temples. 2.3.1 Jain Architecture (3rd century B.C-17th century AD) ► Jains exploited its necessity in the construction of the outside and fit as a shape of vimana. ► They presented the colonnaded gathering of little places of worship around the four sides of the courtyard in which the primary temple stands. Eight to twelve columns are masterminded as an octagonal set inside a square. The dome is supported by these columns joined by section sort raking struts. The dome is built on flat courses with successively reducing square, laid corner to corner to each other, with \"Amalaka\" or, on the other hand decorative \"Kalasa\" at the top. > Another innovation was the construction of flawlessly cut and marbled roof with central pendants practically like light fixtures in their delicacy and grace. Page #45 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ 2.4 GODS AND CULTS Jainism adopts worship of Shakti in a number of structures. These structures might be placed in isolation in temple. Goddesses worshipped in Jainism: A. Less Known Goddesses: 1. Mothers of Tirthankars. 2. Goddess of Knowledge. 3. Dikkumaris. 4. Laxmi B. Broadly known Goddesses: 5. Shasandevis or Shasansundaris 6. Saraswati 7. Prabodhit Devis or Dixit Devis. The Jain philosophy perceives importance of gods and goddesses. The perceptions put forward in a few books, mantras, yantras and stotras plainly state it. On the off chance that look painstakingly, one may discover at each Jain temple gods and goddesses speaking to the chief God. They are defenders of the soul of the chief God. To start with comes a line of Tirthankars that makes a sum of twenty-four Tirthankars. They are: Table: 2.1 - Twenty four Tirthankar's detail.

The Jain econography of B. C. Bhattacharya notices sixteen \"Vidhyadevis\", goddesses of knowledge who are less known. There are \"Dikkumarikas\" who incorporate \"Shrim\", \"Hrim\", \"Kirti\", \"Biddhi\" and \"Laxmi\". All the Tirthankars are related with \"Yakshas\" and \"Yakshinis\". Among the Yakshinis, those like Sri Chakkeshwari, Jwalamukhi, Ambika, and Padmavati are worshipped on a more extensive scale. Specially, Goddess padmavati who is a \"Shasandevi\" of the twenty-third Tirthankar, Sri Parshvanath. In the eleventh century of the Vikram era, Shri Nayavimalsuri addresses the goddess as Saraswati, Durga, Tara, Shakti, Aditi, Laxmi, Kali, Tripursundari, Bhairavi, Ambika and Kundalini. In this manner, worship of goddess Padmavati in Jainism might be identified with worship of Shakti in Hinduism (Fohr, 2001). To worship this goddess, a few stotras, \"kalpas\", supplications, and psalms are written. An investigation of Jain goddesses uncovers that these goddesses do an imperative work of quiet down obstacles and pressures and to produce welfare for individuals. These goddesses of Jainism are similarly more \"satvik\" or spiritual, sobre and peaceful by nature. Jainism is not a worshipper of God, but rather it proliferates worship of Tirthankars. Masters and ministers are worshipped as gods. Jain temples have idols of goddesses as objects of worship. The worship indicates similitude in strategies with routine about contemplation and mantra scriptures. Hemachandrasuri's \"Yogashastra\" acknowledges worship of Shakti and its practice with mantras. For example, the \"Namskar-Mahamantra\" contains the sole embodiment of the Jain confidence. It contains the quintessence of the whole \"Dwadashanga Vani\". The NamaskarMahamantra consolidates in it knowledge like 'Tatva', Padarth', 'Dravya', 'Guna', Page #47 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ 'Paryay', 'Nay', 'Nikshep', and so on. The whole mantra scriptures of Jainism have risen out of these mahamantras. Any strategy worship perceives essentiality of mantra. Add up to responsibility, patience, inclusion, confidence, certainty and progressions are the cardinal standards of worship by mantras. Mantras like Biamantra, Kutamantra, Shatakshari, Sahasrakshari, Malamantra, Pauranik mantra, Nama mantra Shabar mantra, Rishimantra, Siddhaguru mantra, and so on are among well-known mantras. The reality of the matter is that worship by mantra benefits a worshipper with achievements and success. The Jain philosophy states that unique worship and custom for Goddess Padmavati empowers one to secure forces of mantras and particular results are created with them. The Namaskar Mahamantra goes this way: This Jain Paramanta pays respect to the five Supreme Elements like: 1. Arhat, 2. Siddha, 3. Acharya, 4. Upadhyaya, 5. Sadhu. The mahamantra acknowledges presence of the God, Guru and religion. To worship this mahamantra is tantamount to worshipping the God, Guru and religion. 2.5 SUMMARY The current state of anthropological / sociological writing unequivocally prescribes the need for more accurate research of Jainism and the group of Jains, which relates it to the development of its own style of Architecture. Obviously, there is a fundamental need to recognize data gaps in the anthropological / sociological examinations of the Jain group. The collection of a good record of reference in the group of Jainism people should be the main walk that is worth mentioning to build a considerable variety of human sciences compared to the subject. In addition to human examinations and social sciences, history, political science and demography are different controls that can also improve the human science research of the group of Jain people and the Architectural style. Page #48 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ CHAPTER 3 INDIAN MAJOR RELIGION, TIMELINE AND ITS RELEVANCE TO ARCHITECTURE AND ELEMENTS 3.1 HINDU ARCHITECTURE Hindu Architecture has advanced for hundreds of years from the simple slice of sake into sacred places to gigantic and sumptuous temples that extend across the Indian subcontinent and past, giving shape to a canonical style that is still maintained in current Hindu temples throughout the world. The basic components of the style are the exact and congruent geometry when viewed from each of the four sides or more, the square structure and the terrain drawing of the net, removing the towers and exposing the improved mold that incorporates divine beings, worshipers, erotic scenes, botanical and geometric animals and examples. Hinduism did not have a specific organizer as in Christianity or Islam. It subsumed each marvel in the immense domain of India, including even neighborhood beliefs and tribal gods, so they could even be contradictory to each other. As indicated by Hindu hypothesis, even Buddhism and Jainism are only orders of Hinduism (Banerjea, 1941). In the field of Architecture as well, those of Buddhism and Jainism, which were raised is an indistinguishable climate from that of Hinduism, have no incredible aberrations from Hindu Architecture, making it conceivable to state that their structural systems and types of their parts are totally the same. 3.1.1 Beginning and Purpose Since the 4th AD, another type of cult or reverential known as Bhakti Hinduism develops on India subcontinent, and the ancient Vedic divine beings have been supplanted by Gods like Shiva, Vishnu, Krishna, Brahma and Devi. The sanctuary was seen as the residence of a specific god (devalaya). Hindus do not need to go to consistent services, but an accidental walk around the inner sanctuary, known as pradaksina and completed clockwise, was considered positive. Temples have inevitably become the particular focal objective of a network and, as required, maintenance is assured using rewards and 28 Page #49 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ blessings of the type of decision, as evidenced by the numerous temples registered (Rao, 1993). 3.1.2 Early Influences At that point, with the landing of the Gupta project in the 400-500 AD, the main Hindu temples without ties were produced with reflections, such as towers and previous niches. The main materials used were wood and ceramics; however the designer's little by little in blocks and stones, mainly sandstone, rock, and marble. No mortar was used as part of the more seasoned techniques, so a precise cut of the coated stones was necessary. The extraordinary cases of persuasives in temples merge those of Udaygiri in Malwa and date back to the fifth century of our era. The first detached temples will expire in Deogarh and will establish the 600 CE Dasavatara sanctuary dedicated to Vishnu.

Source: (Chidambaram-northgopuram-navalingashrine, 2016) Early temples comprised of just a garbhagriha, however after some time increases were made in constructed and duplicated crosswise over temple sites to make an accepted architectural style by the tenth century AD. The most evident of these highlights were a patio entrance (ardhamandapa) and pillared lobby (mandapa) which prompted the garbhagriha - highlights which created in the Deccan from the eighth century AD. Significantly more amazing, over the garbhagriha, a colossal corbelled pinnacle shikhara was developed. 30 Page #51 -------------------------------------------------------------------------- ________________ Figure: 3.3 - Brihadeeswarar Temple, Tanjavur. Source: (Brihadeeswarar-temple, 2015) 3.3 TIMELINE OF HINDU ARCHITECTURE The forerunner of Hinduism is called Brahmanism, in which just Brahmans (priests), the most astounding class among four varnas into which individuals were partitioned by birth in antiquated India, could middle of the road amongst gods and believers. It was basically a religion of ceremonies stressing penances of creatures to gods. On the opposite side, Buddhism and Jainism were agnostic religions built up around the sixth century BC in logical inconsistency to the standing framework and the conciliatory practices of Brahmanism, so their temples were in a general sense spots of seeking after illumination for monks and explaining lessons to laypeople.
