In recognition of his assistance in defeating the Rashtrakutas, Chalukyan emperor Tailapa II appointed Kadamba Shasthadeva as the provincial governor (Mahamandaleshwara) of Goa.\n\nIn 960 AD, Shasthadeva captured the city of Chandavara from the Shilaharas and later seized control of the port of Gopakapattana, which is present-day Goa.\n\nTalara Nevayya’s son Gundayya may have fought alongside Shasthadeva in the conquest of the port but died in the battle after successfully capturing it.\n\nCoins from Indian kings like Krishnaraja Wodeyar III, Krishnadevaraya, various Satavahana kings, and Viraraya of the Hoysala kingdom have been discovered.\n\nAmong the foreign coins found are denarii of Roman ruler Augustus Caesar and a coin of Chinese Han dynasty Emperor Wu Ti.\n\nGeographical Aspects:\n\nThe area is semi-arid with scrub vegetation and a stream running through it.\n\nThese caves are surrounded by three hills: Chitradurga, Kirabanakallu, and Jolagudda.\n\nGet an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024\n\nAttend Now\n\nHistorical and Archaeological Findings in News\n\nLeang Karampuang Cave is the World’s Oldest Cave Art\n\nNote4Students\n\nFrom UPSC perspective, the following things are important :\n\nPrelims level: About Leang Karampuang Cave\n\nMains level: Key features of the Cave Paintings\n\nWhy in the News?\n\nA cave painting discovered in the limestone cave of Leang Karampuang on Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, dates back at least 51,200 years.\n\nThe painting features a scene with three part-human, part-animal figures interacting with a wild pig, depicted in red pigment.\n\nStudy Details:\n\nPublished in the journal Nature, the study titled ‘Narrative cave art in Indonesia by 51,200 years ago’ used a new dating technique to determine the age of the artwork.\n\nThe study involved 23 researchers from Griffith University, Southern Cross University, and the Indonesian National Research and Innovation Agency.\n\nUse of Uranium-based Dating:\n\nA new dating technique utilizes uranium series (U-series) analysis on calcite deposits above cave art.\n\nThe laser-based analysis measures uranium-thorium ratios to accurately date paintings, highlighting significant age revisions for cave art in Sulawesi.\n\nAbout Leang Karampuang Cave\n\nLeang Karampuang Cave is situated in the Maros-Pangkep karst region of South Sulawesi, Indonesia.\n\nThe cave is renowned for its ancient rock art and archaeological findings, providing insights into early human civilization in the region.\n\nIt features some of the oldest known hand stencils and paintings of animals, believed to be created by early humans.\n\nKey features of the Cave Paintings:\n\nA painted scene depicting humans interacting with a pig on the cave wall.\n\nThe artwork features a pig standing upright alongside three smaller human-like figures, all painted in a single shade of dark red pigment.\n\nThis painting predates the cave art found in El Castillo, Spain, dating back around 40,800 years ago, marking it as older than European cave paintings.\n\nSignificance of the Painting\n\nAccording to researchers, the figures in the painting depict dynamic action, suggesting a narrative or story being told.\n\nThe discovery pushes back the origin of figurative art among Homo sapiens, indicating a rich history of storytelling through visual art in early human societies.\n\nWhile Neanderthals began cave markings earlier, around 75,000 years ago, these were primarily non-figurative.\n\nThe Sulawesi cave art suggests an advanced cultural and artistic development among early humans, predating similar European art by millennia.\n\nContemporary Period in the Indian Subcontinent:\n\nHomo sapiens had already migrated to various parts of the Indian subcontinent by this time.\n\nEvidence suggests human habitation in India dates back to at least 70,000 years ago, with notable archaeological sites like Bhimbetka in Madhya Pradesh showing signs of early human activity and rock art.\n\nGet an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024\n\nAttend Now\n\nHistorical and Archaeological Findings in News\n\nSignificance of ‘Abhaya Mudra’\n\nNote4Students\n\nFrom UPSC perspective, the following things are important :\n\nPrelims level: Various mudras of Buddha\n\nWhy in the News?\n\nThe Leader of Opposition invoked the Abhaya Mudra in his inaugural address as Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha.\n\nWhat is Abhay Mudra?\n\nAbhaya mudra, the motif of an open palm (gesturing to stop), is prevalent across many South Asian religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism.\n\nKnown as the ‘fearlessness gesture’, ‘abhaya’ in Sanskrit means fearlessness. The gesture symbolizes protection and peace.\n\nIn yoga circles, the abhaya mudra is believed to promote courage and reduce fear and anxiety.\n\nWhile common across many religions, the abhaya mudra is most prominently featured in Buddhism, especially in Thailand and Laos, where it is associated with images of the walking Buddha.\n\nOrigins of the Gesture\n\nAccording to Stanford University, the gesture of an open palm pointed outwards appears to be a natural gesture used since prehistoric times as a sign of good intentions and peace.\n\nThe gesture also asserted power in antiquity, similar to the magna manus of the Roman Emperors who legislated and gave peace simultaneously.\n\nThe motif likely originated from a universal gesture associated with human communication, eventually integrating into major South Asian religions.\n\nEvolution of Mudras in Buddhism\n\nFor about 500 years after the Buddha, he was not depicted in physical form.\n\nEarly representations appeared around the first millennium, influenced by Gandhara and Gupta art.\n\nWith the evolution of these Buddhist traditions, hundreds of mudras entered Buddhist iconography.\n\nIn tantric Buddhist traditions, mudras symbolized material offerings, enacted forms of worship, or relationships with visualized deities. (as shown in the above diagram)\n\nSignificance of ‘Abhaya Mudra’ in Buddhism:\n\nIn Buddhism, the abhaya mudra is linked to a legend involving Devadatta, a cousin of the Buddha, who tried to murder the Buddha by losing a rampaging elephant into his path.\n\nThe Buddha calmed the elephant by displaying the abhaya mudra, indicating appeasement of the senses and the absence of fear.\n\nThe gesture is popularly pronounced in Buddhist cultures, symbolizing fearlessness and peace.\n\nSignificance of ‘Abhaya Mudra’ in Hindu Religion:\n\nThe Buddha was absorbed into the Hindu pantheon as the 9th incarnation of Vishnu.\n\nHindus regarded the Buddha as an avatar of Vishnu between AD 450 and the sixth century, with the first mention in the Vishnu Purana (400-500 CE).\n\nThe abhaya mudra appears in depictions of Hindu deities, commonly seen in images of Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu, and Lord Ganesha.\n\nGet an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024\n\nAttend Now\n\nHistorical and Archaeological Findings in News\n\nUNESCO World Heritage Site of Somanathapura\n\nNote4Students\n\nFrom UPSC perspective, the following things are important :\n\nPrelims level: Keshava Temple, Somanathapura; Hoysala Architecture.\n\nWhy in the News?\n\nKarnataka’s Tourism Department plans to highlight Somanathapura Temple, part of the Hoysala temples, in the Mysuru tourism circuit ahead of Dasara, leveraging its UNESCO World Heritage status.\n\nThe Somanathapura Temple, along with other Hoysala temples such as the Chennakeshava Temple at Belur and the Hoysaleshwara Temple at Halebid, (called ‘Sacred Ensembles of the Hoysala’) was granted UNESCO WHS in September 2023.\n\nNote: There are 42 World Heritage Sites in India. Out of these, 34 are cultural, seven are natural, and one, Khangchendzonga National Park, is of mixed type.\n\nAbout Keshava Temple, Somanathapura\n\nThe Keshava Temple is considered one of the last grand structures built by the Hoysala dynasty.\n\nThis Trikuta (three-shrined) temple is dedicated to Lord Krishna and is represented in three forms: Janardhana, Keshava, and Venugopala.\n\nThe main Keshava idol is missing, and the Janardhana and Venugopala idols are damaged.\n\nHistorical Background:\n\nThe Keshava Temple was constructed by Somanatha, a commander of the Hoysala Army, during the reign of Hoysala King Narasimha III.\n\nSomanatha, who had established a town named Somanathapura after himself, sought the king’s permission and resources to build this grand temple.\n\nWith the king’s blessing, construction commenced and was completed in 1268 AD.\n\nAn inscription in old Kannada on a stone slab in the temple provides details of its construction and consecration.\n\nAfter demolitions by invaders, it no longer serves as a place of worship.\n\nArchitecture:\n\nThe temple is constructed from soapstone, which allows for the fine detailing seen in the carvings.\n\nIt is built on a raised platform with an outer Pradakshina pathway, allowing devotees to circum-ambulate the sanctum.\n\nThe temple features a stellar (star-shaped) plan, which creates multiple corners and niches, providing numerous canvases for the sculptors to showcase their intricate work.\n\nThe temple has three shrines, each crowned with a Vimana (tower).\n\nThe Hoysala emblem, depicting a warrior fighting a lion, is prominently displayed.\n\nThe walls of the temple are adorned with beautiful friezes depicting scenes from Hindu epics, figures of elephants, and battle scenes with cavalry.\n\nTap to read more about:\n\nUNESCO Heritage Status for Hoysala Temples in Karnataka\n\nGet an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024\n\nAttend Now\n\nHistorical and Archaeological Findings in News\n\nRead the rocks to improve India’s geological literacy\n\nMentors’ comment: India, with its landscapes ranging from the world’s highest peaks to low-lying coastal plains, showcases a diverse morphology that has evolved over billions of years. Numerous locations feature a variety of rocks, minerals, and distinctive fossil assemblages. These geological features and landscapes reveal spectacular ‘origin’ stories based on scientific interpretations rather than mythology. India’s tumultuous geological past is etched in its rocks and terrains and should be regarded as part of our non-cultural heritage. The country offers many such examples. Geo-heritage sites serve as educational spaces where people can gain much-needed geological literacy, especially given India’s generally poor regard for this legacy.\n\nLet’s learn!\n\nWhy in the news?\n\nIndia’s turbulent geological history is captured in its rocks and landscapes and should be regarded as part of our non-cultural heritage.\n\nScant Traction in India:\n\nLack of Awareness and Importance: Despite international advancements in geological conservation, India has not prioritized geo-conservation, with many fossil-bearing sites destroyed due to development and real estate growth.\n\nDestructive Activities: Stone mining activities, covering more than 10% of India’s total area, have led to significant destruction of geological sites, undermining the preservation of these natural laboratories.\n\nNeglect of Geological Heritage: There is a paradox in India’s approach—seeking evidence of early life on Mars while destroying crucial geological evidence within its own territory, such as the little-known Dhala meteoritic impact crater.\n\nAbsence of Legislation: India lacks specific legislation or policies to protect geo-heritage, despite being a signatory to international agreements advocating geological conservation.\n\nHalf-hearted Measures:\n\nAbandoned Legislation Attempts: In 2009, a Bill to constitute a National Commission for Heritage Sites was introduced but later withdrawn, indicating a lack of commitment to geo-heritage conservation.\n\nIneffective Notification by GSI: The Geological Survey of India (GSI) has notified 34 geological monuments but lacks regulatory power to enforce preservation measures, leading to threats against these sites.\n\nDraft Bill with No Progress: In 2022, the Ministry of Mines drafted a Bill for the preservation and maintenance of geo-heritage sites, but there has been no further progress, reflecting a lack of urgency and follow-through.\n\nRecent Cliff Demolition Example: The demolition of part of the Varkala cliff, a designated geological heritage site, by the district administration citing landslide hazards highlights the inadequate protection and respect for such sites.\n\nImpact:\n\nLoss of Scientific Knowledge: The destruction of fossil-bearing sites and other geological features due to development, real estate growth, and stone mining activities results in the permanent loss of invaluable scientific data. This hampers the understanding of India’s geological history and reduces opportunities for education and research in earth sciences.\n\nErosion of Cultural and Natural Heritage: Neglecting geological conservation undermines India’s rich natural heritage, which is integral to the country’s identity. The demolition of sites like the Varkala Cliff demonstrates a disregard for preserving unique geological formations that are part of India’s natural legacy.\n\nMissed Economic Opportunities: Geo-heritage sites have the potential to attract tourism, contributing to local and national economies. The lack of legislative protection and promotion of these sites means missed opportunities for sustainable tourism development, which could generate income and create jobs while educating the public about the importance of geological conservation.\n\nWay forward:\n\nLegislative Framework for Geo-Conservation: Enact specific legislation to protect and conserve geo-heritage sites, similar to the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. This legislation should establish clear guidelines for the preservation, management, and sustainable use of geo-heritage sites, ensuring they are protected from destructive activities and development pressures.\n\nNational Geo-Conservation Authority: Establish a National Geo-Conservation Authority to oversee the identification, protection, and promotion of geo-heritage sites.\n\nPromotion of Geo-Tourism: Develop and promote geo-heritage sites as sustainable tourism destinations. This includes investing in infrastructure, providing educational resources, and marketing these sites to attract both domestic and international tourists.\n\nGet an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1

Schoningen Wooden Artefacts; Prehistory vs. History; Christian Jorgensen Thomsen’s classification\n\nWhy in the News?\n\nNew research suggests the Stone Age be termed the “Wood Age” due to advanced wooden tools found in Schoningen, Germany.\n\nAbout Schoningen Wooden Artefacts\n\nA study of around 300,000-400,000-year-old wooden artefacts excavated from a coal mine in Schoningen, Germany, between 1994 and 2008.\n\nIt reveals that these were not merely “sharpened sticks” but “technologically advanced tools” requiring skill, precision, and time to build.\n\nThe tools demonstrated a broad spectrum of wood-working techniques including splitting, scraping or abrasion.\n\nBack2Basics: Periodising Human Prehistory\n\nPrehistory vs. History: Human ‘history’ began with the advent of writing, while everything before that is ‘prehistory,’ studied using archaeological evidence and ethnographic research.\n\n19th Century Periodization: Danish archaeologist Christian Jorgensen Thomsen introduced the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age classification based on technological advancements. This classification has been refined to reflect diverse cultural experiences.\n\nThe Stone Age Timeline\n\nBeginning: The Stone Age began when hominids first used stone tools, around 3.4 million years ago in Ethiopia, and lasted until about 6,000-4,000 BP (Before Present).\n\nDivisions: The Stone Age is divided into:\n\nPalaeolithic (Old Stone Age): Characterized by rudimentary stone tools and a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, ending around 11,650 BP.\n\nMesolithic (Middle Stone Age): A transitional phase.\n\nNeolithic (New Stone Age): Beginning roughly 12,000 BP in West Asia, marked by settled agriculture and domestication of animals.\n\nUse of Wood: Preservation Bias and Archaeological Evidence\n\nStone Tools: Stone tools provide significant insight into the lives and capabilities of early humans. Charles Darwin noted that even the rudest stone tools required a high degree of mental sophistication and physical dexterity.\n\nOther Materials: Evidence shows the use of bones, antlers, clay, and some metalworking alongside stone tools. However, evidence of woodworking is limited due to wood’s perishable nature.\n\nLesser Evidence of Wood: Wood has been recovered from less than 10 of thousands of Lower Palaeolithic sites (up to around 200,000 BP). The earliest wooden dwellings date to only 700,000 BP, much later than the earliest stone tools.\n\nGet an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024\n\nAttend Now\n\nHistorical and Archaeological Findings in News\n\nThe Battle of Udagai: Cholas vs. Cheras\n\nNote4Students\n\nFrom UPSC perspective, the following things are important :\n\nPrelims level: Battle of Udagai, Reign of Raja Raja I (Rajaraja Chola) and his achievements\n\nWhy in the news?\n\nThe southern part of India historically ruled by the Chera, Chola, and Pandya kings, was known for its great literature, art, culture, and temple architecture.\n\nIt also witnessed fierce battles among these kingdoms led by Raja Raja I.\n\nWho was Raja Raja I?\n\nHis reign marked a golden era for the Chola Empire through extensive military conquests, administrative reforms, and cultural patronage.\n\nPonniyin Selvan (The Son of Ponni) is a Tamil language historical fiction novel with the story of the early days of Prince Raja Raja I (also called Arulmozhivarman).\n\nHere are detailed facts and key events from the reign of Raja Raja I:\n\nBackground and Ascension to the Throne:\n\nFull Name: Arulmozhivarman, popularly known as Raja Raja Chola I.\n\nReign:\n\nHe reigned from 985 AD to 1014 AD, taking the throne following the death of his father Sundara Chola.\n\nHe was succeeded by Rajendra I.\n\nMilitary Conquests:\n\nRaja Raja I embarked on several military campaigns that significantly expanded the Chola Empire.\n\nHe conquered parts of what is now Tamil Nadu, northern parts of Sri Lanka, and the Maldives, consolidating the Chola influence across the region.\n\nHis most notable military achievement was the conquest of the ancient Chera capital of Mahodayapuram and the invasion of Sri Lanka, where he captured the northern half of the island.\n\nNagapattinam Port was his major naval base.\n\nHis success allowed his son Rajendra Chola to lead the Chola invasion of Srivijaya (Sumatra) and Kadaram (Malaysia).\n\nAdministrative Reforms:\n\nHe streamlined the administrative structure of the empire with precise revenue collection and management systems.\n\nHe implemented a well-organized provincial administration with efficient governance, dividing his empire into various provinces under the control of local governors.\n\nCultural Contributions and Temple Building:\n\nRaja Raja I was a great patron of the arts and architecture. Under his reign, Chola architecture and Tamil literature flourished.\n\nConstruction of the Brihadeeswara Temple in Thanjavur (Dravidian style).\n\nCompleted in 1010 AD\n\nHe also supported the revival of Hinduism and promoted Shaivism, actively endowing temples and supporting the livelihood of the temple priests. He called himself ‘Shivapada Shekhara’.\n\nHe also allowed for the flourishing of other religious practices for example Vaishnavism and Buddhism.\n\nTrade and Diplomacy:\n\nHis reign saw an increase in trade and diplomatic contacts with far-off kingdoms, including those in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe Chola navy played a crucial role in protecting and enhancing trade routes in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.\n\nTo promote trade, Rajaraja sent the first Chola mission to China.\n\nAbout the Battle of Udagai/Udayagiri\n\nIt occurred in 1003 CE between the Cholas and the Cheras at Udagai, now known as Udayagiri in Kalkulam taluk of Kanniyakumari district, during the reign of Raja Raja I, the greatest of Chola kings.\n\nIt was the bloodiest war in medieval Indian history, where the Cholas plundered Udagai and returned to their headquarters in Thanjavur with tonnes of gold and the best elephants.\n\nThe battle began with the conquest of Kanthalur Salai in the Chera Kingdom.\n\nThe Chola army was led by Raja Raja’s son Rajendra.\n\nEvidence from Epigraphy\n\nThe Discovery of a Chola period epigraphy near Chengam suggests that Salai was an army training centre run by the Cheras.\n\nThe training centre was a challenge to the Cholas.\n\nThe battle marked the end of the relationship between the Cholas and the Cheras, which had been established through marriages.\n\nAftermath of the War\n\nThe battles terminated the relationship between the Cholas and Cheras during the reign of Rajendra Chola.\n\nIn 1004 CE, Raja Raja celebrated his birthday grandly in the Chera kingdom, renaming the village Muttam as Mummudi Chola Nalloor.\n\nHe granted the temple at Thirunanthikarai for a seven-day celebration of his birthday.\n\nSubsequently, he returned to Thanjavur with gold, elephants, and cattle.\n\nKamban Manian, a Chola general, brought a Shiva idol made of emerald to Thirupazhanam near Thanjavur, though it is no longer found there.\n\nPYQ:\n\n[2020] Consider the following events

UPSC perspective, the following things are important :\n\nPrelims level: Vasuki Indicus, Madtsoiidae snake family, Panandhro Lignite Mine, Middle Eocene Period\n\nMains level: NA\n\nWhy in the news?\n\nA fossil unearthed in Gujarat’s Kutch in 2005, initially presumed to belong to a giant crocodile, has been revealed as one of the largest snake ‘Vasuki Indicus’ ever to exist on Earth.\n\nAbout Vasuki Indicus\n\n‘Vasuki Indicus’ is the name given by IIT Roorkee Scientists to the fossil specie.\n\nThe name “Vasuki” derives from the mythological snake depicted often encircling the neck of the Hindu deity Shiva.\n\nPhysical characteristics of Vasuki\n\nIt is estimated to measure between 11m (36ft) and 15m (49.22ft) in length,\n\nIt belonged to the extinct Madtsoiidae snake family.\n\nIts size could potentially surpass the extinct Titanoboa in size, with its closest relatives identified as Titanoboa and Python.\n\nThe serpent’s large size indicates it was a slow-moving, ambush predator, akin to an anaconda, as suggested by researchers.\n\nLike contemporary pythons and anacondas, Vasuki Indicus presumably employed Constriction (suffocation) as its primary method of prey capture.\n\nAge and Geological Context:\n\nRecovered from the Panandhro Lignite Mine in Kutch, the fossil dates back to the Middle Eocene period, approximately 47 million years ago.\n\nAnalysis of the well-preserved vertebrae indicates the snake’s existence during a warm geological interval with average temperatures estimated at 28°C.\n\n‘Vasuki’ is believed to represent an extinct relic lineage originating in India, with subsequent India-Asia collision facilitating its dispersal from the subcontinent into North Africa through southern Eurasia.\n\nVasuki thrived during a time when the continents of Africa, India, and South America were amalgamated into a single landmass.\n\nSignificance for India\n\nThis discovery underscores India’s rich biodiversity.\n\nIt holds immense potential in unraveling insights into the evolutionary process, continental shifts, and India’s pivotal role in the origin of various species, particularly reptiles.\n\nMiddle Eocene Period\n\nIt is part of the Cenozoic Era, which began about 66 million years ago and continues to the present day.\n\nDuring the Middle Eocene, the Earth experienced a greenhouse climate, with global temperatures significantly warmer than today.\n\nThe poles were ice-free, and forests extended into higher latitudes than they do today.\n\nThe period was characterized by relatively high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, contributing to the warm climate.\n\nThe Middle Eocene was a time of significant diversification and evolution of various groups of organisms.\n\nMammals continued to diversify and evolve, with the emergence of early primates, rodents, and hoofed mammals.\n\nThe period also saw the rise of modern bird groups and the diversification of flowering plants (angiosperms).\n\nThe Middle Eocene was marked by tectonic activity, including the ongoing separation of continents and the formation of mountain ranges in various parts of the world.\n\nFor example, the collision of the Indian Plate with the Eurasian Plate during this time led to the uplift of the Himalayas.\n\nGet an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024\n\nAttend Now\n\nHistorical and Archaeological Findings

unearthed a lead coin hoard belonging to Ikshvaku Period at Phanigiri, a renowned Buddhist heritage site.\n\nThe coins numbering 3,730 bore an elephant symbol on the obverse and a Ujjain symbol on the reverse.\n\nWho were the Ikshvaku (225-340 A.D)?\n\nOrigin and Rule\n\nThe Ikshvaku dynasty was a feudatory under the patronage of the Satavahanas.\n\nTheir capital was located at Vijayapuri, modern-day Nagarjunakonda in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nThey ruled over the delta of the Krishna and Godavari rivers on the east coast of the Andhra region.\n\nThey claimed to be descendants of the legendary king Ikshvaku, mentioned in ancient Sanskrit texts such as the Rigveda and Ramayana.\n\nThe dynasty’s founder was Vasishthiputra Chamtamula, who rose to power after the decline of the Satavahana dynasty.\n\nCultural Affiliations\n\nThe Ikshvakus were Shaivites and performed Vedic rites, but they also patronized Buddhism, which flourished during their reign.\n\nUnder the reign of Vasishthi-putra Ehuvala Chamtamula, the Ikshvaku kingdom reached its zenith, marked by the construction of numerous Hindu and Buddhist shrines.\n\nTheir inscriptions and coins have been discovered at various archaeological sites, including Nagarjunakonda, Jaggayyapeta, Kottampalugu, Gurazala, Rentala, and Uppugunduru.\n\nDecline:\n\nSuccessive rulers, such as Mathari-putra Vira-purusha-datta, Vasishthi-putra Ehuvala Chamtamula, and Vasishthi-putra Rudra-purusha-datta, contributed to the expansion and governance of the kingdom.\n\nBy the mid-4th century, the Pallavas had gained control of the former Ikshvaku territory, marking the decline of the dynasty.\n\nAbout Phanigiri\n\nPhanigiri village derived its name from the shape of the hillock, which appears to be like a snake hood.\n\nThe word Phani in Sanskrit means snake and Giri means hillock.\n\nStudies suggest that the village had a vibrant life from 1000 BC to 18th century AD.\n\nPhanigiri is believed to be one of the important Buddhist monasteries strategically located on the hilltop, on the ancient trade route (Dakshinapatha) connecting the west and the east coast of the Deccan.\n\nVarious stages of earlier excavations here discovered Mahastupa, apsidal Chaityagrihas, Votive stupas, pillared congregation halls, Viharas, platforms with staircases at various levels, octagonal stupa chaitya, 24-pillared mandapam, circular Chaitya.\n\nCultural materials included terracotta beads, semi-precious beads, iron objects, Brahmi label inscriptions and holy relic casket.\n\nGet an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal

information about the DNA analysis of skeletal remains found at Rakhigarhi.\n\nDNA Findings of Rakhigarhi\n\nTheir key findings include-\n\nDebunking of the Aryan Invasion Theory.\n\nThe genetic roots of the Harappans date back to 10,000 BCE.\n\nDNA of the Harappans has continued to exist among the majority of the South Asian population.\n\nThe study indicates genetic continuity without large-scale immigration.\n\nAncestry was closely linked to Iranian ancestry and not at all to Steppe ancestry.\n\nFarming skills have been developed indigenously contrary to prevalent theories that these came with migrants from the Steppes and Anatolian farmers.\n\nAbout Rakhigarhi\n\nThe ancient site of Rakhi-Khas and Rakhi-Shahpur are collectively known as Rakhigarhi, located on the right bank of the now dried up Palaeo-channel of Drishadvati.\n\nIt is located in the Ghaggar-Hakra River plain in the Hissar district of Haryana.\n\nTotal seven mounds are located here.\n\nThe site has yielded various stages of Harappan culture and is by far one of the largest Harappan sites in India.\n\nThe site shows the sequential development of the Indus culture in the now dried-up Saraswati basin.\n\nMajor findings at Rakhigarhi\n\nFindings confirm both early and mature Harappan phases and include 4,600-year-old human skeletons, fortification and bricks.\n\nDigging so far reveals a well-planned city with 92 m wide roads, a bit wider than in Kalibangan.\n\nThe pottery is similar to Kalibangan and Banawali.\n\nPits surrounded by walls have been found, which are thought to be for sacrificial or some religious ceremonies.\n\nThere are brick-lined drains to handle sewage from the houses.\n\nTerracotta statues, weights, bronze artefacts, comb, copper fish hooks, needles and terracotta seals have also been found.\n\nA bronze vessel has been found which is decorated with gold and silver.\n\nA granary belonging to the mature Harappan phase has been found here.\n\nFire altars structures were

‘Delist’ some ‘Lost’ monuments. What’s happening, and why?\n\nNote4Students\n\nFrom UPSC perspective, the following things are important :\n\nPrelims level: Art and Culture; Heritage Monuments in News;\n\nMains level: Art and Culture; Conservation of Historical Monuments; ASI;\n\nWhy in the news?\n\nRecently, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has decided to delist 18 “centrally protected monuments” because according to them, they lag in National Importance.\n\nWhat does the “Delisting” of monuments mean?\n\nDelisting means that the monument will no longer be protected, conserved, or maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Once delisted, the restrictions on construction-related activities around the monument are lifted.\n\nLegal Mandate: Section 35 of the AMASR Act outlines the process for delisting monuments. It empowers the Central Government to declare, via official notification, that a monument no longer holds national importance, thereby removing its protected status.\n\nDelisted Monuments: Kos Minar No.13 at Mujessar village in Haryana, Barakhamba Cemetery in Delhi, Gunner Burkill’s tomb in Jhansi district, a cemetery at Gaughat in Lucknow, and the Telia Nala Buddhist ruins in Varanasi.\n\nChallenges for the Archaeological Survey of India due to “untraceable” monument:\n\nSurvival issue: Some monuments, especially smaller or lesser-known ones, have been lost over time due to various factors such as urbanization, encroachments, neglect, and construction activities like dams and reservoirs.\n\nAmong the 50 missing monuments, 14 had been lost to rapid urbanization, 12 were submerged by reservoirs or dams, and the remaining 24 were untraceable.\n\nDifficulty in Locating Monuments: This could be due to factors like inadequate documentation, lack of historical records, changes in the landscape, or complete disappearance of the structure.\n\nIssue with Preservation and Conservation: Without knowing the monument’s location, it cannot be regularly inspected, assessed for its condition, or protected from encroachments or other forms of damage.\n\nDespite the recognized need for 7,000 security personnel, only 2,578 were deployed due to financial limitations.\n\nTherefore, ASI faces challenges in fulfilling this responsibility effectively, especially when dealing with monuments that are untraceable due to historical neglect or lack of resources.\n\nHow many historical monuments have been lost in this way?\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Culture’s submission to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism, and Culture in December 2022, a total of 50 out of India’s 3,693 centrally protected monuments were missing.\n\nIn 2013, a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India highlighted the issue of missing monuments. The report stated that at least 92 centrally protected monuments across the country were missing.\n\nConclusion: The ASI has decided to delist 18 centrally protected monuments that are deemed to have lost national importance. This delisting means these monuments will no longer receive protection or conservation from the ASI.\n\nMains PYQs\n\nQ Safeguarding the Indian art heritage is the need of the moment.

They also reported finding abundant benthic and planktic foraminifera — single-celled organisms with shells found near the sea bed and free-floating in water.\n\nMicroscopic Revelations: High-resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed the fossil to be in the shape of needles, spindles, bullets, and spearheads.\n\nEnvironmental Insights: Earlier, studies of sediments suggested that nearly 29,000 to 11,700 years ago, during the last Glacial Maximum-Holocene period, the northeast and southwest monsoon strengthened and resulted in significant weathering and sedimentation.\n\nPYQ:\n\nConsider the following kinds of organisms:\n\nCopepods\n\nCyanobacteria\n\nDiatoms\n\nForaminifera\n\nWhich of the above are primary producers in the food chains of oceans?\n\n1 and 2\n\n2 and 3\n\n3 and 4\n\n1 and 4\n\nPractice MCQ:\n\nWhich of the following statements is correct about the ‘Magnetofossils’?\n\nThey are fossilized magnetic particles created by magnetotactic bacteria.\n\nThey follow the magnetic field to reach places that have optimal oxygen concentration.\n\nThey are tiny crystals made of the iron-rich minerals magnetite or greigite.\n\nAll of these.\n\nGet an IAS/IPS ranker as your 1: 1 personal mentor for UPSC 2024\n\nAttend Now\n\nHistorical and Archaeological Findings in News\n\nMonuments of National Importance (MNI) and their Listing/De-Listing\n\nNote4Students\n\nFrom UPSC perspective, the following things are important :\n\nPrelims level: Monuments of National Importance (MNI)\n\nMains level: NA\n\nWhy in the news?\n\nThe Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has decided to remove 18 “centrally protected monuments” from its list of Monuments of National Importance (MNI), citing a lack of national significance.\n\nASI currently has 3,693 monuments under its purview, which will fall to 3,675 once the current delisting exercise is completed in the next few weeks.\n\nWhat are Monuments of National Importance (MNI)?\n\nMNI in India are legally protected under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (AMASR) Act, 1958.\n\nThis act empowers the Centre to declare certain monuments as MNIs through official notifications published in the Gazette of India.\n\nIt mandates the protection, preservation, and maintenance of MNIs to ensure their integrity and authenticity for future generations.\n\nThe Act empowers the central government to appoint authorities, such as the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), to oversee the protection and management of MNIs.\n\nKey Features of MNI Protection\n\nProhibited Activities: The Act prohibits certain activities within the precincts of MNIs, such as construction, excavation, and removal of artifacts, without prior permission from the relevant authorities.\n\nDesignated Zones: Within a 100-meter radius of the monument, construction activities are prohibited to prevent encroachment and damage. An additional 200-meter radius (100 + 200 meters) constitutes a regulated area where construction is subject to specific regulations to maintain the monument’s integrity and surroundings.\n\nMaintenance of Records: The Act requires the maintenance of records and registers documenting the history, conservation, and management of MNIs.\n\nUnderstanding Monument Delisting\n\nOnce delisted, monuments are no longer subject to ASI conservation efforts, allowing for regular construction activities in the vicinity.\n\nSection 35 of the AMASR Act allows for the delisting of monuments deemed to have lost national importance.\n\nThe delisting process involves official notifications, with a two-month public feedback period to address objections or suggestions.\n\nPYQ:\n\n2015: With reference to art and archaeological history of India, which one among the following was made earliest?\n\nLingaraja Temple at Bhubaneswar\n\nRock-cut Elephant at Dhauli\n\nRock-cut Monuments at Mahabalipuram\n\nVaraha Image at Udayagiri\n\nPractice MCQ:\n\nThe Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has decided to remove 18 “centrally protected monuments”.

The empire maintained a sophisticated system of land measurement and taxation to ensure a steady flow of revenue.\n\nArts and Culture:\n\nSculpture flourished under the patronage of the Chalukya rulers, with exquisite examples of stone carvings adorning temple complexes and royal monuments.\n\nThe famous Nataraja sculpture at Pattadakal, depicting Lord Shiva in his cosmic dance pose, is a masterpiece of Chalukyan art.\n\nPampa, a court poet of the Chalukyas, composed the epic poem “Vikramarjuna Vijaya” (also known as “Pampa Bharata” or “Pampa Ramayana”) in Kannada, narrating the story of the Mahabharata from the perspective of Arjuna.\n\nThe Chalukyan era witnessed the development of classical dance forms like Bharatanatyam, as evidenced by sculptures found in temples such as the Mallikarjuna Temple at Pattadakal.\n\nRanna, a prominent Kannada poet of the Chalukyan period, composed the “Ajita Tirthankara Purana,” an epic poem celebrating the lives of the Jain Tirthankaras.\n\nArchitecture:\n\nChalukyan temples are architectural marvels, characterized by their distinctive Dravidian and Nagara styles collectively called the ‘Gadag Style’ .\n\nThe Virupaksha Temple at Pattadakal, built by the Chalukyan king Vikramaditya II in the 8th century, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site renowned for its intricate carvings and towering gopurams (entrance gateways).\n\nSimilarly, the Durga Temple at Aihole, dating back to the 7th century, showcases exemplary Chalukyan architecture with its ornate pillars and sculpted panels depicting Hindu deities and
