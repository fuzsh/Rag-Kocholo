        "text": "Kaal Bhairav Jayanti is celebrated on 28/07/2024 as on this is that Lord Shiva manifested as Lord Kaal Bhairav. This day is celebrated on the Ashtami Tithi, Krishna Paksha in the month of Margashirsha and is considered the best day to worship and revere Lord Kaal Bhairava. It is a day filled with special prayers and rituals and receive divine blessings üåπ‚ù§Ô∏èüåπ‚ù§Ô∏è Once, the gods Brahma and Vishnu were competing for supremacy. Then Shiva appeared as a powerful divine light between the duo. Shiva has instantly created the new being Bhairava or Kaal Bhairava, who is ornamented with a range of twisted serpents, which serve as earrings, bracelets, anklets, and sacred thread (yajnopavita). He wears a tiger skin and a ritual apron composed of human bones. Bhairava has a dog as his divine vehicle. Bhairavi is a fierce and terrifying aspect of the Devi who is virtually indistinguishable from Kali, with the exception of her particular identification as the consort of Bhairava. An angry Brahma stared at the pillar of light with his 5th head, which started to burn out of anger. However, Bhairava has decapitated Brahma's 5th head. Shiva then ordered Kaal Bhairav to go to various places but BrƒÅhmanahatya, the sin of beheading Brahma personified as a gory woman, followed him until he reached Varanasi where Brahma's head fell on the ground. The place is called \"Kapal Mochan Teerth\". He was freed of the sin of BrƒÅhmanahatya as he entered Varanasi. Shiva then pronounced that \"Kaal Bhairav\" will forever be in Varanasi in order to remove sins of his disciples. Kaal Bhairav Mandir is one of the oldest Shiva temples in Varanasi, India. Situated in Bharonath, Vishweshwarganj (Varanasi), this temple has great historical and cultural importance in Hinduism; especially amongst the locals. The temple is dedicated to Bhairava (Kaal Bhairav), a fierce form of Shiva and wears a garland of skulls and carries a club of peacock feathers. The word \"Kaal\" means both \"death\" and \"time\". Kaal Bhairav or Bhairava also means the one who removes the fear of both death and time. It is believed that even death is afraid of Kaal Bhairava. He protects the devotees from all the problems. Thennaga Kasi Bairavar Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Bairavar, a fierce form of Lord Shiva. It is located in Erode, Tamil Nadu, India. Traditionally, Kala Bhairava is the Grama devata in the rural villages of Maharashtra, where he is referred to as \"Bhairava/Bhairavnath\" and \"Bairavar\". In Karnataka, Lord Bhairava is the supreme God for the Hindu community commonly referred to as Vokkaligas (Gowdas) and is considered the caretaker and punisher. Shri Kala Bhairava Nath Swami Temple of Madhya Pradesh is also popular. Most of the temples of Bhairava in Nepal are maintained by Newar priests. There are several Bhairava temples in the Kathmandu valley.\n\nGuru Purnima is a religious festival dedicated to offering respect to all the spiritual and academic gurus. The word guru is derived from the Sanskrit root words, gu and ru. Gu means \"darkness\" or \"ignorance\", and ru means \"dispeller.\" Therefore, a guru is the dispeller of darkness or ignorance This is celebrated as a festival in India, Nepal and Bhutan by Hindus, Jains and Buddhists. This festival is traditionally observed to honour one's chosen spiritual teachers or leaders. It is observed on the full moon day (Purnima) in the month of Ashadha (June‚ÄìJuly) according to the Hindu Calendar. This is also known as Vyasa Purnima, for it marks the birthday of Veda Vyasa, the sage who authored the Mahabharata and compiled the Vedas. Mantras are chanted to venerate the Maha Guru and seek his blessings. Devotional songs and hymns are chanted throughout the day. The Guru Gita, a holy text, is also recited in memory of the Maha Guru. Flowers and gifts are offered and ''prasad'' is distributed, sometimes called as ''charanamritha''. This year Guru Purnima will be celebrated on 21 July 2024, Sunday. It is a day to honor the teachers, or ''gurus'' in our life. In the Hindu calendar, it falls on the full moon day in the month of ''Ashada''. The mythology behind Guru Purnima can be traced back to the birth of the sage Ved Vyasa, who was born to sage Parashara and a fisherman's daughter Satyavati. Veda Vyasa did yeoman service to the cause of Vedic studies by gathering all the Vedic hymns extant during his times and dividing them into four parts based on their characteristics and use in rites. He divided the Vedas into four parts, namely Rig, Yajur, Sama and Atharva. Guru Purnima day is thought to be auspicious for seeking the blessings of Ved Vyasa, who is considered to be the ''Maha Guru''. His blessings are believed to dispel the darkness of ignorance and usher in the light of knowledge. Buddhists celebrate Guru Purnima by conducting a ritual called as 'Uposatha'. They honor the eight teachings of the Buddha on this day. Many Buddhist monks use this day to start their journey of meditation. They also start other ascetic practices on this day. According to Buddhist lore, this is the day that Gautama Buddha delivered his first sermon to his first five disciples after which his ''sangha' or group of disciples was formed. According to Jain history, this day is celebrated to venerate Lord Mahavira who became the Guru to Gautam Swami, his first disciple, on this very day. In Nepal, Treenok Guha Purnima is a big day in schools. This day is teacher's day for Nepalese. Students of Indian classical music celebrate this day by offering respect to their music teachers, reinforcing the sacred bond between teacher and student, known as the 'guru-shishya parampara'.\n\nDevshayani Ekadashi is one of the most auspicious day when a large number of Hindu devotees worship Lord Vishnu with immense devotion and dedication. This day holds a great religious and spiritual significance in Hindu religion. There are 24 Ekadashi observances in the year and Ekadashi falls twice a month during Shukla Paksha and Krishna Paksha. This month, Devshayani Ekadashi is going to be observed on 11th day of Shukla Paksha in the month of Ashadha i.e., on July 17, 2024.
