How infinite in faculty! … In action how like an angel! In apprehension how like a god! … The paragon of animals!”\n\nHamlet by Shakespeare\n\nWhen I look back my life how I decided to leave the worldly life in order to pursue spiritual development, it’s always for my quest for a more meaningful life through continuous inspirations from the life of Gotama Buddha, his transcendence from ordinary to extraordinary. Although humans are special, we do root and evolve from animals. The animal nature are ingrained into mode of existence, with two major instincts: to mate and to fight to survive, sex and violence. We can see them everywhere in our daily life all the time. We make commotion with them and they shape our culture. They are exactly what the Buddha described as the unwholesome roots (akusala-mūla) of kāma-raga (sexual attachment) and dosa (anger, hatred). They are character flaws innate in human being, the root of craving (taṇhā), and thus in part the cause of dukkha (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness) and samsāric rebirths. They are hard wired into the human subconscious mind and only through rewiring the mind with knowledge and understanding, that humans are able to transcend such ingrained conditions. What the historic Gotama Buddha showed us is that it is possible to remove the influences from such instincts that molded our being of existence, to go beyond.\n\nThe universe is teemed with intelligent lives with different dimensions and realms. Humans are just a tiny part of the cosmic intelligence hierarchy in this “biolab” called planet earth. The human species are blessed with a highly ordered intelligent mind, commonly termed as soul, during the “great creation time” by a group of powerful beings we call gods. Thus our ancestors are able to rise above the animal nature of their predecessors such as the Neanderthals or the Denisovans who are still cannibals. Much of the history of our ancient ancestors are lost in time after their civilization collapsed catastrophically. Pieces of information remained in some cultures but slowly they become legends. For example the Chinese ancient text of “Over the Mountains and Seas Sutta” provides great details about different human subspecies and fantastic divine beasts and where they live on different part of the continents. The Theravadin Pali Texts and many Hindu and Tibetan texts all contain descriptions of different kinds of super beings or demigods such as the clans of asuras, rakkhasas, supaṇṇas, gandhabbas, yakkhas, garuḍas and nāgas. What’s worth noting is some ancient Hindu temples, such as the Chennakeshava Temple, still have amazing stone sculptures that we may peek through time to see how those ancient ancestor may look like and how they live.\n\nNow our creation gods have long left this planet earth, humans and animals on earth become a legacy for their creation. There are groups of beings, we identify as aliens or ufo phenomena, are monitoring the evolution on this planet and are very curious about our weak but highly ordered intelligent mind, some groups are stealing genetic materials from humans and animals to study, there are even more groups of beings from different dimensions are just visiting and watching. Yet in such a precarious time, the signature in our mind from our creation gods always protects us. The knowledge about the specialness of our mind and its potential to be freed from a worldly existence, and to enter nibbāna are all from those gods, passed down from our early ancestors generations by generations.\n\nYou can take the person out of the Stone Age, not the Stone Age out of the person.\n\nevolutionary psychology\n\nWhen we look at the basic facts about humans, it’s not difficult to see that humans today are based on early human species and animal ancestors, with animal instincts and a feeble and fragile body trapped in an illusory world (māyā) with its specially designed rules and laws through cycles of births and deaths. In fact, the urge to copulate with its derived pleasure is shared among other creatures including animals and insects. It is a procreational design by divine beings we call deva as an universal law in this devas’ world (sadevakassa loka). It is also the key element to entrap and hold all creatures including humans, like gravitational force, into this samsāric world. The human body is saturated with sexual hormones since puberty, and the human subconscious mind is also heavily conditioned in a way that the feeling of happiness is closely sexual related. One psychological study suggests that women who have more male friends are generally happier. Under such circumstance, a person who is not able to have sex while the body and subconscious mind may long for it badly can create psychological conflicts that eventually harm the physical health. Similarly a person with sheer will to stop sex by suppressing desires from the body and subconscious mind can also cause similar health problem and psychological damage.\n\n1) Sexuality is Everyone’s Weakness and Strength;\n\n2) Every Part of the Body is Erotic;\n\n3) Homosexuality is Not A Mental Illness;\n\n4) All Love Relationships Contain Ambivalent Feelings;\n\n5) We Learn to Love from our Early Relationships with Parents and Caregivers;\n\n6) Our Loved One Becomes a Part of Ourselves;\n\n7) Fantasy is an Important Factor in Sexual Excitement.\n\nSeven Things About Sex & Love by Sigmund Freud\n\nSo are we really able to remove influence from sexual instinct that is so heavily conditioned into our being of existence? The answer is yes. Take smoking as an example. When we are equipped with proper knowledge, and start to realize smoking maybe is harmful for healthy, then after being confirmed with a trusting doctor that if we continue smoking we will have lung cancer soon, with another fact that if we stop smoking we may extend our life for another ten years. In such a process we would be fully convinced that it is necessary and imperative to quit smoking, then we may be able to arouse strong determination to quit smoking, and then we may find quitting is not that difficult as we had previously anticipated. This process of changing an existing habit or addiction by reasoning with knowledge, until being fully convinced and action is the process of reflection and reconditioning we may use to deal with human conditions including sex.\n\nPhysical Universe Not A Base Reality\n\nMaya, Illusory World, Virtual Reality, Matrix\n\nWhat we see, such as a rock or a building or even our planet earth, seems solid, but the truth is they are made of pretty much a vast stretch of empty space that is lightly salted with flecks of tiny particles, energy in condensed form. We have come to a realization that matter is not a thing. There’s actually no thing in what we call things, matter. There is actually just energy, vibration, frequency, oscillations. When you look at an atom really, really close, we don’t see little billiard balls. The atom is made out of 99.9999999% space. And the part that’s not space is a little electromagnetic field that’s fluctuating. And to think of that as something solid is incorrect. The world we are living looks real, but it isn’t. What we perceive with our eyes is just an illusion.\n\nIt’s a sure thing now we are not living in a base reality, in a sense it is kind of a virtual reality (māyā) with unsatisfactory impure and suffering (dukkha) nature. It is created with a beginning, and whatever is created will end. According ancient cosmic model, the world is built on the four dimensions (dhātu) of wind (vāyu), fire (teja), water (āpa) and earth (pruṭhavī), on top of the dimension of space (ākāsa). And by our will, we are able to travel inter-dimensionally. This realization would help us disenchanted to this illusory reality (nibbidā).\n\nIn an isolated system, nothing ever truly dies, everything is simply transformed. Death is merely a human concept. This is the Law of Conservation. The conservation of energy is an absolute law. Sparks create a fire, which generates heat—manifest energy that wasn’t there before. A battery produces power. A nuclear bomb creates an explosion. Each of these situations is simply a case of energy changing form. The seemingly paradoxical dark energy causing the universe’s expansion to accelerate also obeys this rule. Even for sentient beings including humans, the body and mind recycle under this law as well.\n\nThis physical world is called a sensual world (kāma-loka) because it is constructed with the energy in two opposite forms, the male energy and the female energy. When we are able to be freed from ingrained sexual attachment (kāma-raga), we will be able to reach the ground dimension of space (ākāsa) and exit from there to nibbāna. Nibbāna is the gateway to the outside of this universe which roots on the space dimension and other countless affiliated dimensions, open or hidden, in a tree structure. Like many disciples of Gotama Buddha’s time, by following his footsteps, with proper training and recondition (vipassana) of our mind (citta), we can make this human life the last one, and liberate our mind from the death and birth cycle in this world. This is the way for our practice, a path to purification and liberation.\n\nBrahmacariya Is The Way\n\nHoly Life, A Pure Life of Celibacy, How Brahmans Live\n\nKhīṇā jāti, vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ; kataṃ karaṇīyaṃ, nāparaṃ itthattāyā.\n\nEnded is birth, established is a pure life of celibacy; what should be done has been done, no more for this samsāric existence.\n\nSN 22.59 Anatta Lakkhaṇa Sutta\n\nThe Buddha spent most of his life amid the forest and the tree witnessed his enlightenment became the most sacred symbol throughout the Buddhist world – the Bodhi tree. The first Buddhist communities were forest dwellers. This tradition extends back into a history of the Brahman rishis of the past, the ‘seers’ — those who saw what others could not see. Those sages in the forest were hermits, who renounced all things material and lead a life of brahmacariya, approached wisdom directly with clear and pure mind.\n\nBrahmacariya is a way of life in purity and a way to nibbāna. Like a lotus grows on mud, brahmacariya is an existential mode of purity for the body, the speech, and the mind. A state of being self-controlled (saññatattā) and full mastery over senses (tāpasino) that having abandoned the pleasures which are to be enjoyed by means of the five senses (pañca kāmaguṇa), with good behavior (sīla), being righteous (ajjava) and mild (maddava), and values simplicity (tapa), gentle (soracca) and nonviolent (avihiṁsañca), and patient (khanti). It is an existential mode showing the strength of the mind is well in control over our deep ingrained animal instincts and habits. This means that we are master, not slave to our human conditions in a sense that we can exert control over our human conditions by removing its influence if we choose to. Hence comes the ancient tradition for monk’s lifestyle with rules which roots back to the brahmanical tradition (Brāhmaṇa Dhammika Sutta) of the past. The goal is to cultivate a sober mind that is always aware of the arising thoughts and ideas; always be aware of ourselves and others, our human conditions, how the world works, purpose of this life, and nibbāna.\n\nBrahmacariya is a fundamental training rule in Gautama Buddha’s Sangha (pātimokkha, “leading to liberation, moksha”) for purity of thoughts, words, and deeds. The ultimate goal of brahmacariya training is dispassion and non-attachment (virāga), which directly leads to liberation (vimutta) (SN 23.1 Māra). Lay people are also encouraged to periodically take vow of brahmacariya as third of the eight vows according to tradition. This is especially important and pertinent for today’s hyper sexualized modern society.\n\n“Gambhīrarūpe bahubherave vane, Suññaṁ araññaṁ vijanaṁ vigāhiya; Aniñjamānena ṭhitena vaggunā, Sucārurūpaṁ vata bhikkhu jhāyasi.\n\n“Deep in the woods with many terrors lurk, knowingly entering such empty forest; With a motionless body, steady, graceful, how you meditate, bhikkhu, so beautifully!\n\nNa yattha gītaṁ napi yattha vāditaṁ, Eko araññe vanavassito muni; Accherarūpaṁ paṭibhāti maṁ idaṁ, Yadekako pītimano vane vase.\n\nwhere there is no song or music, A solitary sage has resorted to the woods! This strikes me as a wonder—that you dwell, with joyful mind alone in the woods.\n\nMaññāmahaṁ lokādhipatisahabyataṁ, Ākaṅkhamāno tidivaṁ anuttaraṁ; Kasmā bhavaṁ vijanamaraññamassito, Tapo idha kubbasi brahmapattiyā”ti.\n\nI suppose you wish to go to the supreme triple heaven, and have a supreme celestial abode; is that why you resort to the desolate forest, to practise tapas (austerities) here for attaining Brahma? ʺ\n\n“Yā kāci kaṅkhā abhinandanā vā, Anekadhātūsu puthū sadāsitā; Aññāṇamūlappabhavā pajappitā, Sabbā mayā byantikatā samūlikā.\n\n“Whatever be the many desires and delights, that are always attached to various dimensions and realms; such longings sprung from the root of unknowing, I have eliminated them all down to the root.\n\nSvāhaṁ akaṅkho asito anūpayo, Sabbesu dhammesu visuddhadassano; Pappuyya sambodhimanuttaraṁ sivaṁ, Jhāyāmahaṁ brahma raho visārado”ti.\n\nI am desireless, unattached, disengaged, with purified and clear vision to see through all created things; having attained the auspicious, supreme enlightenment, my meditation is solely on brahma alone, without fear.”\n\nSN 7.18 Kaṭṭhahāra Sutta\n\nBrahmavihāra for Tathāgata\n\nDivine, Pure, Mind States of Brahmans\n\nHulk is a super hero character of Bruce Banner in the Marvel Comics’ universe. Hulk is the alter ego of the shy scientist Banner. This appeared after Banner was accidentally exposed to a massive dose of gamma rays. Therefore, as soon as the researcher feels a strong emotion such as anger or stress and fear, he turns into a real, almost invincible monster that destroys everything in his path.\n\nHulk is nevertheless one of the most popular heroes of the Marvel universe and is often a victim since all he wants is to live in peace but he is constantly hunted down by the other heroes or the government who either want to use him or destroy him because they fear his strength. Stan Lee, the co-creator of the Hulk, confessed in interviews that to create the Jade Giant, he was inspired by two mythical fictional characters, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde because of the double personality. The character Dr. Jekyll was a researcher who turns into a monster. He was also inspired by Frankenstein, a monster who only aspires to live in peace but who is constantly hunted down by other people who fear him.\n\nBut the most important thing is that Hulk draws his strength from anger and hatred because in times of stress or nervousness his strength increases and then knows no limits. Hulk is almost invincible and often the only way to defeat him is to appease him and calm his fury. The hate between groups can activate the motivational system to bolster feelings of personal power and meaning in life.\n\nThe Brahmavihāra values and hate are alternative levers for activating personal power and meaning in life. The Brahmavihāra values are antidote to hostility and hate. If you have one, you feel less need for the other since meaning search and self-transcendence inspire approach motivation and magnanimity. The Brahmavihāra values are self-transcendent values is a hallmark of mature and magnanimous character. When people are under threat, focus on the Brahmavihāra values can confer magnanimity by improving buoyancy, being less anxious and more courageous, determined, and effective; and also decreasing belligerence that is less defensive, extreme, and hostile. The Brahmavihāra values as self-transcendent pursuit, persistently engage them in the pursuit of purpose and meaning in life, can make the transient, approach-motivated state to be a longer lasting relief from preoccupation with threat, leaving people feeling buoyant and generous.\n\nDevotion to the Brahmavihāra values can help us feel more confident, reduce harsh judgments, and become less hostile in stressful circumstances. These values can be like life vests that buoy a higher power and resilience, freeing us from worry and defensiveness. Focusing on the Brahmavihāra values that are beyond ourselves makes us stronger, and more reasonable dealing with relationship problems and moral violations.\n\nThrough persistently engaging in the Brahmavihāra values, it will become part of us and heighten the power of our mind. Devotion to he Brahmavihāra values can sustain wise reasoning and respect for others’ perspectives in conflicts, as well as tenacious resolve, even in seemingly hopeless circumstances.\n\nThe rise of humanity above flesh and blood mundane existence requires the strength of divinity. Divinity is to become a perfect being. The accomplishment of this path towards extraordinary is not through psychic powers, but the brahmavihāras.\n\nA house, without continuous maintenance, will collapse into ruin. Why? Because everything created with order tends towards disorder, the original state of chaos, as expressed in the law of entropy. This is another divine law in this devas’ world. In our human nature there’s also an intrinsic disorder and destructive tendency (dosa). It originates from the very source of life for its chaotic nature. Anger (kodha), hatred (vera), and ill-will (byāpādo) are all expositions of dosa.\n\nBecause dosa in the form of anger is intrinsic to our human nature, it’s tempting and easy for us to tap into its power in real life in times of stress or fear. It also happens in a business unit or family when one member want to unite or manipulate other’s will to produce certain desired result.\n\nNa hi verena verāni, sammantī’dha kudācanaṃ; Averena ca sammanti, esa dhammo sanantano.\n\nHatred can never be ended by hatred; they always have the same effects; Only non-hatred will do, this is an eternal law.\n\nDhammapada.Yamaka Vagga.verse 5\n\nmettā Karunā muditā upekkhā\n\nThe four brahmavihāras are great antidotal qualities for dosa. It starts with kindness (mettā), a perfect virtue of sympathy, which gives happiness to all living beings; then the knowledge and conscious revelation of the interconnectedness of all sentient beings matures to a deep sense of empathy and compassion (karunā), with a wish (chanda) to remove pains from living beings by building a better world with brahman values; out of karunā one may postpone entrance into nibbāna to work for the salvation of others, a bodhisattva’s way; with faith and hope for all to attain liberation, gives rise to confidence and perfect joy (muditā); being free from attachment to everything, it finally leads to perfect calm and liberation (upekkhā).\n\nGautama Buddha is both a sāman and a brahman (AN 8.85 Samaṇa sutta). While both ways help each other, the sāman approach focuses on a deep concentration (samādhi) and associated psychic powers (siddhi), and the brahman approach focuses on profound knowledge and wisdom (pañña), to support brahmacariya and brahmavihāras. Indeed Gautama Buddha is also a Master of Veda knowledge (Vedagū).\n\nThe Tradition of the Brahmans (Brāhmaṇa Dhammika Sutta)\n\nIsayo pubbakā āsuṁ, saññatattā tapassino;\n\nPañca kāmaguṇe hitvā, attadattham acārisuṁ.\n\nThe rishis (isayo) of the past, were self-controlled (saññatattā) and attained mastery over their senses (tāpasino); having abandoned the pleasures which are to be enjoyed by means of the five senses (kāmaguṇa), their self has reached where it belongs, home (attadattham).\n\nNa pasū brāhmaṇānāsuṁ, na hiraññaṁ na dhāniyaṁ;\n\nSajjhāya dhanadhaññāsuṁ, brahmaṁ nidhimapālayuṁ.\n\nThe brahmans of the past did not own cattle, nor did they keep bullion and grain; meditation (jhāya) was their wealth and grain, a hidden treasure (nidhi) from Brahma gods to escape (palāyati).\n\nYaṁ nesaṁ pakataṁ āsi, dvārabhattaṁ upaṭṭhitaṁ;\n\nSaddhā pakatamesānaṁ, dātave tadamaññisuṁ.\n\nWhatever was prepared for them, such food was placed at their doors; such was prepared with faith, by earnest seekers.\n\nNānārattehi vatthehi, sayanehāvasathehi ca;\n\nPhītā janapadā raṭṭhā, te namassiṁsu brāhmaṇe.\n\nWith cloths dyed various colors, with bedding, and with dwellings, prosperous countries and kingdoms, paid homage to those brahmans.\n\nAvajjhā brāhmaṇā āsuṁ, ajeyyā dhammarakkhitā;\n\nNa ne koci nivāresi, kuladvāresu sabbaso.\n\nThe brahmans of the past were not to be killed (avajjhā), not growing old (ajeyyā), with preserved dhamma (dhammarakkhitā), no one would stop them, at the doors of their homes.\n\nAṭṭhacattālīsaṁ vassāni, (komāra) Brahmacariyaṁ cariṁsu te;\n\nVijjācaraṇa pariyeṭṭhiṁ, Acaruṁ brāhmaṇā pure.\n\nFor forty-eight years they observed, a pure life of celibacy (brahmacariya); the brahmans in the past pursued, the search for whatever leading to enlightenment.\n\nNa brāhmaṇā aññamagamuṁ, napi bhariyaṁ kiṇiṁsu te;\n\nSampiyeneva saṁvāsaṁ, saṅgantvā samarocayuṁ.\n\nThe brahmans did not marry outside their bloodline, nor did they purchase a wife; having united through affection, they agreed to live together.\n\nAññatra tamhā samayā, utuveramaṇiṁ pati;\n\nmethunaṁ dhammaṁ, nāssu gacchanti brāhmaṇā.\n\nBrahmans never approached their wives for sex, during the time outside her fertile season.\n\nBrahmacariyañca sīlañca, ajjavaṁ maddavaṁ tapaṁ;\n\nSoraccaṁ avihiṁsañca, khantiñcāpi avaṇṇayuṁ.\n\nThey praised the pure life of celibacy (brahmacariya) and good behavior (sīla), righteousness (ajjava), mildness (maddava), and simplicity (tapa), gentleness (soracca), nonviolence (avihiṁsañca), and patience (khanti).\n\nYo nesaṁ paramo āsi, Brahmā daḷha parakkamo;\n\nSa vāpi methunaṁ dhammaṁ, Supinantepi nāgamā.\n\nThe best among them, firm in the Brahma gods and transcend human sexual tendency; did not engage in sex, even in dream.\n\nKhuddaka Nikaya.Sutta Nipāta.2.7 Brāhmaṇa Dhammika Sutta (The Tradition of the Brahmans)\n\nReflection\n\nThink, Reason, Meditate, Yoniso Manasikara, Sampajañña, Satipatthana\n\nWe need to understand how our minds work, so we can work our minds better.\n\nanonymous\n\nWe tend to believe we are perfectly aware of our daily activities, but in fact it’s on the contrary. When we stand up from our chair to grab a book on the shelf, we know automatically what to do to achieve a fully standing position. We do not think “How should I move my body?” or “Where should I put my feet?” We automatically know the situation and the proper process to reach our goal based on our past experience. Concert pianists memorize their music away from the keyboard so as to avoid the predicament in which their fingers “know” the music but they do not. Other examples are found in many everyday activities that become automatic and improve with practice, such as driving a car, riding a bicycle, typing on a keyboard, entering a PIN, playing a game, Rubik’s cube, martial arts, dancing and so on. We may feel like our body remembers how to do it, but truth is it is the preprogrammed instincts and habits in our subconscious mind that remembers how to run the bodily activities.\n\nThis automatic behavioral ability, or mindlessness, is important for us to smoothly interact with the environment as it allows us to efficiently execute our actions without spending time planning every single step which is way too much for the human mind to process. These behaviors are often acquired skills, actions that become habitual after significant repetition. When we begin to learn an action, such as driving, we think of the action at a very detailed level. We think ‘engage clutch, move gear shift down into second, lift left foot off the clutch and right foot onto gas.’ Skill acquisition starts off as labored, conscious learning and after consistent, frequent practice becomes more automatic and unconscious. Once the action is well learned, the behavior becomes automatic or mindless in the sense that it does not require constant conscious monitoring. This automaticity allows us no longer to think about the details of driving, and instead our mind can shift to another task, such as chatting on the cell phone along the way, and we may remember very little of the driving experience once we arrive at our destination.\n\nNow we know our mind operates largely outside of consciousness, and unconscious processing runs everything in our lives. In fact, most of human behavior is dictated by the subconscious part of the mind. It manages our bodily functions like breathing, digestion, blood circulation, etc. to ensure our survival and maintain our well-being. It controls body temperature, hunger, thirst, fatigue, sleep, and circadian rhythms. It stores our beliefs, our past experience, our memories, our skills. Everything that we have seen, done or thought is also there. It is also our guidance system. The subconscious mind is always active, day and night. It records our daily life experiences and stores our memories in the form of images, symbols and emotions. These life experiences become our new consciousness. Emotions are the main language of the subconscious mind. When we are awake, we can consciously notice the emotional changes that we experience and hence understand what the subconscious mind is trying to tell us. When we are asleep and our conscious mind isn’t active, the subconscious mind conveys its messages via images, inner sound and symbols.\n\nRupa is hardware, vedana is input, sañña is internal processing, sankhara is output, viññāṇa is AI. This reprogrammable organic android called human has deep learning algorithm, but is equipped with a very weak power source.\n\nMudita on Humanity\n\nNot only our behaviors, much of what we say, and even our thoughts and decisions, are actually generated in our subconscious mind with little awareness. Our subconscious mind interprets, evaluates, and analyses a great deal of incoming information and react to that information as thoughts and decisions. This is done automatically even when our conscious mind is occupied. Our subconscious judgement, feeling, and motivation constitutes our personalities and habits, including traits and abilities (e.g., “What is my main objective or motivation in life?” “Why am I socially inept in certain situations?” “Why do I sometimes lack motivation for doing homework?”). They give us a false sense of self. We are not who we think we are. If we look at the nature of it, they are just accumulated past experience (habits, karma), which leads to sufferings. If we consider this aggregate of consciousness from past experiences as real self identity, then we will love and entrapped in it. Instead, we need to view it as changeable and work on it with mindful awareness.\n\nThe subconscious feelings and preferences toward other people and objects may also trigger changes to our mental state without our being in the least degree of awareness, until we have our attention directed to it. It is completely normal that from time to time, we may experience self-doubts, negative thoughts, unreasonable fears, upsets, or irrational behaviors. The painful experience of the past (this life and past lives) could have an effect upon our present emotional state and behavior without even our knowing.\n\nOur thoughts, decisions and behaviors are generated in our subconscious mind and follow certain patterns. These patterns of our thoughts, words and behaviors are called habits. These habits are determined by our past experiences of this life and past lives and become an indispensable part of our personality and govern most of our daily life activities. As a human being, we are naturally drawn to habitual patterns because repetition creates familiarity and comfort. Sometimes, however, our habits can interfere with our ability to behave in a desired or appropriate fashion. Our subconscious mind constantly evaluates surrounding environment using stereotypes to categorize based on past experiences. These habitual thought patterns can lead to unconscious prejudices which could be dangerous if we don’t knowingly guard against them. Indeed, there are times in which we might wish what we say or what we do to be different and more in line with our conscious and controlled intentions.\n\nSometimes habitual behaviors can even develop into impulsiveness and addiction. The difference between habit and addiction is just the amount of effort and time required to change the behavior. Addiction often demands an integrative, long-term plan to be treated. From liberation point of view, our cravings for sex and love and worldly pleasures are all addictions, same as overeating or alcohol use, and only by disconnecting them, we can reach levels of liberation.\n\nRecondition\n\nProgramming, Engineer, Rewire, Brainwash, Insight Meditation, Vipassana\n\nOur subconscious mind constantly evaluates surrounding environment, warns of danger, records and processes information, communicates with other dimension, generates ideas and thoughts and cravings, and initiates action. The content and quality of our subconscious mind determines our emotional state and drives our lives. Each moment our conscious mind records information processed from every sight, every sound, every taste, smell, pain, touch, and emotion etc. These recordings then pass on and are stored in the subconscious mind in the form of images, symbols and emotions. Our mind uses such past information to make conscious decisions, or even unconscious ones to solve our daily life problems. Some of those past experiences are pleasant and happy, but some could be traumatic and damaging. During our daily life, what we see, hear, taste, smell, or touch may trigger certain painful experience hidden in our subconscious mind, this is the cause of our fears, insecurities, negative thoughts, unwanted emotions and irrational behaviors. This is what Buddha pointed out for the cognitive and emotional causes of suffering from past kamma.\n\nAlthough we cannot prevent sufferings from maturing from past life experiences, we can stop causing more from what we are doing. The emotional cause is craving and its negative opposite, ill will. The cognitive cause is ignorance of the way things truly occur, or of three marks of existence: that all worldly things are impermanent, unsatisfactory, and without essential self. Craving (taṇhā) is the root of suffering, and of the ever-continuing cycle of death and rebirth. We are what we love. Our wants and longings and cravings are at the core of our identity. The wellspring from which our actions flow. We are defined not by what we know but by what we crave. The insidious thing about this love is that it’s unconscious default settings in our subconscious mind. It’s this kind of love we just gradually slip into, day after day, getting more and more selective about what we see and how we measure value without ever being fully aware that that’s what we’re doing.\n\nWhat, o monks, is the origin of suffering? It is that craving (taṇhā) which gives rise to ever-fresh rebirth and, bound up with pleasure and attachment (rāga), now here, now there, finds ever fresh delight. It is the sensual craving (kāma-taṇhā), the craving for rebirth (bhava-taṇhā), the craving for life to end (vibhava-taṇhā).\n\nD.22.19 Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta\n\nThe cravings in our subconsciousness both point us in the direction of this realm and propel us toward it after we die. When our cravings are absorbed with material things, then its weight will drags us toward the kāma realm like gravity. Taṇhā is the eighth link in the formula of the dependent origination (paticcasamuppāda). By breaking the cravings, we can break the chain reaction of death and rebirth cycle and end this samsāra.\n\nSati, or awareness, is a unique strength of human mind. It is a focused, calm, non-judgmental mind state, always bringing back its attention to the present moment. It is the state for the mind to know what is happening, such as hearing a sound, but knowing it free of emotional grasping or aversion. The training for sati meditation is Kayagatasati (mindfulness directed to the body), just breathe naturally, stay in the moment, live in the here and now, with total acceptance. Total acceptance means totally accept the reality of our own life. We stop fighting this reality and learn to tolerate it. It is this freedom that can provide the platform for more sustained transformation and insight. It helps us break through the habits, the biases and the lies that are woven around our lives. By quiet observation of habituated thought patterns and emotions, we are enabled to interrupt what can be an unhealthy tendency to over-identify with and stress out about the transient contents of the mind.\n\nAnd what, bhikkhus, is the destination? The destruction of lust, the destruction of hatred, the destruction of delusion: this is called the destination. And what, bhikkhus, is the path leading to the destination? Kayagatasati: this is called the path leading to the destination.\n\nSN 43.44 Parāyana Sutta: The Destination\n\nA mindful state of consciousness is characterized by awareness turned inward toward present felt experience. It is passive, though alert, open, curious, and exploratory. It seeks to simply be aware of what is, as opposed to attempting to do or confirm anything. It is the opposite of busyness, where we get trapped and lost in our activities in a sort of mindlessness.\n\nThis pure awareness training can increase concentrative strength, creativity, happiness, and effectiveness. It helps to increase performance and to reduce stress and suffering. Mindfulness courses have become popular in the corporate world as well to help stressed-out employees maintain calm and focus in the midst of hectic business life. It is also used in military training, such as mindful snipers, who are trained to be so focused, never distracted, very calm, always bringing back his attention to the present moment. And non-judgmental — just kill people and no judgment.\n\nThis secular mindfulness practice typically offers mindfulness without ethical values, which we have to correct for our practice. Mindfulness is inseparable from the ethical framework that integrates knowledge and wisdom, and also positive emotional assets or virtues such as compassion, empathy and caring. This is called sati sampajānna (mindfulness with wise discernment). This is the Right Mindfulness (Samma-Sati). It is the critical constituents of the noble eight-fold path that leads to nibbāna, the end of attachment, ill will and delusion (rāga, dosa & moha).\n\nVirtues are just good moral habits. They are character traits that we become part of us to be compassionate, forgiving, and so forth. They are different from moral laws or rules, which are external stipulations of the good. To become virtuous is to internalize the law so that it is cultivated in our subconscious mind and we follow it automatically. This is one of the purposes of conscious living (Satipatthana).\n\nNext step is for samadhi meditation to work on our subconscious mind in order to release negative emotions. This is a healing and purifying process. The communication between the subconscious and the conscious mind is bidirectional. Every time when we have an idea, or an emotion, a memory or an image from the past, this is the subconscious mind communicating to our conscious mind. We can also consciously communicate and work on the subconscious mind as well. For example, when we meditate and start to relax and be mindful on the breath, we are trying to tame our subconscious mind and purposely change it to different states with full awareness. This is the main purpose of our meditation practice to work on our subconsciousness to reduce sufferings and cultivate positive and wholesome mental qualities with the help of pañña, in order to finally achieve ultimate liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth in this samsāra world. Meditation doesn’t just touch the calm, cool, collected space of reflection and contemplation; and the pañña training isn’t an intellectual project, a matter of acquiring knowledge. The purpose of our practice is to purify the heated, passionate regions of the heart, so our cravings, like a fire, gone out through lack of fuel (aggi anāhāro nibbuto).\n\nIn summary, by analyzing the internal mechanism of how this death and birth cycle works, it comes to light that human mind is highly conditioned in a way that the mind is trapped to this world. Like animals, humans also subject to preprogrammed instincts, the difference is only that we are able to use more unlocked capabilities and thus could have more potentials. But unfortunately most humans operate under auto pilot mode. It is possible to recondition the mind (vipassana) for purification (visuddha) and liberation (vimutta), to train our mind in order to modify our thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs. This process is called vipassana. For example, we can condition our mind either as “sex is great, it is the happiest thing for humans”; or as “sex is absolutely disgusting”. We deem the former leads to samsara and the latter (asubhānupasana), which is truth (sacca) and right view (sammā diṭṭhi), leads to liberation (vimutta). Theravada Buddhism is for those spiritually awaken, after realizing the unsatisfactory impure and suffering nature (dukkha) of the world, just want out to go to nibbāna.\n\nNibbāna, a Reality to Tathāgata\n\nReal, Beyond, Peace, Deathless, Blissful, Final Destination for Humans\n\nBy transcending the worldly self of five aggregates, it comes the death of the ego, the false self, and one discovers the true self. The true self is Nibbāna. Nibbāna is the destiny for humans and as well as devas who want to escape from sufferings in this world. It is not difficult to reach with reasonable efforts. It is important to set it as a goal when we practice which acts as a roadmap to the journey of growth. What is Nibbāna and how do we reach it then?\n\nYato kho ayaṁ, brāhmaṇa, anavasesaṁ rāgakkhayaṁ paṭisaṁvedeti, anavasesaṁ dosakkhayaṁ paṭisaṁvedeti, anavasesaṁ mohakkhayaṁ paṭisaṁvedeti; evaṁ kho, brāhmaṇa, sandiṭṭhikaṁ nibbānaṁ hoti akālikaṁ ehipassikaṁ opaneyyikaṁ paccattaṁ veditabbaṁ viññūhī”ti.\n\nWhen, brahmana, one experiences the complete destruction of attachment (raga), the complete destruction of anger (dosa), and the complete destruction of ignorance (moha), it is in this way that nibbāna directly manifest in this world (sandiṭṭhika), that it is eternal (akālika), open to all (ehipassika), leading to liberation (opaneyyika), by each self (paccatta) it can be known (veditabba) with intelligence (viññūhī).\n\nAN 3.55 Nibbāna Sutta\n\nAccording to the Pali texts, nibbāna is real (sacca), beyond / not in this world (pāra), perfect (nipuṇa), peaceful (santa), deathless (amata), sublime / excellent (paṇīta), auspicious (siva), safe (khema), wonderful (acchariya), marvellous (abbhuta), free from harm (anītika), unafflicted (abyābajjha), dispassioned (virāga), pure (suddhi), liberated (mutti), free from attachment (anālaya), blissful (sugata), final destination (parāyana), and so on. (SN 43.44).\n\nWe live in a physical world. we have a body (kaya) and a mind (citta). When it’s time for the body to become unusable, it is discarded (death), the mind citta then gets on with another body (birth). This cycle goes on and on (samsara). Some people may think the death of the physical body is the end of everything (sakaya-ditthi). Then this would be the first truth to realize, that death is merely the end of the body, the mind lives on.\n\nAnekajāti saṃsāraṃ, sandhāvissaṃ anibbisaṃ; Gahakāraṃ gavesanto: dukkhā jāti punappunaṃ. Gahakāraka diṭṭho’si, puna gehaṃ na kāhasi; Sabbā te phāsukā bhaggā, gahakūṭaṃ visaṅkhataṃ; Visaṅkhāragataṃ cittaṃ, taṇhānaṃ khayam ajjhagā.\n\nThrough many births I wandered in samsāra, seeking, but not finding, the builder of this house. Painful is repeated birth. O house-builder! You are seen now. You will build no house again. All your rafters are broken. Your ridge-pole is shattered. My mind has gone to the unconditioned. Achieved is the destruction of craving.\n\nDhammapada. Jarā Vagga.verse 8-9\n\nThe human body as matter (rupa), is traditionally considered as one of the five khandas or aggregates. Matter as aggregate is made of small particles and can theoretically be transformed into energy based on Einstein’s mass–energy equivalence formula of E=MC2, thus considered as unreal existence. Indeed matter is just a condensed form of energy. The other four aggregates of sensation (vedanā), perceptions (saññā), volition (saṅkhāra) and consciousness (viññāṇa) are considered as aggregates because they are dependent on the body, the rupa khanda. They form the unique mentality (nama) of a person and can not exist on their own. Thus they are considered as unreal existence as well. The five aggregates helps the human being to live and interact with the physical world. They are not real and not self (anattā) (SN 22.59 Anatta-lakkhana Sutta). When the person dies, they will depart from the body and transform while the essence of the mind citta continues the samsara from the space (ākāsa) dimension, to incarnate a new body and other aggregates, or in other words, “build a new house”. The essence of the mind citta is transformed and kindled in the fire dimension to become human consciousness (viññāṇa), with previous kamma acquired in the wind dimension; and from the water dimension, it acquires longevity together with other qualities of life; and in earth dimension, a body; this finishes the process of birth into this physical world.\n\nThe relationship for citta, mana and viññāṇa can be described as trinity. Mana is the will, an incarnation of the mind citta to hold the consciousness viññāṇa as a container for protection purpose, like the eggshell to hold and protect an egg assuming the whole mind structure is like an egg. Viññāṇa is also an incarnation of the mind citta, transformed and kindled in the fire dimension to become human consciousness, like the egg white. It works with the body to interact with the physical world and record all life experiences. Citta is interdimensional. It is the essence of the whole mind, like the egg yolk, though it is often used to refer to the mind, the whole egg. In fact, mana is sometimes used to refer to the whole egg as well in some literatures because like eggshell it covers and is obviously the visible part. Some Buddhist scholars and practitioners along the history even casually use them interchangeably. This created confusion and caused more concepts such as Bodhicitta, Buddha nature, pure consciousness and so on to describe the essence of the mind. The space (ākāsa) dimension is also called the dimension of consciousness. Consciousness is the underlying reality and the base dimension for numerous dimensions and realms clustered in tree structure, including our physical dimension/reality. In our universe, everything is made of consciousness. It is the reality out of which our universe is made. This dimension of consciousness consists of a raw, primordial form of consciousness though. It is chaotic, violent and quantum. It forms the base of the universe corresponds to the dark energy in today’s science. When some primordial consciousness evolves into various degrees of ordered forms, it gives birth to intelligent beings in the space dimension. Citta is a highly ordered form of consciousness.\n\nWhen a person dies, the mana breaks into pieces. But because it is indeed hard like eggshell, it will take long time to dissolve. For this reason, a divine will can incarnate many human beings in sequence, such as the Dalai Lama cases. When that person dies, one of the broken pieces may be purposely willed to a specific person and then become officially the heir. When the mana breaks into pieces, it can no longer hold the viññāṇa, which will then depart from the body and slowly merge with the collective consciousness of the planet. Yet although the viññāṇa is departed from the body, there are still slight connection remains for the trinity at least before their full transformation. The ancient tradition of mummification is to use this connection to communicate with paranormal power. Ancient cultures such as Egyptian and Chinese further classified viññāṇa into many components, and studied how some parts may stay with the body and some parts would leave the body in different ways and for different purposes. There were even wicked practices in our previous civilization to control some parts to remain with the dead body, thus created various types of dead things such as vampires, zombies and so on. This is one of the reasons our previous civilization was terminated and uprooted catastrophically about twelve thousand years ago.\n\nAsatōmā sadgamaya\n\nTamasōmā jyōtirgamaya\n\nMrtyōrmā amrtamgamaya\n\nFrom the unreal, lead me to the real;\n\nFrom the darkness, lead me to the light;\n\nFrom death, lead me to immortality.\n\nBṛhadāraṇyaka Upanishad 1.3.28\n\nWhen a view is firmly established on how to reach the beyond, this faith and confidence (saddha) will lead to a dramatic life style (sīla) change. A wholesome lifestyle can also influence and even shape the mental status. Theravada encourages conscious living (sati patthana). It is to develop the special mental factor, awareness (sati), to constantly monitor and evaluate our thoughts, speeches and actions, with sustained effort (viriya) both at day time and at night. If the thought, speech or action is deemed unwholesome, we will try to let it go; otherwise we will try to nurture and sustain it. This is called the Four Right Exertions (samma padhāna) for both the arising and non-arising various mental and physical volitions (sankhāra).\n\nSabbapāpassa akaraṇaṃ, kusalassa upasampadā; Sacittapariyodapanaṃ, etaṃ buddhāna sāsanaṃ.\n\nNot to do any evil, to cultivate good. To purify one’s mind, this is the teaching of the Buddha.\n\n— Dhammapada.Buddha Vagga.verse 5.\n\nSamādhi\n\nOur historic Gautama Buddha is a discoverer of the ancient path of liberation. These knowledges were passed down from super beings in ancient time before the great flood when early humans live with gods on earth. The samādhi practice traces back to an even earlier time when our remote ancestors living with reptilian gods, dragons and nāgas, and received knowledges from them. This includes the knowledge of the human body such as chakras and yogic practices including samādhi to master the energy of the human body. The goal of samādhi was to generate an energy body made of fine matter, and with the mind citta dwells with this super body, it can not only wield psychic powers in this physical world but also to travel to the space dimension, leaving the human body behind like a dead log. This was considered a form of immortality by some ancient people, but it indeed is a step closer toward Nibbana.\n\nA concentrated mind helps the realization of Nibbāna with its strength and power. It leads to knowledges and visions (ñāna­dassa) and mindfulness and clear comprehension (satisampajaññā). It supports reconditioning efforts into our deep subconscious part of the mind for the destruction of the taints (āsavānaṁ khayā). When the mind is in perfect calm, we experience inner brightness. We will be able to release negative emotions from past experiences, and have a more cleansed and purified mind. The true nature of the mind will shine through, which is kind, emotionally balanced, compassionate, empathic, tolerant, forgiving, modest, grateful. It constantly connects to a realm of vibrant peace, with a subtle emanation of joy arising from deep within. The more we connect with it, the more it grows through us. When withdrawing from our identification with the worldly character and disposition of our self, consciousness in its pure state prior to identification with form will then be able to reach a timeless and deathless realm.\n\nThe Way to the Beyond\n\nSaṅkhāya lokasmiṁ paroparāni,\n\nYassiñjitaṁ natthi kuhiñci loke;\n\nSanto vidhūmo anīgho nirāso,\n\nAtari so jātijaranti brūmī.\n\nHaving considered the world’s highs and lows,\n\nHe is not disturbed by anything in the world.\n\nPeaceful, non-violent, untroubled, desireless, he has,\n\nI say, crossed over birth and old age.\n\n— AN 4.41.Pārāyana\n\nBhante Muditā Thero\n\nBhante Muditā Thero was ordained and trained in Pa Auk Forest Monastery and Meditation Center in Myanmar in November 2013. Before that he studied Buddhist teachings and scriptures extensively, with a yearning for secluded meditation and dissatisfied with worldly life, he took on the life of a hermit monk. After six years secluded bhikkhu life in Myanmar, he visited Toronto and resided with the Sri Lankan Mahamevnawa Monastery Toronto Sangha for about one year. Since February 2020, bhante has been in Thailand with the Wat Tham Krissana forest sangha. Through his practice, bhante realized that with proper training of the mind, it is possible to realize nibbāna in lifetime. His teaching focuses on the essential aspects of the path to liberation and in a simple and direct way.\n\nIf you have question about dhamma practices, you may contact:"
