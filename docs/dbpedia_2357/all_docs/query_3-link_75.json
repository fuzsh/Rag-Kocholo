Additionally, the presence of anticyclones further complicates the situation, exacerbating the severity of heat waves in affected areas.\n\nWhat Role Do Heat Waves Play in Global Warming?\n\nHeat waves result from climate change, caused by the burning of fossil fuels that add Greenhouse Gases (GHG) to the atmosphere.\n\nThese gasses trap more heat energy, increasing average and extreme temperatures.\n\nGHG emissions from human activities have heated the planet by about 1.2 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times.\n\nThat warmer baseline means higher temperatures can be reached during extreme heat events.\n\nGlobal warming causes uneven temperature changes across regions, leading to local variations in heat waves.\n\nDespite some areas experiencing cooler temperatures, global warming can create conditions that intensify heat waves locally, influenced by land use and geography.\n\nUnderstanding these local effects is important for accurate forecasting and effective heat wave mitigation.\n\nWhat is an Anticyclone?\n\nHigh-Pressure Systems: Anticyclones are areas of high atmospheric pressure, the opposite of cyclones (low pressure).\n\nWind Circulation: Winds blow clockwise around an anticyclone in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere due to Earth's rotation (Coriolis Effect).\n\nClear Skies and Calm Weather: Anticyclones bring stable, calm conditions with little wind and clear skies.\n\nDry Air: Sinking air in anticyclones warms up and dries out, leading to less rain and humidity.\n\nSummer vs. Winter Effects: Summer anticyclones can be hot and sunny, while winter anticyclones can be cold and clear with morning frost.\n\nWhat Links Anticyclones to Heat?\n\nAnticyclones and Heat:\n\nAnticyclones are linked to heat through their persistence and strength.\n\nDuring the pre-monsoon season, the Indian Easterly Jet (IEJ) and a strong westerly jet can generate an anticyclonic pattern over the Indian Ocean and the Indian subcontinent.\n\nA strong anticyclone can bring dry and hot weather over many parts of India, while a weak anticyclone produces milder weather.\n\nIEJ is a narrow belt of strong easterly winds in the mid-troposphere that blows over peninsular India and the adjoining south Indian Ocean during the pre-monsoon season (March-May).\n\nIt is weaker and smaller than the well-known African Easterly Jet (AEJ).\n\nAEJ occurs in the lower troposphere over West Africa. It is characterized by easterly winds and is most prominent during the summer months.\n\nIt is formed due to the temperature contrast between the hot Sahara Desert and the cooler Gulf of Guinea.\n\nImpact of Anticyclones on Weather Patterns:\n\nStrong IEJ years lead to higher near-surface temperatures and drier conditions in India, while weak IEJ years result in cooler and wetter conditions.\n\nThe strength of the anticyclone in a particular year is a key factor in determining whether it is related to heat waves and global warming.\n\nThe impact of El Niño on the Indian subcontinent tends to produce stronger and more persistent anticyclones, leading to longer-lasting and more intense heat waves.\n\nUnderstanding the background state of cool seasonal temperatures and strong, persistent anticyclones is essential for accurate weather predictions and early warnings.\n\nRecent Impact of Anticyclones:\n\nThe recent anticyclonic circulations over the North Indian Ocean were responsible for abnormal rainfall in Odisha in March 2024. Anticyclones, characterized by clockwise winds and sinking air, can create high-pressure heat domes.\n\nThis phenomenon may have also contributed to floods in Dubai in April 2024.\n\nEarly Warning Systems\n\nAccurate early-warning systems for global warming use a three-step approach called the ‘ready-set-go’ system.\n\nThe approach is part of the ‘Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Predictions (S2S)’ project of the World Climate Research Program under the World Meteorological Organisation.\n\nIndia is part of this project and has invested heavily in S2S predictions.\n\nThe three-step approach is important for guiding the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) to function efficiently and effectively.\n\nThe ‘ready’ step provides a seasonal outlook based on external factors such as global warming and El Niño.\n\nThe ‘set’ step involves sub seasonal predictions for weeks two to four, contributing to resource allocations and identifying potential hotspots.\n\nThe ‘go’ step is based on short- and medium-range forecasts and involves managing disaster response efforts.\n\nHowever, the challenge lies in enhancing local-level weather predictions. Efforts are underway to forecast weather trajectories over a 10-year span.\n\nCoordination and early warning mechanisms are being developed at different levels, requiring training and engagement of governments, departments, and the public.\n\nThe success of these systems is crucial for India's sustained economic development.\n\nRead more...\n\nUPSC Civil Services Examination Previous Year’s Questions (PYQs)\n\nPrelims:\n\nQ. Consider the following statements: (2020)\n\nJet streams occur in the Northern Hemisphere only.\n\nOnly some cyclones develop an eye.\n\nThe temperature inside the eye of a cyclone is nearly 10ºC lesser than that of the surroundings.\n\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\n\n(a) 1 only\n\n(b) 2 and 3 only\n\n(c) 2 only\n\n(d) 1 and 3 only\n\nAns: (c)\n\nExp:\n\nJet Stream is a geostrophic wind blowing horizontally through the upper layers of the troposphere, generally from west to east, at an altitude of 20,000 - 50,000 feet.\n\nJet Streams develop where air masses of different temperatures meet. So, usually surface temperatures determine where the Jet Stream will form.\n\nGreater the difference in temperature, faster is the wind velocity inside the jet stream. Jet Streams extend from 20° latitude to the poles in both hemispheres. Hence, statement 1 is not correct.\n\nCyclones are of two types, tropical cyclone and temperate cyclone. The center of a tropical cyclone is known as the ‘eye’, where the wind is calm at the center with no rainfall.\n\nHowever, in a temperate cyclone, there is not a single place where winds and rains are inactive, so the eye is not found. Hence, statement 2 is correct.\n\nThe eye of a tropical cyclone is warmer, not colder, and it is this warmer temperature that drives the storm. Hence, statement 3 is not correct.\n\nMains\n\nQ. Tropical cyclones are largely confined to the South China Sea, Bay of Bengal and Gulf of Mexico. Why? (2014)\n\nBiodiversity & Environment\n\nConstructed Wetlands\n\nFor Prelims: Benefits of constructed wetlands, Types of constructed wetlands, Wetlands, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)\n\nFor Mains: How constructed wetlands can help India's water crisis, Using constructed wetlands for sustainable development India\n\nSource: DTE\n\nWhy in News?\n\nRecently, there has been a shift towards constructed wetlands, which are a more comprehensive and nature-based solution for industrial wastewater treatment, as compared to traditional methods that have proven inadequate in addressing the array of pollutants present.\n\nWhat are Constructed Wetlands?\n\nAbout:\n\nConstructed wetlands are engineered systems designed to replicate the natural processes of wetlands for wastewater treatment.\n\nThey consist of carefully selected vegetation, soil, and water that work together to purify wastewater.\n\nThese wetlands are specifically designed to promote the growth of beneficial microorganisms and plants that can break down pollutants and improve water quality.\n\nTypes of Constructed Wetlands\n\nSubsurface Flow (SSF): SSF wetlands involve passing wastewater through gravel beds or porous media, where microbial activity degrades organic matter.\n\nSurface Flow (SF): SF wetlands have water flowing above the surface, often creating aesthetically pleasing landscapes with diverse vegetation.\n\nBenefits of Constructed Wetlands:\n\nNeed: Traditional treatment methods, such as physical and chemical treatments, often struggle to effectively treat the complex mix of pollutants found in industrial wastewater.\n\nThese methods can be costly, energy-intensive, and may not completely remove all contaminants. There comes the role of more comprehensive and sustainable solutions like constructed wetlands.\n\nEnvironmental Benefits: They can serve as habitats for a variety of plant and animal species, contributing to biodiversity conservation.\n\nMoreover, they can provide ecosystem services such as flood control and carbon sequestration, enhancing their ecological significance and value.\n\nConstructed wetlands are also a sustainable solution for water treatment. They require minimal energy and utilize natural processes for purification.\n\nCost-Effective: Compared to traditional wastewater treatment plants, constructed wetlands are less expensive to build, operate, and maintain.\n\nNutrient Removal: They are efficient in removing pollutants like nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter.\n\nLand Reclamation: These systems can be used to reclaim land degraded by mining activities by restoring natural wetland functions.\n\nApplications of Constructed Wetlands:\n\nMunicipal Wastewater Treatment: Constructed wetlands can be a secondary or tertiary treatment stage for municipal wastewater, improving water quality before discharge or reuse.\n\nStormwater Management: These systems can effectively filter stormwater runoff, removing pollutants and sediments before they enter natural waterways.\n\nIndustrial Wastewater Treatment: Constructed wetlands can be adapted to treat specific types of industrial wastewater, depending on the contaminants present.\n\nAgriculture: They can be used to treat agricultural runoff, reduce pollution and improve water quality for irrigation.\n\nExample of Constructed Wetlands in India\n\nThe Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary in Delhi uses constructed wetlands to purify sewage from nearby settlements while also providing a sanctuary for flora and fauna.\n\nSimilarly, the Kolkata East Wetlands in West Bengal treat wastewater from Kolkata while supporting local fishing and agriculture.\n\nIn Rajasthan, the Sariska Tiger Reserve has embarked on an innovative initiative, utilising constructed wetlands for treating wastewater from nearby villages.\n\nWhat is the Difference Between Wetlands and Constructed Wetlands?\n\nFeature Wetlands Constructed Wetlands Origin Naturally occurring ecosystems Engineered systems designed by humans Formation Develop over time through geological processes, flooding, or changes in water flow. Deliberately constructed in a specific location. Water Source Varied - precipitation, groundwater, surface water runoff. Controlled source - wastewater, stormwater runoff, or specific water bodies. Purpose Provide a variety of ecological functions like flood control, water purification, habitat for diverse species. Primarily designed for water treatment (wastewater, stormwater) or specific purposes like habitat creation. Biodiversity Established communities of plants, animals, and microbes adapted to the specific wetland type. Plant species are chosen and introduced, while microbial communities develop over time. Land Area Can range from small ponds to vast marshes, typically covering large areas. Designed with a specific footprint based on treatment needs, can be smaller than natural wetlands. Regulation Often protected under environmental regulations due to their ecological importance. May require permits for construction and operation depending on local regulations. Maintenance Minimal human intervention required after establishment. Regular maintenance needed to ensure proper functioning (water flow, plant health, sediment removal).\n\nWhat are the Challenges associated with the Constructed Wetlands?\n\nPlant Selection: Effective plant selection in constructed wetlands is critical for nutrient absorption and pollutant removal, with species like cattails, bulrushes, and sedges proving particularly adept at absorbing nitrogen and phosphorus while providing habitat for beneficial bacteria to degrade pollutants.\n\nLand Requirement: Constructing wetlands requires a significant amount of land, which might be a limitation in urban areas.\n\nTreatment Efficiency: While effective, constructed wetlands might not achieve the same level of purification as conventional treatment plants for heavily polluted water.\n\nMaintenance Needs: Regular maintenance is required to ensure proper functioning and prevent clogging or mosquito breeding.\n\nOther Challenges: There is a need for clear policies and regulations to promote their adoption, raising awareness and technical expertise among stakeholders, and continuous monitoring and research to optimize their performance.\n\nWay Forward\n\nLeveraging Global Best Practices:\n\nDesign Optimisation: India can learn from countries like Germany and the Netherlands, pioneers in constructed wetland design.\n\nThese nations utilize multi-stage systems with free water surfaces (surface flow) and subsurface flow for optimal treatment depending on the influent characteristics.\n\nPerformance Monitoring: The US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) recommends establishing clear performance monitoring protocols.\n\nRegular monitoring of water quality parameters and wetland health is crucial for optimizing treatment efficiency and identifying potential issues.\n\nImplementing Constructed Wetlands in India:\n\nPolicy and Regulation: The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has already recognised constructed wetlands as a viable wastewater treatment option.\n\nFurther policy frameworks could incentivize their adoption by municipalities and industries, along with clear guidelines for design, operation, and maintenance.\n\nFinancial Instruments: Exploring innovative financing mechanisms like Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and subsidies for constructing and maintaining these systems can attract investment and make them more accessible, particularly for smaller communities.\n\nDemonstration Projects: Establishing successful demonstration projects across diverse geographical and climatic zones in India is crucial.\n\nThis would showcase the effectiveness of constructed wetlands in real-world scenarios and provide valuable data for future applications.\n\nCommunity Engagement: Local communities should be involved in the planning, construction, and operation of constructed wetlands.\n\nRaising awareness about the benefits of these systems and fostering a sense of ownership will ensure their long-term success.\n\nDrishti Mains Question:\n\nQ. Discuss the concept of constructed wetlands as a sustainable solution for industrial wastewater treatment in India. Evaluate the challenges and opportunities associated with the widespread adoption of constructed wetlands in the country.\n\nUPSC Civil Services Examination Previous Year Question (PYQ)\n\nPrelims\n\nQ.

India has now reversed this trend, indicating a shift towards self-sufficiency in this sector.\n\nIndia is the largest manufacturer of generic medicines globally. Its pharmaceutical industry plays a crucial role in global healthcare, providing affordable generic medicines.\n\nIt is currently valued at USD 50 billion as a major pharmaceutical exporter, with over 200+ countries served by Indian pharma exports.\n\nIt is expected to reach USD 65 Billion by 2024 and to USD 130 Billion by 2030.\n\nExport and Import Statistics:\n\nExports: India exported medical consumables and disposables worth USD 1.6 billion, showing a 16% surge over the previous fiscal year (2021-22).\n\nImports: Imports amounted to approximately USD 1.1 billion, indicating a 33% decline.\n\nMajor Challenges with India’s Pharma Sector:\n\nLagging Research and Development (R&D): India's R&D spending in pharma is lower compared to developed nations. This hinders the creation of new drugs.\n\nLimited Innovation Ecosystem: Collaboration between academia, research institutions, and pharmaceutical companies is weak, slowing down development of high qualtity drugs and medical devices.\n\nPrice Controls and Profit Margins: Government price controls on some drugs can limit profits, making it less attractive for companies to invest heavily in R&D for new drugs.\n\nComplex Regulatory Framework: Navigating the approval process for new drugs can be lengthy and complex which leads to red tapism.\n\nSkilled Workforce Shortage: There's a lack of highly qualified scientists and researchers in the pharma sector, which leads to overburdened staff affecting efficiency.\n\nIntellectual Property (IP) Concerns: Uncertainties around IP protection, due to provisions like compulsory licensing (Indian Patents Act 1970), can discourage large pharma investment in India.\n\nImport Dependency: Despite progress, India remains largely dependent on imports for medical devices, with around 70% sourced from other nations.\n\nIndia's heavy dependence on Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) imports, particularly from countries like China.\n\nSubstandard Drugs: One significant issue in the Indian pharmaceutical sector is the occurrence of deaths linked to the consumption of substandard or counterfeit drugs.\n\nIndian-origin medicines leads to multiple deaths of children in Africa and Central Asia.\n\nWhat Further Steps Can be Taken to Reform India’s Pharma Sector?\n\nLegislative Changes and Centralised Database:\n\nDrugs and Cosmetics Act (1940) needs to be amended and the establishment of a centralised drugs database can enhance surveillance and ensure effective regulation across all manufacturers.\n\nAlso, implementing common quality standards across all states is necessary to ensure consistent product quality.\n\nEncouraging Certification:\n\nEncouraging more pharmaceutical manufacturing units to obtain World Health Organization (WHO) Good Manufacturing Practice certification can elevate industry-wide quality standards.\n\nTransparency, Credibility, and Accountability:\n\nThe regulator and the industry must collaborate to enhance India's drug regulatory regime, making it transparent, credible, and aligned with global standards.\n\nFocus on Sustainable Manufacturing Practices:\n\nEmphasising sustainable manufacturing practices, including green chemistry, waste reduction, and energy efficiency, can enhance the sector's environmental sustainability while reducing costs.\n\nMoving Beyond Generics: India excels in producing affordable generic medicines but faces challenges in developing novel drugs.\n\nGovernment support through initiatives like PLI and facilitating clinical trial funding can accelerate research and development efforts.\n\nBoosting R&D and Innovation: India's lower expenditure on research and development compared to global leaders can be improved.\n\nFocus should be to foster public-private partnerships and provide tax incentives for innovation.\n\nNote\n\nRecently, the Union government has assumed sole authority over the issuance of manufacturing licences for new drugs intended for export, thereby transferring this responsibility from state governments.\n\nThis decision was prompted by heightened global scrutiny of Indian-made drugs.\n\nConsequently, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has been designated as the exclusive licensing authority for drugs in India.\n\nManufacturers are now required to obtain a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the CDSCO's respective zonal office.\n\nCDSCO is the Central Drug Authority for discharging functions assigned to the Central Government under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.\n\nThe Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) heads the CDSCO.\n\nUPSC Civil Services Examination, Previous Year Question (PYQ):\n\nPrelims:\n\nQ.

It is located in Mylapore, Chennai, Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe Mylapore region came under the rule of the Hoysala dynasty, particularly King Veera Ballala III.\n\nThe general of the Hoysala army, constructed Dhandanayaka Fort, 680 years ago. The temple in the Dravidian style of architecture was constructed inside the fort.\n\nThe area was later ruled by the Vijayanagara Empire and Tipu Sultan.\n\nThe Battle of Sathyamangalam (1790), during the Third Anglo-Mysore War (1790-1792), also took place near the fort.\n\nThe temple is believed to be the birthplace of Peyalvar, one of the first three of the twelve Alvar saints of the 6th-9th century CE.\n\nThe temple, largely submerged in the water-spread area of the Bhavanisagar dam in Erode district, became visible as the water level in the dam dipped.\n\nTemple Inscription:\n\nThe inscriptions revealed the existence of a village named Thuravalur.\n\nThe area served as a trunk road, and traders crossed River Bhavani and River Moyar to reach Wayanad in Kerala and various places in Karnataka.\n\nConstruction of the Bhavanisagar dam in 1948 resulted in the relocation of nearby residents and the shifting of temple idols to new locations in 1953.\n\nBhavanisagar Dam\n\nIt is located in Erode district, Tamil Nadu, India.\n\nThe dam is constructed on the Bhavani River. It is one of the world's largest earthen dams.\n\nBhavani River originates from the Nilgiri hills of the Western Ghats, enters the Silent Valley National Park in Kerala and flows back towards Tamil Nadu. The Bhavani River is one of the main tributaries of the Cauvery River.\n\nWhat are the Key Facts about Hoysala Dynasty?\n\nOrigin and Rise:\n\nThe Hoysalas were feudatories of the Chalukyas of Kalyana, or the Western Chalukya Empire.\n\nThe first kings came from the hills northwest of Dorasamudra (present-day Halebid), which became their capital in 1060 AD.\n\nThe most notable rulers of the Hoysala dynasty were Vishnuvardhana, Veera Ballala II, and Veera Ballala III.\n\nVishnuvardhana (also known as Bittideva) was the greatest king of the Hoysala dynasty.\n\nThey governed areas spanning Karnataka and Tamil Nadu in the Kaveri (Cauvery) river valley between the 11th- 14th century.\n\nLater, the Vijayanagar dynasty succeeded the Hoysalas.\n\nReligion and Culture:\n\nThe dynasty patronised various religions, such as Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism.\n\nKing Vishnuvardhana was initially a Jain but later converted to Vaishnavism under the influence of the Saint Ramanuja.\n\nTemple Architecture:\n\nThe Hoysala Temples were built during the 12th and 13th centuries CE, showcasing the unique architectural and artistic brilliance of Vesara style.\n\nAmong Hoysala temples, Chennakeshava Temple in Belur, Hoysaleshwara Temple in Halebid, Keshava Temple of Somanathapur are UNESCO World Heritage Sites and protected by Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).\n\nHoysala architecture is known for its distinctive blend of Bhumija style prevalent in Central India, the Nagara traditions of northern and western India, and the Karnataka Dravida modes favoured by the Kalyani Chalukyas.\n\nThese contain multiple shrines grouped around a central pillared hall and laid out in the shape of an intricately designed star.\n\nThey are made out of soapstone which is a relatively soft stone, the artists were able to carve their sculptures intricately.\n\nUPSC Civil Services Examination Previous Year Question (PYQ)\n\nPrelims\n\nQ.

Banking Regulation Act of 1949 is an act that provides a framework for regulating the banks of India.\n\nThis Act gives RBI the power to control the behavior of banks. This Act was passed as the Banking Companies Act of 1949.\n\nThis Act monitors the day-to-day operations of the bank. Under this Act, the RBI can license banks, put regulation over shareholding and voting rights of shareholders, look over the appointment of the boards and management, and lay down the instructions for audits. RBI also plays a role in mergers and liquidation.\n\nNo banking company can operate in India without a license from the RBI, which can inspect the company's books before granting the license and can also cancel the license if the company ceases its banking operations in India.\n\nPrompt Corrective Action (PCA) Framework:\n\nThe PCA Framework by the RBI is a supervisory strategy directed at banks that exhibit weak financial metrics.\n\nThe RBI’s PCA Framework involves monitoring key performance indicators of banks, such as the Capital to Risk-weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR), Net Non-Performing Assets (NNPA) ratio, and the Leverage Ratio ( level of debt incurred by a business entity against several other accounts in its balance sheet, income statement).\n\nIf a bank breaches certain risk thresholds set for these indicators, the RBI may invoke PCA, which can lead to restrictions on dividend distribution, branch expansion, and management compensation, among other things.\n\nThe objective of the PCA Framework is to encourage banks to take corrective steps preemptively to mitigate the risks posed by low capital levels, poor asset quality, or unprofitable operations.\n\nIt also aims to impose market discipline by making the financial conditions of banks transparent.\n\nComparative Analysis with Past Actions by the RBI\n\nIn December 2020, HDFC Bank was barred from launching new digital products and sourcing new credit card customers due to recurring outages in its internet and mobile banking platforms.\n\nIn October 2023, the Bank of Baroda was directed to suspend fresh onboarding of customers onto its 'Bob World' mobile application over \"certain material supervisory concerns.\"\n\nUPSC Civil Services Examination, Previous Year Questions (PYQs)\n\nPrelims\n\nQ.

Calcification of soft tissue is a condition where calcium salts accumulate in soft tissue, causing it to harden.\n\nIt is widely utilised for imaging various body parts such as the brain, cardiovascular system, spinal cord, joints, muscles, liver, and arteries.\n\nUnlike X-rays, which use radiation, MRI scans leverage powerful magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of soft tissues within the body.\n\nProfessor Paul C. Lauterbur and Peter Mansfield won the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their innovative research which resulted in the invention of MRI.\n\nWorking Principle of MRI:\n\nHydrogen Atom Utilisation: An MRI procedure utilises hydrogen atoms present in the body part being scanned.\n\nMRI Machine Components: The MRI machine consists of four essential components, including a superconducting magnet, a radiofrequency pulse emitter, and a detector.\n\nMagnetic Field Application: The superconducting magnet produces a strong and stable magnetic field around the body, causing the hydrogen atoms' spin axes to align either parallel or antiparallel to the field.\n\nRadiofrequency Pulse Emission: A radiofrequency pulse is emitted into the body part under the scanner, exciting only the small population of unmatched hydrogen atoms.\n\nSignal Detection and Image Formation: The emitted energy from the excited atoms is detected by a receiver and converted into signals.\n\nThese signals are then used by a computer to create two- or three-dimensional images of the scanned body part.\n\nImportance of MRI: MRI plays a crucial role in observing and treating cancers like prostate and rectal cancer, as well as tracking neurological conditions including Alzheimer's, dementia, epilepsy, and stroke.\n\nAdditionally, researchers use MRI scans to study changes in blood flow, aiding in understanding brain activity, known as functional MRI.\n\nAdvantages of MRI:\n\nHigh Precision: MRI machines scan specific body portions with gradient magnets.\n\nSafety: MRI scans pose no long-term harm, and magnetic field effects are well-studied.\n\nEarly Disease Detection: MRI aids early detection of diseases like cancer and multiple sclerosis.\n\nMinimally Invasive Procedure: MRI is safe and comfortable, unlike surgery, benefiting children and the elderly.\n\nDisadvantages of MRI:\n\nCost: MRI machines are expensive to purchase and maintain, leading to high diagnostic costs for patients.\n\nDiscomfort and Claustrophobia: Patients must lie still for extended periods inside the MRI machine, which can be uncomfortable, especially for claustrophobic individuals.\n\nLimited Imaging Capability: MRI struggles to image certain tissues like bone, air, and some types of implants effectively due to their physical properties.\n\nStrong Magnetic Fields: The powerful magnetic fields used in MRI can pose potential risks for patients with certain medical implants (e.g., pacemakers) or metallic objects lodged in their bodies.\n\nUPSC Civil Services Examination, Previous Year Question (PYQ)\n\nQ.
