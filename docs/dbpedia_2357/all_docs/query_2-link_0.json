Since US government-issued bonds are not backed by any underlying assets, a default on these bonds would result in a default.\n\nStatement 2 is correct: U.S. government debt, often referred to as Treasury bonds or Treasuries, is not backed by specific hard assets. Unlike corporate bonds, which may be secured by collateral such as real estate or equipment, U.S. Treasuries rely on the government’s ability to generate revenue through taxation and other means.\n\nHence option a is correct: Both statement I and statement II are correct, and statement II is the correct explanation of statement I.\n\nU.S. treasury bonds:\n\nU.S. Treasury savings bonds are loans from the U.S. Department of the Treasury to individual investors.\n\nThey are low-risk, interest-bearing securities.\n\nInvestors can purchase them directly from the government on TreasuryDirect.\n\nQ.32 Syndicated loan (Economy)\n\n32.

It is not limited to just a fixed amount/lump sum of funds.\n\nTherefore, both statements are correct, but Statement-II does not explain Statement-I.\n\nSyndicated Lending:\n\nA syndicated loan is a type of loan provided by a group of lenders and managed by one or more commercial banks or investment banks known as lead arrangers.\n\nThe syndicated loan market is the primary way for large corporations in the U.S. and Europe to obtain loans from banks and other institutional financial providers.\n\nArrangers play the role of raising investor funding for an issuer in need of capital, with the issuer paying a fee for this service.\n\nThe most profitable loans are typically those to leveraged borrowers with speculative credit ratings, as they pay higher spreads to attract non-bank term loan investors.\n\nIn the U.S., both corporate borrowers and private equity sponsors drive debt issuance, while in Europe, private equity sponsors dominate the market and influence loan syndication practices.\n\nQ.33 Digital rupee (Economy)\n\n33.

Fowler noted in 1926 that the term epithet was becoming associated with abusive connotations.\n\nNayaputta or Nayaputra or Nataputta\n\nStatement 1 is incorrect: This epithet is not associated with Gautama Buddha. It refers to Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism. Mahavira was known as Vardhamana and is often called Nayaputta (son of Naya or Nata clan) because he belonged to the Naya or Nata clan.\n\nShakyamuni\n\nStatement 2 is correct: This is an epithet of Gautama Buddha. \"Shakya\" refers to the Shakya clan to which Buddha belonged, and \"muni\" means sage. Hence, Shakyamuni means \"the sage of the Shakya clan.\"\n\nTathagata\n\nStatement 3 is correct: Tathagata epithet is used to refer to Gautama Buddha. It means \"the perfect one\" or \"the one who has thus gone\" or \"thus come\".\n\nAfter his enlightenment, the Buddha referred to himself as Tathagata.
