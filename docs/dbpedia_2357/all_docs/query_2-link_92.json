Of course, there will be those of you who will ask why we have left out the temple of X or the ca c th hed edra ral of Y. Theere are very many thoous ma u ands of build ild dings wor orth th\n\ncelebrating in a guide to world architecture, but even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written if they were all to have their rightful place. There is, though, a simple logic to this book. We have tried to include, as f as possible, far ibl b buildings ildi th thatt I h have visited. This amounts to nine in ten. Those we have included that I have not seen are there because it would be impolite and improper to exclude them: these are often pivo votal buildings vo in the story of architecture.

We have also included buildings that I could not possibly have visited because they were destroyed long ago; these are designs of such importance to the story of architecture that it would have been wrong to ignore them. As to dates, we have tried our best to give those that correspond to the known completion of a particular buildi ding ng.

It is not that there are no earllier records of architects, but that th hese are few and far between. We do know, though, the name of one of the very early architects: Imhotep. He dessigned pyramids and became a god. T The words modesty and architect have raarely gone together since. We have tried to include as much of the world as possible. Even so, the buiildings of many countries are missingg from this guide. This is, again, for thee obvious reason that the book would have to be as big as a building to squeeeze them all in, but also becausse there are a number of other countrries, or regions, of the world that have p produced a disproportionate amoun nt of the world’s best and most significcant architecture. There is very little ““vernacular” architecture here. I thinkk this is a subject for a separate guide, or a much bigger one. This guide concentrates on buildings that are sellf-conscious works of art. Bu uildings in this book are listed and illlustrated mostly as if they stand proud dly alone. This is so that they can be reaadily identified, described, and underrstood. Many, of course, are in streetss and avenues among crowds and rows oof other buildings. I remember first lo ooking for Gaudí’s Casa Batlló— a draggonlike apartment block in Barceelona.

This, though, made me think more of the building, not less; it has, despite its eccentricities, good urban manners, unlike the PostModern architecture of the 1980s found in Barcelona, as elsewhere. Post-Modernism reminds me that I should mention that there are a few episodes in the history of architecture where I find myself totally out of tune with a particular style. Architecture might be a continuum and its history a book to treasure and borrow from, yet “Po-Mo” design, virulent worldwide in the 1980s, was a case of ripping up the pages of history books and plastering the torn fragments childishly across the steel and concrete frames of otherwise nondescript buildings in the hope of eliciting a laugh from passersby. A few of these buildings have been included in these pages in order to present a continuous record of architectural development, even though I personally do not like them. I hope this book will be just the beginning of an adventure for those setting out to discover the world through its buildings and its architectural history. It is a unending journey and might just be the start of a lifetime’s pleasure.\n\nINTRODUCTIO N\n\n13\n\nWHAT IS ARCHITECTURE?\n\n17\n\nArchitecture began, said the German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, “when two bricks were put together well.” This might sound too easy to be true, yet Mies was right. What he meant was that architecture is the self-conscious act of building: of building not just with common sense, but with artistry. ne day, travelers will be able to return to Iraq and see for themselves the great ziggurat at Ur. This daunting ancient monument is, on one level, no more and no less than an immense pile of sun-baked bricks, piled in stepped layers high into the desert sky. But what fine bricks!—and what a spirited design. The ziggurat at Ur was not just a building. It was not made for shelter or to store grain. It was built as an artwork, as the greatest artefact humans could shape at the time to honor their gods and to invite those divinities down the great brick steps of their monument to their city of Ur. The ziggurat was a giant stairway to Heaven and back down to earth, connecting humankind to the gods and, hopefully, making the earth, and the city of Ur, fruitful. The ziggurat of Ur is also important in our story because it shows us how architecture was always more than a functional\n\nO\n\ntool: it was a form of celebration of human artistry and of the imagination, and a way of formalizing, by shaping in brick (and, later and elsewhere, in stone, marble, concrete, iron, steel, zinc, and titanium), the rituals of urban life. IN THE BEGINNING\n\nPeople first came together to create cities some seven thousand years ago, and possibly even earlier, in the Fertile Crescent—the crescent-shaped region that extends from the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea to the Persian Gulf. The oldest monumental cities we know of, although there will always be other claims and perhaps new discoveries, are in what is southern Iraq today. Here, people settled, and by that simple act they were able to create surpluses of food and to store these over the winter months—thus, they had time to create rituals and festivals. They created gods, too, and\n\nBLUEPRINT FOR THE NORTH WING OF THE US CAPITOL, WASHINGTON, D.C., DESIGNED IN THE EARLY 19TH CENTURY BY BENJAMIN HENRY LATROBE.\n\n18\n\nI NTRODUCI NG ARCHITECTURE\n\nZiggurat at Ur Ancient monuments reaching skyward were built to honor, please, and appease gods who lived, literally, on a higher plane. These buildings were therefore fundamentally necessary and “functional” in a way we may find hard to understand today.\n\nput kings in power to protect them them. And so there was a need for public places, for temples, palaces, and lookout towers. Mud huts would never do for gods, priests, soldiers, and kings—and so two, and then many millions, of bricks were put together on their behalf, and architecture emerged. Civilization, cities, and architecture rose together. Mies van der Rohe (1886–1969), a Modern architect with a passion for— and knowledge of—ancient culture,\n\nalso defined architecture as “the the will of the epoch translated into space.” Anyone looking at a Greek temple, Gothic cathedral, New York skyscraper, or Nazi stadium will know exactly what Mies meant. His was one way of saying that people get the architecture they deserve, or the architecture they will into being, in brick and stone. An architectural interpretation of history is, in fact, as good as any other. By understanding architecture from across the ages and around the world, the\n\nWHAT IS ARCHITECTURE?\n\nstories of different peoples and regimes can be read and, to a greater or lesser degree, understood. We understand not just their culture, as in the arts, but something of their politics and their political economy, too. FORM AND FUNCTION\n\nFrom two bricks put together well to monuments that tracked the stars and aligned humanity with the heavens, architecture had great and even other otherworldly ambitions from the very start. One of its purposes, from the smallest well-put-together building to the highest skyscraper, is to lift the human spirit. In architecture we find a way of celebrating our humanity and of raising ourselves above the concerns of the matter-of-fact, the here and now. Not exclusively, of course. Architecture might be the selfconscious act of building artistically, and hopefully well, but it is also about\n\n19\n\nshelter. One of the marked differences between architecture and the fine arts is that buildings have very particular functions to perform. Few artworks, with the exception of Marcel Duchamp’s Fountain (1917), need lavatories. Or, for that matter, gutters, drainpipes, wiring, gas, electricity, heating, lighting, ventilation, windows, and air-conditioning. On this level, architecture is a machine. LET THERE BE LIGHT\n\nAnother great modern architect, Le Corbusier (1887–1965), defined architecture as “the masterly, correct, and magnificent play of masses brought together in light.” Here is a new dimension: to Mies’s well-puttogether bricks and “will of the Ancient architecture of Mesopotamia From the lonely desert ruins we see today, we attempt to extrapolate and interpret the color, vibrancy, and daily life of ancient societies.\n\n20\n\nI NTRODUCI NG ARCHITECTURE\n\nepoch,” we add the play of light. All great architects have been masters of light. Stand in front of a Greek temple and watch how its moods change and its space is animated by different plays of light as the sun moves around it over the course of a day. Sit quietly in Le Corbusier’s pilgrimage chapel at Ronchamp (see above, right) and feel the light directed so knowingly, and carefully, through slits and chutes, windows and shafts: the ever-changing light not only animates and celebrates the architecture, but sends gentle shivers down the spine of the observer. The moon and the stars played equally important roles in the artistry and planning of ancient temples and of Gothic cathedrals. Imagine the play of moonlight, or of the stars, on the sheer and polished surfaces of the Great Pyramid of Khufu. Their light would have set up a celestial dance in tune with the rhythms of the architecture they played upon. As for their planning, the design of Egyptian pyramids and Gothic cathedrals was aligned with stars and constellations.\n\nmillions of civilians, an increasing number of European architects began to think of how they could express their desire to get away from the old regimes and what they saw as the overly complex, messy, and decadent way of life that had led to the war. Architecture, so they decided, should be as clean, white, and efficient as the very best new sanatorium, as beautifully functional as the white ocean liners that took people on health-giving voyages away from the grime of European cities. This was the birth of the Modernist Movement, a time when many of the brightest architects believed they could create an architecture that was free of the weight of history and as smoothly working as a well-oiled machine. A house, in the famous words of Le Corbusier, might be a machine à habiter —a machine for living in. And, yet, Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe, and the other brave new moderns were never free of history. In fact, these two particular architects rooted their work in ancient history even as they thought as far ahead as RISE OF THE MACHINE they were able. As for architects who Immediately after the senseless really did think they could turn slaughter of World War I, which killed buildings into pure machines for living, more than 8.5 million soldiers and designing gigantic concrete housing\n\nWHAT IS ARCHITECTURE?\n\n21\n\nHarnessing light Compare the play of light inside a traditional cathedral, such as Morelia, Mexico (far left), and the chapel at Ronchamp (left) by Le Corbusier. In the first, the eye is drawn inexorably upward; in the second, it is the human context of the act of worship that is illuminated.\n\n1856), gave us the skylines of New York and Chicago. Now buildings could rise almost impossibly high into the sky, and, certainly, from the invention of the first electric elevators (Werner von Siemens, 1880), it was consummately easy to get to the top of them and back down to the ground. THE MODERN FREE-FOR-ALL\n\nestates, for example, they were to make all too many heartbreaking mistakes with other people’s lives. Architecture matters. Architecture needs a soul. Architecture is a continuum connecting us back through skyscrapers and cathedrals to pedimented temples and ziggurats made of well-put-together bricks. There have been, of course, many new inventions and discoveries that have at various junctures through history allowed and encouraged architecture to move in sudden leaps and bounds. The pointed arch led to the high vaulting of Gothic cathedrals and to a generation of magical buildings that, for all their great scale and mass, seemed like weightless caskets of colored glass. The elevator or lift (Elisha Otis, 1853), combined with the invention of steel (Henry Bessemer, Breaking new ground With the coming of the industrial age, architecture once again reached for the sky, as nations and cities competed to build the tallest structures ever seen. The Empire State Building, New York (right), took the record in 1931.\n\nAt the end of the 20th century, computers and new materials allowed architects to play with forms more than ever before. Computers could tell architects exactly how much an extra curve here, or fashionable projection there, would cost their clients. Computers in the design studio could communicate with their peers in machine shops where building materials could be cut to measure to fit exactly into place on building sites. The computer has proved to be a liberating tool for some architects, one toy too many for others. Architecture is not just about architects. It is also about those who commission them. The story of architecture is the story of, among others, priests, kings, queens, emperors, captains of industry, queens of commerce, housebuilders, enlightened patrons, and wrong-headed and even demonic politicians. This is partly what Mies meant when he defined architecture as “the will\n\n22\n\nI NTRODUCI NG ARCHITECTURE\n\nof the epoch translated into space.” Many of the buildings we have learned to admire, or even adore intuitively, have been the playthings of monstrous tyrants, most of whom have been forgotten. They are lucky, in a way: the great art they commissioned has outgunned their murderous intent. Where once there was savagery and pain, now we see beauty and repose. Equally, many of the finest works of architecture are modest creations. Sir Christopher Wren (1632–1723) might be remembered first and foremost by those looking around St. Paul’s Cathedral, yet—although the dome of this great church is one of the world’s finest—it is the lovely necklace of small parish churches Wren rebuilt around St. Paul’s in the aftermath of the Great Fire of London (1666) that shows him at his sensitive best. Architecture is about proportion, too. Inside his church of St. Stephen Walbrook, Wren created a scaleddown model of the dome he wanted to build for his rejected Greek cross Evolution and revolution Both organic in form and futuristic in aspect aspect, the Guggenheim Museum in New York (below) redefined space and the way we use it.\n\nRelic of history The Lutine bell sits in the cathedral-like atrium in the Lloyds of London building (right), cradled (or, it could be said, dwarfed) by this modern temple of commerce.\n\ndesign for St. Paul’s; to find this miniature magnificence behind the door of what appears to be, from the street, a tiny ragstone parish church is not just a delight, but one of the reasons why anyone might learn to love architecture. BACK TO THE FUTURE\n\nThe story of architecture is one of remarkable human endeavor, one of the means through which we try to create order and make sense of our endlessly intriguing, yet messy world. We all live and work in buildings. From the humblest to the most sublime, there is no reason why any of these should be less than inspiring even in small ways: the turn of a stair; the way sunlight falls through windows in mesmerizing patterns on floors; materials cool to the touch in the heat of summer; the rhythm of an arcade; the pregnant quality of a dome. At its best, architecture should lift our spirits, while serving as guide to our ambitions, vanities, our needs, our gods, and our dreams.\n\nTHE BUILDING BLOCKS OF ARCHITECTUR E\n\n25\n\nThe beginning of brickmaking and the birth of architecture belong together. The first great works of architecture we know of—the first attempts at building beyond necessity, of building to express desires, beliefs, goals, and cultures—were made of brick. In fact, the very first structures of any kind that we have evidence of today were brick-built. n 2002, I was privileged to be able to travel the length and breadth of Iraq. This was at the tail end of the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein—a brutal ruler who saw himself as a successor to the very kings of ancient Mesopotamia who raised those first monuments in brick and, in so doing, created architecture and cities. The development of walled villages and fortified towns was taking place elsewhere in the world at much the same time—Jericho is one of the world’s earliest settlements with any pretensions to architecture—yet in what was once Mesopotamia, we can be sure that architecture existed, because we can see it with our eyes, touch it with our hands. And what we touch is brick—enduring, sun-baked brick.\n\nI\n\nON THE TRAIL OF THE FIRST CITY\n\nI spent several hours one extremely hot morning on my trip to Iraq in the office of the Governor of Nasiriyah.\n\nWhat I wanted was permission to travel to Eridu, which might well be the world’s first city. The Governor’s press attaché suggested that I might instead like to see the great ziggurat of Ur just a few miles away. Of course, I was tempted. This is one of the greatest examples of ancient architecture, even though heavily restored by Saddam. But still, Eridu it had to be. The very thought of it was haunting. Could this really be the world’s first city? Since 1991, it had been cut off from the rest of Iraq, the rest of the world, because it was at the heart of local military operations. The shell-holed tracks leading to it were strewn with Gulf War detritus: unexploded bombs, rockets, hundreds of tons of depleted uranium US munitions left lying in the desert. Nevertheless, I wanted to go there. With an armed escort, I finally got to Eridu. The temperature was exactly 122°F (50°C). All around us was\n\nGLASS-AND-STEEL ROOF OF THE QUEEN ELIZABETH II GREAT COURT AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM, LONDON, 2000, DESIGNED BY FOSTER AND PARTNERS.\n\n26\n\nI NTRODUCI NG ARCHITECTURE\n\nshimmering sand. Here, though, I was able to brush away some of the burning sand and touch the bricks of what was once the ziggurat of Eridu, even though it now looks like a mound of earth and sand. Between these topmost bricks and the base of the ziggurat were at least 16 different layers of temple, the first dating back to around 5,000BCE. This is where architecture was born, when this land was rich in date palms and fresh water, when human settlement was a new venture. At the heart of this ziggurat, its structural core, were bricks, carefully put together. The history of Eridu was only pieced together by Iraqi archaeologists and experts p from the British Museum between 1946 and 1949. There may wellll b we be othe therr an anci cien entt ci citi ties es aand nd\n\ntemples to be discovered elsewhere, but this is as good a beginning for civilization as any. There were other building materials at the time elsewhere in the world that might have shaped architecture, but not here between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, where the only possible way to build on a large scale was with brick. Happily, this building block of the earliest architecture was not just immediately available, but it was strong and enduring. Where timber rots, steel corrodes, and concrete cracks, brick seems to endure as if forever. It is also a warm material, and because it was shaped and laid by human hands, it helped raise buildings that were essentiallyy human,, too. Brick has never really gone out of date or fashion, and it ha hass be been en u use sed d M d-br Mud -brick b ick ck ci city ty, y, Sh Shib ib m, Yem iba Yemen n Th s aasto Thi stonis sto n hin nis hingg 16th 6th-c -centu c ntuury ryy cit cityy of mudd-b -bri brrickk bl block o ks— ock s—tthe “M “Ma M nha hatta ttan of tt the desert”— t”—is is still sti till inh inhabi a ted ted ttooday day ayy.\n\nTHE BUILDING BLOCKS OF ARCHITECTUR E\n\n27 Unchanging scene In many parts of the world, mud bricks are still very much in use: here in modern-day Tunisia, a brickmaker shapes them from clay and water and lays them out to dry. Afterward they will be baked in the kilns in the background.\n\nto shape some of the most beautiful buildings in the world. And some of the most influential and radical, too: even Le Corbusier, the great proponent of concrete architecture in the 1920s, turned to brick again in the 1950s. Brick has moved with the times and, from the 19th century, was made increasingly through industrial processes. Today, it is used by architects mostly for cladding new buildings, not as a structural material. Yet there are few greater pleasures, if you love buildings, than coming across one crafted in warm, handmade brick. The first building block of architecture mayy yet be the last. BUILDING WITH TIMBER\n\nElsewhere in thee world, where there were woods and d forests, timber was a key buildin ng material. Timber is strongg, warm, and beautiful, but ulttimately it rots or dries out and cracks. Or catches fire. It iss hard to find a timber buildin ng, an original timber building, much over 750 or, at the most, 1,000 years old. One can arguee that, on the whoole, there is no reasoon for most buildings too last so long. Or, equally, one can fall into the Japanese way\n\nof thinking and reason that a building ought to be ritually reconstructed every so many years, so that it is always perfect and not allowed to show signs of decay. Throughout this book you will find timber buildings of extraordinary daring and refinement and examples of timber construction that are quite breathtaking. I still look up at the great lantern of Ely Cathedral in Cambridgeshire with awe. Supported by the sawn trunks of eight mighty oak trees, each weighing 10 tons, the timber lantern itself weighs 200 tons and yet seems to be floating effortlessly above the crossing of the medieval cathedrall.

The Egyptians tended to use stone in great blocks that could be brought to building sites on rollers. The Greeks shaped their stones more subtly but still treated them as a stiffly noble material lacking in flexibility. Greek temples are the apotheosis of trabeated—or post-andlintel—construction, whereby posts (or, in the case of Greek temples, columns) are set into the ground and then set over with beams (in their case entablatures). The Greeks made a great art of this simple form of construction, which, it has been argued g byy theorists and historians from the 18th century, was developed from timber buildings. Perhaps it was.

Although the arch was known to the Greeks, it was the Romans who made it their trademark. Without the arch, there would be no Colosseum, no bridges across high rivers, no aqueducts. By extension, an arch could become a barrel vault to cover a room. Where two barrel vaults intersected they formed a groin vault, as seen in many Roman basilicas. If an arch is stretched and rotated, it becomes the base of a dome. But it was the European p Gothic masters who made stone one of the most exciting of all building materials.

It is said that, in a popular move, Pericles used not slaves but unemployed Athenians as workers, thus ensuring all Athenian families had food on their tables.

Ambition did, however, prove the limitation of stone technology. In 1284, the vaulting of the choir of Beauvais cathedral, in France, collapsed. The aim of its founder, Bishop Guillaume de Grez, had been to build the tallest cathedral in Europe. To do so required the vault to be raised by 16 ft (5 m).\n\nGothic stonework Even after its rebuilding with sturdier supports, the vaulting of Beauvais cathedral still powerfully communicates the soaring ambition of its creators.\n\nThis was six feet too far, and the vault caved in. In 1573, the even more ambitious central tower of the cathedral, still under construction, collapsed. Only the choir and transepts of this stratospherically ambitious building were finally completed. They tell a tale of hubris, and yet the skyhigh vaults of the choir are, it has to be said, breathtaking. Would the ancient\n\nGreeks have thought such construction possible? Probably not, although it should be said that they were content with what they wanted to achieve. They let their mountainous landscape climb toward Heaven, while on the flat plains of Europe, ambitious clerics built holy mountains in sensational leaps and bounds of adventurous stone. ADDING CONCRETE TO THE MIX\n\nRoman builders had another trick up their togas: concrete. By mixing lime and clay, or pozzolana (a volcanic dust), with water they produced a cement that when mixed with aggregate— stones, pebbles, sand, gravel, rubble— formed concrete, a strong, plastic, easily worked, fireproof material that could be used to span previously inconceivable spaces, such as that over the voluminous drum of the Pantheon in Rome. The cores of very many other Roman engineering structures and buildings were also concrete; but, by and large, this truly empire-building material vanished with the Romans. Modern concrete was invented by John Smeaton in England in ca. 1756, although it was to be some while before concrete was seen as a thing of beauty. Only in the 20th century was it truly admired. Even then, architects did their best to make concrete as smooth as possible, so that, especially when polished, it resembled stone. Raw concrete was made fashionable by Le Corbusier in the 1950s and today remains the choice core material of many of the world’s buildings, whether artistic or not. In the meantime, reinforced concrete had been invented by a French gardener, Joseph Monier, in the mid-19th century. His first experiments had been with flower pots, but once he showed his revolutionary material—concrete\n\nC cre Con crete te con te co ce cealed cea led Thee do dome m off the Panth me theon th eo , Rome eon me, iiss buil me b ililtt ooff c crete, con e altho h ugh itt is clad in wha whatt were were considered more decorative materials.\n\nmade many times stronger with the addition of reinforcing bars—at the Paris Exposition of 1867, engineers, then contractors, and finally architects began to beat a path to his door. Architects, especially in the 19th century when there was so much technological change going on around them, often found it hard to accept or to adapt to new materials. Equally, they often refused to see how a new material might be beautiful. They fought an increasingly rear guard action against new materials but finally gave into them and, in the case of concrete, did so with a vengeance. THE STEEL REVOLUTION\n\nIn modern construction, there is one major rival to concrete: steel. In fact, far more steel is used in building\n\nHarsh reality The J. Edgar Hoover Building, Washington, D.C. —headquarters of the FBI—takes a tough line with its Brutalist boxiness and raw concrete.\n\nconstruction today than concrete. Steel took over from iron, which, although it had been forged since 1600BCE, was essentially a soft material. By the 19th century, it was still much used in architectural decoration and for smallspan structures, but it would never have been strong enough to allow the construction of skyscrapers. This, of course, is exactly what steel allowed.\n\n32\n\nI NTRODUCI NG ARCHITECTURE\n\nWHATT IS WHA IS S STEE TEEL? L? Steel took over from iron in 1856, when the Englishman Henry Bessemer (1813–98) first proved that pig iron could be decarbonized, via his “Bessemer converter,” to produce an immensely strong alloy that would revolutionize architecture. The lightness of steel and concrete compared to masonry allowed towering structures to be built.\n\nWright published sensational sketches of a 1 mile (1,600 m) high, 528-story office tower he would have liked to have built. His tower, The Illinois, never happened because of the costs involved and because no one (then or now) could quite see how to get around the problem of providing sufficient elevators traveling at a comfortable speed. What was not questioned was the ability of engineers and contractors to build so high. INTO THE FUTURE\n\nWithin a few decades of its invention, the New York skyline had become a wonder of the modern world. Today, of the approximately one billion tons of steel manufactured worldwide, 60 percent is recycled. For this reason alone, steel is, beyond the manufacturing process, an environmentally sound material. It loses nothing in terms of strength or reliability through recycling. It allows for buildings that climb into the sky seemingly forever. No one is quite sure how tall a steel-framed building could be, although in 1956 Frank Lloyd\n\nToday, there are many new materials available for architects to toy with, from plastic reinforced with glass to neoprene (a synthetic rubber), artificial stone, glass-reinforced concrete, titanium, and even “sea-cretion”— the curious coral-like invention of the German architect Wolf Hilbertz. Yet many of these materials are used only decoratively, for cladding, or for modest structures. The “living houses” that adapt their structures to human emotions as described so thrillingly and darkly in a short story in J. G. Ballard’s Vermilion Sands (1971) have yet to come.

Throughout the world and across history, shelters of one sort or another have been built from hides, bones, wooden poles, bamboo, leaves, bark, fur, branches, reeds, ice, vegetable fibers, rocks, and mud. Occasionally these have been used to create architecture, as in the extraordinary mud mosques of Mali. For the most part, though, these are the materials of temporary structures: igloos and tepees, yurts, and clay-and-wattle huts. These are beautiful structures, but gone, in terms of the stretch of architectural history, with the wind, while the ziggurats of Mesopotamia carry on from ancient history to\n\n33\n\nA new Ede d n de The domes of Britain’s Eden Project are clad in transparent foil “pillows,” fixed to a framework that is designed to allow the substitution of even newer “breathable” materials as they become available.\n\ninfinity The natural world, infinity. world h however, owever may well have provided humans with ideas for both materials and structures that would evolve into complex and thrilling architectural forms.

Perhaps. Yet what seems remarkable after so many centuries is that the basic building blocks have changed so little. As toddlers, our first act of building is to set one brick on another. When we learn to do it well, we are on the way to architecture.\n\n34\n\nINTRODUCI NG ARCHITECTURE\n\nFROM CONCEPTS TO COMPLETION Dramatic new buildings such as the 590 ft (180 m) high 30 St. Mary Axe office building in the City of London, designed by Foster and Partners, are a test of the strength of the relationship between architect, contractor, and client. A key first step in the creation of any major new building is the decision as to whether 30 ST. MARY AXE its construction is necessary or justified. Popularly known as the Gherkin (Pickle) due to its unusual shape, 30 St. Mary Axe— the headquarters of the insurance firm Swiss Re—came about through particularly dramatic circumstances. The Edwardian building it replaced, the Baltic Exchange, was severely damaged by an IRA bomb blast in\n\n1992. The decision was made for it to be demolished, and to replace it with an entirely new building. Once the decision to build has been made, the role of the architect is to fathom the needs of the new building’s clients, and then consider how these needs can be met within the constraints of local planning guidelines and laws, while also satisfying the wider cultural concerns of bodies charged by the government with protecting, and even enhancing, local and national heritage.\n\nSTUDY MODELS Study models of particular sections of the design of a building help the architect to consider how light and shadow will fall during the course of the day. They can also be used to demonstrate the flow of air through the building, and to get a feel of what it might be like to work or live in specific areas.\n\n21 el lev\n\nlev\n\nel\n\n1\n\nModel of rotations This model of 30 St. Mary Axe shows how each floor plan rotates 5 degrees from the floor below, creating spiraling lightwells and “sky gardens.”\n\nSectional drawings A cross-section of a proposed building enables the architects to peel away the skins of their designs and reveal the interior layout and workings.

The design of a building may move through many stages, with the architects making sketches, computer drawings, and 3-D models of the proposed building, working closely with structural engineers and, gradually, as the form and detailed design of the project become clear, with a wide range of specialist engineers concerned with heating, ventilation, elevators, and lighting. Before construction of a building can begin, drawings a and models must be approved by planners in many stages. Once all parties are satisfied and in agreement, the final working drawings are signed off, and the contractors begin their work. Few changes are made to the design at this stage, and certainly not to the essential structure of the building.

It is a place where people live and work cooperatively, producing food to sustain not only themselves, but “specialists”—artisans, artists, architects, scribes, administrators, and priests—who shape a unique culture. The story of architecture therefore begins with the first cities. HE CITY IS ALMOST\n\nThere are many theories about how and when civilization—and architecture with it—began. All need to be prefaced with the word “perhaps” because we are unlikely to ever be sure why people first settled and began to build on a heroic scale, with artistry beyond craft. However, r most archaeologists agree that urban life evolved in the Middle East long before the first cities of Central America and China, and that the location of this giant leap forward was Mesopotamia—an area roughly equivalent to modern Iraq. Mesopotamia—the land bounded by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers (the name means “between the rivers” in\n\nCuneiform script The Sumerians developed the first writing in the 4th millenium BCE. Marks in clay tablets were made using wedge-shaped (cuneiform) ends of cut reeds.\n\nGreek)—was essentially a dry land; its position between the two mighty rivers, however, allowed for easy irrigation of the desert, where reliable native grasses—barley and wheat— could be grown as crops. Fish and wildfowl were also plentiful, allowing settlers to build up the surpluses of food on which the beginnings of urban civilization depended. BUILDING COMMUNITIES\n\nUrban settlement was driven on by agricultural success and technological development. From around 3500BCE, bronze-age technology spread through the Middle East, replacing stone tools with metal. The ox-drawn plow appeared in Mesopotamia around 3000BCE, providing the first motive force beyond human muscle. Ancient Mesopotamia hosted a procession of great civilizations: the Sumerians (3300–1900BCE) were succeeded by the Akkadians, then the Babylonians, Assyrians, and Persians. The first Sumerian cities differed from earlier village settlements because their surrounding lands were thought to be “owned” by a local god (rather than by families of clans).\n\nK E Y D AT E S ca. 5300 BCE Possible construction of first temple at Eridu; beginnings of cities and architecture in Mesopotamia\n\nca. 3300 BCE Invention of writing, with cuneiform script on clay tablets developed at Uruk\n\n5000 B C E ca. 3500 BCE Sumerians invent the wheel, revolutionizing the means and speed of exchanging goods and ideas\n\nca. 2700 BCE Egyptians begin writing on papyrus scrolls, which can be stored in libraries\n\n3000 B C E ca. 3150 BCE Rise of Egyptian civilization along banks of the Nile River\n\nca. 1755 BCE First known legal system codified by Babylonian king, Hammurabi\n\n2000 B C E ca. 2650 BCE Imhotep, high priest of Ptah at Memphis, erects a pyramid made of stone at Sakkara\n\n1492 BCE Tuthmosis I is the first pharaoh buried in a tomb cut into the rock in Egypt’s Valley of the Kings\n\n41\n\nFROM VILLAGE TO CIT Y\n\nTHE CITY AS TEMPLE\n\nLookingg to the t e skiess The br brill illllian antt lig light and ev ever-chan hanngin gingg posi posi ositio tions ti off su sun, moon, star tars, s, and nd plane pllanets ts overhe rhead h ad in thee first st ci citie ties encoura tie ura rage ged tthhos osee wh whoo foun foun ounded dedd ded them th m to desi e gn esi gn th their the ir mon monume ume ment me nta t l buil tal uildi uildin dings din g in gs tun u e wit ith th tthhe geo geo eom ometr etr tryy of tr of the thee hea heaven venns. s.\n\nMesopotamian people – from Babylonians to Persians – saw their cities as sacred places. Babylon, the greatest of all Mesopotamian cities, was known as Babi-ilani, or “the Gate of the Gods” – the place where the gods were thought to have descended to earth. In its time, Babylon was also an important center for trade, linking the Persian Gulf with the Mediterranean.

A temple dedicated to the local god was typically the center of the settlement, surrounded by public buildings and marketplaces, and built up on a stepped pyramid, or ziggurat—a kind of cosmic mountain. The priests were at the hub of society because, on behalf of the gods, they controlled much of a city’s lands and irrigation systems, as well as distributing the allimportant agricultural surplus. The Sumerians created the very notion of the state, of law and kingship, while inventing the calendar, the wheel, abstract mathematics, timekeeping\n\n(with the 60-minute hour), literature (exemplified by the Epic of Gilgamesh, see opposite), e and the zodiac. MOVING IDEAS\n\nWere the early Mesopotamian city states, complete with their sacred temple mountains, the blueprint for later cities beyond the Middle East— from Egypt to China, India, and the Americas? Certainly, the stepped pyramid form appears in Egypt soon after its development in Sumeria, and Gods of ancient Egypt The Egyptians had as many as 2,000 gods, often represented as part human, part animal. This mural, picturing the gods Anubis and Horus, was discovered on tomb walls in the Valley of the Kings.\n\nFROM VILLAGE TO CIT Y\n\nFertile floods As in Mesopotamia, Egyptian civilization depended on water. Regular flooding of the Nile made the strips of land on either side of the river extremely fertile.\n\nit is likely that Sumerian masons and craftsmen did travel to Egypt. But although Egypt produced its own great cities, they never assumed the independent identity and dynamism of those in Mesopotamia—partly because the activity in Egyptian cities focused more on serving the royal court than on building civic identity. Accordingly, the most famous monumental architecture of Egypt is dedicated to dead pharaohs, rather than living communities. The Bronze Age (which lasted until around 1200BCE in the Middle East) was a time when people traveled freely over surprisingly large distances, spreading trade, myths, and ideas. Some commentators suggest that links between the Old and New Worlds were well established during this time, explaining the appearance of the stepped pyramid form in Central America. These notions are highly controversial, but what is certain is that something profound occurred around 3000BCE, changing peoples who subsisted by hunting and gathering, and lived in makeshift homes, into\n\n43\n\nbuilders of great cities girdled with walls and adorned with temples and palaces. Some claim that this change gives credence to the destruction-andrenewal myth of the Great Flood enshrined in so many cultures; for others it simply marks a shift—no less remarkable—in human consciousness. SUMERI SUM ERIAN ERI AN LIT LITERA ERATUR ERA TUREE TUR The world’s first known work of literature— the Epic of Gilgamesh—began h life in southern Sumeria between 2700 and 2500 BCE. Gilgamesh was a real Sumerian ruler who reigned around 2700BCE, and the epic drew together poems and legends surrounding his reign into a complete, mythologized story, inscribed in cuneiform, on 12 clay tablets. It includes an account of a cataclysmic flood, similar in detail to that in the Bible, promoting great interest from scholars. Epic of Gilgamesh Elements of the epic have been woven into later biblical and classical literature; this illustration is from Zabelle C. Boyajian’s 1924 book Gilgamesh.\n\nANCIENT MIDDLE EAS T\n\n45\n\nc a . 5 3 0 0 – 3 5 0 BCE BCE Gods and kings: the architecture of the ancient Middle East is the story, as far as we can see, of these two forces—one divine, one wouldbe divine. This is largely because the everyday buildings of this period, in which people lived and worked, have long since vanished. What we are left with are the ruins, in various states of decay, of ambitious palaces and temples—the architecture of religion and power. he surviving monuments of ancient Iraq, from ca. 3000BCE, are all built of brick. Stone was largely unavailable, as were the lengths of unyielding timber necessary to span large spaces. The most impressive of the early works of architecture in the ancient Middle East is the Ziggurat of Ur (see p.47); but the one we would all like to see, if only we could, is the “Tower of Babel”—the great ziggurat at Babylon. The base of this temple, measuring 295 ft (90 m) square, does indeed suggest a daringly ambitious structure. Faced with blue-glazed bricks and rising in seven stages, it would have towered over King Nebuchadnezzar’s legendary palace beside the Euphrates, famous for the Hanging Gardens that cascaded in great perfumed terraces from the top of the building. It is vital to remember that what today are ruins in a war-torn desert were once the raiments of powerful civilizations.\n\nT\n\nA NEW ARCHITECTURAL PROCESS\n\nEventually, the region was swallowed up by the world’s first great empire, founded by Persia’s Cyrus the Great (ca. 600–530BCE). From this time on, building styles were not only transferred from one city, or kingdom, to another, but they also began to be mingled to produce fusions of styles that pushed architecture down new pathways and into creative risk-taking. Craftsmen from across the Persian empire—Assyria, Babylon, Egypt, and Ionia—joined forces to shape a new architecture that was far more fluid and sensual than that of the Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians, and Assyrians before them. Lavishly a decorated and brightly colored, the Palace of Persepolis (see p.51), founded in 518BCE, shows just how far architecture had moved from the elementary ziggurats that had introduced humanity to architecture some 2,500 years earlier.\n\nSTAIRCASE TO THE PALACE OF DARIUS I AT PERSEPOLIS, WITH RELIEF SHOWING A LION AND A BULL IN COMBAT, AND SERVANTS CLIMBING STEPS TO SERVE AT THE KING’S TABLE.\n\n46\n\nFROM VILLAGE TO CIT Y\n\nELEMENTS The basic building materials of ancient Middle Eastern architecture were brick and stone. Increasingly, surfaces were adorned, and then covered, in tiles and relief sculpture. Much of this symbolic sculpture was brightly colored and supported by inscriptions. The Palace of Persepolis, begun by Darius I in 518BCE, is the most impressive example of this era. Monumental script Babylonian buildings can be read like books. The palace at Nimrud, for example, features reliefs of kings and courtiers superimposed with detailed and lengthy inscriptions listing their achievements.

This imposing structure commanded what was then a great walled city. The Ziggurat stands alone and apart from the extensive remains of the excavated streets and tombs of the city of Ur. Originally it was walled around, at the heart a religious complex, and reached through a grand courtyard. This artificial sacred mountain was once topped by a temple dedicated to the Moon god Nanna, gained by daunting flights of stairs that still survive. When the Ziggurat was remodeled and expanded by Urnammu (see below) and his successors in the 21st century BCE, it was already an extremely old building. It is constructed from mud bricks, the ubiquitous building material of ancient Mesopotamia; each layer is bonded with bitumen, and some with matting to improve stability. The outer layer of bricks is baked for sharpness of profile and durability. Urnammu’s monument has survived over the centuries, not least because of the ingenuity of its construction: “weeper holes” in the va vast st mas mass of brickwork allow the Mighty Mig ghty co const nstruc nst ructio uctio tionn Only the base remains today, but this mounttainous i buildi bui ding ng onc o e had three tiers, and and some suggest that eaa h level w eac was as pla plante n d with trees tr es.\n\nCEREMONIAL STAIRWAY\n\nevaporation of water from the mud core, while drainage channels built into the structure carry away rainwater.

URNAMMU The powerful third dynasty of Ur was founded by Urnammu, an ancient Sumerian king who reigned between ca. 2113BCE and ca. 2096BCE and who built and restored many public buildings in Ur, including the great Ziggurat. In a bid for immortality, it must be said that Urnammu has done rather well— each of the many individual bricks used to build this amazing structure, the best preserved of all Mesopotamian ziggurats, is stamped with his name.\n\n48\n\nFROM VILLAGE TO CIT Y\n\nPALACE OF SARGON A 706BCE B KHORSABAD, NORTHERN IRAQ C SARGON II D PALACE\n\nThe palaces of the Assyrian Empire are some of the largest and most imposing ancient buildings in Mesopotamia, demonstrating the affluence, aspirations, and determination of the fierce military regime that shaped them. Though dramatic, the empire was short-lived, and its kings were\n\nclearly in a hurry to build on a heroic scale; the Palace of Sargon in the city of Khorsabad was almost shoddily built in parts, making use of soft bricks laid on top of one another without mortar. And yet, the overall effect of the architecture would have been overwhelming. Raised on a stone platform at a height level with the top of the city walls, the palace covered almost 23 acres (9 ha). At its heart was a throne room measuring 162 x 35 ft (49 x 10.7 m), crowned with a flat, decorated timber ceiling —luxury in a land where wood was scarce.

Set along the Euphrates River, its walls enclosed a densely packed mix of temples, shrines, markets, and houses, divided by grand avenues set at right angles to one another. The city’s legendary Tower of Babel was a seven-tiered ziggurat rising from a base 297 ft (90 m) square. The Hanging Gardens—one of the seven wonders of the ancient world—were built for Nebuchadnezzar’s wife, Amytis.\n\nNimrud is the site of the biblical city of Calah. For its day it was an enormous settlement: its walls extended 4.7 miles (7.5 km), and its peak population is said to have been 100,000. The city was founded by the Assyrian king Shalmaneser I in the 13th century BCE and was enlarged around 880BCE during the reign of Ashurnasirpal II. Nimrud continued to be a major center until it fell to the invading Babylonians and Medes between 614 and 612BCE. Typically, this Assyrian city boasted a palace set in generous courtyards, complete with a ziggurat and stone relief carvings depicting bloody battles and lion hunting. It was also home to the fascinating Temple of Ezida, built in the 9th century BCE; here was the sanctuary of Nabu, the god of writing. A well in front of Nabu’s sanctuary provided the water that, when mixed with fine clay, produced the writing tablets that were such an important part of life for all Mesopotamian cultures.\n\nNINEVEH\n\nTEMPLE OF SOLOMON\n\nA ca. 700BCE B MOSUL, NORTHERN IRAQ C SENNACHERIB D CITY\n\nA ca. 1000BCE B JERUSALEM, ISRAEL C SOLOMON D PLACE OF WORSHIP\n\nThe city of Nineveh, on the eastern bank of the Tigris River, was the final and greatest capital of the Assyrian Empire. It was founded by Nimrod and laid out by Sennacherib, son of Sargon II, but like many ancient cities, its heyday was brief: it was overrun and humbled by the Medes and the Babylonians in 612BCE. Containing several palaces and girdled with 7.5 miles (12 km) of walls, it would have been an imposing sight. Impressive stretches of wall survive to this day, some rebuilt by Saddam Hussein. There are also remains of King Sennacherib’s “Palace without a rival”—still decorated with aggressive carved stone reliefs. Many of the best reliefs—including those from King Ashurbanipal’s palace—are now in the British Museum, London. They depict vivid scenes of royal lion hunting and gruesome executions of enemies in the bloody campaigns fought by the Assyrians against the Elamites: Nineveh, like all Assyrian cities, was primarily a machine for making war.\n\n49\n\nAccording to the Old Testament, the temple was built by David’s son, Solomon, to house the Ark of the Covenant—the container of the Ten Commandments. Nothing of the original temple has survived: it was most likely destroyed by the Babylonians in the 6th century BCE. Descriptions in the Bible and archaeological digs suggest a building with an inner sanctum fronted by a courtyard, with both structures surrounded by open courtyards, as seen in the model below.\n\n50\n\nFROM VILLAGE TO CIT Y\n\nCITA CI TADE DELL OF VAN A ca. 800BCE B VAN, EASTERN TURKEY C SARDURI I D FORTRESS\n\nThe remains of the Citadel of Van rise from a rocky outcrop more than 260 ft (80 m) high, offering panoramic views of the surrounding countryside. From around 3,000 years ago, Van was the capital of the kingdom of Urartu, a civilization of which we know little, except that it was an enemy of the Assyrians (as was every other civilization within reach of their chariots). The base of the citadel was constructed from massive stone blocks, many of which are still firmly in place; the superstructure would have been made of mud bricks, while roofs were either thatched or of timber. The one surviving architectural feature is a powerful stone-built barbican, or fortified gateway, that once protected the entrance to the citadel and its water supply. The internal layout of the citadel was probably along the lines of a densely inhabited castle. There are no remains of a temple, though rock tombs, with niches for lamps, have been found in the walls of the south side of the citadel.\n\nTOMB OF DARIUS I A 485BCE B NAQSH-I-RUSTAM, SOUTHERN IRAN C DARIUS I D TOMB\n\nCarved into a solid cliff face, the tomb of Darius I (see above, right) is inscribed with the achievements, reflections, and beliefs of the great Persian ruler. The finely executed facade of the tomb is 60 ft (18.3 m) wide; high above the ground and facing the rising sun, the entrance is flanked by four columns supporting an Egyptian-style cornice. The capitals are of the double-bull type—carved bull heads facing away from one another— characteristic of Persian buildings of this period. The design of the facade seems to be adapted from the south front of Darius’s palace at Persepolis nearby.\n\nPALACE OF CTESIPHON ca. 350 350 B CTES CTESIPHO IPHON, N CENTR CENTRAL AL IRAQ IRAQ C CHOS CHOSROES ROES I D PALA PALACE CE A ca\n\nThe Palace of Ctesiphon is one of the late-flowering wonders of Mesopotamian culture. Although built by the Persian kings of the Sassanid dynasty, it is in many ways a summary of the vigor and grand architectural ambitions of the many civilizations of this region. Its most obvious feature—a vast, single-span brick barrel\n\nvault—is part of what must have been a truly magnificent open-fronted banqueting hall. This arch (technically a pointed ovoid, a shape typical of Mesopotamia) is an astonishing 121 ft (36.7 m) high and spans 83 ft (25.3 m), rivaling anything built by the Romans. The influence of Rome is very mu uch in evidence throughout the design oof the palace: massive walls flanking the centtral banqueting hall were animated with Rooman-style arcading set between pairs off attacched columns. The actual building type,, however, is very un-Roman: the sttupendous banqueting hall was open-ended, forming, in effect, a hugely stylized tent. The east wall of the palace remains; the west and rear walls have collapsed, and, tragically, engineers now fear for the integrity of the arch itself.

Its architecture and decoration reflect the design and craftsmanship of the many civilizations and cultures brought—mostly by force—into the orbit of the Persian Empire, and even its remaining ruins retain real visual power. Most ancient buildings represent the culture of one specific civilization; at Persepolis, we begin to see how architectural styles could be fused across civilizations, producing hybrid designs. The palace complex stands on a stone platform measuring 1,518 x 907 ft (460 x 275 m), raised 50 ft (15 m) above ground. Its courtyards and halls, built over decades, were reached by a magnificent stairway that can still be seen today; kings would have ascended the stairway on horseback. The highpoint of the complex was its Hall of a Hundred Columns—an imposing throne room with brick walls 11 ft (3.4 m) thick and 100 double-bull columns supporting an expansive cedar ceiling. Walls of the principal buildings were lined with stone, those of lesser structures with baked and glazed mud brick. The palace complex was decorated throughout The fall of Persepolis The splendor of Persepolis lasted until 330BCE, when it was looted by Alexander the Great. The site was rediscovered in the 17th century.\n\nwith stone reliefs and wall paintings of nobles, courtiers, tribute-bearers, foreign dignitaries, soldiers, and others, creating a vivid and lasting picture of life at the court of one of the ancient world’s most powerful dynasties. When visiting the bleached ruins of Persepolis today, it is easy to forget that the original decorations were incredibly brightly colored—probably lurid to modern observers—and that the palace would have dazzled the eyes of awed ancient visitors. THE KING OF KINGS—DARIUS I\n\nDARIUS I By the time of his death in 486BCE, Darius I had extended the Persian Empire as far as India and Thrace. He built Persepolis as the showcase of his great empire, dedicating it to Ahuramazda, the supreme god of the Persians. Work on the complex’s giant platform began around 518BCE, but the task was not completed until many years later by Artaxerxes I.\n\nANCIENT EGYPT\n\n53\n\nc a . 3 0 0 0 BC BCEE – 3 0 0 CE CE The civilization of the ancient Egyptians will never cease to fascinate us. The complexity of its myths, its highly involved burial rituals, its mummified cats and pet snakes, and the sheer tenacity of a culture that lasted essentially unchanged over thousands of years are utterly compelling. So, too, is its haunting, powerful architecture: the geometric brilliance of the pyramids, and the eeriness of the temples and tombs. ysterious, consistent, and, once established, a law unto itself, the architecture of ancient Egypt developed slowly over a period of some 3,000 years, at a time when the country was mostly free of invaders, wealthy, and well organized. The country’s fortune and culture were based around the seasonal cycle and flow of the Nile River. Each year, as the waters of the river rose and the valley bloomed, agriculture became the main focus of activity, producing the food that would have to last through the next dry season. There was little farmers and their laborers could do when the river fell, however, and so ancient Egypt was blessed for five months of the year with a surplus of skilled and unskilled workers who could be set to work on monumental architectural projects. And so the pyramids arose, designed to house the mummified bodies of pharaohs and\n\nM\n\ntheir treasures. The first, the Step Pyramid of Zoser at Sakkara (see p.55), was designed by Imhotep—also the first architect whom we know by name. ENDURING LEGACY\n\nAlthough it eventually ossified, Egyptian culture has continued to fascinate visitors and explorers over the centuries. The ancient Romans were entranced by it. And in 1922, when the English archaeologist Howard Carter discovered the underground tomb of the young king Tutankhamun—an 18th-Dynasty pharaoh (1334–1323BCE) of only moderate significance in Egyptian history—he triggered a craze for all things Egyptian that has yet to die down. It encouraged the Art-Deco movement in the late 1920s and early 1930s, nurtured countless books and films, and enticed millions of tourists down the Nile from Cairo to Luxor.\n\nTHE OLDEST OF THE ANCIENT WONDERS OF THE WORLD, THE GREAT PYRAMID OF KHUFU AT GIZA, EGYPT, IS THE ONLY WONDER THAT SURVIVES TODAY.\n\n54\n\nFROM V ILLAGE TO CITY\n\nELEMENTS Egyptian architecture is characterized by massive stone elements—huge sloping walls, mountainous pyramids, colossal statuary, and imposing colonnades.

Its revolutionary design was the work of the first architect we know by name, Imhotep. Originally simply another “mastaba,” or single-story stone funerary monument, the stepped form of the 197 ft (60 m) high limestone pyramid developed over many years. To create this magnificent stepped pyramid, six traditional, single-story monuments, each smaller than the one below it, are effectively piled on top of one another. The base of the resulting great pyramid measures 410 x 358 ft (125 x 109 m). The pyramid was only one part of a vast religious complex set within a limestonewalled enclosure measuring 1,795 x 912 ft (547 x 278 m). A single true entrance among many false ones led into a huge courtyard full of dummy buildings, reproduced from those at Zoser’s palace; when the pharaoh went to the heavens, he intended to take the architecture he had commissioned with him. Beyond the entrance are avenues, columned halls, shrines, chapels, and store rooms. In this great monument, stone was used for the first time to roof over spaces, proving that it was a far more flexible material than\n\nIMHOTEP King Zoser of Egypt, a ruler in the 3rd Dynasty (2675–2625BCE), commissioned his chief vizier, Imhotep, to build his eternal resting place.

Five rectangular layers of brilliant white limestone were constructed on top of one another in decreasing dimensions to a height of 204 ft (62 m).

His tomb was robbed thousands of years ago, and the internal layout of the pyramid has changed, so we know little about him. However, we know that the pharaoh was buried alone in this massive, man-made mountain, which probably took 20 years to build with slave labor. The largest pyramid ever built, it originally stood 481 ft (147 m) high and consists of some 2.3 million blocks of stone weighing an average of 2.5 tons. Its four equal sides each measure 791 ft (241 m). The pyramid was originally covered with polished limestone, which has long since eroded or been removed. There are three chambers inside, though only one person was buried here.\n\nTHE PYRAMIDS AT GIZA\n\nThe King’s Chamber contained a huge granite sarcophagus without a lid Ivory\n\nstatuette This tiny figure, 3.5 in (9 cm) tall, dates from ca. 1590BCE.

The earliest of these tombs are in the parched mountains on the west side of the Nile near Thebes (now Luxor). Here, the mummies of pharaohs of the 18th, 19th, and 20th Dynasties were hidden in richly decorated rock chambers, some supported by rows of columns. These chambers can be as deep as 315 ft (96 m) below ground and as far as 690 ft (210 m) into the rock face, reached by long, sloping corridors, stairs, and labyrinthine antechambers.\n\nEarthly treasures Hidden below ground, the walls and ceilings of the many Tombs of the Kings are adorned with colorful paintings and elaborate inscriptions.\n\nTEMPLE OF KHONS, KARNAK KARNAK AK, EGYP EGYPTT C UNKN UNKNOWN OWN D PLAC PLACEE OF WOR WORSHIP SHIP A 1198BCE B KARN\n\nWhile pyramids and mortuary chapels were for the worship of kings, temples were for the worship of gods.

An avenue of sphinxes led to an obelisk and then the massive entrance pylon to the temple itself.

Today, the temple is as much a place to play\n\nhide-and-seek with local tourist guides as it is a source of architectural wonder. The grandest of all Egyptian temples, this is the collective work of kings and their architects and craftsmen over 1,200 years. Within its massive walls, smaller, earlier shrines are contained within later examples, so that, taken as a whole, the temple is a bit like a Russian doll. The temple site, by a sacred lake, measures a breathtaking 1,200 x 360 ft (366 x 110 m)—daunting for visitors on hot days—and is still connected, more or less, to the Temple at Luxor by an avenue of sphinxes. Once, no fewer than six pylons led into the temple’s various and vast courtyards, flanking temples, hypostyle courtyard, and numinous sanctuaries.

Stretched against and dug into an imposing rock face, the chapel looks remarkably modern to contemporary eyes, resembling a 19thcentury Neo-Classical museum or gallery.

The original setting of the temples on the banks of the Nile is today deep under the waters contained by the Aswan High Dam, itself a fine and memorable structure built to Russian design in the 1960s, some 3,200 years later. The two temples were removed, piece by piece, by craftsmen who sawed painstakingly through the ancient stones, reassembling them in a similar setting not so very far away. Originally approached through a courtyard, the imposing rock-face facade of the Great Temple, shaped in the guise of a giant pylon, is famous for its four gigantic statues of the seated Rameses II: here, quite clearly, was a king not prepared to do things by halves, much less by quarters. At his feet are small statues of his wife, Nefartari, his mother, Mut-tuy, and his children; above, a carved row of smiling baboons greets the ASWAN AND UNESCO During the four years from the start of construction of the Aswan High Dam to when the reservoir began filling, 24 ancient monuments were either moved to safer locations, like the Great Temple and the Temple of Isis, or given to countries that had aided the UNESCO-coordinated work; the Debod Temple, for example, now sits on a hill in Madrid, Spain.\n\nFlawed we ffacade wed Earthq Ear thq hqquak akee dama ak dama mage too the seconnd sec second nd of th t e four fou sstatu tuuess wass retai aiined inn th thee UNESCO UNE SCO O rrecon reecon constr strruction uct ction ion..\n\nsunrise.

Although the Egyptian era was drawing to a close when the temple was first built on Philae, the temple builders continued in much the same heroic vein as their inspired predecessors had done. By the high standards set a millennium earlier, r however, ever, the temple was a little crude in both dettail and execution. To the unschooled eye, a temple of 1300BCE can be hard to tell apart from one, like this, from the 3rd century BCE; yet despite the pylons, hypostyle courtyards, clerestory halls, and inner sanctuaries, there are differences. Capitals of the columns, for example, are more ornate than\n\nearlier designs, although more roughly carved. Intriguingly, in the temple complex there is a screen-walled kiosk known as the Pharaoh’s Bed, which was built by the Romans in the year 96. The Romans took up Egyptian design enthusiastically from the time of the affair between Cleopatra and Julius Caesar, and the influence of the architecture that graced the island of Philae can be seen far away in the ambitious grounds of Hadrian Hadrian’ss Villa, Villa Tivoli (see p.117). p 117)\n\nPerfect backdrop The Temple of Isis owes its quality as much to its picturesque setting, in its beautiful Nile-island location, as to its architecture.\n\nTEMPLE OF HORUS\n\nFORTRESS OF BUHEN\n\nA 57BCE B EDFU, EGYPT C PTOLEMY III D PLACE OF WORSHIP\n\nA 2130BCE B BUHEN, EGYPT C SESOSTRIS III D FORTIFICATION\n\nThis late Egyptian temple dedicated to the falcon god Horus is famous mostly for its fine state of preservation: it was effectively embalmed for centuries under the desert sands, with only the tops of its pylons visible. When eventually excavated, it revealed itself in all its 2,000-year-old glory. If it lacks the drama and outstanding artistic qualities of the temples at Karnak, for example, then this is not to belittle it: it is like comparing a great medieval parish church with a cathedral.\n\nThe fortress at Buhen, capital of Egyptian Nubia, must have been a daunting sight for Egypt’s southerly neighbors. Its muscular brick and stone walls, nearly 16 ft (5 m) thick, covered an area of 3.2 acres (1.3 ha). The fortress was surrounded by a dry moat, strengthened by bastions, defended by catapults mounted in purpose-built artillery emplacements, and isolated by drawbridges. Buhen was, in fact, only one of a chain of forts designed not only for war but also to protect trade routes to Egypt from the south. Nevertheless, the memory of Fort Buhen is a powerful reminder that the ancient Egyptians, for all their exquisite culture and religious architecture, were warriors with an impressive record established over thousands of years of crushing their foes. The construction of the Aswan High Dam in 1964 means that Fort Buhen and other warlike monuments along this stretch of the Nile are now submerged under the peaceful waters of Lake Nasser.\n\n66\n\nTHE AMERI CA S\n\nA MERICAN CIVILIZATIONS seem so very curious to modern eyes that their monuments have been taken as relics of the lost city of Atlantis.

The largest and best known were the Maya, y , Aztecs, s, and Incas, but others, including the Olmec, Zapotec, Teotihuacáns, Toltec, Mo och c e, and Nazca,\n\nOfferings to the gods Aztec art was often an expression of religion—this detail from an Aztec manuscript, or codex, depicts human sacrifice on temple steps.\n\nestablished their own highly distinctive cultures, developing new technologies and buildingg styles. ty The Olmecs, s, for example, who rose to prominence on the coast of southern Mexico from 1500BCE to 800BCE, introduced\n\nK E Y D AT E S ca. 100 BCE Teotihuacán, a monumental city, rises and thrives in the Valley of Mexico\n\nca. 50 Nazca culture flourishes in Peru, and creates the Nazca lines— vast and mysterious patterns on the ground that can only be interpreted from the air\n\n1CE ca. 1 El Mirador, Guatemala, the greatest early Mayan city, is at its height\n\nca. 250 Classic period of Mayan civilization begins in Guatemala, Honduras, and southern Mexico\n\n2 250 ca. 150 Mogollon culture develops in southwestern US; interesting painted pottery is produced\n\nca. 378 Rivalry between leading Mayan cities Tikal and Uaxactún ends in victory for Tikal\n\nca. 750 ca. 500 Hopewell culture in northern Collapse of Teotihuacán US builds burial civilization mounds, pottery, in Mexico and iron weapons\n\n500 ca. 700 In eastern Arizona, Pueblo people live in houses above ground for the first time\n\n750\n\n67\n\nTHE AMERICAS\n\nthe first calendar and the first hieroglyphic writing in the Western hemisphere; and the Teotihuacán civilization, which flourished from ca. 300BCE to 500CE, taking in most of Mesoamerica, created the sensationally impressive city of Teotihuacán (see p.71) near Mexico City. Mayan history begins around 1500BCE reaching its zenith from 300 to 900CE, evidenced by the huge stone pyramids and temples of the Mayan heartlands and by their achievements in mathematics and astronomy, which were recorded in hieroglyphs. Historians know more of the Aztec civilization of Mexico and the Inca Empire p centered in Peru. Yet,, both of these, with their magnificent irrigated cities, were undermined and all but destroyed by the Spanish. Hernán\n\nCortés (1485–1547), the Spanish conqueror of the Aztec Empire, brought not just firearms, cannons, and armor with him, but also the Inquisition, an insatiable greed for gold and silver, and diseases unknown to Mesoamerica. Within 70 years of his taking of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital, in 1521, the Aztec population had fallen from 15 million to three million; a similar fate befell the Incas. AZTEC ACHIEVEMENTS At its height, between about 1430 and its conquest by the Spaniards in 1521, the Aztec Empire extended over much of what is now Mexico. Aztec society had a rigid structure, guided by an all-pervasive religion that influenced d styles of building; the great city of Tenoch htitlan (the site of Mexico City today) includeed a vast temple complex, a royal palace,, and numerous canals.\n\nAndes mountains Even today, Quechua (Inca) speakers in Peru make ritual offerings to the sacred mountains, the inspiration of soo muc m h iinn their architecture. mu\n\nAztec Sun Calendar Originally placeed on the temple in Tenochtitlan, the Sun Calendaar is evidence of Aztec knowledge of astronomy annd mathematics.\n\nca. 1000 Leif Ericson, the Viking explorer, reaches North America; European eyes turn to America\n\nca. 1250 Mayan revival; following collapse of Chichén Itzá, a new capital is built at Mayapán\n\n1000 ca. 900 Mayan civilization in southern Mexico collapses; many cities abandoned\n\nca. 1440 In a display of power and skill, Incas build a great fortress at Cuzco\n\nca. 15th C.

The conquering Spaniards were astonished by the gleaming cities they found, which made their own seem like grubby villages. Indeed, of all the world’s cities at the time, only Istanbul had a population greater than that of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital. he greatest builders among the old American civilizations were the Teotihuacáns. Their capital was Teotihuacán, 37 miles (60 km) north-east of present-day Mexico City. Founded around 300BCE, it reached its peak between 200 and 400CE, when its population has been estimated at up to 200,000. Teotihuacán was vast for its day: the main street, the “Avenue of the Dead”, runs for at least 1.2 miles (2 km) right through the heart of the city. Measuring 148–295 ft (45–90 m) wide, the avenue was overlooked by houses raised on stone terraces, and two huge pyramids dedicated to the sun and moon (see p.71). Aztec visitors called Teotihuacán “The City of the Gods.” Standing among the remains today, one can almost believe that it was indeed built by giants or gods. The city was abandoned during the Toltec invasion in ca. 900CE. Sadly, no\n\nT\n\none has yet found inscriptions, much less clay tablets or scrolls, written in the Teotihuacán language. MOUNTAINOUS MONUMENTS\n\nThe lasting monuments of the civilizations of Central America are stepped pyramids that rise from jungle clearings like mountain peaks. The best of these, such as the Temple of the Warriors at Chichén Itzá or the Palace of the Governors at Uxmal (see p.73), are large, genuinely impressive designs and structures. And yet, we still know far too little about them. North of what today is the Mexican border, there was very little in the way of permanent architecture. With the exception of a small number of rock-face pueblos, the development of architecture in what is now the United States had to wait for the arrival of the Pilgrim Fathers and other settlers from Europe.\n\nA 145 FT (44 M) TALL TEMPLE IN THE MAYAN CITY OF TIKAL, GUATEMALA, TYPICAL OF THE STEPPED PYRAMID STRUCTURES BUILT BY THE CIVILIZATIONS OF CENTRAL AMERICA.\n\n70\n\nTHE AMERI CA S\n\nELEMENTS Stepped pyramids were the predominant form of monumental architecture in pre-Colonial America. These had few rooms, as interiors mattered less than the ritual presence of these imposing structures and the public ceremonies they hosted; so, platforms, altars, processional stairs, statuary, and carving were all important.\n\nSerpent\n\ncolumns The heads of serpents and other monsters, often with bright eyes and savage teeth, project from the walls and columns of many temples. This particular guardian can be found at the Temple of the Warriors at Chichén Itzá.\n\nStone\n\nmasks Grimacing stone masks designed to inspire fear stare from the walls of temples and palaces.

It lies to the left of the “Avenue of the Dead”—a 1.2 mile (2 km) thoroughfare named by 12th-century Aztecs when they inherited the city. They thought the pyramids were burial places; in fact, they were temples. The great pyramid at Teotihuacán, like other buildings in the region, was built using local adobe, or mud, mixed with rubble, and then faced in stone. It was adorned with plaster, reliefs, and color. There are no chambers inside the pyramid, but it is topped by a temple reached by a series of ramps and steps. Built over an earlier structure, the pyramid measures 711 x 711 ft (217 x 217 m) at its base, and it rises to a height of 187 ft (57 m). This type of temple was part of a range of sacred pyramid mountains built across a huge area. area In Teotihuacán, Teotihuacán the pyramid is QUETZALCOATL This Aztec name, meaning “feathered serpent,” relates to an ancient god of much earlier cultures. It is also a name given to the great warrior king who conquered many neighboring peoples in ca. 950–1000. The two have become confused "
