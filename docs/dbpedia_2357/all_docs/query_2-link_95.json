My interest in medieval Andhra was first stimulated by V. Narayana Rao, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and led to a doctoral dissertation on the topic of religious gifts in Kakatiya Andhra, much of which is incorporated in chapter 3 of this work. A Fulbright-Hays doctoral dissertation grant funded the initial period of research in India. I am grateful to Sri Venkateswara University in Tirupati for providing an institutional affiliation, and to the directors and staff of the Chief Epigraphist's Office at Mysore and the Andhra Pradesh Department of Archaeology and Museums in Hyderabad for allowing access to many unpublished inscriptions. I especially wish to thank Prof. S. S. Ramachandra Murthy of Sri Venkateswara University for the many painstaking hours he spent reading through Telugu inscriptions with me. My doctoral research was summarized in the article \"Temples, Donors, and Gifts: Patterns of Patronage in Thirteenth Century South India,\" published in the Journal of Asian Studies (vol. 50, no. 2 [1991], pp. 308—40). Portions of it are reprinted here with permission of the Association for Asian Studies. I subsequently began to examine aspects of Kakatiya Andhra beyond religious patronage, resulting in chapters 2 and 4 of this work. Two interim analyses of Kakatiya society and polity appeared in the articles \"Political Intermediaries in Kakatiya Andhra, 1175-1325\" and \"A Revised View of Traditional' India: Caste, Status, and Social Mobility in Medieval Andhra,\" in Indian Economic and Social History Review (vol. 31, no. 3 [1994]: 261-89) and South Asia (vol. 15, no. 1 [1992]: 17-52), respectively. I thank Sage Publication India Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi, India and the editor of South Asia for permission to publish revised versions of these articles here. I am also indebted to Prof. Noboru Karashima, formerly of the University of Tokyo, for including me in a team project on Vijayanagara inscriptions that was funded by the Mitsubishi Foundation. While working on his project, I was able to return to India in 1991 and examine many of the inscriptions utilized in chapters 1 and 5. Additional materials analyzed in chapter 5 were collected in 1992 at the India Office Library with the partial assistance of a Bernadette E. Schmitt Grant\n\nvi\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nfor Research in European, African, or Asian History from the American Historical Association. I am especially grateful to the National Endowment for the Humanities for awarding me a fellowship in 1992-93, which led to the inception of this work in its present form. Many other colleagues have assisted me over the years and it gives me great pleasure to thank some of them individually. For their comments on earlier drafts of the book, in whole or in part, I am very grateful to Peter Glaus, Richard Eaton, Anne Feldhaus, Patrick Olivelle and his graduate seminar on classical Indian culture and society, Leslie Orr, John F. Richards, George Spencer, and Phillip Wagoner. I have also much appreciated the support extended by Susan M. Deeds, James Heitzman, Eugene Irschick, David Shulman, and Thomas R. Trautmann. I am also obliged to Phillip Wagoner and John Henry Rice for providing the photograph on the cover. My greatest thanks go to my husband, Eric Schenk, whose love and encouragement helped sustain me during the seemingly interminable gestation of this book. Without Eric's nurturing, in addition to my labor, it might never have seen the light of day.\n\nContents\n\nList of Maps and Tables\n\nix\n\nNote on Transliteration and Translation\n\nxi\n\nAbbreviations Introduction: Medieval India, A History in Transition Regions and Regionalism in Medieval India\n\nxiii 1 4\n\nInscriptions as Historical Sources\n\n11\n\nPlan of the Book\n\n16\n\n1.

While technical terms discussed in the text are transliterated with diacritical marks and always italicized, the names of places and people are given in standardized or simplified forms. Hence the common, Anglicized, spellings of place-names— Srisailam, Cuddapah, Visakhapatnam, and the like—are used throughout. Personal names, as well as some proper nouns, are transliterated in a simplified version that does not differentiate vowel length or consonant class (such as retroflex or dental) and according to which the vowel r is represented by ri, c by ch, and both 3 and s by sh. When words appear in italics, a more scholarly system of transliteration is employed with full use of diacritical marks. I therefore indicate long e and o vowels, not only in Telugu but even in Sanskrit words (although they are always long in the latter). Instead of using m to indicate the Telugu sunna symbol, a circle that stands for all nasal sounds, I employ the appropriate nasal sign from Sanskrit orthography in order to better represent the actual pronunciation. Some readers may be unfamiliar with the transliterated form r, used for a letter in medieval Telugu script that is now obsolete and replaced by the standard r. I also adopt the equal sign between compounded words in Sanskrit phrases to indicate that the following vowel has been subjected to euphonic change under the grammatical rule of sandhi. Nouns are generally cited in their root forms, without inflection—for example, ndyaka rather than the Telugu masculine singular form ndyudu or masculine plural ndyakulu. In the case of Telugu words of neuter gender, however, I generally append the medieval mu ending, as with nayankaramu; in modern Telugu, the final u of neuter words is usually dropped. All translations from Sanskrit and Telugu are my own, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nxi\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nAbbreviations\n\nAPAS\n\nAPRE ARE CPIHM CTI EA El HAS\n\nIAP\n\nNDI SII SS TIAP TL TS TTD\n\nAndhra Pradesh Archaeological Series No. 3 = Kannada Inscriptions of Andhra Pradesh No. 9 = Select Stone Inscriptions from the A.P.

It is certain that the few features of which we have any description from the Greeks, bear no inaccurate resemblance to those which are found to distinguish this people at the present day. From this resemblance, from the state of improvement in which the Indians remain, and from the stationary condition in which their institutions first, and then their manners and character, have a tendency to fix them, it is no unreasonable supposition, that they have presented a very uniform appearance during the long interval from the visit of the Greeks to that of the English. Their annals, however, from that era till the period of the Mahomedan conquests, are a blank. James Mill, The History o/British India (1826, 2:146-47)\n\nJames Mill is virtually a caricature of the colonial project to construct a history of India, so extreme are his views. 1 Yet the opinion he expressed in the preceding passage represents a prominent strand of nineteenth-century thinking about India which portrayed it as fundamentally unchanging. According to Mill, India was \"exactly the same\" when Europeans began to arrive in the sixteenth century as it had been at the time of an earlier European intrusion, that of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century B.C.E. Nothing of consequence had occurred during the two millennia that had elapsed because India was \"stationary.\" Karl Marx, like Mill a commentator on India who had neither visited it nor studied its languages, echoed the widespread Orientalist conviction that the Eastern Other was slumbering in a time warp when he characterized India as a civilization composed of self-sufficient villages in which the lifestyle of time immemorial was reproduced indefinitely (1972: 38-41). Despite the inherent absurdity of such a proposition and despite the concerted attack on Orientalism waged over the last two decades, the assertion that India was largely unchanging has not vanished from the secondary literature. 2 Although Mill's book has been called the \"oldest hegemonic account of India within the Anglo-French imperial formation\" (Inden 1990: 45), not all colonialera scholars shared his negative views on the entirety of Indian history. An alternate\n\nI\n\n2\n\nPrccoJonia! India in Practice\n\ninterpretation first emerged in the late eighteenth century which stressed the greatness of India in ancient times, as a major world power. This was the age of India's great empires under the dynasties of the Mauryas and Guptas, comparable both in time and in scope to classical antiquity in the Greco-Roman world. But the glories of ancient India could not be sustained, and, similar to events in the West, the Indian Middle Ages declined for a thousand years or more from the previously high civilizational standard. The indigenous belief that society had gradually deteriorated as the cycle of four ages (yuga) progressed contributed to the colonial perception that India had reached its apex long ago (Rocher 1993: 226; Trautmann 1997: 67). The notion of a medieval decline was incorporated into Vincent Smith's Early History of India, which superseded Mill's text in the early twentieth century, and it prevails even today among proponents of the Indian feudalism school, a branch of Marxist historiography.3 The middle period of Indian history fared poorly in both of these influential conceptions of the Indian past. From its initial depiction as a stagnant era in the unchanging India of James Mill and Karl Marx, medieval India became a dark age, a period when things actively regressed, in the subsequent model of a degenerate India. The exact periodization varied since the decline commenced in the seventh or eighth centuries according to some interpretations, or with the establishment of Muslim rule in North India from 1200 onward according to others. But the same symptoms of decay were widely cited: artistic standards declined as classical forms were overelaborated in a mindless replication, religious beliefs were corrupted by the accretion of folk superstitions, society was increasingly choked by the weight of a rigid caste hierarchy, and political instability resulted from the increasing fragmentation of kingdoms. Wildly differing reasons were advanced for this sorry state of affairs, ranging from the deleterious impact of Muslim rule to the stultifying effects of Oriental despotism and the Asiatic mode of production. A favorite culprit has been the caste system, regarded as a cancerous growth that undermined all attempts at political unity and thus led to the engulfing of the state by society. 4 Regardless of the cause, it was agreed that the medieval past had produced an ossified India resistant to reform and enfeebled by foreign conquest. Medieval India is now being rehabilitated, historiographically speaking, and one of my primary aims is to contribute to this ongoing process. Far from constituting a moribund or regressive phase, the medieval era in my opinion was a period of progressive change, characterized by the extension of agrarian settlement, a rise in the number of religious institutions, an expansion of commercial activity, and an evolution of political systems and networks. As the agrarian frontier advanced farther and farther, it was accompanied by a culture that valued the making and recording of religious gifts. Although this process occurred throughout the subcontinent, simultaneously but at differing tempos, a multitude of permutations occurred on the main theme. The particulars of religious belief and practice varied from place to place, as did the specific configurations of the human communities who participated together in religious worship, as well as in the larger social, economic, and political spheres that intersected at the shrine or temple. Out of these many variables emerged the distinctive regional societies that comprise India today and it is the medieval history of one of them, Andhra Pradesh, that constitutes the\n\nA History in Transition\n\n3\n\nsubject of this book. As we increasingly recognize the nature and extent of the transformations that characterized the medieval past, our evaluation of the period has correspondingly altered—it is in this sense that we can speak of the history of medieval India as both a history in transition and a history of transition. Some of the impetus for a reappraisal of medieval India arises from recent revisionist research on the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the time span when British rule was first extended over parts of India. A number of scholars now argue that the \"traditional\" India recorded by later colonial observers represented neither the early colonial era nor its precolonial predecessor. This \"traditional\" India was allegedly an atomized civilization composed of self-sufficient villages, upon whom the ephemeral state systems of the subcontinent had little impact. Religion and kinship, rather than economics or politics, were the dominant principles ordering society and so the parameters of existence for the masses was dictated by the inflexible hereditary caste structure headed by brahman religious specialists. But the British commentators who identified these features of \"traditional\" India failed to realize how much change had already been wrought by colonial rule, according to the revisionist view. Indeed, much of what was described as \"traditional\" was a product of the colonial presence. Revisionist scholars believe the indigenous social system was depoliticized in the early colonial period through elimination of the pivotal role of the king. British intervention, by removing the king from his focal position at the center of society, truncated the top levels of what had been an extensive redistributive system integrating the various sectors and thereby forcibly separated the hitherto joint economic, political, and social hierarchies. In the economic sphere, British rule thus resulted in the emergence of the self-sufficient village. Similarly, in the newly autonomous social sphere, the dislocations caused by colonialism led to the replacement of the king by brahmans as the arbiters of social order. If these assertions are correct, it follows that our conceptions of \"traditional\" India apply primarily to nineteenth-century India, a society transformed by colonial rule, and not to earlier periods of Indian history.5 Further grounds for reconsidering older interpretations of the medieval era come from new research that places India in a broader world-historical setting. Our enhanced understanding of India's importance within the larger Indian Ocean trade networks modifies traditional thinking about both the activities of Indian mercantile communities and the volume of domestic trade. Studies have shown that precolonial Indian merchants acted in an entrepreneurial manner in supplying commodities for export to distant domestic markets as well as international ones. In doing so, they stimulated the production of commercial goods and the expansion of overland and coastal trade routes that linked many portions of the subcontinent. These commercial networks existed even before the Europeans came to the Indian Ocean around 1500, extending both westward to the Middle East and eastward to Southeast Asia. The implications of such findings are obvious—medieval India can no longer be regarded as a world of isolated villages struggling on a subsistence economy.6 A final factor in the changing assessment of medieval India is the small but growing body of analytically oriented historical scholarship on South India, which implicitly contradicts earlier notions of a medieval decline in the realms of economics\n\n4\n\nPrecolonia! India in Practice\n\nand politics while it simultaneously enlarges the scope of our historiographic gaze by shining light on the activities of peasants and merchants along with those of the more visible priests and kings.? Whether we are speaking of research on early colonial India, early modern India, or medieval South India, therefore, we find an emerging consensus that previous conceptualizations of precolonial or \"traditional\" Indian society and history are seriously flawed. This work seeks to add momentum to the current historiographic shift that is recasting the medieval past more and more in a dynamic and progressive form. In the process, it will fill in some of the blank spaces in the historiography of non-Muslim India, which James Mill believed had produced no historical records.\n\nRegions and Regionalism in Medieval India My reconstruction of the medieval past limits itself to the region of Andhra, one of the least studied parts of the subcontinent. Yet today Andhra Pradesh is the largest state in South India, with more than 100,000 square miles in land and a population of more than 66 million in 1991 (map 1). In European terms, it is roughly comparable to Italy in both size and extent of population.8 Andhra Pradesh did not attain its current form until 1956, as a result of administrative reorganization of state boundaries along linguistic lines.9 But defined not as the modern state called Andhra Pradesh (\"Andhra province\") but rather as the territory inhabited by the Telugu-speaking people, Andhra has a history stretching back more than a millennium. The broadest sweep of time surveyed in this book, the centuries from 1000 to 1650, corresponds to the era during which the geographic contours of the modern linguistic region were established. Several chapters focus more narrowly on the years between 1175 and 1325, the period when much of modern Andhra Pradesh was politically unified for the first time under the rule of an indigenous dynasty, the Kakatiyas. For centuries afterward, the Kakatiyas figured prominently in conceptions of the regional community they had helped create by consolidating the dry upland territories of Andhra with the older coastal zone of settlement. Although a geographic focus on one region consigns developments occurring across a larger arena to the periphery of our historiographic gaze, there are good reasons for choosing a regional point of view. Regions did not exist in airtight compartments, of course, and the circulation of goods, people, and ideas throughout the subcontinent and beyond was an important source of medieval India's dynamism. In fact, the balance of power among the various kingdoms of early medieval India was significantly affected by shifts in the geographic foci of Indian Ocean trade networks, as Andre Wink has demonstrated (1990). But the growth of regional societies, as the most outstanding feature of the medieval period as a whole, demands our attention. Between 500 and 1500, there was a vast expansion in the territorial spread of \"historic\" society in India, the civilization that left behind monumental buildings and written documents. This civilization simultaneously took on more differentiated forms, as local elites appropriated features of pan-Indie culture in varying ways and local societies coalesced in diverse configurations. The internal dynamics thus differed from place to place, even if propelled by the same underlying\n\nA History in Transition\n\n5\n\nMap 1. Location of Andhra Pradesh\n\nforces of agrarian expansion and demographic increase. Anything larger than a regional perspective would obscure the critical variables leading to the emergence of distinctive local societies, while anything less would fail to account for the regionally differentiated India of today. In the past decade, scholars of contemporary India have increasingly come to regard regional patterns of cultural practice as the significant units of study (e.g., Erndl 1993; Feldhaus 1995) and called for greater attention to the historical processes that led to their emergence (Leavitt 1992). The interpretation of medieval India I advance here agrees in its basic thrust with that of B. D. Chattopadhyaya, whose research, centered on North India in the centuries from 700 to 1200, has consistently presented an alternative to the\n\n6\n\nPrecoionial India in Practice\n\nstandard depiction of the medieval period as \"a breakdown of the civilizational matrix of early historical India\" (1994: 2). 10 Instead, Chattopadhyaya identifies three major historical processes that gained momentum from 700 onward: the expansion of state society both horizontally and vertically, the assimilation and acculturation of previously tribal peoples, and the integration of local religious cults and practices. Hermann Kulke's work on Orissa has led him to similar conclusions about medieval India (1978a, b, and c; 1982). Because of its large tribal population and many scattered centers of settlement, medieval Orissa provides an exceptionally vivid illustration of how the growth of regional polities proceeded hand in hand with the incorporation of indigenous deities and the \"peasantization\" of tribal societies. On that basis, Kulke has formulated a schema of the progressive stages of medieval state formation: from chiefdom to early kingdom to imperial kingdom (1995a). The most noticeable sign of regional development during the medieval era is indeed the proliferation of polities. In contrast to the ancient period, when large portions of India were dominated by a single empire for several centuries, the states of medieval India were smaller and more numerous (Schwartzberg 1977: 218—21). They were also increasingly situated in areas that had not earlier produced states. The first indigenous polity in peninsular India, the Satavahana kingdom, did date back to the first two centuries of the common era, but its influence extended only over parts of the Deccan and not the far South. From the sixth and seventh centuries onward, the pace of state formation in the peninsula began to accelerate with the rise of the Pallavas in northern Tamil Nadu, the Pandyas in the southern tip of the peninsula, and the Chalukyas of Badami in central Karnataka, who each absorbed or enveloped other budding states along the way. The three-way struggle for power persisted until the middle of the ninth century, followed by a period of several centuries when two polities dominated South India (i.e., the Cholas of the Tamil country versus first the Rashtrakutas and later the Kalyani Chalukyas, both of whom were based in the Western Deccan). The diffusion of political centers was even more apparent by the thirteenth century, when no fewer than four major kingdoms flourished within the confines of the peninsula. R. S. Sharma and other adherents of the Indian feudalism school of thought interpret the proliferation of states in early medieval India as evidence of political disintegration. The main culprit, in their opinion, was the growing popularity of royal land grants, the assignment of rights to income from land, which were first given as charitable endowments to brahmans and then later given in lieu of salary to secular officials. By alienating large tracts of land from royal control and thus fragmenting political authority, this practice allegedly led to the demise of strong central power. Officials increasingly turned into semi-autonomous feudal lords who encroached further and further on the rights of the peasantry, thereby producing a more stratified and less free society. Meanwhile, the medieval economy was becoming both demonetized and deurbanized as levels of trade dropped precipitously. Hence the proliferation of states, according to this thesis, was both a symptom and a cause of medieval India's regression into feudalism. 11 But the phenomena that feudalism proponents interpret as medieval decline can be more readily explained in opposite terms, as indicative of the vitality of the\n\nA History in Transition\n\n7\n\nMiddle Ages. The feudalism model assumes that political power was centralized in prefeudal times, for only then could new political bases represent a siphoning off of established political authority. Except in the core areas around their capitals, however, there is little evidence that the ancient empires exercised direct control over their subjects or territories. The supposedly extensive territorial dimensions of the ancient empires have also been questioned. Outside of the Gangetic heartland, there were huge tracts of forested land interspersed between the small pockets of settled agriculture. It is these scattered outposts of \"civilization\" that were incorporated into the ancient empires, and even then, in an indirect manner— that is, via the intercession of more localized authority. 12 With the premise that the ancient empires were centralized bureaucratic states controlling the bulk of Indian territory now thoroughly discredited, the entire Indian feudalism thesis falls apart.13 The polities that appear throughout the subcontinent during the Middle Ages were not the dispersed fragments of a previous central government, but new formations arising out of the extension of agrarian settlement and the resulting growth of population. And the increasing number of political powers who figure in the historical record do not evidence the usurpation of royal power by a formerly dependent class, but instead the emergence of new political elites among the evolving societies along the agrarian frontier. While agrarian development provided a material stimulus, state formation was also facilitated by the transmission of a pan-Indie royal ideology and idiom throughout the subcontinent and eventually beyond it into Southeast Asia. From the fourth century onward, this Indie discourse of kingship was typically expressed in the Sanskrit language and so Sheldon Pollock has labeled the elite world that shared it the Sanskrit cosmopolis. Through the medium of Sanskrit, an entire set of assumptions \"about the nature and aesthetics of polity—about kingly virtue and learning; the dharma of rule; the universality of dominion\" was circulated widely, creating a transregional \"symbolic network\" of vast proportions (1996: 230). At least in the public expressions of power, a homogeneity in practice and thought united the various political elites of the first millennium. A series of interrelated cultural appropriations—the assimilation of pan-Indie or Sanskritic ways of speaking and doing (including, most prominently, patronage of the brahman bearer of the Sanskrit language and tradition)—were integral to the emergence of numerous foci of political power in peninsular India during the second half of the first millennium. As regional societies matured and became more self-confident in the early centuries of the second millennium, regional languages gradually took over many of the roles previously performed by Sanskrit. This displacement occurred not only through the composition of literary texts but also in the expanded use of the regional language for inscriptional purposes, as Pollock notes perceptively. The regional languages of the Deccan first appear in inscriptions centuries before any surviving literary texts. Telugu, for instance, dates back as far as the sixth century in inscriptional texts, whereas the earliest literary text belongs to the mid eleventh century. But regional languages were typically used only to document the details of religious endowments, while the poetic, or nonbusiness, portions of early medieval inscriptions (genealogies, eulogies of kings, invocations to the gods, etc.) were\n\n8\n\nPrecolonial India in Practice\n\ncomposed entirely in Sanskrit. The Sanskrit cosmopolis began to collapse when regional languages started to encroach on the discursive realm of Sanskrit, that is, when regional languages had achieved sufficient prestige and authority to assume symbolic and aesthetic functions in inscriptions. 14 At roughly the same time, the first important literary texts were produced in the languages of the Deccan. The shift toward a regional idiom in inscriptions and literary texts indicates that medieval elites were becoming more localized in character. Both the composers and patrons of written works in a regional language were acting within a geographically circumscribed field of communication and meaning, in comparison to the pan-Indic scope of Sanskrit discourse. To be sure, the new literatures borrowed heavily from Sanskritic models and transregional literature continued to be written in Sanskrit and later in Persian. Nor were the worlds of the different regional languages mutually exclusive—the educated and experienced might well be versed in two or more languages, while the power of patronage could easily summon someone who was. But writing was increasingly directed to the regional audience in the late medieval age, surely a significant change in cultural practice. One reason for this is the expanded social range of people involved in the production of inscriptions and literary texts—people to whom, we might speculate, Sanskrit was impressive but only the regional language was accessible. Even kings and learned brahmans, who might have opted otherwise, participated in the burgeoning regional literary cultures, however. The regional world was the one that mattered most to the elite societies of the late medieval peninsula. 15 Through the expanded use of regional languages in writing, regionally based communities of elites became more firmly demarcated and differentiated from each other. It is one of these elite communities, the society represented in Telugu inscriptions, whose activities are of chief interest to me. Language, in other words, sets the parameters for what is examined in this book, although inclusion in the Kakatiya political network (in other words, a common political culture) is an additional factor. By using language to define the unit under analysis, it might be argued, I am attributing an unwarranted coherency to the linguistic area of medieval Telugu. For example, Sudipta Kaviraj points out that linguistic regions have often replaced nations in discourse on precolonial India, even though they are just \"as much a historical construction as the nation is\" (1992: 22-23). Another possible objection is that I am implicitly privileging language as the central component of group identity, when it was but one of many elements. Let me anticipate these criticisms by saying more about the community constituted by a common literary language in medieval Andhra. Our dependence on written source materials in reconstructing past societies means that we can observe only traces of the elite groups. The community responsible for the production of Telugu inscriptions and literary texts, whether as sponsors, composers, or engravers, was a select category. When I refer to the Telugu linguistic region in medieval Andhra, therefore, I do not mean the entire body of people who spoke languages or dialects that we might classify as Telugu today. Instead, I am alluding to the small portion of the population that was involved in some fashion with the composing and recording of written Telugu. Presumably these people were also Telugu speakers, but there was a considerable\n\nA History in Transition\n\n9\n\ndifference between written and spoken forms of the language in this period (and indeed until recently in the South Indian languages), a difference that was probably one of the main attractions of the literary language for the elite. The boundaries separating participants in literate Telugu discourse from those who operated in other discursive realms were no doubt \"soft\" (to use Prasenajit Duara's term, 1995: 65-66) or \"fuzzy\" (Kaviraj 1992: 25-26). Moreover, it was only within particular contexts that an allegiance or affiliation with written Telugu was meaningful, whereas in different contexts other bases of social identity would come to the forefront. The medieval linguistic region of my analysis thus bears little resemblance to the bounded enumerable community of modern Telugu speakers; nor did linguistic ties of the past have the focus and intensity of modern linguistic nationalisms. There is no question that linguistic identities were operative in medieval peninsular India, however, no matter how restricted in their social circulation. At least at the level of elite cultural practice, there was a clear consciousness of affiliation with one regional language rather than another and even a certain degree of pride. \"Of all the regional languages, Telugu is the most excellent,\" so the Vijayanagara king Krishnadeva Raya of the early sixteenth century was supposedly told by a god who calls himself the Telugu king and refers to Krishnadeva Raya as the Kannada king.16 Nor is the notion of a linguistic region a modern construct, for medieval South Indian sources draw an explicit connection between language and region, as in the designation deia-bhdsd, literally, \"language of the land,\" signifying the regional languages or vernaculars. Even before the peninsular regional languages had fully emerged on the literary level, moreover, the ninth-century scholar Rajashekhara described the linguistic geography of India, associating particular places with particular styles of Sanskrit literature and speech practices (Deshpande 1993b: 91-92). Finally, the idea that linguistic groups constituted cultural communities was by no means introduced to India by the British (contra Washbrook 1991: 190), for language (more specifically, the Sanskrit language) was the main feature thought to differentiate the civilized from the barbaric in ancient India (Parasher 1991: 42-43). Language was thus important in Indian conceptions of culture, region, and community well before the modern age.17 To anyone familiar with precolonial India, it may seem that I am belaboring the issue of medieval literary communities and their significance. Nor would those individuals have to be reminded that large-scale identities prevailed primarily among the elites in premodern societies, creating what Anthony D. Smith has called \"lateral-aristocratic ethnie,\" or forms of incipient ethnicity that united the upper classes over a widespread geographical area as opposed to the \"vertical-demotic\" forms more characteristic of the modern era (1986: 79—84). Yet my insistence that a consciousness of literary communities existed in precolonial India seems necessary given the tenor of recent post-Orientalist scholarship.18 Much of this scholarship has been dedicated to challenging colonial constructs of caste and religious community, on the grounds that colonial policies and perceptions actually created these broadly based identities (e.g., Cohn 1984; Dirks 1989; Pandey 1990). In this process, post-Orientalists have questioned whether any supralocal allegiances existed at all in India prior to the late nineteenth century. Colonialism thus occupies the\n\n10\n\nPrecoionial India in Practice\n\nsame role in post'Orientalist theory that modernity occupies in the theories of Benedict Anderson and other like-minded scholars, as the fomenter of widespread and self-conscious communities where none had existed before. Both post-Orientalism and modernist theories of nationalism posit too radical a rupture between the \"traditional\" and the \"modern,\" in my opinion.19 The scale and exclusivity of modern communities may be a new development, but the processes leading to identity formation are much the same as in the past. Whether in medieval or modern India, various attributes or cultural practices like language, political allegiance, and a shared history were selectively deployed in order to mobilize the sense of community. Conceptions of a regional identity that merged linguistic and political affiliation were articulated during the era of the Kakatiyas (1175-1325 C.E.), when the territorial boundaries of the state were largely congruent with the Telugu-speaking area, and they continued to persist even after the demise of the Kakatiyas. The past and the present are hence united through the continued appropriation and redeployment of past constructions of community into the present, another reason why we should not emphasize too much the difference between them. And, just as in the present, historical actors in medieval Andhra belonged simultaneously to a number of communities and possessed a multiplicity of identities. Individuals represented themselves in inscriptions as members of specific social classes and as participants in particular polities, while their acts of endowment gave them entry into certain circles of religious worship. These other levels of community were generally encompassed within the linguistic region, however, for most temple networks were locally based and the typology of social classes was specific to the Telugu area. In the sense that many other allegiances were circumscribed by the linguistic region, therefore, we can point to language as the most important cultural affiliation in the medieval South. My choice of Andhra runs counter to the predominant scholarly concentration on those regions that produced the earliest and largest political cultures. From the viewpoint of historiography, Andhra is not one of the more glamorous regions of India. It may have a larger areal extent and population today than either of its neighbors, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, but its literary history commenced considerably later, and it never produced an empire that triumphantly subjugated other territories. The study of Tamil Nadu, in particular, has so overshadowed that of Andhra that the Tamil country is synonymous with South India in academic parlance. But Andhra is by no means anomalous in its relative paucity of historical documentation nor in its failure to generate a transregional polity. One could easily argue, in fact, that its historical experience is more representative of the subcontinent as a whole, since only a handful of core areas consistently dominated the historical stage in terms of their political, economic, and cultural impact. A similar case could be made for the time period 1175 to 1325 C.E., to which much of this book is devoted. As an era when no empires flourished in peninsular India, it is more typical of the medieval period overall than the ninth, eleventh, or sixteenth centuries when the polities of the Rashtrakutas, Cholas, and Vijayanagara reached their respective zeniths. Unlike the densely populated and fertile nuclear zones of Indian civilization to which historians have devoted the greatest attention, much of Andhra and the\n\nA History in Transition\n\n11\n\nrest of the subcontinent was less favored ecologically and slower to produce written sources. But precisely because it was still very much in the process of being settled, medieval Andhra exhibits many dynamic qualities, including a level of physical and social mobility not found in the older localities as well as a large degree of fluidity in the configurations of political power. In this era when regional societies were emerging throughout India, many other areas must have resembled Andhra in undergoing rapid change. If this assumption is correct, Andhra society serves far better as a gauge of the validity of standard characterizations of traditional India than the more commonly examined societies of areas like the Kaveri River delta or the mid'Gangetic plain. Jn adding to our knowledge of a poorly understood region and era, a case study of medieval Andhra also redresses the balance, in small measure, in a historiography of India skewed toward the imperial heartlands.\n\nInscriptions as Historical Sources One of the hallmarks of this work is its heavy reliance on a particular kind of historical source material, medieval stone inscriptions. The use of contemporary data must be central to any effort to recover an alternative vision of medieval India, one that is not distorted by the prism of the colonial past. If nothing else, the critique of Orientalism has taught us to be cautious about adopting historical interpretations formulated in the colonial period. Nor can we trust much in ethnographic observations from the past century, for we can no longer assume that they pertain to the same India that existed in precolonial times. Projections backward from the early colonial era, though helpful, can obscure the changes of the intervening centuries. Our only recourse is to tease out what we can from the admittedly slim corpus of material that survives from the medieval period. And inscriptions are by far the most abundant of our original sources for a reconstruction of Kakatiya Andhra, the focus of much of this book.20 Because stone inscriptions from medieval South India typically record religious donations, a history constructed from their perspective assigns greatest weight to the documented activities of real individuals rather than to the normative ideals prevalent in much of the contemporary literature. Epigraphic texts describe the kinds of property given away and also provide other useful details: the date of the gift, the donor's name, his/her family background and personal accomplishments, and praise of the monarch. In other words, they tell us when, where, and what specific persons donated to Hindu temples. Inscriptions enable us to track individual actors in motion and are thus our primary source of information on what people actually did as opposed to what they were supposed to do. And the range of social groups represented in inscriptions is considerably more diverse than in the case of elite literary compositions—merchants, landed peasants, herders, and warrior chiefs, along with their wives, daughters, mothers, and sisters—figure among the donors whose beneficence inscriptions record, rather than just kings and brahmans. Before proceeding any further, a concrete example illustrating both the kinds of information and donors appearing in medieval Andhra inscriptions might be helpful. In this portion of a longer inscription from coastal Andhra (SII 5.130), recording\n\n12\n\nPrecolonial India in Practice\n\nthe gift of a veterinarian specializing in the treatment of horses, the essential details are narrated quite rapidly: May all fare well and prosper!21 In the 1,222th year of the Shaka era [1300 C.E.], on the 1st (day of the) bright (fortnight of the lunar month) Jyeshtha, a Friday; The doctor of horses Vasudeva Pandita, son of Ananta Pandita, of the Atreya gotra, in order to endow the illustrious great lord Kshirarameshvara with a perpetual lamp for the religious benefit of his mother and father and the long life of his son Ananta Peddi; gave 50 milch cows and 2 kha(ndugas) of our land south of Jiyani tank in Penamanchchili (village) as lamp-land.22 Also, 5 tumus to the north of the fieldboundaries of Malluru (village) and 5 tumus north of that in centrally located fields for a total of 3 khafndugas of land). Having accepted these cows and this land, Donabola Kata Boya's son Nare Boya, Ramana Boya, and Pakka Kommana Boya's son Nare Boya, agree to supply one mana of ghee according to the nandi-manika measure daily for as long as the moon and sun endure.23 He who steals (endowed) land, whether given by himself or by another, will be reborn as a maggot in excrement for (the next) 60,000 years. The medieval India witnessed from the vantage point of inscriptions—which includes donors like the horse doctor Vasudeva Pandita in its purview, along with herders and others to whom endowments were entrusted—is consequently considerably less uniform than the society depicted in much of the brahmanical and courtly literature from the first half of the second millennium, especially in texts composed in the Sanskrit language. To be sure, the dharmatastra lawbooks do not advocate the same behavior for the entire population, since different classes of people were held to different standards. Nor does the legal literature ignore local variations in custom, which were accepted as legitimate within a circumscribed sphere. But local norms were accommodated only within the larger context of the brahman project to extend their authority over an increasing number of local communities (Lariviere 1997). Despite the presence of divergent voices within the texts themselves (Olivelle 1999), the dharmaSastra tradition consistently propagated the preeminence of brahmans and tended to suppress any contrary evidence. Historical uniqueness and particularity is even more successfully shrouded in royal Sanskrit biographies, which highlight the patron's resemblance to exemplary kings of the past. While greater variation can be glimpsed in the vernacular compositions of medieval court poets, even here we find the same cast of characters as in the older Sanskrit dramas and poems. Inscriptions, on the other hand, offer a more diverse group of actors who are engaged in a greater array of activities and exhibit a broader spectrum of beliefs.24 Perhaps even more important, inscriptions provide specific contexts of time and place that are lacking in many literary texts from the medieval period. Because the dominant Indian intellectual tradition adopted the model of the eternal character of religious truth for all forms of knowledge, it was largely unconcerned with the historical present or even with the notion of historical change (Pollock 1985, 1989). Instead it generally looked to the past, when truth and virtue had been more fully manifested in the world. This is why medieval court poets cast their royal patrons in the mold of bygone heroes and reiterated the ancient stories of the gods. It also explains why medieval dharmatdstra commentators seldom acknowledged that\n\nA History in Transition\n\n13\n\nauthoritative texts might differ in opinion because they were composed at different times. Not only did medieval literary narratives frequently adopt a timeless scenario, but also the geographic location and date of these texts can seldom be pinpointed. In contrast, inscriptions capture and preserve discrete moments in time by their very nature as records of specific events. They are almost invariably dated and are generally situated where they were originally placed, usually on the walls or structural columns of a temple building or on a stone slab or pillar within the temple grounds. With inscriptions as our guide, therefore, a range of human agents and their diverse actions inevitably occupy the foreground of our historiographic gaze, within a definite geographic and temporal setting. Because inscriptions are materially embodied records of practice, we can analyze them much in the manner of archaeological artifacts. 25 Inscriptions can be plotted on a space and time grid, not only individually but also en masse. A corpus of inscriptions can thus be compared to an archaeological assemblage, the total array of material artifacts found at one site or from one era. Like archaeological assemblages, sets of inscriptions have properties that pertain only to their entirety— properties like their chronological distributions or locational patterns. Inscriptions also resemble archaeological artifacts in that the sum of the whole is greater than the individual parts, because connections between components are revealed when, and only when, the entire complex is analyzed (Neustupny 1993: 26). When the multiplicity of inscriptions is collectively examined, we can therefore discern relationships that would not be visible otherwise. I exploit this advantage provided by inscriptions, using their patterns of distributions as a gauge of various cultural practices and as a basis for extrapolating related trends. In other words, historical processes can be tracked through the medium of inscriptions in a way that is not possible with medieval literary sources. Only because inscriptions are material objects whose texts comprise a large enough body of information and have a sufficient degree of variability can this kind of historical analysis, in aggregate, be conducted. Unfortunately, our methods of studying Indian inscriptions for historical research are still unsystematic and undeveloped when compared to archaeological methodologies for dealing with artifacts. We have yet to establish even the rudimentary dimensions of the epigraphic phenomenon in most regiqns and dynastic eras of medieval India—that is, roughly how many inscriptions exist and when and where they were produced.26 Until the 1960s, inscriptions were mainly read in order to build a chronological framework for non-Muslim dynasties, and so only the regnal dates and political events mentioned in them interested scholars. More recently, information relating to the functioning of temple institutions, the role of religious patronage, and the nature of political structures has also been extracted from the epigraphic record and occasionally subjected to statistical analysis. Some of these recent efforts, however, tend to sift through a mass of inscriptions in the quest for a single set of variables (certain terminology, for instance) or a narrow range of issues. If done too mechanically, this approach could isolate and objectify phenomena, a common criticism of quantitative methods in the social sciences.27 In advocating the aggregate analysis of inscriptions, therefore, I do not simply mean that we should examine large numbers of inscriptions. That is valuable, of course, in order to eliminate the obvious errors of ascribing uniqueness to what is\n\n14\n\nPrecolonial India in Practice\n\ncommon or, conversely, interpreting an unusual situation as representative. But it is also of critical importance that an entire body of material be studied for patterns of interrelated phenomena. A case in point is my classification of medieval Andhra temples into two basic types, the major and the minor. Although the primary criterion is the number of endowments received by a temple, a cluster of accompanying variables—the identity of the donor, location of the temple, and nature of the gift object—divide along similar lines. When we find such clusters of traits or interconnected patterns, we have identified an important nexus in the dynamic configuration of people and events that comprised a society. In other words, the subjectivity of a researcher's judgment can be tempered by searching for intertwined features and parallel or intersecting trends. Furthermore, in organizing information drawn from inscriptions, it is important to apply categories that were meaningful to the people under study. Insofar as possible, I have therefore classified people in medieval Andhra society and polity by the titles and terms they themselves employed, instead of applying a preconceived model of sociopolitical structure. In this way we can minimize another widespread objection to quantitative approaches, that their classificatory schemes merely reflect the researchers' suppositions and have no empirical or conceptual validity. A good example of the distortions that can result from the imposition of a predetermined set of categories is the information compiled on caste by the British censuses in India (Cohn 1984; Pant 1987; Pederson 1986). They are virtually useless for anything other than an analysis of British conceptions of Indian society, since the Indian subjects could only identify themselves in ways that made sense to their British questioners. Yet it is inevitable that some of our own categories will be imposed on the material and that some phenomena revealed in inscriptions will be misinterpreted. It is impossible for any scholar to transcend entirely the parameters of our modern conceptual framework and understand the medieval world solely on its own terms. Moreover, a certain simplification and reduction is inherent in any attempt at formulating higher-order generalizations about the historical record. Unless we restrict ourselves solely to microhistorical analyses or \"thick\" descriptions, we are inevitably creating abstract models of reality that suppress its complexity and ambiguity. But the drawbacks of an aggregate approach to the analysis of medieval Indian inscriptions are far outweighed by the problems with its alternative—the cut-and-paste method wherein isolated pieces of inscriptions are cited to support whatever thesis the researcher desires. Given the paucity of other types of source material for the period and the corresponding need to extract the maximum out of the relatively copious inscriptional corpus, it is irresponsible to reject aggregate methodologies outright. Instead, I hope to demonstrate throughout this work that a context-sensitive and systematic aggregate analysis of inscriptions can yield questions and conclusions that are both relevant and reliable. Since inscriptions are not only material artifacts, they should also be comprehended through a more culturally oriented approach, one that concerns itself with \"the production of meaning rather than the dispersion of objects\" (Chattier 1988: 59). The tangible physical presence of inscriptions can easily dupe the historian into treating them as if they were neutral transmitters of facts from the past to the present. Certainly, the existence of an inscription at a given place\n\nA History in Transition\n\n15\n\nis an empirical fact. And in most cases we can assume that the transaction documented in a stone inscription—the gift of property to a particular temple or group of individuals—did actually occur, because inscriptions were a means of publicly certifying the transfer of property.28 Yet we must not forget that inscriptions are also literary texts of a particular type. Although they record certain past activities of interest to us, they do so in ways that were meaningful and useful to their contemporary audience. Inscriptions, just like medieval court literature, are forms of discourse containing representations of the self and the world. As such, the social and political aspirations they embody must be recognized along with the ideology they convey. We can review the inscription written on behalf of the horse-doctor Vasudeva, to expand on this point. Preceding the previously translated Telugu lines are two verses in Sanskrit, which run: Salutations to the gurus! Salutations to (the god) Rameshvara! In the Shaka year enumerated as the months of the sun, the arms, and the eyes [1222 = 1300 C.E.],29 on the first lunar day of the bright (fortnight) in the month of Jyeshtha, a Friday, when auspiciousness prevailed; the best of men called Vasudeva—who is the son of Ananta Arya, knows the Ayur Veda of horses, and is the repository of all good qualities— gave a lamp, like the day in brilliance, to (the form of the god) Shiva (known as) Kshirarameshvara. Vasudeva Arya—who excels in serving the feet of his mother, is the son of Ananta Arya, is praised by the discerning, whose desires are fulfilled through worshiping (the god) Shankara, whose head is forever cleansed with water from the lotus feet of brahmans—gave a lamp, with joy, to the lord of Kshirarama town in order to illuminate the world. This inscription of two verses to the lord Kshirarameshvara was composed by his son-in-law, Bhairava Suri. This introductory Sanskrit portion of the inscription adds no information regarding the endowment to what the Telugu lines tell us in greater detail. Many scholars would entirely overlook them, finding such nondocumentary sections of inscriptions tedious and inconsequential (Pollock 1996: 242—43). Yet these verses serve a purpose—to highlight the donor and his allegedly good qualities. In this instance the rhetoric is uninspired and repetitive, but it attempts (rather feebly) to portray Vasudeva as a medically knowledgeable brahman. When all the social clues are read together, however, the inscription suggests that the status of a veterinarian was actually ambivalent. Vasudeva may use the scholarly brahman title Pandita, claim to be a member of the brahman Atreya clan (gotra), and even have a relative who can compose Sanskrit of a sort, but were he unequivocally accepted as a brahman, he would not need to express piety toward brahmans in general. Even this modest example illustrates how inscriptions can be fruitfully read for their representations of the social world and a person's place within it, an approach that is common among literary scholars but largely ignored by historians of medieval India. Because inscriptions are cultural products, I place much emphasis on the ways in which social and political identities are constructed within them—the heroic epithets, titles of ranks, and names borne by individuals, as well as the language that expresses political affiliation. For the same reason, I pay far more attention to the eulogistic portions of inscriptions than do other historians of\n\n16\n\nPrecolonial India in Practice\n\nprecolonial India. The individual attributes of donors or their overlords that are praised, the collective symbols that are manipulated in praising them, the kind of genealogical information about the donor or king's family that is narrated—all of these aspects of the inscriptional pratasti (eulogy) indicate what was valued in the literate culture of medieval Andhra. Wherever possible, 1 also try to consider the interests served by inscriptional representations, as strategies for promoting the self as much as reflections of how people thought. I have not taken more than a small step forward in the formulation of a methodology for the cultural analysis of inscriptions. The study of inscriptional rhetoric and style is virtually in its infancy, and much more consideration is needed regarding the conditions of inscriptional production and their intended audiences. My intent is to alert readers to the possibilities and suggest how we might more imaginatively consult inscriptions as historical sources. In short, inscriptions are a rich mine of information for a period of Indian history that is often thought to lack historical source material. To be sure, the non-Muslim elites of medieval India did not produce much in the way of standard historical writing—no \"annals,\" as James Mill noted. But we have ample documentation in inscriptional form which can greatly enhance our historical understanding. Inscriptions cannot, of course, tell us everything we would like to know about medieval India, for they provide us direct entry into only one sphere of human activity—religious patronage. Nor can all strata of medieval society be witnessed in inscriptions, since only the relatively privileged could make a religious endowment or discharge one. Because of their \"fragmentary\" nature, inscriptions should be supplemented by other contemporary sources whenever these are available (Narayana Rao, Shulman, and Subrahmanyam 1992: 31). Indeed, ideally one should use both inscriptions and literary texts to explore the Indian past since both were cultural products that could shed light on each other (Walters 1997: 161). Whatever their deficiencies, however, inscriptions are a resource of unparalleled value for the methodical study of past practices and past processes, due to their sheer abundance. Although the religious gift made by Vasudeva Pandita may not have endured as long as the sun and the moon, in the very act of recording it he and the others like him in medieval Andhra who commissioned inscriptions have left behind a rich legacy for posterity.\n\nPlan of the Book Because the history of medieval Andhra is a history of transition, different chronological parameters are adopted here in order to best capture the various dimensions of its vitality. The broadest perspective is taken in chapter 1, which examines the distributions of Andhra inscriptions during the long span of time from 1000 to 1650 C.E. within the context of its political history and physical environment. In tracking the changing localities of epigraphic production over time, other long-term processes are highlighted: the gradual demographic movement toward the interior territories, the consequent shift of political power away from the coast, and the increasing salience of a Telugu cultural identity that spanned\n\nA History in Transition\n\n17\n\nthe lowlands and uplands. This overview of inscriptions provides the most dramatic illustration of the degree of change that occurred in the medieval period. By treating the making of inscriptions as a demonstrable and measurable cultural practice, it also uncovers a clear correlation between high levels of epigraphic production and the existence of strong polities. The temporal focus is narrowed in chapters 2, 3, and 4 to the years from 1175 through 1324, the time span when the Kakatiya polity flourished and the largest quantity of inscriptions were produced. Each of these chapters focuses on a different facet of the expansionistic and vigorous world of Kakatiya Andhra that is revealed in inscriptions: the society in chapter 2, temple worship and patronage in chapter 3, and polity in chapter 4- Chapter 2 presents a social typology of class derived from inscriptional titles, and ultimately based on occupation, which was by no means fixed or rigid. In a period and place where opportunities for economic or political advancement and occasions for physical mobility were widespread, I argue, social identities fluctuated according to individual action and effort. Patronage of temples was one means through which new social identities and communities were formulated and chapter 3 takes a closer look at this as well as other consequences of religious endowment in the Kakatiya era, including the expansion of agricultural productivity and the strengthening of political ties. The practice of religious giftgiving not only diverged significantly from the norms laid out in Sanskrit literature but also varied considerably between the upland and lowland subregions because of their different developmental trajectories. The great achievement of the Kakatiya dynasty was the uniting of these two subregions into one overarching polity, a process that is carefully plotted in chapter 4- In analyzing both the strategies of the rulers and the changing composition of their network of subordinates, I advance an interpretation of medieval polity and political culture that emphasizes its heroic values and militaristic foundations more than previous scholarship has. Chapter 5 looks retrospectively at the Kakatiya era from the vantage point of later times. Rather than trying to reconstruct the past directly via the medium of inscriptions, here I ask how subsequent generations of Andhra people transmitted and appropriated memories of the Kakatiyas and their period. Since the ways in which the Kakatiya past were made meaningful to Telugu society over time is the topic, I consult literary texts and early colonial accounts along with inscriptions. The concerns and methods of this chapter hence represent a departure from those of the earlier portion of the book. Through this comprehensive analysis of the historical traditions pertaining to a single Indian dynasty, I compare indigenous perceptions of the Kakatiya period's significance with my own interpretation. Additionally, I am able by this means to illustrate the vigor of precolonial India's historical imagination, which creatively recast the past in light of the changing circumstances of the present. Thus, as the regional society of Andhra continued to develop, so too did its sense of its own past as a community continue to evolve.\n\n1 Andhm's Age of Inscriptions, 1000-1650\n\nAlthough stone inscriptions can be found in various areas of the subcontinent from the third century B.C.E. onward, they were most abundantly produced in South India between approximately 1000 and 1650 C.E. As a cultural practice, therefore, the production of inscriptions is most characteristic of the medieval South. The large number of stone inscriptions issued throughout South India in these centuries visibly differentiate it not only from North India but also from both the classical South Indian society that preceded it and the early modern South Indian society that followed. The era of epigraphic efflorescence is thus a distinct phase in South India's development, and I have chosen the period from 1000 to 1650 as the chronological focus for this chapter on that basis, in a deviation from the common practice of identifying eras of Indian history solely on the basis of political factors. The most notable feature of the age of inscriptions is, of course, the impulse to document religious gifts in a permanent form, for the great majority of stone inscriptions are records of substantial religious endowments. But this practice is in turn an index for a complex configuration of socioeconomic processes and cultural meanings. The rising popularity of the religious patronage of gods and brahmans is testimony to the spread of a pan-Indie culture that valued the expression of piety in such forms. The flurry of epigraphic activity was also predicated on economic development, however, for without an expansion of the agrarian base it was not possible for numerous localities to support temples and brahman villages. And, as explained in the discussion that follows, surges in state formation stimulated the production of inscriptions. By tracking the proliferation of the material artifact that is the stone inscription, we can trace the trajectories of a number of interrelated historical processes. Hence the aim of this chapter is to establish when and where inscriptions were issued within Andhra during the 650-year period from 1000 to 1650, so that we may better understand the overall developments in this age of inscriptions. Implicit in my methodology is the assumption of a meaningful correlation between the distribution of inscriptions and the occurrence of other societal trends. There are some problematic features of this assumption, I admit. Since only inscriptions that have survived the vagaries of weather and changes in political control over the past 18\n\nATuihra' s Age of Inscriptions, 1000-1650\n\n19\n\nfew centuries are included in the corpus, we cannot assume that the current distribution of inscriptions is an exact reflection of the conditions in earlier times. It is quite probable, for instance, that a higher percentage of inscriptions once existed in northern interior Andhra (Telangana), which has often been under Muslim hegemony since 1323. The capital of the Kakatiya kingdom, Warangal, was attacked repeatedly after the fall of the dynasty and many inscriptions have undoubtedly been lost at the site of the original Kakatiya fort. Furthermore, many of the Kakatiya-period temples in Telangana are no longer living temples in the sense that they no longer house images that are actively worshiped (Wagoner 1986: 145-46). We may speculate that other abandoned temples were dismantled and their components used for building new structures, in the course of which valuable inscriptions would have been lost. Another potential distortion arises from the process of epigraphic collection. Agencies of the government of India, and more recently of the state government of Andhra Pradesh, send out teams to gather ink rubbings of inscriptions, but these teams go on tour for short periods only and concentrate on areas where inscriptions are known to exist. New findings are still being reported today and the end is not in sight. Due to the unsystematic nature of the collection process, there may be an uneven pattern of surveyed localities with inscriptions in the relatively sparsely settled interior being overlooked But in view of the length of time that has passed since collection of inscriptions was begun, it seems unlikely that the figures are significantly skewed on this account.1 The best way to compensate for variables that may have differentially affected the survival of inscriptions is to collect as many inscriptions as possible. The larger the overall pool of sources, the better the chance it will resemble original distributions. I have made every effort, therefore, to be exhaustive in my collection and analysis of epigraphic sources.2 The results should not be construed as definitive, nor do I claim any such status for them. But even a rudimentary sketch of the broad contours of Andhra epigraphic distributions is a great advance, given our current state of ignorance. At the minimum, it allows us to make some basic comparisons between Andhra and other areas of South India as well as to differentiate subperiods within the 650 years under consideration. At best, the surveying of inscriptions enables us to trace the progression of a series of dynamic and intertwined processes: agrarian settlement, the assimilation of tribal and pastoral peoples, and the emergence of an Andhra variant of a pan-Indie civilization. I begin the chapter with a brief sketch of Andhra's geography and history prior to 1000 C.E., to provide a backdrop for the subsequent examination of inscriptional distributions in the 650 years after 1000. Only once the temporal and spatial dimensions of inscriptional distributions have been fully explored do I proceed to the issue of what we can infer from the patterns of epigraphic occurrence—that is, the factors shaping Andhra's age of inscriptions.\n\nPhysical Environment and Early History The two most important environmental variables differentiating localities within Andhra are the elevation of land and the amount of rainfall. Because the Deccan\n\n20\n\nPrecolonial India in Practice\n\nplateau on which Andhra is situated tilts gently down in an easterly direction, the elevation gradually lessens as one traverses Andhra from the interior toward the coast. The undulating peneplains of the uplands of western Andhra range between approximately 1,000 and 2,000 feet in height, gradually decreasing to between 500 and 1,000 feet midway across the state (map 2). Intersecting this west-to-east drop in elevation are the Eastern Ghats, which run northeast to southwest through the state. Many geographers prefer the term Eastern Hills to describe this broken series of hills and ridges that do not form a continuous chain. Considerably lower than the Western Ghats, the Eastern Hills range from about 4,000 feet in the north to between 1,500 and 3,000 feet in the south, where several sets of hills can be differentiated, including the Nallamalas, Palkondas, and Velikondas. The Eastern Hills are breached in the middle by a wide deltaic stretch formed by the Godavari and Krishna Rivers. This deltaic area extends as far as 50 miles inland and constitutes the core of the coastal lowland region, the last major type of terrain in Andhra. North and south of the Krishna-Godavari River delta, the coastal lowlands are considerably narrower. 3\n\nMap 2. Elevation and Major Rivers in Andhra\n\nAndhra's Age of Inscriptions, 1000-1650\n\n21\n\nMap 3. Districts of Andhra Pradesh Unlike the elevation of terrain that diminishes from west to east, rainfall contours in Andhra run in a north-south direction. Generally speaking, the highest amounts of rainfall are to be found in the northeastern districts, decreasing gradually to the southwest (Raychaudhuri et al. 1963: 1). Andhra north of the Krishna River receives the bulk of its precipitation during the southwest monsoon period between June and September, whereas southern Andhra gets most of its rain from the retreating or northeast monsoons from October to December (Vasantha Devi 1964: 18). Based on annual rainfall amounts, three basic zones can be distinguished within Andhra. The zone of heaviest rainfall, which receives between 40 and 45 inches annually, comprises the northern coastal districts, as well as a few of the northern interior districts (Adilabad, Nizamabad, and Khammam—see map 3 for location of districts). Less favored is the moderately dry zone of 30 and 40 inches of annual rainfall, encompassing some of the southeastern districts (Guntur, Nellore, and Chittoor) and several districts in the northwestern interior (Karimnagar, Medak, and Hyderabad). Less than 30\n\n22\n\nPrecolonial India in Practice\n\ninches of rain fall in parts of central Andhra (Mahbubnagar, Nalgonda, Warangal, and Prakasam Districts) and in southwestern Andhra (Anantapur, Kurnool, and Cuddapah districts)—the latter being the driest zone in Andhra.4 The southwestern districts are arid because they lie in a rainshadow region reached by neither the southwestern nor retreating monsoons (Vasantha Devi 1964: 18). Proximity to sources of water is critical for agricultural production in Andhra, due to the general paucity of rainfall. Unfortunately, most streams dry up during the hot season, since they are rain-fed in contrast to the snow-fed rivers of North India. One example is the Penner or Pinakani River (map 2), which enters Andhra in Anantapur District and flows through Cuddapah and Nellore Districts, with a total length in Andhra of approximately 350 miles. The intermittent character of most rivers accentuates the importance of the Krishna and Godavari, the only two perennial rivers in the state. Rising in the Western Ghats of Maharashtra, the Godavari flows through Andhra for almost 500 miles. Once past the upland region where it often forms narrow channels, the Godavari broadens out to a width of 31/2 miles around the town of Rajahmundry and splits into five branches. The Krishna River also originates in Maharashtra but enters Andhra from Karnataka state and flows another 384 miles. At Vijayavada city, about 45 miles inland, the Krishna crosses a low ridge and then spreads out into a delta, splitting into three main branches. Since ancient times canal irrigation has drawn on the steady supply of water from these two major rivers but was practical only in the lowlands, where the rivers broadened and slowed before emptying into the Bay of Bengal.5 Besides benefiting from the accessibility of perennial water, the coastal lowlands were blessed with the most fertile soils in the state. The alluvial soils of the Krishna and Godavari River deltas, periodically renewed by silt, are richest in plant nutrients. Older alluvium containing less organic matter is found along the coast both north and south of the deltas. Somewhat less fertile are the black soils derived from lava flows and characteristic of the upper Deccan. In Andhra deep black soils exist primarily along the northern border of the state or where they have been introduced by rivers. Deposits of shallower black soil are also located in pockets in the southern portion of the state. Because of its high clay content, black soil is very moistureretentive and can be used to grow crops like cotton without the need for irrigation. Most of Andhra, however, is covered with the less fertile red soils that developed in situ from the underlying peninsular bedrock. Almost 70 percent of the total area of the state has these red soils, which are highly permeable and of limited fertility without a regular and copious supply of water.6 Because of its agricultural productivity, the zone encompassing the Krishna and Godavari River deltas has been identified as the most crucial locale in Andhra, its \"core\" area. Core areas, alternatively called \"nuclear regions,\" are defined by geographers as \"bases of power which are perennially significant in Indian historical geography\" (Spate 1954: 148). Proximity to water, enabling intensive agriculture and thus denser populations, was a fundamental feature of nuclear regions. But other factors such as ease of travel also played a part in determining where the earliest historic settlements would emerge. In Andhra, urban centers first developed in the lower Krishna River valley, rather than around the Godavari. Since a large part of the Godavari's course (from Khammam District westward) is through a\n\nAndhra's Age of Inscriptions, 1000-1650\n\n23\n\ndensely forested and faulted trough, it was avoided by travelers who instead sought the wide opening of the Krishna River's passage through the hills (Geddes 1982: 86). By the early centuries C.E., plow cultivation and irrigation were widespread in the lower Krishna valley and two major urban centers emerged at Amaravati/ Dharanikota and Nagarjunakonda. Other locales within the larger Krishna-Godavari delta soon joined the lower Krishna valley in developing denser settlements and producing historic source materials. Geographer David Sopher has remarked that where a culture core is spread over a broad territory with little change in physical environment, there is a tendency for centers of power to shift around (1962: 122). We witness this trend in Andhra from the fourth through sixth centuries, as several minor ruling families established their capitals outside the lower Krishna valley, although still within the Krishna-Godavari deltaic region. Among them were the Salankayanas of Vengipura, generally identified as the modern Peddavegi village near Eluru in West Godavari District, roughly midway between the Krishna and Godavari Rivers (Gopalachari 1941: 167). The city of Vengi retained its importance in succeeding years as the capital for three centuries of the long-lasting Eastern Chalukya rulers. The term Vengi gradually developed several other referents: Vengi-vishaya or Vengi-mandala designated the region surrounding the capital, while Vengi-desha and Vengi-nadu denoted the Eastern Chalukya kingdom (Mangalam 1979-80: 101). The entire deltaic region extending between the Krishna and Godavari Rivers was also often referred to as Vengi. By the last few centuries of the first millennium, the broad expanse of the Krishna-Godavari deltas had thus been established as the nuclear zone or core area of Andhra. Even today, the subregion of Andhra Pradesh known as Coastal Andhra (map 4), which includes the Krishna and Godavari deltas, is the most populated and wealthiest portion of the state. Historic settlement proceeded at a much slower pace outside of coastal Andhra. Less suited for the intensive agriculture of wet rice cultivation, the interior portions of Andhra—Telangana in the north and Rayalasima in the south (map 4)—have hosted pastoral lifestyles since prehistoric times. Neolithic peoples left behind clear evidence of their cattle-raising in the form of huge ash-mounds, marking the sites of ancient stockades where cattle dung accumulated and was burnt off. Almost all of the ash-mounds have been found within a specific ecological zone in northern Karnataka and western Andhra, a semiarid region receiving less than 25 inches of annual rainfall (Allchin 1963; Murthy and Sontheimer 1980). The societies of the Iron Age were also based in the dryer upland expanses of the region, covered with poor savanna scrub. The Iron Age Pandukal culture, named after its distinctive \"megalithic\" burials, lasted from about the third century B.C.E. to the second century C.E. Its sites in Andhra are concentrated in the interior districts, as well as in the upland taluks (subdistricts) of Guntur (Leshnik 1974 and 1975). During the second half of the first millennium C.E., historic sources begin to appear in the interior. Minor local dynasties like the Renati Cholas of Cuddapah District and the Vaidumbas of the Cuddapah-Chittoor border figure in inscriptions from Rayalasima, whereas in Telangana most inscriptions were issued by people affiliated with the imperial dynasties of Karnataka. But far less is known about the early history of Rayalasima and Telangana than of coastal Andhra.\n\n24\n\nPrecolonial India in Practice\n\nMap 4. Andhra Subregions The only significant indigenous polity in Andhra prior to 1000 C.E. was that established by the Eastern Chalukyas beginning in 642. For the remainder of the first millennium C.E., the Eastern Chalukyas continued to control portions of coastal Andhra from their base in the fertile area of Vengi. But the extent of their territories and the degree of their independence fluctuated greatly, depending on the strength of polities based elsewhere in the peninsula. The Eastern Chalukyas initially faced little threat from the outside, because they were a junior branch of the powerful Badami Chalukyas of Karnataka. After the Badami Chalukyas were overthrown by the Rashtrakutas in the mid eighth century, however, Andhra was no longer insulated from interregional struggles for power. It soon became a contested zone between polities based in the Western Deccan and those in the far south. For much of the era of Rashtrakuta dominance in Karnataka (753-973 C.E.), the Eastern Chalukyas were either their acknowledged subordinates or were struggling to keep them at bay. Andhra also suffered from numerous campaigns on its territory fought by the Rashtrakutas and the Tamil power to the south (first the Pallavas of\n\nAndhra's Age of Inscriptions, 1000-1650\n\n25\n\nKanchipuram and later the Cholas of the Kaveri River delta). In 973 C.E. the Rashtrakutas were replaced as the dominant Karnataka dynasty by the Chalukyas of Kalyani, but the basic pattern of northwest-southeast conflict in the peninsula persisted and armies from other regions continued to fight over Andhra.\n\nDistribution of Andhra Inscriptions Andhra's age of inscriptions began slightly later than in the neighboring regions of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, for the rise in the number of Andhra inscriptions does not begin until midway through the eleventh century. High rates of inscriptional production were reached by the early twelfth century in Andhra and were maintained, with some fluctuations, until the seventeenth century.7 The two centuries yielding the largest quantities of inscriptions are the thirteenth and the sixteenth, coincidentally also the eras when strong polities existed in Andhra—the Kakatiya, in the case of the former, and Vijayanagara during the latter. Breaking down the 650-year span of time under consideration into century-long units would make our analysis of inscriptional distributions unwieldy, however. Instead, I have chosen to subdivide the age of inscriptions into four smaller units or subperiods corresponding roughly with changes in Andhra's political situation. This is not only less complicated than using century-long units of time but also enables us to gain a better perspective on the Kakatiya period from 1175 through 1324, the topic of the following three chapters. Moreover, as discussed in the pages that follow, dividing the entire time period into four smaller units reveals a correlation between epigraphic production and political stability: the Kakatiya and Vijayanagara states reached their zeniths during the same periods when the greatest number of inscriptions were issued. The first of our (smaller) periods of analysis comprises the years from 1000 through 1174—in other words, from the commencement of the age of inscriptions until the era of Kakatiya hegemony. The time span when the Kakatiya dynasty rose to paramount status within Andhra constitutes the second period, from 1175 through 1324- The third period spans the years 1325 to 1499, and the fourth period encompasses the remainder of the age of inscriptions, from 1500 through 1649, when the Vijayanagara state was most closely involved with Andhra affairs. Table 1 displays the number of dated inscriptions issued during each of these periods Table 1.

Both the Kalyani Chalukyas and the Cholas sought to dominate coastal Andhra by backing competing contenders to the Eastern Chalukya throne. A brief interlude of peace was ushered in when Kulottunga I, a Chola on the maternal side and an Eastern Chalukya on the paternal side, ascended the Chola throne. During the reign of this famous ruler (1070-1122), there was a strong Tamil presence along the Andhra coast, where several of Kulottunga's sons acted as viceroys. Shortly before Kulottunga's death, rivalry between the Kalyani Chalukyas and the Cholas resumed. The Cholas were assisted by small Andhra princely families situated along the coast, most importantly the Velanati Chodas. Andhra chiefs of the interior, on the other hand, fought in coalition with the Kalyani Chalukyas. As incessant warfare weakened the once mighty imperial Chola and Chalukya dynasties, these minor Andhra princes and chiefs began to act in an increasingly independent fashion. By approximately 1160, the Velanati Chodas assumed their own imperial titles. One of the main chiefly lineages of interior Andhra was the Kakatiyas, who declared their independent status in 1163. Period II (1175-1324) marks the rise of the Kakatiyas to a hegemonic position within the region. Beginning from their base in northern inland Andhra, the Kakatiyas gradually built up a political network that at its height encompassed roughly two-thirds of the territory within the modern state. While the Kakatiyas were forced at times to repel invading armies, they were never subjugated by any other South Indian polity, unlike the Eastern Chalukyas. The good fortune of the Kakatiyas resulted from the division of peninsular India in this period into four regional kingdoms that were equally balanced in power—the polities commanded by the Yadavas or Seunas of southern Maharashtra and northern Karnataka, the Hoysalas of Mysore, and the Pandyas of the Tamil country, in addition to the Kakatiyas of Andhra. Armed incursions of the Delhi sultanate disrupted the peninsular balance of power beginning in the late thirteenth century and eventually brought about the collapse of all four regional kingdoms. The Kakatiyas survived several earlier sultanate campaigns before succumbing in 1323, when their capital Warangal was captured and their political network destroyed. Period III (1325—1499) began in a time of great turmoil, when existing political networks were entirely overthrown. Several new Telugu warrior lineages managed\n\nAndhra's Age of Inscriptions, 1000-1650\n\n27\n\nto carve out small areas for themselves during the second half of the fourteenth century, although they always had to contend with threats from polities based outside Andhra. By the early fifteenth century, however, these Telugu chiefdoms had largely disappeared and their place was taken by more powerful, and nonindigenous, states. One of the outside polities was the Bahmani sultanate of Gulbarga and Bidar, founded in 1347, who now dominated large portions of western interior Andhra. The Vijayanagara kingdom of southern Karnataka, whose establishment is traditionally dated to 1336, controlled much of southern interior Andhra. Another strong power—the Gajapatis of Orissa—entered the fray around 1450 and seized the coastal strip of Andhra. In the last 50 years of the period, Andhra witnessed constant vacillations in the balance of power (and territory controlled) between these three kingdoms. In the first half of Period IV (1500-1649), all of southern Andhra was incorporated into the Vijayanagara kingdom. The greatest of all Vijayanagara kings, Krishnadeva Raya (r. 1509-1529), launched a sustained campaign against the Gajapatis who were thereby pushed back into northern Andhra. The Vijayanagara kingdom now comprised a contiguous stretch of territory extending from the Western Ghats in Karnataka to the Andhra coast south of the Krishna River in the east. Meanwhile, the Qutb Shah dynasty broke off from the Bahmani sultanate and displaced the Gajapatis as the dominant power in northern Andhra by the 1530s. The most momentous event of Period IV occurred in 1565, when the Vijayanagara capital was sacked by a coalition of Deccani sultanates. The Aravidu dynasty of Vijayanagara retrenched within its native southern Andhra territory, and a brief resurgence of glory occurred during the reign of Venkata II (r. 1586-1614). Thereafter, however, Aravidu power waned rapidly and by 1650 most of Andhra was under the hegemony either of the Adil Shah kingdom of Bijapur (in Karnataka) or the Qutb Shah kingdom of Golkonda and Hyderabad. How do the tides of political fortune I have just narrated correspond to the production of inscriptions? Period I (1000-1174) can be summed up as a politically unstable era lacking a dominant political configuration, a time when Andhra was recurrently enmeshed in the larger power struggles of the peninsula. Fewer Telugu inscriptions were issued during Period I than in any other, but even the inclusion of non-Telugu inscriptions gives Period I only a ranking of second from the lowest in number. In marked contrast, Period II (1175-1324) was characterized by the sway of one polity, the Kakatiyas, for much of the time. Period II is unusual both in its political unity and in the fact that the paramount power was an indigenous dynasty. It yields both the largest numbers of Telugu inscriptions and of all inscriptions added together. During Period III (1325-1499) Andhra once more experienced much political disturbance. The overall number of inscriptions issued during Period III is even lower than in Period I. This must be attributed at least partially to the destabilization of the region caused by the incursions of the Muslim armies from the North. It is difficult to explain the sharp drop in epigraphic levels after the fall of the Kakatiyas otherwise, particularly when we see that epigraphic levels rebound in Period IV. That is, once the age of inscriptions was inaugurated, we might expect to see a slow increase in inscriptions as long-term trends such as agricultural expansion\n\n28\n\nPrecolonial India in Practice\n\ngradually unfolded, if no other factors were involved. But rampant political instability and specifically the absence of a powerful polity encompassing large portions of Andhra seem to have adversely affected epigraphic production. The Vijayanagara empire never controlled as much territory within Andhra as did the Kakatiyas, nor was Vijayanagara strength in Andhra as long-lasting. But Period IV (1500-1649) was an era of political unity for southern Andhra, especially prior to 1565. Although the Vijayanagara polity was originally based outside of Andhra, during the sixteenth century it became increasingly Telugu, in terms of both its military personnel and political culture. After the destruction of the Karnataka capital in 1565 and the subsequent withdrawal of the Vijayanagara kings to bases within Andhra, Vijayanagara became a solely Telugu enterprise. In this way, Vijayanagara after 1500 can be viewed not as a foreign kingdom but as an indigenous Andhra polity. These similarities between the Kakatiya and Vijayanagara eras may explain why Period IV yields almost as many records as Period II, in a remarkable resurgence from the low levels of epigraphic production found during Period III. Although inscriptions continue to be issued at a modest rate in subsequent centuries, Andhra's age of inscriptions was well nigh over by the seventeenth century. Scholars of Tamil Nadu have similarly observed a substantial drop in inscriptions once Vijayanagara's power had been sharply curtailed (Narayana Rao, Shulman, and Subrahmanyam 1992: 89; Ludden 1985: 70-71). The continuing scarcity of inscriptions throughout South India after 1600 seems to reflect a fundamental transformation that transcends the correlation between political scale and epigraphic production. It may be that the rates of demographic and agrarian growth had leveled off throughout the peninsula, after four centuries of escalation. Aside from such economic causes about which we can only speculate, we also have firm evidence of a change in patronage patterns. In the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the preferred object of religious gift was no longer land, nor a herd of milk-bearing animals, nor even lump sums of cash to be invested. Instead, the kings and chiefs of post-Vijayanagara South India favored the ostentatious feeding of gods and brahmans (annadana.), an ephemeral form of religious charity that was not permanently documented on stone. The growing liquidity of the early modern economy, which was highly monetized and commercialized, has been correlated with this shift in religious practice (Narayana Rao, Shulman, and Subrahmanyam 1992: 67—72).13 The ending of the era of copious epigraphic documentation thus corresponds to a momentous change in the political economy of South India and represents the transition from a medieval to an early modern world. We have established a clear correspondence in medieval Andhra between the presence of strong polities and high levels of epigraphic activity, yet the reasons for this phenomenon have not yet been explored. Extensive royal patronage of temples is not the answer"
