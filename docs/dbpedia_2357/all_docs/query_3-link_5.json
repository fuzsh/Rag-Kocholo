        "text": "Belur Halebidu is the second in line of our world-heritage UNESCO Karnataka series. Before assuming that I am on a world heritage roll;Hampi was a planned trip, Belur Halebidu was not. Happening to be in Chikmaglur, getting back to Bangalore seemed to be a bad idea without covering Belur Halebidu, a mere 30 kms away. (The roads defy physics; few things in life come close to riding an already battered Activa on roads fit for trekking). The temples at Belur made up for the bone rattling ride.\n\nWanderlust Bonus #1:Gokarna, Karnataka: Lazy Beaches, Fort Ruins and Mysterious Rocks\n\nBelur\n\nA proposed UNESCO World-Heritage, the Chennakesava temple at Belur is considered to be one of the highlights of the Hoysala rule in India. The temple was more far more intricate than the ones at Hampi. (It lacked the old-world rustic charm and preservation of Hampi, though).\n\n[caption id=”attachment_4232\" align=”aligncenter” width=”1024\"]\n\nThe Chennakeshava temple at Belur[/caption]\n\n[caption id=”attachment_4231\" align=”aligncenter” width=”1024\"]\n\nThe exterior sculptures at the Chennakeshava[/caption]\n\nThe black granite, perfectly round pillars were something I noticed for the first time in Belur. (They became a norm later as I progressed to Halebidu and the other temples at Belur.) The bracket figures were intricate. (The guys building these must have had some patience!)\n\n[caption id=”attachment_4230\" align=”aligncenter” width=”1024\"]\n\nInside the ChennaKeshava temple[/caption]\n\n[caption id=”attachment_4228\" align=”aligncenter” width=”1024\"]\n\nAt Belur[/caption]\n\n[caption id=”attachment_4229\" align=”aligncenter” width=”1024\"]\n\nOne of the idols at Belur[/caption]\n\nThere are three temples in total at Belur: the Chennakeshava temple, the Kappechennigaraya temple and the VeeraNarayana temple.\n\n[caption id=”attachment_4240\" align=”aligncenter” width=”1024\"]\n\nThe KappechenniGaraya Temple[/caption]\n\n[caption id=”attachment_4241\" align=”aligncenter” width=”1024\"]\n\nThe Veeranarayana Temple[/caption]\n\nHalebidu\n\nHalebidu is to Hoysala what Vitthala is to Vijayanagara. You know you are in for a treat when you see a sign quoting Percy Brown declaring Halebidu to be the supreme climax of Indian architecture. (No clue if he had been to the rest of the country’s historic marvels as well, but yeah, close enough!)\n\nWanderlust Bonus #2: Khokari Tombs: Jewels of the Konkan\n\nWith perfectly lined pathways, and lawns surrounding the temples, it is evident ASI is doing its bit to attract tourist worldwide to this UNESCO world heritage site. That’s the difference between Hampi and Halebidu; Hampi retains the old world charm; except for the few tar roads and the odd electricity pole, it’s hard to assume you are in the 21st century and in the midst of a world famous tourist spot. Halebidu, on the other hand, with its manicured lawns, peddlers trying to sell you guidebooks and shops selling knickknacks right outside the temple complex, your journey back in time gets a rude jolt the moment you step out the temple gates.\n\n[caption id=”attachment_4239\" align=”aligncenter” width=”1280\"]\n\nEntry to the Spectacular Hoysaleshwara Temple[/caption]\n\n[caption id=”attachment_4226\" align=”aligncenter” width=”1280\"]\n\nThe Hoysaleshwara Temple[/caption]\n\nThe Hoysaleshwara temple at Halebidu is the pinnacle of the Hoysala dynasty’s prowess in architecture. This (below!) was a figurine at the entrance!\n\n[caption id=”attachment_4234\" align=”aligncenter” width=”768\"]\n\nThe figurine at the entrance (Look at the detail!)[/caption]\n\nThe roof of the Hoysaleshwara temple is marvelous.\n\nRandom tip: Every time you visit archeological monuments in Karnataka, look up!\n\n[caption id=”attachment_4227\" align=”aligncenter” width=”1280\"]\n\nA section of the roof at the Hoysaleshwara temple[/caption]\n\nThe granite pillars are back again…\n\n[caption id=”attachment_4233\" align=”aligncenter” width=”768\"]\n\n(Check out the Bracket figurines)[/caption]\n\nThere are two massive monoliths of Nandi at Halebidu. Thankfully, a barricade has been put up to prevent idiots from trying to proclaim their everlasting love. (The damage is evident).\n\n[caption id=”attachment_4236\" align=”aligncenter” width=”1280\"]\n\nOne of the Nandi Monoliths at Halebidu[/caption]\n\n[caption id=”attachment_4235\" align=”aligncenter” width=”768\"]\n\nThe other Nandi at Halebidu[/caption]\n\n[caption id=”attachment_4237\" align=”aligncenter” width=”768\"]\n\nThe Ganesha at the exit of the Hoysaleshwara temple [/caption]\n\nHalebidu has a Kedareshwara temple (a stone’s throw away from the Hoysaleshwara).\n\n[caption id=”attachment_4238\" align=”aligncenter” width=”1280\"]\n\nThe Kedareshwara temple[/caption]\n\nBelur Halebidu is around 220 kilometers from Bangalore. A weekend trip is ideal to cover both in exquisite detail.\n\nPhoto Credits: All pictures have been clicked by the author. You can read his travel experiences in details here."
