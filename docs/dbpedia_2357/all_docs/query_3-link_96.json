Is History Wrong?\n\nAn ancient temple at Bali called the ‘Pura Dalem Jagaraga Temple’ has some very strange carvings. It shows airplanes, bicycle, cars, guns, and other modern things. However, locals say it was built 800 years ago. How does this Indonesian temple have carvings of modern vehicles? Did ancient builders do Time Travel? Or did they use their Psychic Ability? Or, are the carvings new?\n\nCommunity gathering at Nuanu, BALI\n\nHey Guys, Today, I am giving a presentation about ‘Ancient Temples of Indonesia’ at Nuanu City in Bali! It starts at 7 PM Indonesian time. See You There ❤️❤️\n\nSpread the Awareness🙏\n\nhttps://youtu.be/YUBvlrzJUHY\n\nOur New Video has been ‘Age Restricted’ within one hour of publishing. We filed an appeal immediately. And even that appeal was rejected within 15 minutes. YouTube is constantly suppressing videos about the glory of Ancient India. Please spread this post to raise awareness 🙏\n\nDid Ancient Indians Pioneer Surgery 10,000 Years Ago?\n\nThe Prambanan Ramayana – Episode 6\n\nThis episode of Prambanan Ramayana concludes in a very contrasting way. Even if you know The Epic Ramayana well, you are going to be surprised. The unseen carvings of Lava and Kusha are depicted on the walls of Prambanan temple will blow your mind. Did Rama find his sons and reunite with the love of his life? And also, is Valmiki a character in this?\n\n#Prambananramayana #praveenmohan #ancienttemple #Indonesia\n\nWhy Are Hindus Blind With Superstition?\n\n𝐋𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐇𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐮 𝐓𝐞𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐈𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐚 – 𝐏𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐛𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐧 𝐓𝐞𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞\n\nPrambanan Temple – an impossible Hindu structure built in Indonesia 1200 years ago.\n\n𝐌𝐀𝐘𝐀 – 𝐃𝐀𝐑𝐊 𝐒𝐄𝐂𝐑𝐄𝐓𝐒 𝐎𝐅 𝐇𝐈𝐍𝐃𝐔 𝐓𝐄𝐌𝐏𝐋𝐄𝐒\n\n–Praveen Mohan\n\n𝐖𝐇𝐀𝐓 𝐓𝐇𝐄𝐘 𝐅𝐎𝐔𝐍𝐃 𝐔𝐍𝐃𝐄𝐑𝐆𝐑𝐎𝐔𝐍𝐃 𝐂𝐀𝐍 𝐍𝐄𝐕𝐄𝐑 𝐁𝐄 𝐑𝐄𝐕𝐄𝐀𝐋𝐄𝐃\n\nHey guys, today we are going to look at a very mysterious structure in a small town called Adalaj.\n\nIn the middle of the roads, houses, and trees, what is that strange Lingam shaped structure? Is this is a secret government organization or an underground bunker? No. This is a historic structure known as the Adalaj Ni Vav. Almost perfectly aligned along the North – South axis, its design is totally unique. It does not have an entrance on the North side at all, and no entryways in the center of the structure as well. But on this side, it has 3 entrances with steps, in three directions, right to next to one another. Why was such a unique architecture built many centuries ago? What are these three octagonal structures on top?\n\nNow, let’s get on the ground and try to get a closer view. This is a very surprising structure, because nothing is visible from the ground level. Usually, I show you structures starting from ground level and going up. In this one, we start from the ground level and we are going to go down. Yes, this is an underground structure, but you know how many levels, how many floors go underground? It goes five stories below, it has 5 different levels. What do experts say about this structure? Experts call this the Adalaj Step well, and It was designed with 2 separate wells to provide water to the public. A giant structure with so many levels and carvings just to provide water? But there is an even more weird claim. Wikipedia calls this an Indo – Islamic structure meaning that the structure was built by both Hindus and Muslims? How is this possible?\n\nWe have come more than 75 feet deep and we have reached the bottom most level of this structure, and you can see this circular well. It looks remarkably simple, seems to be about 12 feet in diameter, and just 30 feet deep. There are steps radiating on all four sides to help people access water from all sides. Is this well, really the primary purpose of building this vast 5 storied underground structure?\n\nAs you can see, there seems to be nothing else here, so let’s go back up and look at the other details. No. Wait, what about the second well, I told you there are 2 wells here, right? Where is the second well? Let us go past this first well, and see if we can find it. After we go past the first well, there is another structure. And you can see a narrow entrance here, it is just 2 feet wide. It is so narrow that only one person can go through. And here, we can see the secret, second well. It is smaller than the first well, and it is also less deep. If you look carefully into the well, you can see the bottom, it is probably less than 15 feet deep. Why would anyone build 2 separate wells right next to one another? I mean they are for the same purpose, to drink water, right? Today, imagine you are building a house, would you dig 2 separate wells, or put 2 bore wells, right next to each other? This would be like putting 2 separate entrances in front of your house, nobody does it, because there should be no use for this. But the original builders must have a had a valid purpose for this, and we cannot understand what it is. Why is this well hidden from public view?\n\nAnd see here, very fascinating carving – 2 kissing fish. What do they mean? I have repeatedly shown you carvings like this, they indicate the presence of ground water underneath, and here we see it directly in the walls of the well. And look at the walls, you can see the shallow rectangular chambers – 3 chambers specifically. Inside these chambers, you can find carvings of Hindu Gods. And each chamber would be visible from one floor. Why did they put these carvings and chambers in this wall? What is the real reason for building such a fantastic, 5 storied structure? As we come out of the second well, you see.. this area between these 2 wells is completely covered. Look carefully, do you see anything strange?\n\nNow, from this side of the first well, look at the architecture carefully. There are no dome shaped arches, this looks like a typical Hindu architecture. They put large pillars on the sides, and had very wide rectangular passages. And notice the pillars. The pillars are not made of bricks, they are not plastered, they are made of giant sandstone blocks.\n\nBut now, let us go to the opposite side of the same well, and look at the other side. This is shocking, because it is a completely different architecture. These are Islamic doorways, with those typical curves and arches. They are not made of giant stone blocks, they are all made of bricks, and they are covered with plaster. This is a typical muslim construction, that you see in a mosque. So on one side, you see a Hindu architecture, and on the other side we see a Muslim architecture. Who really built this structure – Hindus or Muslims?\n\nTo understand this, let us explore this place and try to analyze some of its carvings. On top, you can see the classic Islamic style. There are symmetric Minars. There is this large minar on the left side, on the other side, again, there is an identical large minar. Right next to it you can see this tower, and again you can see an identical minar on the other side as well. And you can see this 3rd minar, on both sides. This kind of symmetric alignment of Minars is found in Mosques not only in India, but also around the world, so it is clearly a Muslim style of carving.\n\nBut right below this, you can see that this gets even more confusing. You can see these elephants, and you can also see horses. And you can see other animals like Yali, very typical of Hindu carvings and what’s even more interesting, you can also see carvings of human beings. Muslims are not allowed to carve humans or animals, because they do not want idol worship. These animals, especially the Yali is very typical of Hindu structures. And you can see this Yali, carved in many places in this structure, and you can also see the bells hanging at the end of chains in many places all over the structure. Bells are also forbidden in Islam.\n\nSo who built it – Hindus or Muslims? Hindus started the construction and almost near the end of the construction, Muslims took over the structure. And Muslims finished the rest of the structure. This is why archeologists call it an Indo-Islamic structure. But how did they both co-operate and complete this ancient structure? Because in my channel I have shown you several ancient temples that have been destroyed by Muslims, right?\n\nBecause the Adalaj Stepwell is not a true ancient structure. Now normally, I don’t show you any structure that is not ancient, I show you structures that are built 800 years or older. But the Adalaj Step well is only 525 years old. In India this falls into a timeline called medieval history, not ancient history. Why did Hindus and Muslims combine together and create the structure?\n\nBecause times are slowly changing at this point. In the ancient timeline, Muslims were foreign invaders who came from a different country, they could easily dehumanize the Hindus as “inhuman or infidels”, because they had never seen this culture. But in the medieval times, Muslim rulers were born here and they grew up watching Hindus side by side, so they were not foreigners and they somewhat adapted to Hindu culture, and Hindus also adjusted with them.\n\nBut who started the construction, what did they originally worship? Locals say the construction was started by a queen by the name of Ruda Devi. And she worshipped a deity called Bhageshwari, who is carved on that floor.. let us go take a look at this deity. Today, Goddess Bhageshwari is worshipped as an idol in many Indian states, but how was she depicted 500 years ago? As we reach this area, we are surprised. We see a massive lion like animal, It looks brilliant and it is shown with one limb up in the air. If you look at its face, you are not reminded of a lion, it looks more like the extinct saber-toothed tiger. It is adorned with a bell on its neck, but do you see this Trident in the background? It is a very interesting depiction, it is not clear if the Trident is simply placed in the background, or if the trident has pierced the lion. But there is another stunning detail, there are 2 eyes carved between the prongs of the trident, creating a face like appearance. This is an amazing carving with so many, mystical, hidden details. Look at the small metal trident here, you can see the fresh flowers right next to it, this means they are still worshipping this carving everyday, a ritual that is ongoing for many centuries. But where is Goddess Bhageshwari? Look at this area, this part has been deliberately destroyed. Let me try to re-create this with photoshop. You can clearly see that she is standing and petting the lion’s face with one hand. This could be the Goddess Bhageshwari, shown as a powerful deity and carved petting a massive lion. Or maybe the face that is created inside the trident represents her. Both these depictions are quite different from today’s idols of her.\n\nBut look at this figure. What is this? Is it a dinosaur? A large, stout body, thick legs and a very long neck? Or, are we having a distorted view of the carving, because it is destroyed? At the bottom you can see these elephants on both sides, let me show you a closeup of one pair and let’s see what we can find. You see this large bell like object in the center? And if you look carefullly you can also see the small bells attached to them. But you see these weird things here, look at these patterns. Why are they carved on these elephants? What is the meaning of these patterns?\n\nCloseby, there is another carving. It looks similar to the previous carving, but instead of the trident, see what is there? Yeah that same pattern, this is a type of knot. Why is it carved in this important place? Why are they performing rituals on it, even today? What is its meaning? You can see the bells with chains on both sides, and also on the animal’s neck. But there is something very strange about this animal. At least that one looked like an extinct lion like species. This one looks totally different. It has a very different face, it has a curved snout, and look at those bulgy eyes. Is this one of the horns, it seems to be curved like the horns of a ram. However, it does have a mane like that of a lion and you can also see that its body and legs are similar to a lion. What animal is this? Is this some type of a prehistoric extinct animal? Again, at the exact same area, you can see something has been deliberately demolished. What is it? Is it the ancient Hindu Goddess Bhageshwari? But there is yet another strange figure here. Look carefully, is this a dinosaur? We know of these large plant eating dinosaurs like sauropods. Did the original builders carve dinosaurs? If this is not a dinosaur, What other animal could this be? It has 4 legs, so it is definitely not a bird, what animal looks like this?\n\nThis site is full of many strange, unexplained carvings hiding in deep, dark areas. This is where the secret information lies. Here you can see something that looks just like meaningless flower patterns. But look carefully, you can see an insane amount of knots. In the outer circle, you can see 8 knots, and in the inner circle, you can see 4 knots. What is the meaning of this carving? All over this structure, you can see the same knot carved in the most obscure places. Why?\n\nIt is normal to see carvings of various deities in Hindu structures and floral designs in Islamic structures. But in this structure, you see some very strange, mystical patterns.\n\nLook at this one, a very odd carving with a lot of details. Inside is a flower, with some petals, and surrounding that, we can see gear like teeth, then and you can see the radiating patterns on all directions. And you can see three chains connecting a jar at the bottom. There are 4 bells carved around it. Very interesting carving, But what does it mean?\n\n, you can see the floral work commonly known as Jali in India. you can find similar carvings in many Mosques and Muslim structures. And this is intricate stone work because this entire panel is carved out of a single stone, and it needs a lot of work. You can insert your finger inside, and it comes out the back. So imagine the amount of work needed to create these carvings. Some claim that these are mystical Sufi symbols. And look at this one, I know this one looks the same as the previous one I showed you, but this one has 2 chakras at the top and bottom, and the previous one did not. Some call this an Islamic mystical symbol but local Hindus claim that this is Kalpavriksha or a divine tree.\n\nI hope you liked this video, because I have never shown you an Indo-Islamic structure, you can see the change in the mindset, where Hindus and Muslims are adjusting to each other. And you see the these 2 stoneworks side by side. While the Islamic Invaders who came a 1000 years ago, would have completely demolished these carvings, the Muslims in Medieval times adjusted to it, and even completed the structure. While ancient Hindus would have completely abandoned the structure, if Muslims took over a place, medieval Hindus continued to visit and use it and even performed rituals or pooja, which continues to this day.\n\n–Praveen Mohan"
