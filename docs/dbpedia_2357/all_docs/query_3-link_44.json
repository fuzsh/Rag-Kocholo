        "text": "Kantha Embroidery\n\nA household craft practised by women from West Bengal and Bangladesh, kantha ‚Äì derived from the Sanskrit word kontha, or ‚Äúrags‚Äù ‚Äì embroidery is applied on quilts, bags and other textiles made from reused fabric. Although kantha embroidery originated in undivided Bengal through the influence and patronage of Portuguese traders in the region, it can be traced to the sixteenth century text Chaitanya Charitamrita by Krishnadas Kaviraj, in which the titular character receives a textile made with old fabric from his mother. Apart from being used as a warm blanket or bed covering, kantha textiles can be adapted to a variety of purposes depending on the size and thickness. The style varies between regions, and to some extent even between households, as embroiderers are encouraged to apply their aesthetic to each quilt. The raw material for kantha quilts is usually old sarees and dhotis in a single solid colour. These are cut to size and stitched into several layers depending on the intended purpose of the resulting textile. When the borders of the saree are detailed and decorated, they are repurposed as borders of the quilt and the threads used for embroidery are extracted from the sarees as well. In some cases, the embroidery is thick and closely stitched, making both sides of the textile appear identical. While the designs differ between the various styles of kantha, they are all typically done with a running stitch and use motifs such as flowers, vines, mangoes, swastika and Tree of Life symbols. Except Lep kantha, all kantha textiles have intricate borders and a large lotus motif in the centre. The running stitch is the basic building block of most designs; other stitches have been included through the influence of the changing textile market during the colonial rule such as cross-stitch, satin stitch, back stitch and herringbone stitch. Design elements derived from the choice of stitch include anaras (pineapple), wave-like lohori running stitch and the geometric par tola representing triangular kautar khupi and diamond-shaped borfi. Kantha embroidery made by Hindu women contains human and animal figures while Muslim women traditionally depict geometric patterns and repetitive floral imagery. Broadly, there are eight kantha traditions that vary based on usage, stitch and imagery: Nakshi kantha, a quilt produced mainly in Bangladesh carrying natural imagery with large floral motifs in each corner and accompanied with a border; Sujani kantha is a large blanket embroidered in cross stitch with scenes from Indian epics or folk stories at the centre and a border with geometric patterns; Arshilata kantha is used to cover handheld mirrors, combs and cosmetics, usually bearing floral motifs around a mandala; Durjani kantha is a bag made by stitching together three corners of a square textile; Bayton kantha is a square cloth for wrapping books and is designed in a mandala format with a Satadala Padma design in the centre surrounded by motifs from Indian mythology and deities; Lep kantha is a thick quilt made with several layers of cloth and embroidered with floral and geometric motifs in a wave-like pattern; Oaar kantha is a pillowcase with a distinct border along the edge and embroidered with natural motifs in lines of running stitches; and Rumal kantha is a handkerchief with decorated borders and a lotus motif at the centre. While kantha has historically been a household tradition in rural Bengal ‚Äì the textiles primarily being given as gifts or used by the embroiderer‚Äôs family ‚Äì it has attracted a significant market in recent years. The craft received encouragement from Revivalist artists at Shantiniketan (now Visva-Bharati University) in the 1940s, and again in the 1980s through Shamlu Dudeja‚Äôs organisation Self Help Enterprise (SHE) which incentivised women to practise kantha embroidery commercially. In Bangladesh, a renewed interest in Nakshi kantha has been attributed to artist and designer Surayia Rahman. Today, its distinct running stitch designs are often used to embroider sarees and blouses, although such garments are made with a new cloth material and in many cases are produced in states without an established kantha tradition, such as Gujarat and Rajasthan. Kantha embroidery continues to be popular, providing a significant income to many practitioners.\n\nJakanachari\n\nInitially credited as the architect and sculptor of several temples in the Karnata Dravida style of architecture, Jakanachari is today considered to be a mythical figure. Instead, scholars believe that the name may represent an artisan guild that was active between the tenth and thirteenth centuries in present-day Karnataka, when the region was under the rule of the Western Chalukya and Hoysala dynasties. While it is unclear when the myth of Jakanachari originated, the name is documented in colonial reports of temples in the Deccan region. There are several popular legends associated with Jakanachari. He is believed to have been born in Kaidala, a village in Tumakuru district, Karnataka, India. According to one legend, he left his home in search of work, leaving behind a pregnant wife. Several years later, while Jakanachari was working on a sculpture to be installed in the complex of the Chennakeshava temple, Belur, a young man ‚Äî eventually revealed to be his son, Dankanachari ‚Äî spotted a flaw in his work. When the flaw was revealed, the dejected master artisan cut off his right hand. He later had a vision in which he received an instruction to build a temple to Vishnu in his village; his hand was restored once the temple was consecrated, with the village gaining the name Kaidala, meaning ‚Äúrestored arm‚Äù. Another myth claims that Jakanachari‚Äôs skill allowed him to build temples in a single day. Some scholars suggest that the name Jakanachari may have been derived from the terms dakshinacharya or tenkanacharya, meaning ‚Äúsculptor of the southern region/or of the south.‚Äù Others have suggested that the roots of the name can be linked to the term yaksha. The likelihood that Jakanachari was a mythical figure has been largely based on the construction dates of three Hoysala temples that Jakanachari is credited with having worked on: the Chennakeshava temple in Belur, the Hoysaleshvara temple in Halebidu and the Chennakeshava temple in Somanathapura. While the first two temples were built in the early twelfth century, the temple at Somanathapura has been dated to the mid-thirteenth century, making it extremely unlikely that any artisan could have worked on all three temples. Further, given that Western Chalukya and Hoysala temples spanning nearly three centuries are associated with the Jakanachari legend, it is likely that the term referred to a guild of artisans who worked on temples of the Karnata Dravida style during this period. This guild and eleventh-century artisans such as Dasoja may have been integral to the adoption and evolution of the style under Hoysala patronage. It is also notable that there is no epigraphic evidence of Jakanachari in the form of inscriptions at a time when several master artisans working on Hoysala temples inscribed their signatures on their images. The myth of Jakanachari has been repeatedly depicted in popular culture in Karnataka, notably in the film Amarashilpi Jakanachari (1964). In 1995, the state government of Karnataka instituted the Jakanachari Award, which is conferred on master sculptors and artisans of the state.\n\nRuvari Mallithamma\n\nKnown to have worked over a span of more than sixty years during the thirteenth-century, Ruvari Mallithamma is considered to be one of the most prolific and important sculptors who worked for the Hoysala court. His inscribed signatures attest to his contribution to a large number of Hoysala temples in present-day Karnataka, India, notably the Chennakeshava temple, Somanathapura. While he gained particular recognition for his work on Vaishnava temples and developed an expertise in their iconography, his contributions to Shaivite temples are also known. The details of Mallithamma‚Äôs early life are obscure as his signatures did not provide biographical details such as place of birth, unlike those of some of his predecessors and contemporaries, such as Dasoja and Chavana. Based on an inscription mentioning a figure named Mallithamma, dated to the reign of the Hoysala ruler Someshvara (r. 1235‚Äì63), some scholars suggest that the sculptor may have been from a place called Panchajanya in present-day Hassan district, Karnataka. However, it remains unclear whether the inscription refers to the sculptor. The earliest project he is associated with is the Amruteshvara temple, Amruthapura in present-day Chikmagalur district, Karnataka, dated to 1196. Here Mallithamma worked on the the mukhamandapa or front hall, constructed some years later around 1206, carving ceilings of the central and southern parts and the northern doorway of the structure. The next dated structure attributed to Mallithamma is the Lakshmi Narasimha temple, Haruvanahalli (now Haranhalli, in present-day Hassan district, Karnataka), where he worked on sculptures, friezes and scroll ornamentation on the northern side of the temple and at the base of the main cell. The friezes include depictions of yakshas, yakshis, horsemen, elephants and makaras. His signature is found on several Vishnu images on the site as well as on sculptures of Sankarshana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Garuda and Lakshmi. Around 1237, he sculpted two dvarapala, or door-guardian, images for the Shaivite Panchalingeshvara temple, Govindanahalli (present-day Mandya district, Karnataka), although he was likely not extensively involved in the temple. In the 1240s, he contributed to the Lakshmi Narasimha temples at Nuggehalli and Javagal, both in Hassan district. At Nuggehalli, as at Haranhalli, Mallithamma worked on the northern side of the temple, as well as a section on the western side, sculpting images of Indra and his consort Sachi, as well as various forms of Vishnu. At Javagal, he worked on the southern section. At both these sites, he may have undertaken the role of a supervisor in addition to sculpting images. He also worked on the Kedareshvara temple, Nagalapura around the same time. Mallithamma‚Äôs most significant project was the Chennakeshava temple, Somanathapura, which was completed around 1268. He worked on the north tower of the temple, creating sculptures and friezes depicting scenes from Ramayana and Mahabharata, forms of Vishnu such as Janardana, a figure of a dancing female deity and an image of Mahishasuramardini. Scholars suggest that by the time he began work on the temple, Mallithamma may have been a renowned artist not only among his peers but also among Vaishnavite patrons in the region, for his contributions to Vishnu temples and his familiarity with Vaishnavite iconography. Therefore, it is likely that he was invited to work on the temple by its patron Somanadannayaka. By this time, however, Mallithamma is likely to have been too old to create the sculptures himself, and his contribution to the temple may have involved designing the sculptures and leading a workshop of artisans to execute them.\n\nChhau\n\nA folk performance form that incorporates martial arts and dance-drama elements, chhau is performed in the states of Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal. Each state has distinct styles of chhau ‚Äî Seraikela chhau in Jharkhand, Mayurbhanj chhau in Odisha and Purulia chhau in West Bengal. Chhau performances originally took place during the spring festival of Chaitra Parva in April, which celebrates the deities Shiva and Shakti in the Ardhanarishwara form. Over the last few decades, it has begun to be performed throughout the year. The origins of the word ‚Äúchhau‚Äù are debated. Possible sources include the Odia words chhauni (military camp), chhauka (checking something stealthily) and chhauri (armour), suggesting that it may derive from military practices. Another possibility is that the word is derived from the Sanskrit word chhayi, meaning shadow, illusion or image, referring to the use of masks in some forms of chhau. The Odia words chhabi (picturesque), chhai and chhatak (clowning) have also been suggested as possible origins. Until the end of the twentieth century, only men would participate in and perform chhau, but women performers have become more visible since. These individuals are organised into troupes, which move in search of work. Mayurbhanj and Purulia chhau are performed primarily by members of Scheduled Castes, whereas Seraikela is primarily performed under royal patronage by men from the Kshatriya (warrior) caste. Chhau emphasises footwork and the movement of the entire body, rather than mudras. Instead, chhau performers‚Äô hands are held tightly in fists or kept open, imitating the grasping of a sword and shield. Instruments typically used include the mahuri (a conical double-reed pipe), dhol (a percussion instrument), nagara (a large drum played with wooden sticks), dhumsa (a kettle shaped single headed drum), and chadchadi (a flat percussion drum). The narratives of chhau are borrowed from Puranic texts, and epics such as the Mahabharata and Ramayana. A single performance generally lasts for about forty-five minutes to an hour, and includes different episodes or stories. If multiple troupes are performing, such as during a village festival, performances last for four or five hours. The performative repertoire consists of stylised movements to depict action only through the feet, known as uflis, as well as nature-inspired bodily movements depicting animals and birds, known as challis and topkas. Other standard movements include the baagh chaali (tiger walk), mayur chaali (peacock walk) and khel (variations on ufli and swordplay). The forms are not derived from a text, with the traditions and forms passed on generationally within troupes. Chhau troupes may be grouped into overarching schools within the three broad regional styles.These include Uttara Sahi and Dakshin Sahi within Mayurbhanj chhau, and Bazar Sahi and Brahmin Sahi for Seraikala chhau. All three styles of chhau are believed to derive their movement elements from the martial arts practice of parikhanda, wherein pari denotes shield and khanda denotes sword. A distinguishing feature between the styles is the use of masks. Both Seraikela and Purulia chhau incorporate masks in their performances, whereas Mayurbhanj chhau does not. This means that Mayurbhanj chhau uses both facial expressions and bodily movements to express emotion in dance drama sequences, while Seraikela and Purulia chhau emphasise bodily gestures as the performers‚Äô faces are covered with masks. Seraikela and Mayurbhanj chhau both received considerable royal patronage over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which impacted their performative repertoire. Purulia chhau, in comparison, retains influences from the martial arts from which chhau may derive. As a dance form, Seraikela chhau is deeply influenced by its usage of masks which constrain the movement of the performer. It thus emphasises subtle movements of the neck (known as grieve bheda) and the head (siro bheda). Though light, the mask makes it difficult for the performer to breathe and thus restricts the length of a typical Seraikela chhau to no more than ten minutes. The basic stance is known as dharan, wherein the knees are bent and both feet turned outwards with the left foot in the front. The body weight typically rests on both legs. Seraikela chhau is usually practiced in solo performances, with some duets and troupe performances. Though most of the performers are men, eighteen of the standard thirty-six feet movements in Seraikella chhau represent the everyday routines of women. Some popular dances within this style dances include ratri (night), depicting a playful game between the moon and the night; sabar (hunter), in which a hunter is depicted waiting for his prey; mayur (peacock), wherein the dancer evokes the bird through elaborate neck and upper body movement; astra danda (martial art movements) and Radha-Krishna (playful dance representing the god Krishna and his consort). Seraikela chhau gained immense popularity under the aegis of Kumar Bijay Pratap Singh Deo of the Seraikela royal family, who choreographed and performed this style of chhau in a form that has continued to the presentas it is recognised in its present form. He also promoted the form internationally by taking the chhau dancers for a tour to Europe in 1938, cementing its contemporary position as one of Jharkhand‚Äôs foremost performing arts. It was under his patronage that women first began to perform chhau, joining his troupe on their Europe tour; women have been part of Seraikela chhau troupes since. Purulia chhau incorporates acrobatic and energetic movements accompanied by elaborate masks representing gods and demons from Hindu mythology. The narratives tend to focus on episodes of combat from the Puranas, depicted using athletic skills. Popular dances include Mahishasura Badha, depicting the defeat of the demon Mahishasura by the goddess Durga and Ravana Badha, a duel between Rama and Ravana characterised by the use of high-pitched sound and vigorous movement. The performances typically begin with a song to Ganesha, followed by a rousing call to action for the dancers. Purulia chhau is traced to the work of the twentieth-century dancer Gambhir Singh Mura, who contributed significantly to the choreography and forms that the dance is recognised with today. Mayurbhanj chhau divides its performative elements into movements depicting birds and animals, along with thirty-six feet movements. The execution of these movements, however, differ from Seraikella chhau. Mayurbhanj dancers adopt the basic stance from the tribhangi (standing position) from Odissi, with the body weight resting on one leg. The dancers also emphasise their upper body movements more than in Seraikella chhau. The movements can be categorised into three types ‚Äî Kalibhanga or delicate, lyrical movements; Hatiyardhara or forceful, masculine movements and Kalikata, which combines the two. The absence of masks in this form allows for more acrobatic movement. Some significant dances include the solo dance Nataraja, represented by dancers from the Uttara Sahi tradition, depicting the god Shiva. The Dandi dance is performed by dancers from the Dakshina Sahi tradition, and is based on the Upanayana or sacred thread ceremony. Mayurbhanj chhau traces its origins to the masked Ram-Leela performances of the Baripada district in Odisha, and also incorporated influences from the Seraikella chhau. Scholars have also suggested similarities to ritualistic dances by the Santhal community, a tribe residing across much of east-central India. During the reign of Maharaja Jadunath Bhanja in the mid-nineteenth century, one Madan Singh Bapu from Baripada combined music from Ram-Leela with that of chhau. Master performers Upendra Biswal and Banamali Das were then brought into the region to train dancers, leading to the creation of the two schools of Uttara Sahi and Dakshin Sahi. After the annexation of princely states in the region following the independence of India, royal patronage ceased, adversely impacting Mayurbhanj chhau. The state government of Orissa (now Odisha) extended patronage to chhau from the 1950s by establishing annual grants and through the establishment of training centres. Chaitra Parva, the spring festival, generally includes chhau performances in Odisha, and many Chaitra Parva celebrations receive state support as well.The Sangeet Natak Akademi runs special training centres for chhau dancers. Chhau was recognised as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2010.\n\nKalaripayattu\n\nBelieved to have originated in the third century BCE, kalaripayattu is an armed martial art used for self-defence and is indigenous to the state of Kerala. Kalaripayattu is composed of two words, kalari means ‚Äúplace of combat‚Äù and payattu means ‚Äúfighting‚Äù in Malayalam. Practitioners of the art form credit the Hindu saint Parashurama with founding the art form and consider him to be its first teacher or gurukkal. Broadly, the art-form is divided into four stages with each stage including a technique, and the form does not follow a grading system that ranks students on the basis of seniority. The first stage, the meipayattu, involves various stretching exercises and jumping movements. The next stage is kolthari, where students are taught fighting techniques with the use of sticks. The wooden sticks, known as kettukari, are usually thin bamboo poles measuring six feet long. Other wooden weapons used in this stage include the viada (two-headed club), cheruvati (short, heavy stick) and lastly the ottakol (curved wooden weapon, with a club at one end). In the angathari stage, weapons made of unbending metal are used including the kattaram (dagger for duels at short range), sword and shield. The last stage, verumkaiprayoga, involves instruction in fighting without tools or weapons. Several of these movements are modelled on animals such as the horse, serpent, rooster or tiger, amongst several others, inspired by the forests of Kerala that form a vast part of the state‚Äôs landscape. Additionally, there are mainly two main styles of kalaripayattu: vadakkan or the northern style predominant in the Malabar region which emphasises graceful body movements and the weaponry and the thekken or the southern style, practised mainly in the Travancore region, involving free armed techniques and movements. The training normally begins with an oil massage that is seen as an important part of the training of the art form, followed by prostration in front of the teacher and deities installed at an altar in the western corner of the kalari, known as a puttara. The number of deities can vary between seven and twenty-one. The main goddess of kalari is considered to be Bhagavathi, a form of the goddess Durga, and Para Devathai, a god that embodies both Shiva and Parvati. The kalari usually measures 21 feet by 42 feet and is an enclosed pit that is covered on all sides. When not located within the house, it consists of a roof made of palm leaves supported with a bamboo frame. This provides it with an airless atmosphere that is considered suitable for training. The training of Kalaripayattu also includes training students in ayurveda (ancient Indian medicine and healing system) and in locating the 108 vital points of the body, known as marma, which could be used in combat. The practice of Kalaripayattu has traditionally been passed on to students through vaythari or the oral commands, but it was only in 1936 that these oral instructions were written down and published followed by more descriptive writing starting around 1953. Art forms such as theyyam, parichamuttu, poorakkali, poikali or vela kali, have been inspired by movements of kalaripayattu. The Indian Kalaripayattu Federation (IKF) was established in 1995 to promote the art form and it conducts state-level competitions, national championships and the National Kalaripayattu Festival.\n\nGatka\n\nA form of self-defence that developed in the Undivided Punjab region, gatka is an armed martial art that uses a wooden stick. The word gatka comes from the Sanskrit word gatayas or motion, but in Punjabi, the word refers to a short wooden stick, called a gatka, used in practice and combat, which is why the martial art form is also known as gatkabaazi. Gatka is often performed during celebrations or festivals such as Baisakhi or Gurpurab with decorated sticks. Though traditionally practised in grounds known as akharas, training of the martial art form is also imparted in gurudwaras. Scholars speculate that gatka is likely to have been established by the sixth Sikh guru, Guru Hargobind, who introduced the kirpan (dagger) for self-defence. Other accounts narrate that it was originated by Muslims and that the gatka was made out of the branch of a date tree. During British rule, the popularity of the martial art form reduced considerably since it was banned along with the kirpan and the neja (javelin) for the fear of rebellion and uprisings. During this period, the art form was secretly practised within akhadas, mostly in rural areas. The training begins with learning the paintara, meaning footwork, or more broadly, the strategy for engagement. This is followed by an instruction of the weapons beginning with open-handed combat (bahu yudh) and a stick made of bamboo, known as marahati. In addition to this other weapons used in the art-form include, chakra (a round weapon with little wooden balls), soti (a long wooden stick), tega (a long and broad sword), tabar (axe), guraj (mace), barchha (spear), and the khanda (double-edged sword). Of these, the combination of the gatka and phari (shield) is the most common, followed by the kirpan and dhal (shield). The Dasam Granth dictates the usage of the weapons in gatka. The weapons may be classified by their use into mukata weapons ‚Äì to be used either by hand or released from machines like the catapult or bow ‚Äì and amukata weapons which are held in the hand. These weapons are placed either in the kamarkasa (cummerbund) or within the dastar (turban). The weapons of gatka are often worshipped before combat through a shastra puja, where the weapons require to be arranged in particular formations; a popular one resembles a lotus flower. Following this, the weapons are offered salutations through the shastra namaskar. The Dasam Granth also provides invocations that may be made during training and displays. These are often chanted or performed along with war drums such as the dhol or nagara. Apart from Punjab, gatka is also practised in parts of Afghanistan, such as the Hazara division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as well as by Trinidadians of Indian descent. In the early 2000s the martial art went through a revival through organisations such as Gatka Federation of India (GFI) and National Gatka Association of India (NGAI) and is played as a competitive sport nationally. Additionally, in 2013, the state government of Punjab began offering a diploma course in gatka at the Punjabi University, Patiala.\n\nSilambam\n\nOriginating in ancient Southern India, silambam is a form of warfare that involves fighting with a bamboo staff developed for self-defence. The name silambam, comes from the Tamil word silam, meaning hills. This reference to hills may be the reason that the art of silambam was particularly useful in the Kurinji hills to keep wild animals away. The primary weapon used for the art form is a particular kind of yellow bamboo known as silambambu, but other weapons may also include swords, spears, daggers and knives. The origin of silambam is unclear but references to silambam can be found in Sangam literature, for instance in the epic, Silapathikaram. Also, historical references elucidate its use by the rulers of the Chera, Chola and Pandya kingdoms. Most notably the soldiers in the army of the Tamil ruler Veerapandiya Kattabomman, defended their kingdom against the British using silambam. Scholars note that the city of Madurai was an important centre in spreading the art form to other parts of Southeast Asia, Europe and the Middle East and the silambam staff was exported to these parts of the world. Some accounts also state that the shaolin style of martial arts is also a derivation of silambam, and was brought to China by Bodhidharma in 526 AD. The basics of the fight come from its footwork, known as chuvadus, of which there are eighteen types and these are taught to the students before they are allowed to move on to the use of sticks. Unlike other popular stick-based martial art forms, the grip used in silambam is known as a hammer grip (main hand facing down behind the secondary hand that faces up) instead of a poker grip where both hands face down. This, in combination with fast and agile wrist movement and footwork, is seen as the core of this art form. In some cases, along with the stick, a shield made of bamboo or wicker may also be used that is secured on the wrist or forearm. The art form is performed on a circular, hard surface which is 40‚Äì50 feet in diameter. The match can be of three kinds: a duel to the finish, where the first opponent to lose their stick loses; a duel where the participants must guard an object placed at their foot; and lastly, the most popular, where the opponent must try and get the opponent‚Äôs stick to touch them the least number of times in order to win. For the last variant, the stick is laced with a sticky substance that gets left behind on the opponent's body when touched. Since the staff is the most important part of combat, it may vary in length based on the height of the fighter and is approximately 1‚Äì1.25 inches in diameter. ‚ÄúTorch silambam‚Äù or panthukol, where cloth balls are lit on fire, are used by fire dance performers at events or festivals. In another variant, the two opponents have their sticks coated in two different coloured powders and the winner of the combat is determined by the person left with the least marks of colour on their body. Compared to other martial arts, silambam wasn‚Äôt always regularised since it has mostly been passed on through a guru-shishya (teacher-student) system. Recently it adapted the belt system, like karate, where silambam begins with a white belt and ends with a black ‚Äî ash, yellow, orange, green, blue, purple and brown come in between. Additionally in an effort to popularise and promote the martial art form, the World Silambam Federation was founded in 2010 in Chennai.\n\nCarved Stone Dishes from Gandhara\n\nAmong the earliest functional objects found in the Gandhara region of present-day Pakistan and Afghanistan are small carved stone dishes dated to the period between the late second century BCE and the first century CE. Usually made of schist, steatite or phyllite, these plates and shallow bowls are typically between 10 and 15 centimetres in diameter and between a few millimetres and 3 centimetres high. Often divided into two or more sections, the interior of each dish shows a scene carved in intricate relief, with decorative patterns etched along the rim and on the underside. The style and iconography of these images demonstrate the exchanges between Hellenistic, Parthian and Shaka artistic traditions that formed the basis of later Gandharan sculpture. First discovered at the archaeological site of Sirkap near Taxila in the early twentieth century, the stone dishes feature standalone scenes populated by a variety of subjects. Commonly seen are drinking scenes, showing men and women holding wine cups or inebriated people being supported by attendants, as well as mythological creatures and guardian couples depicted as versions of Indic, Greek and West Asian deities. One such artefact held in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York shows an inebriated woman being supported by a man, both wearing wreaths and drapes rendered in a style that suggests the Greek god Apollo and his consort, Daphne. On another dish featuring the couple, Apollo is shown wearing a pointed hat typically worn in the Parthian world. Other dishes depict lotus petals in the interior, a distinctively Indic motif. As with most Gandharan art, there is some ambiguity around the degree of Graeco-Roman influence on these images. While some scholars consider the scenes to be an aspect of the cult of Dionysus ‚Äî and thus a product of Hellenistic influence on Gandharan art ‚Äî others highlight a more indigenous source for the images in the ancient cults of yakshas and yakshis. These spirit figures were considered custodians of amrita, the elixir of eternal life often held in chalices, and were ritually offered meat and alcohol. However, as evident through the mixed iconography of Apollo and the recurrence of Indic floral motifs, the carvers of these images drew on multiple sources and re-interpreted them in a unique visual language, which would have been intelligible to the cosmopolitan audience of ancient Gandhara. While their distinctive style, antiquity and presence in museum collections makes them valuable objects of art in the contemporary world, there has been speculation and debate regarding the original function of the stone dishes. The minimal wear on the dishes as well as their iconography suggest that they were made for ritual rather than utilitarian or ornamental purposes. The division of the dishes into internal sections points to their use for libations and other offerings. However, unlike other Gandharan sculpture, the artefacts have been found in the remains of houses and not of sacred structures, which might indicate that they were used for rituals practised within the domestic context. In all probability, the plates were likely considered luxury goods at the time, partly because of their highly skilled craftsmanship and given their predominant emergence from important urban centres. Speculations about the social structure of Gandharan society also suggest that the Dionysian cult, whose iconography is frequently seen on the plates, was limited to the elite class. Although largely accepted as ritual objects today, they were initially thought of as ‚Äòtoilet trays‚Äô or cosmetic containers based on an interpretation of a relief sculpture from Butkara (in present-day Swat, Pakistan) showing a woman applying makeup from a circular dish. By the 2000s however, this theory was abandoned as none of the artefacts showed traces of the cosmetic pigments or pastes that were found in other containers at excavation sites in Gandhara. The specifics of the dishes‚Äô ritual use, however, have not been conclusively resolved, and it has been suggested that the plates may have been used for Buddhist funerary rituals rather than Dionysian ceremonies. Today the dishes are part of collections across the world, the largest being housed in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\n\nDrinking Scenes in Gandharan Art\n\nRelief panels, carved stone dishes as well as objects such as metal and ceramic cups discovered in the Gandhara region and dated between the second century BCE and third century CE frequently depict banquets with inebriated figures and scenes of revelry. Made under the rule of the Kushan dynasty, these images show men and women holding wine cups, drinking, playing music and dancing. Since these are scenes of merriment accompanying the consumption of alcohol, these images have been referred to as ‚ÄòBacchanalian‚Äô or ‚ÄòDionysian‚Äô, after the Roman and Greek gods of wine and ecstasy, Bacchus and Dionysus, respectively. Such scenes appear carved in relief on the inside of some shallow stone dishes, which are among the earliest sculptural discoveries from the Gandhara region and depict subjects drawn from classical Greek mythology. Initially thought to be ‚Äòtoilet trays‚Äô, they are now understood to have been used for ceremonial rather than functional purposes within the domestic context. The relief panels, which were typically stair-risers to stupas, depict figures wearing Hellenistic, Egyptian and South Asian attires engaged in wine-drinking and merrymaking. The secular theme of these reliefs appears consistent with their placement in what was considered a ‚Äòpolluted‚Äô context ‚Äî one where people stepped on them barefoot. The images on the dishes as well as the reliefs are non-narrative and depict a variety of subjects, including guardian couples, inebriated people being supported by attendants and, in one instance, rows of attendant figures around a man who some scholars interpret to be Dionysus. The central figure in some images is interpreted as Dionysus based on the grapes in his hair or the animal skin he wears, as well as his being offered wine, being flanked by wreathed male figures, or receiving a goat ‚Äî an animal that is ritually sacrificed to him during festivals. Other scholars also consider this figure to be Indra, who was interpreted as a Dionysian figure in the Hellenistic context. The guardian couples have been variously identified as Panchika and Hariti or Ardoxo and Pharro. Wine cups and grapes are recurring motifs in these images. Although wine-drinking is censured in Buddhism, textual and archaeological sources reveal the presence of well-developed pre-Buddhist traditions of viticulture and viniculture in the region. These are further corroborated by records such as Arrian‚Äôs Indica ‚Äî which described India as abundant in grapevines believed to have been brought to the region by Dionysus himself ‚Äî and Kautilya‚Äôs Arthashastra, which mentions imports of a special kind of wine from Kapisiyana (corresponding to Kapisa or the region around present-day Begram, Afghanistan). Archaeological finds such as soot-blackened vessels, round-bottomed flasks and condensers in industrial numbers in Taxila and Shaikhan Dheri also serve as evidence of wine production and distillation in Gandhara under the Kushan administration. As with most Gandharan art, there is some ambiguity around the influences for the inebriated figures, which seem to simultaneously draw on Hellenistic, Roman, Egyptian or Ptolemaic, Hindu, Buddhist and Zoroastrian cultures in both style and subject matter. While some scholars consider the scenes to be an aspect of the cult of Dionysus ‚Äî and therefore, a product of Hellenistic influence on Gandharan art ‚Äî others highlight a more indigenous source for the images in the ancient cults of yakshas and yakshis, who were ritually offered meat and alcohol and were also custodians of amrita, or the elixir of eternal life, which was held in chalices. These scenes thus indicate the tendency of Gandharan art to defy the binaries of Hellenism and Buddhism as well as of indigenous and foreign influences, to present multiple meanings and interpretations that would have been understood by the diverse and cosmopolitan audience of the region.\n\nAnthropomorphic Buddha\n\nThe first anthropomorphic representations of the seated or standing Buddha were developed between the first and third centuries CE in Gandhara and Mathura, before and during Kushan rule. The human image of the Buddha was supported by an emerging view of Buddhism that favoured an embodied form over existing symbolic or aniconic representations, such as chakras, footprints, bodhi trees and so forth. Some scholars believe that the lack of images of the Buddha before this period was due to early Buddhists, also known as Hinayana Buddhists, being opposed to representations of the Buddha, although there is no clear scriptural or textual evidence to support such a claim. The earliest examples of anthropomorphic sculpture in the Gandhara region have been dated to the late first century BCE, under Saka rule. The surviving reliefs of bodhisattvas carved in a flat, rigid style were likely a part of the stupas and monasteries in the region. A few seated figures rendered in stone and bronze, as well as images on the Bimaran reliquary ‚Äî which were probably made in the same period ‚Äî are very likely the earliest human representations of the Buddha, based on the iconography that was standardised later in that century and over the next. However, it was not until the Kushan Empire expanded into the Indian subcontinent and became a major regional power that anthropomorphic imagery of the Buddha flourished. Under the Kushans, a rise in Mahayana Buddhism was accompanied by a rise in the imperial patronage of Buddhist art. Scholars speculate that a lack of local legacy in sculptural aesthetics may have led the Kushans to commission craftsmen and sculptors from Persia, Greece and Rome ‚Äì cultures that had a long tradition of envisioning religious and spiritual heads in the anthropomorphic form ‚Äì to produce images of the Buddha. Many of these were sculpted from the blue or grey slate of the Swat valley and depicted the Buddha with several features that have now become ubiquitous, including a smooth and youthful face, a protective halo behind the head, the ushnisha or top knot in his hair and an urna or small between the eyebrows, to name a few. These features became essential elements in subsequent depictions of the Buddha and comprise the thirty two mahapurusha lakshanas listed in the Pali Canon. These standardised representations of the Buddha, along with other Graeco-Buddhist art, comprise what is now known as the Gandhara school. In images of the standing Buddha, the Hellenistic influence is most pronounced in the naturalistic modelling of the robes, his slight contrapposto posture and his bare feet. The seated or meditating Buddha, however, sits cross-legged with his feet either tucked under him or in padmasana. The palms of his hands and soles of his feet are typically marked with the chakra or the swastika. A rare variation of the seated Buddha is the fasting Buddha, an extremely emaciated figure intended to represent the Shakyamuni Buddha after the seven weeks for which he is believed to have meditated without pause. The introduction of the anthropomorphised Buddha further paved the way for narrative reliefs depicting the Jataka tales, particularly his life as Siddhartha, replete with iconography borrowed from both the Graeco-Roman and Hindu traditions. These reliefs line the dome and the base of several stupas from the first and second centuries CE. Several Kushan rulers also associated themselves with the Buddha and commissioned bodhisattva statues in their likeness in order to grant a divine legitimacy to their reign. The standing anthropomorphic Buddha, for instance, was stamped on gold coins during the reign of the emperor Kanishka, who was himself depicted on the obverse. In Mathura, the anthropomorphic Buddha emerged by the early second century. Sculpted from red sandstone in high relief, the Mathura Buddhas seem to be modified versions of yakshas ‚Äì nature and guardian deities whose sculptures had been produced in the region since the second century BCE ‚Äì with robes replacing the dhoti and paryataka. The Mathura version featured full lips, broad shoulders, a thick neck, a spiral ushnisha and robes rendered with shallow grooves, as though to indicate a thin, translucent fabric. A subtle but significant characteristic of the early Mathura Buddhas is their gaze, which is directed at the viewer, unlike the meditative gaze of the Gandhara Buddhas. Standing Mathura Buddhas were not shown in contrapposto, suggesting a significantly reduced Greek influence. In other respects, such as the frequent appearance of the abhaya mudra, the presence of the urna and the benevolent expression, the Mathura Buddha is very similar to its Gandharan counterpart. By the fourth century, when both centres of Buddhist art and most areas with a Buddhist following fell under Gupta rule, the Gandhara and Mathura styles began to merge. Buddhas made in this period are a clear amalgamation of the physical proportions of the Gandhara Buddhas and the drapery of the Mathura style. The ushnisha, for example, was now considered a cranial protrusion covered in a layer of thick curly hair or dried snails, rather than a top knot of curly hair, although visually it remained the same as that of the Gandhara Buddha. Over the centuries, the Gupta version spread across Asia as the standard image of the Buddha, with variations occurring from region to region.\n\nLion Capital, Sarnath\n\nOne of the earliest stone sculptures made under the patronage of the Mauryan king Ashoka, the lion capital at Sarnath, Bihar, depicts four male Asiatic lions seated on a round abacus with their backs to each other. The capital is carved from a single block of highly polished Chunar stone that is separate from the block used for the pillar shaft, which features the inscribed edicts of Ashoka. The most elaborately carved of all surviving Ashokan capitals, the lion capital stands at a height of two meters and is dated to ca. 250 BCE. The broken remnants of the pillar, as well as the complete, but detached, capital were formally excavated around the year 1905 by F O Oertel. The capital is believed to have originally been attached on top of the pillar. Also among the findings were fragments of a large dharmachakra stone with thirty-two spokes, which is presumed to have rested on the capital in a likely reference to the Buddha‚Äôs first sermon. The four lions comprising the capital are depicted with their mouths open as if mid-roar and their manes are arranged in neat ringlets. They also portray an understated but carefully studied musculature. Scholars claim that the eye sockets of the lions were once fitted with semi-precious stones. The overall form of the lions is poised, heavily stylised and compact, similar to the lion images carved in Achaemenid Persia, which is a known source of influence for Mauryan architecture. In addition, the abacus features four animals ‚Äî an elephant, a lion, a bull and a horse, carved in high relief and suggesting that the sculptor(s) may have been familiar with the anatomies of the animals. They appear to be moving in a clockwise direction and are separated by four chakras with twenty-four spokes each. The abacus rests on an upturned, bell-shaped lotus with elongated, fluted petals, which are also believed to have been borrowed from the Achaemenid style of architecture. Sarnath is the site of the Buddha‚Äôs first sermon and the lion capital is believed to have been built to commemorate the occasion. Therefore, the various icons that appear on the capital are recurring symbols within Buddhism. The dharmachakra is a solar symbol with its origin in many faiths and, therefore, has multiple interpretations. Here, it is believed to represent the Buddha ‚Äúturning the wheel of the law‚Äù with his first sermon at Sarnath. It also possibly refers to Ashoka‚Äôs title of Chakravartin, meaning ‚Äúa ruler whose chariot wheels roll everywhere.‚Äù Some sources interpret the lions as personifying the Shakyamuni (of the Shakya, or lion, clan) Buddha who preached his sermons at Sarnath. Their open mouths are interpreted as spreading the Buddha‚Äôs teachings, the Four Noble Truths, far and wide. An almost identical lion capital with its mouth open is found at the Sanchi pillar, which is another site where the Buddha is believed to have delivered sermons. Some interpretations suggest that the lions symbolise not only Buddha, but also Ashoka. As a significant ruler of the first historical empire in India with a vast geographical reach, strong relations with foreign states and diverse secular cultures, Ashoka was held in parallel with the Buddha, having limitedly imbibed the Buddhist way of life. The animals on the abacus are interpreted differently by various scholars. According to Alfred Charles Auguste Foucher, and later accepted by most other scholars, the four animals are associated with the four milestone events in the Buddha‚Äôs life: the elephant, representing his mother Queen Maya‚Äôs dream of a white elephant entering her womb; the bull, representing his birth under the astrological sign Vrishabha; the horse, representing Kantaka, the horse on which Buddha fled his palace to pursue asceticism; and the lion, representing the enlightened Buddha and often known as Shakyasimha. The animals are depicted running in the clockwise direction and separated by four dharma chakras, possibly signifying the intention of setting the wheel in motion through the cycle of life or representing the Buddha setting the wheel in motion at the sermon at Sarnath. Another prevalent opinion is that these animals face the cardinal directions. They have also been identified as the four perils of samsara ‚Äî birth, disease, death and decay ‚Äî following each other in an endless cycle. The upturned lotus that the capital rests on represents purity in Buddhist art, sculpture, ritual and theory and symbolises rising above the mundanity of life to attain enlightenment. In 1950, three years after Indian independence, the lion capital at Sarnath was adopted as the emblem of the Republic of India, with the lions representing virtues such as pride, power, courage and confidence. The inverted lotus bell has been omitted, and the motto ‚ÄòSatyameva Jayate, meaning ‚Äútruth alone triumphs,‚Äù is inscribed in Devanagari script below the abacus. The original lion capital is now preserved at the Sarnath Museum, near Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh.\n\nGandharan Sculpture\n\nA genre of sculpture that arose and developed between 100 BCE and 700 CE in the ethnically diverse and religiously tolerant cultures of the ancient region of Gandhara, in the northwest of the ancient Indian subcontinent. The body of sculptural art from this period, in the form of reliefs and freestanding work serving mostly as expressions of Buddhist faith, is unique for its syncretic character, combining stylistic influences of the Hellenistic, Persian and Kushan cultures. Gandhara Buddhist sculpture is particularly noteworthy for introducing anthropomorphic depictions of the Buddha, bodhisattvas and associated figures. Gandhara was one of the sixteen mahajanapadas or kingdom-states of ancient northern India, and was established as a province or satrapy of the Achaemenid Empire in the early fifth century BCE by Darius I, after which it experienced several waves of ethnically diverse dominion including conquest by Alexander the Great. This cosmopolitan culture developed a distinctive visual vocabulary that drew predominantly on the art that had historically received imperial patronage ‚Äî from the Macedonians, Greco-Bactrians (Hellenistic), Sakas and Indo-Parthians ‚Äî and Buddhist traditions introduced largely by the Mauryans. The visual expression, particularly in the plastic arts, blossomed under direct and indirect patronage from the Kushan court until the late third century CE, and continued to evolve in scale and complexity well into the sixth century. It began to wane, however, with the arrival Hephthalites and the subsequent shifting of the imperial attention of later dynasties towards other cultural centres in northern India such as Sarnath and Mathura. Ancient Gandhara was a vibrant crossroads between the classical cultures of the Mediterranean region and those of South Asia, reflected in the Graeco-Buddhist art of the area. The boundaries have been redrawn numerous times due to shifting geopolitical control in the region. Yet, amidst this flux, historical centres of Gandhara‚Äôs cultural production ‚Äî Taksashila (now Taxila), Pushkalavati (now Charsaddha) and Purushpura (now Peshawar) ‚Äî remained vital and relevant, aided by Gandhara‚Äôs position on the Silk Road. The variety and richness of the artistic traditions in the region were also due in large part to the varied levels of patronage from the many donors who funded everything from small figurines to entire rows of relief panels and sacred reliquaries. The earliest examples of iconic sculpture in the early Graeco-Buddhist Gandhara region date back to the late first century BCE, under Saka rule, the only surviving examples of which are reliefs of bodhisattvas that were likely part of the stupas and monasteries in the region. The figures were rendered in a rigid but distinctly Graeco-Roman style, as seen in their angular build and the folds of their clothing. Later, from the first century CE onwards, bodhisattvas were portrayed more naturalistically as subtly toned figures draped in heavy robes. They were individualised by their moustaches and hairstyles, most of which were variations of the top knot: a Gandharan interpretation of the Buddha‚Äôs ushnisha (cranial protuberance). The bodhisattva understood to be Maitreya is distinguished by his looped knot and the water flask in his left hand. Avalokiteshvara or Padmapani, who is otherwise the most popular bodhisattva in later styles, was shown holding a lotus. Bodhisattvas became more relevant to religious ceremonies over the first five centuries, even as the aniconic reliquaries holding remnants of the Buddha continued to be central to all worship. The earliest anthropomorphic representation of the Buddha are a few relief images on the Bimaran reliquary in the late first century CE, based on iconography that was standardised later in that century and the next. With local and imperial patronage under the Kushan dynasty, artisans at Gandhara further developed the Graeco-Roman anthropomorphic style, and created the first large, free-standing stone images of the Buddha, sculpted from the blue or gray schist of the Swat valley. The introduction of the anthropomorphised Buddha paved the way for narrative reliefs depicting his life, replete with iconography borrowed from Graeco-Roman and subcontinental cultures. These reliefs, usually depicting episodes from the Buddha‚Äôs last life, lined the dome and the base of stupas, and were read in ritual processions (pradakshina) clockwise around the stupa. For stupas of a large size, this narrative was supplemented by further tales from the Buddha‚Äôs past lives. The Buddha in this format is typically depicted as he is in statues: bearing a halo and no ornaments, wearing a long rippling robe, and having a calm countenance. The women that appeared in the narrative scenes are modelled after yakshis but are shown holding cornucopias and wearing wreaths and robes very similar to the classical Greek style. Their depiction under trees and leafy canopies prefigures the salabhanjikas or ‚Äúmaidens of the sal trees,‚Äù a popular image in later reliefs and sculptures. In this phase of relief art, one finds a close reference to textual sources such as the Abhiniskramana sutra, indicating Gandhara‚Äôs closer affinity to the Central Asian and Chinese textual traditions than the north Indian oral traditions. After the second century, the narrative element was discarded in favour of portraiture in reliefs and friezes, mainly of the figures of the Buddha and bodhisattvas. These were decidedly devotional images, and exhibited a clear hierarchy of scale ‚Äî the Buddha was shown as a looming figure, surrounded by diminutive secondary figures. Solo reliefs such as these were positioned above entrances to the stupa, and along the upper part of the drum, signifying to devotees the sanctity of the monument. The most common subject among these depictions was the seated Buddha in his moment of enlightenment under the Bodhi tree, which led early scholars to conclude that such images were part of a narrative series of the Buddha‚Äôs miracles. Friezes that did not feature the Buddha but showed lesser subjects, such as bodhisattvas and characters from the Buddha‚Äôs life, were used as stair risers, i.e., the vertical face of the stairs leading up along the stupa. These stair-risers occasionally included non-Buddhist mythological figures carved in an emphatically Hellenistic style, either as an homage to the Indo-Greek culture or as a surviving remnant of it. These few but interesting examples include a series of spear-wielding Greek deities flanked by Corinthian columns, lines of inebriated figures courting a man who appears to be the Greek god Dionysius, images of Hercules carrying a vajra (a weapon representing a diamond and a thunderbolt), and the figure of the Atlas situated around the base of the stupa, symbolically holding it up. Another sculptural element rendered in this style, possibly from the early first century, was a ring of garland-holders: a procession of male and female figures arranged around the surface of the stupa‚Äôs drum, carrying heavy garlands over their shoulders. Inscriptions suggest that donors sponsored figurines such as these, as well as large reliefs and free-standing sculptures. Aside from stupa reliefs, free-standing statues and busts of Greek deities such as Athena and Poseidon were also made at Gandhara, although in very small numbers and with unknown patronage. Unlike the publicly visible emphasis on Buddhism, many finely made objects of personal use, such as combs and vases, almost exclusively featured Greek imagery. In particular, stone palettes (also known as toilet trays) which were used for mixing cosmetic pastes and powders, feature relief images of Greek gods, sea monsters and Nereids. These are unique to Gandhara, and were made between the second century BCE and the first century CE. Gandharan sculpture can be broadly classified‚Äî based on the predominant medium used ‚Äî into schist and stucco phases. Up until the third century CE, the stone used was almost exclusively grey, and occasionally green, schist. Stucco began to be used subsequently for reliefs as well as monumental free-standing statues of the Buddha and bodhisattvas because it lent itself better to modelling and was a more economical medium. These were made with an armature of wood, rope and straw ‚Äî and sometimes even a rough core of schist ‚Äî which was then covered and modelled in stucco. Gaining popularity as Gupta influence began to affect the style at Gandhara in the fifth century, stucco effected a slimmer, smoother silhouette that was more rounded in the shoulders than stone. Metal and ivory were reserved for devotional objects such as reliquaries and life-sized bronze Buddhas and bodhisattvas, and secular objects such as coins, mirror handles and combs. When the use of bronze for statuary grew more common, stylistic variations began to emerge, such as the expansion of the halo to envelop the standing Buddha figure. Although Gandharan art is defined by its repertoire of Buddhist sculptures, it also includes a small but important body of Brahmanical representations. Most noteworthy and prevalent among them are the relief sculptures of Skanda, shown here as a martial hero before he was absorbed into the Hindu pantheon. Depicted in a suit of armour with a bow strung across the chest and a sword in hand, Skanda is shown trampling a similarly clad figure with a buffalo head. This representation of the Mahisasuramardini narrative as carried out by Skanda and not Durga, and is the only known depiction of a variant of the popular myth. The extant and preserved Gandharan art, mostly from early acquisition during the British Raj, which received a great deal of attention for its notably hybrid nature has been dispersed across various institutions globally, with the largest collection being housed by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Other notable museum collections include the Karachi and Lahore Museums, the National Museum in New Delhi, the Indian Museum in Kolkata and the British Museum in London.\n\nDeccani Manuscript Painting\n\nComprising the manuscript illustration traditions patronised by the sultanates of Ahmadnagar, Bijapur and Golconda, Deccani manuscript painting flourished between the sixteenth and late seventeenth centuries. It also includes the manuscripts and muraqqas commissioned by Maratha emperors and peshwas in the eighteenth century, though these were fewer in number. Manuscript painting in the Deccan grew steadily until the Mughal conquest of the region between 1600‚Äì87 resulted in the annexation of the Deccan sultanates, after which a combination of puppet governments and appointed governors kept the practice alive, but with a heavy emphasis on emulating the Mughal aesthetic. The Deccan plateau, which extends over most of the land between the eastern and western coasts of the Indian peninsula, has enjoyed a long history of trade and artistic exchange because of its many ports, which linked it to the Indian Ocean trade routes. Further, the royal families of several Deccan sultanates also had ancestral or cultural links with Persia and Turkey. As a result, Deccan manuscript painting absorbed a range of influences, especially from the Safavid and Mughal ateliers, and, in its initial phases, from the paintings and sculptures of medieval Hindu and Jain temples in the region. It is also notable for its patronage from women rulers, whose power is reflected in the paintings, as well as in subjects such as astrological charts, the Buraq and composite animals. While the style varied somewhat between courts and time periods, overall Deccani manuscript paintings were boldly coloured, heavily ornamented, and often equal parts fantastical and detailed in their rendering of flora and fauna. The costumes and jewellery worn by the figures featured varying degrees of synthesis between the south Indian fashions of the time and the traditional attires of Persia and Asia Minor. The matured styles of the various courts ‚Äî in the early decades of the seventeenth century ‚Äî show a fascination with movement, especially the suggestion of a slight breeze that lent a characteristic dynamism to otherwise static figures. Persian influences can be seen particularly in the way mountains and faces were drawn, and in the high, slightly curved horizon line. However, as Mughal military expansion into the south began at the end of the sixteenth century, painters began to move between Mughal and Deccan ateliers, sometimes deliberately altering their work for their north Indian patrons. Over time, Deccani paintings became more naturalistic, more tightly composed and more muted in their colour choices ‚Äì similar to the Mughal style. The oldest surviving manuscript paintings from the region belong to the incomplete Tarif-i-Hussain Shahi manuscript, made in 1565 for the Ahmadnagar court, though scholars speculate that there may have been older manuscripts that are now lost. Information on the development of the Ahmadnagar style is particularly fragmentary, as few folios and drawings have survived. The prominent position given to Khanzada Humayun, the queen regent of Ahmadnagar between 1565‚Äì69, in the paintings and the text of the Tarif-i-Hussain Shahi manuscript suggests that she likely commissioned it herself. However, she was deliberately erased later on in all but one painting of the manuscript after her son Murtaza overthrew and imprisoned her. The Ahmadnagar style appears to become more restrained and naturalistic in the 1570s, and a clear Mughal influence is visible by the 1590s. By 1600, however, political turbulence in the kingdom and the Mughal conquest of key cities in Ahmadnagar ended local patronage for the art form, although Rajput governors of the Mughal Deccan continued to hire artisans for Rajasthani-style miniatures, particularly for portraits and ragamala paintings. The Bijapur sultanate, also formed in 1490, extensively patronised manuscript painting. The earliest example is the Nujum-ul-Ulum, an encyclopaedic manuscript on astrology and magic commissioned by Ali Adil Shah I. His successor, Ibrahim Adil Shah II, sponsored manuscript painting and other art forms generously, also dabbling in painting himself. His reign marks what scholars consider the high point of Bijapur painting, which is notable for its extremely dense use of golden floral and arabesque patterns for the ornamentation of clothing, and its intricate, varied depiction of flora. Ibrahim‚Äôs interest in both Hindu mythology and Sufism allowed for the inclusion of syncretic symbolism in illustrations commissioned during his reign, and even more so in the accompanying texts. Chand Bibi, aunt and queen regent during Ibrahim‚Äôs minority, features in later eighteenth-century Deccan paintings as the ideal female ruler and warrior, typically depicted hawking with an entourage. While Ibrahim‚Äôs successors continued to commission illustrated manuscripts, this was done as a matter of courtly duty rather than personal interest. This, along with the increased presence of Mughal governors in the region following the conquest of Ahmadnagar territories in 1600‚Äì36, meant that the younger generation of local artists was encouraged to emulate the Mughal style in their commissioned manuscripts. Many artists trained in the north were also brought into the royal ateliers of the Deccan. As a result, the Bijapuri style became very close to that of Mughal manuscript paintings by 1680, soon after which Bijapur was annexed by Aurangzeb. Meanwhile, in the north Deccan, the Maratha court took an interest in manuscript painting, commissioning muraqqas, ragamalas and illustrated copies of religious texts regularly over the course of the early seventeenth and eighteenth century. Initially, these were made at Rajput kingdoms in Rajasthan, but as Maratha patronage steadied, local painters were hired in the chitrashalas or painting ateliers at Poona (now Pune). In Hyderabad, the Qutub Shahis of Golconda ‚Äì the wealthiest of the Deccan sultanates ‚Äì employed local, West Asian and Central Asian artists in their atelier, but the style tended towards that of the Safavids. While the idealised faces and bodies of human figures of these paintings are characteristic of Persian painting, their realistic postures suggest the hand of local artisans experienced in making stone sculptures for temple walls. The Golconda style underwent subtle changes over the course of the seventeenth century: first, in the form of the Mughal naturalism, which had already spread to Bijapur, and then as a deliberate rigidity and restraint seen in painted figures, possibly in emulation of new Persian painters of miniatures such as Shaikh Abbasi. Scholars have suggested that this style may be the work of Deccani artists who trained in Persian ateliers and returned to India or of Persian artists migrating to India themselves. Following the capture of Golconda by Mughal forces in 1687 and the deposition of the Qutub Shahis, a Mughal tributary state based in Hyderabad emerged as the major political presence in the south Deccan in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. While these rulers were governors and not royalty, they still functioned as major patrons, typically commissioning portraits in which they appear in profile with grave expressions, possibly to emulate the Mughal style ‚Äì a choice that was somewhat undercut by the abundant flora surrounding them. After Hyderabad and the southern Deccan were taken over by the Asaf Jahis in 1724, the court style retained its rigid emulation of Mughal painting, steadily sponsoring artisans over the course of the eighteenth century. These works were technically well-executed and extremely formal, with the dynamism and nuance of earlier Deccan styles visible only in drawings and sketches. Today, folios and manuscripts illustrated in the Deccan can be found in museums and private collections across the world, including the National Museum, New Delhi; the Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal, Pune; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, USA; the David Collection, Copenhagen, Denmark; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, USA; and the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts, St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\nPillar of Heliodorus\n\nA free-standing, sandstone pillar measuring 6.5 metres in height, the Heliodorus Pillar is situated at the site of Besnagar (in present-day Vidisha, Madhya Pradesh) at the confluence of the rivers Bes and Betwa. The pillar contains two sets of inscriptions that describe the circumstances of its construction under the patronage of the Indo-Greek ambassador Heliodorus in the early second century BCE. It is dedicated to Vaishnava religious practices and is considered to be historical evidence of trade and diplomatic relations between the Indo-Greek kingdom centred around Taxila in modern-day Pakistan, and the kingdoms of the Gangetic Plains. The pillar‚Äôs shaft is divided into three segments crowned by a decorated but heavily damaged abacus. The lower, middle and upper segments have eight, sixteen and thirty-two sides respectively, with the upper being the shortest. The border between the lower and middle segments is decorated with a carved ring of low relief floral half-medallions. The middle and upper segments are in turn separated by a mid-relief garland of entwined vines looped around honeysuckle flowers and fruits, and held up by pairs of geese. Above the upper segment is a smooth cylindrical segment surmounted by the capital, which consists of an upturned bell-shaped lotus base and a damaged cubical abacus that seems to have featured animal motifs, possibly mythical birds and hybrid creatures. The inscriptions suggest that a sculpted figure of Garuda in an earlier, less anthropomorphic form may have surmounted it. The lime mortar base of the pillar presents one of the earliest pieces of evidence of cement binding in India. The lower segment of the shaft bears two sets of inscriptions, each written across three faces on opposing sides of the pillar. These inscriptions were concealed under thick layers of vermillion when the structure was examined by Alexander Cunningham and other archaeologists in 1877, suggesting that it had become an object of local devotion. Before the inscriptions were uncovered, the pillar initially was dated to the fourth century and assumed to have been part of a Gupta era building. The inscriptions are written in the Brahmi script, although the language is Prakrit. The mention of a garudadhavaja (Garuda standard) ‚Äî one of the earliest such references found in India ‚Äî in the first set, and the presence of a Vishnu shrine nearby, distinguishes it from the earlier Ashokan pillars and marks it as an early monumental conception of Brahmanical religions. Scholars have suggested that it may have formed a part of a group of eight free-standing pillars dedicated to the shrine. The first set of inscriptions identifies Heliodorus as a Bhagavata and as an ambassador sent by the Indo-Greek king Antialcidas to the court of the Shunga king Bhagabhadra. The second set, inscribed on the other face of the pillar, offers advice on the path to immortality, recommending self-control, self-denial and watchfulness. Due to his description as a Bhagavata, Heliodorus is believed to have been an adherent of a Vaishnava cult, although some scholars have suggested that it could equally refer to the Buddha, who was also referred to as Bhagavan (The Blessed One) by his followers. The pillar has been understood as an aniconic symbol of Vasudeva, (considered Krishna‚Äôs father in later traditions). Vasudeva may have been represented here as embodying cosmic totality, with the three distinct levels of the pillar standing in as an axis that joins the earth, the intermediate space and the heavens. The pillar is locally known as Khambh Baba, meaning The Pillar Saint, or Father, and is occasionally worshipped. It is under the protection of the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\nMughal Miniature Painting\n\nEmerging in the manuscripts produced by the court ateliers of the Mughal dynasty, a major tradition of miniature painting was established in the Indian subcontinent in the mid-sixteenth century. Known for its naturalism, intricacy and luminosity, Mughal miniature painting embodies a range of regional and cultural influences, showing a syncretism of both style and subject matter. It fused diverse influences, incorporating pre-existing South Asian manuscript painting traditions with Persian as well as European Renaissance styles and imagery. These paintings illustrated or accompanied literary, historical, scriptural and scientific texts, and also served as visual aids for court storytellers. The Mughal miniature style remained highly influential in South Asia and the wider Islamic world until the late eighteenth century, influencing the paintings produced in smaller courts even after the decline of the Mughal empire from the early eighteenth century onwards. Having lost his Indian kingdom after a ten-year reign, the Mughal emperor Humayun (r. 1530‚Äì40; 1555‚Äì56) sought military aid in Safavid Persia, in present-day Iran. Additionally, inspired by the aesthetic achievements of Shah Tahmasp‚Äôs court there, he negotiated to take two Persian artists, Mir Sayyid Ali and Abd al-Samad, back to India. Returning to reestablish his empire in 1555, Humayun had the court atelier set up under Ali and al-Samad. During the second half of the sixteenth century, the atelier grew tremendously under his successor Akbar (r. 1556‚Äì1605), whose expansion of the Mughal empire and interest in the arts ensured a steady flow of wealth as well as artists from the kingdoms of Lahore, Kabul, Persia and Kashmir, each with their own distinctive style. The atelier expanded from about thirty artists in 1557 to over a hundred in the 1590s, including painters, colourists, calligraphers, bookbinders and other specialists. The artisans composed and painted manuscripts on fine quality paper imported from Persia and Italy, using pigments derived from rare and expensive mineral sources such as lapis lazuli, orpiment, cinnabar and gold. The atelier formed part of the Mughal kitabkhana ‚Äî ‚Äòbook house‚Äô or ‚Äòlibrary‚Äô ‚Äî an important institution in which manuscripts were produced and restored, as well as stored. The kitabkhana embodied a fluid and highly collaborative process, where specialists in various domains worked together to produce and maintain luxuriously illustrated manuscripts, and later individual paintings and designs for other objects. This helped achieve large manuscripts in the codex format, resembling the modern book, which stood in contrast to the indigenous palm-leaf manuscripts that were highly restricted in their size and shape. Each step of the process was performed by a specialised artisan with expertise in a particular aspect ‚Äî from preparing the paper and binding, to calligraphy, applying gilt and painting the margins. The art of Mughal miniatures is distinctive not only for the painted images, but equally by the Persian nastaliq calligraphy of the manuscripts, and the intricacy and ingenuity of the hashiya, or margin, decorations that framed them ‚Äî each of which was a specialised domain of artisanship. A master painter composed the images for a manuscript based on the text, to be coloured in by junior painters. Artists also specialised in different kinds of drawing, such as portraiture, animals, flora and decorative pattering ‚Äî and a level of consistency was achieved as they rendered these subjects across folios or manuscripts. At the same time, particular master artists also had distinctive visual languages that made their work recognisable ‚Äî for instance, Basawan became known for his talent for naturalism within neat compositions, whereas the work of his contemporary Daswanth was characterised by densely populated, energetic images, best exemplified through his illustrations of war in the Razmnama, a Mughal manuscript of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The names of these and other artists occasionally appear on individual folios of these manuscripts, alongside other information such as the size of the atelier and the number of days taken to complete the work. Such mentions, as well as documentation in administrative manuscripts such as the Ain-e Akbari, serve as important sources of information about the making of Mughal manuscripts today. One of the earliest examples of Mughal miniature painting is seen in a Tutinama (‚ÄòTales of a Parrot‚Äô) manuscript made in the 1560s. Illustrating the fourteenth century text, the paintings show Indian flora and fauna within Persianate landscapes; further, the human figures are realistically proportioned and rendered as dark-skinned, as associated with South Asia, rather than the willowy, fair-skinned youths emblematic of Persian paintings. Around this time, European emissaries and Jesuit Christian missionaries were invited to Akbar‚Äôs court, and brought with them religious paraphernalia and examples of European devotional art, introducing the ateliers‚Äô artists to new influences. Not only did this infuse Western Renaissance notions of perspective and pictorial depth into the work of the court artists, but Christian iconography and subjects themselves became part of the Mughal canon. Examples of this influence are seen in the Persian translation of The Life of Christ, commissioned by Akbar, as well as multiple paintings of Christ‚Äôs crucifixion, Madonna with the infant Jesus, and other Christian themes; and in the iconographic elements used in a painting showing combat between the Hindu gods Indra and Krishna in the Harivamsa. In the 1580s and 1590s, under Akbar, the atelier worked mainly on manuscripts of dynastic histories such as the Baburnama (‚ÄòBook of Babur‚Äô, written in the fifteenth century; the Timurnama (‚ÄòBook of Timur‚Äô), written in the sixteenth century; and translations of Sanskrit epics such as the Mahabharata, known in Persian as the Razmnama. These would often be large projects, both in the dimensions of the codices as well as the number of illustrations commissioned. One the Mughal atelier‚Äôs most ambitious and extensive manuscripts, the Hamzanama (‚ÄòBook of Hamza‚Äô), was made during this period. A fictional biography of the prophet Mohammed‚Äôs uncle Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib (c. 569‚Äì625), it is illustrated with 1400 paintings. Akbar also commissioned a real-time documentation of his reign, the Akbarnama (‚ÄòBook of Akbar‚Äô), which was illustrated by at least forty-nine artists in the atelier; and a lavishly illustrated manuscript known as the Khamsa of Nizami ‚Äî a set of five long narrative poems by the twelfth-century Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi ‚Äî which was a popular subject for illuminated manuscripts both before and after Akbar. By the reign of Akbar‚Äôs successor Jahangir (r. 1605‚Äì27), the types of paintings and manuscripts being produced, and thereby the structure of the atelier, were beginning to change. Jahangir had a preference for naturalism, and laid particular emphasis on portraiture, which he employed in allegorical paintings presenting his position as a divinely appointed world ruler. He was, accordingly, drawn to the work of only a few artists, and reduced the number of artists retained by the imperial atelier for long-term projects. This sufficed for manuscripts of Persian poetry, which were smaller than biographies, and also suited the shifting focus from manuscripts of single texts to muraqqas ‚Äî carefully curated albums of assorted miniature paintings, short calligraphic texts and European prints. He is also known to have commissioned a copy of a miniature painted by Isaac Oliver and shown to him by the first English ambassador to Mughal India, Sir Thomas Roe, as well as a muraqqa of Persian and Mughal paintings infused with European artistic traditions and themes. Having flourished under the patronage of Akbar and Jahangir, the ateliers remained functional during the reigns of Shah Jahan (r. 1628‚Äì58) and Aurangzeb (r. 1658‚Äì1707). While Shah Jahan maintained funding for the atelier, his interest was mainly directed towards architecture. Painting was viewed predominantly as a medium of courtly representation, and the paintings of this period were largely formal, lacking the flair for experimentation or aesthetic interest seen under the previous emperors. Nevertheless, the muraqqas, and manuscripts such as those of Shah Jahan‚Äôs biography Padshahnama (‚ÄòBook of the Emperor‚Äô), were naturalistic and technically accomplished, the latter known for their use of multiple perspectives and exuberant colours. Aurangzeb‚Äôs religious orthodoxy led him to direct funding away from the atelier a few years into his reign, but for most of the 1660s the emperor tolerated painting as a courtly art. Several distinguished examples of portraits and durbar, or court, scenes in the Mughal style were produced in this period. With the exception of a revival under the reign of Muhammad Shah (r. 1719‚Äì48), Mughal patronage for miniature painting had dwindled enough in the eighteenth century for these artists to seek employment outside the imperial court. As they were absorbed into the ateliers of smaller kingdoms, they strengthened the Mughal element in these painting traditions ‚Äî particularly those of the Rajput and Maratha courts ‚Äî many of which had already been emulating the style due to the power and influence of the Mughal empire in previous decades. Scholars today recognise two distinct categories of Mughal manuscript paintings ‚Äî those that were commissioned by the Mughal imperial court and executed by its ateliers; and a sub-imperial or popular form of Mughal painting, which was made by other, smaller ateliers patronised by minor nobility. While the similarities between them result from the style set by the wealthier, more established imperial ateliers, the difference is visible in the subject matter, the quality of materials used, and the intricacy and naturalism achieved. With the advent of British rule in the nineteenth century, the tradition of Mughal miniature painting, particularly its emphasis on naturalism, was incorporated into the Company school. Today, dispersed folios and, more rarely, whole manuscripts in the Mughal style, are housed at various museums across the world.\n\nGyaser\n\nA silk brocade fabric decorated with gold and silver threads, gyaser (also known as gos-chen in Ladakh) is used in religious rituals in Buddhist communities and is characterised by a discontinuous supplementary weft pattern. Weaving has sacred and mythical associations in Ladakh, with sacred textiles believed to grant protection and blessings to the person wearing it. It is also associated with fertility and procreation, with the textiles and the loom representing sexual union and the creation and protection of life. Thus, the weaving of sacred textiles such as gyaser was not undertaken by monks but would be imported from China, Tibet and eventually from the looms in Benares. While there are no written records indicating the introduction of the fabric to India, visual records suggest that the trade and use of gyaser in the country began c. tenth century CE during the Namgyal dynasty of Ladakh (1460‚Äì1842), with the textile being one of the items imported to the region from China. Missionaries travelling between Lhasa and Ladakh also brought back brocade samples to their monasteries, usually as unstitched fabric, robes or on the borders of stitched boots. Gyaser was introduced to Benares (present-day Varanasi) in the mid-nineteenth century by traders from Tibet as well as traders from the Marwari community who had settled in Kalimpong, which had emerged as an important commercial centre between Tibet and India. The gyaser made in Benaras gained popularity in Ladakh and Tibet due to its relatively cheaper costs compared to fabric from China, as well as the cheap cost of labour in Benaras and the higher quality of gold zari and fabric. By the early-nineteenth century, Benaras had become an important brocade-weaving centre, primarily producing kinkhwab, which was popular in the Mughal court as well as among the royalty in Ladakh. While this fabric was traded to Ladakh via Punjab, Kashmir and Kalimpong, it differed from the gyaser in its lack of Buddhist motifs. Tibetan traders also frequently visited Benares and introduced the gyaser to Benares weavers, which they would imitate. Subsequently, from the mid-nineteenth century onwards, weavers in Benares began producing gyaser featuring Chinese designs and Buddhist motifs. Trade fluctuated briefly during the 1950s and 1960s due to the closure of international trade routes to Ladakh after India‚Äôs independence and following China‚Äôs occupation of Tibet, which led to the displacement of several Tibetan communities. Trade from Kashmir and Punjab also slowed, with traders suspending travel to Ladakh. However, demand rose again after the displaced populations from Tibet had resettled across India, where they established monasteries and resumed religious activities. However, the suspension of trade routes was instrumental in driving the nobility and monastic clergy of Ladakh to source gyaser for personal and religious use directly from the weavers of Varanasi. In Varanasi, gyaser is made primarily in the area of Pili Kothi, which is known for its expensive brocades that incorporate real gold zari thread. The men draw the design on a graph, make the punch cards and dye the threads, and the women are engaged in the preparation of the multi-ply yarn. The weaving is primarily carried out on the jacquard loom, with the punch cards used for the patterning. The cloth is woven to lengths of about twenty-eight inches, with hand-patterning of motifs using metal silver or gold zari. Due to the sacred associations of the fabric, the design and colour of gyaser have not undergone major changes over the years. The fabric features Buddhist symbols such as the eight lucky signs, the thunderbolt and bell, the lotus, clouds and dragons. In the 1980s, following the Vishwakarma revival effort by the Indian government and collaborations with Martand Singh, gyaser weavers began incorporating newer, more universal designs in the fabric, such as geometric patterns, to appeal to a wider market. Gyaser pieces also began featuring patterns such as the Rusnata (Russian medallion pattern) and the flame pattern, and metallic gyaser that incorporated twill-bound lozenges. More recently, the exhibition Between Land and Sky: Woven Gold from Gyaser Tradition (2019) incorporated gyaser into saree designs by Swati Agarwal and Sunaina Jalan. Today, gyaser is woven primarily in Varanasi, with weavers replacing pure gold and silver threads with synthetic fibres to speed up the weaving process and lower costs. Gyaser woven in Varanasi is supplied to Buddhist communities in India and exported to Himalayan Buddhist countries and prominent Buddhist centres in Southeast Asia, the USA and the UK. It continues to be used in religious rituals, especially in Buddhist monasteries as altar and seat covers, monk robes, mounts for thangkas, decorative borders in hats and stitched boots. It is also used to make loom-woven products for everyday use, such as shawls, cushion covers and floor mats.\n\nThangka\n\nA devotional tradition where images of Buddhist deities are painted on scrolls, to gain divine merit and for teaching and meditating, historically, thangka paintings served as visual aids. The tradition emerged from Nepal in the seventh century and spread to the Himalayan region, significantly Tibet (now Tibet Autonomous Region). Travelling Buddhist teachers would deliver talks on Buddha‚Äôs life and teaching and complement their lectures with these painted scrolls. Thangka paintings function as intermediaries between the mortal and divine world; when consecrated in shrines or family altars, they are believed to be occupied by the deity they depict. They are also worshipped as part of public religious ceremonies, and often commissioned as a means of generating spiritual merit. They are also used to guide and enhance meditation. Derived from the pata paintings of India and practices of drawing mandala into the ground for ritual use, thangkas came to be painted on woven canvas, usually cotton, with bamboo-cane rod pasted on its bottom edge so that it could be rolled. Generally rectangular, the canvas is strung on a bamboo frame, which is stretched onto a wooden frame. It is washed and scrubbed many times and the surface is traditionally coated with chalk, gesso (animal glue) and a base pigment, which is then replaced by a distemper-glue mixture and rubbed with a piece of porcelain or glass until it is smooth. The outlines of deity and composition are then made in charcoal or pencil, according to rules of iconography and iconometry in grids. These pencilled drawings are painted over with a fine brush and later painted in. The colours used in painting were sourced naturally from vegetable and mineral pigments and mixed with lime and gluten. The colours used include red, arsenic yellow, vitriol green, carmine vermillion, lapis blue, indigo and gold. The main deity is painted once the background is filled in. When finished, the painted thangka is given a silk brocade border that usually consists of red, yellow and blue fabrics. The thangka also has a finer silk fabric stitched on it to function as a protective curtain. This is usually yellow in colour. Besides being painted, some traditional thangkas were also embroidered or appliqued. The paintings contain depictions of Buddha and scenes from his life, Buddhist deities, saints and lamas (teachers), divine beings in assembly around the cosmic tree, the Wheel of Life, mandalas, symbolic representations of the universe from canonical texts and horoscopes. Depending on the subject depicted, some thangkas presented the immediate presence of enlightened beings while others showed events from their past and had a narrative. The thangka of Buddha‚Äôs First Sermon, for instance, depicts a crucial moment from Buddha‚Äôs life where, as prince Siddhartha, he travels with five companions with whom he undergoes extreme deprivation in search of truth. The Sikkim Thangka, created and developed during the rule of the last Chogyal (priest-king) of Sikkim, uses Buddhist imagery to tell the founding myth of Sikkim; three venerated lamas are shown along with the Chogyal in a canvas replete with Tibetan and Sikkimese symbolism. The protector deity of Sikkim, Kanchendzonga ‚Äì a fiery red deity riding a snow lion and holding a banner of victory ‚Äì is shown along with the Tibetan protector of monasteries, Mahakala ‚Äì a black deity on a black horse ‚Äì and the deity of Nagas ‚Äì local faith of Sikkim ‚Äì is depicted in white. Events from the past lives of divine beings were also depicted, such as that of the Buddha as Shakyamuni. Besides paintings of enlightened beings, inanimate sacred objects such as stupas, temples and monasteries were also portrayed. The simplest of compositions would portray a single figure placed at the centre, usually that of the Buddha or a deity. When a composition comprises many sacred figures, attention needs to be paid to make each grouping distinct from one another and to ensure that the identities and positions of the figures are according to iconographic prescriptions. In these complex compositions, the retinue of figures would be smaller and arranged in vertical and horizontal columns, usually painted only in outline (often of gold). Thangkas carrying these depictions would usually not incorporate a background landscape and were painted using either a red or black background and full colour was reserved for the main deity. In another variety of group composition, an assembly of figures is depicted without any main figure ‚Äì such as in depictions of the eighty-four siddhas (great masters) or the sixteen arhats (elders). The tradition has changed significantly over time. While some monasteries continue to train lamas in the art form, most thangka painters now are artisans who have received training in the art and produce them for both commercial and religious purposes. The use of acrylic paints and synthetic fabrics has become common. Consequently, thangka paintings serve not just as highly revered objects but also as decorative items now.\n\nStar of the South\n\nA large pinkish-brown diamond, the Star of the South has been a subject of attention and intrigue since its discovery in the mid-nineteenth century. Among the first Brazilian diamonds to receive international fame, it has made its way to Europe as well as India, where it was in the ownership of the royal Gaekwad family of the princely state of Baroda (in present-day Gujarat, India) for many years. In the wake of a number of anonymous sales and transfers from the late twentieth century onwards, the whereabouts of the Star of the South at the time of writing remain unknown. The diamond was discovered in 1853 by Madi Magassa, an enslaved labourer, among the alluvial deposits of the Bagagem river in Minas Gerais, Brazil. She took the 261.38-carat rough diamond to the mine owner Casimiro de Moraes (referred to as Casimiro de Tal in some accounts). In keeping with the practice of rewarding honesty among enslaved workers, he released her from slavery and granted her a pension. Unaware of its value, de Moraes sold the diamond for GBP 3,000 to an unnamed purchaser, who took it to Rio de Janeiro and sold it for GBP 35,000. By 1855, it was in the possession of Parisian firm Halphen, who showcased the diamond at the Paris Industrial Exhibition that year, while it was still in the rough. Halphen also named it ‚Äò√âtoile du Sud‚Äô, French for ‚ÄòStar of the South‚Äô, referencing its South American origins. The diamond‚Äôs name later inspired the renaming of the city of its discovery to the Portuguese translation ‚ÄòEstrela do Sul‚Äô. Between 1856 and 1858, it was sent to Royal Coster Diamonds in Amsterdam, where it was cut by LB Voorzanger, who had also been responsible for re-faceting the Koh-i-Noor diamond shortly before. Over three months, Voorzanger cushion-cut the diamond in an oblong form measuring 35 x 29 x 19 millimetres, reducing its weight to 128.48 carats but greatly enhancing its brilliance. The diamond continued to attract attention and grew in popularity through its media coverage, particularly after a replica of it was showcased at the International Exhibitions of London and Paris in 1862 and 1867 respectively. Later in the same decade, Halphen is said to have sent the Star of the South briefly to India, where it drew the attention of various members of royalty, including an unnamed maharaja who made an unsuccessful bid for the diamond. In the late 1860s, the Maharaja of Baroda Khande Rao II Gaekwad (r. 1856‚Äì70) bought the diamond for GBP 80,000 using the services of London dealer Edward Dresden, after whom the 78.5-carat English Dresden was named. The Gaekwad family later also purchased this diamond ‚Äî which originated from the same region as the Star of the South ‚Äî and in 1880, commissioned a necklace that would showcase both historic diamonds. In 1948, Khande Rao‚Äôs granddaughter-in-law the Maharani of Baroda Sita Devi (r. 1943‚Äì48) was photographed wearing this necklace by Henri Cartier-Bresson. While there is no conclusive information about the diamond between 1950 and 2001, the Gaekwad family claims that the Star of the South was included in its wealth tax returns until as late as 1988. In 2001, an anonymous buyer bought the Star of the South and sent it to the G√ºbelin Gem Lab in Lucerne, Switzerland to be analysed, making it one of the few historic diamonds for which a comprehensive gemological analysis has been published. The luxury house Cartier is said to have purchased the Star of the South in 2002, according to reports that appeared in 2007.\n\nKoh-i-Noor Diamond\n\nA large diamond with a long history, the Koh-i-Noor is famously associated with conquests and the shifting balance of power among rival empires between the thirteenth and nineteenth centuries. Said to have been named Koh-i-noor ‚Äî meaning ‚Äòmountain of light‚Äô in Persian ‚Äî by Iranian conqueror Nader Shah, the diamond has changed hands many times, usually as a spoil of war. Its owners include the Kakatiya dynasty of South India, the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughals, the Afsharids of present-day Iran, the Durranis of present-day Afghanistan, and maharajas of the Sikh empire, before the British East India Company acquired it. Housed in Britain since 1849 as Crown property, today it is the subject of criticism, international tensions and debates surrounding the colonial appropriation of goods. Weighing about 190 carats through its early history, the oval diamond in its present form weighs 105.6 carats, and is 3.6 centimetres long, 3.2 centimetres wide and 1.3 centimetres deep. The diamond‚Äôs origin and its history before the seventeenth century are uncertain. According to most modern scholarship, it is thought to have been discovered in the thirteenth century, sifted from alluvial deposits in the Krishna‚ÄìGodavari river delta in present-day Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in India ‚Äî the site of the later-established Kollur mines, famous for the Golconda diamonds. This put the stone in the possession of the ruling Kakatiya dynasty until it was, by most accounts, paid as tribute to the Delhi Sultanate when Alauddin Khilji‚Äôs forces subjugated the Kakatiyas c.1310. The diamond shifted hands among the various dynasties of the Delhi Sultanate for the next two centuries, including the Khiljis, the Tughlaqs, the Sayyids and the Lodis. When Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi in the Battle of Panipat in 1526, the diamond passed to him, receiving the epithet ‚ÄòDiamond of Babur‚Äô, and remained with the emperors of the Mughal dynasty for the next two hundred years. Babur‚Äôs account in his memoir Baburnama suggests an alternative provenance for the diamond, stating that it had previously been in possession of the king of Gwalior. According to other accounts, it may have been housed in the kingdom of Malwa before it was taken by the Delhi Sultanate. Weighing roughly 190 carats, the Koh-i-noor was at the time one of the largest diamonds in the world. In Hindu mythology and popular imagination, the Koh-i-Noor is considered to have a history dating back millennia. The precious stone Syamantaka described in the Bhagavata and Vishnu Puranas as endowing magical powers on its owners ‚Äî which included the mythical Surya, Satrajita, Krishna and Jambavan ‚Äî is sometimes interpreted as the Koh-i-Noor. However, these literary narratives are understood in scholarship to conflate several distinct historical gems. The first verifiable record of the Koh-i-Noor appears in Muhammad Kazim Marvi‚Äôs biography of Nader Shah, in which it is described as being embedded in Shah Jahan‚Äôs Peacock Throne. In 1628, Shah Jahan commissioned an exceptionally opulent throne as a symbol of his power, featuring the forms of two peacocks. Covered in gold and silver and studded with numerous precious stones including the Koh-i-Noor (then known as the Diamond of Babur), the Akbar Shah Diamond and the Timur Ruby, it served as a symbol of the extravagance, luxury and power that the Mughal empire epitomised at the time. Based on seventeenth-century French jeweller Jean Baptiste Tavernier‚Äôs account, it is sometimes theorised that the Koh-i-Noor was cut from the Great Mughal Diamond under Aurangzeb‚Äôs rule. However, this theory has generally been discredited in light of recent research. When Afsharid Persian conqueror Nader Shah invaded Delhi in 1739 he brought the Peacock Throne, among many other Mughal treasures, back to Iran ‚Äî removing, however, the Koh-i-Noor and the Timur Ruby from the throne to wear on an armband. While the throne was later dismantled for the value of its component materials and gems, the armband with the Koh-i-Noor came into the possession of Ahmad Shah Durrani, who succeeded Nader Shah after the latter‚Äôs death in 1747, soon establishing and ruling what is present-day Afghanistan. In 1809, one of his successors, Shah Shujah, fled with the diamond after being overthrown, and was captured by the founder of the Sikh empire Ranjit Singh in Lahore, present-day Pakistan. Having refused to part with the diamond initially, he used it to negotiate his release in 1814. In Ranjit Singh‚Äôs possession, the Koh-i-Noor‚Äôs reputation grew further as a coveted marker of prestige and dominance. He displayed it on the front of his turban or wore it on his arm at important state events or festivals, as a symbol of the territorial power he had reclaimed from the Iranian and Afghan rulers since their siege of Delhi. At all other times, it was kept fiercely guarded. At Ranjit Singh‚Äôs death in 1839, his head priest alleged that the king had willed the stone to the Jagannath Temple in Puri, Odisha. However, his treasurer secured it for the successors to the throne, maintaining that it was state property. While the British imperialists also wished to acquire the diamond, it remained with Ranjit Singh‚Äôs successors through a tumultuous period in the Sikh empire. In 1843, his youngest son Duleep Singh ascended to the throne at the age of five. In 1849, the British annexed the princely state of Punjab, forcing the ten-year-old Duleep Singh to sign the Last Treaty of Lahore, which required him to surrender his position and hand over the Koh-i-Noor to Britain‚Äôs Queen Victoria. In 1851, the diamond was displayed at the Great Exhibition in Londo"
