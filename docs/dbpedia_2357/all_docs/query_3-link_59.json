This can be seen particularly in the jewellery of the gods that adorn their temple walls.\n\nThey are easily distinguishable from other medieval temples by their highly original star-like ground-plans and a profusion of decorative carvings.\n\nSome of the famous temples are the Hoysaleshvara temple (Lord of the Hoysalas) at Halebid in Karnataka that was built in dark schist stone and the Chennakeshava temple in Somnathpura, Karnataka built under Narasimha III.\n\nTwo notable locations of Jain worship in the Hoysala territory were Shravanabelagola and Panchakuta Basadi, Kambadahalli.\n\nHoysaleswara Temple\n\nHoysaleswara temple, also referred simply as the Halebidu temple, is a 12th-century Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva.\n\nIt is the largest monument in Halebidu built on the banks of a large man-made lake, and sponsored by King Vishnuvardhana of the Hoysala Empire.\n\nDuring the early 14th century, Halebidu was twice sacked and plundered by the Muslim armies of the Delhi Sultanate from northern India, and the temple and the capital fell into a state of ruin and neglect.\n\nThe Hoysaleswara temple is a Shaivism tradition monument, yet reverentially includes many themes from Vaishnavism and Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, as well as images from Jainism.\n\nChennakeshava Temple\n\nThe Chennakeshava Temple, also referred to as Keshava, Kesava or Vijayanarayana Temple of Belur, is a 12th-century Hindu temple in the Hassan district of Karnataka state, India.\n\nIt was commissioned by King Vishnuvardhana in 1117 CE, on the banks of the Yagachi River in Belur also called Velapura, an early Hoysala Empire capital.\n\nIt was repeatedly damaged and plundered during wars, repeatedly rebuilt and repaired over its history.\n\nChennakesava is a form of the Hindu god Vishnu. The temple is dedicated to Vishnu and has been an active Hindu temple since its founding.\n\nThe Hoysala Empire and its capital was invaded, plundered and destroyed in the early 14th century by Malik Kafur, a commander of the Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khalji.\n\nAbout Hoysala Empire\n\nThe Hoysala Empire was a Kannadiga power originating from the Indian subcontinent that ruled most of what is now Karnataka, India between the 10th and the 14th centuries.\n\nIn the 12th century, taking advantage of the internecine warfare between the Western Chalukya Empire and Kalachuris of Kalyani, they annexed areas of present-day Karnataka and the fertile areas north of the Kaveri delta in present-day Tamil Nadu.\n\nThe capital of the Hoysalas was initially located at Belur but was later moved to Halebidu.\n\nHalebidu was the capital of the Hoysala Empire between the c. 11th to 14th century CE when Jainism maintained a strong presence in the region.\n\nThe region was called Dorasamudra or Dwarasamundra during the rule of Hoysala.\n\nBittiga (later became Vishnuvardhana), is considered the greatest ruler of Hoysala kingdom and was a Jain till around 1115 after which he converted to Vaishnavism under the influence of the Hindu saint Ramanujacharya.\n\nHowever, he still recognized Jainism on par with Hinduism. During their regime, Hinduism and Jainism co-existed with utmost religious harmony.\n\nAlong with the famous Hoysala Architecture, the Hoysala rulers also patronised the fine arts, encouraging literature to flourish in Kannada and Sanskrit.\n\nDuring the rule of the Hoysalas, three important religious developments took place in present-day Karnataka inspired by three philosophers, Basava, Madhvacharya and Ramanuja.\n\n-Source: The Hindu\n\nFORMER SC JUDGE: COLLECTION OF DNA SAMPLES WILL LEAD TO MISUSE\n\nContext:\n\nRetired Supreme Court judge Justice Madan Lokur submitted to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology that allowing investigating agencies to collect DNA samples from “suspects” as laid down in the DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill 2019, will give them “unbridled power that is easily capable of misuse and abuse” and amount to a “threat to the life, liberty, dignity and privacy of a person”.\n\nRelevance:\n\nGS-II: Polity and Governance (Government Policies and Interventions)\n\nDimensions of the Article:\n\nDNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2019\n\nUsage of DNA Evidence in India\n\nWhy is the bill required (according to the government)?\n\nArguments Against the Bill\n\nMore about the recent report tabled in the Parliament regarding DNA profiling bill\n\nDNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2019\n\nThe DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2019 also known as the DNA profiling bill, tries to check use of DNA technology to establish the identity of a person.\n\nAccording to the government, the DNA technology bill aims to establish the identity of missing persons, victims, offenders, under trials and unknown deceased persons.\n\nProvisions of the Bill\n\nIt seeks to establish a national data bank and regional DNA data banks.\n\nIt envisages that every databank will maintain indices like the crime scene index, suspects’ or undertrials’ index, offenders’ index, missing persons’ index and unknown deceased persons’ index.\n\nIt also seeks to establish a DNA Regulatory Board. Every laboratory that analyses DNA samples to establish the identity of an individual, has to be accredited by the board.\n\nThe bill also proposes a written consent by individuals be obtained before collection of their DNA samples. However, consent is not required for offences with punishment of more than seven years in jail or death.\n\nIt also provides for the removal of DNA profiles of suspects on the filing of a police report or court order, and of undertrials on the basis of a court order. Profiles in the crime scene and missing persons’ index will be removed on a written request.\n\nUsage of DNA Evidence in India\n\nDNA evidence was first accepted by the Indian courts in 1985, but it was not till January, 2019 that a bill on the issue was first introduced in Parliament and even passed by the Lok Sabha.\n\nThe initiative to draft a bill regulating the use of DNA samples for crime related reasons began in the year 2003.\n\nThe Department of Biotechnology established a committee known as the DNA Profiling Advisory Committee to make recommendations for the drafting of the DNA profiling bill 2006. This eventually became the Human DNA Profiling Bill, 2007.\n\nIn 2016, the Use and Regulation of DNA based technology in Civil and Criminal Proceedings, Identification of Missing Persons and Human Remains Bill was listed for introduction, consideration and passing. Activists and experts raised concerns over the 2016 version of the bill as well.\n\nIn 2018, the Law Commision of India in its 271st report prepared the draft bill and examined various judicial pronouncements and constitutional provisions and recorded that DNA profiling was indeed used for disaster victim identification, investigations of crime, identification of missing persons and human remains and also for medical research purposes. – However, it also flagged the privacy concerns and the ethics involved in this scientific collection of data were very high.\n\nWhy is the bill required (according to the government)?\n\nThe Bill is urgently required as its applications would be to enable identification of missing children.\n\nAs per the National Crime Records Bureau, annually 1,00,000 children go missing.\n\nThe Bill will also help in identifying unidentified deceased, including disaster victims and apprehend repeat offenders for heinous crimes such as rape and murder.\n\nDNA testing is currently being done on an extremely limited scale in India\n\nThe standards of the laboratories are not monitored or regulated.\n\nArguments Against the Bill\n\nMany claim that the DNA profiling bill is a violation of human rights as it could compromise with the privacy of the individuals, that is because all the details of the person’s body and his DNA profile will be with the state. The Supreme Court has recognised the Right to Privacy as a fundamental right.\n\nIt will be used not only in the settlement of criminal cases but also in civil matters like using DNA profiling in matters such as surrogacy, maternity or paternity check, organ transplantation and immigration.\n\nThe Declaration of Helsinki, 1964, which contains principles stressing on informed consent, confidentiality of data, vulnerable population and requirement of a protocol etc., is used to cite against the DNA profiling bill.\n\nMore about the recent report tabled in the Parliament regarding DNA profiling bill\n\nIn his submission, Justice Lokur has argued that in a blind crime or a crime involving a large number of persons (such as a riot) everybody is suspect, without any real basis – Which will mean that thousands of persons can be subjected to DNA profiling on a mere suspicion.\n\nJustice Lokur has stated that the provisions of the bill can lead to targeting of select groupings, including social, linguistic, religious and other minorities on the ground of being suspects.\n\nMany members of the committee too had expressed concern over including “suspects” in this list, flagging that it could lead to misuse and targeting certain categories of people.\n\nAt the same time, the committee has observed that it does not negate the need for such legislation especially when DNA technology was in use.\n\n-Source: The Hindu\n\nUNION BUDGET ON INDIA’S WEAK FISCAL POSITION\n\nContext:\n\nThe Union Budget’s focus on higher capital expenditure, financial sector reforms and asset sales would help to stimulate growth and supply broad-based credit support, but India’s weak fiscal position would remain a key credit challenge compared with its rating peers.\n\nRelevance:\n\nGS-III: Indian Economy (Economic Development)\n\nDimensions of the Article:\n\nMoody’s Investors Service on India’s Weak financial position based on the budget\n\nWhat was in the Budget regarding Deficits?\n\nWhat is Fiscal Deficit?\n\nWhat is Revenue Deficit?\n\nMoody’s Investors Service on India’s Weak financial position based on the budget\n\nThe budget projects a narrowing of the central government’s fiscal deficit to almost 7% of GDP in fiscal 2022 from an estimated 9.5% in fiscal 2021.\n\nThe ratings agency said the widening of the deficit in fiscal 2021 was driven almost entirely by expenditure to support Indian households and the economy from the pandemic shock.\n\nWhat was in the Budget regarding Deficits?\n\nRevenue deficit is targeted at 5.1% of GDP in 2021-22, which is lower than the revised estimate of 7.5% in 2020-21 (3.3% in 2019-20).\n\nFiscal deficit is targeted at 6.8% of GDP in 2021-22, down from the revised estimate of 9.5% in 2020-21 (4.6% in 2019-20).\n\nThe government aims to steadily reduce fiscal deficit to 4.5% of GDP by 2025-26.\n\nWhat is Fiscal Deficit?\n\nFiscal Deficit is the difference between the total income of the government (total taxes and non-debt capital receipts) and its total expenditure.\n\nA fiscal deficit situation occurs when the government’s expenditure exceeds its income.\n\nA recurring high fiscal deficit means that the government has been spending beyond its means.\n\nThe government describes fiscal deficit of India as “the excess of total disbursements from the Consolidated Fund of India, excluding repayment of the debt, over total receipts into the Fund (excluding the debt receipts) during a financial year”.\n\nWhat is Revenue Deficit?\n\nRevenue deficit arises when the government’s revenue expenditure exceeds the total revenue receipts.\n\nRevenue deficit includes those transactions that have a direct impact on a government’s current income and expenditure.\n\nThis represents that the government’s own earnings are not sufficient to meet the day-to-day operations of its departments.\n\nRevenue deficit turns into borrowings when the government spends more than what it earns and has to resort to the external borrowings.\n\nNote that revenue receipts are receipts which neither create liability nor lead to a reduction in assets.\n\nIt is further divided into two heads:\n\nReceipt from Tax\n\nReceipts from Non-Tax Revenue\n\n-Source: The Hindu"
