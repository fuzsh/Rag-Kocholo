The same suggestion has also been made by some Telugu scholars with regard to their literature and it Las been said that Buddhist works have been completely lost in Telugu, though a verj' few Jaina works have survived. The Tamils do not divide their literature into Buddhist, Jaina and other periods, because their literature contains works by Buddhist and Jaina authors at different times. With regard to Buddhist works in Tamil, it may be said that they are very few; and they occur along with works of Jainas and others at different periods till the 11th century. As instances there may be mentioned Manimekhalai and Kundakdwsi, two of the five great kdvyas in Tamil, which go back to the Sangam pen 00, and the grammar Virasoliyam of the 1 1th century. Whether there was a Buddhist period in Kannada or no. Its literature, such as it is, is of considerable antiquitv though no sages like Agastya and Kanva, as in Tamil and le ugu respectively, are associated with its origin. The earliest work extant is a treatise on poetics called Kavi- ra]amarga bv Nripatuhga or Amoghavarsha, the Rastra- kuta king who ruled from 815 to 877. This king was a great scholar both in Kannada and Sanskrit and^aTrLt small \\vork cahed PrasnoUararatnutndld. of which the the tronf \"r f retired W rone. It may be of some interest to learn that 0 HISTORY OF KANNADA LITERATURE •2 Ugraditya, the Jaina author of Kalydnakdraka, a Sanskrit work on medicine, says at the close of the work that at the instance of this king he delivered at his court, in the presence of many physicians and doctors, a discourse on the evils of a flesh diet and on its avoidance in the treat¬ ment of disease. Nripatuhga was a Jaina king, a disciple of Jinasena, the author of Adipurdna, His work on poetics presupposes the exi ence of previous Kannada works,, and accordingly we lind references in it which enable us to place the rise of Kannada literature much farther back. He mentions several Kannada authors that preceded him : Vimala, Udaya, Nagarjuna, Jayabandhu and Durvinita as the best writers of Kannada prose; and Srivijaya, Kavi- svara, Pandita, Chandra and Ldkapala as the best writers of P^annada poetry. Durvinita, mentioned as a Kannada prose writer, was evidently the Ganga king of that nam.e. The name Durvinita, being rare and unusual, may safely be taken to refer to the Ganga king, the only inscription in which the name occurs outside Ganga grants being Magadi 75, of 966, about a century after Nripatuhga’s time. Durvinita was a remarkable personage with many- sided scholarship.^ The Avantisimdarlkathdsdra^ discovered some years ago by the .Madras Oriental Manuscripts Library, gives a valuable clue to the period of Durvinita. In the intro¬ ductory chapter it says that Bharavi stayed for some time at the court of Durvinita and that he was a contemporary of Vishnuvardhana, evidently the first Eastern Chalukya king, and of Simhavishnu, the Pallava king of Kanchi. Briefly, the account gh^en of Bharavi runs thus: — In the ^ His Nallala plates {Mysore Archaeological Report for 1924, p. 70), des¬ cribe his scholarship thus : o' vJ od oSjtipri si si '3 ^ 0^ ^0 rljoC srsri S3^. wTs). v ^ v_) J wO — S O vS? 0 «> si 3 s'ooZJdo ?r3d:j ^ -j » _# >A .i t. <V^ vJ ^ Jisi sdre ?Dc:‘S).i5DSj2»f1o si i Tido-c- siddocrssio^rs, ^ .r# sJ 0 vJ 'A ®) ^ si h wciojs3r» jic si ^ T-N- dsS 53d3i^ ht -T J ANTIQUITY OF KANNADA LITERATURE 3 city of Kanchi in the south of India ruled a king of the Pallavas named Simhavishnu who was a great patron of learning. One day a stranger appeared before him and recited a Sanskrit verse in praise of the Narasimha incar¬ nation of Vishnu. On hearing the lofty sentiments expressed in the verse the king enquired of the stranger who the author of the verse was. He replied thus: ‘In the north-west there is a town named Anandapura, the crest -jewel of j^ryadesa, from which a family of Brah- manas of the Kausika-gotra migrated and settled at Achaiapura. Narayanasvami, a member of this family, had a son named Damodara, who became a great scholar and was known as Bharavi. He became a friend of king Vishnuvardhana. On one occasion he accompanied the king on a hunting expedition and while in the forest had to eat animal flesh. To expiate this sin he set out on a pilgrimage and finally settled in the court of Durvinita. He is the author of this verse.’ On hearing this account the king, desirous of seeing the poet, invited him to his court. The poet caused great joy to the king by reciting his poems. The king gave him a respectable dwelling to live in and supplied all his wants. This extract establishes the contemporaneity of the Pallava king Simhavishnu (c. 575-600), the Ganga king Durvinita and the Eastern Chalukya king Vishnuvardhana (I). This association of Durvinita with Bharavi affords a clear explanation of the statement in most of the Ganga grants that Durvinita was the author of a commentarv on the fifteenth Sarga of Bharavi’s Kirdtarjuiuya. When Bharavi was with him, Durvinita might have exercised his skill in commenting on the fifteenth Sarga of his worK, which is full of alliteration and other forms of sabddlankdra or verbal ornaments and is consequently difficult of comprehension without a comiTientary. The period of Durvinita according to the newlv discovered work will thus be about 600. As stated before, Durvinita was a great Sanskrit scholar. He wrote, according to the Ganga grants a grammatical work named Sabddvatdra, a commentary on Paninis Grammar, and translated into Sanskrit the 4 History of kannada literature Paisdchi Vaddakathd or Brihatkathd of Gunadhva as the • • • • • •/ epithet applied to him in the Ganga grants, viz., Deva- bhdratz-nibaddha-Brihatkathah, clearly shows. This epi¬ thet was not properly read and understood by some scholars who read it Devabhdrati-nibaddha-Brihatpathah and interpreted it as meaning that Durvinita was a disciple of Deva or Devanandi, a name of Pujyapada. It is to be regretted that lis translation has not com.e down to us. It happens to be the earliest Sanskrit translation of Gunadhva’s work. There are three later translations of this work, namely, Brihatkathdslokasangraha by Budhasvami, of about the 8th century; Brihatkathd- matijari by Kshemendra, and Kathdsaritsdgara by Somadeva, both of the 1 1th century. Budhasvami’s work has been published in Paris by Professor Felix Lacote, Professor of Sanskrit in the University of Lyon. The period we have already arrived at for Durvinita is corroborated by an inscription at Aihole {Epigraphia hidica, VI, 1-12). This epigraph was composed in 634 A.D. by a Jaina poet named Ravikirti, who speaks of himself as having acquired the fame of Kalidasa and* Bharavi in poetical skill. ^ (Kavitasrita-Kalidasa-Bharavi- Kirtih.) For the fame of Bharavi as a great poet to spread to the south we have to postulate a period of about half a century, and this fact, too, confirms the period of Durvinita as about 600. Kannada inscriptions make their appearance from about the 5th century, which indicate an older stage of the language, as will be shown later on, than that found in Kavirdjatndrga. Besides the authors named by Nripatunga, Syamakundacharya appears, according to Indranandi's Srutdvaf to have written Prdbhrita in Kannada. When speaking of the greatness of the Kannada language in his Sabddnusdsana, Bhattakalanka (1604) says: ‘Nor is Karnataka a language unused for scientific o 5 ANTIQUITY OF KANNADA LITERATURE purposes. For, in it was written the great work called Ckilddmani, 96,000 verse-measures in extent, a com¬ mentary on the Tattvdrthamahdsdstra.’^ And from Indranandi’s Srutdvatdra^ and Devachandra’s Rdjdvalt- kathe, we learn that the author of this voluminous Kannada commentary was Tumbuluracharya, who, judg¬ ing from the pedigree of Jaina gurus given at the end of Chdmundardyapurdna (978), appears to have lived along with the above-mentioned Syamakundacharya in about the middle of the 7th century. This voluminous work of the 7th century presupposes the e.xistence of an earlier literature and a widespread cultivation of the language. From the Sravana Bejgoja inscription 67, of 1129, w'e learn that Srivardhadeva, a crest-jewel of poets, was the author of a great poem named Chuldtnani and that he was thus praised by Dandi.^ Siva bore the Ganga on the tip of his matted hair, O Srivardhadeva! you bear Sarasvati on the tip of your tongue! From the simila¬ rity of the name Chudarnani, Srivardhadeva has been identified with Tumbuluracharya. But this, I am in¬ clined to think, is a mistake. The great poem Chuld- mani and the commentary Chiiddmani cannot be the same. I venture to think that the reference is to the Tamil poem Chuldmani attributed to Tolamolidevar, othenvise known as Srivardhadevar. Chuldmani is a classical Jaina poem in Tamil, considered as one of the five well-known minor poems in that language, written during the rule of the Karvetti king Vijaya, whose period is not definitely known. S'e) ^0^\"? 'j 2 sj .-3 \" 6 HISTORY OF KANNADA LITERATURE It has been stated above that Kannada inscriptions of an earlier period than Kavirajamarga show an older stage of the language. To illustrate this statement I give below some extracts from early inscriptions: Early Inscriptions prior to Nripotimga^ s Period 1. Chikmagalur 50 (c. 500). Cj SJ 2.

According to tradition there were three Tamil bahgams or Academies at long intervals in different places. The following particulars are given about them in Nakkirar^s commentary on Iraiyanar’s Agapporul: — The first academy was established at Southern Madura, now submerged in the Indian ocean. Its members were 549 in number, including among others Agastya, its president, and the gods Siva and Subrah- manya; and the number of authors who obtained its approval for their works was 4,449. It v/as patronised by 89 Pandya kings, of whom 7 were also poets, and lasted for 4,440 years. The second academy had its seat at Kapatapuram, also subrnerged iii the ocean. Its members, including Agastya, his disciple Tolkappiya and others, were 59 in number, the number of poets whose works were passed by It being 3,700. It received the patronage of 59 Pandva lungs, 5 whom were also learned scholars, and con¬ tinued for 3,700 Years. 1 he third academy was founded at Northern Madura its members were 49 in number, including Nakkirar its president, Kapilar, Paranar, Sittalai Sattanar and others the number of authors who obtained its approval for their writings being 449. It was patronised by 49 Pandva kings 3 of whom were also poets, and lasted for l,850years. hki • be subjected to strict hismrical criticism, most of them will have to be rejected 8 HISTORY OF KANNADA LITERATURE as pure myths. The number of members of the aca¬ demies and of the kings who patronised them, as also of the poets whose works were passed by them, and the long periods during which they are said to have existed, look incredible. Some scholars are therefore inclined to think that the account given above is a later fabrication foisted on the early au\"^hor Nakkirar. Kavapapuram of the Pandyas is, hov/evt., mentioned in Vahnlki-Rdmci- yana as full of gold and adorned with pearls^ and must therefore be an ancient city. The existence of the aca¬ demies may be a fact, though the details given about them may not be credible. They exercised a great authority over Tamil literature and were something like literary associations including among its members the best poets and learned men of the age. Any work not approved of by them was looked upon as a very inferior production. The members of these learned corporations maintained a strict monopoly of literary reputation so ^ that it was not an easy matter to have works, however excellent, recognised by them. According to some scholars the accounts of the first two academies contain much legendary matter so that it is difficult to admit them within the pale of real history. Such, how^ever, does not seem to them to be the case with the third academy. The third academy was by far the most important, almost all the classical w^orks of Tamil literature that have come down to us, including a good number by Jaina authors, being nroductions which received the imprimatur of this Sangam. Opinion is divided among scholars about the period of the third Sangam, i )me assigning to it the second century A.D., some it 5th century and others the 8th century. The 2nd century is arrived at by the fact that Gajabahu, a king of Ceylon who ruled in the middle of the 2nd century, was, according to the poem Silap- padikdram present at the installation of the Goddess u _s * ' _s i ^ 41, 19. 9 ANTIQUITY OF KANNADA LITERATURE Pattini conducted by the Chera king Senguttuvan. The 8th century is objected to on the ground that Nakkirar. a poet of the third Sahgam, is referred to in his Devciram by Appar, a contemporary of Siruttondar who fought at the battle of Vatapi which took place in 642. The balance of opinion among Tamil scholars appears to be in favour of the Gajabahu synchronism, which will carry back the antiquity of Tamil literature to the earliest centuries of the Christian era. But Sittalai Sattanar, author of the Tamil epic Mani~ mekhalai^ which is considered to be a work of the third Sahgam, and has been assigned by several Tamil scholars to the 2nd century, has regularly translated Dihnaga's Nydyapravesa in lines 110 to 474 of the chapter known as Tavattirampundii tanimam KettaKadai of his work. So he must be posterior to Dihnaga who is supposed to be not earlier than the 4th century. But Tamil scholars •/ may say that both the authors may have derived the information from an earlier common source. This is not> however, likely, as the following extracts from the Tamil and Sanskrit works will show the only difference being a few additional explanatory words in the Tamil passage: I. 11. 122-24'. ^ V ef) es o -c- es ' (JS r- a W O' ^ ^ ^ ~\"e£) ^ .-I II. 11. 147-171. ^j'Cr'j) j 3cJ^ w c) — 1 4 Q ■ ' OjOoJ^ 2 O Q Os?3S,3, ss;i,i;c3jjp '-^9 'ly o q::ol:s, 10 HISTORY OF KANNADA LITERATURE -j -\\r- o 4 rj es - ^ 2C r^oj.' d:r5eeo=5^JSV^i1.

Teltigu Literature The earliest w^ork extant in Telugu is the Bhdrata of Nannayya-bhatta, the court poet of the Eastern Chalukya king Rajaraja (1023-63). He is generally considered to be the first poet in tl at language.^ But, as in the case of Kannada, poet jal inscriptions of an earlier period have been found such as those of the Eastern Chalukya king Gunaga-Vijayaditya (844-88) in Ongole ^ I am told that some Tibetan manuscripts have the reading ^ I am indebted to Mr. H. R. Rangaswamiengar, M.A., of the Oriental Library, for the Sanskrit extracts. 3 ;3-3t5DdJ5od d:cC0^?jDo Ci,)S Jj 3d I WtS'T'd.o ^0 ?r2o Sdod^ w\"S ?JnO || 11 ANTIQUITY OF KANNADA LITERATURE Taluk (Madras Epigraphical Report for 1923) and the pillar inscription at Bezwada of the Eastern Chalukya King Yuddhamalla who ruled in the early part of the 10th century. Nannayya-bhatta also happens to be the first grammarian of the Telugu language, and grammar • presupposes the existence of previous literature. Malaydlam Literature With regard to Malayalam literature, the scholars of that language say that up to the 10th century the language of Kerala was Sendamil, i.e., pure Tamil. Omitting manipravdlam works, Rdmacharitam by Sri-Rama, a Travancore king of the 13th century, is the earliest work in Malayalam literature. In Malayalam manipravdlam works not only Sanskrit words but also Sanskrit case endings were freely combined with Malayalam words. ^ The real secret of manipravdlam according to Malayalam scholars lay in the blending of Malayalam and Sanskrit words in such a manner as to make the latter indis¬ tinguishable from the former, exactly as the intermingling of the ruby and the coral in one and the same necklace. Tunjattu EJuttachchan of the 16th century is considered as the father of modern Malayalam (classical) literature. I may add that there are manipravdla works in Tamil also. It will thus be seen that the literature of Kannada is of far greater antiquity than that of any other South Indian, or for that matter, any other Indian, vernacular, except perhaps that of Tamil. ^ As instances I give two verses from ^rikrishnacharitam: c3 I I I am obliged to Mr. P. R. Subrahmanya Sastri, B.A., for these extracts. CHAPTER II POETS AND POETRY Nripatunga (815-7' in his Kavirdja?narga ^ives the uses of Kavya in the following verse (I, 18): \"j *■ ^ ' Ele mentions two kinds of composition (I, 32, 34 and 35), bedande and chattdna^ with the remark that they were recognised by early poets. The former is defined as a composition consisting of alternate kandas and vrittaSy and the latter as one consisting of many kandas along with vrittaSy akkaray chaupadiy gltika and tivadi. He states (I, 50) that Hala-Gannada is quite appropriate in ancient poems, but insipid in works of the present time like association with an old woman. According to him mix-* ture of Kannada with Sanskrit is harsh toThe ear (1, 52), but mixture of Kannada with Sama-Samskrita is pleasant to the ear like music (I, 54), while mixture of Kannada and Sanskrit in compounds is disagreeable like mixing drops of buttermilk with boiling milk (I, 57). He con¬ demns unnecessary use of expletives such as antCy mattey gadaniy etc., in the following verse (H, 12): 3DO ^eso dtiO j =^v. - ^ ^ <v) I rr, II We may now consider he several species of composi¬ tion which Nagavarma names and defines at the close of his Kdvydvalokana, He begins with the statement that com¬ position is of three kinds — prose, poetry and both combined, and tells us that a work written in prose is called Kathd (or tale) or Akhydyika (or narrative), that when composed in verse and continued in a number of cantos (Sarga) it is styled a great poem, and that when written in prose and verse it is termed Champu, Again, POETS AND POETRY 13 a piece of poetry, complete in a single stanza, is called ldukungabbam\\ where complete in a number of stanzas (usually five), it is known as Kulaka\\ and when it consists of a number of independent stanzas, it is termed Kdsa. Further, a poem which may extend to twelve stanzas, some of which are in the kanda metre interspersed with some in the metre of one of the well-knowm vrittas^ is styled melvddu: that which consists of 15 or 25 stanzas is called • ^ padu; that which is made up of a number of padus is known as padugabbam, to which class likewise melvddu and bedande-gabbam belonged; and lastly, that which consists of stanzas composed in a variety of metres is termed bdjane-gabbam. Of the above, melvddu, bedande- gabbam and bdjane-gabbam, which are peculiar to Kan¬ nada, appear to have been sung with or without the accompaniment of a musical instrument, as is evident from the words pddu (song) and bdjane (playing upon a musical instrument). As stated above, Nripatuhga men¬ tions two kinds of composition styled bedande 'AwAchatldna. As hJagavarma s dehnition of bajane-gabbath nearly agrees ivith that of chattdna, it may be concluded that they are identical. Besides, a comparison of Nagavarma’s defi¬ nition of melvddu with that of bedande leads one to think that the latter is probably another name for the former. IVfost of the above kinds of composition have not survived to our times. Among the extant Kannada works, Janna’s icisddhciYcichci'i itu (1209) is perhaps the only one that seems to answer to the description of melvddu. Some of Nagavarma’s observations on poets and poetry deserve notice. Though men may reach the farther s lore of the sea of learning, ir is only the fortunate among thern that becom.e possessors of the world-famed gem of poetical power (v. 425). A poet ought to exercise as great care m tne selection and use of words and expres¬ sions as a garland-maker in the selection and use of flowers (v. 498).' However slight the blemish in the ^ I 14 HISTORY OF KANNADA LITERATURE body of the woman, poetry, the fame acquired through her wtII also become sullied, just as a mirror is obscured by a shadow (v. 428). Consequently, he who is desirous of acquiring unsullied fame cannot be too scrupulous in avoiding blemishes in his composition (v. 429). Verses 55, 65, 209 and 299, which are quoted by Nagavarma from earlier w^orks, also contain interesting observations on poets ar ’ poetry. Verse 55 condemns the combination of Kannada and Sanskrit words in com- position, comparing it to the stringing together of pearls and pepper-corns. We have already seen that Nripatuhga compares it to the mixing of drops of butter-milk with boiling milk; Nayasena (1112) characterises it as a mixing together of clarified butter and oil. According to verse 65, there is as much difference between good and bad poetry as there is between a lute and a wooden stool. Verse 209 states that the heart which is not capti¬ vated by elegant poetry is a stony heart which it is impossible even for the arrow of the god of Love to pierce. Verse 299 asks, ‘Is he to be reckoned a poet whose obscure effusions require for their comprehension a number of glossaries and commentaries.^’ In connection with the simile of a garland-maker to a poet mentioned above, the following observation of Janna is worthy of note: ‘Just as a garland, beautifully prepared, must fade in the absence of worthy wearers, even so must a work^ CO d.doo 5^2^ rio || ti- o :j \" Cp.

POETS AND POETRY 15 excellently composed, prove useless in the absence of worthy scholars to appreciate it.’* A few words may be said here about the Poetical conventions (Kavi-samaya) dealt with in four sections in the fifth chapter of Kdvydvalokana. The first section treats of those conceits which, though they have no foundation in fact, are still embodied in poetry as if they were true, e.g., the Chakora bird drinking the moonlight, lotuses growing in rivers, swans and other birds haunting all receptacles of water. The second section deals with those things which, though they undoubtedly exist, are considered as non-existent for practical purposes, e.g., the fruit in the Asoka tree, the Jati flower in spring, the blooming of lilies during the day. The third section speaks of the limitation with regard to time or place which the convention of the poet imposes upon certain things, though no such limitation exists in nature. For example, the sandal tree is described as growing only in the Malaya Mountain ; and the cuckoo is supposed to crv only in spring. The last section refers to the identitv assumed by poets between things which are different from each other. For instance, identity is assumed between the hare and the antelope in the description of the moon’s spot; and between the fish and the makara in describing the crest of the God of Love. A great poem has to treat of the following 18 subjects which are styled its angas or limbs or constituents: CO j I I ( U daydditydlankdra). The following verse which states the subjects more HISTORY OF KANNADA LITERATURE 16 clearly is taken from Mallikarjuna’s Suktisiidhdrnava^ an anthology consisting of verses from earlier poets relating to each one of the above mentioned 18 angas. 3)io^o A'ecGj 11 cj o r5 \" The sea, m.ountain, city, king, marriage, prince, sun¬ rise, moonrise, seasons, pleasure-garden, sport in water, drinking, amorous intercourse, separation from the beloved, deliberation, messenger, journey and defeat of the enemy. The terms nidrga and desi frequently occur in Kannada literature. They seem to indicate Sanskrit and verna¬ cular usages respectively as may be inferred from the following stanzas from Sangitaratndkara: ;3Du).o 45,0300 I 'jj * ^ ^ ''u ' Ci^ O ^js^hFiSj^ Z^oz^'^dn^d | d^i^ a3wC3o 3q.Cj03^go 10=^0 r\\^^0 n. dF^O ^d II I may close this section by giving the peculiar characteristics of the Kannada Language as stated by Kesiraja in his Sabdamanidarpana.

There are also authors of other sects, but their number is comparatively small. The earliest cultivators of the language for literary purposes were the jainas and down to the 12th century, we have, with very few exceptions, only Jaina authors. For about three centuries after that period, we have along with them a few^ Brahmana v/riters and a pretty large number of Virasaiva authors, and from about the 15th century date numerous Brahmanical and Virasaiva works. There were, however, during these later periods, some compositions by the Jainas, but most of the literature of later times originated wdth the other sects. The leading characteristic of the Jaina earlier w'orks is that they are champu-kdvy as or poems in a variety of composite metres interspersed with paragraphs in prose. The Jainas also wTote particular compositions such as chattdna, bedande and melvddu w^hich have not come down to us. In Jaina w'orks of a later period the sdngatya and shatpadi metres are largely used as in Brahmanical and Virasaiva wmrks. The earlier Virasaiva works are mostly in the form of vachanas or poetical prose, and occasionally in the ragale zna tripadi metres. The vachanas are written in simple lucid, vigorous prose with the object of popularising religious ^ and philosophical truths. The most recent TOrnpositions of all the sects are mostly in the form of Yaks/iagdnas or rustic dramas interspersed w'ith son^s and some in prose only. There were also some female authors in all the sects. A Bird’s-Eye View of Kannada Literature We shall now take a bird’s-eye view of Kannada literature century by century, from the 9th to the 18th! Authors of the 9th Century We have already spoken of Nripatuhga as the author of Kavuajamarga. He evidently took a great interest in he Kannada country, people and language. Of the poets named by him, Srivijaya, wLo is mentioned as thramhor 2 18 HISTORY OF KANNADA LITERATURE ot Chandraprahha-purdna by Mangarasa III and Doddaiya and highly praised by Durgasimha (c. 1025)\\ and who appears to be named in Kavirdjamdrga itself, may belong to the early part of this century. Gunavarma I, the author of Sudraka, Harivamsa and other works which are quoted from by later writers, was patronised by the Ganga King Ereyappa (886-913) wh^^m he has identified with the ancient King Sudraka in lis work of that nam.e. Authors of the 10th Century It is not possible to do more than briefiy name some of the principal Kannada authors who followed and their chief works, with dates where they are known. Pampa I, deservedly regarded as the greatest of Kannada poets, wrote Adipurdna and Vikramdrjunavijaya in 941. The latter work is also known as Pampa-Bhdrata in which the author has identified his patron, a Chalukya prince named Arikesari, with Arjuna and made him the hero. He states that his Bhdrata and Adipurdna put all former poems under their feet and that he completed the one in six months and the other in three months. He was ther descendant of a Jaina from the Vengi country. Ponna, who wrote Sdntipurdna^ claims to be superior to all other poets in command of both Kannada and Sanskrit. He received the title, Kavichakravarti, from the Rashtra- kuta King Krishna III (939-68). In 978, we have Chavundaraya, the author of Chdvundardya-purdJia, an excellent specimen of prose composition of that period. It gives an account of the 24 Tirthankaras. Next came Ranna, the author of Ajltapiirdna (993) and of Sdhasa- bhlniavijaya^ also know] as Gaddyuddha, the hero of which is the Chalukya pj ice Satyasraya. Ranna received the title Kavichakravarti from the Chalukya King Tailapa (973-97). At the same time as the two preceding \\\\t have Nagavarma I, wKo was the author of Chhandornbudhi, the first work extant on prosody, and probably also of Kddambariy a close metrical version of Bana’s Sanskrit POETS AND POETRY 19 work. To the close of the same century may be assigned Gaj’ankusa, Manasija and Chandrabhatta, who, though their works have not come down to us, are honorably mentioned as eminent poets by later writers. All the authors mentioned were Jainas. Authors of the 11th Century In the 11th century have to be placed Srldhara- charya, who w'rote Jdtakatilaka, the first work on astrology in the language, in 1049, during the rule of the Chalukya King Ahavamalla or Trailokyamalla (1042-68); and San.ti- natha, who completed his poem Siikiimdracharita in 1068 reign of the Chalukya King Bhuvanaikamalla D -u two were Jaina poets. Among the Brahman authors of the century may be mentioned Durgasimha, the author of Panchatuntra, who was the minister for peace and war of the Chalukya King Tava- simha-Jagadekamalla I (1018-42); and Chandrarajk, w'ho wrote Madanattlaka, under the patronage of Machiraia a feudatory of the same king. Chandraraja seems to have been a versatile scholar who wrote on a variety of sub- K1 not many names-in this century, owing probably to the check caused by the Ch6}a invasions. ^ Authors of the 12th Century The 12th century, when Mysore was restored to Kannada rule under the Hovsalas seems een specially prolific in Kannada’ works of high' ex¬ cellence. • Nagachandra or Abhinava-Pampa author of Ramachandracharitapurdna, also known ^as PamZ Ramayana and of Mallmatha-purdna; RajMitva author of lyavakaraganita and other mathematical’ worbf Kirtivarma a Chalukya prince, author 7S£^fdvTthi the *KatIkacharya rpoet-lau^eateT?f''fh’ sive work of ’noedc's’ t ^^^omprehen- grammar in Sanskrit sutras and^i^f/ff ^ Kannada equivalents of ’Sanskrit ^Ss f J^g^adcTaTa? 20 HISTORY OF KANNADA LITERATURE somanatha, author of the medical work Karnataka- Kalydnakdraka, the earliest work on medicine; Nemi- chandra, author of a romance called Lildvati and a Purana named Ardhanemi from its being only half- finished; and Aggala, author of Charidraprabha-purdna — were all Jainas, as well as the poetess Kanti. Among writers of ther faiths at this time, may be mentioned the Brahmana poets Rudrabhatta, author of Jagannditha-vijaya, who wrote under the patronage of Chandramauli, minister of the Hoysala King Ballala II, Kama, author of Sringdra-ratndkdra, a w^ork on poetics; and Deva, author of the romance Kusiimdvali. The Chola Prince Udayaditya, author of a small w^ork on rhetoric named after him, also comes here. Among the Virasaiva writers of this century are Basava, Chenna- basava, Prabhudeva, Siddharama, Kondaguli-Kesiraja and a host of others including a pretty large number of women, w^ho have mostly wTitten ^vachanas ; Harisvara, author of Girijd-kalydna and other works; Raghavafika, his nephew^ author of Harischandra-Kdvya and other w^orks in the shatpadi metre; Kereya-Padmarasa, author of Dlkshd-bodhe in the ragale metre; and Palkurike- Somanatha, author of Silasampddane and other works, w^ho has also WTitten in Telugu. Aiiihors of the 13th Century In the 13th century, w’^e find a group of excellent Jaina poets, all closely related to one another, patronised by the Hoysala kings. Janna, author of Yasodhara- charita (1209) and Anantandthapiirdna (1230), who received the title Ka^ ^’chakravarti from Ballala II, was the son of Sumanoba..a, the poet-laureate of Narasimha II ; his sister’s husband, IMallikarjuna, wrote the anthology Sukti-sndhdrnava for the recreation of King Somesvara; and his son, Kesiraja, w^as the author of the standard gT2imm^v Sabdamanidarpana, Other Jaina poets of this period were Parsva-pandita, author of Pdrsvand- thapnrdna; Gunavarma II, author of Piishpadanta-purdua; Andayya, author of Kabbigara-kdva, a work of special interest from its being written in pure Kannada without POETS AND POETRY 21 the admixture of Sanskrit words as such, though tadbhavas are largely used;^ Kumudendu, author of Kiimiidendii- Rdmdyana in the sJiatpadi metre; Rattakavi, author of Rattamata^ a work on meteorology and omens; and Sisu- Mayana, author of Triptira-dahana and Anjandi-charite, works written for the first time in the sdngatya metre, intended to be sung to the accompaniment of some musical instrument. Of other writers of this period may be named Polal- vadandanatha, author of Hari-charitra, who was succes¬ sively the minister of Ballala II and Narasimha 11, and built the Hariharesvara temple at Harihar (1224); and Chaundarasa, author of Abhinava-Dasakimidra-chariie, a metrical version of Dandi’s Sanskrit work, Nalachariie and other works. The only Virasaiva writer of im¬ portance in this century was Somaraja, author of L dhhatakdvya (1222). Authors of the 14th Century ^ The 14th century produced, among others, the Jaina poets Nagaraja, author of Pimydsrava (1331); Bahubali-pandita, author oi Dharmandtha-purdna (1352); Mangaraja I, author of Khagendramanidarpana^ a work on taxicology; Madhura, author of Dharmandtha-purdna, who^ w^as patronised by Mudda-dandanatha, minister of Harihara II and Lakshmidhara, minister of Devaraya I; and \\ rittavilasa, author of Dharjnaparlkshe and Sdstra- sdra\\ the Brahmana poets, Mangaraja II; author of Mangardja-mghantu (^1398), a metrical lexicon giving Kannada meanings of Sanskrit words; Abhinava-Chandr^ author of the veterinary work Asva-vaidya\\ Kavi Malla' author of Manmathavijaya^ and the Virasaiva poets Bhimakavi, author of Basava-purdna (1969) and Padma- nanka, author of Padniardja-piirdna, Authors of the 13th Century From the 15th century, the authors become too numerous to allow of more than a few of the principal Teluga^nna'^anJlhf of the_ sixteenth century by Ponnaganti Kuchimanchi Timmakavi.\" ' J^amayana of the 18th century by 22 HISTORY OF KANNADA LITER.ATURE ones being named.

Authors of the 16th Century The 16th centur) saw a prolific production of works of the Virasaivj % though authors of other sects were not idle. Among the Virasaivas were Mallanarya of Gubbi, author of Bh 'achintdratna (1513) and Vlra- sawdmriiapurdina (153o); Nanjunda, author of Knmdra- rdma-charite ; Cheramanka, author of Cherainakdvya\\ Lingamantri, author of the lexicon, Kabbigarakaipidi ; Virabhadraraja, author of Vlrabhadra-vijaya and other works; Chennabasavanka, author of Mahddeviyakkana- purdna; Nanjunda of Kikkeri, author of Bhairavesvara- Kdvya\\ Sadasiva-Y5gi, author of Rdmandtha-vildsa\\ Virakta Tontadarya, author of Siddhesvara-purdna, the POETS AND POETRY 23 lexicon Karndtakasabdamanjari and other works; and Virupakshapandita (1584), author of Chennabasvapurdna.

Authors of the 17th Century In the 17th century the literary output of the Brahmanas was greater than that of the writers of other religious denominations. A remarkable development of Kannada literature also took place in the latter part of the^century during the rule of Chikkadevaraja Odeyar (1672-1704), one of the most distinguished kings was not only a great patron of literary but also an author himself. Two of the ministers, Tirumalarya and Chikkupadhyaya, have not only written works of great excellence but have also encouraged others to write good works. Among Tirumalarya’s w'orks may be mentioned Apratimavira-charite, a rhetorical work in praise of the king, Chikkadevaraja-vijaya, a C/iawpw work describing the king’s conquests, and Uitkkadeyardja-vamsdvali, a prose work giving an account or the king s ancestors. Chikkupadhyaya may be said to be the most voluminous writer in Kannada, his works being more than thirty in number. Among the more nnponznt were Vtshnu-purdna (1691), Kamalachalamd- Hatmya {Ud,0), Hasttgtri-tndhdtmya (1679), Rukmdngada- 24 HISTORY OF KANNADA LITERATURE charite (1681) and Sdtvikabrahmavidydvildsa, a work on \\ isishtadvaita philosophy. Singararya, brother of Tiru- malarya, wrote a drama called Mitravinddgovinda. Among ether poets that were patronised by the king or his ministers were Timmakavi, author of Yddavagiri- mdhdtniya (1677) and other works; Mallikarjuna, author cf Sriranga’-mdhdtmya ^1678); Mallarasa, author of Dasdvatdra Charite^ and Jie poetess, Srirangamma, who wrote Padminl Kalydna, There was likewise at the court an Okkaliga poetess, Honnamm.a, who composed Hadibadeva Dharma. a work on the duties of a faithful wife. Among the remaining Brahmana poets of this century were Ramachandra, author of Asvasdstra\\ Tiru- malevaidya, author of IJttara Rdmdyana\\ Nagarasa, author of Bhagavadgite\\ Timmarasa, author of Kshetra- ganita or Geometry and Lakshmisa author of Jaimini Bhdrata, which is probably the most popular poem in the language. Among the Jainas were Bhattakalanka, author of Karndtaka Sabddniisdsana (1604), an exhaustive grammar of the language in Sanskrit sutras, with an extensive Sans¬ krit commentary; Padmana-pandita, author oi Hayasdra- samuchchaya\\ Chidananda, author of Munivamsdbhyu- daya\\ and Chandrasekhara, author of Rdmachandra- charitra. The Virasaiva poets of note of the century were Harisvara, author of Prabhiideva-purdna; Siddha- nanjesa, author of Rdghavdihka-Charitra and Giirurdja Charitra; Pemmisetti or Prasabhushana, author of Giiriibhaktdnddra Charitre\\ Mummadi Tamma, author of Sankara Samhita\\ Parvatesvara, author of Chatxird- chdryapurdna\\ Shadaksh radeva, author of Rdjaiekhara- Vildsa (1655), a poem v ich appears to divide with the Jaimini Bhdrata the honour of being the most popular work in Kannada, Vrishabhendra-vijaya and Sahara- sankara-vildsa ; and Sejjeya Siddhalingarya, author of Malay ardja-charite, Sarvajna, author of the popular tripadi verses going by his name, may also be assigned to this century. POETS AND POETRY 25 Authors of the ISth Century The 18th century witnessed the rise of a popular kind of literature, Yakshaganas, though there is evidence to show that one or two of them were written in the latter part of the previous century. These are opera pieces or rude forms of dramatic representation suited to rustic audiences. As a rule, they are characterised neither by dramatic skill nor by literary merit. The works are mostly based on some incident or other of that inexhausti¬ ble store-house of old stories, the Puranas, and are gene¬ rally acted in villages to the immense joy of the masses. It is not to be understood that there were no other kinds of literature during this period, though the number of Jaina and Virasaiva authors of any merit was very small. Among the Brahmana writers were Lakshmakavi,*^ author of BJmrata and Riikmangada-charite ; Venkatesa, author of the Champu work, Hdldsya-mdhdtmya; Konayya, author of^ Knshndrjuna Sangara; Timmamatya, author of a Ramayana called Rdmdhhyudaya-K.athdkusumamahjari\\ Balavaidyada Cheluva, author of Kannada Llldvati and R^tnasdstra^ a treatise on precious stones; and the poetess, Helavanakatte Giriyamma, who wrote Chandrahasana- kathe and other works. Among the Virasaivas may be mentioned Sankarakavi, author of Chdrabasava-charitre and Nuronda, author of ^aundara-kavya : among the Jainas, Payanna, author of Padmaraja, author of Pujyapdda-charite Padmanabha, author of Rdrnachandra-charitre ' and Surala, author of PadmdvatUharitre; and among Kakudgiri-mdhdtmy^ and other works; Jayendra, author of Karndtaka-Kuva- layananda-, and tht poetess Cheluvambe, Queen of the Mysore King, Krishnaraja Odevar I, wJk) composed Varanandikalydm and other works. The century was also remarkable for the number of popular dSiS known as Dasara-padagalu composed bv devotees of Vishnu, especially of the Madhava sect. ' 26 HISTORY OF KANNADA LITERATURE The Modern Period In the 19th century, a great impetus was given to the advancement of Kannada literature during the rule of the Mysore King, Krishnaraja Odeyar III, who was a munificent patron of all kinds of literary merit and aflforded special encouragement to the production of Kannada versions of all the more important Sanskrit works. He was himsel a voluminous writer, about fortv Kannada works being attributed to him, of which may be mentioned a poetical romance named Saugandhikd- parinaya. Under his patronage, the number of Yaksha- gdnas increased and gained popularity. Aliya-Liiigaraja has written nearly thirty Yakshaganas besides a few poems, such as the Prabhdvatiparinaya, which are of considerable literary^ merit. The Jaina author, Devachandra, wrote in 1838 the Rajdvalikathe, a cyclopaedia of Jaina traditional history and chronology, at the instance of Devirammanni, a Queen of the Mysore Royal Family. Chandrasagara- varni, author of the Kadambapiirdna and other works, was a voluminous Jaina writer. The last quarter of the century may be said to have witnessed a revival of Kannada learning. Under the late Chamarajendra Odeyar of Mysore, encouragement was given to the production of dramatic works of a high order, which were put on the stage. Educated men have begun in earnest to enrich Kannada literature by writing original works, translations or adaptations. Among modern poets who have made valuable additions to the stock .of works in the language may be mentioned Basappa Sastri, S. G. Narasimha- charya, Nandalige LaLshminaranappa, Dhondo Nara- simha Mulabagilu ai d Santa Kavi or Balacharya Sakkari. B. Venkatach ya has added many useful prose works to Kannada literature which afford healthy reading to the public. This survey of Kannada literature, though necessarily brief, is enough to bring to view its vast extent which does not at all compare unfavourably with that of any other vernacular of the South. CHAPTER III CONNECTION OF KANNADA LITERATURE WITH-^THOSE OF TELUGU, TAMIL AND SANSKRIT Connection of Kannada and TeJiigu Literatures The connection between Kannada and Telugu litera¬ tures appears to be much closer than that between Kannada and Tamil literatures. One of the reasons for this may be that the Chalukyas ruled over both the Karnata and Andhra countries and patronised both the languages. Several Telugu authors have also written in Kannada and vice versa. The metre Akkara which seems to be peculiar to Kannada is found in early Telugu works and inscriptions such as Nannayya-Bhatta’s Bhdrata and the Bezwada Pillar inscription of Yuddhamalla. Two of the early Kannada poets, viz., Pampa I (941) and Naga- varma I (c. 990) were descendants of men who belonged to Vengimandala. We learn from an inscription v/hich records the grant of a village in 1053 by the Eastern Chalukya King Rajaraja to Narayana-Bhatta, who helped •/ • « in the composition of the Telugu Bbarata, that Narayana-Bhatta was also a Kannada poet.^ Palkunke Somanatha and Vernulavada Bhima-Kavi, who were great Telugu poets, have written Kannada works ^so; the former Silasampadane, etc., and the latter Basavapuraiw. Piduparti Somanatha has translated into 1 elugu the Kannada Prabhidingallle of Chamarasa. The fact of the matter is that Telugu scholars of that period were also well-versed in Sanskrit and Kannada and it is on account of this familiarity with Kannada that the poet rmatha describes his Telugu as Kannada.\" He calls * oiii | 28 HISTORY OF KANNADA LITERATURE himself Karnatadesakataka-padmavana-keli. Nannechoda, Piduparti Basava, Dhurjati, and other Telugu poets knew Kannada also, as can be inferred from their works. In his Sringdra Naishadha, Srinatha applies the Kannada title Svamidroharaganda- to the minister Namamatya. Nannechoda (c. 1150) uses in his Kumdrasambhava several Kannada words. He was a Chola Chief, son of Chojaballi, 'perhaps id ntical with Mallideva Chola named in Challakere 43, of 1108, and Challakere 21, of 1147. The Kannada words used by him are iSdyi (dog), desi (beauty),^ venchalu (pond, cp. bench and Kolavelii for Kolaver (cuscus grass).“ The chief Bad.dena (c. 1260), who wrote Nltisdstramuktdvali, had the Kannada title * • Annanagandhavdrana. Of the Kannada poets who were also Telugu scholars or authors may be mentioned Nilakanthacharya (c. 1485), who has translated into Kannada Shatpadi, the Telugu Panditdrddhyacharite in dvipadi of Palkurike Somanatha; Pemmisetti (c. 1650), who has likewise translated the Telugu Gnridihaktdnddra Charite in dvipadi of Palkurike Somanatha into Kannada shatpadi\\ ChakrajDani Ranga- natha (c. 1195), who wrote Srigirindthavikrarna in Telugu; Tirumalabhatta (c. 1600), whose metrical translation of Sivaglte is based on Harihararadhya’s Telugu commen¬ tary on the work; and Mum.madi Tamma (c. 1665), a chief of Sugatur who wrote the Telugu works Rdjendra- cholacharite, Kimidrdrjunlyay Saundareiacharite, There are, further, Plubballi Sangayya (c. 1700), Viraraja (c. 1720), Kalale Nanjaraja (c.l740) and Salyada Knshna- raja, among others, who were likewise Telugu scholars. Among modern authors 3 lay be nam.ed Venkataramanaiya (1857), who wrote G dpakhydna in Kannada and Adhydtma-Rdrndydna in Telugu. * It is in Telugu. ^^Ir. Viresalingam Pantalu took Kandavadam used by Nannechoda also for a Kannada word, but it is a tadbhava of the Sanskrit Kandapata. CONNECTION WITH OTHER LITER.'VTURES 29 Cojinection of Kannada and Tamil Literatures • Such interchanges between Kannada and Tamil litera¬ tures are, however, very few. Amritasagara, a Jaina Tamil poet, who flourished before the 11th century, states in his Y dpparungalakkarigai, a work on prosody, that there existed in the Kannada Language a work on prosody named Guna-gdnkiyam and that the Tamil work adopted some of its characteristics, one of which was addressing the rules to a woman.^ Unfortunately, the name of the author is not given, nor has the work come down to us. It is very probable that this author dedicated his work to the Eastern Chalukya King, Vijayaditya III (844-88), who had the distinctive epithets, Gunaga, Gunaganka, and Gunakenalla. This would be the earliest work on prosody in Kannada. Mallanarya of Gubbi (1513) says that his poem Bhdvachintdratna is a Kannada rendering of the Tamil account of King Satyendrachola, narrated by Tirujnanasambandha to Kulachcharaiya after confut¬ ing Jainism. And Sivaprakasasvami of the 17th century has written metrical translations of the Kannada works, th.t Pyobhuhngcilile of Chamarasa and the Vivekcichifitd77icifti (only the Veddnta-parichcheda) of Nijagunasivayogi. The latter version is styled Veddntachuldtna7n, It may be added here that every one of the South- Indian languages has numerous translations of Sanskrit works. In Kannada the Jainas and Brahmanas have translated more Sanskrit works than the Virasaivas. This can be verified by a mere glance at the list of works given in the volumes of the KarTidtaka Kavicharite. In these arcumstances it is interesting to note some instances of Kannada works having been translated into Sanskrit. Nirvana-Mantri (c 1725), the minister of the Keladi c le , Somasekhara Nayaka (1714-39), translated into banskrit portions of ISijagunasivayogi’s and Srimat-Paramahamsa Balakrishna Brahmananda- Rajajogi translated into Sanskrit Ranganatha’s Anubhavdmrita in 1813. » g a u a t n a s 30 HISTORY OF KANNADA LITERATURE Criticisms It gives me much pleasure to see that several scholars have now begun to take interest in Kannada literature, though at the time when I began to write the Kavi- charite there were very few people interested in the study of this subject. I am also glad to see in journals and newspapers criticisms mr le by some scholars with regard to my work. In a work of this magnitude, involving a great deal of study and investigation, it is but natural that there should be found mistakes here and there; and I shall only be too grateful to scholars who help me in rectifying them and thus making the work more useful. Of these critics. Dr. A. Venkatasubbaiya, M.A., Ph.D., LL.B., has to be given the first place as he has paid the greatest possible attention to my work, especially the first volume, his criticisms extending over nearly 280 printed pages. These criticisms are published in the issues of the Prabiiddha Karnataka, They have also been col¬ lected together and issued in the form of a book. Some of the Doctor’s criticisms, such as those relating to the age of the poets, Durgasimha, Chandraraja, Rajaditya and Vrittavilasa, as also those regarding my identification of some Jaina gurus, are perfectly reasonable. There are others, however, which are based on very weak grounds due to a misunderstanding of the points at issue, while there are others still which, I am constrained to say, are nothing but the outcome of a prejudiced mentality solely intent on fault-finding. Though many of the criticisms are not thus of much v'^lue, I have still to thank the Doctor for having given me an opportunity of re-examin¬ ing my position. The D* ctor has called in question the accuracy of my account., of about 35 authors on the whole. It is not possible for me in to-day’s lecture to say all that I have to say with regard to his criticisms and those of other scholars. I shall examine only a few important points among them to-day. But before begin¬ ning this work I should like to quote two Sanskrit stanzas in this connection: CONNECTION WITH OTHER LITERATURES 31 ti ^ vrto I V SJ ^ ' 3cXOv3 cjOZwP^TS?^^ || .zi. ;;b^5ir,0o riorede^^'5 1 r J oj «J ' f-rr — ® j I oco?:^ vjSOwvrC? II 9 from this it is not to be understood that I want my mistakes to be overlooked or ignored. What I mean is that sympathy must form a factor in offering criticism if it is intended that it should bear fruit. But in th' case of the Doctor I regret to say that it is accompanied very often with ridicule and derision without any cause what¬ soever. I shall now begin to answer briefly some of tne more important of the criticisms: 1. Nagachandra, pp. 33-56. 2. Karnaparya, pp. 71-86. 3. Rudrabhatta, pp. 94-115. 4. Sumanobana, pp. 124-49. Nagachandra The period assigned to Nagachandra by the Doctor nainely, the close of the 10th or the beginning of the th century is evidently due to a misconception. He 1 S u Durgasimha, whom he assigns to the period 1024-42, has prais^ Nagachandra. This is not so, the poet praised by Durgasimha being Pampa, who is doubtless the author of Adipurdna and not Abhinava- rampa. Having once made this assumption the Doctor has been at considerable pains to find arguments fo? supporting It and for demolishing my position that Nagachandra lived at about 1100. I give below a few facts which strengthen the position taken up by me- befori Nagachandra lived before 1024 either at the close of the 10th or the bedn- SaS:Yn\"9?3;tTIh^ ^y b k cot^nofbfAe work Cl a contemporary. For the f-v 4-4- • celebrity sorrie reasnn^hL ^ ^ a ^ such ly some reasonable period, say at least half a 32 HISTORY OF KANNADA LITERATURE century, has to be postulated. This makes it impossible for Nagachandra to have lived before 1024. Again, Durgasimha, who lived at about 1024, does not mention Ranna, evidently because he was then too recent a poet to deserve mention. Such being the case, is it conceivable that Nagachandra, who preceded Durgasimha (c. 1024), would praise Ranna’s v’ork in such flattering terms. ^ We are thus led to the conL.usion that the assumption of the Doctor is untenable. (2) There is an important statement made by Karna- parya, the author of Nemindthapiirdna (I, 101), about Nagachandra which affords decisive evidence about his period, namely, that though Nagachandra was a modern {adyatana) poet, he was equal to ancient poets. The word modern can only mean that Nagachandra lived very recently, say about a generation before Karnaparya. The period I have assigned to Karnaparya being c. 1140 (I, 139), the period of Nagachandra may be taken to be roughly 1100. But according to the Doctor, who assigns 1174 as the date of Karnaparya (p. 85), the date of Nagachandra would be about half a century later than that assigned to him by me. Such being the case, is it reasonable to suppose that Karnaparya would call Nagachandra who, according to the Doctor, lived before 1024, a modern poet? (3) Nagachandra praises a Jaina Guru named Megha- chandra-traividva in I, 20 of his Rdmdvana, and we learn from Sravana Belgola inscription 127, of about 1115, that the same guru died in 1115. There can be no manner of doubt about the identity of the guru, since the verse in which Nagachandra >raises him also occurs in connec¬ tion with the guru in .he inscription. If Nagachandra had lived before 1024, would it have been possible for him to praise a man who died nearly a century after that period? The Doctor tries to get over the difficulty by making the curious statement that the composers of the inscriptions kept quiet for a full century and then began to use the verses of Nagachandra in connection with other gurus of the samte name (p. 47). This is simply ridiculous and a gratuitous insult to Jaina writers. The SOME CRITICISMS ANSWERED 33 natural inference is that Nagachandra lived at about 1 100. This will easily explain the instance of Srutakirti given by the Doctor (p. 45). (4) An author named Meghachandra is stated to have written in 1148 an easy Kannada commentary on Pujyapada’s Samddhi-sataka for the use of the son ^ the celebrated Pampa {hid. Ant., XII. 20). The reference here is clearly to Nagachandra and the statement fixes his period as about 1100. This Meghachandra is most probably identical with the one mentioned in Sravana Belgoja 66 as the oldest disciple of Nayakirti and as a colleague of Adhyatmi-Balachandra. The doctor’s state¬ ment that Adhyatmi-Balachandra lived in 1231 has no basis to stand upon. (5) Finally, as already stated by me (I, 449), there is every probability of the inscription of Vikramaditva VI (1076-1126), No. A. 23, kept in the Bijapur MuLum, having been written by Nagachandra, judging from the close similarity in idea and expression of several verses of the inscription to those in Pampa-Rdindyana (see p. 56^ below.) This fact, too, leads us to the inference that Nagachandra should have flourished at about 1100. There are also a few more points dealt with by the Doctor mcidentally in his article on Nagachandra (pp. 36-42 and 32-56), which have now to be briefly noticS. He rightly criticises my identification of some of the others of the same name, such as that of Meghachandra-traividya of S.B. 127, who died in 1 1 13, With his namesakes mentioned in S B 69 and and ,ha, of Balachandra of Vakra-gachchha »*r Sub: . Balachandra of S.B. 140 (I 102-3) My chief object m this connection has been to show that there were two Balachandras, one of Vakra-gachchha who was the guru of Nagachandra and lived af about 1100 1 180 ^Tl”^ ^ustaka-gachchha who lived at about 80. The Doctor, however, makes the assumption that these two gurus were contemporaries and tries to adiii^t facts to this preconceived notion of his u Mfing (p. 36) that ,he date of S B 69 »h e„ about 1100, must be about 1 180. This mscripti™?s'nM 3 34 HISTORY OF KANNADA LITERATURE dated. It tells us that Balachandra of Vakra-gachchha was a colleague of Gauladeva, who was a disciple of Gopanandi, though at the close it likewise says that he was a colleague of Triratnanandi, a disciple of Maghanandi who was a colleague of Gopanandi. In either case it is clear that Balachandra of Vakra-gachchha came im¬ mediately after Gopa: indi and was not removed from him by a long interval of time. Now, Chennarayapatna 148 records a grant to this same Gopanandi by the Hoysaja King Ereyanga, son of Vinayaditya, in 1094. Consequently theperiodof Balachandra of Vakra-gachchha may safely be taken to be about 1100 which is exactly the date that I have assigned to S.B. 69. And this must also be the approximate period of his disciple Nagachandra. The Doctor quotes three inscriptions in support of his assumption that Vakra-gachchha Balachandra was a contemporary of Adhyatmi Balachandra who lived in about 1180. But from what has been stated above, it is clear that his assumption is wrong. Let us see what these inscriptions have to say in the matter. The first is an inscription at Kalasapura, published on pp. 36-39 of Mysore Archceological Report for 1923, which records a grant to a Jaina guru named Balachandra in 1176 by Kavadamayya’s Devisetti, on behalf of the Viraballala- Jinalaya erected by himself. After giving the spiritual pedigree of Vakra-gachchha Balachandra just like S.B. 69, the inscription proceeds to say that his lay disciple was Kavadamayya’s Anuvantayya and that four generations after the latter (details nartly gone) came Kavadamayya’s Devisetti, the donor, ^t will thus be seen that Vakra- gachchha Balachandra, who was the guru of Kava- damayya’s Anuvantayya, an ancestor of Kavadamayya’s Devisetti, cannot be identical with Balachandra, the con¬ temporary of the donor. This Balachandra was evidently Adhyatmi Balachandra who, as we know from S.B. 234, of about 1180, was a contemporary of Kavadamayya's Devisetti. The second inscription is Belur 129 of 1196. This records a grant by certain persons for the God Mallinatha set up by them in the enclosure of the SOME CRITICISMS ANSWERED 35 Santinatha-basti erected by Kavadamayya’sDevisetti. This grant may have been made after Devisetti’s time. The inscription begins with a verse in praise of Vakra-gachchha Balachandra and states that some land was purchased by the donors from Ramachandra, disciple of Balachandra of Mandavi. The Doctor hastily concludes from this that Vakra-gachchha Balachandra lived at the time of the record, i.e., in 1196 and that he was identical with Balachandra of Mandavi. Such is not at all the case. The verse in praise of Vakra-gachchha Balachandra occurs at the beginning because he was, as we saw in the Kalasapur inscription, the Kula-guru of Kavadamayya’s Devisetti. I need not say that Balachandra of Mandavi has nothing to do with his namesake of Vakra-gachchha; nor has he anything to do with Adhyatmi Balachandra-; he appears to be a different man altogether. The third inscription, o.B. 186, registers a grant in 1231 by Gommata-Setti, son of Paduma Setti who was a lav disciple of Adhvatmi Balachandra. It will be seen that this grant was made two generations after Adhyatmi Balachandra and conse¬ quently there is no ground to suppose,- as the Doctor has done, that he lived in 1231. The Doctor takes me to task for using the word mlta thinks, of Niiina and writes two paees (a3-o4) on the matter for my edification. Anv one who naa paiu some attention to the synonym abhinava given bv me for nuta and to the distinction that I make between iiuta and vrnuta, which are but synonyms (I, 100) would at once see that nuta was but a printer’s mikke for nutnl he Doctor may have had the charity of crediting me with a httle knowledge of Sanskrit though not wifh 2 high a proficiency in it as his own ^ ^ tR that we have to believe that Nagachandra was himself the author of Jinamuni tanaya til satisfactory evidence to the contrary ifforth coming. He argues thus: ‘Though there is no^imilaritv between the style of Ponna’s Santipuram an^^t oV ymaksharamale, the latter work is Llieved to be his has .0 bs believed .hough ,he S If linZ'S 36 HISTORY OF KANNADA LITERATURE and this are not similar.’ Any Kannada scholar who is sufficiently familiar with classical poems in that language will at once see that there is perfect similarity in the styles of Ponna’s two works, whereas the styles of Naga- chandra’s other works and Jinamunitanaya are as dis¬ similar as anything can be. He will never do the injustice of attributing such modern forms as K^uva, peluva chinimaya and koluva to Nagachandra, besides gram¬ matical errors of various kinds. I am constrained to say that in this matter the Doctor is not competent to pronounce an opinion. Comparison of a few verses of the Bijdpur inscription with those of Pampa-Rdmdyana.

My statement that the Silahara King Gandaraditya had the other names Govardhana, Gopana and Sribhushana and that he had^four sons, namely, Vijayaditya, Lakshmana, Vardhamana and Santa must have been made on the authority of some manuscript that I have used, though the two manuscripts A. 52 and 4 of Nemindthapiirdna, now available in the Mysore Oriental Library, which are identical wfith each other, do not.give this information. I have been trying to procure another manuscript of the work for the last six months, but with¬ out success. In the meanwhile, I may mention, however, that the Eksambi inscription of Vijayaditya, of 1165 {Mysore Archceological Report for 1916, 48-50), which has been referred to by the Doctor (p. 85), states that Vijaya¬ ditya was the eldest son of Gandaraditya, thus showing that the former had a younger brother or brothers. Further the title Rupanarayana of Gandaraditya and Vijayaditva was also borne by Lakshmana (p. 80, verse 27), though to the throne. Again, my statement hv R* ^ Nemichandra were patronised by the Ra|ta King Lakshmideva of Saundatti (I, Kannada Introduction, 17, Mysore Archceological Report for 1916 50) as also the statement that the tw'o poets wrote their works under the patronage of the Silaharas (II, English and corrertion '^t^'^'^'^tions, 10 and 16 respectively) requires or patronised by Lakshmana or Lakshmideva during the rule of the Silahara king 38 HISTORY OF KANNADA LITERATURE Vijayaditya and Nemichandra by King Lakshmideva, son of the Ratta King of Saundatti, Kaitavirya III. The cause of the confusion can easily be realised when one thinks of the identity of the names (Lakshmideva) of the two chiefs, as also of the identity of the names (Chandrika- devi) of their wives. With regard to the period of Karnaparya, as stated before, he wrote his wc.k during the reign of Vijayaditya. We learn from inscriptions that Vijayaditya ruled in the years 1143, 1153 {Dynasties of 'Kanarese Districts^ 545) and 1165 (Eksambi inscription, mentioned above). But as Karnaparya says that he wrote his work at the instance of Sribhushana (Gandaraditya), it is likely that the com¬ position of his work was begun sometime before 1143. I have therefore given c.1140 as the poet's date. There is no ground for the date 1174, given by the Doctor. The Doctor thinks that the titles, Paramajinamata- kshiravarasicharidra and Bhavyavanajavana-martanda, do not belong to the poet but to his patron, Lakshmana; but I do not think that Kannada scholars who are familiar * with the ways of Jaina poets will agree with him. The period of Karnaparya mentioned by Durgasimlia (c.l025) as the author of Malavimddhava may be taken to be about 1000. Rudrahhatta • • With regard to the period of Rudrabharca (I, 269), the Doctor has come, step by step, to the conclusion that the poet wrote his work in about 1218-19 (pp. 95-115) and not in about 1180, as stated by me. Briefly his arguments may be stat :d thus: (1) The earliest a lilable inscription naming L^ma- devi, the Queen of Ballala II, is dated- 1185. ^She could not have been his queen in 1180. So Rudrabhatta who mentions her must have written his work after 1185 (p. 101). (2) The attribute, Paramaisvaryaspadam, applied to Ballala II by the poet in the second of the invocatory verses of his Jaganndthavijaya^ indicates that the king had the paramount title Paramesvara when the poet SOME CRITICISMS ANSWERED jy wrote. Ballala II began to assume paramount titles in 1190 after defeating the Sevuna king Bhillama. Con¬ sequently the poet must have written after 1190 (p. 102). (3) The attribute Rajarajapratishthaniratam applied to Ballala II in the second invocatory verse, refers to the establishment of the Ch5la King Rajaraja III (1216-46) on the throne, which he had lost, during the reign of the King, by his son Narasimha II. This event together with the conquest of the Magara Kingdom must have taken place in 1217 as Nagamangala 29, of 1218, applies the titles, Cholarajyapratishthacharya, Magararajyadisapatta and Pandyagajakesari, to Ballala II (p. 113). Ballala II bore these titles in consequence of the conquests made bv his son Narasimha II in 1217 (p. 114). Rudrabhatta, who mentions the establishment of Rajaraja III on the throne, which took place in 1217, must have lived after that date and before the death in 1220 of Ballala II, i.e. in about 1218-19. Here follow my answers to the Doctor's arguments: (1) The fact that an inscription of 1185 mentions Umadevi does not preclude the possibility of her having been the queen of Ballala II some years before the date of that inscription, say, in about 1180. An inscription of an earlier date mentioning queen Umadevi may turn up at any moment. lV)y date for Rudrabhatta is not exactlv » •»' • • ^ 1180, but about 1180, which allows a latitude of a few years on both sides. (2) I do not believe that Rudrabhatta intended to convey the sense read into it by the Doctor by the use of the attribute, Paramaisvaryaspadam, which merely means ^the abode of power or wealth.' If it was intended to mention the distinctive paramount title Paramesvara, the poet would have used the form Paramaisvarya, the state of being Paramesvara, with a long vowel in the first syllable. Further, paramount titles such as Chakravarti (emperor) are applied to Ballala II even in inscriptions of an earlier date than 1190, e.g., SB. 240, of about 1175; No. 35, Mysore Archceological Report for 1926, of 1183, No. 5, same Report for 1923, of 1185. There are likewise inscriptions of a later date than 1190 which apply 40 HISTORY OF KANNADA LITERATURE only the subordinate title Mahamandalesvara to the same king, e.g., Nanjangud 71 of 1192: S.B. 335, of 1195; Tirumakudalu-Narasipur 31, of 1195-96. (3) It is not at all likely that, as stated by the Doctor, Rudrabhatta had in his mind the establishment of the • • Chola King, Rajaraja III (1216-46), on the throne by Ballala IPs son Narasir ha II in 1217 when he applied the attribute Rajarajapraushthaniratam to Ballala II. The expression simply means ‘intent on establishing great kings (on their thrones)’ and does not refer to any parti¬ cular historical event. We must remember that when Rudrabhatta wrote his work Umadevi was the queen of Ballala II and Chandramauli his minister. We can • • approximately determine from the inscriptions the period of Umadevi to be 1185-1209. . The period of Chandra¬ mauli, at whose instance Jaganndthavijaya was written, as stated by the poet himself, is a very important point in the matter under discussion. From the available in¬ scriptions in which Chandramauli is mentioned, namely, S.B. 327 of 1181, Chennarayapatna 150, of 1182, and Arsikere 127, of 1185, we learn that his period was about 1181-85. No inscription of a later date mentioning him has been met with. We may not therefore be far wrong in supposing that Chandramauji did not continue as minister of Ballala II much longer than the period noted above, and that the composition of Jaganndthavijaya must consequently have taken place about the same period and not in about 1218-19, nearly 35 years after that period. Further, as far as I know, there is no epigraphical evidence to show that ei ber Ballala II or his soii Nara- simha II or any of his successors had the title Rajaraja- pratishthanirata, though Narasimha II deserved it by reason of his having placed Rajaraja III on the throne of his ancestors, instead of the general title Cholarajya- pratishthacharya which is invariably applied to him. Another distinctive title applied to him is Magararajya- nirmulana, by reason of his conquest of that kingdom. These two distinctive titles, together with the title Pandyagandasailavajradanda or one of similar import in SOME CRITICISMS ANSWERED 41 some cases, are correctly applied to Narasimha II in numerous inscriptions such as Chennarayapatna 197 and 203, of 1223; Chennagiri 72, of 1221, Davangere 25, of 1224: and Gubbi 45, of 1233, though these three titles are by mistake applied to Ballala II in the solitary inscription’ Nagamangala 29, of 1218. The Doctor says (p. 114) that Ballala II assumed these titles, namely, Cholarajyapratishthacharya, Magararajyadisapatta and Pandyagajakesari, by reason of the conquests of his son Narasimha II in 1217. The usual practice, however, is for the son to inherit the titles of the father and not vice versa. In anccher place (p. 110) the Doctor states that the title Pandyagandasailavajradanda or others of similar import such as Pandyagajakesari, Pandyarajadisapatta and so on, were for the first time borne bv Ballala II and subsequently assumed by his son and grandson. This statement is wrong, since such titles had been borne by the father and grandfather of Ballaja II as evidenced by inscriptionsj e.g. Nagamangala 76 (1145) styles Vishnu- '\"f J'^hanaPandyakulapayodhibadabanalam; and Kadur 96 ;D “P'^yagandagarvaparvata-Pakasasanam; S.B. 345 B- , Kpshnarajapete 53 (1171) apply the title Pandyakulakamala-vetanda to Narasimha I. This same tit e of his father is applied to Ballala II in S.B. 327 0181) and 335 (1195), Arsikere 90 and 93, of 1189 Chennarayapatna 78 (1185) and so forth. It will thus be seen that no valid reason has been given for changing the date assigned by me to Rudra- to r - ^ myself change it and ChandraZli!' Simandbdna About Sumanobana the Uoctor has written a P-reat eal, 26 pages (124-49), most of which is quite irrelwant to the matter on hand. He has made some guLses Ssed on a misinterpretation of the following verse^oSurrin\" Jn Janna s Anantaneithapurdna. (I, 162, 329)\" ^ ’ The date of Arsikere 183 is doubtful. 42 HISTORY OF KANNADA LITERATURE tirirTsqjO rlC^O Zirt O^^0?T5)C^e),^OX^O ««>v * '0 CSj ?t^03G ^TjD'tjT'.O =S^y=^J?^?3'5)c3DoOiw^^6oiw ^ '-N>> *i) •>v 0 I • Any Kannada scholar will see at once that the verse consists of two sentencer one ending with Upadhyayam and the other comprisi^.g the remaining portion, and interpret it thus: ‘The famous Nagavarma who was the Katakopadhyaya (poet-laureate) of King Jagadekamalla and who was verily the Sarvarvama of modern times was Janna's teacher. Do you ask who at present is the Katakopadhyaya of King Nrisimha.^ (He is) one of the best poets Sumanobana who is a brilliant modern Eana in speech.’ There are two events mentioned here, one a past and the other a present. But the Doctor would divide the verse into two parts, one ending with Naga- varmam and the other comprising the rest of the verse, and take the verse to mean that Nagavarma was the Katakopadhyaya’of King Jagadekamalla, and that Sumano¬ bana, a Sarvavarma of modern times, the tejicher of Janna, a modern Bana, was the Katakopadhyaya of King Nrisimha. No person who has any knowledge of Kannada poetry will accept this interpretation. Verse 423 of Nagavarma’ s Kdvydvaldkana (I, 145) applies to him the epithet Abhinava Sarvavarma by reason of his approved works on grammar, Sarvavarma being an ancient grammar¬ ian who wrote the KdtanU'ci, So the epithet Idanintana- Sarvavarma used by Janna, which is nothing but a synonym of the other epithet, can apply only to Naga¬ varma and not to Si manobana. Consequently the expression ‘ Janna’s teacl r’ has also to be taken to apply to Nagavarma alone. In his Yasddharackarite Janna says that he was the son of Sumanobana and in his Anantandthapurdna that he was the son of Sankara; we have therefore to identify Sumanobana with San¬ kara as we know that both the works were written by one and the same poet. But the Doctor would have the two as different persons and take the word son in the expression, ‘the son of Sumanobana,’ in SOME CRITICISMS ANSWERED 43 the sense of a disciple, to make it accord with his assumption that ‘J anna’s teacher’ in the above verse referred to Sumanobana. In spite of the Doctor’s misinterpretation and assumption to the contrary, Janna was the son of Sumanobana and closelv related to Malli- karjuna and Kesiraja who were undoubtedly Jainas, as evidenced, among other things, by the invocatory verse in Suktisudharariava and the description of sound as a substance of white colour in sutra 9 of Sabdamanidar- pana. The Jainas will never consider Saivas as members of their own community. With regard to the period of Sumanobana, I have to state that he was the Katakopadhyaya, not of Narasimha I (I, 162), but of Narasimha II (1220-35) as indicated by the word mdu (at present) used by Janna in the above-mentioned verse. He may have lived in the earlv years of this king’s reign, but his period must be taken back to at least 1175, since his son Janna, who composed the inscription Chennarayapapta 179 in 1190, must have been 25 or 30 years old at that time. This shortens the interval of 95 years given bv the Doctor between Sumanobana (c. 1150) and his son-in-law Mallikarjuna (c. 1245) by 25 years, and if we suppose, as v/e mav reasonably do, that 1245 represents the 30th or 40th vear after Mallikarjuna’s marriage, the interval is further shortened and rendered perfectly normal. Similarly, the query of the Doctor, namely, How can Naga^rarma 1 1 (c. 1145) be teacher to Janna of 1230.^ can be answered thus. A teacher is generally einployed to instruct a bov. Will any man in his senses suppose that Nagavarma II was the teacher of Janna at the time of the composition Oa A.nci7itondihcipxirana when lie was probably 70 years old? As stated before, Janna must have been 25 or 30 years old m 1190, and there is nothing to preclude the possibility of Nagavarma 11 having lived on 25 or 30 years after 1145. We can thus easilyVstahlish the contact betvveen the teacher Nagavarma II and the pupil Janna. 1 he Doctor then proceeds to sav that I am wrong in saying that because Janna was a Jaina, his parents also were Jainas, and gives a few instances of Hindus taking' a 44 HISTORY OF KANNADA LITERATURE wife from the Jaina community which have no bearing on the point at issue, since a father’s creed is as a rule adopted by the son. He also makes the curious statements that in the period between the 10th and 13th centuries devotees of Siva and Vishnu worshipped Jina, and devotees of Jina the deities Siva and Vishnu; there was no distinction such as fol wers of the Vedic path, Jainas and Buddhists; and even though people w^orshipped Jina or Buddha as the supreme deity, they were still considered to be followers of the Vedic- path, and gives in their support a good number of examples (pp. 136-48) from inscriptions of kings and nobles making grants to men and institutions of creeds other than their own, which can only testify to their liberal-mindedness and tolerance, and not to their profession of the other creeds also. CHAPTER IV SOME CRITICISMS ANSWERED {Continued) Nagavarma The Doctor has made the assumption, without any solid ground, that only one author of the name of Naga¬ varma has written all the five works, namely, Chhandom- budhi, Kadambari, Kdvydvalokana, Karndtaka-Bhdshd- bhushana and Vastukosa, and that he lived in about 1050. He makes desperate attempts to support this assumption * 1 * as wrong or groundless facts that militate against it. His deliberate misinterpretation of the verse Janandtham Jagadekanalli and of the expression, Bhdlaldchanam Kavt-Sutnanobdnana niagam has already been adverted to. The verse clearly says that Nagavarma was Janna’s teacher. If this fact is accepted, the Doctor’s theory that Nagavarma lived in about 1050 has to be given up. So he interprets the verse in his own peculiar way to suit his purpose and makes Sumanobana Janna s teacher. He further asserts that Jagadeka of the verse refers to Jagadekamalla I (1015-42). If this be so. It IS difficult to make out the object of Janna in mention¬ ing the fact, more than a century old, of Nagavarma having been the Katakbpadhyaya of Jagadekamalla I It IS a statement not at all connected with him in any way In composing the verse Janna’s object was to show to the world that he was highly connected, such distinguished personages as Nagavarma and Sumanobana\" being respectively his teacher and father. So the king named r Again^ Jagadikamalla t. Again, m the expression quoted above, which cbn- deliberateN[J\\h°\"'^'' ^ deliberately m the unusual sense of a disciple just to suit She seL „f rarely occurs in disciple in a spiritual succession of gurus V — / y 46 HISTORY OF KANNADA LITERATURE hut it can have no such sense here. We now come to a third misinterpretation in the shape of taking a son in the sense of a grandson in the expressions, Darno- darapriyasiitam and Damodarataimyam. This is done deliberately to support the supposed identity of Dama- mayya’s grandson, Nagavarma, author of Chhandomhiidhi, with the author of Kdvy^^valdkana, Dama being taken to be a shortened form of Jamodara. The Doctor seeks support for his queer interpretation in the commentaries on Dharmasdstras, etc. Authors do not write in an enigmatical style to delude their readers. It is rather strange that the author of Kdvydvalokana names, accord¬ ing to the Doctor, only his grandfather and not his father. It is amusing to read the statement of the Doctor (p. 162) that the reason for the author not naming his father was the necessity for the alliteration in 7na in the two verses given at foot of the page from Kdvydvalokana and Vastukdui. This is indeed a poor estimate of the cap¬ ability of the author as a poet. If the poet had really intended a grandson he could, without any detriment to prosody, very easily have expressed the idea by a slight change in the verses such as Damddardtniajasutam and Damddarapaiitram, without disturbing in the least the alliteration in ma. I have already shown that Nagachandra lived in about 1100. The author of Bhdshdbhilshana, who quotes him under 88, must therefore be later than 1100. He also mentions in sfitra 73 Kannada grammarian, Nava- sena, who cannot have anvthing to do with the Sanskrit grammarian of the same name (pp. 179-81) mentioned in a Mulgunda inscriptii. n of 1053 ‘{Epigraphia Indica, XVI, 54), but must be ide deal with the Kannada author, Nayasena, who wrote Dharmdmrita in 1 1 12. Vikramanka, named in verse 284 of Kdvydvalokana, must therefore be Vikramaditya VI (1076-1126) and not Vikramaditya IV or Vikramaditya V (pp. 178-9). Further, the author of Kdvydvalokana quotes two verses, 185 and 547, which name a Nagavarma who cannot be the author himself, since verses in praise of the author occur only at the end of the chapters and not in illustration of the rules, but must SOME CRITICISMS ANSWERED 47 be an earlier author. Again, the author of Chhandombiidhi has the titles Kaviraja-hamsa, Budhabjavanakalahamsa, Kandakandarpa and Negaltegoja. He is also styled Sayyadiyata. On the other hand, the author of Kdvyciva- Idkana and Vastiikosa has the titles, Abhinava-Sarvavarma, Kavitagunodaya, Kavikarnapura, and Kavikanthabharana, If the authors were the same, as assumed by the Doctor, it is very strange indeed that not one of the former set of titles is found in the latter works, and vice versa. The former author was a great warrior, an Arjuna in battle, while the latter had no such distinction to his credit. In the last verse of Kdvydvalokana Chhandovichiti is named as one of the works of its author, and the Doctor at once concludes that the work is none other than Chhandombiidhi (p. 166). He also advances the amusing argument that because the author of Kdvydvalokana • • who has w ritten a Chhandovichiti, he also must have written one (p. 168). He mav have written one but it cannot be Chandombndhi for the reasons given above. If he had written this work, he could \"have e.cpressed it thus : Chhanddmbunidhiyalamkviii instead of Chanddvichityalamkriti. The Doctor says (p. 169) that later Charnundarayas were also known as Rayas. This only show’s that they imitated their distinguished prede¬ cessor. There is theretore no reason to disbelieve Bhuja- bd.icharita which says that the title Raya was conferred by Rachamalla on his general for his munificence. All these facts clearly prove that the Doctor’s attempt to support his ^sumption is a miserable failure, though he would brush them all aside as of no value. In the ight of these facts his search for other Rakkasaganpas, Chaniun^arayas and Ajitasenas in support of the suppo'sed period of Hagavarma namely, 1050, cannot but prove Utile, bo, every one of the points urged by me H 52-S4'l for .he differentiation of the two Nfgavalnm 'and their peiiods stands as strong as ever. Mallikdrjiina About Mallikarjuna the Doctor says (pp. 182-891 that he wrote Siikttsudhdrnava in about 1263 a^nd that he was 48 HISTORY OF KANNADA LITERATURE identical with Chidananda, composer of the inscriptions, Mandya 121 and 122 (1.354). He is wrong in both these statements. The first statement is due to a misunder¬ standing of the expression, Elele Mahddeva, occurring in the verse beginning with Hanidam-boyyal (p.l86),which, as any Kannada scholar would understand, does not refer to the Sevuna King Mahadeva (1260-71) but is merely an exclamation i ' wonder at the prowess of King Somesvara. From Nagamangala 39 we learn that the defeat of the Sevuna King Mahadeva by Somesvara’s son, Narasimha III, took place in about l271. How can Somesvara who is supposed to have died in 1264 have anything to do with this defeat of Mahadeva.? It is true that Somesvara lived for the greater part of his life at was in the Kannada country in 1236 (Bombay Archceological Report for 1897-98), 1237 (Mandya 1222) and 1252 (Mysore Archceological Report for 1907, p. 4), and might have been there at other periods also. It may perhaps be inferred from the statement of Mallikarjuna that Somesvara, lord of Ddra- samudra, approved of his work, in the verse beginning with Orante (1. 372), that the king heard the work read out to him at Dorasamudra. Consequently, the date, c. 1245, given by me for the composition of Suktisudh- drnava is not at all affected in any way; it may even be a few years earlier. The second statement about the identity of Mallikar- juna and Chidananda, composer of Mandya 121 and 122, is based on a partial similarity of the names and the fact that two of the verses occurring in the inscriptions also occur in Suktisiidhdrnavc . Mallikarnuja is also known as Malla, Mallapa Chidanr da-ivlallikarjuna. In one verse (I. 370) his name occurs in the shortened form; Chida¬ nanda. But the name of the composer of the inscriptions is merely Chidananda. Mallikarjuna’s work being a compilation from various sources, the fact of his having taken two verses from the Mandya inscriptions need not at all raise the presumption that he and the composer were identical. It may be stated here that as Nagamangala 98, of 1229, contains 16 verses found in Mandya 121 and 122, SOME CRITICISMS ANSWERED 49 which are of a later date, the former also may be the com¬ position of Chidananda, its final portion being illegible. I may also add that verse 810 (I. 355) occurs in Davangere 25, of 1224, with the substitution of Narasimha for Sbyideva, and verse 808 (I. 354) in Kadur 12, of 1233, with the substitution of Kali Soyiballaham for Narasimha- Bhubhujam. Chidananda seems to have adapted these two verses from the inscriptions. Again, Mallikarjuna was a Jaina as I have shown before, whereas the com¬ poser of the inscriptions was a Brahmana as indicated by his epithet, Brahmavidyegdspadarupam, The Doctor’s surmise that Sumanobana, Mallikarjuna and Kesiraja may have been Smarta Brahmanas (p. 189) is groundless. I have already shown that they were all Jainas. Other¬ wise it is difficult to see how the Jaina community could claim them as their own. Sankara, Gange and Janar- dana (p. 149) are common enough names among the Jainas. Ranna names a Jaina prince, Sankaraganda, and own patroness, Attimabbe, excelled him in liberality (I. 66). Gangisetti and Gangayi occur in b.B. 23d and 300 as the names of a Jaina man and woman. The names, Sivadevamma and Janardana, are borne by Jainas. Madhura' mentions a Jaina Mallikarjuna (I. 427), at whose instance he wrote Dharmandthapurdna, and Salva names a Jaina Sanka- rambike, (II. 244). The opinion that the names of Kesiraja s works given at the end of his Grammar show that he was a worshipper of Siva (pp. 148-49), is rather hasty, as it is not proper to pronounce such an opinion beiore an examination of those works. Sd7?iardja stat^ent that Sornaraja may have belonged to the Chauta Dynasty (I .539) is nothing but a mere auess and I have mentioned it to be so in clear terms ° The Doctor asserts (pp. 219-27) that SSmaraja was a Nuie! andVio^t in ^^^^^takdvya in fl22 ID t at ^ have stated. His chief reasons are he son of Rr \"hief, mentioned as the son of Rayana and the grandson of Tirumala of the 50 HISTORY OF KANNADA LITERATURE Lunar race in Hassan 117, of 1573, must be the father of our poet, and (2) that sdsirada niirlm sanda ndlvattii-ndlku (1144) is an alteration made by me, the correct reading according to him being sdsirada ndnur sanda ndlvattii- nalku (1444), which makes the date exactly 300 years later than the date givr i by me. These reasons are not at all satisfactory. Wt know quite well from his work that Sdmaraja was a staunch Virasaiva. On the other hand, the Nuggehalli chiefs who are stated in Hassan 117 to be of the Atreya-gotra, Apastamba-Sutra and Yajus-Sakha, cannot be Vlrasaivas, though the names are similar. Further, Hassan 117 does not name Somxaraja but mentions Basavaraja as the son of Indusekhara, and gives his period as 1573. If, as asserted by the Doctor, Somaraja was the son of this Indusekhara, his period, too, ought to be about 1573 and not 1522 as assumed by him. Again, we learn from inscriptions (H. 215) that the Nuggehajli chief, Rayana, was a feudatory of the Vijaya- ' nagar King Achyuta (1530-42), and if Somaraja was this chief's grandson his period would be considerably later than 1522. With regard to the second reason, I may say that I do not at all remember having made any alteration in the verse, though I do not recollect which manuscript I had before me when writing Sornaraja's life. Lven taking for granted for argument's sake. that I made an alteration, is not his alteration just to support a precon¬ ceived notion more blameable than mine, seeing that I had no theory at all to support.^ The reading proposed by the Doctor is, however, untenable as it violates grammar. No good author woulc use the expression, nfir sanda^ instead of the correct form, mini sanda. When not compounded with another word, Nura retains its full form as indicated by the exception, dilru piittitUy given under sutra 82 of the Sabddnusdsana. The same is the case with Muni. Compare Pampa — aruvattumuru san- dandu (I. 13). As another ground for his assumption, the Doctor takes (p. 227) Rayasada Lingarasa, the copyist of Udbhata- kdvya, to be identical with Lingamantri (c. 1530), minister of the Nuggehajli chief, Rayana, and author of the SOME CRITICISMS ANSWERED ^ 51 Kannada lexicon, Kabbigarakaipidi (IL 215). Here we have only a partial similarity of names and it is not at all likely that a minister can hold the inferior position of a copyist (Rayasa). Another point mentioned by the Doctor in support of the theory that Somaraja wrote his work in 1522 is that Salva who quotes Sbmaraja (VIII, 43) in his Rasaratndkara lived, according to the Doctor, before 1529 (p. 224), many years before c. 1550, the date assigned to him by me (II . 244). I do not see how this supports the Doctor's theory. From inscriptions, how¬ ever, we learn that Salvadeva, patron of Salva, ruled till 1559 (see PancJiakajjdya^ 162). Consequently the period assigned to Salva by me cannot be far wrong. The Doctor incidentally states (p. 227), relying on Sagar 163, of 1488, that Kotisvara (II, 145), who wrote Jivandhara- Shatpadi at the instance of the chief Sangama of Sangita- pura, lived in about 1480 and not in about 1500 as I have stated.^ But as this chief, who has nothing to do with Sangiraja of Sagar 163, appears to have ruled afcer Salvadeva (Panchakajjaya, 161), his date would be about 1560, and consequently Kotisvara's period also has to be brought down to about 1560. Mr. M. Govinda Pai of Manjeshvar has also published an article on Somaraja in Svadesdbhimdni (19--8-27 and 26-8-27) and Kannada Parishatpatrike (XII, 48-66), stating that the poet wrote his work not in 1222 but in 1522. His main reasons are given thus: 0/ 1222 the 11th lunar day of the bright fortnight of Asvija falls on Sunday and not on Wednesday as yerse.| But the week-day will be correct in Iheretore the reading must be nalnur sanda and not nunm sanda as I have given.

In .the present case, though the 11th lunar day of the bright fortnight of Asvija does not fall on Wednesday in the year Chitrabhanu (1222), it does so in the previous year Vrisha (1221).^ Such differences of one year are very common in the dates of inscriptions and literary works. (2) The interval ’ itween Kumarapala or Udbhata (c. 1150), the subject of the story, and Sbmaraja (1222), the teller of the story, is too short for the story to spread from Gujarat to Karnataka. I think a period of three quarters of a century is quite ample for the purpose. (3) The style looks more like that of the 16th century than that of the 13th. This is only a matter of opinion and style cannot be looked upon as a reliable guide for fixing the period of a work in the absence of other evidence. If, as these scholars have assumed, Somaraja wrote his work in 1522, it cannot be explained why he names as his predecessors only poets who lived before 1200 and no one that lived in the three centuries from 1200 to 150Q, • not even Bhima (1369), the author of Basavapurdna, In these circumstances I would prefer to retain the date 1222 for Somaraja till irrefutable evidence to the contrary is forthcoming. Harlsvara^ Rdghavdnka and Kereya-Padmarasa My conclusion that Harisvara, Raghavanka and Kereya-Padmarasa fiourished at about 1165 (I, 222) is objected to by the Doc or on the following grounds: (1) Somaraja, who praises Harisvara and Kereya- Padmarasa, wrote UdJ 'wtakdvya in 1522 and not in 1222. (2) Quotation from Harisvara’s Girijdkalydna by Mallikarjuna (1263) only proves that the work existed before 1263, and not that Raghavanka and Kereya- Padmarasa lived before that period. (3) The expression, Narasimha-Ballala of Padniardja- Piirdna, means ‘Narasimha’s son Ballala’, that is, Nara- ^ I am obliged to Mr. R.

(4) There was a Rudradeva in 1162 whose capital was Anumakonda and not Oragallu. There was no Pratapa- rudra then. (5) It is not improbable that there ruled, as Brown says, a king named Devaraja at Pampapura from 1286 to 1328 before Harihara I. (6) As Kereya-Padmarasa's father was Basava^s con¬ temporary, Kereya-Padmarasa, must have been very young in 1165. So he could not have lived during the reign ofNarasimha I (1141-73). (7) It is stated that Harisvara v/as sent to Hampe by Narasimha I. But Hampe was not situated in Narasimha I s kingdom, as it was included in the Hovsala kingdom only in Ballala IPs time (1173-1220). So Narasimha cannot be Narasimha I. None of these grounds is satisfactory for the following reasons: ® (1) I have already shown that Udbhatakdvya which praises Harisvara ^^as written in a.d. 1222 and that Malhkarjuna, who quotes from Harisvara’s Girijdkalydna lived m about 1245.
