        "text": "Daily Current Affairs 29-06-2024\n\nPosted on June 29, 2024 by 812\n\nState of Public Healthcare Facilities in India\n\nSyllabus: GS2/Health\n\nContext\n\nAccording to a survey, it has been found that 80% of the public healthcare facilities are substandard.\n\nAbout\n\nThe government carried out a survey in which public health facilities from states and UTs were covered under the National Health Mission (NHM).\n\nAt present, over two lakh medical facilities are covered under NHM.\n\nAs per the report, 17,190 of the facilities that participated in the self-assessment exercise scored less than 50 percent while the rest, 15,172 facilities, scored between 50 to 80 percent, the report added.\n\nOnly 8,089, which is almost 20 percent of the facilities, scored 80 percent or higher which is needed to qualify as IPHS compliant.\n\nIt has been found that these facilities do not meet the bare minimum standards of equipment, infrastructure and manpower with respect to government-set benchmarks.\n\nMajor Challenges Faced by Healthcare Sector in India\n\nLack of infrastructure: India has been struggling with deficient infrastructure in the form of lack of well-equipped medical institutes.\n\nThe government mandated that private medical colleges must be built on at least five acres of land hence, they were built in rural areas, where there was a lack of adequately qualified, full-time doctors due to living conditions, besides low pay scales.\n\nThere is a severe shortage of trained manpower, which includes doctors, nurses, paramedics and primary healthcare workers.\n\nThe doctor-to-patient ratio remains low, which is merely 0.7 doctors per 1,000 people whereas the World Health Organisation (WHO) average is 2.5 doctors per 1,000 people.\n\nHigh out-of-pocket Expenditure: While public hospitals offer free health services, these facilities are understaffed, poorly equipped, and located mainly in urban areas leaving no alternatives but to access private institutions and incurring high out-of-pocket expenses in healthcare.\n\nDisease Burden: High prevalence of communicable diseases (such as tuberculosis) and the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases (like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases) pose a dual challenge.\n\nEvery year, roughly 5.8 million Indians die from heart and lung diseases, stroke, cancer and diabetes.\n\nLack of Diagnostic Services: The penetration of diagnostic services in India is mainly concentrated around metros and big cities.\n\nMeasures Needed\n\nIncrease in Public Spending: India’s healthcare spending is 3.6% of GDP, including out-of-pocket and public expenditure.\n\nIndia spends the least among BRICS countries: Brazil spends the most (9.2%), followed by South Africa (8.1%), Russia (5.3%), China (5%).\n\nInfrastructure Development: Invest in building and upgrading healthcare infrastructure, including hospitals, clinics, and research facilities.\n\nResearch and Innovation: Foster a culture of research and innovation in healthcare. Provide incentives for pharmaceutical and biotech companies to conduct research and develop new treatments.\n\nTelemedicine and Digital Health: Promote the use of telemedicine and digital health solutions to increase access to healthcare services, especially in rural areas.\n\nPublic-Private Partnerships (PPPs): Encourage collaborations between the government, private sector, and non-profit organizations to leverage resources and expertise.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is a need to adopt technology wherever possible to streamline the operational and clinical processes for healthcare facilities in order to manage efficient patient flow.\n\nAlso there should be focus on preventive healthcare measures to reduce the burden of diseases along with stringent quality standards for healthcare services.\n\nSource: TOI\n\nGranting Greater Authority to Panchayats\n\nSyllabus: GS2/Polity\n\nContext\n\nA recent World Bank working paper has called for granting greater authority to Panchayats while strengthening local fiscal capacity to offset what it identified as “recentralisation”.\n\nAbout\n\nRecentralisation is resulting from the widespread adoption of online payment systems, MIS-based beneficiary selection, and digital beneficiary tracking.\n\nThe working paper highlighted the Gram Panchayat (GP) council members spend excessive time at Block Development offices and District Collectorates, acting as intermediaries rather than empowered decision-makers.\n\nRecommendations\n\nEnhanced fiscal capacity and broader decision-making authority are deemed essential for improving governance.\n\nEmpowering ward members (WMs) within village councils, who currently lack financial resources.\n\nBuilding local tax capacity is highlighted as vital for panchayat autonomy.\n\nThe improved tax collection can be achieved through filling bill collector vacancies, digitizing property records, and granting GPs more freedom to levy their own taxes and cesses.\n\nPanchayati Raj System in India\n\nIn the early 1950s, the first National Development Council (Balwant Rai Mehta Committee report) recommended the formation of a democratic system of governance at the grassroot level.\n\nIn 1993, by the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, the Panchayat system came to be implemented in the rural areas to allow for development to happen at grassroot level.\n\nThere are three levels:\n\nGram Panchayat: This is the village council, the most basic level.\n\nBlock Panchayat: This council looks after a group of villages.\n\nZila Panchayat: This is the district council, overseeing a larger area.\n\nPanchayati Raj is important because it brings democracy down to the village level.\n\nSignificance\n\nDecentralization of Power: The Panchayati Raj System decentralizes political power and administrative authority which empowers local communities to manage their own affairs and make decisions on local development issues.\n\nPromotion of Local Self-Government: It facilitates local self-government by providing a platform for villagers to participate in decision-making processes that affect their lives directly.\n\nInclusive Development: PRIs ensure inclusive development by involving marginalized and vulnerable groups, such as women, Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and other backward classes, in local governance.\n\nThis helps in addressing social disparities and promoting social justice at the grassroots level.\n\nAccountability and Transparency: PRIs provide a platform for citizens to voice their concerns and hold local representatives accountable for their actions.\n\nPolitical Empowerment: The Panchayati Raj System serves as a training ground for grassroots leaders, nurturing political leadership at the local level.\n\nIt encourages political participation among citizens and prepares them for higher levels of governance.\n\nChallenges\n\nUnequal Capacity and Resources: While some Panchayats are well-equipped with financial resources, infrastructure, and skilled personnel, others lack adequate resources and capabilities to effectively discharge their functions.\n\nPolitical Interference: In some cases, local Panchayats face interference from higher levels of political authority or local vested interests.\n\nThis undermine the autonomy and decision-making authority of local elected representatives, affecting the effectiveness of the Panchayati Raj institutions.\n\nWeak Financial Autonomy: PRIs often rely heavily on funds allocated by state and central governments, which can be delayed or insufficient.\n\nThis dependency affects their ability to plan and implement local development projects effectively.\n\nSocial and Cultural Factors: In many rural areas, entrenched social hierarchies, caste dynamics, and gender biases influence local governance.\n\nInfrastructure and Service Delivery: Despite efforts to improve rural infrastructure and service delivery through PRIs, challenges such as inadequate roads, healthcare facilities, and educational institutions persist in many rural areas.\n\nWay Ahead\n\nAddressing the concerns requires sustained efforts from both government authorities and civil society organizations.\n\nStrengthening the Panchayati Raj System involves enhancing financial autonomy, ensuring equitable distribution of resources, promoting inclusive governance practices, and empowering local communities to participate meaningfully in decision-making processes.\n\nBy addressing these challenges, India can further harness the potential of decentralized governance to promote sustainable and inclusive development at the grassroots level.\n\nSource: BS\n\nState of World Fisheries and Aquaculture (SOFIA)\n\nSyllabus: GS3/Economy\n\nContext\n\nAccording to the State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture (SOFIA) 2024, by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Aquaculture surpasses capture fisheries in aquatic animal production for the first time.\n\nAbout\n\nGlobal fisheries and aquaculture production in 2022 surged to 223.2 million tonnes, a 4.4 percent increase from the year 2020.\n\nProduction comprised 185.4 million tonnes of aquatic animals and 37.8 million tonnes of algae.\n\nAquaculture Production\n\nAquaculture is the breeding, rearing, and harvesting of fish, shellfish, algae, and other organisms in all types of water environments.\n\nGlobal aquaculture production reached an unprecedented 130.9 million tonnes, of which 94.4 million tonnes are aquatic animals, 51 percent of the total aquatic animal production.\n\nAt present, a small number of countries dominate aquaculture like, China, Indonesia, India, Viet Nam, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Republic of Korea, Norway, Egypt, and Chile, producing over 89.8 percent of the total.\n\nGlobal consumption of aquatic foods\n\nGlobal consumption of aquatic animal foods reached 162.5 million tonnes in 2021.\n\nOf total aquatic animal production, 89 percent was used for direct human consumption. The rest was destined for indirect or non-food uses, mainly fishmeal and fish oil production.\n\nFisheries & Aquaculture Sector in India\n\nIndia is the third largest fish-producing country in the world accounting for 8% of global production and contributing about 1.09% and over 6.72% to the country’s GVA and agricultural GVA respectively.\n\nIndia is the 4th largest exporter of fish and fisheries products with a growth in exports of 26.73% in terms of quantity between FY 2021-22 and FY 2022-23.\n\n74.7% of fish production was contributed by inland fisheries and the rest 24.3% was contributed by marine fisheries in FY 2022-2023.\n\nChallenges faced by\n\nTechnology Adoption: Limited access to modern technology and practices for sustainable aquaculture.\n\nClimate Change: Rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and changing weather patterns affecting fish habitats and breeding.\n\nPollution: Water pollution from industrial, agricultural, and plastic waste harms aquatic life and ecosystems.\n\nMarket Access: Limited access to international markets due to trade barriers and quality standards.\n\nInfrastructure: Inadequate cold storage, processing facilities, and transportation affecting fish quality and market access.\n\nGovernment Initiatives\n\nNational Marine Fisheries Action Plan (NMFAP): The plan includes measures to improve fishery resources assessment, enhance infrastructure and technology in the fisheries sector, and promote aquaculture development.\n\nPradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY): It was implemented to bring the Blue Revolution through sustainable and responsible development of the fisheries sector in India for a period of five years, from FY 2020-21 to FY 2024-25.\n\nFisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF): it was implemented to create a fund to address the infrastructure requirement for the fisheries sector.\n\n100% FDI is allowed under the automatic route in the pisciculture and aquaculture sector in India.\n\nKisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme was extended by the Government of India (GoI) in the 2018-19 to fisheries and animal husbandry farmers to help them meet their working capital requirements.\n\nWay Forward\n\nAquaculture growth indicates its capacity to further contribute to meeting the rising global demand for aquatic foods, but future expansion and intensification must prioritize sustainability and benefit regions and communities most in need.\n\nMany low-income countries in Africa and Asia are not using their full potential. Targeted policies, technology transfer, capacity building and responsible investment are crucial to boost sustainable aquaculture where it is most needed, especially in Africa.\n\nSource: FAO\n\nCoal Blending in India\n\nSyllabus :GS 3/Economy /Environment\n\nIn News\n\nThe government has asked domestic coal-based thermal power producers to continue blending imported fuel until October 15, and reduced the proportion of blending to 4 per cent from six per cent to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply during summer.\n\nAbout\n\nIn an earlier direction issued in March 2024, the power ministry had allowed all thermal power plants to blend up to six per cent of imported coal with domestic fuel till June this year.\n\nThe move will ensure an adequate supply of dry fuel at power plants to meet electricity demand while reducing the use of imported coal, according to the power ministry.\n\nHowever, the said advisory will not be applicable to domestic coal based (DCB) plants located within a radius of 200 kms from the linked mine/coal source.\n\nWhat is Coal blending\n\nIt involves mixing different types of coal to achieve desired characteristics that meet specific requirements for combustion, efficiency, and emissions control.\n\nIt is used to mix the coal with different types of coal or biomass\n\nIndia’s energy landscape heavily relies on coal for power generation. To meet the growing demand and maintain a stable power supply, the concept of coal blending has gained prominence.\n\nBenefits\n\nEfficiency: Blending allows power plants to maintain a consistent heat output, enhancing overall efficiency.\n\nSupply Stability: By blending imported coal with domestic coal, power plants mitigate supply fluctuations. This ensures that coal stock remains sufficient even during peak demand periods.\n\nQuality Enhancement: Imported coal often has a higher gross calorific value, making it desirable for blending.\n\nThe resulting mix improves combustion efficiency and reduces emissions.\n\nEnvironmental: By blending coal with higher ash content and lower sulfur content, power plants can mitigate emissions of pollutants like sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter, contributing to environmental sustainability.\n\nChallenges\n\nLogistical: Coordinating the procurement, transportation, and storage of diverse coal types across different regions demands robust logistical planning.\n\nQuality: Maintaining consistent coal quality from different sources can be challenging .\n\nRegulatory Compliance: Adherence to environmental regulations concerning emissions and ash disposal requires constant monitoring and adaptation of blending strategies.\n\nGovernment’s Approach\n\nOpen General License (OGL) : As per the current import policy, coal is kept under Open General License (OGL) and consumers are free to import coal from the source of their choice as per their contractual prices on payment of applicable duty.\n\nRegular reviews by Ministry of Coal to expedite the development of coal blocks\n\nEnactment of Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2021 for enabling captive mines owners (other than atomic minerals) to sell up to 50% of their annual mineral (including coal) production in the open market after meeting the requirement of the end use plant linked with the mine.\n\nSingle Window Clearance portal for the coal sector to speed up the operationalization of coal mines\n\n100% Foreign Direct Investment has also been allowed for commercial mining.\n\nCoal India Limited has planned to enhance its coal production through expansion of mines (brownfield projects), opening of new mines (greenfield projects), mechanization and modernization of its mines\n\nConclusion and Way Forward\n\nCoal blending in India represents a strategic approach to optimizing energy production while addressing environmental concerns.\n\nBy leveraging the country’s diverse coal reserves through effective blending techniques, power plants can achieve greater efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability in the generation of electricity.\n\nAs India progresses towards a more sustainable energy future, coal blending will continue to play a crucial role in balancing energy security with environmental stewardship.\n\nSource:IE\n\nFATF’s Mutual Evaluation Report of India\n\nSyllabus: GS2/International Organisations; GS3/Security\n\nContext\n\nRecently, India achieved an ‘Outstanding Outcome’ in FATF Mutual Evaluation conducted during 2023-24 by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\n\nAbout the Mutual Evaluation Report of India\n\nIt was adopted in the FATF Plenary Session held in Singapore placing India in the ‘regular follow-up’ category, a distinction shared by only four other G-20 countries.\n\nIt marks a significant milestone in India’s efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\nKey Highlights\n\nHigh Level of Compliance: The FATF concluded that India had reached a high level of technical compliance with its requirements.\n\nIndia’s anti-money laundering, countering the financing of terrorism, and counter-proliferation financing regime demonstrated good results, including international cooperation, access to basic and beneficial ownership information, use of financial intelligence, and asset deprivation from criminals.\n\nIndia’s Efforts\n\nTransition to Digital Economy: India’s transition from a cash-based to a digital economy played a crucial role in mitigating money laundering or terrorist financing risks.\n\nMeasures like the JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, Mobile) Trinity and stringent regulations on cash transactions increased financial inclusion and made transactions more traceable.\n\nEconomic Implications: India’s outstanding rating enhances access to global financial markets, boosts investor confidence, and supports the global expansion of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).\n\nAreas for Improvement\n\nFATF highlighted the need to strengthen supervision and implementation of preventive measures in some non-financial sectors.\n\nAddressing delays in concluding money laundering and terrorist financing prosecutions and ensuring effective countering the financing of terrorism measures for non-profit organisations were among the recommendations.\n\nSource: PIB\n\nGross non-performing Assets (GNPA) Ratio\n\nSyllabus: GS3/Economy\n\nContext\n\nAs per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio of scheduled commercial banks, may further improve to 2.5 percent by March 2025.\n\nAbout\n\nThe estimate for GNPA ratio for March 2025 is based on the macro stress tests, performed to assess the resilience of banks’ balance sheets to unforeseen shocks emanating from the macroeconomic environment.\n\nStress tests are conducted covering credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk and the resilience of commercial banks in response to the shocks.\n\nUsing the stress tests, the RBI projects impairment or bad loans and capital ratios over a one-year horizon under a baseline and two adverse scenarios – medium and severe.\n\nGross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio\n\nThe Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) ratio is a financial metric used to assess the health of a bank or financial institution by measuring the proportion of its total loan assets that are classified as non-performing.\n\nNon-performing assets (NPAs) are loans or advances where the borrower has stopped paying interest or principal repayments.\n\nHigher GNPA ratio: Indicates a higher proportion of loans at risk of default, which can be a sign of financial distress for the bank.\n\nIt suggests that a larger portion of the bank’s loan portfolio is not generating income as expected.\n\nLower GNPA ratio: Indicates a healthier loan portfolio with fewer loans at risk of default, implying better asset quality and financial stability for the bank.\n\nImpact of NPAs:\n\nProfitability: Higher provisioning requirements against NPAs can reduce profits.\n\nLiquidity: NPAs tie up capital that could otherwise be used for lending, potentially constraining the bank’s ability to expand its loan book.\n\nRegulatory Aspects: Banks are required to report their GNPA ratios regularly to regulators as part of financial transparency and risk assessment measures.\n\nSource: IE\n\nNews in Short\n\nKeshava temple at Somanathapura\n\nSyllabus: GS1/ History and
