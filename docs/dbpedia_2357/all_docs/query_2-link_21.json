        "text": "CONSIDERING TIME in DESIGN -Issues of Design -47\n\n.\n\nPost -786 –by Gautam Shah\n\nAll changes are marks of time. These are experienced, as a mark of beginning of a change, and the end state of the change. And the stillness or no change states are also, marked with time, because these are preceded and followed by change. Between these two realizations, of change and no change, there flourish happenings, signifying the occupancy and activity of the space. Space is a manifestation that exists between the time. The space here is an intervening phenomenon of different rates of change or no change. Such interventions or absence of it, there exists structures of different size, shape, extent and other physicalities. A Space is quantitative, whereas, Time is qualitative, aspect of reality.\n\nAll expressions, be of art, architecture, performing arts or literature, carry the changes, like, repeats, corrections, breaks change of the pace, pauses, starts or ends, as the time-marks. The Space is the intervening phenomenon at the time marks. The intervening space is an enigma, due to the surprises, uncertainties or and conformity. Space seems perceptively variable. But this is not due to altered physical characteristics of space, (like size, shape, extent, etc.), but due to the perceived duration, paces and distance, of time. Such anomalies of perception occur because the mind that notes the time is busy doing many things simultaneously, and without any logic.\n\nTime, has past and present, but has no assailable future. Spaces can vary, but time is unique for every age, location and culture. But, time provides a steadfast mooring for the space. Spaces carry the traces of sequences of time, because similar patterns have occurred in the past. History and archeology trace such time breaks or disturbances in the continuum.\n\nProject management, robotics, and machine productivity, are based on time scheduling (CPM -Critical Path methods). Time-breaks, like, the wait for the next feed, task execution speed, tools readiness, etc., are part of the feed forward strategies. The focus, remains on time, in terms of the duration (short-term or long-term), paces (fast or slow), direction (past-present and contesting futures), or aligning of minor activities. ‘Of all the resources available to us, time is the only one, everyone has the same amount of. Once it has passed, it’s gone. We cannot reclaim, recycle or renew it. We can’t save time or make time. We can, however, spend time. It’s fairly easy to be efficient, but being effective in our use of time is often left to chance’.\n\nThere is strong attitude to consider design in terms of space, and not with respect to time. In early 20th C, home kitchens were studied for work efficiency of the women. The first attempts were to measure the efficiency triangle (space-layout), with optimum 22feet as the transit distance. But no one was bothered how many repeats occur in a work-day and how much time it takes. Soon it was realized, affective transit was in terms of time. Similar concepts redefined, the neighbourhood, not in terms of dimensional spread, but quality of participation in terms of time duration.\n\nAncient Greeks had two separate concepts for Time. The concept of Space, however was not yet part of the discourse. Chronos and Kairos are two distinct concepts of time. Chronos (χρόνος was born Cronus, he turns the zodiac wheel and represents an hourglass). Chronos refers to the chronological or sequential time. Kairos (καιρός), is time of indeterminate period, in which some significant action, is destined. Kairos, (Greek deity Caerus, the god of luck and opportunity, descendant of Gaia (Mother Earth) and Uranus (Father Sky), is the only deity with wings, capable flying. Chronos, is quantitative, whereas, Kairos is qualitative.\n\nHenri Poincaré was the first to combine space and time as one attitude. He argued in 1898 that the simultaneity of two events is a matter of convention. Yet, for years, both continued to have separate considerations, due to the lack of convincing explanation. But, in 1908, three years after that Einstein published the theory of relativity, and following it, Hermann Minkowski announced the unification of time with space. ‘Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two (space-time will preserve an independent reality)’.\n\nMinkowski also presented a geometric interpretation of special relativity, which, fused time and the three spatial dimensions of space into a single four-dimensional continuum, now known as Minkowski space.\n\nSince this public dialogue, everyone, (mainly designers) began talking about ‘space-time’ as a conjunct reality. Designers have intense concern about it because space was considered to be an envelope. But, now space was defined as a gap, an intervening phenomenon, between time marks. A Space, has size, shape, extent and other physicalities. Space was a distinguished by the position, distance, the direction and the reflection of change. Time is the only forward sequential order. The time marks an event, and once it is over it has no past. Time however, has present and future.\n\nWe check time visually through public clocks, sounds of bells, or length (and shape) of shadows, reversing of hour glasses, change of guards at the gates, hawkers shouts from the street, arrival-departure of trains, buses, radio broadcasts, etc. These are momentary notes of time or the sense of an event. Ancient Greeks called this kind of time Chronos (χρονοσ). But time is experienced as a change, in age, lands, seasons, attitudes. The Greeks called it Kairos (καιροσ), an observational experience.\n\nThere is also extra-ordinary ‘longer’ time mark, like for the epoch, the Aion, (for stone age, bronze age, etc.). Aion is mythically represented as, holding a big zodiac circle , the cyclical time. Indian dancing lord Shiva, as Nataraj also represents the perpetual, unbounded, ritual, and cyclic time.\n\nThe Sanskrit word, for time is kaala (kaal, also referring to destructive goddess Kali). Other similar words are samayam or samay and Rut or Ritu (rituals and seasons). Kali is goddess of death or destruction, uncertain happening or destiny. Time relates to Age, and has two meanings. One: It is a sign or measure of getting old, maturation, seasoning, experienced, knowledgeable, but reaching a state of redundancy and elimination; Two: It defines an era or period. The former, means a present, whereas, the later states, the future, or after-thought.\n\nTime, however, provides an assured reality for the space. The concept of ordinary space is called Euclidean space, with three distinct measures. In spite of it, time is made fourth quality of the space. One needs to specify, where you are in time reference. But for this no absolute standard exists, so time is marked as comparative measure.\n\nHindu units of time are range from microseconds to trillions (1026 ) of years, and iterations (repeat or in cycles of Yuga) of it. In ancient culture the time was recognised with body functions and larger universal occurrences, like a wink of the eye lid, rate of respiration (Prana), rhythm of blood circulation (Nadi or pulse), etc. These had some discrepancies leading to search for the cause and rate of errors. This led to many discoveries\n\nPost -781 –Gautam Shah.\n\nMemories relate to mental processes of remembering, retaining and recollecting our experiences. These mental processes are sporadic and do not have any predictable order, logic, proportion or mix. The memories have no latent value, till these are used to relive experiences, traumas or pleasures. The purposes of knowing or visiting the past, largely remains obscure. Often, what is being recalled is of uncertain scale, spread, or character. Memories that animate locations, sites, objects, spaces, places, environments and intra personal relationships, are dominant, but not necessarily vivid. Memories that acutely involve spatial elements have strong context for recall, unlike the memories related to time.\n\nSpatial memories are distinct from Temporal memories (time related). An event is a significant occurrence in a sequence of time. The occurrences of the past are distinguished by the relationship through time. In comparison, a happening (also an event) is a significant spatial reference of existential now.\n\nSpatial memories reveal the state of relationships, between objects, people and environment. These offer relatable facets, at, one to one, one to many, and many to many levels. In contrast to this, the temporal recollections are randomly scattered. The sequences reflect the sensorial strength, personal relevance, altered perception due to cognition and the cause, why-how the memories are recalled. Temporal sequencing begins to be relevant in the context of spatial elements. Spatial setting indicates, location, position, orientation, movement and direction and the difference between objects and live beings. The relationships between objects, beings and environment in space, pose too many variants for any comprehensive consideration.\n\nSpatial memories help form a transient layout with, edges. This offers a chance to imagine the missing clues. But in larger and complex spatial experiences, it is not easy to recall all the elements, and their organization. The variations due to the directional environment effect makes such recall all the more difficult. On a well-traveled road, the back way scene seems very different.\n\nIn narratives (descriptions, stories, poetry, elocution, recitation, films, drama), the time sequences are of different order, as arranged by the authors. Shakespearean plays are set in historically acknowledged (narrated and sometimes drawn or sculpted) spaces. These spaces are established with descriptive imageries within the play and sometimes from the versions that become popular. In architecture, the ‘style of the period’ gets adapted as the spatial image. The original scale, composition and the spatial character are reinforced with evolved motifs, images and symbols. The temporal character of the happening is enlivened by traversing through spatial marks like turns, twists, negotiable distances, hurdles, delays, diversions, etc.\n\nSensorial perceptions are of many types, and their spatial identities are even more varied. Once it was believed, the spatial character of any presences around us, was due to the duality of sensing nodes (two eyes, two ears), closeness of the related nodes (mouth for taste and nose for smell), or multiple sensing nodes for touch across the body. Later, it was believed, the cognition (process that assimilates the sensorial exposures) refashions the experiences. It is difficult to recreate events like music, touch food tastes, smells, due to their inadequate spatial identity. Though whatever is inadequate, is backed by the recall of the past exposures.\n\nThe spatial clues as a combine image emerge from elements like, the surface qualities, edges, form, size, scale, shape, emergence of patterns or arrangements, etc. These are easier to register as totality, but when there is distinct time scale to measure the individual or elemental changes, a scattering of memorable events and confusions occur.\n\nSpatial memory is a form, necessary for recovery of information, conveying the comprehension of perceptions, and logical expression. Spatial memory is necessary for occupying and persisting in a space. The longer (time), one stays, the greater will be comprehension. Spatial memory can also be divided into egocentric (self-centric -one to many) and allocentric (relating to object and object -one to many) actions. Routes descriptions or acknowledgements are prone to errors, and depend on egocentric reference, whereas, formal maps and charts are accommodative to changes and reliable, depend on allocentric reference.\n\nPost -780 –Gautam Shah\n\n.\n\nAn IMAGE is a trace or copy at the same or different scale. As a Trace, the image is either a contagious or noncontagious impression. Copies are reflections, where the scale represents the distance between the object and its facsimile.\n\nAn Image could be an impression on a media, a mental picture, or notion of something.\n\nImages pressed on a Media are ‘im-pressions’. These are affected, by the receptivity of the media (noise -texture, loss of details, ambiguities), and also by the modalities of transfer.\n\nMental images occur in Two manners. The processes of cognition, prompt (expectations), select and combine, many different types of perceptions, into a comprehensive image, and at another level, mental images occur as remembrances, endowing new interpretations and relationships with the existing conditions.\n\nA Notion is an abstract derivative or a surrogate formed of few essential features. It provides new insights.\n\nThe term image comes from Latin imago, which denotes an imitation, fabrication or a copy. It was supposedly, a likeness of the long extinct original, a pictorial copy of a sculpted figure. With passage of time and geographical distance, the pictorial image (of the divinities or super natural), degenerate into an abstract or altered figure.\n\nImage, imagery, and Imaging, are all different phenomena.\n\nAn image, is a real or tangible form, or manifest in the mind. This has strong visual character. An image can be 2D, such as a drawing, painting, or photograph, or 3D, such as a carving or sculptural figure. An image is conditioned by the medium on or through which it occurs. The conditioning results into changes or ‘noises’ (like, unwanted intrusions, scale corruption, colour-textural defects). Images are rel or a visual phenomenon, but Mental images occur as dreams, inspiration or divine realizations, usually, vivid or momentary. These unless captured immediately as imagery can get lost.\n\nImagery is an explanatory (literary) device with rhetorical decorations, symbolic connections or metaphors. Imagery transfers a non-visual encounter, to others’ mind. Imageries are used, in writing, speaking, descriptions, and expressions to compensate for the non-visual expressions (such as smell, taste, touch, sound, etc.). Imagery may include symbols for brief presentation and metaphors for succinctness. An Image cannot handle abstract qualities, but Imagery offers comprehensive ‘sense of the scene’.\n\nImaging is process of capturing a content which can be visual, optical or graphical (as an arrangement of data -a matrix), and is formed through different forms of energy, such as, heat, x-rays, ultrasound, infra red, magnetic, etc. Imaging tools include, magnetic resonance imaging MRI, echo gram, cardio gram, sonography, thermography and tomography. Some forms of imageries, help learning the perception with other senses. Stars beyond certain distance are not seen, but listened through the radio waves. Satellite images offer more data through colour separation.\n\nImaging and Imagining, are two different things. Imaging is a realistic process of forming an image, using energy beyond the human body system, and so nearly impartial. Imagining is the process of capturing an image with reflection, deflection and absorption of external energy, but the captured image is affected by the ‘noises’. The Imagining could be, unreal, fancy, falsified, illusory or phantasms, a dream like process of realization or recollection. This may be due to the other sensorial associations.\n\nImagination is unbounded process of mental image formation. It is fast and occurs without any resources. But most such mental images are often unconsciously generated, and forgotten. Imagination can lead to unknown aspects of experiences, things that cause behavioural changes, biases and environmental responses. Imagination is called ‘silent thinking’, which is creative pursuit leading to solution finding, and allow fuzzy logic for disruptive thinking.\n\n.\n\nPost -779 -by Gautam Shah\n\nTexture is roughness or surface fluctuations, that also marks surface variations between adjescent elements (such as object-parts, object-background, and current vs past experiences vs expectations).\n\nRoughness (or smoothness) plays an important role in determining how a real object will interact with its environment and how a body will perceive it (through sense of touch and other sensorial perception).\n\nIn surface metrology, roughness is typically considered to be the high-frequency, short-wavelength component of a measured surface. However, in practice it is often necessary to know both the amplitude and frequency to ensure that a surface is fit for a purpose. In tribology, rough surfaces have greater area, and so wear more quickly. Roughness (or smoothness) promote adhesion, frictive resistence, and form nucleation sites for increased reactivity.\n\nTextures as Haptic (touch) experience are called tactile texture, physical texture or actual texture. These refer to different densities of micro sized dots, lines, crosses and motifs, in the form of random, repeated, variegated or oriented arrangements. Textures offer haptic sensation on a natural or developed surfaces. These occur on a wide range of materials, including but not limited to fur, canvas, wood grain, sand, leather, satin, eggshell, matte, foods, or smooth surfaces like metal or glass.\n\nTextures relate mainly to the haptic (tactile) experiences, but can also convey other sensorial encounters. Here the textural qualities represent the contrasting conditions. A Contrast is the remarkable differences of perceptions within a class of sensuality. Contrast can be between perception of different sensualities, when these exist synchronically or separately, in time and space. A contrast, as a texture represents distance or difference between two locations or time slots.\n\nContrasts are explored in narrations, reporting or story telling, where the descriptions replace visual, audio, smell, taste and touch experiences. Audio textures are perceived through persistence of rhythm, sound quality, intermittent poses, starts and ends of delivery, timbre, etc., and all these relate to time scale. Similarly variations in aural qualities are determined by the speaker, singer or sound generating equipment. In addition, the natural and built environments reformat the aural texture (reverberation, echoes).\n\nMany of the aural gaps or breaks that cause aural texture get bridged by the visual corroboration in ‘live shows’. Gestures, postures, garments, etc. visually convey more information for ‘back-benchers’. Video recordings are better than audio captures. Silent keying devices make more sense, if accompanied by micro sounds of actioning through the display device.\n\nFood textures are contrasts of visual, taste, smell, besides the tactile experiences through fingers, tongue, palate, or teeth. Real food textures are offset by the smell, and sometimes through past experiences.\n\nIt is a common happening, where the tactile texture is compensated by other senses or even past exposures. The tactile texture is a haptic phenomena and can function through active participation of the body, or indirectly through sensors that amplify or de-amplify the sensation (typ. stethoscope).\n\nTactile and visual textures, though of different classes of sensualities, often the one needs to be replaced by the other. Visual conveyance of textures is used in digital transfer of information (like, digital merchandising through visual means such as static images, films, videos, non-touching display of products or sensors like cardiogram, thermometers, etc.). There are also few rudimentary reverse processes, like braille language, where tactile data is conveyed.\n\nVisual textures reflect ‘the tactile expression’ of a surface, mainly the roughness (or smoothness). Visual textures cannot reflect other haptic experiences, such as warmth (or coldness), moisture, resilience, electrical charges, etc. Visual textures, sometimes, inadvertently convey many other associated values, such as the degree of smoothness through the gloss, colour differentiation between illuminated and shadowed surfaces through reflection.\n\nVisual texture is a false volumetric variation. This is manipulated by level and direction of the illumination, colour and contrasts between adolescent elements (object-parts and object-background). Visual textures are also formed by morphing directional patterns over objects. The surface quality is affected by the type of gloss, sheen or matt characteristics, which in turn are governed by the angle of illumination, dark-light surface colour, and contrast. Glossy surfaces are perceived as ‘hard’ whereas surface with sheen are sensed as soft or ‘handle-able’.\n\nArtists produce or suggest textures in order to enhance the notion of reality. This is done by intimately connecting the source of light within the scene and also through direction of the shadows for actual architectural space. Painters, since primitive periods of cave painting, have taken advantage of the texture of the substrates (natural or scratched), roughness of pigments and additives, and strokes of colour application. The illumination and shadows are so intimately ingrained that resulting object form and the surface texture, both seem awkward in museum displays (strongly lit from top-down) or son-et-Lumiere (mostly lit from bottom-up).\n\nMany forms of real textures are created for their visual appeal, rather than their tactile relevance. Surface textural effects are constructed by indenting patterns in plaster work, or through colour differentiation of joints in flooring and masonry works. Large scale architectonic elements used on architectural facades in the form of windows, columns, pilasters, pediments, eaves, projections form textures. Printed patterns with Black and white added (tonal) colours over leather, fabrics, paper, metal sheets, flooring ceramics tiles, etc. enhance the tactile sense.\n\nChiaroscuro (Renaissance period) uses strong contrasts between light and dark areas through colours, for achieving a sense of volumetric effect in the composition. Impasto is texture forming application to build textures through thick paste like oil colours and strokes with rough brushes or spatulas. Strokes and patches were the basic tools for impressionistic paintings.\n\nVisual representation of textures carry a wide range of indirect messages, remembrances and evoke diverse sentimentalities. Visual textures were means of representing the experiences, or conveying ephemeral imagery, such as in story-telling, writing, record keeping, dance, drama, geographical mapping, selling or merchandising, etc. The fuzzy textural detail in any visual representation implies distance (farness), whereas the clarity reflects the nearness of the object.\n\nVisual textures are also used in murals and paintings to differentiate identically coloured surfaces (walls, clothes, body-parts, terrain features, parts of skies, distances, etc.). Creating visual textures is not an easy process as it can reveal the ‘phony’ sources of illumination. Monochrome arts use etched or engraved surfaces for implying the visual texture. Frottage is a technique of rubbing a pencil, graphite, chalk, crayon, or another medium onto a sheet of paper that has been placed on top of a textured object or surface. The process causes the raised portions of the surface below to be translated to the sheet. The term is derived from the French frotter, which means ‘to rub’.\n\nA Collage is a composition of visual and tactile textures, where the presence of edges become the key elements of expression. Modern day paints and media (paper, colours, constituents) offer both visual (sheen, matt, gloss) and tactile textures.\n\nColour and texture of soils are visually revealed through the moisture, present state of green cover and ingredients of soils. These was once done by comparing mono focal and bifocal visions. Now aerial remote sensing images are processed through colour separation techniques. Similar techniques are used to study MMR images.\n\nThe Visual texture, is also referred to as ‘implied texture’, as it is not detectable by our sense of touch, but realized by our sense of sight. Visual texture is illusionistic impression of a real texture. Any texture perceived in an image or photograph is a visual texture, a static two-dimensional surface. Though video or films, offer little more distinctive experience, due to the variations in capture and illumination. Visual textures are enlivened by other concurrent sensualities, like clicking sound of a key being struck, some food ingredients of a recipe producing a crunching noise, a smell producing cooling (or other sensation) effect in mouth or nose, a seemingly smooth chocolate offering sense roughness on chewing, etc.\n\nPhysical and Visual textures, are evident through the contrast. Contrast is the remarkable difference of perception within a class of sensuality. So tactile and visual textures, though of different classes of sensualities, the former needs to be replaced by the later, as we do not have (yet) the means to record or project the other.\n\n.\n\nPost 771 -by Gautam Shah\n\n.\n\nCompositions are conscious arrangements of the same or different elements. Compositions are also realizations that some order exists, but difficult to explain or recreate. A composition is a recognition of geometry or structure and sensorial experiences, both offering a distinctive identity.\n\nCompositional arrangements occur as spatial occupation and also as a happening sequenced in time. The arrangements have elements linked by their nearness, nothingness, masking, other interventions. The compositions have edges where the spread stops. The spread defines the totality of a composition. For the composed entity, to be a manageable arrangement or perceptible recognition is considered finite things. The finality comes through the formal edges, virtual extent and the sensorial limits. Finalities of the bounds help find the inclusive-elements, which also determines what is not part of a composition.\n\nThe elements in composition, with some form of similarity, create a pattern. A pattern is a formation of elements, with size variations, mass distribution, implied connection by nearness, tacit directionality and shifting in space or time and most importantly the relationship with the edges or frame.\n\nSpatial compositions have strong reference of real edges, frame, surrounds or physical bounds. Time dominated compositions, like performances, exploit the chronological delivery, rhythm and persistence through traces or remembrances.\n\nCompositions are meant to convey something. The expression may be for a set of audiences, which may be spread across time and space. The expressions have feed-forward or feed-back. The first one, trigger a desired action, and the later one, opens scope for improvisation. Compositions that allow evaluation and correction remain green. Static art-installations are experimental, though unpredictable, but Dynamic art-installations thrive on public interactions.\n\nArrangements in nature recognized, both as a composition and configuration, as one may not be aware of the evolutionary process, which came the first, the elements or the bounding? Such arrangements are exploited through the Biomimetics, as they offer a ‘model’ of structure, growth pattern and operational systems. These are superficially imitated, by separation of such aspects. The compositional values, however, need to be scaled for real application.\n\nCreative expressions, like painting, sculpture, dance, drama, music, literature, films are designed for certain effects, within a time slot, continuity of events, conjoined random frames. These are fairly comprehensive due to the efficient arrangement of all elements and elimination of the frivolous elements.\n\nComposition is nearly synonymous with the Configuration. A Configuration comes into being after the definition of form or shape, whereas, the composition can emerge irrespective of the form or shape. In other words, a configuration depends on the figuration or the edges. Configuration derives from Latin configurare =to fashion after a pattern, (1550s, from Late Latin configurationem or the nominative form configuratio).\n\nCompositions have few identifiable elements, lines (linearity, angulation, direction, movement, junctions), planes (extent, inclination, surfaces, edges) and solids (forms, shapes, shadows, relevance of views). Traditionally compositions have been, symmetrical, conveying a sense of stability, and, also asymmetrical reflecting a sense of imbalance, movement or dynamism. Linear elements are diversified or consistent, have a start, end and junctions. The linear element go to the edge of the frame or beyond.\n\nCompositions also have vertical, horizontal, inclined and curved entities. Vertical reflects an escape, a horizontal is binding, an inclination represents a direction and a curvature imbalance the composition. Horizontal and Vertical elements, nominally reach the sides, divide the space, yet, connect the variability of the sides. These acknowledge the real or abstract presence of the frame.\n\nThe use of non formal entities like, inclined or curvatures forms, movements, crescendo-diminuendo, fading-highlighting, etc., allow one to ignore the presence of physical frame or temporal limit in composition. These are often concealed or occur as a surprise to accentuate their effects. Inclined and curved motifs or their placement in non linear manner, negate the presence of a frame. Abstract presence of frames is also related to the orientation. Orientation is gravity, righteousness, start (or end), base of the crescendo or acceleration, fundamental reference or opportunity and origination of the transposition. All art-works like sculpture, architecture, and performances like drama, dance, yoga, exercises, singing, elocution, etc. are ‘oriented compositions’. Oriented compositions are confirmative, but limitative. Oriented compositions represent our worldly encounters, one of which is the sense of Depth. Depth is experienced by diminution of sensorial perceptions, but same can be caused by perspective, scaling, contrast, directional texture, shadows, etc. Time related performances exploit repetition, blanks, sequencing and juxtaposition to form the depth.\n\nRealistic scenes have Horizon and Skyline. Both relate to position of the eye-level. These horizontal lines, remain parallel to the gravity, and so obvious, restful, stable and serene. Gravity in a composition is confirmed by placing, heavier mass like, terrain, dense occupation, textured or patterned floors, darkness, shadows, pleated (fall) gowns, robes, etc. in the lower section of the composition.\n\nIn recent years, Expressions have grown beyond the frame limitations, media fidelity, spatial relevance and static involvement or time-arrange. These have become entities with un-defined or presumed specifics, like visual, literary or performance-based arts. In terms of scale and spread, it has become a participatory installation. The theme or concepts are not affected or owed by the placement, orientation or manner of expression. The manners of expressions have turned to be not just visual realizations, but multi sensorial affectations. The artist’s identity is dissolved, except through the branding by apparent similarities in multiple efforts. Styling is abhorred. Many ‘non-formal means’ are used to cause a mix of subjective or objective experiences. The realizations began with the Brut or outside art, often authored by non-artists, tribal or children (with some deficiencies) and later machine (computer) authored images.\n\n.\n\nPost -765 -by Gautam Shah\n\n.\n\nWe use North as our major bearing or orientation for maps. The Hebrews, however oriented the maps to the East. The Hebrew word for East is qedem which literally meant ‘the direction of the rising sun’, and East defined all other directions. Qedem =east, rising sun-side, Teman or Teyman =right-side of east, south, Smol =left-side of east, north, and Yam =west, sea (for Israel).\n\nThe word qedem (east for the Hebrews) refers to whatever came first (that is the past), times that had preceded, ancient, or the places where the sun comes first. It has a meaning, ‘past is in front of you while the future is behind you’. This is exactly, the opposite of what we believe now, the past is behind and future in front. The link between past and east also means that in the Hebrew mind there is a correlation between front, first, east and past, and thus also between back, last, west and future. The origin of all things could have come, does come, and will come from the east.\n\nThe orientation and direction were once considered nearly synonymous. The Hebrew expressions used for the different directions are qedmá -east, yamá -west, tsfoná -north, and negbá -south. The á at the end, a grammatical suffix to indicate the direction, i.e. ‘to the west, to the east,’ etc. (Synonyms -East=qedem, mizrach, motsa, -West =Yam, Ma’arav, Achor, -South =Negev, Darom, Teman, Yamin, -North =Tsafon, Smol).\n\nDarom (=south) derives from, dar, =to live or situated, and rom =high up. South is the direction (in the Northern hemisphere) in which the sun is highest in the sky. Tsafon (=north) =hidden. North is the direction (in the Northern hemisphere) in which sun never seen.\n\nThe rising sun and the East face entrance for place of worship was common tradition in many cultures across the world. When a church or ancient temple in the Roman Empire faced the correct direction i.e. East, it was called rightly ‘oriented’, a word that has derived from the Latin for east or orient.\n\nAs per, St. Gregory of Nyssa (Christian theologian 335-395 AD), the Orient (east face) contained man’s original home, the earthly paradise. Religious buildings erected by Constantine the Great (Roman emperor from 306 to 337 AD and first one to convert to Christianity), and under his influence, may have followed the earlier non-Christian tradition of easterly or sun-worship.\n\nThe custom of locating the apse and altar in the east side of the church was an old custom and this was also adopted by the Roman churches in other regions. Here the God faced East, whereas, the presiding-sermonizing priest and the congregation both faced West. Such customs were first changed in Roman Basilicas of the later days. The priest and congregation, both now faced West, and the god was set looking to the East and the entrance. The east-west axis for religious buildings and the internal orientation of the activities was not always followed due to the conditions of natural terrain and local alignment of older streets.\n\nThe preferred orientation of East, and later North seem to have no bearing on how some languages have scripts moving from right to the left, left to the right, or top to down side. There is no connection with the media to write the languages, such as Clay, Stone, Parchment, Pal-leaves or Paper and tools for it like, brush, stylus or chisel.\n\nBabylon temples had ‘gate of glory as brilliant as the sun’. It was usual to cover the Eastern door with shining metal for it to glow in the morning sun rays. In Syria, at the temple of Mabog (Hierapolis), the east door was gilded, as also was the entire sanctuary, walls and ceiling. ‘Two immense columns, one hundred and eighty feet high, flanked the door, inside which, on the left, was placed the throne of the sun’. In many cultures of the world, East is the element of Air, and Eagle is the bird of air and east. Eagle opens the wings, and the sun shines, until close them at night. The eagle as symbol is placed on the top beam (eaves). The a person or anything else arriving from east were harbinger of goodness. In Buddhism the direction of East houses contentment and the eastern realm is without distress. Buddha entitled it as the Virtue of Goodness.\n\nFirst rays of rising sun marked a new day. These were received on the metal-clad inclined top faces of the obelisks, finials or caps over tall masts, over furling flags and festoons and rotating Dhrama chakra (wheel). The Sun is also metaphorically represented by soaring eagles, circular objects like a wheel, red disc or the winged globe.\n\nEgyptians, 2500 AD ago aligned the Great Pyramid to within three-sixtieths of a degree of true north-south, perhaps using the averages of sun rises and sets over years. This method has also been used to mark the Sun beam over the forehead of God’s statue, located deep in the sanctum sanctorum.\n\nEgyptian’s temples and tombs had two openings: the Gate of the East, and the Gate of the West. Through the former the sun enters in the morning to pass out from the other in the evening, and therefrom pursue its journey way back by the dark path of the under world.\n\nAccording to Indian Vastu Shasta (cannons for building siting and construction) East is a lighter face (NE is lightest one) and West is heavier side (SW is heaviest one). The word east is comes from the Sanskrit word usās =dawn or morning, where as the word west derives from the word avah =evening or to go down.\n\nThere is a remark by Architect of Geodesic domes, Mr Richard Buckminster Fuller (at ATIRA auditorium, Ahmedabad, India, some time in 1964 or ’65), where he asked audience of designers, How many of you believe Sun rises from the East? Everyone, in agreement raised their hand. But, he said ‘Sun never rises, it is the earth that rotates’, and that should be our way of thinking.\n\nIn ancient times, East-West, were perceived from the self-center, ‘as far as the rising sun or setting sun’, which was maximum conceivable distance. No one ever travelled as far as the sun. East and West were always two distinct entities. The Egyptians, believed a dark world beyond the West, but not necessarily as the other hemisphere or dark part of the globe.\n\nPolitically, the colonial powers were confused as to from where the East or orient begins. The term was first used in 1856, such as near-east, far-east, mid-east, west-Asia or south-Asia. These terms had, both, the locational reference and territorial overlaps (from the Europe or the location of the colony).\n\nThe sun rise or set as point on horizon is variable, in comparison, the North star is a reliable orientation. Ptolemy established the convention of the orienting maps with North at the top. But, was this more due to the Magnetism? Magnetic properties of few locations and materials were known since prehistory, the knowledge of its relationship with the Earth developed slowly. At first, the ‘compasses’ (magnetized iron objects, floating on oil or water or hung on a thread) were thought to point towards the ‘locations in the heavens and towards magnetic mountains’. Thales of Miletus, attributed a soul to the magnet, and Pliny believed that fumes from eating garlic and onions could destroy the magnetism in a compass, rendering it useless.’ In 1600s, there were reports of helmsmen on British ships being flogged for eating garlic.\n\nThe magnetic device like ‘compass’, existed in China in 4th CBC. These were contact magnetized metals, and so never retained the magnetism for long. The Chinese word for compass is ‘south-pointing needle’ (zhnánzhēn). The compass needle defined one of the cardinal point and other three were conjectured positions. Though, later on, a letter T (Latin Tramontana =North Wind) was used for marking the North. In Chinese, one lists directions in a clockwise manner, Dōng, Nán, Xī, Běi, East, South, West, North.\n\nEast-West traffic, in a networking context, is the transfer of data packets from server to server within a data center. The term east-west for this type of traffic comes from network diagram drawings that usually depict local area network (LAN) traffic horizontally. In contrast, North-South traffic describes client-to-server traffic that moves between the data center and a location outside of the data center network. North-south traffic is typically depicted vertically to illustrate traffic that flows above or below the data center.\n\nThe way to a place is called direction. In order to find a place or to describe where it is, we must know in what direction from us it lies. Most commonly, directions are provided in terms of whether the place lies north, south, east, or west of where we are currently located (this is known as relative location).\n\nThe line between day and night on the face of the Earth is called the terminus, which is a shifting entity. When terminus and the horizon are same, the shifting positions are confusing. In early ages, the confusion was profound with declination of magnetic needle.\n\n.\n\nPost -764 by Gautam Shah\n\nAn edge is the extreme position one can take, after that there is some opportunity to recede, or tumble down a presumptuous precipice. Dictionaries define the edge, as the outside limit of an object, area or surface. The edge is a real, but could be notional, hypothetical or mythical distinction. The edge is where some change is perceived, and so deviation is experienced. The edge is sharp or blurred, by the degree of contrast across the sides.\n\nEdges relate to sensory perception, which occur due to the limited range of our sensory capacities, which cause aberrations. The distortions in perceiving the edges are primarily the product of distance, which affect the scale and spread (space) and persistence (time). The distortions in perceiving the edges are secondarily, due to the experiences. The edges are sensorial aberrations, but one can use tools to enhance the perception, like spectacles, telescopes, microscopes, hearing aids, amplifiers, etc.\n\nThe edge in the sea is a horizon, which, in spite of the ‘closing in of the distance’, seems non-changing. It is the meeting edge of the earth and the sky, a reliable line for determining the latitude and longitude. A horizon is fairly diffused in twilight (dawn and dusk time).\n\nThere great many natural elements that are experienced as ‘distant edges’, which on close encounters are lost. Such change-lines include contours in terrains, visual variations of illumination, colour or texture.\n\nAn edge is also a temporal actuality, as a presumption of a period and to some extent a range of acceleration-deceleration. The edge in time occurs as targets and limits. These are like hunger, tiredness, work and reach capacities, physical survival, change in postures, and also in the form of remarkable events like death, birth, marriage, rewards, etc. The performance crafts are expressions bound by time, which may be for the content, impact and remembrance. The timed edges are actuated by the multi-sensorial effects, transition or negotiating period between the changes and considerations for bounce-back or mirroring. Edges in time are used for intensifying as much as diffusing the scale.\n\nThe spatial as well as temporal boundaries in performing arts have been consistently transgressed. Many means are employed to surmount the time boundaries, such as some motifs, are directional, patterns are progressive or regressive, scenes or compositions are sequential and exposures are conditional. Edges in performing arts relate to the climax of sensorial perception at which diminuendo is realized. In this sense, the edge is a personal experience and not a universal definition.\n\nSpaces have diffused edges, also due to limits of sensorial capacities and ambiguities of perception. Edges are affected due to convergence of several environmental domains. The ‘diffused edges’ conceal variations like depth, surface orientation, materials and variations in illumination.\n\nEdges, of physical nature, however small, offer, either, a rebound or transmission through. The reactions from the edges, like an echo, reverberation or absorption, are rarely exploited except in re-recording and editing. Dialogue delivery, singing, some dance steps and in real entities like night clubs, children play parks, or virtual environments like video games and digital presentations include some rebound or reflection effects, through lingering traces of the original.\n\nIn Graphics, the edges are recognized, where brightness (so the colour spectrum) changes, sharply or definitively. CAD and such other graphics’ tools fail to recognize the ‘open-ended fields’. Graphical edges need to close a boundary which forms a field and a define a surface. A similar problem of ‘a discontinuous edge’ in one-dimensional signals (break in time), is known as step or change detection. Edge detection is a basic requirement, for image manipulation, intelligent perception and feature detection-extraction.\n\n‘The edges extracted from a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene can be classified as either viewpoint dependent or viewpoint independent. A viewpoint independent edge typically reflects inherent properties of the three-dimensional objects, such as surface markings and surface shape. A viewpoint dependent edge may change as the viewpoint changes, and typically reflect the geometry of the scene, such as objects occluding one-another’.\n\nEdges and Corners are synonymous, because corners have edges. Cornering someone is equal to pushing someone from the edge into ignominy. Edges, if nearby can be sharp or, are blurred. The edges on Cucoloris (masks on stage or film lights) are made rugged for soft illumination and smooth for harsh lighting.\n\nEdges can be diffused by blurring the boundaries, reducing the contrast between the foreground and background, by including objects of sharper edge definitions, ‘de-flattening’ the overall tonality, masking or camouflage with other objects or effects. Edges can be accentuated by using marking or highlighters at the edges, colour or textural contrast, reducing the depth differences between objects in the scene, and by addition of familiar objects or narratives with clearer details.\n\nAn edge is nominally a spatial phenomenon, definitive like a territory or ambiguous like an environment. Photographers and graphic designers frame a scene, which is defining an edge. The frame could be a physical outline or just white space providing additional spread.\n\nArtworks are bound by the edges of the media. These are usually finite edges, but in large natural scapes these could be infinite in extent. Physical media, restrict the work, but pose challenges to overcome. Artworks like sculptures or crafts-wares are completely free of edging confines. Though, for such entities, whatever is to be represented, is intrinsically well managed in terms of scaling or proportioning. Sculptures (free-standing, not designed to be attached to any entity), if created from a pre-existing single material object, do have restricted size, compared with the assembled objects, like the architecture.\n\nAccommodating an art expression within the confines of media, has been a challenge of managing what and how, the spatial content (even if, abstract) is accommodated. The artwork contents are likely to include, directional indicators, like eyesight, arrows, sequenced patterns, the source of illumination, air flow, vanishing perspectives or moving objects, all these need fore-space before the edge. It requires great talent to transgress the edge, if not physically at least deceptively. Edges are dissolved by means like symbols, metaphors, indicators (directions, rhythm, sequencing), etc. Scaling is a comparative statement, and requires distancing for its conduction. Perspective helped inclusion of set of things into the extent of the media. Capriccio art, based on mathematical perspective taught the content management in art, and creation of pseudo architecture of visual effects.\n\nArchitecture is essentially a set of edges or bounding elements, which distinguish it, from the vast exterior world. But architecture, cannot survive as a cocoon. It needs to break in-out of the containment with not just entry-exit nodes, but variety of means for environmental exchanges. Architectural entities, in spite of all the broken or compromised edges, reflect, composite totality, if not singular monumentality.\n\nArchitectural edges are of many classes. Namely these are, the barriers that form the built space, ingressed or transgressed boundaries, extents forming a participatory arena and sensorially perceived fields. Edges also occur as domain markers, such as cultural, political, reach of means of transportation, supplies, disposal, etc. Architectural edges are some form of containment, so finite. The formatted space controls, obligation, compulsion, awe, physical enforcement, a field of action, reach, a range of sanctimony and use of physical energy. Within such containment few elements have mutual relationships or dependence, which, cannot be dissolved or ignored. So edges or containment arouses a desire to surmount it.\n\nSpaces are perceived, in two manners, the Bounding elements and Positions of objects. Tall edges, proportionately reduce the distance aspect of the space. In cities tall buildings, reduce the perceptive size of the spaces.\n\nPost 753 -by Gautam Shah\n\n.\n\nCopying is a natural phenomenon, where we pick up some impressions of sensorial nature, such as visual, aural, smell, taste, touch etc. Copying may be an instinctive act. It occurs as some form of behavioural expression. When a child begins to understand that certain actions, responses, sounds from the environment, if emulated, triggers some actions. It becomes a language of action-reaction.\n\nThe sensorial effects have two fundamental scales, temporal and spatial. For example, Hearing is structured with beats (marking-representing the passage of time) defining the temporal scale. Similarly Seeing is structured with traces, which help to understand the spatial scale. Artists, Crafts-persons and Designers cannot survive without copying and tracing. In both the cases, the sequence of origination and affectations, however, often gets disarrayed.\n\nWe perceive many things and wish to remember them. The retained image can only copy the effects close to the original. To retain a visual impression, it should carry some potential for recollection and production. Here one, needs transfer protocol. Same way, we can remember smells, tastes and tactile feelings. These are even more difficult to structure and retain, so we associate such experiences with their conditions of origin or encounters and with reference to time, space, and the environment.\n\nThere are broadly two ways of copying. These are either contagious or noncontagious. The former, is used for objects that are touchable or accessible, whereas the later, is used for very large or small things.\n\nContagious copying was made from flatter forms like shallow carvings, metals engravings, fabric designs, etc. The method only copied the selective forms, from the images like the pattern, structure, etc. Contagious copies are exact scaled replicas. These are sometimes formed by bridging randomly marked (real or imaginary) points to generate a skeleton frame.\n\nNoncontagious formations occur from what we retain as remembrances (from an exclusive observation or accumulation of multiple experiences over period). These are collections of points or linear strokes, retained over graph, grid or reference motifs. Non contagious images are drawn-images that are often impressionistic, and in the form of facsimile or surrogate forms.\n\nIn visual arts, copying the works of the masters has been a standard way for students to learn to paint or sculpt. Copying of three-dimensional works (models) in easy-to-use materials like clay or wax was a primary method. Such models or 3D renderings (perspectives) were also used for scaling, on site-positioning, visual confirmation, and for duplication. Such images were used for visual confirmation (presentations) of the donors or sponsors for the proposed buildings, sculptures, artefacts, murals or stained glass compositions.\n\nForms copied through contagious and noncontagious routes are distinctly different. Contagious duplication is more elaborate but accurate, Noncontagious imaging matures after multiple attempts. It though, allows upward or downward scaling. A noncontagious image is done instantly, or if, remembered, must be immediately transferred to some media, sketch, model or narrative. There is some inevitable generative deterioration of details, interference of ‘noise’ and personal interpretation. But, when noncontagious images are collated through several individual experiences, at different occasions and locations, a reasonably acceptable image emerges. The process of improvisation must occur continuously to prevent deterioration or ‘cultural’ improvisations, which accumulates with each generation.\n\nNon contagious deduction through the impressionistic mode also result into doodles. Doodles are too personal and frugal, so are meaningful to the authors. Others have to wait till something concrete emerges out of it, such as a model, set, building, art composition, a strategy or film. Doodles can provide the cues about thinking of the author. On a performance stage the cues are discreet indications or prompts for reminders like, specific sounds, beat or mime acts and gestural expressions.\n\nCopying was once done through pin hole boxes and camera obscura. Unlike sketching, the early image capturing devices substantially truthfully captured the colour and texture, shades and shadows. Such images were only reversed (upside down) views, smaller in scale, but needed some storage system. For Scenes with depth (perspectives) were renditions over the graticulate frame. It was a square marked frame to facilitate the proportionate enlargement or reduction of the image. Portrait drawings were prepared from the silhouette as captured on the glass board (19th C). With digital imaging, the copying is ‘nearly’ scalable. Upward-downward conversions are carried out with the aid of the tracing instrument called the pantograph. With each ‘new generation of technologies’, the older copies seem ‘out of date’. Frequently copying from the copies, the deterioration accumulates with each process.\n\nTeachers teach by writing on the board, speaking up and by actions (gestural-postural), asking students to take a note of it. The note-taking, is copying the lesson. Dance teachers ask students to follow a regimen of steps accompanied with beats. The dance steps and the sound of beats, ultimately get transferred to production with music and positions on the performance stage. These are copying processes in parts that ultimately form complex image.\n\nSquaring up, is a simple technique of dividing an image into the grid, which allows easy and accurate copying (at the same, reduced or enlarged scale) of the image. The same method was used to transfer small size sketches onto canvas or wall murals. To perceive a visual image, lines and grids, have been used for ages. Such implants, as a superlative pattern establish mutual relationships and distance. Early images of constellations, territorial forms, caricatures, facial expressions, etc. are such captures. Squaring for transfer technique did not damage to the original sketch.\n\nTracing has a basic purpose of duplicating and imprinting an image. Tracing is a tool for reproduction of an expression. The image needs to be ready on some media (opaque, transparent or translucent). The image gets transferred (transfer print). During tracing, one has a choice to manipulate the image. It is a quick rendition that carries only the essential or the sketchy impression, and so minimal. The reproduction is also a manner of interpretation and improvisation.\n\nTracing was used for copying drawings, signatures, writings and maps, and often for reproducing them. It was a tedious and inaccurate way of copying. Only larger details could be accurately traced. During tracing, the craft masters often improvised few of the details.\n\nTracings have limitations, as can be delivered mostly in visual or aural transference. In tactile tracing visually impaired persons sense the surface through their hand, feet or walking stick. This, of course, is reinforced by the spatial acoustics. Smell traces can lure or scare (smell of tiger urine) the animals.\n\nThe copied images have a characteristic axial setting and so changing the original is not easy, but traced imprints make it possible. Copied images are traced by maintaining the original, varying the axial setting, purpose, in part or whole or in repeated formats. The tracing, if on transparent or translucent media also allow manipulation through mirroring in horizontal, vertical or inclined directions.\n\nTracing retains something of the original characteristics like scale, proportions, etc. But, may intentionally miss out many things like, finer details, colour and texture. Tracing is a selective follow-up of the image. It picks up important switches in any configuration, like ends, edges, junctions, angles or cross overs of lines-plane and marked interchanges in the contours. Tracing may select specific colour zones and create colour separated versions (multi coloured printing overlays). Tracings, if part of a larger composition, are marked with indicators to establish the continuity and orientation connections.\n\nTracing requires running a pencil, stylus, pointer or pricking wheel (a pouncing wheel is called a tracing wheel) over the lines or dots of the image. Pouncing has been a common technique for centuries for oil paintings, engravings, murals etc. Tracing is by impact impression or pricking holes in the media. A powder such as chalk, graphite or pastel is forced through the holes, to leave an outline on the working surface below. Tracing images over the fresh lime Plaster for Fresco painting of very large mural surfaces, was fairly common. The image outlines were macro zones filled with colours by apprentices and details overdrawn by the master painter. Tracing as a shadow or silhouette capturing, were done for portrait drawing. Similarly, star constellations were remembered by endowing a superfluous image.\n\nTracing is nominally used to copy an image for imprinting it, at some other place in a different reference, in original or varied axial settings, purposes, part or whole and repeats. In case of sculptures, copies have often been made using devices such as the pointing machine, the pantograph or 3D cameras or a computer guided router systems that can scan to generate a model through 3D printing.\n\nA scrivener or scribe (often called a copy master) was a person, who could read, write letters to court and compose legal documents. These people often translated and also improvised the content to please their masters.\n\nA mimeograph machine (often abbreviated to mimeo, or a stencil duplicator) was a low-cost duplicating machine that works by forcing ink through a stencil onto paper. Mimeographs, along with spirit duplicators and hectographs, were common technologies for printing small quantities of documents. From 1960s, the photocopying gradually displaced all duplicating machines and technologies.\n\nCartoons are full scale or part size sketches made on metal, parchment, fabric or paper. These were used to transfer an entire image, or parts of it for multiple duplication. These were pricked with pin-holes for imprinting a copy for mural fresco, wood boards or canvas. The Cartoons (from the Italian word for a large sheet of medium material), were also test replicas for checking on-site suitability, composition format, details of figures and other embellishments. Cartoons (since 1500s) were used for approval of donors.\n\nThe cartoons had restrictions, as it was not possible to create as large as the intended artwork, so select important elements such as body postures, faces, dresses, architectonic elements, decorative features and motifs for embellishments, etc. were prepared. These encouraged rearrangement, repositioning, or mirroring of the content. Cartoons also allowed placing of the figures on plain and curved surfaces (like ceilings). But with cartoons it was not possible to enlarge or reduce the scale. Cartoons did not offer the colour shade scheme (unless the original artist has indicated by naming or patch). Usually the dress, ornament, skin colour and illumination-shading were decided later on.\n\nThe cartoon mediums (parchment, paper, silk and other translucent fabrics) were fairly fragile, deformed through stretching and frequent pin hole punctures, so had to be carefully maintained. The Cartoons were precious possessions of the artist, and were well secured to prevent misuse or thefts. But many such pieces, after the execution of the painting, were rented or sold off to others for reuse at other sites. Cartoons were called Khaka (Urdu). Disney studio, in the pre computer age used a set of cartoons for facial features and backgrounds. Cartoons could be repeated at different positions within a composition, on curved surfaces, or inclined surfaces such as over the arches and ceilings.\n\nTrail\n\nA trail is a series of marks left by a person, animal, or any thing in action. Many of the GPS systems trace trails of movements (through multiple satellite images or recognition by multiple mobile towers). Trails form an image or reflection by combining a series of impressions or recognise a sensible geometric pattern out of random data. Animals trace smell or heat as a trail. A meander, derives from ‘turning path of the River Maeander, in Asia Minor’ or ‘the meander is the figure of a labyrinth in linear form’. Scrolling is design structured over spirals, rolling incomplete circle motifs, but incorporating copied images. Terms such as, the interlacing or arabesque, are used for such linear use of repeated images. Computer Mouse allows trailing and selection.\n\n.\n\nPost 737 -Gautam Shah\n\n.\n\nThere are FOUR articles in the series Illumination+Shadows,\n\n737 ILLUMINATION and COLOURS in SHADOWS -Issues of Design 38\n\n732 ILLUMINATION and SHADOWS in ART WORKS -Issues of Design-36\n\n729 ILLUMINATION and ARCHITECTURAL SHADOWS -Issues of Design 35\n\n727 ILLUMINATION and SHADOWS -Issues of Design 34\n\nMonet said: ‘A Colour owes its brightness to the force of contrast, rather than to its inherent qualities’. He also said that primary colours look brightest, when they are brought into contrast with their complementaries’.\n\nColour contrast has drawn attention in drawn art forms as well as architecture, sculptures, ceramics, textiles and craft items. Colour contrasts emerge, when a different and lighter or darker colour is placed next to the other one. But colour contrasts also emerge, when a colour comes under differing levels of illumination or shadows. This realization was conspicuous in 3D forms. Such colour contrasts perceptions under natural or other illuminations and related shadows are affected by the ‘local’ reflections. The subtle grades of contrasts emerge due to varied brightness, from objects in different directions and in intensities due to many colours of the reflecting surfaces.\n\nColour contrasts were realized, first in mosaic arts as a form of ‘highlighting marks’. To make a mosaic figure or image to stand out from other similar entitles that needed emphasis (wider and darker-lighter edges). But mosaics had limited size and colour range, and this was not easy. Early drawn arts like Mosaics were equally ‘flat’. This was perhaps, as the medium of art Fresco, was a method of pigment impregnation onto wet plasters. The colours were zoned with scratched outlines and had little scope (time) for colour mixing or edge diffusion. Details were added in Tempera, for which one had to wait for the surface to thoroughly dry out. As a result fresco artist, used intense contrasting colours in demarcated zones of the fresco.\n\nAs the interiors became brighter with larger clerestory windows, there was a clear need to ‘add drama and mystery to the paintings’ through high contrast of colours. Painting themes were now not just depictive but narrative, and in the background included architecture, landscapes and non religious figures (political sponsors and donors). Holy figures were distinguished by bright ‘halo’. These halos and backgrounds, in brighter colours or gold gilding, made everything else seem darker, often gloomy. To lighten the perceived dark effect, many levels of sobered contrasts were added, and the result was a ‘flat’ composition. For the contrasts, the body contours, folds of fabrics, highlighting marks, differences between near-by and far-off objects, were formed of black or darker shades. The use of darker shades, for edge making, however, taught the value of shadowing with illumination.\n\nThe shadows formed better depth contrasts. The shadows (related to illumination) were first placed with respect to the local needs. These ‘local needs’ in theme, created many shadows and sources of illumination, and also had as many directions. But soon shadows were modified as related to single the source of illumination. Such ‘related shadows’ made paintings lively and realistic.\n\nSingle source shadowing was very difficult in mosaic and very large mural paintings. There were few issues here. FIRST, Shadows were predominantly cast with a source of illumination from the left-top corner. This made objects towards the right-bottom corner suffused with long shadows. SECOND, The shadowing style adopted in artworks, did not match the actual illumination from the openings of the architectural space. THIRD, There was the belief that holy figures do not cast a shadow. These factors required a lot of experimentation. First, the problem required a painting to be narrow or the source of illumination shifted away from the extreme top-left corner. Second required a composition in consideration of the existing conditions of the architecture and the viewers’ position. Third issue was solved by forming graduated dark-light areas for body or dress contours and ignoring the shadows falling on the ground.\n\nFrom the days Painted Roman interior Murals, the Perspective was used to arrange ‘built or spatial’ elements in compositions. These were scaled for depth, but not specifically illuminated. Objects with visible sides were made darker towards the receding edge for greater effects of the depth. For greater perspective effect some of the parts of buildings or the spaces between the buildings were back lit, but shadows followed the front-based illumination. Illumination and shadows, did not come together in any purposive manner.\n\nIt was from 1700s that Capriccio style of art for drawing fantastical architectural buildings and ruins, with inclusion of occasional staffage (figures), truly began to exploit the perspective. Areas of painting were illuminated through a direct single source of illumination or atmospheric distributed light. Areas that did not get illumination were treated to be mildly darker, thus creating a sense of contrast for depth. The illumination and shadows depended on tonal gradation, and this can be recognised and executed, if the areas are fairly large. Tonal gradation cannot be included in micro architectonic elements.\n\nIn Asia, perspective did not occur, though some inclined planes indicated the depth. Scaling of elements and figures was extremely illogical. The depth was through spatial zoning, like, frontal areas filled in with elements, dominantly involved in the narrative. The next mid-zone was for supportive elements like architectural and landscape features. The background, was used as a contrasting plane of lighter tones. The ethereal elements included here, served to balance the composition, by their ‘white space’ presence. There was complete absence of graded or directional illumination, and colour shades for shadowing.\n\nIlluminated and shaded areas are nominally differentiated with the tonal variations of the same colour (monochrome) or with different hues. But this effect was enhanced by texture contrast of physical roughening of the surface, like the gesso and impasto in art. Gesso is the base or foundation treatment, which imprints a texture on the art surface. Impasto effect is created by laying the paint in very thick layers, so that it can allow brush or painting-knife strokes to be visible.\n\nIt was in 1600s that artists were able to create textures, not just by scrapping the surface, but through directional or random texturing, as a simulated visual effect. The directional texturing became art of intaglio or gravure, and became style of impressionist art. The art of texturing a surface, also became Sfumato style of art, as forming a soft transition between colours and tones to achieve distinct realism.\n\nShadows depend on the strength and distance of the source of illumination. Candle, Lamp, electric or fire illuminations, unlike the Solar light, are at finite distances and of limited intensity. Both, however, form shadows with respect to the elevation of the objects. Solar light offers vast grades of reflections from nearby surfaces, but, other illuminations can provide small cone of receding strength. The skill to represent the colour tonal variations in shadows from the reflected light was grasped post Renaissance period. The nature of the colour within a shadow is mainly due to the intensity of reflected light and the colour (from the reflective surface).\n\nThe ceilings (flat, dome, vault or other configurations) get illumination from windows and clerestory openings, in many directions. The ceilings and upper sections of tall walls were used for illusionistic paintings, with features like floating angels and clouds, foreshortened figures and pseudo architectural elements. The details were seen from distance, so drawn in an impressionistic manner with wild brush strokes. Such ceilings, known as Plafond art, had the lower edge, drawn in dark and contrasting colours and shadows, but the top central portion forming the upper limit of the room, were made with blue of the skies to look ethereal. Plafonds (17th to early 19 C) offered great lessons for treating architectural spaces with illumination and shadows.\n\n‘Mannerist painters and later Baroque artists used extreme intense contrasts between light and dark, almost obscuring their subjects to lend drama and mystery to the paintings’.\n\nWhen Monet painted his series of haystacks, his main concern was to show that in reality, the colour of light and the colour of shadow, depending of the time of day, both, change simultaneously and dramatically. Artists of 19th C used comparatively, stronger dark shades for heightened impressionistic realism. This began to change with the onset of next century, when lighter colour shades (perhaps due to the Titanium Dioxide) were available. The subject matter changed from realistic to ‘objective’ abstraction. Here the source of illumination was unrecognizable, and so the shadows were nonexistent.\n\n.\n\nPost 735 -by Gautam Shah\n\n.\n\nA Design comes into being with the realization of the order that forms the composition. Architectural drawings are not designs, but media for representation. A design is the comprehensive experience of sensorial, emotional or functional nature that one derives from an object. Some designs are simplistic that their experience is holistic.\n\nA Holistic composition itself, may present as a single entity. Such exploits are not common. Holistic compositions are ‘superfluous’ with extraneous body and no dissect-able content. Holistic compositions are too personal. It is not easy to convey to others, except as the sensorial experience (visual, aural, tactile, olfactory or taste). A Holistic feel does not convey or have any utilitarian purpose. The creator of the holistic entity may experience the design-order conceptually (mentally or schematically), but for others, to perceive that feel, it must wait for the actualization. Private creations tend to have holistic ideation, like an abstract thing or a sculpture without any capacity to convey a meaning.\n\nFormal Designs are very large and complex organizations, serving many functions. A formal design serves functional, technological and, stylish relevance, besides being sited to a place. The conception of a comprehensive structure serving all these is not possible within a practicable period. The exigency of solution achievement does not allow it. The urgency derives from the fact that some other slightly superior solution can outpace it. In the circumstances, a design remains a workable entity, an assembly, where at any given moment ‘some sections may work well, and others remain time-space compromises’.\n\nActualized designs have size, shape and other sensorial attributes. The composition in an actualized design emerges through these basic characteristics. But most importantly actualized designs need to confirm to some compulsions. Without this, a design remains a defunct sculpted form, or an assembly of materials.\n\nAt Design ideation level, a solution may seem comprehensive and so nearly holistic. There, however, are some compulsions which must be considered before a design actualizes.\n\n1. A complex design entity is conceived with many systems, some of which are fairly independent, but most others are not only mutually dependent, but spatially convergent.\n\n2 The convergence also occurs due to the few nodes that connect various systems to the outside resources and systems.\n\n3 A design encounters directional solar and other environmental elements, and these have zonal identity.\n\n4 A design creation to be stable and secure must affirm to natural forces like gravity and structural integrity.\n\n5 A design, where possible will be conceived of replaceable elements that require fitment facilities and protocols. The replaceable elements, fitment facilities and protocols, need to be universal and modular which force continuance of traditional or time-tested things, rather than new ones. A design emerges as a dilemma between old and new things.\n\nCubists, Modernists and later Deconstructivists tried to take a reverse route to reach the state of ‘abstraction’. They tried to reach a state of Holism by elimination. To this end, attempts were made to ‘eliminate’ (often just cover-up, hide or dis-regard) ‘what was plausible’. It is not possible to escape the reality and create any thing unimaginable.\n\nDesign documented schemes and actualized entities reveal Patterns, at three levels, as holistic, sectional or part identity. The revelation of a pattern is related to the scale of the design. Design documented schemes are scaled to manage and manipulate the composition, whereas, actualized designs are experienced in varied conditions and references. In documented design the perception of a pattern depends on the quality of presentation, and in case of actual design, the pattern can be sensed depending on the quality of environment (intensity of background interferences like glare, noise, persistence of past experiences) and conditions of perception (distance, angle, occlusions, reference to past remembrances, framing, personal sensorial capacities, etc.).\n\nPatterns have primary relevance, if, its body can be realized, and the potential for reuse manifests. For the later intention, a pattern must be traceable. One must sensorially realize its presence or remember its body and be able to copy, recollect or recreate it. In the process, many things get lost, but what gets carried is the essence of the pattern. A pattern may recur in some other time-space conditions.\n\nThe patterns, as a ‘pure design or image’ has no raison d’etre (cause or purpose of origin). Patterns may be entities independent of the surroundings and also flourish as attached to some context. Patterns are arrangements, oriented peculiarly, but could still remain relevant from many other sides.\n\nPatterns are sectional or part identity of a design composition. The formation and recognition of the Pattern, is the first order of founding a Design. Some ‘designs’ not offer an ‘unusual pattern’ as a take home essence. Such patterns are often in holistic in form. Patterns can have the potential of being joined with similar or dissimilar patterns, reduced in scale and repositioned (reoriented). Patterns also have the inherent possibilities of becoming part of larger compositions. At this stage holistic compositions do not remain personal things.\n\nPatterns nominally have multiple Motifs, and all integrated in some manner. But a Holistic pattern is a motif. Such motifs (holistic patterns) are self-sustaining elements and stay unaffected by the happenings in the surroundings, so some order of connectivity is required. The order of connection is the manner of touch or overlap, scale, direction and orientation besides the physical commonality and partial distortions. These are the essential characteristics that offer inexhaustible possibilities of bridging. The bridges, have two ends and a ‘structure’ in between. In case of a pattern, the structure may be physical, but generally just hypothetical recognition.\n\nA Pattern may look like a familiar object, but need not be a representation or symbol. It may not have any abstract conveyance, yet may carry an associated or interpretive meaning. Our cognitive processes surpass the sensorial perception, and so redirect the sensorial search. Pattern recognition is a matter of perception, and so a personal affair. Recognition of a pattern in nature remains impressionistic, and remembered, noted or expressed for posterity.\n\nThe Pattern style is omni present but becomes valid with a culture (terrain, climate, religion, customs, technology). Nikos Salingaros for example considers ‘regularity to be a key property of a pattern whether the pattern is the external stimulus itself or some other percept residing in the mind of the perceiver’. Is the pattern objectively observable and measurable or is it a subjective experience?\n\nPattern in Noise: The phenomenon of finding meaningful patterns in meaningless noise is called patternicity , and conversely, not perceiving patterns that are present in the visual stimulus is called apatternicity.\n\nIn general terms, “a gestalt is a form, a figure, a configuration, or a pattern.” The Oxford dictionary defines form as “the visible shape or configuration of something.” The psychologist Gibson argues in his paper titled –What is a Form? -that much more precision is needed in the definition of such terms if they are going to be useful. He laments the fact that “the term form is used by different people to mean different things and by the same person to mean different things on different occasions.” According to Gibson “shape, figure, structure, pattern, order, arrangement, configuration, plan, outline, contour are similar terms without any distinct meaning”.\n\n."
