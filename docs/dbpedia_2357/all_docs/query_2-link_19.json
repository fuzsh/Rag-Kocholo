Reasons for which include:\n\nChallenges to Indian Economic Growth\n\nErratic Weather Patterns: Monsoon rainfall under the influence of a developing El Niño has led to erratic weather patterns, including flooding in certain regions and deficient rains, particularly in August. The erratic rainfall patterns have resulted in damage to the rice crop in particular and lower sowing for pulses in the kharif season.\n\nHigh Inflation & Moderating Demand: The economy has been impacted by moderating demand and high inflation, leading to a slowdown in economic activity.\n\nInflation, especially for energy and food, has reduced purchasing power and household consumption, particularly in urban areas.\n\nDeclining Investment: Weakening credit-supported demand for capital goods indicates a decline in business investment.\n\nTrade Deficit in Goods: While services exports have shown growth, it is insufficient to offset the trade imbalance in goods.\n\nLow labour productivity is affecting the competitiveness of Indian goods and participation in global value chains.\n\nOther Challenges: Challenges include potential deterioration of banks’ asset quality, delays in fiscal consolidation, difficulties in trade agreements, and the impact of below-normal monsoon seasons.\n\nWhat is the Asian Development Bank (ADB)?\n\nThe Asian Development Bank's primary mission is to \"foster economic growth and cooperation\" among countries in the Asia-Pacific Region.\n\nHeadquarters: Manilla, Philippines.\n\nStructure:\n\nThe Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank, known as the ADB Charter, vests all the powers of the institution in the Board of Governors, which in turn delegates some of these powers to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe ADB's highest policy-making body is its Board of Governors, which comprises one representative from each member.\n\nThe Board of Governors meets formally once a year during ADB's Annual Meeting.\n\nMembership:\n\nIt is open to members and associate members of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East.\n\nIt's also open to other regional countries and non-regional developed countries that are members of the U.N. or of any of its specialised agencies.\n\nAt present, there are a total of 68 members, which is made up of 48 regional and 19 non-regional members.\n\nAlthough the majority of the Bank's members are from the Asia-Pacific region, the industrialised nations are also well-represented.\n\nADB's five largest shareholders are Japan and the United States (each with 15.6% of total shares), the People's Republic of China (6.4%), India (6.3%), and Australia (5.8%).\n\nSource of Capital:\n\nThe ADB raises capital regularly through the international bond markets.\n\nThe ADB also relies on member contributions, retained earnings from lending, and the repayment of loans for the funding of the organisation.\n\nFunctions:\n\nThe Asian Development Bank provides assistance to its developing member countries, the private sector, and public-private partnerships through grants, loans, technical assistance, and equity investments to promote social and economic development.\n\nThe ADB regularly facilitates policy dialogues and provides advisory services. They also use co-financing operations that tap official, commercial, and export credit sources while providing assistance.\n\nNature of Financing:\n\nThe ADB provides both private financing and sovereign (public) financing.\n\nPrivate sector efforts focus on projects that help promote private investments in the region that will have significant development impact and will lead to accelerated, sustainable, and inclusive growth.\n\nPublic-sector financing provides funding for member countries with flexibility in determining how they can achieve development goals.\n\nTharosaurus indicus\n\nContext: Fossils of a plant-eating dinosaur Tharosaurus indicus from the Middle Jurassic period, found in the Thar desert near the Jaisalmer Basin by the Geological Survey of India.\n\nAbout Tharosaurus indicus\n\nThe name “Tharosaurus indicus” reflects its origin, with “Thar” referring to the Thar Desert and “indicus” indicating its origin in India.\n\nIt is a long-necked, plant-eating dinosaur species.\n\nIt is characterised by vertebrae with deep, long depressions on the sides and under surface, and split neural spines (top-most parts of the backbone) resembling spikes.\n\nMembers of the Dicraeosauridae family of sauropods to which Tharasaurus belongs were not nearly as large. This family was unique: its members were smaller and had shorter necks and tails compared to the other long-necked sauropods.\n\nThe fossils of Tharosaurus indicus were found to be around 167 million years old, making them one of the oldest known dicraeosaurids and diplodocoids globally.\n\nThe dicraeosaurid dinosaur had previously been found in the North and South Americas, Africa, and China. This is the first instance of such fossils being discovered in India.\n\nP V Narasimha Rao Case: Bribery vs Parliamentary Privileges\n\nContext: A 5-judge Constitution Bench, presided by Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud, has referred the matter of Sita Soren Case to a larger 7-judge Bench that will assess the interpretation of Articles 105(2) and 194(2) of the Indian Constitution.\n\nSita Soren Case\n\nShe was accused of accepting a bribe to vote for an independent candidate in the 2012 Rajya Sabha elections.\n\nSita Soren, an MLA, allegedly took bribe to vote for one candidate but voted for another.\n\nA case was subsequently filed against Sita and the Jharkhand High Court in 2014 ruled that she is not immune from prosecution.\n\nShe challenged the case in the Supreme Court and the matter came before a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court.\n\nIn 2019, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court referred the matter to a five-judge bench.\n\nNow, in 2023, the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court has referred the case to a larger bench that would finally re-examine whether lawmakers are immune from prosecution if they take bribe to cast a vote.\n\nP V Narasimha Rao v. State (1998)\n\nHistorical Context\n\nThe 10th Lok Sabha election, which was held in the year 1991, the congress party formed the government with P.V. Narasimha Rao as Prime Minister.\n\nIn July 1993 a ‘No Confidence Motion’ was moved against the existing government of P.V. Narasimha Rao.\n\nThe party somehow managed to defeat the motion with 251 members voting in favor of the motion and 265 voting against the motion.\n\nAfter the motion got defeated the party once again came into power.\n\nBut a person filed a complaint with the CBI wherein it was alleged that some members of parliament were bribed during the no-confidence motion in Lok Sabha.\n\nThe CBI, based on information received, registered a complaint under Section 13(2), Section 13(1) (d) (iii) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA) against some members.\n\nA criminal prosecution was launched against the bribe-taking and bribes giving members of the Parliament under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and Section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nIssues raised in P V Narasimha Rao Case\n\nWhether by virtue of Article 105 of the Constitution, a Member of Parliament can claim immunity from prosecution on a charge of bribery in a criminal court.\n\nWhether a Member of Parliament is a \"public servant\" falling within the purview of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1986.\n\nJudgement of Supreme Court in P V Narasimha Rao v. State (1998)\n\nThe majority of the Supreme Court held that MPs have immunity under Article 105(2), protecting them from criminal prosecution for actions taken within the parliamentary context.\n\nThe Court held that the members are immune from any kind of proceedings against them in respect of any vote in the parliament.\n\nThe Court would have no jurisdiction to put any criminal liability on the accused persons as whatever allegedly happened was in respect of votes given by some of them in the Lok Sabha touched the privileges of the House within the meaning of clauses (2) and (3) of Article 195 of the Constitution.\n\nMembers of Lok Sabha hold no office and as such are not public servants within the meaning of Section 2(c) of the PCA and for that reason the PCA would not apply to the alleged acts of omission and commission of the accused persons.\n\nEven if it be taken that Members of Lok Sabha do fall within Section 2(c) of PCA and are thus taken to be public servants, yet the Act would not apply for the simple reason that in the case of Lok Sabha Members there is no authority competent to remove them from their office within the meaning of Section 19(1)(c) of PCA.\n\nGlobal report on hypertension\n\nContext: The World Health Organisation (WHO) has released its fir-ever report on the blood pressure (hypertension), also known as silent killer.\n\nAbout hypertension\n\nIt is commonly known as high blood pressure, is a medical condition characterized by persistently elevated blood pressure levels in the arteries.\n\nIt is typically measured as two numbers, systolic (when the heart beats) and diastolic (when the heart is at rest) pressure.\n\nCan be controlled effectively with simple, low-cost medication and preventive measures.\n\nHealthy eating, tobacco cessation, and increased physical activity can reduce blood pressure.\n\nKey findings of the report\n\nApproximately 4 of every 5 people with hypertension are not adequately treated, but if countries can scale up coverage, 76 million deaths could be averted between 2023 and 2050.\n\nReport is based on the analysis of the data where blood pressure is 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or higher or a person is taking medication for the condition.\n\nThe number of people living with hypertension doubled between 1990 and 2019, from 650 million to 1.3 billion.\n\nNearly half of people with hypertension globally are currently unaware of their condition. More than three-quarters of adults with hypertension live in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nKey findings about India\n\nHypertension is the most important risk factor for death and disability in India.\n\nOnly 37 per cent of Indians with hypertension are diagnosed and only 30 per cent get treated.\n\nAt present, only 15 per cent of those with hypertension in the country have it under control.\n\nMore than half of all the deaths in the country (52 per cent) due to cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack can be attributed to elevated blood pressure.\n\nPrimary triggers for hypertension in India are high salt intake, tobacco use (28%), obesity, alcohol consumption and lack of physical exercise (34%).\n\nIn National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5 ) reported a hypertension prevalence of 24% in men and 21% among women in 2016-2020, an increase from 19% and 17%, respectively, from the previous round (2015-16).\n\nAmendment to the Constitution for “Simultaneous Election”\n\nContext: Recently constituted committee under the leadership of former President Ram Nath Kovind to examine and recommend if the constitutional amendments for simultaneous elections would require ratification by the States.\n\nProvisions that may demand amendment of constitution for simultaneous election\n\nSimultaneous elections will need at least five constitutional amendments. The articles that would require amending are:\n\nArticle 83 (2): It says the Lok Sabha's term should not exceed five years, but it may be dissolved sooner.\n\nArticle 85 (2) (b): A dissolution ends the very life of the existing House, and a new House is constituted after general elections.\n\nArticle 172 (1): A state assembly, unless sooner dissolved, shall continue for five years\n\nArticle 174 (2) (b): The Governor has the power to dissolve the assembly on the aid and advice of the cabinet. Governor can apply his mind when the advice comes from a Chief Minister whose majority is in doubt.\n\nArticle 356: Imposition of President's Rule in states.\n\nLaw Commission draft report on Simultaneous Election (2018)\n\nThe Law Commission of India chaired by Justice B. S. Chauhan provide the following:\n\nIt suggested that simultaneous elections would require amendments to various constitutional provisions, the Representation of the People's Act 1951, and the Rules of Procedure of Lok Sabha and State Assemblies.\n\nThe Commission highlighted that a constitutional amendment to this effect must receive ratification from at least 50% of the States.\n\nAmendment Process Mentioned in the Constitution\n\nMost of the constitution can be amended through a simple majority of those present and voting in each House of Parliament. Some examples include amendments contemplated in:\n\nArticle 4: changes related to the organisation of States.\n\nArticle 169: abolition or creation of Legislative Councils in States\n\nSchedule VI: provisions for the administration of Tribal Areas in the States of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram. Etc.\n\nAmendment under Article 368\n\nUnder Article 368 Constitution provide for two kinds of amendments\n\nArticle 368(1): For amending the provision like Fundamental Rights just ‘Special majority’ (not less than two-thirds of the members are present and voting in each House of Parliament as well as a majority of the total membership of each House) is needed.\n\nArticle 368(2): For amendment under this article both a ‘special majority’ and ratification by at least one-half of the State legislatures is required. These are commonly referred to as ‘entrenched provisions’ and are as follows:\n\nif there is a change in the provisions regarding elections to the post of the President of India (Article 54 and 55).\n\nif there is a change in the extent of the executive power of the Union or the State governments (Article 73 and 162).\n\nif there is any change in the provisions regarding the Union judiciary or the High Courts (Articles 124–147 and 214–231).\n\nif the distribution of legislative and administrative powers between the Union and the States is affected (Article 245 to 255).\n\nif any of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule is affected.\n\nif the representation of the States in Parliament is changed (Article 82).\n\nif Article 368 itself is amended.\n\nConstitutional Perspective about the ratification by the states\n\nFederal Structure: Dr. B.R Ambedkar was in favour of the ratification by States for the amendment of certain constitutional provisions to ensure that the federal structure of the Constitution remains fundamentally unaltered.\n\nPrinciple of separation of Power: Dr. Ambedkar cautioned that permitting all constitutional amendments to take place by a simple majority would defeat the principle of separation of powers among the three organs of the State.\n\nNeed of State Ratification: Supreme Court Cases\n\nKihoto Hollohan versus Zachillhu (1992): The Anti-Defection case\n\nIn this case the constitutional validity of the Constitution (Fifty-second Amendment) Act, 1985 was challenged on the grounds that the amendment was not ratified by the States.\n\nThough the Tenth Schedule was to deal with defection, it also seems to oust the jurisdiction of all courts by virtue of Paragraph 7.\n\nThe amendment brought about changes with respect to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the High Courts one of the provisions that require ratification by half of the States.\n\nA Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court upheld the validity of the Tenth Schedule but declared Paragraph 7 of the Schedule invalid for want of ratification.\n\nUnion of India versus Rajendra N. Shah (2021)\n\nin this case SC struck down provisions of the Constitution (97th Amendment) Act, 2011 to the extent that it introduced Part IX B in the Constitution to deal with co-operative societies.\n\nThe Court unanimously held that the amendment required ratification by at least one-half of the State legislatures as per Article 368(2) of the Constitution, since it dealt with an exclusive State subject of the Seventh Schedule.\n\nThe majority judgment invoked the doctrine of severability to make Part IXB operative only insofar as it concerns multi-State cooperative societies.\n\nIndia Middle East Europe Corridor (IMEC)\n\nContext: At the recent 18th G20 Summit, which was hosted by India, countries unanimously agreed to establish the India Middle East Europe Corridor (IMEC).\n\nCorridor to a new world\n\nIndia, EU, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Germany, France, Italy and USA have agreed to establish India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC).\n\nIMEC is expected to stimulate economic development through enhanced connectivity and economic integration between Asia, Arabian Peninsula and Europe.\n\nIMEC will comprise of two separate corridors. (i) Eastern Corridor connecting India and Arabian Gulf. (ii) Northern Corridor connecting Arabian Gulf to Europe.\n\nIt will include a railway line that will provide a reliable and cost-effective cross-border ship to rail transit network to supplement existing maritime and road transport routes – enabling goods and services to transit to, from and between India, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel and Europe.\n\nAlong the railway route, IMEC will enable laying of cable for electricity and digital connectivity and pipe for clean hydrogen export.\n\nThis corridor will secure regional supply chains, increased trade accessibility, improve trade facilitation and support an increased emphasis on ESG impacts.\n\nReservation for women in politics\n\nContext: Women's Reservation Bill was introduced in the Parliament for providing 33% reservation of women in Lok Sabha and State Assemblies.\n\nWhat is Women Reservation Bill ?\n\nThe Women’s Reservation Bill proposes to reserve 33% of seats in the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies for women.\n\nFeatures:\n\nThe allocation of reserved seats shall be determined by such authority as prescribed by Parliament.\n\nOne third of the total number of seats reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes shall be reserved for women of those groups in the Lok Sabha and the legislative assemblies.\n\nReserved seats may be allotted by rotation to different constituencies in the state or union territory.\n\nTime line\n\nFor the first time in 1996 ,it was introduced in the Lok Sabha as the 81st Amendment Bill by the then Deve Gowda led United front government . Bill failed to get approval in the house and was referred to a joint parliamentary committee. JPC submitted its report, however bill lapsed with the dissolution of the Lok Sabha.\n\nIn 1998 , the bill was again introduced by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee led NDA government, but in absence of required support it again lapsed.\n\nThe Bill was subsequently reintroduced in 1999, 2002 and 2003, but failed to pass due to lack of majority.\n\nIn 2008, bill was again introduced as 108th constitution Amendment Bill. It was passed in Rajya Sabha but eventually lapsed after dissolution of the 15th Lok sabha.\n\nDespite the promises made in election manifesto of 2014 as well as 2019 , there is no development in this regard as such.\n\nHow many women are in Parliament?\n\nAbout 14% of the members in Indian Parliament are women, the highest so far. According to the Inter­ Parliamentary Union, India has a fewer percentage of women in the lower House than its neighbours such as Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh — a dismal record.\n\nArguments in favour of the Bill\n\nAffirmative action is imperative to better the condition of women since our society in general and political parties in particular are inherently patriarchal.\n\nDespite the belief of the constituent assembly that every section would be represented proportionally, women are still under represented in Parliament.\n\nReservation to women would ensure a strong lobby arguing for issues that are being conveniently ignored.\n\nReservation at panchayat level have shown positive results, despite being termed as rubber stamp (*in some cases) , women’s are more likely to invest in goods which are crucial for women and children.\n\nThe prevalent social tribulations like crime against women, skewed sex ratio, low LFPR and poor health indices require more women in the roles of policy and decision making.\n\nArguments against the Bill\n\nOpponents argue that it would perpetuate the unequal status of women since they would not be perceived to be competing on merit.\n\nThey also contend that this policy diverts attention from the larger issues of electoral reform such as criminalisation of politics and inner party democracy.\n\nReservation of seats in Parliament restricts choice of voters to women candidates.\n\nRotation of reserved constituencies in every election may reduce the incentive for an MP to work for his constituency as he may be ineligible to seek re-election from that constituency.\n\nWomen’s interests cannot be isolated from other social, economic and political strata.\n\nTo Conclude\n\nTo start with, some proponent suggest that reservation should be provided for women in political parties.\n\nSome has also suggested to have dual member constituencies (where constituencies will have two MPs, one of them being a woman).\n\nUntil and unless women are not a part of the policy making process, they cannot raise their voice for fellow women. This would result in a vicious cycle with this debate continuing for centuries. So, this is high time to finish this visible and unsaid inequality. Democracy cannot live a long life in an unequal society.\n\nPrime Minister’s Wi-Fi Access Network Interface (PM-WANI)\n\nContext: The Indian vision of Connectivity and digital empowerment of citizens can be realised through the large-scale implementation of PM-WANI scheme.\n\nOn the proposal of Department of Telecom (DoT) to proliferate broadband through public wi-fi networks cabinet approved the PM-WANI framework.\n\nThis framework takes forward the goal of National Digital Communications Policy, 2018 (NDCP) of creating a robust digital communications infrastructure.\n\nThe PM-WANI framework envisages provision of Broadband through Public Wi-Fi Hotspot providers. It will consist of elements such as Public Data Office (PDO), Public Data Office Aggregator (PDOA), App Provider and Central Registry.\n\nObjective of PM-WANI\n\nThis framework aims to proliferate broadband access through public Wi-Fi networks, with a focus on creating a robust digital communications infrastructure in India.\n\nOne of the primary objectives of PM-WANI is to simplify the process of providing public Wi-Fi services.\n\nThe spread of public Wi-Fi broadband promises better internet service, especially in rural areas where BharatNet is setting up hotspots.\n\nFeatures\n\nPublic Data Offices (PDOs)\n\nLast-mile public Wi-Fi providers, known as PDOs, do not require licenses or registration, and they are not obligated to pay fees to the DoT.\n\nThis removes bureaucratic hurdles and encourages local shops and small establishments to become Wi-Fi providers.\n\nPublic Data Office Aggregators (PDOAs)\n\nThe entities that aggregate last-mile providers, known as PDOAs, only need to register, and no fees are charged for this registration.\n\nThe process is streamlined, with registration typically completed within seven working days of receiving applications.\n\nApp Providers\n\nThe PM-WANI framework encourages the participation of App Providers who offer services for registering and authenticating users.\n\nThese apps facilitate user access to public Wi-Fi hotspots and enhance the overall user experience.\n\nCentral Registry\n\nCentral Registry will maintain the details of App Providers, PDOAs, and PDOs.\n\nIt is currently maintained by the Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DoT).\n\nBenefits\n\nConnectivity:\n\nPM-WANI aims to provide ubiquitous digital connectivity across the country.\n\nBy creating a network of interoperable public Wi-Fi hotspots (PDOs), it offers a last-mile distribution of broadband at affordable prices, making internet access accessible to even the remotest areas.\n\nAffordability:\n\nThe packages of Rs 5-10 for Wi-Fi access make Wi-Fi affordable, especially for low-income households and rural communities.\n\nThis makes high-speed internet affordable, bridging the digital divide that has long persisted.\n\nSimplified Operations:\n\nPM-WANI eliminates the need for licenses or permits to operate public Wi-Fi hotspots.\n\nThis simplifies the process for entrepreneurs and startups, promoting innovation and competition in the digital connectivity space.\n\nOpen and Scalable Framework:\n\nLike the success of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in the financial sector, PM-WANI provides an open and scalable framework for internet distribution.\n\nThis encourages the participation of various entities, including PDOs, PDOAs, and app providers, creating a dynamic ecosystem.\n\nBusiness Opportunities:\n\nThe framework allows for the unbundling of internet distribution at the last mile, reducing the need for additional licensing fees.\n\nThis opens business opportunities for aggregators, enabling them to play a crucial role in delivering affordable internet access.\n\nLocal Entrepreneurship:\n\nPM-WANI nurtures the growth of local entrepreneurs, who can set up PDOs in small shops, local establishments, and even households.\n\nThis empowers these entrepreneurs to augment their monthly earnings while promoting internet usage in their communities.\n\nUtilization of Existing Infrastructure:\n\nPM-WANI can make better use of existing infrastructure laid out by major companies like RailTel and GAIL, which is currently underutilized.\n\nIt encourages Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Telcos to expand their reach to underserved areas by turning their end customers into retailers of internet services.\n\nInteroperability and Scalability:\n\nPM-WANI's unique Indian approach to interoperability, openness, and scalability makes it well-suited to address the diverse connectivity needs of the country.\n\nIt can grow organically and adapt to changing technology landscapes.\n\nDigital Empowerment:\n\nPM-WANI contributes to the digital empowerment of citizens by providing them with affordable and accessible internet access.\n\nThis empowers individuals with the knowledge and opportunities that the digital world offers.\n\nAsset Monetisation in Railways? [Benefits & Challenges]\n\nContext: Indian Railways' is making efforts to enhance the use of its valuable lands near railway stations, the decision has been made to replace ageing, sparsely distributed buildings with multi-story structures. This initiative is a crucial component of their mission to transform major railway stations and their surrounding areas into vibrant urban centres.\n\nAbout Asset Monetisation\n\nThis approach, often referred to as asset or capital recycling, involves unlocking the untapped potential of public assets that have been previously underutilised or unused.\n\nWith a projected investment of ₹111 lakh crores from FY20 to FY25 as part of the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), approximately 15-17% of this funding is expected to come from innovative strategies like asset monetization.\n\nIt's important to note that asset monetization is distinct from privatisation and asset slump sales. Instead, it represents a structured partnership with the private sector, governed by defined contractual frameworks.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe benefits of asset monetization are manifold.\n\nIt allows for diversified resource mobilisation, providing long-term capital for substantial infrastructure development, which is especially critical in the post-Covid-19 economic recovery.\n\nFurthermore, it enhances financial leverage and overall value for both companies and governments with significant stakes in these assets. For instance, Indian Railways possesses 0.51 lakh hectares of vacant land assets that could be put to more productive use.\n\nEfficiency gains are another advantage, with the private sector often delivering superior operational efficiencies for underutilised infrastructure assets. This is exemplified by non-core assets like residential buildings and office spaces with BSNL and MTNL.\n\nOther benefits include sustained economic growth through improved infrastructure, generating employment opportunities, and enhancing overall quality of life through investments in core assets and social infrastructure such as schools and hospitals.\n\nChallenges\n\nFinancial challenges include the need for a sustained and robust asset pipeline to attract investors, as well as identifying revenue streams and revenue transfer mechanisms for different infrastructure assets. There is also the concern that leasing public utilities to private investors could lead to higher prices for consumers.\n\nRegulatory challenges encompass the absence of independent sectoral regulators with domain expertise, structural issues like legal uncertainty, and the absence of a robust bond market hindering private investment in infrastructure. Inefficient dispute resolution mechanisms are also a hindrance.\n\nOther challenges involve the reluctance of states to participate despite holding substantial assets, uncertainties posed by factors like Covid-19, climate-related disasters, and economic transformation during Industrial Revolution 4.0, as well as concerns about political influence and corruption.\n\nWay Forward\n\nThe National Monetization Pipeline (NMP) with sector-specific plans has been introduced to assist the private sector in planning their fundraising for brownfield asset inventory with potential financing opportunities.\n\nAdditional steps include building the capacity and expertise of public authorities, ensuring systematic and transparent asset allocation, working closely with states to leverage assets for resource mobilisation, and developing robust brownfield models and frameworks.\n\nFlexibility in contracts, strong dispute resolution mechanisms, and innovative regulatory frameworks such as InvITs and REITs are recommended to encourage participation from various investor classes, including global pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and retail investors, similar to the successful model of POWERGRID Infrastructure Investment Trust (PGInvIT).\n\nEnsembles of Hoysalas inscribed on UNESCO world heritage list\n\nContext: During the 45th session of the World Heritage Committee in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, ‘the Sacred Ensembles of the Hoysalas,’ encompassing three temples located in Karnataka, have been added to UNESCO's World Heritage List.\n\nMore about the news:\n\nThe Hoysala Temples, now mark India's 42nd UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nIn addition to this, Rabindranath Tagore's Santiniketan, a university town in West Bengal, was also granted world heritage status.\n\nThe Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) revealed that India had submitted the nomination dossier for, ‘the Sacred Ensembles of the Hoysalas to the World Heritage Centre in January 2022,’ and the site had been on UNESCO's tentative list since 2014.\n\nHoysala Temples\n\nThe Hoysala Temples, constructed during the 12th and 13th centuries by the Hoysala kings, are dedicated to deities Shiva and Vishnu.\n\nChennakeshava temple, situated at the heart of Belur (Hassan district) within a traditional settlement surrounded by the remnants of a mud fort and a moat.\n\nHoysaleswara Temple is located on the banks of Dwarasamudra tank in Halebidu (Hassan district), a town featuring numerous protected and unprotected temples, archaeological ruins, and mounds.\n\nKeshava Temple stands at the centre of Somanathapura village (Mysore district).\n\nAbout Belur Chennakeshava Temple Complex:\n\nChennakeshava Temple Complex, is situated along the banks of the Yagachi River.\n\nThis remarkable complex is ingeniously designed within a rectangular layout. Encircled by four straight streets, this layout facilitates the traditional ritual circumambulation of the deity, offering devotees an immersive religious experience.\n\nIn a remarkable display of dedication and craftsmanship, construction of the Chennakeshava Temple commenced in the year 1117 AD.\n\nThe temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu, a central deity in Hinduism. It serves as a sacred haven for devotees seeking solace and spiritual connection with the divine.\n\nOne of the most captivating features of the Chennakeshava Temple is its richly sculptured exterior. These intricate carvings narrate compelling stories from the life of Lord Vishnu, his divine incarnations, and the epic narratives of the Ramayana and Mahabharata.\n\nInterestingly, among these depictions, there are also representations of Lord Shiva, showcasing a harmonious coexistence of deities within the Hindu pantheon.\n\nChennakeshava Temple has been a centre of uninterrupted worship since its establishment. It continues to thrive as a vibrant hub of devotion and remains a pilgrimage site for Vaishnavite devotes seeking spiritual fulfillment.\n\nAbout Hoysaleshwar Temple of Halebid:\n\nHalebid, formerly known as Dorasamudhra, emerged as the capital of the Hoysala empire at the zenith of its power. This transition marked a pivotal moment in the region's history, and at the heart of Halebid stands the Hoysaleshwara Temple.\n\nConstructed in the year 1121 CE during the reign of King Vishnuvardhana Hoysaleshwara, this temple stands as a testament to the artistic prowess and devotion of the Hoysala dynasty.\n\nThe Hoysaleshwara Temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, a principal deity in Hinduism. It serves as a place of worship and reverence for both locals and pilgrims, drawing them into its sacred embrace.\n\nThis architectural marvel was made possible through the collective efforts of the affluent citizens and merchants of Dorasamudra. Their patronage and financial support enabled the temple's construction, exemplifying the community's deep-rooted faith and commitment to their religious beliefs.\n\nWhat truly sets the Hoysaleshwara Temple apart are the more than 240 exquisite wall sculptures that adorn its outer walls. These intricate carvings narrate captivating stories from Hindu mythology and historical events.\n\nHalebid extends its cultural heritage beyond the Hoysaleshwara Temple. Within the walled complex, one can discover three Jaina basadi (temples) dating back to the Hoysala period. These temples serve as a testament to the religious diversity and harmonious coexistence of different faiths in the region. Additionally, a stepped well adds to the historical significance of the site, reflecting the ingenious engineering achievements of the time.\n\nAbout Kesava Temple of Somnathpur:\n\nThe Kesava Temple is a veritable masterpiece, boasting a mesmerizing Trikuta architecture. It is dedicated to Lord Krishna in three distinct forms: Janardhana, Keshava, and Venugopala. This trifecta of deities embodies various facets of the divine and provides a multifaceted spiritual experience for visitors.\n\nEach intricately carved figure and ornament is a testament to the devotion and craftsmanship of the artisans of that era.\n\nThe Hoysala Empire: A Comprehensive Overview:\n\nThe Hoysala Empire, a prominent Kannadiga dynasty originating from the Indian subcontinent, held dominion over a significant part of present-day Karnataka during the span of the 10th to the 14th centuries. This period was marked by remarkable achievements in art, architecture, and religion. In this elaboration, we delve into the various facets of the Hoysala Empire, from its geographic expansion to its cultural contributions.\n\n1. Geographic Expansion\n\nThe Hoysala Empire was initially established in the landscapes of Malenadu, a region nestled within the Western Ghats.\n\nHowever, the 12th century saw the Hoysalas capitalizing on the internal strife between the Western Chalukya Empire and the Kalachuris of Kalyani.\n\nThis opportunistic maneuver allowed them to annex territories in present-day Karnataka and the fertile regions north of the Kaveri delta, now part of Tamil Nadu\n\nBy the 13th century, their dominion extended to encompass most of Karnataka, substantial portions of northwestern Tamil Nadu, and segments of western Andhra Pradesh within the Deccan Plateau.\n\n2. Political History:\n\nInitially, the Hoysalas were vassals or feudatories of the Chalukyas of Kalyani.\n\nTheir capital was situated in Dwarasamudra (Halebeedu). The dynasty's inception was credited to Sala, and his successors included Vinayaditya and Balalla I.\n\nHowever, the zenith of Hoysala power came under the reign of Vishnuvardhana, also known as Bittideva.\n\nVishnuvardhana's remarkable military acumen was highlighted by his decisive victory over the Cholas in the Battle of Talakadu, earning him the title \"Talkadugonda.\"\n\nIn commemoration of this triumph, he commissioned the construction of the Kirtinarayana Temple in Talakadu and the Chennakesava Temple in Beluru.\n\n3. Religious Patronage:\n\nThe Hoysalas were renowned patrons of Shaivism, Vaishnavism, and Jainism.\n\nVishnuvardhana himself converted to Srivaishnavism under the influence of Sri Ramanujacharya, who settled in Melukote, Karnataka.\n\n4. Literary Contributions:\n\nThe Hoysala era witnessed a flourishing of literature in both Kannada and Sanskrit.\n\nNotable literary works from this period include \"Harihara\" and \"Raghavanka's Harishchandracharite\" in Kannada, as well as \"Nemichandra's Leelavati Prabhanda\" in Sanskrit.\n\nEvolution of Hoysala Architecture: From Inception to Flourishing Style:\n\nThe Vesara style, from its nascent stage under the patronage of the Badami Chalukyas in the 7th century, it matured during the Western Chalukya era in the 11th century.\n\nHowever, it reached its zenith as an independent and distinct style during the reign of the Hoysalas in the 13th century.\n\n1. The Temple-Centric Hoysalas\n\nThe Hoysala rulers were renowned for their prolific temple construction. Their architectural style is often described as \"temple-centric,\" reflecting their deep devotion to Hindu deities such as Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu, and various manifestations of the Goddess.\n\n2. Star-Shaped Ground Plans\n\nOne of the hallmark features of Hoysala architecture is the star-shaped ground plan (known as Stellate plan) employed in many of their temples, although staggered square plans are sometimes observed.\n\nThe temples were erected on a raised platform called Jagati, which stood at approximately 1 meter in height.\n\nThese temples exhibit a symmetrical arrangement of multiple shrines and the walls and staircases of the temple followed a zigzag pattern.\n\n3. Soapstone as the Primary Building Material\n\nThe Hoysalas favoured soapstone (chloritic schist) as their primary construction material.\n\nThis soft stone allowed for exquisite carving and intricate detailing, enabling the creation of the elaborate sculptures and motifs that adorn the temples.\n\n4. Intricate Carvings\n\nThese intricate sculptures grace nearly every surface of the temples, depicting scenes from Hindu mythology, celestial beings, deities, animals, and intricate geometric patterns.\n\nProminently featured are various forms of Lord Vishnu, especially Chennakesava, and Lord Shiva.\n\nLet us look at some of the distinctive architectural elements:\n\nMakartorana: This feature leads to the mantapa of the temples, adorned with sculpted images of Makara in lintel form overhead.\n\nMantapa: Hoysala temples incorporate both open (outer mantapa) and closed mantapa (inner mantapa), with highly ornate ceilings bearing mythological figures and floral designs.\n\nPillars: Circular pillars in the mantapas of Hoysala temples are a common sight, each featuring four brackets at the top adorned with sculpted figures.\n\nCella (Vimana): Vimanas in Hoysala temples are plain on the inside but profusely elaborated on the outside.\n\nShrine: Hoysala temples are classified based on the number of shrines, such as ekakuta (one shrine) or dvikuta (two shrines).\n\nDevelopment of Kalasa: A characteristic feature of Hoysala temple towers is the vase-shaped water pot placed atop.\n\nSalabhanjika: These mythical female figures, with stylized feminine attributes, are found in four brackets on top of the pillars and on each side of the makartorana.\n\nKirtimukh: The figure of kirtimukh often embellishes the vimana of certain Hoysala temples.\n\nMythical Presentation: Hoysala art excels in presenting Hindu mythology through sculpted and architectural forms. Scenes from the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Puranas intricately adorn temple walls.\n\nErotica: Some temples feature erotic sculptures, influenced by the prevailing Sakta tradition.\n\nInfluence of Chola and Chalukya Art:\n\nFor instance, the \"Sthambha buttalikas\" pillar image in Hoysala art exhibits influences from Chola and Chalukya artistic traditions.\n\nA notable example of Chola influence can be seen in the image of Mohini on one of the pillars in the Chennakeshava temple, seamlessly integrated into Hoysala artistry.\n\nAlso: Information about UNESCO World Heritage Sites\n\nHoysala architecture represents a captivating chapter in the history of Indian art and temple construction. Its evolution, from its nascent stages to the mature and distinctive style that emerged under Hoysala rule, showcases a profound commitment to temple-centric design, intricate carvings, and a fusion of artistic influences.\n\nProject Cheetah\n\nContext: The first batch of eight cheetahs from Namibia arrived on September 17, 2022, officially launching Project Cheetah, India’s cheetah introduction programme. An overview of the project as it completes one year.\n\nWhat is Project Cheetah?\n\nIt is an ambitious project to re-establish the species within its historical range in India.\n\nThe project hopes to benefit global cheetah conservation efforts by providing up to 100 000 km2 of habitat in legally protected areas and an additional 600 000 km2 of habitable landscape for the species.\n\nCheetahs fulfil a unique ecological role within the carnivore hierarchy and their restoration is expected to enhance ecosystem health in India. As a charismatic species, the cheetah can also benefit India’s broader conservation goals by improving general protection and ecotourism in areas that have been previously neglected.\n\nPresent status:\n\nIn total, 20 adult African cheetahs have been imported so far.\n\nSo far, only 12 of the 20 cheetahs were ever released into the wild, with a few being brought back multiple times to the Kuno National Park (KNP).\n\nSix of the cheetahs which came from Africa have died.\n\nWhy did the cheetahs die?\n\nThere have been a variety of reasons and causes attributed to the deaths of the six adults and three cubs. Radio collars are not the underlying reason for the deaths of any of these cats, at least that is the officially stated position.\n\nOne needs to determine if the African cheetahs are susceptible to certain insects and parasites in India, and if the collars provide a micro-environment conducive for these to thrive."
