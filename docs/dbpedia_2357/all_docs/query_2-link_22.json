        "text": "Beginning with humble caves and squat flat-roofed temples, Hindu architecture, then, evolved over the centuries and, despite some regional variation, arrived at a standard arrangement which involved a huge walled complex with massive decorative gateways giving entrance to a sacred space of lesser shrines dominated by the main temple and its monumental series of towers. The design has become so standard that it is copied even today in temples across the world from New Delhi to Malibu, California. Hindu architecture evolved over the centuries from simple rock-cut cave shrines to massive and ornate temples which spread across the Indian sub-continent and beyond, forming a canonical style which is still adhered to today in modern Hindu temples across the globe. Essential elements of the style are precise and harmonious geometry when viewed from all four sides and above, the square form and grid ground plans, soaring towers, and elaborate decorate sculpture which includes gods, worshippers, erotic scenes, animals, and floral and geometric patterns.\n\nLocal traditions govern temple architectural typologies; often, structural styles and building methods were progressively blended depending on congregation of experts and promotion of construction activity. While the texts enumerate many nuances in temple architectural styles, only about twenty-odd types dominate the landscape. Early natural caves and frescoed caverns, inspired by Buddhist prayer halls, evolved to rock-cut caves, which progressively incorporated iconographic objects and sculptures. The form evolved from simple, functional structures to imposing, magnificent buildings, which indicate progression of elaboration of and opulence in ritualsâ€• it reflects complexities in symbolism too. Local materials and influences determined regional preferences for designs, which evidence mutual inductance and overlapping of styles. This paper documents the diverse and numerous Hindu temple architecture styles based on not only the designs and traditions that are more recurrently featured in ancient texts, but also the exemplars and archetypes that are most commonly observed in ancient temple structures.\n\nThis volume is a study of the beginning and evolution of temple architecture in India which covers sculptures and carvings as well. With over a hundred plates of temples and carvings on them including cave facades and pillar depictions it deals with temples constructed by the different ancient and medieval dynasties in Indian history particularly the early western Calukyan and later western Calukyans Pallava Pandya, Cola Hoyasala and Nayaka with illustrations that include maps plans of caves and even viharas and caityas it undertakes a study of the temples found in different states of India. The research discusses the variations in plans and elevations to examine development of temple architecture over time and new experiment actions in the building of temples by use of various materials. Reconstructing art and architectural styles from the remnants of the ruined temples in many places it explains terms and concepts in temple building and architecture and cites examples of various temple style and traditions including the best and earliest ones. The focus is on the Dravida and Nagara temple styles and a third hybrid form of sikhara that developed in the Deccan. Many Jaina temples are also covered."
