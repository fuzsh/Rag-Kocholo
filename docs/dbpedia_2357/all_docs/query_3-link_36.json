Thus, you can be assured that any article you read across our website is free of bias and is not produced by AI-platforms. Read about our editorial policies.\n\nA scenic drive surrounded by lush green rolling hills, juxtaposed with dense forests and cascading waterfalls landed us at Chikmagalur. The intoxicating aroma of coffee plantations filled the air, as we entered Karnataka’s popular hill station.\n\nThe place where coffee was grown in India for the first time, Chikmagalur can turn any tourist into a coffee lover. Yes, even those who had never taken a liking to its generally bitter taste, including myself! But, it offers a lot more than that, especially for nature enthusiasts and trekkers.\n\nLocated 242 km (5 hours) from Bangalore, 150 km (4 hours) from Mangalore and 172 km (4 hours) from Mysore, Chikmagalur is truly one of the best getaway destinations in Karnataka. Having explored the place in depth, I will take you through a detailed travel guide in this article – from the top places to visit in Chikmagalur, must-try foods, activities and 3-day itinerary. Let’s get started?\n\nTop 10 Things To Do In Chikmagalur\n\n# 1 – Immersive coffee experiences\n\nChikmagalur’s coffee history dates back several centuries. Saint Baba Budan brought a few seeds of coffee from Mecca and placed it here for the first time in 1670 AD. This resulted in the first coffee plant ever grown in India, eventually leading to a flourishing coffee industry in the region. Thus, you will be able to indulge in a variety of coffee experiences, such as coffee plantation walks, coffee museum tour, and a 4D coffee experience zone that give you a taste of many unique varieties of coffee.\n\n# 2 – Wildlife sightings\n\nThe hill station is surrounded by a wildlife sanctuary as well as a national park, where you can spot many animals such as elephants, deers and leopards in their natural habitats. Thus, going for wildlife safaris is one of the most exciting things to do in Chikmagalur. We’ll talk more about each of them in the next section.\n\n# 3 – Trekker’s paradise\n\nChikmagalur is filled with several hills that have become very popular for both easy and challenging treks over the years. These include Baba Budangiri, Kudremukh, Z Point, Kemmangundi and Karnataka’s highest peak Mullayanagiri. Thus, trekking is one of the best things to do in Chikmagalur.\n\nDid You Know?\n\nNeelakurinji, a rare bluish-purple flower that blooms once in 12 years, was witnessed in large numbers in and around Baba Budangiri Hills in Chikmagalur in September 2022, right after the monsoon season. Naturally, it became a social media rage and tourists flocked the hill station to see the endless blankets of purple hues. However, it’s a rare occurrence that’s spotted in various parts of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu at different times.\n\n# 4 – Explore waterfalls & rivers\n\nFrom the Bhadra river that flows through Chikmagalur, to Jhari and Manikyadhara waterfalls, the place has several water bodies that offer unparalleled peace and tranquility. Go for a fun picnic with your friends and family to any of these spots, or simply soak in their beauty all by yourself.\n\n# 5 – River rafting\n\nSurrounded by thick foliage and breathtaking views, rafting through the Bhadra river is a must-try for adventure enthusiasts. There are several companies such as Thrillophilia, Universal Adventures and Ace Paddlers that offer rafting packages with the essential safety gear, certified instructors and brief training before starting the activity. The price usually starts from INR 1,200 and can go up depending on the kind of package you choose.\n\n# 6 – Try unique local dishes\n\nOne of my favorite parts about our Chikmagalur trip was trying Karnataka’s special delicacies that can’t be found in most of our cities. We tasted unusual rice flour dishes such as Akki Roti, Kadambalu, and south Karnataka-style curries at various eateries. Each of them offered a distinct flavor profile and taste unique to the region.\n\n# 7 – Watch stunning sunsets\n\nWhether you wish to see the sun’s yellow-red light glimmering on sprawling lakes or serene meadows, there are stunning locations in Chikmagalur to watch the setting sun. These include the Mallanduru Sunset Point, Hirekolal Lake and Ayyanakere Lake.\n\n# 8 – Camping and picnics\n\nAbundant hills, valleys, and waterfalls make Chikmagalur a perfect destination for setting up those camping tents and picnic spreads. Just remember to carry some handy snacks, torch lights, jackets, and comfortable shoes.\n\n# 9 – Shop for coffee & spices\n\nWith varieties of coffees and spices grown right here, you will find tons of wholesale stores, and premium shops selling affordable coffees and spices. So, purchase some to take back home as a souvenir.\n\nTWT Tip: We found some of the most premium coffees at very affordable rates at Jayanthi Coffee. The Monsoon Malabar Coffee that I tried here has now become a part of my everyday life. I order it from their official website regularly now, because of its therapeutic aroma, smoothness and caramel-like taste.\n\n# 10 – Ancient temple hopping\n\nChikmagalur is surrounded by many intricately-carved stunning temples built by the Hoysala kingdom in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries. Some of these gorgeous pieces of art, such as Hoysaleswara Temple and Chennakesava Temple, are also listed under the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, making them a must-visit.\n\n10 Best Places To Visit In Chikmagalur\n\n1. Mullayanagiri Peak\n\nThe highest peak in Karnataka at 6317 feet, Mullayanagiri is one of Chikmagalur’s best sightseeing spots. It is among the easier places for trekking as it contains just 500 steps and you can take your vehicle till the base point.\n\nOnce you reach the top, enjoy the stunning vistas of the Western Ghats and simply relax for a while as you breath in the fresh air. You can also visit a small Shiva temple on the top called Mullappa Swamy Temple, named after sage Mullappa Swamy, who is believed to have meditated at a cave near the temple.\n\nAfter going back to the base point, we relished on piping hot maggi at one of the many food stalls available near the parking lot. It felt like a good reward for all the workout that was done to climb up.\n\nLocation: Google Maps\n\nTimings: 6 AM – 6 PM\n\n2. Coffee Museum\n\nA must-visit place in Chikmagalur, this museum is set up by the Coffee Board of India. It offers an educative tour about the various coffees of India, their history, how they are grown, and each of their distinct flavor profiles through interactive infographic boards, maps and videos.\n\nI remember learning about the Monsoon Malabar coffee here for the first time, as the tour explained how this particular coffee’s beans are exposed to the rains and fermented for a long time, reducing its acidity drastically. You can also touch and smell the beans to understand the difference between each variety.\n\nLocation: Google Maps\n\nTimings: 10 AM – 5 PM (Monday to Friday)\n\nEntry: INR 20\n\n3. Baba Budangiri\n\nThis is the second highest mountain in Chikmagalur and houses the shrine of saint Baba Budangiri, the first person who brought coffee beans to India from Mecca and planted it in this mountain.\n\nAlso called Datta Peeta, the Baba Budangiri mountain is a popular trekking and camping zone with several caves, rocky terrains and lush green carpets.\n\nYou can get a stunning bird’s eye view from the top of the mountain, making it perfect for photography and videography enthusiasts. Remember to also cover Deviramma Temple and Manikyadhara Falls during your visit to Baba Budangiri.\n\nLocation: Google Maps\n\nTimings: 8 AM – 5 PM\n\n4. Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary & Tiger Reserve\n\nAround 2 hours away from the Chikmagalur bus stand, the Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary & Tiger Reserve is a habitat for 200+ bird species, 30+ tigers and 20+ leopards, besides umpteen deers and elephants.\n\nOur safari was totally worth it, as we could spot many of these wild animals, including an adorable sloth bear. Spread across 500 square kilometers of jungles, the sanctuary offers bus and jeep safaris.\n\nYou can also visit the Bhadra dam, go boating in the Bhadra river and stay back overnight at one of the many jungle lodges here.\n\nLocation: Google Maps\n\nTimings: 6:30 AM – 8:30 AM & 4 PM – 6 PM\n\nEntry: For bus, INR 500 per adult, INR 250 per child (6-12 years) & INR 700 per foreigner; For jeep, INR 600 per adult, INR 250 per child and & INR 900 per foreigner\n\nTWT Tip: It can be very exciting to spot deers, elephants, bears and tigers in their natural homes. However, remember to remain silent at all times to avoid scaring them away. If you’re looking for a good place to eat nearby while on your way here from Chikmagalur, Honey Dewzzz Resort is the only decent place we found.\n\n5. World Of Coffee\n\nThis is India’s first 4D interactive coffee experience cafe started by Jayanthi Coffee, a local coffee brand with a 70+ years old legacy. It is truly one of the most interesting places to visit in Chikmagalur.\n\nOne of the most interesting parts about our visit was an Aroma Station, where we could examine the distinct fragrances of roasted coffee beans, coffee blossoms and green beans through pumping machines.\n\nYou will also find a massive board narrating the history of coffee, and a demo of different types of coffee making, combined with a tasting session. They organize a tour of their coffee estate too at an extra charge.\n\nWe purchased some coffee-flavored chocolates, coffee powders, a filter coffee machine and a 3D fridge magnet, featuring Chikmagalur’s specialties as souvenirs to take back home. Since then, I have been hooked to their coffee and order them online regularly.\n\nLocation: Google Maps\n\nTimings: 10 AM – 8:30 PM\n\n6. Hirekolal Lake\n\nSurrounded by the stunning mountains of the Western Ghats, the Hirekolal Lake offers unparalleled peace and abundant beauty.\n\nEspecially during sunset, it is a sight to behold as the skies get painted in hues of purple, red, orange, yellow and blue against the undulating green carpets. We simply chose to sit here for sometime and soak in the gorgeous views.\n\nLocation: Google Maps\n\nTimings: 6 AM – 6 PM\n\n7. Jhari Waterfalls\n\nWith buttermilk-like water cascading from the mountains amidst dense forests, Jhari Waterfalls is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Chikmagalur.\n\nA small pool that forms at the bottom of the waterfalls attracts swimmers to this location regularly. Even if you’re not seeking adventure, just sitting here silently as you listen to the tunes of the gushing water while marveling at the natural beauty of the area can be a therapeutic experience.\n\nNaturally, it offers the best views during or right after the monsoon season as the thickness of the water is at its best after heavy rainfall. You can visit this place after covering Mullayanagiri or Baba Budangiri mountain.\n\nLocation: Google Maps\n\nTimings: 8 AM – 5 PM\n\n8. Hoysala Temples – UNESCO World Heritage Sites\n\nHave you ever seen the intricate south Indian temple jewelry come to life in the form of giant pillars and walls? This could become a reality at the two Hoysala temples located on the outskirts of Chikmagalur – Chennakeshava Temple, Belur & Hoysaleshwara Temple, Halebidu.\n\nListed under UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the two temples are located just 25 minutes away from each other and feature the most exquisite carvings on their stone pillars and walls. Whether you’re an architecture enthusiast, history buff or an admirer of ancient art, these magnificent temples are a must-visit, because it would be hard to ever find such spectacular stone carvings anywhere else.\n\nThe Chennakeshava Temple was built by the Hoysala empire in 1116 AD and its construction took 103 years to complete! It features glorious craftsmanship depicting mythological and historical stories. Don’t miss Lord Vishnu’s 24 forms sculpted on the walls of the inner sanctum, which offer unique visual effects created by light at various times of the day.\n\nThe 12th century Hoysaleshwara Temple, on the other hand, comprises twin Shiva temples that stand on a star-shaped bottom structure.
