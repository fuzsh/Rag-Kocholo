        "text": "Category: Everyday stories\n\nIn and around Chikmagalur\n\nIt was summer vacation time and we wanted to explore a new destination. Research was done at different levels and finally the destination was decided: Bangalore and Chikmagalur. Bags packed, essentials taken care of and off we went to the IT/Garden City of India.\n\nWe were visiting our cousins in Bangalore for the first time and I must acknowledge that I have hardly met such a warm family! Glad we could also catch up with our friends. We tried out various eateries, cafes, and home cooked south Indian food. My favorite I would say was ‘Donne Biryani’ and the prawns cooked at home. When in Bangalore, Koshy’s at MG Road is a must visit. We also visited the HAL, Heritage Centre & Aerospace Museum and walked around Cubbon Park, located in the heart of the city.\n\nAfter a three-day stay at Bangalore we drove off to Chikmagalur, the land of coffee! We were mesmerized by the scenic view on the way, beautiful lakes after short intervals, windmills on the hill-tops, greenery, and the smooth roads. We stopped at quite a few locations to appreciate the beauty. Bangalore to Chikmagalur is a six-hour drive when driving at leisure. And one can take detours to visit the temples in Belur and Halebidu. We decided to visit the Belur, Chennakeshava Temple.\n\nBelur was the early capital of the Hoysala Empire in the 11th century, before they built Dorasamudra (modern Halebid). According to various read outs, in the inscriptions discovered here, Belur was called Beluhur, Velur or Velapura during the Hoysala era. And the temple is supposed to be last of the great Hoysala temples located near Yagachi River in Karnataka. It is a major tributary of Hemavathi River. It rises in the Baba Budan Hill Range near the city of Chikmagalur and flows through the Belur taluk, Hassan District. The temple was supposedly built over three generations and took 103 years to finish!\n\nAfter appreciating the craftsmanship at the Chennakeshava temple we started our journey to our home stay which was away from the town. It’s a coffee estate which had a few sections built into cottages and a coffee shop. ‘Halli Berri’ staff were a polite lot and always trying to help. The home cooked food was delicious and easy on the stomach. We got a coffee plantation walk where we were informed about the stages of coffee-making and we could walk through the area to experience the green. There was a nursery too, where the coffee buds were grown until they could be planted across the estate.\n\nHebbe falls was on our list and we had to visit it. The drive to the Bhadra wildlife sanctuary where Hebbe falls was located was smooth. After reaching the gate we had to hop on to the local jeep. Though the ride till Hebbe fall was quite bumpy, the scenic view made it worth the while. The hill plantation along the way was a lighter shade of green and it was soothing to the eyes. We had to walk one kilometer to reach the falls, and we were enchanted by the first view of the gigantic fall. The sun shining on the water was a view that can make anybody’s heart dance.\n\nAnother precious gem we found was the Belavadi Veera Narayana Temple. Belavadi is a village, located at a distance of 29 km from Chikmagalur town and about 12 km from Halebidu, Karnataka, India. The place is described as Ekachakranagara of Mahabharata. As the folklore goes, Belavadi was where Bheem killed the demon Bakasura and protected the village and its people. One has to actually see it to believe its beauty. There are three forms of Vishnu in three different sections. This thousand-year old temples is less visited and is preserved by the ASI (Bangalore circle). A must-visit according to me!\n\nOn the way back we visited the Ayyanakere Lake, which is considered to be the second largest lake of Karnataka. We had a difficult time locating the exact view point. Finally found an entry point and the view was amazing.\n\nAnother place that I would recommend is the Shettihalli Rosary Church which was quite close to Hassan (30 mins). We decided to visit it on our way back to Bangalore. The road to the Church was not very good in some places but again the view was something else. We were awestruck when we first got the view of the church. The church is a masterpiece in many ways. It’s built on the banks of Hemavathi River in Shettihalli village of Hassan district. It is purported to have been constructed in 1860 by a French missionary named Abbe J. A. Dubois. In 1960, the Gorur-Hemavathi dam was constructed over the river which uprooted all villages surrounding the area of the church. Since then, every year during peak monsoon the land floods with water and submerges the church. Despite this, the church still stands, with only about one-third of its structure above the water’s surface. Over the years, it has acquired names like ‘Floating Church’ and ‘Submerged Church’. The church is a magnificent structure of Gothic Architecture.\n\nOverall the trip was wonderful as it was a mix of meeting friends, family and discovering some gems. It’s up to your stamina to make it busier or just breathe in the greens!\n\nSome SuddyMoody suggestions/facts – the Hoysala era was an important period in the development of South Indian art, architecture, and religion. The empire is remembered today primarily for Hoysala architecture; 100 surviving temples are scattered across Karnataka. You can explore the MG Park at Chikmagalur if you are traveling with kids, the toy train ride was super fun; if you are a real coffee lover and interested in its history visit the Coffee Museum at MG Road; go prepared according to the season and enjoy the hospitality in the coffee land of Karnataka!\n\nA Man with a Big Smile and a Bigger Passion!\n\nNot everyday I get to meet these extraordinary people and hence not everyday can I write a story about them…\n\nHello everyone! How have you all been?\n\nIt’s been a while since I have posted anything but here’s an amazing story I want to share.\n\nI go for a walk every morning and today (May 3) happened to be a lovely day! It rained yesterday making Delhi’s weather quite pleasant in the month of May.\n\nI have been exploring a forest area with friends recently for our walks. It’s dense and hence makes it easier to avoid the heat. There is always something new to explore here. It has these allocated usual paths and then there are these unallocated and unexplored pathways. Getting lost in these pathways and then discovering a new way is something that really excites me. I think it gives me the permission to make mistakes and still emerge with a lot of experience.\n\nToday, during our exploration, we came across a man who was happily watering the plants. We assumed that he is a member of the local body and was just doing his job. He seemed very approachable and something about his personality drew us to him.\n\nDuring our conversation we got to know that he was not working with the local body and in fact was doing this out of choice and very happily I must say. He gave us a tour of the area proudly showing off the plants. He had a story to tell about each plant. He remembered the dates he planted them. He supposedly used a compass to ensure that the plants are in the right place (depending on the sunlight). Not only did he plant the saplings, he came every other day to water them and ensuring that they were not dying. In a span of 10 years he had planted more than 400 trees!\n\nWhile he tries his best to ensure the plants are well protected, every other day there are mishaps. Sometimes a ‘nilgai’ destroys the plants, and at other times somebody flips the metal net put around the trees for safety. However, he doesn’t give up. He keeps coming back and starting again from scratch. All this for the environment and for his passion. Such is his passion that sometimes he completely forgets to have his meals.\n\nIt’s difficult to find people like him and very few with so much passion. His passion was inspiring and gave me lots of food for thought! He does this every day when nobody is watching him, just out of his passion. While explaining about the plants and giving us a tip or two he kept smiling his infectious smile.\n\nI did not ask his name. I was too engrossed to listen to his stories and tips.\n\nHow do you fuel your passion? What keeps you going? What is your ‘true’ passion? Let me know in your comments.\n\nMandala art by a beginner\n\nLiving with Endometriosis-II\n\nIts ok to NOT be OK! While my first article on endometriosis was about the positives, today I will focus on my vulnerabilities. I am sure it’s going to be difficult to write this one, but I will still try.\n\nMy experience with periods started with my sister telling me that I was impure during those 5 days. That’s how the society works right? During those days, I was not allowed to help Dadu to pluck flowers for morning Puja. I was not allowed to sit beside Maa when she did the Puja. This created a negative impression about this whole thing in my head and to top it all, the pain almost killed me every month.\n\nWhen I decided that I will pursue my graduation from Delhi, I was mainly worried about how I would manage my periods and the anxiety, and the pain related to it all by myself. But I guess we find our ways to deal with problems. Going through pain every month, dysmenorrhea, weakness, were inevitable. Sometimes I had to take pain killer injections for relief. There were days when I used to be all by myself in my PG room without anybody around. Many a times I puked and kept lying there because the pain was so severe that I could hardly move. After a few hours, when I felt slightly better, I would clean up my mess.\n\nAfter about five years in Delhi, I found my gynae through my sister. She put me on medication which helped me in every sense. I started living a normal life and I totally made sure I made the most of it. The periods were not painful, and I could make plans any day of the month. Nothing could stop me anymore, but myself!\n\nAfter about five years, I guess I got bored of my normal life and stopped the medication for a month or two. I heard a lot of people saying that these medicines have side effects and may lead to infertility. I had always wanted to have a child. I stopped the medicines without consulting my doctor. So, after two months the endometriosis pain came back with full force. It was worse than what it used to be and had spread. I could feel it. It started getting worse with every month.\n\nI went back to my gynae and told her how foolish I was. She tried putting me back on the same medicines, which did not help. She tried more medicines on me, but nothing helped. I went to 5-7 other doctors after that in search of some cure/relief. I even travelled to Hyderabad to seek another doctor’s help.\n\nOne day the pain was so bad that I went to Moolchand hospital (a different doctor) and upon examining me she suggested that I should get operated immediately to confirm it was endometriosis. So, after two days, I was admitted to the hospital. I take this opportunity to thank all my friends who were there to support me around at that point of time. My parents, who resided in a different city could only join me later. After the minimal invasive surgery, I was diagnosed with recto-vaginal endometriosis Grade 4. I was told that most of the endometrium and adhesives were burnt and I should get some relief now. During the time of discharge, they handed me a CD of the surgery and I could only gather strength to watch it only recently.\n\nBut endometriosis for me turned out be like a possessive ex-lover, who after being turned down would come back with even more passion. So once again, the pain was back after just a month of the surgery and it was WORSE! The days of pain increased from 5 to 10 to 15 and sometimes 20 days. Imaging getting just 5-10 days in a month to actually live your life the way you wanted.\n\nDuring my visits to the doctor, ultrasounds, and MRIs I was told by every doctor, technician and assistant that I should get married and try having a baby at the earliest. And that created a different kind of pressure.\n\nYes, I got married (did not rush at all) and had a baby (which was a miracle I believe) without any complication and I am full of gratitude today.\n\nI am currently on medications which stop my periods for a trimester and then I start all over again. My periods, when they come continue to be extremely painful. I take painkillers but they don’t always work. At the end of every trimester, I am stressed and anxious. I don’t feel OK about it, but I am learning to live with it.\n\nTrip down memory lane\n\nIn the beginning of 2019, my parents shifted base to Kolkata. Which meant selling off our house in Jamshedpur, the place which will always remain my home. This was a difficult decision but we had to play along because this was the best thing to do given that my parents are getting older.\n\nSo when my mother told me that we had some unfinished business to take care of in Jamshedpur, I immediately leapt at the idea.\n\nGoing back to Jamshedpur was quite important for me also because this time I had my yet-to-be-5 months old-son who accompanied us. Though he would not remember anything about this trip, it was important for me to take him to the place I called home.\n\nMy uncle came to pick us up from the railway station and during the drive he was updating us on the changes. I was already feeling like we don’t belong to the city anymore.\n\nOn the first day we finished the work for which we were visiting. The next day we decided to visit our home (which of course was not ours anymore). As soon as I asked the autowala to take a left turn to enter our lane my heart sunk. My head was flooded with many questions (where are we going to ask the autowala to stop? What would have happened to our house? How will I feel seeing our own house?). But I put my head to rest and tried keeping myself calm until I saw what has become of our house. It’s now a 4 storey house and almost nothing is similar to what we had left behind.\n\nLabourers were still finishing the paint work. I gathered some courage and entered the premises and looked around to see if I can still find a corner which seemed familiar. I wanted to click a picture of my baby there. And I was lucky, the ground floor veranda was same. Clicked a quick picture. One of the labourers asked me if there is something he can help with, and with a heavy voice I said this was our home and we were just walking around. He smiled as I guess he understood.\n\nWe met the neighbours who greeted us well and we met ‘dai’. She was our house-help and has always been family. She was so happy to see us and my baby. We talked endlessly and it was finally time to say a final goodbye to the ‘bank colony’ (which is what our neighbourhood was referred as).\n\nJamshedpur is home because of our house and also because of my uncles and aunts. All of them made us feel special, treated us with good food and warmth.\n\nI am writing this on our train journey back to Kolkata. Thinking about the whole trip and putting the memories in a pensieve (reference Harry Potter/Prof Dumbledore) for later while my baby is looking out of the window awestruck.\n\nThis was my baby’s first train journey and to the place which will always remain home!\n\nThe brand new mommy in the block!\n\nBack to telling tales after a hiatus…\n\nWhile I was away, I delivered a baby boy, adjusted myself to being sleep-deprived or managing with a few hours here and there, became an even better multi-tasker (I am known for my multi-tasking abilities!),got back to driving, mostly stepping out of the house once a week for an hour or two (this has been quite a challenge for a person who doesn’t like to sit at home even whenunwell). And now I know the worth of the little joys and feel grateful when I am allowed those.\n\nMy baby is almost five months old now and it’s quite interesting to notice how he has made his space. First mywomb, then my wardrobe, our bed, my phone (gallery), my mind, my heart, my time…he sure has made his space everywhere.\n\nMeanwhile, each day is a new day when you are dealing with an infant. And hence you end up honing your skills and acquire new ones.\n\nMeeting deadlines has always been my forte. But I have clearly reached new levels because now the deadlines are around an infant who can ensure thatmommy is on her toes all the time. The key is to put systems in place and bettering it everyday. Planning things in advance also matters but with an infant many a times when plan A fails,you have to be ready withplan B.\n\nPeople say that women are multi-taskers and I totally agree. HoweverI would also like to add that mothers are the epitome of multi–tasking.\n\nMotherhood hasalsogifted me patience! You are dealing with an infant who is unable to understandyouwhile at the same timeyou are trying your best to decipher their codes. It is this patience which helps you to think through a crisis.\n\nThe journey so far, while not being acakewalk,has been fulfilling. It has made me a better person. It has made me more sensitive and considerate to my surroundings,has made meappreciate the necessity of time management andthe drivefor quality work. After all, no stone can be left unturned for the little one!\n\nAnd now I am looking forward to balancing a healthy career and motherhood.\n\nWishing everyone a very happy and fulfilling New Year!\n\nExploring street art in the by-lanes of Lodhi Colony\n\nWe were heading towards Lodhi Garden, but then I suddenly remembered about the street art video I came across on YouTube recently (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYhPCRDgnzE). I have always liked the idea of street art. Had chanced upon a couple of them in Mumbai during one of my visits. Hence we took a detour and drove towards Lodhi Colony instead.\n\nWe drove through Meherchand market but couldn’t find any murals initially. We kept driving, got into lanes and finally found two pieces of wall art, one was being worked upon. Now that we had tasted blood we drove further, parked our car and then started exploring the neighborhood on foot.\n\nSlowly the beautiful art work unfurled before us as we walked between Khanna and Meherchand markets in the lanes and by-lanes of Lodhi colony. To me, it seemed like we were in a wonderland where fictitious characters came to life!\n\nI had seen the wall art showcasing a hawker selling balloons in the YouTube video so I kept insisting on walking until we find this particular artwork. And finally, we found it!\n\nThe Lodhi Art District, as the Lodhi Colony area called, is a project undertaken by St+art India (https://st-artindia.org/), an NGO established in 2014 by several artists. The first edition of the art festival took place in 2016 when more than 20 artists from India and from all over the world displayed their art on the walls of Lodhi Colony. This year the festival was called ‘Lodhi Art Festival’ and was scheduled between mid- January to mid- March.\n\nThe Lodhi Art District is an open exhibition of beautiful art work, a visual treat for all onlookers, passersby, photographers, tourists and the residents. Termed as India’s first open air art district, the best part of this place is its accessibility.\n\nThe Lodhi Art District has a mix of colorful and subtle art work, all of them a part of a narrative. There was a piece for every individual, something each one could relate to. I wished the artists were around so that I could talk to them and get to know more about their art. But it was also fun putting my imagination to work.\n\nBy the end of the tour I was reminded about Delhi’s beauty and charm!\n\nGateway to two pilgrim destinations Kishangarh!\n\n“The traveler sees what he sees. The tourist sees what he has come to see.” ― G.K. Chesterton\n\nThank God both my partner and I see what we see. I travel to make memories, rejuvenate and feed my inner soul!\n\nSince we had to plan a quick trip for the weekend, most of the places in the ‘to cover’ list which were further away had to be crossed out. By the end, we were only left with Kishangarh (Pushkar and Ajmer). I have always wanted to experience the Pushkar fair. Since it happens every year around November, we were not too sure if we should plan a trip now in February. Nonetheless, we went ahead with our plans. And, we did not regret our decision!\n\nRajasthan, to me, is all about colours, vibrancy, music, forts, tales and the people! I have covered many parts of the region. Had done a family trip to Bikaner, Jaisalmer and Jodhpur back in 2012. Had traveled to Udaipur on New Year’s Eve in 2016. Have visited Jaipur multiple times. Been to Bharatpur Sanctuary too. Kishangarh was my seventh destination within Rajasthan.\n\nKishangarh is a city in the Ajmer district of Rajasthan. The city also known as Marble City of India, is famous for a special kind of painting called ‘Bani Thani’. There are many tales about this style of painting which originated from Kishangarh. While there are quite a few things to see in Kishangarh, like the Kishangarh Fort, Nepheline Syenite, National Geological Monument, Nine Planets Temple, we decided to head straight to our stay (which was closer to Pushkar/Ajmer and around one hour away from the airport) as soon as we landed in Kishangarh. Before the Kishangarh airport was built, people had to travel to Pushkar and Ajmer by road which was time-consuming. People either directly traveled to Pushkar or flew to Jaipur and then traveled more than 100 kms to reach Pushkar/Ajmer.\n\nWe stayed at a beautiful ‘Ananta Spa and Resort’, which was surrounded by hills and hence had a picturesque view in the backdrop. We were quite happy with the place. The rooms were spacious, comfy and clean.\n\nThe next morning we set off for Pushkar city which was just 4 kms away from our resort. Pushkar is in the central part of Rajasthan and on the western side of the Aravalli Mountains. The city is known for its annual fair, which is the largest camel, horse and cattle fair in India and maybe the world. Every year traders, tourists, pilgrims and locals flock to the city in the month of October/November. Supposedly the Pushkar fair alone attracts over 200,000 visitors every year.\n\nPushkar is also famous for its temples. The most significant one in the city is the Temple of Lord Brahma. It is one of the very few existing temples dedicated to the Hindu creator, Lord Brahma in India and remains the most prominent among them. The Brahma Temple has many mythological tales about its origin. We heard a few interesting ones from the locals.\n\nNext, we visited the Savitri Mata temple. This temple is located at the top of the Ratnagiri Hill and is dedicated to Savitri, the wife of Lord Brahma. One would need to use either the cable car or the steps to reach the temple. You get a beautiful view of the city from the hill. There is an interesting mythological story behind its origin. It goes like – once, Lord Brahma was performing a yagna on the bank of the Pushkar Lake where the presence of his wife (Savitri) was required. But because she was late in arriving, Brahma married another girl (Gayatri) to complete this ritual on time. When Savitri arrived, she was upset to see someone else in her place and in her anger she cursed everyone present there. Later, she went to the Ratnagiri hills to atone for her deeds. The temple was hence constructed in her remembrance.\n\nNext on our list was the beautiful Pushkar Lake, one of the most prominent spots of pilgrimage. The beauty of the lake is because of the ghats surrounding it. There is a total of 52 ghats around the lake. Out of the 52 ghats used by pilgrims to take a holy dip, 10 important ghats on the periphery of the lake, have supposedly been declared as ‘Monuments of National Importance’. It was a beautiful experience to witness the serene, calm atmosphere at the lake, with devotees offering prayers, taking holy dips, birds silently making their way in the stunning blue and bright sky.\n\nWe then headed back to our resort and decided to relax for the rest of the day but only after we had our share of mouth-watering Rajasthani food. We were quite ambitious and thought we had the appetite to devour a whole Rajasthani thali. But we were wrong! The most common Rajasthani food are ‘Besan Gatte ki Sabji’, ‘Daal Bati Churma’, ‘Laal Maas’, ‘Rajasthani Kadhi’, ‘Ker Sangri’ and our thaali had it all and more!!!\n\nOn the last day, we checked out and headed to Ajmer, one of the oldest cities in Rajasthan. Ajmer is famously known for the ‘Ajmer Dargah’, the Mayo College and its lakes. We stopped at the Ana Sagar Lake which is spread over 13 kms and is the biggest in the city. The lake is surrounded by hills which makes it visually attractive.\n\nOn our way to the airport, we stopped over at the Nareli Jain Temple. It is a complex comprising of 14 temples built recently. It is known for its architecture and intricate stone carvings which gives it both a traditional yet contemporary look.\n\nThough Pushkar and Ajmer are mostly destinations for pilgrims, I think it has something for all travelers. I am not a very religious person but what my grandmother once told me made a difference. I remember I used to make faces whenever she asked us to accompany her to the temples. But one day she told me that I need not visit the temples for any religious sentiment but may visit it for its tales, architecture, views etc. That definitely made sense to me!\n\nKerala is alive and kicking!\n\nTrips which are not planned are the best because the whole process then becomes about discovering!! And, we just went with the flow – booked our tickets last minute, booked a hotel a week before leaving and we were all set…to visit Kerala (Kochi)! Honestly, we were a little unsure if we should visit Kochi after the devastating floods but, we were pleasantly surprised to see the city so alive!! By the end of the trip we were quite happy with our decision.\n\nCochin, another name for Kochi means “like-China”. When the Chinese migrated there in the 14th century, they thought that the region resembled China and therefore they named it Cochin. We were quite intrigued by the history of this city. It was invaded time and again by the Portuguese, then by the Dutch and finally by the British. It was not just the invaders, but because the city was an important spice trading center, it was also often visited by the Arabs, the Jews and the Chinese. The city thus has had an influence of many cultures.\n\nWe arrived at Kochi on a Saturday morning and took a cab directly from the airport to Fort Kochi (which was 1.5 hours away from the Kochi airport). Infact, we were ferried to Fort Kochi while we were in the cab. This was quite fascinating! The name ‘Fort Kochi’ is derived from ‘Fort Emmanuel’ which was the first Portuguese fort built in Asia in that area. But we could hardly see any remains of the Fort now.\n\nWe stayed at the Towerhouse (a Neemrana property) located at the Vasco da Gama (Fort Kochi) square and that’s where you get the best view of the famous Chinese nets that were introduced during the 14th century. After settling down, we picked up the map and zeroed down on places we wanted to visit. Though local transport was easily available, we decided to walk around Fort Kochi. The weather was lovely and every place we wanted to visit was approximately 1-2 kms away.\n\nSince it was a three days trip we decided to stay in Kochi and not venture elsewhere. People advised us to travel to Munnar, Alleppey, etc but we decided not to. There is a lot you can do in Kochi.\n\nSo here is my take on what you should not miss during a visit to Kochi:\n\nTrying the local food and cafes – We tried a variety of food during our stay and everything was just perfect. We tried the fish wrapped in banana leaf with rice at a local restaurant at Fort Kochi. We tried some lip smacking biryani at Kayees Rahmathullah near Mattacherry area. Kashi Art Café (at Fort Kochi) had a great vibe. As you enter you will find a lot of interesting artefacts. On another day we discovered this small but cozy café named Fusion Bay, which served local food. We were so hungry and ended up finishing everything we ordered. We left the place with a big smile. This place is a must visit!\n\nVisiting the Kerala Kathakali centre – if you want to get introduced to Kathakali as a dance form (an important part of Kerala culture) then this place is a must visit. It was a great experience for us. The intricate make-up was done right in front of us. We were also given a translation of the story which was presented that night and it helped us understand and enjoy the performance better. It was an overwhelming experience!\n\nTaking the ferry ride/boat jetty to Ernakulam – Although it was a nightmare because we had to stand in a long queue for almost 1.5 hours to buy the tickets, by the end of the ride I realized it was all worth it. The sunset, the waves, the glimpse of the INS ‘Vikramaditya’ made it worthwhile. It was all so serene.\n\nIndulge in some shopping – Since Kochi has been at the center of Indian spice trade, spice shopping is a must!! We bought some very aromatic spices from the local spice market at whole sale price. Most of the spices are grown in Kerala so there is no way you can miss the spice shops. We also picked up some Kerala cotton sarees from Jayalakshmi (located at MG road in Ernakulam).\n\nWitnessing fishermen at work – While walking around the streets, we also spent some time watching fishermen at work. They were using the Chinese fishing nets for fishing.\n\nGetting to know the city by visiting the museums – There are quite a few museums in the city. We visited three –\n\nThe Mattancherry Palace (which is also a museum) – The Palace was built and gifted by the Portuguese to the king of Cochin around 1555. The Dutch carried out some expansions and renovations in the palace in 1663, and thereafter it was popularly called the Dutch Palace. This was the best museum because it had a lot to offer- information about the history of Kerala and its people, wildlife, culture, handloom, architecture and murals.\n\nIndo-Portuguese museum – located inside the Bishop house. We got to see some old maps of Kerala which is of historical and geographical importance. This museum also showcased the Portuguese influence on the city.\n\nIndian Naval Maritime museum – As we entered the gate, a gentleman told us that two sturdy bunkers to store arms and ammunition (built by the British) were after many years converted into this museum . While this museum showcased a lot of information about the Indian navy, do not miss the documentaries screened inside. You get to learn a lot about the Indian navy’s glorious past.\n\nVisiting churches, synagogue, beaches – During our stay we also visited many other touristy places. I’m listing down some of the names here.\n\nCherai Beach located on the northern tip of the Vypin island\n\nParadesi Synagogue\n\nSanta Cruz Cathedral Basilica – The Dutch invaded and conquered Cochin in 1663. All Catholic buildings were supposedly destroyed but the St. Francis Church and the Cathedral were spared. The Dutch made the cathedral their arms storehouse. Later it fell into the hands of the British who demolished it when they took over Cochin in 1795. One of the decorative granite pillars of the destroyed Cathedral is still kept as a monument at the Basilica premises.\n\nSt. Francis Church – The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama died in Kochi in 1524 when he was on his third visit to India. His body was originally buried in this church but after fourteen years his remains were removed to Lisbon.\n\nJewish cemetery and Dutch cemetery – Although you won’t be able to enter the cemeteries but you can definitely get a glimpse from outside.\n\nSuddymoody tips\n\nTry getting an Ayurvedic healing massage – During my search for good Spas I came across some names which might be useful to you – The Fort Ayurveda spa, at the Fort House hotel in Fort Kochi, Ayurville, Agastya Ayurveda Massage and Wellness Center on Princess Street. I did not try any of them so please do your research well before going for a massage.\n\nVisit Spice bazaar on Broadway. Broadway is opposite to marine drive (Ernakulam). Though you will find spice market in Fort Kochi area, those might be expensive. Jew town also has a Spice market.\n\nDo go for the ferry/jetty rides but to avoid long queues make sure that it’s not a national holiday or during peak hours when people use ferries to commute the most!\n\nGoa, the place for every season\n\nI have visited Goa eight times in all. This may not be a big deal for many but I also know people who have never been to Goa. So this post is an attempt to help them make a plan. Goa is beautiful in every season so you need not wait for a December. I have been there in winter, summer, spring and monsoon!\n\nI am a beach person and hence visiting Goa has become almost like a yearly ritual for me. I feel a connection with the ocean. The vastness of an ocean amazes and scares me at the same time. It amazes me to witness that at one moment the waves are wild and the next moment it’s all calm. It gives you many life lessons.\n\nMy first ever visit to the city was in 1999. This was during a school excursion when we were visiting Mumbai, Pune, Lonavla and Goa. This was also my first ever trip with my school friends and my memories are still very fresh. This trip was during the new year’s eve of the millennium year. It seemed as if everybody was in Goa to celebrate the New Year. It was over-crowded. It was supposed to be fun but I hated Goa then and only because of the crowd. During that visit, I tried ‘feni’ (a local drink made of cashew); again I hated it because I tried it neat. It was quite bitter in taste. We visited the ‘Basilica of Bom Jesus’, a beautiful church which is a UNESCO listed world heritage site. It is located in old Goa and holds the mortal remains of St. Francis Xavier (one of the greatest Roman Catholic missionaries of modern times who was instrumental in the establishment of Christianity in India).\n\nI left Goa that year to not return ever, but who knew that from the next visit it would become a ritual?\n\nThe next visit was an offsite trip arranged by an organization I worked with in 2010. Employees from across India came to Goa for this trip. Day time was dedicated to presentations, case studies, learnings and conversations. Evenings were reserved only for fun! During this visit I started exploring Goa in its real sense. We visited shacks at the Anjuna beach and Baga beach. We tried sea food and drinks. By the end of the trip I had bonded well with my colleagues across India and with GOA!\n\nIn 2011, I returned with my school friends. This was a fun trip. I drove the scooty for the very first time. Exploring Goa on a scooty is the best thing to do. Every lane has shops which offers scooties on rent. Just make sure you carry your driving license with you. Other than scooties you also get four wheelers on rent. It’s not a great idea to hire taxis (with drivers) as it’s costlier and you are dependent on them. I tried the local curry dish ‘Vindaloo’. It’s quite popular and you can find both veg and non-veg variants.\n\n2014 onwards I visited Goa every year with friends. And with each year I have realized that my bond with Goa has deepened. That year I visited Goa with 20 friends and it was one hell of a trip! We stayed near Candolim beach in North Goa. We visited Fort Aguada (popularized by the movie ‘Dil Chahta Hai’). This Portuguese fort was built in 1612 to guard the city from the Dutch and the Marathas. The fort also has a light house standing tall. Entry is free of cost and you should try to visit it in the morning to avoid the heat during the day.\n\nDuring a few of my visits, I also went to the Saturday night bazaar (flea market) in Arpora. You will find all kinds of things in this night market (it starts at around 6 pm and is open all through the night) from food to clothes to live music. We also went to Curlies which is a popular shack on Anjuna beach. Aviation enthusiasts should definitely visit the Naval aviation museum. Its located quite close to the airport and showcases a collection of vintage and current aircraft. You can also buy some souvenirs for friends and family back home.\n\nBy the end of these trips, I have realized that there is something for everyone in Goa! You can plan a trip to just party in Goa, try club hopping, or you could opt to beach hop, or you could just go there for a relaxing weekend and, take walks in the lanes, eat yummy food and drink to your heart’s content. I am sure nobody has ever come back from Goa without having a good time!\n\nsuddymoody recommendations and facts:\n\nWhen in Goa try fish and pork dishes\n\nDo try the grilled/masala king fish\n\nTrying Port wine is a must\n\nVisit Curlies at Anjuna beach before the sunset. You will get to witness a beautiful view of the sunset on your approach to Curlies\n\nStay in North Goa if it’s your first visit. That’s where all the action is (if action is your thing J)\n\nDon’t drink and drive! Rules have become stricter – but not just because of rules, na?\n\nThe cashews there are not cheap but of good quality. You can take some home for your friends and family\n\nVagator and Arambol beaches are beautiful\n\nShacks on the beaches can charge you more but it’s worth it because of the view\n\nYou can try the Goan pork sausages. You will find it in the bigger departmental stores if you want to carry some home\n\nFor good food you can visit Fisherman’s cove and Fat fish\n\nYou will find many vegetarian restaurants too\n\nGoa airport also serves as military airbase (air station of the Indian Navy)"
