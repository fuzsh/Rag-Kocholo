Three, what are the military options?\n\nAll three will be presented through the âeyesâ of Seventh Fleet by someone who was the Navyâs senior representative on the Commander, U.N.

As an undergraduate student, she majored in Sociology and minored in Family Studies. She obtained an MS in Human Development and Family Studies with an emphasis on parent involvement. Participating in Leadership Denton class of 2007 stimulated an interest in local government, and lit a fire to support and retain locally-owned businesses in Denton.\n\nVolunteering in the community with many organizations helped her better serve the community. She has served three terms on the Denton Public Library Board. Using the relationships sheâs built over the past 21 years in Denton, Anyah hopes to build an experiential learning program through Explorium Denton. Anyah is fueled by her experiences not just with her own children, but the countless others with whom her path has crossed, and the life experiences and interest that have led to this chapter of her life.\n\nAnyah Martinez 2017-09-04 05:00:00Z 0\n\nPaula DÃ¤hne from Germany\n\nDenton Rotary Welcomes Our New Exchange Student, Paula DÃ¤hne, from Germany\n\nPaula had a great time at the Fair and Rodeo.

Not so for us academics. Indeed, it is the bottom of the barrel. In my world there are three values and they are ranked like this: #1 Research; #2 Teaching; #3 Service. And let me tell you that service is a very distant third.\n\nWhen we talk about service we mean things like serving on committees for our department and college. Or we mean serving on editorial boards for journals. Or we mean, ugh, the dreaded stuff of popularizing our ideas for the unwashed masses. All of this is looked down upon, because it is not considered intellectual work. It is not the real deal.\n\nIn this talk, youâll get to know whatâs behind this attitude -- a certain mythology about the way knowledge relates to society. A Zen koan-like puzzle lies at the heart of this myth.\n\nBut more, I believe the academy needs to rethink this mythology. We need to structure our intellectual work as acts of service. For this, Socrates is a good model, inspiring some in our department to start practicing as field philosophers.\n\nAdam Briggle 2017-08-04 05:00:00Z 0\n\nRYLA Kids\n\nRotary Youth Leadership Awards RYLA Participants to Speak to DRC, August 3\n\nRYLA Kids Max Morley 2017-07-28 05:00:00Z 0\n\nJamie Wilson\n\nDISD Superintendent Jamie Wilson, \"Tax Ratification and Growth in Denton ISD,\" August 10\n\nThe Denton ISD Board of School Trustees named Dr. Jamie Wilson superintendent of schools in July 2012. During his 24-year career he has built a reputation through public education advocacy, growth management and instructional innovation. His life-long ties to the Denton community positioned him to become the leader of the school system.\n\nAs a collaborator, Dr. Wilson has forged unprecedented partnerships with local business, universities and organizations. Most recently, the district co-founded Mentor Denton which seeks to place an adult mentor with each of the districts at-risk students, which account for 42 percent of the districtâs 28,000 students.\n\nDr. Wilson joined Denton ISD in 2005 as assistant superintendent for secondary academic programs, where he immediately focused on improving educational programs for the district's growing student population. He is committed to student engagement with a focus on student achievement. During the five years he's served as deputy superintendent, Dr. Wilson has played a major role in managing the district finances, especially in 2011 when the state cut public school funding and the local district's revenue by $11 million.\n\nJamie Wilson 2017-07-27 05:00:00Z 0\n\nAdrian Rodriguez\n\nCongratulations, Adrian Rodriguez, Rotarian Rookie of the Year 2017\n\nAdrian Rodriguez Max Morley 2017-07-22 05:00:00Z 0\n\nJoe Pinson\n\nCongratulations, DRC Honorary Rotarian, Joseph Pinson\n\nJoseph Pinson, MA, MT-BC, retired in 2013 as Assistant Professor of Music Therapy at Texas Womanâs University.

He has been a good son, husband, father, and friend to all of us and he will be dearly missed.\n\nHe will always be remembered and will forever remain in our hearts.”\n\nA native Californian, Bruce Burleson was born to Benjamin and Jonnie Burleson March 7, 1942, In Los Angeles California. He graduated from San Gabriel High School, served with the United States Air Force, where he met the love of his life, Rita Aylesworth Burleson on December 20, 1961. He attended East Los Angeles College, majoring in Criminal Justice. He embarked on his career in law enforcement with the Alhambra Police Department in 1964, and 4 years later transferred to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and was assigned to the Transportation Bureau. In November of 1968, he was transferred to the Patrol Station in East Los Angeles where he worked both Patrol and Detective assignments and received many commendations.\n\nIn 1971, he was assigned to the Antelope Valley, where during his off duty time he was active in the community through his involvement in youth sports, as well as volunteering his time to Quartz Hill High School through the Student and Law program. He was also a volunteer coach of football and wrestling, and touched the lives of many young people through foreign exchange student programs. During the summer of 1984, Bruce was assigned to the Summer Olympics as a convey commander and was responsible for the safe movement of \"at risk\" Olympic participants. In 1985, Bruce volunteered for a test program called Forest Enforcement Detail that was so successful that it was adopted as a regular assignment in patrol stations that have mountain areas. In 1988 he was appointed to the North County Correctional Facility Transition Team as a Project Supervisor for the Vocational Industries Programs, and in August 1991 he received the Sheriff's Exemplary Service Award for his efforts in preparing and initiating the Vocational Industries Program.\n\nIn 1990, Bruce was promoted to the rank of Sergeant and was assigned to Transit Bureau, Antelope Valley station, and Lancaster Station until his retirement in March of 1997, having served for 32 years. Bruce received a degree in Administration of Justice from Antelope Valley College, received Advanced and Supervisory Certificates from the California Peace Officer Standards and Training commission, and taught Advanced Officer Training classes. He also held a life-long California State Teaching credential.\n\nAfter retirement, Bruce and Rita moved to Denton, Texas, where their children and grandchildren had recently relocated. Bruce said, \"We have come home.\" Though their location had changed, Bruce's devotion to serving his community never did. He volunteered his time with the TAG Arts Auction, Greater Denton Arts Council, Denton Rotary Club, Denton County GOP, and the Denton Arts and Jazz Festival. He was a member of The American Legion, the Denton Country Club, and a \"Mean Green\" fan.\n\nBruce is survived by his wife Rita Burleson; daughter Debra Brooks, husband Russ Brooks, children Amanda, Robby, Jesse, and Coleman; son Robert Burleson, wife Carolyn Burleson, children Kelly, Ryan, and Caytlin; adopted son Bruce, wife Marti, children Nicole and Renee.\n\nIn Memoriam Douglas Hay 2014-01-03 00:00:00Z 0\n\nFoundation Dinner was a blast!\n\nWe recently received this picture...

Others are fleeing for their lives into neighboring countries.\n\nFor many Syrian families, this is a grim reality. They live in fear of the next attack. They have no idea what lies ahead. They’re desperate for comfort and safety.\n\nQadria is just one Syrian woman who has lost everything. She fled Damascus when her house was looted and her husband was killed.\n\nToday, she is living at Krwigorsk refugee camp in Iraqi Kurdistan with her daughters.\n\nTogether, we can help Syrian families in desperate need—people just like Qadria.\n\nShelterBox first responded to the Syrian refugee crisis last October, delivering emergency tented shelter and other lifesaving aid to families living at the Domiz refugee camp in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. Shortly thereafter, ShelterBoxes were distributed across refugee camps in Jordan and to internally displaced families that remained within Syria’s borders. Advanced in our response to the Lebanese government’s request for aid, ShelterBox was the first humanitarian aid agency to distribute tents in Lebanon, addressing the need for thermally insulated shelter in the harsh winter weather.\n\nBecause of our generous donors who help us prepare aid in advance of disasters, we were able to respond quickly. For the last several months, we’ve continued to send aid—$1 million of emergency supplies—to the most vulnerable people in the region.\n\nAlmost a year later, we’re back in Iraqi Kurdistan—in response to the influx of Syrian refugees that have been pouring over the border. With the recent reports of chemical weapons attacks and no signs of an end to the conflict, it’s critical that we secure funding now to continue to help these families, as well as those who will be displaced by the next inevitable natural disasters or conflict.\n\nHelp us provide basic necessities to displaced families. Let’s help restore their hope. By supporting ShelterBox, you provide shelter, comfort and a sense of normalcy to those who would otherwise be living in fear.\n\nPlease consider making a gift today.\n\nThank you,\n\nEmily S.

The New York Times reaches nearly 1.87 million print subscribers daily, and its website hosts more than 15.4 million visitors per month.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/health/pakistan-fights-for-ground-in-war-on-polio.html?hp>http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/health/pakistan-fights-for-ground-in-war-on-polio.html?hp\n\nThe article does a wonderful job highlighting Rotary’s leadership role, and in fact the entire final third of the story focuses on the contributions of Pakistani Rotarians, led by National PolioPlus Committee Chair Aziz Memon, who worked extensively with the writer, Donald G. McNeil Jr., during his visit to Pakistan earlier this year to report the story. Rotarians are accurately portrayed as dedicated and courageous “front line” volunteers, despite sometimes facing personal risks. The story also mentions International PolioPlus Committee Chair Dr. Robert Scott’s trip to Pakistan in March.\n\nWhile the article discusses recent setbacks and challenges, the overall tone is cautiously optimistic and the information presented is fair and accurate.\n\nThe print edition of the story includes six photographs, one of which shows Rotary’s End Polio Now logo. The online version links to a photo gallery, which includes an image of a Rotary vaccination team leader and other Rotary visuals.\n\nThis article is the culmination of months of behind-the-scenes work by our Public Relations and PolioPlus staff members and Chair Memon’s in-country team. The absolute key was connecting the writer to Chair Memon, who contributed greatly to the success of this major media opportunity. IPPC Vice-Chair Dr. John L. Sever also provided valuable information to the writer in an interview earlier this year.\n\nThe New York Times article is the latest in a series of major international print and broadcast stories about Rotary and polio in the past 18 months, since we ramped up our media outreach in order to elevate Rotary’s polio eradication profile. Other influential media outlets that have covered Rotary’s polio eradication work include BBC TV, the Economist, Time magazine, and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThis top tier media coverage greatly enhances the work of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative by raising the public awareness and support that are absolutely crucial as we implement the end game strategic plan that is the roadmap to our goal of a polio-free world.\n\nThanks for the Press!!
