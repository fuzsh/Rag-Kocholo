To the immense appreciation of Gilham staff, she has been there ever since!\n\nYvette is commended for being a veteran teacher who cares deeply for her students. She is “relentless in individualizing interventions, connecting with parents and staff, and building positive relationships with families and students.”\n\nA bit of what Yvette’s many nominators wrote:\n\n“Yvette is an exceptionally experienced teacher who absolutely knocks it out of the park with her expertise working with students as well as being a superior team player with staff.”\n\n“We are so fortunate to have Yvette in our Gilham family with her amazing talents and unbelievable ambitiousness to foster behind-the-scenes teaching techniques where her students soar with confidence.”\n\n“We marvel at her quiet disposition, positive enthusiasm and the relationships she builds with her students where they will move mountains to attain the goals she sets for them.”\n\n“Yvette cares immensely about the entire school community at Gilham, and it shows. She is a teacher in the learning center, but also supports general education teachers in finding programs that can help them differentiate instruction for students.”\n\n“She dedicates many hours, in and out of the classroom, to make sure students are served to the fullest extent, educationally, mentally and emotionally.”\n\nHer students added their voices to her nomination. Ms. Landrum, they say, is “kind, loving and sweet,”and “always helps us and gives us snacks.” They say she is “sometimes tough and sometimes funny,” and that “she likes to challenge us and make us think.”\n\nYvette’s bowling name rings true: She IS a “Warrior Queen.” Congratulations!\n\nTEACHER & LICENSED SPECIALIST NOMINEES\n\nMary Adams, Math Teacher, Arts & Technology Academy • Amy Anderson,

top\n\nClassified Staff\n\nCHAMPION: Dulce Guillen, Cultural Navigator, Equity, Inclusion and Instruction Department\n\nDulce Guillen joined Team Eugene in 2017 as the registrar at Arts & Technology Academy and last year—in the height of the pandemic—moved to work with the 4J wraparound team. As a cultural navigator, she provides marginalized and underserved families equal access to resources, advocacy, mentoring, and learning opportunities, while maintaining cultural awareness, respect and dignity.\n\nDulce’s focus is on student success with a special attention to students who might have their needs go unmet, as they experience barriers navigating the school system. She participates as a cultural broker and family advocate on numerous teams, including IEP and 504 teams, school support teams and family meetings.\n\nShe is said to “gently but fiercely advocate for students.”\n\nHer nominators identified her as “the person who gets students to school, makes sure school feels safe and supportive to them, and helps the schools be responsive to students’ needs.”\n\nIn example after example, Dulce is credited with establishing trusting connections with families when a student is in distress, working with the family and school teams to find support services for the student, and helping them get back on track and re-engaged in school.\n\nHer depth of knowledge combined with her communications skills and willingness to roll up her sleeves to find solutions and remove barriers is a positive force in our schools and community.\n\nDulce is truly a champion for 4J students and staff. We are lucky to have her on Team Eugene!\n\nCLASSIFIED STAFF NOMINEES\n\nKelly Ayres, Registrar, Roosevelt Middle School • Melissa Baker, Behavioral Support Assistant, McCornack Elementary School •

Supervisors, Managers & Professionals\n\nCHAMPION: Mike Yocum, Assistant Principal, Roosevelt Middle School\n\nMike Yocum has worked across the globe in education for two decades with a focus on special education. Early in his career he worked in 4J middle schools as a special education teacher and educational assistant. He came back to 4J nearly a decade ago to serve as assistant principal at Roosevelt Middle School, and has been doing solid work there ever since.\n\nHere are a few quotes from Mike’s many nominators:\n\n“I have never met another person so fully devoted to making school a better experience for every student, and specifically for students who are often overlooked or dismissed in our school systems.”\n\n“I have been impressed by, and sometimes a little in awe of, Mike’s ability to find solutions that help students grow and become more connected to their peers and communities. In his commitment to making discipline a learning and growth experience for students, Mike is always looking for ways to turn problems into opportunities. I am a better teacher and advocate for students because of his leadership. ”\n\n“Mike encourages the and, not the but . . . the not yet, not the never, and the yes, we can in face of the no, forget it. I have never worked with someone more asset-based in their thinking than Mike and even when students have given up on themselves, Mike is there with a story, an encouraging word, and a reminder that the adults are there to help and support.”\n\n“Mike doesn’t let up when there is work to be done and students to protect and support. This is his life’s work. He is the embodiment of a champion in education. He is a gem among giants.”\n\nWe’re so pleased that Mike is on our 4J team and are making a world of difference at Roosevelt!\n\nADMINISTRATOR/SUPERVISOR NOMINEES\n\nKerry Delf, Chief of Staff • Lisa Fjordbeck, Executive Assistant to the Superintendent, Superintendent’s Office • Erin Gaston, Principal, Howard Elementary School • AJ Hruby, Principal, Arts & Technology Academy • Mike Ingman, Principal, Sheldon High School • Hillary Johnson, Communications Coordinator, Communications Department • Courtney Leonard, Principal, Roosevelt Middle School • Tom Maloney, Principal, Charlemagne Elementary School • Sheila Minney, Principal, Willagillespie Elementary School • Jim Moore, Principal, Edgewood Elementary School • David Nelson, Senior Systems Administrator, Technology Department • Christine Nesbit, General Counsel, Legal Services • Tris O’Shaughnessy, Executive Assistant to the Assistant Superintendent, Instructional Services Department • Natalie Oliver, Principal, Adams Elementary School • Seth Pfaefflin, Student Services Administrator, Student Services Department • Karen Ramírez Gutierrez, Principal, River Road/El Camino del Río Elementary School • Dawn Strong, Human Resources & COVID Administrator, Education Center • John Wayland, Principal, Kelly Middle School • Mike Yocum, Assistant Principal, Roosevelt Middle School\n\nBack to top\n\nVolunteers\n\nCHAMPION: Bruce Steinmetz, Safe Routes To School, Student Wellness & School Safety Department\n\nNearly every day, Bruce can be found in and around our schools helping 4J students learn the joy and independence that comes with riding a bike.\n\nBruce started volunteering with 4J’s Safe Routes to School program years ago, first helping with the middle school bike safety education program and more recently focusing on the kindergarten and first grade learn-to-ride program. These programs are labor intensive and truly could not function without a volunteer like Bruce.\n\nWith Bruce’s dedication, patience and charm, nearly a thousand 4J kindergarteners and first graders have learned to ride a bike and thousands more middle schoolers have practiced bike safety skills on rides throughout their communities. Thanks to Bruce, kids are experiencing biking as a joyful and empowering activity.\n\nAs an avid cyclist himself and the author of two books on recreation and cycling, Bruce provides a powerful example about how one can live a life of daily adventure and independence through active transportation.\n\nThe consistency that Bruce provides, along with his ability to encourage even the most frustrated and challenged students to keep trying, is critical to the success of 4J’s Safe Routes to School program.\n\nAll in all, Bruce is an incredible asset to the program and we are so grateful to have him with us.

These two staff members have worked the same job, side-by-side for 25 years and are leaving 4J together.\n\nPatti Gehlhaar started working for 4J in 1979 and Linda Willis joined Team Eugene a decade later. Linda and Patti became co-secretaries at Gilham Elementary School in 1997. These two people—jointly and individually—have had a profoundly positive impact on students and staff.\n\nFor 25 years, Patti and Linda have jointly performed the challenging job of school secretary at 4J’s largest elementary school with efficiency, grace, competence, positivity and warmth. In tandem, they have excelled at handling everything this multi-layered and demanding job encompasses while keeping the school smoothly humming along each and every day.\n\nHere’s a portion of what their nominators wrote:\n\n“Patti and Linda are phenomenal at their jobs. They know the ins and outs of Gilham, where everything is and who everyone is, they make sure everyone feels welcome and supported. They do it all with such grace and aplomb.”\n\n“Linda and Patti have been such a blessing to all the students at Gilham over the years, making them feel so special and helping them when they needed it. Students return to Gilham with treats, flowers, and cards to show how much they are appreciated.”\n\n“During Covid, Patti and Linda helped students and parents troubleshoot devices and Seesaw and kept staff working and connected remotely, with their warm, positive, helpful attitude and communication.”\n\n“When I was deployed overseas for the military, Patti and Linda got me a very special book and put little notes throughout the book; they noted staff members’ birthdays and did something special for each holiday that I would be gone. They organized a holiday gift basket to be sent to my family here in the states. I was 8,000 miles away and they still kept me connected, cared for, and supported. That is just how they roll.”\n\n“While we are all happy for them that they get to retire, we are all greatly saddened that we won’t come to work and see their smiling faces every day.”\n\nThanks and congratulations to Linda and Patti on their lifetime of achievement.\n\nBack to top\n\nThank You!\n\nThank you to all those who took time to nominate a deserving 4J staff member to celebrate excellence in education.\n\nThanks to Eugene Education Foundation for supporting our public schools and outstanding educators.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, thank you to all of our 4J staff and volunteers, nominated or not, who work to make a difference in the lives of children every day."
