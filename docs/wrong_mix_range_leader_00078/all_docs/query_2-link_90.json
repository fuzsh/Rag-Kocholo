Here we used positron emission tomography to investigate whether feeding results in hedonia-dependent endogenous opioid release in humans. Ten healthy males were recruited for the study. They were scanned with the μ-opioid-specific ligand [11C]carfentanil three times, as follows: after a palatable meal, a nonpalatable meal, and after an overnight fast. Subjective mood, satiety, and circulating hormone levels were measured. Feeding induced significant endogenous opioid release throughout the brain. This response was more pronounced following a nonpalatable meal versus a palatable meal, and independent of the subjective hedonic responses to feeding. We conclude that feeding consistently triggers cerebral opioid release even in the absence of subjective pleasure associated with feeding, suggesting that metabolic and homeostatic rather than exclusively hedonic responses play a role in the feeding-triggered cerebral opioid release.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The endogenous opioid system supports both hedonic and homeostatic functions. It has been proposed that overeating and concomitant opioid release could downregulate opioid receptors and promote the development of obesity. However, it remains unresolved whether feeding leads to endogenous opioid release in humans. We used in vivo positron emission tomography to test whether feeding triggers cerebral opioid release and whether this response is associated with pleasurable sensations. We scanned volunteers using the μ-opioid receptor-specific radioligand [11C]carfentanil three times, as follows: after an overnight fast, after consuming a palatable meal, and after consuming a nonpalatable meal. Feeding led to significant endogenous opioid release, and this occurred also in the absence of feeding-triggered hedonia. Feeding-triggered opioid release thus also reflects metabolic and homeostatic responses rather than hedonic responses exclusively.",

        "text": "Feeding triggers opioid release independently of hedonia\n\nA prominent hypothesis proposes that the brain opioid system encodes the “liking” component (i.e., the hedonic reaction) of the reward processing (Berridge, 2009; Berridge et al., 2010), and previous PET studies in humans have linked the human endogenous opioid system with variety of mood and hedonic functions (Zubieta et al., 2001; Koepp et al., 2009; Nummenmaa et al., 2016). Consequently, it has been proposed that altered opioidergic functions in conditions involving overeating would reflect alterations in hedonic processing (Burghardt et al., 2015; Karlsson et al., 2015). Our findings on postprandial opioid release accord with the general role of opioids in feeding (Pecina and Smith, 2010) and suggest that repeated feeding-triggered opioid release is a possible mechanism leading to MOR downregulation in obesity. The effects were also consistent across the studied individuals (n = 10). In ventral striatum, feeding-induced opioid release was observed in 10 of 10 subjects in the nonpalatable meal condition and in 7 of 10 subjects in the palatable meal condition; furthermore, the difference between nonpalatable and palatable meals was significant in 7 of 10 subjects. The corresponding effect sizes (Cohen's d) were >1.39, exceeding the conventional limit (0.8) for a large effect (Cohen, 1992).\n\nAgainst our expectations, the present study did not reveal an association between MOR activation and hedonic aspects of feeding. Both palatable and nonpalatable meals induced significant changes in MOR activity, while only palatable meal consumption induced subjective pleasurable sensations. However, we found that the opioid release was stronger following the nonpalatable meal than the palatable meal, despite careful matching of the energy content and nutrients in the meals and no differences in subjective (self-report) and hormonal (plasma insulin, GLP-1, ghrelin, and PYY levels) measures of satiety, as well as using a subjectively preferred palatable meal whose feeding has been found to be modulated by the opioid system in preclinical studies (for a review, see Gosnell and Levine, 2009). No association between endogenous opioid release and self-reported pleasure could be established (although this may also reflect the limited sample size), which accords with some prior studies showing decoupling between endogenous opioid levels and acute mood changes (Guterstam et al., 2013; Mick et al., 2014; Burghardt et al., 2015). Thus, the present evidence suggests that a mere change in the energy homeostasis following feeding is enough to trigger endogenous opioid release in humans. Rewarding aspects of feeding may contribute to the opioid release independently of the homeostatic response, but the present study cannot directly disentangle the relative magnitudes of the two effects.\n\nA possible reason for these discrepancies is that whereas prior preclinical and clinical studies have upregulated or downregulated the MOR system pharmacologically, we instead measured feeding-triggered endogenous opioid release directly in vivo. The observed MOR activation may indeed be influenced by numerous factors other than the hedonic response of feeding (for a review, see Nummenmaa and Tuominen, 2017). One possible explanation for the larger opioid release following the nonpalatable meal is that the nonpalatable liquid meal was digested faster in both the stomach and intestine, thus resulting in faster humoral and neural gastrointestinal responses. Consequently, the faster coupling between plasma nutrients and circulating hormones may cause opioid release in the brain via hypothalamus-mediated mechanisms. Regardless of what mechanism ultimately underlies the eating-dependent endogenous opioid release, these results suggest that repeated stimulation of the MOR system due to overeating can potentially lead to its downregulation, as speculated in prior studies (Karlsson et al., 2015, 2016). However, even though eating itself would not always lead to hedonia-dependent changes in opioid release (e.g., in the case of nonpalatable food consumption), it is possible that the MOR downregulation following repeated overeating can lead to alterations in mood. Accordingly, one prior study (Karlsson et al., 2015) has found that MOR availability was associated with trait anxiety in the morbidly obese subjects, suggesting that the interaction between feeding and mood may be mediated by MOR.\n\nAll in all, our results suggest that the relationship among opioids, feeding, and pleasure may be more complex than previously thought. Even though opioid agonists and antagonists increase and decrease food intake, respectively (Glass et al., 1999; Yeomans and Gray, 2002; Mysels and Sullivan, 2010; Giuliano et al., 2012; Ziauddeen et al., 2013), the effects of μ-opioid agonists in subjective hedonic feelings in drug-naive subjects are much more variable (Lasagna et al., 1955; Tedeschi et al., 1984; Zacny and Gutierrez, 2003, 2009; Riley et al., 2010; Ipser et al., 2013). Together with mixed evidence on endogenous opioid release during positive moods in imaging studies (Boecker et al., 2008; Koepp et al., 2009; Burghardt et al., 2015; Manninen et al., 2017; Nummenmaa and Tuominen, 2017), these data call for a more detailed investigation of the specific contribution of opioids in affective and homeostatic processes in humans.\n\nIt must be noted that rewarding and motivating effects of foods likely also act via other neurotransmitter systems, in particular the dopaminergic system, which interacts intimately with the opioidergic system (Tuominen et al., 2015). In line with this, orally consumed foods trigger significant dopamine release in the striatum (Small et al., 2003), yet similar effects are not observed with intravenously administered glucose (Haltia et al., 2007, 2008). Consequently, the actual process of consuming the food (rather than the concomitant changes in blood glucose levels) might also be critical for the activity changes in the reward system. It is thus possible that the dopamine system is critical for the rewarding aspects of feeding, whereas the opioid release observed in the present study would be triggered by more general-level homeostatic signaling (Nogueiras et al., 2012)."
