Since the acknowledgement of Helicobacter pylori as a causative agent of gastric cancer in 1994 (2), it has become more and more apparent that it is important to understand the role and the long-term effects of bacteria in order to develop better tools for cancer prevention.\n\nThe presence of several oral pathogens has been evident in oral and gastrointestinal tract cancers. The dysbiotic periodontal pathobiont Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) has occurred in abundance in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) (3), and further, Pg has been associated with an increased risk of mortality from orodigestive cancer (4), and with an increased incidence of pancreatic cancer (5). In esophageal cancer tissue, the oral pathogens Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus anginosus, and Treponema denticola (Td) are frequent (6), and in our earlier studies, Td has appeared in oropharyngeal, oral- and gastrointestinal tumor samples (7, 8). In colorectal cancer, Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) has been present and evidence shows that it promotes colorectal carcinogenesis (9). Oral carcinogenesis has been promoted by Fn and Pg in in vitro and in vivo studies via their interaction with oral epithelial cells through toll-like receptors (TLR) (10). Pg is an invasive opportunistic pathobiont belonging to a red complex group of oral pathogens identifiable in severe forms of periodontitis (11). In addition to its association with gastrointestinal cancers, Pg has been associated with various systemic diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (12) and Alzheimer’s disease (13). The tumorigenic properties of Pg include induction of inflammation (14), activation of cell proliferation (15), inhibition of apoptosis (16), enhancement of cell invasion (17), epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) (18) and immune suppression (19). One of its key virulence factors, arginine-specific cysteine proteinase R gingipain (Rgp), has several functions: it can degrade host structural elements and thus contribute to Pg penetration into epithelium and to induction of cell apoptosis (20), as well as participate in altering host defenses by manipulating inflammatory responses (21). Pg activates host responses, leading to increased pro-matrix metalloproteinase 9 (proMMP-9) and proMMP-8 expression and activation (17, 22, 23), while gingipains activate proMMP-9 and proMMP-8 to their active form, thus enhancing extracellular matrix destruction and cell penetration (17, 24).\n\nMatrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) derived from host cells are capable of degrading almost all components of extracellular matrix and basement membranes. MMPs are essential in many physiological processes requiring tissue remodeling such as angiogenesis, bone development, wound healing and uterine and mammary involution (25). They also play a critical role in inflammatory and immunological processes; upregulation of MMPs can occur in cancer, in vascular diseases, and in many types of inflammatory and immunological processes (26-29). Proteolytic degradation of ECM components by MMPs clearly facilitates carcinoma cell invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, MMPs play important roles in non-matrix bioactive chemokine- and growth-factor processes, and in the modulation of activities of other proteases in cascades (30-32). Interestingly, MMP-9 and MMP-8 have shown tumor-suppressive and defensive effects in breast, skin, and colitis-associated cancer, as well as epithelial-myoepithelial salivary gland and tongue cancer (33-36). With this background, we may assume that oral pathogens and MMPs may play a role in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Our aim was to determine the prevalence of R gingipain (Rgp), a key virulence factor of the oral pathogen Pg, and the prevalence of MMP-8 and 9 expression in 202 unselected consecutive OPSCC patients. We further aimed to discover their relationship to our earlier findings regarding HPV status, chymotrypsin-like proteinase of Td (Td-CTLP) immunoexpression, clinical parameters, and patient outcome.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn short, Rgp was present in both HPV-positive and HPV-negative OPSCC. A positive correlation existed between tumoral Rgp and tumoral MMP-9 in HPV-negative OPSCC, but not in HPV-positive OPSCC. Tumoral MMP-9 may be related to poor DSS in OPSCC, especially among patients with HPV-negative disease, whereas Rgp in inflammatory cells improved DSS in these same groups. The role of Rgp in immunological responses, in carcinogenesis, and in clinical outcome requires further investigation both in HPV-negative and HPV-positive OPSCC.\n\nFootnotes"
