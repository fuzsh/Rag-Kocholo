        "text": "Government of Finland (1924-1925)\n\nLauri Ingman's second cabinet was the 11th Government of independent Finland, serving between 31 May 1924 – 31 March 1925. It was formed following the 1924 parliamentary elections between four parties—National Coalition Party, Agrarian Party, National Progressive Party and Swedish People's Party—and had a majority in the parliament during the first six months. Overall, the cabinet lasted 305 days in office.[1]\n\nThe cabinet lost its parliamentary majority after the Agrarian Party withdrew following a disagreement on the pension of government officials. The Ingman cabinet finally resigned four months due to defeat of an election bill in the parliament.[2]\n\nAssembly Minister Period of office Party Prime Minister\n\nLauri Ingman 31 May 1924 – 31 March 1925 National Coalition Party Minister for Foreign Affairs\n\nHjalmar Procopé 31 May 1924 – 31 March 1925 Swedish People's Party Minister of Justice\n\nAlbert von Hellens January 18, 1924 – May 31, 1924 National Progressive Party Minister of Defence\n\nLauri Malmberg 31 May 1924 – 31 March 1925 Independent Minister of the Interior\n\nGunnar Sahlstein 31 May 1924 – 31 March 1925 National Coalition Party Minister of Finance\n\nYrjö Pulkkinen January 18, 1924 – May 31, 1924 National Coalition Party Minister of Education\n\nLauri Ingman 31 May 1924 – 31 March 1925 National Coalition Party Deputy Minister of Education\n\nAntti Kukkonen\n\nOskari Mantere 31 May 1924 – 22 November 1924\n\n22 November 1924 – 31 March 1925 Agrarian League\n\nNational Progressive Party Minister of Agriculture\n\nJalo Lahdensuo\n\nIlmari Auer 1 May 1924 – 22 November 1924\n\n22 November 1924 – 31 March 1925 National Progressive Party\n\nAgrarian League Deputy Minister of Agriculture\n\nIlmari Auer\n\nPekka Pennanen May 31, 1924 – November 22, 1924\n\nNovember 22, 1924 – March 31, 1925 National Progressive Party\n\nNational Coalition Party Minister of Transport and Public Works\n\nEero Hahl\n\nRolf Witting 31 May 1924 – 22 November 1924\n\n22 November 1924 – 31 March 1925 Agrarian League\n\nSwedish People's Party Minister of Trade and Industry\n\nAxel Palmgren 31 May 1924 – 31 March 1925 Swedish People's Party Minister of Social Affairs\n\nNiilo Liakka\n\nLauri Pohjala 31 May 1924 – 22 November 1924\n\n22 November 1924 – 31 March 1925 Agrarian League\n\nNational Coalition Party"
