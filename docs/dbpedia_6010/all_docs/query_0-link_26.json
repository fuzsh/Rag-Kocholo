        "text": "There's an interesting scenario in regards to Timur from A Study of History (last paragraph):\n\nArnold J. Toynbee said:\n\nTimur's self-stultification is a supreme example of the suicidalness of militarism. His empire not only did not survive him but was devoid of all after-effects of a positive kind. Its only traceable after-effect is wholly negative. In sweeping away everything that it found in its path, in order to rush headlong into its own destruction, Timur's imperialism simply created a political and social vacuum in Southwestern Asia; and this vacuum eventually drew the Ottomans and Safavids into a collision which dealt the stricken Iranic society its death blow.\n\nThe Iranic society's forfeiture of the heritage of the nomad world declared itself first on the plane of religion. Throughout the four centuries ending in Timur's generation Islam had been progressively establishing its hold over the sedentary peoples round the coasts of the Eurasian Steppe and had been captivating the nomads themselves whenever they trespassed out of the desert into the sown. By the fourteenth century it looked as though nothing could now prevent Islam from becoming the religion of all Eurasia. But after Timur's career had run its course the progress of Islam in Eurasian came to a dead stop, and two centuries later the Mongols and the Kalmyks were converted to the Lamaistic form of Mahayana Buddhism. This astonishing triumph of the fossilized relic of the religious life of the long-extinct Indic civilization gives some measure of the extent to which the prestige of Islam had fallen in the estimation of the Eurasian nomads during the two centuries that had elapsed since Timur's day.\n\nOn the political plane the Iranic culture which Timur had first championed and then betrayed proved equally bankrupt. The sedentary societies which ultimately performed the feat of taming Eurasian nomadism politically were the Russians and the Chinese. This final conclusion of the monotously repeated drama of nomad history became predictable when, in the middle of the seventeenth century of the Christian Era, the Cossack servants of the Muscovy and the Manchu masters of China ran into each other as they were feeling their way in opposite directions round the northern edge of the steppe and fought their first battle for domination of Eurasia in the neighbourhood of Genghis Khan's ancestral pastures in the upper basin of the Amur. The partition of Eurasia between these rivals was completed a century later.\n\nIt is a curious reflection that, if Timur had not turned his back on Eurasia and his arms against Iran in AD 1381, the present relations between Transoxiana and Russia might have been the inverse of what they actually are. In those hypothetical circumstances Russia today might have found themselves in an empire of much of the same extent as the area of the present Soviet Union but with quite a different centre of gravity - an Iranic empire in which Samarkand would be ruling Moscow instead of Moscow ruling Samarkand.\n\nI love the idea of Timur being the ancestor of a united Central Asia - especially a dominant one, but I worry about the land-locked nature of it. I think that it might have to invade to get ports on the Indian Ocean and Black Seas - not insurmountable goals all in all. Invading the Caucauses early rather than Iran would work, or invading Pakistan. I'd personally lean towards the former - not because the ports are better, but simply because they'd be easier to control than territory the other side of the Hindu Kush.\n\nI have this amazing image in my head of the Timurids throwing their weight around - not just to dominate the steppe and the Russias - but forcing the Russias and other settled neighbours to pay tribute in food and labour - and use that to build an early form of the Eurasia Canal - using brute force to overcome the differences in land level. That would allow Samarkand to have a trade port on the Caspian that could legitimately trade in the Black Sea. - It'd easily be called one of the Wonders of the World.\n\nAlternatively (and far less awesome), is that Samarkand would be reliant on the Crimea economically, and also at the mercy of the Ottomans for the same reasons as Russia - the Bosporus. I wonder whether a Timur would prop up the Romans as a satellite state, just like the Muscovites.\n\nOh, that is a vision - Timur conquers Central Asia - supports the Romans and Russians - the Russians dominate the Baltic, and the Romans retake the Balkans and Anatolia (with a Timurid Garrison on the Bosporus), and the Timurid Dynasty converts to Orthodoxy/Nestorianism. All things considered, it could possibly turn Poland into its westernmost pasture/satellite. That could be a fun empire, even if it would be horrendously vulnerable to the rising dominance of Thallasocracies. Given time, and a strong Roman Satellite - it could even make Iran a satellite in a more sustainable way - with the Romans invading via the Caucauses and Mesopotamia, and the Timurids proper from Central Asia - Giving the Central Asian Timurid Empire buffers on every side bar China, dominance of N.Asia, and ports on the Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, and White Seas. The key would be if they could adapt to new technologies, but if they could form a beneficial relationship with their satellites, they could let the satellites face most of the brunt of the rise in gunpowder infantry, whilst the Timurids develop gunpowder cavalry to support their own satellites gunpowder infantry.\n\nEventually it'd fragment along various lines - but if Central Asia has become strong enough, overcoming some of its natural issues through land management - it could rebuild in a manner like the Russian Federation.\n\nThat made way more sense before a Muslim steppe dynasty suddenly became Orthodox, Rogue Trader. That's like proposing a scenario where the Portugese turn Hindu after establishing a trading port in India. If someone considered it they'd be killed by their own court.\n\nThe reason that so many Central Asian peoples were drawn to India is that it's absurdly rich. Without a strong Indian state, Central Asian powers will always look to cross the Hindu Kush, because of the wealth and prosperity of the region. By comparison, Caucasia is poor and rugged and difficult to conquer - like another Afghanistan but far away and more religiously divided.\n\nA Timurid Turko-Iranian state has its own rich culture and long history to look back on. It doesn't need to assimilate into some alternative cultural paradigm. A unified Turkestan would be a formidable steppe state, and although the transition to modernity would be hard on them, I don't think it would be impossible - although the end product is unlikely to resemble the old \"Timurid\" state.\n\nTo be frank though, a surviving Turko-Iranian state would probably be best off under a figure quite unlike OTL Timur - a more methodical and more unifying figure, and one with more foresight. A Timur type leader who expands more cautiously and focuses more on a sort of reborn Khwarzem type state at first would be ideal for longevity.\n\nOnce the state stays intact for a few centuries without falling apart like so many great steppe empires did, then we can talk about modernization and dreams of canals and global trade. First steps first - make a state stable enough to out last it's conqueror.\n\nThat made way more sense before a Muslim steppe dynasty suddenly became Orthodox, Rogue Trader.

First steps first - make a state stable enough to out last it's conqueror.\n\nI'll admit I went off on one there. However, the Steppe Empires were fond of adopting new religions when it suited them. Timur might (admittedly) be a bit late for that, so I'll acknowledge that it probably wouldn't happen.\n\nIt did also go off on the whole \"long term survival\" thing, assuming Timur/alt-Timur. At the very least Central Asia needs unifying, Persia needs to be cowed, and then the Crimea and European Steppe under control - otherwise Russia will likely move in, and that is a big problem.\n\nThe rest was me on a bit of a high. *shameface*. This is Timur after all, can't have an alt-Timur that is a bit dull. Perhaps then he does all the Steppe Unifying and then invading Russia as a Ghazi - and later use control over the Steppe to invade Serbia to continue that idea, before using the Romans as a proxy to control the area, much as they'd use Moscovy in the North. Which might work - the Romans wouldn't bow to a Caliph (which Timur can't be), but they did to the Ottomans - but in this circumstance Timur ends a civil war and restores Serbian territory to Constantinople.\n\nAs for inheritance - Timur could do worse than to mimic the Roman system of a Kaisar, or appointed heir, that leads as he gets old - the problem was that Timur had too many powerful successors. Alternatively, he could encourage his sons to intrigue against one another to ensure only one heir. Fundamentally Timur didn't have one obvious heir.\n\nA slightly bizarre option to prevent powerful rivals is to have the empire governed by groups that nobody would rally behind. Iranians in Russia, Russians in Constantinople, Romans on the Southern Border - all reporting to an appointed heir. That could partially neuter any succession crisis by preventing any one candidate gathering loads of support - mainly because the people would rather break away, the governors want to stay in power, and the army relies on the governors to organise the peoples labour to supply them. Timurs heirs and other Turko-Mongols should become wealthy, but very rarely rule.\n\nThat made way more sense before a Muslim steppe dynasty suddenly became Orthodox, Rogue Trader.
