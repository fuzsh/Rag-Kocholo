        "text": "The most important decisions concerning the dynasty were resolved by congresses (khurultais) that served as an \"an organ maintaining the state\" in which the descendants of Chinggis Khan, as members of the ruling dynasty, played a decisive role. It was at such khurultais that the election of a new khan was officially proclaimed.\n\nDuring the 14th century, those Chinggisids living in western part of the Mongolian possessions in Eurasia had largely accepted Islam as their dominant religion. But at the same time \"they considered the rights inherited from Chinggis Khan traditionally to be of more importance\" because it was descent from \"the Great Conqueror of a World\" (and not religion) that in the eyes of their subjects legitimized their monopoly of the imperial throne. However, over time substantial real power to rule fell into the hands of their non-Chinggisid governors. These governors, who could not claim direct patrilineal descendant of Chinggis Khan on a man's line, often tried to elevate their social status by marrying Chinggisid princesses to gain the right to the title of \"son-in-law\" (güregen) to the khan’s family.\n\nThe most famous example of this was Central Asian conquer Timur who in the beginning of his reign employed only the title of emir (leader). After the marrying a Chinggisid princesses he became a güregen and wielded immense power in the name of powerless puppet Chinggisid khans."
