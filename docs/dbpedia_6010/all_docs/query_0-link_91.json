        "text": "Lay of the Land:\n\nIt was the last quarter of 15th century A.D, central Asia, once the power house of Turk Timurid dynasty under the rule of Timur Gurkani was shattered into petty kingdoms. They were all ruled by descendants of Timur under the nominal authority of Timurid Sultan in Samarkand. Uzbeks who claimed to be descendants from Mongols were becoming stronger in the North, Qoyunlu Turks who were once under the suzerainty of Timurids now had established their own Sultanate in the regions of Persia, Iraq and Armenia. To their west were the mighty Ottoman Turks who had just recently taken Istanbul from Byzantine Empire in 1453 and were on the rise unstoppably advancing into the lands of Eastern Europe. Further down to south of Ottomans were the Mameluke Turks of Egypt who were about to start their trade conflict with Portuguese in Arabian Ocean and this would eventually signal their downfall and destruction at the hands of Ottomans. It was the time when in Islamic world Turk nations were on the rise and days of once mighty Abbasid and other Arab dynasties were over.\n\nNow coming to the Indian subcontinent down in the South and South-East it was divided into petty kingdoms of different Rajput and Muslim clans and dominated by Muslim kingdoms in the North and North-West. Notably amongst them was the Delhi Sultanate of Afghan Lodi dynasty which would later be put to an end in 1526 by a tiger from central Asia “Zahir ud Deen Muhammad Babur”.\n\nCritical Juncture:\n\nBabur was born in 1483 to Umar Sheikh Mirza the ruler of Fergana valley currently located in eastern Uzbekistan. He was eleven when his father died by falling off the edge of the rooftop while examining his pigeons, or God knows if someone pushed him from the top. History is shrouded in mystery here.\n\nAs was the norm of that time, his uncles and cousins rose against him and started scheming to take his inherited dominions for themselves out of pure greed for more power. Whereas Babur, on the other hand, dreamt of restoring the lost splendor and prestige of once mighty Timurid Empire with Samarkand as its capital. He made two attempts sieging this city but eventually lost it every time to his rivals.\n\nBabur decided that if he were to build his own legacy, that wasn’t possible while sitting among his enemies who were a constant threat. He acknowledged that it was time to look towards East in Indian Punjab which was once part of Timurid Empire and used this historical fact to declare his claim on Punjab which was at that time governed by Daulat Khan Lodi. Interestingly, Daulat Khan and aristocracy of Punjab was not pleased with their Sultan Ibrahim Lodi due to his absolutist policies and considered him a tyrant. They wrote to Babur that if he attacks Punjab, they will support him and further pledged his loyalty to him.\n\nBut before this, Babur had already made Kabul as his new base which was much more protected and stable. He took Kabul in 1504 from Arghunid Dynasty and spent nearly 10 years solidifying his rule and establishing new diplomatic relations especially with Safvid Empire of Iran and Ottoman Turks. He thought of making one last attempt to take Samarkand. So in 1513 he tried again and captured Samarkand and Bukhara both but after gaining control for a few months, he finally lost it to his diehard Mongol enemy Muhammad Shaybani Khan who was a descendant from the lineage of the eldest son of Chengiz Khan. This was the critical juncture which later paved the way for the foundation of the Mughal Empire thus obliging Babur to consider that Northern India was his only remaining option now.\n\nRiver turns East:\n\nIt was 1519 when Babur crossed into India, took Bhira Fort on the bank of Jhelum River and reached Chenab River (now in Pakistan), here Daulat Khan sent his son to Babur and other notables from amongst aristocracy who paid obeisance to Babur. After appointing officials and collectors, Babur left. At this point Babur was only thinking of consolidating Punjab till Lahore.\n\nThings were going fine till now, but Sultan Ibrahim Lodi could not allow Punjab to slip out of his hands so he sent forces in 1524 ousting those who were loyal to Babur from Punjab. Turning of events in such a dramatic manner and wavering loyalty of Daulat Khan who was constantly switching sides between Babur and Ibrahim, forced Babur to march again into Punjab in 1525 from Peshawar. This time Babur’s army was accompanied by siege artillery and matchlocks. Here, Ottoman Turks played a major role in the occupation of India by Mughals as they provided Babur with military engineers like Mustafa Rumi and Ali Qulli Khan who equipped Mughal army with modern technology of artilleries not known to Indians. In fact the Lodi’s army that came to counter Babur’s was superior in number but lacked modern technology and was a late medieval style army. Babur was highly outnumbered when two armies met at the battlefield of Panipat on 20th April 1526, but technology and advanced military strategy of Babur played a decisive role in the outcome. Mughals defeated Lodi army routing their elephants back on them and eventually Sultan Ibrahim Lodi was also killed in the course of events. Babur entered Delhi victoriously and sent his son Humayun forward to take Agra fort so that his rule on Northern India was solidified.\n\nIt was not the end of all, one more major battle was fought in 1527; the battle of Khanwa where Babur defeated a major alliance of remaining Afghan leadership from Lodi’s court and Rajput which formed against him. It was led by Rana Sanga of Mewar. Babur was outnumbered and again technology and superior strategy made him victorious.\n\nA personal touch:\n\nI would not be doing justice if I don’t mention anything personal of Babur, recently I had a chance to read English translation of his personal diary ‘Babur Nama’ and it really touched me how a man who in pursuit of power could be so conscious simultaneously. We can see that how respectful he was towards women of his household and other relatives, especially towards his companions who stood with him in the time of his exile before he took Kabul. He had an acute sense of observation and curiosity, especially when it comes to nature, where we can see him doing experimentation with plants, in fact you will be amazed to know that he planted grapes and melons from central Asia into India. While describing one of the towns of his domain “Marghinan” he categorically mentioned its best pomegranates and apricots in his diary. Babur was so well versed in Turkic and Persian poetry and commentary that his original work in Turkic language is still considered a source of fine Turkic literature, thanks to his mother and grandmother for inculcating good manners and etiquettes of eloquence in him.\n\nWhile in Delhi Babur was under stress because some of his companions insisted on leaving India and going back to Afghanistan because of India’s harsh climate and other environmental differences. Moreover, there were some political and social upheavals he was facing from people in his entourage. This was expected to happen as a new race was entering and trying to establish itself amongst an alien race. One of Babur’s close companion Khawaja Kalan had no heart to stay in India, and he was insisting on leaving so the matter was settled in such a way that he will return to Kabul and Ghazni and manage affairs there. While he was leaving he wrote the following verse on the wall of his Dehli’s residence which reflects the feeling of some of those who came to India.\n\nIf safe and sound I cross Sind...\n\nBlacken my face before I wish for Hind...\n\nBabur however granted him some land in Punjab and also dispatched along with him many gifts for his blood relatives and those close to him and called upon his family to join him in India.\n\nAs the affairs got settled, Babur’s wife and consort Maham called upon their son Humayun from Badakhshan, as he arrived, everybody in the royal house cheered up and Babur granted him his fief* in Sambhal. Babur has had a very tough lifestyle since the times of his struggle in Fergana to his deprival from Samarkand and later during his stay in Afghanistan where his mother passed away. He gained stress over time which was one of the multiple things affecting his health. A strange incident happened here that Humayun on his arrival got extremely sick and this made Babur so worried that he prayed to God for exchange of his life in return for Humayun’s. A saint told Babur to circumambulate Humayun three times while he be on his rest bed and keep praying to God for his son’s health, surprisingly it happened that Babur eventually got sick while Humayun was recovering. Babur passed away in 1530 AD and Humayun ascended to the Mughal throne. Unlike his father, he didn’t turn out to be a good administrator but like him he did have a kind heart, often forgiving those who caused him harm.\n\nWe have read about the rise and fall of so many historic personalities. To me the most special and outstanding thing about Babur is that he was a self-made man rising from nothing to be a man of high prestige. He won and lost, he was accepted and rejected, but he continued with the dream of his remembering where he belongs and what his destiny is just like a bright star who forms out of cosmic dust, going through phases of intense nuclear reactions, boiling to millions of Celsius, hard cooked and eventually becoming stable to give light for life which is to flourish around it."
