Timur sits in a jewelled throne beneath a canopy at the centre, handing the Timurid crown to Babur on his right, watched by Babur's son and successor Humayun on his left, both of whom have similarly opulent thrones. Their respective chief ministers stand before them. All are identified by minute inscriptions in Persian.\n\nDimensions\n\nPainting only height: 29.5cm\n\nPainting only width: 20.4cm\n\nPage height: 38.5cm\n\nPage width: 26.1cm\n\nHalf Imperial Mount (Portrait)StyleMarks and inscriptions\n\n([1] Persian inscription in black ink, in the border beneath the painting )\n\nTranslation\n\n[1] 'Work of Govardhan' [2 The carmine inscriptions near the heads of the rulers identify them:] [a] likeness of His Highness Babur padshah [b] likeness of His Highness the Lord of the (Second) Conjunction (ie Timur) [c] likeness of His Highness Humayun padshah [3 gold inscriptions identify their Chief Ministers.

He hands the imperial crown to the founder of the Mughal dynasty, Babur (r.1526â1530), who is seated to his right. On his left is Baburâs son Humayun, the second Mughal emperor (r.1530â1540 and 1544â1545), who briefly lost the throne and was forced into exile in Iran. All are seated on jewelled thrones beneath parasols, an emblem of royalty. Before them stand their chief ministers, all identified in minuscule Persian inscriptions: on the right is Bayram Khan, with Mirza Shah Rukh and Mirza Rustam in the middle and on the left respectively.\n\nAn attribution in black ink on the lower border notes that the painting was done by Govardhan, an artist of the imperial Mughal workshop during the reigns of Jahangir (r. 1605-1627) and Shah Jahan (r. 1628-1658). It was probably done to mark Shah Jahan's accession. It came from a group of paintings now divided between the V&A and the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin, popularly known as the âMinto Albumâ from its association with a former owner, Lord Minto. A companion painting from the same album now in the Chester Beatty Library depicts Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan, the immediate successors of Babur and Humayun, similarly enthroned.\n\nBibliographic references\n\nSwallow, Deborah and John Guy eds.
