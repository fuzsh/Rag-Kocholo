        "text": "Amir Timur (1336 – 1405)\n\nChristopher Marlowe’s play Tamburlaine the Great recounts the brutal rise to power and demise of the 14th century emperor and conqueror, Amir Timur. Take a look at some of the facts about this fascinating historical figure below.\n\nBackground & Early Years\n\nTimur comes from the Turkish word meaning ‘iron’. His Persian nickname, Timur-e Lang, translates to ‘Timur the Lame’, resulting in the European derivations Tamerlane and Tamburlaine.\n\nTimur was born in 1336 near the city of Kesh (now Shakhrisabz, Uzbekistan). He began as a sheep-rustler and bandit.\n\nTimur was injured in a skirmish which left him lame in his right leg and unable to raise his right arm. In 1941 his tomb was excavated, with archaeologists finding evidence of two healed wounds on Timur’s right leg and missing fingers on his right arm, confirming his injuries.\n\nMilitary Leader & Rise to Power\n\nTimur gained prominence as a military leader under the ruler Kurgan – he led a thousand soldiers in the invasion of Khorasan (north-east Iran). When Kurgan later died, Timur was given command of the tribe.\n\nTimur spent the next three decades legitimising his rule (including murdering his brother-in-law Amir Husayn, and claiming the Chagatai princess, Saray Mulk Khanum, as his bride), and gaining territory.\n\nConqueror of Asia\n\nHis military campaigns saw him conquer lands that comprise of modern-day countries Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and parts of Turkey, Syria and India.\n\nHistorians argue Timur was descended from Genghis Khan on his mother’s side. He therefore ruled over his conquered lands as an Amir (from the Arabic word for ‘Prince’), rather than as Khan (the name given to male rulers descended from Genghis Khan through the male line).\n\nFall of a Prince\n\nHowever, Timur’s desire for power and control stretched too far – in the winter of 1404, Timur set out to invade China and conquer the Ming dynasty. The severe weather hampered his campaign and he fell ill. He died in February 1405.\n\nAt its full height, Timur’s empire stretched from Russia to India, and from the Mediterranean Sea to Mongolia."
