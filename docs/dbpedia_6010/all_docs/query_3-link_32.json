        "text": "Deutsch - Erstes Kapitel: Tschingis Chaans Vorfahren und seine Kindheit\n\nEnglish - First Chapter: Genghis Khan's Ancestors and his childhood\n\ninfo:\n\nTimurid dynasty\n\nThe Timurids (Persian: ØªÛÙ ÙØ±ÛØ§Ù), self-designated GurkÄnÄ« (Persian: Ú¯ÙØ±ÙØ§ÙÙ), were a Persianate Central Asian Sunni Muslim dynasty of originally Turko-Mongol descent whose empire included the whole of Central Asia, Iran, modern Afghanistan, as well as large parts of Pakistan, India, Mesopotamia and Caucasus. It was founded by the legendary conqueror Timur (Tamerlane) in the 14th century.\n\nIn the 16th century, Timurid prince Babur, the ruler of Ferghana, invaded India and founded the Mughal Empire, which ruled most of the Indian subcontinent until its decline after Aurangzeb in the early 18th century, and was formally dissolved by the British Raj after the Indian rebellion of 1857.\n\nOrigins\n\nThe origin of the Timurid dynasty goes back to the Mongolian nomadic confederation known as Barlas, who were remnants of the original Mongol army of Genghis Khan. After the Mongol conquest of Central Asia, the Barlas settled in Turkistan (which then became also known as Moghulistan - \"Land of Mongols\") and intermingled to a considerable degree with the local Turkic and Turkic-speaking population, so that at the time of Timur's reign the Barlas had become thoroughly Turkicized in terms of language and habits. Additionally, by adopting Islam, the Central Asian Turks and Mongols also adopted the Persian literary and high culture which had dominated Central Asia since the early days of Islamic influence. Persian literature was instrumental in the assimilation of the Timurid elite to the Perso-Islamic courtly culture.\n\nFounding the dynasty\n\nTimur conquered large parts of Transoxiana (in modern day Central Asia) and Khorasan (parts of modern day Iran, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan) from 1363 onwards with various alliances (Samarkand in 1366, and Balkh in 1369), and was recognized as ruler over them in 1370. Acting officially in the name of the Mongolian Chagatai ulus, he subjugated Transoxania and Khwarazm in the years that followed and began a campaign westwards in 1380. By 1389 he had removed the Kartids from Herat and advanced into mainland Persia from 1382 (capture of Isfahan in 1387, removal of the Muzaffarids from Shiraz in 1393, and expulsion of the Jalayirids from Baghdad). In 1394/95 he triumphed over the Golden Horde and enforced his sovereignty in the Caucasus, in 1398 subjugated Multan and Dipalpur in modern day Pakistan and in modern day India left Delhi in such ruin that it is said for two months \"not a bird moved wing in the city\". In 1400/01 conquered Aleppo, Damascus and eastern Anatolia, in 1401 destroyed Baghdad and in 1402 triumphed over the Ottomans at Ankara. In addition, he transformed Samarqand into the Center of the World. An estimated 17 million people may have died from his conquests.\n\nAfter the end of the Timurid Empire in 1506, the Mughal Empire was later established in India by Babur in 1526, who was a descendant of Timur through his father and possibly a descendant of Genghis Khan through his mother. The dynasty he established is commonly known as the Mughal Dynasty. By the 17th century, the Mughal Empire ruled most of India, but later declined during the 18th century. The Timurid Dynasty came to an end in 1857 after the Mughal Empire was dissolved by the British Empire and Bahadur Shah II was exiled to Burma.\n\nDue to the fact that the Persian cities were desolated by previous wars, the seat of Persian culture was now in Samarkand and Herat. These cities became the center of the Timurid renaissance.\n\nCulture\n\nAlthough the Timurids hailed from the Barlas tribe which was of Turkicized Mongol origin, they had embraced Persian culture, converted to Islam and resided in Turkestan and Khorasan. Thus, the Timurid era had a dual character, which reflected both the Turco-Mongol origins and the Persian literary, artistic, and courtly high culture of the dynasty.\n\nLanguage\n\nDuring the Timurid era, Central Asian society was bifurcated and had divided the responsibilities of government and rule into military and civilian along ethnic lines. At least in the early stages, the military was almost exclusively Turko-Mongolian, and the civilian and administrative element was almost exclusively Persian. The spoken language shared by all the Turko-Mongolians throughout the area was Chaghatay Turkic. The political organization hearkened back to the steppe-nomadic system of patronage introduced by Genghis Khan. The major language of the period, however, was Persian, the native language of the TÄjÄ«k (Persian) component of society and the language of learning acquired by all literate and/or urban people. Already Timur was steeped in Persian culture and in most of the territories which he incorporated, Persian was the primary language of administration and literary culture. Thus the language of the settled \"diwan\" was Persian, and its scribes had to be thoroughly adept in Persian culture, whatever their ethnic origin. Persian became the official state language of the Timurid Empire and served as the language of administration, history, belles lettres, and poetry. The Chaghatay language was the native and \"home language\" of the Timurid family while Arabic served as the language par excellence of science, philosophy, theology and the religious sciences.\n\nLiterature\n\nTimurid literature in Persian\n\nPersian literature, especially Persian poetry occupied a central place in the process of assimilation of the Timurid elite to the Perso-Islamic courtly culture. The Timurid sultans, especially Å Ährukh MÄ«rzÄ and his son Mohammad Taragai OloÄ Beg, patronized Persian culture. Among the most important literary works of the Timurid era is the Persian biography of Timur, known as \"ZafarnÄmeh\" (Persian: Ø¸ÙØ±ÙØ§Ù Ù), written by Sharaf ud-DÄ«n AlÄ« YazdÄ«, which itself is based on an older \"ZafarnÄmeh\" by NizÄm al-DÄ«n ShÄmÄ«, the official biographer of Timur during his lifetime. The most famous poet of the Timurid era was NÅ«r ud-DÄ«n JÄmÄ«, the last great medieval Sufi mystic of Persia and one of the greatest in Persian poetry. In addition, some of the of the astronomical works of the Timurid sultan Ulugh Beg were written in Persian, although the bulk of it was published in Arabic. The Timurid ruler BaysunÄur also commissioned a new edition of the Persian national epic ShÄhnÄmeh, known as ShÄhnÄmeh of BaysunÄur, and wrote an introduction to it. According to T. Lenz.\n\n\"It can be viewed as a specific reaction in the wake of Timur's death in 807/1405 to the new cultural demands facing Shahhrokh and his sons, a Turkic military elite no longer deriving their power and influence solely from a charis matic steppe leader with a carefully cultivated linkage to Mongol aristocracy. Now centered in Khorasan, the ruling house regarded the increased assimilation and patronage of Persian culture as an integral component of efforts to secure the legitimacy and authority of the dynasty within the context of the Islamic Iranian monarchical tradition, and the Baysanghur Shahnameh, as much a precious object as it is a manuscript to be read, powerfully symbolizes the Timurid conception of their own place in that tradition. A valuable documen tary source for Timurid decorative arts that have all but disappeared for the period, the manuscript still awaits a comprehensive monographic study.\"\n\nTimurid literature in Chagatay\n\nThe Timurids also played a very important role in the history of Turkic literature. Based on the established Persian literary tradition, a national Turkic literature was developed in the Chagatay language. Chagatay poets such as MÄ«r AlÄ« Sher NawÄ'Ä«, Sultan Husayn BÄyqarÄ, and ZÄher ud-DÄ«n BÄbur encouraged other Turkic-speaking poets to write in their own vernacular in addition to Arabic and Persian. The BÄburnÄma, the autobiography of BÄbur (although being highly Persianized in its sentence structure, morphology, and vocabulary), as well as MÄ«r AlÄ« Sher NawÄ'Ä«'s Chagatay poetry are among the best-known Turkic literary works and have influenced many others.\n\nArt\n\nDuring the reign of the Timurids, the golden age of Persian painting was ushered. During this period â and analogous to the developments in Safavid Persia â Chinese art and artists had a significant influence on Persian art. Timurid artists refined the Persian art of the book, which combines paper, calligraphy, illumination, illustration and binding in a brilliant and colourful whole. It was the Mongol ethnicity of the Chaghatayid and Timurid Khans that is the source of the stylistic depiction Persian art during the Middle Ages. These same Mongols intermarried with the Persians and Turks of Central Asia, even adopting their religion and languages. Yet their simple control of the world at that time, particularly in the 13â15th centuries, reflected itself in the idealised appearance of Persians as Mongols. Though the ethnic make-up gradually blended into the Iranian and Mesopotamian local populations, the Mongol stylism continued well after, and crossed into Asia Minor and even North Africa.\n\nArchitecture\n\nIn the realm of architecture, the Timurids drew on and developed many Seljuq traditions. Turquoise and blue tiles forming intricate linear and geometric patterns decorated the facades of buildings. Sometimes the interior was decorated similarly, with painting and stucco relief further enriching the effect. Timurid architecture is the pinnacle of Islamic art in Central Asia. Spectacular and stately edifices erected by Timur and his successors in Samarkand and Herat helped to disseminate the influence of the Ilkhanid school of art in India, thus giving rise to the celebrated Mughal (or Mongol) school of architecture. Timurid architecture started with the sanctuary of Ahmed Yasawi in present-day Kazakhstan and culminated in Timur's mausoleum Gur-e Amir in Samarkand. Timurâs Gur-I Mir, the 14th-century mausoleum of the conqueror is covered with ââturquoise Persian tilesââ Nearby, in the center of the ancient town, a Persian style Madrassa (religious school) and a Persian style Mosque by Ulugh Beg is observed. The mausoleum of Timurid princes, with their turquoise and blue-tiled domes remain among the most refined and exquisite Persian architecture. Axial symmetry is a characteristic of all major Timurid structures, notably the ShÄh-e Zenda in Samarkand, the Musallah complex in Herat, and the mosque of Gowhar ShÄd in Mashhad. Double domes of various shapes abound, and the outsides are perfused with brilliantly colors. Timurs dominance of the region strengthened the influence of his capital and Persian architecture upon India.\n\nRulers and heads of the dynasty\n\nRulers of the Timurid Empire\n\nTimur (Tamerlane) 1370â1405 (771â807 AH) â with SuyurghitmiÅ¡ Chaghtay as nominal overlord followed by MahmÅ«d Chaghtay as overlord and finally Muhammad SultÄn as heir\n\nPir Muhammad bin JahÄngÄ«r 1405â07 (807â08 AH)\n\nRulers of Herat\n\nShÄhrukh 1405â47 (807â50 AH; overall ruler of the Timurid Empire 1409â47)\n\nAbu'l-Qasim BÄbur 1447â57 (850â61 AH)\n\nShÄh MahmÅ«d 1457 (861 AH)\n\nIbrÄhim 1457â1459 (861â63 AH)\n\nSultÄn Abu Saâid GÅ«rgÄn 1459â69 (863â73 AH; in Transoxiana 1451â69)\n\nYÄdgÄr Muhammad 1470 (873 AH)\n\nSultÄn Husayn 1470â1506 (874â911 AH)\n\nBadi ul-ZamÄn 1506â07 (911â12 AH)\n\nMuzaffar Hussayn 1506â07 (911â12 AH)\n\nHerat is conquered by the Uzbeks under Muhammad Shaybani\n\nRulers of Samarkand\n\nKhalÄ«l SultÄn 1405â09 (807â11 AH)\n\nMohammad Taragai bin ShÄhrukh-I 1409â49 (811â53 AH; overall ruler of the Timurid Empire 1447â49)\n\n'Abd al-Latif 1449â50 (853â54 AH)\n\nâAbdullah 1450â51 (854â55 AH)\n\nSultÄn Abu Saâid 1451â69 (855â73 AH; in Herat 1459â69)\n\nAbu Sa'id's sons divided his territories upon his death, into Samarkand, Badakhshan and Farghana\n\nSultÄn ibn Abu Saâid 1469â94 (873â99 AH)\n\nSultÄn MahmÅ«d ibn Abu Saâid 1494â95 (899â900 AH)\n\nSultÄn Baysunqur 1495â97 (900â02 AH)\n\nMasâÅ«d 1495 (900 AH)\n\nSultÄn AlÄ« MÄ«rzÄ 1495â1500 (900â05 AH)\n\nSamarkand is conquered by the Uzbeks under Muhammad Shaybani\n\nOther rulers\n\nQaidu bin Pir Muhammad bin JahÄngÄ«r 808â811 AH\n\nAbu Bakr bin MÄ«rÄn ShÄh 1405â07 (807â09 AH)\n\nPir Muhammad bin Umar Sheikh 807â12 AH\n\nRustam 812â17 AH\n\nSikandar 812â17 AH\n\nAlaudaullah 851 AH\n\nAbu Bakr bin Muhammad 851 AH\n\nSultÄn Muhammad 850â55 AH\n\nMuhammad bin Hussayn 903â06 AH\n\nAbul A'la FereydÅ«n Hussayn 911â12 AH\n\nMuhammad Mohsin KhÄn 911â12 AH\n\nMuhammad ZamÄn KhÄn 920â23 AH\n\nShÄhrukh II bin Abu Saâid 896â97 AH\n\nUlugh Beg KÄbulÄ« 873â907 AH\n\nSultÄn Uways 1508â22 (913â27 AH)\n\nReferences and notes\n\n^ Zahir ud-Din Mohammad (2002-09-10).

To support his claim of the superiority of the Turkic language, Nawa'i also employs the curious argument that most Turks also spoke Persian but only a few Persians ever achieved fluency in Turkic.
