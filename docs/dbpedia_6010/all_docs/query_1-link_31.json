        "text": "April 5 – 6, 2024\n\nIn the not-so-distant past, Central Asia was one of the less accessible regions in the world due to its troublesome visa policy. Not wanting to miss out on the tourism dollars, gradually some of the countries began to open up. Uzbekistan, for example, has loosened up its visa policy since 2016, and nowadays most Western passport holders can enter the country without visas or letters of invitation from local travel agencies. Uzbekistan and its Silk Road cities, headlined by Samarkand, might still evoke a sense of exoticism, but reaching the country is as difficult as clicking “purchase” on a flight search engine. After years of dithering, I finally splurged on an expensive ticket to Samarkand via Istanbul during the Easter break. More expensive than flying into Tashkent, getting straight to Samarkand saved me time that I could otherwise spend in Istanbul with a 16-hour layover on each end of the trip.\n\nA thriving merchant city from the 4th century B.C. until the early 18th century, Samarkand is arguably the most renowned destination in Central Asia due to its distinctive style of Islamic architecture mostly built during the Timurid dynasty a century after the city was destroyed by the Mongols in the 13th century. Of the city’s handful of signature attractions, I am most awed by the buildings constructed during Timur’s reign except for the recently-reconstructed Bibi-Khanym Mosque.\n\nThe Registan\n\nThe Registan, Persian for “sandy place”, was a public square measured at 110 by 60 metres in the heart of the demolished old city and contained the three most recognizable structures in the country — the Ulugh Beg Madrasah (b. 1420) on the west, the Sher-Dor Madrasah (b. 1636) to the east, and the Tilya-Kori Madrasah in the middle (b. 1660). These three religious schools are a reminder that Samarkand was once a thriving learning centre on the Silk Road.\n\nImposing from afar, these iconic buildings looked as good as brand new due to restoration works applied over the past two decades. On closer inspection, the quality of the repair was often suspect, resulting in uneven wall tiles and shoddy paint jobs. The few trees not so long ago provided shade were removed for the nightly light and sound shows, made possible by installing massive speakers and projectors that seemed strikingly out of place. My personal aesthetics aside, the light and sound show was a definite crowd-pleaser in a city otherwise lacking nightlife options.\n\nGur Emir Mausoleum\n\nWhen Timur, the founder of the Timurid Empire, wasn’t launching military campaigns that caused the deaths of 17 million people, amounting to about 5% of the world population in the late 14th century, he oversaw a massive building spree in his capital. His military success from Persia to India brought the necessary craftsmen and resources to Samarkand, enabling the construction of many projects that still dominate the cityscape today such as the Gur Emir Mausoleum.\n\nLocated a 45-minute walk southwest of Shah-i-Zinda, this mausoleum was initially built for Timur’s grandson Muhammad Sultan; when Timur died before embarking on a conquest against the Ming dynasty, his body couldn’t be transported to his preferred location in Shahrisabz due to wintery road conditions so he was buried together with his grandson. This iconic structure would later inspire the designs of Mughal mausoleums such as Humayun’s Tomb and the Taj Mahal.\n\nShah-i-Zinda\n\nAmong Samarkand’s scattered attractions, my favourite is Shah-i-Zinda, meaning “the living king” due to the presence of Qutham ibn Abbas’s tomb, a cousin of Muhammad who brought Islam to the region in the 7th century. Already a revered pilgrimage site, the Timurid ruling class in the 14th – 15th centuries expanded it into a royal necropolis containing around twenty buildings.\n\nNavigating the compound through four arched-domed passages called “chartaks”, I was impressed by the combination of intricate majolica tiles, terracotta decorations, and massive blue domes. There was also a traceable trail of architectural progression, starting from headstones and foundations of demolished structures from the 11th century to the innermost, double-cupola building completed at the beginning of the 15th century in remembrance of the scientist Kazi Zade Rumi.\n\nShahrisabz\n\nOn the way to Bukhara, I stopped by Timur’s birthplace Shahrisabz, a city of 140k population located 80 km south of Samarkand. Ostensibly the entire historic district is protected as a World Heritage Site; it doesn’t take long, however, to understand why Shahrisabz has been deemed as “in danger” by UNESCO since 2016 after seeing most traditional houses in the area are gone and replaced by a huge park.\n\nThe most interesting remaining structure is Ak-Saray Palace, Timur’s grandiose summer palace that was supposed to be his full-time residence when he moved his capital to Shahrisabz. The move never occurred as the palace was completed one year before Timur’s death; it was ransacked in the 16th century and only a part of its 65-metre gate survived. Dorut Tilavat, a religious complex headlined by Kok Gumbaz Mosque (b. 1435) and its gigantic blue dome, is also worth a look."
