However after the death of all of these individuals their respective empires began to disintegrate (some faster than others). I would like to hear what you guys think the reasons were for each of these empires downfalls and the patterns that emerge when in comparison with one another.\n\nYour statement above is not strictly exact, as the Mongol Empire actually survived in a single piece and even expanded for a while under Temüjin's successor Ogotai.\n\nAside from that detail, the three empire certainly had to some extent an anlogous fate.\n\nIMHO the impressive military performance of the nations of these conquerors was not equated at all by their respective administrative abilities.\n\nAs our Diddy rightly pointed out in another thread, it is usually far more difficult to keep an Empire than to conquer it.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, the Classical Romans excelled in the former goal...\n\nYour statement above is not strictly exact, as the Mongol Empire actually survived in a single piece and even expanded for a while under Temüjin's successor Ogotai.\n\nTrue, some took longer to began their downfall than others, I actually believe that Genghis had some trace of good administrative ability (Mongol Laws, governmental system). When compared to the administrative ability of Alexander or Timur, Genghis looks like quite the governor. Whereas Timur and Alexander where possessed with conquering and only conquering (even more so than that of Genghis)\n\nI would say Timur and his descendents empire was the most longest lasting ones of the three. That could probably be due to the fact that their empire was considerably smaller than the Macedonian or Mongolian one.\n\nHowever i would consider them the greatest one of the three because they also left behind an architectural legacy (many of the Timurid kings were great patrons of arts).\n\nAnd other kings were very interested in the sciences and were pious rulers e.g. Ulugh Beg\n\n[ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulugh_Beg_Observatory\"]Ulugh Beg Observatory - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia[/ame]\n\nThough the Timurid Empire ended in the early 1500s, their descendents survived in the shape of the Mughal Empire all the way up till 1857. In a way great buildings made by the Mughals e.g. Humayuns tomb were inspired by the architecture of their central asian ancestors.\n\nThe empire fell apart due to internal warfare (succession wars) + the Uzbeks who eventually suplanted the Timurids (Shaybani Khan)."
