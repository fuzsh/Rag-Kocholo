        "text": "Timur\n\nPage history last edited by PBworks 17 years, 8 months ago\n\nWeek 14 IDs\n\nKelsey Rector\n\nTimur\n\nHe was conqueror of much of Western and central Asia, and founder of the Timurid Empire (1370–1405) in Central Asia and of the Timurid dynasty. This survived in some form until 1857.\n\nHe is also known as Timur-e Lang and Tamerlane. He ruled over an empire that extends in modern nations from south eastern Turkey through Central Asia and approached China. Later referred to as “conqueror of the world”.\n\nAfter his marriage into 13th-century Mongol conqueror Genghis Khan's family, he took the name Timūr Gurkānī.\n\nTimur's legacy is a mixed one, for while Central Asia blossomed, some say even peaked, under his reign, other places such as Baghdad, Damascus, Delhi and other Arab, Persian, Indian and Turkic cities were sacked and destroyed, and many thousands of people were slaughtered. Thus, while Timur remains a hero of sorts in Central Asia, he is hated by many in Arab, Persian and Indian societies.\n\nTimur wished to restore the Mongol Empire, and eventually planned to conquer China. In December 1404, Timur started military expeditions against the Ming Dynasty of China, but he was attacked by fever and plague when encamped on the farther side of the Sihon and died at Atrar in mid-February 1405.\n\nTimur also became widely known as a patron to the arts and much of the architecture he commissioned still stands in present-day Uzbekistan.\n\n..Timur's empire!\n\n..Statue of Timur!\n\n..Picture of Timur!\n\nTimur\n\nTip: To turn text into a link, highlight the text, then click on a page or file from the list above."
