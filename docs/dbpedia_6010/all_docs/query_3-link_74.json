        "text": "New Delhi: The term ‘Timurid‘ is generally used to describe the descendants of Timur who reigned or competed for power in western Turkistan, Iran, Afghanistan and India. For those uninitiated, Timur was a Turco-Mongol conqueror who founded the Timurid Empire in and around modern-day Afghanistan, Iran, and Central Asia, becoming the first ruler of the Timurid dynasty. As a commander, he apparently never lost a war and is widely considered one of the greatest military leaders and tacticians in history. While traces of legacy can be abundantly found in Central Asia, it also left behind its influence in the Indian subcontinent through the Mughal Empire.\n\nPossibly, in the history of India, no other empire or dynasty left a greater socio-political impact on the fabric of the country than the Mughals, during whose reign, India touch the zenith when it came to glory and prosperity.\n\nThe Timurid Dynasty\n\nThe Timurid Dynasty was a clan of Turco-Mongol origin that descended from Timur. The Timurids were in-laws of the line of Genghis Khan, founder of the Mongol Empire, as Timur had married Saray Mulk Khanum, a direct descendant of Genghis Khan. The Timurid Renaissance was heralded by the members of the Timurid Dynasty, and they were strongly influenced by Persian culture.\n\nStephen Frederic Dale wrote in the ‘Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society’ that apart from the universal acclaim for the cultural florescence that occurred in Husayn Bayqara’s Herat (1469–1506), different dynasties and populations chose to follow only those elements of Timurid civilization that suited their agendas and preferences. The Timurid legacy was mainly consolidated by three powerful forces in India. The Mughul emperors of India were true Timurids who embraced Timurid legitimacy with much spirit and consciously presided over a Timurid renaissance. Then, the Uzbek and Ottoman States were also the flagbearers of the legacy, whose Turkic rulers and subjects revered Timurid cultural achievements while sharing ambiguous feelings about the figure of Timur himself.\n\nIt all began with Babur\n\nThe Timurid legacy and influence in India began with Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire. Infact, it can perhaps be said that even though the Mongol-Timurid legacy influenced the Ottoman and á¹¢afavid states, it had its most direct impact on Babur. His father Umar Shaykh Mirza of Fergana was one among many Timurid “princes” who continued to rule small pieces of the lands their great ancestor had conquered. Babur, who claimed himself a descendant of both Timur and Genghis Khan, faced many hardships in his life before establishing the Mughal Empire after defeating Ibrahim Lodi, the Delhi Sultan, at the First Battle of Panipat in 1526.\n\nBabur was a direct descendant of Genghis Khan through his mother and was a descendant of Timur through his father. Timur was the last of the great nomadic conquerors of the Eurasian Steppe, and his empire set the stage for the rise of the more structured and lasting Islamic gunpowder empires in the 16th and 17th centuries, one of which was the Mughal Empire.\n\nTimur attacked and invaded parts of India in 1398, and even though he then turned elsewhere, that event served as one of the bases for the legitimacy of his heirs, the Mughals, to rule India.\n\nThe Timurid influence\n\nThe Mughals’ consciousness of their Central Asian roots and the prominence of Persian and Central Asian culture at their courts is an important chapter in the history of India. The Mughal Empire in India was firmly established by Akbar, arguably the greatest of the Mughal emperors. He was eclectic in his religious and cultural views, employing at his court many Naqshbandi Sufis from Central Asia but also allowing the Jesuits to establish themselves. His eclectic tastes can be seen in the art of the capital he built and soon abandoned at Fatehpur Sikri, which is largely Indian, but the decorative motifs draw heavily upon both Persian and Chinese models.\n\nStarting with Babur, most of the Mughal emperors had a particular fascination with Timur and their Central Asian roots. According to Daniel C Waugh, documents describing the conquests of Timur were read and copied, poetry and painting invoked him as the direct ancestor of the Mughal emperors, and various commemorative inscriptions were erected.\n\nJahangir, Akbar’s son and successor entertained writers from Central Asia in his imperial court. In 1627, while talking with one of them, he inquired specifically about the Gur-i Mir, Timur’s tomb in Samarkand, and offered to pay for its upkeep. Jahangir’s son, Shah Jahan came close to reconquering Central Asia and controlled Herat for a time, which had succeeded Samarkand as the Timurid capital in the 15th century.\n\nApart from literature and poetry, the Central Asian and Persian influences in the arts of the Mughal court can be seen in monumental architecture, most notably that of tombs. The great domed mausoleums of the Mughal rulers were based on the models from the territories of the former Timurid Empire.\n\nThe influence that ‘chaharbagh’ had on both Central Asia and India must be discussed here. That impact can be traced directly to Seyyed Mirak’s move first to India, where in 1529 he engaged in construction work at Agra and Dholpur for Babur, who has traditionally been credited with introducing the Timurid tradition of garden design to northern India; and then to Central Asia, where he emigrated sometime after 1530 and constructed a magnificent garden for Obeydallah Khan I in Bokhara. At around 1559, Seyyed Mirak’s son, Mohammad came to India from Bokhara and became the builder of Humayun’s tomb in Delhi. It has generally been accepted among architectural historians that Homayun’s tomb garden is the first preserved Mughal garden built according to the “classical” Timurid ‘chaharbagh’ pattern.\n\nEven though the Mughal Empire was a contemporary of the Safavid Dynasty, several scholars like Asher, Dale, Golombek, Habib, Hoag, Koch, Pereira, Stierlin & Stierlin have indicated that Mughal architecture was mostly influenced by the Timurid dynasty more than Safavid architecture. Koch in his book ‘Mughal Architecture: An Outline of Its History and Development, 1526-1858, cited that since the Mughals were direct heirs to the Timurids, the sustaining elements of their architecture, especially during the initial phase, were Timurid, and as such, a perfect symmetry of the plan reflected consistently in the elevations, as well as complex vaults patterns."
