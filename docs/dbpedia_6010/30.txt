The Timurid Empire, also known as the Timurid Dynasty, was a prominent Perso-Turkish empire that arose in the aftermath of the Mongol Empire's decline. Founded and named after its illustrious ruler, Timur (aka Tamerlane), who was born in 1336 in what is today's Uzbekistan.

History[]

Birth of Timur[]

Timur was born in the vicinity of Kesh (now Shahrisabz, Uzbekistan), in Chatagai Khanate on 8th of April, 1336. He was a part of the Turkic-Mongol Barlas confederacy. Timur's early years were marked by adversity and struggle, but he gradually emerged as a formidable military leader.

Rise of Timur[]

In thge 1360s, Timur began to establish himself as a local leader in the city of Kesh. He initially served as a military commander under Amir Kazgan, gaining valuable experience in warfare. Timur invaded Khorasan along with a thousand horsemen. It was the second military expedition he made, and its success led to further operations, among them the subjugation of Khwarazm and Urgench. One of Timur's key moments came in 1370 when he captured the city of Samarkand, a major cultural and political center in Central Asia. He made Samarkand his capital, which would serve as a base for his future campaigns.

Reign of Timur[]

The military campaigns of Timur were distinguished by scale and cruelty and played a decisive role in his coming to power. Firstly, Timur spread all his influence on Maverannahr (modern Uzbekistan) through a series of campaigns against various local rulers and tribal groups. The first wave of expansion lasted from the 1370s to the 1380s. Explaining his leadership in Maverannahra, Timur turned his attention to nearby Khorasan (part of present-day Iran, Afghanistan and Turkmenistan), where he met the local rulers and the remnants of the Ilhanate face to face. His victories in this region have further strengthened his power. Later, Timur began a destructive campaign in Persia, defeating the dynasties of the Jalairids and Muzaffarids. His capture of the city of Isfahan in 1387 was an important turning point, as it gave Timur and his empire many opportunities for expansion.

Invasion of Delhi[]

Timur's huge army crossed the Indus River at the end of 1398 and invaded the north-western region of the Indian subcontinent. His forces included a mixture of Turkic-Mongol soldiers and local auxiliary troops. The Indian subcontinent at that time was ruled by the Delhi Sultanate with Sultan Mahmud Tughlaq at the head. Timur advanced towards Delhi and encountered little resistance as he moved through Punjab.

Before reaching Delhi, Timur's forces besieged the city of Multan. After a fierce battle, Multan fell to Timur's forces.

In December 1398, Timur's army reached Delhi, one of the richest cities in the world at that time. Timur's troops brutally attacked the city. Thousands of residents were killed and countless people were enslaved. The famous Koh-i-Noor Diamond and other treasures were looted.

After the sack of Delhi, Timur began preparations to return to Central Asia. His campaign had achieved its primary objective of plundering wealth.Timur faced logistical challenges in governing such a distant territory, and he was also aware of potential revolts in the newly conquered regions.

Going West and North[]

Before the end of 1399, Timur began a war with Bayezid I, sultan of the Ottoman Empire, and the Mamluk sultan of Egypt Nasir-ad-Din Faraj. Bayezid began to annex the territory of the Turkmen and Muslim rulers to Anatolia. While Timur claimed sovereignty over the Turkmen rulers, they took refuge behind him.

In 1400, Timur invaded Armenia and Georgia. Of the surviving population, more than 60,000 inhabitants were captured as slaves, and many districts were depopulated. He also sacked Sivas in Asia Minor.

Timur then turned his attention to Syria, went to of Aleppo and Damascus. The inhabitants of the city were killed, except for the artisans, whi were exiled to Samarkand. And later, Timur attacked another strategic city, Baghdad, in June 1401. After the conquest of the city, more than 20,000 of its citizens were killed. Timur ordered that every soldier should return with at least two severed human heads to show him. When the men finished killing, many warriors killed prisoners captured at the beginning of the campaign, and when the prisoners finished killing, many beheaded their wives.

Historian David Nicolle, in his book "The Mongol Warlords", quotes an unidentified contemporary historian who compared the Eastern Army to "ants and locusts that covered the entire countryside, plundering and destroying."

Versus The Ottomans[]

Before Timur invaded Anatolia from the Ottoman Empire, many years of letters of contempt had passed between Timur and Bayezid. The two rulers insulted each other in their own way, while Timur preferred to undermine Bayezid's position as ruler and underestimate the importance of his military successes.

Finally, Timur decided to flex his muscles through Anatolia and defeated Bayezid in the Battle of Ankara on July 20, 1402. Bayezid was captured in battle and later died in captivity, beginning a twelve-year period of Ottoman Interregnum. Timur's motivation for attacking Bayezid and the Ottoman Empire was the restoration of Seljuk authority. The East saw the Seljuks as the legitimate rulers of Anatolia because they had been given power by the Mongol conquerors, redrawing Timur's interests with Genghizid legitimacy.

Attack on Smyrna[]

In December 1402, Timur besieged and took the city of Smyrna. Timur's army blockaded the port and attacked the fortifications with stone-throwing siege engines, while the defenders, consisting of only 200 knights, responded with arrows and incendiary bullets. After two weeks of strong resistance against a much superior enemy, the outer wall was destroyed by mining and broken. Part of the garrison managed to escape by sea, but the inhabitants and the city itself were essentially destroyed.

After the Treaty of Gallipoli in February 1403, Timur was furious with the Genoese and Venetians because their ships were ferrying the Ottoman army to safety in Thrace. As Lord Kinross reported in Centuries of the Ottoman Empire, the Italians preferred an enemy they could handle to one they could not.

During the early interregnum, Bayezid I's son Mehmed Çelebi acted as Timur's vassal. Unlike other princes, Mehmed minted coins on which Timur's name was embossed as "Demür han Gürgân" (تيمور خان كركان), alongside his own as "Mehmed bin Bayezid han" (محمد بن بايزيد خان). This was probably an attempt by Mehmed to justify to Timur his capture of Bursa after the Battle of Ulubad. After Mehmed settled in Rum, Timur had already begun preparations for his return to Central Asia and took no further steps to intervene in the status quo in Anatolia.

While Timur was still in Anatolia, Qara Yusuf attacked Baghdad and captured it in 1402. Timur returned to Persia and sent his grandson Abu Bakr ibn Miran Shah to recapture Baghdad, which he did. Timur then spent some time in Ardabil, where he handed over a number of prisoners to Ali Safavi, the leader of the Safaviyya. He then marched to Khorasan and then to Samarkhand, where he celebrated for nine months and prepared for the invasion of Mongolia and Ming Dynasty of China

Plot to invade China[]

Timur sat on his throne, his brow furrowed in thought. He had long dreamed of conquering China, but the thought of facing such a vast and powerful nation filled him with trepidation. He had consulted with his advisors, both military and cultural, but they could not provide him with the answers he sought. He knew that he needed more information, but how was he to obtain it without revealing his intentions?

Then, he remembered his third dream, the one in which he had consulted with an expert. The expert had advised him to send spies to China to gather intelligence, especially military intelligence. Timur smiled to himself. This was the solution he had been looking for.

In the spring of the following year, Timur dispatched a group of spies to China. They were disguised as traders and tourists, and they were instructed to gather as much information as possible about the country's geography, military, and culture. The spies traveled through Chagatai, sometimes taking an indirect route through Mongolia and Tibet. They eventually reached China, where they spent several months gathering intelligence. When the spies returned, they brought with them a wealth of information. Timur was now able to plan his invasion of China with confidence.

He knew that it would be a difficult and dangerous campaign, but he was determined to succeed. He had conquered much of the known world, and he was not about to let China stand in his way.

In the year, 1408, Timur releases back the imprisoned envoys back to China due to family obligations.

Conflict with Mamluks[]

An-Nasir Faraj, the young Sultan of the Mamluks, was facing many challenges. His kingdom was being ravaged by disease, and he was facing internal strife from Emirs in Syria. In a desperate attempt to find a scapegoat for his troubles, Faraj began blaming Timur, the powerful ruler of the Timurid Empire. Faraj sent insulting letters to Timur, and even imprisoned three Timurid envoys. Faraj was furious. He had never thought that he would have to bow down to Timur, a barbarian from the east. But he knew that he was in no position to refuse Timur's demands.

Invasion of Syria[]

In 1409, An-Nasir Faraj gathered a large army and marched into Timurid-held Iraqi territories. He was determined to strike back at Timur, the powerful ruler of the Timurid Empire, who had been insulting him and sending threatening messages. Faraj's army consisted of a mix of Mamluk soldiers, Arab mercenaries, and Bedouin tribesmen. He was also accompanied by a number of Emirs who were opposed to his rule.

Timur was enraged when he heard of Faraj's invasion. He immediately declared war on the Mamluks and mobilized his vast army. Timur's army marched into Syria and quickly began to conquer the Mamluk territories. The Mamluks were no match for the Timurid army, and they were quickly routed. Faraj's Emirs who had been fighting against his rule now deserted him and joined Timur's side. Timurids sweep through the entire Mamluk-led Strian territories, leading Faraj to move southwards to Lebanese territories.

Invasion of Lebanon[]

After conquering Syria, Timur turned his attention to Lebanon. He led his vast army southward, taking the Lebanese cities of Tripoli, Baalbek, and Jounieh along the way. The Timurid army was ruthless and efficient. They laid siege to Beirut, and within two weeks, the city had fallen. An-Nasir Faraj, the Sultan of the Mamluks, was forced to flee southward, humiliated and defeated. Faraj sent his slaves and soldiers northward to fight the Timurid army, but they were no match for Timur's forces. The Battle of Tyre ended in a decisive Timurid victory, and with it, Timur gained complete control over Lebanon.

Invasion of Haifa[]

After Faraj and some of it's men fled Lebanon, Faraj gathered the last of his men in Haifa. Haifa is a strategic city with a prominent jewish minority. Timur moved southward to the Palestinian territories, to try and finish off An-Nasir Faraj. Some accounts state that Timur reached the Palestinian territory on either October 21st or 24th of the year 1409. Without any mercy, they went on pilaging the places. The troops led by Faraj fought an intense battle in the northern Palestinian territories for a couple of days, until batches of Timurid war elephants arrived to the scene. Some of the war elephants were seen in Syria and Lebanon. This caused an immense panic along with the fact that Timur would reach to the holy city of Jerusalem.

Faraj was foreseeing all of it in his hideout of Haifa. Faraj revised his men to challenge with Timur, with Faraj being among them. Timur besieged the city of Akka on November 10th. Later on, Faraj, and thousands of his men, including slaves, and slave owners, fought with Timur in Haifa as they saw the Timurid army on the horizon, the clashes begun on November 13rd/14th. Alongside a fierce batte, Mamluks moved at a brutal speed to the Timurids all together, to challenge their strength. On November 15th Faraj, along with some of it's men, moved into Timurid-led Palestinian cities indirectly through withdrawing to southeast, and moving back to further north. There, Faraj's men captured tens of people as slaves and killed their garrisons. Faraj's men sneaked up behind to go back to Haifa, where the conflict still ravages on. They attacked the Timurid soldiers in the back. Timur ordered a psuedo-withdraw of it's soldiers, so they did. Faraj throught that it's about to be over. Faraj was angry at what he thought was that the Timirid army were cowards. He ordered his men to look for Timur, and bring Timur in front of him, so that he will execute him. Faraj ordered his men to rest. On November 23rd, Faraj took many experts with him to discuss a counter-offence against Timur northwards. He ordered the preparations to be made for the plot to be realized. Just then, Timur sent a letter to Faraj:

“ You have been carried away into provoking me to your literal humiliation. I felt literaly mad about that it happened. I'm literaly one of the great masters on the world(...) Would you choose to regret it, or choose to make us have you regret it? ”

–Timur's letter to An-Nasit Faraj in November 1409

An-Nasir Faraj responded to the latter, by denouncing Timur as a "monstrous evil" that is responsible for the calamities that happened to his (of An-Nasir Faraj) kingdom.

Faraj took some of it's men to attack Timurid-led city of Akka from east and south. Akka was seiged with devastating looting and enslaving the population. More men from Cairo and Alexandria met with Faraj at his behest. He ordered the men to march northwards against the Timurid Empire. Faraj's commands were co-held by one of his closest friend, Hussein Al-Arishi, who went alongside with the men attacking the Timurid Empire. Within hours of approaching to Timurid territory, Al-Arishi was held as a captive by the Timurids. On December 1st, a group of Timurid horsemen, along with some 8 war elephants, moved towards to Haifa in response of the Faraj's provocations. Faraj was shocked to see it, leading him to flee back to his hideout. Timurids sweep through the city, outmatching Mamluk army's power. A group of Timurid footsoldiers locate to the hideout of Nasir-ad-Din Faraj, in which Faraj successfully runs out from his hideout. Then Faraj fought with a horsemen, and Faraj failed to kill the horsemen, and he fell off. A second horsemen charges against Faraj, resulting in breaking two of his teeths. Another horsemen broke two another teeths of Faraj. As Faraj saw a war elephant trying to approach him, Faraj ran in fear, only to have two more of his teeths broken by another horsemen charge. Faraj, devastated, and had 6 of his teeths fell off, was laid to the ground, on the verge of tears. Timur approached Faraj and told his soldiers to stop. Timur lifts Faraj from ground, as Faraj was crying in pain. Timur asked Faraj to surrender, in which a desperate and damned Faraj accepted.

Faraj returned to Cairo in a desparate and humiliated look, accompanied by boos from the crowd.

Cairo Accord[]

Timur, and his envoys, visited Cairo on December 11, 1409. There, Timur offered the Cairo Accord for Faraj and his Mamluk Sultanate. From now on, Mamluk Sultanate will continue to operate with Nasir-ad-Din Faraj being the leader, as a tributary to the Timurid Empire, and there can't be other way around. Faraj, and his men, sincerely signed the agreement with Timur. From there, Mamluk Sultanate will be paying tributes to Timur.

Timur came back to Central Asia in it's glory, met by a cheering crowd. Timur said that as long as there's no provocation from elsewhere, would be laying eyes on Mongolia and China.

Later Moments In Timur's Reign[]

Marneuli Unrest[]

On January 28th, 1410, a priest called Imeda Maisuradze, encouraged his followers to rebel against the Timurid rule to liberate Georgia. They began seiging Imeda's hometown Marneuli from Timur's hands, using guerrilla tactics. A relative of a Timurid official stationed near Marneuli sent Timur the message about seperationists from Georgia. Timur couldn't belive he had to deal with an inner conflict just after benefiting from the inner conflict against Nasir-ad-Din to defeat him. Timur have dispatched men to finish off the riots in Georgia. Imeda and his men occupied propotions of Marneuli for 3-4 days, until the army finished off all of Imeda's soldiers and captured Imeda and executed him.

Appointment of Khalil Sultan[]

In 1414, a now fragile Timur, officialy announced the appointed one of his sons, Khalil Sultan, to be his Successor.

Khalil Sultan's focus on industrial, agricultural, and military advancements during his first year of inauguration suggests that he was a forward-thinking and ambitious ruler. He understood the importance of a strong economy and military in order to maintain his country's independence and security. He also recognized the need to improve relations with China, which was a powerful neighbor, even though, he was continuing the invasion plot against China secretly, by gathering more information about the military using spies.

In 1416, Khalil had to deal with Ar-Raqqah Uprising (also known as Najjar Uprising), which was led by a resident called Dawood Najjar, who was protesting against the Timurid rule. The rebellion stoped in about 8 days.

In 1417, Khalil met with the Ming tresure voyage leader, Zheng He, in Hormuz.

In the late spring of 1418, after reciving dozens of information from the spies, Khalil concluded that after the expulsion of Mongols, the Chinese built a long stury wall across the border, especially with the Timurid border. The Chinese people are more angrier than ever before. The Chinese built interesting types of weapons, especially those that usually use gunpowder, which was finally mastered by the Timurids, therefore developing strong weapons. Timurid Army were trained to efficiently use the weapons, learned from the Chinese. These Chinese-derived weapons are even put on war elephants.

In 1419, a Tblisi resident refered as Iosif of Tblisi was executed after killing a Timurid envoy.

Plot to invade Northern Yuan[]

Khalil met with Uwais Khan of Moghulistan in Almaliq in 1419 to plot an invasion of Northern Yuan, to use their land as a preparation for the Timurid invasion of Ming Dynasty of China, signing the Samarkand-Almalıq Pact, a deffensive pact between Timurid Empire and Moghulistan. While the preparations were made, the Shia uprisings were emerging from Persia to Afghanistan, so the plot never was realized.

Shia uprisings[]

A Shia scholar called Javad Hamidzadeh encouraged his followers to rebel against the Timurid rule on August 29th, 1419. The Ardabil Uprising begins, named after the city Javad lives in. Javad's men often engage in guerilla-style conflicts with Khalil's men. On September of this year, Timurid Army went to Javad's house, to see that he's not here. On December of this year, Khalil's men cleared out the Javad's men in Ardabil, considering the war literaly over. On late March of 1420, another group of Shia rebels attacked many places in Azerbaijan, including Baku and Ganja. Those types attacks were related to Javad's attacks, suspecting of him being in Azerbaijan. He was found in Sumqayit, but he fled quickly after being spotted.

Javad was finally captured in southern outskirts of Derbent on May 1st. He was trying to escape to the Golden Horde. Javad was brought to justice in Ardabil, and was executed on March 6th.

Plot to invade Oirat Condederation[]

After Khalil Sultan was done with the Shia rebellions, he disscussed back the topic of invading Northern Yuan, to gain land superiority. But first, they have to invade a nearby smaller nation that can provide coverage for the all-out invasion of Northern Yuan. Khalil showed the Chinese-derived weapons to Uwais Khan of Moghulistan. Moghulistan masters their own weapons and skills derived from the chinese,as given by Khalil. Preparations were made between two nations. In the summer of 1423, Khalil sent a letter to Khalil that his army mastered the skills for the invasion of the Oirat Confederation. The joint Moghul-Timurid troops were lined up at the Oirat border.

First Invasion of Oirat Confederation[]

Joint Timurid-Moghul invasion of Oirat Confederation commenced on September 25th, 1423. The allience troops march into the Oirat borders. On the other hand, Oirat Confederation have just dealt with Emperor Yongle of China. The Moghul and Timurid troops take southern propotions of Issyk Kul. The conflicting Oirat army consist of Choros clanssmen. The settlement of Balykchy of the western side of the lake was taken by the joint Timurid-Moghul Allience (or shortly TM Allience/TMA). The TMA took the lake from the Oirats, defeated the Chorus clan there. TMA troops began splitting up to east and north. Northward-advancing TMA troops clash with the Oirat men in Tengri Tagh (OTL Tian Shan), and the TMA troops wrecked the army there in 7-8 days. Eastward-advancing TMA troops foght with the clans of Choros and Olots and then take OTL Karakol from OC's hands.

The men from Choros and Tughrut clans fought the TMA troops in OTL Almaty, and gets devastated by the skills of the TMA army. The TMA army move forward to Lake Kapchagay. Meanwhile in the eastern chapter, TMA soldiers fight a fierce battle in Terskey Ala-too mountain range with the Choros and Olots clans. The Choros were considered almost finished off, wih many taken as prisoners of war and slaves. The war led to TMA victory in 6 days.

Northern chapter of TMA troops move forward to lowlands were they take the advantage of less logistic issues.

Eastern chapter of TMA face many issues while advancing to the mountains, due to climate being gradually harsher up there due to weatehr conditions. Some of them follow up low valleys.

The TMA troops and the OC soldiers fought fiercely in the early 1420s. The TMA troops wanted to reach Lake Balkhash or the mountains. The fighting happened around rivers, lakes, and in valleys.

In the winters of early 1424, the fighting stopped and the TMA troops moved back to Issyk Kul. This may have been because the fighting was seasonal or because Issyk Kul is a good place to defend.

Second Invasion of Oirat Confederacy[]

In March, the TMA troops invaded the Oirat Confederation, splitting their army into two groups. The northward-moving group fought to take Lake Balkhash from the Oirats, while the eastern group took control of the Tian Shan mountain range.

In late spring, the TMA troops successfully defeated the leader of the Oirat Confederation and declared the former Four Oirat territories as a semi-autonomous territory of Moghulistan. This was a major blow to the Northern Yuan, who had anticipated this and were preparing a response to the potential threat from the Timurid-Chagatai Alliance.

Plot to invade Northern Yuan (Again)[]

The Oirats have been defeated, and the Timurid-Moghul allies are now preparing to invade the Northern Yuan state. Khalil Sultan, the leader of the Timurids, has pledged to have world's many places on his hands and declare himself a reincarnated Genghis Khan. Khalil is following in the footsteps of his father, Timur, who was a brilliant military leader and conqueror. Timur had dreamed of uniting the Mongol world under his rule, and Khalil is determined to fulfill his father's legacy.

The Northern Yuan state is led by Adai Khan, who has recently unified the central and eastern parts of the nation. However, the western part of the Northern Yuan state is now occupied by the Timurid-Moghul allies, and has been declared a semi-autonomous region of Moghulistan.

Khalil knows that the Northern Yuan state will be a tough opponent. Adai Khan is a skilled and experienced military leader, and his army is well-equipped and well-trained. However, Khalil is confident that the Timurid-Moghul allies will be victorious in the coming invasion. The Timurid-Moghul allies have been preparing for the invasion since Khalil wants to fulfill his father's dream of invading China They have amassed a large army, and they have gathered supplies and equipment. Khalil has also been studying the tactics and strategies of the Northern Yuan army, and he is confident that he has developed a plan that will lead to victory.

Back in Khalil's place in Samarkand, he strode into his chamber. He sat down at his desk and began to write a letter to Adai Khan. In the letter, he challenged Adai Khan to a single combat. Khalil knew that Adai Khan was a vigorous warrior, and he was confident that he would accept the challenge. Khalil finished writing the letter and sealed it with his wax seal. He then summoned a messenger and ordered him to deliver the letter to Adai Khan immediately.

Khalil knew that the invasion of the Northern Yuan state would be a challenging, it's also kinda difficult and certainly a bloody conflict. However, he was determined to be victorious. He was determined to unite the Mongol world under his rule, fulfill the legacy of Genghis Khan and to declare himself the reincarnated one, as a descendant fulfilling the legacy of his beloved ancestor.

Invasion of Northern Yuan[]

In March 1426, a Timurid-Moghul army under the command of Khalil Sultan, the ruler of Moghulistan, invaded the Northern Yuan dynasty. The Timurids and Moghuls were two Turkic-Mongol dynasties that had emerged in Central Asia after the collapse of the Mongol Empire. The Northern Yuan, on the other hand, was a remnant of the Mongol Empire that had retreated to the steppe north of China after being expelled from Beijing by the Ming dynasty in 1368. The Timurid-Moghul army quickly penetrated into the Northern Yuan heartland, but they were met with stubborn resistance from the Northern Yuan Mongols, led by their khan, Adai Khan. The two armies clashed repeatedly around the rivers, lakes, steppes, and mountains of the Northern Yuan territory. Despite their numerical inferiority, the Northern Yuan Mongols fought bravely, but they were eventually overwhelmed by the Timurid-Moghuls. In late July 1426, Adai Khan was forced to surrender to Khalil Sultan. Khalil Sultan then imposed harsh terms on Adai Khan. He demanded that Adai Khan declare the Northern Yuan a tributary state of Moghulistan. Adai Khan had no choice but to agree to Khalil Sultan's demands. The Timurid-Moghul invasion of the Northern Yuan was a major turning point in the history of Central Asia. It marked the end of the Northern Yuan dynasty as a major power in the region. It also paved the way for the rise of the Timurid Empire as the dominant power in Central Asia.

The Almalıq Agreement[]

The Almalıq Agreement was a treaty signed between Khalil Sultan and Adai Khan in late July 1426. The treaty effectively made the Northern Yuan a tributary state of Moghulistan. Under the terms of the treaty, Adai Khan was required to pay tribute to Khalil Sultan and to provide military assistance to Moghulistan when requested. The treaty also prohibited the Northern Yuan from making alliances with any other power without the consent of Moghulistan. The Almalıq Agreement was a major diplomatic victory for Khalil Sultan. It secured Moghulistan's dominance over the Northern Yuan and made it the most powerful state in Central Asia.

Khalil Sultan, the ruler of the Timurid Empire, was a confident and ambitious man. He had recently unified the mainland Mongolia under his banner, and now he was setting his sights on becoming the world leader.

Khalil returned to his capital of Samarkand to a hero's welcome. The people cheered and applauded as he rode through the streets. Khalil addressed the crowd, telling them that they were one step closer to declaring a worldly empire.

Khalil retired to his palace feeling content. He knew that his empire was about to achieve great things...

Conflict with Marwar Kingdom[]

However, Khalil's ambitions were soon thwarted. In March of 1427, the neighboring Hindu Kingdom of Marwar, led by Rao Chunda, declared war on Timurid-led Delhi.

Khalil was shocked and angered by Chunda's declaration of war. He immediately ordered his troops to counter Chunda's attacks and declared war on the Marwar Kingdom. The Timurid army, equipped with massive war elephants, mercilessly pushed through the Marwar borders. They sacked everything they saw, leaving behind a trail of devastation.

The war of the Marwar capital Mandore was pretty bloody. The Timurid army eventually emerged victorious, but not before inflicting heavy casualties on the Marwar forces.

After the battle of Mandore, Khalil marched to Rao Chunda's palace and challenged him to a wrestling match. Khalil won the match, and then demanded that Chunda and his successors pledge to be Timurid tributaries. Chunda refused, and instead drew his sword on Khalil. The two men engaged in a sword fight, which resulted in Khalil losing a tooth and Chunda being killed.

The Timurid army celebrated over Khalil's victory. Khalil annexed the Marwar state into the Timurid Empire, and secured his position as one of the most powerful rulers in the world.

Khalil Sultan's victory over the Hindu Kingdom of Marwar was a major turning point in his reign. It marked the further expansion of the Timurid Empire into India, demonstrated Khalil's military prowess, and sent a strong message to potential rivals.

After his victory over the Marwar Kingdom, Khalil Sultan turned his attention back to China. He was confident that he could invade China and defeat the Ming dynasty. But he also knew that the Great Wall of China was the only major obstacle in his way, so he planned to break it down before launching his invasion.

Khalil's achivements over Northern Yuan didn't go unnoticed by Ming China. In May 1427, he received a letter from the Xuande Emperor of Ming China. The emperor warned Khalil Sultan against invading China and reminded him of the Ming dynasty's military strength. Khalil Sultan knew that he could not afford to go to war with the Ming dynasty at this, because of the Sword Swing Period that he was responsible for, which exausted parts of his army and drained the tressury nevertheless.

In the meantime, Khalil Sultan focused on consolidating his power in Central Asia and on developing his empire. He commissioned the construction of new mosques, libraries, and schools. He also supported the developements of new technologies. Khalil Sultan's contributions to art and technology had a lasting impact on the Timurid Empire.

Canceling his plans on China[]

Khalil was given a letter by a Ming representitive, in which he gave the letter that was written by Zheng He, a muslim Chinese traveller. Zheng He told Khalil that he was worried about his invasion of Ming Dynasty, and that "it would cost a lot of our brothers and sisters." Zheng He told Khalil to come to Nanjing to meet him, Khalil accepts it. Khalil met with Zheng He in Nanjing. Zheng He, who is a muslim like Khalil, prefered business cooperation with him.

Khalil was pretty much not aware about on how muslim community, including muslims like Zheng He, was elevated under Ming Dynasty, and that the invasion of China would cost the lives of many muslim lives. Khalil heartfelt the words said by Zheng He, Khalil canceled his invasion plot of China. Khalil later went on signing trade deals with the Ming Emperor, freely allowing traders from both nations to trade in the other side. The relations between Ming and Timurid Empire mended overtime.

In the name of cooperation, some of the Timurid men were involved in the Tresury Voyages with Zheng He. About 12 men from the Timurid Empire joined the voyages. One of these men, a man called Rostam Pamiri, wrote a diary about his witnesses in Zheng He's voyages.

Northern Yuan Determination[]

Khalil and Chinese Emperor met with each other in Beijing on August 27th, 1431. The Xuandu Emperor was concerned about the Timurid vassalship around the entire Central Asia. Both parties made discusions about the topic. Then an agreement was reached on July 5th, 1433, which is about the process of detering spheres of influnences over Northern Yuan, which also consists of many disputes, especially over certain rivers and Baikal Lake. Chinese masters questioned the absoulute Timurid influnence of Northern Yuan. Finally, an agreement was made on March 2nd, 1434. Both parties signed the Beijing Agreement. One of the main terms were de facto giving away the adiminstration of Northern Yuan to Ming China, and make Four Oirat a joint administration between Moghulistan and China.

List of Sultans[]
