The Timurid Empire was a Persianate Turko-Mongol empire that encompassed modern-day Iran, Mesopotamia, the Caucasus, Afghanistan, much of Central Asia, and parts of Pakistan, Turkey, and Syria.

The empire was founded by Timur (also known as Tamerlane), a warlord of Turco-Mongol lineage who established the empire between 1370 and his death in 1405. He envisioned himself as the great restorer of the Mongol Empire of Genghis Khan, and, while not descended from Genghis, regarded himself as Genghis's heir and associated much with the Borjigin.
