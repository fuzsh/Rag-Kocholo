        "text": "Twenty-five years after Hannibal Lecter first invaded the imaginations of countless readers worldwide in Red Dragon, author Thomas Harris crafted Hannibal Rising, the origin story of his iconic cannibalistic serial killer.\n\nHannibal Rising introduces us to eight-year-old Hannibal Lecter, wide-eyed and innocent; a brother to his younger sister Mischa, and a devoted son to his Lithuanian count father and Italian aristocrat mother. But when their loving home is bombed by the Germans in 1945, killing their parents, Hannibal and Mischa are left to fend for themselves.\n\nIn the aftermath, Hannibal witnesses an unspeakable act of cruelty that will haunt him forever. Traumatized and orphaned, Lecter finds care in the home of his uncle and aunt, but vengeance consumes his thoughts. A brutal tale filled with violence and beauty, Hannibal Rising is a story of innocence lost and how insufferable tragedy begets depraved monsters.\n\nThe fourth and final book in the Hannibal series, Hannibal Rising was first published in 2006. It was adapted by Thomas Harris into a film directed by Peter Webber the following year.\n\nThe signed limited edition of Hannibal Rising by Thomas Harris is presented in three states: Lettered, Numbered and Artist editions.\n\nNUMBERED EDITION\n\n6” x 9” trim size.\n\n280 pages.\n\nLimited to 350 copies.\n\nSigned by Thomas Harris and Tom Bagshaw.\n\nFull Japanese cloth binding.\n\nBlind stamped cover.\n\nFoil stamped leather spine label.\n\nSix full color illustrations by Tom Bagshaw.\n\nPrinted offset on premium Mohawk Via paper.\n\nEndsheets are French marbled.\n\nHoused in a brocade wrapped slipcase with cloth ends.\n\nBookmark with all pre-orders."
