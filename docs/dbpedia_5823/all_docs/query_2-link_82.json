        "text": "\"A varied and exciting collection that will be of interest and importance to many scholars in TV/media studies and cultural studies. Given that the collection features several chapters that focus on the adaptation of books, television, and movie versions of Hannibal, it will also be of value to literary scholars, film scholars, and those with a particular interest in adaptation.\"—Rebecca Williams, University of South Wales\n\n\"An excellent book and provides a strong academic background to the study of Hannibal in its various manifestations. It was so good, I just ate it up.\"—Paul Booth, DePaul University\n\n\"Becoming brings together an impressive range of perspectives about how Hannibal queered its source material to craft deliciously perverse narratives, genres, characters, practices, and critiques of institutional discourses—all this in ways that were progressive, ingenious, and affecting.\"—Allison McCracken, associate professor of American Studies, DePaul University\n\n\"Filled with forensic connoisseurship, this collection is one to be savored. Kavita Mudan Finn and EJ Nielsen have assembled a fine roster of contributors, including production staff from the show.\"—Matt Hills, author of Fan Cultures\n\n\"[A] rich collection of essays which explore the series Hannibal with topics including themes of horror, gore, cannibalism, queerness and transformation. This volume will be of particular value, however, to scholars invested in queer readings of television. . . .The book is also valuable for its inclusion of commentary from production staff from the show alongside academic articles.\"—Critical Studies in Television: The International Journal of Television Studies\n\n\"The sheer breadth and variety of criticism included in this relatively slim volume is a significant part of its charm.\"—Jump Cut: A Review of Contemporary Media"
