        "text": "Hannibal Lecter is one of the greatest fictional villains ever created. A genius, cannibalistic serial killer who helps investigators find other serial killers. Add in Clarice Starling—a strong and smart female hero with inner struggles as complex and interesting as the external conflicts—and a cast of unique supporting characters, and you’ve got some real magic…at times.\n\nThomas Harris has published four books with Hannibal Lecter, resulting in five film adaptations and two spin-off television series:\n\nSome of these I’d read and watched before (I’ve seen The Silence of the Lambs a half dozen times), but this time I binged all of the books and films together. A rather dark rabbit hole. I’ve seen a few episodes of the series Hannibal (three seasons, 2013-2015) but have not yet watched CBS’s Clarice (based on the week-over-week ratings, Clarice seems to be floundering).\n\nOverall, the collection is uneven. At its best, it is cerebral, suspenseful, and the main characters have complex psyches with motivations that are alluded to but not fully illuminated. And at its best, it mixes genres, most successfully when it overlays horror conventions onto police procedural. Harris and the filmmakers involved in the adaptations achieve this brilliantly in The Silence of the Lambs and, to a lesser degree, in Red Dragon/Manhunter.\n\nBelow I give a little more on each work, best to worst.\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs film is the best of the best. It took home five Oscars: Best Picture, Best Director (Jonathan Demme), Best Actor (Anthony Hopkins), Best Actress (Jodie Foster) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Ted Tally). It is the only horror film to ever win a Best Picture Oscar. It’s listed on “AFI’s 100 Best Films of the Century” list. I watched the film and the various commentaries, mini-docs and extras, and it all holds up, 30 years later. It is a must-see.\n\nHannibal Lecter is a forensic psychiatrist—or, at least, was before he got thrown in jail for eating people—and both Graham and Starling have plenty of skeletons in their closet that Lecter can tug on. “Quid pro quo,” as he says to Starling. She trades answers about her childhood, giving Hannibal access to her psyche in return for clues about her case. This sets up a psychological danger that is as riveting as the action scenes.\n\nBoth The Silence of the Lambs and its prequel, Red Dragon, keep Lecter—the most interesting character—locked up for the majority of the story as he guides the investigators (Will Graham in Dragon; Clarice Starling in Lambs) in their pursuit of other serial killers. It’s a smarter version of the horror film technique of withholding a clear visual of the monster until late in a monster movie. It helps build the tension—what you imagine in the dark is always scarier—and keeps audiences leaning in. A bit of delayed gratification that, in this form, works in the cinema as well as on the page. We hear the stories of Lecter’s violent crimes, but it’s hard to square those atrocities with the sophisticated, calm man behind the glass of his cell. When he eventually escapes, we feel the requisite terror, but we also feel the sadistic delight of an audience that’s been waiting for this moment, like when the dinosaurs inevitably escape in Jurassic Park. Let’s see what this thing can do.\n\nThe triangulation of investigator / serial killer on the loose / Hannibal Lecter as an evil but necessary collaborator makes the plots of these two installments the most successful in the series. It’s good in Red Dragon. It’s near perfect in The Silence of the Lambs. The vulnerability of Clarice Starling is cranked up—she’s not only female in a man’s world, but she’s also a trainee. Her inexperience and vulnerability are exposed early in her first meeting with Lecter, whom she has been sent to interview at the mental hospital. She attempts a clumsy segue, and he condescendingly puts her in her place: “Oh no no no no. You were doing fine.” He is in full control, and she is naïve, in way over her head.\n\nThese interview scenes, where Clarice visits Lecter in the dank basement of the mental hospital and they talk through the glass, are a masterclass in filmmaking. The characters reveal themselves to each other (and to us) bit by bit, with fantastic dialogue and subtle acting. Anthony Hopkins looks directly into camera instead of the more conventional off-camera sight line of a dialogue scene, a creepy effect that puts us in Starling’s shoes. And Foster’s self-conscious reaction as she fights to keep her composure after Lecter exposes her inexperience is fantastic.\n\nThese scenes also contain a sexual metaphor—the innocent virgin flirting with an experienced, dangerous man. Clarice is exposing herself, psychologically undressing for Hannibal the Cannibal, attempting to use her inner secrets to lure him out, to get what she needs from him, without completely giving herself away or ceding control. He’s after what’s inside her mind. He wants to know everything about her. She knows this. We know this. It’s this psychological/sexual dance that makes these scenes feel so perilous.\n\nOne interesting tidbit from the DVD extras—Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins only did one table read of the scene beforehand and had no opportunity to chit-chat before or after. They both admitted to being somewhat intimidated by the other, which they say might have actually helped create the awkward tension in this scene.\n\nBeyond being a great story with great characters brought to life by great actors, Silence’s thematic exploration of gender roles is powerful and deftly integrated throughout.\n\nClarice, a woman hero in a typically masculine role, is constantly the victim of subtle and overt sexism, from judgmental stares of the agents she works with to the clumsy propositions of men like Dr. Chilton, the head of the asylum that holds Lecter. To survive, she has to be strong physically, but even more so mentally.\n\nStarling is willing to engage in the quid pro quo with Lecter, but it is an uneven arrangement. She reveals to Lecter personal details—like that she lost her father at a young age—in exchange for information about Buffalo Bill. She gives Lecter revealing, personal information that puts her in danger. He is doing it for the titillation. The information he trades is of no personal sacrifice to him. This uneven exchange of personal information for professional gain is analogous to a professional environment where a woman is rewarded for—or even expected to—employ her personal charms or sexuality if she is to advance professionally.\n\nWe see this dynamic later, at a funeral home in West Virginia, when Clarice brings out her hometown, West Virginia accent to address the group of men and get them out of the room: “Excuse me, gentlemen, ya officers and gentlemen, listen here now…” She deftly employs her background as a local, her female charm, and a certain degree of deference to the gentlemen in the room. “Go on now and let us take care of her,” she tells them. Notice, as she is delivering this line, the look up and down she gets from the officer in center of frame. She is bearing this sexism, these judgmental eyes, to get the job done.\n\nClarice lost her father when she was young. The significance of this resurfaces several times in the film in the form of flashbacks, after she initially reveals it to Lecter. It’s an important element, because it provides context for the dualling father figures who guide her in her case: Hannibal Lecter, brilliant but evil; and Jack Crawford, her boss, kind but old fashioned. They are both also using her, manipulating her for their own needs. She willingly engages in the exchange with Lecter, and she knows she needs Crawford’s support if she is to climb the ladder at the FBI. So she plays the role he needs her to play—the young submissive female agent. But she isn’t shy about speaking her mind to him, most prominently when, after he has dismissed her from a room of male police officers during an investigation. In the car later, he brings it up in a semi-apology and attempts to shrug it off as “just smoke.” “It matters,” she says. “Point taken,” he acknowledges.\n\nOn the flip side of Starling—a woman trying to break into a man’s world—is the villain, Buffalo Bill. His real name is Jame Gumb, and when it’s first mentioned, the odd name “Jame” is dismissed as a bit of carelessness on the birth certificate. But thematically, it matters. “Jame” is a hybrid, halfway between James and Jane. As we will discover, Mr. Gumb longs to become a woman. He has applied and been rejected for several sex change operations. Hence, he is working to create a suit from the flesh of real women.\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs took some flak from LGBTQ+ groups for its portrayal of Gumb as a freak, criticizing it for reinforcing the stereotype that transvestites and transexuals are psychologically damaged or dangerous (a la Psycho). The book elaborates more than the movie, as if anticipating this criticism, and makes a point to say that Gumb is not a real transexual and that, in fact, most transsexuals are not in any way violent. Still, it’s somewhat controversial, and Harris walks a fine line (maybe crosses it) again with a character in Hannibal.\n\nThis issue of gender roles and gender fluidity in The Silence of the Lambs is ripe for deep analysis. But even if a viewer just wants a great, edge-of-your-seat thriller and wants to skip the film school theories, Lambs delivers. It works on all levels. The novel is also very strong. There are a few nuances in the novel that are cut from the film out of necessity, but in general the movie is very faithful. I’d recommend both.\n\nRed Dragon / Manhunter\n\nThe novel Red Dragon is great. Francis Dolarhyde, aka “the Red Dragon” (his name for himself), aka “The Tooth Fairy” (the name the tabloid press has given him), has already killed two families, sneaking into their homes on full moon nights. Now, as the next full moon is approaching, Will Graham, the retired agent responsible for putting Hannibal Lecter behind bars, is asked to consult on the case.\n\nDolarhyde is weird enough to feel authentically psychopathic. Abused as a child and now hyperconscious of his looks, he believes he is commanded by the Red Dragon, a creature in a William Blake painting. He, like Jame Gumb from Lambs, is on the verge of a transformation (or so he believes).\n\nThe Red Dragon novel is very much worth the read.Michael Mann’s 1986 film adaptation, Manhunter, is good, but is a stylistic product of the 80s.\n\nThe 2002 film version of Red Dragon, starring Ray Fiennes, Ed Norton, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Anthony Hopkins, is not a terrible film. It’s well-made and well-acted, but it’s completely unnecessary and feels like a studio milking a franchise.\n\nSpeaking of which…\n\nHannibal and Hannibal Rising\n\nThe two stories that follow—Hannibal and Hannibal Rising—lose the balance. Hannibal wobbles, and Hannibal Rising tips on its head, but they essentially do it by committing the same mistake in different ways—in an attempt to dial up the menace and horror, they reveal too much. In the graphic nature of the plots and the execution of the films, they show the violence, the gore, the blood and guts. They move from suspense punctuated by shocking moments of violence, to over-the-top graphic violence and physical (not just psychological) sadism. It is a shift from Jaws to SAW. The result is sometimes schlocky, sometimes exploitative, sometimes laughable, sometimes just a little disappointing.\n\nHannibal, the much-hyped follow-up to Lambs, finds Clarice Starling trying to apprehend the still-on-the-run Lecter before one of his former patients, our new psychopathic villain, is able to capture the doctor. There are a few wonderful moments, but this attempt to make Hannibal a hero by creating an even greater evil, and some of the plot moves that make Hannibal seem more like James Bond than an aging psychiatrist, all feel like Hannibal’s superstardom has gone to everybody’s heads.\n\nRidley Scott, who I think has a special love for wrathful filmmaking, finds plenty of material here. The book is gruesome, and Scott seems to revel in leaving nothing to the imagination. He does, however, fix a very controversial ending to Harris’s novel. It’s a rare example of a filmmaker correcting a major plot point.\n\nJulianne Moore plays Starling, and while I like Moore, she’s no Jodie Foster in this role. Overall, Hannibal the book is better, but it feels as if the whole thing is approaching the shark, if not quite jumping it yet.\n\nThat would be where Hannibal Rising comes in. If you’re a fan of the series and have exhausted everyting else and are hungry for more, then maybe you’ll find something in Hannibal Rising. To me, it exemplifies what I call the Boba Fett effect. The more light you shine on a mysterious character, and one who is loved partly because they are mysterious, the less interesting they become. Boba Fett was one of the best, coolest secondary characters in the original Star Wars films. When they came back for the ill-fated second trilogy, they dedicated much of the second film to Boba Fett’s background, and it was sinful. It almost ruined Boba Fett. Hannibal Rising doesn’t ruin the Hannibal Lecter character, but it gives it a good go.\n\nIn this prequel, we find a young Hannibal as a part of a royal family, living on the Eastern Front at the end of World War II, as the Germans are retreating and wreaking havoc as they pull back from the Russians. They have lost the war and are in a pretty foul mood. Hannibal, a lovely, caring boy, witnesses some terrible things and yada yada…Hannibal the Cannibal. This backstory was fine as a few subtle allusions in Hannibal. As a full story, it becomes absurd. To the point earlier about the successful mixing of the police procedural with the horror genres in the first two books and films, here we get horror mixed with a kind of Steven Seagal revenge story.\n\nThe Hannibal and Hannibal Rising books and films are interesting if, like me, you’ve gone into this world and just want more of the characters, or are curious enough to want to light up all of the dark corners, but otherwise I’d say they’re not worth the time investment.\n\nAll in all, this is a classic series. Silence of the Lambs is the best place to start—amazing overall. Then go to Red Dragon/Manhunter. If you’re still hungry for more, Hannibal may make you lose your appetite. Hannibal Rising is likely not the dessert you’re looking for. Perhaps one of the spinoff shows. Based on the ratings, Hannibal is probably the better bet."
