        "text": "Basically I'm posting this based on the discussion from today's EHG about Hannibal. It's going to have spoilers for all the books (and movies) in the series and also some theories about where they're going with the characters in the show. No spoilers for the show because I don't actually know anything, but some speculation based on my knowledge of the books and some casting news that names a character. Spoilers start in the next paragraph.\n\nHannibal is set in the time before he's caught by the FBI which is well before the events in the books but the books do have a great deal of back story and they're hitting a lot of the same marks in the show. In Red Dragon we learn that Will Graham is an ex homicide detective who left cop work to become a teacher at the FBI Academy and was sometimes used as a profiler for difficult cases. He was a Special Investigator in the field. One of his early cases was the \"Minnesota Shrike\" case (the first case he and Hannibal work on together in the show) which causes him to have a breakdown and be hospitalized for a month. He returns to the FBI and his next big case is the Chesapeake Ripper case (where he meets Hannibal in the books, also where he realizes Hannibal is the perpetrator of the case) he is very nearly killed by Hannibal but survives and Hannibal is convicted of the murders. Will retires from the FBI and is then brought back in to profile the Red Dragon case which is where the first book starts. The fight scene at the beginning of the second season of the show between Crawford and Lecter looks a lot like the fight that Will and Lecter have when Will figures out that Lecter is in fact the serial killer he's been hunting this whole time.\n\nThe show is supposed to take place before/during the events outlined in the book Red Dragon as Will's backstory. They've already inserted Hannibal into the Shrike case, a case he wasn't involved with in the books and also removed Will from the Ripper case and put that FBI trainee in Will's place, to the point where she solves the case in the same way Will did, but she doesn't end up taking Lecter down.\n\nThe show has cast Michael Pitt as Mason Verger who is a character from the book Hannibal, but who started his history with Lecter well before the events of Red Dragon. Prior to being convicted of the Ripper murders Hannibal acted as Verger's court appointed psychiatrist after Verger was convicted of child molestation.\n\nWhile they're clearly messing with the books cannon and timeline they are still keeping the same players around and in the same rolls, so I don't think they're going to kill Will, even if he's super annoying on the show. I'm also guessing that by the end of this season Crawford will know that Lecter is a killer but that maybe Lecter will still be free because no proof? I don't know. That first scene is screwing everything up.\n\nThat's what I really love about this show. People who don't know the story are being drawn in and introduced to it in the same way the readers of the books were. People who DO know the books and think they know what's coming are seeing the story they know completely turned on its head.\n\nEvents from the books are already being played out on the show, just in different ways, or involving different characters. Many aspects of the books from Hannibal's incarceration have been re-purposed for Will this season (such as Chilton's inability and desperation to figure him out). The scene from Red Dragon, where Hannibal uses Freddy Lounds and The Tattler to send a message to his admirer (The Tooth Fairy) asking him to kill Will Graham and his family... that was a major plot point from Red Dragon, and we saw that on the show just two weeks ago, only it was Will using Freddie and tattlecrime.com to send his admirer after Hannibal. The way Will caught Lecter was re-purposed for Miriam Lass, who was supposed to be a Clarice-type character, and has just returned (can't WAIT to see what her story is!), so there's no telling what will happen with her. The show seems to be taking major events from the books and twisting them up to surprise, delight and horrify us in new ways! I know Bryan Fuller wants to start covering the books in later seasons, but honestly, I bet Season 4 (the Red Dragon season) will be the characters hunting Dolarhyde, but in a completely different framework than the one the books provided. Because he seems to be not re-telling the story from the Harris books, but rather telling the story hidden between the lines. It's a very interesting way to stay faithful to the events from the books, without becoming stuck in the pattern of having to re-tell them as written.\n\nAnd since I'm enjoying the series WAY more than I did the books, I say, Bryan Fuller, have at!\n\nOne of the problems with reading Red Dragon is that it was published in 1981 -- which means it falls in line with certain viewpoints at the time. Margot was changed because Bryan Fuller didn't want to portray her in the same way that Thomas Harris did in Hannibal (again, when Harris created Margot as an adult, her characterization fell in line with certain viewpoints).\n\nAs someone who hasn't read the books or seen the movies, I'm finding this discussion to be fascinating. I do think that DementedDaisy might have a point about the Red Dragon being written in 1981 and that it probably reflects some of the attitudes of the times--even though it may have been a minority opinion of that time. I work for a small community news paper that has archives back to 1891 and we do this feature every week where we pull out a few nuggets from the archives for 10, 20, 50 and 100 years ago and you would be amazed at how married women were referred to as \"Mrs. Bob Bobson\" or \"Mrs. John Johnson\"--they had no identity of their own outside of their marriage--up until the late 1980s. Also, I have a friend whose mother was in need of a hysterectomy in 1979 due to complications after a miscarriage and the hospital would not perform it without the written consent of her husband because he would be giving up his chances to have more children--not a lot of concern for the woman's actual heath or her own wants or opinions. So, even though it may seem rather archaic for the times, there were probably still quite a few cave men and women still around.\n\nNone the less, you guys are making me want to read the books now, more than I ever have before.\n\nSo far, in my re-read, no one has described Will as being empathetic or possessing \"pure empathy\". Crawford says that Will is able to \"see things\" that others can't, but I interpreted that as Will being one of the original profilers. He saw patterns in behavior that made him able to understand why the killer did the things he did, or he's able to see things that others have missed. Cops and agents can't do those things, so he's ascribed \"gifts\" that may not actually be there.\n\nI haven't seen Manhunter or Red Dragon in years, so it's possible that the idea of Will being empathetic may have come from one of them as opposed to from the book. In fact, his failure to understand his wife and stepson are evidence, in my mind, that Thomas Harris never intended Will to be in possession of \"pure empathy\".\n\nI also object to the idea that the tv show has \"fixed\" the characterization of Will Graham. I think that the character has been updated to fit the current timeline (i.e. he's a product of the now, as opposed to the 70's), but I wouldn't call him \"fixed\".\n\nBut miles vary, of course. And I concede that just because I haven't found it in the book yet doesn't mean it's not there. (Will possessing \"pure empathy\".)\n\nDiscussion of Hannibal as anti-hero carried over from character thread:\n\nI have never considered Hannibal an anti-hero, even after the events of Hannibal Rising. The murders he commits in that book have a certain justification -- even self defense at least once -- but they are in no way heroic, IMO. For example, he doesn't care about the prostitutes on the boat when he kills Grutas. He doesn't know how many people are on the boat when he rigs it to blow up, and frankly doesn't care.\n\nI think the movie version of Hannibal created the idea of Hannibal as anti-hero (or at least greatly contributed to it). Apart from rooting for Hannibal to escape from Mason (and rescue Clarice in the process), the movie ending created a situation that didn't occur in the book.\n\nI know many people did not like the book ending, but it never wavered from the idea that Hannibal was brainwashing Clarice and he might kill her at some point -- he even told her as much. In the movie, however, Hannibal sacrificed his own hand to escape.\n\nYeah, that would never happen, IMO. It suggests that Hannibal cared more about keeping Clarice safe and whole over his own self-preservation. Clarice is safe (from Hannibal) as long as Mischa cannot take her place, but if Hannibal could find a way to do it (to make the teacup whole again), he would kill Clarice without hesitation, IMO.\n\nSo the movie gave a us a Hannibal who is trying to survive against a more sadistic character; who kills a deplorable man who is actively trying to sabotage Clarice's career; who sacrifices himself instead of harming the woman he may love (\"That's my girl.\") -- almost textbook anti-hero.\n\nBut mileage varies.\n\nEdited June 13, 2014 by Demented Daisy\n\nFinished the series as it stands. I was very pleased overall. It's overly macabre for me but the music, sets, atmosphere, casting (fun!) and performances outweigh the \"oh, stop it\" moments I have with the murders.\n\nI rewatched Manhunter and BOY has that thing withstood the tests of time. Aside from the hilarious mobile phone (weighed a pound and had an antenna) the film is just as timely now as it was in the 80s. I still have no idea, other than cynical $$, why a remake has to exist.\n\nI caught the tongue-in-cheek (ha! I see what I did there?) joke in the series Hannibal about \"avid fan\" and was delighted to see that my memory hadn't failed me in Manhunter. I loved that movie and am vindicated. Great film.\n\nThis, Hannibal, is a ground breaking series when it comes to \"high art\". Too bad it alienates a larger spectrum of audience because of the \"literal overkill\". (I am not a show-runner but, man, a murder a season would be quite sufficient, imo. Establish that the Chesapeake Ripper is a serial killer and then tone the body parts back a bit. Subtlety is Hannibal's arena -- try imposing some of that on the series and it might benefit.)"
