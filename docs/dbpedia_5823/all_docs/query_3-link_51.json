        "text": "The Silence of the Lambs is a great book that is based on the theme of power. The reasons why I appreciate this book is the following: the witty ways the author starts his chapters, the mind games, and at last the original topics.\n\nSomething you do not see a lot in novels is a point of view based on the first name that pops up at the beginning of a chapter. Thomas Harris would start every chapter with “Clarice” or “Hannibal” indicating to his audience through who’s eyes we would be reading the following chapter. It gives various opinions to the audience that they would not have got through the eyes of only one character.\n\nIn addition, a lot of mind games are being done in the book. By mind games I mean how every character has a plan and a goal in their head that they are trying to execute. Hannibal manipulates everyone because he wants to be free. Clarice will investigate by herself to try and get the recognition she thinks she deserves. Jack Crawford wants to catch Buffalo Bill in any means necessary, which is why he got Clarice to talk to Hannibal. They all use and manipulate each other to get what they want, which I find very interesting because it cannot be easy for an author to find ways to use all the characters in that way.\n\nAt last, cannibalism is an original topic which is common in gothic literature, but Thomas Harris uses it throughout the whole book and makes it the central topic. His originality is amazing and one of which you would not see in every typical thriller novels.\n\nWhat was your book appreciation of The Silence of the Lambs? Write what you thought in the comment section below.\n\nTristan\n\nIn today’s blog, I am going to present the multiple characters of the famous book of Thomas Harris, in a short and precise way, so that you can situate yourself while you read it.\n\nHere you go:\n\n(Dr.) Hannibal Lecter – Main Character:\n\nVery important character of the book, he is at the same time a helper and a killer. He is an ex-psychiatrist, a cannibal and most importantly a serial killer with nothing to lose. He likes to play with people’s mind and he is a true gentleman. He possesses very important information concerning the Buffalo Bill case.\n\nClarice Starling – Main Character:\n\nThe main character of the book, she is a wonderful mix of strength and determination. She is an FBI trainee on the come up trying to solve a case about a weird killer (Buffalo Bill).\n\nBuffalo Bill or Jame Gump– Main Character:\n\nThe main antagonist of the book, he is a weird and mad character who desperately wants to be a woman, to become a woman. Although, being unable to apply for a genital reconstruction surgery he decided to start killing women to skin them and to design his own women suit. Pretty deranged, although organized and structured.\n\nJack Crawford – Main Character:\n\nA key character in the book, he is the FBI agent who is in charge of Clarice Starling and he leads the operations on the case of Buffalo Bill. He acts as a mentor for Clarice and he has a sick wife, which he takes care of, at home with the help of nurses.\n\n(Dr.) Frederick Chilton – Main Character:\n\nHe is a somewhat important character for the book as he is the administrator of the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane and he is the one who allows Clarice to meet and talk with Hannibal in order to get precious information which only Hannibal detain.\n\nPaul Krendler – Secondary Character:\n\nHe is the Deputy Assistant Attorney General from the United States Justice Department. He is introduced to Clarice by the senator Ruth Martin at some point in the book.\n\nBarney Matthews – Secondary Character:\n\nHe is the Head orderly or healthcare assistant of the maximum-security wing at the Hospital for the Criminally Insane held by Dr. Frederick Chilton.\n\nSenator Ruth Martin – Secondary Character:\n\nShe is a senator in Tennessee and the mother of the last victim of Buffalo Bill, meaning Catherine Martin. She does all that she can to find her girl.\n\nCatherine Martin – Secondary Character:\n\nLast victim of Jame Gump or Buffalo Bill and daugther of Senator Ruth Martin.\n\nJ. Miggs – Secondary Character:\n\nHe is an inmate at the Hospital of the Criminally Insane, held by Dr. Chilton. He is the next neighbor to Hannibal’s cell. He is highly disturbing, and he doesn’t please Hannibal as he is no gentleman. He is nicknamed Multiple Miggs.\n\nArdelia Mapp – Secondary Character:\n\nShe is the best friend and at the same time, a partner of the FBI trainee Clarice Starling.\n\nNoble Pilcher and Albert Roden – Secondary Characters:\n\nThey are the insects experts which Clarice contact at some point to advance in the case.\n\nDonovan\n\nOn today’s blog post, I want to talk specifically about the insect found in The Silence of the Lambs, more precisely about some very special butterflies. Those butterflies are called the Death’s-Head Hawkmoth and are looking just like this:\n\nThey are called Death’s-Head Hawkmoth, mainly because of their appearance as they ornate a scary human skull shape on their thorax. There are three species of those butterfly’s type and they all can emit a loud chirp if they are annoyed or in danger. They simply produce this sound by expelling and inhaling air. The special ability of those butterflies could be linked to when Buffalo Bill is detaining his victims and they scream and beg for their lives as they are about to die. We could even relate the fact that he puts those insects in the throat of his victims to perpetuate the screams of his victims after their deaths.\n\nNow comes the question that follows: What is the main symbolic of this butterfly? Well, in brief, this insect represents the life-cycle of the main characters illustrated in the book, meaning Clarice Starling, Hannibal Lecter, and Buffalo Bill. Indeed, the butterfly life can be illustrated with three simple phases. The first phase being the larva, the second being the chrysalis and the last being the moth’s final form. These phases are a representation of the development of Clarice as she started as a FBI trainee and she then developed into a complete FBI agent, after closing the case of Buffalo Bill. If we look at Hannibal we can see that he sorts of develops through the whole book as a man of respect and “principles”. In brief, because of his encounter with Clarice, he developed some principles and some respect, and he is not, at the end of the book, a mere murderer without any rules of act, he still acts out of pleasure, although he puts more thought into it. The phases could also apply to Buffalo Bill or Jame Gump who is consistently searching to become or to be known as a woman. All the way through the end of the book he is working on his transformation into a woman-like figure and he does so by adding pieces of skin to his suit. Victims after victims, he comes closer to his final form, like the moth at the last phase.\n\nHere is a little video taken from YouTube, which shows many insect scenes from the movie The Silence of the Lambs, for those of you who are interested:\n\nDonovan\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death’s-head_hawkmothhttp://silenceofthemoths.weebly.com/symbolism.html\n\nThomas Harris’ The Silence of the Lambs is a horror novel with great characters. In fact, one of the reasons why I like this novel is because each chara cter has a completely different personality. Starling is a feminist strong woman, Crawford is a powerful FBI agent, Hannibal Lecter is a cannibal and Buffalo Bill is a transsexual murderer. I’m truly sorry to say this but Hannibal Lecter is definitely my favorite character. Not that I agree with his terrible cannibalistic actions as a free man! I just love his intelligence and the way he controls information as he wants. Thomas Harris must be a brilliant man to actually create such a bright person. As demonstrated in my blog post “My Favorite Passage of The Silence of the Lambs,” Dr. Lecter is willing to give information to Starling as long as she talks to him about her past. In this passage, we can see that he knows Starling’s answer before she even answers them, which is incredible. So no, I do not encourage his actions, but I am completely fascinated by his way of expressing himself and by his high level of intelligence.\n\nAlso, I like the way Buffalo Bill is first introduced in the novel: “In the shower was Jame Gump, white male, six feet one inch, 205 pounds, brown and blue, no distinguishing marks. He pronounces his first like James without the s. Jame. He insists on it” (Harris 135). He is presented as a simple and normal guy with the usual characteristics of a human being. The reader does not even know until the end of this chapter (20) that Jame Gump is Buffalo Bill, which I believe is very interesting. It seems like the author wants us to see the human and decent side of his personality before we associate him to a murderer. When reading this chapter, I personally felt some sort of attachment with Gump as he takes very good care of his dog. A feeling that somehow goes away as the story goes on…\n\nHowever, even though I like this novel for the characters, there are still some aspects of the book I dislike. The Silence of the Lambs is a very good horror novel, but I believe that the beginning of the story focuses too many investigations and lacks horrific elements to attract the reader’s attention. Although there are some interesting passages such as the first time Starling meets Dr. Lecter and when she finds a human head in a car, there are still a lot of explanatory passages with descriptions, which I don’t really like. I personally think that the story becomes way more interesting when Catherine Baker Martin gets kidnapped.\n\nDon’t be afraid to write in the comments whether you agree with me or not! It will be my pleasure to have a discussion with you on this matter.\n\nGabrielle\n\nSource: Harris, T. The Silence of the Lambs. St. Martin’s Paperbacks, 1989, p. 135.\n\nCannibalism is the act of a human beingeating another human’s flesh. As well, it can be the act of an animal eating another animal of the same kind. In the case of The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal Lecter was captured and put in the Baltimore State Mental Hospital for the Criminally Insane, because he was caught killing humans and eating them afterward.\n\nCannibalism has existed for a long time and it still does in some countries. Most people think cannibalism is gross and they prefer to avoid this topic, but not anthropologists. They are fascinated by cannibalism and they are constantly trying to find the reason why humans decide to eat other human beings. They first thought that tribes during the Paleolithic period would eat human flesh as a survival method, for the calories the human body can provide. However, they discovered that the calories in a human body are not high enough to last a whole day for an entire tribe. In fact, no human body would be sufficient for three meals. This means that the reason for humans eating other humans is not to survive, but something else.\n\nAnother hypothesis is that after murdering someone, it takes less space if the killer eats the flesh than leaving it all there. Anthropologists and scientists have not expended on this theory yet, but they say that we will never know the real reason why cannibalism exists and what goes on in the heads of cannibals.\n\nIn The Silence of the Lambs, there are no reasons explaining why Hannibal Lecter is a cannibal. The only deduction we can make is from the fact that Dr. Lecter eats humans because he believes it tastes and smells good.\n\nWhat do you think the reason for eating human flesh is? What about Hannibal Lecter’s reasons?\n\nReferences:\n\nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cannibalism\n\nhttp://time.com/4728703/cannibalism-calories/\n\nCatherine\n\nHannibal Lecter is well known and has a powerful presence in the book. Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who copies his crimes, wants to be the same as Hannibal Lecter. From reading the book, we know that Hannibal’s intellectual abilities are exceptional. For example, the examination he does of his victims before committing a crime and the mental power he uses to choose his victims is fascinating. Power is often seen in politics, on a political level or in sports on a physical level.\n\nIn the Silence of the Lambs we see many types of power, that are connected to FBI trainee Clarice Starling. In fact, Jack Crawford uses his power as head of the Behavioural Science department at the FBI to use Clarice Starling to get information out of Hannibal Lecter. The FBI agent quickly realized that not only is Clarice Starling a young and good-looking trainee, she is also very wise. Jack Crawford uses her in a case where she is split between working for him or going to the academy. Crawford’s power is used to catch serial killers, but at the same time he uses Clarice Starling so much and so hard that she must miss a lot of school time to make sure she follows the investigation.\n\nFor Hannibal, I’d like to start off with a quote: “A census taker tried to quantify me once. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a big Amarone. Go back to school, little Starling” (Harris, p.24). Hannibal Lecter has a different type of power than Jack Crawford. He knows that the FBI wants to examine him and get information, which he has, about the Buffalo Bill case. He leads them to believe that he will talk on certain, specific terms, but instead, he lies to the FBI and he gives them wrongful information about the case. The thing this prisoner wants the most is attention from the outside world.\n\nHannibal Lecter will never give the FBI exactly what they want because he knows that afterward, he will be useless. The quote is interesting for me because Thomas Harris’s choices of words is precise. In other words, they mean that treating officer Starling as a child makes her want to prove to Hannibal Lecter that she is as capable as anyone else of solving the case. Hannibal Lecter’s intellectual power is what is entertaining about this book for me. He is able to manipulate people in extreme ways. For example, as a revenge for what Miggs told Clarice Starling during her first visit, he convinced him, with only the power of his words, to swallow his own tongue, which was followed by his death.\n\nTristan\n\nHannibal Lecter is a gentleman, but not the type of gentleman we see on tv. His first encounter with Clarice Starling is nothing less than an intellectual analysis of one another. When Clarice went at the Institute for the first time, Miggs, another patient, insulted her with a sexual comment. Being a gentleman, Dr Lecter convinces Miggs to swallow his own tongue, which led to his death. Not only is Hannibal Lecter a gentleman, but he also is a man with great power. Since he is in prison for the rest life, he has nothing to gain from helping the FBI finding Buffalo Bill. This begs the question: Why does he help? It’s simple really. He is a highly intelligent individual who likes to play with people’s mind, which explains his decision to help the FBI, a very powerful organization. Even though he was aware of Buffalo Bill’s identity from the start, he is reluctant to give this information away, as he is very much aware of the attention this kind of information brings him.\n\nHannibal has a way with people that tend to fall in his favor. At the end of the book, we see the difference between an intelligent mind and a dangerous one. Buffalo Bill is not nearly as brilliant as Hannibal, as he merely copycats his crimes. One does not need to possess a high level of intelligence to copy someone’s actions, but it takes a truly sick and twisted mind to commit such crimes. Buffalo bill gets shot at the end, whereas Hannibal does not get caught. Therefore, the madman gets killed and the highly intelligent but psychopathic character gets away, which makes Hannibal Lecter the most interesting character in my opinion. He controls people recklessly knowing that events will unfold exactly as he planned. Hannibal Lecter is a powerful gentleman.\n\nTristan\n\nDo you think that at a certain point, madness could be interpreted as a genius? I do, and I will show you how with the very interesting character of Hannibal the Cannibal or Hannibal Lecter from his original name. In fact, he is somewhat a very interesting, but also a very complex character. He could even be considered as somewhat of a genius if we consider some of the following key elements:\n\nHe manipulates people with prowess. Indeed, he controls a lot of people as if they were mere dogs running after a bone. Probably, because of his past experiences as a psychologist, where he gained a lot of knowledge about people’s behavior and thoughts.\n\nNot only does he control people, but he controls information and uses it very well, in a way to have the upper hand on people. He also gets what he wants by controlling information. Throughout the whole book, he possesses the key to resolve the case of Buffalo Bill and that is how he gains power.\n\nHe always manages to escape, to get free, even though he is highly watched and in secured buildings. Showing the skills and determination of this character. He is somewhat always able to bypass or evade his fate, which is sealed to life imprisonment. Everything seems to be planned and schemed in his head beforehand.\n\nI cannot say that this man is completely crazy, can you? He is somewhat of a mastermind, isn’t he? As a result, I wouldn’t dare call him a total madman, because he has some clear skills and abilities that make him very brilliant and strategic. I would even consider him as a genius to some extent for sure. Don’t hesitate to comment below as to whether you think this man deserves to be called a madman or a genius!\n\nDonovan"
