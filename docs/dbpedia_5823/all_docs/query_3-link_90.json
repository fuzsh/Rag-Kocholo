        "text": "When messing about in your kitchen, few things are as satisfying as an accidental discovery ‒ like figuring out that black pepper on strawberries is delicious, that potato chips taste great in vanilla pudding, or that drizzling honey on pepperoni pizza makes for a sweet and savory taste sensation.\n\nNow let’s say you’re a fan of Stephen King and his eerie novels. Maybe you can’t get enough of the TV show “Bob’s Burgers.” Or possibly your go-to movie is something like “Clueless.” Or “The Godfather.” Or “Star Wars.”\n\nWell, imagine what might happen if you blended the immersive pleasures of your favorite fictional worlds with the real-life art of cooking. Thanks to such recipe-packed offerings as “Castle Rock Kitchen,” “The Bob’s Burgers Burger Book,” “The Corleone Family Cookbook” and “Galactic Baking: The Official Cookbook of Sweet and Savory Treats from Tatooine, Hoth and Beyond,” you can, in fact, have your fantasy and eat it too.\n\nCookbooks based on pop cultural properties might not be taken all that seriously in the high-standards world of culinary publishing. But the truth is that many are incredibly popular ‒ and not just as an ironic joke or a gag-gift.\n\nYes, one could easily presume that a cynical spirit of artless profiteering is behind something like “Feeding Hannibal: A Connoisseur’s Cook” or “Outlander Kitchen: To the New World and Back Again,” both based on bestselling books and the television shows they inspired. But to quote the Reduced Shakespeare Company comedy troupe when describing the classic comedies of William Shakespeare, “Some of them are hardly crap at all.”\n\nIt’s true. The surprise ingredient in many of these cookbooks is a genuine love of food, along with a dedicated appreciation for the source material on which they are based.\n\n“Sure, some of them are throwaway cash grabs,” agreed Matt Henry, a bookseller at Copperfield’s in Petaluma, where a large cookbook section always includes at least one shelf dedicated to cookbooks based on fictional properties. “But there are quite a few that are really good, that someone obviously put a lot of thought and care and love into.”\n\nIn “Castle Rock Kitchen,” for example, one finds a lot more than just recipes named after Stephen King characters. The bestselling cookbook, written by Theresa Carle-Sanders (who also writes the aforementioned “Outlander Kitchen” books), is presented as a collection of recipes assembled by Mrs. Garraty.\n\nThe mother of Ray Garraty, the Maine-born protagonist of the first novel King ever wrote, “The Long Walk” (published in 1979 under the pseudonym Richard Bachman), she’s a mostly forgotten character who turns out to be the perfect fictional figure to pull together recipes from various fictional towns in Maine, from Derry to Castle Rock.\n\nShe even includes a recipe for the cookies she gives her son at the beginning of the book she first appears in.\n\nSimilarly, “The Sopranos Family Cookbook,” written by Allen Rucker and Michele Scicolone, includes the prominent subtitle, “As Compiled by Artie Bucco.” In the long-running series, Artie was the co-owner and head chef of a restaurant called Nuovo Vesuvio, which appears often in the show. The book is written from Artie’s perspective, allowing fans to cook up some Calamari Ripieni or Osso Buco a la Bucco while imagining that Tony is coming over soon to talk during a nice Italian dinner and you do not want to disappoint him.\n\n“’The Sopranos’ cookbook is a fantastic cookbook,” Henry said. “It’s really well done, with real recipes that are great. And the ‘Bob’s Burger’ cookbook, that one is also excellent, with some great burger recipes in it. That one came out about five years ago, and we’ve had no problem keeping it in stock the entire time. They’re super fun, these cookbooks.”\n\nAnother title that Henry says surpassed his expectations is “The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Pizza Cookbook,” by Peggy Paul Casella.\n\n“It is surprisingly good,” Henry said. “It has a lot of pizza recipes in it, obviously, but there are other fun things. It’s got a recipe for pizza pot stickers. I love the turtles, but as a source of food suggestions, they wouldn’t be my go-to. But I was going through some of the books with one of my co-worker’s kids, and when we got to that one, her kid got so excited looking at it. And it turns out to be a solid cookbook.”\n\nSuch books, especially when the inspiration is a cartoon, comic book or video game, can be a great way to introduce children to the pleasures of cooking.\n\n“Some of the super cartoony cookbooks are absolutely perfect for getting kids excited about following a recipe,” he agreed, pointing out that to some kids, the recipes in traditional cookbooks often just look like another type of homework.\n\nIn something like “One Piece: Pirate Recipes” (VIZ Media LLC, 2021), based on the phenomenal manga books and the hit anime show, the pirate chef Sanji gives easy-to-follow instructions for things like Ganfor’s Pumpkin Juice, Treasure Splitting Sandwiches and “Meat on the Bone” (basically a Scotch egg made with chicken). Each recipe features mouth-watering photographs, amusing cartoons and piratical commentary written in the margins.\n\nThis book and others like it have proven to be strong sellers, especially as birthday presents or holiday gifts.\n\n“Movies, cartoons and video games are having this crazy renaissance of cookbooks right now,” Henry said. “There’s even a ‘Streetfighter’ cookbook, which I got for the store, and in that one it’s organized by each game character’s favorite food. That’s hilarious. Looking through that book, I was thinking, at first, ‘Well, this is fun,’ and then I started getting hungry, thinking, ‘There’s some good stuff in here.’”\n\nWhat it all comes down to, he has found, is approaching cooking with a sense of fun, a bit of playful irreverence and lots of imagination.\n\n“Our bestselling book is Mike Slater’s ‘NecroNomNomNom: Recipes and Rites from the Lore of H.P. Lovecraft,’” said Ross E. Lockhart, owner of Petaluma’s Word Horde Emporium of the Weird and Fantastic. “It’s a fun take on eldritch culinary madness, complete with sanity-warping illustrations.”\n\nLockhart is also a fan of Robert Tuesley Anderson’s “Recipes from the Worlds of Tolkien: Inspired by the Legends.” From that particular cook book, which includes Middle Earth food and some outrageous alcoholic concoctions, his favorite is “The Orc Draught.”\n\n“It’s a winter warmer made with cider, whiskey, orange honey and cinnamon,” he said. “It’s quite dangerous.”\n\nThat may be the best defense of cookbooks inspired by pop culture. It doesn’t matter where a recipe comes from, as long as it tastes good.\n\nAnd is maybe just a little bit dangerous."
