        "text": "Indeed he did. Benjamin Raspail was the man whose severed head was found by Clarice in the locked storage garage in the beginning of Das Schweigen der LÃ¤mmer (1991). In that movie, Hannibal Lecter later identifies the head as belonging to Raspail, but claims not to have killed him; he merely admits to have found Raspail's remains after he missed several appointments, and simply hid them. Lecter claims that Raspail was killed by his (Raspail's) lover, who is the same person as Buffalo Bill.\n\nHowever, during the conversation between Clarice and Paul Krendler in the archives in Hannibal, Clarice casually mentions that Hannibal once killed Benjamin Raspail in order to improve the quality of the orchestra Raspail played in, since he was such a dreadful player. This claim seems to be confirmed in the opening scene of Roter Drache (2002), where Lecter feeds parts of a flautist's corpse to the unwitting members of the orchestra board, though this flautist is never mentioned by name in either the film or the credits.\n\nIn the novels Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, the events are told a bit differently. The head that Clarice finds in the storage locker belonged to Raspail's boyfriend Klaus. Klaus was actually killed and beheaded by a jealous Jame Gumb/Buffalo Bill, who was once Raspail's lover. Raspail found Klaus' head, kept it in his garage and told his psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter, about it. Raspail went missing shortly thereafter, and his body found a few days later, missing its pancreas and thymus. Hannibal was caught several days later, and found to be the so-called Chesapeake Ripper, who had already made nine victims. During his trial, Hannibal admitted to feeding Raspail's organs to the orchestra board.\n\nIn the movie adaptation of Silence of the Lambs, most of this information was not used or changed. Most references to the Red Dragon novel (including Will Graham's earlier interaction with Lecter) were purposely removed to make Silence a stand-alone movie, and possibly to avoid legal issues (since the studio did not own the rights to the Red Dragon novel or its first adaptation, Manhunter - Roter Drache (1986)). The character of Klaus was omitted completely, perhaps to avoid introducing characters that had no significant role in the plot. However, since Clarice finding a severed head was so central in the progress of the plot, this was kept in; however, the victim was changed from Klaus to Raspail, and was explicitly established as Gumb's very first kill (in the book, Gumb had already killed his grandparents at age 10).\n\nFrom what we can tell, the movies Hannibal and Red Dragon followed the continuity established in the books, so this seems like a deliberate retcon without a clear in-universe explanation. One possibility could be that Hannibal is still playing a game with Clarice in Silence of the Lambs, by providing her with false information, to see how quickly she can see through his lies. Note that Hannibal did the same with her when he told her to look for \"Hester Mofet\" (an anagram for \"the rest of me\") and with Senator Martin, providing her with a false name of the killer, as his way to toy with people."
