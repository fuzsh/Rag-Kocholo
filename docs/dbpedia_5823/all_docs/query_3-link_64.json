        "text": "Let’s now jump to the primary focus of our interview. I’m an author and I believe that books have the power to change lives. Can you please tell our readers about “The Book That Changed Your Life”? Can you share a story about how it impacted you?\n\nYes, it’s hard to pick just one. But I’m going with Hannibal and Me by Andreas Kluth. This isn’t about Hannibal Lecter from the movie, Silence of the Lambs, but rather Hannibal the great Carthaginian general who famously led elephants over the Alps to attack Rome. This book is about success and failure and the various definitions of the two; it’s about the different paths people take with their lives and how it shapes them and prepares them for leadership and big moments. Hannibal is the backdrop for this book. It weaves in stories from other influential figures such as Harry Truman, Eleanor Roosevelt, Meriwether Lewis (of Lewis and Clark), Tiger Woods and more.\n\nOne of the things the book talks about is the comparison between those who know exactly what they want from a young age and those who don’t. In the case of Hannibal, he had a very clear vision of what he wanted from the time he was born. It came from his father who wanted to exact revenge upon Rome. Everything in young Hannibal’s life was pointed towards that — his talents, plans, and preparations. And it was more than just a goal, it was a “heroic quest.” This focus was all-consuming. These kinds of people are “dreamers.”\n\nBy contrast, there are those who wander and search for their call and what we might refer to as “late bloomers.” Harry Truman is presented as an example of this type of person. Harry did all sorts of things before he became President of the United States — notably, he was a failed haberdasher. These people are “wanderers.”\n\nThis concept resonated with me because, throughout most of my early career, I’d thought of myself as someone still trying to figure out “what I wanted to be when I grow up.” This caused a lot of anxiety and angst. I thought I needed to have the answer to that, so I could drive all my energy toward it otherwise it was just a waste of time. This book helped alleviate that fear in a fundamental way.\n\nThe book does a beautiful job of laying out the different elements and “pros and cons” of each path, saying neither one is better than the other per se. However, it’s important and insightful to know which leader you’re dealing with; it changes how they, together with their leadership style, will evolve and what phases they’ll typically go through.\n\nWhat was the moment or series of events that made you decide that you wanted to take a specific course of action based on the inspiration from the book? Can you share a story about that?\n\nIt was when Hannibal had to reexamine his strategy in war and life. Was Hannibal winning the right battles, or were his triumphs imposters? Should he have done something other than take his army over the Alps to invade Italy? Now that he was there, what should he do next?\n\nHannibal’s Greek tutor, Sosylus, says, “Hannibal, I have a much bigger question for you: What do you want from this war?… I know you intend to win…but then what? What sort of peace do you want?”\n\nHannibal replies “I want revenge, Sosylus, and I want justice for what they did to my father and Carthage in the last war.”\n\n“Yes, but what does justice look like? Will you declare victory if Rome gives Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica back to Carthage? If Rome cedes Iberia to Carthage forever? Would you demand, as the Romans demanded of Carthage last time, that they destroy their fleet? I’m asking — I am demanding — that you define success, strategos.”\n\nStrategos was the Greek word for general. A general must have the right strategy and the right tactics.\n\nWinning is not the same as success. I love to “win.” I grew up playing sports and winning is a clear-cut, all-or-nothing thing. But in a company, in politics, and in life you need to define success — if I “win,” okay great, what am I winning? If I climb this ladder, what’s at the top? Do I have my ladder up against the right wall?\n\nThis made me question my motives and where I was pointing my life, career, and energy towards. It’s a healthy exercise. I now do it on a regular basis and make little course corrections or refinements as needed. What am I going after and why? What do I intend to do with it when I get it? Define the appropriate strategy and tactics to be employed and make sure the two are aligned. It helps me feel good about what I’m doing — more settled and more grounded."
