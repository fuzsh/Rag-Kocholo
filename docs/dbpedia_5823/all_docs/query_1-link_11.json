The series has since expanded into film and television, having four timeline-connected franchise films produced by Dino De Laurentiis Company: The Silence of the Lambs (1991), Hannibal (2001), Red Dragon (2002) and Hannibal Rising (2007), with three starring Anthony Hopkins.\n\nNovels\n\n[edit]\n\nRed Dragon (1981)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Red Dragon (novel)\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs (1988)\n\n[edit]\n\nHannibal (1999)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Hannibal (Harris novel)\n\nHannibal Rising (2006)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Hannibal Rising\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm U.S. release date Director(s) Screenwriter(s) Producer(s) Manhunter August 15, 1986 ( ) Michael Mann Richard A.
