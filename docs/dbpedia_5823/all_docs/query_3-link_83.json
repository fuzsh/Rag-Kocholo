        "text": "By Chris Johnson\n\n“To learn the origin of evil, you must go back to the beginning.” That was the tagline for the latest and final installment in the tale of Hannibal Lecter, “Red Dragon.” “Red Dragon” is actually, in chronological sense, the first chapter in the Lecter trilogy. This movie shows how Lecter was captured and how he helped the man who put him behind bars capture a diabolical serial killer known only as the Tooth Fairy. Before there was Clarice Starling, there was FBI profiler Will Graham.\n\nHowever, even though the book “Red Dragon” came out in 1981, the new Hannibal film wasn’t the first movie to display his beginnings. A 1986 film called “Manhunter” was based on the book “Red Dragon” by Thomas Harris (who went on to write the books “Silence of the Lambs” in 1988 and “Hannibal” in 1999). When we think of Hannibal Lecter, we think of the superb acting of Anthony Hopkins. This wasn’t always the case. Brian Cox, a veteran actor, played the role of the good doctor in a memorable performance, but sadly, his version is not up to par with Hopkins’ Lecter.\n\nThough “Manhunter” was a moderate success and a good thriller, the next film in the series didn’t come until 1990. It would prove to be an Academy Award winner. “The Silence of the Lambs” not only won the award for Best Picture, but was also a winner for Best Actor (Hopkins), Best Actress (Jodie Foster), Best Director (Jonathan Demme), and Best Screenplay (Ted Tally). Tally has also written the script for “Red Dragon.” “Lambs” introduced us to the Hopkins version of Lecter, but more importantly, to the FBI trainee who would become Lecter’s obsession, Special Agent Clarice Starling.\n\nSent to see Dr. Lecter for help with the serial killer known as Buffalo Bill, Lecter becomes fond of her as he toys with her memories, emotions, and overall psyche. He sees her strengths and realizes that she has a code of honor. Starling also sees that Hannibal has a sense of honor, twisted as it may be. Once he escapes from his stay in Memphis, Lecter phones Clarice at the end of the movie with these words: “I have no plans to call on you, Clarice. The world is much more interesting with you in it. So you take care now and try to extend me the same courtesy.” She replies, “You know I can’t make that promise.” He says, “I do wish we could chat longer, but I am having an old friend for dinner. Bye!”\n\nThat was it. Those last words would have to hold the public for a decade. When it was announced that Thomas Harris would finally release a sequel book to “Lambs,” it was without a doubt the most anticipated book in recent history. When it was released in June 1999, it received mixed reviews because of the ending….SPOILER….Lecter and Clarice become cannibal lovers….END SPOILER. There was good news for those who didn’t like the ending.\n\nA movie was announced that would reunite Hopkins and Foster, but at the last second, Foster left due to “creative differences.” Julianne Moore became the new Clarice Starling. “Hannibal” was released in theaters in February 2002 to one of the biggest openings in history. It was described as a “dark and romantic story of two characters whose love could never match up.” The movie is known for many things, but the most controversial was the infamous “dinner sequence.” The ending of the movie was completely different than the book, and here is a sample of the dialogue: “Tell me Clarice, would you ever say to me, ‘Stop, if you loved me, you’d stop?'” She says, “Not in a thousand years.” Lecter replies, “Not in a thousand years? That’s my girl.”\n\nThe history of Hannibal Lecter is a twisted story of love, death, and cuisine, but his impact on film history will never be forgotten. Moreso, we need to thank Anthony Hopkins for his three brilliant performances as the most diabolical killer to ever grace the silver screen. Though Hopkins says “Red Dragon” is the final appearance of Lecter, don’t be surprised if Hopkins changes his mind and pops up again, considering hs words at the end of “Hannibal.” “Well, I suppose it is okay; after all, my mother said it as I am sure your mother said, it is always important to try new things…” Let us hope Hopkins tries new things and then decides to return to an old friend."
