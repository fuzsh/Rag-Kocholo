        "text": "WANNA WATCH SOMETHING REALLY GOOD & PLENTY SCARY? HOLY MOLY this was an awesome movie!! Deliver Us From Evil just hit Netflix, and so I assumed it was a Netflix movie, and it rocked my horror world! Not the scariest movie ever (for me) but scary enough for me to love it! It had my attention right to the very end.\n\nWanna know what the best part is? It’s inspired by real life events, in a book (that very cop’s own stories).\n\n<— I heard about it by one of my Facebook friends, when she announced that the movie was on Netflix and based on her brother’s real-life experiences and his book (and that she herself had experienced some crazy stuff too – and is also featured in the book!). OMG IT’S A BOOK??? MINE!!! read more\n\nTalk To Me I’ve been looking for something super-scary, chill-me-to-the-bone to watch, and while I’ve been indulging in horror movie after horror movie, I haven’t quite found the one, yet.\n\nThat said, I DID really enjoy this one, recommended by my fellow scary-lover, R. Renee (that I rented on Prime).\n\nR. Renee: I also watched Talk To Me last week and it was fantastic. The Edith Piaf scene was genius! Maryse have you seen it yet?\n\nMaryse: I haven’t seen Talk To Me or even heard of it?? I’m going to look it up right now. 😀 Oh that TOTALLY sounds like my thing. I can’t WAIT!!! Thank you, R!!! read more\n\nCrazy Rich Asians <—- WITH ALL THE BUZZ about this one, it’s been on my TBR list (AND my to be watched list) list for awhile now. I one-clicked the book by by Kevin Kwan a year or so ago, and then Amazon told me that the movie was on an amazing rental-sale (for Prime Day/Prime month 😉 ), so I dove in!!!! AND OMG IT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY!!!!!! Absolutely stunning in all senses of the word.\n\nMaryse: I AM HITTING ALL of the awesome movies today!!! CRAZY RICH ASIANS is FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC!!!!!!!!!!! My heart is overflowing right now. MUST WATCH – the music is AMAZING too (or must read!!) read more\n\nI just watched The Will (on Passionflix)!! A book written by one of my favorites, Kristen Ashley turned into a real life movie, it was the perfect way to start a lazy Sunday morning. My favorite coffee ever (Cinnamon Twist by Angelinos) and a sweet Hallmark-ish/Lifetime-ish movie but with SUPER-STEAM!! OMG THAT LOCKER ROOM SCENE. That was intense.\n\nYou get what I’m hinting at. 😉\n\nP.S. The kicker (and what sets the tone for the movie as a whole, is that her grandmother pretty much willed everything to her… BUT ALSO!!!! Her grandmother willed HER to HIM – a strip club owner). GASP!!!!! And they don’t even know each other. Good times!! LOL! 😂 read more\n\nThe Girl With All the Gifts <— OMG I was DYING to read this. I one-clicked this book back October of 2015 (yep… for Halloween – what perfection! Especially when I read this chilling blurb):\n\nMelanie is a very special girl. Dr Caldwell calls her “our little genius.”\n\nEvery morning, Melanie waits in her cell to be collected for class. When they come for her, Sergeant keeps his gun pointing at her while two of his people strap her into the wheelchair. She thinks they don’t like her. She jokes that she won’t bite, but they don’t laugh.\n\nThe Girl With All the Gifts is a groundbreaking thriller, emotionally charged and gripping from beginning to end.\n\n*shudders*\n\nTalk about a blurb-jolt. THAT is what I’m talking about when I want to be enticed to read something. Short and sweet (er… not so sweet, in this case) but totally loaded in thrill-potential, and doesn’t really tell me anything other than… OMG I HAVE to find out what this means!!! read more"
