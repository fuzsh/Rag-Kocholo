        "text": "The age-old debate: book versus film. Some argue that a film can only partially capture the depth and nuance of a novel. Others find on-screen adaptations a delightful way to relive their favourite stories. We're bookworms here. And there's nothing quite like that feeling of stepping out of the cinema utterly satisfied. This comes from knowing the movie did the book justice.\n\nThis list celebrates those cinematic gems.

Nonetheless, the film captures the spirit of Chandler's prose. It does this with its witty dialogue and quirky characters. The Big Lebowski is a cult classic.
