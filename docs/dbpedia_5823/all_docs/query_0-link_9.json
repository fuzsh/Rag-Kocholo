        "text": "What do you find scarier–horror movie or horror books? No matter what your preferred medium for frights and jump scares, quality story trumps everything, and some of the best horror movies out there are based on books! We rounded up a list of great horror movies based on books–some classics, some new horror books–that should be on all horror fans’ radars. We left out Stephen King books and adaptations because let’s be real–it’s news when he writes a book that isn’tadapted. Note: When it comes to horror movies based on books, the genre tends to skew white and male. We hope that publishing and Hollywood can strive to be more inclusive going forward.\n\nGet ready to get scared!\n\nThe Bird Box, based on The Bird Box by Josh Malerman\n\nIn this Netflix movie, Mallory is a mother of two who has somehow managed to survive an apocalyptic event caused by a strange force that causes people to go insane and become suicidal.

This story is based on Malerman’s debut novel.\n\nAudition, based on Audition by Ryu Murakami\n\nAoyama is a widower who decides it’s time to begin dating again and to find the perfect woman, he holds a casting call for fake film so he can review resumés.

The movie was filmed in Japanese and is available with English subtitles, and the novel is available in English as well.\n\nThe Birds, based on the short story “The Birds” by Daphne du Maurier, collected in Don’t Look Now\n\nAlfred Hitchcock’s iconic movie is quite the departure from its source material, but both share a common theme: the unsettling notion of birds murderous birds. The film starts innocuously enough–a young woman goes to the country with a songbird, only to find that all of the birds in the sky begin turning on humans. It brings a whole new meaning to the phrase “a murder of crows.”\n\nFear Street, based on the Fear Street novels by R.L. Stine\n\nWho was an R.L. Stine fan as a kid? The chilling Fear Street novels are headed to the big screen in 2020, with the movie Fear Street. It’s set to be the first in a trilogy, and while we don’t know much about the movie beyond that it’s based on the books and follows a group of teens who find themselves caught up in a murder mystery that may come back to bite them, we’ve also heard the protagonists are two gay teens!\n\nPsycho, based on Psycho by Robert Bloch\n\nAnother Hitchcock classic based off of a book, Psycho is the chilling story of Norman Bates, the seemingly kind motel owner who watches after his mother.

Netflix updated the setting and tweaked the characters so that they are a family of four siblings haunted by the time they lived in Hill House as children before their mother’s untimely death. When their youngest sister dies, they are drawn back into Hill House’s thrall. Changeling by Victor LaValle is a horror novel about a man who is excited to start a family, until something strange begins happening to his wife and child.
