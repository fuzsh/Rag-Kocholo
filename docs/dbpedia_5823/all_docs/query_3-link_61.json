        "text": "Much print has been expended on attempting to identify “the real Hannibal Lecter”. Many a journalist has been set the task of finding the genuine serial killer on whom Thomas Harris’s character - as he appears, variously, in Red Dragon, The Silence Of The Lambs and Hannibal - might have been based. The author himself appears to have mentioned a Mexican doctor he interviewed in prison to one of his English publishers. To a librarian in Cleveland, Mississippi, Harris mentioned a local killer, William Coyner, as his inspiration. In 1934, Coyner escaped from an Indiana prison and went on a murder and cannibalism spree in Cleveland. When he was captured, 200 armed police guarded him; he went to the gallows. It seems likely that he would still have functioned as a bogeyman in the area 10 or 15 years later when Harris was a boy.\n\nWhen these searches for the “original Hannibal Lecter” have not prospered, reporters have been sent round the world to interview frankly unrelated murderers and, where possible, cannibals, as generic “real Hannibal Lecters”, including, most recently, 29-year-old Jason Ricketts from Caerphilly in South Wales who murdered and eviscerated a cellmate in Cardiff prison, mistaking his spleen for his heart. Anonymous early Britons have also been nominated. A cannibalised thigh bone was discovered in Gloucestershire, carbon-dated to the first century, prompting a forensic archaeologist at Bournemouth University, Professor Margaret Cox, to say “this is obviously an isolated case of aberrant behaviour, what you might call a British Hannibal Lecter”.\n\nIt’s all misguided. Hannibal Lecter not only lives in books, he came out of books too. He comes not from criminological research, unlike Harris’s other killers, nor from the annals of crime. The Hannibal Lecter stories have about the same connection to social reality as, say, the stories of Bluebeard or Dracula. Like these stories, they still have, of course, an acute psychological reality. Lecter’s antecedents are to be found in fable and fiction, not in hospitals and prison cells. He is a compound of evil. He is Satan and he is the Serpent. He is the Vampire.\n\nOne of Lecter’s most obvious fictional precursors is Sherlock Holmes and before him, therefore, Poe’s Dupin. Many of Lecter’s observations are pure Holmes in style, if not content. As he tells Clarice: “ ‘You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L’Air du Temps, but not today.’” On their next meeting, he detects a Band-Aid under her clothes.\n\nCompare Holmes on his first meeting with Watson in A Study In Scarlet: “’You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive.’ ‘How on earth did you know that?’ I asked in astonishment.’ “ When, at their next meeting, Holmes explains his deductions, the amazed Watson says, rightly enough, “You remind me of Edgar Allan Poe’s Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did exist outside of stories.”\n\nConan Doyle admitted that Poe had been his great influence: “Poe is the master of all. To him must be ascribed the monstrous progeny of writers on the detection of crime... Each may find some little development of his own, but his main art must trace back to those admirable stories of Monsieur Dupin, so wonderful in their masterful force, their reticence, their quick dramatic point. After all, mental acuteness is the one quality which can be ascribed to the ideal detective, and when that has once been admirably done, succeeding writers must necessarily be content for all time to follow in the same main track.” Unless, that is, the mental acuteness is ascribed not to a detective but to a criminal, tangentially engaged in the detection of other criminals. Here’s one straight line of descent for Hannibal Lecter: Professor Moriarty and Sherlock Holmes combining their talents.\n\nAnother bloodline passes through Bram Stoker’s Dracula. We learn in Hannibal that, like Dracula, Lecter is a central European aristocrat. His father, too, was a count and he believes himself to be descended from a 12th-century Tuscan named Bevisangue (blood-drinker). Like Dracula, Lecter drains his victims. After meeting him for the first time, Clarice Starling feels “suddenly empty, as though she had given blood”.\n\nLecter, like Dracula, has superhuman strength; he commands the beasts; and he lives in the night. Barney, the warder, tells Clarice on her second visit that Lecter is always awake at night, “even when his lights are off”. Many of his physical attributes resemble those of Dracula. “His cultured voice has a slight metallic rasp beneath it, possibly from disuse”, we are told in The Silence Of The Lambs. Dracula, says Stoker, speaks in a “harsh, metallic whisper”. Dracula’s eyes are red, Jonathan Harker realises when he first meets him, in the guise of a coachman. Later, when he sees Dracula with his female acolytes, he says: “The red light in them was lurid, as if the flames of hell-fire blazed behind them.” So too: “Dr Lecter’s eyes are maroon and they reflect the light in pinpoints of red. Sometimes the points of light seem to fly like sparks to his centre.”\n\nDracula has, of course, “peculiarly sharp white teeth”. Lecter’s teeth are noted but they’re pointedly not fangs, just “small white teeth”, although he too uses them to terrible effect - and, of course, consumes his victims. Dracula has a combination of “extraordinary pallor” and lips of “remarkable ruddiness”. Lecter, too, combines pallor and red lips: “The only colours in his cell were his hair and eyes and his red mouth, in a face so long out of the sun it leached into the surrounding whiteness...” There seems little doubt that Harris’s success in adding so dramatically to our stock of monsters drew on Bram Stoker’s earlier triumph in refining and perfecting the myth of the vampire.\n\nIn Hannibal, Harris tips the wink a little to Dracula. Much of the business of Dracula is taken up transporting the count’s boxes of soil from Transylvania to his properties in Essex and Piccadilly. Lecter’s home-making is more elaborate. Chapter 54 of Hannibal - the chapter which proclaims “Dr Lecter very much liked to shop” - begins: “It is an axiom of behavioural science that vampires are territorial, while cannibals range widely across the country. The nomadic existence held little appeal for Dr Lecter.” Setting aside the question of what behavioural science can say about imaginary monsters, it’s a nice nod to Lecter’s precursor. It may, however, just be a coincidence that among the insects Dracula sends in to his deranged acolyte Renfield in the asylum is “Acherontia atropos of the Sphinges - what we call the ‘Death’s-head Hawk Moth’,” the European version of the insect that alerts Clarice Starling to the identity of Jame Gumb, the second serial killer of The Silence Of The Lambs.\n\nLecter has taken on a fuller and more florid existence in each successive book. In Red Dragon, still only five- as opposed to six- fingered, he seems a relatively plain fellow, compared to the lifestyle fiend who emerges in Hannibal, bedecked too with a dizzying plurality of historical, genealogical and mythological attributes.\n\nThroughout Hannibal, he is, for example, Satan, the only other figure of evil who is wise as well as malevolent, who understands but does not sympathise. A Gypsy says so plainly: “That is the Devil... Shaitan, Son of the Morning, I’ve seen him now.” And there are many other teasing references\n\nThen again in Hannibal, Lecter is also the Beast, and Clarice is Beauty - only this time (in the book at least, if not the film) it is the Beast who changes Beauty, not Beauty the Beast. The story is explicitly raised when Lecter’s deformed victim, Mason Verger, asks Dr Doemling, the duff psychologist, what Lecter wants to do to Clarice: “Does he want to fuck her or kill her, or eat her, or what?” Doemling says probably all three, in whatever order. “No matter how the tabloids - and tabloid mentalities - might want to romanticise it, and try to make it Beauty and the Beast, his object is her degradation, her suffering and her death.”\n\nIn fact, Clarice’s time in Lecter’s care in his house on the Maryland shore is unmistakably modelled on La Belle et la B te, a tale by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont (1756). Beauty, like Clarice, is devoted to her father and that is why she goes to the Beast’s palace. The Beast cooks marvellously for her and she says to herself: “It’s clear that the Beast is providing such a lovely feast to fatten me up before eating me.”\n\nThe Beast prepares a magnificent room for her - what struck her most of all was a large library, a harpsichord and numerous books on music. “She hears an excellent concert”, just as Lecter plays the harpsichord to Clarice. But Beauty pines to see her father and the Beast arranges for her to do so in a mirror - just as Lecter arranges a spectral visitation from Clarice’s dead father. “Beauty,” the monster said to her, “would you mind if I watch you dine?” Just so, as Clarice eats Krendler’s brains, “Dr Lecter found the shine of butter sauce on her lip intensely moving.” Then, of course, the Beast asks Beauty to be his wife and she “nearly died of fright”. She’ll come round to the idea, as Starling does.\n\nWhen he allows her to make a visit to her father, the Beast supplies Beauty with “dresses trimmed with gold and diamonds”. Just so, Lecter dresses Clarice in “a long dinner gown” and gives her “earrings with pendant cabochon emeralds”. “Clarice Starling smiled at him then, the cabochons caught the firelight and the monster was lost in self-congratulation at his own exquisite taste and cunning.” Beauty releases the Beast from the spell he is under. Hannibal Lecter, however, puts Clarice under his spell. Reading these two stories together, there is no mistaking the path being followed. We are in Harris’s footsteps here.\n\nAnother of Lecter’s literary sources is a little trickier. The name and notion of Hannibal Lecter grew - at some level of consciousness, at some stage of development, perhaps the earliest - from Baudelaire’s great poem of preface to Les Fleurs du Mal, “Au Lecteur” (To The Reader).\n\nThere seems little doubt of this, although Harris, while trailing his coat about other writers, has been careful to avoid referring to those, such as Poe, Conan Doyle and Baudelaire, from whom he has taken most. Such a genealogy may sound fanciful for a thriller, but Harris is in fact a deeply literary writer. In an article which Harris wrote for a short-lived teen- magazine, “An Ideal English Class Syllabus for 9th Graders” - almost the only piece of writing outside his books he has done since finding fame - Harris says firmly: “Every day a poem in a foreign language.”\n\nBaudelaire published “Au Lecteur” in 1855 in the Revue des Deux Mondes and then placed it at the head of the first edition of Les Fleurs du Mal in June 1857. In this assault of a poem, Baudelaire declares himself to be writing only for those readers who resemble him. It begins in midstream, with a fiercely inclusive “we”:\n\nLa sottise, l’erreur, le péché, la lésine,\n\nOccupent nos esprits et travaillent nos corps,\n\nEt nous alimentons nos aimables remords,\n\nComme les mendiants nourissent leur vermine.\n\n[Stupidity, error, sin, and meanness possess our minds and work on our bodies, and we feed our fond remorse as beggars suckle their own lice.]\n\nAt once, the reader is recruited to horror. Instead of being carefully approached and seductively addressed, as would be normal in a poem of dedication, he has been made, before he knows it, to utter, alongside the poet, the most savage confession of sin. So the poem continues, making us declare ourselves captives of “Satan Trismégiste”:\n\nC’est le Diable qui tient les fils qui nous remuent!\n\nAux objets répugnants nous trouvons des appas;\n\nChaque jour vers l’Enfer nous descendons d’un pas,\n\nSans horreur, à travers des ténèbres qui puent.\n\n[It’s the Devil who pulls the strings that make us dance: we take delight in loathsome things; each day we take a further step to Hell, yet feel no horror as we descend through stinking gloom.]\n\nBaudelaire leads us past one loathsome thing to another. Eventually, we arrive at the vice that is worse than all the rest.\n\nMais parmi les chacals, les panthères, les lices,\n\nLes singes, les scorpions, les vautours, les serpents,\n\nLes monstres glapissants, hurlants, grognants, rampants,\n\nDans la ménagerie infme de nos vices,\n\nIl en est un plus laid, plus méchant, plus immonde!\n\nQuoiqu’il ne pousse ni grands gestes ni grands cris,\n\nIl ferait volontiers de la terre un débris\n\nEt dans un billement avalerait le monde;\n\nC’est l’Ennui! . . .\n\n[But among the jackals, panthers, bitch-hounds, monkeys, scorpions, vultures, snakes, and monsters that scream and howl and grunt and crawl in the sordid menagerie of our vices, there is one even uglier and more wicked and filthier than all the rest! He would happily reduce the earth to rubble and swallow the world in a yawn. “C’est l’Ennui!”]\n\nIt is boredom, taedium vitae , that drives all our sins.\n\nSuddenly, in his last two lines, Baudelaire drops the compelling “we” that has dominated the poem and turns on the reader with an intimate, uninvited second person singular, before offering to embrace him again:\n\nTu le connais, lecteur, ce monstre délicat,\n\n- Hypocrite lecteur, - mon semblable, - mon frère!\n\n[You know him, reader, that fastidious monster - you hypocritical reader - my similar - my brother!]\n\nHarris surely had these great lines in his mind when Lecter was first coalescing in his mind. It’s possible to see the whole phenomenon of Hannibal Lecter as a fantastic gloss on this poem and Les Fleurs du Mal as a whole.\n\nThe chime of “hypocrite lecteur” with Hannibal Lecter is obvious enough. Then again Lecter is precisely a fastidious monster; one who would gladly reduce the earth to ruin. On Lecter’s first appearance in Red Dragon (1981), he insists to FBI agent Will Graham “we’re just alike”, almost a translation of the poem’s climax.\n\nLecter’s a lecteur. He is a reader - and a quoter, and a writer. He lives in literature. Like the infant Thomas Harris, as described by his mother, he always has his nose in a book.\n\nLecter tests Clarice as a reader when, on their second meeting, he gives her the religious maniac Sammie’s poem on a piece of paper and she is made to perform a little practical criticism on it, noting the “verse changes” and the “management of rhyme”. When she sees him next, he’s reading his correspondence and holds up a finger for silence until he has finished.\n\nEven in his cell in the Memphis jailhouse, Lecter manages to have “a number of books” and finishes his page and marks his place, before speaking to Starling. “Dumas tells us that the addition of a crow to bouillon in the fall, when the crow has fattened on juniper berries, greatly improves the colour and flavour of stock. How do you like it in the soup, Clarice?”\n\nThen Lecter tells Starling: “I’ve read the cases, Clarice, have you? Everything you need to know to find him is right there.” All he really wants is for her to be a better reader. He ridicules Clarice’s FBI mentor, Jack Crawford, for a speech to the National Police Academy and says he “copies his philosophy out of Bartlett’s Familiar, I think. If he understood Marcus Aurelius, he might solve his case.” Clarice asks how and Lecter responds tartly: “When you show the odd flash of contextual intelligence, I forget your generation can’t read, Clarice.” (Again, the passage he refers to in Marcus Aurelius does exist, just as he says.)\n\nLecter also instructs the warder, Barney, on his reading, we may realise, when Clarice notices that “A paperback book was wrapped around Barney’s massive index finger as he held his place. It was Jane Austen’s Sense And Sensibility.” Later, in Hannibal, we learn that Lecter helped Barney with his correspondence courses and showed him Socrates and much else: “He showed me a whole world, literally, of stuff - Suetonius, Gibbon, all that.”\n\nGiven Lecter’s preparedness to share his reading thus, it is worth turning back to that reading list - “An Ideal English Class Syllabus for 9th Graders”. Harris ends this piece by suggesting we should take a look at the plaque that Nasa puts on the side of the deep-space probes to tell other beings what we are: “bilaterally symmetrical, sexually differentiated bipeds located on one of the outer spirals of the Milky Way, capable of recognising the prime numbers and moved by one extraordinary quality that lasts longer than all our other urges - curiosity.\n\n“Curiosity. All we can ever do is tickle one another’s curiosity, because there isn’t time to say much, and a lot of what we know to say may not be true.”\n\nCuriosity, then, is the opposite of ennui . It is the corrective that Harris, when speaking in his own voice, recommends to the boredom that breeds monsters. Harris has Lecter tilt his head when he asks a question, “as though he were screwing an augur of curiosity into your face”.\n\nBarney warns Dr Chilton, as he says goodbye to Lecter, that his new guards don’t know how to deal with him. “You think they’ll treat him right? You know how he is - you have to threaten him with boredom. That’s all he’s afraid of. Slapping him around’s no good.” But ennui is not just his fear - “Any rational society would either kill me or give me my books” - it’s his origin. Lecter himself uses his own boredom as a threat to others. When he is extracting the story of The Silence Of The Lambs from Clarice and she is not delivering what he wants, he says: “If you’re tired, we could talk toward the end of the week. I’m rather bored myself.”\n\nLecter is the face that looks back at us out of our own boredom. He is our monster, the evil we embrace for our diversion. And he feeds on us.\n\nIn Hannibal, this idea is made explicit in a manner distinctively reminiscent of the accusation embedded in “Au Lecteur”. Lecter attends the exhibition of Atrocious Torture Instruments but not to look at the exhibits. He faces the other way, back at the spectators, for his thrills. “The essence of the worst, the true asafoetida of the human spirit, is not found in the Iron Maiden or the whetted edge; Elemental Ugliness is found in the faces of the crowd,” the oracular narrative voice proclaims.\n\nFor his part, Lecter “is registering aspects of damnation from the avid faces of the voyeurs as they press around the torture instruments and press against each other in steamy, goggle-eyed frottage, hair rising on their forearms, breath hot on one another’s neck and cheeks”.\n\nJust so when Harris himself went to the FBI for his research, he was learning at least as much about the agents as about the criminals they were discussing. After The Silence Of The Lambs, there was much head-nodding when it was learned that Harris was attending the “Mostro” trial in Italy. When Hannibal appeared, it became clear that once again he had been looking more at the police than at the accused.\n\nHarris has made one direct statement on the record about his relationship to Lecter, in a video made for the sales staff of his publisher, aptly filmed in the extraordinary butterfly house at Syon Park near Heathrow in London. He called Lecter a friend and spoke of him as an independent presence. “He’s immensely amusing company. I work in this little office and I’m always glad when he shows up. He can be difficult company and I’m glad when he leaves too. People always ask me most about him, I can’t say where he came from. What he is, in the most general terms, is a worthy adversary. He is the adversary for anything like kindness and hope. He is not specifically modelled after anybody but I think if you look around the world, you can see plenty of sources where the darkness of Dr Lecter came from . . . he’s the dark side of the world. He’s probably the wickedest man I’ve ever heard of - at the same time he tells the truth and he says some things that I suppose we would all like to say. It’s his contention that the asylum is the only place in the world where free speech is practised. He may be right...”\n\nHarris also nicely pretended that Lecter was outside his control. “People ask me if he’s coming back but I don’t know. He doesn’t return my phone calls. He’s a man who has to amuse himself...”\n\nBut perhaps Thomas Harris “can’t say” where Lecter came from only in the sense that he can’t permit himself to say. Then again look: in the Acknowledgements to Hannibal, he has now said it: “The wickedness herein I took from my own stock.”\n\nThis is an edited extract from The Strange World Of Thomas Harris: Inside The Mind Of The Creator Of Hannibal Lecter, by David Sexton (Short Books, £4.99), published this week.
