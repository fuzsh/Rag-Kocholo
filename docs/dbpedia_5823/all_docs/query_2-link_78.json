        "text": "I can remember the last time television made me laugh, and the last time it made me cry. But I can’t remember the last time a scripted TV show scared me, and that worries me, because I like a good scare. So do I have hopes for the fall season, which brings the high-profile newcomers “Scream Queens” and “Ash vs. Evil Dead” along with returning fright fare like “American Horror Story”?\n\nNo, I do not.\n\nPart of this is just me. I’ve watched lots of horror movies and TV shows. But part of it is not just me. I’m getting the impression that TV creators aren’t trying very hard to scare anymore as much as they’re trying to make us laugh under the guise of scaring us. Exhibit A: “Scream Queens,” which begins Sept. 22 on Fox.\n\nThe series, about a sorority whose members have a tendency to be murdered, has a starry cast with some solid horror credentials, including Jamie Lee Curtis of the “Halloween” franchise. But it doesn’t seem particularly interested in atmosphere."
