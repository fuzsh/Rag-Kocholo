Patsy Gallant tells it like it is. It’s clear the Acadian singer doesn’t know how to approach life any other way.

We met in her apartment just around the corner from St. Joseph’s Oratory this week to talk about Patsy, a new documentary directed by seasoned Montreal filmmaker Robbie Hart, which will be screened at the Lion d’Or on Wednesday, Nov. 30 and at Théâtre Outremont on Sunday, Dec. 4. Gallant will also perform a few songs each night.

Our chat began with Gallant, one of the top pop stars in Quebec in the late ’70s, saying how all she could think after seeing the film for the first time was how bad she looked in it. Hart, who was sitting with us, quickly jumped in to remind Gallant that once she watched it a second time, she loved it. And in fact, Hart and I agreed she looks great in the film.

The voice behind hits like From New York to L.A. and Sugar Daddy still sounds great, too, as witnessed during our interview when Gallant jumped up on a couple of occasions to belt out lengthy sections of songs a cappella.

Once Gallant got over her unfounded worries about her looks, she admitted it was a great experience to work with Hart on this trip back through her life.

“It’s fun to look back on (my) career,” she said. “It’s extraordinary because it feels like three different lives. At the beginning I was hesitant, because I was saying: ‘Why would they want to do a documentary on my life? Get Céline Dion — she’s a lot more famous than me.’

“They told me: ‘It’s not about fame. It’s about who you are.’ And I said: ‘Give me a better reason why I should do it.’ And they said: ‘We think it’s going to touch people and inspire people.’

And I said: ‘Well, if you can do that, OK, I’m going (to do it).’ So I did. … It’s hard for me, because you don’t like to see yourself in a natural (setting).

Added Hart: “Documentary storytelling is meant to be told like (it is in) this film. Things happened that weren’t supposed to happen. There was a lot of improvised content. It takes on an authenticity. She trusted me and I trusted her.”

Patsy, produced by Sergeo Kirby of Montreal’s Loaded Pictures, really does chronicle different stories. Early on, Gallant says: “I’m not just the disco queen. I’m other things, too.” And she’s right.

The story begins with Les soeurs Gallant, a group Patsy joined at the age of three. There were 10 kids in the Gallant family, and their mother enlisted four of the sisters for the group, in a bid to bring some money into a household that was having a tough time making ends meet.

The four Gallant sisters started off performing in their home province of New Brunswick, and then headed to the big city — Montreal — when Patsy was just 10, playing sketchy venues on the Main and elsewhere.

Then came the pop stardom in the ’70s, first in French and later in English. In one of the odder wrinkles in Quebec’s music history, Gallant’s biggest international hit, From New York to L.A., was an anglo adaptation of Gilles Vigneault’s nationalist anthem Mon pays. She even had a national TV show in the late ’70s, the Patsy Gallant Show, on CTV.

“I didn’t open the door — I kicked it down,” said Gallant. “I wanted this so much. I love this so much. I didn’t hesitate. I just understood this was my calling from Day 1.”

But when disco crashed and burned, Gallant fell on hard times. Following a tough divorce, she moved with her young son to Paris, where she was given a second lease on life by ace Quebec songwriter Luc Plamondon. He cast her as Stella Spotlight in his hit musical Starmania, which ran at Théâtre Mogador in Paris from 1993 to 2001.

Gallant has since returned to live in Montreal, and she’s still very active. Last year she was part of La Tournée des Idoles, a tour featuring a slew of older Quebec artists that packed venues across the province. And she is set to perform Saturday, Dec. 3 in the Noël symphonique concert at Maison symphonique, featuring the Sinfonia de Lanaudière and singers Bruno Pelletier, Nadja and Paul Daraîche, among others.

“I feel very privileged and very lucky to still be working, singing and having my health,” said Gallant.

Her dream, as she recounts in the film, is to make a full album of her own compositions — something she has never done up until now — and that dream is set to become a reality. She has recorded three songs so far.

“I’ve waited a long time to do this, and I want to do it right,” said Gallant. “It could be my last album, or it could be the beginning of something. You never know. This is my baby.”

“To me, that was the clincher in terms of the film,” said Hart. “There’s the biography. You’re telling a story that took place. But the story of her own music, we’re on a journey here. She wants to accomplish something, so it’s something that’s moving forward.

“When I came here the first time and I heard one of the songs, I was blown away. These are important lyrics. To me, the line in the film (that hit me is): ‘Ma musique c’est le parcours de ma vie. It’s the road map of my life.’ And it is. The songs are about her son, about her family, about women. It’s about love, broken hearts. It’s beautiful.”
