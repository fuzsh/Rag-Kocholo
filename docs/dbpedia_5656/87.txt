About the Film

By bringing together urban dance—krump, hip hop, break, voguing, etc.—and opera singing, Bintou Dembélé and Clément Cogitore reinvent Jean-Philippe Rameau’s baroque masterpiece, Les Indes Galantes/Gallant Indies. From rehearsals to public performances, it is a human adventure and a meeting of political realities that we follow: can a new generation of artists storm the Bastille today?
