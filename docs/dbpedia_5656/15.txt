This charming animal fantasy has suspense, kid appeal, plenty of emotion, and charismatic animal characters. With all these elements, Babe: The Gallant Pig has earned the right to be compared favorably with the benchmark pig classic, Charlotte's Web. Babe is the underdog -- er, underpig -- who, through sheer sincerity and genuineness, defies the odds in this heartwarming, farmyard equivalent of a rags-to-riches tale. It's an action-packed, universal story of unlikely friendships and even unlikelier triumphs, of forgiveness, determination, and the power that results from believing in yourself. Even the most disrespectful characters are ultimately reformed by Babe's positive example, providing a subtle yet effective lesson in virtuous behavior that won't be lost on readers of any age.

Part of the book's immense charm comes from the portions of dialogue that reflect rural British speech. In addition to deciphering the richly authentic dialect, some young readers will need assistance defining terms such as "daft" and cultural references such as dialing 999 when an emergency occurs. But don't let this be a deterrent; the UK influence serves to enrich the cultural, behavioral, and language lessons this remarkable book provides.
