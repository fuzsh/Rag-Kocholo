        "text": "Humans all over the world developed mathematical methods and concepts in order to learn and solve problems about their families, their societies, their world and their universe. This process, while seen as the achievement of groups of people, mirrors many of the key factors individuals address in their own voyages of learning – curiosity and attention; creativity and intuition; exploration and problem solving, as well as the importance of sociality, collaboration and memory.\n\nIn this course we will trace some of these ideas, starting with an autobiography of our own experiences in this domain. We will look at similarities and differences in ways that people from a number of different parts of the world created notions of number and shape and how that helped them better understand and navigate – both figuratively and literally – their worlds.\n\nWe will investigate the relationships between an explanation, a justification and a proof; between observations, data and conclusions; and between an analogy, a mental model and a mathematical model. Exploring patterns and coding information, we will invent artificial languages and make music. We will see how humanity’s understanding of learning is being abstracted to machine learning, such as ChatGPT, and how information and data can be shared, and instructions given – in the form of recipes just as computer algorithms.\n\nThroughout, each student will be encouraged to reflect on their own learning experience – how do they learn? How can they adapt their learning style to different subjects? How can they apply the principles of curiosity, creativity, problem solving and collaboration to their own learning voyage?\n\nThe object of this course is the study of the different modes of representation of space, objects, nature, people through time and the world. Students will learn the essential modes of representation to express themselves, communicate or illustrate the world. These different skills will be acquired gradually, referring to the different modes of representation that will be relocated throughout history.\n\nStudents will address the essential issues of drawing such as the representation of the body, volume, space, movement and their use through practical exercises.\n\nWe will study different modes of representation and projection of the world used throughout the ages and civilizations. We will study different types of anatomy, different rules of representation and projection (different types of perspectives (axonometric, conical, spherical)). We will also study the different tools developed since Antiquity to facilitate these representations (drawing machines, camera obscura, pantographs etc ...). We will make reconstructions of these tools in class. Different rules of drawing (from different continents and different eras) will also be discussed and compared.\n\nHistory cannot be understood out of it´s social, political and economic context. Actually, most historical events that required decision making can be explained by the need or the use of resources (food or any other). Science explains how natural resources influence History represents a biological approach to these historical events, consistently tackling to proof that they are not independent from their environmental context.\n\nThis course´s schedule and outline are coordinated with its counterpart course Food, Drinks, and Drugs in World History taught by Professor Rosengarten (historian) and is focused on explaining the biological reasons why the historical events portrayed in her course happened.\n\nThe course is taught twice a week in two different ways: lectures structured over audiovisual content and flipped teaching, using the student´s findings to deepen into the different lectures.\n\nThe world of literature is often opposed to the world of economics, stressing imagination rather than reality, beauty rather than cost, subjective rather than objective realities. In this course, we will consider why it might be useful to challenge this opposition. Many great works of literature address the same themes and topics as economics – the place of money in our world, the experience of debt, the forces that organize our desires and constrain our freedoms. Economic texts – even when they are full of mathematics – tell stories and use images and metaphors. We will read foundational texts of economics (including work by Adam Smith and Karl Marx) alongside key literary texts from the past and the present in order to enrich and expand our understanding of historical and contemporary individual and social experience.\n\nThis course is an introduction to money, debt, and taxes. To examine money, debt, and taxes we adopt a historical analysis based on old and new economic texts, some well-known, others hardly at all. The kinds of questions you will be able to answer by the end of the course include: why does money, of all things, have the ability to exchange all goods? How does money help our economy function? What causes inflation? How can you just invent a new kind of money like a cryptocurrency? What is debt and what role does it play in society? Is debt good, bad or something else? When and why were taxes invented? How can taxes keep or not a society together?\n\nDavid Tresilian’s CL1099 course on Modern to Contemporary in the Arab World uses literature and film to introduce students to a region which is often poorly understood by outsiders. Providing sound foundations in twentieth-century literature from a range of Arab countries, the course brings students right up to the present. What is the situation in the Arab World, ten years after the uprisings of spring 2011? What are the current debates on identity and culture in the region? Where is cultural life at its most dynamic? How is this culture seen in the students’ home countries? The study of a diverse range of texts, films, and digital materials gives students a basis on which to reflect critically on these questions and use them as a basis for a final project.\n\nBringing together urban planning, architectural history and political geography, course ME1099 looks at cities in Western Asia and North Africa. It provides an overview of urban settlement in the Middle East from the beginnings of Islam to the eighteenth century, before focusing on the processes of urbanization in the region from 1800 until today. After looking at the specificities of the region’s cities we explore the interaction between rapid social change, political power and professional planning. Today, uprisings fuelled by demands for social equity and democracy, major conflict driven migrations and the needs of capital all mark cities in the Middle East and North Africa. Students will reflect on issues related to the management, planning and design of extensive city regions, historic centres and poorly serviced self-built areas. Essentially, this course is an introduction to the challenges facing cities located at the critical meeting point of Africa and Eurasia.\n\nHuman migration has shaped the fabrics of the modern world: not only racial conflicts that caused violence and slavery, but also the fine touches we put on our accent, dress and diet to blend in; not only heated congressional debates on whether refugees deserve a spot in “our” society, but also the joy and frustration we experience when navigating a European capital city. How to make sense of our mobile life, treat others with kindness, and address pressing sociopolitical challenges brought by human migration? In this course, we examine how human migration takes place within social, cultural, and political contexts. To showcase the breadth of the field, this course scales up topics from individual experience (such as what objects one brings during studying abroad to maintain a sense of home) to social relations (such as how “White Muslims” negotiate their identity in front of racial/religious others), to national governance (such as the exclusive role of national border and the perils involved in its crossing), and to global affairs (such as how American white couples rent Indian wombs to bear children for them). These topics are informed by major theoretical schools, including the Marxist class paradigm that addresses labor and material condition, symbolic interactionism that articulates how we perform identity work by telling stories, and social constructionism that questions the status quo. At the practical level, this course introduces a range of interdisciplinary methods including quantitative research, autobiography, ethnography, discourse analysis, narrative analysis, policy research, and intersectional analysis.\n\nCultural diversity describes the variety of human experiences based on different cultures. This term is used in many parts of our lives including educational contexts, organizations and businesses, the art world, or political discourses and policy making. In this course, we will explore the social, political, and historical aspects of cultural diversity and difference. Through an interdisciplinary social science lens, we will examine the following questions: How do we experience and understand cultural diversity and difference? How do diversity and differences shape and are shaped by systems that affect individuals, families, communities, and society? How do notions of cultural diversity and difference contribute to practices of exclusions or social transformation and empowerment? We will explore these questions by examining the experiences of diversity, and dynamics of oppression and privilege in local, domestic and global contexts.\n\nThis course takes its name from the book The Poetics of Space by the author Gaston Bachelard. Students will look at ways in which creative writing approaches space, place, and the environment. Students will explore how creative writers over the last hundred years have engaged with the cities they live in, but our investigation is not related to the urban. Through a close attention to ecopoetics and environmental art, we will also be looking at the work of contemporary artists who use the environment as both message and medium, creating art works that, through their direct engagement with the land, bring much needed attention to the grave dangers of an ecological crisis.\n\nIn this class, we will read novels and short stories that engage with the city of Paris—its history, rhythms, and the rich array of cultural traditions that converge and coexist to compose it. Students will use readings as models for their own creative writing, which will also develop from excursions that move us out into the city to explore lesser-known neighborhoods, learn about the backgrounds of the people who live there, and discover the stories behind street names or monuments. We’ll study techniques for writing place in an affective, engaging way, and, at the same time, use our creative practice as a vector of curiosity, driving us to explore and encounter layers of literary culture in the city in which we live and write. We’ll read (or watch) works by Georges Perec, James Baldwin, Agnes Varda, Patrick Modiano, Maude Casey, Yoko Tawada, Leila Slimani, Charles Baudelaire, Mavis Gallant, and Edgar Allen Poe.\n\nGiven that there is only one human species, Homo sapiens, why are some societies so obsessed with separating people into groups and referring to differences between groups as “racial”? Humans have always identified some people as “Us” and everybody else as “Other,” but the “scientific” discourse of race dates from the 19th century. After examining what science can say about the origins and evolution of our species, students will look at how racialized discourse came into use, how it came to justify slavery and imperialism, how it gave rise to eugenics, and how it can culminate in the ultimate denial of the kinship of humanity, genocide."
