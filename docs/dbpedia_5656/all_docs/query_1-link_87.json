Registration is required and participation is capped at 15 people.\n\nIntroduction to Eco-printing: How did people color their clothes before the invention of chemical dyes? Organic matters such as plants and insects were used to dye fabrics. Natural minerals were also used to create beautiful colors. “Eco-printing” is a form of natural dying technique, where plants are used in order to “print” on fabric. When the botanical materials, such as leaves and flowers are laid out on fabric, bundled together and then steamed, they transfer their colors onto the fabric. Results are the watercolor-like images of leaves and flowers on the fabric. During the Eco-printing workshop, each participant will create his or her own eco-print on silk fabric.\n\nDani C. Song is a Queens based artist and a founder of an indie design label, XSILK. Since 2011, her fiber focused art practice has evolved into textile dyeing, apparel and accessory making.\n\n___________________\n\nPlease join us for the Outdoor Series of Performance on the museum lawn.

The audience members are invited to make certain sounds through the piece according to the graphic score as an ensemble to create a spontaneous heterophony that is unique each time.\n\nFacilitated with unconventional sound and found visuals, Tansy Xiao creates theatrical installations with non-linear narratives that often substantiate the ultimate inadequacy of language and extend beyond the fourth wall. As a flâneur who traveled extensively in different continents prior to her relocation to New York, the multiplicity and poetics of her work also echo those journeys.\n\n2:30PM: Pioneer High by Suha Araj\n\nDuration: 9 min 45 sec, followed by Q&A\n\nAdditional Speaker: Hala Araj\n\nIn 1969, Hala emigrated from Palestine to Michigan and attended a high school that prohibits girls from wearing pants.

A revolution brews as the teacher loses control of his classroom to the new girl’s influence.\n\nSuha Araj creates films that explore the displacement of immigrant communities. The Cup Reader, shot in Palestine, screened at the Tribeca Film Festival and was awarded The Next Great Filmmaker Award at the Berkshire International Film Festival and Baghdad International Film Festival.

She has received support for her work from the Sundance Film Festival, Torino Film Lab, Independent Filmmaker Project, Berlinale Talent Project Market, Center for Asian American Media and Cine Qua Non Lab. She is the 2018 recipient of Tribeca/Chanel Through Her Lens production funding for her new film Rosa, now on HBO Max.\n\n3PM: The Javelin Project by Maria Verónica San Martin\n\nDuration: 20 minutes, followed by Q&A\n\nThe Javelin Project consists of a 30-minute ritual-performance that explores the concepts of immigration, resistance and freedom from the history of the ancient spear to the contemporary professional javelin. Inspired by the throwing of the javelin in ancient Greece, the project seeks to reflect on issues of power and patriarchy through a choreography based on movements from the early aboriginal cultures to the capitalism system we inhabited.\n\nThe music and architectural composition invites us to think about a constant and continuous journey, interspersing elements, spaces and perceptions such as wind, waves, survival, nomadism, writing, search, translation, isolation, confinement and the sense of community. The choreography presents different temporalities and balance changes, following a journey that seeks an infinite cosmological space. The javelin gravitates in the air, opening up new narrative possibilities as it falls into the ground.\n\nMaría Verónica San Martín is a Chilean New York-based artist and educator who explores the impacts of history, memory, and trauma through prints, artist books, installation, sculpture, and performance. San Martín was a fellow at the Whitney Museum’s Independent Study Program and a scholar at the Center for Book Arts.

She is a transdisciplinary artist, filmmaker, writer, and curator. Often her subject matters embody transnationalism, cultural cosmopolitanism, diasporic experience, and hybrid racial, ethnic, social queer experiences.
