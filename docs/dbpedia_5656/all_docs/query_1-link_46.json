I’ve always enjoyed learning in any form I can find and perhaps it was this thirst for knowledge which drove me into both a Bachelors and a subsequent Masters program at Bowling Green State University, the former earned in 2015 and the latter in 2020.\n\nHigher education always felt rather comfortable to me. I enjoyed the coursework and the overall atmosphere of learning and self-improvement that a university seems inevitably to foster. As a result, it seemed only natural that, as a newly minted MA, I would focus my job search in the field that had always felt so much like home. My love of learning and desire to help others have access to the same educational opportunities I’ve been lucky enough to experience made admissions a particularly enticing field, so when I heard about an opening in Tiffin University’s Online Admissions department I jumped at the chance.\n\nOutside of work, I fill my time in any number of ways. Reading has always been a major focus of my life and I still devour nearly every book I can get my hands on, regardless of genre. Additionally, I’ve always enjoyed watching sports, mainly baseball and football, and I’ve fostered a deep appreciation for gaming, both in a virtual environment and in a more traditional tabletop structure. I tend to spend my weekends with my family and particularly enjoy the company of my young niece and nephew, who are more than adorable enough to make up for their rambunctious nature.\n\nJill Aldrich\n\nResidence Life, Student Affairs\n\nDirector of Housing Operations\n\nMore Info\n\nTiffin Ohio native, Jill Aldrich came to Tiffin University in the summer of 2004 and serves as the Director of Housing Operations.\n\nJill has over 21 years’ experience in higher education.

Lately though, being GG to her two grandbabies has been pretty hard to top on the scale of happiness and joy.\n\nIt is Jill’s hope that every student that graduates, has the right tools to be successful in their next journey; both socially and in their careers.\n\nJulie Allen\n\nFinancial Aid\n\nFinancial Aid Operations\n\nMore Info\n\nDegrees & Certificates\n\nBachelor of Business Administration\n\nJulie Allen joined the financial aid office in May of 2011 after completing her degree at Tiffin University as an adult student.

I also earned my Master of Business Administration in General Management degree from TU. My experiences here were so great, I wanted to help other students pursue their educational goals like I did. That’s what led me to become an admissions counselor at TU in 2014.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges I’ve ever experienced was pursuing my MBA while participating in athletics and working part-time. I was fortunate to have a great support system of friends, family, coaches and TU faculty and staff. It was hard work, but I accomplished my goal to get an MBA, something I never expected to do.\n\nI think the best part of my job is working with people from so many different backgrounds. Our online students are all at different points in their lives, but they have this in common: they all want to better themselves and have a rewarding future. I believe that whether or not someone has been successful in the past, they can be successful if they set their mind to it. I encourage students to have faith in themselves and take advantage of the resources available to them. We have a great faculty and staff at TU who are here to help.\n\nI’m very dedicated to my job, but like I did when I was a student, I have a life outside TU. When I’m not working, I enjoy working out, watching and playing sports, and spending time with my wife, Brittany, and our dog, Dora.\n\nDan Barrett\n\nInformation Technology Services\n\nNetwork Technician\n\nMore Info\n\nDan Barrett serves as the Network Technician for Tiffin University.\n\nMaria Barulina, Ph.D.\n\nSchool of Business\n\nAssociate Professor of Finance and Analytics\n\nMore Info\n\nDegrees & Certificates\n\nPh.D., in International Business with concentration in Finance, University of Texas\n\nM.S., in Management Information Systems, ITMO University\n\nB.S. in B.B.A., ITMO University\n\nDr. Maria Barulina received her Ph.D. in International Business with concentration in Finance from University of Texas at El Paso.
