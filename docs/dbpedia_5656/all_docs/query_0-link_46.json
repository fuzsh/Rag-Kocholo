Ordered to replace a close friend as fleet admiral, Halsey faces a wily and fierce adversary in Japan's Admiral Yamamoto, and spends the grueling months of the campaign confounding expectations of both the enemy and his own staff. Pained by the losses he knows they will endure, Halsey pushes his forces to the brink.",
