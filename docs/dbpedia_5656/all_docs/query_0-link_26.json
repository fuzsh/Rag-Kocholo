        "text": "For many years, I actively avoided seeing Peter Weir’s 1981 film ‘Gallipoli’. In hindsight it was a dumb thing to do, especially considering Weir’s ‘Picnic at Hanging Rock’ (1975) is my favourite Australian film, but I was sure what I would find would be the kind of flag-waving nationalistic mythologising that made me uncomfortable about our relationship with one of the most important events in our nation’s history. Part of me couldn’t handle the idea of celebration disguised as remembrance, which to me was far more important and the reason I would always wake up early to go to the dawn service on ANZAC Day. Then in my early twenties, I finally caved, deciding I might as well get it out of the way and cross it off my list. What I found though genuinely shocked me. Instead of a legend, I was witnessing something far more human and far more devastating, and understood importance and tragedy of the Gallipoli landing better than thanks to any high school history textbook.\n\nWeir had decided to tackle the Gallipoli story after visiting the battlefields at the Dardanelles, still filled with visible artefacts of the campaign. However, instead of trying to capture the full scale of the battle, what Weir and screenwriter David Williamson crafted with ‘Gallipoli’ was a far more personal story, pulling from Bill Gammage’s ‘The Broken Years’, a collection of diary entries and letters from soldiers who fought in the campaign. It tells the story of two fictional young men, Archie Hamilton (Mark Lee) and Frank Dunne (Mel Gibson), both short-distance runners who meet in outback Western Australia in May 1915. With news of the gallant adventures being had by soldiers on the shores of Gallipoli, the two young men enlist in the 3rd Light Horse Brigade. In the film, the war itself becomes a backdrop to the story of the friendship between the two young men and the connections they make with their fellow soldiers, until its looming presence overwhelms and engulfs them.\n\nIt’s this emphasis on the personal and on character relationships that makes ‘Gallipoli’ one of the most distinct and extraordinary war films ever made. In fact, it seems almost disingenuous to call it a war film at all. We don’t reach the shores of Gallipoli until two-thirds into the film, and even then Weir holds back on depicting actual warfare until the last moment. Unlike most war films, there’s no rush to the energy and horror of battle. Before we can see these young men be driven to their doom, we have to fall in love with them first. One of the reasons the Gallipoli landing is so significant to our nation’s history and national identity is that our innocence and ignorance drove us to rush into a situation we had no comprehension of. It’s something countless films and television series have shown us with baby-faced boys looking horrified at bullet-ridden corpses, but that concept has never been as palpable or devastating as in ‘Gallipoli’. By investing the time to show us the world Archie and Frank have come from, their larrikin charm and cheekiness, the moment they are faced with the realisation of what they have to do hits like a sledgehammer to the chest."
