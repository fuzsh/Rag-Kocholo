Advising for language learning is offered in many self-access learning centers in Japan to support these students. In these sessions, a learner and an advisor engage in a dialogic reflective process to help the learner articulate their needs and goals, make a plan for learning and sustain their learning routine. In this webinar I will introduce a basic model of advising and suggest how it can be used in both language center and classroom environments.Katherine Thornton 11/10/22Moving 'towards' the Metaverse, and the implications for language teaching-What does the metaverse mean for us as language teachers or researchers and what is it?\n\n-Is this really something new or a rebranding of another idea?\n\n-What opportunities and/or drawbacks does the metaverse have for us and our students?\n\nThis presentation will begin with an examination of the fictional history of the metaverse, followed by technical innovations that led to our current stage of development, ranging from text-based creations, to 2D avatar-based environments, and on to low-immersion Virtual Worlds, all of which led to what many are (erroneously) calling the Metaverse today. Dr. Randall Sadler (Ph.D), Associate Professor of Linguistics and Director of TESL and ESL at the University of Illinois. 10/10/22Developing an Advanced Vocabulary through Blended Learning ModulesLanguage learners have only a couple of years to master thousands of words as they [seek to] develop advanced language proficiency (ACTFL 2012) in an instructed learning setting. Learners thus need to learn vocabulary on their own outside of class with ample usage opportunities during instruction. In this webinar, we discuss principles of efficient vocabulary learning that focus on long-term word retention and the expansion of word knowledge (e.g., pronunciation, register, collocation). I will highlight which learning technologies can enhance language curricula and how.Susanne Rott (PhD, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) 9/20/22Connecting language learners through telecollaborationTelecollaboration gives learners opportunities to advance their language skills and intercultural competence through meaningful communication with native speakers or other learners of the language they are studying.

This webinar will offer examples of how to add a social justice lens to commonly taught units and use counter-narratives to inform students’ perspectives.\n\nThis webinar will also kick off an IALLT reading group that will use annotation tools to engage in discussion about an article on the topic of social justice and language teaching and learning.LJ Randolph and Stephanie Madison 9/18/20Stepping up to Online Teaching: Insights into an Online Intensive Summer Language Program\n\nView/Download presentation slidesThe SDSU Language Acquisition Resource Center has been offering face-to-face summer intensive language classes in Arabic, Persian-Farsi, Portuguese, and Russian for over 10 years as part of a Department of Defense funded Project Global Officer (GO) ROTC scholarship program, and these classes are also open to non-ROTC students and community members. Six-weeks prior to the start of the 2020 summer program, the SDSU-LARC leadership made the prompt decision to transition all 16 language courses (Four languages - 101, 102, 201, 202 levels) and the upper-division Portuguese study abroad program to an online/virtual format. In this webinar the SDSU summer language program coordinator will describe the SDSU summer intensive language program, student population, proficiency goals, and six-week development process to online instruction. The program instructors will provide first-hand insight into some of their successes, challenges, and minor failures in regards to synchronous instructions, synchronous and asynchronous activities, and assessments during the online intensive summer program. While an intensive language program format is not the norm for most language programs, we hope the instructor experience will shed light into actual classroom delivery and student performance in an online format.

Previous research has already found that more than four out of five students use online translators for on-ground classes, even when it's prohibited. Methods to prevent unauthorized use of tools (e.g. lock-down browsers) for courses delivered online are usually rather easy to circumvent. In this webinar, I will discuss the results of my recent survey of online students and instructors that explored usage, attitudes, and course policies for web- and app-based language tools. I'll also share suggestions for rubrics and training that instructors can implement to help students to use (or not use) translators and other tools in different contexts.Errol O'Neill, University of Memphis 7/29/20Online, Hybrid, Hyflex, and High Stress: Preparing for Fall 2020In this webinar, panelists will discuss some of the formats that universities will be operating under in fall of 2020, including in-person instruction with social distancing, hybrid formats, hyflex formats, and online learning. Panelists will present briefly about what has worked well for them in the past and how they are planning to prepare for the fall. Then panelists will address questions that were posed in the registration form or during the webinar. Finally, all participants will be invited to participate in a breakout session about one of the formats planned for the fall based on their interest. Please come prepared to offer your ideas and help lower the stress in our language teaching community!Noah McLaughlin (Kennesaw State University), Florencia Henshaw (University of Illinois), Kevin Gaugler (Marist College) 7/10/20Providing Leadership in World Language Education: Now More Than Ever!\"The past few months have radically changed education in our country and around the world, and we all face an uncertain fall. Now more than ever, focused and supportive leadership in world language education will make a difference for teachers and students.

Ideas for purposeful asynchronous communication\n\nView the webinar recordingDiscussion boards are the quintessential tool for asynchronous communication in online environments. However, typical forum posts resemble individual writing assignments followed by an obligatory and oftentimes vague response component, involving “at least two classmates who don’t have any replies yet.” In this webinar, I propose a different way of approaching asynchronous communication assignments, which aligns more closely with our goal of helping students to develop communicative ability in the target language. I will share several examples and ideas for novice, intermediate, and advanced learners, as well as some tips to minimize cheating.Florencia Henshaw, University of Illinois 5/7/20Culpeper Games: Video Games Teaching Languages and CulturesThe Culpeper Language Learning Center at Gustavus Adolphus College has begun developing video games to help teach languages and cultures.

Let’s all put on our oxygen masks first before helping others. Our students are as stressed and scared as we are about their ability to succeed in this environment. This webinar will discuss setting reasonable expectations for what we as instructors can do to prepare our students. We will look at options for opening two-way lines of communication, making sure that we are keeping our students engaged daily without their physical presence, and providing multiple means of learning and assessing where students are without having to learn 100 new tools by tomorrow. Ample time will also be provided for Q&A so we can make sure to address what participants need most now and in the coming weeks.Lauren Rosen, University of Wisconsin 3/10/20Prepping in the Language Class: Instructional Contingency Planning for Emergency Situations\n\nView the webinar recordingBoth higher education and K-12 institutions are being asked to formulate contingency plans in the event of a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. A major emphasis is being placed on the conversion of face-to-face classes to online delivery of instruction, should the situation require temporary campus closures. This panel discussion will address critical questions to consider as you create and communicate your contingency plans for language classes and learning centers, as well as discuss a range of solutions that may be adapted to your unique learning environment.

Collaboration between these support staff and faculty or subject matter experts is integral for successful curriculum innovation, but comes with unique challenges. The presenters of this webinar will outline best practices for these collaborations to ensure a successful process and end product.Carly Lesoski, Erica DeSousa, Wayne State University and Michigan Virtual School 12/12/19H5P and ANVILL: Looking Forward to 20/20Jessica Miller (Professor of French, UW-Eau Claire) has been using the free version of H5P for a year in two intermediate-level French classes. She will show her favorite types of H5P activities, how they integrate to Canvas (the UW-system LMS as of Fall 2019), and share the pros and cons of her experience so far.\n\nShannon Spasova (Michigan State) will showcase some of the most recent and unique H5P activity types like Branching Scenario, Interactive Book, Advanced Fill-in-the Blanks, Speak the Words, and Dictation.\n\nThe H5P suite of content types has simultaneously delighted and frustrated language teachers. Jeff Magoto (University of Oregon) will discuss how the latest version of ANVILL has been designed to amplify the enthusiasm and minimize the hand-wringing. Here are some of its key features: easy creation of complex lessons, a built in streaming media engine so not only does it handle all types of audio and video but it allows for them to be used in many new places, LTI compatibility so that it works inside of your favorite LMS, detailed analytics which track how and what your students are doing, and a mobile app, which makes speech so much easier to create and respond to.Shannon Spasova, Michigan State, Jessica Miller, University of Wisconsin, Jeff Magoto, University of Oregon 11/14/19Engagement and Immersion in Virtual Reality NarrativesThis webinar will describe a Paris Narrative Virtual reality (VR) project in which four Parisians from different backgrounds recorded their personal, social, and professional lives with a VR camera. Each Parisian VR narrative allows language learners to vividly experience Parisian life in visual, auditory, and sensory modalities. The webinar will showcase how this deeply contextualized and culturally immersive platform and its accompanying teaching materials target the cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and social dimensions of engagement (Philp & Duquesne, 2016).Nicole Mills, Harvard University 10/17/19Language Learning through Interactive FictionThis webinar will explore the use of interactive fiction for second language learning. To begin, we will define this genre of story/game. Next, The Interactive Fiction for Second Language Learners Collection will be showcased. This is a collection of stories we have been developing, in a number of languages, aimed at second language learners. Following the showcase, Twine, an open source interactive fiction development tool will be demoed. Finally, ideas for using and creating interactive fiction in language courses will be discussed.Jeremy Robinson, Gustavus Adolphus College 9/26/19Cross Cultural Communities through the Digital Dialect ArchiveAs part of an interdisciplinary team-teaching project that explored new ways of using drama in language classes, students from diverse backgrounds came together to work on a mutually beneficial project involving the International Dialects of English Archive (IDEA). English language learners at universities in the United States are often isolated from their American counterparts and aren’t provided enough opportunities for meaningful connections. This project aimed to foster intercultural communities, to offer English language learners authentic opportunities for language use, and to provide acting students the chance to study culture and dialect hand-in-hand. Acting students must learn to perform dialects authentically, which requires the ability to gather and analyze source material, and to learn about the cultural context of dialects. These drama students were trained in a dialect collection and analysis technique and then assigned partners from English language classes. Using readily available hardware and free software, they recorded, analyzed, and transcribed these conversations. The resulting data has been published online to IDEA. This is a process that can be replicated even in the absence of drama students.Deric McNish (Michigan State University) and Carmela Romano Gillette (University of Michigan) 8/15/19LRC Events: What Works?If you are planning your 2019-20 Language Center events calendar, this webinar is for you.

How do we measure and sustain engagement in traditional face-to-face language classes as well as online courses? This session explores the concept of “engagement” and offers insight into research-based techniques that engage language learners. The presenter will offer examples from his own teaching.Bobby Hobgood, University of North Carolina at Charlotte 5/14/19Automatic Speech Recognition in World LanguagesAutomatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies have been around for quite some time, but until recently they were largely proprietary, complicated, and either minimally useful or expensive. However, the past few years have seen a watershed in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technologies like ASR, and their adoption in everyday technologies like smartphones and standalone “assistant” devices like Alexa and Google Home are rapidly making the tech not only more useful, but also more commonplace. This webinar will examine the role of automated speech recognition (ASR) technology as it relates to the instruction and learning of world languages. We will explore current commercial and no-cost offerings, as well as some emergent CALL research that advocates for the integration of ASR tools as part of the language curriculum.Dan Nickolai (St. Louis University) and Johnathon Beals (University of Michigan) 4/11/19A Preview of IALLT 2019: Crafting Communities of LearnersPlease join the IALLT 2019 planning team for a preview of the upcoming conference and special opportunities that await our attendees, June 19-22 in Eugene, Oregon.

Nevertheless, it is still far from becoming a common pedagogical practice. In my presentation, I will discuss how corpora can be used as Open Educational Resources (OER) and exemplify it with a case of implementing DDL in German language courses at the University of Kansas.Nina Vyatkina, University of Kansas 2/4/19Virtual reality in the language classroom: Principles and practicesMany instructors have likely heard of Quizlet as a free app for online flashcards; however, what may be less clear is how to effectively incorporate Quizlet’s various functions into the foreign language classroom. While Quizlet Live offers obvious classroom applications, there are other ways to help students learn to use Quizlet that will not only help with vocabulary acquisition, but also potentially improve pronunciation, increase independent study and critical thinking skills, and help foster a sense of community among class members. This webinar will offer some suggestions of untraditional ways to use Quizlet in a foreign language classroom.Margherita Berti, University of Arizona 2/4/19Meet the IALLT Candidates WebinarNAFacilitator: Sangeetha Gopalakrishnan, Election chair 1/28/19Vocab Learning and Beyond: Using Quizlet in the FL ClassroomMany instructors have likely heard of Quizlet as a free app for online flashcards; however, what may be less clear is how to effectively incorporate Quizlet’s various functions into the foreign language classroom. While Quizlet Live offers obvious classroom applications, there are other ways to help students learn to use Quizlet that will not only help with vocabulary acquisition, but also potentially improve pronunciation, increase independent study and critical thinking skills, and help foster a sense of community among class members. This webinar will offer some suggestions of untraditional ways to use Quizlet in a foreign language classroom.Molly Godwin-Jones, University of Kansas 12/12/18Differentiating with SeeSawIn this webinar, I will highlight how data collected on some of my favorite gaming tools such as GimKit, Quizalize, Quizizz can be used to differentiate lesson plans. In combination with SeeSaw, an amazing multi-faceted tool, teachers can scaffold activities to push student to the next proficiency levels in speaking and writing. Participants will be shown the how-to's for each tool presented and will be encouraged to create activities to use in their classrooms.Nathalie Ettzevoglou 11/28/18A Tiered Approach to AssessmentUCLA language programs have begun to use a tiered approach to assessment, where assessment is considered more as a overall package than just a specific individual activity. By matching smaller “micro” assessments directly against a specific learning objective or outcome, students work can be assessed in a clear, formative manner. Later, these “micro” assessments are combined with others to create a full summative assessment of the student.Tom Garbelotti, UCLA 10/25/18Is Handwriting Dead? The Case for Digital Tools for Writing in the Language ClassroomThis webinar discusses changing trends in handwriting practices in the language classrooms with the advent of LMS and Google input tools.

This collaboration can be from sharing resources and co-hosting events and professional development, to physically merging centers. The presenter will share how her center moved to a student residence hall to be part of a larger living-learning community.Bridget Yaden, Pacific Lutheran University 5/21/18Three Tools to Capture, Share, and InteractJoin two ACTFL national language teachers of the year as they share three tools they have used to capture student voices and other artifacts of their proficiency and to share and interact with people around the world.Nicole Naditz and Christine Lanphere, ACTFL National Language Teachers of the Year 4/26/18Using Voicethread to Engage Intermediate and Advanced Students in the Language ClassroomThis webinar will discuss how to use the web-based platform VoiceThread for technology projects in the intermediate and advanced language classroom. A number of samples on topics like “Tourism”, “Migration” and “Environmental Consciousness” from a third year German course will be presented. The samples are in German, but will be described and discussed in English.Saskia Hintz, UC Boulder 3/27/18\"The Core of a Successful Language Center: Hire, Train, and\n\nDevelop Stellar Staff\"No language center can successfully serve its users without qualified and dedicated staff members. In many cases, student staff are essential in the daily tasks that keep the center running smoothly. Therefore, it is necessary that these students be of high quality, well-trained, and motivated. This webinar will provide tools and methods to help improve the process of hiring, training and developing your student staff to make them an integrated part of your successful center.Jean Janecki, Mount Holyoke College 2/27/18Affect-aware Technologies: The Dawn of a New Age for CALL?2017 saw the integration of facial recognition in many popular devices and an ever-increasing number of free and paid apps involving emotion-detection. Are these simply fancy, entertaining features and apps or will this technology prove to be the key component of “intelligent\"\" apps in computer-assisted language learning?\n\nThis webinar is for educators, researchers, developers and administrators interested in:\n\n1) Learning how facial recognition is being used to learn more about a student’s attention, engagement and sentiment at particular moments in order to regulate and adjust the pace or content of learning materials.\n\n2) Seeing illustrations of a number of available tools and apps\n\n3) Hearing a brief review of relevant research and educators’ previous experiences to enable a more informed and analytical approach to the selection and use of emotion-detection technologies.\n\nOur discussion will allow us to reflect together upon some of the challenges and issues the use of such technology invites\n\nKaren Price 1/24/18The (Ir)relevance of Language Resource Centers in Today's Technological and Methodological Climate: Situating Relevance Within Three Specific ParadigmsIn this webinar, I summarize a few key findings from my recent dissertation: Form, Function, and Relevance of Contemporary Language Resource Centers. First, I will provide a brief overview of the study in general and then open the floor for discussion regarding the (ir)relevance of language resource centers (LRCs) in today’s technological and methodological climate. Following that discussion, I will offer three paradigms that emerged from the data analysis as a potential framework for discussing the relationship between language centers and the broader field of foreign language education. Implications of these findings will be offered both for those working within and with LRCs.Paul Sebastian, Appalachian State University 12/14/17Open to Change: Strategies for Finding, Utilizing, and\n\nCreating Open Media Content for Language CoursesThere is general agreement that authentic media are useful, if not essential to learning a foreign language. One of the more imposing tasks for instructors, however, is locating appropriate visual and audio materials for use in our courses. While the internet abounds with pictures, drawings, songs, feature films, television shows, documentaries, and commercials in foreign languages, making them available for student use is often hampered by copyright restrictions. These issues are compounded for authors of textbooks, especially open educational resources, where copyright concerns are often an impediment to the successful deployment of such materials to a wider audience.\n\nThis webinar will focus on tools and practices to best utilize openly licensed media for language courses, especially open language curricula. I will begin by discussing some of the concerns regarding the use of closed vs. open material, as well as surveying some of the most commonly used open licenses under which videos are available. I will then focus on topics such as finding, adapting, and delivering open content to students. Throughout the workshop I will argue that open resources can not only meet the needs typically met by closed content, but are frequently superior in quality. A portion of the workshop will include a demonstration of several of these techniques, so that participants will be able to implement these strategies for their own classes.Christian Hilchey, U of Texas-Austin\n\n1. Thinking Open Handout\n\n2. Open to Change Handout 11/7/17Talking Abroad: Web-based Videoconferencing with Native SpeakersThis webinar is for educators interested in integrating authentic synchronous communication with native speakers worldwide through web-based video-chat. I will start with an overview of existing research, as well as the advantages and limitations of different available platforms, both free and paid. I will then discuss a specific multi-step project in an intermediate-level Spanish course, involving four conversations with native speakers through the platform TalkAbroad. I will also present the results of a questionnaire administered at the end of the project, reflecting the students’ perceptions of the experience. Preliminary implications for best practices are drawn based on students’ responses.Florencia Henshaw, University of Illinois 10/17/17Post-secondary administrative perspectives on technology-mediated language learningPerspectives on language and technology projects: a liberal arts dean (and language professor) and a chief information officer share their thoughts about collaborative opportunities and strategies to meet challenges in the context of post-secondary foreign language education.Benjamin Rifkin, Hofstra, and Keith Mac McIntosh, University of Richmond 9/20/17Changing Roles: Impacting the Language Learning Narrative on CampusUniversities are increasingly deciding to drop language courses from graduation requirements. As a consequence, language departments are left with the responsibility of recruiting students and advocating for the benefits of language learning. In response to this need, the Center for Language Teaching Advancement (CeLTA) at Michigan State University developed a print, event, and social media marketing campaign designed to impact the language learning narrative on campus by focusing on the emotional/experiential benefits of learning a new language rather than on the traditionally recognized benefits (cognitive, social, instrumental). The approach was based on data gathered through extensive students interviews, which allowed the campaign to speak to a real student need, and resulted in an ongoing social media and print campaign, a regularly updated website, and a series of student-led events.Angelika Kraemer and Luca Giupponi, MSU 8/17/17Empowering Teachers to Author Their Own Materials: ANVILL, H5P, and BeyondIn this webinar, we will examine the question of what inspires faculty members to innovate with their own course materials. The presenters will share examples of two tools, ANVILL and H5P, and what features of those tools might help interest faculty in creating personalized materials. WEBINAR PREQUELS/SEQUELS VIDEO RECORDINGSJeff Magoto, University of Oregon and Shannon Spasova, Michigan State University 7/12/17Automated and intelligent tools in the language classroomThis webinar will present a number of existing and emerging automated and intelligent tools and resources that present great potential for language learning and teaching. These tools present us with new opportunities as well as expectations. Some of these tools may not have obvious applications while others are designed specifically for language instruction. The presenter will discuss trends among these tools and how they may change in the near future. Suggestions for curricular implantation, as well as teacher preparation, will be discussed.Greg Kessler, Ohio University 6/1/2017Curriculum-centered Language Placement TestingThis webinar will explore the advantages of using a curriculum-based proficiency exam for the purposes of language placement. In addition, the SLUPE authoring tool will be demonstrated as one potential approach to constructing a free web-based assessment.Dan Nickolai, St. Louis University 5/18/2017Let’s Play: Gamifying Language LessonsThis webinar will explore how to enhance the pleasure of language learning by transforming lessons into color-coded pattern recognition games. By using \"Picky Birds,\" a Chinese tone training app game developed by the presenter's interdisciplinary team as an example, we will discuss the game design concept and its applicability to other languages (including literary languages) as well as to other formats. The main objective of this webinar is to explore how to communicate foreign and abstract concepts of grammar, both linguistic and cultural, to learners by helping them to create and solidify a mental picture of those concepts through a satisfying and memorable gaming experience. LinkCatherine Ryu, Michigan State University 4/12/17Language Learning in Networks: Tools and Frameworks for Open Language LearningNetworks are all around us. Our classrooms are small, transient, networks of learners, but we don't have to limit ourselves (and our learners) to the networks that exist in our classroom. Using technologies which allow us to network, open learning tools and resources, and fellow language learners around the globe, we can enrich our language classrooms, and the classrooms of our colleagues in other places. In this session we will discuss networks and digital citizenship, how it is relevant in the language classroom, and what types of tools can be used to enable language learners to gain a glimpse into the emic perspective of the language and culture they are learning.Apostolos Koutropoulos, University of Massachusetts-Boston 3/7/17Borderless Classrooms?: Virtual Exchanges for Language and Culture CoursesTelecollaboration tools can foster global engagement and authentic communicative contexts by putting students in direct contact with representatives of other cultures and languages. While the potential of such connections to enhance student motivation, language proficiency, and intercultural competence seems great, the startup and class-to-class costs can be daunting. In this webinar, we will draw on recent projects at Connecticut College to reflect on the benefits and challenges of virtual exchanges, and share our emerging inventory of best practices. The session will also consider how to find appropriate partners and to foster productive reciprocal relationships.Laura Little, Connecticut College 2/16/2017Gain Time and Differentiate with a Flipped Learning ApproachFrustrated that you never get to those interactive communicative activities at the end of your lesson plan? Struggling to figure out how to differentiate for specific student needs? Consider flipping your lessons and gain the time you are missing to help all your students to reach their potential. In this webinar you will learn what flipping lessons really means in a language learning context, view a variety of lesson examples, learn from the data gathered in Russian and Japanese classes how well this works, and leave with the techniques and technology knowledge to start building your own flipped lessons.Lauren Rosen, University of Wisconsin 1/12/2017Bringing it Back: Using study abroad experiences to bring intercultural communicative competence (ICC) into U.S. classroomsAuthentic materials are key to supporting intercultural communicative competence (ICC) in our classrooms. A recent study abroad experience to Chile afforded the opportunity to create culturally relevant videos in Spanish. Participants who teach Spanish will be given access to these videos for use in their classrooms, as well as instructional materials to support their use in promoting intercultural communicative competence in their classrooms. Instructors of other languages will hear about how they can use future study abroad opportunities to develop similar materials. Participants will be asked for feedback on the ideas, videos, and instructional materials provided, in order for the researchers to make improvements to future iterations.Amanda Romjue, Applachian State University 12/13/16Integrating Google Translate to Support Language Acquisition for All Second Language LearnersAlmost all second language (L2) students admit to using online translators at some point (Jolley & Maimone, 2015) and almost all language departments prohibit students using translators, such as Google Translate (Clifford, Merschel, & Munné, 2013; Knowles, 2016). Second language students persist in using online translators despite overt policies by their institutions to the contrary. This workshop will outline the reasons students use online translators, the advantages of an integration approach to online translators, and the benefits and limitations of using Google Translate in the L2 classroom. The presenter will also outline practical methods and approaches for incorporating this tool that supports language acquisition and academic integrity at all levels of language learning.Claire Knowles, University of Memphis 10/18/2016Promoting Student Engagement in a Hybrid Language CourseThis webinar will explore a hybrid model (face-to-face/online learning) as a method of promoting student engagement in L2 courses.
