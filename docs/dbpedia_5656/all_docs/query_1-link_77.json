        "text": "Like Walt Whitman in 1892, meditating on what individual identity means in America, this creative writing course invites students to be essayists of their own experience, uncovering past, present, and future versions of themselves. The young writers in this class turn time and again to essential questions: Who am I writing to and why? How do I find what is worth recording? How do I respond to history as it is happening? To inspire their writing, students read a diverse body of classic and contemporary works, focusing on emotional and conceptual arcs and techniques of voice, narrative, imagery, and style. Readings include The Art of the Personal Essay by Phillip Lopate and a selection of essays and poems by Sei Shonagon, Walter Benjamin, Jorge Luis Borges, Joan Didion, E. B. White, Zadie Smith, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Ross Gay, and more.\n\n“Poetry is the way we help give name to the nameless so it can be thought. The farthest horizons of our hopes and fears are cobbled by our poems, carved from the rock experiences of our daily lives.” —Audre Lorde\n\nThrough a close examination of syntax, line, literal and non-literal speech, and sonic devices, students approach and practice the poetic form with increased acuity and appreciation. The sonnet, sestina, tanka, ghazal, free verse, prose poetry, and spoken word are among the various forms considered in works by poets of a range of literary ages, geographical regions, emotional lenses, and theoretical perspectives. In its examination of poetic forms, the course pays particular attention to the influences and intersections of race, class, sexuality, and gender. Students work towards reading poetry with both an intuitive eye and a mastery of technical terminology, offering their own poetic perspectives in a set of revised poems."
