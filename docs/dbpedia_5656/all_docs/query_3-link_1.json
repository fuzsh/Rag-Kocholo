        "text": "In San Diego, California, Father Dick Ball tells two young boys the story of his childhood friend and one of the city's most famous citizens, John Joseph Montgomery, who, in 1883, was the first American to fly a glider plane. The priest begins his story in 1879, when John began sharing his dreams with Regina Cleary, his sweetheart: John's family dismisses his desire to fly as mere foolishness, and when his father Zachary, an ambitious attorney hints that his son's pursuits will harm his career, John abandons his dream. Regina, however, does not believe Zachary's fears are legitimate, and urges John to continue his work in secret. John agrees with Regina, and, in August 1883, makes his first successful test flight in a contraption that he calls an \"aeroplane.\" When Regina announces to John's family that John made his first flight, Zachary, now the Assistant Attorney General of the United States, urges his son to forget the flying machine and concentrate on his religious studies instead. With the helpful intervention of Father Ball, however, John gets support for his glider invention from Father Kenton, an aviation enthusiast, who gives John a job and provides him with a workshop at Santa Clara College. Time passes, and John, having built many models of his flying machine, looks forward to the day when he will finally be able to test a full-size. John's dream of flying is nearly lost one day when he suffers a dizzy spell and collapses. After being told by a doctor that his dizzy spells will preclude him from ever flying, John feels that he has been denied his true passion and becomes despondent. John later regains his confidence in the glider project when parachutist Dan Mahoney, who performs at carnivals under the name \"Professor LaSalle,\" offers to test John's glider by attaching it to his hot air balloon and releasing it in mid-air. With help from Dick and Father Kenton, Dan makes a successful take-off and soars above the clouds before descending to a perfect landing. Though he later receives many letters of praise for his invention, John finds that he is broke. A short time later, Dan is killed during a test flight, and John again becomes discouraged. John's luck turns from bad to worse when a strong earthquake destroys his glider and much of Santa Clara College. The only possession John is able to salvage from the quake is his gold-panning machine, which he sells for $25,000. After marrying Regina, John is sued by a man who claims that the gold machine belonged to him and that John had no right to sell it. The lengthy trial results in a ruling in John's favor, but the expensive trial leaves him broke again. Undeterred by his misfortunes, John rebuilds his glider, and decides to fly it himself. During the flight, John suffers from another dizzy spell and loses control of the plane. The plane crashes, and John dies a few hours later."
