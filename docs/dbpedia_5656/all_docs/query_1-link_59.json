Mark’s advice to privilege the specific focus which led to my title helped me overcome the challenge of juggling clarity and breadth of scope. My thanks to Shelley MacDonald Beaulieu for the skill and care with which she prepared the manuscript for submission to the press. I also wish to thank Frances Mundy, production editor at the Press, and Anne Laughlin, copyeditor, for their efficiency throughout a publishing process all the more complex as the press has so many works going through “the pipeline” at the same time. I am equally grateful to the two anonymous reviewers whose generous comments led to the ASPP funding that made publication possible. One in particular gave me the enchanting feeling that I’d met The Ideal Reader. Thanks as well to Mary K. MacLeod, ­literary executor for Mavis Gallant’s estate, for her encouragement, and to John Thleme and W.H. New for their support (at the inchoate and production stages respectively). I want to extend my appreciation to Jennifer Toews, in charge of the Mavis Gallant papers at the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library, for a dedication and helpfulness clearly rooted in a heartfelt esteem for the writer and her work. Finally, my fervent thanks to my husband Patrick Chézaud, my first reader and critic. His expert comments at each stage of my work are unfailingly illuminating, and his rigour can always be counted on to spot the slightest fuzziness in word or concept.\n\nMAVIS GALLANT The Eye & the Ear\n\n1 “Acquisitions”: mapping world and work\n\nThe beginning writer has to choose, tear to pieces, spit out, chew up and assimi­ late as naturally as a young animal –– as naturally and as ruthlessly. Mavis Gallant, “What Is Style?” (37) ... the concept of art has no content beyond what art has been. Jerrold Levinson, Music, Art, & Metaphysics: Essays in Philosophical Aesthetics (7, emphasis in original)\n\nan acrostic for Mavis When the PEN/Nabokov Literary Award was attributed to Mavis Gallant in 2004, but poor health would not allow her to attend the award pres­ entation ceremony in New York City’s Lincoln Center, a special tribute was organized for her in Paris in December at the Maison des Écrivains. Alberto Manguel, who was to introduce her, found himself on an operat­ ing table and had to cancel, so Mavis requested that I stand in for him. I chose to introduce her through the qualities called up by the letters of her last name –– an embryonic acrostic which I redeploy here to provide the point of entry into this book: G for A for L for L for A for N for T for\n\nGifted/Gallantry, Gumption, Grit A/mazing Learned & anything but Lazy Language Acute Notable True\n\n4\n\nMavis Gallant: The Eye and the Ear\n\nI shall dwell somewhat on the opening term “Gifted.” As applied to a writer who has dazzled readers, especially other writers, to the point of being called “the God of the Short Story” (Adderson 78), the term can seem tame and self-evident, but its two acceptations underpin the over­ arching argument of this book. Michael Ondaatje insists that “Gallant seems beholden to no one” (xi); Neel Mukherjee compares Gallant to the goddess Athena springing fully formed and armed from the head of Zeus (11); and Carol Shields in private referred to “the divine Mavis, the divine Alice.”1 How indeed then, wonders Caroline Adderson, can she presume to review Gallant: How does one review God? She is great. She is good. The end. (Adderson 79)\n\nIn this sense, “gifted” obviously involves exceptional talent or natu­ ral ability. Yet Ondaatje adds that “Gallant’s craft and empathy, with that skill in evoking subtle and obsessive voices, is always ahead of us” (xii).2 In essence, he appends a second meaning. Gallant’s extraordinary creative power –– posited to be connate – ­takes on the added contours of an acquired accomplishment or mastery involving work or construc­ tion, related to the Greek techne: skill or industry. When we wonder if Gallant, like Athena, emerged as a writer “fully formed with all her gifts resplendent” (Adderson 79), the age-old nature/nurture debate unfurls.3 It will nourish this book’s central thesis arguing a modernist osmosis between the literary text and both visual culture and music, through the twin “gifts” (alternately seen as channels of craftsmanship) announced in my title. The double focus on the eye and the ear – e­ ither innately acute or honed, or both – i­nvolves an emphasis on the art, film, and music Gallant was immersed in, and it connects with the visual studies\n\n1 The conversation in which Shields confided such esteem for the two great short story writers took place over lunch with Carol (already very ill) and her husband Don when she came to Paris for the premiere of her play Thirteen Hands/Treize Mains (adapted and directed by Rachel Salik). Shields reiterated the comment made the day of the first performance at Théâtre 13 (20 Nov. 2001) in a personal email in which she thanked me for having put her in touch with the Gallant she hugely admired. Shields explained, “When my daughters and I talk about Canadian writers we always talk about the divine Alice, and then, immediately, the divine Mavis (that’s the extent of our divinity division, just two members)” (Shields, email to Dvorˇák). 2 Italicized emphases in quotes are my stresses unless otherwise stipulated. 3 Hemingway observed that a great writer “seems to be born with knowledge” but really is not. He suggests that such a writer has only been “born with the ability to learn in a quicker ratio to the passage of time” than others, and, to boot, “without conscious application” (Death 168) – ­which sounds suspiciously like a gift to me!\n\n“Acquisitions”: mapping world and work\n\n5\n\nand sound studies currently on the rise. It plugs into an era’s logic of the heterogeneous and the heteroclite, inherent to the bricoleur who – ­like me with respect to my original acrostic – ­adopts, adapts, and recombines the tools and mate­rials at hand, even when these result from anterior constructions and destructions and are not originally designed for the operation at hand (Lévi-Strauss 31; Derrida 409–28). James Joyce’s sem­ inal Ulysses (1922), published the year Mavis was born, and Pierre Hen­ ry’s equally seminal electroacoustic nod to Bach’s The Well-Tempered Clavier, namely Le ­Microphone bien tempéré [The Well-Tempered Microphone] (1951), created when Mavis4 was reborn in Paris, deliberately adopt such bricolage as method.5 These artworks can exemplify artistic practice subsequently appropriated by postmodernists. Such practice in­ novates by situating itself within (and manipulating) sets of pre-existing recombinable elements making up our cultural heritage – s­ ets which can offer over fifty thousand combinations (P. Schaeffer 218),6 but which are ultimately closed. This book raises epistemological and ontological questions on inven­ tion, origins, and creativity, as I examine Gallant’s intercultural, interme­ dial, but distinctive modus operandi. I shall argue that unlike, say, Joyce’s general strategy consisting of transmutations of pre-existing structures – ­a strategy which is also the bedrock of jazz (Berendt) – G ­ allant’s art-­ making leans rather towards that of Lévi-Strauss’s “engineer,” the one who begets rather than (re)assembles. Gallant’s disclosures that the first flash of a story takes the form of a film still (Dvorˇák, “When Language”;\n\n4 As a rule I use the familiar term of address, “‘Mavis,” to provide insights on the woman in her life and in a French habitat we shared, and the formal “Gallant” for the more scholarly analysis, namely everything involving what happens on her pages and how. Still, questions of inclination, taste, talent, perception, influences, and experience are all vital to the vocation and craft of writing, and make it hard to compartmental­ ize the human being, Mavis, from the writer, Gallant. Given the difficulty of ontologi­ cally separating the two, the switches in terms of address may at times be quite fluid. 5 In a 1958 public debate taped by the University of Virginia when he was Writerin-Residence there, William Faulkner made a similar analogy between a writer and a carpenter, affirming that the wordsmith too has “a grab bag, a barrel full of odds and ends, of boards and nails, and – ­and the sort of things he might possibly some day need.” When he does need something in the heat of writing the story, he “scrabbles around in his barrel until he finds something that fits” (“Faulkner at Virginia”). 6 Henry’s mentor, sound pioneer Pierre Schaeffer, whose journals on concrete music have recently been made available in English translation, is referring to the numerical com­ binations of the sets in his sound classification system, in analogy with mathematical language. The discussion which follows will reveal the multiple analogies with literary language (beyond the issue of methodology), notably the fact that sound characterol­ ogy is physiologically “accessible to the direct experience of the musical ear” (199).\n\n6\n\nMavis Gallant: The Eye and the Ear\n\nGallant, Interview with Daphne Kalotay) gesture to how the writer opens up and positions herself outside and beyond (Lévi-Strauss 31). In her introduction to Gallant’s recently reissued Collected Stories (2016), Francine Prose, too, claims the writer’s work is “unlike anyone else’s” (“Introduction” xii), meaning unlike any other writer’s. She does see an analogy outside the literary system, notably likening Gallant’s “technical daring and innovative freedom” to a painting by Velásquez, hidden unless you pay close attention and also accept that the art cannot be reduced or summarized (xii). Gallant seen as “engineer,” coming from ingenium, points us once more to the concept of (the equally Latinate) genius, i.e., an innate disposition, a transcendent intelligence naturally inclined to­ wards invention. In the polyvocal critical reality which has surrounded Gallant’s work,7 I address from different angles this generative power of her unique eye, her gaze on being human in a world of upheavals and quiet sea changes. “Look for the source of light in her work as you would in a painting,” advises the book critic Susan Salter Reynolds. Mavis’s vision of life not only bathes but emanates from her pages and spills onto the world, as does the light in chiaroscuro canvases. The vision is both connate and experiential, palpable from the dark first novel Green Water, Green Sky (1959/2016),8 to the wild, quirky novel A Fairly Good Time (1970/2016), which Peter Orner describes as “a new wave Sun Also Rises written by a woman with a better sense of humour” (“Introduction” vii). My G for Gifted also points to Gallantry, Gumption, and Grit. The young Mavis started out with less than nothing: she borrowed $200 for a typing course because at every job interview she heard: you’re a girl, can you type. Then, when she had established a career as a feature journalist at the Montreal Standard, she threw it up and headed for Europe with just a typewriter and a suitcase – w ­ hat Jhumpa Lahiri has called “a revolutionary act” by a woman who both “in life and on the page, blazed a trail no one since has dared follow” ( “Mavis Gallant’s Choice”). The A for Amazing is as multi-tiered as the woman who wrote, “Here one was handed a folded thought like a shapeless school uniform, and told, ‘There, wear that.’ Everyone had it on, regardless of fit” (Gallant, Home Truths 296; Varieties of Exile 145).9 The folded thought, a startling\n\n7 It is naturally not possible to acknowledge all the valuable works which constitute international Gallant scholarship. 8 Readers will find the recent publication date after the date of original publication. 9 Regarding quotations, these much-quoted story collections will henceforth be desig­ nated as HT and VE respectively; the name Gallant will be understood.\n\n“Acquisitions”: mapping world and work\n\n7\n\nconceit compressing the abstract and the concrete, triggers a clothing simile which in turn modulates into an extended metaphor. All show a craftsmanship that is “amazing” in the sense of “admirable,” overset by another acceptation: “astounding,” notably regarding the writer’s hall­ mark analogies and challenges to ready-made beliefs. In addition, Gallant a/mazes in the sense of deciphering or disentangling a complicated world and the jumbled human mind. She illuminates the minute intricacies of our social interactions, from the smallest familial unit to the macro geo­ political sphere of imperial and postwar cultures. The first L in my Gallant stands for Learned. Like earlier modernists such as T.S. Eliot, Joyce, and Vladimir Nabokov (who had a career in Russian before being born again into English), Mavis read voraciously and extensively, as testify the books in her personal library touching on multiple fields10 and authored in multiple languages. Analogous to a Cubist collage of pre-existing material, the intertextual web of displaced or cunningly disguised cultural references underpinning the cultured Gal­ lant’s work bifurcates and refracts. This same L also indirectly nods to the energeia of a writer who produced 116 short stories in The New Yorker alone (Rothman; Orner, “Introduction” xi) as well as novels, essays, and drama, many of them recently reissued. She is a powerhouse of a writer whose recently reissued volume of Collected Stories makes up less than half of her output but still crushes you if you read it in bed. The second L for Language calls up Gallant’s “dazzlingly precise, virtu­ osic writing” (Prose, “Introduction” xii), and will provide the focal point of my analysis – b ­ oth the point at which identified perspectives meet and the point from which diverging lines proceed. Famously coming from a split linguistic, cultural, and thus axiological environment, Mavis stood up for the integrity of language when she was only four years old, and was punished for it. The child objected when the French-speaking nun teach­ ing the convent school’s little French-Canadian boarders told the pupils that Mavis’s book brought from home, Lindsay’s The Joyous Travellers (which she told me was actually a children’s version of The Canterbury\n\n10 Her personal library testifies to Gallant’s intellectual curiosity and wide range of in­ terests. In the sphere of classical music alone, the concert-goer (and adept of the Bay­ reuth Festival) owned, to mention at random, the complete (trilingual) program of the now mythical Pierre Boulez/Patrice Chéreau 1979 Wagner Ring Cycle; the bilingual Fischer-Dieskau Book of Lieder (bookmarked at the Schubert/Goethe lied An Schwager Kronos); Der Rosenkavalier von Richard Strauss (the complete text in German); Cosima Wagner’s Journals (translated from German into French); Mozart’s Letters (in Emily Anderson’s original 1938 English translation); musicologist Alan Walker’s biog­ raphy Franz Liszt; and Robert Craft’s Stravinsky: Chronicle of a Friendship.\n\n8\n\nMavis Gallant: The Eye and the Ear\n\nTales), meant Les Joyeux Travailleurs. Little Mavis was deprived of food until she admitted that travellers somehow meant the same thing as work­ ers. The writer’s preoccupation with the relations between language and perception, imagination and memory, may well have originated in this violation. This discussion will investigate the superb stylist, the haunting Imagist, and the master of irony, stressing an expert use of language based on the eye and the ear. Gallant’s vision and voice, like Chaucer’s, come “from a high altitude” (Kakutani). They leave no community or mind­ set unscathed, but – l­ike those of the Samuel Beckett she frequented — never miss the absurd even in the grave and grim. The ironist’s strato­ spheric viewpoint, something she has in common with visual satirists and caricaturists, vectors both laughter and interrogation. Irony’s pragmatic function consists of signalling evaluation (Hutcheon, A Theory of Parody 53), but when the laughter remains undetected, Gallant’s irony can be taken for cold judgment. Her quiet but sustained humour rests in fact on the reader’s ear and recognition of tone, as Mavis herself confessed in a letter: “I have often been told, at readings, that this or that reader did not realise such-and-such a thing was meant to be funny until it was read aloud, by me” (Gallant, Letter to Dvorˇák, 11 October 1994). Mavis has famously identified the beginning of writing as “a jolt that unbolts the door between perception and imagination” (Gallant, “Pref­ ace,” Collected Stories 10).11 My second A for Acute encapsulates her perspicacity and wit, the sharpness of both eye and tongue required for great essayists and aphorists. “There are two races, those who tread on people’s lives, and the others” (HT 280), remarks the writer’s canny alter ego, Linnet Muir, in the Montreal of the 1940s. But Gallant unsettles readers who too quickly equate the binary with Montreal’s “two tribes” (281), or with a gender binary, the male office workers “rotting quietly until pension time” (280) and the “girls ... parked like third-class immi­ grants at the far end of the room” (293). For a hastily concluded gender binary explodes when we readers learn that the one “up on the life raft, stepping on girls’ fingers” (293) is a female superior who conceals a Polish name which would have relegated her application “to a bottom drawer” (296). Similarly, Gallant does elsewhere skewer the binary tribal politics of Montreal’s “Anglostocracy” (Weintraub 149), who believed there was “a difference in physical substance between people who spoke English exactly as [they] did, and the rest of mankind” (Gallant, My Heart Is Broken 59). But in the story under scrutiny above, “Between Zero and One,” she also depicts Montreal’s French-Canadian population before\n\n11 All my paginations refer to the 2016 edition of The Collected Stories.\n\n“Acquisitions”: mapping world and work\n\n9\n\nthe Quiet Revolution in an equally caustic manner which some contem­ porary readers might find disturbing or politically incorrect. Cohabiting with the Anglos who refused to hire people with “funny names” (HT 283), the French were trained to venerate only “the dead and defeated, ranging from General Montcalm expiring at his last battle to a large gal­ axy of maimed and crippled saints” (281). With respect to my N for Notable, Gallant occupies the puzzlingly par­ adoxical position of both centre and margin. She was the recipient of too many international awards and honours to list here, both for individual works and for her life’s work.12 With one exception (Morley Callaghan), she was the first Canadian to penetrate The New Yorker, that literary cit­ adel which, she confided to me privately, as late as the 1950s saw Cana­ dians in general as “hicks eating ice-cream in the street,” and saw Mavis herself as “a sort of Eskimo with talent.” The short story genre in the second half of the twentieth-century on the North American and international scenes was dominated by the figures of Gallant and Alice Munro, as Munro’s biographer Robert Thacker points out. Gallant began publishing in The New Yorker in 1951, and “had published over seventy stories there before Munro’s first appearance in its pages in 1977” (Thacker 188; 208, 2nd ed.). Likewise, Gallant had pub­ lished three books in the United States and the United Kingdom before Munro published her first in Canada in 1968. When Adderson compares Gallant to “that other God” (79), Munro, she declares, “Munro started out good and became great. Gallant was always great” (79). Thacker asserts Munro’s status as “the significant presence in the landscape of the Canadian short story” (189),13 while Gallant’s A Fairly Good Time, “one of the most neglected masterworks of the last century” (Orner, “Introduc­ tion” vii), along with her first novel, remained out of print for decades. Reputed to be a writers’ writer – e­ ven “a lodestar for writers from Michael Ondaatje to Russell Banks” (Cole 19), Gallant has dazzled14 but also baffled critics. Unlike Munro, she has not enjoyed the loyal follow­ ing of a wide mainstream audience for a variety of reasons, which Bar­ bara Godard and Winfried Siemerling have touched on (in “Modalities of the Edge” and “Perception, Memory, Irony” respectively), and which\n\n12 See Dvorˇák, “Like A Spoonful of Water in a River: An Appreciation of Mavis Gallant” (33). 13 Attenuated to “her leading presence” in the second edition (209). 14 When Random House published In Transit in 1989, one unnamed reviewer affirmed that “Gallant is a quietly dazzling writer, and it is tempting to pronounce this volume perfect” (“In Transit”). The choice of the term “quietly dazzling” is astute, for Gallant is never ostentatious in her virtuosity.\n\n10\n\nMavis Gallant: The Eye and the Ear\n\nJanice Kulyk Keefer has thoroughly explored (in “Strange Fashions of ­Forsaking”).15 As an expatriate addressing a global audience and en­ gaged with disquieting cityscapes in flux, Gallant was long marginalized on a Canadian literary/media scene “obsessed with national textures” (Boyagoda), even caught “in the crossfire of the Tarzanist/cosmopolitan debate in Canadian culture” (Godard 75). In one of her letters Mavis confided: For many years I avoided most visitors + did not keep track of Canadian writers (...) Don’t forget that I had thirty years of career in New York + London before Canada took an interest (sort of) in my work.16 So, I wasn’t really interested in the oatcakes of culture* in the town of Snoodle-Boodle (Alberta.) Since then Canada has truly made up for it, but I have an elephant’s memory. Memory doesn’t stop me from standing up for Canada, when decency requires it, but that is just like sticking up for my ex-husband even after we divorced. (Gallant, Letter to Dvorˇ ák, 3 May 2008, original asterisk)\n\nThe asterisk in red ink which follows “oatcakes of culture” was appar­ ently inserted when Mavis reread her letter (handwritten in blue ink). It directed me to an eloquently revealing post-script passage also added in red ink regarding a hurtful “incident in Edmonton, where (she’d) been invited to a short story conference (in the mid-seventies) + where the other writers made a point of showing disdain to the Person from Paris” (Gal­ lant, Letter to Dvorˇák, 3 May 2008). We can see that for having “laid claim to two continents,” Gallant was “for a time unclaimed by either, viewed from both perspectives to be allied with foreigners” (Helm). Her stories have been in demand by foreign audiences: new selections of her work were published in seven countries in 2009 alone. But despite glow­ ing reviews in France of her translated works,17 Gallant remained on the\n\n15 George Woodcock and David O’Rourke also raised the issue in the 1970s and 1980s, and more recently Randy Boyagoda, Stephen Henighan, Michael Helm, Russell Banks, Peter Orner (“The Way Vivid”), and Francine Prose, among others. 16 Although Robert Weaver compiled and published her first Canadian story selection, The End of the World and Other Stories in 1974, Mavis had 1979 in mind, when Macmillan finally bought the rights to publish her work (From the Fifteenth District) alongside the New York and London publishers which alone had been distributing her until then. 17 The 1970 novel, A Fairly Good Time, for instance came out in translation only in 2009, but to superlative reviews, and was placed by France Culture radio and the magazine Télérama among the top ten foreign novels of the year.\n\n“Acquisitions”: mapping world and work\n\n11\n\nedge of the French arts scene (Savigneau, “Nouvelliste Mavis Gallant” 14), unlike the highly mediatized, young and stunningly beautiful Nancy Huston, writing in French. In addition to issues of marketing and public relations, French readers dislike squirming under a satirical lens sharp­ ened by an outsider’s gaze on insider experience.18 Others simply suffer from what Gallant diagnosed in a satirical essay as a “well-known distaste for short stories” – ­a “dying art in France” (Gallant, “A Prix-view” 46).19 Critics have been divided, and readers enthused or uncomfortable, about a number of the features of Gallant’s writing which make her texts an adventure in reading. These include her free-floating vantage points – ­which British writer and critic Adam Mars Jones claims “unmoor the reader,” a “Cubist” manner of unsettling realist space-time (Ondaatje vii), and the trademark ironic vision and voice which sees and says two things at once – a­ n increasingly sustained comic vision which performs pain through farce.20 Gallant “places a huge amount of faith in her reader’s intelligence, a faith which demands and rewards careful reading” (Prose, “Introduction” xii),21 precisely because an ironic text by definition dis­ simulates its encoded directions and requires the reader to recognize and decode the unsaid22 – ­and this in “a world that seems to be growing deaf to the unsaid, if not to its power” (Hutcheon, Irony’s Edge 8). As 18 “Nothing could be more Canadian,” Godard has pointed out, than “her acerbic, detached outsider’s unveiling of the narrowness and arbitrariness of French society” (75). 19 Gallant commented on the French aversion to the short story genre to the editor of Le Monde’s book section (Savigneau, “Nouvelliste Mavis Gallant” 14) as well as in this satire on literary prizes for The New York Times. In it, she hands out a Prix des Petits Monstres for the best children’s book, a Prix Chauvin for “the finest novel written by a French-speaking foreigner,” and a short story prize meant to “encourage a dying art in France.” Her parody of the winning book also skewers French readers’ taste, nota­ bly their penchant for beginnings such as “The butcher of my little southern village is a true sage” (“A Prix-view” 46). 20 When it first came out, Elizabeth Janeway described Gallant’s novel A Fairly Good Time as “very funny and very frightening,” and identified the share of pain and pleas­ ure allotted to the reader, who cannot help “wincing with helpless laughter and horri­ fied recognition” (5). 21 Hermione Lee in 2004 calls Gallant “a paragon and a delight, a writer of the utmost subtlety,” and remarks at the same time that Gallant is “seriously underrated” or even little known by “moderately knowledgeable British readers” (Lee). One can put two and two together. 22 Frank Davey remarks as late as 2006 a continued resistance to the adventure of poetics, which he defines as the theory of how things “signify, or can be imagined to signify, or can be made to signify unanticipated meanings,” a resistance which he sur­ mises rests on “a stubborn fondness of simpler understandings of signification – ­that poets write what they mean” (174).\n\n12\n\nMavis Gallant: The Eye and the Ear\n\nMichael Helm has confessed, Gallant “produced notes of irony outside [his – ­and often our] hearing range.” On a higher general level, Gallant’s stories “require constant adaptation” because of what Tamas Dobozy has astutely termed Gallant’s “designed anarchy” (86, 85):23 stories which “very much require an altering of ‘cognition,’ of the way in which we process the text” (86). “The resemblance of Miss Gallant’s characters to most of humanity, living or dead, is far from coincidental,” notes Janeway (5). One Gallant character tears up his novel because he fails to make life “sound true” (Overhead in a Balloon 174). As does Janeway, this character in “The Colonel’s Child” gestures to the final letter T in my limping acrostic. Riv­ ers of ink have remarked on Gallant’s scrupulously accurate representa­ tions of a historically and geographically verifiable world, her eye for the telling detail which conjures up a whole life, and her depictions of the objects making up a cultural milieu, “maintained with fine and fierce exactitude” (Dorris). Yet beyond these notions of factual exactness and textured reality effect, “true” also signifies “right” (as in the right word and tone), and “genuine,” with never a false inflection – ­precisely what Mavis valued in Colette when she maintained the writer “was not false, not even when she lied” (“The Pursuit of Pleasure”). Getting it right in­ volves Gallant’s remarkable gift for capturing a voice – a­ true voice for each dissimilar character – b ­ ut also points to her ability to sustain an overarching monophony (her own recognizable voice) in the polyphonic ensemble.24 In the vein of this left-field introduction, my book blends essay with fragments of not-quite biography and memoir which disclose illumi­ nating connections, the driving principle being that “the art of a given moment must involve, as opposed to merely follow, that which has preceded it” (J. Levinson, Music, Art, & Metaphysics 4, original stresses). Well before Levinson, Hemingway had observed that a writer needs to understand and assimilate “what is available as his birth-right” and what he or she in turn must “take his departure from” (Death 169). Mavis, for instance, found Joyce’s Ulysses original and new. She inscribed Thursday 16 June 1904 (Bloomsday) on the title page of her well-thumbed copy alongside Joyce’s birth and death dates, and every year on 16 June she 23 I shall come back to Dobozy’s interesting analogy between Gallant’s “chaotic pat­ terning of language” and the musical form of “the fugue” (79) – ­which is actually anything but chaotic. 24 In this my position differs from that of the French critic Michel Fabre, who sees the authorial voice disappearing under “a polyphonic voice, a collective voice born from the overlapping of points of view” (156).\n\n“Acquisitions”: mapping world and work\n\n13\n\nwould telephone her old friend and fellow Joyce admirer in Montreal, Barbara Kilvert, to read aloud favourite passages from the novel to each other. Even after Kilvert’s death, Mavis went on reading portions of the novel on her own on Bloomsday, “usually at breakfast,” as she specified in one of our formal interviews (Gallant in Dvorˇák, “When Language” 17). Yet while her art-making dovetails with a number of Joycean pre­ dilections, it also differs profoundly, regarding the nature and limits of language itself, both as langue (pre-existing semantico-cultural system or code) and parole (the creative individual utterance or act of language) – ­the one constituting the ground for the other (Saussure). I put Gallant’s work in dialogue, then, with other international modernists (with Joyce notably serving as a foil),25 and also with those they (and she) were read­ ing, watching, and listening to – ­from the French realists to the Russians. In a piece from the restored version of Ernest Hemingway’s memoir, which I read to Mavis (affected by macular degeneration) on Christmas Eve, 2012, Hemingway confided, “at first there were the Russians; then there were all the others. But for a long time there were the Russians.” He also confided that Ezra Pound advised him to “Keep to the French” (A Moveable Feast 102). Flaubert did clearly teach Hemingway to ­excise superfluous words, and show him that rhythm was the ground of the sen­ tence. Like Hemingway and Nabokov, the young Mavis read in waves. “There was a long wave of Russian writers, in English translation of course. Chekhov, Gogol, Turgenev, Dostoevsky. That was followed by a wave of French – S­ tendhal, Flaubert, Proust” (Gallant in Hancock 21). The wave naturally also includes Balzac, as we see below when Mavis equates his protagonist Rastignac (from La Comédie humaine, notably Le Père Goriot) with Aravind Adiga’s Balram (from The White Tiger). Winfried Siemerling was the first to my knowledge to discuss at length the place of French literature in Gallant’s bicultural heritage as well as her play of referentiality with French texts in general and with Proust’s and Flaubert’s in particular.26 This book addresses the important questions of audience and cultural DNA all the while tackling challenging formal speculations in a new way. I engage with the question, How does Gallant’s work work? My method\n\n25 In addition to formal considerations comprising significant convergences and diver­ gences between Gallant and Joyce, the two writers share a strong French connection. Of all his years as an expatriate, Joyce lived longest in Paris, where Ulysses was first published in book form and where he wrote Finnegans Wake. 26 See Siemerling, “Perception, Memory, Irony: Mavis Gallant Greets Proust and Flaubert.”\n\n14\n\nMavis Gallant: The Eye and the Ear\n\noffers adventures in hands-on microanalyses: close readings paying care­ ful attention to the writer’s shining language and to what I identify as her poetics of rhythm. Drawing on the philosophy of aesthetics, it si­ multaneously discloses the congruences of her techne with film, paint­ ing, and music, also something which to my knowledge has never been done before. Literary analysis cohabits with forms of “témoignage” or witnessing, providing readers with Mavis’s backstage views on art and life, imparted throughout a twenty-year-long friendship in a shared Paris/ French habitat. Offering privileged insights into Mavis’s creative life, my discussion will naturally draw on our private conversations, telephone calls, and correspondence. Interspersed throughout the unfolding argu­ ment are excerpts from her letters or cards – ­spoken-tongue texts which move off into light, often parodic, anecdotes. Mavis, osmosis, & the Artful Dodger Hailed as “a supranational phenomenon” (Grant 31) resisting “any sort of border – p ­ olitical, sociological, or even spiritual” (Moore), Mavis jet­ tisoned a safe journalistic career in Montreal in 195027 to live and write (and perhaps starve) in the Paris she knew only through art. The modern­ ists continued to occupy the cultural spaces, some – l­ike Marcel Proust, Albert Camus, and Louis Ferdinand Céline – ­publishing even from the grave. But Mavis’s Paris was still at the heart of the genuinely new. One can call up the “gangling, spider-limbed” (Romney) French counterpart to Charlie Chaplin, Jacques Tati, (also compared to Buster Keaton and Stan Laurel), whose brilliantly original films (which I shall allude to) range from Jour de fête (1947) and Les Vacances de M. Hulot (1953) to Playtime (1967), Trafic (1971), and Parade (1973). One can also evoke the painter whose unfolding international career corresponded to and benefited by the development of the mass media. Pablo Picasso, who\n\n27 Readers may wonder how “safe” Gallant was with McCarthyism rearing its head in Canada. She was indeed left-leaning in her sympathies, but did not cover politically sensitive topics. In her feature articles in the Montreal Standard in the last half of the 1940s, she covered a broad range of societal and cultural issues ranging from war brides and libraries to progressive schools and even the question “Why Are Canadians So Dull?” She also had a weekly column about radio (entitled “On the Air”), and she reviewed books, films, and theatre. One can even say Mavis had too safe a job for her own comfort. She once told me that one of the reasons for which she decided to throw it all up was that she and the other regular journalists with bylines were going to be invited to sign up for pension plans. She felt it was time to kick up her heels or she would tie herself down into a secure bourgeois path, all traced out.\n\n“Acquisitions”: mapping world and work\n\n15\n\narguably first made the space-time continuum theory visible and inspired Gertrude Stein’s literary Cubism (and more generally, (post)modernist multiview and multivocality), may partly explain why Michael Ondaatje should observe that Gallant’s stories “feel cubist” (vii). When Stein asked Picasso to explain his Cubist art, he famously told her, “You paint not what you see but what you know is there” (Flanner, Paris Journal 3, 146). Actually, Picasso was not painting the invisible; he was painting what was concealed from his located and temporal vantage point, challenging the limits of our space-time by showing two irreconcilably disjunctive spaces synchronically. Yet rather than evoking Picasso’s earlier analytic Cubism stressing the deconstruction and fragmentation of forms (which influenced Stein), Gallant’s technique, as we shall see, is more analogous with synthetic Cubism, whose formal arrangement of lines suggests forms or even re-embraces figuration. In this permanent revolution in the arts, Picasso then would be an “acquisition” for Gallant, in the sense she explains in her well-known essay on style: For “influences” I would be inclined to substitute “acquisitions.” What they consist of, and amount to, are affected by taste and environment, prefer­ ences and upbringing (even, and sometimes particularly, when the latter has been rejected), instinctive selection. The beginning writer has to choose, tear to pieces, spit out, chew up and assimilate as naturally as a young animal – ­as naturally and as ruthlessly. (“Style?” 37)28\n\nThe concurrent retrospectives of Picasso’s work Mavis would have seen and chewed up at the Louvre and the Bibliothèque Nationale in 1955 and then again at the Grand Palais in 1966 comprised many paintings never seen before. Some, like Les Demoiselles au bord de la Seine, d’après Courbet (1950), and Picasso’s series of variations on Eugène Delacroix’s Les Femmes d’Alger [Women of Algiers] (1834), illustrate my thesis that the modernists (and postmodernists) delight in intertextual and intermedial borrowings and dialogical responses. An omnivorous reader as well as an art-lover, Mavis confessed in a Le Monde interview to having, when young, chewed up and assimilated the French writer Anatole France (who was a model for both Apollinaire29 and the young Proust (Karpeles; Muhlstein,\n\n28 Gallant’s chewing up or spitting out bring Hemingway once more to mind, namely when the early modernist asserts that great writers are born “with an intelligence to accept or reject what is already presented as knowledge” (Death 168). 29 “Apollinaire set out to duplicate Anatole France, his model, and failed magnificently,” declared Cocteau to William Fifield (Cocteau).\n\n16\n\nMavis Gallant: The Eye and the Ear\n\nThe Pen and the Brush).30 She recognized the imprint, astonished, when one of her stories was translated into French and the original Anatole France phrase (in French) lay there unfolded and complete (Savigneau, “Mavis Gallant, nouvelles intimes” 3). In an interesting analogy, Proust knowingly or unknowingly “went so far as to plant real France sentences in passages of [his invented writer] Bergotte’s prose” (Tadié qtd in Tahourdin). Mavis and I often talked about such osmosis, which we detected stretching out to contemporary writing in India. When I gave her Anita Desai’s In Custody (1984), she found it Chekhovian. When I gave her Aravind Adiga’s 2008 Man Booker Prize–winning The White Tiger, she enthusiastically collocated it with Balzac and Dickens, astutely decrypt­ ing authorial intent. Paris, 9 May 2009 Dear Marta, ... The White Tiger is so gripping that I wanted it never to end and when it did I hoped the Indian Artful Dodger would never be caught (how would31 Dickens have handled it, by the way?) + the Indian Rastignac would marry well + get away with murder. And that he will not just simply turn into the Indian Al Capone ... With love, M. xx\n\nMavis wrote again a week later, sending along with her note an article on Adiga in French from Le Monde magazine, which she had clipped out and annotated. Paris Tuesday 19 May (2009) Dear Marta, I’m sending this on because you may not have seen it. And because of a rare sort of coincidence: I wrote to you mentioning Balzac + Dickens, “Rastignac”\n\n30 Mavis stayed on top of contemporary publications, too. On arriving in Paris, she read Marguerite Yourcenar’s Mémoires d’Hadrien (1951), just out, with three years to go before the English translation [Memoirs of Hadrian]. When in London in 1956 she bought Thomas Mann’s freshly translated Confessions of Felix Krull, Confidence Man (1955), which appeared only a year after the original novel was published in German. 31 Underlined by Gallant.\n\n“Acquisitions”: mapping world and work\n\n17\n\n+ “the Artful Dodger.” At the end of this interview (p. 46) Adiga says, “... j’ai l’impression que le Paris de Balzac comme le L ­ ondres de Dickens ressemblent au Bombay d’aujourd’hui ...”32 William Maxwell – ­my New Yorker editor33 – ­believed that literary coincidences floated in the air + were picked up by unwitting writers. xx M.\n\nThe Paris Mavis crossed an ocean for certainly captured what was “floating in the air.” It was where the Hungarian and Russian composers Béla Bartók and Igor Stravinsky met the year Gallant was born, and also where and when Vladimir Mayakovsky attended Marcel Proust’s funeral. When Mavis moved there, the city was still the site of a transnational interaction among the visual arts, music, the performing arts, and litera­ ture – fi ­ elds all preoccupied by subjectivity and perception. Composers set texts to music, poets wrote on painting, painters absorbed cinematic tech­ niques or turned to fiction, dance and literature deserted story for abstract sound, and all vibrated to the sound of jazz. Verbal practices have often influenced the non-verbal media of painting, music, and dance, but the influence has also been reciprocal or even the other way round. The spiral­ ling Finnegans Wake, which Umberto Eco saw as an Einsteinian universe bending back on itself (Role of the Reader 54), drew fiction towards the pure sound of musical composition. Yet Joyce’s earlier multiple viewpoints and abrogation of temporal linearity can be traced to the Cubist rupture with traditional figuration and spatial perspective, and it is tempting to argue that the medium calling the tune may well have been the visual arts. the medium calling the tune? Russell Banks has remarked that Gallant’s oeuvre gives readers the same shock of self-recognition that we feel before “the atmosphere of 32 In this interview with Frédéric Joignot, Adiga confessed to admiring the great French realists Balzac, Maupassant, Flaubert, and Zola, and declared (quoted by Mavis) that Balzac’s Paris, like Dickens’s London, resembled today’s Bombay (Adiga, “L’Inde démocratique 46). Interestingly, in his introduction to the 2006 edition of Midnight’s Children, Salman Rushdie, too, acknowledges his debt to Dickens for “his great rot­ ting Bombay-like city, and his ability to root his larger-than-life characters and surre­ alist imagery in a sharply observed, almost hyper-realist background, out of which the comic and the fantastic elements of his work seemed to grow organically, becoming intensifications of, and not escapes from, the real world” (Rushdie, “Introduction” xii). 33 With The New Yorker then at the epicentre of American literature, Maxwell was also the editor of writers such as J.D. Salinger, Eudora Welty, Vladimir Nabokov, Frank O’Connor, and John Cheever.\n\n18\n\nMavis Gallant: The Eye and the Ear\n\na painting by Edward Hopper or a Duke Ellington orchestral suite” (x). Mavis had never known a world without books and paintings and music. She grew up with painters and pictures, including moving pictures. Ma­ vis’s Christmas and birthday gifts when she was small would be books from her mother and a new box of paints from her father, who – l­ike Cocteau’s – p ­ ainted and frequented painters. Looking back, she confided that her father’s style (in the 1920s) was Impressionist, rather like Ar­ mand Guillaumin’s. She often alluded to how her father would hold her up before pictures to point out the multiple tints making up a colour. She would also evoke the sensual pleasures of mixing her paints for her own watercolours. Never happier than in an artist’s studio, Gallant can be said to exemplify the osmosis between literature and visual culture. Heming­ way claimed to have learned things from Paul Cézanne. I infer that these were the reduction of form and the unsettling of traditional perspective – ­effectively connecting painting with notions of literary vantage point (Hemingway, A Moveable Feast 23, 71). In a similar instance of osmosis from the pictorial to the verbal medium, Picasso, who alongside others like Marcel Duchamp exploded the spatial perspective which Cézanne had unsettled,34 can partly account for the floating, multiple perspectives of Gallant’s stories, realist in a fraught way but “cubist in their angles and qualifications” (Ondaatje vii). My approach to Gallant transcends the classic focus pairing litera­ ture with the arts,35 and it plugs into the recent rise in visual studies\n\n34 Duchamp’s Cubist-Futurist Nu descendant l’escalier [Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2] caused shock waves at New York’s Armory Show in 1913. But Cézanne had already isolated left-eye and right-eye views and showed both at the same time. His deconstruction of binocular vision defied traditional linear perspective grounded in the simultaneous processing carried out by the visual cortex of the brain. 35 Brad Bucknell’s Literary Modernism and Musical Aesthetics: Pater, Pound, Joyce, and Stein (2001), among the twenty-first century’s first inter-art, mixed media forays, knowledgeably investigates verbal-music interchange (such as Ezra Pound’s opera score on François Villon, and Stéphane Mallarmé’s endeavour to collapse into ­music’s unmeaning). Michael Fried’s Flaubert’s “Gueuloir.” On “Madame Bovary” and “Salammbô” (2012) puts forward analogies between Flaubert and Courbet, arguing that the writer’s description of Emma’s funeral cortège in Madame Bovary (1856) was inspired by, and was intended to surpass, Courbet’s shockingly realistic monumental picture Un Enterrement à Ornan [A Burial at Ornans] (1850), twice exhibited in Paris (1851 and 1855). Anka Muhlstein’s The Pen and the Brush: How Passion for Art Shaped Nineteenth-Century French Novels (2017) culturally explores the relations of five major nineteenth-century novelists (including Flaubert and Maupassant but also a chronological exception: Proust) with the works of fine art displayed at the Louvre as well as with the contemporary painters they frequented.\n\n“Acquisitions”: mapping world and work\n\n19\n\nand sound studies. Identifying Gallant as a late modernist figure at the juncture of multiple, interacting fields also connects with the thrust of twenty-first century modernist studies – ­an international movement of scholars rethinking spatial and temporal circulation and the transna­ tional, cross-disciplinary flow of ideas. My central thesis breaks with the nationalist and geographical restraints which have until recently marked the field, and provides a departure-point for researchers new to the split with a traditional cartography which excludes from the modernist canon works which occurred “too early or too late” (Ross and Lindgren 19).36 This book is the logical outcome of my intellectual as well as personal relation with Mavis, and of long reflection, sustained throughout my (often collaborative) research and writing. Tropes and Territories (2007, edited with W.H. New) engages with the short story genre across cultural divides, while Crosstalk: Canadian and Global Imaginaries in Dialogue (2012, with Diana Brydon), uses the device of crosstalk as a metaphor “for the ways in which audial and visual imaginaries interact to create complex forms of interference” (Brydon and Dvorˇák 1). Translocated Modernisms: Paris and Other Lost Generations (2016, with Emily Ballan­ tyne and Dean Irvine) approaches a number of late modernist C ­ anadian visual artists and writers through the network of transnational exchanges they experienced in Paris. Its opening chapter, my personal appreciation of Gallant and her oeuvre, opened up the spaces of investigation for this book. Mavis loved pictures, films, and music, high and low. She shared Proust’s fascination with the visual arts and music and their relationship with lit­ erature. She liked the way the painter and writer Eric ­Karpeles turned John Ruskin’s comment about the Venetians inside out to fit Proust, the writer she reread most, who told Cocteau in a letter, “My book is a paint­ ing” (Karpeles 10). If, according to Proust’s idol Ruskin, painting was the way the Venetians wrote, then “writing was the way Proust painted” (20). Karpeles’s Paintings in Proust: A Visual Companion to “In Search\n\n36 The following examples can be invoked. Richard J. Lane and Miguel Mota’s collection of essays, Malcolm Lowry’s Poetics of Space (2016), addresses Lowry’s relations with photography, film, and jazz. In Disciplining Modernism (2010), Pamela Caughie’s authors engage with disciplines ranging from architecture, design, and technology to fashion and film. The contributors of Stephen Ross and A.C. Lindgren’s The Modernist World (2015) map global modernisms according to their geopolitical locations (and their place on the axis of postcoloniality) as well as their disciplinary parameters. Charles A. Riley’s Free as Gods: How the Jazz Age Reinvented Modernism (2017) engages with the interconnections among the artists, writers, and musicians who con­ verged in Paris during the Jazz Age.\n\n20\n\nMavis Gallant: The Eye and the Ear\n\nof Lost Time” (2008), which Mavis was so delighted with that she gave me a copy for my birthday,37 engages referentially with the collaborative visual substructure of Proust’s verbal art. The author has tracked down and reproduced for those with less of a mind’s eye (or visual culture) than Proust the pictures to which he makes profuse allusions. In the same vein, Lesley Clement’s Learning to Look: A Visual Response to Mavis Gallant’s Fiction (2000) was the first to relate Gallant’s literary texts to visual art. why Degas? Breaking free of Riley’s early modernist time frame and Ross and Lin­ gren’s sweeping geopolitical approach, this book also goes beyond Karpeles’s pairing of word with image and Muhlstein’s thematic crosso­ ver, which privileges the role of painters as characters in the plots under scrutiny, as well as the novelists’ painterly erudition and love of ekphra­ sis. Similarly, this discussion goes beyond Clement’s Gallant-based com­ parative approach with painting, which, like Karpeles’s, concerns itself not so much with a dialogical relation, but rather with learnedly iden­ tifying the pictures Gallant may hypothetically have had in mind when making her painterly allusions.38 These are legion. Barbara, all white and gold and pink, is told in “The Remission” that she is “like a Fragonard” or “a Boucher” (Paris Stories 221): pictures which point me not to the writer’s evident knowledge of visual culture, but to her method of signi­ fying obliquely. They notably overlay peep show voluptuousness onto the role of an English wife and mother not as devastated by her husband’s fatal illness as she could be.39 Sylvie in “The Cost of Living” ought to be\n\n37 Karpeles in turn greatly admired Gallant’s work. After meeting her in 2010, he sent her a grateful letter along with a book (Japanese Portraits) by Donald Richie, in which Karpeles found a fellow sensibility (wry, acerbic, and compassionate) as well as a somewhat parallel path in life, Richie’s Japan to Gallant’s France. 38 Clement for instance comments on the opening sentence of Gallant’s short novel, Its Image on the Mirror, notably its reference to “gesticulating people” in “those crowded religious paintings that tell a story” (My Heart Is Broken 57). According to Clement, the painterly allusions “could have in mind the pointing John the Baptist and other demonstrative gestures of the Crucifixion panels of the Isenheim altarpiece in its closed state” (266). 39 Mavis confided that this story (published in 1979) was haunted by her own mother. In the earlier, more openly autobiographical story, “In Youth Is Pleasure” (1975), the narrator deploys a dense chiasmus to configure her young, dying father and equally young, unfaithful mother: “he was ill and he couldn’t hide it; she had a lover and didn’t try” (HT 265, original italics).\n\n“Acquisitions”: mapping world and work\n\n21\n\ndrawn, no, has been drawn, we are told: she is “the coarse and grubby Degas dancer, the girl with the shoulder thrown back and the insolent chin” who for two pins “would stick out her tongue or spit in your face;” Sylvie, to boot, has “the voice you imagine belonging to the picture” (­Going Ashore 177; Cost of Living 207).40 Where others might provide an inventory of the Degas dancer pictures, I ask, why Degas? With his decentred figures, oblique, high-angle or low-angle vantage points influenced by Japanese art, Degas had destroyed traditional West­ ern perspective. As the philosopher Nelson Goodman points out, “When Degas painted a woman seated near the edge of the picture, and looking out of it, he defied traditional standards of composition but offered by example a new way of seeing, of organizing experience” (Worldmaking 137). Gertrude Stein was clearly intent on achieving an analogous ­effect. She destabilized traditional modes of identification in a work whose title alone announces a collision of hybrid sidestepping of voice, The ­Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas (1933), and in which she attributed her literary formation to her links with the pre–First World War paint­ ers’ milieu. Mavis, too, enjoyed the company of painters over that of writers, and I want to investigate her formal “fit” as a writer with De­ gas’s painterly practice. I can also offer a parallel musical analogy, nota­ bly the common overtones in design, representation, and structuring of ­experience produced through the materiality of line, diction, rhythm, and harmonics. “The Doctor” begins with a biting satirical commentary on Luke Fildes’s social moralist genre painting, The Doctor, and other edi­ fying “Victorian miseries” (VE 69) in which sign-laden composition and message-loaded detail rest on the standard judgment and habit which have naturalized them, and serve only to preach and persuade predict­ ably. This is at opposite poles from the poetics which inform Gallant’s writing, which seeks the unusual frame of reference that reveals fresh aspects of reality. The protagonists of “In the Tunnel” visit an abandoned, out-of-the-way chapel in the mountains near Nice, which contains fres­ coes of what they take to be the Last Judgment, the life of Jesus, and “Judas after he hung himself” (HT 106). I can factually point out that this is the medieval chapel of Notre-Dame-des-Fontaines, a pilgrimage sanctuary in a borderland long disputed between Italy and France, which is covered by Giovanni Canavesio’s fifteenth-century fresco cycle of the Passion, which includes a Judas Iscariot. Facts aside, Gallant’s characters are embarrassed by Christ, but enthused by the hanged Judas with, to\n\n40 Regarding quotations, this much-quoted story collection will henceforth be designated as GA; the name Gallant will be understood.\n\n22\n\nMavis Gallant: The Eye and the Ear\n\nboot, his guts spilling out.41 I, too, am more interested in the grotesque realism presented pictorially by Canavesio and verbally by Gallant, in a graphic ekphrastic echo that gives voice to a mute art object, then spins off on a life of its own. I find it valuable to call attention to important parallels, and interlock my analysis with discussions of Gallant’s special brand of realism as well as her rhetorical mastery, notably her art of sink­ ing and rising again. I have given random examples pointing to the vast extent of ­Mavis’s visual culture, which it is not my purpose to prove. Yet again, but in a wider sense, why Degas? When I make parallels between picto­ rial representation and Gallant’s verbal denotation, it is for their effi­ cacy in clarifying certain obscurities or lighting up certain subtleties in meaning-making which do not correlate with a more accustomed system of representation. My book is grounded in how modernity’s linguistic and non-linguistic aesthetic systems meet head-on and commingle, and it engages with the new literary techniques resulting from the reciprocal dynamics, of which ekphrasis is but one component. I home in by iden­ tifying the painterly eye and formal painterly dynamics which are the cornerstones for certain writing practices, notably the ground of verbal as well as visual irony and caricature. But I also radiate out by discussing the intermedial dynamics and creative collaborations of the transcontinental cultural context which nourished Gallant. The cross-pollination or osmo­ sis is visible in Samuel Beckett’s now iconic play En Attendant Godot. First staged in Paris in 1953 shortly after Mavis’s arrival, it felt “Russian, though done in the Irish manner and spoken in French” (Flanner 1: 198). The period’s taste for mixing is literally embodied in French filmmaker Robert Bresson’s practice of privileging the soundtrack even more than the image track (Interviews 240), and of identifying the final process of editing or mixing as “the truly creative act” – ­“the moment when all of a film’s elements, sound and visual, are put in contact with one another, are acting upon one another, and become transformed” (199). My method will thus involve confronting Gallant’s writings with a variety of other international productions which are not necessarily direct influences, but which participate in what she identified as “the distillation of a lifetime of reading and listening, of selection and rejection” (“Style” 37), and which can serve a valuable exegetical function. I notably engage with the\n\n41 The focalizer, Sarah, goes so far as to filch a postcard reproduction of the hanged ­figure. I have the same Judas postcard in a drawer from when I passed through following a conference in Nice, as did Mavis when she spent time in her well-loved ­Menton region. See The Hanged Judas image on page 61.\n\n“Acquisitions”: mapping world and work\n\n23\n\nconfluences of writing – ­her writing – ­with the musical developments and the moving pictures that shaped her and her generation. Mavis, the (moving) pictures, & music Mavis and F.W. Murnau’s masterpiece of German expressionism, ­Nosferatu, were born the same year (1922), and she and the cinema grew up together. Even more intensely than Nosferatu,42 Murnau’s painterly Faust (1926)43 deploys jaw-dropping chiaroscuro images animated by dynamic framing which operate in the double registers of splendour and horror, realism and the fantastic, the grotesque and the abstract. Along with Wallace Worsley’s gothic The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923) and Henri Fescourt’s poignant Les Misérables (1925), they were among the earliest silent motion pictures the small Mavis had been taken to see. She confided how the immediacy of their huge images on the big screen, shot in darkness and light, made her reel with pleasurable shock. The image would become the catalyst of her creative imagination.44 Yet the cinema, plastic art in motion, involved the collaboration of radically different fields, from music and architecture to the decorative arts and costume design. It is valuable to remember that while silent films had no soundtrack, they were rarely projected in silence. Nosferatu and Faust for instance came with scores authorized by Murnau, meant to be performed by an orchestra (or piano) during the screening. Gustav Hinrichs, for instance, composed the accompanying musical score to Rupert Julian’s Phantom of the Opera (1925). In 2015, the composer and pianist Jean-François Zygel improvised live during the first screening of the digitally restored version of Fescourt’s Les Misérables at Paris’s Théâtre du Châtelet. In 2019 Zygel composed and performed (with a small ensemble back-up) an instrumental piece with choral fragments to accompany a screening of Murnau’s Nosferatu at Paris’s Philharmonie. As Zygel was aware, all this programmatic music was designed from the\n\n42 Nosferatu was released in the United States in 1929, encountering immediate critical and box office success. 43 Faust has been likened to a walking Albrecht Dürer or a Pieter Brueghel (the Elder), but is arguably more in congruence with the work of Hieronymus Bosch. 44 As a young journalist working for the Montreal Standard, Mavis began to run ­photo-stories of books she read, such as Gabrielle Roy’s Bonheur d’occasion (1945), yet to be translated as The Tin Flute (1947) and still unknown to her Anglo read­ ers. She thought of those pictures as “stills from a film” (Gallant, “Afterword,” Paris ­Stories 372), and the fiction which she had already begun to write was always trig­ gered by a fixed image she famously likened to a “freeze frame” (375).\n\n24\n\nMavis Gallant: The Eye and the Ear\n\nstart to buttress the visual symphony of images, intensify the atmosphere and emotion, and nudge viewers towards a desired, denoted interpreta­ tion in a way the intertitles never could.45 So the cultural matrix which nourished Mavis also comprised music, an art which holds salient dif­ ferences with respect to the other aesthetic systems, but which is equally concerned with perceptual and conceptual underpinnings.46 My zooming out also involves this ubiquitous non-linguistic aesthetic system which can stand alone completely outside denotation, but which finds itself at the core of the performing arts47 and even of literary composition. My pairing of literature with music is in fact natural in that music, as Proust points out, is also “sine materia” (Du côté de chez Swann [The Way by Swann’s] 250).48 Unlike the visual arts, in other words, literature and music are “nonphysical arts” in which there is “no physical ‘thing’ that one can plausibly take to be the artwork itself” (J. Levinson, Music, Art, & Metaphysics 63). A dynamics of breakage gained momentum, part of a generalized modernist air du temps. From Duchamp’s Nu descendant un escalier49 [Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2] T.S. Eliot’s The Waste Land, and John Dos Passos’s Manhattan Transfer, poets were shattering traditional metrical patterns, novelists exploding the conventions of literary real­ ism, and visual artists accelerating the atomization of the Impression­ ists via analytic and synthetic Cubism and their derivatives, such as machine-age-mad Futurism and Constructivism.50 Since the premiere\n\n45 It was actually the advent of the soundtrack that invented silence, as Bresson points out (Notes on the Cinematograph). With the rise of audiovisual cinema, Bresson was one of the few filmmakers to use music (as opposed to sonic objects) sparingly (rather than as constant accompaniment), to “add a value and a significance to the images that they do not have on their own” (Interviews 201). 46 Pierre Boulez has noted that Wagner’s music – post-romantic and arguably protomodernist – i­s the first to stress indeterminacy; the philosopher Theodor Adorno claimed the composer elevated ambiguity to a principle of style, while Linda and Michael Hutcheon perceive “an ordering impulse” both articulated and undermined (Opera: Desire, Disease, Death 92–3). 47 While Mavis loved pure, abstract music, she also enjoyed opera, which as Linda and Michael Hutcheon note, is a “most impure” art form, owing its power to “its com­ bining the musical and the dramatic, the aural and the visual, the emotional and the intellectual” (Opera 1) 48 Formerly translated as Swann’s Way, this is the first volume of Proust’s À la recherche du temps perdu [In Search of Lost Time], formerly translated as Remembrance of Things Past. 49 The French is the original title. 50 Being machine-mad was actually not new, as demonstrates Henry Purcell’s “Wondrous Machine!” movement in Ode to St Cecilia (1692).\n\n“Acquisitions”: mapping world and work\n\n25\n\nof Stravinsky’s seismically dissonant, percussive Le Sacre du printemps [The Rite of Spring] (1913), which Cocteau identified as the detonator of the art revolution,51 composers, too, were breaking down classical harmony and fracturing the melodic line in sundry ways: disjunctive leaps (rather than the proximal ordering of scales and arpeggios), disso­ nant augmented and diminished intervals (rather than consonant major thirds and perfect fifths of tonic-median-dominant combinations), syn­ copation destabilizing the rhythmic or metrical beat, serialism, aleatory or chance music, and the atonal and twelve-tone systems. All rebelled against a perceived tyranny of conventional timbres, rhythms, and tuning systems. The Well-Tempered Microphone showed technology could even replace the musical instruments it had been invented to enhance. With La Bien-Aimée [The Beloved] (1928), a rearrangement of piano pieces by Schubert and Liszt, Darius Milhaud had already composed for orchestra and player piano – a­ piano giving the performer multiple hands, capable of playing eighty-eight notes at once.52 Mavis’s painter father had taught her how to see, and her painter’s eye is manifest in the slightest tossed-off essay. It radiates from a parenthet­ ical remark distinguishing Pissarro’s kind of white from Utrillo’s: “The most truthful painter of the Paris winter is Pissarro. Not Utrillo; you will never see his particular kind of white, not even after a snowfall” (Gallant, “Paris When It Shimmers”). It also glows in her descriptions. Paris in November is “an opaque gray” calling up “old spider webs, or the floor covering at Beaubourg, or the outer walls of the Swedish Embassy on Rue Barbet de Jouy.” The Tuileries are “gray-white with a wash of pink,” and at night the reddish light on clouds and snow is “like a decanter of wine with a light behind it” (“Paris When It Shimmers”).53 In addition, Mavis’s pictorial experience is such that she often sees people and surroundings through the filter of art. In A Fairly Good Time we are told that behind\n\n51 Although Bartók actually beat Stravinsky to it (having composed his radically percus­ sive and dissonant tritone-based Allegro barbaro in 1911), it took time for the West to discover his work. Cocteau declared in his interview with Fifield that the Russian composer was the “chief architect” of the art revolution, notably that “Everything began, finally, you see, with Stravinsky’s Sacre. The Sacre du printemps reversed everything” (Cocteau). 52 I attended the first contemporary revival of the original concert version of Milhaud’s ballet score at the Paris Philharmonie in 2016. Like the modernists before me, I found the piano roll technology’s magnitude of sound electrifying. 53 George Woodcock was among the first to identify in Gallant’s work “the marvellous painterly surface of the scene imagined through the translucent veil of words,” deriv­ ing from “a close and highly visual sense of the interrelationship of sharply observed detail” (74) – i­n other words, a sense of composition.\n\n26\n\nMavis Gallant: The Eye and the Ear\n\nthe protagonist Shirley there are “plane trees and a Sisley sky” (25). The omniscient narrator also remarks that Shirley sits “like a widow by Vuil­ lard,” explaining the pictorial simile with another drawn from the every­ day world of money and underwear: “like someone with her life’s savings sewn up in her corsets” (224). Shirley herself sees her world through the same filter of art, remarking when she first meets her fiancé’s mother and sister that these are “Goya people” (27).54 On the other hand, it was Mavis’s musician husband who taught her how to listen.55 She learned to listen so well that she soon admired com­ posers like Bartók, Stravinsky, Shostakovich, and Hindemith, who de­ veloped new ways of listening to the world and relating to it sensually and cognitively. Contemporary music’s privileging of atonality, serialism, dissonance, and disjunctive sound sequences took part in modernity’s aesthetics of decentring and dislocation. Actually, jazz and its ground, the blues form – ­which fascinated composers from Erik Satie and Maurice Ravel to Stravinsky and Arthur Honegger – h ­ ad done much of the dis­ locating in an analogous fashion to the Cubist rupture with traditional figuration and spatial perspective. By the time Mavis settled in Paris, con­ cert tours by Dizzy Gillespie and Count Basie had whipped the French passion for jazz white-hot. As Janet Flanner remarked to her New Yorker readership, “French jazz-hot fans are as intellectual in talking of swingue as if they were discussing Schoenberg” (Flanner 1: 215, original stresses). borderblur Halfway through the twentieth century, when Mavis was beginning to write and publish,56 the Ballets Russes’s Leonid Massine had further 54 When living in Madrid, the young Mavis spent much time in the Prado, notably going “Back to Goya.” She relates in an extract from her Journals, “I go back and back, and still he is haunting and terrifying” (“The Hunger Diaries” 50). 55 Nineteen-year-old Mavis met the young pianist John Gallant at the apartment of ­mutual friends who had recordings and piano reductions of Shostakovich’s work. Johnny sat down and played the Shostakovich Fifth. Asked if she liked it, she ­answered, “there’s no melody,” but “Johnny said, it’s full of melody. It’s you who doesn’t know how to listen” (Gallant in Dvorˇák, “When Language” 13). 56 “Thank You for the Lovely Tea,” published in The New Yorker in 1956, was actually written in 1940 when Mavis was only eighteen. Other stories such as “Jorinda and Jorindel” and “Up North” were also written in the 1940s and were re-excavated from the family picnic hamper containing her material a decade later, to be published in The New Yorker between 1954 and 1959. Like “Saturday,” set in early 1960s Montreal, and the other stories collected in Home Truths, as the author points out in her intro­ duction to the original edition (unfortunately not reproduced in the 2001 edition), each of them “needs to be read against its own time” (“An Introduction” HT xiii).\n\n“Acquisitions”: mapping world and work\n\n27\n\ntransformed the performing arts by creating borderblur symphonic bal­ lets. These moved away from mimed narrative to abstract movement vis­ ualizing pure (unprogrammatic) music. Converging with the anti-mimetic agenda of the Cubists, dance putting music into visible form found its literary counterparts in the experimental modernism of writers like Stein and Joyce. As she related in The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, Stein had posed ninety times for her portrait only to have the young Picasso paint her head out. He did finish it later without her – b ­ rushing off complaints that Stein didn’t look like that by saying, she will – ­but Stein responded with a verbal portrait of Picasso entitled “If I Told Him, A Completed Portrait of Picasso” (1924).57 Her anti-mimetic poem trans­ lates the Cubist phenomenological and aesthetic agenda into abstract language. It volatilizes the rational premises of the classic art of portrai­ ture based on resemblance and, – j­ust as the symphonic ballet eschews gestural meaning – e­ mpties the composition of discursive meaning in ­favour of pure sound. Luigi Russolo’s Futurist manifesto The Art of Noise (1913) broke down the boundaries between denotational and non-denotational aes­ thetic fields and was arguably at the bottom of Stein’s linguistic liberation from signifying. The Futurist ambition to unite music, language, and noise promoted the inclusion of urban and industrial noise in musical compo­ sitions,58 and would provide the backdrop to French filmmaker Jacques Tati’s use of speech as mere sound. Tati would mix the voices down and meld the dialogue – ­both fragmented and multilingual59 so as to signify nothing (see Trafic [1971]) – w ­ ith the concrete music of his post-synched sound and the plonks and buzzes of our sonic machine environment. I sense a close intermedial analogy between Gallant’s oeuvre and the “unsettling detached oddness” (Romney) of Tati. The analogy may seem paradoxical considering the deliberate wordlessness of ­Tati’s aesthetic agenda, or rather his choice to use speech as just another element of\n\n57 See Stein’s own reading of “If I Told Him, A Completed Portrait of Picasso” (1924), available online. 58 One can evoke Cocteau, Picasso, and Satie’s Cubist ballet Parade (1917) and its noise-making instruments (typewriter, milk bottles, and foghorn), George Antheil’s Mechanical Ballet for Pianos, Percussion, and Airplane Engine (1924), composed to accompany Fernand Léger’s experimental film on mechanical technology, Ballet mécanique [The Mechanical Ballet] (1924). Also notable is Edgard Varèse’s Ionisation (1931) for a percussion ensemble including sirens (see May), which a critic covering the premiere in Carnegie Hall called “a sock in the jaw” (Staff). 59 Art Buchwald notably provided the fragments of English dialogue for Playtime.\n\n28\n\nMavis Gallant: The Eye and the Ear\n\nmodern urban space’s white noise, but the filmmaker, who in Mon Oncle (1958) makes a gimmicky automatic garage door look like a Venus fly­ trap snapping shut, provides a visual key to the narrative sleights-of-hand and tonal shifts with which Gallant destabilizes. The Futurist manifesto also probably triggered Joyce’s use of onomatopoeic compressions (“Are you off? Yrfmstbyes. Blmstup”) and even noises instead of signifiers: “Will lift your tschink with tschunk. Fff! Oo! ... Rrrpr. Kraa. Kraandl. … My eppripfftaph. Be pfrwritt” (Ulysses 285, 256). I have already evoked how Mavis enjoyed giving voice to Joyce’s game-playing, but we shall see further on whether Mavis would find lines which dispense with meaning “a sock in the jaw” or rather “linguistic taradiddles” (“An Introduction” HT, xviii). The border-blurring of musical theatre shows like Guys and Dolls (which Mavis saw in London shortly after it premiered in the West End), Singin’ in the Rain, and West Side Story – ­which built on Massine’s way of stylizing movement – ­was what ballet-lover Mavis found “a sock in the jaw.” She found them “new”60 precisely because they merged drama and music just as they melded song and speech, natural movement and dance. In choreographer Jerome Robbins’s cross-cultural but also culture-specific West Side Story, his expropriated Capulets and Mon­ tagues run, snap their fingers, play ball, fight, and die in back-alleys and vacant lots. While watching the DVDs, Mavis and I would marvel at how one can never isolate the precise moment when the ordinary move­ ments, stretched and amplified, become dance, or when – ­calling up Louis ­Armstrong’s scat singing – ­the ordinary speech in the untrained mouths of dancers61 becomes song.\n\n60 Mavis and I would watch the DVDs of these musicals when diabetes-induced ailments stopped her from leaving her apartment. Singin’ in the Rain’s double time slot spoke to her. Released in 1952 when the freshly expatriate Gallant was publishing her first stories in The New Yorker, it is set in 1927 during the dawn of the sound revolution she had experienced first-hand. The parodic depiction of the birth pains of synchro­ nized sound (which she broached in her fiction, as I shall show), complete with the technological glitches of out-of-sync lines and over-magnified or extraneous noise, always provoked her delight. 61 Those who could both sing and dance often could not act, and vice versa. Natalie Wood playing the role of Maria in Jerome Robbins’s film version of West Side Story managed to sing only a part of Leonard Bernstein’s challenging contrapuntal Alban Berg–like duo with Anita from the Broadway version, “A Boy Like That”/“I Have a Love.” Mavis wanted to hear all about the stage revival I attended at the Paris Théâtre du Châtelet in 2012 (choreographed by Joey McKneely, former assistant to Jerome Robbins), and was delighted to learn the whole song had been restored.\n\n“Acquisitions”: mapping world and work\n\n29\n\nbeyond our current way of seeing I have evoked the multiple border-crossings of this book, namely geo­ graphical/transnational and interdisciplinary/intermedial. Intermedial dialogues and analogies illuminated by real-life considerations have begun to thread their way through this book and will continue to irrigate this discussion, which dares to question some currently fashionable po­ sitions. Touched on in this introductory chapter, the questions which can go against the grain range from an artwork’s intrinsic features and its essence (whether nebulous, flexible, or less so), to its relations with the general climate, notably the “repository of art” existing at the time of creation or earlier, since art “has no content beyond what art has been” (J. Levinson, Music, Art, & Metaphysics 7). As Julia Kristeva, too, reminds us, any text – i­n the broad sense of cultural product – i­s “the absorp­ tion and transformation of another” (Desire in Language 66). Seen in this way, the word on Gallant’s page is also oriented towards, nourished by, and inseparable from her whole habitat. I investigate how Mavis positions herself with respect to the temperature of life, to intermedial modernist currents which stress process (over product),62 privilege sound (over sense), foreground craft, and identify writing, like the other arts, as performance. I shall show how her art-making is intercultural, transna­ tional, and multifarious, but also profoundly individual and distinctive. “Is it dead or alive?” This is the question that Gallant used as a yard­ stick to measure a work of art. What makes her own prose so alive?63 Can one circumscribe “the inborn vitality and tension of living prose” (“Style” 6) such as hers the way one identifies style in non-verbal fields such as painting and music? Or such as film, which Bresson defines as “a writing with images in movement and with sounds” (Notes 7)? Is it harder to displace a word to restore its freshness than to displace an eye to “make a portrait jump into life,” as Cocteau claims?64 How does\n\n62 Umberto Eco even designates Joyce’s Finnegans Wake as one giant metaphor “for the process of unlimited semiosis” (Role 70). 63 “It grows like a living thing,” Mavis remarked in her 1952 diary about the novel she was working on, which she also referred to as “this bird in my mind” (and which later died on her) (“Hunger Diaries” 51). 64 Interestingly, when Bresson affirms that an “image is comparable to a word in a ­sentence,” he joins Cocteau by observing that “the most commonly employed word, the most worn, when used in the right place, will suddenly take on an extraordinary brilliance” (Bresson xii). The Bressonian principle of non-performance with its hall­ mark deadpan deliveries ensures that no appended expression should divert us from the word stripped to the bone.\n\n30\n\nMavis Gallant: The Eye and the Ear\n\nGallant create this “freshness” and this “extraordinary brilliance”? What are her writerly equivalents of the painterly collision which, in Cocteau’s words, “gives the sense of multiview”? With the issue of “acquisitions” now solidly underpinning my investi­ gation, these are the issues of style which my second chapter tackles and the third develops. I address how Gallant’s expert use of language – ­like that of the Imagists and Vorticists – s­ prings from spoken-tongue yet po­ etic prose grounded in precision and clarity and resting on both the eye and the ear.65 I argue that Gallant’s prose, scannable like verse, is meant for oral delivery, designed to move the audience the better to persuade them. Unusual as it may seem to perform a poetic analysis of prose, I shall analyse how the melodic and rhythmic curves of Gallant’s balanced sen­ tences control our reading, organizing the groups of signifying discursive cells in the manner of a musical score. Advancing into critically unex­ plored territory, I argue that syntax is sense, and that we need to pay at­ tention to how we read, not what we read. If we, the audience, operate as interpretive performers lifting the living voice off the page, we gain access to the text’s structures of thought and modes of persuasion. I shall also explore Gallant’s use of the image – ­notably the metaphor, agent of both compression and expansion – ­as the vortex from and through which ideas rush, and through which she moves our gazes beyond our current way of seeing. Image and rhythm were plainly at the heart of both poetic and film theory and practice, as was the perception of the fourth dimension, time. Though he was also a painter who exhibited and a friend of Max Ernst, Bresson declared, “Aim for the audience’s ear more than for its eye,” and added: “The ear is far more creative than the eye” (Interviews 201). Likewise, Gallant thinks by and through metric organizational princi­ ples which I investigate, when focusing on rhetorical figures which gen­ erate rhythm and the broader functions these perform. What I identify as Gallant’s Cubist Realism and techniques of dissonance and syncopation will be investigated in depth. These rest on a central organizing principle of her vision, irony, which I examine in the process.66 Convinced that\n\n65 Interestingly, in the controversial (see Hotchner) restored edition of A Moveable Feast, we learn from Hemingway’s grandson, Sean, that the writer had given his Paris mem­ oirs the tentative title, The Early Eye and the Ear (S. Hemingway, “Introduction” 11). 66 W.H. New noted Gallant’s “sardonic asperity” as far back as 1980 (“The Art of Haunting Ghosts” 154), but in 1990 Siemerling observed in the Special Gallant issue of Essays on Canadian Writing that the writer’s irony was still “rarely considered as a central organising principle in her fiction” (135). Almost two decades later, Neil Besner lamented that irony was “a major element that still remains mostly unad­ dressed in Gallant’s work” (“Reading Muir, Asher, and Frazier” 158).\n\n“Acquisitions”: mapping world and work\n\n31\n\n“the function of the ironic trope is to lead to truth through reflection” (Godard 97), I argue that Mavis’s vision of the human comedy, often misunderstood, is on the whole simultaneously elevated and comic.67 Informed by theories of philosophical aesthetics (notably by Nelson Goodman, Arthur Danto, and Jerrold Levinson), my discussion identi­ fies the perceptual substructure which makes Gallant such a remarkable ironist – a­ substructure I show to be analogous to that of visual artists. My rhetorical microanalyses will draw from a wide array of Gallant’s writings, including the critically neglected, recently reissued novels and the earlier stories, many of which were collected for the first time in 2009, about which the two of us had many conversations. The genuinely new attention paid to the formalistic features of Gallant’s epistemological and compositional processes will illuminate their common parameters with both visual and sound culture. It will expand the existing critical reality surrounding her oeuvre by lighting up its common parameters with the arts she loved, and by addressing the rhetorical devices she deploys to engineer a fictional world as multidimensional as a Cubist picture, or as a symphony – d ­ epending on whether we lean towards the eye or the ear.\n\n67 I situate my standpoint among those (Fürst; Wilde; Hutcheon) who have moved away from seeing irony “as a limited classical rhetorical trope” and treat it as “a vision of life” (Hutcheon, Irony’s Edge 2).\n\n2 “Is it dead or alive?”\n\nLa vraie vie, la vie enfin découverte et éclaircie, la seule vie par conséquent réellement vécue, c’est la littérature.1 Marcel Proust, Le Temps retrouvé [Time Regained] (895) When all of the elements – i­mages, voices, sounds, silence – find their exact place within the whole, links are revealed between them. It’s these links that can make life suddenly irrupt. Robert Bresson, “The Grail: The Story’s Hidden Engine,” Bresson on Bresson (247) Like every other form of art, literature is no more and no less than a matter of life and death. The only question worth asking about a story – or a poem, or a piece of sculpture, or a new concert hall – i­s, “Is it dead or alive”? Mavis Gallant, “What Is Style?” Colette glows. Willy is like doused ashes. Mavis Gallant, “The Pursuit of Pleasure”\n\nIn the above epigraph taken from her review of Judith Thurman’s biography of Colette,2 Mavis takes the measure of Colette’s style with a yardstick she shares with Proust, as we can also see above, and also with Flaubert before him.3 Colette’s prose is alive; Willy’s is dead. 1 “Real life, life at long last unveiled and illuminated, thus the only life truly lived, is literature” (my translation). 2 Mavis declared Judith Thurman’s 1999 book “a fine and intelligent” biography “in spite of its title”: Secrets of the Flesh (“Pursuit”). 3 Idolized by writers ranging from Willa Cather to Ezra Pound, Nabokov, and Beckett, Flaubert remarked when he praised Jules Michelet for his gift of making things come\n\n“Is it dead or alive?”\n\n33\n\nThe immediate issue at hand is that Colette’s first husband, “a literary charlatan known as Willy, took credit for six of her early books” (Gallant, “Pursuit”). Mavis took the trouble to consult a polemical pamphlet in Paris’s Bibliothèque Nationale in which Willy attempted to prove he wrote most of Colette’s first work. Mavis’s judgment, or rather flair, is categorical: The examples he gives, comparing their work and style, denounce him on every page. Colette glows. Willy is like doused ashes. (“Pursuit”)\n\nThe broader issue, then, is that Mavis was able to encompass Colette’s thumbprint, in spite of her review’s concluding claim that facts “never reveal the source of the river we call genius.” Can we in turn encompass what makes up Gallant’s thumbprint? Gallant’s shining language: wholeness, harmony, and radiance Eco’s essay, The Aesthetics of Chaosmos,4 has famously addressed Joyce’s opus via the dialectic between two world views: medieval and Renaissance thought (and its preoccupation with order and moderation) and the modernist avant-garde (and its fascination with disorder and excess).5 Joyce spearheaded the international resurgence of interest in Aristotelianism, and, like the two-headed Janus, looked both forward and back. Gallant’s oeuvre, too, discloses a mix of opposite poetics, a dialectic of contraries. But unlike Joyce’s, the tension is not a question of rules to be followed or broken, for many of Gallant’s admirers who are writers themselves have claimed that her stories “follow no formula and obey no laws” (Banks viii). The issue is rather one of inclination and taste. ­Gallant’s poetics or personal artistic program, to borrow Eco’s definition,\n\nalive, that this was the mark of the chosen few with regard to style. Flaubert’s terms were: “ce don de faire vivre enfin, qui est la marque des élus en fait de style” (Oeuvres complètes). Interestingly, Faulkner, too, addressed the issue of style in such terms, namely that “like anything else to be alive it must be in motion too. If it becomes fixed, then it’s dead. (“Faulkner at Virginia”). 4 The essay The Aesthetics of Chaosmos was first published as the last chapter in Eco’s ­Opera Aperto (1962), then dropped from later editions, and published on its own in 1966. 5 Joyce also engages a dialectic between theoretical poetics and creative practice, his work being essentially a discussion of the artistic procedure subtending it – ­the poetics of itself, as it were. Not so Gallant, whose work is often parodic but so transparent that it never dips into the self-consciousness, even narcissism, of metatextuality (Hutcheon, Narcissistic Narrative).\n\n34\n\nMavis Gallant: The Eye and the Ear\n\nis notably rooted in the classical conception of form which Joyce’s mouthpiece, Stephen Dedalus – ­an eponymous avatar of the mythical master craftsman – ­evokes in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916). The author’s alter ego expounds on the scholastic aesthetic philosophy listing the three qualities or requirements pertaining to the artistic apprehension of universal beauty: integritas, consonantia, and claritas, which Stephen translates as wholeness, harmony, and radiance (Joyce, Portrait 192). This clear radiance is consubstantial with the concept of essence, “the scholastic quidditas, the whatness of a thing” (193).6 Just so does Gallant’s craft serve the exactness of apprehension and representation of humans in their habitat, in all their excesses and folly. It is dedicated to the structural proportion and balance which generate harmony.7 In turn, the resulting shining language illuminates and outshines reality in alignment with her well-loved Proust’s artistic manifesto in Le Temps retrouvé [Time Regained]. Proust’s mouthpiece argues that art allows us to see anew a world which convention and habit have masked. A writer’s style – ­not a technique but a vision – ­carries a qualitatively different world from the one that shows itself to you or me. Gallant’s program – ­like Proust’s – interestingly dovetails with the formalist Viktor Shklovsky’s theory of ostranenie or defamiliarization, which already concerned itself with a habituation of perception resulting in our seeing an ordinary object “as though it were enveloped in a sack” (Shklovsky 15). Gallant induces a heightened state of perception by transmuting average language into language that is both poetic and transparent. Unlike Gallant’s general approach, the early modernists’ appropriation of the estrangement-effect they found and admired in Tolstoy and Chekhov tended to impede clarity. To borrow Bakhtin’s term, Joyce’s “other-languagedness” (Bakhtin 294), his deformed/reformed language in Ulysses and Finnegans Wake, makes language opaque so as to draw attention away from the story to the language itself. Ulysses arrives at cognitive-estrangement by addressing both the acoustic and visual elements composing language, even playing the eye against the ear. This is done via graphological torsions which disrupt the smoothly acquired process through which we move from arbitrary (but recognizable) signifiers\n\n6 The Romantics, moreover, had rediscovered Plato – ­Shelley notably having translated Symposium – and transmitted to the early modernists their fascination with the concept of eidos, which for the ancient Greeks signified both form and essence. 7 Gallant, wary of excess, is always in absolute control of her language, governed by restraint and homology between form and content. On the occasions when the language or style is at odds with the subject, action, and character, it is, as I shall show, for burlesque ends.\n\n“Is it dead or alive?”\n\n35\n\nto the signified. While Gallant herself never dislocated standard usage, preferring as we shall see to wrench through her trademark metaphors rather than through play with sound and form, she did enjoy Joyce’s metaplasms, metagrams, and anagrams – a­ ll altered configurations that achieve with sound and sight the torsion that metaphor achieves with imagery.8 Rhythm and sonority were so vital to Gallant that one’s inner ear can actually hear her voice telling or performing, but she never adhered to strategies drawing readers’ attention away from the sense to the sound. She did admire the inventiveness of such tactics in Ulysses, from atomization9 and the notorious seriations10 to alliterative overkill paired with sense-wrenching rhyme, scrambling, and homophonic (sometimes bilingual) puns. All tend to obey the dynamics of musication or imitative harmony, the privileging of the sound patterns of a text over its meaning.11 Joyce’s use of such strategies can be linked to chant, nonsense verse and Dadaism, but also to the Imagist program of treating a signifier as a numinous object in itself (Barbour), and it largely helped to trigger certain transatlantic movements.12 Many of Gallant’s more crafted musical devices dovetail with those of Joyce, whose sound harmonies drew fiction away from narrative towards the pure sound of abstract musical\n\n8 When I first identify the use of a rhetorical device such as the metaplasm (a figure which involves altering a word by adding, deleting, or inverting sounds or letters), I italicize and gloss the term. Further references to the device receive no mark of emphasis. 9 Atomization can involve chopping up a sentence into a series of one-word sentences (Our. Little. Beggar. Baby. [Ulysses 97]) or even chopping up a word into syllables. It can also involve (rather like a stutter) reduplicating a word’s central syllable to foreground its phonemic components (lugugugubrious [282]), which amounts to drawing attention away from the sense to the sound. 10 See for instance Bloom’s chaotic list of entropic femininity: “She is a hoary pandemonium of ills, enlarged glands, mumps, quinsy, bunions, hay fever, bedsores, ringworm, floating kidney, Derbyshire neck, warts, bilious attacks, gallstones, cold feet, varicose veins” (420). 11 Joyce’s heteroglossic transcription of diverse sociolects (heard while moving through a crowd) culminates for instance in a list that seems chaotic and nonsensical: “Beer, beef, business, bibles, bulldogs, battleships, buggery and bishops” (Ulysses 421). But the proximal arrangement of lexemes obeys a particular logic – ­all begin with a B – ­which invites readerly glee at the resulting levelling equivalences. 12 France in the 1940s and 1950s housed lettrism, an art and literature movement which granted absolute priority to sound. Canada was home to Black Mountain and L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets like Bob Perelman, Charles Bernstein, and Susan Howe (who emphasized the arbitrariness of sound, alphabet, syntax, and typographical forms), and then to the performances of sliding syllables and pure utterance of bill bisett, bpNichol, Raoul Duguay, and Penn Kemp.\n\n36\n\nMavis Gallant: The Eye and the Ear\n\ncomposition. But as my close readings will show, in spite of gleeful forays into sound-propelled language such as “a kneeling gnat” (A Fairly Good Time 196), Gallant radically diverges from Joyce’s Dada-rooted aesthetic agenda, which like Stein’s privileges sound over sense and engineers textual opacity. Gallant’s prosody is a vehicle for thought rather than the object of thought. Unlike that of many modernists and postmodernists – ­from Faulkner, Dos Passos, and Beckett to Derek Walcott and Salman Rushdie – G ­ allant’s style is not at all derivative of Joyce’s pyrotechnical language-bending. The articulate Gallant enjoyed the way Joyce invited the text to open its mouth and put its foot in it.13 But she did not practise Joyce’s noises, neologisms, and homophonic wordplay. The bilingual Gallant enjoyed but did not practise Joyce’s bilingual puns and other conscious, intentional language hybrids (which Nabokov, too, practised quite outrageously in his first English-language novel, The Real Life of Sebastian Knight, and in Pnin [1957], and which Beckett also took up and honed), namely the perception of one language by another language, its “illumination by another linguistic consciousness” (Bakhtin 359).14 What Gallant did practise herself were the unfinished sentence, the unfinished quote, onomastics, parody and pastiche (also Nabokov’s ballpark), and playfully concealed intertextuality – a­ ll of which will come under scrutiny. But rather than drawing attention to itself, her prose, as Jack Hodgins remarks, “tends to be transparent” (51). Gallant’s translucency may explain a greater affinity with Nabokov than with Joyce, manifest in her review of Transparent Things. She notably pays homage to the Russian writer’s clarity, equating it with a true love of the English language: Love and death, past and present, are one on the other like panes of glass – ­transparent things. (Is there need to say that every sentence of Mr. Nabokov’s is also crystal clear? That if anything is loved in this loveless story it is the English language?) (Paris Notebooks 202)\n\nGallant’s own pellucidity actually comprises both acceptations of the term transparent: that of admitting maximum passage of light without\n\n13 “Text: open thy mouth and put thy foot in it” is an authorial invocation which follows a syntactical violation in which Joyce has scrambled direct speech (italicized here for clarity) and narration: “Is that first epistle to the Hebrews, he asked, as soon as his bottom jaw would let him, in?” (Ulysses 568, emphasis added). 14 Joyce’s “muttoning clouds” (Ulysses 223) are derived for instance from the French image “moutonner,” which sets up an analogy between drifting white fluffy clouds and a moving herd of sheep.\n\n“Is it dead or alive?”\n\n37\n\ndiffusion or distortion, and that of reflecting light evenly from all surfaces. In his review of The Cost of Living, a recent collection of Gallant’s stories from the 1950s, the writer Neel Mukherjee called attention to the radiance of her writing, comparing he"
