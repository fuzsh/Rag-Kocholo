        "text": "Mavis Gallant (born August 11, 1922, Montreal, Quebec, Canada—died February 18, 2014, Paris, France) was a Canadian-born writer of essays, novels, plays, and especially short stories, almost all of which were published initially in The New Yorker magazine. In unsentimental prose and with trenchant wit she delineated the isolation, detachment, and fear that afflict rootless North American and European expatriates.\n\nUntil age 10, Gallant received a bilingual education in a Roman Catholic French school where she was the only Protestant. She was uprooted from her home when her father died, and she was left behind in Canada when her mother remarried and moved to the United States. After attending 17 different schools in Canada and the United States, Gallant settled in Montreal, where she worked at the National Film Board of Canada and as a reporter for the Montreal Standard.\n\nIn 1950 Gallant left the newspaper and moved to Paris to pursue a career in fiction writing. Her second submission to The New Yorker, a short story titled “Madeline’s Birthday,” was published the following year. Gallant soon became a regular contributor to the magazine, which printed more than 100 of her short stories and much of her nonfiction.\n\nCollections of her well-constructed, perceptive, often humorous short stories include My Heart Is Broken (1964), The Pegnitz Junction (1973), Home Truths: Selected Canadian Stories (1981; winner of a Governor General’s Literary Award), Overhead in a Balloon: Stories of Paris (1985), In Transit (1988), and Across the Bridge (1993).\n\nMany of her works were later published in The Collected Stories of Mavis Gallant (1996), Paris Stories (2002), Varieties of Exile (2003; also published as Montreal Stories), and The Cost of Living: Early and Uncollected Stories (2009; also published as Going Ashore). In addition, she penned essays, two novels, and a play, What Is to Be Done? (1983)."
