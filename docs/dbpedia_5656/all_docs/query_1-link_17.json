        "text": "Margit Kaffka was a prominent figure of the legendary first generation of Hungarian literary modernity in the beginning of 20th century. Her short life and oeuvre encompasses many areas from poetry through short stories and novels to journalism and pedagogical reform activity. Aspiration for detailed description based on seeing and making something visible through the most possibly meticulous observation occupies a central role both in her lyrical and narrative poetics. During this observing process narrative subject dissolves (or isn’t even come into being) and becomes one with all that this minutious--meditative contemplation creates. This ambition, which permeates Kaffka’s lyrical and narrative work, is also at the heart of the art of Virginia Woolf, one of the most important innovators of modern novel poetics. However the eye, as the central metaphor is somewhat mis- leading as channels of perception in this process don’t really differ from each other: in Kaffka’s writing praxis, one of the signs of this, highlighted by many, is the great role of synaesthetic signifiers and descriptions, but the mixing and blending of channels of perception, their inseparability, is also a much-analysed feature of Woolf’s novels. Resolution and decontextualizaton of small details is an act of deprivation of the consensual (and for the focalizator-narrator inaccessible) meaning and the search for intelligibility at the same time. This poetic starting point can be discovered at many canonic figures of international literary modernism and remains important for later artists in the middle of the 20th century as well. This approach to the question of subjectivity, not explicitly from philosophy or psychology, but rather from narrative theory, is therefore also useful as an aspect of the literary history of mo-dernity. Not least because the text-level attention to the immanent creation of the point of view allows us to juxtapose authors and works of art that are traditionally placed in distant, possibly hierarchically separated canonical contexts. In this way, we can strengthen the self-reflexive, critical character of literary history by moving away from the community’s self-affirmation (and thus from the political vulnerability of literary history)."
