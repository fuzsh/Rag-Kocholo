Each course offered in the Department of English begins with the designation ENGL followed a three digit number. The first digit of this course number offers a rough guide to the level of the course:  2 - U1  3 - U2  4 - U3  5 - U3/Graduate  Note: All 500-level courses and a certain number of 200-, 300-, and 400-level courses have limited enrolment and require the instructors' permission to register. Students hoping to enroll in these courses should consult relevant course descriptions for the procedures for application procedures.  100-Level 200-Level 300-Level 400-Level  100-Level First Year Seminars [course link engl 199] Literature and Democracy: Trials of an American Selfhood Professor Peter Gibian Fall 2024 Time TBA    Description: In this seminar we will examine closely some of the most important, now-canonical writings produced by American authors in the early-to-mid 19th century—the formative decades following the new nation’s declaration of its independence from the English monarchy. This was a crucial era for the development of a distinctive American literature and for the testing of American conceptions of democracy. Many of the works we will read can be seen to have been written in direct dialogue with one another; this seminar will trace the way these writings (political treatises, philosophical meditations, personal essays, poems, or experimental short fictions) play out ongoing arguments exploring a wide range of competing notions of freedom or of democratic “individualism” (a new word coined in this era)—rival visions of the great powers or grave limitations of an American selfhood. Early readings may include excerpts from Franklin, Irving, Douglass, and Stowe, but the central focus will be on intensive analysis of foundational writings by major authors of the “American Renaissance”—Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, Melville, Poe, Whitman, and Dickinson. We will study these authors’ key works in their aesthetic and cultural context, as responses to urgent literary questions about authorship, readership, symbolism, and language as well as to urgent social questions raised by Jacksonian democracy, the era of the Common Man, the splintering effects of American individualism and diversity, and the problem of slavery in the land of the free.  Texts: Specific texts for purchase: TBA.  Evaluation: Tentative: Active and regular participation in discussions, 15%; series of brief textual analyses, 15%; two critical essays, 20% each; take-home final exam, 30%.  Format: Some framing lectures, but mainly multi-voiced seminar discussion.    200-Level Introductory Courses [course link engl 202] Professor Maggie Kilgour Fall 2024 Time TBA Prerequisite: Open only to English Majors and Minors, or by special written permission of instructor. Description: Why does anyone write literature? Even more importantly for us, why and how does anyone read it? Many people, some of whom you will know, will argue that studying literature, above all English literature, is irrelevant and useless today. Yet during the Covid pandemic, many others found literary works of all kinds essential, not just as a form of escape into another world from a reduced reality but also as creative and imaginative stimuli that kept us active and engaged humans.This course considers these questions by looking at the development of major non-dramatic works in English from the Anglo-Saxon period to the mid-18th century. It introduces students to the early history of English literature, while reflecting upon the meaning of tradition, literary history, the idea of a “canon”, and especially the concept of “English.” We will trace the development through time of specific literary forms and genres, including lyric, elegy, epic, satire, sonnet, romance, and pastoral. At the same time, we will explore the relation of literature to religion, politics, and culture broadly, to see why in different periods people read and write literature, and to follow the changing ideas of the writer and his/her role in society. Foundational to further study of literature in the department of English, ENGL 202 prepares students for more advanced and specialized study in the department. Discussions in conferences and written assignments will help students develop skills of interpretation and communication. Texts: (texts are available at McGill Bookstore):  Norton Anthology of English Literature. Vol 1. 9th Edition. Edmund Spenser’s Poetry. Norton Critical Edition. Ed. Anne Lake Prescott and Andrew D. Hadfield. (Included with the Anthology if purchased at the Bookstore)  Format: Lecture and conferences Evaluation: 20% in class mid-term; 40% 5-6 page term paper; 30% formal final exam; 10% conference participation  [course link engl 203] Winter 2025 Description: TBA Texts: TBA Format: TBA Evaluation: TBA  [course link engl 215] Professor Kenneth Borris Fall 2024 Time TBA Description: A representative sampling of Shakespeare’s plays will survey the scope and variety of his drama as it relates to his cultural context and to most of the main genres of his writing. Shakespeare began creating plays around 1589, and the plays addressed in this course represent the development of his art from somewhat after its beginnings, up to its final phase, around 1612. They will be dealt with in chronological order, as in the following list of the course readings. The course will thus provide a strong foundation for appreciating and understanding Shakespeare’s drama. Texts will be available in paperback for purchase at the Word bookstore, 469 Milton Street, 514-845-5640. Since this course will have conferences, one particular day of classes (TBA) will be cancelled after the first week or two of term, throughout the rest of the term, and conferences will instead be provided at various times on that particular day instead. You will choose the conference time that suits your other commitments. Texts:  A Midsummer Night’s Dream As You Like It Twelfth Night Othello King Lear The Winter’s Tale The Tempest  Evaluation: term paper, 45%; take-home final exam, 35%; course attendance and participation, 20% Format: lectures and weekly conferences  [course link engl 226] African American Literature and the Century of the Color Line  Professor Camille Owens Winter 2025 Time TBA Description: In 1903, W.E.B. Du Bois forecast that the problem of the twentieth century would be “the problem of the color line.” With this pronouncement, Du Bois foreshadowed racism’s long endurance while asserting the role of writers like himself in diagnosing, deconstructing, and contesting it. This course surveys the writing of African American authors after Du Bois whose experiments with form, narrative, and style built a formidable black literary culture in America while working to dismantle white supremacy’s structure. From Harlem Renaissance modernisms, to mid-century social realism, to the postmodern Gothic and Afrofuturism, this course examines how patterns of black migration, urban social cultures, and diasporic liberation struggles propelled African American literature in new directions, while also discerning lineages connecting twentieth-century African American literature to the foundational work of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century authors who wrote under slavery and toward abolition. Developing both formalist and historicist practices for reading novels, poems, short stories, and essays by such authors as Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, Nella Larsen, Richard Wright, Ann Petry, Ralph Ellison, Gwendolyn Brooks, Ishmael Reed, Toni Morrison, Yusef Komunyakaa, and Octavia Butler, students in this course will practice foundational skills of literary study, while building a broader toolkit for cultural analysis.  Texts: (subject to minor change)  Nella Larsen, Quicksand Ann Petry, The Street  Richard Wright, Native Son  Ralph Ellison, Invisible Man  Ishmael Reed, Flight to Canada  Toni Morrison, Beloved  Octavia Butler, Parable of the Sower  Format: Lecture and discussion conferences Evaluation: Participation (10%), weekly discussion posts (10%), short essay 1 (15%), short essay 2 (20%) midterm exam (20%), final exam (25%)  [course link engl 229] Professor Robert Lecker Fall 2024 Time TBA (Note: For English Majors, this course qualifies for the required three credits from a course in Canadian literature) Description: A survey of English Canadian poetry and prose from the Second World War to the present. We will read a range of poetry and short fiction by many of Canada’s most accomplished writers in order to explore ideas about the nature of Canada and the literary representation of race, identity, politics, and indigenous experience in Canada. In addition to looking at the work of major authors from 1945 to the present, the lectures will also cover such topics as Canadian literary nationalism, realism, postmodernism, and different forms of experimentation. We will also look at the idea of the north as a central metaphor in Canadian writing and will discuss the economic and cultural forces accounting for the construction of a national literature. Students will be introduced to several concepts related to literary analysis. Please note that in addition to weekly lectures there will be one mandatory conference meeting (one hour) each week. Required texts: TBD. Evaluation: Tentative: Lecture attendance (10%); conference attendance (10%); participation (10%); discussion boards (10%); in-class essays (30%); final take-home exam (30%). Format: Lecture and conferences.  [course link engl 230] Professor Katherine Zien Fall 2024 Time TBA Description: Theatre is a tree with deep roots and many branches: not only does the history of world theatre stretch millennia long, but theatre studies encompasses both textual analysis and investigation of all the aspects of a staged production: lighting, sound, movement, vocalizations and uses of language, set design, and stage-audience interactions. Given the complexity and breadth of the field, this course provides a critical introduction to theatre studies, focusing on play texts, drama theory, and theatre history. We will cover both western and non-western theatrical events, examining a range of works from Ancient Greek tragedy through contemporary and postcolonial performance, and including the Department of English mainstage show. Through the plays, we will examine what “theatre” is and does in different periods and places. We will learn how theatre is constituted by the material and social conditions of performance, codified in dramatic genres, and conceptualised in dramatic theory. Required Texts:   Textbook TBA. Additional play texts and production videos, where available, will be provided through MyCourses.  Format: Lecture, discussion, and group work. Evaluation: participation: 10%; in-class assignments: 10%; short essays: 20%; midterm exam: 30%; final exam: 30%  [course link engl 269] Professor Amber Rose Johnson Winter 2025 Time TBA Course Description: This course is designed to support students in exploring the use of the body and voice as tools for communication and expression in the presence of an audience. While the course will introduce students to tools and techniques used in acting and improvisation, including vocal and physical warm-ups, theater and improvisational games and simple scene study, we will also explore other, experimental modes of performance that exceed the frame of “acting”. Together we will attend to embodied modes of imagination, creativity and spontaneity. Throughout the course, you will be asked to commit fully to the group and the creative process, and you may be expected to work on your own, outside of class, rehearsing or preparing performance materials. Evaluation: Attendance and participation (20%), written analysis of performance from syllabus (15%), Written reflection on Improv exercises (10%), written analysis of performance experience outside of class (15%) In-Class performances (20%), Group performance (20%) Texts:   Refractions: Solo, Edited by Donna-Michelle St. Bernard and Yvette Nolan  Format: Group discussions, practical exercises, class presentations  [course link engl 275] Richard Jean So Fall 2024 Time TBA Course Description: This course, a required course for Cultural Studies majors and minors, will introduce various critical efforts to theorize the aesthetics, semiotics, and politics of mass and popular culture. We start by looking at some foundational texts and theories in this tradition, moving from British Culture Marxism to the Frankfurt School. Next, we explore more specific attempts to extend this tradition to look at questions of gender, race, and empire by key scholars such as Edward Said and Judith Butler. Then we look at some general attempts to theorize culture in relationship to “popular culture,” postmodernism, and finally, ending with technology and media. Overall, this class provides a survey of a number of founding texts in the tradition of Cultural Studies, as well as some important more recent attempts to enhance this tradition to take on pressing contemporary concerns of identity, mass media, and science. Format: Lectures are from 1.35pm to 2.25pm on Monday and Wednesday; weekly TA-led conferences (except during the first week of the term, during which there will be lectures on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, with no conferences). Conference attendance is mandatory. Registration for conferences will open on the first week of the semester. Most conferences will take place on Friday but it is possible you will have a conference on another day. Required Texts: All essays will be posted on MyCourses a week before the reading is due. Evaluation: Test 1: 30%; Test 2: 30%; Conference presentation: 30%; Conference attendance: 10%  [course link engl 277] Professor Ned Schantz Fall 2024 Time TBA Screening TBA Description: This course is designed to prepare students for future film courses at McGill. It is therefore dedicated to three main goals: establishing a frame of reference for the history of film and film theory, introducing key analytical concepts and skills, and inspiring an ongoing interest in film. The course will initially be restricted to Cultural Studies majors/minors and Film Studies minors. If space permits, other students may be admitted. Texts: Coursepack Evaluation: quizzes 20%, short paper 25%, participation 15%, posted class notes 5%, final 35%.

It also counts as one of the History requirements for the Cultural Studies major. Description: This course introduces key historical moments, cinematic movements, formal styles, as well as historiographical and theoretical debates in the history of world cinema. Tracing the transformation of cinema from its emergent era to the present, this course maps out diverging trajectories and merging paths of exemplary filmmakers and filmmaking collectives in various nations and geo-political regions against the backdrop of the changing historical and technological media environments. Students will read both historical and contemporary texts to gain a broad sense of the seminal debates in film studies, theory, and criticism. This course aims to foster a critical understanding of cinema as an international, distributed, and polycentric phenomenon. Format: Lecture and screening in one weekly four-hour block. Evaluation: Attendance: 10%; In-class quizzes (3, each worth 10%): 30%; Midterm Exam: 30%; Final Exam: 40% Possible Films:  Early shorts by the Lumière brothers, George Melies, D.W.

We'll pay special attention to puzzles and problems surrounding the notion that movies are texts and that adaptations are \"intertexts\" or \"palimpsestic texts.\" Textualist definitions of adaptation will be compared with alternative approaches grounded in the idea that cinema is an essentially nontextual medium. To explore this alternative, we will need to clarify what it is that we are talking about when we use terms like “text,\" \"medium,\" and “cinema.” This discussion opens onto an examination of whether adaptation essentially involves a medium shift, that is, a change from one mode or vehicle of expression (the literary text, for instance) to another (the cinematic display). At the same time, we'll survey some varieties of adaptation. Cinematic adaptations can be described as versions of their source works. For one thing to be a version of another necessarily means that features of one be markedly informed or shaped by features of the other. But not all versions are, for instance, faithful to the original. Hence we'll link adaptation to the concepts of \"fidelity,\" \"artistic nesting,\" and \"transgression.\" This discussion will, in turn, lead us to consider how best to go about critically appreciating an adaptation as an adaptation, that is, as a certain kind of artistic achievement.   Movies: TBD  Texts:  A selection of readings drawn from contemporary film theory and aesthetic philosophy; a selection of novels and short fictional works.  Evaluation (Tentative): conference participation 20%; midterm exam (short essay) 30%; final exam 50%  Format:  Lectures, discussions, in-class screenings, conference sections  [course link engl 290] Intro to Postcolonial and World Literature Professor Sandeep Banerjee Fall 2024 Time TBA Description: This course provides a critical introduction to postcolonial and world literature by drawing on literary texts – novels, poems, short stories, and travelogues – from South Asia. The course examines how these texts conceive of, and represent, the lives and life-worlds of the South Asian region while situating them in relation to the critical and theoretical preoccupations of postcolonial and world literature studies. The course interrogates the (often contested) meanings of the term postcolonial and asks how it relates to categories such as anti-colonial and colonial besides familiarizing students with some of the key issues and contemporary debates in the field. In so doing, the course prepares students for further study in postcolonial and world literature. Note 1: Attendance to TA conferences and, if scheduled, film screenings is mandatory. No exceptions. Note 2: This is one of the required courses for the South Asian Studies minor (Stream 1: Culture and Civilization). Possible Texts (to be finalized later): Novels:  RK Narayan – The Guide (1958) Salman Rushdie – Haroun and the Sea of Stories (1990) Mohammed Hanif – The Case of Exploding Mangoes (2008) Megha Majumdar – A Burning (2020)  Travelogues:  Vikram Seth – From Heaven Lake (1983)  Short Stories: Selections from Rokeya Sakhawat Hussain, Rabindranath Tagore, Sadaat Hasan Manto, Manik Banerjee Poetry: Selections from Rabindranath Tagore; Arun Kolatkar Evaluation: Take home exams and papers. Format: Lectures and TA conferences.  [course link engl 237] Funny Forms and Genres: A Literary History of Comedy Professor Carmen Mathes Winter 2025 Time TBA Description: This course surveys a wide-range of comedic forms and genres within the long sweep of literary history. What makes one thing funny and not another? Which jokes stay funny and which lose their sparkle over time? Can a joke provoke political change or provide consolation in difficult times? Along the way, we will explore Cicero’s theory of the ridiculous and Freud’s theory of jokes; plays by Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde; poetry by Alexander Pope, Aphra Behn, Lord Byron, Lewis Carroll and others; the perfection of the marriage plot (in Emma and Autumn de Wilde’s 2020 film adaptation); physical comedy in the silent film era; a selection of stand-up; and finally Kevin Wilson’s novel Nothing To See Here (about children who regularly burst into flames). Texts:  Shakespeare, The Comedy of Errors Oscar Wilde, The Importance of Being Earnest Austen, Emma Kevin Wilson, Nothing to See Here  In-class screenings of:  Chaplin, Modern Times de Wilde, Emma Stand-up comedy TBD  Format: Lecture and discussion Evaluation: TBD  300-Level Intermediate Courses [course link engl 301] Professor David Hensley Fall 2024 Time TBA  Description: This course will canvas some of the “origins” of the English novel and trace its development (particularly as anti-romance satire and realism) up to the mid-eighteenth century. Our readings and discussion will refer to the European context of the evolution of this narrative form in England. We will consider the novel as responding to a network of interrelated problems – of the self and its imaginative politics – at the representational crossroads of medieval epic, courtly romance, spiritual autobiography, picaresque satire, colonialist adventure, gallant intrigue, baroque casuistry, bourgeois conduct book, sentimental love story, moral treatise, psychological realism, and mock-heroic “comic epic in prose.” As the emerging literary “form of forms,” the early modern novel vibrantly juxtaposes and interweaves all these different generic strands. Our work together will aim at a critical analysis of the textual ideologies articulated in this experimental process of historical combination. Texts: The required reading for this course will include most or all of the following books, which will be available at The Word Bookstore (469 Milton Street, 514-845-5640). (The list of texts and editions below is tentative and incomplete, to be confirmed in September 2024.)  The Song of Roland (Hackett)  Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun, The Romance of the Rose (Oxford)  Sir Thomas Malory, Le Morte Darthur (Oxford)  Abelard and Heloise, The Letters and Other Writings (Hackett)  Lazarillo de Tormes (Norton)  Miguel de Cervantes, Don Quijote (Norton)  Madame de Lafayette, The Princess of Clèves (Norton)  Aphra Behn, Oronooko and Other Writings (Oxford)  Eliza Haywood, Love in Excess (Broadview)  Daniel Defoe, Moll Flanders (Norton)  Samuel Richardson, Pamela (Oxford)  Henry Fielding, Joseph Andrews and Shamela (Oxford)  Evaluation: Paper (50%), tests (40%), participation (10%). Regular attendance is required for a passing final grade (a maximum of two absences will be allowed except for documented medical or similar emergencies). Format: Lectures and discussion.  [course link engl 305] Professor Wes Folkerth Winter 2025 Time TBA Description: In this course we will survey nondramatic literature in England the 1590s, one of the most remarkable decades in English literary history, one which saw the initial publication of major works by Edmund Spenser, Sir Philip Sidney, William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Lodge, Robert Greene, Thomas Nashe, Thomas Deloney, John Marston, Robert Southwell, George Chapman, Michael Drayton, Samuel Daniel, Richard Hooker and Sir Francis Bacon, among others. We will read and discuss examples from popular contemporary poetry and associated genres such as the sonnet sequence, the epyllion, the funeral elegy, and the pastoral. We will follow the decade’s prose as it ranges broadly from proto-novelistic romances to satirical pamphleteering, from underworld documentary to exotic travel narratives. Our literary study of the decade will also regularly cast an eye to other examples of the decade’s print culture, including contemporary news from abroad, tales of piracy on lawless seas, and accounts of witchcraft and other strange crimes. Format: Lecture and class discussion Evaluation: midterm exam (30%); final essay (30%); final exam (30%); conference participation (10%) Texts: TBA  [course link engl 306] Professor Fiona Ritchie Fall 2024 Time TBA Expected Preparation: ideally students enrolled in this course will have already taken ENGL 230 Introduction to Theatre Studies Description: This course provides an overview of dramatic forms and theatrical practice in Britain from the medieval to the early modern period (c. 1300-1642). We will move from the earliest recorded vernacular play texts to the closure of the professional theatre in 1642, encompassing medieval religious drama and the theatre of Shakespeare and his contemporaries. Rather than taking a chronological approach, we will examine early theatre in a way that highlights continuities as well as divisions between the medieval and the early modern stage. We will analyse the conditions of performance (playing spaces, actors, audience, technology, etc) as well as studying a selection of representative plays (looking at their form, function, aesthetic features, etc). Emphasis is placed on the plays as theatrical works rather than literary texts. To that end, we will pay close attention to historical documents that elucidate how these plays were originally performed and received. Texts: Janette Dillon, The Cambridge Introduction to Early English Theatre (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006); coursepack containing a selection of plays Evaluation (Tentative): participation 10%; production journal 20%; midterm assignment analysing historical documents 30%; take home final exam 40% Format: lecture, discussion, group work  [course link engl 308] Professor Wes Folkerth  Fall 2024 Time TBA Description: In this course we will survey the impressive yield of English Renaissance drama written by writers other than William Shakespeare. We will read twelve plays from the period, about one a week, including The Spanish Tragedy (Thomas Kyd), Gallathea (John Lyly), The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus (Christopher Marlowe), Arden of Faversham (Anon), The Tragedy of Antony (Mary Sidney), The Shoemaker’s Holiday (Thomas Dekker), A Woman Killed with Kindness (Thomas Heywood), The Knight of the Burning Pestle (Francis Beaumont), Volpone (Ben Jonson), A Chaste Maid in Cheapside (Thomas Middleton), The Duchess of Malfi (John Webster), and ‘Tis Pity She’s a Whore (John Ford). We will study these plays as exemplars of swiftly-changing and varied theatrical tastes in the period. Many of these works provide purviews onto the cultural situation of early modern London that are rarely found in Shakespeare’s works.  Evaluation: Midterm (25%); Final Essay, 8-10 pages (35%); Final Exam (30%); Participation (10%) Texts (available at the Word on Milton):  Kinney, Arthur F. and David A. Katz (eds). Renaissance Drama: An Anthology of Plays and Entertainments. 3rd edition. Wiley/Blackwell, 2022. ISBN 978-1-118-82397-2.  Format: Lecture and class discussion.  [course link engl 311] Fall 2024 Professor Eli MacLaren, Professor Miranda Hickman Time TBA  Description: This course introduces students to the formal and stylistic elements of poetry and prose fiction, provides them with a shared vocabulary for recognizing and analyzing different literary forms, and develops their reading, writing, and critical discussion skills. Although many critical methods can be applied to the works in this course, Poetics focuses on teaching students how to talk and write precisely about a wide range of formal and stylistic techniques in relation to literary meaning in poetry and prose fiction. All the critical methodologies you will learn in your other English courses will benefit from your knowledge of the material of ENGL 311. You will read some works in Poetics that are also required in other courses, such as ENGL 202 and 203, the Departmental Surveys of English Literature. In Poetics, we study such works not primarily in historical context, or as engagements with literary, cultural or social history, but for the techniques of literary art that they exhibit. The course instructors assume that students enrolled as English majors will already have some facility explaining what given works of literature mean; we instead focus on understanding how literature creates meaning. Discussions and assignments will therefore involve the memorization, identification, and application of concepts and terms essential to the study of literary techniques. Thus, the English Literature program requires that ENGL 311 be taken in U1 so that all Literature students will be well prepared for their other studies with a shared terminology and training in critical writing. Prerequisite or Corequisite: ENGL 202 or ENGL 200. This course is open only to English majors in the literature stream. This course is to be taken in the Fall semester of U1 or in the first Fall semester after the student’s selection of the Literature Major program. Required Texts: (available at the McGill Bookstore)  Abrams, M.H. and Geoffrey Galt Harpham. A Glossary of Literary Terms. 11th ed. Boston: Wadsworth, 2015. Bausch, Richard, and R. V. Cassill, eds.

New York: Norton, 2018.  Recommended:  Messenger, William E., et. al. The Canadian Writer’s Handbook. 6th ed. Oxford UP, 2015.  Evaluation: First essay, close reading of poem, 4 pp.; second essay, on short story, secondary research required, 6 pp.; mid-term exam (in class); formal final examination common to all sections of Poetics; class attendance and participation; short assignments, such as pop quizzes, writing exercises, scansions, and recitations. This evaluation is the same for all sections of Poetics.  [course link engl 313] Theatre and Difference in Quebec Professor Erin Hurley​ Winter 2025 Time TBA Expected Preparation: Previous university course in drama and theatre, literature, or cultural studies. Description: This course will offer a selective survey of drama in Quebec from the 1950s to the present. With a focus on French-language theatre (to be read in English translation), we will trace the changing aesthetics and politics of this dynamic tradition, contextualising them in performance and social contexts, and alert to figurations of insiders and outsiders in the dramatic corpus. A secondary focus will be minority-language dramatic output and theatrical production in Quebec in the same period, with a particular emphasis on that produced in English. This course also offers the opportunity to conduct primary-source research and analysis on under-documented, minority-language drama Quebec theatre. To this end, students will read and analyse largely unpublished plays by English-language Quebec playwrights. In addition, we will hear from theatre artists working in Montreal today in the form of guest-lectures and interviews. Texts: Coursepack of critical and secondary readings. Plays will be selected to capitalize on the theatrical offerings in Montreal in Fall 2021. However, significant texts such as the following may feature on the reading list.

[course link engl 314] Professor Sean Carney Winter 2025 M/T/Th 13:35-14:25 Rutherford Physics 118 Description: This course will examine European and North American drama of the twentieth century. We will begin by studying the canonical realists of the late nineteenth century and the philosophy underlying their dramaturgy. This will lead us into a consideration of various positive and negative responses to the realist tradition. We will examine these plays in their original theatrical contexts, while at the same time positioning these dramas in relation to their individual social and political moments. We will also consider subsequent re-stagings of these plays and how they are repurposed in new contexts. The thematic rubric for the course will address generational conflicts and parent/child relationships in the various plays. The overall goal of the course is to impart to students a foundational understanding of the dominant trend in modern drama in the west. Format: Lectures and conferences Evaluation (tentative): First essay (5 pages): 25%; Class Attendance / Participation: 10%; Major Essay (6 pages): 30%; Final Exam: 35% Please Note: In the event of extraordinary circumstances beyond the University’s control, the content and/or evaluation scheme in this course is subject to change.

We will begin with a number of very early plays, including The Two Gentlemen of Verona, The Comedy of Errors, Titus Andronicus, and Love’s Labor’s Lost. Before the midterm we will also read one of Shakespeare’s popular narrative poems, “Venus and Adonis.” After the midterm we will focus on three plays – Richard II, Romeo and Juliet, and A Midsummer Night’s Dream (world classics of history, tragedy, and comedy) – which he wrote all within the space of about a single year. The Merchant of Venice, and Henry the Fourth, Part One round out the decade of the 1590s, and our course. The plan is to cover approximately one play per two weeks. Are you Shakespearienced? After this course you will be. The pace will be fast, with a view to giving students in the English major and minor programs a fuller appreciation of the scope of Shakespeare’s accomplishment in the first half of his career.

[course link engl 316] Professor Maggie Kilgour Fall 2024 Time TBA Prerequisite: None. Expected Student Preparation: This is a challenging course. Previous university courses in English literature, especially ENGL 202; some knowledge of Renaissance literature or culture is desirable. Description: A study of the poetry and selected prose of one of England’s most important, influential, and still controversial writers. While to many people today Milton seems the epitome of literary and political orthodoxy, in his own time he was known as a radical thinker, an advocate of regicide and divorce. His writing is complex and challenging, demanding careful and active engagement from his readers. In the first few weeks of the term, we will look at Milton’s early poetry and some of his political writings, tracing his development as a poet in relation to his social, political, and literary context. The centre of the course will focus on a close reading of Paradise Lost. In conclusion, we will look briefly at his last works, Paradise Regain’d and Samson Agonistes, and discuss Milton’s later reputation and his place in the Western literary tradition. Format: Lecture and discussion Evaluation: 25% in class mid-term; 40% 10 pp. term paper on Paradise Lost; 25% take-home exam; 10% class participation.

These include three plays by Shakespeare, readings from the two influential “confessions” of St. Augustine and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and two novels—Passing by Nella Larson and Fake Accounts by Lauren Oyler. Our literary reading will be supplemented by the work of a number of important thinkers, including Hannah Arendt, Jürgen Habermas, Michael Warner, and Alice Marwick and danah boyd.  The course is about the history of the ideas, practices, spaces, and technologies that have created the shifting zones of private and public life. We’ll move toward a deeper understanding of how our world has been shaped by the history of privacy and publicity (i.e., the condition of being public). We will make use of ChatGPT and/or similar AI systems in the course. Texts: Texts will be available from Paragraph Books.

[course link engl 318] Socio-Historical Approaches  Professor David Hensley Winter 2025 Time TBA Expected Preparation: Limited to students in English programs. Description: This course will survey the evolution of theories and methodologies in scholarship, especially in literary criticism, both from ancient intellectual models and in modern thought since the seventeenth century. As a basis for understanding and evaluating the role of “socio-historical approaches” in literary and cultural studies, we will contextualize the debate between formalism and historicism in the opposition between Kant’s philosophy and the alternative of dialectical thinking in Hegel, hermeneutics, and Marx. Our readings will reflect the far-reaching impact of this ideological opposition as a pattern of methodological assumptions and institutional practices. We will also review the formal and historical claim that one literary genre in particular – the novel – embodies or expresses the characteristic philosophical problems of modernity. Note: This course is not open to students who took ENGL 317 with Prof. Hensley.  Texts: Most of the books for this course will be available at The Word Bookstore (469 Milton Street, 514-845-5640). The textbooks listed below will be among those required. (Please note that Pluhar's translation of Kant is the only acceptable edition! The full list of texts and editions will be confirmed January 2025.)

[course link engl 319] Professor Richard Jean So Winter 2025 Time TBA Description: This course offers an advanced undergraduate level introduction to compelling new theoretical work in literary and cultural studies, notably after the high mark of “critical theory” ca. 1990. Topics to be covered include the New Formalism, Post-critical Reading, Afropessimism, Environmental Humanities, Digital Humanities, and other important new approaches in the discipline. Workflow: Each week we’ll read one or two major works of criticism/theory, as well as one brief “cultural artifact” to ground our discussion of each week’s readings. Class will be split into two discussion halves, mapping on to the two class meetings each week. In the first, we’ll discuss the theoretical material; in the second we’ll “apply” the theoretical concepts to a specific text. Readings: All readings will be posted to MyCourses as pdf files one week before they are due. You don’t have to purchase any books or texts on your own, only unless you want to. Some examples include: Forms by Levine; Slow Violence by Nixon; Distant Horizons by Underwood; In the Wake by Sharpe; etc. Evaluation: Do all the reading, come to class, write the final paper, and participate.

However, there are no prerequisites for this course, and it will be broadly useful to students interested in both histories of the novel and the history and fiction of South Africa during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Description: How do literary texts respond to oppressive political contexts? How, for example, can fiction describe or affect a society fractured by racial segregation? This class will answer those questions by surveying efforts by twentieth-century South African writers working during the era of apartheid (1948-1994). We will then look at literature of the post-apartheid period (1994-present), when hopes of a “rainbow nation” burst into life but then quickly faded amid growing inequality and political scandal. Throughout the semester, we will ask what effects these massive societal changes have had on South African fiction, and what effects—if any—writers of conscience had on the transformation of a racially unjust society. While plotting this trajectory, we will also reflect on how South African fiction challenges metropolitan histories and theories of the novel. The course will thus explore how South African writers have reconfigured foundational aesthetic categories like realism and modernism and associated social categories like time, subjectivity, and desire in their efforts to represent life under racial capitalism. Students will leave the course with a) a core understanding of the literary history of South Africa; b) a grasp of the history and theory of the novel and its applicability to fiction of the global South; and c) a broad set of critical terms (e.g., realism and modernism) useful for the study of modern fiction generally. Required texts may include:  Sol T. Plaatje, Native Life in South Africa (1916) Es’kia Mphahlele, Down Second Avenue (1959) Nadine Gordimer, The Conservationist (1974) J.M. Coetzee, Dusklands (1974) Miriam Tlali, Between Two Worlds (1986) Zoë Wicomb, You Can’t Get Lost in Cape Town (1987) Imraan Coovadia, Tales of the Metric System (2014) Masande Ntshanga, The Reactive (2014) Johnny Steinberg, A Man of Good Hope (2015) Various theoretical texts on the history and theory of the novel posted to MyCourses  Evaluation: In-class participation; class recaps; oral presentation; one five-page paper; one ten-page research paper. Format: Seminar  [course link engl 322] The Work of the Critic Professor Miranda Hickman Winter 2025 Time TBA Fulfills the Theory/Criticism requirement for the major in English Description: “Criticism is as inevitable as breathing,” T.S. Eliot suggests, enigmatically, in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” (1919), the essay whose ideas of criticism and creative process exerted major influence on the early twentieth-century modernist moment and beyond. By “criticism,” Eliot means literary criticism and beyond—cultural commentary and critique, designed to register readers’ thoughts and feelings; guide attention; focus thought; identify literary and cultural questions; and respond to and evaluate the texts and ideas of a culture, often toward developing visions for the future. Eliot’s essay, and the thinking about the activity of “criticism” it represents, reads as the early twentieth-century’s answer to Matthew Arnold’s challenge of the mid-nineteenth century: Arnold’s “The Function of Criticism at the Present Time” paved the way for a late nineteenth- and early twentieth century preoccupation with the work of criticism – what role does the commentary associated with criticism, and the figure of the cultural critic, play in the making of culture? How can the critic support what F.R. Leavis and Denys Thompson called the development of “critical awareness,” with respect to the texts of a culture? The critic is alternately imagined in the work of this period (sometimes called the “Age of Criticism”) as “sage,” respondent, watchdog, spur, cynic, Virgilian guide, curator, judge, jester, and rhapsode. Contemporary cultural historian John Guillory, in Professing Criticism (2022), recognizes the importance that the practice of criticism has held for the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, and acknowledges that in the field of English, when people teach “literature,” in fact they are often teaching criticism. Taking a cue from Guillory and theorists such as Terry Eagleton - whose The Critical Revolutionaries (2022) will provide points of departure - this course traces a genealogy of criticism as we have inherited the concept, focusing especially on examples from the eighteenth-, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries that have shaped our contemporary conception of what criticism entails and does. Texts: Early readings include essays by Coleridge, Carlyle, and Arnold; the late Victorian aesthetic criticism of Walter Pater, Henry James, and Oscar Wilde; and twentieth-century work by a range of twentieth-century critics invested in the challenge of reimagining “criticism” for the needs of a modern era – such as Eliot, I.A. Richards, Q.D. and F.R. Leavis, Lionel Trilling, and Northrop Frye. We close by considering a range of later and recent work from critics committed to the “work of the critic” such as Susan Sontag, Toni Morrison, Merve Emre, and Zadie Smith. Format: Lecture and Discussion Evaluation: 3 brief critical essays and projects (15% each); longer critical essay (20%); final examination (25%), participation (10%)  [course link engl 326] Fiction After the Civil War: Regionalism, Urbanism, Internationalism Professor Peter Gibian Winter 2025 Time TBA Expected Student Preparation: Previous university-level course work in American Literature, preferably before 1900, or permission of instructor. Description: A mid-level survey of later-19th-century prose fiction forms representing a wide range of literary movements and modes. The course will be organized to trace ever-widening geographical, literary, and cultural horizons. A first unit will explore “regionalist” or “local color” writings (by authors such as Irving, Harris, Harte, Twain, Chopin, Jewett, Cable, Chestnutt, and Alcott) rooted in the specificity of a unique geographical place that is seen to define a unique cultural or psychological identity. The second course unit will survey classic writerly responses to the late-19th-century city—seen (in authors such as Chopin, Alcott, Dreiser, James, and Wharton) as a new sort of humanly-constructed, hybrid environment or economy in which diverse strangers from a variety of homes and backgrounds are brought together to work out forms of coexistence. The final unit will then follow another group of turn-of-the-century writers as they expand American horizons even further, reflecting the nation’s move into the international arena with new fictional treatments of the International Theme. Authors such as James and Wharton ground their writing in the ever-shifting experience of cross-cultural travel and meditate anxiously on the situation of the writer as “cosmopolite”--perfectly placed (or dis-placed) to explore the problems and possibilities of inter-national interchange in a modern, globalizing world. Texts (Tentative; editions TBA): To be selected from authors noted in the description above. Readings will include not only short stories but also several longer novels; the amount of assigned reading will be fairly substantial—especially at the end of the semester.  A collection of short stories—available in pdf on myCourses. Alcott, Little Women; Dreiser, Sister Carrie; Wharton, The Age of Innocence; Levine, ed., The Norton Anthology of American Literature (10th ed., Vol. C).  Evaluation: (Tentative): 25% mid-term exam; 25% term paper; 10% class attendance and participation; 40% formal final exam. (NB: All forms of evaluation in this course—on exams as well as essays—test abilities in literary-critical writing and analysis; there will be no short-answer or multiple-choice exams graded by computer.) Format: Lectures and discussions.  [course link engl 329] Reading the Multiplot Novel in the Age of AI Professor Yael Halevi-Wise Fall 2024 M/W 14:30-16:00 Description: This course will make use of Open AI tools to explore the role of minor characters in multiplot English novels written in the first half of the 19th Century. By focusing on minor characters, we will acquire a better understanding of the architectonics of complex literary creations. As a new experiment in literary analysis we will also investigate whether AI tools are presently capable of achieving an accurate and deep assessment of literary artworks created by sophisticated human imaginations addressed to sophisticated readers. Minor characters may seem to play a superfluous role in the plot of a novel, but their presence offsets a narrative’s main concerns and outlines its architectonic composition. On a parallel track we will inquire whether the present generation of AI tools are minor and superfluous for literary analysis or can they sharpen literary analysis by offering refreshing modes of research, brainstorming and essay composition. Note: This course requires fast paced reading of long and complicated novels. Shortcuts will not work because the assignments build on a comparison between traditional reading and various types of shortcuts.

Format: Lecture, workshops, discussion  [course link engl 331] Love and Global Romanticism Professor Carmen Mathes Fall 2024 Time TBA Description: Romanticism is a philosophical and literary movement; the Romantic era is an eighteenth- and nineteenth-century historical period. The meanings, scope and timelines associated with both these statements have been oft debated and contested, particularly when it comes to Romantic-era Britain’s global reach. This course situates British Romanticism in a global context, and it does so by thinking about love. At a time of imperial and colonial expansion, how did Romantic novelists and poets think about the potentials and pitfalls of love? What kinds of connections—or animosities, or fantasies, or projections—might love bring to the surface or, alternatively, stifle, reject, or repress? We will read three novels (by Jane Austen, Mary Shelley and an anonymous author) and many poems by writers including Phillis Wheatley Peters, William Blake, Charlotte Smith, William Wordsworth, Mary Robinson, John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron. Texts:  The Broadview Anthology of Romantic Literature, edited by Joseph Black et al., Broadview, 2016, ISBN: 9781554811311 Jane Austen, Mansfield Park (1814), edited by Claudia L.

[course link engl 342] From Beowulf to J.R.R. Tolkien’s Old English Chronicles Dr. Antje Chan Winter 2025 Time TBA Prerequisite: None Description: This course explores the significance of Old English for the history of the English language and its literature. Britain before the Norman Conquest produced a language and literature marked by invention and innovation, unravelling moments of change and migration. Around 650, Britain and Ireland comprised early English dialects such as Irish, Welsh, Pictish, Old Norse, and Latin. Languages and cultures throughout the two islands mingled and clashed amidst competing kingdoms. From Germanic peoples before 600s, to Viking and Danish raiders, rulers, and settlers, as well as a community of Jews, Britain was shaped by movements of migration and change. Questions of identity and belonging were at the forefront of the literature. By developing skills for translation, literary, cultural and historical enquiry, this course looks at a wide range of literary forms, such as lyrics, riddles, epic narrative, hagiographies and chronicles in order to enrich our understanding of the first 600 years of the English language. Texts (provisional):  The Dream of the Rood The Battle of Maldon The Wanderer The Wife’s Lament Beowulf Judith Ælfric’s Life of St Edmund Bede’s account of the poet Cædmon Old English Riddles from the Exeter Book Saint Æthelthryth (from Ælfric’s Lives of Saints) Saint Eugenia (from the Old English Martyrology) J.

It focuses on a group of approximately ten Canadian poets who have formed and responded to the Canadian literary landscape since World War II. Most of the poets covered in the course are writers who confront modern and contemporary ideas about the nature of self, society, sexuality, gender, and art, but we also look at the ways in which these writers are trying to deal with the existential implications of new views about science, religion, and the poet’s place in a rapidly changing world. Since part of the reading involves thinking about aesthetic and theoretical issues, the course will deal with these issues, just as it will pay close attention to the meaning and resonance of particular poems. At the same time, it will consider the ways in which these poets (and us, as readers) construct the place called Canada as a metaphor that’s central to our daily lives. Students are encouraged to explore multi-media material related to each poet in question. The writing component of the course (a series of short assignments and a final paper) is designed to improve interpretive abilities and writing skills; the course encourages personal forms of critical expression. For this reason, this course will appeal to students who wish to broaden their understanding of poetry in general and will provide new ways of thinking about how poetry works. Students enrolling in this course should be prepared to participate actively in class discussion. Texts: TBD. Evaluation: A series of short assignments (50%); final paper (25%); attendance (10%); participation (15%). Format: Lecture and discussion.  [course link engl 335] Postwar British Novel Professor Allan Hepburn Fall 2024 T/Th 4-5:30 Description: This course will focus on British fiction written between the Second World War and the end of the twentieth century. This survey of selected novels will focus on class, the Welfare State, responses to the war, housing, planning, conceptions of the future, the status of children and refugees, evil, women, gender, the decline of imperialism, sexuality, and fictional technique. Generic conventions of comedy and tragedy as they mix with novelistic representation will inform lectures, as will distinctions between mass-market and highbrow fiction.

Rather than focus on the individual talent or overarching historical forces, we will take up what James English has called the “middle zone of cultural space.” This is the zone of agents, publishers, translators, booksellers, prize committees, university English departments, creative writing programs, canon warriors, Goodreads, Amazon, and Oprah. Pairing critical readings with novels and short fiction, we will investigate the central institutions, figures, and forces that mediate contemporary literary production and reception. Who are the “unacknowledged legislators” of the literary field, and how do they come between writer and reader to shape what each can and should do? What forces influence our conceptions of aesthetic value, and how is literary prestige measured and doled out? How do literary texts circulate within a culture, and how have they travelled across national and linguistic boundaries? In all, students in this course will encounter a variety of critical and artistic texts that do not rely on the concept of “literariness,” but rather investigate how such a thing is produced in the first place. Texts: Percival Everett, Erasure (2001); Clayton Childress, Under the Cover: The Creation, Production, and Reception of a Novel (2017); R.F.

[course link engl 347] Virgil and Ovid Professor Maggie Kilgour Winter 2025 Time TBA Prerequisite: None. Expected Student Preparation: Previous university courses in English or classical literature. A basic knowledge of Homeric epic will be assumed in lectures. Students therefore should read the Iliad and the Odyssey before taking this course. Previous work on poetry is also strongly advised. Description: This course will focus on the writings of Virgil and Ovid, their relationship to the Augustan period, and their enormous influence on later Western literature. The two Roman poets seem to present contrasting models for the poet’s relation to society broadly and to political power specifically. For Virgil, poetry appears to be a means of binding society together; for Ovid, it is a means of taking it apart critically. While we will spend most time looking at their epics, The Aeneid and Metamorphoses, we will also study the development of both authors through their different works, and discuss the significance of their decisions to explore the specific genres of pastoral, georgic, elegy, and epic. The writers’ antithetical career paths leading to distinct epic visions offer alternative images for later writers of what it means to be a poet. By looking at the two writers together, however, we will also consider the complex intertextual dynamics between their two positions, noting especially how Ovid intensifies as well as rewrites Virgil’s exploration of desire, exile and alienation, and of the function of poetry itself. Format: Lecture and discussion Evaluation: In class mid-term, 20%; 10 pp. term paper, 40%; final exam, 30%; class participation, 10%.

Although the course number is the same, the content is entirely different; therefore, these will count as two different courses toward university and program requirements. For English Literature majors, this course counts toward the “backgrounds” requirement. Description: The Arthurian legends grew to become an extremely rich and diverse body of literature by the later Middle Ages, and the idea of Arthur continues to fascinate today. Having emerged in the fifth and sixth centuries, tales about King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table have since spread across six continents and dozens of languages. They have inspired fictional stories, blockbuster movies, and historical study internationally. Further, they touch upon many fields of study including literature, history, and archaeology. Our goal in this course is to examine this phenomenon as it developed in the medieval period (to ca. 1500) and explore some of the reasons why the Arthurian legends have become so integral to multi-cultural and interdisciplinary pursuits. Over the course of the semester, we will engage the Arthurian legends by investigating how their central themes, figures, and literary situations change across different linguistic and cultural traditions and periods, as well as how they became central to Welsh, English, and French identities. Where is the line between fact and fiction in Arthurian legends? What constitutes an Arthurian legend? Why do the legends occupy such an important place in the literary and cultural imaginations of medieval writers and readers? How and why are medieval notions of “courtly love” and “chivalry,” as exhibited in the Arthurian legends, important to readers in later social and historical contexts? How are Arthurian stories rewritten or adapted by various authors, and how do these different texts represent the concerns or preoccupations of different historical moments? We will read most texts in modern English translation, though some will be read in the original Middle English. Prior experience with Middle English is not mandatory or expected, and regular practice with the language will be included in many class sessions.

This class is largely focused on film and video, but with consideration of television, digital media, installation and performance, with works drawn from LGBTQ2IA+ perspectives. We will explore topics such as the links between sexualities and representation, subversive and clandestine portrayals of queer sexualities, the emergence of gay and lesbian cinema in the 1970s alongside civil rights movements, the ongoing HIV/ AIDS epidemic and the media, the New Queer cinema of the 1990s, experimental film and video, pornography, , activist documentary, queer aesthetics and the social, political and cultural contexts of production, exhibition and reception. What is queer cinema today and how it is in dialogue with historical and contemporary conditions of production, reception and analysis alongside the changing status of the idea of “queer”? Screenings will include films from multiple world cinema contexts, and will include features, documentaries and experimental/ underground cinema. We will also engage and attend Montreal based festivals, production and queer media communities to consider how cultural conditions of reception and circulation also produce and sustain queer media. Texts: Films will include numerous short form media, as well as feature films. Attendance at class screenings is mandatory. Evaluation: TBD.

Beginning from the assumption that theatre, like all art, is a form of communication, our study examines the qualities unique to theatrical communication in all its forms. The course is a combination of practical analysis of play scripts and theatre, and consideration of theoretical texts. Commencing with Aristotle, we interrogate the premises of his Poetics and the marginalization of opsis (spectacle) in his study. The rest of the course is composed of a series of units: our first unit examines theatrical communication with an emphasis on the dramatic text and how the text may be broken down into minimal communicative units of action. Our second unit moves from the practical study of a script to the analysis of live theatre with an emphasis on how meaning emerges in the spectable. We will consider both theoretical ideas about theatrical signs and theatre semiotics, and also practical tools for analyzing theatre. Our third unit examines the function of the actor on stage and how the actor’s performance creates meaning and significance in theatrical communication. We also consider the dynamic relationship between humans and objects in the theatre, such as puppets or stage props, and what these elements tell us about the experience of theatre as a whole. Finally, our fourth unit opens us to broader questions about communication in the theatre: the implications of theatre as storytelling, the importance of the spectator’s experience of the theatre as the locus of meaning, and the function of stage and theatre spaces in theatre art. As a case study we will consider the contemporary example of Verbatim theatre. The overall goal of the course is to give you a foundational understanding of key theories of the poetics of performance, so that you may build upon this knowledge through your later studies as Theatre and Drama majors.

Description: The fifteenth century in England was a dynamic time when concepts of authorship, communication, textual production, and literacy were undergoing tremendous change. English was developing quickly as England’s official language—something that hadn’t been the case for centuries, following the Norman Conquest—now overtaking French and Latin. Heresy and its suppression met with a burgeoning humanist movement, and mainstream religious practice was vibrant and varied. In the second half of the fifteenth century, the medieval invention of printing with movable type coexisted with a lively manuscript culture in England. This course situates fifteenth-century English literature in its dynamic cultural contexts, examining how late-medieval literature in England intersected with developments in politics, popular culture, literacy, religious controversy, technology, and gender relations. Readings will range from a devout woman’s defiant memoir to a bureaucrat’s struggle with anonymity; from a legalistic dream vision to romantic treatments of the outlaw Robin Hood. We’ll analyze the explosion of fifteenth-century dramatic production and culminate with Thomas Malory’s sophisticated re-imagining of Arthurian romance traditions during the Wars of the Roses. Students will also get to see original medieval manuscripts and early printed texts during workshops with items from McGill’s Rare Books and Special Collections. All primary texts will be read in the original Middle English, though no previous knowledge of the language is required. Portions of several classes will be spent developing proficiency in Middle English. Texts (Provisional):  Thomas Hoccleve, My Compleinte and Other Poems John Lydgate, The Temple of Glass Thomas Malory, Le Morte D’Arthur The Book of Margery Kempe Robin Hood and Other Outlaw Tales Selections from collections of medieval drama  Evaluation (provisional): Final assessment, 30% ; Close reading exercises, 10%; Analytical essays, 40%; Rare Books response, 5%; In-class translation, 5%; Participation and attendance, 10% Format: Lectures and discussions  [course link engl 357] Troilus and Criseyde Dr. Antje Chan Fall 2024 Time TBA Prerequisites: None Note: We will read Chaucer in the original Middle English, however no previous knowledge of the language is required. Time in class will be spent developing proficiency in Middle English. Description: At the beginning of Geoffrey Chaucer’s life (1340s), Europe was undergoing a period of social change in the wake of the Black Death. Global trade networks across the continent and beyond the Mediterranean facilitated cultural exchanges more than ever before. The literature produced and circulated in Chaucer’s lifetime was profoundly marked by an exchange of ideas rooted in classical, Italian, French and Middle Eastern sources. This admixture of ideas manifested in multilingual manuscripts, engaged with international political, religious, and cultural concerns. As the son of a wine merchant, and a man involved in the English wool trade, Chaucer was deeply shaped by the exchange of things and ideas between England and the continent. It is in such setting that Chaucer’s Troilus and Criseyde was written. This course will delve deeply into Troilus and Criseyde, which was considered for centuries after Chaucer’s death his masterpiece. While the poem tells the story of Troilus’ twin sorrows: his lovesickness and his despair both caused by his love for Criseyde, we will explore this poem of unusual psychological depth by considering questions such as how do we live; how porous is the nature of identity; the equivocacy of privacy/secrecy; notions of causality; as well as literary questions such as what does it mean to write fiction; how does one achieve literary authority; and what are the conventions of the art of love and of writings about love? Texts (provisional):  Geoffrey Chaucer, Troilus and Criseyde (Norton or Riverside) Boccacio, Il Filostrato Robert Henryson, The Testament of Cresseid Boethius, The Consolation of Philosophy  Boccacio, The Decameron (selections)  Evaluation (provisional): participation and attendance 10%; short essays 20%; term paper 40%; final assessment 30% Format: Lectures and discussions  [course link engl 359] Professor Ara Osterweil Winter 2025 Class Meeting: T/Th 11:30-13:00 Mandatory Screening: M 18:00-20:30 Expected Preparation: This course is intended for students in the Cultural Studies stream. It is a required course for Cultural Studies majors, and should be ideally taken in the term after the student has taken Introduction to Film Studies and Introduction to Cultural Studies, although this timeline is not required. This course can also potentially count towards the World Cinema minor, provided that the student has not taken too many other courses in the English department. Description: This course is designed to teach students how to meaningfully close read image-based cultural texts. Using multiple strategies of visual analysis, students will learn how to perform perceptive, informed, and medium-specific interpretations of both still and moving images. Focusing our critical lens on some of the most innovative photography and film texts of the last century, we will study the nuances of composition, color, mise-en-scène, framing, camera movement, editing and sound. Paying close attention to the ways in which visual style creates meaning, students will learn to look beyond narrative and dialogue in order to understand both the semiotics and poetics of the image. In addition to numerous close-reading exercises, we will be supplementing our investigation of images with several classical texts by theorists such as John Berger, Roland Barthes, André Bazin, Sergei Eisenstein, Christina Sharpe, Jacques Lacan, Sigmund Freud, Kaja Silverman, Stan Brakhage, Laura Marks, and Maya Deren. Students must come to class having completed all of the assigned reading and will be expected to participate verbally in class on a weekly basis. Lectures will be illustrated by copious examples. In addition to lectures, there is a mandatory screening every week as well as several discussion sessions led by a Teaching Assistant throughout the semester. Format: Two lecture/ discussions per week, one mandatory screening per week, and occasional writing workshops led in additional conference time with the Teaching Assistant.

[course link engl 360] Professor Sandeep Banerjee Winter 2025 Time TBA Description: This course will explore several topics that are central to modern and contemporary literary criticism and critical theory. These include, but are not limited to, representation, narrative, interpretation, ideology, signification, discourse as well as categories of difference such as class, race, gender, and sexuality. We will read excerpts from key texts from a range of critical thinkers, schools and practices to interrogate and engage with some of the fundamental that have animated literary studies: What constitutes literature? Who determines what texts mean, and how? How do texts relate to broader social structures? Considering these questions will necessitate careful and patient engagement with critical texts that will on occasion be dense and difficult. Note: This is a required course for students of the Literature Honors stream. All other students should contact me for permission to register. Texts:  Terry Eagleton – Literary Theory: An Introduction  Readings from works by specific theorists will be provided. Evaluation: Take home exams and papers. Format: Lectures and discussion.

Expected Student Preparation: Familiarity with concepts and terminology from film studies and cultural studies will be useful. Background in history is also helpful but not required. Description: This course examines the development of cinema during the most radical decade of political resistance and artistic innovation in American history. Juxtaposing an analysis of mainstream films alongside the study of experimental and independent cinema, this course situates the revolution in cinematic form and content in the larger context of the social and political transformations of the 1960s. By putting Hollywood into dialogue with its alternatives, this course examines how cinema of this period approached complex issues such as: the decline of the Hollywood studio system and the Production Code Administration, the escalating Cold War, political paranoia and assassination, the student protest movement, racial politics and the struggle for civil rights, the sexual revolution, the emergence of gay rights, the Vietnam war, the legacy of earlier progressive movements such as the Popular Front, hippie culture, and the increasing role of the media, or what theorist Guy Debord termed “the society of the spectacle.” We will study some of the most important films of the decade, including works by Hollywood directors such as John Huston, Robert Aldrich, John Schlesinger, Stanley Kubrick, and Arthur Penn, independent mavericks such as John Cassavetes, Michael Roemer, and George Romero, as well as experimental filmmakers such as Andy Warhol, Kenneth Anger, Carolee Schneemann, and Stan Brakhage. Attendance at weekly screenings is mandatory; readings are copious.

Description: Emphasis is on costume design for the theatre, and the development of the various tools used to communicate design concepts. Weekly design modules focus on tools such as script analysis, colour palette, developing a design concept, transformation of characters, design stylization - all focused on the creation of original costume designs. The concepts covered in class will be practiced by students in weekly skill building exercises, culminating in individual final projects. The main communication tool is sketching, using each student’s medium of choice, such as water colour paints, design markers, coloured pencils, or digital tools. It is not critical to be proficient at sketching – it is more important to have creative ideas and the motivation to communicate visually, but also verbally, and in written form. The various homework exercises and projects will take a steady amount of time throughout the semester and will culminate in a final project. Evaluation:  Weekly at-home exercises. The details given here are examples only. Content may vary. Design Concepts, Colour Palette, Developing Base Costumes, Stylized Period, Future & Fantasy, Innovative sourcing for period costumes. Participation – attendance, participating in discussions, contributing ideas, participation in workshops – 10% Final project – Independent costume design which integrates all learning modules into one final creative endeavour. The assignment is based on a script of the student’s choice. Final project grade value: 30%  Format: lectures, demonstrations, collaborative learning processes, and artistic exercises.

[course link engl 366] Horror Film Professor Ned Schantz Winter 2024 Time TBA Description: This course will introduce students to the versatility of horror and pose the question of its ongoing adaptability. It will unfold in three units. The first and last units involve the question of the monster and the sheltering, threatening, atmospheric spaces it approaches or inhabits. Sandwiched between those considerations will be a central unit on horror feelings, which we will attempt to complicate. No longer will we be content to judge simply whether a horror film is “scary;” instead, we will explore the genre’s production of a broad palette of feeling, including key neighbours of fear such as disgust, anger, and shame. Indeed, even fear itself might be usefully divided into slow dread and fast panic (which is one reason why the speed of zombies matters). It is ultimately this rich interplay of response, in dialogue with the longstanding critique of the monster, that will help us more fully articulate the genre’s corresponding socio-political work, including its importance for feminism, queer theory and critical race theory. Possible films include The Shining, The Haunting, It Follows, Babadook, Get Out, and Parasite.

Note that this term we will study the period in reverse chronological order (Romantic to Restoration). The course is divided into four chronological units encompassing the development of stage spectacle, the age of Garrick and the professionalisation of theatre, the rise of morality and sentiment in drama, and the reopening of the professional theatre and the advent of the professional actress. Each unit will cover the theatrical conditions of the period and will examine a representative play staged at the time. Emphasis is placed on the plays as theatrical works rather than literary texts. Students will be asked to conceptualise performances of the plays as they might have taken place in the long eighteenth century and how these performances might have been received. We will also analyse historical documents to explore themes such as genre, acting style, audience experience, theatre architecture, financial practices, regulation of the stage, and company management. We will work with McGill Library’s Rare Books and Special Collections to complete a series of hands-on workshops and assignments with a collection of playbills from the period. This will allow us to deepen our understanding of theatre in the long eighteenth century through the study of print culture.

As the nation experienced industrialization, urbanization, immigration, changing sexual and gender norms, and violent cultural and racial conflicts in the afterlife of Trans-Atlantic slavery and Indigenous genocide, popular entertainments attracted mass audiences and created spectacles of national inclusion and othering. Units on blackface minstrelsy, “Indian plays,” vaudeville, social dance, and other popular form address antebellum and post-Emancipation stagings of race; frontier spectacles; freak shows and penny museums; imperialism; and the complexities of social inequity in the Golden Age/Progressive Era. Through discussions and lectures, we will consider the place of the “popular” – in its classed, ethnic, racial, gendered, erotic, commercial, and hegemonic valences – in forging styles of U.S. citizenship and belonging that persist to the current day, albeit often in camouflage.

Description: ENGL 380 is an opportunity to think in depth about the art of nonfictional cinema. We’ll investigate the ways in which and the reasons why nonfictional movies differ decisively from fictional ones. The differences between these two mega-categories mainly have to do with the particular ends and effects that makers design their movies to achieve. Fictional and nonfictional movies can be very similar to one another in many interesting respects. Both categories are, of course, full of works manifesting virtuoso and imaginative uses of the cinematic medium’s characteristic tools and practices. And both contain many examples of makers presenting stories in ways apt to arouse viewers’ emotions and challenge them intellectually. Yet beyond such similarities are myriad differences between fiction- and nonfiction-makers’ expressive, cognitive, and artistic projects. Evaluation: Brief written assignments, term paper. Format: Lectures, discussions, screenings.  [course link engl 390] Black Feminist Theories  Professor Amber Rose Johnson Fall 2024 13:00-14:30 EDUC 211 Description: This course will trace the development of black feminisms from the mid nineteenth-century to the present—with the focus largely on contemporary Black feminisms from the 1970s to today. Central to our exploration will be the analysis of the intersectional relationship between theory and practice, and between race, gender, class, and sexuality. Focusing on black women’s political struggles in the US and Canada (in addition to some engagements with the Caribbean) we will consider: The significance of transatlantic slavery to contemporary Black experiences. The ways that Black women have been subject to and resisted racism, sexism, homophobia, and economic oppression. And the ways that Black expressive cultures—visual art, literature, poetry, film, etc.—challenge dominant constructions of Black identity formations. Readings, viewings, and listenings may include: Anna Julia Cooper, Patricia Hill Collins, Barbara Smith, Audre Lorde, Angela Davis, Jamila Woods, Morgan Parker and Dionne Brand.

Drawing from Fiona Handyside’s observation that “girlhood is a visual construction,” this course insists that girlhood cinemas have their own unique stylistic approaches to coming-of-age narratives, demanding careful formal analysis. “Girlhood Cinemas” will explore two aesthetic concepts each week in relation to a girlhood film, from traditional understandings of girlhood aesthetics, like cuteness and prettiness, to the less-theorized concepts of quietude and witchiness. A global and intersectional cinema course, we will discuss films from a diverse array of filmmakers and countries, from Indigenous Canadian productions to diasporic Zambian films. Together, we will read works of feminist theory and philosophy, cinema studies, and girlhood studies to build an understanding of how girlhood is stylistically constructed in cinema. By the end of this course, students will be able to: 1) explicate key aesthetic devices used to portray girlhood in cinema; 2) apply formal reading strategies to complex arthouse and independent film productions; 3) compare and contrast differences across national cinemas using transnational analysis; 4) analyze how intersectional identities shape onscreen girlhoods; and 5) conceptualize novel “aesthetic categories” of girlhood using theories of visual cultures and aesthetics. As a class, we will ask: How is girlhood used around the world as a medium for constructing aesthetic categories and exploring the moral complexities of living?

Professor Yael Halevi-Wise Winter 2025 T/R 16:00-17:30 Description: Historical Novels became widely influential in the 19th Century as an expression of new attitudes toward national identities. To acquire a deep understanding of this popular literary form, students will design their own Historical Novel in this course, while responding to four variations of the genre and four key scholarly discussions of it. In other words, this course has an academic as well as creative component but note that you are certainly not expected to produce a full-fledged novel at the end of the semester—just an outline and sample chapter along with a detailed discussion of how our readings help you negotiate the genre’s opportunities and pitfalls.

Students should request to enroll in the course before the end of add/drop. Please contact Sean Carney at sean.carney@mcgill.ca for more information. Description: This three-credit course provides students with credit towards their Drama and Theatre majors, minors, or honors degrees. Students who are cast in the English Department’s Fall 2024 theatre production may ask for permission to enroll in ENGL 396. This is a graded course (see “Evaluation” below). The course may satisfy the “3 credits from a list of performance-oriented courses” requirement for Drama and Theatre Majors or the “additional credits from the Drama and Theatre option’s offerings” requirement for Drama and Theatre Majors and Minors. The content of the course involves attending all required rehearsals and performances for the production, required meetings with costume designers, participating in the strike on closing night, and showing dedicated commitment to the process and to the overall production. There is also a written component required, most likely a reflection essay at the end of the process. Evaluation: TBA  400-Level Advanced Courses [course link engl 400] Elizabethan Romance Professor Kenneth Borris Fall 2024 Time TBA Description: One of the centrally fashionable literary genres of early modern Europe, romance was the most important precursor of the novel, though in many ways different. It was characterized by much narrative variety, multiple plots, open-ended structures, digression, coincidence, fantasy, wonder, and wish-fulfilment; in its uniquely serendipitous version of the world, few social conventions or expectations can be taken for granted. Its major exponents include Ariosto, Tasso, Cervantes, Sidney, Spenser, and Shakespeare. From around 1575 to 1610, the writing of romance became particularly vibrant in England. Focusing on the diverse expressions of this literary form at this time there, in prose fiction, narrative poetry, and drama, this course should especially interest those attracted to early modern studies, or to the history and development of the novel, or to the theory and history of literary forms. Proceeding chronologically, the course will address texts that epitomize romance’s scope in this period, including the qualitatively best and most influential exemplars, as well as those that were most popular in sales, such as Robert Greene’s, which illustrate the genre’s cultural topicality. So as best to define romance and its interactions with other genres in particular texts that engineer complex generic mixtures, such as Sidney’s and Spenser’s, attention will be given to the theory of literary genres.

By the end of the term, students will be able to identify key components of crime novels, distinguish between different subgenres of crime fiction, read critically to identify narratological elements of the genre, demonstrate familiarity with the crime writer’s toolkit by using it in the service of their own preliminary story outline, and perhaps even follow clues and ignore red herrings to anticipate novelistic outcomes.

Page Professor Robert Lecker Fall 2024 Time TBA (Note: For English Majors, this course qualifies for the required three credits from a course in Canadian literature or for a course on a major author) Description: In this course we will delve into the multifaceted worlds of two compelling Canadian artist/writers: Leonard Cohen and P.K. Page. Through their poetry, fiction, music, and painting, both address many of the prominent concerns emerging in their era: the morality and purpose of the writer; the nature of spirituality; the impact of the natural world; the possibility of aesthetic transcendence. Cohen often wondered whether he was a metaphor. Or, as he put it, “I cannot understand why my arm is not a lilac tree.” Page meditated on the power of creativity: “If we but give it time, a work of art ‘can rap and knock and enter our souls’ and re-align us – all our molecules – to make us whole again.” Cohen, celebrated for his dual roles as a musician and poet, presents a compelling study in the convergence of literature and popular culture. We will trace Cohen’s literary evolution from the Beat generation to the complexities of celebrity status and its impact on Cohen's life and work, examining how fame shaped his artistic identity and influenced his creative process. In this context, we will experience his poetry, listen to his music, read some of his fiction, and watch a variety of films and videos focussing on different periods in his career. Eventually, at the age of 80, he had to go back on tour to support himself. Cohen had a succinct response to that experience: “I like life on the road. It's a lot easier than civilian life. You kind of feel like you're in a motorcycle gang.” P.K. Page, often regarded as one of Canada's most innovative and celebrated poets, crafted a body of work that transcends conventional boundaries of poetic form and subject matter. Page's poetry exhibits a remarkable versatility, ranging from traditional verse forms to experimental free verse. And it is often mysterious. Page said that “I liked poetry better when I wasn't sure what it meant.” Page’s evolution is marked by the time she spent in Brazil and Mexico, where she turned to drawing and painting. We will look at the paintings she created during this period and consider them as visual expressions of her shifting poetics. Page's poetry grapples with pressing social and political issues, reflecting her commitment to justice and human rights. Whether addressing the legacies of colonialism in Canada, the ravages of war and conflict, feminist aesthetics, or the urgent need for environmental conservation, Page's poetry is marked by a fierce determination to bear witness to the injustices of her time. As early as 1981, she anticipated global warming. For the past two decades, Page's poems have celebrated the planet, but they also remind us of widespread ecological peril. As she wrote in 1990: \"Art and the planet tell us. Change your life.\" Texts: TBD. Evaluation: A series of short essays (50%); final essay (20%); participation (20%); attendance (10%).

This seminar troubles the underlying assumptions of this debate—that race is an adult subject, and that childhood has ever been separated from it. As we will explore in this course, children’s literature and culture were key sites for instilling the historical relations of American slavery, colonialism, and white supremacy—and they have also been major sites for challenging the effects and legacies of these histories. In this course, we will examine the dominant literary construction of white American childhood across the late-nineteenth and 20th centuries. We will also study texts that illustrate how black, Indigenous, and Latinx North American people fought to make a place for their children in literary, cultural, and educational spheres. By examining formations of childhood as they vary across historical periods and competing ideologies, we will highlight both the ‘constructedness’ of childhood as a social category, and the literary forms through which childhood has derived coherence and cultural power. From the pictorial primer, to the coming-of-age novel, to contemporary YA graphic literature—to books frequently “banned” from children’s reading—we will advance toward a critical understanding of children’s literature as a major rather than minor category of American literature. Bringing questions of literacy, pedagogy, narrative structure, and social hierarchy together, we will test critical race theories and develop our own. Selected texts may include: Mark Twain, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, L. Frank Baum, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Francis La Flesche, The Middle Five, Jessie Fauset and W.E.B.

Winner of the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize, recipient of a MacArthur “Genius” grant and the nearly-as-lucrative honor of Oprah’s Book Club, and the most contemporary novelist included in the Norton Anthology of African American Literature, Whitehead stands at the very center of the contemporary canon. According to critics and scholars alike, part of what makes Whitehead so singular is his ability to write across a vast array of literary and mass-cultural forms: detective and encyclopedic fiction (The Intuitionist [1999], John Henry Days [2001]), contemporary satire and the bildungsroman (Apex Hides the Hurt [2006], Sag Harbor [2009]), and more recently, zombie fiction, the meta-slave narrative, and the heist novel (Zone One [2011], The Underground Railroad [2016], Harlem Shuffle [2021]). Students in this course will investigate the trajectory of Whitehead’s body of work as well as how his oeuvre indexes contemporary issues of Black literary production, historical memory, and canon formation. Over the course of the semester, we will study (nearly) all of Whitehead’s published novels, including the newly-published installments of his “Harlem Trilogy.” Texts: The Intuitionist (1999); John Henry Days (2001); Apex Hides the Hurt (2006); Zone One (2011); The Underground Railroad (2016); The Nickel Boys (2019); Harlem Shuffle (2021); Crook Manifesto (2023).

Her fiction reflects experiments in modernist technique as well as her cosmopolitan disposition. Mobility is a central preoccupation in her fiction. With examples drawn from both her novels and short fiction, this course will examine Bowen’s thoughts on war, women, land ownership, hospitality, aristocratic privilege, Irish history, civic responsibility, friendship, hotel culture, motherhood, interior decoration, atmosphere, extramarital affairs, and other topics. In her essays, Bowen frequently comments on her contemporaries and their writing: Virginia Woolf, Ivy Compton-Burnett, D.H. Lawrence, Anton Chekhov, Guy de Maupassant. Essays about style, short stories, the state of the novel will therefore be threaded into the course to widen the parameters of discussion. Part of the course will be devoted to archival materials—letters in particular—that develop understanding about Bowen’s aesthetic and public engagements. Prerequisite: This course is for advanced students. Expected preparation is 3 or 4 prior courses in English literature. Format: Lecture and discussion. Evaluation: bibliography, essay, attendance and participation, final exam Texts: Elizabeth Bowen: a selection of short stories and essays; The Last September, Friends and Relations, To the North, The House in Paris, The Death of the Heart, The Heat of the Day  [course link engl 419] Breaking the Sequence: Narrative Interventions in Early Twentieth-Century Experimental Fiction Professor Miranda Hickman Fall 2024 Time TBA Preparation: At least one course at the 200 or 300 level, ideally addressing twentieth-century literature Description: Early twentieth-century modernist narrative, by writers such as Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Zora Neale Hurston, and Jean Rhys, often aimed to “break” the “expected sequence,” to borrow a phrase from the collection of modernist experimental women’s writing. Often writers were re-thinking narrative sequencing toward formal innovation, seeking narrative strategies to represent sensitively the passage of thought and consciousness, designed to gain more sensitive purchase on what Woolf called the “quick of the mind” and the “places of psychology.” Many sought new narrative techniques that have subsequently been recognized as versions of “stream of consciousness.” Others, such as Dorothy Richardson and Gertrude Stein, in tandem with formal experiment per se, sought to critique and write their way beyond expected sequences and scripts in the culture - associated with the marriage plot and what Adrienne Rich would later call “compulsory heterosexuality”; with “Bildung,” or concepts of education, formation and development; and with cultural scripts ascribing roles to women and men. Some, such as H.D. and Bryher, and Ralph Ellison, aspired actively to intervene in fictions of development – such as the Bildungsroman or the related genre, the Künstlerroman, and the normative cultural assumptions – about construction of identity, gender and sexuality, racialized positionality, class - underwriting these genres and which they helped to sustain. This course considers a range of such “narrative interventions,” construed in several senses – both efforts to reimagine language and narrative form for different ways of understanding modern life, individuals, and communities; and to revise understandings of the narratives and plots according to which individuals and communities form their senses of identity, history and visions for the future. Texts (Tentative):  Anand, Mulk Raj, Untouchable (1935) Bryher, Two Selves (1922) Ellison, Ralph, Invisible Man (1953) H.D., HERmione (1926-27) Hurston, Zora Neale, Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937) Joyce, James, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) Larsen, Nella, Passing (1929) Richardson, Dorothy, Pointed Roofs (1915) Woolf, Virginia, Mrs. Dalloway (1925) and Orlando (1928)  Format: Lecture and Discussion  Evaluation: Brief responses (10%); 2 briefer critical essays (4-5pp., each 20%); creative project (4-5pp., 15%); longer essay (7pp., 25%); participation (10%)  [course link engl 422] The Emergence of the Modern American Short Story through the Long Nineteenth Century Professor Peter Gibian Winter 2025 Time TBA Expected Student Preparation: Previous coursework in American Literature before 1900, or in 19th-century British fiction, or permission of instructor. Description: Intensive study of a diverse range of shorter prose fictions produced by American authors—mainly over the course of the long nineteenth century, but culminating in close readings of some of the classic short stories produced in the early twentieth century, and ending with a quick look at some contemporary case studies that develop and test the potential in earlier models. Rather than tracing a singular evolution of the short story mode, we will explore a variety of authors whose works test the possibilities of the short form in very different ways. Each of these writers discovered early on that the short story is not simply a miniaturized novel but operates as a literary vehicle with its own distinctive powers and limitations. After an introductory review of recent scholarly work on the theory of the modern short story, and on the history of its development, we will survey a selection of foundational and influential short fictions that reveal the short story’s uses in relation to myth, romance, and the fantastic; to uncanny plots about ghosts and haunting; to evocation of suppressed emotional or psychic states; to representation of neglected cultural identities; to the impulses of regionalism; to urban experience; to crime and detection; and to self-reflexive interrogations of fictional form itself. Indeed the short story has often served for thoughtful and ambitious American writers not only as a simple form with which they could begin their literary training but as a privileged site for self-conscious experimentation with new modes of imagery, new subject matter, and new narrative techniques. Though it may sometimes be seen as minor, low-brow, and popularizing, always hidden in the shadow of the high art of the Great American Novel, the short story in fact frequently functions as a rarefied realm for serious ideological and formal critique—a testing-ground for the most advanced critical and self-critical thinking by American writers. We will focus on the foundational works of authors selected from the following list: Irving, Poe, Hawthorne, Melville, Harte, Twain, Cable, Chesnutt, Gilman, Chopin, Jewett, James, Wharton, Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Faulkner, Anderson, Porter. More contemporary case studies may include works by authors such as O’Connor, Updike, Cheever, Salinger, Baldwin, Diaz, Mukherjee, Lahiri, Paley, Kincaid, Carver, Ohlin, Saunders, Egan, and Davis. Texts: Course-pack collections of a wide range of short fiction Evaluation (Tentative): Attendance and participation in discussions, 15%; series of 3 brief textual analyses, 15%; two critical essays, 20% each (or one extended research paper, 40%); take-home final exam, 30%.

As we move geographically through the hemisphere, we will learn about the political, cultural, social, and economic factors informing theatrical production. Thematic concerns include: theatre against dictatorship in the Southern Cone and beyond; migration and exile; indigeneity; political theatre in the “borderlands;” gender and sexuality; populism, protest, and “Theatre of the Oppressed;” histories of collective creation in the Americas; and expressions of Latina/o North American identities. The course will be taught in English; all texts will be provided in English translation.

What is a sonnet, what does it do with language, what does it do to and for us? We will start with Shakespeare’s Sonnets, with how they took life from their Italian precursors, especially Petrarch, and from a number of English innovators, and how they grew larger in a kind of dialogue with sonnet-writers such as Edmund Spenser and Philip Sidney. The early modern literary field is foundational (including Donne and Milton for example), but it is not by any means the end of our work. We will range far and wide in our study of this amazing way of making our language speak in new ways—from the Romantics, the Victorians, and up to our own time. And, of course, and since it is has wandered far afield, we will not restrict ourselves to the Sonnet in England. There is no prohibition against the use of ChatGPT and/or similar AI systems in the course.

This course will focus on a range of literary texts to examine their environmental imagination. It will draw out how the texts imagine the environment and, just as crucially, the interaction between human beings and external nature, and between humans and non-humans. It will also situate these texts in relation to theorizations of the production of nature and space as well as to the broad and uneven terrain of ecocriticism and environmental criticism. Considering these questions will necessitate careful and patient engagement with critical texts that will on occasion be dense and difficult. Possible Texts (to be finalized later):  Amitav Ghosh – Gun Island Peter Matthiessen – The Snow Leopard Jamaica Kincaid – A Small Place Indra Sinha – Animal’s People Gita Mehta – A River Sutra  Selections from the poems of Rabindranath Tagore, Jibanananda Das, Arun Kolatkar. Selections from theoretical and critical texts. Evaluation: Take home exams and papers. Format: Lectures and discussion.  [course link engl 444] Women’s Voices in Medieval Literature Dr. Antje Chan Fall 2024 Time TBA Prerequisites: None Description: The Middle Ages is a period of literary history which is often considered as scarce in terms of women’s writings. However, medieval understandings of literature, authorship, textual circulation, and processes of writing do not fit neatly into later periods’ conceptions. For example, modern notions of authorship have often been reductive when considering women’s writings in the Middle Ages. Women’s voices permeated medieval literary culture, not only as writers, collaborators through amanuenses, translation, or adaptation, but also as patrons, manuscript owners, readers, and subjects of texts. By adopting a nuanced understanding of the production and reception of texts, one can discern a rich and vibrant picture of women’s participation in the literary culture of the Middle Ages. From Marie de France, Bridget of Sweden, and Catherine of Siena, to Julian of Norwich, Margery Kempe, and Christine de Pizan, this course considers a wide range of women’s voices, unveiling a multifaceted and collaborative literary culture where women’s influential views formed and transformed ideas of writing, reading, and gender. Texts (provisional):  Marie de France, Lais (selection) Marguerite Porete, Mirror of Simple Souls Bridget of Sweden, Liber Caelestis (selection) Catherine of Siena, The Dialogue Julian of Norwich, Revelations Christine de Pizan, The Treasure of the City of Ladies Margery Kempe, The Book of Margery Kempe The Paston Letters (selection)  Evaluation (provisional): participation and attendance 10%; short essays 20%; term paper 40%; final assessment 30% Format: Lectures and discussions  [course link engl 456] / [course link mdst 400] Jews, Muslims, and Christians in Late-Medieval English Literature  Professor Michael Van Dussen Winter 2025 Time TBA Prerequisites: None Note: For English Literature Majors, this course counts toward the “Middle English” requirement. Description: Sustained representations of Jews and Muslims appear frequently in Middle English drama, romance, travel writing, and other genres after 1350, though few Jews or Muslims could be found living in England in the later Middle Ages (ca. 1350-1500). In fact, the Jews had been expelled from England in 1290. Later literary representations would seem, then, to stem from knowledge of continued international religious politics or textual influences that included older characterizations from England, the European continent, Asia, and Africa. English chivalric romances often ranged geographically over the regions like the Iberian Peninsula, with its sizeable Muslim population, or took place in an imagined Roman Empire that aligned pre-Christian Roman rulers with “Saracen” (Muslim) forces, pitting them both against Christians and drawing on the fraught memory of the medieval crusades. Muslim soldiers, leaders, and women (who sometimes fight) seem to participate with Christians in a shared chivalric value system and are often praised. In these contexts, the language of what we might call “race” is bound up with questions of religious belief and conversion. Christianity in late-medieval England was also a strange beast. In the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries we witness the rise of a vibrant lay piety, the first complete translation of the Bible into English, and an academic heresy that spilled over the walls of the university and into the streets. Some of these developments were in turn met by a severe response that was not always consistent with attitudes on the continent. Accusations of heresy sometimes drew on the language of interfaith polemic, and the lines that were drawn between heresy and non-Christian religions were not always clear. Students in this course will study English literary representations of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity from the later Middle Ages (ca. 1350-1500). Some sessions will be spent working with original medieval manuscripts from McGill’s Rare Books and Special Collections, as well as the Osler Library of the History of Medicine. Most texts will be read in the original Middle English. Prior experience with Middle English is not mandatory or expected, and regular practice with the language will be included in many seminar sessions.

Description:  This course will approach the form of autobiography in the Enlightenment through a brief survey of the European tradition of autobiographical texts from antiquity to the Renaissance. Classic models such as Plato’s Apology, Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations, and Saint Augustine’s Confessions will help us appreciate the motivation and methods of later writing in autobiographical form. Our readings will include not only “real” autobiographies but also first-person narratives in philosophy and literature that provide a background for understanding the emergence of the novel in the “long” eighteenth century (1650-1850). A basic assumption of this course is that the modern novel absorbs and adapts conventions of spiritual autobiography and the presuppositions of selfhood in other forms of first-person storytelling such as dramatic monologue, letter writing, and the diary. We will analyze autobiographical narratives to develop a critical vocabulary that should enable us to conceptualize key problems in the evolving relationship between truth and fiction in the history of first-person narrative. Our study of these problems in the representation of inner experience and the sociohistorical conditions of subjectivity will focus on claims to truth or authenticity in relation to the logic of eros, confession, and self-construction. Texts: All the books below contain required reading for the course. The books will be available at The Word Bookstore (469 Milton Street, 514-845-5640).

The character of Cleopatra will come to us first and foremost from Shakespeare’s play, but we will meet her also in the poetry of Augustan Rome, in Plutarch, Chaucer, in the work of modern historians, and in a wonderful range of visual images. We will bring into our discussions recent critical work on race, gender, sexuality, and power in Shakespeare studies. The central line of our work will take us again and again back to the theatre—to Cleopatra in works by John Dryden, George Bernard Shaw, and Michel Tremblay as well as a TBD selection of more recent adaptation. You will be reading, writing, talking, and presenting about Cleopatra, but you will also sign up to do a group performance of scenes from a play on the course.

[course link engl 490] Professor Richard Jean So Winter 2025 Time TBA Description: The “Digital Humanities” is a new and growing field of research within the humanities. It brings together the humanities and sciences and it takes many different forms. The version of “DH” that we will focus on in this class is the use of computers, statistics and data to study literature and culture. In particular, the main goal is to teach students how to program in Python – a common programming language – to implement standard computational and statistical methods to analyze small and large corpora of literary and cultural texts. At the same time, students will read important critical studies and applied examples of computational criticism to reflect on the limits and affordances of what they are learning, as well as to discover (and potentially implement) useful models of literary text-mining. Readings: One week before each class, students will be emailed a “Python notebook” which will provide all of the computer code that we will be learning the following week. These “notebooks,” in aggregate, represent the de facto textbook of the course. Scholarly readings will similarly be distributed via email a full week before that reading is due for class. Data: In later weeks, I will provide sample data (small to medium sized corpora of novels, poems, and online data) to facilitate our lessons. All data will be out of copyright (i.e., texts published before 1923) or open access (i.e. Fanfiction online stories, Reddit posts) and can be freely shared. Grading: Each week, starting week 1, there will be a problem set. The problem set will be coding-based problem-solving using Python. Each problem set will be due the night before the next week’s class at midnight via email (as a Python notebook file). Evaluation: Problem set grades: average of all problem sets (90%); Class participation and discussion (10%)  [course link engl 495] / [course link engl 496] Fall 2024/Winter 2025 Prerequisites: By arrangement with individual instructor.

Our readings and discussion will refer to the European context of the evolution of this narrative form in England. We will consider the novel as responding to a network of interrelated problems – of the self and its imaginative politics – at the representational crossroads of medieval epic, courtly romance, spiritual autobiography, picaresque satire, colonialist adventure, gallant intrigue, baroque casuistry, bourgeois conduct book, sentimental love story, moral treatise, psychological realism, and mock-heroic “comic epic in prose.” As the emerging literary “form of forms,” the early modern novel vibrantly juxtaposes and interweaves all these different generic strands.

We will read and discuss examples from popular contemporary poetry and associated genres such as the sonnet sequence, the epyllion, the funeral elegy, and the pastoral. We will follow the decade’s prose as it ranges broadly from proto-novelistic romances to satirical pamphleteering, from underworld documentary to exotic travel narratives. Our literary study of the decade will also regularly cast an eye to other examples of the decade’s print culture, including contemporary news from abroad, tales of piracy on lawless seas, and accounts of witchcraft and other strange crimes.\n\nFormat: Lecture and class discussion\n\nEvaluation: midterm exam (30%); final essay (30%); final exam (30%); conference participation (10%)\n\nTexts: TBA\n\nENGL 306 - Theatre Hist: Mediev Early Mod\n\nProfessor Fiona Ritchie\n\nFall 2024\n\nTime TBA\n\nExpected Preparation: ideally students enrolled in this course will have already taken ENGL 230 Introduction to Theatre Studies\n\nDescription: This course provides an overview of dramatic forms and theatrical practice in Britain from the medieval to the early modern period (c. 1300-1642). We will move from the earliest recorded vernacular play texts to the closure of the professional theatre in 1642, encompassing medieval religious drama and the theatre of Shakespeare and his contemporaries. Rather than taking a chronological approach, we will examine early theatre in a way that highlights continuities as well as divisions between the medieval and the early modern stage. We will analyse the conditions of performance (playing spaces, actors, audience, technology, etc) as well as studying a selection of representative plays (looking at their form, function, aesthetic features, etc). Emphasis is placed on the plays as theatrical works rather than literary texts. To that end, we will pay close attention to historical documents that elucidate how these plays were originally performed and received.\n\nTexts: Janette Dillon, The Cambridge Introduction to Early English Theatre (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006); coursepack containing a selection of plays\n\nEvaluation (Tentative): participation 10%; production journal 20%; midterm assignment analysing historical documents 30%; take home final exam 40%\n\nFormat: lecture, discussion, group work\n\nENGL 308 - English Renaissance Drama 1\n\nProfessor Wes Folkerth\n\nFall 2024\n\nTime TBA\n\nDescription: In this course we will survey the impressive yield of English Renaissance drama written by writers other than William Shakespeare. We will read twelve plays from the period, about one a week, including The Spanish Tragedy (Thomas Kyd), Gallathea (John Lyly), The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus (Christopher Marlowe), Arden of Faversham (Anon), The Tragedy of Antony (Mary Sidney), The Shoemaker’s Holiday (Thomas Dekker), A Woman Killed with Kindness (Thomas Heywood), The Knight of the Burning Pestle (Francis Beaumont), Volpone (Ben Jonson), A Chaste Maid in Cheapside (Thomas Middleton), The Duchess of Malfi (John Webster), and ‘Tis Pity She’s a Whore (John Ford). We will study these plays as exemplars of swiftly-changing and varied theatrical tastes in the period. Many of these works provide purviews onto the cultural situation of early modern London that are rarely found in Shakespeare’s works.\n\nEvaluation: Midterm (25%); Final Essay, 8-10 pages (35%); Final Exam (30%); Participation (10%)\n\nTexts (available at the Word on Milton):\n\nKinney, Arthur F. and David A.

Although many critical methods can be applied to the works in this course, Poetics focuses on teaching students how to talk and write precisely about a wide range of formal and stylistic techniques in relation to literary meaning in poetry and prose fiction. All the critical methodologies you will learn in your other English courses will benefit from your knowledge of the material of ENGL 311. You will read some works in Poetics that are also required in other courses, such as ENGL 202 and 203, the Departmental Surveys of English Literature. In Poetics, we study such works not primarily in historical context, or as engagements with literary, cultural or social history, but for the techniques of literary art that they exhibit. The course instructors assume that students enrolled as English majors will already have some facility explaining what given works of literature mean; we instead focus on understanding how literature creates meaning. Discussions and assignments will therefore involve the memorization, identification, and application of concepts and terms essential to the study of literary techniques. Thus, the English Literature program requires that ENGL 311 be taken in U1 so that all Literature students will be well prepared for their other studies with a shared terminology and training in critical writing.\n\nPrerequisite or Corequisite: ENGL 202 or ENGL 200. This course is open only to English majors in the literature stream. This course is to be taken in the Fall semester of U1 or in the first Fall semester after the student’s selection of the Literature Major program.\n\nRequired Texts: (available at the McGill Bookstore)\n\nAbrams, M.H. and Geoffrey Galt Harpham.

With a focus on French-language theatre (to be read in English translation), we will trace the changing aesthetics and politics of this dynamic tradition, contextualising them in performance and social contexts, and alert to figurations of insiders and outsiders in the dramatic corpus. A secondary focus will be minority-language dramatic output and theatrical production in Quebec in the same period, with a particular emphasis on that produced in English.\n\nThis course also offers the opportunity to conduct primary-source research and analysis on under-documented, minority-language drama Quebec theatre. To this end, students will read and analyse largely unpublished plays by English-language Quebec playwrights. In addition, we will hear from theatre artists working in Montreal today in the form of guest-lectures and interviews.\n\nTexts: Coursepack of critical and secondary readings.

We will begin by studying the canonical realists of the late nineteenth century and the philosophy underlying their dramaturgy. This will lead us into a consideration of various positive and negative responses to the realist tradition. We will examine these plays in their original theatrical contexts, while at the same time positioning these dramas in relation to their individual social and political moments. We will also consider subsequent re-stagings of these plays and how they are repurposed in new contexts. The thematic rubric for the course will address generational conflicts and parent/child relationships in the various plays. The overall goal of the course is to impart to students a foundational understanding of the dominant trend in modern drama in the west.\n\nFormat: Lectures and conferences\n\nEvaluation (tentative): First essay (5 pages): 25%; Class Attendance / Participation: 10%; Major Essay (6 pages): 30%; Final Exam: 35%\n\nPlease Note: In the event of extraordinary circumstances beyond the University’s control, the content and/or evaluation scheme in this course is subject to change.\n\nRequired Texts (Tentative):\n\nIbsen, Henrik.

We will begin with a number of very early plays, including The Two Gentlemen of Verona, The Comedy of Errors, Titus Andronicus, and Love’s Labor’s Lost. Before the midterm we will also read one of Shakespeare’s popular narrative poems, “Venus and Adonis.” After the midterm we will focus on three plays – Richard II, Romeo and Juliet, and A Midsummer Night’s Dream (world classics of history, tragedy, and comedy) – which he wrote all within the space of about a single year. The Merchant of Venice, and Henry the Fourth, Part One round out the decade of the 1590s, and our course. The plan is to cover approximately one play per two weeks. Are you Shakespearienced? After this course you will be. The pace will be fast, with a view to giving students in the English major and minor programs a fuller appreciation of the scope of Shakespeare’s accomplishment in the first half of his career.\n\nFormat: Lecture and conference sections\n\nEvaluation: midterm exam (30%); final essay (30%); final exam (30%); conference participation (10%)\n\nTexts:\n\nThe Norton Shakespeare Volume I: Early Plays and Poems. 3rd edition.

Previous university courses in English literature, especially ENGL 202; some knowledge of Renaissance literature or culture is desirable.\n\nDescription: A study of the poetry and selected prose of one of England’s most important, influential, and still controversial writers. While to many people today Milton seems the epitome of literary and political orthodoxy, in his own time he was known as a radical thinker, an advocate of regicide and divorce. His writing is complex and challenging, demanding careful and active engagement from his readers. In the first few weeks of the term, we will look at Milton’s early poetry and some of his political writings, tracing his development as a poet in relation to his social, political, and literary context. The centre of the course will focus on a close reading of Paradise Lost. In conclusion, we will look briefly at his last works, Paradise Regain’d and Samson Agonistes, and discuss Milton’s later reputation and his place in the Western literary tradition.\n\nFormat: Lecture and discussion\n\nEvaluation: 25% in class mid-term; 40% 10 pp. term paper on Paradise Lost; 25% take-home exam; 10% class participation.\n\nTexts (required texts are available at McGill Bookstore):\n\nStella Revard ed, John Milton: Complete Shorter Poems (Wiley-Blackwell, 2009)\n\nBarbara Lewalski, ed.

These include three plays by Shakespeare, readings from the two influential “confessions” of St. Augustine and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and two novels—Passing by Nella Larson and Fake Accounts by Lauren Oyler. Our literary reading will be supplemented by the work of a number of important thinkers, including Hannah Arendt, Jürgen Habermas, Michael Warner, and Alice Marwick and danah boyd.\n\nThe course is about the history of the ideas, practices, spaces, and technologies that have created the shifting zones of private and public life. We’ll move toward a deeper understanding of how our world has been shaped by the history of privacy and publicity (i.e., the condition of being public).\n\nWe will make use of ChatGPT and/or similar AI systems in the course.\n\nTexts: Texts will be available from Paragraph Books.

As a basis for understanding and evaluating the role of “socio-historical approaches” in literary and cultural studies, we will contextualize the debate between formalism and historicism in the opposition between Kant’s philosophy and the alternative of dialectical thinking in Hegel, hermeneutics, and Marx. Our readings will reflect the far-reaching impact of this ideological opposition as a pattern of methodological assumptions and institutional practices. We will also review the formal and historical claim that one literary genre in particular – the novel – embodies or expresses the characteristic philosophical problems of modernity. Note: This course is not open to students who took ENGL 317 with Prof. Hensley.\n\nTexts: Most of the books for this course will be available at The Word Bookstore (469 Milton Street, 514-845-5640). The textbooks listed below will be among those required. (Please note that Pluhar's translation of Kant is the only acceptable edition!

Topics to be covered include the New Formalism, Post-critical Reading, Afropessimism, Environmental Humanities, Digital Humanities, and other important new approaches in the discipline.\n\nWorkflow: Each week we’ll read one or two major works of criticism/theory, as well as one brief “cultural artifact” to ground our discussion of each week’s readings. Class will be split into two discussion halves, mapping on to the two class meetings each week. In the first, we’ll discuss the theoretical material; in the second we’ll “apply” the theoretical concepts to a specific text.\n\nReadings: All readings will be posted to MyCourses as pdf files one week before they are due. You don’t have to purchase any books or texts on your own, only unless you want to. Some examples include: Forms by Levine; Slow Violence by Nixon; Distant Horizons by Underwood; In the Wake by Sharpe; etc.\n\nEvaluation: Do all the reading, come to class, write the final paper, and participate. Attendance: 10%; Participation: 30%; Final Paper: 60%\n\nENGL 320 - Postcolonial Literature\n\nInstructor: Dr. Aaron Bartels-Swindells\n\nFall 2024\n\nTime TBA\n\nExpected Preparation: This course is intended for English majors and minors, as it assumes a basic grounding in the methods of literary studies. However, there are no prerequisites for this course, and it will be broadly useful to students interested in both histories of the novel and the history and fiction of South Africa during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.\n\nDescription: How do literary texts respond to oppressive political contexts? How, for example, can fiction describe or affect a society fractured by racial segregation? This class will answer those questions by surveying efforts by twentieth-century South African writers working during the era of apartheid (1948-1994). We will then look at literature of the post-apartheid period (1994-present), when hopes of a “rainbow nation” burst into life but then quickly faded amid growing inequality and political scandal. Throughout the semester, we will ask what effects these massive societal changes have had on South African fiction, and what effects—if any—writers of conscience had on the transformation of a racially unjust society. While plotting this trajectory, we will also reflect on how South African fiction challenges metropolitan histories and theories of the novel. The course will thus explore how South African writers have reconfigured foundational aesthetic categories like realism and modernism and associated social categories like time, subjectivity, and desire in their efforts to represent life under racial capitalism. Students will leave the course with a) a core understanding of the literary history of South Africa; b) a grasp of the history and theory of the novel and its applicability to fiction of the global South; and c) a broad set of critical terms (e.g., realism and modernism) useful for the study of modern fiction generally.\n\nRequired texts may include:\n\nSol T. Plaatje, Native Life in South Africa (1916)\n\nEs’kia Mphahlele, Down Second Avenue (1959)\n\nNadine Gordimer, The Conservationist (1974)\n\nJ.M.

Eliot suggests, enigmatically, in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” (1919), the essay whose ideas of criticism and creative process exerted major influence on the early twentieth-century modernist moment and beyond. By “criticism,” Eliot means literary criticism and beyond—cultural commentary and critique, designed to register readers’ thoughts and feelings; guide attention; focus thought; identify literary and cultural questions; and respond to and evaluate the texts and ideas of a culture, often toward developing visions for the future.\n\nEliot’s essay, and the thinking about the activity of “criticism” it represents, reads as the early twentieth-century’s answer to Matthew Arnold’s challenge of the mid-nineteenth century: Arnold’s “The Function of Criticism at the Present Time” paved the way for a late nineteenth- and early twentieth century preoccupation with the work of criticism – what role does the commentary associated with criticism, and the figure of the cultural critic, play in the making of culture? How can the critic support what F.R. Leavis and Denys Thompson called the development of “critical awareness,” with respect to the texts of a culture? The critic is alternately imagined in the work of this period (sometimes called the “Age of Criticism”) as “sage,” respondent, watchdog, spur, cynic, Virgilian guide, curator, judge, jester, and rhapsode.\n\nContemporary cultural historian John Guillory, in Professing Criticism (2022), recognizes the importance that the practice of criticism has held for the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, and acknowledges that in the field of English, when people teach “literature,” in fact they are often teaching criticism. Taking a cue from Guillory and theorists such as Terry Eagleton - whose The Critical Revolutionaries (2022) will provide points of departure - this course traces a genealogy of criticism as we have inherited the concept, focusing especially on examples from the eighteenth-, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries that have shaped our contemporary conception of what criticism entails and does.\n\nTexts: Early readings include essays by Coleridge, Carlyle, and Arnold; the late Victorian aesthetic criticism of Walter Pater, Henry James, and Oscar Wilde; and twentieth-century work by a range of twentieth-century critics invested in the challenge of reimagining “criticism” for the needs of a modern era – such as Eliot, I.A. Richards, Q.D. and F.R. Leavis, Lionel Trilling, and Northrop Frye. We close by considering a range of later and recent work from critics committed to the “work of the critic” such as Susan Sontag, Toni Morrison, Merve Emre, and Zadie Smith.\n\nFormat: Lecture and Discussion\n\nEvaluation: 3 brief critical essays and projects (15% each); longer critical essay (20%); final examination (25%), participation (10%)\n\nENGL 326 - 19th Century American Prose\n\nFiction After the Civil War: Regionalism, Urbanism, Internationalism\n\nProfessor Peter Gibian\n\nWinter 2025\n\nTime TBA\n\nExpected Student Preparation: Previous university-level course work in American Literature, preferably before 1900, or permission of instructor.\n\nDescription: A mid-level survey of later-19th-century prose fiction forms representing a wide range of literary movements and modes. The course will be organized to trace ever-widening geographical, literary, and cultural horizons. A first unit will explore “regionalist” or “local color” writings (by authors such as Irving, Harris, Harte, Twain, Chopin, Jewett, Cable, Chestnutt, and Alcott) rooted in the specificity of a unique geographical place that is seen to define a unique cultural or psychological identity. The second course unit will survey classic writerly responses to the late-19th-century city—seen (in authors such as Chopin, Alcott, Dreiser, James, and Wharton) as a new sort of humanly-constructed, hybrid environment or economy in which diverse strangers from a variety of homes and backgrounds are brought together to work out forms of coexistence. The final unit will then follow another group of turn-of-the-century writers as they expand American horizons even further, reflecting the nation’s move into the international arena with new fictional treatments of the International Theme. Authors such as James and Wharton ground their writing in the ever-shifting experience of cross-cultural travel and meditate anxiously on the situation of the writer as “cosmopolite”--perfectly placed (or dis-placed) to explore the problems and possibilities of inter-national interchange in a modern, globalizing world.\n\nTexts (Tentative; editions TBA): To be selected from authors noted in the description above. Readings will include not only short stories but also several longer novels; the amount of assigned reading will be fairly substantial—especially at the end of the semester.\n\nA collection of short stories—available in pdf on myCourses.\n\nAlcott, Little Women;\n\nDreiser, Sister Carrie;\n\nWharton, The Age of Innocence;\n\nLevine, ed., The Norton Anthology of American Literature (10th ed., Vol. C).\n\nEvaluation: (Tentative): 25% mid-term exam; 25% term paper; 10% class attendance and participation; 40% formal final exam. (NB: All forms of evaluation in this course—on exams as well as essays—test abilities in literary-critical writing and analysis; there will be no short-answer or multiple-choice exams graded by computer.)\n\nFormat: Lectures and discussions.\n\nENGL 329 - English Novel:19th Century 1\n\nReading the Multiplot Novel in the Age of AI\n\nProfessor Yael Halevi-Wise\n\nFall 2024\n\nM/W 14:30-16:00\n\nDescription: This course will make use of Open AI tools to explore the role of minor characters in multiplot English novels written in the first half of the 19th Century. By focusing on minor characters, we will acquire a better understanding of the architectonics of complex literary creations. As a new experiment in literary analysis we will also investigate whether AI tools are presently capable of achieving an accurate and deep assessment of literary artworks created by sophisticated human imaginations addressed to sophisticated readers. Minor characters may seem to play a superfluous role in the plot of a novel, but their presence offsets a narrative’s main concerns and outlines its architectonic composition. On a parallel track we will inquire whether the present generation of AI tools are minor and superfluous for literary analysis or can they sharpen literary analysis by offering refreshing modes of research, brainstorming and essay composition.\n\nNote: This course requires fast paced reading of long and complicated novels. Shortcuts will not work because the assignments build on a comparison between traditional reading and various types of shortcuts.\n\nTexts:\n\nAvailable at Paragraph Bookstore corner Sherbrooke/McGill College\n\nEmma (1815) by Jane Austen\n\nJane Fairfax (1990) by Joan Aiken\n\nWuthering Heights (1847) by Emily Brontë\n\nBarnaby Rudge (1841) by Charles Dickens\n\nTancred (1847) by Benjamin Disraeli\n\nEvaluation: 10% discussion and workshop participation; 10% attendance; 10% x4 short essays; 10% x4 revisions of essays using AI tools.\n\nFormat: Lecture, workshops, discussion\n\nENGL 331 - Literature Romantic Period 1\n\nLove and Global Romanticism\n\nProfessor Carmen Mathes\n\nFall 2024\n\nTime TBA\n\nDescription: Romanticism is a philosophical and literary movement; the Romantic era is an eighteenth- and nineteenth-century historical period. The meanings, scope and timelines associated with both these statements have been oft debated and contested, particularly when it comes to Romantic-era Britain’s global reach.\n\nThis course situates British Romanticism in a global context, and it does so by thinking about love. At a time of imperial and colonial expansion, how did Romantic novelists and poets think about the potentials and pitfalls of love? What kinds of connections—or animosities, or fantasies, or projections—might love bring to the surface or, alternatively, stifle, reject, or repress? We will read three novels (by Jane Austen, Mary Shelley and an anonymous author) and many poems by writers including Phillis Wheatley Peters, William Blake, Charlotte Smith, William Wordsworth, Mary Robinson, John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron.\n\nTexts:\n\nThe Broadview Anthology of Romantic Literature, edited by Joseph Black et al., Broadview, 2016, ISBN: 9781554811311\n\nJane Austen, Mansfield Park (1814), edited by Claudia L.

Tolkien’s Old English Chronicles\n\nDr. Antje Chan\n\nWinter 2025\n\nTime TBA\n\nPrerequisite: None\n\nDescription: This course explores the significance of Old English for the history of the English language and its literature. Britain before the Norman Conquest produced a language and literature marked by invention and innovation, unravelling moments of change and migration. Around 650, Britain and Ireland comprised early English dialects such as Irish, Welsh, Pictish, Old Norse, and Latin. Languages and cultures throughout the two islands mingled and clashed amidst competing kingdoms. From Germanic peoples before 600s, to Viking and Danish raiders, rulers, and settlers, as well as a community of Jews, Britain was shaped by movements of migration and change. Questions of identity and belonging were at the forefront of the literature.\n\nBy developing skills for translation, literary, cultural and historical enquiry, this course looks at a wide range of literary forms, such as lyrics, riddles, epic narrative, hagiographies and chronicles in order to enrich our understanding of the first 600 years of the English language.\n\nTexts (provisional):\n\nThe Dream of the Rood\n\nThe Battle of Maldon\n\nThe Wanderer\n\nThe Wife’s Lament\n\nBeowulf\n\nJudith\n\nÆlfric’s Life of St Edmund\n\nBede’s account of the poet Cædmon\n\nOld English Riddles from the Exeter Book\n\nSaint Æthelthryth (from Ælfric’s Lives of Saints)\n\nSaint Eugenia (from the Old English Martyrology)\n\nJ. R. R. Tolkien, The Annals of Valinor (selection)\n\nEvaluation (provisional): participation 10%; translation portfolio 20%; midterm assessment 20%; final assessment 50%\n\nFormat: Lectures and discussions\n\nENGL 333 - Dvlpmnt of Canadian Poetry 2\n\nProfessor Robert Lecker\n\nWinter 2025\n\nTime TBA\n\n(Note: For English Majors, this course qualifies for the required three credits from a course in Canadian literature)\n\nDescription: This is a course about really reading poetry, in this case, Canadian poetry. It focuses on a group of approximately ten Canadian poets who have formed and responded to the Canadian literary landscape since World War II. Most of the poets covered in the course are writers who confront modern and contemporary ideas about the nature of self, society, sexuality, gender, and art, but we also look at the ways in which these writers are trying to deal with the existential implications of new views about science, religion, and the poet’s place in a rapidly changing world. Since part of the reading involves thinking about aesthetic and theoretical issues, the course will deal with these issues, just as it will pay close attention to the meaning and resonance of particular poems. At the same time, it will consider the ways in which these poets (and us, as readers) construct the place called Canada as a metaphor that’s central to our daily lives. Students are encouraged to explore multi-media material related to each poet in question. The writing component of the course (a series of short assignments and a final paper) is designed to improve interpretive abilities and writing skills; the course encourages personal forms of critical expression. For this reason, this course will appeal to students who wish to broaden their understanding of poetry in general and will provide new ways of thinking about how poetry works. Students enrolling in this course should be prepared to participate actively in class discussion.\n\nTexts: TBD.\n\nEvaluation: A series of short assignments (50%); final paper (25%); attendance (10%); participation (15%).\n\nFormat: Lecture and discussion.\n\nENGL 335 - The 20th Century Novel 1\n\nPostwar British Novel\n\nProfessor Allan Hepburn\n\nFall 2024\n\nT/Th 4-5:30\n\nDescription: This course will focus on British fiction written between the Second World War and the end of the twentieth century. This survey of selected novels will focus on class, the Welfare State, responses to the war, housing, planning, conceptions of the future, the status of children and refugees, evil, women, gender, the decline of imperialism, sexuality, and fictional technique. Generic conventions of comedy and tragedy as they mix with novelistic representation will inform lectures, as will distinctions between mass-market and highbrow fiction.\n\nTexts:\n\nIvy Compton-Burnett, Manservant and Maidservant\n\nGraham Greene, The End of the Affair\n\nAlan Sillitoe, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning\n\nMuriel Spark, Memento Mori\n\nJohn le Carré, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\n\nBarbara Pym, Quartet in Autumn\n\nPrerequisite: students should have 2 or 3 prior courses in English literature, preferably survey and poetics\n\nFormat: lecture and discussion\n\nEvaluation: essays, attendance, participation, final exam\n\nENGL 345 - Literature and Society\n\nLiterary Institutions\n\nProfessor Alexander Manshel\n\nFall 2024\n\nTime TBA\n\nDescription: This course will introduce students to a range of thinkers invested in how literary texts come to be. Rather than focus on the individual talent or overarching historical forces, we will take up what James English has called the “middle zone of cultural space.” This is the zone of agents, publishers, translators, booksellers, prize committees, university English departments, creative writing programs, canon warriors, Goodreads, Amazon, and Oprah. Pairing critical readings with novels and short fiction, we will investigate the central institutions, figures, and forces that mediate contemporary literary production and reception. Who are the “unacknowledged legislators” of the literary field, and how do they come between writer and reader to shape what each can and should do? What forces influence our conceptions of aesthetic value, and how is literary prestige measured and doled out? How do literary texts circulate within a culture, and how have they travelled across national and linguistic boundaries? In all, students in this course will encounter a variety of critical and artistic texts that do not rely on the concept of “literariness,” but rather investigate how such a thing is produced in the first place.\n\nTexts: Percival Everett, Erasure (2001); Clayton Childress, Under the Cover: The Creation, Production, and Reception of a Novel (2017); R.F. Kuang, Yellowface (2023); Various readings available on myCourses.\n\nEvaluation: Lecture Attendance and Discussion Participation (10%); Paper #1, 4-5 pp. (20%) and Paper #2, 4-5 pp. (20%) [OR, with permission: Final Paper, 8-10 pp. (40%)]; Midterm Exam (20%); Final Exam (30%).\n\nENGL 347 - Great Writings of Europe 1\n\nVirgil and Ovid\n\nProfessor Maggie Kilgour\n\nWinter 2025\n\nTime TBA\n\nPrerequisite: None.\n\nExpected Student Preparation: Previous university courses in English or classical literature. A basic knowledge of Homeric epic will be assumed in lectures. Students therefore should read the Iliad and the Odyssey before taking this course. Previous work on poetry is also strongly advised.\n\nDescription: This course will focus on the writings of Virgil and Ovid, their relationship to the Augustan period, and their enormous influence on later Western literature. The two Roman poets seem to present contrasting models for the poet’s relation to society broadly and to political power specifically. For Virgil, poetry appears to be a means of binding society together; for Ovid, it is a means of taking it apart critically. While we will spend most time looking at their epics, The Aeneid and Metamorphoses, we will also study the development of both authors through their different works, and discuss the significance of their decisions to explore the specific genres of pastoral, georgic, elegy, and epic. The writers’ antithetical career paths leading to distinct epic visions offer alternative images for later writers of what it means to be a poet. By looking at the two writers together, however, we will also consider the complex intertextual dynamics between their two positions, noting especially how Ovid intensifies as well as rewrites Virgil’s exploration of desire, exile and alienation, and of the function of poetry itself.\n\nFormat: Lecture and discussion\n\nEvaluation: In class mid-term, 20%; 10 pp. term paper, 40%; final exam, 30%; class participation, 10%.\n\nTexts: (required texts are available at the McGill Bookstore):\n\nVirgil, Eclogues (Penguin); Georgics (Penguin); Aeneid (Vintage)\n\nOvid, The Erotic Poems (Penguin); Heroides (selections); Metamorphoses (edition TBA)\n\nAugustus, Res Gestae, and other secondary materials will be posted on MyCourses\n\nAverage enrolment: 30 students\n\nENGL 348 - Great Writings of Europe 2\n\nArthurian Origins\n\nProfessor Michael Van Dussen\n\nFall 2024\n\nTime TBA\n\nPrerequisites: None\n\nNote: Students who have taken ENGL 348 under a different course topic are free to take this version of the course. Although the course number is the same, the content is entirely different; therefore, these will count as two different courses toward university and program requirements. For English Literature majors, this course counts toward the “backgrounds” requirement.\n\nDescription: The Arthurian legends grew to become an extremely rich and diverse body of literature by the later Middle Ages, and the idea of Arthur continues to fascinate today. Having emerged in the fifth and sixth centuries, tales about King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table have since spread across six continents and dozens of languages. They have inspired fictional stories, blockbuster movies, and historical study internationally. Further, they touch upon many fields of study including literature, history, and archaeology. Our goal in this course is to examine this phenomenon as it developed in the medieval period (to ca. 1500) and explore some of the reasons why the Arthurian legends have become so integral to multi-cultural and interdisciplinary pursuits.\n\nOver the course of the semester, we will engage the Arthurian legends by investigating how their central themes, figures, and literary situations change across different linguistic and cultural traditions and periods, as well as how they became central to Welsh, English, and French identities. Where is the line between fact and fiction in Arthurian legends? What constitutes an Arthurian legend? Why do the legends occupy such an important place in the literary and cultural imaginations of medieval writers and readers? How and why are medieval notions of “courtly love” and “chivalry,” as exhibited in the Arthurian legends, important to readers in later social and historical contexts? How are Arthurian stories rewritten or adapted by various authors, and how do these different texts represent the concerns or preoccupations of different historical moments?\n\nWe will read most texts in modern English translation, though some will be read in the original Middle English. Prior experience with Middle English is not mandatory or expected, and regular practice with the language will be included in many class sessions.\n\nTexts (Provisional):\n\nThe Mabinogion (selections)\n\nGeoffrey of Monmouth, History of the Kings of Britain (selections)\n\nGildas, On the Ruin of Britain (selections)\n\nPs-Nennius, History of the Britons (selections)\n\nChrétien de Troyes, Arthurian Romances (selections)\n\nRobert de Boron, Joseph of Arimathea; Merlin; Percival\n\nThe Quest of the Holy Grail\n\nMarie de France, Lais\n\nSir Gawain and the Green Knight\n\nThe Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle\n\nContextual readings and short romances from other traditions\n\nEvaluation (provisional): Final assessment: 40%; Short analytical essays: 50%; Participation and attendance: 10%\n\nFormat: Lectures and discussions\n\nENGL 354 - Sexuality and Representation\n\nQueer Screens/Queer Scenes: Risk, Resistance and Revolution\n\nProfessor Alanna Thain\n\nFall 2024\n\nT/TH 16:00-17:30\n\nDescription: \"Queer Screens/ Queer Scenes\" looks at the world making practices of queer media through risk, revolution and resistance. This class is largely focused on film and video, but with consideration of television, digital media, installation and performance, with works drawn from LGBTQ2IA+ perspectives. We will explore topics such as the links between sexualities and representation, subversive and clandestine portrayals of queer sexualities, the emergence of gay and lesbian cinema in the 1970s alongside civil rights movements, the ongoing HIV/ AIDS epidemic and the media, the New Queer cinema of the 1990s, experimental film and video, pornography, , activist documentary, queer aesthetics and the social, political and cultural contexts of production, exhibition and reception. What is queer cinema today and how it is in dialogue with historical and contemporary conditions of production, reception and analysis alongside the changing status of the idea of “queer”? Screenings will include films from multiple world cinema contexts, and will include features, documentaries and experimental/ underground cinema. We will also engage and attend Montreal based festivals, production and queer media communities to consider how cultural conditions of reception and circulation also produce and sustain queer media.\n\nTexts: Films will include numerous short form media, as well as feature films. Attendance at class screenings is mandatory.\n\nEvaluation: TBD.\n\nFormat: Lecture, screenings, discussion and participation.\n\nENGL 355 - The Poetics of Performance\n\nProfessor Sean Carney\n\nFall 2024\n\nM/W 13:05-14:25\n\nLeacock 212\n\nPre- or Co-requisite: ENGL 230\n\nLimited to students in the English Major Concentration, Drama and Theatre Option\n\nCourse Description:\n\nThis course examines how meaning and significance emerge in theatrical art. Beginning from the assumption that theatre, like all art, is a form of communication, our study examines the qualities unique to theatrical communication in all its forms. The course is a combination of practical analysis of play scripts and theatre, and consideration of theoretical texts.\n\nCommencing with Aristotle, we interrogate the premises of his Poetics and the marginalization of opsis (spectacle) in his study.\n\nThe rest of the course is composed of a series of units: our first unit examines theatrical communication with an emphasis on the dramatic text and how the text may be broken down into minimal communicative units of action.\n\nOur second unit moves from the practical study of a script to the analysis of live theatre with an emphasis on how meaning emerges in the spectable. We will consider both theoretical ideas about theatrical signs and theatre semiotics, and also practical tools for analyzing theatre.\n\nOur third unit examines the function of the actor on stage and how the actor’s performance creates meaning and significance in theatrical communication. We also consider the dynamic relationship between humans and objects in the theatre, such as puppets or stage props, and what these elements tell us about the experience of theatre as a whole.\n\nFinally, our fourth unit opens us to broader questions about communication in the theatre: the implications of theatre as storytelling, the importance of the spectator’s experience of the theatre as the locus of meaning, and the function of stage and theatre spaces in theatre art. As a case study we will consider the contemporary example of Verbatim theatre. The overall goal of the course is to give you a foundational understanding of key theories of the poetics of performance, so that you may build upon this knowledge through your later studies as Theatre and Drama majors.\n\nInstructional Method: Lecture and class discussion\n\nEvaluation: TBA\n\nTexts (Critical Readings and Plays): TBA\n\nENGL 356 - Middle English\n\nFifteenth-Century Literature and Culture\n\nProfessor Michael Van Dussen\n\nWinter 2025\n\nTime TBA\n\nPrerequisites: none\n\nNote: For English Literature majors, this course counts toward the “Middle English” requirement.\n\nDescription: The fifteenth century in England was a dynamic time when concepts of authorship, communication, textual production, and literacy were undergoing tremendous change. English was developing quickly as England’s official language—something that hadn’t been the case for centuries, following the Norman Conquest—now overtaking French and Latin. Heresy and its suppression met with a burgeoning humanist movement, and mainstream religious practice was vibrant and varied. In the second half of the fifteenth century, the medieval invention of printing with movable type coexisted with a lively manuscript culture in England.\n\nThis course situates fifteenth-century English literature in its dynamic cultural contexts, examining how late-medieval literature in England intersected with developments in politics, popular culture, literacy, religious controversy, technology, and gender relations. Readings will range from a devout woman’s defiant memoir to a bureaucrat’s struggle with anonymity; from a legalistic dream vision to romantic treatments of the outlaw Robin Hood. We’ll analyze the explosion of fifteenth-century dramatic production and culminate with Thomas Malory’s sophisticated re-imagining of Arthurian romance traditions during the Wars of the Roses. Students will also get to see original medieval manuscripts and early printed texts during workshops with items from McGill’s Rare Books and Special Collections.\n\nAll primary texts will be read in the original Middle English, though no previous knowledge of the language is required. Portions of several classes will be spent developing proficiency in Middle English.\n\nTexts (Provisional):\n\nThomas Hoccleve, My Compleinte and Other Poems\n\nJohn Lydgate, The Temple of Glass\n\nThomas Malory, Le Morte D’Arthur\n\nThe Book of Margery Kempe\n\nRobin Hood and Other Outlaw Tales\n\nSelections from collections of medieval drama\n\nEvaluation (provisional): Final assessment, 30% ; Close reading exercises, 10%; Analytical essays, 40%; Rare Books response, 5%; In-class translation, 5%; Participation and attendance, 10%\n\nFormat: Lectures and discussions\n\nENGL 357 - Chaucer\n\nTroilus and Criseyde\n\nDr. Antje Chan\n\nFall 2024\n\nTime TBA\n\nPrerequisites: None\n\nNote: We will read Chaucer in the original Middle English, however no previous knowledge of the language is required. Time in class will be spent developing proficiency in Middle English.\n\nDescription: At the beginning of Geoffrey Chaucer’s life (1340s), Europe was undergoing a period of social change in the wake of the Black Death. Global trade networks across the continent and beyond the Mediterranean facilitated cultural exchanges more than ever before. The literature produced and circulated in Chaucer’s lifetime was profoundly marked by an exchange of ideas rooted in classical, Italian, French and Middle Eastern sources. This admixture of ideas manifested in multilingual manuscripts, engaged with international political, religious, and cultural concerns. As the son of a wine merchant, and a man involved in the English wool trade, Chaucer was deeply shaped by the exchange of things and ideas between England and the continent. It is in such setting that Chaucer’s Troilus and Criseyde was written.\n\nThis course will delve deeply into Troilus and Criseyde, which was considered for centuries after Chaucer’s death his masterpiece. While the poem tells the story of Troilus’ twin sorrows: his lovesickness and his despair both caused by his love for Criseyde, we will explore this poem of unusual psychological depth by considering questions such as how do we live; how porous is the nature of identity; the equivocacy of privacy/secrecy; notions of causality; as well as literary questions such as what does it mean to write fiction; how does one achieve literary authority; and what are the conventions of the art of love and of writings about love?\n\nTexts (provisional):\n\nGeoffrey Chaucer, Troilus and Criseyde (Norton or Riverside)\n\nBoccacio, Il Filostrato\n\nRobert Henryson, The Testament of Cresseid\n\nBoethius, The Consolation of Philosophy\n\nBoccacio, The Decameron (selections)\n\nEvaluation (provisional): participation and attendance 10%; short essays 20%; term paper 40%; final assessment 30%\n\nFormat: Lectures and discussions\n\nENGL 359 - The Poetics of the Image\n\nProfessor Ara Osterweil\n\nWinter 2025\n\nClass Meeting: T/Th 11:30-13:00\n\nMandatory Screening: M 18:00-20:30\n\nExpected Preparation: This course is intended for students in the Cultural Studies stream. It is a required course for Cultural Studies majors, and should be ideally taken in the term after the student has taken Introduction to Film Studies and Introduction to Cultural Studies, although this timeline is not required. This course can also potentially count towards the World Cinema minor, provided that the student has not taken too many other courses in the English department.\n\nDescription: This course is designed to teach students how to meaningfully close read image-based cultural texts. Using multiple strategies of visual analysis, students will learn how to perform perceptive, informed, and medium-specific interpretations of both still and moving images. Focusing our critical lens on some of the most innovative photography and film texts of the last century, we will study the nuances of composition, color, mise-en-scène, framing, camera movement, editing and sound. Paying close attention to the ways in which visual style creates meaning, students will learn to look beyond narrative and dialogue in order to understand both the semiotics and poetics of the image. In addition to numerous close-reading exercises, we will be supplementing our investigation of images with several classical texts by theorists such as John Berger, Roland Barthes, André Bazin, Sergei Eisenstein, Christina Sharpe, Jacques Lacan, Sigmund Freud, Kaja Silverman, Stan Brakhage, Laura Marks, and Maya Deren. Students must come to class having completed all of the assigned reading and will be expected to participate verbally in class on a weekly basis.\n\nLectures will be illustrated by copious examples. In addition to lectures, there is a mandatory screening every week as well as several discussion sessions led by a Teaching Assistant throughout the semester.\n\nFormat: Two lecture/ discussions per week, one mandatory screening per week, and occasional writing workshops led in additional conference time with the Teaching Assistant.\n\nEvaluation: Participation (10%); Attendance (10%); 2-page diagnostic essay (20 %); 4-5 page Sequence Analysis (25%): 4-5 page Sequence Analysis (25%)\n\nArt and films by:\n\nAndy Warhol\n\nCindy Sherman\n\nDorothea Lange\n\nHollis Frampton\n\nChris Marker\n\nPaul Mpagi Sepuya\n\nJean-Luc Godard\n\nSergei Eisenstein\n\nIngmar Bergman\n\nCarl Theodor Dreyer\n\nMaya Deren\n\nStan Brakhage\n\nYoko Ono\n\nRequired Texts:\n\nJohn Berger, Ways of Seeing\n\nRoland Barthes, Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography\n\nAdditional Essays available on MyCourses.\n\nENGL 360 - Literary Criticism\n\nProfessor Sandeep Banerjee\n\nWinter 2025\n\nTime TBA\n\nDescription: This course will explore several topics that are central to modern and contemporary literary criticism and critical theory. These include, but are not limited to, representation, narrative, interpretation, ideology, signification, discourse as well as categories of difference such as class, race, gender, and sexuality. We will read excerpts from key texts from a range of critical thinkers, schools and practices to interrogate and engage with some of the fundamental that have animated literary studies: What constitutes literature? Who determines what texts mean, and how? How do texts relate to broader social structures? Considering these questions will necessitate careful and patient engagement with critical texts that will on occasion be dense and difficult.\n\nNote: This is a required course for students of the Literature Honors stream. All other students should contact me for permission to register.\n\nTexts:\n\nTerry Eagleton – Literary Theory: An Introduction\n\nReadings from works by specific theorists will be provided.\n\nEvaluation: Take home exams and papers.\n\nFormat: Lectures and discussion.\n\nENGL 363 - Studies in the Hist of Film 3\n\nAmerican Film of the 1960s\n\nProfessor Ara Osterweil\n\nFall 2024\n\nClass Meetings: M/W 16:00-17:30\n\nMandatory Screening: M 18:00-20:30\n\nPrerequisites: None.\n\nExpected Student Preparation: Familiarity with concepts and terminology from film studies and cultural studies will be useful. Background in history is also helpful but not required.\n\nDescription: This course examines the development of cinema during the most radical decade of political resistance and artistic innovation in American history. Juxtaposing an analysis of mainstream films alongside the study of experimental and independent cinema, this course situates the revolution in cinematic form and content in the larger context of the social and political transformations of the 1960s. By putting Hollywood into dialogue with its alternatives, this course examines how cinema of this period approached complex issues such as: the decline of the Hollywood studio system and the Production Code Administration, the escalating Cold War, political paranoia and assassination, the student protest movement, racial politics and the struggle for civil rights, the sexual revolution, the emergence of gay rights, the Vietnam war, the legacy of earlier progressive movements such as the Popular Front, hippie culture, and the increasing role of the media, or what theorist Guy Debord termed “the society of the spectacle.” We will study some of the most important films of the decade, including works by Hollywood directors such as John Huston, Robert Aldrich, John Schlesinger, Stanley Kubrick, and Arthur Penn, independent mavericks such as John Cassavetes, Michael Roemer, and George Romero, as well as experimental filmmakers such as Andy Warhol, Kenneth Anger, Carolee Schneemann, and Stan Brakhage. Attendance at weekly screenings is mandatory; readings are copious.\n\nFormat: Lecture, discussion, mandatory weekly screenings\n\nEvaluation: Class Participation (10%); Attendance (10%); Midterm Exam (20%); Final Exam (30%); Final Paper (30%)\n\nRequired Films:\n\nShadows (John Cassavetes, 1960)\n\nThe Misfits (John Huston, 1960)\n\nWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

Weekly design modules focus on tools such as script analysis, colour palette, developing a design concept, transformation of characters, design stylization - all focused on the creation of original costume designs.\n\nThe concepts covered in class will be practiced by students in weekly skill building exercises, culminating in individual final projects. The main communication tool is sketching, using each student’s medium of choice, such as water colour paints, design markers, coloured pencils, or digital tools. It is not critical to be proficient at sketching – it is more important to have creative ideas and the motivation to communicate visually, but also verbally, and in written form.\n\nThe various homework exercises and projects will take a steady amount of time throughout the semester and will culminate in a final project.\n\nEvaluation:\n\nWeekly at-home exercises. The details given here are examples only. Content may vary.\n\nDesign Concepts, Colour Palette, Developing Base Costumes, Stylized Period, Future & Fantasy, Innovative sourcing for period costumes.\n\nParticipation – attendance, participating in discussions, contributing ideas, participation in workshops – 10%\n\nFinal project – Independent costume design which integrates all learning modules into one final creative endeavour.

It will unfold in three units. The first and last units involve the question of the monster and the sheltering, threatening, atmospheric spaces it approaches or inhabits. Sandwiched between those considerations will be a central unit on horror feelings, which we will attempt to complicate. No longer will we be content to judge simply whether a horror film is “scary;” instead, we will explore the genre’s production of a broad palette of feeling, including key neighbours of fear such as disgust, anger, and shame. Indeed, even fear itself might be usefully divided into slow dread and fast panic (which is one reason why the speed of zombies matters). It is ultimately this rich interplay of response, in dialogue with the longstanding critique of the monster, that will help us more fully articulate the genre’s corresponding socio-political work, including its importance for feminism, queer theory and critical race theory. Possible films include The Shining, The Haunting, It Follows, Babadook, Get Out, and Parasite.\n\nText: Coursepack\n\nEvaluation: three short assignments 55%, class notes 5%, term project 30%, participation 10%\n\nFormat: Lecture/discussions and weekly conferences\n\nENGL 368 - Stage Scenery & Lighting 1\n\nInstructor TBA\n\nFall 2024\n\nTime TBA\n\nLearn theatre production skills and put them into action on the English Department theatre production as an integral part of the production team. Work in various aspects of a backstage running crew. Learn practical skills through hands-on work in the theatre.

Note that this term we will study the period in reverse chronological order (Romantic to Restoration). The course is divided into four chronological units encompassing the development of stage spectacle, the age of Garrick and the professionalisation of theatre, the rise of morality and sentiment in drama, and the reopening of the professional theatre and the advent of the professional actress. Each unit will cover the theatrical conditions of the period and will examine a representative play staged at the time. Emphasis is placed on the plays as theatrical works rather than literary texts. Students will be asked to conceptualise performances of the plays as they might have taken place in the long eighteenth century and how these performances might have been received. We will also analyse historical documents to explore themes such as genre, acting style, audience experience, theatre architecture, financial practices, regulation of the stage, and company management. We will work with McGill Library’s Rare Books and Special Collections to complete a series of hands-on workshops and assignments with a collection of playbills from the period. This will allow us to deepen our understanding of theatre in the long eighteenth century through the study of print culture.\n\nTexts:\n\nTextbook: Peter Thomson, The Cambridge Introduction to English Theatre, 1660-1900 (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2006).\n\nCoursepack containing the following plays (tentative): Aphra Behn, The Rover (1677); Richard Steele, The Conscious Lovers (1722); David Garrick and George Colman the Elder, The Clandestine Marriage (1766); Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Pizarro (1799), plus a selection of historical documents for context.\n\nEvaluation (tentative): participation 10%; production journal 20%; playbill assignment 30%; take home final exam 40%\n\nFormat: lecture, discussion, group work, work with rare books and special collections\n\nENGL 371 - Theatre Hist: 19th to 21st C\n\nUS Popular Entertainments, 1820-1940\n\nProfessor Katherine Zien\n\nWinter 2025\n\nTime TBA\n\nDescription: This course explores representations and constructions of U.S. national identity in nineteenth- and twentieth-century popular theatre and entertainments. As the nation experienced industrialization, urbanization, immigration, changing sexual and gender norms, and violent cultural and racial conflicts in the afterlife of Trans-Atlantic slavery and Indigenous genocide, popular entertainments attracted mass audiences and created spectacles of national inclusion and othering. Units on blackface minstrelsy, “Indian plays,” vaudeville, social dance, and other popular form address antebellum and post-Emancipation stagings of race; frontier spectacles; freak shows and penny museums; imperialism; and the complexities of social inequity in the Golden Age/Progressive Era. Through discussions and lectures, we will consider the place of the “popular” – in its classed, ethnic, racial, gendered, erotic, commercial, and hegemonic valences – in forging styles of U.S. citizenship and belonging that persist to the current day, albeit often in camouflage.\n\nTexts: All texts will be provided via MyCourses.\n\nPlay texts (including Metamora; The Octoroon; Uncle Tom’s Cabin)\n\nFilms (including The Jazz Singer; Ethnic Notions)\n\nOnline secondary sources including texts by W.E.B.

TV. Radio\n\nCinema\n\nProfessor Trevor Ponech\n\nWinter 2025\n\nTime TBA\n\nPrerequisite: None.\n\nDescription: ENGL 380 is an opportunity to think in depth about the art of nonfictional cinema. We’ll investigate the ways in which and the reasons why nonfictional movies differ decisively from fictional ones. The differences between these two mega-categories mainly have to do with the particular ends and effects that makers design their movies to achieve. Fictional and nonfictional movies can be very similar to one another in many interesting respects. Both categories are, of course, full of works manifesting virtuoso and imaginative uses of the cinematic medium’s characteristic tools and practices. And both contain many examples of makers presenting stories in ways apt to arouse viewers’ emotions and challenge them intellectually. Yet beyond such similarities are myriad differences between fiction- and nonfiction-makers’ expressive, cognitive, and artistic projects.\n\nEvaluation: Brief written assignments, term paper.\n\nFormat: Lectures, discussions, screenings.\n\nENGL 390 - Political and Cultural Theory\n\nBlack Feminist Theories\n\nProfessor Amber Rose Johnson\n\nFall 2024\n\n13:00-14:30\n\nEDUC 211\n\nDescription: This course will trace the development of black feminisms from the mid nineteenth-century to the present—with the focus largely on contemporary Black feminisms from the 1970s to today. Central to our exploration will be the analysis of the intersectional relationship between theory and practice, and between race, gender, class, and sexuality. Focusing on black women’s political struggles in the US and Canada (in addition to some engagements with the Caribbean) we will consider: The significance of transatlantic slavery to contemporary Black experiences. The ways that Black women have been subject to and resisted racism, sexism, homophobia, and economic oppression. And the ways that Black expressive cultures—visual art, literature, poetry, film, etc.—challenge dominant constructions of Black identity formations. Readings, viewings, and listenings may include: Anna Julia Cooper, Patricia Hill Collins, Barbara Smith, Audre Lorde, Angela Davis, Jamila Woods, Morgan Parker and Dionne Brand.\n\nTexts:\n\nSister Outsider by Audre Lorde\n\nAin’t I a Woman: Black Women and Feminism by bell hooks\n\nEvaluation: Participation (10%), Short Writings/Reflections (30%), Mid-term paper (30%), Final Essay or Creative Project and Reflection (30%)\n\nFormat: Lecture and class discussion\n\nENGL 391 - Spec Top:Cultural Studies 1\n\nGirlhood Cinemas: Coming of Age in the Cultural Imaginary\n\nInstructor Amanda Greer\n\nFall 2024\n\nM/W 08:30-10:00\n\nDescription:\n\nGirlhood cinemas have primarily been discussed via representational analysis, staking moralizing claims by labelling some representations “good,” and others as “bad.” This approach neglects girlhood’s impact on visual cultures, and its entanglements with weighty, near-universal concepts like loneliness, monstrosity, and political anger. Drawing from Fiona Handyside’s observation that “girlhood is a visual construction,” this course insists that girlhood cinemas have their own unique stylistic approaches to coming-of-age narratives, demanding careful formal analysis.\n\n“Girlhood Cinemas” will explore two aesthetic concepts each week in relation to a girlhood film, from traditional understandings of girlhood aesthetics, like cuteness and prettiness, to the less-theorized concepts of quietude and witchiness. A global and intersectional cinema course, we will discuss films from a diverse array of filmmakers and countries, from Indigenous Canadian productions to diasporic Zambian films. Together, we will read works of feminist theory and philosophy, cinema studies, and girlhood studies to build an understanding of how girlhood is stylistically constructed in cinema.\n\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to: 1) explicate key aesthetic devices used to portray girlhood in cinema; 2) apply formal reading strategies to complex arthouse and independent film productions; 3) compare and contrast differences across national cinemas using transnational analysis; 4) analyze how intersectional identities shape onscreen girlhoods; and 5) conceptualize novel “aesthetic categories” of girlhood using theories of visual cultures and aesthetics. As a class, we will ask: How is girlhood used around the world as a medium for constructing aesthetic categories and exploring the moral complexities of living?\n\nTexts: Readings available on myCourses; films available for rent or purchase, or through library services (e.g., Kanopy)\n\nEvaluation:\n\nDiscussion and Engagement: 15% (ways to gain marks here include in-class participation, independent reflections, group work, office hour attendance, online discussion boards, etc.)\n\nFilm/Scene Analysis: 25% (due October 9th)\n\nMajor Paper or Project: 30% (due November 20th)\n\nFinal Examination: 30% (date TBD)\n\nFormat: Two lecture/discussion periods per week, plus a screening period (with option to screen at home).

To acquire a deep understanding of this popular literary form, students will design their own Historical Novel in this course, while responding to four variations of the genre and four key scholarly discussions of it. In other words, this course has an academic as well as creative component but note that you are certainly not expected to produce a full-fledged novel at the end of the semester—just an outline and sample chapter along with a detailed discussion of how our readings help you negotiate the genre’s opportunities and pitfalls.\n\nTexts (at McGill’s bookstore Le James):\n\nIvanhoe by Sir Walter Scott\n\nA Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens\n\nOrlando by Virginia Woolf\n\nAvishag by Yael Lotan\n\nCoursepack (Lukács, Ragussis, Shaw, Hutcheon)\n\nEvaluation: 15% class participation; 40% responses to the scholarly readings; 25% outline and sample chapter of a Historical Novel of your own design; 20% critical explanation.\n\nFormat: Discussion and literary workshops\n\nENGL 396 - Theatre Practicum 1\n\nProfessor Sean Carney\n\nFall 2024\n\nTime TBA\n\nNote: Meets weekday evenings throughout the Fall 2024 term, some Friday and/or Saturday afternoons (depending on rehearsal schedule)\n\nLocations: Rehearsal Hall and Moyse Hall Theatre\n\nPrerequisite: this course is restricted to students who have been cast in the Fall 2024 Department of English mainstage production and is by permission of the instructor only. Students should request to enroll in the course before the end of add/drop. Please contact Sean Carney at sean.carney [at] mcgill.ca for more information.\n\nDescription: This three-credit course provides students with credit towards their Drama and Theatre majors, minors, or honors degrees. Students who are cast in the English Department’s Fall 2024 theatre production may ask for permission to enroll in ENGL 396. This is a graded course (see “Evaluation” below).\n\nThe course may satisfy the “3 credits from a list of performance-oriented courses” requirement for Drama and Theatre Majors or the “additional credits from the Drama and Theatre option’s offerings” requirement for Drama and Theatre Majors and Minors.\n\nThe content of the course involves attending all required rehearsals and performances for the production, required meetings with costume designers, participating in the strike on closing night, and showing dedicated commitment to the process and to the overall production.\n\nThere is also a written component required, most likely a reflection essay at the end of the process.\n\nEvaluation: TBA\n\n400-Level\n\nAdvanced Courses\n\nENGL 400 - Earlier English Renaissance\n\nElizabethan Romance\n\nProfessor Kenneth Borris\n\nFall 2024\n\nTime TBA\n\nDescription: One of the centrally fashionable literary genres of early modern Europe, romance was the most important precursor of the novel, though in many ways different. It was characterized by much narrative variety, multiple plots, open-ended structures, digression, coincidence, fantasy, wonder, and wish-fulfilment; in its uniquely serendipitous version of the world, few social conventions or expectations can be taken for granted. Its major exponents include Ariosto, Tasso, Cervantes, Sidney, Spenser, and Shakespeare. From around 1575 to 1610, the writing of romance became particularly vibrant in England. Focusing on the diverse expressions of this literary form at this time there, in prose fiction, narrative poetry, and drama, this course should especially interest those attracted to early modern studies, or to the history and development of the novel, or to the theory and history of literary forms. Proceeding chronologically, the course will address texts that epitomize romance’s scope in this period, including the qualitatively best and most influential exemplars, as well as those that were most popular in sales, such as Robert Greene’s, which illustrate the genre’s cultural topicality. So as best to define romance and its interactions with other genres in particular texts that engineer complex generic mixtures, such as Sidney’s and Spenser’s, attention will be given to the theory of literary genres.\n\nTexts\n\nSir Philip Sidney, The New Arcadia, edited by Maurice Evans, Penguin paperback\n\nEdmund Spenser, Books I and VI of The Faerie Queene; both Hackett paperbacks\n\nWilliam Shakespeare, Cymbeline, The Winter’s Tale, The Tempest; all Oxford World Classics paperbacks\n\nCourse Reader for ENGL 400, provided as files for each text, on the ENGL 400 MyCourses website, such as Robert Greene’s Pandosto and Menaphon (both short)\n\nEvaluation: term paper, 50%; final exam, 35%; class attendance and participation, 15%\n\nFormat: lectures and class discussion\n\nENGL 410 - Theme or Movement Canadian Lit\n\nCanadian Crime Fiction\n\nProfessor Nathalie Cooke\n\nFall 2024\n\nT/Th 14:30-16:00\n\nArts 230\n\nPrerequisite: Students should have 2 or 3 prior courses in English literature, preferably survey and poetics\n\nDescription: This course will focus on Canadian crime fiction, which has garnered deserved popularity and acclaim on the world stage, its authors seeing adaptations of their work for television and film. By the end of the term, students will be able to identify key components of crime novels, distinguish between different subgenres of crime fiction, read critically to identify narratological elements of the genre, demonstrate familiarity with the crime writer’s toolkit by using it in the service of their own preliminary story outline, and perhaps even follow clues and ignore red herrings to anticipate novelistic outcomes.\n\nFormat: Lecture and discussion\n\nEvaluation: in-class participation 10%; journal to include oral presentation components, submitted in increments, 70%; story outline & presentation, 20%.\n\nTexts:\n\nCommentaries on crime writing (including those by Gail Bowen, Raymond Chandler, Alan Goldman, Patricia Gouthro).\n\nSix novels likely selected from those by Gail Bowen [Joanne Kilbourn], Giles Blunt [John Cardinal], Maureen Jennings [John Murdoch], Thomas King [Stumps DreadfulWater], Ann Lambert [Roméo Leduc], Louise Penny [Armand Gamache], Kathy Reichs [Temperance Brennan] & Eric Wright [Charlie Salter]).\n\nEnrollment: 30\n\nENGL 411 - Studies in Cdn Fiction\n\nLeonard Cohen and P.K. Page\n\nProfessor Robert Lecker\n\nFall 2024\n\nTime TBA\n\n(Note: For English Majors, this course qualifies for the required three credits from a course in Canadian literature or for a course on a major author)\n\nDescription: In this course we will delve into the multifaceted worlds of two compelling Canadian artist/writers: Leonard Cohen and P.K. Page. Through their poetry, fiction, music, and painting, both address many of the prominent concerns emerging in their era: the morality and purpose of the writer; the nature of spirituality; the impact of the natural world; the possibility of aesthetic transcendence. Cohen often wondered whether he was a metaphor. Or, as he put it, “I cannot understand why my arm is not a lilac tree.” Page meditated on the power of creativity: “If we but give it time, a work of art ‘can rap and knock and enter our souls’ and re-align us – all our molecules – to make us whole again.”\n\nCohen, celebrated for his dual roles as a musician and poet, presents a compelling study in the convergence of literature and popular culture. We will trace Cohen’s literary evolution from the Beat generation to the complexities of celebrity status and its impact on Cohen's life and work, examining how fame shaped his artistic identity and influenced his creative process. In this context, we will experience his poetry, listen to his music, read some of his fiction, and watch a variety of films and videos focussing on different periods in his career. Eventually, at the age of 80, he had to go back on tour to support himself. Cohen had a succinct response to that experience: “I like life on the road. It's a lot easier than civilian life. You kind of feel like you're in a motorcycle gang.”\n\nP.K. Page, often regarded as one of Canada's most innovative and celebrated poets, crafted a body of work that transcends conventional boundaries of poetic form and subject matter. Page's poetry exhibits a remarkable versatility, ranging from traditional verse forms to experimental free verse. And it is often mysterious. Page said that “I liked poetry better when I wasn't sure what it meant.” Page’s evolution is marked by the time she spent in Brazil and Mexico, where she turned to drawing and painting. We will look at the paintings she created during this period and consider them as visual expressions of her shifting poetics. Page's poetry grapples with pressing social and political issues, reflecting her commitment to justice and human rights. Whether addressing the legacies of colonialism in Canada, the ravages of war and conflict, feminist aesthetics, or the urgent need for environmental conservation, Page's poetry is marked by a fierce determination to bear witness to the injustices of her time. As early as 1981, she anticipated global warming. For the past two decades, Page's poems have celebrated the planet, but they also remind us of widespread ecological peril. As she wrote in 1990: \"Art and the planet tell us. Change your life.\"\n\nTexts: TBD.\n\nEvaluation: A series of short essays (50%); final essay (20%); participation (20%); attendance (10%).\n\nFormat: Seminar (lectures and discussion)\n\nENGL 414 - Studies in 20th C Literature 1\n\nCritical Race Readings of American Children’s Literature\n\nProfessor Camille Owens\n\nWinter 2025\n\nTime TBA\n\nDescription: Debates are ongoing in the U.S. about whether various forms of thought described as “critical race theory” should be allowed to enter into children’s literature, textbooks, or classrooms. This seminar troubles the underlying assumptions of this debate—that race is an adult subject, and that childhood has ever been separated from it. As we will explore in this course, children’s literature and culture were key sites for instilling the historical relations of American slavery, colonialism, and white supremacy—and they have also been major sites for challenging the effects and legacies of these histories. In this course, we will examine the dominant literary construction of white American childhood across the late-nineteenth and 20th centuries. We will also study texts that illustrate how black, Indigenous, and Latinx North American people fought to make a place for their children in literary, cultural, and educational spheres. By examining formations of childhood as they vary across historical periods and competing ideologies, we will highlight both the ‘constructedness’ of childhood as a social category, and the literary forms through which childhood has derived coherence and cultural power. From the pictorial primer, to the coming-of-age novel, to contemporary YA graphic literature—to books frequently “banned” from children’s reading—we will advance toward a critical understanding of children’s literature as a major rather than minor category of American literature. Bringing questions of literacy, pedagogy, narrative structure, and social hierarchy together, we will test critical race theories and develop our own. Selected texts may include: Mark Twain, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, L. Frank Baum, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Francis La Flesche, The Middle Five, Jessie Fauset and W.E.B. Du Bois, The Brownies’ Book; Gwendolyn Brooks, Maud Martha, Toni Morrison, The Bluest Eye; James Baldwin, Little Man, Little Man; Justin Torres, We the Animals, and George M.

Winner of the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize, recipient of a MacArthur “Genius” grant and the nearly-as-lucrative honor of Oprah’s Book Club, and the most contemporary novelist included in the Norton Anthology of African American Literature, Whitehead stands at the very center of the contemporary canon. According to critics and scholars alike, part of what makes Whitehead so singular is his ability to write across a vast array of literary and mass-cultural forms: detective and encyclopedic fiction (The Intuitionist [1999], John Henry Days [2001]), contemporary satire and the bildungsroman (Apex Hides the Hurt [2006], Sag Harbor [2009]), and more recently, zombie fiction, the meta-slave narrative, and the heist novel (Zone One [2011], The Underground Railroad [2016], Harlem Shuffle [2021]). Students in this course will investigate the trajectory of Whitehead’s body of work as well as how his oeuvre indexes contemporary issues of Black literary production, historical memory, and canon formation. Over the course of the semester, we will study (nearly) all of Whitehead’s published novels, including the newly-published installments of his “Harlem Trilogy.”\n\nTexts: The Intuitionist (1999); John Henry Days (2001); Apex Hides the Hurt (2006); Zone One (2011); The Underground Railroad (2016); The Nickel Boys (2019); Harlem Shuffle (2021); Crook Manifesto (2023).\n\nEvaluation: 15 pages of Critical Writing (70%), divided across 2-5+ assignments as agreed upon by each student and the instructor; Formal Research Presentation (20%); Seminar Participation (10%)\n\nFormat: Seminar\n\nENGL 418 - A Major Modernist Writer\n\nElizabeth Bowen\n\nProfessor Allan Hepburn\n\nWinter 2025\n\nT/Th 11:30-1:00\n\nDescription: Anglo-Irish by birth, Bowen moved constantly between Ireland and Britain, Britain and the US, and on occasion to Italy, France, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Canada. Her fiction reflects experiments in modernist technique as well as her cosmopolitan disposition. Mobility is a central preoccupation in her fiction. With examples drawn from both her novels and short fiction, this course will examine Bowen’s thoughts on war, women, land ownership, hospitality, aristocratic privilege, Irish history, civic responsibility, friendship, hotel culture, motherhood, interior decoration, atmosphere, extramarital affairs, and other topics. In her essays, Bowen frequently comments on her contemporaries and their writing: Virginia Woolf, Ivy Compton-Burnett, D.H. Lawrence, Anton Chekhov, Guy de Maupassant. Essays about style, short stories, the state of the novel will therefore be threaded into the course to widen the parameters of discussion. Part of the course will be devoted to archival materials—letters in particular—that develop understanding about Bowen’s aesthetic and public engagements.\n\nPrerequisite: This course is for advanced students. Expected preparation is 3 or 4 prior courses in English literature.\n\nFormat: Lecture and discussion.\n\nEvaluation: bibliography, essay, attendance and participation, final exam\n\nTexts: Elizabeth Bowen: a selection of short stories and essays; The Last September, Friends and Relations, To the North, The House in Paris, The Death of the Heart, The Heat of the Day\n\nENGL 419 - Studies in 20th C Literature\n\nBreaking the Sequence: Narrative Interventions in Early Twentieth-Century Experimental Fiction\n\nProfessor Miranda Hickman\n\nFall 2024\n\nTime TBA\n\nPreparation: At least one course at the 200 or 300 level, ideally addressing twentieth-century literature\n\nDescription: Early twentieth-century modernist narrative, by writers such as Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Zora Neale Hurston, and Jean Rhys, often aimed to “break” the “expected sequence,” to borrow a phrase from the collection of modernist experimental women’s writing. Often writers were re-thinking narrative sequencing toward formal innovation, seeking narrative strategies to represent sensitively the passage of thought and consciousness, designed to gain more sensitive purchase on what Woolf called the “quick of the mind” and the “places of psychology.” Many sought new narrative techniques that have subsequently been recognized as versions of “stream of consciousness.” Others, such as Dorothy Richardson and Gertrude Stein, in tandem with formal experiment per se, sought to critique and write their way beyond expected sequences and scripts in the culture - associated with the marriage plot and what Adrienne Rich would later call “compulsory heterosexuality”; with “Bildung,” or concepts of education, formation and development; and with cultural scripts ascribing roles to women and men. Some, such as H.D. and Bryher, and Ralph Ellison, aspired actively to intervene in fictions of development – such as the Bildungsroman or the related genre, the Künstlerroman, and the normative cultural assumptions – about construction of identity, gender and sexuality, racialized positionality, class - underwriting these genres and which they helped to sustain. This course considers a range of such “narrative interventions,” construed in several senses – both efforts to reimagine language and narrative form for different ways of understanding modern life, individuals, and communities; and to revise understandings of the narratives and plots according to which individuals and communities form their senses of identity, history and visions for the future.\n\nTexts (Tentative):\n\nAnand, Mulk Raj, Untouchable (1935)\n\nBryher, Two Selves (1922)\n\nEllison, Ralph, Invisible Man (1953)\n\nH.D., HERmione (1926-27)\n\nHurston, Zora Neale, Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937)\n\nJoyce, James, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916)\n\nLarsen, Nella, Passing (1929)\n\nRichardson, Dorothy, Pointed Roofs (1915)\n\nWoolf, Virginia, Mrs. Dalloway (1925) and Orlando (1928)\n\nFormat: Lecture and Discussion\n\nEvaluation: Brief responses (10%); 2 briefer critical essays (4-5pp., each 20%); creative project (4-5pp., 15%); longer essay (7pp., 25%); participation (10%)\n\nENGL 422 - Studies in 19th C American Lit\n\nThe Emergence of the Modern American Short Story through the Long Nineteenth Century\n\nProfessor Peter Gibian\n\nWinter 2025\n\nTime TBA\n\nExpected Student Preparation: Previous coursework in American Literature before 1900, or in 19th-century British fiction, or permission of instructor.\n\nDescription: Intensive study of a diverse range of shorter prose fictions produced by American authors—mainly over the course of the long nineteenth century, but culminating in close readings of some of the classic short stories produced in the early twentieth century, and ending with a quick look at some contemporary case studies that develop and test the potential in earlier models. Rather than tracing a singular evolution of the short story mode, we will explore a variety of authors whose works test the possibilities of the short form in very different ways. Each of these writers discovered early on that the short story is not simply a miniaturized novel but operates as a literary vehicle with its own distinctive powers and limitations. After an introductory review of recent scholarly work on the theory of the modern short story, and on the history of its development, we will survey a selection of foundational and influential short fictions that reveal the short story’s uses in relation to myth, romance, and the fantastic; to uncanny plots about ghosts and haunting; to evocation of suppressed emotional or psychic states; to representation of neglected cultural identities; to the impulses of regionalism; to urban experience; to crime and detection; and to self-reflexive interrogations of fictional form itself. Indeed the short story has often served for thoughtful and ambitious American writers not only as a simple form with which they could begin their literary training but as a privileged site for self-conscious experimentation with new modes of imagery, new subject matter, and new narrat"
