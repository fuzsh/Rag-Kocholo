        "text": "Mavis Gallant does not necessarily read nor keep reviews of her own work - except for one, her favourite because the reviewer understood exactly what she has spent her life doing. It is from the Spanish newspaper El Pais, and she knows it by heart. \"Gallant went around Europe after the war with a notebook and pen. Nobody saw her, nobody knew anything about her, she was like Canetti's Invisible Woman - she took down everything that we in western Europe thought was not important, and now we know that that was what mattered.\" She is editing the raw material, 50 years of journals (a projected five volumes, one per decade since 1950, when she first left Canada) but what she is known for is her fiction - 13 books of short stories, two novels, and one play. Russell Banks has written, apropos Gallant, that \"the tension - and sometimes outright conflict - between remembered and felt experience on the one hand and, on the other, the known truth of what happened, lies at the heart of all great short stories\"; in Gallant's work this is both individual and historical. She has devoted half a century to working against forgetting, but also against re-remembering; against the moral tarnishing - of people, and through them, of nations - that comes with adapting the truth in order to make it more bearable.\n\nThis is not easy or comfortable; it is not particularly forgiving; it does not offer catharsis or transcendence. She is criticised for what some see as cold brilliance, a certain misanthropy: John McGahern, writing in the New York Times in 1993, is not unusual in finding her to be \"a scalpel-sharp anatomiser of various forms of stupidity, and while this skilfulness can often seem just and very funny, sometimes it leaves behind an unpleasant aftertaste, as if the witty, controlled prose is functioning at the expense of her characters\". Daniel Menaker, who followed the redoubtable William Maxwell as her editor at the New Yorker, feels that \"if she has a failing it is, like Vermeer, a failing of mastery. There's an aphoristic quality to her writing, a kind of precision and craftsmanship that can be a little distancing sometimes - but I don't really want to fault her. Writers of her calibre in any given genre are three or four per century.\" Of living short story writers Alice Munro is, he says, another; Banks offers William Trevor as the third.\n\nIn 1978 the Canadian journalist Martin Knelman made a pilgrimage to Gallant's flat on the edge of Montparnasse and found \"one of the great talkers of the age\": \"She has a talent for literary gossip, with such a devastatingly witty tongue that one is simultaneously enchanted and anxious to escape becoming its victim. She's so demanding, and so quick to see through the slightest hypocrisy, that it's no wonder people think of her as difficult. Yet there is also a sense of directness and openness about this woman that is ultimately a form of generosity.\" Odile Hellier, who owns the English-language Village Voice Bookshop in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, has known Gallant for almost 20 years. \"It's extraordinary how focused she is on her friends at the moment you are with her. She has a fantastic memory - you tell her a story once and she can remember it 20 years later. To spend an evening with her is like drinking champagne - it's brilliant, it's funny, it's multifaceted.\" Gallant has recently been dogged by health problems, and seems frail, but this does not hide her great charm or her fierce engagement, the spiky wariness of one who once introduced a story collection by quoting Boris Pasternak: \"Only personal independence matters.\"\n\nIt is a hard-earned lesson. Gallant - née Young - was born to English-speaking, Protestant parents in 1922 in Montreal, when in that province religion, language, Quebec, not to mention the gradations of class within these groups, were utterly definitive, a kind of self-imposed apartheid. Soon after her fourth birthday they left her in a French, Jansenist boarding school. \"The only thing I remember,\" she has said, \"is my mother putting me on a chair and saying, 'I'll be back in 10 minutes'. She just didn't come back.\"\n\nFrom then on she was home only for holidays, forming an impression of parents \"who enjoyed themselves, or seemed to\" - dancing with American friends in flight from Prohibition, playing old-fashioned records: \"My mother was cuckoo about an Irish tenor called John McCormick\" - and sitting in the upstairs poetry section of Hellier's bookshop, she sings sweetly, girlishly:\n\n\"'I have heard the mavis singing/Its love song to the morn.../'Twas thy voice, my gentle Mary -'\n\n\"That was very confusing for me as a child. Who's the central character? Then there's one where he addressed the mavis:\n\n\"'The birds are calling sweet/The children run down in the wild wood/For flowers to lay at your feeeeet -'\" And her usually quiet voice swells into a slightly mocking flourish. When, in her 50s, Gallant came to write a sequence of unusually autobiographical, often tautly angry stories, she called the protagonist Linnet Muir: mavis is a medieval word for song thrush; Muir and Young are Lowland Scots names; when the character marries, the name she takes, Blanchard, is, like Gallant, French.\n\nIt's a typical grace note from someone who has written that \"memory ... is inseparable from language\", and has always been completely bilingual. Most of Gallant's life has been conducted in French; she was not formally taught written English until she was eight, though for years she had been finding comfort in English storybooks, establishing it as what she calls her \"language of imagination\". \"It's two railway tracks,\" she says. \"I have occasionally - but rarely - made a mistake where I've used an English word in a French sense. I once wrote of a 'disaffected factory'\". More importantly, \"in French you don't have the same sort of conversation, and you don't talk about the same things. If you write about French-speaking people, in English, as I do, you read it carefully after it's written - would a French-speaking person express himself that way?\"\n\nWhen she was 10, her father returned to England, where he had been born. Only 31, he suffered, in the circumlocution of the time, from \"delicate kidneys\"; he had gone home to die, but Gallant was not told this for three years. Her mother quickly remarried, to a man Gallant did not like, and moved to New York, initially dispatching her to relatives in Ontario, then depositing her in boarding schools (eventually numbering 17). Gallant, kept ignorant of the truth, fretted that her father wouldn't be able to find her. \"I kept waiting for him to send for me,\" Gallant writes in \"In Youth is Pleasure\", one of the Linnet Muir stories, \"for my life was deeply wretched and I took it for granted that he knew. Finally I began to suspect that death and silence can be one. How to be sure? Head-on questions got me nowhere. I had to create a situation in which some adult (not my mother, who was far too sharp) would lose all restraint and hurl the truth at me ... I think what I wanted was special information about despair.\"\n\nHer stories are littered with betrayed, abandoned, watchful children; they may not quite understand what they are seeing, but they are wise to parental incompetence, adultery, bad faith. In her first novel, Green Water, Green Sky (1959) a young woman, Flor, dragged by her divorced mother across tattered postwar Europe, tries and eventually fails to hang on to her sanity: \"If Bonnie had been able to give some form to her own untidy life; if she had not uprooted Flor and brought her over here to live ... Flor would not, at this moment, have feared the movement of the pavement under her feet and watched herself in shop windows to make sure she was still there ... She would have depended less on words; she would have belonged to life. She told an imagined Bonnie, 'It was always your fault. I might have been a person, but you made me a foreigner'.\" An abiding subject was established: Gallant, says Menaker, \"writes about displacement better than anything else\".\n\nShe knew she had to write, has written for as long as she can remember, but she laboured under the fear that \"I had inherited a flawed legacy, the vocation without the competence to sustain it\": her father worked for a furniture importer by day, but also painted, and, as Gallant told Canadian journalist Carole Corbeil, \"I say this with affection, [but] he had no talent - he painted like a provincial, minor late-Impressionist. He did, however, have an incredible sense of vocation.\" The minute she turned 18 she escaped to Montreal, to the last place she had seen him. And \"I thought if I got geographically out of the way [of my mother] I could breathe.\"\n\nShe had to earn a living and wanted it to be as close to writing as possible, so she went first to an English-language weekly newspaper, the Standard (now defunct); they said she was too young, so she got a low-level job at the National Film Board. She feels we underestimate the effect cinematic technique has on 20th-century writers, on their rhythm, that it frees fiction from unnecessary connective tissue; her own prose abounds with unannounced and disorientating shifts, perspective slipping from paragraph to paragraph. \"The stories feel cubist in their angles and qualifications,\" Michael Ondaatje has written, \"although the narrator often gives the air of being attached, lazily, almost accidentally, like a burr to some character - an Italian servant perhaps, a tax consultant, an art dealer...\"\n\nThe Standard accepted her in 1944, when she was 21, but on sufferance; she soon overheard an editor say, \"If it hadn't been for the goddamned war, we wouldn't have hired even one of the goddamned women.\" Refusing to do \"women's work\", she became a respected and sometimes controversial feature writer: fellow Montreal journalist, novelist, filmmaker and longtime friend William Weintraub remembers an exposé of a baby farm in Nova Scotia (the babies of unwed mothers were sold to couples who had failed legal adoption requirements) which caused a libel suit but also closed the farm; and the fuss that accompanied a 1946 piece called \"Why are Canadians so dull?\" \"She was very impressive, a very attractive woman, lively and controversial, and a great conversationalist. She knew everybody. We used to sit in the Press Club and argue about everything under the sun.\"\n\n\"This was pre-television, so there would be whole sections that were just photo stories,\" Gallant says. \"I adored those. They were like little films.\" But she was also shown the first pictures coming out of the concentration camps, was asked for captions and \"a little information of 750 words\": \"You cannot truly imagine what the first concentration camp pictures [meant] for someone my age,\" she told an interviewer in 1978, because \"this knowl edge is part of your culture.\" The Standard did not print what she wrote, but she kept it for 20 years. \"I tore it up when I saw that the concentration camp experience, its lesson, its warning, had become kitsch.\" Gallant championed composers and artists, and interviewed Sartre (\"who was banned in Quebec. Camus was banned, Colette was banned, everything was banned - except in English. They didn't care if we went to hell\"). Unlike her usual, disrespectful interviewees, \"he was very patient, very good. Sartre liked girls, so that was a big help, for once, and as I walked back to the newspaper, I had an outrageous thought - this is how a writer should behave, and when they come and interview me, I will be like Mr Sartre. The cheek of it! Even thinking that! I had published nothing - and I've often thought - what made me think anything so arrogant?\" He also assured her that writing could be an end in itself.\n\nEqually at home among French and English Canadians, she was amassing \"an enormous mental capital of places and people, some of which still seeps into my stories\", and she had a much-envied job, but she was also frustrated. Partly it was the treatment of women: the Press Club voted to keep women out, and \"I soon realised,\" she has said, \"that a male co-worker with less responsibility was making $18 a week more, and at that time $18 was a lot of money. When I went to my boss, I didn't ask 'pay him less' but 'pay me more', and was told that the man needed the money more, 'he's a man, he'll have a family to support'. I was the sole support of our family, my husband was a student. It broke my heart. I saw that's how it was in Canada.\" Her husband was a musician from Winnipeg called John Gallant; the marriage did not last long, but she kept his name because it was her byline, and because she was not on bad terms with him.\n\nShe needed to stop writing fiction in snatched moments at lunchtime, on the train, in the evening, and do it properly. She was 28, and thought \"if you didn't know the direction of your life by the time you were 30, you may as well hang yourself. I was afraid I'd lose my nerve if I lingered.\" The place that drew her was Paris, although - to some extent because - she had no friends there, no connections. She told the managing editor she intended to quit. He sent her to a second office, where \"I was told I was out of my mind; one day I would come creeping back, begging for my old job; ... all reporters think they can write; I had the audacity to call myself a writer when I was like an architect who had never designed a house.\" At the same time, she sent three stories to Maxwell, who accepted one. He supported her need to leave, as did the Standard's publisher, who stumped up $500. In 1950, with the aid of an airline executive who provided a ticket, she left. \"My life,\" says Linnet Muir, \"was my own revolution.\"\n\nParis was \"black with the soot of centuries. And it rained all winter.\" But it was not disillusioning, \"because it was very like the literature. I found that in London people seemed divorced from their literature, but here people seemed closer to it. You could talk to a taxi driver about Émile Zola and even if he hadn't read it he knew what you were talking about. That bowled me over. And also it was a place where writers were respected - they had no feeling that if a writer didn't have much money that he wasn't a good writer.\"\n\nIt was also, she found, much easier to be a woman on her own in Paris. \"Whenever I've come close to marrying again,\" she once said, \"I've had to ask myself, 'What kind of a life would this mean? Is his life larger than mine - because mine is large. Will my life take in his, or will his take in mine?' If I had lived in Canada I may have married just because of social pressure - an unmarried woman [there] is somehow odd, an extra woman ... It still seems to matter socially that people be matched up - hostesses begin cock-counting, he's with her and she's for him; if you're having an orgy, fine, but for chocolate soufflé what does it matter?\" In Paris she found men actually enjoyed the company of women, gave them what she has called \"moral respect\"; it is striking that she often writes from a male point of view, and, particularly latterly, of men in disconcerted middle age.\n\nFor the next 25 years she travelled all over Europe, obeying the \"desire to see - that's what I left North America for, to be free\". In Madrid, in 1952-53 (where she began because \"my first political tidal wave\" was the Spanish civil war), she was forced to sell her own clothes, even though \"it was under Franco, and it was very cheap. And they didn't charge for baths, which the French did - they charged for the hot water and they charged you for the gas to heat the hot water.\" She giggles. \"I became less fastidious.\" She had sold more stories to the New Yorker, and to Esquire, but she didn't know: the agent she had picked out of a handbook was pocketing the money, telling the New Yorker she lived on Capri and didn't want to be disturbed. \"[The New Yorker] thought I was eccentric.\" Finally, accidentally, she came across a copy with one of her stories in it, and asked why she had not seen proofs. The New Yorker hired lawyers to break her contract with the agent. \"I wasn't the only person he'd done this to. He was killed in a car accident and I didn't care. Because he knew I was hard up, and it was mean, mean. Because I was desperate.\" Once paid, the first, giddy thing she did was rent a house on the beach in Majorca. Gallant has lived on her fiction ever since, which makes her proud.\n\nIn 1954 she acquired a small house in Menton, in the south of France, and much of her work is set in terrain she has made her own: the attenuated, tragic-absurd life of pensions and rented villas, of off-season resorts, of genteel hotels. In The Remission (1979), for example, a father \"tore up his English life and came down to die on the Riviera. The time was early in the reign of Elizabeth, and people were still doing this - migrating with no other purpose than the hope of a merciful sky.\" Gallant spent about half of each year in Menton until the mid-70s, when her Paris pied-à-terre became her full-time home.\n\n\"I was passionately interested in Germany,\" says Gallant, \"in what had really gone on in Germany - and I'm talking about Germans, not victims, because a victim can't tell you, they only know what they suffered. I admired German culture and I couldn't figure out why the culture had not been a rampart. It was only that\" - she indicates a low wall - \"in the end. I spent a lot of time in the 60s in Germany - I kept on trying to meet people. I was sure that it was the petit bourgeoisie who'd taken over, not the working class and not the upper class - there were never enough of them. But I didn't apportion blame.\" Out of this exploration came a novella, The Pegnitz Junction (1973, her favourite of her own work), and haunting stories of Germans who have mislaid their pasts, of ex-Hitler Jugend purposeless without their uniforms. \"The streets still smelled of terror and ashes, particularly after rain,\" she writes in An Alien Flower (1972). \"No one was inferior, because everyone was. A social amnesty had been declared.\"\n\n\"You cannot read her stories,\" says Janice Kulyk Keefer, author of Reading Mavis Gallant (OUP, 1989), \"without recognising that one of our most persistent characteristics is the desire to forget our capacity for suffering and for inflicting suffering on other people\". Banks reaches for Beckett: \"There is no escape from yesterday because yesterday has deformed us, or been deformed by us.\"\n\nGallant chronicled the 1968 Paris uprisings initially for herself; the New Yorker realised what her journals contained and persuaded her to publish. Two images stand out as typical and illuminating: of Gallant standing on a traffic island, facing a tide of protesters flowing by on either side, and second, the moment when she realises that a woman professor, \"speaking to me as if I were a plucky child recovering from brain fever in a Russian hospital\", has assumed she is Algerian: \"Brief flash of what it must be like on the receiving end of liberal kindness. The awful sugar.\" She has a hair-trigger sensitivity to racism, to belittling tolerance of refugees, to the ghostly plight of outsiders like herself.\n\nThe notebooks and her account of a French court case in which a teacher, jailed for consorting with a student, committed suicide, resulted in a commission to write a biography of Alfred Dreyfus, a classic casualty of nationalism and racism, which she researched for most of the 70s. She never published, but it prompted some of her best stories, including the Linnet Muir sequence, partly because she allowed herself to write fiction in the mornings, as a treat; partly because she suddenly realised she knew the Montreal of her childhood easily as well as Dreyfus knew Paris, and that it could make a fertile fictional subject; and partly simply because one's 50s \"are a very strong period\".\n\n\"In these Joycean evocations of a mundane, haunting Montreal,\" wrote Ann Hulbert, reviewing the Selected Stories (1996) in the New York Times, \"Mrs Gallant seems to come home imaginatively after a many-hundred-page grand tour.\" It was a more literal homecoming as well. Canadian writing had been undergoing something of a convulsion; when Gallant - and Mordecai Richler, and Weintraub and Margaret Laurence - started out, there had been no writers, no writing culture; they had to leave to make their way. (It helped that, postwar, it was cheaper to live in London than in Montreal.) But suddenly, especially in the universities, there was a move to collect, to construct Canadian literature; everything possible was co-opted, and, says Weintraub, \"literary critics would pay much more attention to second-rate writers who were fiercely Canadian\". There was a kind of negative nationalism about Gallant: she had gone, and stayed gone, so she was a kind of traitor, not properly Canadian. Thirty years and seven books after she began writing, an editor at Macmillan Canada, Douglas Gibson, ended the neglect by publishing two volumes of stories from the 70s: From the Fifteenth District (1979) and Home Truths (1981), a selection of her Canadian stories introduced, slightly defensively, by Gallant, who has never given up her citizenship, keeps up with Canadian friends, the news, the politics, and is particularly proud of Jean Chrétien for resisting the rush to Iraq. Her reception was glowing, and has continued to be so; Home Truths won the Governor General's Award and she received an Order of Canada.\n\nBut home is Paris. \"She has moved into a different dimension with her stories about Paris and especially about [North] Americans in Europe,\" says her friend Richard Howard, a Pulitzer prize-winning American poet who has translated Gide, Camus, De Beauvoir and Barthes, among many others. \"She really is a kind of transatlantic Balzac - both visionary and reportorial.\" Says Hellier: \"I don't think there is any foreigner who knows France as well as she does. Mavis has a third eye and a third ear. She knows French inside and out. She knows the various layers that make French society, whatever makes the French character, if there is such a thing. Her observations will be used years from now, as someone who was a witness to the second part of the 20th century in France.\"\n\n\"And she's lived there long enough,\" adds Howard, \"that for her it's almost like it is for any upper-middle-class Parisian. She has a very closed round. She keeps her eyes open, but she doesn't leave her customary grounds. The French word is casanier. It means sticking to home.\" She likes football, says Gibson, and horse-racing, says Weintraub; and \"she likes the good life\".\n\nInterviewers have often observed how carefully she guards her privacy, alert always to impertinent assumptions, and her friends find the same: \"She's very discreet,\" says Howard - when they first met he asked if she dyed her hair; she didn't speak to him for months - \"she doesn't talk about herself at all.\" Until 1988, when she appeared on a literary TV show called Apostrophe, her French neighbours did not even know she wrote; that night she went to bed anonymous and awoke a star. \"Perhaps it is peculiar for our day and age,\" says Keefer, \"but it is immensely refreshing.\" It is also, perhaps, because the work is what matters. As she once wrote, in an essay called \"What is Style?\", \"literature is no more and nothing less than a matter of life and death\".\n\nMavis Gallant\n\nBorn: August 11 1922.\n\nMarried: 1943-48 John Gallant.\n\nShort story collections: 1956 The Other Paris; '64 My Heart is Broken; '73 The Pegnitz Junction; '74 The End of the World; '79 From the Fifteenth District; '81 Home Truths; '85 Overhead in a Balloon; '88 In Transit; '93 Across the Bridge; '94 The Moslem Wife; '96 The Selected Stories of Mavis Gallant; 2002 Paris Stories (ed Michael Ondaatje); '03 Varieties of Exile (ed Russell Banks).\n\nOther works: Novels: '59 Green Water, Green Sky; '70 A Fairly Good Time; Play: '83 What is to be Done?; Essays: '86 Paris Notebooks: Essays and Reviews.\n\nHonours: Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (UK); 1981 Officer of Order of Canada; '93 Companion of Order of Canada."
