        "text": "FROM romanticized stereotypes of exotic India to the most controversial policies of colonial rule, some of the most enduring images of the British Raj in the popular imagination of Americans have come from films. Some of these films are of average quality and imperfect in their historical accuracy, but many are excellent and effectively recreate the environment and compelling issues that people living in British India faced at different moments in their history. And since films are the media through which much of the general public gain their impressions of British India and other parts of South Asia, they are worthy of consideration by historians for that reason alone.\n\nBelow is a selection of films useful for complementing our study of the history and culture of British India. Most of these films are available on DVD or Blu-Ray at Watzek Library. You can also find many of them on streaming services.\n\nSome information courtesy of Internet Movie Database. Used with permission\n\nGUNGA DIN\n\nDirector: George Stevens, 1939\n\nThis classic film, starring Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks jr, was one of the very first Hollywood depictions of India. Set in the nineteenth century, three British soldiers and a native waterbearer must stop a secret revival of the murderous \"Thuggee\" cult before it can spread across the land. The film is based very loosely on Rudyard Kipling's 1892 ballad of the same name (though it is more like The Three Musketeers) and is interesting for its stereotypes as much as for its story.\n\n© RKO Pictures\n\nTHE DECEIVERS\n\nDirector: Nicholas Meyer, 1988\n\nIn 1825, Lt. William Savage, a reform-minded District Officer in the service of the East India Company, undertakes to rid his district of what the British viewed as the two greatest problems of Indian society: \"Suttee\" (widow immolation) and \"Thuggee\" (a secret cult of robbers and murderers). Savage's actions are eventually thwarted by his profit-minded Company superiors, but not before he attempts to infiltrate the cult and become one of the \"deceivers.\" Based on the 1952 novel by John Masters.\n\n© Warner Home Video\n\nSHATRANJ KE KHILARI | THE CHESS PLAYERS\n\nDirector: Satyajit Ray, 1977\n\nIn 1856, officials of the East India Company move to consolidate their hold over North India by annexing the wealthy kingdom of Awadh. The chief minister to the Nawab attempts to warn his ruler and local landlords of the impending danger but they ignore him and instead indulge their obsession with playing chess. The game becomes a metaphor for the larger game of politics played by the British as they maneuver to capture Awadh's king. Based on the 1924 short story by Premchand.\n\n© Shemaroo\n\nJHANSI KI RANI | THE QUEEN OF JHANSI\n\nDirector: Sohrab Modi, 1952\n\nThis epic film tells the true story of Rani Lakshmi Bai, ruler of the small princely state of Jhansi in central India. The Rani of Jhansi struggled to save her state from British annexation and died in 1857 while personally leading her soldiers into battle. Her heroism, leadership, and sacrifice have been celebrated in folklore and repeatedly invoked by Indian nationalists. This was the first Indian film in Technicolor and one of the first to enjoy distribution in the US under the title The Tiger and the Flame.\n\n© Geneon\n\nTHE RISING: THE BALLAD OF MANGAL PANDEY\n\nDirector: Ketan Mehta, 2005\n\nThis Bollywood epic is the first major film to focus on the 1857 Indian Rebellionor \"Mutiny\" as it is usually referred to in British history. The story follows the rebel leader Mangal Pandey, an Indian sepoy in the service of the East India Company, and his friendship with a British officer. Pandey was a real figure but one about whom little is known. Filming began in 2003 and the opening scene was launched by Charles, Prince of Wales, during an official royal visit to India.\n\n© Yash Raj Films\n\nJUNOON | THE OBSESSION\n\nDirector: Shyam Benegal, 1979\n\nSet during the Uprising of 1857, this film focuses on three women of an Anglo-Indian family who take refuge from the rebels with a local moneylender to whom they have a substantial debt and who, thus, has a vested interest in their survival. When they are discovered, their lives are spared as the rebel leader, Javed, wishes to make the youngest woman, Ruth, his second wife. The plot is further complicated when British forces return seeking vengeance for the mutiny.\n\n© Shemaroo\n\nLOKMANYA: EK YUGPURUSH | A MAN OF THE AGE\n\nDirector: Om Raut, 2015\n\nA Marathi biopic of the fiery nationalist Bal Gangadhar Tilak, lionized as Lokmanya (\"revered by the people\"), who advocated for a confrontational approach to ridding India of its British rulers. Tilak's embrace of Indian culture and rejection of English education made him popular among the Marathi-speaking peasantry of Western India and his writings and speeches gained him a national following while leading to his imprisonment on charges of sedition. Tilak died in 1920, the year that Gandhi's first Non-Cooperation campaign began.\n\n© Essel Vision\n\nCONDUCT UNBECOMING\n\nDirector: Michael Anderson, 1975\n\nThe plot revolves arounds a scandal in a British regiment stationed in India in the 1870s. Lt. Drake is from a middle-class background and is eager to advance himself by making the right impression. Lt. Millington, the son of a general, is not keen on army life and desires to get out as soon as he possibly can. When the widow of the regiment's most honored hero is assaulted, Drake must defend Millington from the charges in an unusual court-martial. Based on the 1969 play by Barry England.\n\n© Crown Films\n\nVICTORIA & ABDUL\n\nDirector: Stephen Frears, 2017\n\nIn 1887, Abdul Karim, a young police clerk from Agra, is selected by the British colonial goverment to travel to London to present a gift to Queen Victoria on the occasion of her Golden Jubilee. Abdul strikes up an unlikely friendship with the \"Empress of India\" and stays on in Britain to become her servant and, at her request, her munshi (teacher) of Urdu and the Qur'an. When Victoria dies in 1901, Abdul returns to India. Based on the book by Shrabani Basu and Abdul's diary discovered in 2010.\n\n© BBC Films\n\nTHE LONG DUEL\n\nDirector: Ken Annakin, 1967\n\nSet in the 1920s, this film is based very loosely on the true exploits of the notorious Bhanta dacoit, Sultana, and the colonial police officer, Freddy Young, whose mission it was to capture him. Sultana (Yul Brynner) and Young (Trevor Howard) develop a strong respect for each other during their game of evasion and pursuit across the hills and plains of North India. However, the portrayal of Sultana as a nationalist rebel and Young as ambivalent toward British imperialism in India is historically inaccurate.\n\n© Rank Organisation\n\nBEFORE THE RAINS\n\nDirector: Santosh Sivan, 2007\n\nSet in 1937 in the Malabar District of the Madras Presidency, this film focuses on an affair between an English spice plantation owner and his Indian housekeeper that ends tragically. The central character is T.K., a servant on the plantation, who discovers the affair and is torn by loyalty to his employer, village politics, and the rising tide of Indian nationalism. Among other things, the film captures well the beauty of the Indian state of Kerala in which it was filmed.\n\n© Lions Gate\n\nTHE RIVER\n\nDirector: Jean Renoir, 1951\n\nThis coming of age story revolves around Harriet, the daughter of an English jute mill owner, who lives in a house on the banks of the Ganges. Harriet's family life and friendships immerse her in a world that blends Indian and western culture. Based on the 1946 novel by Margaret Rumer Godden, The River was the first Technicolor film made in India. Martin Scorsese saw this film as a child and it had a profound effect on his later development as a filmmaker. Satyajit Ray, the great Bengali director, also cited The River as a major influence on his style of filmmaking.\n\n© Criterion\n\nBLACK NARCISSUS\n\nDirectors: Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, 1947\n\nThis strange and haunting film focuses on a group of Anglican nuns who arrive in a remote location in the Himalayas to set up a school and clinic for the local residents. The fragmentation and collapse of their own community force them to abandon the mission. The film was released a few months before Indias independence and some critics speculate that the plot is an allegory about Britains retreat from India. Based on the 1939 novel by Margaret Rumer Godden.\n\n© Criterion\n\nBOSE, THE FORGOTTEN HERO\n\nDirector: Shyam Benegal, 2005\n\nThis film focuses on the final years in the life of Subhas Chandra Bose, one of the most controversial figures in Indian nationalism. A rising star in the freedom movement, Bose fell out with Gandhi and was pushed to the margins of Congress politics. At the outbreak of war in 1939, he fled to Germany and later conspired with Japanese forces to lead an army of Indian soldiers against the British during the Burma campaign. Bose remains a hero to many Indians, especially in his native Bengal.\n\n© Sahara Media\n\nEARTH\n\nDirector: Deepa Mehta, 1998\n\nThe movie opens in the city of Lahore in Punjab in 1947 before India and Pakistan became independent. Lahore is a cosmopolitan city, depicted by a group of working class friends from different religions. The rest of the movie chronicles the fate of this group and the maddening religious conflict that sweeps across Punjab as the partition of the two countries is decided and Lahore is given to Pakistan. Based on the 1988 semi-autobiographical novel The Ice Candy Man by Bapsi Sidhwa.\n\n© New Yorker Films\n\nVICEROY'S HOUSE\n\nDirector: Director: Gurinder Chadha, 2017\n\nThe transfer of power and partition of India and Pakistan told largely through the experiences of the house staff at the stately New Delhi residence of the viceroy following the arrival of Lord and Lady Mountbatten in early 1947. As the clock ticks down to independence, the servants prepare for an uncertain future for themselves and their families. This film was lambasted by historians for the unsupported premise that partition was conceived as a conspiracy by Churchill's wartime government to contain postwar Soviet expansion into the oil-rich Middle East.\n\n© Pathé\n\nPINJAR\n\nDirector: Chandra Prakash Dwivedi, 2003\n\nLajjo is a recently married Hindu woman abducted by Muslims during the chaos of partition and taken to Pakistan. There she is forced to become the second wife of an abusive and controlling alcoholic. Her determined sister-in-law, Puro, sets out to search for her, encouraged by her brother, but cautioned by her parents who would prefer not to lose another child. A compelling story that deals with abduction, a widespread and largely overlooked aspect of partition violence.\n\n© Lucky Star Entertainment\n\nBHOWANI JUNCTION\n\nDirector: George Cukor, 1956\n\nIn the summer of 1947 the British are on the verge of finally leaving India. Among the few sorry to see them leave are the Anglo-Indianshalf British and half Indian. They are going to miss the patronage of their white cousins, the job reservations, and the important status and positions they currently hold. This film revolves around Victoria, an Anglo-Indian woman and her relationships with British, Indian, and Anglo-Indian men. Based on the 1954 novel by John Masters.\n\n© MGM\n\nCOTTON MARY\n\nDirectors: Ismail Merchant and Madhur Jaffrey, 1999\n\nIn 1954, seven years after India has gained independence from Britain, many Indians still feel like second-class citizens in their own country, as the nation's sovereignty has not immediately erased the perception that the British are superior to Indians. An example is Cotton Mary, an Anglo-Indian nurse in the employment of the wife of a BBC correspondent. Mary claims she is the daughter of a British army officer (although she has no firm evidence) and views herself as more British than Indian.\n\n© Universal\n\nSTAYING ON\n\nDirector: Silvio Narizzano, 1979\n\nBased on Paul Scott's Booker Prize-winning novel from 1977, this film tells the story of retired colonel Tusker Smalley and his wife Lucy who made the decision to \"stay on\" in India after the British withdrew in 1947 and as most of their friends returned home. Now retired, Tusker and Lucy are the only remaining British residents in a once-busy hill station. Problems arise when the Indian owner of their bungalow plans to change the one corner of India in which they hoped to preserve their Anglo-Indian life.\n\n© HBO Films\n\nHEAT AND DUST\n\nDirector: James Ivory, 1982\n\nAnne, an Englishwoman, is investigating the life of her great-aunt Olivia whose destiny had always been shrouded with scandal. The search leads back to the early 1920s, when Olivia, recently married, came to live with her civil servant husband in an Indian princely state. Slowly, Anne discovers, upon getting pregnant by an Indian local in the early 1980s, that she and Olivia have more than a little in common. Based on the 1975 novel by Ruth Prawar Jhabvala.\n\n© Home Vision Entertainment"
