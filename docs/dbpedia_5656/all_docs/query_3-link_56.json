Emphasis will be on developing close, attentive reading skills as ways of thinking not just about, but through texts, and on deploying these skills effectively in essays and discussions. The class will draw on literary works from a variety of countries, centuries, genres and media. We recommend that students considering a Specialist, Major or Minor in English take this course.\n\nGroup 1 Literary Theory/Methods\n\nDetailed Description by Instructor:\n\nThe theme of our course is “dreams,” both literal and metaphorical. As Renaissance essayist Sir Thomas Browne observed, nearly one–third of our lives are spent dreaming. Yet the meaning of our dreams—their purpose and relation to our waking lives—remains elusive. Are they prophecies that foretell our future? Enigmatic revelations of our darkest desires? Mere neural responses to environmental stimuli? To what extent do our nightly dreams relate to the aspirational fancies of our daydreams or hopes for the future? Such questions have fascinated and frustrated thinkers from Plato to Sigmund Freud and twenty-first century scientists, whose contributions to the art of dream interpretation (“oneirocriticism”) have illuminated, but never definitively explained, our sleeping visions. This semester, we, too, will delve into the surreal landscapes of dreams and dream analysis as we undertake the critical reading of literature—a medium that is itself frequently compared to dreaming. Over the course of three units, we’ll sharpen our critical reading skills as we analyze dream–related literature from a variety of countries, centuries, genres, and media. In lecture, discussion, and informal and formal writing assignments, we’ll practice strategies like annotation, keyword analysis, and “new formalist” reading that will help you think about and through texts in English classes and beyond.\n\nSelected Major Readings: Samuel Taylor Coleridge, “Kubla Khan”; Lucille Clifton and Langston Hughes’s dream poems; Lorraine Hansberry, A Raisin in the Sun; William Shakespeare, A Midsummer Night’s Dream; Kazuo Ishiguro, Never Let Me Go\n\nFirst Three Texts/Authors to be Studied: John Keats, “The Eve of Saint Agnes,” Lucille Clifton (select dream poems), Mark Turcotte, The Back When Poems\n\nMethod of Instruction: Lecture with tutorials\n\nMethod of Evaluation: Essays and exam\n\nCourse Title: How to Research Literature\n\nCourse Code: ENG102H5S | Lecture MW 11-12 | Tutorials W 12-1, W 4-5\n\nInstructor: Sarah Star\n\nThis foundational course serves as an introduction to conducting research for English courses at the university level. Skills taught will be: reading and engaging with arguments about literature; incorporating the arguments of others into your own; locating and evaluating secondary sources; and conducting primary research. The class will draw on literary works from a variety of countries, centuries, genres and media. The class will normally culminate in a longer research paper, developed over the course of the semester. We recommend that students considering a Specialist, Major or a Minor in English take this course.\n\nGroup n/a\n\nCourse Title: Introduction to World Literatures\n\nCourse Code: ENG105H5F | Lecture TR 11-12 | Tutorials T 12-1, T 4-5\n\nInstructor: Anna Thomas\n\nStudents will learn about contemporary creative writing in English from around the world. The course will cover the work of some famous writers, such as Toni Morrison or J.M. Coetzee, and also new and emerging authors, from Canada to New Zealand to Nigeria.\n\nExclusion: ENG140Y5\n\nGroup n/a\n\nDetailed Description by Instructor:\n\nThis class approaches the category of “world literature” through an introduction to and thinking with anticolonial and postcolonial writing. We will read writers from South Asian, African, and Caribbean contexts, through whom we will examine questions of representation, genre, identification, and power in response to empire and its legacies, scaling from the person to the planet.\n\nSelected Major Readings:\n\nM.K. Gandhi, Aimé Césaire, Chinua Achebe, V.S. Naipaul, Wole Soyinka, Jamaica Kincaid, Jhumpa Lahiri, Amitav Ghosh\n\nFirst Three Texts/Authors to be Studied:\n\nM.K.

We will focus on literary narrative as a particularly rich variety, but our analyses will apply broadly, to narratives found in history, law, politics, and more. As an introductory English course, ENG110 will also focus on student writing and analytical techniques, so that students may begin to master the art of the scholarly essay. By the end of the course, students should be able to construct and present analytical arguments in forms appropriate to literary studies and other humanistic disciplines.\n\nSelected Major Readings: Hemingway, “A Clean, Well-Lighted Place”; James, The Turn of the Screw; Le Guin, “The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas”; Woolf, Mrs. Dalloway.\n\nFirst Three Texts/Authors to be Studied: Hemingway, James, Le Guin\n\nMethod of Instruction: Lecture with Tutorials\n\nMethod of Evaluation: Scaffolded short writing assignments capped by a final paper and final exam.

May include film adaptations and one or more plays in the Theatre Erindale schedule of productions. May include a research performance component. This course is also listed as DRE122H5.\n\nExclusion: ENG125Y1\n\nGroup n/a\n\nDetailed Description by Instructor: Picking up where DRE121 left off, this course is an introduction to selected plays, aesthetic theories, and performance techniques from the nineteenth century to (roughly) the present. We’ll watch theatre artists contend with the dominant philosophical ideas, aesthetic values, and political realities of their time, as they attempt to create artworks capable of responding to—or even creating—a modern world. While doing so, they transformed the molecular structure of theatre, pulling apart traditional ways of understanding narrative, illusion, and character—destroying the old, to make way for the new.\n\nSelected Major Readings: A range of modern and contemporary plays, manifestos, and contextual materials.\n\nFirst Three Texts/Authors to be Studied: Ibsen, A Doll’s House; others TBA\n\nMethod of Instruction: Lecture, class discussion, discussion-based tutorials.\n\nMethod of Evaluation: Final exam, short papers, creative project, class and tutorial participation.\n\nSecond-Year Courses\n\nFall Term\n\nENG202H5F British Literature in the World I: Medieval to Eighteenth-Century\n\nENG204H5F How to Read Poetry\n\nENG214H5F The Short Story Cycle\n\nENG218H5F Interactive Storytelling & Worldmaking\n\nENG237H5F Science Fiction\n\nENG238H5F Fantasy Literature\n\nENG251H5F Introduction to American Literature\n\nENG255H5F Introduction to Canadian Literature\n\nENG273H5F Literatures of Immigration and Exile\n\nENG274H5F Indigenous Literatures\n\nENG280H5F Critical Approaches to Literature\n\nENG289H5F Creative Writing\n\nWinter Term\n\nENG203H5S British Literature in the World II: Romantic to Contemporary\n\nENG206H5S Rhetorical Criticism\n\nENG211H5S Introduction to the Novel\n\nENG215H5S The Canadian Short Story\n\nENG223H5S Introduction to Shakespeare\n\nENG235H5S Comics and the Graphic Novel\n\nENG236H5S Detective Fiction\n\nENG239H5S Horror Literature\n\nENG261H5S Music and Literature\n\nENG263H5S Play and Games\n\nENG275H5S Feminist Approaches to Literature\n\nENG291H5S Reading for Creative Writing\n\nCourse Title: British Literature in the World I: Medieval to Eighteenth-Century\n\nCourse Code: ENG202H5F | Lecture MW 10-11 | Tutorials W 4-5, W 6-7\n\nInstructor: Liza Blake\n\nThis course serves as an introduction to influential texts that have shaped British literary history from Beowulf and Chaucer to Shakespeare, from Milton and Behn to Burney.

See the guidelines for written petitions on the department website.\n\nGroup n/a\n\nDetailed Description by Instructor:\n\nWhat is a world, and what does it mean for something like “British” literature to be “in” it? This course, a foundational course for the English major, offers an introduction to the major authors of almost nine centuries of British and English literature. We will see how something like “British” or “English” literature emerges out of the slow historical colonizations and recolonizations of the British Isles. But we will also see how the literature coming out of these isles imagines and describes other worlds within and without itself. We will focus especially on texts that imagine travel to other words (lands of faerie; distant lands occupied by monsters; utopias that imagine better societies; the New World of the Americas; other planets ruled by women scientists), and will think about how different genres (medieval theater, metaphysical poetry, sci-fi novels) project both author and reader beyond the worlds they typically inhabit.\n\nThroughout the course, we will also question what it means to read literary texts as part of a broad historical survey, considering especially how our modern understandings of the nature of history might warp our perceptions of the past. As a result, we will not only consider the “origins” of British literature but also question what it means to have an origin at all. We will embed the literary works we read in their historical contexts, but also consider the way each presents its own understanding of history, examining in particular the ways that literary texts situate themselves in times and places.\n\nSelected Major Readings:\n\nExeter Book Riddles; Marie de France’s lais; The Travels of Sir John Mandeville; Sir Orfeo; Geoffrey Chaucer, Canterbury Tales; The Second Shepherd’s Play; The Book of Margery Kempe; Thomas More, Utopia; Thomas Hariott, Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia; Margaret Cavendish, Blazing World; Aphra Behn, Oroonoko; Olaudah Equiano, Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano; romantic, erotic, political, and metaphysical poetry by Thomas Wyatt, Queen Elizabeth I, Mary Sidney Herbert, Philip Sidney, Mary Wroth, William Shakespeare, John Donne, George Herbert, Margaret Cavendish, Hester Pulter, Thomas Traherne, Phillis Wheatley, and more.\n\nFirst Three Texts/Authors to be Studied:\n\nJorge Luis Borges, “Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote”; (from) Bede, Ecclesiastical History of the English People; (from) Geoffrey of Monmouth, History of the Kings of Britain\n\nMethod of Instruction: Twice-weekly interactive lectures and once-weekly tutorials tutorials\n\nMethod of Evaluation: Creative and analytical writing assignments; take-home quizzes; participation in discussion-oriented tutorials\n\nCourse Title: British Literature in the World II: Romantic to Contemporary\n\nCourse Code: ENG203H5S | Lecture TR 10-11 | Tutorials T 11-12, T 1-2\n\nInstructor: Chris Koenig-Woodyard\n\nAn introduction to influential texts that have shaped British literary history from the Romantic period to the present, covering developments in poetry, drama and prose, from William Wordsworth to Zadie Smith and beyond. The course will address topics such as revolution and war; the increasing diversity of poetic forms; the cultural dominance of the novel; romanticism, Victorianism, modernism and postmodernism; feminism; colonialism and decolonization; the ethnic and cultural diversity of Anglophone literature in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries; literature and sexual identity; the AIDS epidemic; and technology and the digital age. The course will encourage students to think about the study of English literatures in relationship to history, including the history of world literatures.\n\nExclusion: ENG203Y5\n\nPrerequisite: Open to students who have successfully completed at least 4.0 full credits.\n\nStudents who do not meet the prerequisite but are enrolled in any 100-level ENG or DRE course (except ENG100H5) may petition the department in writing for approval to take the course.

Over the past twenty years, artists and writers in this medium have departed from its traditional subject matter to create graphic autobiographies, journalism, political analyses, philosophical arguments and histories, as well as revisiting, critiquing and reinventing such familiar subjects as magic, science fiction and the superhero. This course will examine the range of the current graphic novel, focusing on the medium’s rhetoric, narration and socio-political range.\n\nSelected Major Readings: We will be reading such literary graphic texts as Seth’s It’s a Good Life, If You Don’t Weaken; Meags Fitzgerald's Photobooth, and Emil Ferris’s My Favorite Thing is Monsters, as well as some mainstream comics such as Grant Morrison’s Animal Man.

Our course will explore how this genre offers alternative perspectives on the existing social order, envisions the consequences of environmental degradation, revises the norms of individual and communal identity, and re-conceptualizes categories of race and gender. Challenging readers’ expectations about the meaning of history, community, and identity, the assigned texts propose radically different, yet strangely familiar, visions of our world. What alternative social environments will we find in these readings and how will they affect our relationship to the world we actually live in?\n\nSelected Major Readings:\n\nFredric Brown “Knock”; Douglas Adams Hitchhikers Guide Through the Galaxy; Philip K.

As it explores the magical and supernatural, it may consider such genres as alternative histories, animal fantasy, epic, fairy tales, magic realism and swords and sorcery. Authors and texts covered will survey the history of fantasy across American, British and Canadian literature, and may include Beowulf, Butler, Carroll, Gaiman, Le Guin, Lewis, Martin, Ovid, Rowling, Shakespeare, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Swift and Tolkien.\n\nPrerequisite: Open to students who have successfully completed at least 4.0 full credits.\n\nStudents who do not meet the prerequisite but are enrolled in any 100-level ENG or DRE course (except ENG100H5) may petition the department in writing for approval to take the course. See the guidelines for written petitions on the department website.\n\nGroup n/a\n\nDetailed Description by Instructor: Fantasy literature is, as Brian Attebery puts it, the literature of making the oldest stories say new things. Or, to look at it from Seo-Young Chu’s perspective, it is the art of making literary techniques themselves into the story. These two critical perspectives will begin our reading of fantasy fiction, which will range from early modern fairy and folk tales through some classics of 19th and 20th-century literary fantasy, to contemporary tales of the fantastic in modern settings. Along the way, we will focus on how fantasy transforms the concrete realities of place, space, and everyday life into something unfamiliar, and how readers experience and interact with its complex rhetorical modes. We will also consider fantasy as a popular and cultural phenomenon, asking why it has become so important to so many people in our modern, technological, apparently disenchanted age.\n\nSelected Major Readings: We will read a number of fantasies old and new, including fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen, Tolkien’s The Hobbit, LeGuin’s The Tombs of Atuan, and Clarke’s Piranesi, as well as locally-situated texts such as Bobet’s Above and Hopkinson’s Brown Girl in the Ring.\n\nFirst Three Texts/Authors to be Studied: Andersen, Tolkien, LeGuin\n\nMethod of Instruction: Lecture/discussion.

Inequalities and systemic racism surface again and again as America constantly reassesses its present in relation to its past. While protests have taken on new urgency recently, protest itself is not new. Since the beginnings of the U.S. as a nation, writers have used various genres to point to the limitations of practices of freedom and equality in the U.S. In this course we will examine examples of these writings, from Phillis Wheatley’s late 18th-century poems to Claudia Rankine’s 21st-century prose poem. Along the way we’ll think about how the experiment of the United States is constantly being revised and critiqued. As we investigate forms of protest, some overt and radical and others rather quiet, we’ll carefully close read texts to think about how authors position their readers to raise political and ethical questions. At the same time, we’ll develop a sense of major literary periods and movements that will provide a groundwork for future study of American literature.\n\nSelected Major Readings:\n\nPhillis Wheatley poems\n\nHannah Foster, The Coquette\n\nDavid Walker’s Appeal\n\nHerman Melville, Benito Cereno\n\nCharles Chesnutt short stories\n\nClaudia Rankine, Citizen: An American Lyric\n\nFirst Three Texts/Authors to be Studied:\n\nLemuel Haynes, “Liberty Further Extended: Or Free Thoughts on the Illegality of Slave-keeping”\n\nPhillis Wheatley poems\n\nHannah Foster, The Coquette\n\nMethod of Instruction:\n\nlecture and discussion\n\nMethod of Evaluation:\n\nonline discussion forum, short writing assignments, essays (4-6 pages), active participation.\n\nCourse Title: Introduction to Canadian Literature\n\nCourse Code: ENG255H5F | Lecture T 9-11, R 10-11\n\nInstructor: Sarah Star\n\nThis course introduces students to Canadian literatures, from the oral narratives of Canada's early Indigenous communities to new writing in a digital age.\n\nExclusion: ENG252Y5\n\nPrerequisite: Open to students who have successfully completed at least 4.0 full credits.\n\nStudents who do not meet the prerequisite but are enrolled in any 100 level ENG or DRE course (except ENG100H5) may petition the department in writing for approval to take the course. See the guidelines for written petitions on the department website.\n\nGroup 5 Canadian Literature\n\nDetailed Description by Instructor: Canadian writers grapple with ideas about the relationship between space (geographical, cultural, imagined) and identity in a variety of ways and from a wide range of perspectives. In our course, we will analyze ideas about home, loss, belonging, citizenship, immigration, colonization, landscape, space, and identity that characterize Canadian literature. We will ask, for example, to what extent is “national identity” stable? What makes a text “transnational”? How do Canadian writers use landscape and space to think through issues of identity? We will analyze the complexities and pluralities of cultural identities in Canada, and in doing so we will uncover more nuanced and accurate truths about Canadian Literature.\n\nSelected Major Readings: Thomas King, Green Grass, Running Water; David Chariandy, Brother; Dionne Brand, thirsty\n\nFirst Three Texts/Authors to be Studied: Lee Maracle, “Goodbye Snauq”; Alice Munro, “Dear Life”; Souvankham Thammavongsa, “How to Pronounce Knife”\n\nMethod of Instruction: Lecture and Class Discussion\n\nMethod of Evaluation:\n\nPresentations (20%)\n\nBook Review or Short Story Response (20%)\n\nPoetry Paper (20%)\n\nFinal Paper or Podcast (25%)\n\nParticipation (15%)\n\nCourse Title: Music and Literature\n\nCourse Code: ENG261H5S | Lecture M 2-3, W 1-3\n\nInstructor: Brent Wood\n\nThis course introduces students to the intersection of music and literature. We will study how melody, rhythm and texture interact with language, story and performance using examples from folk ballads and blues, art-songs, popular songs, musical theatre, jazz and hiphop, as well as poems inspired by musical styles and performers. Works to be covered may include folksongs collected by Francis Child and Alan Lomax, Thomas Moore’s Irish Melodies, popular songs by Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen and Joni Mitchell, theatrical works by Bertolt Brecht, Stephen Sondheim and Lin-Manuel Miranda, performances by The Last Poets, hiphop lyrics by Public Enemy, and poems by William Blake, William Wordsworth, Emily Dickinson, Langston Hughes and Don McKay.\n\nPrerequisite: Open to students who have successfully completed at least 4.0 full credits.\n\nGroup n/a\n\nCourse Title: Play and Games\n\nCourse Code: ENG263H5S | Lecture MW 3-4 | TUT F10-11, F12-1\n\nInstructor: Lawrence Switzky\n\nWhy do we play? Game designers, authors, philosophers, and sociologists have long claimed that play can tell us about our development as children and adults, our search for freedom, why we enjoy art, our relationship to animals, and our pursuit of social justice. This course introduces students to Play Studies and Game Studies from. Humanistic perspective by considering the reasons we play in relationship to the objects we play with, including things that are more normally thought of as games—card and board games, sports, toys, video games—as well as other sites of playful thought and action, like paintings, films, fashion, and short stories. Students in this course will play and design story-rich games and will discuss effective narrative design across a wide variety of tabletop and digital games. Students will also consider problems in play and games like cheating, addiction, and gamification.\n\nPrerequisites: Open to students who have successfully completed a minimum of 4.0 credits.

See the guidelines for written petitions on the department website.\n\nGroup 1 Literary Theory/Methods\n\nDetailed Description by Instructor:\n\nThis course will begin with the question of what constitutes a \"feminist approach\" by examining how positionality and perspective have been pursued in many feminist theories. The scale, methodology, and constituency of the \"approach\" can range from the individual to the institutional; the communal to the political; the local to the transnational; from solidarity to critique. Together the class will build a vocabulary for analyzing the emphases and omissions of the feminist literary tradition, ending with a particular emphasis on Black Feminism.\n\nSelected Major Readings: Selections from A Room of One’s Own, Gertrude Stein, Simone de Beauvoir, bell hooks, June Jordan.\n\nFirst Three Texts/Authors to be Studied: Saidiya Hartman, Mary Wollstonecraft, Phillis Wheatley\n\nMethod of Instruction: Lectures and discussion\n\nMethod of Evaluation: short written assignments, essays, exam\n\nCourse Title: Critical Approaches to Literature\n\nCourse Code: ENG280H5F | Lecture M 11-1 | Tutorials M 1-2, M 3-4, M 5-6\n\nInstructor: Daniel Wright\n\nAn introduction to literary theory and its central questions, such as the notion of literature itself, the relation between literature and reality, the nature of literary language, the making of literary canons and the roles of the author and the reader.\n\nExclusion: ENG267H5\n\nPrerequisite: Open to students who have successfully completed at least 4.0 full credits.\n\nStudents who do not meet the prerequisite but are enrolled in any 100-level ENG or DRE course (except ENG100H5) may petition the department in writing for approval to take the course. See the guidelines for written petitions on the department website.\n\nGroup n/a\n\nDetailed Description by Instructor:\n\nWhat does it mean to adopt a “critical approach” to literature, and why it is any better than just reading and interpreting? This question has long animated debates over the role of “theory” (a variety of ways of thinking philosophically about the nature of literature, literary language, form, meaning, and interpretation) in the study and interpretation of literature in universities. In a recent essay, Kinohi Nishikawa describes how the rise of theory in literature departments in the 1980’s led to an urgent debate, for example, among scholars of African-American literature, some of whom thought that theory helped them to emphasize the “formal complexity and aesthetic autonomy” of Black literature, and others of whom thought theory “could not help but evoke a Eurocentric bias, and thus had limited analytical value for studying the black experience, including its literature and culture.”\n\nIn this course, we’ll survey a variety of theoretical schools and movements, from formalism to deconstruction to historicism to queer theory, with our survey introduced and framed by this debate among scholars of African-American literature over the nature and usefulness of theory as well as its emphasis on a white European philosophical history. Framing the survey in this way will help us to think throughout the course about theory’s consequences for how we read and for what we read. As Toni Morrison argued in her Nobel Prize lecture of 1993, a writer “thinks of language partly as a system, partly as a living thing over which one has control, but mostly as an agency—as an act with consequences.” If we adopt any given critical approach, what are the consequences of that act? What effect does that approach have? What does it do to the language we use and read and interpret as writers, readers, and scholars?\n\nSelected Major Readings:\n\nSubject to change, but likely to include many of the following: Henry Louis Gates, Barbara Christian, bell hooks, Cleanth Brooks, Angela Leighton, Caroline Levine, Jacques Derrida, Barbara Johnson, Michel Foucault, Catherine Gallagher, Stephen Greenblatt, Karl Marx, Sianne Ngai, Sigmund Freud, Leo Bersani, Cathy Caruth, Mary Wollstonecraft, Virginia Woolf, Hélène Cixous, Judith Butler, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, José Esteban Muñoz, C.

From Rabindranath Tagore’s mystical poetry to Slumdog Millionaire, the styles and aesthetics of South Asian English are as vast as the peninsula itself, and the literature that has emerged from this diverse region has utterly reshaped contemporary global culture. Additionally, we will take up select contemporary criticism on subaltern studies, postcolonialism, and narratology. Authors will include Anand, Naipaul, Narayan, Suleri, Rushdie, Roy, Lahiri, as well as select works of poetry, film, and visual art.\n\nPrerequisites: 1.0 credit in ENG and 3 additional credits\n\nGroup 2 Race, Ethnicity, Diaspora, Indigeneity\n\nCourse Title: Medieval Literature\n\nCourse Code: ENG311H5F | MWF 2-3\n\nInstructor: Chester Scoville\n\nThis course explores a selection of writings in from medieval Britain, excluding the works of Chaucer.\n\nPrerequisites: 1.0 credit in ENG and 3.0 additional credits.\n\nGroup 3 Literature pre-1700\n\nDetailed Description by Instructor:\n\nThe literature of the late Middle Ages is a rich field, whose best works speak across the centuries. Stories of honour, loss, isolation, friendship, hope, tragedy – all familiar human experiences come to us in medieval literature, yet framed in a series of assumptions that are not those of our modern world. Understanding how people with a very different view of the world asked and answered vital questions can help us understand our own experiences and reframe our understanding of them; the literature of the Middle Ages, though powerful in its own right, speaks to us vitally today. This course will constitute an in-depth critical selection of Middle English literature, focusing first on aspects of the language and some short textual examples, and then moving to analysis of three major texts of the 14th and 15th centuries. Previous knowledge of Middle English (such as a Chaucer course) is recommended but not required.\n\nSelected Major Readings: We will consider a number of short poems and selections of longer ones, in Fulk’s textbook and anthology An Introduction to Middle English. This book will also serve as a reference guide to the language itself. We will then work in-depth with three major late-medieval texts: Pearl: Text and Translation, ed. Beal; Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, ed. Winny; and Malory, Le Morte DArthur: Selections, ed. Okrun.\n\nFirst Three Texts/Authors to Be Studied: Fulk, Pearl, Sir Gawain.\n\nMethod of Instruction: Lecture/discussion. Although group work will not be a marked component of the course, it will be an integral part of classroom discussion.\n\nMethod of Evaluation: There will be several short writing assignments, leading up to a substantial final essay; participation on discussion boards will also be marked.\n\nCourse Title: Margaret Cavendish’s Drama: Performing the Unperformable\n\nCourse Code: ENG313H5S | Lecture M 3-5, W 4-5\n\nInstructor: Liza Blake\n\nA concentrated study of one aspect of early modern British literature or literary culture, such as a particular subgenre or author, specific theme, or the application of a particular critical approach. Topics may vary from year to year.\n\nPrerequisites: 1.0 credit in ENG and 3.0 additional credits.\n\nGroup 3 Literature pre-1700\n\nDetailed Description by Instructor:\n\nThis class will offer an intensive study of the plays of Margaret Cavendish, with a goal to reimagining them for modern theatrical productions. We will read canonical plays like her Convent of Pleasure and Bell in Campo, as well as her more experimental drama, such as her play The Presence, for which she wrote optional bonus “Scenes” to be inserted, or The Comical Hash, which is a collection of scenes that seemingly refuse to cohere into any plot. Readings will also include her dramatic criticism (e.g., of Shakespeare) from her volume Sociable Letters, descriptions of the theater from her novel Blazing World, and selections from her philosophical works to help understand some of the theories of Nature, gender, and movement underlying her drama. Though none of her plays were ever publicly performed during her lifetime, we will constantly imagine what it would mean to realize them on a modern stage.\n\nSelected Major Readings: Selected plays from Margaret Cavendish’s two volumes of plays, likely including at least Convent of Pleasure, Bell in Campo, The Presence, and The Comical Hash.\n\nFirst Three Texts/Authors to be Studied: We will begin by reading the several letters “To the Reader” Cavendish writes about her own drama at the front of her first collection of plays.\n\nMethod of Instruction: Interactive (discussion-based) lectures\n\nMethod of Evaluation: Creative and analytical writing assignments; take-home “quizzes”; scene performance(s); editorial experiment\n\nCourse Title: Special Topic in Modern and Contemporary Literature (Dungeons & Dragons & Roleplaying)\n\nCourse Code: ENG316H5F | Lecture W 1-2, F 1-3\n\nInstructor: Chris Koenig-Woodyard\n\nA concentrated study of one aspect of modern or contemporary literature or literary culture, such as a particular subgenre or author, specific theme, or the application of a particular critical approach.

A form of immersive entertainment that requires players to co-create the game, in this course we will study RPGs by playing games. In this course, we will critically investigate (and immerse ourselves) in the dynamics of how players actively make, improvise, and author the narrative of RPGs broadly and Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) in particular.\n\nThis is, in part, a hands-on and experiential course: we will play D&D in small breakout groups as we discuss the history, theory, and design of RPGs. In doing so, we will balance theory and practice, exploring games studies and theories of play, gaming, and role-playing as we examine the literary, gaming, and cultural influences that shaped D&D. RPGs and D&D thus become vehicles for framing discussions about race, gender, politics, ideology, culture, game theory and design, and about the vital social impact that games play in shaping humanity.\n\nEng 316 is one of three Game Studies courses that we are offering in the Department of English and Drama, with an eye to launching a Game Studies minor in September 2023.\n\nCourse Texts:\n\n1] D&D [Dungeons and Dragons] Essentials Kit ISBN 978-0-7869-6683-7 ~ UT Bookstore: https://www.uoftbookstore.com/adoption-search-results?ccid=24567&itemid=75904 ~ Amazon: https://www.amazon.ca/Dungeons-Dragons-Essentials-Kit-Boxed/dp/0786966831]\n\n2] All other course material will be posted top Quercus, under Modules\n\nMethod of Instruction: Lecture and Discussion; Game Play\n\nMethod of Evaluation: Written Assignments; Informed Course Contribution\n\nWebsite: Quercus\n\nCourse Title: Austen and Her Contemporaries\n\nCourse Code: ENG323H5F | Lecture T 11-1, R 11-12\n\nInstructor: Chris Koenig-Woodyard\n\nA study of selected novels by Austen and of works by such contemporaries as Radcliffe, Godwin, Wollstonecraft, Wordsworth, Edgeworth, Scott and Shelley, in the context of the complex literary, social and political relationships of that time.\n\nPrerequisite: 1.0 credit in ENG and 3.0 additional credits\n\nGroup 4 Literature 1700-1900\n\nDetailed Description by Instructor: A study of selected novels (and fiction) by Austen and her contemporaries as Lewis, Radcliffe, Godwin, Wollstonecraft, Wordsworth, Edgeworth, Scott, and Shelley, in the context of the complex literary, social, and political relationships of that time.\n\nRequired Reading: All editions are published by Broadview, and we will use the introductions and appendixes of these books.

Attention is given to social, political and theatrical contexts.\n\nPrerequisite: 1.0 credit in ENG and 3.0 additional credits\n\nGroup 3 Literature pre-1700\n\nDetailed Description by Instructor:\n\nIn the beginning of the York play The Fall of the Angels, God steps forward and declares his power and his timelessness: “I am maker unmade, all mighte es in Me[!]” The appearance of a self-confident and enthusiastic supernatural character was not unusual in medieval drama, which afforded a number of opportunities for the everyday world of medieval England to open into other worlds. Metrically adventurous, theatrically complicated, gleefully metatheatrical, and socially critical, medieval drama in all its forms explores the aesthetic, philosophical, religious, social, and satirical possibilities of theater. This course will serve as an introduction to medieval drama in all its variety, including Biblical plays, conversion plays, moral plays, and interludes. The course will focus especially on medieval dramatic texts in performance, including both their original performance conditions and modern performance possibilities.\n\nSelected Major Readings: Biblical Drama (Fall of Angels, Fall of Man, Noah Plays, Crucifixion, etc.); Conversion Plays (Conversion of St. Paul, Croxton Play of the Sacrament); and Interludes (Everyman; Fulgens and Lucres; Nature; Magnyfycence). No deep familiarity with the Christian Bible presumed or needed.\n\nFirst Three Texts/Authors to be Studied: Biblical drama from York, Chester, and N-Town\n\nMethod of Instruction: Interactive (discussion-based) lectures\n\nMethod of Evaluation: creative and critical writing assignments; take-home “quizzes”; collaborative scene performance assignment\n\nCourse Title: Early Modern Women Writers\n\nCourse Code: ENG339H5F | Lecture T 1-3, R 2-3\n\nInstructor: Marshelle Woodward\n\nA study of poems, plays, prose fiction, and polemical works by medieval and early modern writers such as Anne Askew, Mary Wroth, Queen Elizabeth I, Mary Sidney, Amelia Lanyer, Lucy Hutchinson, Hester Pulter, and Margaret Cavendish.

Derived from the Latin auctor, a masculine noun connoting mastery, gravity, leadership, and written expertise, authority as a concept closely associated with masculine rule has presented a stumbling block to women’s speech from antiquity to the present day. Whether Chaucer’s Wife of Bath claiming “Experience, though noon auctoritee” to legitimize her discourse on marriage or 21st-century female politicians walking a tightrope between “strength” and “stridency” in public perception, women who wish to command an audience are often forced to expend considerable energy defending their right to speak and be heard. This term, we will examine the manifold rhetorical strategies early modern English and colonial North American women used to assert authority at a time when women’s political, economic, and cultural status was in flux: from ironic use of the commonplace humility topos (similar to today’s “humblebrag”), to the co-optation of male relatives’ patriarchal authority, claims to “crip authority,” and racist appeals to whiteness as a legitimizing force. We will ask how women’s rhetorical strategies shifted as they moved between discursive spheres, writing authoritatively not only within the feminine purview of “huswifery,” but also the conventionally masculine realm of politics and the contested domains of religion, philosophy, and science. Finally, we will question why early modern women who attained considerable authority in their own lifetimes were often robbed of it by later generations in a process of selective forgetting recurrent throughout women’s history.\n\nUnderlying all our inquiries will be the urgent consideration of what sixteenth- and seventeenth-century women have to teach us today about the fight for gender justice in a patriarchal world—one in which forces of progress and reaction are locked in a consequential battle for dominance. To this end, our readings will place early women writers like Queen Elizabeth I, Anne Bradstreet, Margaret Cavendish, and Phillis Wheatley in dialogue with modern feminist thinkers such as Audre Lorde, Judith Butler, Tressie McMillan Cottom, Kate Manne, and Ruby Hamad.\n\nSelected Major Readings: Anne Askew, The Examinations of Anne Askew; Anne Hutchinson, “The Examination of Mrs. Anne Hutchinson”; Queen Elizabeth I, “Response to Parliament’s Request she Marry, 1559” and other speeches; Professor Tracy Bear, Indigenous Women in Indigenous Societies and European travel narratives feat.

Topics may include traditional forms (Kathakali dance, Noh and Kabuki, Beijing Opera, Nigerian masquerades) adapted for the modern stage; agit-prop and political drama; object performance; the place of drama within a global media ecology; and drama as a site of intercultural and transcultural appropriation, negotiation, and exchange.\n\nPrerequisites: 1.0 credit in ENG and 3.0 additional credits.\n\nGroup 2 Race, Ethnicity, Diaspora, Indigeneity\n\nCourse Title: The Nineteenth-Century American Novel\n\nCourse Code: ENG347H5S | Lecture M 9-11, W 10-11\n\nInstructor: Melissa Gniadek\n\nThis course will introduce students to historical and cultural concerns of nineteenth-century America through major subgenres of the novel, including the gothic, the sentimental, realism, and naturalism. Emphasis will be on shifts in the novel across the century as well as the relationship of the nineteenth-century novel to print culture, including serial publication in literary magazines and newspapers. We may also think about how non-fiction texts from this period draw on the conventions of fiction. Authors studied may include Charles Brockden Brown, Fanny Fern, George Lippard, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Charles Chesnutt, Mark Twain, Edith Wharton, and Pauline Hopkins.\n\nPrerequisites: 1.0 credit in ENG and 3.0 additional credits\n\nGroup 6 American Literature\n\nDetailed Description by Instructor:\n\nWhat forms did the novel take in nineteenth-century America? How did non-fictional texts intersect with evolving novelistic sub-genres and narrative expectations? In this course we’ll think about how traditions of the Gothic, the domestic, the sentimental and the sensational were deployed in novels of this period. And we’ll think about how issues of race, histories of enslavement, and the violence of settler colonialism shaped this literary and cultural production. Over the course of the semester we’ll focus on five novels, but we’ll also read some shorter texts that will help to provide context for these novels. The authors that we’ll read will include Charles Brockden Brown, William Apess, Fanny Fern, Harriet Jacobs, Charles Chesnutt and Edith Wharton.\n\nThis course will provide a foundation in 19th-century American literature and history as it encourages students to think about the form of the novel across periods and nations.\n\nSelected Major Readings:\n\nCharles Brockden Brown, Edgar Huntly (1799)\n\nWilliam Apess, “An Indian's Looking-Glass for the White Man” (1833)\n\nFanny Fern, Ruth Hall (1854)\n\nHarriet Jacobs, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (1861)\n\nHenry James, Daisy Miller (1878)\n\nCharles Chesnutt, The Marrow of Tradition (1901)\n\nEdith Wharton, The House of Mirth (1905)\n\nFirst Three Texts/Authors to be Studied:\n\nCharles Brockden Brown, Edgar Huntly (1799) William Apess, “An Indian's Looking-Glass for the White Man” (1833) Fanny Fern, Ruth Hall (1854)\n\nMethod of Instruction:\n\nLecture and discussion\n\nMethod of Evaluation:\n\nonline discussion forum, short writing assignments, essays, active participation\n\nCourseTitle: Contemporary Poetry\n\nCourse Course: ENG349H5F | Lecture T 1-3, R 1-2\n\nInstructor: Avery Slater\n\nThis course examines works by a variety of contemporary poets, focusing on how their writing participates in contemporary dialogues about art, society, and the larger world.\n\nPrerequisites: 1.0 credit in ENG and 3.0 additional credits.\n\nGroup na\n\nDetailed Description by Instructor:\n\nThis course will explore ecologically concerned poetry from the twentieth- and twenty-first century in a global context. We will focus on poetry’s attempts to create and use language in ways that enable surprising and innovative ecological modes of relation: between human and nonhuman beings, living and nonliving worlds, science and art, history and imagination. No prior knowledge of poetry is required, and students from all disciplinary backgrounds are very welcome. While all readings for the course will be in English, many materials will be presented in English translation alongside the work’s original language. In doing so, we will consider the ecological valences of translation—in the domain of world literature as well as in the “translations” of life-worlds, bodies, and habitats.\n\nSelected Major Readings:\n\nselections distributed by pdf from:\n\nIslands, Kamau Brathwaite\n\nEducation by Stone, João Cabral de Melo Neto\n\nThrowing Fire at the Sun, Water at the Moon, Anita Endrezze\n\nThe Wild Iris, Louise Glück\n\nCommons, Myung-Mi Kim\n\nThe Rain in the Trees, W.

You might not think about the Americas, but these same decades saw increasing European contact with lands across the Atlantic and various forms of textual, visual, and cultural engagements with these spaces. For example, the Jamestown settlement was established in the English colony of Virginia in 1607. Governor John Winthrop famously brought a group of Puritans to Massachusetts Bay in 1630. Such events produced various types of writing that established the early American literary traditions that we will explore in this course, even as we will emphasize indigenous traditions that existed in the Americas before European “contact” and that continue through the present.\n\nIn Early American Literature we will approach the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries with a focus on the geographies that would become the United States, though we will also acknowledge the contingency of borders and boundaries in this pre-national period of settler colonial violence. We will consider literature emerging from a range of contexts, from journeys of exploration and conquest to the extra-legal world of piracy to the religious world of New England Puritans. We will read a variety of genres, including captivity narratives, poetry, autobiography, journals, sermons, and even one of the seduction novels that was popular in the years following the American Revolution. We will work to develop a sense of some of the earliest literatures emerging from what is now the U.S. And we will think about how many of these narratives are still with us, in different ways, today.\n\nSelected Major Readings:\n\nAnne Bradstreet, poems\n\nMary Rowlandson, A Narrative of the Captivity and Restauration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson Unca Eliza Winkfield (pseudonym), The Female American\n\nPhillis Wheatley, poems\n\nFirst Three Texts/Authors to be Studied:\n\nIndigenous oral traditions; Selections from Cabeza de Vaca’s Relación; John Smith, from The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles\n\nMethod of Instruction:\n\nLecture and discussion\n\nMethod of Evaluation:\n\nonline discussion forum, short writing assignments, essays, active participation\n\nCourse Title: Special Topic in American Literature (African American Literature)\n\nCourse Code: ENG367H5S | Lecture T 1-3, R 2-3\n\nInstructor: Anna Thomas\n\nA concentrated study of one aspect of American literature or literary culture, such as a particular subgenre, author, period or theme, or the application of a particular critical approach.\n\nPrerequisite: 2.0 credit in ENG, including ENG250Y5, and 4.0 additional credits\n\nGroup 2 Race, Ethnicity, Diaspora, Indigeneity\n\nGroup 6 American Literature\n\nDetailed Description by Instructor:\n\nThis class is an advanced introduction to the field of African American literary studies, tracing its origins and emergence through the slave trade to the present day, with particular focus on 19th- and 20th-century writing, and the criticism and theory to which it gives rise.

These theories were investigating new forms of “invisible wounds” caused by human exposure to technological shock: railway accidents, urban industrialization, and the mechanized horrors of trench warfare. From these early explorations of the problem of technological “shock,” new aspects of the human mind were opened for research—the unconscious, the status of human memory, psychological alternatives to instinct, and, most challenging of all, a new concept that Sigmund Freud first named “the death drive.”\n\nLeaving imprints not only on psychology but on literature, philosophy, political theory, sociology, and historiography, the legacies of trauma theory will form this course’s intellectual focus. Keeping in mind the profound breadth of influence that trauma theory has had on so many fields and sciences, we will focus on trauma's interplay with literary works from the global twentieth- and twenty-first century. Because theories of trauma seriously challenge existing ideas of human knowledge and expression, its appearance within the artistic realm raises complex questions. How can trauma theory serve to help us understand wider histories of harm and violence on global, collective scales?\n\nThis course will give students an introduction to key theoretical texts and shifts in trauma theory from its origins to the present day. Students will also investigate how these theories interact with literary texts’ historically specific confrontation with modernity.\n\nSelected Major Readings:\n\nBeyond the Pleasure Principle, Sigmund Freud Broadview, 9781551119946\n\nThe Return of the Soldier, Rebecca West Penguin, 9780141180656\n\nThe Reawakening, Primo Levi Touchstone, 9780684826356\n\nDien Cai Dau, Yusef Komunyakaa Wesleyan, 9780819511645\n\nCeremony, Leslie Marmon Silko Penguin, 9780143104919\n\nThe Dew Breaker, Edwidge Danticat Vintage, 9781400034291\n\nFirst Three Texts/Authors to be Studied:\n\n· Sigmund Freud Beyond the Pleasure Principle\n\n· Henri Barbusse Under Fire\n\n· Rebecca West Return of the Soldier\n\nMethod of Instruction:\n\nseminar discussion with short lectures\n\nMethod of Evaluation:\n\n25% Short papers (2 short papers; 15% and 10%)\n\n5% In-class Student Presentation\n\n15% Session Engagement\n\n20% Quercus Discussion Board\n\n35% Final paper\n\nCourse Title: Creative Writing: Poetry\n\nCourse Code: ENG373H5F LEC0101 | Lecture T 3-5\n\nInstructor: Ryan Fitzpartrick\n\nThis course will involve a wide variety of experiments with poetic expression and poetic forms.\n\nPrerequisite: ENG289H5/ENG291H5\n\nGroup n/a\n\nCourse Title: Creative Writing: Prose\n\nCourse Code: ENG374H5S LEC0102 | Lecture M 3-5\n\nInstructor: Brent Wood\n\nStudents will experiment with fiction and non-fiction prose writing, including autobiography, biography and narrative for new visual, digital and interactive media.\n\nPrerequisite: ENG289H5/ENG291H5\n\nGroup n/a\n\nCourse Title: Creative Writing: Prose\n\nCourse Code: ENG374H5S LEC0201 | Lecture M 3-5\n\nInstructor: Lisa Foad\n\nStudents will experiment with fiction and non-fiction prose writing, including autobiography, biography and narrative for new visual, digital and interactive media.\n\nPrerequisite: ENG289H5/ENG291H5\n\nGroup n/a\n\nCourse Title: Special Topic in Creative Writing (Documentary Poetics: Activist Writing in the Archives)\n\nCourse Code: ENG377H5S | Lecture T 3-5\n\nInstructor: Andrea Thompson\n\nA concentrated study of one aspect of creative writing practice, such as a particular genre or theme, or the application of a particular formal technique.

You will thus become familiar with the astonishing literary output of William Cowper, Anna Barbauld, Ottobah Cugoano, William Blake, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Jane Austen, among others. Subjects to be explored will include new ideas about the imagination and creativity, the revolutions that gave birth to our modern political order, slavery and the transatlantic movement to abolish the slave trade, the expansion of the British Empire, the advent of feminist thought and the emergence of women writers as a major cultural force, and the radical experiments with literary form through which writers responded to and shaped the cultural, social, and political developments of their age.\n\nSelected Major Readings: Poetry and prose by J. Austen, A.L. Barbauld, W. Blake, E. Burke, S.T. Coleridge, W. Cowper, O. Cugoano, F. Jeffrey, H. More, T. Paine, C. Smith, H.M. Williams, M. Wollstonecraft, and W.

[36L]\n\nExclusion: ENG308Y5\n\nPrerequisites: 1.0 credit in ENG and 3.0 additional credits.\n\nGroup 4 Literature 1700-1900\n\nDetailed Description by Instructor:\n\nIn surveying “late” Romanticism, which is typically comprised of the second generation of British Romantic writers such as Ketas, the Shelleys, and Lord Byron, we will explore intersections of literature, politics and culture. We will explore these and other writers’ roles in shaping (and being shaped by) a number of central themes, and political and cultural movements and events, that include revolution and reform (political and literary); legal and natural rights (age, gender, racial, natural/legal): Empire and Imperialism; The Slave Trade and Abolition—among others. In doing so, we are interested in investigating humanity and identity—along age, gender, race, national, and cultural lines—as we reflect on the very theory and practice of studying of English literature, periodization, and canonization. The course is intended to: 1] familiarize students with selected major works of the history of British literature; 2] expand interpretative skills through a range of comparative and cultural studies approaches; and 3] focus on honing close reading, and critical writing and thinking skills. All three serve to help with other courses, to broaden your historical sense of literature, and to polish critical and interpretative skills.\n\nCourse Texts: I have ordered through the UTM bookstore, and the following is also available online (as an e-text or in hard copy)\n\n1.

In addition to providing a narrative setting, fictional space might guide our interpretation of plot, serve as a metaphor for broader historical, sociological or psychological issues, or become a character in its own right. Ranging across a variety of literary periods and genres, this course will explore how works of fiction describe space and how these descriptions shape our responses. Authors and texts may range from the early English period to the present day, including Beowulf, Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare, Margaret Cavendish, Jane Austen, Edgar Alan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry James, Virginia Woolf, Daphne du Maurier, Shirley Jackson, Gloria Naylor, Toni Morrison, Arundhati Roy, Amitav Ghosh, V.S. Naipaul, and so on.\n\nPrerequisites: 1.0 credit in ENG and 3.0 additional credits.\n\nGroup n/a\n\nDetailed Description by Instructor:\n\nReal or imagined geographical locations, landscapes, rooms, and houses play an important role in literature. More than just the background setting for a story, fictional space can guide our interpretation of the plot, serve as a metaphor for broader historical, sociological, and psychological issues, or become a full character in its own right. In this course, we will focus on one particular version of literary space—the haunted house—where unsettled histories and buried memories come back to life. What can we learn about the past as we look at the uncanny shapes it takes in the present? What will the inanimate objects coming to life tell us about the conceptual scope of the story and its context, and about ourselves as readers?\n\nSelected Major Readings:\n\nEdgar Allan Poe “The Tell-Tale Heart”; Shirley Jackson The Haunting of Hill House; Daphne du Maurier Rebecca; Toni Morrison Beloved; Neil Gaiman Coraline\n\nFirst Three Texts/Authors to be Studied:\n\nEdgar Allan Poe “The Tell-Tale Heart”; Shirley Jackson The Haunting of Hill House; Daphne du Maurier Rebecca\n\nMethod of Instruction:\n\nLectures, class discussion, Quercus discussion board\n\nMethod of Evaluation:\n\nClass participation (15%), Assignment 1 (25%), Assignment 2 (25%), Assignment 3 (35%)\n\nCourse Title: Canadian Fiction\n\nCourse Code: ENG392H5F | Lecture T 11-12, R 11-1\n\nInstructor: Colin Hill\n\nStudents will read novels and/or short stories of importance for Canadian literary history: these may include, for example, L.M.

Students will be expected to attend regularly and to complete readings thoughtfully and on time. Students are also strongly encouraged to participate in class discussions in a respectful and intellectually rigorous atmosphere. This course aims to build knowledge and appreciation of Canadian writing and to introduce students to a wide range of theoretical, critical, and literary-historical approaches relevant to the study of Canadian and other literatures. Engaged students should expect to come away from the course with a good understanding of the subjects and forms of Canadian fiction and many of its important literary, historical, cultural, and theoretical contexts.\n\nSelected Major Readings:\n\n1.

This course investigates this question through a dynamic breadth of Indigenous and diasporic environmental writing from around the world, weaving together continents, cultures, literary genres, and communication forms. We begin with an introduction to the intersections of race, indigeneity, and environmental (in)justice through Frantz Fanon’s decolonial classic The Wretched of the Earth (1961, trans. 1963), the landmark First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit’s “Principles of Environmental Justice” (1991), and the Indigenous-led Universal Declaration of the Rights of Mother Earth (UDRME, 2010). With this combination of theory and policy frameworks as our foundation, we launch into a wide selection of Indigenous and diasporic environmental literature and culture, including works from Turtle Island/North America, Aotearoa/New Zealand, Nigeria, Kenya, India, Oceania, and the Japanese diaspora. Our readings and viewings range from decolonial and Indigenous literary landmarks, through legal writing, memoirs, novels, and essays—alongside a wide range of multimedia such as documentaries, film, a music video, and digital “video poems.” The works we will study include Gandhi’s Hind Swaraj; Unbowed, the memoir of Wangari Maathai, the first African woman and first environmentalist to win the Nobel Peace Prize; ground-breaking environmental justice novels like Leslie Marmon Silko’s Ceremony and Toni Cade Bambara’s The Salt Eaters; essays by Arundhati Roy; and legal documents such as the Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act; alongside films like Angry Inuk and multimodal projects like Tanya Tagaq’s novel Split Tooth and its companion album Tongues.\n\nAs we investigate these varied forms together, we will analyze the techniques Indigenous and diasporic environmental writers use to build concrete legal, policy, and cultural change—including how they negotiate the complexities of trans-Indigenous and cross-cultural solidarity, environmental racism, “slow violence” (Nixon), and the uneven impacts of climate change. We study innovative communications with an eye to developing your own research and writing skills. The major assignment in this course is an independent research project about an environmental or sustainability issue of your choice, culminating in an original research paper, article, or multimedia communications materials (options include a scripted podcast or video, digital communications package, teaching/educational materials, set of short articles for a public outlet, and more). You’ll also have an opportunity to share that knowledge with a wider community through"
