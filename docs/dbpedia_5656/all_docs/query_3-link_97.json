        "text": "The quarry discovered during work on a real estate project in Har Hahotzvim in 2021 was one of the biggest source of stone in Second Temple-era Jerusalem, the Israel Antiquities Authority announced on Thursday.\n\nBuildings in Jerusalem, both ancient and modern, are famously made of creamy-hued stone blocks carved out of the local limestone, itself created over 200 million years ago, when the area was under the sea.\n\nBased on the trenches where the stones were carved out of the bedrock and on the blocks left in situ, this quarry – located in what is now the Har Hahotzvim industrial zone – was likely the origin for some of the huge blocks used in ancient construction, say Michael Chernin and Lara Shilov, excavation directors for the IAA.\n\nThis is far from the only quarry from the time, even just in the Jerusalem area. \"There are dozens,\" Chernin says. \"But it's one of the biggest, certainly among the top five.\"\n\nSome of the blocks extracted were monsters up to three meters (10 feet) long, 1.5 meters wide and half a meter thick, weighing around three tons or more, Chernin tells Haaretz by phone.\n\nThe true history of ancient Jewish underground hiding places in Israel\n\nJerusalem in King David's time was much larger than previously thought, researchers say\n\nWhen did King Hezekiah reign? Controversial artifacts may resolve biblical controversy\n\nArchaeologists Discover King Herod Had a Bonsai Garden\n\nHow do we know? First of all, because some slabs had already been carved out of the bedrock but hadn't been moved yet. Second, because of \"negatives\" left in the bedrock.\n\nBased on their sheer size and weight, the likeliest hypothesis is that the giant slabs and blocks would have been used for royal construction in Jerusalem, and certainly not in private homes, Chernin says.\n\nGiven the quarry's location and the monumental size of the blocks, the archaeologists posit that it was the source of stone for royal construction projects, including some by King Herod, the great builder. The giant size of the blocks that were extracted were typical of the Second Temple era, not so the Byzantine one.\n\nThe quarry could have also produced small stone bricks, though it bears noting archaeologists have found that much of Jerusalem north of the Old City seems to have served as a vast quarry.\n\nIn Jerusalem, Herod is credited with expanding the Temple Mount area and with reconstructing the Temple itself, as well as numerous other projects. He is also credited with monumental construction around his domain, including a fortress and palace pouring down the side of the Masada plateau, a palace at Jericho, the port at Caesarea Maritima and much more.\n\nFor the Jerusalem works alone, he would have needed a tremendous amount of material. This quarry's stone wouldn't likely have been transported elsewhere, Chernin says.\n\n\"Monumental construction projects continued in the city under [Herod's] successors as well: the most important of these projects was the construction of the city's 'Third Wall' by Herod's grandson, King Agrippa I, who reigned between 37-44 C.E.,\" the IAA says.\n\nThe archaeologists also believe the quarry likely produced the paving slabs for Jerusalem's streets, including the famous stepped street (aka the Pilgrim Road) that has been uncovered in recent years. That road dates to the same period as the quarry, the Late Second Temple period (roughly 63 B.C.E.-70 C.E.). The slabs found in the context of the quarry are of the very same type, the archaeologists say.\n\nHow big was this quarry? Enormous. So far, the archaeologists have excavated about 3,500 square meters – and that encompasses just part of the quarry.\n\nNote that Herod needed more than one lousy quarry in Jerusalem, however large, for his construction needs. Just a couple of years ago, archaeologists identified the source of the calcite alabaster used for the royal bathroom, which is also in central Israel (but not near Jerusalem). The researchers also report finding two vessels made of limestone in the context of the quarry.\n\nFrom about King Herod's time and through to the Bar Kochba debacle – featuring a Jewish revolt against Rome that is marked to this very day – vessels made of stone (as opposed to any other material, like clay) became associated with Jewish piety.\n\nBiblical archaeologist Shimon Gibson has explained that no other peoples in the area, even the Samaritans, used stone vessels, even though they would have been sturdier than clay kitchenware. Gibson has deduced that stone vessel use began in around 40 B.C.E. in Jerusalem and the Temple, spreading over the following decades to other cities, including the Galilee – but only in Jewish households.\n\nThe rationale for their adoption was that if stone vessels were befouled by a passing swine or corpse or in any other fashion, they were not beyond redemption for the purposes of kashrut. It isn't that the ancients necessarily tested the adsorption qualities of stone as opposed to clay; they would have been horrified by the results. The conclusion appears to be reflected by the section in Leviticus that points at cloth, wooden and leather vessels as being vulnerable to contamination. It doesn't mention stone.\n\nShilov remarks that the stone vessels may have been manufactured right there at the quarry. Or they may have been inside Jewish laborers' lunch pails. Archaeologists have identified stoneware manufacturing facilities elsewhere, including in the Galilee (whose discovery was taken as a refutation of the filthy libel that the ancient Galileans weren't as pious as the central Israelites).\n\nStoneware usage lasted less than 200 years – a blink of an eye in the span of Jewish history. The practice ceased when the Bar Kochba rebellion ended in tears and the Jews were kicked out."
