From burying ships beneath the ground to gilding the bones of deceased saints, medieval people went to great lengths to memorialize the dead. Represented in manuscripts, wall-painting, sculpture, and more, death pervaded the visual landscape of the Middle Ages. With threats of illness, war, invasion, and violence looming large throughout Europe in the period between 500 and 1500 CE, beliefs, superstitions, and fears around death governed medieval life. This course explores how those beliefs and fears became the basis of a rich, at times luxurious visual culture. From lavish textiles that adorned the recently deceased to elegant marble plaques affixed to tombs, the dead were often recipients of precious works of art. We will consider objects such as these, as well as representations of death itself. This is a discussion-based seminar in which we will investigate medieval attitudes around death, burial, and memorialization; students will conduct their own research on objects related to death in the Middle Ages. Students will develop the conceptual tools to analyze visual and material culture in historical context and through the lens of death.\n\nHART 314 - POLITICS OF CULTURAL HERITAGE IN THE MODERN MIDDLE EAST, 1800 TO THE PRESENT\n\nShort Title: POLITICS OF CULTURAL HERITAGE\n\nDepartment: Art History\n\nGrade Mode: Standard Letter\n\nCourse Type: Seminar\n\nCredit Hours: 3\n\nRestrictions: Enrollment is limited to Undergraduate, Undergraduate Professional or Visiting Undergraduate level students.\n\nCourse Level: Undergraduate Upper-Level\n\nDescription: This seminar will examine the history of the concept of \"cultural heritage\" in the modern Middle East.

What is it about the modern period that accounts for this shift in how monstrosity is represented and understood and how does it differ from earlier historical images of the monster. This class will examine the modernist fascination with monstrosity, asking not only why it became a topic of such particular and widespread interest to artists, writers, and filmmakers during this time, but also what it can tell us about modernist aesthetics more broadly. Examining a range of representations from the 18th century on, we will look at a variety of visual artists, filmmakers, and novelists who depict various forms of monsters, be they human (Jack the Ripper) or non-human (the Golem). From Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and the myth of the vampire, to Picasso’s monstrous images of 1920s, to the distinctly modern phenomenon of serial killing, this course will chart the dark monstrous underside to modern art.

African Diaspora Studies offers a framework and set of theoretical interventions for understanding the lives of black people across the globe. As a field of study, it asks what is the historical effect and after-life of several centuries of forced displacement, dispossession and expatriation of millions of Africans. This cross-oceanic transfer of people, labor, capital, ideas, and goods has given rise to a way of thinking about and imaging identity, belonging, and movement that shift away from national identity and frameworks that hinge on the centrality of the nation-state.\n\nHART 319 - ARCHITECTURE, TRADE, AND POWER IN EARLY MODERN ISLAMIC EMPIRES\n\nShort Title: ARCHITECTURE ISLAMIC EMPIRES\n\nDepartment: Art History\n\nGrade Mode: Standard Letter\n\nCourse Type: Seminar\n\nDistribution Group: Distribution Group I\n\nCredit Hours: 3\n\nRestrictions: Enrollment is limited to Undergraduate, Undergraduate Professional or Visiting Undergraduate level students.\n\nCourse Level: Undergraduate Upper-Level\n\nDescription: During the early modern period, ca. 1500-1800, around one-third of the earth’s human population inhabited territories that were ruled by three empires: the Ottomans in the eastern Mediterranean, the Safavids in the Iranian plateau, and the Mughals in South Asia. This period saw a surge in production of architectural monuments (such as the Taj Mahal), the emergence of cosmopolitan cities (such as Istanbul and Isfahan), and the expansion of the public sphere in gardens, promenades, and coffeehouses. This course examines the architecture, urbanism, and material culture of these three empires in the context of global trade, representations of power, and urban life in the capital cities of Istanbul, Isfahan, and Delhi.

This course surveys images and objects made between the fifth and the fifteenth century to investigate how they explained, questioned, and theorized the natural and supernatural. With special attention to the inseparability of concepts of science, magic, and religion in premodernity, this discussion-based course will examine how art helped to mediate and substantiate medieval understandings of the world. From textual amulets to saints’ shrines, objects had the power to heal, perform miracles, and affect change beyond the explanation of earthly phenomena. We will look at a wide variety of objects and images related to scientific and para-scientific disciplines; geometry, astrology, cosmology, medicine, anatomy, botany, physiognomy, and geomancy all relied on and produced visual materials to aid in practice. How did the concepts of art, science, magic, and religion overlap, and how do modern definitions fall short in helping us understand premodern ideas about the natural world? Students will develop the conceptual tools necessary to confront these questions using visual evidence. Graduate/Undergraduate Equivalency: HART 520.

This course investigates the representation and perception of bodies, human and otherwise, in medieval visual culture by focusing on bodies that were thought to be “different.” Bodies carried with them hidden anatomical structures, marks of social and cultural status, and, in the eyes of the Church, the sin that came with human sexuality. How did artists and craftsmen make the body’s multiple meanings and messages intelligible in images? From diagrams in medical manuscripts to sculptures adorning cathedral façades to body-part-shaped liturgical vessels, bodies are everywhere in medieval visual culture. We will pair these images and objects with medieval texts offering period insights into the nature and meanings of bodies, and consider them through a contemporary theoretical lens. By focusing on approaches to representing bodily differences and attitudes toward perceived difference, this course will place special emphasis on how medieval ideas about gender, sexuality, and race found expression in art objects. In addition to smaller assignments throughout the semester, this course will include a final paper / project. A prior HART course is recommended, but not required.\n\nHART 338 - HART IN THE WORLD SPRING SEMINAR\n\nShort Title: HART IN THE WORLD SEM\n\nDepartment: Art History\n\nGrade Mode: Standard Letter\n\nCourse Type: Seminar\n\nCredit Hours: 3\n\nRestrictions: Enrollment is limited to Undergraduate, Undergraduate Professional or Visiting Undergraduate level students.\n\nCourse Level: Undergraduate Upper-Level\n\nDescription: This seminar serves as required preparation for the planned “HART in the World” research travel course (HART 397) offered in the immediately following summer session.

We will consider the slippages and contours of non-visual sensory registers (senses other than sight) and queer aesthetic practices and theories in contemporary art. What does it mean to queer the visual realm? What does it mean to center an expanded sensorial queerness? In this class, we will look at how artists engage the sensory modalities of sound, touch, proprioception, and interoception as both method and material within their work. We will consider the use of spit, bodily fluids, blood, sweat, vibrations, visceral inclinations, indigestion, balance, and other sensory things to ask: How do senses evoke dissident feelings? As Kyle Wazanna Tompkins writes in the 2015 winter issue of A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, “To aim for the visceral, we have found, is to come at feeling, at sex, at sensation, at theory itself, from a queer place.” It is my priority to make this course on contemporary art joyous, safe, and accessible to students of all genders, sexualities, and disabilities.

Over the course of the semester, we will pair black contemporary artists with core readings in black studies and underline citational practices between the fields of Black studies and art history. Through this unique case-study-based pairing, students will learn about the methods, materials, and theoretical throughlines within the work of formative visual and performance artists while also becoming familiar with different concepts within the interdisciplinary field of black studies.\n\nHART 367 - ARCHITECTURES OF POWER, RESISTANCE, AND COEXISTENCE: A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE\n\nShort Title: ARCHITECTURES POWER RESISTANCE\n\nDepartment: Art History\n\nGrade Mode: Standard Letter\n\nCourse Type: Seminar\n\nDistribution Group: Distribution Group I\n\nCredit Hours: 3\n\nRestrictions: Enrollment is limited to Undergraduate, Undergraduate Professional or Visiting Undergraduate level students.\n\nCourse Level: Undergraduate Upper-Level\n\nDescription: This seminar adopts a global approach to examine architecture and the built environment as sites of power, resistance, and coexistence.

The city is to be read as a composite environment built upon the control of land, resources, and bodies enacting a struggle over what is to be remembered and honored, and what is to be erased and forgotten. The course provides a rigorous immersion in the city of Paris while revealing its transnational and multicultural nature. \"Unlearning Paris\" was conceived and taught as a pilot course for the opening of Rice Global Paris Center during the summer of 2023.
