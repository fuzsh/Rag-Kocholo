Hart, who was sitting with us, quickly jumped in to remind Gallant that once she watched it a second time, she loved it. And in fact, Hart and I agreed she looks great in the film.\n\nThe voice behind hits like From New York to L.A. and Sugar Daddy still sounds great, too, as witnessed during our interview when Gallant jumped up on a couple of occasions to belt out lengthy sections of songs a cappella.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nCannes Lions 2016: Bet on these best ads\n\nIgloofest boasts clubland heavyweights at Montreal's Old Port\n\nOnce Gallant got over her unfounded worries about her looks, she admitted it was a great experience to work with Hart on this trip back through her life.\n\n“It’s fun to look back on (my) career,” she said. “It’s extraordinary because it feels like three different lives. At the beginning I was hesitant, because I was saying: ‘Why would they want to do a documentary on my life? Get Céline Dion — she’s a lot more famous than me.’\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“They told me: ‘It’s not about fame. It’s about who you are.’ And I said: ‘Give me a better reason why I should do it.’ And they said: ‘We think it’s going to touch people and inspire people.’\n\nAnd I said: ‘Well, if you can do that, OK, I’m going (to do it).’ So I did. … It’s hard for me, because you don’t like to see yourself in a natural (setting).\n\nAdded Hart: “Documentary storytelling is meant to be told like (it is in) this film. Things happened that weren’t supposed to happen. There was a lot of improvised content. It takes on an authenticity. She trusted me and I trusted her.”\n\nPatsy, produced by Sergeo Kirby of Montreal’s Loaded Pictures, really does chronicle different stories. Early on, Gallant says: “I’m not just the disco queen. I’m other things, too.” And she’s right.\n\nThe story begins with Les soeurs Gallant, a group Patsy joined at the age of three. There were 10 kids in the Gallant family, and their mother enlisted four of the sisters for the group, in a bid to bring some money into a household that was having a tough time making ends meet.\n\nThe four Gallant sisters started off performing in their home province of New Brunswick, and then headed to the big city — Montreal — when Patsy was just 10, playing sketchy venues on the Main and elsewhere.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThen came the pop stardom in the ’70s, first in French and later in English. In one of the odder wrinkles in Quebec’s music history, Gallant’s biggest international hit, From New York to L.A., was an anglo adaptation of Gilles Vigneault’s nationalist anthem Mon pays. She even had a national TV show in the late ’70s, the Patsy Gallant Show, on CTV.\n\n“I didn’t open the door — I kicked it down,” said Gallant. “I wanted this so much. I love this so much. I didn’t hesitate. I just understood this was my calling from Day 1.”\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBut when disco crashed and burned, Gallant fell on hard times. Following a tough divorce, she moved with her young son to Paris, where she was given a second lease on life by ace Quebec songwriter Luc Plamondon. He cast her as Stella Spotlight in his hit musical Starmania, which ran at Théâtre Mogador in Paris from 1993 to 2001.\n\nGallant has since returned to live in Montreal, and she’s still very active. Last year she was part of La Tournée des Idoles, a tour featuring a slew of older Quebec artists that packed venues across the province. And she is set to perform Saturday, Dec. 3 in the Noël symphonique concert at Maison symphonique, featuring the Sinfonia de Lanaudière and singers Bruno Pelletier, Nadja and Paul Daraîche, among others.\n\n“I feel very privileged and very lucky to still be working, singing and having my health,” said Gallant.\n\nHer dream, as she recounts in the film, is to make a full album of her own compositions — something she has never done up until now — and that dream is set to become a reality. She has recorded three songs so far.\n\n“I’ve waited a long time to do this, and I want to do it right,” said Gallant. “It could be my last album, or it could be the beginning of something. You never know. This is my baby.”\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“To me, that was the clincher in terms of the film,” said Hart. “There’s the biography. You’re telling a story that took place. But the story of her own music, we’re on a journey here. She wants to accomplish something, so it’s something that’s moving forward.\n\n“When I came here the first time and I heard one of the songs, I was blown away. These are important lyrics. To me, the line in the film (that hit me is): ‘Ma musique c’est le parcours de ma vie. It’s the road map of my life.’ And it is. The songs are about her son, about her family, about women. It’s about love, broken hearts. It’s beautiful.”\n\nAT A GLANCE\n\nPatsy screens Wednesday, Nov. 30 at 7 p.m. at the Lion d’Or, 1676 Ontario St. E., and Sunday, Dec. 4 at 7 p.m. at Théâtre Outremont, 1248 Bernard Ave. W.
