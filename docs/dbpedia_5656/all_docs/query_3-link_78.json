        "text": "New Jersey recently surpassed 100 open cannabis retail stores serving both medical and recreational customers. Seems like a slow growing number but this is no small feat. \"Despite more than 60% of New Jersey municipalities opting out of having cannabis businesses in their jurisdictions, cannabis businesses have operating licenses in every county, and there is at least one dispensary in 20 of NJ's 21 counties.\" A couple of friendly reminders: 1. Municipalities may want to \"go geezer\" and opt out of cannabis businesses, but the professionals driving the cannabis industry's east coast expansion won't let that get in our way. 2. East Coast cannabis \"deserts\" are a different game. Our geographic locations and more condensed population makes this less of an issue. You can opt out if you want, but most likely it just means making your residents drive 15-20 mins to give another municipality their tax dollars. 3. Jersey strong üí™ See everyone MJ Unpacked!\n\nWe all enjoy a good story. We think we have an interesting one. The California cannabis industry is seriously handicapped by over-regulation and politics. This is evident at all levels, from state to county to the tiniest town. 61% of cities and counties outlaw cannabis retail operations in California. Only 1,216 dispensary licenses were active as of four months ago, according to the DCC. So, what does it take to bring patients and consumers access to cannabis at the local level? Well, like the title of that movie, it‚Äôs complicated. It can be a very messy business and it‚Äôs being played out to varying degrees in numerous jurisdictions across the state. The city of Sonoma is a prime example - a small Northern California town with a single dispensary serving the city and its surrounding population of 40,000. Though Sonoma‚Äôs ordinance allows for two dispensaries, the city council continues to stall the process for a second retail outlet. The question is, why? More to come‚Ä¶ #sonomavalleycannabisgroup #cannabis #cannabisbusiness #cannabisindustry #cannabiscommunity #dispensary #sonoma #cannabisretail\n\nGreat opportunity for anyone that is looking to acquire a fully operational dispensary in one of California‚Äôs most desired cannabis markets Santa Ana, CA (Pop 309k). The owners have secured a long term lease at a facility that is 5,800 SqFt, more than enough for a flagship retail & delivery business. The dispensary is located in one of the best and nicest locations in Santa Ana, plenty of visibility and right off HWY 55!!! The business generated $3.2M in Gross Revenues for 2023. This is a great opportunity for someone who is looking to expand their footprint in the Santa Ana Cannabis Market, while also taking advantage of the very nearby major markets, a multi-state operator looking to target a revenue generating dispensary or someone who is looking to enter the industry. California recently announced the ‚ÄúProvisional‚Äù, or temporary license, program will sunset June 30, 2022 which means that in order to operate legally you must go through the arduous and time consuming process of getting a full ‚ÄúAnnual‚Äù license or acquire an already existing state provisional license. #cannabiscommunity #cannabis #cannabisculture #cannabissociety #cannabiscures #420 #420daily #420community #firm #realestate #realtor #cultivation #realestateagent #realestateinvesting #opportunity #investing #investing101 #listing #listingagent #legal\n\nCan‚Äôt we all just get along and sing Kumbaya by the fire? If you think the cannabis industry should all get along, you need to look closer at the dynamics. The reason I wrote ‚Äú7 factions of cannabis‚Äù for Fat Nugs was because all factions have different objectives, and someday hopefully they will all be at the table negotiating a good outcome for all. However, the reality is.. Big Pharma wants schedule 3 and no further. Big MSOs wants heavily restricted licensing. Small Businesses and social equity applicants want lower barriers of entry. Customers want clean cannabis and homegrows. Those with cannabis convictions want expungement. Labs don‚Äôt want to compete over test scores and remain having high volume testing. Investors want strong returns instead of what the have experienced.. To me schedule 3 is literally 1 faction getting everything they want, and all the rest walking away with at best, the end of 280e.\n\nYou didn't hear it from us, but there are some big changes coming to the US cannabis space. üëÄ For starters, its once biggest company is officially over. In addition, the DEA wants to reschedule the plant from the same category as heroin to the one with ketamine and steroids. Today, we're taking a closer look into how those two things intersect. As Juliet Bennett Rylah reports: üåø MedMen was ready to cash in on California‚Äôs cannabis legalization in 2016. üí∏ Its well-lit, tech-savvy dispensaries led many to compare them to Apple Stores, and by 2018, MedMen boasted a $3B valuation. üí® But MedMen got too high on its own supply, expanding rapidly and taking on debt in an uncertain industry. So, what now? Here's the lowdown:\n\nHow to open a dispensary in #Connecticut The prospect of a legal adult-use marijuana industry is generating significant excitement among Connecticut's business community. Entrepreneurs, producers, and investors are starting to plan their businesses and looking for more information on how to open a dispensary in Connecticut. The license application for retailer licenses is coming at the start of February, so it is wise to start getting guidance. Requirements & fees The law divides applicants into two categories: Social Equity Applicants and General Applicants. A \"Social Equity Applicant\" is an individual or individuals who own and control at least 65 percent of the company, or is an individual who: Had an average household income of less than 300% of the state median household income over the three tax years immediately preceding the application; and (a) was a resident of a disproportionately impacted area for not less than five of the ten years immediately preceding the https://lnkd.in/gn2JbZE2\n\nThank you to Sharon Crowley and Fox 5 (WNYW-TV New York) for including me in this segment about retail location applications before NY community boards, which is a topic we'll discuss tonight with Tremaine Wright of New York State Office of Cannabis Management at the High NY event cosponsored by Greenspoon Marder LLP at Sony Hall! (RSVP link for event in comments, hit me up for comp code that hopefully still works! :) ) I'm doing what I can to help educate these community boards about the NY cannabis launch to date (and help explain that they do not have capacity to fully opt out of retail since that deadline passed in December 2021), and some of the unexpected and perhaps counterintuitive benefits of opening legal dispensaries learned from studies in more \"mature\" adult-use markets that have popped up in the podcast news feed. I think any resistance we encounter is perfectly understandable based on the prevailing anti-potpaganda inculcated into generations by the War on Drugs. And just to be clear about what I discussed with Fox-- I do not think that the community boards will unreasonably delay the licensing process, I think that unexpected developments like litigation could instead. Our task is to educate these community boards for the good of building the industry the right way, and the unfortunate reality is dispensaries ARE ALREADY HERE IN THE FORM OF 8,000+ ILLICIT STORES SELLING UNSAFE PRODUCTS. We can't rely on those stores being shut down quickly, so the best way to ensure public safety is to open up as many licensed dispensaries as possible. And thanks to Tony Gallo's comment for reminding me of point I wanted to put in this post-- there is an inherent disconnect in these meetings because the boards understandably want as much detail as possible (about ownership, security, floor plans etc.) when most applicants are understandably not going to incur expenses to generate this specificity when they effectively have a lotto ticket right now and no idea of how long those lotto odds are (though the odds have decreased with New York State Office of Cannabis Management twice extending the effective deadline for notice to municipalities). Ultimately, all that matters is that we're in this together, and I'm always happy to help the cause any way I can. #cannabis #marijuana #nyc #newyork #networking"
