ALGOL (ALGOrithmic Language)

is a family of imperative computer programming languages developed jointly by a committee of European and American computer scientists in a meeting in 1958 at ETH Zurich (Algol 58). Algol 58 introduced code blocks and the begin and end pairs for delimiting them. Two years later, Algol 60 was specified, as the result of a meeting in Paris in January 1960 by 13 European and American scientists, Peter Naur, John Backus, John McCarthy, Friedrich L. Bauer, Adriaan van Wijngaarden, et al. Algol 60 became the standard for the publication of algorithms and had a profound effect on future language development, it was the first language implementing nested function definitions with lexical scope. Algol 68 was designed by IFIP, while Niklaus Wirth based his own Algol W [2] on Algol 60 before moving to develop Pascal.

Algol W

A boolean procedure in Algol W from the chess program Awit by Tony Marsland [3] :

11662 LOGICAL PROCEDURE CLEAR(INTEGER VALUE SQA, SQF, SQT); 11663 BEGIN 11664 INTEGER DIR; 11665 LOGICAL FREE; 11666 FREE := FALSE; 11667 DIR := BOTV(EDGE, OFFSET(SQF)−OFFSET(SQT)); 11668 IF DIR ~= 0 THEN BEGIN 11669 FREE := TRUE; 11670 IF SQA ~= SQF AND 11671 DIR = BOTV(EDGE, OFFSET(SQA)−OFFSET(SQT)) 11672 THEN FREE := FALSE; 11673 FOR SQ := SQF+DIR STEP DIR UNTIL SQT−DIR 11674 DO IF FREE AND BRD(SQ) ~= 0 11675 THEN FREE := FALSE; 11676 END; 11677 FREE 11678 END CLEAR;
