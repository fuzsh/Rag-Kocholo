ALGOL 58 was the first ALGOL programming language. It was released in 1958 by a team of international computer scientists. The language was designed to be a more readable and reliable alternative to FORTRAN. ALGOL 58 was very influential in the development of subsequent programming languages. It was the first language to use nested subroutines and introduced the concept of block structured programming. It also had a major impact on the design of ALGOL 60. Despite its significant impact, ALGOL 58 was never widely adopted. This was due in part to its complex syntax and lack of implementation tools. Nevertheless, it remains an important milestone in the history of programming languages.
