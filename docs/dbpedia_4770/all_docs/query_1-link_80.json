        "text": "No love for CORAL 66?\n\nBack in the day, in order to get a military application running, I had to take the assembler output of a Coral 66 program and basically rewrite it completely in proper assembler, because the compiler wasn't merely not optimised, it seemed positively designed to waste as many CPU cycles as possible. It used the 9989 microprocessor, and completely ignored the 9989's register windowing system, instead creating boilerplate functions every single time.\n\nKids today...I'm the one feeding the punched tape repeatedly through the reader to get the floating point libraries to work. Arguments over bracket syntax, tabs versus space and to semicolon or not are really a sign that nowadays there is very little to complain about.\n\nIt started my career move...\n\nWe had an Elliott 803 at Rugby College (later absorbed into Lanchester Poly). Although I was studying Applied Physics, the computer part of the course fired me up and I went into computing from that point on. I remember the console speaker that, although abused to play music, did give you a sense of what your program was doing. Later on, in my 6800/8008/8080 hobby days, I used a transistor radio for the same thing.\n\nThere were two no-no's: The first was to remember how little memory you had to play with so large arrays were not possible and, if attempted, resulted in a subscript overflow message (iirc - SUBSCROFLO). The second was to make sure your plotter programmes completed. The plotter involved an extra paper tape load for the operator. If your plot failed then the whole machine had to be restarted. The plotting code was probably an early form of overlay.\n\nBefore we had magnetic tape installed the paper tape reader was something to behold. The output from the reader had to be caught in a basket as the speed was so high. The computer operator was a very smart young lady too.... Happy days. ;-)\n\nI've used Algol-60 at school\n\nI did my AO-Level Computer Studies in 1983 it 1983 or 1982 (can't remember!) and I did my project in Algol-60. Because that's what we ran on our Research Machines 380Zs. It was a program to solve the N-Queens problem, using the process of making different permutations of the numbers 1-N, and I did it using recursion (because I could). Little did I realise at the time that it was really out of date, and there's no reason we couldn't have done it in Pascal or C. But that's all we had.\n\nUgh! PASCAL\n\nWe used it in school (UMASS/Amherst) as a teaching language. Too \"wordy\" for me, especially the IO statements. But it did get the job done.\n\nWhen I started working, it was at Data General, who had an Algol-like language called DG/L, which I absolutely loved. It was my language of choice for little utility programs on our AOS and AOS/VS systems.\n\nThen, of course, came the Sun workstations, with UNIX and C.\n\nGame over.\n\nBonus for the CALCOMP drum plotters. I worked part time at the comuter center in school, we had one (3 or 4 foot wide). The number of aborted plots due to pen failure was astounding, as was the pen budget!\n\nAlgol 68 is not ALGOL 60\n\nAlgol 68 is basically a different language from Algol 60—and the Algol 60 designers, most notably Djisktra, were less than impressed by it, and along with others on the committee issued a \"minority report\" disowning Algol 68. Syntax aside,and leaving out the object-oriented stuff, Algol 68 actually bears a distinct resemblance to C++. Algol 60, on the other hand, begat Pascal. So really they are different languages sharing part of a name.\n\nI never got to use Algol 68 because it was difficult to write a compiler for and nowhere I worked had one. Burroughs Algol (a variant of ALGOL 60), on the other hand, was available. Time pressure, and perhaps a desire not to be seen to know too much about the \"old iron\", meant I never did write any Burroughs Algol. That was perhaps my loss. I don't think I missed anything by not writing Algol 68.\n\nBTW Burroughs Algol was implemented in hardware. It was a stack machine with display registers and hardware support for resizing arrays.\n\nALGOL 60 was the first language I learned, at school in the Computer Club. Turn round was a bit longer than ten minutes. We used to write programs on coding sheets, which were then taken to the nearby university and typed up by data prep ladies, run by the operators on the ICL1909, and the coding sheets, pack of cards and printout was returned to us a week later. That did make you concentrate fairly hard on program correctness; my first program calculated primes and I've still got the output somewhere. After a while a friend and I learned that we could get off the bus on the way home, walk up to the university and punch our own cards on IBM 029 punches, and then watch while the operators ran the program. That made things a lot faster and meant we could write bigger programs - my favourite was a linear regression program for the results of our physics experiments. It made them look much more 'official' :)\n\nAnd then we discovered the unversity had a free access PDP-8 so we learned BASIC on DECtape and the joys of typing into an ASR-33 and Friden Flexowriters. And then ...\n\n... the university got a copy of the POP-2 compiler. Still my favourite language ever! Programs to synthesise English using Chomsky's grammars etc etc. Machine Intelligence 1, 2, 3 ...\n\nMy first computer language...\n\n... was Algol W, at university in the mid-70s. Sequence, selection and iteration - what more do you need? :) It set the way for how I think about programming, and I found it difficult to think in other ways. For example, we later covered the functional programming language SASL (a precursor of Miranda, which in turn preceded Haskell), and I found it almost impossible to think that way, until one day the penny simply dropped, and I had no problems after that.\n\nFor Raymond, up above, I still have my copy of the MoD \"Blue Book\" standard for CORAL 66. Used that at university on a CTL mini, and in professional life on Ferranti Argus and CTL/ITL minis.\n\nMy real love was Pascal, and I remember how chuffed I was the day I discovered that although I had been using it for many months, I hadn't realised that our implementation of it did not include GOTO statements! I still have a free implementation of it on my home PC - very useful for occasional puzzle solving.\n\nOthers I used included Fortran IV and BCPL at university, and ASM-86, PL/M-86, and PL/I in professional life.\n\nBut then I became a consultant :)\n\nEarly Uni Computing\n\nBack in the early 70's Bangor University Computing Department kept what was the previous workhorse 803 in a back room, after migrating to an ICL4130. The computing department manager would oversee a rigorous test on the 803 operating procedures before allowing any member of the great unwashed student body unsupervised access to said machine. I've still got my copy of Algol A104 compiler tape in a drawer somewhere. As an introduction into the wide world of programming this was an ideal education in small memory management and code optimisation, useful on my next processor, an intel 4040. How did the compile procedure go? Power supply to 'on', tape in reader, press the control button to 'read', hit the 'operate' bar, press the control button back to 'normal', hit the 'operate' bar... And listen to the soothing chatter of the loudspeaker connected to the overflow bit... Kids these days, they don't believe you!\n\nALGOL 60 was the first language I learned, in 1973. At Warwick Uni, they reckoned that virtually any science undergrad would need computer skills, so this was a compulsory course.\n\nThey ran an ICL 4130 and a 4120 at the time - designed by Elliott, so presumably somebody at Elliott was an ALGOL fan.\n\nNever used it in any commercial setting, but it laid the basis for the structure used in any number of languages since. When writing COBOL, I often sketched things out using ALGOL to check things made sense before getting the coding sheets dirty.\n\nWho remembers Backus-Naur ?\n\nNot quite how I remember it\n\n\"you basically march up to the machine, the machine's got the ALGOL system loaded, you run your programme, it produces gibberish\"\n\nWhen I was in the sixth form, one of my maths teachers had a contact at the local Poly. We were low priority, do we got to leave our precious punched tapes with the operator who would run it for us in time for us to pick up the gibberish the next day.\n\nNeedless to say I thought computers were complete bollocks.\n\nA couple of years later when I was at University, and they had these lineprinter style terminals, I started to think wow, maybe there's something in this; soon after I got access to a green screen terminal.\n\nThe rest is history.\n\nFall 1965: Gunn High School in Palo Alto CA... the school district's fist 'computer' class (Perhaps one of the first HS classes anywhere?)\n\nThey only had a keypunch machine at the school... and at the first class admitted they were still looking for a computer to use, as the District had quashed plans to allow their own in-house computer to be used by [gasp] students!\n\nNext class, they announced they had FOUND a computer very nearby:\n\nThe Burroughs B5500 mainframe at SLAC!!! (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center).\n\nNo problem for students there!!! We ran our class exercises in B5500 ALGOL.\n\nEarly Algol68 Compilers\n\nIn the early 1980’s UCLA had an active group of graduate students working in a compiler for Algol68 for the IBM 360/91 under Robert Ugalus. The book, “the Informal introduction to Algol68” was the Bible for the language semantics. The book created its own set of specialized words like propositity and lapsity to describe in precious words the language semantics. The underlsying memory model was the stack retention model with variants called the Cactus stack for its threaded nature. The language semantics, referred in previous posts as European sensibilities was quite well done. It lacked a machine description in favor of very precise descriptions of the language semantics, very worthwhile reading for those who like reading compilers semantics by jumping into the way back machine. As Joe Bob Briggs used to say, “check it out”.\n\nAlgol 68 on a ICL 4100\n\nWhen at Warwick University in 1974 I was using Algol 68 for my computing project. My maze solver did eventually work though as mentioned the bug cycle was more like one day as you had to post your punch card stack into the pigeon hole of the computer suite and wait for them to process it. I found by trial and error that why my maze solver never ran correctly on Friday afternoons was because they used to take half of the magnetic memory offline to clean it or something. The largest maze I could create an a Friday was 3 x 3!\n\nAlgol 60 on the HP 2100A\n\nWell, I've used it -- it was the best language to use on the HP 2100A, because you needed only one paper tape, because Algol 60 was designed to work with a single pass compiler. Apart from it being a better language anyway.\n\nFORTRAN IV, as it was then, needed a two paper tapes. So, even for a little FORTRAN program, you had to load the first pass compiler tape (then wind it up on its spool), then put your program tape through and get the intermediate tape. You'd then load the second compiler paper tape, and feed it the intermediate tape. It would then produce the binary. If anything went wrong, you had to start again.\n\nEven then proper design made a huge difference. Declaring your variables first, and declaring functions before you use them, makes good sense anyway, and has the excellent side-effect of improving usability by one-pass compilation.\n\nThe influence of ALGOL 60\n\nYou can see the influence of ALGOL 60 on modern languages most clearly if you compare programs written in 1960 versions of ALGOL, FORTRAN, COBOL, and LISP (which were the most widespread languages at the time). The ALGOL 60 program will (for the most part) be readily readable by someone who has learned C, Java, or C# and nothing else. Understanding the FORTRAN, COBOL, or (in particular) LISP programs would require a good deal of explanation, but understanding the ALGOL 60 program would mainly be realising that begin, end, and := correspond to curly braces and = in C, Java, and C#. Look, for example, at the Absmax procedure at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL_60#Examples_and_portability_issues\n\nFORTRAN and COBOL continued to evolve into something completely unlike their 1960 forms while still retaining their names -- even up to today. ALGOL mainly evolved into languages with different names, such as Pascal, C, CPL, Simula and many others. So ALGOL is not really more of a dead language than FORTRAN II and COBOL 60. There was a computer scientist in the late 60s that was asked \"What will programming languages look like in 2000?\". He answered \"I don't know, but I'm pretty sure one of them will be called FORTRAN\". This was a pretty good prediction, as Fortran (only name change is dropping the all caps) still exists, but looks nothing like FORTRAN 66, which was the dominant version at the time. You can argue that the modern versions of FORTRAN and COBOL owe more to ALGOL 60 than they do to the 1960 versions of themselves.\n\nMy first programing language was Burroughs EXTENDED Algol 60 on a B5000 in 1965. Burroughs always extended the basic language. The beauty of the Burroughs' extensions is that their ALGOL 60 was wedded to the hardware design, and their compilers are wall written in the language they compiled. At that time is was ALGOL, COBOL and ESBOL(?SP) which was superset of ALGOL used to program the MCP. I did in fact program the MCP. In ESBOL one had wide open access to the hardware itself.\n\nThe B5000 hardware had an interesting limitation: Code was generated into program segment strings which were block limited to 1024 words. A word was 48 bits. Why? The program segment string S register was 10 bits. If say, a BEGIN code END; block exceeded 1024 words, then the compiler yielded a \"program segment string exceeds 1024\" error. This of course nailed me in my first program. Easy enough to repair.\n\nThe B5000. B6000 series also had virtual memory. Program segment strings need not be memory resident. And the 1024 word segments could be viewed a VM. Each program segment string terminated n a descriptor that referenced the program reference table (PRT). This referenced location could be a disk address to access the next segment. Etc.\n\nThe B6000 series, I worked on the B6500, generalized the PRT into what was called the cactus stack. This enabled the extended version of ALGOL 60 to have multiple dimensional arrays of tasks. Super feature. An array element had the parent node that could link to family member tasks. The first time I used the feature I had a \"death in the family error.\" This meant that a member the family hierarchy crashed.\n\nI can go on and on about this amazing hardware/ALGOL fusion. I have to say it's unforgettable since I'm soon to be 80 years old. I've written software in some 20 or so languages during my career as a computer scientist, and Burroughs extended ALGOL 60 is definitely the mid-wife of almost all of them.\n\nBill\n\nAlgol was OK, but all wasn't plain sailing.\n\nI programmed a lot in Algol 60 between 1967 and 1971 at the University of Salford on the English Electric KDF9. I was doing research into Computer Aided Circuit design using Y matrices. When I started paper tape was in use created and edited on Friden Flexowriters. My program was fairly large for the time and a relatively large roll of tape. There were two ways of changing the program - put the paper tape in the flexowriter and set it to copy, up to the line that you wanted to change, type in the changes, re-sync the rest of the tape and let it copy the rest OR get out the little tape splicing machine and hack out a section, gluing your amendment in. Compiling and running was effectively twice per day since you had to write out a job slip and put your tape in a box for the computer operators to load, compile and execute. Then - REVOLUTION - the kdf9 was front-ended with a pdp8 running a system called COTAN ( I faintly recall from more than half a century ago). This had a disc where you could keep your program and edit it using ksr33 teleprinters (if you were patient). Then submit your job electronically no less.\n\nUnfortunately the COTAN system had a sort-of anti -Algol design - it was based on 80 column card images. Students were allocated a certain (insufficient) maximum number of cards. Algol 60 was not Fortran, so my beautiful indented layout of the \"begin\" and \"ends\" of the paper tape which used quite a lot of blank characters didn't fit in the allocated card space. Answer - eliminate most of the comments and the blanks. This resulted in a more or less \"rectangular\" program of solid text 80 characters wide - not that the Algol compilers cared but the very devil to read, edit, and debug.\n\nI still have some printouts (somewhere) of the resulting mess together with some of the little boxes originally used to submit the paper tape jobs.\n\nI don't hunger after the \"old days\" of computing.\n\nA lot of people program in ALGOL 60\n\nThere is a lot of programming done in ALGOL 60 on Burroughs machines (now Unisys MCP machines). Burroughs extended the language with IO, some an extension of FORTRAN-style IO, but most programmers did their own direct formatting, since the FORTRAN IO was interpreted and slow.\n\nI believe Burroughs ALGOL was based on Elliot ALGOL. I later worked with another Burroughs guy who developed a language based on Elliot ALGOL for the Apple II. This was at a company called Netcomm in Australia.\n\nActually Don Knuth wrote one of the first Burroughs ALGOL compilers on a summer break as a student. It was on the B200 (from memory), but it predated the B5000 ALGOL compiler.\n\nBurroughs ALGOL is a really heavy-duty systems language that makes C look like the toy that it is. It is a shame that C has effectively killed language development. If ALGOL or its next generation (ALGOL-68, ALGOL-W, Pascal, CPL, etc) had continued, we’d probably have pretty solid languages by now, rather than the rather flimsy C.\n\n1965\n\nHaving done my degree at Woolwich Polytechnic (Tommy Flowers was there long before me!) from 1965 onwards while working as a rocket scientist at the MoD, I was one of the early progammers who never actually went in to the computer room where the program was run. I simply submitted my Algol programs on coding sheets which would be run and sent back. I did occasionally see the computer through a window!\n\nI then taught Algol at Braintree college on an Elliott 803.\n\nNothing compares with MIRFAC, probably the most sophisticed language ever running on the MoD's COSMOS computer though. Simon Lavington reviews this machine.\n\nRe: Facebook simply would not exist today if not for Bletchley Park\n\nApart from Colossus Bletchley Park had nothing to do with electronic digital computers. All data analysis was done on Hollerith-type card machines.\n\nActually Britain was far ahead of the US in developing commercial computers. Just look at the history of LEO. Britain also pioneered practical computers such as EDSAC which is the forerunner for all today's computers and can bee seen at the National Museum of Computer, located on the Bletchley Park Estate. Spend 3 hours there and see the Harwell Dekatron - the world's oldest original working computer.\n\nWhile there see a working Enigma/Bombe and the Lorenz/Colossus.\n\nMy advice is to see TNMoC first then another pop down to Bletchley Park for a brief tour to see the Mansion and other interesting facts about their role in the the second world war."
