        "text": "Many of the code samples provided here have a leading main:( and a matching ) at the end. These are not actually required in the language, but are included so as to highlight the main routine.\n\nOn some compilers, it may be necessary to include appropriate \"job cards\" or preludes in order for the programs to compile successfully. Hopefully not too much else is required. Examples:\n\nAlphabets\n\nNotionally, Algol 68 source is written in two alphabets. The reserved words, mode indicants (type names) and operators that are non-symbolic (.e.g. and, or, ...) are generally referred to as \"bold words\" and usually shown in a bold font in literature. Words that are identifiers (used for \"variable\" names, procedure names, structure member names, ...) are in a separate, non-bold font.\n\nThe Manual for CMU ALGOL 68S (on softwarepreservation.org) refers to the non-bold words as being in timid face.\n\nExamples of different program representations\n\nAt the time when ALGOL 68 was defined some predominant computers had 24 or 36 bit words, with 6 bit character sets. Hence it was desirable that ALGOL 68 should be able to run on machines with only uppercase. As multiple fonts were generally unavailable, a method of identifying the bold words was required.\n\nThe official spec provided for different representations of the same program. Quote stropping (enclosing the bold words in single quotes) and Point stropping (preceeding the bold words with a dot) were used.\n\nA variant of Point stropping called RES stropping was also defined. In RES stropping some language-defined bold words are not preceded by a dot.\n\nA pragmatic comment may have been required to indicate which stropping convention was to be used, as in some of the examples below.\n\nUpper stropping (representing the bold words by upper case and non-bold words in lower case) was introduced by Algol 68R.\n\nUpper stropping is used by Algol 68RS and is one of the options for Algol 68G.\n\nRutgers ALGOL 68 uses quote stropping.\n\nMost of the samples on Rosetta Code use Upper stropping.\n\nExamples (pragmatic comments to set the stropping regime not shown):"
