It is intended to to be a correct and complete implementation of the language described in the Algol W Language Description, June 1972. Awe should be able to compile code intended for the System/360 ALGOLW and XALGOLW compilers with little or no modification. Awe uses Gnu C (with its extensions) as an intermediate language. It allows Algol W programs to be linked to C object code. Installion instructions are in the file INSTALL. The manuals are in the file awe.txt and man pages awe.1 and awe.mk.7. You will also require a copy of the Algol W Language Description.
