        "text": "Many of the features of currently popular programming languages, such as C, C++, Java, and JavaScript, were first implemented in the Algol programming language. Ask a programmer using a language such as C++, Java, or JavaScript which language influenced their current programming language and they will probably say C, since the syntax for that language is mostly the same syntax C uses. But not many programmers know what languages influenced the development of C.\n\nThe language that had the most influence on C, through a couple of intermediate steps, is Algol. In this and my next article, I’m going to discuss many features of the programming languages we use today and how and why they were first implemented in Algol.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about this history, you should consult the book I used in my research, “History of Programming Languages,” edited by Richard L. Wexelblat. This book compiles the sessions from the SIGPLAN History of Programming Languages conference. I used the chapters from the Fortran session and the Algol session in my research.\n\nA Brief History of…"
