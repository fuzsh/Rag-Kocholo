        "text": "ALGOL, computer programming language designed by an international committee of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), led by Alan J. Perlis of Carnegie Mellon University, during 1958–60 for publishing algorithms, as well as for doing computations. Like LISP, ALGOL had recursive subprograms—procedures that could invoke themselves to solve a problem by reducing it to a smaller problem of the same kind. ALGOL introduced block structure, in which a program is composed of blocks that might contain both data and instructions and have the same structure as an entire program. Block structure became a powerful tool for building large programs out of small components.\n\nALGOL contributed a notation for describing the structure of a programming language, Backus–Naur Form, which in some variation became the standard tool for stating the syntax (grammar) of programming languages. ALGOL was widely used in Europe, and for many years it remained the language in which computer algorithms were published. Many important languages, such as Pascal, are its descendants."
