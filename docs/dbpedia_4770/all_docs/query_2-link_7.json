W. Carr III, president of ACM (Association for Computing Machinery), that a joint ACM-GAMM conference be held to design a common algorithmic language.\n\n1958 April\n\nF. L. Bauer presented the GAMM proposal to the ACM group at a meeting in Philadelphia.\n\n1958 May 27-June 2\n\nThe GAMM-ACM ALGOL 58 conference was held in Zűrich, producing the ALGOL 58 report.\n\n1959\n\nProposals for improvements to the ALGOL 58 report were published in Communications of the ACM, Volume 2, and/or the ALGOL Bulletin, Number 7.\n\n1959 November\n\nThe GAMM subcommittee held a preliminary meeting in Paris, attended by 50 people from Western Europe, to select 7 delegates for the final ALGOL conference. The ACM subcommittee had a similar meeting in Washington, D.C. to select 7 delegates (Tragically, the American delegate William Turanski was killed in a car accident just before the Paris conference.)\n\n1960 January 11-16\n\nThe ALGOL 60 conference was held in Paris, producing the ALGOL 60 report.\n\n1962 April 2-3\n\nA formal ALGOL meeting to resolve inconsistencies was held in Rome, where many of the participants were planning to attend an IFIP meeting. The resulting ALGOL 60 revised report was approved by IFIP, which had assumed responsibility for ALGOL maintenance and development.\n\nAugust 1962 - March 1964\n\nIFIP Working Group 2.1 held meetings in Munich, Delft, and Tutzing, starting with a review of subsets SMALGOL and ALCOR and culminating with the decision for the features to be included in the official IFIP SUBSET ALGOL 60.\n\nMay 1965\n\nWG 2.1 met in Princeton and invited written descriptions of a successor to ALGOL 60, based on discussions that had taken place since 1963.\n\nOctober 1965\n\nWG 2.1 met in St. Pierre de Chartreuse (near Grenoble) and considered three reports describing \"more or less complete languages\" [Wirth, October 1965], [Seegműller 1965], and [van Wijngaarden 1965]. Also presented were [Hoare 1965], [Naur 1964], and [Naur 1965].\n\nApril 1966 - December 1968\n\nAt WG 2.1 meetings in Kootwijk (in the Netherlands), Warsaw, Zandvoort (near Amsterdam),Tirrenia (near Pisa), North Berwick (near Edinburgh), and Munich successive iterations of the final report were discussed: [ALGOL X draft proposal, ALGOL 67 draft proposal, ALGOL 68 draft proposal, ALGOL 68 draft report, ALGOL 68 working document, ALGOL 68 penultimate draft report, and ALGOL 68 final draft report]\n\n1969\n\nIFIP approved [ALGOL 68 report]\n\n1975\n\nIFIP approved [ALGOL 68 revised report]\n\n1976\n\nIFIP approved [ALGOL 60 modified report]\n\n1977\n\nIFIP approved [ALGOL 68 sublanguage] and [ALGOL 68 standard hardware representation]\n\nOther ALGOL resources\n\nALGOL Bulletin\n\n\"The ALGOL Bulletin, the European medium for disseminating ALGOL intensive matters, was established at a subsequent European conference in Copenhagen in 1959, and the first of its issues appeared that March. Peter Naur of the Danish Regnecentralen was its first editor.\" [Perlis, HOPL paper, 1981]\n\nALGOL Bulletin. Issue 1 (March 1959) through Issue 52 (August 1988). Peter Naur, editor.

Scanned reproduction by Brian Wichmann.\n\nOnline at Computer History Museum (CHM)\n\nACM Digital Library (free web account required for access)\n\nIFIP Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi\n\nIFIP Working Group 2.1 was established in 1962. Its aim is \"to explore and evaluate new ideas in the field of programming, possibly leading to the design of new languages.\" It has held continuing responsibility for ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68 since its founding, although its current focus is the study of calculation of programs from specifications.\n\nIFIP Working Group 2.1.
