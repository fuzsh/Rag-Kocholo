        "text": "Programming Languages\n\nDear reader (especially those from Computer Science, Electronics Engineering and Physics),\n\nAnother topic that I will try to write about under the Software section will be about Programming Languages since itâ€™s strictly related to it. ðŸ˜‰\n\nOn the last 70 years dozens of computer programming languages were created. Some of them were designed for a specific purpose, others were used in a more general context. Also, many of them are still used today around the world while some of them were abandoned in detriment of more useful and powerful ones.\n\nJust to have an idea how many computer programming languages were invented, a list including the most famous ones and the year when they were created is shown below:\n\n1951 â€“ Regional Assembly Language\n\n1952 â€“ Autocode\n\n1954 â€“ IPL (forerunner to LISP)\n\n1955 â€“ FLOW-MATIC (led to COBOL)\n\n1957 â€“ FORTRAN (First compiler)\n\n1957 â€“ COMTRAN (precursor to COBOL)\n\n1958 â€“ LISP\n\n1958 â€“ ALGOL 58\n\n1959 â€“ FACT (forerunner to COBOL)\n\n1959 â€“ COBOL\n\n1959 â€“ RPG\n\n1962 â€“ APL\n\n1962 â€“ Simula\n\n1962 â€“ SNOBOL\n\n1963 â€“ CPL (forerunner to C)\n\n1964 â€“ Speakeasy (computational environment)\n\n1964 â€“ BASIC\n\n1964 â€“ PL/I\n\n1966 â€“ JOSS\n\n1967 â€“ BCPL (forerunner to C)\n\n1968 â€“ Logo\n\n1969 â€“ B (forerunner to C)\n\n1970 â€“ Pascal\n\n1970 â€“ Forth\n\n1972 â€“ C\n\n1972 â€“ Smalltalk\n\n1972 â€“ Prolog\n\n1973 â€“ ML\n\n1975 â€“ Scheme\n\n1978 â€“ SQL (a query language, later extended)\n\n1980 â€“ C++ (as C with classes, renamed in 1983)\n\n1983 â€“ Ada\n\n1984 â€“ Common Lisp\n\n1984 â€“ MATLAB\n\n1985 â€“ Eiffel\n\n1986 â€“ Objective-C\n\n1986 â€“ Erlang\n\n1987 â€“ Perl\n\n1988 â€“ Tcl\n\n1988 â€“ Wolfram Language\n\n1989 â€“ FL (Backus)\n\n1990 â€“ Haskell\n\n1991 â€“ Python\n\n1991 â€“ Visual Basic\n\n1993 â€“ Ruby\n\n1993 â€“ Lua\n\n1994 â€“ CLOS (part of ANSI Common Lisp)\n\n1995 â€“ Ada 95\n\n1995 â€“ Java\n\n1995 â€“ Delphi (Object Pascal)\n\n1995 â€“ JavaScript\n\n1995 â€“ PHP\n\n1997 â€“ Rebol\n\n1999 â€“ D\n\n2000 â€“ ActionScript\n\n2001 â€“ C#\n\n2003 â€“ Groovy\n\n2003 â€“ Scala\n\n2005 â€“ F#\n\n2006 â€“ Windows PowerShell\n\n2007 â€“ Clojure\n\n2009 â€“ Go\n\n2011 â€“ Dart\n\n2012 â€“ Julia\n\n2014 â€“ Swift\n\n2015 â€“ Rust\n\nItâ€™s quite a lot, isnâ€™t it? ðŸ™‚\n\nThe programming languages cited above that are enhanced in bold and green color are the ones that I intend, initially, to write about in the future. My idea is to explain them in parallel using similar examples or problems to show the main differences between the programming languages (including their advantages and disadvantages).\n\nTherefore, you like to code or even if you never had programmed in your life but would like to, I invite to take a look here from time to time. I do hope that we both can share and learn new things about the wonderful world of programming languages!\n\nIf you want to read more about the History of Programming Languages I suggest the Wikipedia link below:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_programming_languages\n\nThatâ€™s all for now. In the next article related to Programming Languages I will write a little bit more about them (an example: why Eiffel language was created and what applications can benefit from using it?).\n\nBest Regards from Japan.\n\nPS. For those already familiar with programming languages I suggest you to read the cartoon below carefullyâ€¦ ðŸ™‚"
