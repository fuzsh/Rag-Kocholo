        "text": "Algol 60 Compiler\n\nThis compiler translates a program written in Algol 60 into C code, which can then be compiled with a C compiler. (The author uses the GNU C compiler, probably Mingw-w64, so if you are not sure which to choose, try that first.) The program is distributed in source form (under the GNU General Public License), and you will have to compile it first before using it. It works under Windows and Linux.\n\nAlgol 68 Genie\n\nAlgol 68 Genie (Algol68G) is an Algol 68 interpreter released under the GNU General Public License. According to the site, it is a \"nearly full implementation of Algol 68\" with some deviations from the Revised Report 1976 and some extensions. The implementation includes a check-out interpreter with many runtime checks, optional graphical procedures using the GNU Plotting Utilities, optional numeric procedures using the GNU Scientific Library, parallel clause for systems that support POSIX threads (eg, Linux, UNIX), UNIX extensions for systems that support them, etc. Precompiled binaries are available for Windows, MacOS, Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris.\n\nRHA (Minisystems) Ltd's Algol60 Compiler and Interpreter\n\nThis compiler and interpreter runs on MSDOS and CP/M. Your source code is compiled into intermediate code which is run on a virtual machine. This MSDOS version is free for personal use.\n\nPersistent S-algol\n\nThis is a dialect of S-Algol, written in Pascal. It comes with a Borland style IDE, generation of native code, garbage collection, graphics classes, class hierarchy with inheritance mechanisms. The program is only available in source code form, and requires Turbo Pascal to compile."
