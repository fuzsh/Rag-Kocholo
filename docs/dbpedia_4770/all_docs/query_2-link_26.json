        "text": "Nothing like responding to 2 year old threads. I program in ALGOL almost daily. I am a programmer on a Unisys ClearPath mainframe and the majority of the system code is written in ALGOL or variants. The Burroughs B5500 was really designed around the language so it is a pretty efficient language/compilation process. Granted, this version is ALGOL with some extensions like limited classes (structure blocks), etc.\n\ni := 80; while i > 0 do begin scan ptrRay:ptrRay for i:i until in ALPHA; scan ptrEnd:ptrRay for i:i while in ALPHA; if i > 0 then begin replace nextToken by ptrRay for (offset(ptrEnd) - offset(ptrRay)); end; end;\n\nThat code scans for ALPHA only tokens. It uses the OFFSET function which is a little more costly than using the residual count math yourself (i, starti, etc);\n\nAlgol58 seems to have been the most successful in terms of important applications.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nJOVIAL is an acronym for \"Jules Own Version of the International Algorithmic Language.\" The \"International Algorithmic Language\" was a name originally proposed for ALGOL 58. It was developed to compose software for the electronics of military aircraft by Jules Schwartz in 1959.\n\nThen:\n\nNotable systems using JOVIAL include the Milstar Communications Satellite, Advanced Cruise Missile, B-52, B-1B, B-2 bombers, C-130, C-141, and C-17 transport aircraft, F-111, F-15, F-16 (prior to Block 50), and F-117 fighter aircraft, LANTIRN, U-2 aircraft, E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft, Navy Aegis cruisers, Army Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, F100, F117, and F119 jet engines, the NORAD air defense & control system (Hughes HME-5118ME system) and RL-10 rocket engines. Airborne radar systems with embedded JOVIAL software include the APG-70, APG-71 and APG-73\n\nALGOL 68 was used in part of DRA for the same purpose. cf. Wikipedia:\n\nThe '''Defence Research Agency''' (normally known as '''DRA'''), was an executive agency of the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) from April 1991 until April 1995. At the time the DRA was Britain's largest science and technology organisation.\n\nDRA's Algol68 compiler was finally open-sourced in April 1999 and is now available for linux for download from sourceforge. (However an interpreter for \"Algol68g\" is easier to use).\n\nICL's Algol68 was/is S3 - It was developed by the UK company International Computers Limited (ICL) for its 2900 Series mainframes. It is a system programming language based on ALGOL 68 but with data types and operators aligned to those offered by the 2900 Series. It was the implementation language of the operating system VME.\n\nThere are (at least) two other British operating systems - Flex and Cambridge_CAP_computer - written in Algol68 variants. And also 1 Soviet OS: Эльбрус-1 (Elbrus-1), but I have yet to find any of their source code. (If anyone can find and distribute to this source code please let me know)\n\nBTW: I believe that VME is still running - in production - as a Linux/Unixware guest VM. Mostly at Commonwealth of Nations Custom/Immigration services.\n\nAlso over the same period the USSR was using Algol68, c.f. history link. Algol68 is used in Russian telephone exchanges. And Algol58 was used in the Russian \"Buran/Буран\" Space Shuttle landing system.\n\nALGOL68 was internationalized in 1968. I suspect there are other Algol projects in other countries. esp in German, in Dutch Japanese and Chinese but I have no details.\n\nIf you want to actually tryout Algol68 and/or contribute your code, check out Rosettacode's ALGOL 68 repository, then as a class project try one of the \"Tasks not implemented\".\n\nHowever, what's unclear is, was Algol (pure Algol, not any of its derivatives like Simula) ever actually used for any \"real\" programming in any way?\n\nPlease, avoid the term \"real\" programming. \"Real\" - as opposed to what ? Imaginative ?\n\nBy \"real\", I mean used for several good-sized projects other than programming language/CS research, or by a significant number of developers (say, > 1000).\n\nYes. It was used for a certain number of projects on which worked a certain number of developers.\n\nOnly, what is usually misinterpreted often today is this; in those days computers weren't exactly a household commodity. Hell, they weren't that 30 years ago, less alone 60.\n\nProgramming was done in computer centres which were either in goverment ownership (military, academic, institutes of various kinds) or in private enterprises (large companies). And programming wasn't a profession - it was something which engineers, mathematicians, scientiscs and the like used to do when their work was done on paper ... or they had specialized operators which did it for them. Often women, who may or may have not had a scientific background in that particular field - they were \"language translators\", in lack of a better term (and my bad english).\n\nProgramming theories and research was at its beginnings ... vendors being few (and naturally uncooperative to each other) ... each of them used their own extensions, and often programs written for one didn't work well with the other vendor's systems.\n\nThere wasn't a \"right way\" to do something ... you had that and that, and you used whatever catch you could figure to work around your problem.\n\nBut, I've wandered off. Let me get back to the number of people. This also goes for several other languages; fortran and cobol, for example. People say, \"very few use it\". That's simply not true. What is true is that a small percentage of people uses it today, but a larger percent of people used to use it.\n\nAs I said, in those days only the sci. and eng. community used to do it. And their number was relatively small, compared to the total population. Nowadays, everybody uses computers, but the absolute number of engineers, mathematicians and the like, is pretty much the same. So it seems that nobody uses those languages anymore ... while in reality, for certain specialized languages (well, nowadays this goes for fortran and cobol, more than algol) the number of users is pretty much constant.\n\nPersonally, the only Algol programming I have ever done was on paper, thus the curiosity.\n\nI know I didn't answer your question, but just wanted to clear this. Algol was a little \"beofre my time\"."
