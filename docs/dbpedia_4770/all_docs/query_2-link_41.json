He notes:\n\nI recently created an ALGOL section at the Computer History Museumâ€™s Software Preservation Group web site, covering the language standardization efforts â€” for ALGOL 58 (also known as the International Algebraic Language), ALGOL 60, and ALGOL 68 â€” and also covering many implementations, dialects, and offshoots, complete with source code, manuals, and papers for many of these. The history of ALGOL has attracted many writers, and the final section of the web site links to many of their papers.\n\nAlso see his follow up blog about Whetstone ALGOL.\n\nComment viewing options\n\nSelect your preferred way to display the comments and click \"Save settings\" to activate your changes."
