        "text": "Why is Algol the Demon Star?\n\nWhat’s the scariest star in the sky? If you were one of the early stargazers, you might have chosen Algol in the constellation Perseus. That is probably why early astronomers nicknamed Algol the Demon Star. Shivers!\n\nWhen you look at Algol, it doesn’t appear any scarier than any other star. But in skylore it’s associated with a mythical scary monster – the Gorgon Medusa – who had snakes for hair. Legend said that her appearance was so terrifying that if anyone even looked at her, they would turn to stone.\n\nThe star Algol takes its name from an Arabic word meaning the Demon’s Head or, literally the Ghoul. It represents the terrifying snaky head of the Medusa monster.\n\nPerseus was a great hero often depicted mounted on Pegasus the Flying Horse. In the mythology of the skies, Perseus slew Medusa. Then, he used Medusa’s head to his advantage, showing it to Cetus the Sea-monster to turn him into stone. So, perhaps the ancients associated this star’s variable brightness with the evil, winking eye of the Medusa.\n\nThe 2024 lunar calendars are here! Best Christmas gifts in the universe! Check ’em out here.\n\nAlgol is a variable star\n\nWinking? Yes. In fact, Algol is a known variable star, which waxes and wanes in brightness.\n\nThe early stargazers surely knew about its changing brightness. This probably led them to name the strangely behaving star in the sky for a mythological demon.\n\nThere are many variable stars known throughout the heavens, but Algol might well be the most famous of them all. The Demon Star brightens and dims with clockwork regularity. It completes one cycle in 2 days, 20 hours and 49 minutes. Plus, you can view its entire cycle with your eye alone.\n\nAlgol’s variation is easy to observe. At its brightest, Algol shines about three times more brightly than at its faintest. When it reaches maximum brilliance, Algol matches the brightness of the nearby second-magnitude star Almach. At minimum, Algol’s light output fades to that of the star Epsilon Persei.\n\nModern-day astronomy has unlocked the secret of Algol’s mood swings. It’s an eclipsing binary star. This kind of binary star is composed of two stars, with each star revolving around the other. From Earth, we see the orbital plane of this binary star almost exactly edge-on. Therefore, when the dimmer of the two stars swings in front of the brighter star, we see Algol at minimum brightness.\n\nHow to find Algol the Demon Star\n\nThe Demon Star is easy to find. Our sky chart shows the northeastern sky for autumn evenings, especially around Halloween.\n\nThe conspicuous W or M-shaped constellation Cassiopeia enables you to star-hop to Perseus. Look below Cassiopeia toward the horizon to spot the dangling icicle shape of Perseus. Off to the right of the icicle is Algol. At mid-northern latitudes, the Demon Star appears for at least part of the night all year round. But it’s best seen in the evening sky from autumn to spring. It’s visible in the northeast sky in autumn, shines high overhead in winter, then swings to the northwest sky by spring.\n\nBottom line: Algol has the nickname the Demon Star because it represents the head of Medusa. This variable star probably intrigued the ancients with its fluctuating behavior."
