Our new tree resulted from a planned hybridization program and is a selection from crossing âPCFW2-134â (unpatented) as the seed parent with âPR1 669-205â, an unpatented apple tree, as the pollen parent (see FIG. 1). The original cross was performed in 1971 in New Jersey. The resulting tree was selected when growing in a cultivated area in West Lafayette, Ind.\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe âCO-OP 39â variety is distinguished from other apple varieties due to the following unique combination of characteristics: resistance to apple scab; very crisp flesh and excellent dessert quality; very attractive color (almost completely red); ripens in the middle of September in West Lafayette, Ind.; size varies from 2.75 to 3 inches in diameter; and good storage ability (can be stored up to six months at 1Â° C.).\n\nAsexual reproduction of this new variety by grafting and budding onto rootstock [âMalling 7â (unpatented) rootstocks] shows that the foregoing characteristics come true to form, are firmly fixed, and are established and transmitted through succeeding propagations.\n\nThe following detailed description concerns the original tree, selected on Sep. 18, 1979, and progeny first asexually propagated in 1980. The original tree and progeny have been observed growing in a cultivated area in West Lafayette, Ind.\n\nCertain characteristics of this variety may change with changing environmental conditions (such as photoperiod, temperature, moisture, soil conditions, nutrient availability, or other factors). For example, leaf colors may be brighter green if the trees are grown in soil with greater nitrogen concentrations, and may be more yellow when grown in soil containing lesser amounts of nitrogen. Color descriptions and other terminology are used in accordance with their ordinary dictionary descriptions, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Color designations (hue/value/chroma) are made with reference to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart (R.H.S.).\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nFIG. 1 is a photograph showing typical fruit and leaves of the new variety.\n\nFIG. 2 is a photograph showing a tree of the new variety.\n\nThe accompanying color photographs shows typical specimens of the leaves and fruit and tree of this new apple tree variety and depict the color as nearly true as is reasonably possible to make the same in a color illustration of this character. It should be noted that colors may vary, for example due to lighting conditions at the time the photograph is taken. Therefore, color characteristics of this new variety should be determined with reference to the observations described herein, rather than from the photographs alone.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\nBOTANICAL\n\nThe following detailed description of the âCO-OP 39â (Crimson Crisp) variety is based on observations of asexually reproduced progeny.
