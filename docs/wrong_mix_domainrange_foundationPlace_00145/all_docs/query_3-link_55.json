        "text": "Photo via Apple Inc.\n\nWhy Is Apple Called Apple?\n\nThe origin of Apple's name has been a topic of speculation for many years. Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, revealed in Walter Isaacson’s biography that the name was chosen while he was on a fruitarian diet, and the name “Apple” was inspired by his visit to an apple farm. Jobs found the name “fun, spirited and not intimidating.” Steve Wozniak, Jobs’ co-founder, remembers Jobs suggesting the name after a visit to an “apple orchard.” Image credit: Apple Inc. Another popular theory is that the bite taken out of the Apple logo was inspired by Alan Turing, the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. It's said that Turing died after biting into an apple laced with cyanide. However, Rob Janoff, the creator of the famous logo, stated that the bite was intended to show the size of the apple and differentiate it from other fruits. Although Apple didn’t intend to commemorate Turing, Jobs once told Stephen Fry that he wished it had.\n\nIn the 1970s, many companies chose names that appeared near the front of the phone book, to increase their visibility to customers. With the name Apple, the new computer company would appear ahead of Atari, where Jobs used to work. Jobs confirmed this theory in an 1980 presentation, stating that the name was partly chosen because he liked apples and partly because Apple was ahead of Atari in the phone book. Image credit: Apple Inc. Another theory is that Apple represents Isaac Newton, who discovered gravity after an apple fell on his head. The original Apple logo featured a picture of Isaac Newton sitting under the Apple tree, and was designed by Steve Jobs. However, this logo was quickly replaced by the colorful apple with a bite taken out of it. Jobs made a connection to Newton and included a quote from a poem by Wordsworth, indicating that he felt a connection with the scientist. Image credit: Apple Inc. There is also a theory that the apple with the bite taken out of it represents the apple from the Garden of Eden. The bite of the forbidden fruit from the tree of knowledge is said to have led to Adam and Eve's enlightenment, and computers are seen as a tool for enlightenment. However, this theory lacks evidence.\n\nThere have been suggestions that Jobs chose the name Apple because of his admiration for the Beatles and their label, Apple Corps. However, Wozniak claims that Jobs chose the name despite the existence of the Beatles label. The name stuck because they couldn’t come up with anything better. Apple and Apple Corps were involved in multiple legal disputes, which culminated in 2006 at the High Court of Justice over the existence of the iTunes Music Store. The court ruled in favor of Apple Computer.\n\nIn conclusion, there are several theories behind the origin of Apple's name, but the truth is that Jobs and Wozniak simply couldn't come up with a better name. Regardless of its origin, the name Apple has become synonymous with innovation and quality, and the company has made a significant impact on the world of technology.\n\nRecommended by the editors:\n\nSecrets Revealed: Surprising Facts About the Creation of the Apple iPhone\n\nThe Evolution of Apple's Chip Design: From A-Series to M-Series\n\n18 Mind-Blowing Facts About the Apple Macintosh That Will Leave You Amazed\n\nHow Apple's Ecosystem Creates Seamless User Experiences (And Gets Them Sued)\n\nThe History and Future of Apple's Mac Computers (1984-2024)\n\nTap here to explore more news and insightful journalism from Apple Scoop — America's most-beloved independently operated source for all things Apple\n\nThank you for visiting Apple Scoop!
