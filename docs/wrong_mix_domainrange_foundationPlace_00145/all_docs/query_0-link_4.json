        "text": "Driving\n\nMaps gives you at-a-glance information to make every drive a good one. Route planning provides ETAs for future departures based on expected traffic. As you drive, you see real-time traffic, current speed limits, and nearby speed cameras. Turn lanes, bike, bus, and taxi lanes, medians, and crosswalks are displayed in incredible detail. When you approach a complex intersection, Maps switches to a 3D road-level perspective to simplify what’s ahead. Lane guidance prepares you for turns and exits, so you can avoid wrong turns and missed exits. If you drive an electric vehicle, Maps can assess your charge level, elevation, and compatible charging stops along your route.\n\nTransit\n\nGetting around town is a snap with Maps. See real-time information about transit arrival and departure times, outages, current locations of buses and trains, and connections. You can even be alerted when you’re approaching your stop. Nearby departures are just a tap away, and you can pin your favorite lines so the closest ones always show up at the top.\n\nSee where Transit is available\n\nWalking\n\nUse augmented reality and Indoor Maps to stay on point when you’re on foot. Just raise your iPhone to scan the buildings in the area, and Maps will show step-by-step guidance in augmented reality. You can also use Indoor Maps to easily find your way around major airports and shopping centers all over the world. See which restaurants are past security at the airport, where the nearest restroom is, or what floor your favorite store is on at the mall.\n\nSee where Indoor Maps is available\n\nCycling\n\nKeep rolling with cycling directions that include an elevation profile of your route. Maps will let you know if there’s a steep incline along your way, if you need to carry your bike up stairs, or if there’s a safer, easier route that avoids busy roads. And with voice guidance and Haptic Feedback on Apple Watch, you can stay even more focused on the path ahead.\n\nLook Around\n\nExplore select cities with an interactive 3D street-level experience and a smooth, seamless 360‑degree view. Use Look Around to scope out the parking situation by that hot new brunch place, locate landmarks near a meet-up spot, or get a feel for the neighborhoods in a new city. Precise views let you know what to expect when you get there — so you can make the most of every outing.\n\nPlace Cards\n\nChoose a destination, and its interactive place card shows you everything you need at a glance. See basics like address, hours, website, and phone number, along with details like price range, photo galleries, associated Guides, accepted payment types — even whether you can bring your dog. Launch Flyover or Look Around to get a sense of the location and surroundings. You can even quickly and securely rent a bike, pay for parking, order food, and more with just a tap. And for places that use Business Chat, you can reach out and ask questions directly in Messages.\n\nSearch\n\nIt’s quick and easy to find just what you’re looking for in Maps. Use ultra-targeted filters to search for restaurants by cuisine, price range, and whether they offer takeout. Or choose to see only places that are open right now. Want to broaden your search? Just move the map, and your search results update automatically. Want something closer to home? Tap Nearby to find local places in categories like Restaurants, Gas Stations, Coffee, Hotels, Bars, Fast Food, Groceries, and Shopping Centers. Locations are displayed on the map with colorful badges, making it even easier to pinpoint your picks.\n\nFlyover\n\nGet a whole new perspective on select major metro areas with photo‑realistic, immersive 3D views. Move your iPhone or iPad through space to experience a city from above, or take a closer look at cities and their landmarks in high resolution as you zoom, pan, tilt, and rotate. It’s exploration elevated.\n\nSee where Flyover is available\n\nGuides\n\nGuides help you find amazing things to see and do in cities around the world. Just tap the Explore Guides button to access nearly 1000 expertly curated Guides, and find and save the ones that catch your eye. Curated Guides automatically update when new places are added, so you always have the latest recommendations at your fingertips. You can also create your own Guides and share them with friends and family.\n\nEditorial Experts\n\nWe’ve partnered with some of the most trusted and experienced names in travel and publishing to create distinctive collections of must‑see city attractions. Current Guides are constantly being updated, and new ones are always on the way — so you’re sure to find the latest and greatest, wherever you go.\n\nSeamless Experience\n\nEnjoy a smooth, uninterrupted experience across all the Apple devices you use to get around. Haptic Feedback on Apple Watch nudges you in the right direction so you don’t have to get out your iPhone when you’re on foot or on your bike. Calendar alerts on your Mac let you know when it’s time to stop working and go. Just say the word, and HomePod finds directions and sends them to your iPhone on your way out the door. And Maps also syncs automatically with Siri, Spotlight, Messages, and Weather to give you relevant information at all the right moments.\n\nCarPlay\n\nCarPlay brings the power and simplicity of Maps behind the wheel. It can make intelligent suggestions based on data you already store on your device, like addresses from your email, text messages, contacts, and calendars. And with a detailed map, turn‑by‑turn spoken directions, and immersive 3D experiences, it’s easier than ever to get where you need to go.\n\nIssues and Incidents\n\nIncorrect lunch hours listed at your favorite cafe? Old mattress in the middle of the highway? Whatever issue you encounter, it’s fast and easy to report it in Maps. Edit and submit updated information about a business directly in the place card interface. And report an accident, hazard, or speed check safely and easily with Siri. Just say “There’s an accident up ahead” or “There’s something on the road” and Siri will file the incident for you. If an incident displayed on the map has been cleared, you can report that, too — all while keeping your hands free and your focus on the road.\n\nSettings\n\nOpen Maps and tap your user account photo at the bottom of the screen to see your most used settings — like preferred mode of transit, reported issues, and favorites — all in one place. And when you open Maps on your devices or on your dashboard with CarPlay, it displays the places you visit most — so you’re always just a tap away from home, work, the gym, your kid’s school, the nearest gas station, or your favorite restaurant.\n\nData Protection\n\nMaps delivers a great experience without Apple knowing which stores, neighborhoods, or clinics you visit. Because Maps doesn’t include a sign-in, where you go isn’t associated with your Apple ID at all. And personalized features, like locating your parked car, are created right on your device. Data used to improve navigation, such as routes and search terms, is not associated with your identity. Instead, that information is based on random identifiers that are constantly changing."
