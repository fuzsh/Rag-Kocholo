But now, the tech giant seems to be losing its luster as it faces a sharp drop in iPhone sales in China, a nearly $2 billion fine from the EU, and an anti-trust lawsuit from the US Department of Justice, amid other woes.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nSo, how did one of the most influential tech companies in the world find itself in this position?\n\nHere's a look into the history of Apple in photos, from its inception, through its hard times, to the triumphant return of Jobs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple was cofounded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in Los Altos, California.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a third cofounder, too: Ronald Wayne.\n\nJobs brought Wayne on board to provide business guidance for the two young cofounders.\n\nWayne sketched the first Apple logo by hand.\n\nThe cofounder ended up leaving the company before it was even officially incorporated. He took an $800 check for his shares in the company.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple's first \"office\" was the garage at Jobs' parents' house.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company's first product was the Apple I, which was just a motherboard with a processor and some memory, intended for hobbyists.\n\nCustomers had to build their own case and add their own keyboard and monitor, as seen in the picture above.\n\nIt sold for $666.66 — seriously.\n\nThe Apple I was invented by Wozniak, who also hand-built every kit.\n\nMeanwhile, Jobs handled the business end, mainly trying to convince would-be investors that the personal computer market was primed to explode.\n\nSource: CNET\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEventually, Jobs would bring in Mike Markkula, who made a crucial $250,000 angel investment and came to work for Apple as employee No. 3, with a one-third share in the company.\n\nApple would officially incorporate in 1977, thanks to guidance from Markkula.\n\nSource: The New York Times, CNBC\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarkkula later suggested Apple to bring in a man named Michael Scott (no, not the one from \"The Office\") to serve as the company's first president and CEO.\n\nThe thought was that Jobs was too young and undisciplined to serve as CEO.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1977 also saw the introduction of the Apple II, the personal computer designed by Wozniak that would go on to take the world by storm.\n\nThe Apple II's killer app was VisiCalc, a groundbreaking spreadsheet software that propelled the computer ahead of market leaders Tandy and Commodore.\n\nWith VisiCalc, Apple could sell the Apple II to the business customer.\n\nSource: National Museum of American History\n\nBy 1978, Apple would actually have a real office, with employees and an Apple II production line.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Xerox PARC lab is world-famous for its technological accomplishments, which include the laser printer, mouse, and ethernet networking.\n\nIn 1979, Apple engineers were allowed to visit the PARC campus for three days, in exchange for the option to buy 100,000 shares of Apple for $10 a share.\n\nA year later, Apple released the Apple III, a business-focused computer that was supposed to compete with the growing threat of IBM and Microsoft.\n\nBut the Apple III was only a stopgap, and Xerox PARC had gotten the young Jobs thinking in a different direction.\n\nSource: Newsweek , Byte Magazine\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXerox PARC convinced Jobs that the future of computing was with a graphical user interface (GUI), like the kind we're used to today.\n\nJobs spearheaded the effort to equip Apple's next-generation Lisa computer with a GUI, but was bumped from the project thanks to infighting.\n\nLisa was released in 1983 to much fanfare, but disastrous sales — it was too expensive and didn't have enough software support.\n\nSource: Newsweek, CNBC\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAround the time of the launch of the first Macintosh in 1983, Apple got a new CEO: John Sculley.\n\nSculley was serving as Pepsi's youngest-ever CEO, but Jobs managed to bring him to Apple with the now-legendary pitch: \"Do you want to sell sugared water for the rest of your life? Or do you want to come with me and change the world?\"\n\nSource: Forbes\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1984, Apple would release the TV commercial that would make it a household name.\n\nThis ad, appropriately called \"1984,\" was directed by Ridley Scott and cost the company $1.5 million. It aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII, and never again.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was also when tensions between Jobs and Bill Gates started to run high.\n\nOriginally, Microsoft was working hard at making software for the Macintosh. But those plans were scuttled in 1983 when Microsoft revealed that it, too, was working on a graphical user interface called Windows.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Macintosh had strong sales, but not enough to break IBM's dominance.\n\nThis led to a lot of friction between Jobs — the head of the Macintosh group who liked doing things his own way — and Sculley, who wanted stricter oversight on future products in light of the Lisa disaster and disappointment of the Macintosh.\n\nDifferences between the two leaders got to the point where Apple's board specifically instructed Sculley to \"contain\" Jobs.\n\nSource: Business Insider, Fortune\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThings came to a head in 1985 when Jobs tried to stage a coup and oust Sculley — but Apple's board of directors took Sculley's side and removed Jobs from his managerial duties.\n\nA furious Jobs quit and went on to found NeXT, a computer company making advanced workstations where he had total control.\n\nSource: Fortune, Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWozniak later left and sold most of his shares around the same time in 1985, saying the company was going in the wrong direction.\n\nWith Jobs gone, Sculley had a free hand at Apple.\n\nSource: CNN\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt first, things seemed great, and Apple introduced its PowerBook laptop and System 7 operating system in 1991.\n\nSystem 7 introduced color to the Macintosh operating system, and would stick around (with updates) until OS X was released in 2001.\n\nSource: Engadget, Cult of Mac\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 1990s would see Apple get into lots of new markets, none of which really worked out.\n\nPossibly the most famous Apple flop of the '90s was 1993's Newton MessagePad, which was Sculley's own brainchild.\n\nIt literally created the market for \"personal digital assistants,\" but it was $700 and did little more than take notes and keep track of your contacts.\n\nSource: Baltimore Sun, Time, MacWorld\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Sculley's longest-lasting mistake was in spending lots of time and lots of Apple's cash on bringing System 7 to the brand-new IBM/Motorola PowerPC microprocessor instead of the dominant Intel processor architecture.\n\nMost software was written for Intel processors, plus they got cheaper and cheaper over the years.\n\nSource: Cult of Mac\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, Microsoft's influence was on the rise.\n\nMacs offered an excellent, but limited, library of software on expensive computers.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft was selling Windows 3.0 on cheap, commodity computers.\n\nSource: Microsoft\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter Apple missed on its first quarter earnings in 1993, Sculley stepped down and was replaced as CEO by Michael Spindler, a German expatriate who had been with Apple since 1980.\n\nSpindler had the unfortunate job of following through with Sculley's big PowerPC mistake.\n\nSource: Washington Post, Los Angeles Times\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1994, the first Macintosh running on a PowerPC was released, but Apple's fortunes continued to sag as Windows took off.\n\nAfter acquisition talks with IBM, Sun MicroSystems, and Philips all fell through, Apple's board replaced Spindler with Gil Amelio in 1996.\n\nSource: The New York Times\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmelio's tenure was equally troubled.\n\nUnder his reign, Apple stock hit a 12-year low (largely because Steve Jobs himself sold 1.5 million Apple shares in a single transaction).\n\nAmelio decided to just purchase Jobs' NeXT Computer for $429 million in February 1997 to bring him back to Apple.\n\nSource: CNET, CNET\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the July 4 weekend that same year, Jobs would stage a boardroom coup and convince Apple's board to install him as interim CEO.\n\nAmelio resigned a week later.\n\nSource: The New York Times\n\n1997 would also see the introduction of Apple's famous \"Think Different\" ad campaign, celebrating famous artists, scientists, and musicians.\n\nSource: Cult of Mac\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnder the new era of Jobs' leadership, the company would make nice with Microsoft, which invested $150 million in Apple circa 1997.\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe late 90s were a new era for hardware and software, too.\n\nJobs had Jony Ive spearhead the design of the iMac, an all-in-one computer released in 1998.\n\nIn 2000, Jobs introduced Mac OS X, based on the operating system from NeXT Computers, finally replacing System 7.\n\nAnd in 2006, Apple finally moved to an Intel-based system architecture.\n\nSource: CNET, Apple, Apple\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple had two massively influential product releases in the 2000s, beginning with the iPod in 2001.\n\nIt blew other MP3 players out of the water and radically altered the way we listen to music.\n\nThe iPod also launched Apple's white earbuds as a status symbol.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the single biggest victory for Apple — and arguably the world of technology as a whole — was 2007's introduction of the iPhone.\n\nWhen the iPhone went on sale, customers lined up outside stores in the US to get their hands on one.\n\nSource: Cult of Mac\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince then, Apple has gone on to release 17 more models.\n\nUnder CEO Tim Cook — who took over after Jobs' death in 2011 — Apple has introduced new hardware product lines, including the Apple Watch and AirPods.\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company has also expanded into services, which has helped fuel Apple's growth as iPhone sales have lagged.\n\nApple now offers its own music- and video-streaming services, its own payments system and credit card, and other subscription offerings in news and gaming.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn August 2020, Apple hit a new milestone: It became a $2 trillion company, just 24 months after reaching the $1 trillion threshold.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple's chief design officer Jony Ive left Apple in 2019, setting up his own design shop LoveFrom.\n\nApple said at the time that LoveFrom would be one of his company's \"primary clients.\" The two companies' relationship wound down in 2022, according to The New York Times, which reported there were frustrations on both sides about the arrangement.\n\nSource: Business Insider; The New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple's programming has also received critical nods, including the movie \"CODA\" which is streaming on Apple TV+ and won the Oscar for best picture in the 2022 Academy Awards.\n\nThe beloved Apple comedy series \"Ted Lasso\" also won four Emmys that year.\n\nSource: Apple\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple's second quarter earnings in 2023 showed strong iPhone sales of $51.3 billion, which CEO Tim Cook said in a statement reflected a \"March quarter record\" and a high for its services revenue.\n\nThe company had previously said that pandemic-related delays had affected production of some of its devices, including the iPhone 14 Pro.\n\nSource: Apple earnings report and release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple became the first public company to close with a market cap above $3 trillion in late June 2023 when the stock closed at $193.97.\n\nSource: Insider; Yahoo Finance.\n\nMonths later, Apple's valuation dropped to $2.8 trillion ahead of the iPhone 15 launch in September.\n\nSource: Yahoo\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut some Apple fans were disappointed by the new phone.\n\nFollowing the September launch, some Apple fans said the iPhone 15 appears nearly identical to its most recent predecessors. They claimed its a design choice that reflects Apple's lack of innovation on the smartphone front.\n\nSource:Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree months later, Apple temporarily pulled the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 from its shelves.\n\nThe move came after the International Trade Commission ruled Apple infringed on patents for a blood oxygen tracking feature owned by health-tech firm Masimo.\n\nThe two Apple Watch models' were back on the market a month later, this time without the health monitoring feature.\n\nSources: Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRegulatory action on Apple continued into the following year, this time in Europe.\n\nIn January, Apple was forced to crack open its App Store after the European Commission pushed the company to comply with the Digital Markets Act.\n\nUnder the DMA, third-party app stores will finally be allowed on Apple's iOS operating system in the EU. That would allow developers to distribute their apps beyond the App Store, which takes a cut from app sales.\n\nThe law aims to prevent Big Tech, which the EU calls \"gatekeepers,\" from dominating the digital marketplace.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple also saw iPhone sales slump in China, a major market, at the start of 2024, losing its rank as the top smartphone provider in the country.\n\niPhone sales in China dropped by 24% during the first six weeks of 2024, according to data from Counterpoint Research, as local rivals like Huawei took a greater share of the region's smartphone market.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn February, Apple launched its nearly $3,500 Vision Pro headset, an AI-driven \"mixed-reality\" headset that allows users to toggle between the digital and real worlds.\n\nBut the reception to the Apple Vision Pro has been mixed.\n\nSome initial users expressed awe over the Vision Pro's spatial computing capabilities. Others, however, said the headset's design, blurry screen, and lack of use cases don't justify its hefty price point. These issues may've been what lead some customers to return the product within two weeks after purchase.\n\nSource: Business Insider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowing the Vision Pro release, Apple killed its electric-car weeks later in an effort to shift its focus towards generative AI.\n\nApple worked on its self-driving electric car, a multi-billion dollar effort dubbed \"Project Titan,\" for nearly a decade before deciding to pull the plug, Bloomberg first reported.\n\nExecs told nearly 2,000 employees part of the electric-vehicle team that many would be moved to the company's artificial-intelligence division, per the outlet.\n\nSource: Bloomberg, Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple now appears to be doubling down on its AI strategy, though it's keeping a tight lip.\n\nApple is expected to release the iPhone 16 later this year. It would be the first iteration of the smartphone to include generative AI features. Apple is reportedly in talks with OpenAI and Google as it decides which of the company's large language models to incorporate into the iPhone, sources told Bloomberg.\n\nMeanwhile, the iPhone maker reportedly has plans to launch an AI tool that can write code as early as this year, according to Bloomberg. The company is also reportedly exploring the development of home robotics such as a robot that follows users around their house, per the outlet.\n\nWhile Apple hasn't confirmed these developments, CEO Tim Cook said during the company's fiscal first-quarter earnings call that generative AI is a \"huge opportunity for Apple.\" Cook's remark comes as Apple appears to lag behind tech giants' like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI on the AI front.\n\nThe company is expected to share some news on its latest AI product offerings at a special event on May 7 and at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June.\n\nSources: Bloomberg, Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn yet another blow to the company, the US Department of Justice slammed Apple with a lawsuit in March, accusing the iPhone maker of using anti-competitive tactics to dominate the smartphone market.\n\nIn the suit, the DOJ and 16 attorneys point to everything from the Apple Watch's incompatibility with non-iPhones to the awkward green-bubble text messages sent through Android phones as evidence that Apple uses unfair practices to beat its competitors.\n\nApple denies these accusations.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a rough start to the year, things seem to be looking up for Apple.\n\nApple reported its fiscal second-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street predictions despite concerns around China's iPhone sales.\n\nThe company saw better-than-expected sales in Greater China, though overall iPhone sales were down 10% year-over-year.\n\nMeanwhile, CEO Tim Cook announced on the investor call its biggest-ever stock buyback of $110 billion.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn early May, Apple released its new lineup of iPads — including Pro models with OLED screens for the first time.\n\nApple says the fancy new OLED screens on the latest Pro models provide richer colors and better contrast compared to the screens on the tablet's earlier versions.\n\nThe company also unveiled a new iPad Air, as well as fresh accessories for the iPads like the Pencil Pro stylus and a Magic Keyboard.\n\nThe last major iPad release was in 2022.\n\nSource: Business Insider, Business Insider\n\nRead next\n\nApple iPhone Bill Gates\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement"
