        "text": "Part 1 of this report broke down Apple’s cost-sharing arrangement and explained how corporate taxpayers have been able to exploit the cost-sharing regulations to shift hundreds of billions of dollars or even trillions of dollars in U.S. profits offshore with little or no IRS detection or enforcement. In this report, we undertake a forensic transfer pricing analysis of the evidence disclosed in the U.S. Senate and European Commission investigations of Apple — or provided by the company in filings with those bodies, the SEC, courts, and other sources — regarding its compliance with U.S. transfer pricing laws. We find that Apple could be subject to a U.S. tax adjustment under reg. section 1.482-7(i)(6) that could exceed by several multiples the amount of taxes at issue in the European Commission state aid case (now under appeal) and Apple’s reserves for uncertain tax positions. In this final installment of the report, we discuss that result and the calculations behind it.\n\nIV. Apple’s Periodic Adjustment\n\nCongress adopted the commensurate-with-income standard in 1986 by adding the following sentence to section 482:\n\nIn the case of any transfer (or license) of intangible property (within the meaning of [section 367(d)(4)]), the income with respect to such transfer or license shall be commensurate with the income attributable to the intangible.\n\nObviously, profits that are expected at the time of the transfer or license of intellectual property would be taken into account in determining the price or royalty rate. The relevant question is what happens when actual profits are greater or less than expected profits. It is indisputable that actual profits can be used by any tax authority worldwide as evidence of what profits should have been forecast at the time of the initial transfer or license. There is strong evidence that Congress intended that material future changes (or “major variations”) in the profits attributable to transferred IP away from the projections used to value this IP also give rise to adjustments to taxable income (periodic adjustments).\n\nTreasury regulations have implemented the concept of periodic adjustments. Notably, as shown in the next section, the IRS can make periodic adjustments to taxable income in any later year, even if the statute of limitations has run out on the year of the original transfer. In 1993 Treasury promulgated reg. section 1.482-4(f)(2), providing guidance for the application of periodic adjustments in any type of IP transaction. That guidance is not very specific, and it has rarely, if ever, been applied in practice. Rules for periodic adjustments in the context of cost-sharing agreements (CSAs) were promulgated in 2008, in reg. section 1.482-7(i)(6). Those rules, which are the subject of the following sections, are detailed and specific. Although the rules do not appear to have been applied in practice yet, CSAs that began in 2009 or later are just now reaching a level of maturity that makes implementation of the rules practical.\n\nIn a CSA, periodic adjustments may apply if there have been any contributions of IP to the research program. These contributions are known as platform contribution transactions (PCTs). Platform contributions are broadly defined by reg. section 1.482-7(c)(1) as “any resource, capability, or right that a controlled participant has developed, maintained, or acquired externally to the [CSA] . . . that is reasonably anticipated to contribute to developing cost shared intangibles.” Consistent with the broad mandate of the committee report, Treasury adopted this broad definition to ensure that valuable contributions are covered by the regulations even if the taxpayer would argue that they are technically not within the definition of intangible. The calculation of periodic adjustments will also take into account so-called operating contributions, which are defined similarly to platform contributions in reg. section 1.482-7(j)(1)(i) (“any resource, capability, or right”), but which contribute to operating the ongoing business rather than being used specifically in the research program.\n\nFor periodic adjustments to apply to the profits of Apple Operations International (AOI ), there must be PCTs attributable to Apple Inc. The case is complicated by the fact that AOI (or its predecessors) and Apple Inc. had preexisting CSAs that dated back to 1980 that we are assuming, for purposes of this report, were valid until the January 5, 2009, effective date of the 2008 cost-sharing regulations. AOI therefore owned exclusive rights to legacy Apple product IP in the rest of the world other than the Americas.\n\nIn Part 1, based on our analysis of the transition rules of the 2008 cost-sharing regulation and Apple’s restated 2009 CSA, we determined that AOI and Apple Inc. entered into a new CSA on January 5, 2009. The question that arises is whether Apple Inc. made any platform contributions to the new CSA, given that AOI already owned rest-of-the-world rights to product IP. The answer is a definitive yes. Apple Inc. contributed (1) exclusive rights to use legacy Apple product IP in the Americas, which would include the rights to use them in the research program (which required undivided rights to the global product IP); (2) IP related to workforce in place and facilities (which are part of going concern value) that are used in the research and development program; and (3) IP that it acquired in connection with corporate acquisitions in 2009 and later years. Further, all the IP used in the global business other than in the R&D program (that is, operating contributions), including IP related to the world’s best supply chain, belongs exclusively to Apple Inc. , as was shown in Part 1, in our analysis of the investigations by the Senate and the European Commission .\n\nThere are two overarching steps in determining the amount of the periodic adjustments that the IRS can make. First, the IRS must determine whether there is a periodic trigger, which would result from AOI earning more than an investor’s return on investments it has made in the CSA (that is, cost-sharing payments and PCT payments). Second, the periodic adjustment itself must be calculated by applying the detailed rules in the regulations. The analysis in the following sections clearly shows that there have been periodic triggers and that substantial periodic adjustments can be made. It is in the second step (the calculation of the periodic adjustments) that AOI ’s ownership of rest-of-the-world rights to legacy Apple product IP is taken into account as a PCT attributable to AOI . This is achieved through the mandatory application of a residual profit-split method (RPSM) that gives AOI a ratable share of the profits in its territory that exceed the routine return that it properly earned for its actual activities (for example, routine sales and marketing, customer support, logistics, etc.).\n\nA final note is warranted. Reg. section 1.482-7(i)(6) gives the IRS discretion in whether to apply periodic adjustments. We conclude that it is appropriate for the IRS to impose periodic adjustments in this case because (1) Apple Inc. makes nearly all the valuable contributions to both the research program and the ongoing global business, while AOI makes only financial contributions (PCT payments and cost-sharing payments) and performs some routine activities; and (2) Apple’s representations to the Senate and the commission are contradictory and demonstrate an abusive mind-set. In the following sections, we use publicly available information to show that there has been a periodic trigger and to estimate the magnitude of the periodic adjustments that would apply.\n\nA. No Statute of Limitations\n\nThe 2008 CSA regulations provide the following guidance regarding a periodic trigger:\n\nDetermination of periodic adjustments. In the event of a Periodic Trigger, subject to paragraph (i)(6)(vi) of this section, the Commissioner may make periodic adjustments with respect to all PCT Payments between all PCT Payors and PCT Payees for the Adjustment Year and all subsequent years for the duration of the CSA Activity pursuant to the residual profit split method as provided in paragraph (g)(7) of this section, subject to the further modifications in this paragraph (i)(6)(v). A periodic adjustment may be made for a particular taxable year without regard to whether the taxable years of the Trigger PCT or other PCTs remain open for statute of limitation purposes. [Emphasis added.]\n\nNote that in general, according to reg. section 1.482-7(i)(6)(i), there is no statute of limitations for the application of a periodic adjustment in an open year pertaining to a PCT in a closed year:\n\nSubject to the exceptions in paragraph (i)(6)(vi) of this section, the Commissioner may make periodic adjustments for an open taxable year (the Adjustment Year) and for all subsequent taxable years for the duration of the CSA Activity. . . . The failure of the Commissioner to determine for an earlier taxable year that a PCT Payment was not arm’s length will not preclude the Commissioner from making a periodic adjustment for a subsequent year. A periodic adjustment under this paragraph (i)(6) may be made without regard to whether the taxable year of the Trigger PCT or any other PCT remains open for statute of limitations purposes or whether a periodic adjustment has previously been made with respect to any PCT Payment.\n\nB. Key Assumptions Regarding Inputs\n\nWe explained in Part 1 that the Apple Inc. /AOI CSA should be treated as a new CSA as of January 5, 2009. Because of this, it is necessary to consider what each of Apple Inc. and AOI brought to the table in the way of platform contributions as of that date. This information is important because the reg. section 1.482-7(i)(6) calculations require the application of an RPSM that is based in part on the platform contributions provided by each CSA participant.\n\nFrom a conservative perspective, the calculations in this report assume that at the initiation of the December 1980 CSA, Apple Inc. transferred to its then-Irish subsidiaries the applicable foreign rights that would allow them to manufacture Apple products and then sell those products within the company’s defined geographic territory, which is understood to be the rest of the world other than the Americas. No buy-in payment was made for this IP transfer, which was allowed under then-applicable law. Since 1980, with the continued existence of CSAs that were amended from time to time, AOI (or its predecessors) would presumably have made appropriate payments for its share of intangible development costs.\n\nAlthough Apple undoubtedly made other acquisitions before January 2009, in hindsight, the 1997 acquisition of NeXT Software is notable for its size and importance to the future of the company. In December 1997 Apple was having difficulty financially, and its share price was equivalent to that on its IPO date 17 years earlier. The NeXT acquisition brought Steve Jobs back to the company. And with the NeXT design team he had assembled, Jobs began restructuring the company, eliminating 11 of its 15 product lines while seeking a $150 million investment from Microsoft Corp. The value of Apple’s IP in 1997 appeared tenuous, which is highlighted by the different direction that Apple took after the NeXT acquisition:\n\nMost college students today have only known Apple as the fashionable, popular, commercially competent, and trend setting global technology giant it is today. However, 23 years ago Apple Computer, Inc. was struggling to survive while trying to sell Macs in a PC world centered around Microsoft Windows. Things began to change after Apple acquired NeXT . . . on February 7, 1997. . . . Apple’s acquisition of NeXT Software 23 years ago most obviously provided the company with a modern operating system foundation. . . . Apple cracked open the highly proprietary worlds of audio streaming, video encoding and distribution . . . video playback streaming on the Internet. . . . In the same way that Jobs’ NeXT built its own development frameworks and operating environment, Apple has built its own technology for iMessages, for Siri, Maps, for new technologies.\n\nRelevant here is whether AOI made any buy-in payment to Apple Inc. for the PCTs that became available to the CSA’s intangible development activity. With the NeXT acquisition would have come both important intangibles and personnel (for example, Jobs and many other knowledgeable and skillful team members) who would have contributed significantly to the development team within Apple Inc. It is unknown whether Apple’s Irish CSA participants made PCT payments for the NeXT acquisition or for later or prior acquisitions related to Apple’s new strategy. The important point is that if there were in fact no PCT payments by AOI for those pre-2009 acquisitions, especially the NeXT acquisition, that would substantially reduce AOI’s relative share of the PCTs and legacy IP as of January 5, 2009. For purposes of this report, it is conservatively assumed that AOI made appropriate PCT payments and therefore legally owns the rest-of-the-world rights to the associated IP.\n\nC. Estimates for 2009 Initial PCTs\n\nAll the examples in reg. section 1.482-7(i)(6)(vii) assume that there is a new CSA where only one participant owns preexisting IP, and an initial PCT payment is therefore due exclusively from the other (usually foreign) participant. In Apple’s case, as previously explained, the rest-of-the-world rights to the existing IP were already owned by AOI because of its legacy participation in the CSAs that were in place before January 5, 2009. As a result, on the January 5, 2009, commencement of the new CSA, AOI would be deemed to have made a platform contribution consisting of those rights. For its part, Apple Inc. would be deemed to have made a platform contribution of all other rights to legacy IP related to the CSA, in addition to owning all other IP rights related to the global business (known as operating contributions).\n\nTo calculate periodic adjustments, the relative values of Apple Inc. ’s and AOI’s platform and operating contributions must be determined. These relative values are used to determine for AOI the portion of the profits related to its territory that are properly allocated to AOI in a residual profit-split analysis. One valuation method that would produce a maximum (and therefore conservative) value for AOI’s platform contribution of legacy IP existing on January 5, 2009, would be based on an allocation of Apple’s global market capitalization among the various IP assets owned by Apple Inc. and AOI .\n\nApple’s market capitalization on January 5, 2009, was $80.7 billion. The value of Apple’s tangible assets on December 27, 2008, reported in SEC filings was $39.1 billion, so the market value of Apple’s intangible assets was $41.6 billion. Importantly, this value represents all of the Apple group’s IP — including both technology IP and exploitation IP, the latter of which belonged solely to Apple Inc. The allocation of this value among the various IP assets is discussed here and is further documented in Appendix 2 (including Table A2.1).\n\nEconomic research has shown that exploitation attracts as much as 80 percent of system profits. The preponderance of this value would be attributable to Apple’s exploitation capability, including the world’s best supply chain. Relatively speaking, AOI has few exploitation capabilities and relies on Apple U.S. to conduct virtually all nonroutine critical business functions through which its IP is exploited. We must therefore exclude the IP value of that exploitation capability conducted by Apple U.S. from AOI ’s legacy IP value. For this exercise, the calculations conservatively assume that exploitation IP represents only 50 percent (well under the above-noted 80 percent) of the $41.6 billion of intangible assets, or $20.8 billion.\n\nThe remaining $20.8 billion represents the value of all technology-related IP. Technology-related IP must be further allocated between product IP (including the Apple trademark and any similar IP assets), which both Apple Inc. and AOI own, and other IP related to the development program, which belongs solely to Apple Inc. This development program IP includes R&D employee workforce in place and the going concern value of research facilities. Although there is some debate about whether these items are truly “intangible property” as defined in the tax code, the cost-sharing regulations broadly define platform contributions to include them. Specifically, platform contributions include any “resource or capability” that a cost-sharing participant has developed, maintained, or acquired that is reasonably anticipated to contribute to developing cost-shared intangibles. As has been clearly stated in the various documents from the European Commission and the General Court of the European Union (GCEU ), only Apple Inc. has the personnel and facilities through which the intangible development activity is conducted. It is therefore necessary to establish a PCT value for these Apple Inc. research teams and facilities as they existed on January 5, 2009. We have estimated that one-third of the $20.8 billion value of technology-related IP should be allocated to development program IP and two-thirds to product IP.\n\nThe amount allocated to product IP is $13.874 billion (two-thirds of $20.8 billion). Because both Apple Inc. and AOI own rights to Apple’s legacy product IP in their respective territories, this value is multiplied by AOI ’s estimated 2008 year-end reasonably anticipated benefit (RAB) territory share of 34.5 percent to yield a value of approximately $4.8 billion for AOI’s legacy IP. Because AOI owns no other IP, this is AOI ’s entire IP contribution.\n\nUnder the applicable rules, each participant in a CSA must also take into account in the periodic adjustment calculations any actual PCT payments that it made in connection with the contribution by the other participants at the initiation of that CSA. Because Apple Inc. and AOI treated their CSA under the 2008 regulations as being grandfathered, they would not have made any actual PCT payments. Although alternatives may be possible, this exercise is more than sufficient to conservatively analyze AOI ’s position at the commencement of the new CSA on January 5, 2009.\n\nD. Estimated 2009 PCT Payments\n\nApple disclosed to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) that Apple Sales International (ASI) and Apple Operations Europe (AOE) paid Apple Inc. for their respective shares of PCTs, consisting of (1) their shares of third-party technology acquisitions and (2) their shares of other contributed IP (such as IP covered by reg. section 1.482-4). For some years, Apple also disclosed the actual amounts of those PCT payments, together with actual cost-sharing payments and information on actual RAB shares, total CSA-related payments, and payments from ASI. Several of those inputs are shown below in figures 4 and 5:\n\nMoreover, Apple reports other key information in SEC filings, including U.S. and foreign pretax earnings and revenues. Information on acquisitions is available from public sources, including Apple’s websites. Those public sources were used to estimate the cost-sharing payments and PCT payments, which were then calibrated against actual results reported by Apple to the Senate PSI. The resulting adjustments were then applied to all years in the periodic adjustment calculations.\n\nPerhaps the most important input to be estimated for this calculation involves acquisitions from January 5, 2009, by Apple Inc. that include intangibles or personnel and facilities that will contribute to the cost-shared intangibles under the CSA. This is a difficult exercise using only public information because Apple acquires a company every few weeks, according to its CEO, and few of those acquisitions are publicly announced. It is unknown whether, or to what extent, any of the acquisitions include intangibles that would be within the scope of the Apple Inc. /AOI CSA and thus contribute as PCTs to cost-shared intangibles. However, because Apple makes so many acquisitions, these acquisitions cannot be ignored. For example, in April 2010 Apple acquired Siri. Soon after, in October 2011, Siri was included in the Apple iPhone 4S.\n\nGenerally, an acquisition or portions thereof would give rise to a PCT only if it involved capabilities, resources, or rights that were “reasonably anticipated to contribute to the intangible development activities.” The value of the platform contribution would be estimated according to methods in reg. section 1.482-7(g)(1)(i) through (vi) (which include unspecified methods). However, under appropriate circumstances, the foreign share of the entire adjusted acquisition value would be the PCT value according to reg. section 1.482-7(g)(5)(iii). Under that method, the full acquisition price plus any assumed liabilities and minus the value of any tangible assets would be the adjusted acquisition value. Although this acquisition price method is rarely used, it may be helpful for many Apple acquisitions because Apple often acquires small independent enterprises for their intangible properties and knowledgeable employees.\n\nThe approach taken here is to account for all publicly known acquisitions since January 5, 2009, at their reported or estimated full acquisition price (because the amounts of liabilities, tangible assets, or portions of acquisition values constituting PCT values are unknown). When an acquisition is disclosed but its value isn’t, the value to be substituted in this computation is the average of all the disclosed acquisition values for acquisitions from January 5, 2009. The average was determined after removing the two highest- and lowest-value acquisitions from the calculation to reduce bias.\n\nThis approach may conservatively overvalue the PCTs to some extent because (1) it is almost a certainty that not all acquisitions will include intangibles that will contribute to CSA cost-shared intangibles at a partial or full acquisition price; and (2) most, if not all, of the publicly announced acquisitions are expected to be among the largest ones, so the use of the average of these larger acquisition values is expected to capture or exceed the value of the omitted acquisition values. We were able to benchmark our estimates for PCTs with one year of actual PCTs reported by Apple to the Senate PSI for 2012. Our calculations to estimate the PCTs for all years matched very closely (within +$277 million to actual, or 11 percent overestimation) the actual PCT payments in 2012 that Apple reported to the Senate , shown in Table 5.\n\nTable 5.

The European Commission documents allege that AOI (that is, ASI and AOE) has made payments to Apple Inc. for only intangible development cost and some marketing services. The Senate PSI documents, however, disclosed that AOI made substantial PCT payments for both U.S. and foreign acquisitions and other IP covered by reg. section 1.482-4, at least in 2012. It seems likely that these PCT payments were included in the cost-sharing payments in the commission’s report. The calculations therefore assume that AOI has contributed through buy-in payments to PCTs acquired through acquisitions made by the U.S. company.\n\nOur method for estimating AOI’s PCT payments is conservative. This is because the periodic adjustment calculations treat PCT payments as investments on which AOI would be entitled to earn an appropriate return. By assuming that AOI made required PCT payments and by using an estimation method that likely overvalues the amount of the PCT payments, the total investment amount is increased. If PCT payments were not made or were smaller in amount, the size of the periodic adjustments we calculate would be larger.\n\nA summary of Apple’s acquisitions is shown in Appendix 1, together with the references for these acquisitions and their values, if disclosed.\n\nCombining the PCT payments for these acquisitions with the totals for other PCT payments and cost-sharing payments (as calibrated using actuals reported for 2012, shown in Figure 4), the payments shown in Table 5 were estimated as the basis for the periodic adjustment calculations. In general, these results are expected to provide a fairly accurate, if not slightly overstated, value of identified PCTs in each year on average. This is because we use the acquisition price method for acquisitions and assume generous “other IP” contributions in every year (when those contributions would be anticipated for only some years), combined with the referenced calibrations and adjustments (for instance, adjusting the foreign pretax income reported in SEC filings to the Americas and rest-of-the-world pretax income based on ratios determined from Senate PSI disclosures). The calculations conservatively assume that the 2012 PCT results shown in Figure 4 above are indicative of all the years between 2009 and 2020, which may not be the case.\n\nE. Exceptions to Periodic Adjustments\n\nReg. section 1.482-7(i)(6)(vi)(A)(1)-(4) identifies four exceptions that could prevent a periodic adjustment. In Apple’s case, the applicable period when these exceptions could apply would start on January 5, 2009. This is a result of Apple’s earlier-described lack of compliance with the 2008 regulation transition rule of reg. section 1.482-7(m)(1), which caused a new CSA as of that date.\n\nThe first exception concerns when a taxpayer has transferred the cost-shared IP to an unrelated party under conditions that are similar to the contribution to the controlled CSA participant, and the unrelated transfer price was used as the basis for pricing the PCT. No instances of this can be found in the public domain, and it seems doubtful that those situations would exist.\n\nThe second exception occurs when the indicated periodic trigger was the result of extraordinary events, beyond the control of the controlled participants, that could not reasonably have been anticipated at the time of the trigger PCT. Note that this exception assumes that the taxpayer otherwise complied with the CSA regulations. One might suggest that the incredible success of the iPhone could not have been reasonably anticipated, but actually the opposite occurred — the unexpected rise of Google’s Android-based smartphones, which competed directly with Apple’s iPhone, ensured that Apple would not become a monopolist in the smartphone market. In fact, Android’s rise relegated Apple’s market share to second place. No facts appear to support this exception.\n\nThe third exception is difficult to understand, even after reviewing the IRS ’s discussion of it in the preambles to the regulations. It appears to apply when the periodic trigger occurs as the result of contributions other than platform contributions. Because it is quite clear that platform contributions add significantly to AOI ’s extremely high profits, this exception would not apply.\n\nThe fourth exception would apply if a periodic trigger would not have occurred if anticipated profit and losses in future years were taken into account in the current year. Our analysis shows that AOI’s profits increase year after year, which indicates that the periodic trigger would occur no matter how many future years were considered.\n\nIn addition to these four exceptions, there are five- and 10-year safe harbors. The five-year safe harbor states that if AOI ’s CSA-related results are so low that they fall below the periodic trigger range, no periodic trigger will be allowed to exist for the first five years of the CSA (which, in our analysis, is from January 5, 2009). Under the 10-year safe harbor, if the taxpayer has no periodic trigger in the first 10 years of its CSA under the 2008 regulations, the taxpayer will be exempt from a periodic adjustment for the remaining life of the CSA arrangement. Apple Inc. qualifies for neither of these safe harbors because it appears to trigger a periodic adjustment in every year since 2009.\n\nIn summary, Apple does not appear to qualify for any of these exceptions or safe harbors that would prevent a periodic adjustment under reg. section 1.482-7(i)(6).\n\nF. Periodic Trigger Calculation\n\nHaving concluded thus far that Apple did not meet the transition rules or grandfathering requirements to be exempt from a periodic adjustment under reg. section 1.482-7(i)(6) and would not meet any of the exceptions or safe harbors, the next step in this analysis is to perform a periodic trigger calculation. If the calculation shows that a periodic adjustment is triggered, the adjustment is calculated.\n\nTable 6.

The actually experienced return ratio is the present value of the total profits of the foreign CSA participants divided by the present value of the CSA-related investments (the sum of PCTs and cost-sharing payments), known as PVI. The upper bound of the periodic return ratio range is 1.5. However, if the taxpayer has not substantially complied with the documentation requirements referenced in reg. section 1.482-7(k), that threshold is reduced to 1.25. (Note that preparing a CSA contract that includes intentionally misleading and false information on the functions and risks that each CSA participant undertakes — information required by reg. section 1.482-7(k)(1)(ii)(C) — should qualify as noncompliance.) Because Apple is publicly traded, the applicable discount rate is Apple’s weighted average cost of capital in the year in which the trigger PCT occurs, according to reg. section 1.482-7(i)(6)(iv)(B).\n\nThe calculations that follow use Apple’s 2017 fiscal year as the adjustment year (which is not yet under examination according to the most recent annual SEC filing). The trigger PCT occurred in 2009, and Apple’s applicable discount rate in 2009 is reported on a financial website to have been 12.23 percent. All the tables in the appendix use that applicable discount rate.\n\nThe calculations of the periodic trigger for Apple are based on SEC filings and other information and may differ to some extent from tax information. First, the information used as inputs to the periodic trigger calculation is shown below. Note that Apple has a September 30 year-end, and the CSA start date for this exercise is January 5, 2009. Therefore, year 1 in this exercise is a partial year, from January 5, 2009, to September 30, 2009, and year 2 and onward are 12-month periods from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. The year 1 financial inputs were estimated based on the proportion of annual revenues that occurred between the second and fourth quarters. The discount term was based on the number of days between January 5, 2009, and September 30, 2009. (Note that Apple Inc. uses a 52/53 week fiscal year in its SEC filings. For the convenience of the reader, we refer herein to September 30 year-ends.)\n\nThe periodic trigger calculation is shown below in Table 7, and it follows the process and formatting shown in reg. section 1.482-7(i)(6)(vii), Example 1.\n\nAs can be seen, a periodic trigger is indicated by this calculation beginning in year 1 of the January 5, 2009, CSA.\n\nG. Periodic Adjustment Calculations\n\nThe five steps laid out below are formulaic. The background to them, though, is the commensurate-with-income concept that was inserted into section 482 (and section 367(d)) in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. In short, the concept behind these formulaic steps is to allow a CSA participant to earn a return only to the extent of two factors:\n\nThe first factor is the routine exploitation functions performed. Normal transfer pricing concepts and applicable regulations under section 482 will determine the return for these functions. For AOI, these functions include the sales and marketing, customer support, logistics, and other functions performed by AOI’s disregarded entity subsidiaries around the world. Because Apple U.S. performs all production functions, AOI’s routine exploitation returns would exclude any return for those functions.\n\nThe second factor is the platform contributions that each CSA participant brought to the table at the initiation of the CSA. Thus, the RPSM is used by applying the relative value of each participant’s PCTs to determine that participant’s share of actual profits that exceed the calculated routine returns. Say, for example, that one participant has existing product IP that will contribute to the intangible development activity and has personnel and facilities that will conduct the joint development of the cost-shared intangibles. The other participant holds different IP that will also contribute to the intangible development activity. Their relative values are 75 percent for the first participant and 25 percent for the second participant. These relative values are used by applying the RPSM in the periodic adjustment calculation to place appropriate levels of nonroutine profits in the hands of each participant.\n\nThe five formulaic steps to calculate the periodic adjustment are set out in reg. section 1.482-7(i)(6)(v) as follows.\n\nAs of the date of the trigger PCT, determine the present value of the PCT payments using the adjusted RPSM as described in paragraph (i)(6)(v)(B) of the CSA regulations. (Note that for this purpose, these PCT payments are mostly those related to the Apple Inc. acquisitions.)\n\nConvert the present value of the PCT payments determined in the first step into a level royalty rate as a percentage of the reasonably anticipated divisional profits or losses over the entire duration of the CSA activity.\n\nMultiply the second-step royalty rate by the actual divisional profit or loss for tax years preceding and including the adjustment year to yield a stream of contingent payments in each year, and convert these payments to a present value as of the CSA start date. In the event of a loss in a year, the result will be a negative contingent payment for that year.\n\nFirst, convert any actual PCT payments through the adjustment year to a present value as of the CSA start date (January 5, 2009). Second, subtract this present value from the present value result determined in the previous step. This difference is the amount in present value terms of the participant’s deficiency in PCT payments. Third, convert this present value payment to a nominal amount in the adjustment year. This nominal amount is the periodic adjustment to be recognized by the U.S. taxpayer as additional taxable income in the adjustment year.\n\nTable 9.

In Appendix 2, step 4 is separated into steps 4a, 4b, and 4c for clarity. After a periodic adjustment has been calculated for an adjustment year, every subsequent year will automatically be subject to a periodic adjustment in accordance with the following guidance.\n\nApply the second-step royalty rate to the actual divisional profit or loss for each tax year after the adjustment year to calculate amounts for each year. Then subtract from each year’s amount any actual PCT payment made for the same year. The differences are the periodic adjustment for each post-adjustment tax year.\n\nReg. section 1.482-7(i)(6)(v)(B)(2) contains the following guidance regarding the determination of the applicable royalty:\n\nProjected results for the balance of the CSA Activity after the Determination Date, as reasonably anticipated as of the Determination Date, shall be substituted for what otherwise were the projected results over such period, as reasonably anticipated as of the date of the Trigger PCT.\n\nThe detailed guidance, as reflected in reg. section 1.482-7(i)(6)(vii), Example 1, paragraphs (v) through (vii), requires that the entire projected life of a CSA be included in the calculation of the level royalty rate. As a result, in making calculations for the Apple Inc. /AOI CSA , which presumably is intended to have a perpetual life, our calculation of the level royalty rate in Table A2.3 includes a terminal value. (This is described in Appendix 2, section C.3.)\n\nThe calculation steps described above as applied to Apple’s CSA, together with relevant assumptions, are shown in Appendix 2. Tables 9 and 10 show the results of steps 4 and 5, representing the periodic adjustment calculations through the fiscal 2017 adjustment year.\n\nOnce the adjustment year result is obtained, step 5 computes the periodic adjustment due for the remaining years for which information is available (the last year representing the determination date), using the adjustment year royalty rate. Because Apple has reported book financial results through 2020, Table 9 shows results for fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2020, in which the 2020 tax year is the determination date.\n\nThe total estimated taxes that the IRS could impose on an audit cycle covering years through the determination date based on this analysis are shown below.\n\nH. Impact of Deemed Repatriation Tax\n\nImportantly, Apple stated in its fiscal 2018 Form 10-K the following regarding its deemed repatriation taxes as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Beginning with its fiscal 2018 tax return, Apple was required to pay these taxes on all accumulated unrepatriated foreign income since 1986, measured as of approximately November 2017, because of the U.S. implementation of a territorial tax system in 2017:\n\nAs of September 30, 2017, the Company had a U.S. deferred tax liability of $36.4 billion for deferred foreign income. During 2018, the Company replaced $36.1 billion of its U.S. deferred tax liability with a deemed repatriation tax payable of $37.3 billion, which was based on the Company’s cumulative post-1986 deferred foreign income. . . . The Company plans to pay the tax in installments in accordance with the Act. [Emphasis added.]\n\nThe $37.3 billion appears to represent, for the most part, the 15.5 percent special repatriation tax rate applied to Apple’s unrepatriated foreign income as of the 2017 measurement date, net of foreign tax credits. Secondly, Apple stated that it elected to pay this sum in installments over eight years, consistent with the TCJA. According to the law, the first five of those payments are 8 percent of the repatriation tax amount and escalate in the last three years to 15 percent, 20 percent, and 25 percent, respectively. No interest element is added to these installments. This means that as of mid-2021, Apple has presumably paid two of these installments, or $5.9 billion, which would reduce to some extent the amount of any taxes resulting from a periodic adjustment assessed for the 2017 tax year.\n\nApple reported in its 2018 Form 10-K that it had established a deferred tax liability for the expected deemed repatriation taxes of $37.3 billion arising from the TCJA. If that is combined with Apple’s unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2020, of $16.5 billion, the result is $53.8 billion, which is about 64 percent of the $84 billion in taxes that would be associated with the periodic adjustment estimated here based on public information. It is expected that Apple’s internal accounting information will differ, perhaps significantly, from the estimates established here, which are based on publicly available information and on factual assumptions made when public information is unavailable. For instance, this analysis intentionally seeks to apply maximum possible values for acquisition and other PCTs and routine returns, and minimum values for projected CSA returns, to produce a “lower bound” conservative periodic adjustment estimate. An actual calculation based on Apple’s proprietary tax and accounting results could determine periodic adjustments significantly higher than the $84 billion estimated here.\n\nV. Alternative Adjustments to AOI\n\nRegardless of whether the IRS chooses to apply a periodic adjustment under reg. section 1.482-7(i)(6), the publicly available facts strongly support two additional approaches for the IRS to consider. One of them — the application of effectively connected income taxation and the subpart F branch rule to AOI — can be pursued simultaneously with transfer pricing adjustments, including the periodic adjustment and adjustments under other transfer pricing regulations.\n\nA. ECI Taxation and Subpart F Branch Rule\n\nECI taxation is applied to foreign persons, including controlled foreign corporations, such as AOI. This taxation requires that the foreign person factually conduct a trade or business within the United States. Part 1 of this report documented how AOI conducts much of its business through the actions of U.S.-based personnel, whether its own personnel or Apple Inc. personnel who are making decisions and conducting commercial sales and production activities on behalf of AOI . These activities, conducted regularly and continuously, are more than enough to cause AOI to be engaged in a trade or business within the United States.\n\nThe application of ECI taxation is procedurally easier when there is a partnership. Accordingly, how Apple Inc. and AOI conduct the Apple group’s worldwide business must be examined in light of the reg. section 301.7701-1 and -3 entity classification rules. In short, with one management and operational structure that conducts the business of both Apple Inc. and AOI , there is clearly a joint business that constitutes an entity for federal tax purposes and will be treated as a partnership under the entity classification default rule in the absence of an active election. With AOI thereby being treated as a partner in a partnership that conducts the joint worldwide business of the Apple group, AOI will be treated by statute (section 875) as being engaged in a trade or business within the United States.\n\nOnce AOI is found to be engaged in a trade or business in the United States (whether directly or through a partnership), each item of gross income must be considered under the applicable sourcing and ECI rules to determine the ECI that will be directly taxable in the hands of AOI. Given the active participation of personnel in the United States in both the sales and production of tangible and intangible products, as well as in managing and operating the internet-based platforms through which cloud services income is earned, it seems certain that there will be significant U.S.-source income that will be treated as ECI under section 864(c)(3).\n\nIt is important to note that ECI taxation may be applied in conjunction with transfer pricing adjustments. Assume that the IRS chooses to apply and eventually sustains periodic adjustments under reg. section 1.482-7(i)(6) or other transfer pricing adjustments, such as intercompany service fee adjustments under reg. section 1.482-9. Following those adjustments, AOI’s profits will have been reduced under the correlative adjustment rules of reg. section 1.482-1(g)(2). ECI taxation will be applied to the post-correlative adjustment profits of AOI.\n\nThe status of open and closed years for the application of ECI taxation to a CFC, such as AOI, does not follow the status of the Apple U.S. affiliated group’s open and closed years. This is because any CFC is a separate taxpayer with its own filing requirements on Form 1120-F, “U.S. Income Tax Return of a Foreign Corporation.” If AOI hasn’t filed Form 1120-F for a prior year, then under section 6501(c)(3), that year will still be open for adjustment. Further, the above-described facts show how Apple Inc. has conducted major portions of AOI’s business and show the conflicting information that the group has provided to different authorities, including the GCEU . Considering this, even if AOI has filed protective Forms 1120-F for all prior years going back to its predecessor’s 1980 formation claiming that it had no trade or business in the United States, many of those years should still be open under either section 6501(c)(1) or (2), which respectively deal with the filing of a false or fraudulent return and the willful attempt to evade tax.\n\nThe Form 10-K filed by Apple Inc. for its year that ended in September 2020 disclosed that all prior years through 2015 are closed for further adjustment by the IRS . Despite this, many or all of those prior years will likely still be open for ECI taxation of AOI .\n\nECI taxation includes not only the normal corporate tax at the rate applicable for the tax year but also the section 884 branch profits tax. Further, if a tax return has not been timely filed, the amount of ECI will be increased by the section 882(c)(2) denial of deductions and credits.\n\nTo the extent that AOI’s income from sales is foreign-source and escapes ECI taxation, it will still be potentially subject to U.S. taxation in the hands of its U.S. shareholder under subpart F. In short, the branch rule of section 954(d)(2) and reg. section 1.954-3(b) should apply to some portion of AOI’s sales transactions. Because subpart F results in taxation in the hands of the U.S. shareholder and not the applicable CFC, this additional tax should apply only to Apple Inc.’s 2016 tax year and later, unless some exception were to apply. For example, section 6501(c)(8) could potentially apply depending on what disclosures Apple Inc. has made or not made in its U.S. tax filings.\n\nB. Recharacterization\n\nThe second possible approach that the IRS could consider is recharacterization. Although the above ECI and subpart F branch rule approach can be applied on its own or in conjunction with periodic adjustments, recharacterization would be appropriate only if the IRS were to decline to initiate periodic adjustments.\n\nAny in-depth discussion of recharacterization is beyond the scope of this report. Suffice it to say that the background facts of how Apple Inc. manages the entire business of AOI and conducts major portions of its business on its behalf (for example, sales to major customers, full conduct of AOI’s supply chain, and operation of the internet-based platforms through which AOI makes sales and earns cloud services revenues) strongly support a position that AOI is nothing more than an agent of Apple Inc. That position is consistent with the factual situation that Apple has presented to the European Commission and the GCEU .\n\nNote that a recharacterization approach could be applied only to Apple Inc. ’s open years, which are 2016 through the present. In contrast, both periodic adjustments and ECI taxation allow some taxation of AOI income earned in earlier years.\n\nVI. Conclusion\n\nThe conclusions of this report are based on reliable public information, including disclosures related to investigations conducted by the Senate PSI and the European Commission , which include information provided by Apple Inc. to these organizations and to the GCEU . Our findings include that Apple Inc. did not comply with the transition rules in the 2008 temporary cost-sharing regulations (in particular, reg. section 1.482-7(m)(1)). Although this would disqualify the Apple Inc. /AOI CSA from being a valid CSA from January 5, 2009, the IRS ’s apparent acceptance of the CSA in now-closed tax years from 2009 through 2015 means that Apple Inc. and AOI ’s CSA must be considered to be a new CSA effective from January 5, 2009, with no benefit of any grandfathering provisions in reg. section 1.482-7(m)(2). As a result, Apple would not qualify for exemption from compliance with the 2008 periodic adjustment regulations in reg. section 1.482-7(i)(6). An indicative calculation of this periodic adjustment according to these regulations and based on conservative assumptions shows that Apple Inc. appears to be subject to a substantial periodic adjustment, the tax payments for which would exceed the amounts of tax underpayments reserved in Apple ’s UTPs combined with its deferred tax liabilities for the TCJA deemed repatriation taxes.\n\nIn conjunction with, or as an alternative to, making periodic adjustments, the IRS has a particularly strong basis for assessing ECI taxation directly on AOI and treating some portion of AOI’s transactions as creating subpart F income within Apple Inc. under the foreign base company income branch rule. Further, as an alternative to making periodic adjustments, the IRS could consider recharacterizing the Apple Inc. /AOI relationship to treat AOI as nothing more than an agent of Apple Inc.\n\nImportantly, the apparent recognition within AOI of significant profits that should have been reflected within the United States, as demonstrated in this report, affects state taxes, especially for any states that apply their state income taxes on a water’s-edge or other approach that excludes AOI’s profits from the allocable tax base. In addition, these findings should provide a basis for state tax audits to recoup significant amounts of underpaid taxes where a state has applicable transfer pricing rules in place.\n\nThat so many code sections appear to have been violated by Apple Inc.’s potentially sham, and almost certainly nonqualifying, CSA without IRS detection or enforcement, despite a plethora of publicly available evidence and information, raises possibly the most spectacular enforcement failure yet produced by this Frankenstein regulation. It does appear that Frankenstein’s monster is alive and well, and on the rampage at Apple Inc.\n\nVII. Appendix 1: Apple Acquisitions\n\nPublicly known acquisitions are shown in Table A1.1.

Appendix 2: Periodic Adjustment\n\nA. Assumptions Made\n\nIn preparing this analysis, the following assumptions underlie the calculations.\n\n1. Apple Inc. made all U.S. and foreign acquisitions that constitute platform contributions.\n\nApple disclosed to the Senate PSI a detailed accounting of the PCTs paid by its Irish affiliates in 2012, which showed that they made payments to Apple U.S. for their share of PCTs for acquisitions of both foreign and U.S. companies in that year that were deemed to contribute to the IP development activity, as well as for “other” IP consisting of IP that was covered by reg. section 1.482-4. The information did not disclose any PCT obligations of Apple U.S. to the Irish participants. Therefore, we have extended these facts to all the years since January 5, 2009. If 2012 was not reflective of the facts in other years, those results may be inaccurate.\n\n2. There are undisclosed and underpriced PCTs and other uncompensated transactions.\n\nThis periodic adjustment analysis assumes that AOI paid an arm’s-length price under applicable regulations (in fact, the maximum value for acquisitions of intangible assets and personnel that would contribute to the development of cost-shared intangibles) for all identified PCTs. Therefore, to the extent that a periodic adjustment is calculated, it would be the result of unidentified PCTs, identified PCTs for which no payment was made, non-CSA-related controlled transactions, or other factors that inflate the divisional profits of AOI. For instance, our analysis has shown, and Apple has represented to the GCEU , that AOI did not pay for any U.S. commercialization activities that in fact generated the Irish participants’ CSA-related income (a violation that could technically invalidate Apple’s CSA under reg. section 1.482-7(m)(1) in combination with reg. section 1.482-7(a)(3)(iii)). Apple further testified that all its stateless income was attributable to these Apple U.S. exploitation services and activities. Whether this is an Apple U.S. operating contribution or an activity that contributes to the IP development activity in a way that requires a PCT payment, it is one example of an undocumented transaction that would help explain the significant periodic adjustment result.\n\nOne reason the commensurate-with-income standard is necessary is that it is often impossible for the IRS to sufficiently identify all current and future PCTs, operating contributions, and non-CSA-related intercompany transactions to adequately explain all future CSA outcomes in a way that can reliably value platform contributions made at the outset of the CSA or throughout the CSA’s existence. Only through a periodic adjustment analysis in future years can the IRS be confident that the CSA has properly accounted for the value of all PCTs and other intercompany transactions. The periodic adjustment calculations do not try to identify these missing transactions but merely confirm that they exist. Taxpayers can, of course, avoid a periodic adjustment by performing the periodic trigger calculations themselves and revising their transfer pricing to ensure that the periodic trigger limitations are not breached for the applicable period.\n\nB. Alternative Assumptions\n\nIf any of the alternative assumptions below occurred, the results of this analysis could change significantly.\n\n1. AOI made material technology acquisitions using its own funds.\n\nIf Apple’s 2012 year was not representative of other years and, for instance, AOI made acquisitions with its own funds in other years, this could change the amount of the periodic adjustment, which assumes that AOI made no acquisitions with its own funds from 2009 but paid Apple U.S. AOI’s share of PCTs for all acquisitions that contributed to the cost-sharing activity. If AOI made its own acquisitions, there could be some amount of PCT payments due by Apple Inc. to AOI , and AOI would have to be given credit for any acquired intangibles in the RPSM analysis.\n\n2. Exceptions apply under reg. section 1.482-7(i)(6)(vi).\n\nIf any of the exceptions to a periodic adjustment listed in reg. section 1.482-7(i)(6)(vi) apply, that could alter or reverse these results. These exceptions are explained in Section V.E of our report. These exceptions would include if AOI provided intangible development activities that have not been otherwise accounted for. That would reduce the value of any periodic adjustments once these contributions were accounted for.\n\n3. Apple did not have a qualified CSA under the 1996 regulations.\n\nThe January 1996 regulation, reg. section 1.482-7A(a)(1), required for a valid CSA that there be “individual exploitation of the interests in the intangibles assigned to them under the arrangement.” Based on testimony by Apple Inc. to the GCEU , and the results of the state aid investigation by the European Commission , AOI (or ASI and AOE) neither conducted its business in any truly independent manner nor exploited the CSA-covered IP. Rather, Apple Inc. performed these activities on behalf of AOI , apparently without compensation. As such, if AOI were considered to not be conducting individual exploitation, there would be no valid CSA in place from 1996 through January 5, 2009. This means that all internally created intangibles (putatively created within the preexisting CSAs from the January 1, 1996, effective date of the applicable regulations until January 5, 2009) should be treated as solely owned by Apple Inc. for purposes of the relative platform and operating contributions as of January 5, 2009, that each of Apple Inc. and AOI contributed to the new CSA. For conservatism, this alternative assumption was not made in the periodic adjustment calculations, but it appears to be realistic. If the IRS pursues the periodic adjustments suggested in this report, it should consider whether to adopt this lack of any effective CSA from 1996 through the January 5, 2009, commencement date of the new CSA.\n\nC. Periodic Adjustment Step 1\n\nTable A2.1 below calculates the residual profit for each year, based on the difference between the foreign affiliate revenues and the non-CSA-related expenses as marked up by the routine return. This difference is the nonroutine return. The nonroutine return is additive by year, and the sum of each year and prior years is determined and converted to a net present value as of the CSA start date (January 5, 2009). Importantly, the calculations in this appendix are based on the following assumptions, as mentioned earlier:\n\nAOI, through its disregarded entity subsidiaries, performs only routine activities.\n\nThe arm’s-length return for AOI ’s routine activities is an 8 percent markup on its associated expenses. Based on our experience, we deemed this to likely be a generous arm’s-length profit for what are clearly routine back-office functions, marketing and sales activities, manufacturing, customer service, and other disaggregated and essentially subcontracted services performed mostly for the local Irish markets.\n\nFuture years are included in accordance with reg. section 1.482-7(i)(6)(v)(B)(2). They are reflected in a “terminal value” that was modeled as a finite life of 10 years, in which each year replicated the fiscal 2020 result with no growth or decline, with the nominal amount representing the discounted result in 2020, using the 2017 applicable discount rate (these assumptions of zero growth and finite life of the CSA are anticipated to be very conservative estimates of Apple’s projected results).\n\nThe residual profit split shown in column (g) provides 66.7 percent of the residual profits to Apple U.S. and 33.3 percent to AOI , based on the analyses shown in Table A2.1. These calculations are further described below.\n\nD. Residual Profit-Split\n\nThe first step of the periodic adjustment calculation is to determine the present value of the PCT payments using the adjusted RPSM, as described in paragraph (i)(6)(v)(B) of the CSA regulations. Reg. section 1.482-7(g)(7)(iii)(C)(1) provides that profits must be split “based upon the relative values, determined as of the date of the PCTs, of the PCT Payor’s [AOI] as compared to the PCT Payee’s [Apple U.S.] nonroutine contributions to the PCT Payor’s division.” The regulation continues with further guidance that would clearly not give the correct economic result in Apple’s case. Among other faults, the guidance fails to consider a circumstance in which the PCT payee (Apple Inc. ) makes operating contributions to the business of the PCT payer (AOI) (much less an egregious case like Apple’s in which only the PCT payee makes operating contributions) because it refers only to the PCT payer’s operating contributions. Notably, Example 2 in reg. section 1.482-7(g)(7)(v) applies the general rule but does not apply any of the further guidance. We have done likewise in Table A2.1. For this purpose, all platform and operating contributions are taken into account, but the initial platform contributions at the outset of the new CSA that are deemed to occur on January 5, 2009, are particularly important. (All later PCTs have already been accounted for in Appendix 1.)\n\nAs noted above, the applicable profit-split factor must be calculated for the above calculations. The derivation of the factor is documented in Table A2.1. The factor is equal to the ratio of nonroutine contributions by each party as of January 5, 2009. Nonroutine contributions include both platform contributions and operating contributions. The top portion of the table below calculates worldwide values of each type of nonroutine contribution:\n\nFirst, the worldwide value of all IP is calculated. This is the market capitalization of Apple Inc. as of January 5, 2009, minus the book value of assets. The worldwide value of all IP equals $41.6 billion.\n\nSecond, the worldwide IP value is divided between platform contributions and operating contributions, which are assumed to be equally valuable. Platform contributions are contributions that are related to the development program under the CSA. These are further broken down between the value of product IP (which also includes the value of trademarks) and the value of IP related to workforce in place and research facilities. Considering the world-class nature of Apple’s research program, which is conducted wholly by Apple Inc. , we estimate that it constitutes one-third of the total platform contributions. (Note that these IP values, which could also be identified as part of Apple’s going concern value, are in addition to (1) the routine values of the group’s tangible assets, which are captured by using their book value and (2) the routine value of all activities conducted by AOI and its disregarded entity subsidiaries, which is captured by the 8 percent markup on expense.) Nonroutine operating contributions are all IP contributions to the group’s ongoing business that are unrelated to the research program but primarily related to Apple’s world-class supply chain and its marketing strategies, which are directed and conducted by Apple Inc.\n\nThe next two portions of the table split these worldwide intangible property values between AOI and Apple Inc. :\n\nAOI contributes only one of the three types of IP identified. That is, AOI is treated as owning all the product-related IP applicable to AOI ’s territory (identified as AOI’s 34.5 percent RAB share as of the end of fiscal 2008). This is because even though a new CSA is deemed to begin on January 5, 2009, as a result of the final regulations’ transition rules, the original CSA that commenced in 1980 and later restatements are conservatively assumed to have been valid through January 5, 2009.\n\nIt is indisputable that the R&D workforce in place and research facilities are located within Apple Inc. and that no portion of their IP value should be allocated to AOI.\n\nFor purposes of the analysis, it is assumed that AOI should not be allocated any portion of the operating contributions, either. While this conclusion is not indisputable, it cannot be denied that Apple Inc. owns the lion’s share of that IP. Attributing some small proportion (say, 3 percent) of this IP to AOI would make only a very minor change to the periodic adjustment calculation.\n\nThis report has demonstrated very clearly that almost all activities related to Apple’s unmatched supply chain, and all direction and much of the implementation of marketing strategies, are conducted by Apple Inc. and in fact have been compensated by AOI through service fees only to a very small extent (if at all). Apple has admitted as much in its filings with the European Commission . To the extent there may be Apple group personnel located in China or elsewhere in Asia who are part of the supply chain support and quality control functions who are employed by AOI’s disregarded entity subsidiaries, those personnel take their directions solely from Apple Inc. and not from AOI or any of its disregarded entity subsidiaries. Further, all indications suggest that those AOI disregarded entity subsidiaries would be compensated only with routine returns under Apple’s global transfer pricing policies. It is therefore reasonable and appropriate to assign a nonroutine operating contribution value of zero to AOI .\n\nIn light of the above, the worldwide value of the Apple group’s IP of $41.6 billion must be allocated between the Apple Inc. and AOI territories. Under the guidance of reg. section 1.482-7(g)(7)(iii)(C)(1), with only profits attributable to AOI ’s territory being subject to the RPSM analysis, the final section in the table below determines the profit split between AOI and Apple Inc. based on AOI’s RAB share of legacy product IP ($4.8 billion) and Apple Inc.’s contribution to AOI’s business from its R&D workforce and facilities ($2.4 billion) and its supply chain, marketing, and other exploitation ($7.2 billion). This results in a profit split for AOI of 33.3 percent and for Apple Inc. of 66.7 percent.\n\nThese relative percentages are carried to Table A2.2, which allocates to Apple Inc. a 66.7 percent share of AOI’s residual nonroutine profit.\n\nTable A2.1. Residual Profit-Split Calculationa\n\nInputs to Residual Profit-Split Method Calculation\n\n(Reg. Section 1.482-7(g)(7)(iii)(C)(1) [first sentence])\n\n($ million)\n\nTable A2.2 below calculates the nonroutine residual profit for each year, 66.7 percent of which is credited to Apple U.S. This residual profit is based on the difference between AOI ’s revenues (column (b)) and the sum of (1) AOI’s intangible development costs (that is, cost-sharing payments) (included in column (e)); (2) AOI’s PCT payments to Apple Inc. (also included in column (e)); and (3) AOI’s non-CSA-related expenses (included in column (c)) marked up by an assumed routine return of 8 percent (included in column (f)), which is intended to approximate an arms-length return for these routine functions. This difference is the nonroutine residual return, which is then split between AOI and Apple Inc. based on the profit split calculated in Table A2.1 above. The nonroutine residual return is additive by year, and the sum of each year and prior years is determined and converted to a net present value as of the CSA start date of January 5, 2009 ($132.4 billion in column (g)).\n\nTable A2.2.

Periodic Adjustment Step 3\n\nTable A2.4 calculates the nominal value of the royalty payment representing the residual profit as calculated in the prior table, on a rolling basis from the beginning of the CSA to the adjustment date. The table calculates the nominal royalty in the adjustment year, based on the sum of the net present value of the payments in each year and the years before it.\n\nApple has disclosed that the IRS is examining its tax years through 2016, and we assume that the IRS has not applied a periodic adjustment to Apple Inc. in the current examination cycle or any previous examination cycle. This table therefore uses a royalty rate applicable to adjustment year 2017.\n\nTable A2.4. Nominal Royalty Calculation\n\nPeriodic Adjustment per Reg.
