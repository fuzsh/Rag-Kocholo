        "text": "13 Pro owner here. I wonder how old an iPhone do you need to have to get excited about the 16 / 16 Pro series ?\n\nAn 11 or 12 maybe ? Not sure I’m convinced of the need to spend so much money upgrading.\n\nI have a 13 Pro and I'm excited to consider upgrading in the fall. For me its a combination of little quality of life things, like USB-C (since all of my other devices are USB-C) and all of the smaller incremental upgrades that tend to really add up. My battery is still going strong despite being down to 88% capacity, so I may very well wait for the 17 though, it will depend on what kind of trade in promotions or other deals Verizon or other outlets offer.\n\nPhones are a bit like laptops now, other than iterative refinements and spec bumps there's not much else we can do with the form factor barring some major technological breakthrough. Most users could happily get by for 4-5 years on a phone nowadays and only need to replace it to get a fresh battery, because it's damaged, because it's gotten slow relative to modern apps/websites, or because it stopped receiving software updates. This isn't an Apple being stingy or not innovative issue, this is an industry-wide issue.\n\nApple typically releases its new iPhone series around mid-September, which means we are about two months out from the launch of the iPhone 16. Like the iPhone 15 series, this year's lineup is expected to stick with four models – iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max – although there are plenty of design differences and new features to take into account.\n\nTo bring you up to speed, we've summarized below the biggest iPhone 16 rumors we've covered so far here on MacRumors. For more details, follow the links, or dive into our dedicated roundups for both iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models.\n\n1. Larger Displays\n\nBiggest Ever iPhones\n\nThis year's iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are rumored to be getting bigger display sizes, increasing to 6.27- and 6.86-inches, respectively. For comparison, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are equipped with 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays, respectively. The new display sizes would be the largest ever for the iPhone.\n\n2. Vertical Camera Layout\n\niPhone 16 & iPhone 16 Plus\n\nApple's iPhone 16 base models will feature a vertical camera arrangement with a pill-shaped raised surface, instead of a diagonal camera arrangement like the iPhone 15. The new camera bump features two separate camera rings for the Wide and Ultra Wide cameras. The vertical camera layout is expected to enable Spatial Video recording, which is currently limited to the iPhone 15 Pro models.\n\n3. Battery Changes\n\nAll iPhone 16 Models\n\nOne rumor suggests the ‌iPhone 16‌ and iPhone 16 Pro Max will feature larger batteries than their predecessors, but the ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus may have reduced capacity. The iPhone 16 is said to have a 6% increase over the iPhone 15, with the iPhone 16 Pro Max gaining a 5% increase. In contrast, the iPhone 16 Plus is rumored to have a 9% reduction in capacity. On the other hand, Apple could also potentially use stacked battery technology to increase energy density and prolong lifespan across the lineup.\n\n4. Capture Button\n\nNew Camera Capabilities\n\nAll iPhone 16 models will have a new \"Capture Button\" dedicated to triggering image or video capture. The button will add features like the ability to zoom in and out by swiping left and right on the button, focus on a subject with a light press, and activate a recording with a more forceful press. The Capture Button will be located on the bottom right side of the ‌iPhone 16, and will take the place of the mmWave antenna on U.S. ‌iPhone‌ models, with the antenna relocating to the left side of the device below the volume and Action buttons.\n\n5. Ultra Wide Lens Upgrade\n\niPhone 16 Pro & iPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro models are expected to feature an upgraded 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera lens, which should allow it to capture more light, resulting in improved photos when shooting in 0.5× mode, especially in low-light environments. This also means that iPhone 16 Pro models should be able to shoot 48-megapixel ProRAW photos in Ultra Wide mode. These photos retain more detail in the image file for more editing flexibility, and can be printed at large sizes. The iPhone 16 Pro Max is also rumored to boast a bigger main camera thanks to an advanced custom 48-megapixel Sony IMX903 sensor.\n\n6. Super Telephoto Camera\n\niPhone 16 Pro Max\n\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max could be the first to feature a super telephoto periscope camera for dramatically increased optical zoom. \"Super\" or \"ultra\" telephoto usually describes cameras with a focal length of over 300mm. The current telephoto lens is equivalent to a 77mm lens, so if accurate, there could be a notable increase in zoom capabilities. Super telephoto cameras are often used for sports and wild animal photography, but the extremely soft backgrounds they create also make them useful for portrait photography, providing there is enough distance between the subject and the photographer.\n\n7. Faster Wi-Fi Support\n\nWi-Fi 6E & Wi-Fi 7\n\nApple's 2024 iPhone Pro models are expected to get Wi-Fi 7 in the Pro models, enabling data transfer over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously. This should result in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. With technologies such as 4K QAM, Wi-Fi 7 is also expected to offer peak data transfer speeds of over 40 Gbps, a 4× increase...

Got it.\n\nI would argue it is fairly easy but most people on here will probably read no further than \"Google\" .\n\nAlso granted, I had to also order the Watch 7 because my Apple Watch obviously won't work with it but that one is an old Series 6, therefore I see it as an \"upgrade\".\n\nMy use case is pretty simple. Watching content when I travel or commute without carrying my iPad.\n\nI did just that last year with the Flip 5 and ugh it was such a headache....... the phone itself was just alright. When it came to transferring all my data for whatever reason it took ages and didn't transfer completely. I only ended up keeping it for a few months and had to switch back. Hopefully you'll like it better! I also ordered a samsung watch but never got delivered and they kept charging me for it... my experience was just headache after headache with their customer care team. Fingers crossed for you!"
