        "text": "Visited on Friday night around 6 PM. There was a good crowd, however, it was not overly crowded.We found seeding immediately at a tall table and our server was prompt to come over and greet us. We all ordered mixed drinks and they came out quickly. They use high quality rocks-style glasses and the square ice cubes, which is a nice touch.As a group, we had an appetizer of their pretzel sticks with their beer cheese. They are always a good choice. For my meal, I had a cheddar bacon burger and fries. It was cooked just right with a really good bun. The meat was seasoned just right and the presentation was good, as well.\n\nIt's the cheese bricks... I dream about these babies. Huge bricks of fried cheese served with a raspberry dipping sauce. It's a mozzarella cheese stick on steroids. Ah-Maz-Ing! I have never had anything from Digby's that I didn't like, but just know: the cheesebricks are a must and they are filling! The pulled pork mac and cheese, burger, and breaded tenderloin are some of my other favs. Make sure to check their social media page for daily specials. The also have one of the best outdoor patios in Lafayette in my opinion.\n\nWe stopped here on our way to drop our daughter back to Purdue. She wanted a burger, so a burger is what she got. The restaurant is small-ish on the inside, with maybe about a dozen tables for dining, and a separate bar spot for 21+. We scoped out the menu ahead of time, so we knew we wanted to try the cheese bricks. The were huge and perfectly fried-not overly breaded and the cheese was the perfect level of melts/gooey. We ordered a New Yorker (at the bartenders recommendation of it being her favorite sandwich), the Duck BLT, and a 1lb bacon burger. These came with fries or chips, but we upgraded to 2 side salads. Everything was so yummy!"
