Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. It’s hardware products include the iPhone smartphone, the iPad tablet computer, the Mac personal computer, the iPod portable media player, and the Apple Watch smartwatch. Apple's consumer software includes the OS X and iOS operating systems, the iTunes media player, the Safari web browser, and the iLife and iWork creativity and productivity suites. Its online services include the iTunes Store, the iOS App Store and Mac App Store, and iCloud. (Anonymous, 2016) History of Apple Inc. Apple Inc. originated from the friendship and mutual interests of Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs. The Two collaborated in the development of the “Apple” in the early 1970s. The Apple I was a step ahead of most computers of the time featuring a use of a TV as a display system and a cassette interface for recording programs. After obtaining financing for the development of Apple II, the Apple Computer Company was formed in 1970.As the growth of home computer use grew, Apple grew with it. In 1980 the company issued its initial public offering of investment stock. Apple next introduced the Macintosh Computer in 1983 during the Super Bowl. The computers desktop publishing features provided the foundation for future innovations that have become standard for the company. (Malviya, 2011) Current CEO: Tim Cook; after Jobs resigned as CEO and became chairman of the board, Cook was named CEO of Apple Inc. on August 24, 2011. (Tim Cook, n.d.) Marketing Mix of Apple Inc. Apple Inc’s marketing mix indicates how the company matches its business activities to market conditions. This analysis of the firm’s marketing mix provides insights about how to effectively address market conditions and the competitive landscape through appropriate products, distribution, promotion and pricing. Apple continues to use its marketing mix in globally expanding the business through various channels and with a growing product mix, along with an array of promotion strategies. As one of the most admired companies in the world, Apple Inc. serves as an example of how the marketing mix can support business success. (Greenspan, 2015) PRODUCT Apple Inc. has continued to expand its product mix. This component of the marketing mix determines the outputs of the business organization. In Apple’s case, the following are the main product lines:  Mac  iPad  iPod  iPhone  Apple TV  Apple Watch  Software These Apple products currently available in the market show the firm’s diversification in this component of the marketing mix. However, as part of its product development intensive growth strategy, the company continues to develop new products, such as the Apple electric vehicle, which is under development through collaboration with firms like Tesla Motors. This product mix shows that Apple’s marketing mix is extensive in terms of product variety to address customers’ needs in different areas of their lives. (Greenspan, 2015) PRICE Apple is a premium brand computer that does not attempt to compete on price. The company has reduced prices after some initial product launches. It uses skimming and premium pricing strategies.  The Apple iPad is priced at a minimum of $499.  The Apple iPhone costs begin at $99.  The Apple iPod Classic is priced starting at $249.  The Apple iPod Nano costs $149.  The Apple Mac Book costs $999.  The Apple MacBook Pro is priced at $1199.  The Apple Quicktime Pro for Windows costs $29.99 Apples iPad pricing strategy includes the flexibility to lower the prices if consumer response dictates such action. This would be consistent with a similar $200 price cut on the iPhone in 2007. In 2009 Apple announced a reduced cost pricing structure for iTunes – songs will cost 69 cents, 99 cents or $1.29. He said the “vast majority” of the songs will cost 69 cents. Changes are said to be a response to a slower pace of music downloads. (Unknown, n.d.)\n\n2.
