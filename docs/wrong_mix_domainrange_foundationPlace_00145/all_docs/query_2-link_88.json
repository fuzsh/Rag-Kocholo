Lucky we have Dr Em to help, breaking down why they are important and how they can add purpose to your life. As she explains, our values work like a compass, and when used responsibly, can point us in the direction of the person we want to be.\n\nLinks mentioned in the episode:\n\nÂ\n\nð§ Previous episodes of The ImperfectsPat Cummins - Love, Loss & Life -Â https://link.chtbl.com/patcummins\n\nThe Academy of Imperfection - Ben Crowe -Â https://link.chtbl.com/bencrowepurpose\n\nJames Clear - Down The Habit Hole -Â https://link.chtbl.com/jamesclear\n\nChrissie Swan - Honesty -Â https://link.chtbl.com/chrissieswan\n\nðº Things to watch\n\nLife of Brian âIndividualâ -Â https://bit.ly/4bLR74U\n\nÂ\n\nðSteven Hayes books to readÂ\n\nA Liberated Mind -Â Â https://amzn.to/4bRIHJzÂ\n\nAcceptance and Commitment Therapy -Â https://amzn.to/3Wp95ouÂ\n\nð ï¸ Tools to use\n\nThe Resilience Project 6 month journal -Â Â https://bit.ly/3RUBke7\n\nSteve Hayesâ research into values -Â https://bit.ly/4fhrsnU\n\nðº To watch the full episode on YouTube, click here:Â https://bit.ly/46795xC\n\nÂ\n\nThe Imperfects is not a licensed mental health service and is not a substitute for professional mental health advice, treatment or assessment.

Made a call that you couldnât undo? It's a fear for many, and for others, living with the reality of a âroll of the diceâ gone wrong, is cause for great sadness, and discomfort.Â But, there is wisdom in mistakes. And for Poh Ling Yeow, learning to own her bad decisions, meant she could move forward with empathy and acceptance.Â A skill she's honed through a life of âmagooingâ to her way onto our screens through Master Chef, into our kitchens through cookbooks, and very much into our hearts. (Ref. Mr. Magoo).Â\n\nIn fact, the level of maturity Poh is able to bring to so much of her life, is unlike anyone weâve ever met before.\n\nLinks mentioned in this episode.\n\nðºÂ Things to watch\n\nMasterchef on Tenplay - https://bit.ly/4cwzbg8 South Park - Morman fellowshipping of Kyle - https://bit.ly/4cniH9x ð½ï¸Â Things to cook\n\nPohâs latest cookbook - https://bit.ly/4cA1dXo ð¨Â Art to see\n\nPohâs paintings - The Girl - https://bit.ly/45u0rZI The Imperfects is not a licensed mental health service and is not a substitute for professional mental health advice, treatment or assessment.

Does diet actually impact our mental health? What is a gut micro-biome, and can we still eat a few chips without ruining it?In this Academy of Imperfection episode, we are joined one of the worlds leading experts on the relationship between what we eat, and how it effects our mental health, Professor Felice Jacka.\n\nAnd if can we trust anyone to get to the bottom of the vagus nerve âhighwayâ; our hippocampus shrinking; our mitochondrial reaction to ultra-processed foods (donât worry we didnât know these words before either) - itâs her.Â\n\nThere was a lot to 'digest' in this chat (so to speak), but thankfully, there is so much we can do, by making informed choices about what we put in our bodies, to improve our mental health.Â\n\nÂ\n\nSee below for links & research mentioned in this episode, information on Felice and her work and extra resources:\n\nðÂ Things to read\n\nThe Food and Mood centre - https://bit.ly/3xdmkjw.

So much so, that within minutes of Hugh opening and reading Chanelâs book, âConsent Laid Bareâ, he had nominated her for Australian of The Year.Â\n\nIn this snippet from the full episode, Hugh, Ryan, Josh and Chanel discuss the normalised and systemic nature of sexual violence against women and the pervasive issue of rape culture; including what it is and how we can all take steps to dismantle it.Â To learn more about Chanel, her work and the Teach Us Consent campaign, follow this link: https://bit.ly/3QVhlK0\n\nð§Â Things to listen to\n\nChanel Contos - https://link.chtbl.com/mhDPOcpH ðÂ Things to read\n\nConsent Laid Bare - https://bit.ly/40Z0Xgh\n\nTo view a version of the 'rape culture pyramid' - https://bit.ly/49XPFgh\n\nThe Imperfects is not a licensed mental health service and is not a substitute for professional mental health advice, treatment or assessment.

Trips to the Olympics, medals of every colour, 21 world records AND his face on the cover of a Foo Fighters Album, Michael really did have it all.\n\nHowever, in 2022 Michael was diagnosed with a life changing condition, wherein your body attacks itâs own tissue - chronic inflammatory demyelination polyneuropathy (CIDP).\n\nIn this episode, Hugh, Ryan and Josh chat to Michael about his equally impressive life out of the pool, and how his CIDP diagnosis has taught him a lot about identity, grief and relationships.\n\nIn 2023, Michael partnered with Australian Red Cross Lifeblood to help raise awareness for the vital role blood donation plays in not just his life, but the 1 in 3 Australians who will need blood products in their lifetime. To help recipients like Michael and countless others book a blood donation here. https://bit.ly/4c8Z6tN\n\nTo watch the full episode on YouTube, follow this link.Â https://bit.ly/3RHPUoi\n\nÂ\n\nLinks mentioned in the episode and extra resources:\n\nÂ\n\nðºÂ Things to watch\n\nHomer Simpsonâs journey through the Stages of Grief - https://bit.ly/4epRAMJ.
