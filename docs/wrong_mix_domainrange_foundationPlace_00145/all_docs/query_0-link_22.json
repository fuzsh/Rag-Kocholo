When you complete your first course after taking the exam, you will receive official credit for the previous Spanish courses.\n\nMore about Advanced Credit Exams\n\nTo complete a minor in Spanish, you will need to complete 18 credits hours of Spanish courses, with a minimum of 6 credit hours at the 300 or 400 levels.\n\nSPAN 101 does not count toward the Spanish minor.\n\nIf you take Spanish to fulfill a language requirement, you can complete the minor with only three additional courses.
