        "text": "Apple Inc. was born on the 1st of April 1976 and was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. The company’s first product was the Apple I, a personal computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak.\n\nGradually expanding its range of products to consumer electronics and online services, it took the pioneering venture less than half a century to become the world’s largest smartphone manufacturer.\n\nApple history timeline: key milestones\n\nThe Apple Inc. Timeline overviews the important events in the history of the business, including releases of their main products and services. Let’s retrace the major milestones of their journey since establishment until the present day:\n\n1976: Apple Computer Company is founded\n\n1976: Apple I\n\n1977: Apple II\n\n1980: Apple III\n\n1980: Company goes public for $22 per share\n\n1984: The Macintosh\n\n1985: S.

To finance the creation of the device, Jobs sold his VW Kombi van and Wozniak his HP-65 calculator. The prototype was released on the 11th of April 1976, demonstrated 4 months later at the Homebrew Computer Club, and sold at the introductory price of $666 (the equivalent of $2,867 in 2017).\n\n1977: Apple II\n\nApple II (stylized in the logo as “apple ][“)was a pioneering 8-bit home computer introduced in 1977, featuring color graphics, innovative design by Steve Wozniak, and a redesigned Apple logo. It revolutionized the personal computer industry, opening doors to consumer software. Apple II earned acclaim as the greatest PC of all time by PC World in 2006.\n\n1980: Apple III\n\nThe Apple III (stylized as “apple ///”) was the first system designed by Apple as a company. It was a business-focused PC released by Apple in 1980 as a successor to the Apple II series. It was designed to provide business users with features such as a true typewriter-style upper/lowercase keyboard and an 80-column display.\n\nThe product incurred massive expenses in research, development, and promotion. Unfortunately, because of significant design flaws, it became Apple’s first major market failure. Despite a year-long effort to rectify issues such as chip dislodging, malfunctioning clocks, and overheating, solutions came too late.\n\n1980: Company goes public for $22 per share\n\nFour years after its foundation, Apple Computer Inc. went public at $22 per share, which generated the greatest capital that any IPO had done since Ford Motor Company in 1956, making 300 people millionaires overnight.\n\n1984: The Macintosh\n\nThe original Apple Macintosh personal computer, later rebranded as the Macintosh 128K, was introduced in 1984. With a graphical user interface, built-in screen, and mouse, this computer helped popularize desktop publishing due to its ability to handle graphics. The new machine included the powerful 68k microprocessor from the Apple Lisa. Despite initial hurdles, the Macintosh achieved loyal fans and solid sales figures.\n\n1985: Steve Jobs leaves the company\n\nThroughout its activity, the company has seen numerous executive job shuffles, with all three co-founders leaving the board in the early stages and only Jobs returning in 1997 to oversee the rebuilding and consolidation of Apple’s status.\n\n1989: The Macintosh Portable\n\nThe Macintosh Portable, Apple’s first battery-powered Mac, was sold from 1989 to 1991. It featured a sharp monochrome LCD screen that was housed in a unique clamshell design, allowing the screen to fold shut against the keyboard. This innovative laptop also included an integrated trackball for navigation and came in an array of technical configurations to satisfy various user needs.\n\nWhile critics acknowledged the vivid quality of its display, many found the bulky machine to be quite heavy and pricey. Sales failed to meet projections, leading Apple to pull the plug on the Portable in 1991 when they launched their new PowerBook line-up of portable Macs that addressed earlier complaints.\n\n1990: 3 new Macintosh models\n\nIn 1990, Apple rolled out a trio of new Macintosh computers, each tailored for a distinct slice of the personal computer marketplace. First came the Macintosh LC (Low Cost), a relatively inexpensive option designed for mainstream consumers seeking colorful graphical capabilities on a budget. While affordable and attractive visually, its functionality was constrained.\n\nBy contrast, the high-powered Macintosh IIfx workstation aimed higher, with blazing speeds and extensive customization choices to satisfy professional power users handling data-intensive tasks.\n\nBetween these extremes lay the Macintosh Classic, a no-frills machine delivering basic computing skills for essential word processing and spreadsheet duties without fancy flourishes. These three models catered to different segments of the market, providing a range of options for users with varying needs and budgets.\n\n1991: The PowerBook\n\nThe PowerBook 100 was designed by Sony for Apple Computer. It was unveiled at the 1991 COMDEX computer expo. Despite its small marketing budget, the PowerBook line was a success, generating over $1 billion in revenue for Apple in its debut year alone. It was praised for its unique design, with the PowerBook 100 being named the tenth-greatest PC of all time in 2006.\n\n1997: Steve Jobs regains position as CEO\n\nIn 1997, Steve Jobs returned as CEO of Apple, reviving the company’s fortunes after years of struggle. His comeback followed Apple’s acquisition of NeXT, the company he founded during his time away.\n\nWith Jobs back at the helm, Apple underwent a dramatic transformation, introducing ground-breaking products like the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. Jobs’ relentless pursuit of innovation brought Apple to new heights, solidifying its position as a global tech powerhouse. His return marked the beginning of a new era of creativity and dominance for the company.\n\n1997: Apple Online Store\n\nOnce more, 1997 proved a landmark year for Apple. The online Apple Store officially opened on November 10, 1997, and has been online since, offering worldwide buyers direct access to coveted gadgets. The online Apple Store played a crucial role in Apple’s survival and resurgence alongside the return of Steve Jobs and the launch of the iMac and iPod.\n\n1998: The iMac\n\nThe iMac G3, sold by Apple from 1998 to 2003, released under Steve Jobs’ reorganized Apple, proved a landmark in Apple’s history. It featured a distinctive all-in-one design with innovative use of translucent plastic, replacing legacy technologies with CD-ROMs and USB ports.\n\nDespite mixed critical response, the iMac achieved remarkable commercial success, becoming Apple’s fastest-selling computer with over 5 million units sold.\n\n2001: First retail stores\n\nThe opening of Apple stores in 2001 had a strong impact on technology retailing. With innovative architectural designs, the stores quickly became destinations known for exhibiting Apple’s cutting-edge devices.\n\nAs more places launched worldwide, they gained praise for establishing new standards in visual appeal and utility. By combining art and engineering, Apple Stores have transformed business spaces into brand experiences.\n\n2001: The iPod\n\nThe iPod, released by Apple in 2001, changed the way people listened to music. It enabled users to carry thousands of songs in a pocket-sized player and to download straight from the internet. It transformed the way music was accessed and experienced. Hewlett-Packard briefly distributed private labeled iPods for a short time, but conflicts over contractual terms brought that partnership to a halt in 2005.\n\nApple teamed up with U2 in 2006 to deliver a special edition iPod that let fans securely store the band’s entire catalog locally. Both the Nano and Shuffle lines were retired by Apple in July 2017, signaling the end of those product families. On May 10, 2022 the iPod Touch was discontinued, definitively ending the iPod era.\n\n2003: iTune Store\n\nIn 2003, Apple launched the iTunes Store, an online digital media store where users could electronically purchase and download music, TV shows, movies, and other media. It was a new concept at the time that proved highly successful.\n\n2007: Launches the iPhone & Apple TV under new name Apple Inc.\n\nThe year 2007 marked important changes for Apple Computers Inc., which became Apple Inc.\n\nThe corporation introduced the iPhone showing that phones could be so much more than just for calls and texts. It was a multifunctional handheld device that allowed users to communicate, access multimedia, and browse the internet from the palm of their hand.\n\nIn the same year, Apple launched Apple TV, bringing internet video and photos to the family television in a sleek, WIFI-connected package.\n\n2008: App Store\n\nIn 2008, Apple changed the mobile landscape introducing the App Store which allowed iPhone users to directly download a diverse array of applications from a digital marketplace curated by Apple.\n\nThis original concept enabled third-party developers to create and distribute applications from simple games and social media tools to complex productivity apps. Smartphones become personalized multi-functional devices.\n\n2010: The iPad\n\nTwo years later, in 2010, Apple unveiled the iPad, a device similar to the iPhone but with a larger screen, optimized for media consumption and digital content creation.\n\nWith its expansive touchscreen display, the iPad provided users with an immersive experience for watching videos, reading electronically published books and periodicals, and playing games. Its larger screen made it easier to use applications for high-level designing, photo editing, video conferencing, and other work or fun activities.\n\n2010: The iPhone 4\n\nIn 2010, Apple marked another milestone on the iPhone timeline by launching the iPhone 4, a smartphone that featured a sleek design with glass front and rear panels, high-resolution Retina display and enhanced camera system. The device’s debut caused a frenzy, with over 600,000 pre-orders – the largest number of pre-orders Apple has ever taken in a single day, far higher than anticipated. The iPhone 4 attracted widespread acclaim for its cutting-edge aesthetics and capabilities. 2010 was a great year for Apple: they were leading the way in the world of mobile technology.\n\n2010: Apple shares reach an all-time high\n\nOn Wall Street, Apple stock rocketed to an unprecedented $275 per share. This record was achieved as a result of staggering iPhone 4 sales that had prompted the early order process to be briefly suspended due to being overwhelmed by consumer enthusiasm.\n\nAlso, investor optimism was boosted on anticipation of forthcoming products combined with strong sales and financial reports from existing blockbusters.\n\n2011: Jobs resigns (health problems)\n\nIn 2011, Steve Jobs resigned as CEO of Apple due to health issues. Tim Cook took over as Apple CEO in 2011, following Steve Jobs’ death. That same year, Cook introduced the Apple Watch, a new product category for Apple. During the announcement, Cook paid tribute to Jobs by using his famous catchphrase, “one more thing.”\n\n2012: The iPhone 5\n\nThe iPhone 5 was launched on September 12, 2012. It had a new aluminium design, a taller 4-inch screen, a faster processor, high-speed 4G LTE connectivity, and a retooled 8-megapixel iSight camera. It got over two million pre-orders in a day.\n\nYet, early adopters encountered some hardware glitches, and the newly adapted Lightning charging port drew polarized opinions and lingering complaints. Apple stopped selling the iPhone 5 on September 10, 2013, when they introduced the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C, which replaced it.\n\n2017: Clips app\n\nApple introduces Clips, a new app for iPhone and iPad. The app was aimed at empowering everyone with creative expression, allowing easy creation of expressive videos on iPhone and iPad.\n\nThe video editing app allowed users to liven up short capture with effects, stickers, filters and more through an intuitive interface. Clips became a playground for casual content creators of all ages to craft and share moments with just a few taps.\n\n2015: Apple Watch\n\nThe year 2015 marked a major shift in personal technology as Apple launched the Apple Watch, their first wearable. While sleek and stylish in design, the true innovation of the Apple Watch consisted in multiple health and fitness tracking functions.\n\nIt allowed users to monitor vitals, exercise routines, and stay connected through notifications and apps from their wrist.\n\n2016: AirPods\n\nApple caused a stir by announcing in 2016 plans to remove the traditional headphone jack from iPhones. In its place, they launched AirPods, completely wireless earbuds that offered unimpeded music and call experience and became a must-have accessory. Their impressive battery life and seamless pairing made AirPods an instant success story.\n\n2018: Apple’s value reaches $1 trillion\n\nOn September 12th of 2018, Apple made history by becoming the very first publicly traded company to reach an unprecedented market value of one trillion dollars. This achievement showed the tremendous success and worldwide influence of Apple’s many products and services. It marked its dominant position within the market on a global scale.\n\n2023: Apple Vision Pro"
