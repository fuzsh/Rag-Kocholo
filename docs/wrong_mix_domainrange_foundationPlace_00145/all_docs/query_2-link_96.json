        "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of two twin tunnels between Thane and Borivali as well as the BMC’s Goregaon Mulund Link Road and inaugurated developmental projects worth Rs 29,400 crore in Mumbai.\n\n“The development projects launched in Mumbai today will enhance connectivity, significantly upgrade the city’s infrastructure and greatly benefit its citizens,” the prime minister said in an X post.\n\nPM Modi arrived in Mumbai earlier in the day and was felicitated by Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, Deputy CMs Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar.\n\nAccording to officials, the prime minister will also inaugurate important road and rail projects, including the new platforms at Lokmanya Tilak Terminus and the extension of platforms 10 and 11 at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus.\n\n“He will lay the foundation stone for Central Railway’s Kalyan yard remodelling and the Gati Shakti Multi-modal Cargo Terminal at Turbhe in Navi Mumbai. He will dedicate to the nation new platforms at Lokmanya Tilak Terminus and extension of platforms 10 and 11 at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus,” an official said earlier on Friday.\n\nOfficials said the inaugurating and foundation-laying function will be held at NESCO Exhibition Centre in Goregaon. During this visit, Modi will also visit the INS Secretariat at the Bandra Kurla Complex.\n\nWhat are the key projects being launched today?\n\nDuring his visit, the PM will be laying the foundation for the Thane-Borivali Tunnel Project, which is being built at Rs 16,600 crore, an MMRDA spokesperson said. The twin tube tunnels will pass under Sanjay Gandhi National Park and create a direct connection between the Western Express Highway at Borivali and Ghodbunder Road in Thane. The 11.8-km Borivali-Thane Link Road will reduce the journey from Thane to Borivali by 12 km and save an hour in travel time.\n\n“The twin tunnels of the Rs 6,300 crore Goregaon Mulund Link Road (GMLR) project will connect the Western Express Highway at Goregaon to the Eastern Express Highway at Mulund. The project will bring down the travel time to 25 minutes from the current 75 minutes,” said an official of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).\n\nAbout the remodelling of Kalyan Yard, a Central Railway official said it will help segregate suburban and long-distance train traffic on the highly congested network in the Mumbai metropolitan region, in turn improving punctuality and operational efficiency.\n\n“The Gati Shakti Multi-modal Cargo Terminal will enhance the capacity to handle cement and other commodities while creating job opportunities in the region. The new platforms at LTT will be able to accommodate more trains, while extended platforms number 10 and 11 at CSMT will help in the running of 24-coach trains. Both these developments will increase ridership,” the BMC official said.\n\nModi will also launch the ‘Mukhyamantri Yuva Karya Prashikshan Yojana’, which has an outlay of Rs 5,600 crore.\n\n(With PTI inputs)"
