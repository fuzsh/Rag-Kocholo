        "text": "PLANNING YOUR JOURNEY AND YOUR VISIT\n\nHow long should I spend at Stonehenge?\n\nWe think you need at least 2.5 hours to see Stonehenge, but you're welcome to spend as long as you like looking around the exhibition, the Stone Circle and the wider National Trust landscape. We've put together some itineraries to help you plan your time with us.\n\nWhat time are last tickets sold at Stonehenge?\n\nWe sell our last ticket at 2.30pm (4.30pm June/July/August). This is to ensure that visitors are able to enjoy a complete visit, including the walk to and from the stone circle.\n\nI'm going to be more than half an hour late for my time slot, will I still be able to get in?\n\nWe’ll do our best to fit you in if we can, but if we’ve reached capacity for the time slot when you arrive, you will have to wait until the next available time slot.\n\nDoes my time slot relate to a particular bus departure time?\n\nNo, the shuttle buses run every few minutes between the Visitor Centre and the Stones. There is also a walking route to the stones through the ancient landscape, owned and cared for by the National Trust, allowing people to discover the fascinating prehistoric monuments in the landscape.\n\nI'm a National Trust Member, can I come for free?\n\nYes, National Trust England Members can visit Stonehenge for free but we recommend you book a ticket in advance and bring your booking confirmation and NT membership card with you. You may also be asked to show an additional form of photo ID. Please note, this is applicable to the National Trust in England only – it does not include National Trust Scotland or other international National Trust organisations.\n\nCan I bring my dog?\n\nAssistance dogs are welcome across the site including the visitor centre and the stones. All other dogs are welcome at the visitor centre but they aren’t allowed in the field where the stone circle stands, parts of the National Trust landscape where sheep are grazing or on the shuttle bus. For this reason we strongly advise you to leave your pets at home.\n\nIs there anything I can’t bring?\n\nThere are no cloakroom or left luggage facilities so please don’t bring anything other than essential items with you. Certain items such as picnic/pen-knives and scissors are not permitted.\n\nON ARRIVAL\n\nDo I need to pay to park?\n\nParking is free for ticket holders and English Heritage Members. There is a parking charge to non-members and those who have not prebooked tickets.\n\nWhat happens when I arrive?\n\nOnce you've parked, make your way to the Visitor Centre where you'll be welcomed at the admissions point, and your booking confirmation will be checked. If you've ordered a guidebook you can pick this up at this point from the steward. You’ll then be able to either visit the exhibition first or you may prefer to visit the stones first and call in to the exhibition on your return to the Visitor Centre.\n\nWhat happens if I forget my booking confirmation?\n\nYou can show us your booking confirmation as a printout or on your mobile device, but without it, we won’t be able to let you in.\n\nCan I buy a guidebook when I arrive?\n\nGuidebooks are available to buy at the admissions point and in the shop. You can also buy one when you book your tickets online and collect on arrival.\n\nDo you have an audio tour?\n\nYou can download the audio tour free to your own smartphone from the Apple Store or Google Play. Don’t forget to bring your headphones.\n\nAre security checks in operation?\n\nFor safety and security reasons, you and your belongings may be subject to security checks on arrival. This may include a body scan with a hand held detector and a search of your bag. Please allow a little extra time for your visit and only bring essential items with you: this will mean you can start your visit as quickly as possible.\n\nGETTING TO AND FROM THE STONE CIRCLE\n\nHow long is the bus journey from the Visitor Centre to the Stone Circle?\n\nThe visitor bus takes around 5-10 minutes and the buses run frequently throughout the day.\n\nHow do I walk to the Stone Circle from the Visitor Centre?\n\nA well-marked route will direct you from the Visitor Centre through the National Trust permissive open access landscape, passing Bronze Age burial mounds on your way. There are several landscape interpretation panels dotted across the landscape which explain the various features you will see en route. On your return journey we have a dedicated walker's lane from the Stones to the Visitor Centre. This is along the visitor bus route, so please take care and keep within the walker's lane on the left hand side of the road. The walk from the visitor centre to the stones and back is approximately 2.6 miles (4km) much of it across fields and unmade paths. Please make sure you dress appropriately for the weather, wear sturdy shoes and carry water and suncream with you.\n\nHow long will it take me to walk to the Stone Circle?\n\nDepending on your pace, it will take you between 25-40 minutes to walk from the visitor centre to the Stone Circle.\n\nDo I have a set amount of time to see the Stone Circle?\n\nYou can spend as long as you like at the Stone Circle. Visitors will be asked to leave enough time to walk back to the visitor centre before the advertised closing time.\n\nPlease note, all facilities at the Visitor Centre will close promptly at 5pm (7pm June/July/August).\n\nHow will I know how to spot the interesting features?\n\nThe monuments you can visit in the Stonehenge landscape are shown on the free orientation leaflet that you'll be given on arrival.\n\nThere is also a Stonehenge walkers' map which you can buy in the site shop showing all walking routes in the World Heritage Site of Stonehenge and Avebury. The map uses an Ordnance Survey 1:10,000 base and shows and describes both visible and hidden remains, with information about where you can find out more.\n\nThere are several interpretation panels dotted across the National Trust landscape, which explain the various features you'll see en route. The downloadable version of the audio tour has a track which covers some key features in the landscape accessible from Fargo woods.\n\nI am planning to arrive by bike. Where can I leave it and can I cycle to the Stone Circle instead of taking the bus?\n\nWe welcome cyclists. Cycle racks at the visitor centre are located in the car park.\n\nAT THE STONE CIRCLE\n\nHow close can I get to the Stone Circle from the visitor path?\n\nAt some points, you are as close as 5m from the Stone Circle from the visitor path.\n\nCan I walk all around the Stone Circle\n\nThe visitor path goes all the way around the Circle and is a mixture of both hard-standing and grass. On rare occasions we may need to close parts of the grass path for safety reasons – if it has been particularly wet for example. If this is the case when you visit, you will be told when you arrive and we will ensure that as much of the path is open as possible. We are currently operating a one-way system around the stones but there is plenty of space for you to stop, take photos and enjoy the view.\n\nWhat should I wear?\n\nThe Stone Circle is in an exposed position and we always advise our visitors to wrap up warm whatever time of year they visit. Please remember that the walk from the visitor centre to the stones is through uneven fields, so sensible footwear is essential.\n\nIs there any shelter at the Stone Circle?\n\nThe monument sits in its open prehistoric landscape so there is no shelter at the Stone Circle.\n\nAre there any toilets at the Stone Circle?\n\nNo, toilet facilities are located at the Visitor Centre but additional hand sanitising stations will be available across the site."
