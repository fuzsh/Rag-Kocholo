        "text": "Apple Inc was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak and was officially registered in 1977. Apple Inc is a top technology company that specializes in creating and designing smartphones, tablets, wearables, and desktop computers. The company also provides various services such as iCloud, Apple Inc Care, and digital content. Apple. is a company that is focused on innovation and operates in an industry that is known for its rapid technological advances. Apple. understands the value of innovation and the need to introduce new products; as a result, the firm continues to invest in (R&D) to guarantee the timely and consistent introduction of services and goods that are competitive. Apple. frequently files patent applications and holds any intellectual property rights such as trademarks, copyrights, and patents. Apple believes that intellectual property rights are essential to protect its innovations and products and ensure its continuous business success.\n\nApple Inc employs direct and indirect distribution channels to sell its products to its customers. via its physical stores and online shops, Apple. sells its products directly to its consumers, educational institutions, small and mid-size businesses, and government customers. Indirect distribution channels used by the company to market its goods and services include \"third-party cellular network providers, wholesalers, retailers, and resellers.\n\nApple Inc's generic strategy for its extensive products and services is differentiation The business distinguishes its goods and services by emphasizing great customer service, ease of use, and distinctive design. The strategy of Apple. places a strong emphasis on the aesthetics and usability of its products, the development of the Apple Inc ecosystem, and a reduction in the company's reliance on the sale of iPhones. The business uses product development, market penetration, and market development as part of its growth strategy to forge competitive advantages and strengthen its market position. The corporate-level strategies employed by Applauded inter-nationalization, strategic partnerships, alliances, and diversification.\n\nApple. is leading the technology industry as it has many core competencies that give it a robust competitive advantage. The organization has a robust and distinctive business strategy that is concentrated on quick and frequent innovation, high-quality and reliable products, and outstanding customer service. Apple Inc has managed to attain and maintain rare competencies that are VRINE, valuable, rare, Inimitability and Non-substitutability, and Exploitability so the advantages can be captured.\n\nIn August 2018, Apple Inc became the first U.S. firm valued at over $1 trillion. This was followed by valuations of $2 trillion in August 2020 and, most recently, $3 trillion in January 2022. The corporation is criticized for its environmental practices, corporate ethics, especially anti-competitive actions, and the labor abuses of its contractors. Despite this, the business has a sizable fan base and a high level of brand loyalty. One of the most valuable brands in the world, according to rankings.\n\nApple Inc's innovation in the microprocessor industry\n\nAn organization may easily accomplish both its long-term and short-term goals through strategic management. The majority of the best-performing businesses on the global market often employ the best #strategicmanagement techniques. Strategic management techniques are well-developed and successful at Apple. Due to this, the business has managed to maintain its high level of performance.\n\nAfter 15 years, in 2020, Apple Inc ended its collaboration with Intel in favor of its processors for Apple Inc. laptops and desktop devices. Instead of using Intel CPUs, they now use Apple Inc M1 chip. One of the most successful collaborations in the computer sector has come to an end with the long-awaited separation. Since 2005, Intel has produced CPUs for Macs, but Apple Inc is currently attempting to gain more control over the manufacturing of its hardware by making a big shift in the semiconductor industry. The action demonstrates the expanding ability of digital giants to increase their capabilities and decrease their reliance on strategic partners. Apple Inc wants to speed up its product development and increase revenue by having its production line. This action was essential for Apple To finish its strategy of vertical integration and gain control over a crucial part of its hardware.\n\nBefore 2020\n\nApple Inc ended its collaboration with IBM and began using Intel CPUs in its devices. Apple Inc started a phased switch to Intel's CPUs in 1995 after using IBM's PowerPC processors in 1994. Apple Inc intended to switch to Intel processors in the middle of 2006 for models like the Mac Mini and the middle of 2007 for devices like the Power Mac. The process of switching the central processing unit (CPU) of Apple Inc's range of Mac computers and its servers at the time from PowerPC to Intel x86 processors is known as the \"Mac transition to Intel CPUs.\" Steve Jobs, then-CEO of Apple, made the announcement during the 2005 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), saying the company will progressively quit utilizing PowerPC processors made by Freescale (previously Motorola) and IBM. (Apple. June 6, 2005). Retrieved June 23, 2020. This was Apple Inc’s. the second alteration to the personal computers' CPU instruction set architecture. The first occurred in 1994 when Apple Inc switched from the Motorola 68000 series original architecture of the Mac to the then-new PowerPC platform. (Shankland, Stephen -June 22, 2020).\n\nAlthough Apple Inc’s. the first press release said that the transition would start in June 2006 and be complete by the end of 2007, things really moved forward considerably more swiftly. With Mac OS X 10.4.4 Tiger, the first-generation Intel-based Macintoshes were made available in January 2006. Jobs revealed the last models to make the conversion in August, with the Mac Pro going on sale right away and the Intel Xserve following in October. Cohen, Peter (August 6, 2006). (it actually shipped in December). (Apple. June 9, 2008). Leopard (version 10.5), which was made available by Apple Inc in October 2007, was the last version of the Mac OS to utilize PowerPC processors. Snow Leopard from 2009 was the last version to execute programs created for PowerPC CPUs utilizing the Rosetta binary translator (version 10.6).\n\nMacBook revenue before 2020\n\nEven with Apple Inc's shift in priorities from PC to mobile, MacBook has remained a core part of the company’s product portfolio. Apple Inc has kept a core set of products: MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac Pro, and iMac. While there have been iterations and new models, this core has remained popular across a broad spectrum of professional customers sales have been flat or in decline for the past decade, but Apple Inc has added more revenue and sales almost every year. In 2019, MacBook revenue was 7.8% of all Apple Inc products, which was 8675 million US dollars of the total revenue of 91819 million US dollars. Here, the decision maker in Apple Inc was thinking to start owning the technology of creating its own processor which helps her in increasing the revenue and to reflect this on the iPhone production later as well.\n\nApple Inc’s SWOT\n\nThe strategic variables that affect CEO Tim Cook's and managers' decisions on the direction of the company are presented in this SWOT analysis of Apple. With operations in several global markets, the corporation interacts with varied SWOT variables depending on local circumstances.\n\nStrengths:\n\n· Brand Value: For the seventh year in a row, Apple Inc's brand worth has climbed to $612 billion, according to Interbrand.

They start working on creating a new one as soon as one is finished and launched.\n\n· Wide Ranges of Products: Apple Inc is able to turn a profit because of the variety of items they provide. Product lines include Electric Vehicles, Software, MacBook, iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple Inc Watch, Apple IncTV, and Apple Inc Energy. Apple Inc guarantees that by diversifying its holdings, it can offer cutting-edge technologies to its customers. Some of these goods are moneymakers. This shows that the most sales and popularity go to these particular items.\n\n· Design & Technology: Apple Inc's technology and design are its finest features and the foundation of its outstanding brand equity. Apple Inc has always produced products with a posh and attractive appearance.\n\n· Financing Strength: To support all of its investments and research to improve its goods and services, it has a strong financial standing.Expansion in services: For many years, Apple Inc has been expanding its portfolio with new services.\n\n· Retail Stores: Apple Inc retail establishments promise a superior customer experience and one-on-one contact with knowledgeable employees.\n\n· Consumer Focus: Apple Inc continually considers the consumer and the future while designing its products.\n\n· Brand Of Choice: For any corporation's needs, Apple Inc has a dedicated business website that offers top-notch technological solutions.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n· Expensive Products: Apple Inc's items might appear to be upscale luxury due to their high price.\n\n· The decline in Market Share: Due in large part to their reliance on the iPhone and iPad series, Apple Inc's market share is also declining.\n\n· Limited Advertising & Promotions: By cultivating committed clients, Apple Inc has managed to maintain its position despite making few promotional investments.\n\n· Limitations: It is not flexible if you want to use it with devices made by other manufacturers. Software obtained from sources other than Apple Inc cannot be installed.\n\n· Limited Product Line: The range of products offered by Apple.\n\n· Incompatibility: One of the company's top worries is the incompatibility of Apple Inc devices with third-party accessories and software.\n\nOpportunities :\n\n· Loyal Customers: People that use Apple Inc equipment demonstrate their brand loyalty by showing an interest in new products.\n\n· Widespread Distribution Network: The current state of Apple Inc's distribution system leaves little room for growth.\n\n· Experienced Professionals: The product experts, researchers, and developers of Apple Inc are highly skilled professionals with a wealth of expertise in consumer product branding.\n\n· Greater Dependence on Technology: People are becoming more and more dependent on technology, especially cell phones. They were more enthusiastic about handheld electronics.\n\n· Globalization: Consumers may now get technology items extremely easily because of market globalization.\n\n· Artificial Intelligence: Apple Inc should take advantage of artificial intelligence to increase its profit margins and hold onto its leading position in the market.\n\nThreats :\n\n· Supply Chain Disruption: The organization's operations have been impacted and disrupted by several recent occurrences.\n\n· Changes in Technology trends: Nearly every day, consumer gadgets are at the forefront of technology.\n\n· New competitors: Despite its fame as a brand, Apple Inc nevertheless faces threats from rivals.\n\n· Imitation and Counterfeits: Unauthorized retailers sell Apple Inc knockoffs for the same price as real Apple Inc items.\n\n· Coronavirus: China plays a significant role in Apple Inc’s supply chain and production.\n\n· Market Potential for Tablets and Smartphones: Throughout history, demand for smartphones has decreased by 3%.\n\nApple Inc Macro-environment and PESTLE analysis\n\nThe excellent performance of Apple. is correlated with its ability to effectively address external issues in its distant or macro-environment. The corporation's success is attributable to its strategic management, which seizes opportunities and defends the company against challenges in the consumer electronics and information technology services sectors.\n\n· Political Factors: Over time, significantly better free trade policies are developed. This external strategic aspect expands Apple.'s distribution prospects for more of its products globally. The political external issue of trade conflicts, particularly those between the United States and China, constitutes a danger to the company's perspective growth and the worldwide sales revenues of its products, such as consumer electronics, despite these trends that provide prospects. For instance, escalating tensions between China and the United States may prompt China to raise tariffs on imported electrical parts used in Apple Inc product production. Utilizing political possibilities in its distant or macroenvironment can help Apple Inc function better, but vigilance is required to maintain stability amid trade disagreements.\n\n· Economic Factors: Opportunities for Apple Inc’s growth are created by the industrialized nations' stable economies. However, a more important economic external element supporting the expansion of the technology industry is the emerging world's rapid economic growth. For instance, Apple Inc has the chance to enhance its income through sales in these international areas given the strong economic development rates of Asian nations. The company's relatively expensive technological items have more possibilities to be sold as a result of rising disposable incomes. It is crucial to take the dynamics of competition in the global market into account while taking advantage of these economic prospects. These outside strategic variables point to growth possibilities for the company and its rivals. Because other companies are pursuing the same business possibilities, Apple.'s the development and expansion strategies must be quick and efficient.\n\n· Social factor: The rising desire for gadgets like smartphones and tablets is related to this social external factor. Another socio-cultural trend that has created chances for Apple Inc to sell more of its products due to increased demand is the growing reliance on digital technology. Despite these changes, the corporation must deal with popular criticism of its commercial practices. Concerns about Apple Inc's business practices are growing, including the company's legal actions against independent repair shops that fix items like the iPhone and MacBook. These opinions have the ability to harm the company's technology goods' reputation and consumer trust. The significance of Apple Inc’s CSR approach is emphasized by these socio-cultural aspects. Customers, governments, and other stakeholders are all satisfied with such an approach.\n\n· Technology Factor: This recognizes the possibility for corporate growth presented by the rising demand for cloud computing. Cloud services are now available from the corporation, albeit in a restricted capacity. By taking advantage of this chance and receiving assistance from Apple Inc’s corporate framework, expanding the cloud infrastructure might enhance the company's profitability in providing cloud computing services. Accordingly, the chance to improve the company's services and expand the business by making its technology products and services available to additional clients, including organizations, is presented by the external strategic aspect of expanding technological integration. Additionally, the expansion of the mobile industry presents Apple. with a chance to increase its earnings, particularly those from the App Store and other digital content distribution channels.\n\n· Environmental Factors: As organizations become more inclined to embrace sustainable practices due to worries about how their activities may affect the environment, there is a trend toward business sustainability. According to this research on Apple., such an ecological trend presents a chance to improve the company's reputation. A further ecological external element that encourages firms and consumers to embrace newer, more efficient technology is the energy efficiency movement. Apple Inc has the chance to increase its operational cost-effectiveness in this area while providing more alluring items to a client base that is becoming more environmentally conscious. Apple Inc addresses these ecological and environmental concerns in its distant or macro-environment using this methodology. The business has taken deliberate steps to modify its business practices and technical offerings in response to these ecological changes. The operations management at Apple. supports business initiatives to take advantage of the possibilities presented by these developments.\n\n· Legal factor: Government pressure to protect privacy has led to a rise in privacy legislation for companies like Apple. This external legal danger poses a risk that the technology business may be subject to greater restrictions and expensive regulatory compliance obligations. However, this research points to the same outside element as a development that offers Apple Inc the chance to grow its company through improved privacy safeguards. The firm also encounters legal difficulties because of its after-sales service procedures and policies, among other business-related issues. According to this model, Apple Inc must place a strong emphasis on privacy protection and legal compliance in all of its products and may want to change some of its policies and procedures in response to recent legal demands on the company.\n\nStrategy diamond for entering the processors market\n\nApple Inc develops a better plan by working through Strategy Diamond's five areas:\n\n· Arena: Apple Inc is entering processor manufacturing, in the laptop/desktops segment globally.\n\n· Vehicles: Internal development through manufacture in Taiwanese.\n\n· Differentiators: Quality of the processor and the technology used in designing it to increase the speed and performance.\n\n· Staging: Apple Inc chooses the right timing to enter this market as covid affects the manufacturing supply chain, with the high demand for laptops regarding the lockdowns and remote work and studying.\n\n· Economic Logic: Because their consumers are ready to pay more for Apple Inc's distinctive design and performance, they can demand higher pricing.\n\nAcquiring the technology\n\nReferring to the previous analysis (Strategy diamond, SWOT, and PESTEL), Apple Inc decided to proceed with owning the technology of MacBook processors.\n\nApple Inc. The supply chain approach is complete control. The creation of iPhones and iPads, as well as the creation of the iOS, macOS, and other programs, are examples of this. To be more precise, the business designs and engineers the system-on-chip (SoC) hardware that contains various processing units and communication components, among others, for these devices. It then outsources the fabrication and production of these components to manufacturers. The business also creates the operating system for these devices and manages the creation of the apps created by outside software developers. Apple Inc felt the need to Integrate its supply chain in M1 processor production and depend on its competencies and resources in manufacturing all parts of its products.\n\nThe M1 chip, Apple Inc’s. The most potent processor to date is comparable to the A14 chip used in the most recent iPhone and iPad Air models and was produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company using a 5-nanometer manufacturing process (TSMC). All of Apple Inc’s. chips are made by TSMC, which has been doing so for many years. Although the chips are made by a third party, Apple Inc has complete control over how they are integrated into the company's hardware and software.\n\nThe #innovation in M processors\n\nThe #M1 powers the various features in the MacBook as a \"System on a Chip\" by integrating several different components, including the CPU, GPU, unified memory architecture (RAM), Neural Engine, Secure Enclave, SSD controller, image signal processor, encode/decode engines, Thunderbolt controller with USB 4 support, and more. Apple Inc's efforts to combine these processors are the reason the M1 is so much quicker and more effective than earlier Intel CPUs. Before Apple Inc’s silicon, MacBooks utilized numerous chips for CPU, I/O, and security. The M1's unified memory architecture, which Apple Inc has included, is also a significant element since it allows all of the technologies to access the same data without switching between different memory pools.\n\nApple Inc’s processor position in the market\n\nThe two-year-old Apple IncM1 chip is at least three years ahead of any rival in the ARM processor market. Qualcomm is now Apple Inc's closest rival, but it hasn't yet made a processor that can compete with the M1 platform. The MacBook maker was able to create the M2 generation of CPUs, which debuted in early June. Analysts predict that Qualcomm's revenue share in the same market as Apple Inc will be just 3%. With a market share of approximately 90% in ARM chipsets for laptops, Apple Inc is without a doubt the industry leader. The benchmark was created by the Apple Inc M-series CPU, which gave the business a three-and-a-half-year lead over the rest of the ARM devices. It's important to note that Qualcomm has long promised to create an M1 rival, but the announcement will probably be made by the time the Apple IncM3 is ready in 2023 or 2024. Elsewhere, Mac computers continued to grow strongly after Apple Inc transitioned its lineup to use its M1 chips instead of Intel processors. Sales were up nearly 15% year over year to $10.44 billion.\n\nApple Inc became a leading provider of PC-grade Arm SoCs after switching to its bespoke Arm-based system-on-chips, which helped the business boost sales of its systems. With regard to Arm, its instruction set architecture now controls close to 9% of the worldwide PC market. With about 90% of the revenue, Apple Inc has established itself as a distant market leader in Arm-based notebook PC CPUs. Chromebooks and Windows-on-Snapdragon always-connected PCs (ACPC) based on different Arm-powered SoCs have been available from manufacturers including Acer, Dell, and HP for years. However, due to their subpar performance and/or expensive price, these PCs have never really gained popularity. Apple Inc succeeded to deliver competitive performance and attractive design with its M1-based iMacs, MacBooks, and Mac Minis debuted in 2020 and throughout 2021, and it also managed to price those systems extremely competitively (e.g., below previous-generation systems containing Intel's CPUs). As a result, it garnered sales from both existing and potential consumers.\n\nApple Inc’s revenue last 3 years\n\nAccording to the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Apple Inc’s revenue has increased in the last 3 years, especially in 2021 as it jumped 18.63%\n\nApple Inc’s revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2022, was $97.278B, an 8.59% increase year-over-year.\n\nApple Inc’s revenue for the twelve months ending March 31, 2022, was $386.017B, an 18.63% increase year-over-year.\n\nApple Inc’s annual revenue for 2021 was $365.817B, a 33.26% increase from 2020.\n\nApple Inc’s annual revenue for 2020 was $274.515B, a 5.51% increase from 2019.\n\nApple Inc’s annual revenue for 2019 was $260.174B, a 2.04% decline from 2018.\n\nThe transition impact on Apple Inc’s numbers\n\nEven if the PC market had better sales in 2020, it has been slowly declining over the previous ten years. This is not the case for Apple, which has increased its total market share and boosted sales virtually after Covid. Apple Inc has maintained a core lineup of devices for the past ten years, including the iMac, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Pro. Despite modifications and new models, its core has continued to be well-liked by a wide range of professional clients. Apple Inc now controls the whole #MacBook stack thanks to its switch to M #processors . Apple Inc has worked hard to take care of everything on its own throughout its existence. But that's not just some corporate ego; it's a strategy with significant benefits. Apple Inc is able to advance both the operating system and the hardware at the same time because it controls both.\n\nAs science and technology advance quickly, new electronic items are always being developed, and the market rivalry for these products is getting increasingly tough. When it comes to SWOT analysis, Apple Inc has a number of competitive advantages, such as its well-known brand, outstanding inventive research, and sophisticated operating system. In fact, it has a number of flaws, such as a high purchase price, a restricted advertising marketing plan, and compatibility issues with other third-party programs. The #business must take advantage of possibilities in several industries, such as green energy and autonomous driving #technologies , by utilizing its quick innovation processes. Apple Inc must undoubtedly deal with risks like the coronavirus pandemic, fierce rivalry from other major companies, and the effects of the trade war. PETSEL analysis was used to assess Apple Inc's risk. Apple Inc was impacted by political considerations in both good and negative ways. For instance, Apple Inc may benefit from free trade policies while yet having to deal with trade disruption issues. The global economy must revive in order for Apple Inc to expand economically and for the distribution of vaccinations. Additionally, societal variables have a big impact on how profitable Apple Inc is. Apple Inc has a significant number of changes due to the technical component in general, which enables the business to innovate and produce more useful services and products. It was obvious from the Strategy diamond analysis that Apple Inc had all the needed aspects to enter the microprocessors market. Apple Inc made a big move in entering a new market (Processors). In this report, we saw how Apple Inc’s strategy of entering new markets is always a winning strategy. Using the different techniques in analyzing the market and the macro-environment is an important aspect of managing the strategy. Apple Inc decided to end the 15 years of alliance with Intel in microprocessors and exploit all the resources and capabilities it has to manage the innovation and own the technology that had been shared with different companies. This gave Apple Inc full control of the MacBook supply chain through this backward vertical integration strategy. The revenue of MacBook increased at a very high pace and reached the highest in the past 10 years number as well as the sales. #apple Inc was smart in this movie. Apple Inc made use of the opportunity to consider its flaws and transformed them into positives. Apple Inc is the winner, they own technology, controlled its products, acquired a high percentage of the market, is at least two years ahead of its competitors, and increased its product and overall revenue.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
