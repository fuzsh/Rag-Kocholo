        "text": "The Apple II\n\nWhen it debuted in 1977, the Apple II was promoted as an extraordinary computer for ordinary people. The user-friendly design and graphical display made Apple a leader in the first decade of personal computing.\n\nUnlike the earlier Apple I, for which users had to supply essential parts such as a case and power supply, the Apple II was a fully realized consumer product. Design and marketing emphasized simplicity, an everyday tool for home, work, or school.\n\n“Introducing Apple II” ad\n\nLike many computer and technology ads at the time, Apple’s early promotional material was dominated by text. Several decades later, some of the most memorable Apple ads would only have a word or two, such as “Think Different” or “iPod.”\n\nView Artifact Detail\n\nA Tale of Two Steves\n\nSteve Wozniak and Steve Jobs founded Apple Computer in 1976. Corporate headquarters? The Jobs family garage.\n\nWozniak and Jobs met in 1971, creating and selling “Blue Boxes,” devices for making free long-distance calls. After stints at Hewlett Packard and Atari respectively, they reunited, formed Apple, and demonstrated the Apple I to the savvy hobbyists at the Homebrew Computer Club.\n\nIt was their more fully developed Apple II, however, that established Apple. They built the company with Jobs focusing on promotion and creating a distinct Apple identity, and Wozniak as the designer."
