He asked his studio assistant Hisachika “Sachika” Takahashi to have the eaten apple cast in metal, which Sachika did at a Chinatown jeweler. A rubber mold was later made and used to create five more cast apples in 24 karat gold, five in sterling silver, and five in bronze.\n\nFor today’s #RRFStaffPick, Curatorial Intern Mounira Makar chooses “Untitled” (2001). “This piece fascinates me because, although it’s cast in 24 karat gold, it has a modest intimacy, having resulted from a close collaboration between Rauschenberg and Sachika. In Sachika’s oral history he shares the origin of the apple trees on the roof of Rauschenberg’s studio: ‘What happened is you have a flower, a coming flower, but no insects to pollinate it. So I have an idea and I put in two feathers in long sticks and I went through, one by one in the flowers—to pollinate. It ended up I had one hundred apples growing in the tree.’ There is something touching about this story of accidentally growing one hundred apples, fruit that was then given to each person who visited the studio as gifts. I also find interesting the idea of casting the impressions of one’s presence—to see the bite marks and the various grooves captured and made permanent on the work’s surface. No larger than a couple of inches, ‘Untitled’ feels deeply unpretentious to me.” \n\nImage 1: Robert Rauschenberg, “Untitled,” 2001. Cast 24 karat gold.
