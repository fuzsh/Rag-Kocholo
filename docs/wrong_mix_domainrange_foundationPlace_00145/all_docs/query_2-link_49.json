        "text": "It’s back again – Amazon Prime Day…err…Days. That means that most (all?) Amazon country/regional properties are doing pretty substantial deals across the board on all sorts of products for today and tomorrow (July 16th and July 17th).\n\n#1) Garmin Epix for $449: No surprise here, this is an incredible deal, especially given it’s still getting new feature updates, as recently as this past weekend. Note: This is *STILL* available. Once you click on the product link, then choose on the sidebar ‘other options’, and you’ll see it there for $319 for delivery in 10 days. Also, check both color options for non-solar.\n\n#2) Garmin Forerunner 955 for $319: Also not surprised on this one, by far the lowest price we’ve ever seen the FR955. Note: This is *STILL* available. Once you click on the product link, then choose on the sidebar ‘other options’, and you’ll see it there for $319 for delivery in two weeks.\n\n#3) Apple AirPod Pro for $168: Interestingly, they dropped the price further mid-day from $188 to $168, and that seems to have done the trick to push this into the top 5. My go-to headphones for daily (and running) usage.\n\n#4) Garmin Edge 1040 for $449: Again, no surprise here – an amazing deal, especially given it’s getting all the new Edge 1050 features too.\n\n#5) Garmin Varia Radar Taillight for $149: I’m actually surprised this broke into the top-5, as it’s kinda the usual sale price. But hey, a deal is a deal.\n\nIn some ways, a July sale date for sports tech items is timed perfectly. That’s because typically Black Friday deals are for ‘older’ things, rarely the ‘just announced’ stuff that often comes in the late August to October timeframe (especially cycling trainers and watches). But with Amazon Prime Day being in July, there’s more opportunity for brands to put things on sale for a one-off summer day. Typically speaking though, don’t expect to see things on sale that were announced this year.\n\nTo take advantage of Amazon Prime Days you simply need to be an Amazon Prime member. The good news is that you can sign-up for the free trial and cancel later if you don’t find value in it. Just hit up this giant banner below to do so:\n\nI’ve organized all the best sports technology Amazon Prime Days deals (and a few others I’ve found) below in the tables by category. I’ll be updating them throughout the next two days. Keep in mind not all deals last (in fact, most don’t). So if you see something that’s hot, I’d strongly suggest buy now (and return later if need be).\n\nWith that, onto the deals! And thanks for supporting the site via the links below. As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases. Enjoy!\n\nWatches & Wearables:\n\nThis covers anything you can wear that’s watch-like or activity band-like, including sensors. Generally speaking, you’ll mostly find deals here that are on things I’ve written about in the past. So you won’t find a deal on some random non-sports tech watch here, or on socks. Unless the socks have some crazy sensor or something in them.\n\nThere are no deals currently.\n\nCycling Gear & Trainers:\n\nGot a bike? Then this section is for you. Everything from bike computers to bike lights to trainers, it’s all here. I won’t generally be adding things like brake cables or bike seats here, but if I find a good deal on a cassette to stack on that new direct drive trainer you just bought, I’ll probably list it here.\n\nThere are no deals currently.\n\nAnd then here’s a separate bucket for trainers and indoor bikes:\n\nThere are no deals currently.\n\nAction Cameras & Drones:\n\nWanna record it? No better way than an action camera. Anything that’s action camera-related or drone-related, you’ll find here. That’s especially true of action camera mounts, which are often found for great deals around the holidays. Same goes with drones and drone accessories. Usually a great time to pick up an extra battery or extra props.\n\nThere are no deals currently.\n\nOther Sports & Fitness:\n\nAnything else that’s sports and fitness related that I think is interesting will be here. It may not be super techy – but it’s stuff that most readers will be using in pursuit of their running/cycling/swimming/hiking/whatever.\n\nThere are no deals currently.\n\nDCR Random Gadget List:\n\nThis is basically the mostly totally unrelated gadgets and things I think are cool deals that I’ve likely bought one or five of (you can never have too many, right)? Some of it’s probably photography stuff. Some of it’s random stuff like chargers and battery packs that I use daily, fun camera gear I use to make videos like sliders and turntables, and well…just random things you’ll find around the DCR Cave. It’s all random…but it’s all awesome randomness!\n\nThere are no deals currently.\n\nWith that – thanks for reading, and for supporting the site via the links above."
