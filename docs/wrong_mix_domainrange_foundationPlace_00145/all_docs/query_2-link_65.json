        "text": "Pick out some person whom you admire and imitate him or her as closely as you can. This may be hero worship, but it improves character. The difference between starry-eyed hero worship and thoughtful emulating of role models lies in the ability to make the distinction between good character traits and ones that may not be so good. Your heroes won’t be perfect; none of us are. Recognize that we are all human, forgive your heroes if they display failings, and continue to emulate the things about them that you like and respect. Comparing your own character to that of others who have achieved great success in their fields broadens your horizons and elevates your goals. When you see what others have done and the character they have developed in the process, you will be able to better recognize how to improve your own performance.\n\nSome people resemble a cheap watch, they are not dependable. It would be unrealistic to expect an inexpensive, mass-produced watch to perform with the same degree of accuracy as a finely crafted Rolex. They are not made with the same quality of materials or with the same craftsmanship.Yet we somehow think that we do not need to give the same attention to our most important asset: ourselves. Don’t leave something as important as your character to chance. Choose the character traits you admire, and work to develop them. Don’t be discouraged when you stumble. Building character is a process that takes a lifetime to complete. Fortunately, like anything else, the more you work at character building, the better you become at it.\n\nSound character is our greatest asset because it provides the power with which we may ride the emergencies of life instead of going down under them. Without PMA (a Positive Mental Attitude), life might be described as long periods of uncertainty punctuated by occasional emergencies that shake you to the very core of your being. The emergencies may be financial, personal, or health-related, but each must be dealt with separately and swiftly. The surest way to deal with any crisis is to focus on solutions, not on the probable cause of the problem or who should be blamed for it. Conduct a quick damage assessment, take the time to think through the alternatives and their consequences, and then act to implement the best solution. If you deal with life’s emergencies as they occur—on your terms—you will be a stronger, better person for having looked them in the eye and conquered them.\n\nYour reputation is what people think you are; your character is what you are. You want your reputation and your character to match, but concentrate on your character. You may be able to fool others about the kind of person you really are for a time, but it seldom lasts for long. The surest way to make your character and your reputation the same is to live your life in such a way that nothing you do would embarrass you if it were printed on the front page of the newspaper. Good character means not ever taking ethical shortcuts, even though everyone else may be doing so. You build good character by doing the right thing because it’s the right thing to do.\n\nHappiness is found in doing — not merely in possessing. It’s true: money can’t buy happiness. Most of us are motivated by aspirations of the lifestyle we desire for ourselves and our families, not by the physical possessions — homes, vacations, automobiles, etc. When you recognize this fact, you will know that you must constantly “raise the bar” to encourage yourself to reach higher goals. Your goals should include the possessions that you desire, but as former Apple Computer chairman and CEO John Sculley said, “Success is a journey, not a destination. Make sure you enjoy the trip.”\n\nEvery brain is both a broadcasting station and a receiving station for the vibrations of thought. Whatever the actual science of thought transmissions may be, it is true that if you wish to receive the power contained in the thoughts of others, you must condition your mind to receive those ideas. Listening helps condition your mind to receive valuable information contained in the thoughts of others. Set aside any preconceived notions you may have about the topic, and listen attentively and nonjudgmentally to what is being said. Focus on the information, not on the speaker. Try to identify key concepts behind the speaker’s words. Train your mind to identify and absorb information that others often miss because their “receivers” are not tuned to the proper frequency.\n\nYou can’t control others’ acts, but you can control your reaction to their acts, and that is what counts most to you. No one can make you feel any negative emotion — fear, anger, or inferiority — without your express permission. There will always be people who find perverse enjoyment in upsetting others, or who simply play upon your emotions so that they can use you for their own selfish purposes. Whether or not they are successful depends entirely upon you and how you react to their negative behaviors. When you are forced to deal with such people, recognize from the outset that they are trying to upset you, not because of something you may have done to them, but because of some problem they have with themselves. Tell yourself, “This isn’t about me. I will not allow this person to upset me. I am in control of my emotions and my life.”\n\nThose who will not take a chance seldom have one thrust upon them. Success always involves risk. You must take a chance by investing your time, money, and effort. It pays to be thoughtful and deliberate in your analyses of opportunities, but don’t let timidity hold you back. Because you have worked hard to develop those things you must risk, it is natural for you to place a high value on them. But what good are they if you do not put them to use? You will recognize opportunity only to the extent that you are willing to consider risking your time, money, and effort. Being confident gives you the courage to face risk and act when opportunity arises. No one on earth is going to force success upon you; you will find it only to the degree that you actively seek it out.\n\nShow me how to save a thin dime on any operation in the plant, and I’ll show you how to get quick and adequate promotion. When you search for ways to save money for your company, you are thinking like a manager or owner. Every manager worth his paycheck knows that in a high-volume manufacturing operation a savings of a few pennies on any process will quickly add up to thousands of dollars. And an individual who figures out a way to save the company thousands of dollars is marked for advancement; he or she is simply too valuable not to promote. The best person to improve productivity in your job is you. No other person knows your job as intimately as you do. Motivate yourself to improve continually by competing with yourself. As you perform a specific task, look for shortcuts that will help you finish it faster. Use the time you save to analyze other parts of your job, volunteer to help others with difficult or time-consuming tasks, or to tackle a new, more rewarding assignment."
