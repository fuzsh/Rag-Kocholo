Project Background (2016)

In May 2016 the City of Lafayette was awarded an "Activating Places and Spaces Together" grant from the Colorado Health Foundation. CHF's goal of funding this grant is to help activate existing infrastructure in public places that contribute to a community's overall health through residential usage and positive experiences.

Lafayette's project, dubbed Activate Lafayette, will develop a new community-wide mobile phone app intended to connect and engage users to public spaces, parks, trails, art, historic points of interest, and other public features in the Lafayette community.

Activity on this project began in July2016 with community input opportunities. The mobile app will be finalized with launch activities happening Summer 2017.
