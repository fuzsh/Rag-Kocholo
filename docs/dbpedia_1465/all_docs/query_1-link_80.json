        "text": "According to reports, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has picked out his preferred replacement for Julian Alvarez, who is set to join Atletico Madrid.\n\nThe La Liga giants have been linked with Alvarez since this summer transfer window opened and they have an agreement in place to sign the World Cup winner.\n\nAlvarez has impressed for Man City in recent seasons, grabbing 36 goals and 18 assists in his 103 appearances for the Premier League champions.\n\nDespite this, he has been pursuing an exit as he is keen to be an undisputed starter after playing second fiddle to Erling Haaland since joining Man City in 2022.\n\nAtletico Madrid have agreed to pay an initial fee of around Â£64m to sign Alvarez and this deal could reach Â£82m with add-ons.\n\nWhile a report has revealed two âreal reasonsâ why Alvarez has decided to âquitâ Man City, Fabrizio Romano has provided details on how they plan to replace him.\n\nREAD: Survival, quadruples, completing trophy sets â a 24/25 season target for every Premier League club\n\nHe said: âMan City will now look at options to replace Alvarez, for sure. It could be a striker, but I would not be surprised if they end up considering also wingers and maybe playing with a false nine when Erling Haaland will not be available.\n\nâTalks are taking place internally to decide on the next move, so we will have to wait and see the outcome of those discussions.â\n\nAccording to a report in Spain, Man City boss Pep Guardiola has picked out Crystal Palace star Eberechi Eze as his âchosen oneâ to âreplaceâ Alvarez this summer.\n\nThis comes after the 26-year-old England international shone for Crystal Palace last season, grabbing 15 goal involvements in his 27 Premier League appearances.\n\nThe report claims Man City have âdecided to act swiftlyâ to replace Alvarez and Eze has been made their âtop candidate at the request of Guardiolaâ.\n\nMORE MAN CITY COVERAGE ON F365â¦\n\nð Chelsea and Man Utd in bottom three: Ranking the Premier League pre-season moods\n\nð Four England snubs included: Premier League stars ready for huge 24/25 after full pre-season\n\nð The 11 most profitable transfers in history as Chelsea pair make the cut\n\nThe report explains.\n\nâHis contract with Crystal Palace, extended until 2027, and his valuation of around 80 million euros have not gone unnoticed by other important clubs like Tottenham, Liverpool, and Arsenal, who have also shown interest in the midfielder.\n\nâManchester City, accustomed to discreetly advancing in their market operations, could be close to securing a strategic reinforcement that would not only compensate for Ãlvarezâs departure but also bring a new dimension to their attack.â\n\nAnother report from The Telegraph claims Wolves winger Pedro Neto is another player on Man Cityâs radar.\n\nâIt remains to be seen if Alvarezâs departure now forces the club into the market for reinforcements. The Wolves forward Pedro Neto is one of the players to have interested City.\n\nâThey explored a deal for Bruno Guimaraes but were unwilling to meet Newcastleâs Â£100 million valuation. If City opt against bringing someone in, it could open the door for James McAtee, whom Guardiola has said will stay with the club next season.â"
