        "text": "Spain booked their place at Brazil 2014 with a comfortable 2-0 victory over Georgia which consigned France to the play-offs. Goals from Alvaro Negredo and Juan Mata ensured the world and European champions will defend their crown next summer. Les Blues beat Finland 3-0 with Franck Ribéry and Karim Benzema among the scorers, but they are unlikely to be seeded in the play-off draw which takes place in Zurich on Monday.\n\nRussia qualified from Group F by the narrowest of margins after conceding a last-minute equaliser against Azerbaijan. Fabio Capello's men began the day three points clear of second-placed Portugal and needing a draw in Baku to ensure they would be on the plane to Brazil, but Vagif Javadov's last-minute strike set nerves fluttering. The visitors held on to leave Portugal, who were comfortable 3-0 winners over Luxembourg, in the play-offs. The match between Israel and Northern Ireland ended 1-1 in Tel Aviv, Steven Davis equalising for the visitors.\n\nFlares and fireworks lit up the skies above Sarajevo as Bosnia-Herzegovina won 1-0 in Lithuania to reach the World Cup for the first time. Vedad Ibisevic scored the only goal after 68 minutes to ensure they topped Group G ahead of Greece, who won 2-0 at home to Liechtenstein.\n\nIceland will have another shot at becoming the smallest nation to qualify for a World Cup after taking second place in Group E with a 1-1 draw in Norway. The visitors led through Kolbeinn Sigthorsson's 13th-minute strike and although Daniel Braaten equalised on the half-hour, the point saw Iceland to reach the playoffs ahead of Slovenia, who lost 1-0 in Switzerland but had already won the group.\n\nIn Group D, Romania secured a play-off place with a 2-0 victory over Estonia. The Romanians finished ahead of Hungary, who were also 2-0 winners over Andorra. Turkey's hopes of finishing runners-up ended with a 2-0 loss at home to Holland, for whom Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder scored.\n\nThe night's unluckiest side were Denmark, who secured second place in Group B with a 6-0 victory over Malta in Copenhagen but missed out on a play-off berth as they finished with the weakest record of the nine runners-up. Two penalties from Daniel Agger were not enough to keep alive their chances of qualification. Italy, who drew 2-2 at home to Armenia on Tuesday night, topped the group.\n\nAndré Schürrle struck a hat-trick as Sweden and Germany served up another eight-goal thriller in Group C, following the 4-4 draw in Berlin a year ago. Sweden, already assured of a play-off place, went 2-0 up but Schürrle's treble and goals from Mesut Özil, who later limped off, and Mario Götze ensured Joachim Löw's table-toppers rounded off their campaign in style with a 5-3 win.\n\nIn the same group the Republic of Ireland overturned an early deficit to beat Kazakhstan 3-1 in Dublin, leaving John to O'Shea to hail his side's \"fantastic\" response. An own goal, a Robbie Keane penalty and O'Shea's first international strike in 10 years gave Ireland a welcome victory under interim manager Noel King. \"Noel said to us beforehand that whatever happens keep your heads up and play properly,\" said O'Shea. \"We got the rewards from it and we could have scored even more.\"\n\nAaron Ramsey struck a late equaliser for Wales to stun Group A winners Belgium in Brussels and boost Chris Coleman's hopes of keeping his job. Wales looked to be heading to defeat when Kevin De Bruyne seized on an error from the debutant James Wilson to fire Belgium ahead. But Ramsey was picked out by Craig Bellamy, on his 78th and final Wales appearance, and slid the ball under Thibaut Courtois to earn the visitors a hard-earned point.\n\nThe impressive draw followed Wales's win over Macedonia on Friday but Coleman remains unconvinced he will still be in a job next month. \"Two great results does not mean I expect to be told I am the man to take us forward,\" he said. \"Ultimately, it's about results. My contract ends in November and we have a friendly against Finland next month and we will talk about it then. It's not something you give up lightly, being manager of your country.\"\n\nEuropean play-offs\n\nThe eight best runners-up will be drawn into four two-leg play-offs on 15 and 19 November, the winners qualifying for the World Cup finals. The teams will be seeded according to their Fifa world rankings:"
