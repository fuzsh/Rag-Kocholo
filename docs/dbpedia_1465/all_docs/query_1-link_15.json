        "text": "Until this month, Stjarnan F.C. was known mostly as a middling Icelandic soccer team with a talent for elaborate goal celebrations.\n\nIn the past few years, the on-field exploits of the team, made up mostly of amateur players, traveled beyond its nation of just over 300,000 people only after the team scored. That was when the show began: As many as seven players would gather to form a human bicycle, a human toilet or, in one performance that drew some criticism, a re-enactment of a shooting spree. By far the most popular was a routine in which six players struggled to catch a fish, mimicked by one player flopping around on the turf.\n\n“One of our teammates was fishing with his father before the game and figured out that we could do it,” said Johann Laxdal, a 24-year-old defender who played the role of the fish. “My last name in Icelandic means ‘salmon,’ ” he added, “so it was perfect, really.”\n\nThis week, Laxdal and his Stjarnan teammates are hunting their biggest catch yet: After a surprising run in the early qualification rounds of UEFA’s Europa League, they will host the Italian team Inter Milan on Wednesday.\n\nInter Milan is one of the most popular teams in the world, having won 18 Italian league titles and three Champions League crowns, most recently in 2010. Stjarnan, meanwhile, has never won its domestic league. The closest it has come to winning a trophy was losing back-to-back Icelandic Cup finals in 2012 and 2013.\n\nStjarnan qualified for the Europa League after finishing third in Iceland’s top league last season. Its journey began in early July, while the World Cup was still going strong.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
