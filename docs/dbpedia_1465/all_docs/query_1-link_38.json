        "text": "The Dance World Cup 2024 World Finals, held from June 27th to July 6th at the Prague Congress Centre, was our biggest and most remarkable event yet, showcasing the talents of 9,500 dancers from 54 countries, with 20,000 supporters in attendance.\n\nRunning daily from 08:30 am to 10:00 pm across three stages simultaneously, the competition showcased a diverse range of dance genres, judged by 37 world-renowned experts. It also featured over 120 masterclasses conducted by these esteemed teachers and other industry legends. The event was proudly supported by 160 volunteers, helpers, and technical staff.\n\nThe DWC 2024 Finals kicked off with the customarily olympic-style opening ceremony on June 28th, where 20,000 worldwide participants and their supporters paraded through Prague's Old Town to Wenceslas Square.\n\nSpectacular special performances during the event included shows by the Japanese professional company Kotan and Awaji World Ballet, as well as the Spanish national school dance show Enraizao.\n\nGala events on July 2nd and July 6th highlighted winning performances, with special appearances by Czech Prima ballerina Daria Klimentova and American celebrity Abby Lee Miller from the hit tv series \"Dance Moms.\"\n\nNotably, the newly formed DWC Junior dance company left audiences speechless with their debut of two spectacular pieces, choreographed by the renowned Richard Wherlock and supported by professional teachers from Basle Ballet Switzerland and Mr. Niall McMahon from Ireland.\n\nThe Dance World Cup 2024 did not disappoint and lived up to its reputation as the largest dance competition for children and young adults in the world, and once again succeeded in fostering international friendships and celebrating the universal language of dance, all set against the stunning backdrop of Prague. True to its motto, it truly was \"Friendship through the language of dance!\"\n\nDance World Cup World was absolutely delighted to be welcomed back once more to Braga, Portugal, from 30 June – 08 July 2023.\n\nThis year’s World Finals event gathered over 7500 dancers from over 50 countries, an amazing line-up of esteemed judges, choreographers, and enthusiasts from all corners of the globe to celebrate the beauty and diversity of the dance world.\n\nBraga became a hub of dance excellence with 4800 routines performed on 3 stages in 2 spectacular venues. The competitors demonstrated incredible skill and dedication, while Masterclasses and lectures by renowned choreographers provided valuable learning opportunities.\n\nThe event featured one of DWC’s largest opening flag parades to date, exciting DJ parties, and Hip-Hop battles. The beautiful Theatro Circo hosted the traditional Grand finals and Gala performances, concluding the event on a high note.\n\nDance World Cup was ecstatic to organise a live event to full capacity again for the 2022 finals in the breath-taking and friendly seaside town, San Sebastián in Spain.\n\nThe Kursaal Congress Centre was supreme in hosting over 10,000 passionate dancers, teachers and audience members with their 2 auditoriums and multipurpose rooms equipped with state-of-the-art technology. The Victoria Eugenia Theatre where the Galas were held left everyone in awe with its beauty and spectacular grandeur.\n\n40 countries brought their best talent and the 9 days of being entertained by spectacular performances with the added bonus of making new friends and having fun on the gorgeous adjacent beach surroundings was truly an unforgettable experience.\n\nWith the Dance World Cup showing growth each year, 2018 was a momentous year for us and all the dancers that participated in the 2018 World Finals that took place in Sitges, Spain.\n\nWe only needed 10 out of the 300 days of sun in a year in Sitges, and Spain delivered perfect weather along with perfect scenery along its 17 beaches. The opening ceremony was held along the beach with 5850 dancers representing over 46 countries. What a sight to behold and experience, so many passionate dancers from across the globe in one place.\n\nSitges of the 21st century is based on creativity, talent and innovation, but without ever losing its roots. Sitges is still a town that attracts and seduces, and we can’t wait to be back to experience more of the cultural wealth and experiences that it has to offer.\n\nIn 2016, Dance World Cup was hosted in Jersey, Channel Islands. With over 3000 dancers participating in the competition this was an incredible event for Dance and the Island.\n\nSince it was last held in the Island six years ago, the competition has grown significantly, with 30 countries, including Japan, Malaysia, South Africa and Mexico, compared to just 18 in 2009.\n\nJersey had never witnessed so many artistic performances from young dancers and it was truly memorable for all those involved. All of the participants showed an incredibly high standard of dance and each participant excelled. All in all what a miraculous experience it has been\n\nOn Saturday the 27th of June 2015, Bucharest was welcomed by the breath-taking large group of passionate and spirited dancers; as the Opening Ceremony for the Dance World Cup finals commenced.\n\nIn 2015 the experience of Dance World Cup was taken to a whole new level with the introduction of Club Wow, the media home of the Dance World Cup and introduced a new kind of live streaming that had never been experienced before. 2015 saw the largest group of online audience across the world stream in and watch the Dance World Cup and support their nations as they compete for their titles.\n\nStandards were higher than ever before and the talent didn’t not disappoint. A great many new friends were made and the spirit of dance only grew in abundance."
