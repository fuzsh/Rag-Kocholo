Watch our live stream as Iceland strive to become the smallest nation in World Cup history as they host Croatia in Reykjavik.

Home manager Lars Lagerback, who has been to three World Cups previously with Sweden (twice) and Nigeria, will send his side out looking to gain a first-leg lead before next week's return in Zagreb.

Croatia's qualifying campaign stuttered towards the end. They won five of their opening six fixtures, but are without a competitive victory since a 2-1 win over Wales in March.

That poor form led to the dismissal of head coach Igor Stimac so former Croatia captain Niko Kovac will begin his interim tenure in charge in Iceland.
