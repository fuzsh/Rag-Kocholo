The Marine observation squadrons were formed during the latter stages of World War II with the primary mission of forward air control of strike aircraft for close air support and air interdiction. They saw extensive service during the Vietnam War flying the OV-10 Bronco. The Marine Corps began decommissioning the VMO squadrons following their participation in Operation Desert Storm as propeller driven aircraft were seen as too dangerous to fly on the modern battlefield. Their mission has been assumed by the VMFA(AW) squadrons.
