        "text": "Joe Foss was born in April 1915 on a farm outside of Sioux Falls, South Dakota. From an early age, Foss developed a love for flying. In 1927, he saw legendary aviator Charles Lindbergh and his renowned aircraft “the Spirit of St. Louis.” Foss flew for the first time in 1931, when his father paid $1.50 for Foss to fly with Clyde Ice. Later, he watched a Marine Corps aerial team at a fair. This inspired him to become a Marine pilot.\n\nIn 1933, Foss’ father passed away in an accident. Foss dropped out of school and worked to support his family. He remained focused on eventually becoming a pilot and managed to save $65 for flying lessons. When his younger brother was old enough to take care of their farm, Foss went back to school. He graduated from Washington High School, spent a year at Sioux Falls College and then another year at Augustana College. Then, he attended the University of South Dakota (USD), where he joined the South Dakota National Guard and served as a private. He continued taking pilot lessons and eventually earned his license. In 1940, he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in business administration from USD.\n\nAfter graduating, Foss enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve and joined the Naval Aviator Cadet Program. In August 1940, he went to Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida for training. In February 1941, Foss completed the program and earned his Marine wings. He commissioned as a second lieutenant and served as a flight instructor. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Foss went to aerial photographer school in Miami, Florida. Foss was disappointed; he wanted to be a fighter pilot, but he was considered too old for this role at the age of 26. He served with Marine Observation Squadron 1 (VMO-1) at Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego, California. Foss, however, did not relinquish his dream.\n\nIn California, Foss tried to convince his superiors that he could be a fighter pilot. He practiced flying an F4F Wildcat. In six weeks, he spent 156 hours flying this aircraft, gaining valuable experience. In August 1942, Foss promoted to captain and transferred to Marine Fighter Squadron 121 (VMF-121) as the unit’s executive officer. He then went to Guadalcanal aboard USS Copahee.\n\nOn Oct. 9, Foss and VMF-121 landed at Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. For the next several months, the squadron dominated the skies above Guadalcanal. Foss saw combat for the first time on Oct. 13. He quickly earned the status of an “ace”, downing five Japanese aircraft within the first week of combat. VMF-121 earned the nickname “Foss’ Flying Circus.” Foss shot down 14 Japanese aircraft in a span of only 13 days. After downing 19 aircraft, Foss received a Distinguished Flying Cross medal.\n\nFoss not only faced danger on the battlefield; he also survived several crashes. After 23 victories, he left the battlefield for six weeks with malaria. When he returned, Foss scored three additional victories for a total of 26. Foss tied Eddie Rickenbacker’s World War I record, making him the Marine Corps’ “ace of aces.”\n\nIn March 1943, Foss returned to the U.S. and received a Medal of Honor from President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In February 1944, Foss took command of Marine Fighter Squadron 115 (VMF-115), fighting again in the Pacific. By the end of the war, Foss held the rank of major.\n\nWhen Foss returned home, he became active in his home state of South Dakota. He played a key role in the organization of the South Dakota Air National Guard and was elected as a member of the South Dakota House of Representatives. He was later activated for service during the Korean War in the Air Force, where he trained pilots and eventually reached the rank of brigadier general.\n\nFoss was elected for two terms as governor of South Dakota. Later, he became the first commissioner of the American Football League and hosted several television shows, including “The American Sportsman.” In January 2003, Foss passed away at 87 years old.\n\nWe honor his service.\n\nAmerica250\n\nVA is highlighting 250 Veterans leading up to July 4, 2026, which marks 250 years of independence.
