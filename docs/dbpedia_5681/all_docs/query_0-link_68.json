        "text": "Role: Fighter/Attack.\n\nAlthough commissioned at Quantico, Virginia, on August 1, 1941, as the Marine Corps' first aircraft group, elements of the organization that would eventually support its mission actually existed as early as 1 December 1921. Together, these ancestral units were collectively designated as Aircraft Squadron, East Coast Expeditionary Force.\n\nSubsequent to the beginning of World War II, Marine Aircraft Group-11 (MAG-11) was composed of six tactical squadrons which were based at MCAS Quantico, Virginia and MCAS Parris Island, South Carolina. During the summer and fall of 1941 the Group engaged in maeuvers with the 1st Marine Division in the vicinity of Onslow Beach, North Carolina. They departed for the West Coast of the United States in December 1941. Upon arrival, MAG-11 became the Air-Defense Group for the San Diego, California area. During this interim pre-deployment period, MAG-11 served as the nucleus of four new air groups destined for combat action in the Pacific. MAG-11 embarked for the South Pacific on October 15, 1942 on the SS Lurline (Mumu). They left with no planes and were expected to fly what they found in the Pacific. Squadrons from MAG-11, such as VMSB-132 and VMF-112 landed on Guadalcanal in early November and were among the first to relive the tired original aviators of the Cactus Air Force. Arriving at Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides Islands, the group launched offensive actions against enemy strongholds, air power, and shipping in the Solomon Islands. During World War II, MAG-11 participated in combat action in the Solomon Islands, New Britain, Palau, Central Pacific Areas, and the Philippines. At the close of World War II, MAG-11 was based on the island of Peleliu, Palaus Group, where it remained until January 1946.\n\nTemporarily assigned to the San Diego area upon its return to the United States, MAG 11 joined the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing (2nd MAW) at MCAS Cherry Point, North Carolina in March 1946 and remained organic to that wing until August 1953, when it relocated from MCALF Edenton, North Carolina to NAF Atsugi, Japan. In Japan, elements of MAG 11 actively participated in air operations against North Korean and Chinese Communist forces.\n\nFrom August 1958 until January 1959, MAG-11 deployed to Taiwan in support of the Nationalist Chinese air defenses, returning again in 1961 and 1963 in support of maneuvers in that area.\n\nIn April 1965, MAG 11 deployed to Da Nang, Vietnam in support of counter-insurgency operations. Within 69 hours, after its departure from Japan, group element launched the first attack against communist (Viet Cong) forces.\n\nMAG-11 (April 1965 - February 1971) Components VMF(AW)-232, VMF(AW)-235, VMF(AW)-312, VMFA-115, VMFA-122, VMFA-314, VMFA-323, VMFA-334, VMFA-513, VMFA-531, VMFA-542, VMA(AW)-225, VMA(AW)-242, VMA-311, VMO-2, VMJ-1 & HQ & Maintenance 11\n\nThe Group's mission in combat was carried out primarily by the F-8 Crusader, the F-4 Phantom II, the A-6 Intruder, and the A-4 Skyhawk. Headquarters and Maintenance Squadron 11 (the Marine Corps' oldest squadron) and Marine Air Base Squadron 11 supported MAG 11 and attached aircraft squadrons during this period. During this phase of MAG 11's combat history, the following types of missions were assigned and carried out: close air and direct support; air defense intercept; visual, photographic and electronic reconnaissance; electronic countermeasures; airborne tactical air control; illumination and combat logistical support for air/ground elements of the allied forces.\n\nIn May 1971, MAG 11 relocated from Vietnam, reporting to the commanding general, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at MCAS El Toro, Santa Ana, Calif. on 10 June 1971. During November 1979, VMFA-323 and VMFA-531 deployed aboard the USS Coral Sea (CV-43). This was the first time in Naval Aviation History that the Marine Corps provided all of the fighter support for a Navy carrier and the first time since World War II that two Marine Fighter squadrons were deployed aboard a Pacific Fleet Carrier.\n\nIn July 1982, MAG 11's fighter squadrons began transitioning from the F-4 Phantom II to the Marine Corps' newest tactical jet, the F/A-18 Hornet. On 24 November 1982, the F-4N officially retired form active duty Marine service when VMFA-531 transferred its last Phantom to the Naval Weapons Center. VMFA-314 took delivery of the first fleet F/A-18A on 15 December 1982.\n\nIn October 1985, two MAG-11 F/A-18 squadrons, VMFA-314 and VMFA-323, deployed to the Mediterranean aboard the USS Coral Sea and participated in the April 15, 1986, air strikes against Libya.\n\nIn early August 1990, MAG-11 began providing squadrons to MAG-70 for the Air Combat Element (ACE) of 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade (7th MEB) for deployment to the Middle East as part of Operation Desert Shield. With the establishment of I MEF and 3rd MAW in theater on 3 September 1990, MAG-11 was transferred from MCAS El Toro to Bahrain and assumed operational control of all USMC F/A-18, A-6E, EA-6B, and C-130 aircraft in Southwest Asia. Prior to commencement of hostilities, MAG-11 grew to become the largest Marine Fixed Wing Air Group in history with squadrons from all four Marine Aircraft Wings. The order to execute Desert Storm was received and extensive combat operations commenced. Initial strikes were flown deep into Iraq with follow on operations designed to prepare the battlefield for the attack by Marine Ground Forces. When the ground war began, MAG-11 flew over 7,500 combat sorties and 16,400 hours, without loss of life or aircraft. The 13 squadrons expended over 17 million pounds of ordnance during combat operations.\n\nDuring the period of January 1 through 31 March 2003, Marine Aircraft Group 11 (MAG-11) prepared, deployed, and executed combat operations in support of Operation Southern Watch (OSW) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). With the establishment of I MEF and 3rd MAW in theater MAG-11 was transferred from MCAS Miramar to Ahmed Al Jaber Air Base, Kuwait and assumed control of all USMC F/A-18, and C-130 aircraft in Southwest Asia.\n\nAfter the order to execute Operation Iraqi Freedom was received, MAG-11 aircraft flew extensive combat operations 24 hours a day. MAG-11 aviators flew 120-130 sorties per day, dropped over 4.2 million pounds of ordnance on targets inside Iraq in support of Marine, Army, and British ground forces and used 250,000 to 300,000 gallons of fuel per day. MAG-11 flew over 4,000 combat sorties and 10,000 flight hours, without loss of life or aircraft. The eight squadrons expended close to four million pounds of ordnance during combat operations.\n\nAir Bases:\n\nBase\n\nDuration\n\nMCAS Quantico/Triangle/VA\n\n1941 - 11.1941\n\nMCAS San Diego/CA\n\n11.1941 - 10.1942\n\nCentral Pacific Aerea\n\n10.1942 - 1945\n\nPeleliu, Palaus Group\n\n1945 - 1946\n\nMCAS Cherry Point/NC 1946 - 1953 NAF Atsugi,/Japan 1958 - 1958 Taiwan 1958 - 1959 NAF Atsugi,/Japan 1959 - 1961 Taiwan 1961 - 1963 NAF Atsugi,/Japan 1963 - 1965 Da Nang/Vietnam 1965 - 1971 MCAS El Toro/Santa Ana/CA 1971 - 1999 MCAS Miramar/San Diego/CA 1999 - Present\n\nUnit Insignia:\n\nMarine Aircraft Group 11\n\nReferences:"
