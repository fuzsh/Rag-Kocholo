The squadron is based at Marine Corps Base Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 24 (MAG-24) and the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing (1st MAW).[1]\n\nMission[]\n\nSupport the Marine Air-Ground Task Force commander by providing offensive air support, utility support, armed escort and airborne supporting arms coordination, day or night under all weather conditions during expeditionary, joint or combined operations.\n\nHistory[]\n\nOrigins during WWII[]\n\nHMLA-367 has a long and distinguished record in the United States Marine Corps. Its historical lineage can be traced back to December 1, 1943 when it was activated at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia as Marine Observation Squadron 351 (VMO-351) which was assigned to the Artillery Spotting Division. In January 1944, the squadron was re-designated as and deployed to Marine Aircraft Group 11 on the island of Espiritu Santo whereupon it took part in the campaigns on Peleliu and Okinawa. The squadron participated in the occupation of North China from October 1945 through June 1947 and was relocated in 1949 to MCAS Cherry Point, North Carolina and assigned to the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing. The Squadron, having served honorably throughout the Pacific Theater, was deactivated on August 20, 1949.\n\nVietnam War[]\n\nAs the United States increased its presence in the Republic of Vietnam, the Marine Corps reactivated VMO-3 at Marine Corps Air Station Camp Pendleton on August 1, 1966 and assigned it to Marine Wing Support Group 37. The squadron arrived in Vietnam in December 1966 and were now flying the UH-1E. VMO-3 became fully operational at Huế/Phu Bai on 16 January 1967. In 1966 and for the first half of 1967, the squadron's radio call sign was \"Oakgate,\" which sometimes got confused for the term OK. Major Bill Murphy is credited with first using the call \"Scarface\" while on TAD, and lobbied to have the substantially more macho Scarface designation adopted as VMO-3's signature when all Marine squadrons in-country changed call signs during the summer of 1967. On November 14, 1967) Major General Bruno Hochmuth, then commanding general of the 3rd Marine Division was killed when a UH-1E Huey from VMO-3 exploded and crashed 5 miles northwest of Huế. Four others also died in this crash.\n\nThe squadron assumed a new identity in March 1968 when VMO-3 was re-designated HML-367 and immediately began operations in direct support of ground combat units. Based at Hue and Phu Bai, the squadron flew the Bell UH1E Huey throughout I Corps in support of the 1st and 3rd Marine Divisions, the United States Army, and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. In addition to the countless other missions flown they most notably supported Operations Medina, Fortress Ridge, Prairie Fire, Project Delta, Sparrow Hawk, Dewey Canyon, Apache Snow, Swift Saber and Lam Son 719.\n\nIn addition to participating in the above operations, the Scarface crews also flew near daily missions in support of MACV-SOG on what were then top secret reconnaissance missions deep into Laos.\n\nSquadron assets quickly grew from eighteen aircraft (UH-1E) to twenty five. In 1969, HML-367 exceeded 2000 flight hours for the month of June. October 1969 saw the departure of Marine Air Group 36 from the Republic of Vietnam. Due to the continued necessity for armed helicopter support, HML-367 remained in Vietnam and was assigned to Marine Aircraft Group 16 (Forward) at Phu Bai. In December 1969, HML-367 began flying the AH-1G Cobra, thus becoming the first operational \"Cobra\" Squadron in the Marine Corps. Soon after, all the squadron's Hueys were transferred to another squadron (HML-167) and replaced with the Bell AH-1G Cobra. On April 24, 1970, in another show of maintenance magic, the Squadron had all of their twenty five aircraft in an \"Up\" status. This was the first time a Helicopter Squadron had attained 100% aircraft availability in Vietnam. To celebrate the event, a 25-plane \"fly-over\" of Marble Mountain was conducted with Plane Captains called on to fill the front seats of all 25 Cobras. Total flight time for Fiscal Year 1970 was 22,378 hours. HML-367 completed its combat tour in Vietnam in June 1971, and relocated to MCAS Futenma, Okinawa, rejoining MAG-36. Once established, the Squadron began peacetime operations using the UH-1E.\n\n1970s[]\n\nIn April 1975, HML-367(REIN), with nine UH-1E's and twelve CH-46's deployed aboard the USS Midway, the USS Hancock, and to NAS Cubi Point in support of Operations Eagle Pull, Talon Vise and Frequent Wind. The Squadron participated in the evacuation of Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees from the mainland during both April and May. In June 1975, HML-367 returned to Okinawa and resumed normal operations. In 1976, the squadron took receipt of the new UH-1N and, in 1977, AH-1J's Cobra gunships. After more than eight years on the island of Okinawa, HML-367 was reassigned to Marine Aircraft Group 39 (MAG-39), MAW, at Camp Pendleton.\n\n1980s and 1990s[]\n\nIn November 1979, after more than eight years on Okinawa, HML-367 was reassigned to Marine Aircraft Group 39 at MCB Camp Pendleton. The majority of squadron personnel stayed behind, having been transferred to other units of the 1st Marine Air Wing. New personnel were selected from the parent command, and by August 1981, unit strength was up to 165 men and 16 aircraft. Another milestone was the conversion of the squadron to its present status as a composite squadron.\n\nThe squadron typically spent six of each eighteen months in Okinawa rotating with two other squadrons. While at Camp Pendleton, they supported major exercises and deployed for training frequently to Twenty-nine Palms, Marine Corps Air Station Yuma and Nellis Air Force Base. While in Okinawa, the squadron visited such places as Cubi Point in the Philippines, Naval Air Facility Atsugi, Japan, and Camp Butler, Korea, for training and to support major exercises. HMLA-367 also frequently supported higher headquarters by transporting VIP's, and assists both the military and civilian communities with its med-evac capability.\n\nGlobal War on Terror[]\n\nWith the ongoing War on Terrorism, the squadron has shared seven-month rotations with two other squadrons (HMLA-169 and HMLA-369) to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and in 2009 deployed to Camp Bastion in Afghanistan to support operations in Helmand Province. The seven-month deployment was the first combat deployment of the UH-1Y.\n\nUnit awards[]\n\nA unit citation or commendation is an award bestowed upon an organization for the action cited.
