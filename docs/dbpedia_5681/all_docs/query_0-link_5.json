The squadron fought in World War II but was quickly deactivated after the war on 20 March 1946.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMarine Observation Squadron 1 (VMO-1) was commissioned on 1 July 1937 at Marine Corps Base Quantico.[1] They were redesignated Marine Observation Squadron 151 (VMO-151) on 1 July 1941. The squadron left for San Diego, California in December 1941 with the rest of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, but returned to MCB Quantico in January 1942. From January to April, they trained at Naval Station Norfolk until departing for Tafuna Airfield in American Samoa on 9 April 1942. They arrived a month later and remained for the next 13 months. On 15 September 1942, the squadron was re-designated again, this time as Marine Scout Bombing Squadron 151 (VMSB-151).[2]\n\nOn 10 June 1943, the squadron moved to Uvea Island in the Wallis Group. The squadron remained there until 29 February 1944 when they arrived at Engebi.[2] From 9–12 March, the squadron covered Marine landings on Wotho Atoll, Ujae Atoll and Lae Atoll. During this time, they also made bombing runs against by-passed Japanese bases in the Marshall Islands until 31 May 1945. On 9 June 1945, the squadron returned to the United States.\n\nUpon return to Marine Corps Air Station Mojave, they were assigned to Marine Air Support Group 51 and were redesignated Marine Torpedo Bombing Squadron 151 (VMTB-151).[3] on 30 June 1945. The squadron was deactivated at Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara, California on 20 March 1946.[4]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited States Marine Corps Aviation\n\nList of active United States Marine Corps aircraft squadrons\n\nList of decommissioned United States Marine Corps aircraft squadrons\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nMillstein, Jeff (1995).
