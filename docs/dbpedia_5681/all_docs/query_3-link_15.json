        "text": "Identifying and recovering the aircraft\n\nBy Air Vice Marshal Graham Neil AO, DFC, DFC (US) Rtd\n\nProlonged and extensive efforts were made by many individuals over a number of years to obtain a USAF aircraft flown by RAAF Forward Air Controllers in Vietnam for display at the Australian War Memorial.The chain of events started with extensive research conducted by a volunteer at the AWM, Alan Storr (ex RAAF) who was tasked in March 1998 by John White, the Senior Curator Military Technology at the AWM, with contacting all RAAF FAC’s who had served in Vietnam, seeking log book details of all missions flown. The responses showed that in all, twenty RAAF FAC’s had flown 77 different OV-10’s. The tail numbers were listed in priority order but the first three had suffered combat losses. The fourth choice was 67-14639, which had been flown for a total 129 missions by eight RAAF FAC’s. Former FAC Ken Semmler shared the information with the OV-10 Bronco Association (OBA) at Fort Worth Texas, which then commenced an exhaustive world-wide search for each identified aircraft. The tail numbers were traced by researching documentation associated with the provision of spare parts to the various air forces flying OV-10’s.\n\nIn June 2001, 639 was detected as being in storage in the Philippines and in November that year contact was made through the OBA with Captain Silvestre Glinoga (“Big Mac”) who was a member of the Philippines chapter of the OBA. That discovery, complete with photographs provided by Big Mac, was to assist greatly in fostering support in Australia. The aircraft was indeed in storage at Sangley Point, Cavite City, within a few hundred metres of a large wharf previously used by the US Navy.\n\nThe first hurdle was gaining ownership of an American aircraft that had been provided to the Philippines Air Force (PAF) under their Foreign Military Finance (FMF) scheme, where the United States provided the finance for the Philippines to purchase the aircraft subject to US restrictions on disposal. Support was provided by numerous officers within the Australian Defence Department, as well as by serving RAAF officers and former FAC Doug Riding, who was a member of the AWM Council. Lobbying began in earnest with Doug Riding and I signing a letter to the AWM seeking their interest and support as well as gaining permission from the Defence Department to deal directly with successive Defence Attaches in Manila, initially Group Captain Greg Sutton, and subsequently Colonel Chris Burns. The Defence Attaches succeeded in arranging the transfer of 639 from the PAF via the Joint United States Military Advisory Group (JUSMAG) to the US State Department and to the RAAF FAC Association, subject to it being held by the Australian Government.\n\nOn 5 September 2003 the US Embassy in Canberra provided a diplomatic note regarding an end-user agreement on weaponry and use of 639. On 13 April 2004 Lt Col Dwight Kenyon, of the Joint US Military Advisory Command, confirmed the donation of the aircraft '…to the Forward Air Controller Association of Australia in cooperation with the Australian War Memorial.' That provided, we concentrated on transportation of 639 and its eventual home in Australia. Approaches were made to the RAAF and RAN and the AWM with the most encouraging transport support being from the RAN. The navy tasked HMAS Westralia to pick up 639 in October 2004 but the absence of adequate quarantine and stevedoring requirements at Sangley Point necessitated road or barge transportation to the Westralia in Manila. As it turned out that shore to ship move was never to be carried out because the Philippines Finance Department vetoed the transfer over a dispute over ownership of 639 at the last minute. But the team had learnt all the requirements for our next attempt.\n\nThe RAN forecast some difficulty in tasking another ship for a while so efforts were made to lobby CDF, the USN and the RNZN all to no avail despite their cooperative attitude. Back in the Philippines the new Defence Attache Manila Colonel Chris Burns completed the necessary ownership arrangements, following which the aircraft was formally handed over to Air Marshal Angus Houston at a formal parade on 21 Feb 2005 during his official visit to the Philippines.\n\nIn June 2006 HMAS Tobruk was tasked to pick up 639 but that task had to be cancelled because of Australia’s support to the Solomon Islands after a severe cyclone there. Our navy made another attempt to assist with joint visits by HMAS Darwin and HMAS Newcastle (each carrying one container) but that task was thwarted by typhoon Milyeno. The Philippine Defence Force was also fully tied up in post-typhoon tasking. Also, the ships had been provided only eight days’ notice whereas two weeks were needed for the disassembling and preparation of the aircraft.\n\nWe took a long hard look at the financial realities of civil shipping along with stevedoring and road transport costs and they were prohibitive for us. The AWM was kept apprised of all efforts and they too had examined what it would cost to have the aircraft prepared and transported to Manila; they budgeted $50,000 for the task. Additionally, an AWM technician, Lee Davies, was attached to Sangley Point to supervise the disassembly of the aircraft and its preparation to meet Australian quarantine requirements. The RAN came to the party once again (fourth attempt) and HMAS Tobruk successfully carried 639 to Sydney in March 2007 and the AWM transported her to their Mitchell Annex in Canberra by road transport.\n\nThe immediate following years provided more frustrations, although the AWM was about as keen as we were to start refurbishment they were severely hampered by the Government’s austerity program which prevented any recruitment by the AWM. During that lull our members were canvassed to provide additional log book and sortie details to Darrel Whitcomb (Nail 25) who carefully drafted a nine- page booklet covering the history of 639 in Vietnam, Thailand, Germany, USA, South Korea and the Philippines. In April 2008 the FAC Association held a very successful reunion, organised by Mac Cottrell, which included the dedication of a bronze plaque commemorating FAC service in Vietnam and the presentation of Darrell Whitcomb’s historical account to the AWM. The AWM completed a survey on the aircraft to assess its spares requirements. The AWM’s John White visited the USA for official museum-to-museum matters in January 2011 and managed to include a side trip to visit Jim Hodgson at the OBA. The search for current spare part providers continued with very knowledgeable assistance from Jim Hodgson, Chuck Burin and other OBA members and this was managed by Ken Semmler who had picked up many useful contacts during his visits to the USA.\n\nIn July 2013 Doug Riding and I had a very productive meeting with Dr Brendan Nelson, the Director of the AWM, with Tim Sullivan the Assistant Director, Branch Head National Collection and Rebecca Britt, Head Military Heraldry and Technology. During this period Ken Semmler spent a lot of time pursuing contacts with the DA Jakarta and the TNI-AU in our quest for spares.\n\nIn 2016 Dick Smith generously provided $50,000 to the AWM for aircraft conservation, which the Memorial allocated to the 639 refurbishment project. In May 2017 Laura Kennedy and Kim Wood visited likely sources of information regarding refurbishment with Tony De Bruyn who runs the Bronco demonstration team in Belgium and the OBA, CALFIRE and Marsh Aviation in the USA. All of these contacts had been refined over the years between the OBA and Ken Semmler.\n\nWhy is the aircraft worth saving?\n\nThe men who originally recognised the Bronco and struggled to get it brought back to Australia saw the aircraft as an item of great personal importance, holding exciting and poignant memories for them. But they also recognised Bronco 67-14639 as a significant part of the Australia’s aviation and military heritage. Although the aircraft never wore Australian livery and was never part of the country’s air force, a large number of Australians flew this type of aircraft in combat. At least seven Australians are known to have flown this particular aircraft in combat while attached to the USAF, participating in a conflict in which Australia was a major allied partner for nearly 10 years. Bronco 67-14639 serves as a representation of their service, as well as a tangible representation of the Australia–US alliance.\n\nThe aircraft is also of great technological significance: as an aircraft designed in the 1960s expressly for counter insurgency, it represents a milestone in the history of military aviation. The features which were engineered into the aircraft, and which made it such a success, were necessary for its operation in this type of asymmetrical conflict. The aircraft is also socially significant, being a tangible symbol of the role and importance of FACs during the war. Indeed, the aircraft could not have survived without the support of an active network of Australian veterans who flew Broncos (including this particular aircraft). The FAC network in Australia and the USA provided the Memorial with an invaluable photographic record, insights into the operation and configuration of aircraft, and facilitated international contacts in support of the restoration project. As well as providing an exhibition-ready artefact of air support capabilities in the Vietnam War, saving the Bronco will be of great value to Vietnam veteran groups.\n\nThe Bronco’s origin\n\nDesigned in the early 1960s, the North American Rockwell OV-10A Bronco was unlike anything then in the US inventory, both in appearance and performance. Majors Beckett and Rice, US Marine Corps officers who had served as forward air controllers in Korea, had seen the value of slow and low close air support for ground troops. They drew up an ambitious list of requirements for a light, short take-off and landing support aircraft, and doggedly pushed their concept to government and industry. By 1963, with a growing counterinsurgency operation in south-east Asia, sufficient support had been garnered for the US Defence Department to approach industry for detailed proposals. The aircraft was to be multipurpose, capable of carrying 2400lbs of ordnance, able to operate from small unprepared airstrips, able to maintain position over a target 50 miles from its base for one hour, capable of 350mph, operable from aircraft carriers, able to fly on one engine, and have a short 800-foot take-off run. Eleven companies submitted designs, with North American Aviation in Columbus, Ohio being the successful tenderer.\n\nThe Bronco prototype flew its first test flight as the YOV-10 on 16 July 1965, just nine months after the contract had been approved.\n\nThe Bronco’s characteristics\n\nThe aircraft featured a twin boomed design with its fuselage suspended under a high wing. It carried a two-man crew – pilot in the front position and an observer in a seat directly behind – in a cockpit with a large bulbous canopy, featuring a view of the ground unimpeded by the high wing. This allowed the crew to observe and acquire ground targets more easily than in other aircraft being used, such as the Cessna Bird-Dog and the Skymaster. The downside of the large canopy was that the cockpit heated up quickly, particularly in the tropics.\n\nThe Australian and New Zealander FACs were employed according to the needs of the 504th Tactical Air Support Group. Although they wore the uniform of their countries and their administrative support and pay came from Australian and New Zealand, the USAF was responsible for their health, welfare, morale and duty assignment. The Australians worked with US personnel as air liaison officers, in the direct air support centres, and flew extensively as FACs.\n\nAt least seven of these RAAF pilots flew operations in Bronco 67-14639. A number of RNZAF pilots are also believed to have flown the aircraft. The RAAF pilots confirmed so far are:\n\nSquadron Leader Graham Neil (20 sorties commencing in January 1970), awarded the DFC and US DFC\n\nFlight Lieutenant Ronald Slater (37 sorties commencing October 1969), awarded the DFC and US DFC\n\nFlying Officer Peter Condon (41 sorties between July and December 1969) awarded the US DFC\n\nFlight Lieutenant Kenneth Semmler (18 sorties),Mentioned in Dispatches, awarded the US DFC\n\nFlight Lieutenant Raymond Butler (11 sorties), Mentioned in Dispatches\n\nSquadron Leader David Owens (2 sorties)\n\nWing Commander Colin Ackland (2 sorties), awarded the DFC and US DFC.\n\nThe Memorial’s Bronco during the Cold War\n\nIn late 1974 Bronco 67-14639 was shipped to Wiesbaden Air Base in West Germany. Here it was assigned to the 20th TASS, under the command of the 601st Tactical Air Support Wing, and took part in joint air attack tactics, in which air force FACs and fighters integrated with army attack helicopters to form teams to target enemy tanks and armoured vehicles.\n\nFrom 14 May 1977 to 27 August 1983 the aircraft was based at Sembach USAF Airbase in Germany, occasionally deployed to Spain to direct airstrikes on the bombing ranges near Zaragossa.\n\nIn 1984 it was flown to George Air Force Base in California to serve with the 27th TASS. The following year the aircraft was transferred to South Korea, where it flew under the 19th TASS assigned to the 51st Tactical Fighter Wing at Osan. It was returned to the United States by ship in 1988. The aircraft arrived at San Diego naval base in “plastic pajamas” to protect them from salt corrosion during their trip on the decks of naval vessels. After offloading onto barges, the Navy floated them to Naval Air station North Island, lifted them onto dry ground, and towed them to the airfield. After cursory checks by qualified functional check flight pilots and an engine run, the aircraft were flown to George Air Force Base. Maintenance staff there completed a full phase inspection before release for ferry flights to serve with the 20th TASS at Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina.\n\nAt Shaw AFB, one of the pilots who had flown 639 in South East Asia, Greg Freix, was now Deputy Commander for Operations for the 507th Tactical Air Support Wing. With two flying squadrons among the Wing’s subordinate units, the colonels flew with both squadrons, but each chose to be attached formally to one. Initially, Greg flew with the 20th TASS, so, on the arrival of 639, he managed to assign the aircraft to the 20th TASS/20th Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMU). However, after a year or so the commanders of the 20th and 21st TASS decided to “flip” units, for exposure to both units. Greg therefore donned the 21 TASS patch and flew with that unit until he departed. As a courtesy move, the 20th and 21st AMUs also swapped airplanes, with 639 moving to the 21st AMU. It was with the “blue tail”/Raven markings of the 21st TASS, under the flight controls of Greg Freix, that Bronco 639 flew its final USAF flight in July 1991.\n\nThe Bronco’s last days of operational flying\n\nBy 1991 the United States Government had conceived plans to remove the OV 10A from the US inventory. A small number was sent to the US Marine Corps, and a few more to the Bureau of Land Management for forest fire spotting. The remaining aircraft, from two squadrons, the 20th and 21st TASSs, were sent equally to the Colombian AF and the Philippine AF. In October 1991, Bronco 67-14639 was transferred to the Philippines Air Force under the US Government’s Military Assistance Plan. Here it received a green and grey camouflage finish. By January 1992, the aircraft was at Sangley Point Airbase in Cavite City in the Philippines, where it was attached to the 15th Strike Wing of the Philippine Air Force. Its last flight was on 13 October 1993."
