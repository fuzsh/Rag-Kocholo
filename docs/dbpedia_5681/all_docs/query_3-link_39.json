For additional information, contact the VMI Archives.\n\nWhen was VMI established?\n\nVMI opened on November 11, 1839 on the site of a Virginia State Arsenal. The initial VMI class consisted of 25 cadets who pursued a three year college level course of studies (a four year course was adopted in 1845). Sixteen of the original 25 graduated on July 4th, 1842.

The cadet-run Honor Court was established as a continuously operating body beginning in 1908. The heart of the honor system is the statement that \"a cadet does not lie, cheat, steal, nor tolerate those who do.\" More information.\n\nWhat about VMI's motto, coat of arms, etc?\n\nHere is detailed information about those and related topics.\n\nWhat is a \"Rat\"?\n\nA \"Rat\" is the term used for new cadets; the designation first appeared in the mid-19th century, about 15 years after the establishment of the Institute, and is still in use today.\n\nWhat was life like at VMI during the Civil War?\n\nLook at our Civil War Timeline and Popular Questions for answers to common questions about this era.\n\nWhat are the names of VMI's Superintendents?\n\nVMI has had 15 Superintendents.

Three were founded at VMI --Alpha Tau Omega, Kappa Sigma Kappa, and Sigma Nu -- and others established chapters at the Institute.
