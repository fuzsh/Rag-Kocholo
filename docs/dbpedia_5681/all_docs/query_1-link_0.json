        "text": "While other nations have Marines who are aviators, only the United States Marine Corps has its own dedicated aviation arm. Most squadrons have changed names and designations many times over the years so they are listed by their final designation.\n\nSquadron designations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe basic tactical and administrative unit of United States Marine Corps Aviation is the squadron. Fixed-wing aircraft squadrons (heavier than air) are denoted by the letter \"V,\" which comes from the French verb \"Voler\" (to fly). Rotary wing (helicopter) squadrons use \"H.\" Marine squadrons are always noted by the second letter \"M.\" Squadron numbering is not linear as some were numbered in ascending order and others took numbers from the wing or the ship to which they were assigned. From 1920 to 1941, Marine flying squadrons were identified by one digit numbers. This changed on 1 July 1941 when all existing squadrons were redesignated to a three-digit system. The first two numbers were supposed to identify the squadrons parent group but with the rapid expansion during the war and frequent transfer of squadrons this system fell apart.\n\nDecommissioned squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nSquadrons are listed by their designation at the time they were decommissioned.\n\nPre–World War II squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing World War I, Marine aviation was significantly reduced from 8 to 3 squadrons. Many of the squadrons were renamed and re-designated numerous times and many still exist today with other designations. The squadrons listed below reflect those squadrons that were decommissioned prior to World War II and were never reconstituted in any form.\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Sources VP-3M\n\nMarine Patrol Squadron 3 1931 VO-6M\n\nMarine Observation Squadron 6\n\nHell Divers 1932 VO-10M\n\nMarine Observation Squadron 10\n\n1 April 1931 VS-14M\n\nMarine Scouting Squadron 14 1 July 1933 VS-15M\n\nMarine Scouting Squadron 15 1 July 1933 ZK-1M\n\n1st Marine Barrage Balloon Squadron 31 December 1929\n\nMarine Reserve Scouting Squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Marine Aviation Reserve was inactive from 1918 through 1928. When it was reconstituted, the names and aircraft used by these squadrons changed frequently but their home duty stations remained constant. The aircraft for these squadrons were assigned to the reserve bases themselves and were shared with co-located Navy Reserve squadrons.[6] The squadrons were absorbed into the 1st and 2nd Marine Aircraft Wings and their identities lost when they were mobilized in December 1940.\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Location Date Decommissioned Source VMS-1R Boston, Massachusetts December 1940 [6] VMS-2R Brooklyn, New York December 1940 [6] VMS-3R Anacostia, D.C.

After the outbreak of World War II, the Navy authorized the Marine Corps to create barrage balloon squadrons for the air defense of advanced naval bases. Balloon training was cancelled in the summer of 1943 and the remaining units were decommissioned by the end of the year.\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source ZMQ-1 15 December 1943 ZMQ-2 21 August 1943 ZMQ-3 9 December 1943 [13] ZMQ-4 20 February 1943 ZMQ-5 5 December 1943 ZMQ-6 8 December 1943\n\nMarine Balloon Observation Squadron\n\n[edit]\n\nZK-1M was formed in 1924 and disbanded in 1929.\n\nMarine Scout Bombing Squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nScout bombing squadrons each had eighteen to twenty-four Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers and were tasked with conducting dive-bombing attacks and long range scouting and patrol missions. They also provided close air support, laid smoke screens and sprayed DDT around bases.[14] The majority of these squadrons were quickly decommissioned following the end of World War II although three entered the Marine Air Reserve for a short period.\n\nSBD Dauntless\n\nSB2C Helldiver\n\nMarine Torpedo Bombing Squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nVMTBs were torpedo bomber squadrons that operated the Grumman TBF Avenger. They were in service with the Marine Corps during World War II and were decommissioned shortly after the war. They were part of the Cactus Air Force on Guadalcanal, served on escort carriers during the campaign to retake the Philippines and provided close air support for Australian forces on Borneo and Marines during the Battle of Okinawa.[28]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source VMTB-151 Ali Baba 20 March 1946 [24] VMTB-341 Torrid Turtles 13 September 1945 VMTB-454 Helldivers 28 January 1946 VMTB-621 10 March 1945 VMTB-622 31 January 1946 VMTB-623 20 March 1946 VMTB-624 10 March 1946\n\nMarine Fighting Squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nMarine Fighting Squadrons were multirole squadrons responsible for air-to-air combat, combat air patrols, attacking enemy shipping, escorting bombers and close air support. By far the most numerous of any type of Marine Corps squadron, they first made their mark flying the Grumman F4F Wildcat as part of the Cactus Air Force on Guadalcanal and finished World War II flying the venerable Vought F4U Corsair. Many VMF squadrons continued to operate after the war with most in the Marine Air Reserve; however, with the retirement of the Vought F-8 Crusader the VMF squadrons either became VMFAs or were decommissioned.\n\nMarine Night Fighter Squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter witnessing the Royal Air Force's success using radar directed fighters at night in 1941, the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics authorized eight Marine night fighter squadrons to be formed by 1945. This timeline was brought forward considerably after the attack on Pearl Harbor and their need proven by the frustration of the Cactus Air Force's pilots not being able to engage Japanese bombers at night during the Battle of Guadalcanal. This led to the formation of VMF(N)-531 in November 1942. After much deliberation the Lockheed PV-1 Ventura was picked as the first choice of aircraft for these squadrons. The night fighting squadrons featured radar equipped aircraft, ground-based radar and personnel that provided Ground-controlled interception (GCI). The VMF(N) designated squadrons were decommissioned after the war, those that weren't were re-designated VMF(AW).[61]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source VMF(N)-532 Night Fighters 31 May 1947 VMF(N)-534 31 May 1947 VMF(N)-544 20 April 1946\n\nMarine Bombing Squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Marine Bombing Squadrons were formed during World War II to fill the need for a long range, land based bomber that could be used against enemy shipping and submarines. In the Pacific Theater, the squadrons served ashore as a garrison air force to attack bypassed Japanese bases and other installations. The VMBs flew the North American PBJ-1 Mitchell, which was the naval version of the U.S. Army Air Forces' B-25 Mitchell. Sixteen of these squadrons were commissioned with seven serving in combat, four never able to leave the U.S. due to the war ending and four others converted to VMTB squadrons.[62] The seven PBJ squadrons that saw combat in the Pacific suffered the loss of 45 aircraft, 26 in combat and 19 in non-combat operations, and 173 crew: 62 officers and 111 enlisted men.[63]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source VMB-423 Seahorses 30 November 1945 VMB-433 Fork-Tailed Devils 30 November 1945 [65] VMB-443 Wildcats 30 November 1945 VMB-453 20 March 1946 VMB-473 20 March 1946 VMB-483 15 March 1945 VMB-612 Cram's Rams 14 March 1946 [24] VMB-613 21 November 1945 VMB-614 Ruptured Ducks 28 December 1945\n\nMarine Operational Training Squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nAll of these squadrons were activated as Marine Training Squadrons (MTS) at Marine Corps Air Station Edenton, North Carolina in January 1944 and were redesignated as Marine Operational Training Squadrons (MOTS) and transferred to Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina in February 1945 as medium bomber pilot training units. They instructed Marines learning to fly the North American PBJ-1 Mitchell. Following the end of the war they were quickly decommissioned.\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source MOTS-811 10 September 1945 [26] MOTS-812 10 September 1945 [26] MOTS-813 23 November 1945 [24] MOTS-814 30 November 1945 [24]\n\nMarine Photographic Squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nMarine photographic squadrons were first formed in 1942 and went through numerous name changes while they were active. VMDs/VMPs flew photographic modified versions of the Douglas SBD Dauntless, Consolidated PB4Y-1 Liberator, Consolidated PB4Y-2 Privateer and Grumman F7F Tigercat. The main mission of these squadrons was to conduct long range, very high-altitude photographic reconnaissance.\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source VMD-154 Pathfinders 10 September 1945 [26] VMP-254 30 November 1949 VMP-354 8 December 1949 VMD-954 31 January 1946 [24]\n\nMarine Glider Squadron\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Marine Corps established a glider program in April 1942. Eventually they set goals of having 10,800 Marines qualified as glider infantry, with 1,371 gliders and 3,436 pilots.[73] They originally operated from Page Field on MCRD Parris Island but later moved to Marine Corps Air Station Eagle Mountain Lake outside Dallas, Texas.[74] The program was disbanded in 1943 when it was determined that glider assaults into small, heavily fortified, jungle islands would be tactically unfeasible.[75]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source VML-711 24 May 1943\n\nMarine Transport Squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nFlying the Douglas R4D Skytrain and the Curtiss R5C-1 Commando, these squadrons were responsible for moving troops and cargo, aerial resupply, delivery of Paramarines, and medical evacuation.\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source VMR-152 31 January 1959 VMR-216 Bull Dogs 21 December 1972 VMR-353 15 February 1946 VMR-952 31 May 1947 [79] VMR-953 Puss in Boots 31 May 1947\n\nMarine Scouting Squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nThere were three Marine Scouting Squadrons prior to World War II; however, VMS-3 was the only squadron to retain the designation. The squadron served in Haiti from 1919 through 1934 and then spent its last ten years at St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. During World War II they were the only Marine Corps squadron to operate east of the United States. They began the war flying the Grumman J2F Duck, transitioned to the Naval Aircraft Factory/Vought OS2N Kingfisher and at the time of deactivation were flying SBD Dauntless dive bombers.\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source VMS-3 Devilbirds 20 May 1944\n\nMarine Target Towing Detachments\n\n[edit]\n\nMarine Target Towing detachments were first formed at Marine Corps Air Station Ewa in October 1944. They were responsible for towing targets for antiaircraft gunnery and radar tracking practice. They flew Martin JM-1 Marauders and the Curtiss R5C-1 Commandos. The last of these detachments was decommissioned in March 1946.\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source VMJ-1 October 1945 VMJ-2 6 March 1946 VMJ-3 Red Asses 21 October 1945\n\nMarine Observation Squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Marine observation squadrons were formed during the latter stages of World War II with the primary mission of forward air control of strike aircraft for close air support and air interdiction.[83] They saw extensive service during the Vietnam War flying the North American OV-10 Bronco. The Marine Corps began decommissioning the VMO squadrons following their participation in Operation Desert Storm as turboprop-driven aircraft were being perceived in the wake of that conflict as being too vulnerable to surface-to-air missiles, especially shoulder-launched man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), to fly over modern battlefields. Their mission has been assumed by the VMFA(AW) squadrons flying the F/A-18D Hornet.\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source VMO-1 31 July 1993 VMO-2 Cherry Deuce 20 May 1993 VMO-4 Evil Eyes 31 March 1994 VMO-6 Tomcats 1 January 1976 [84][85] VMO-7 16 November 1945 VMO-8 July 10, 1976 [86]\n\nMarine Attack Squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1951, the Marine Corps began fielding the Douglas AD-1 Skyraider ground attack aircraft which had as its main role close air support for the Marines on the ground. Thus many squadrons had their designation changed from VMF to VMA to reflect this ground attack role. 13 squadrons were equipped with the Skyraider until they were finally phased out in 1958.[87] Follow on VMA squadrons operated the A-4 Skyhawk during the Vietnam War through their retirement just after Operation Desert Storm. The VMA tradition is carried on today by squadrons flying the AV-8B Harrier II.\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source VMA-131 Diamondbacks 5 December 1998 VMA-133 Dragons 30 September 1992 VMA-141 1 September 1969 [89] VMA-143 Ragin Cajuns 30 June 1962 [90] VMA-144 Hensagliska 31 October 1965 [91] VMA-217 Max's Wild Hares 1964 VMA-233 Flying Deadheads 1 July 1969 [89] VMA-236 Black Panthers 31 August 1962 [92] VMA-241 Sons of Satan 1 October 1969 [89] VMA-322 Fighting Gamecocks 27 June 1992 [93] VMA-324 Devildogs 29 August 1974 [94] VMA-331 Bumblebeess 1 October 1992 VMA-543 Night Hawks 1 April 1974 VMA-611 1 March 1969 [89]\n\nMarine Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nVMAQ squadrons operated the EA-6B Prowler[96] and were tasked with providing electronic attack, electronic counter-countermeasures, radar jamming and suppression of enemy air defense using the AN/ALQ-99 jamming pod[97] and the AGM-88 HARM. Each of the four squadrons operated five aircraft and were land-based, although they were capable of landing on board U.S. Navy aircraft carriers.[98][99] VMAQ-2 decommissioned on 8 March 2019 marking the end of active service for the VMAQs and the EA-6B Prowler.\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source VMAQT-1 Banshees 29 April 2016 [100] VMAQ-2 Death Jesters 8 March. 2019 [101] VMAQ-3 Moon Dogs 11 May 2018 [102] VMAQ-4 Seahawks 2 June 2017 [103]\n\nMarine Reconnaissance Squadron\n\n[edit]\n\nMarine Reconnaissance Squadron 4 was the only reserve photographic reconnaissance squadron in the Marine Corps. Initially based in Naval Air Station New Orleans, Louisiana they moved to Naval Air Station Olathe, Kansas 1 May 1967 and then again to Naval Air Station Dallas, Texas in 1970 when the reserves were reorganized. They flew Vought RF-8A Crusader until 1969 when all the planes were replaced with the Vought RF-8G Crusader.[104]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source VMJ-4 1973\n\nMarine Composite Reconnaissance Squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing the Korean War Marine Composite Squadron 1 (VMC-1) and Marine Photographic Squadron 1 (VMJ-1) were combined to form VMCJ-1. The new squadron was responsible for both Photoreconnaissance and Electronic Warfare. In its early years it flew the Vought RF-8A Crusader and Douglas EF-10B Skyknight but these were later replaced by the McDonnell-Douglas RF-4B Phantom II and the Grumman EA-6A Electric Intruder. The squadron was decommissioned following the end of the Vietnam War and the reorganization of the Marine Corps' composite community in 1975.\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source VMCJ-1 Golden Hawks 1 September 1975 [105]\n\nMarine Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron\n\n[edit]\n\nUpon the decommissioning of the Marine Composite Squadrons (VMCJs), VMFP-3 became the lone photographic reconnaissance squadron in the Marine Corps.[106] They flew the McDonnell-Douglas RF-4B Phantom II and operated from 1975 until being decommissioned in 1990. Their capability has since been replaced by various targeting pods used on Marine aircraft and the Advanced Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance System which is found in some of the McDonnell-Douglas F/A-18 Hornet squadrons.[107]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source VMFP-3 Eyes of the Corps 3 September 1990\n\nMarine Fighter Attack Squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first Marine Corps squadron to be redesignated a VMFA was in June 1962 upon receipt of the first McDonnell-Douglas F-4 Phantom II aircraft. VMF and VMA squadrons were redesignated because the new Phantoms could be both fighter aircraft and ground attack aircraft.[108] These squadrons were heavily deployed during the Vietnam War. Most of these squadrons would eventually convert to the McDonnell-Douglas F/A-18 Hornet with the last F-4 Phantom leaving service in 1992.[109] The end of the Cold War saw the deactivation of some VMFA squadrons as part of the overall drawdown of the US Military[110]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source VMFA-115 Silver Eagles 9 November 2023 [111] VMFA-124 Whistling Death 19 June 1999 [112] VMFA-134 Smoke 1 April 2007 [113] VMFA-142 Gators July 2008 [114] VMFA-212 Lancers 11 March 2008 [115] VMFA-235 Death Angels 14 June 1996 VMFA-251 Thunderbolts 23 April 2020 [117] VMFA-321 Hells Angels 30 September 2004 [118] VMFA-333 Fighting Shamrocks 31 March 1992 VMFA-334 Falcons 30 December 1971 VMFA-351 1978 VMFA-531 Grey Ghosts 27 April 1992\n\nMarine All-Weather Fighter Attack Squadron\n\n[edit]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source VMFA(AW)-332 Moonlighters 30 March 2007 [123]\n\nMarine Heavy Helicopter Squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source HMH-463 Pegasus 22 April 2022 [124] HMH-366 Hammerheads 16 December 2022 [125] HMH-769 Titan 2 August 2008 [126] HMH-777 Flying Armadillos 1980 [127]\n\nMarine Medium Helicopter Squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nThe original Marine Medium Helicopter squadrons flew the Sikorsky UH-34D Sea Horse, which shortly after its inception saw extensive combat during the Vietnam War.[128] Beginning in 1966 they began to be replaced with the CH-46 Sea Knight which was faster, could carry more troops and is still in service today.[129] The decommissioned HMM squadrons reflect the UH-34D training squadron and various reserve squadrons.\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source HMM-761 31 August 1962 [130] HMM-762 31 December 1962 [131] HMM-763 30 September 1962 [132] HMM-766 Beavers 1 October 1976 [133] HMM-768 1976 [134]\n\nMarine Light Helicopter Squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source HML-765 30 June 1976 [135] HML-767 Nomads 1 August 1994 [136] HMM-770 Stingers 1980 [137] HML-771 Hummers 1 August 1994 [136] HML-776 Gangsters 1 July 1994 [136]\n\nMarine Light Attack Helicopter Squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Marine Corps’ light attack squadrons (HMLAs) are composite squadrons usually made up of 12 Bell AH-1Z Cobras and 6 Bell UH-1Y Hueys. The primary missions of the Cobra is close air support, forward air control, reconnaissance and armed escort, while the Huey provided airborne command and control, utility support, supporting arms coordination and medical evacuation. These squadrons were first formed during the Vietnam War with the fielding of the Bell AH-1 Cobra gunship and its being combined in the same squadron with the UH-1H Iroquois that initially belonged to the Marine Corps' VMO squadrons. The majority of these squadrons are still active in the Fleet Marine Force today.\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source HMLA-467 Sabers 16 June 2016 [138] HMLA-469 Vengeance 16 December 2022 [139]\n\nMarine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron\n\n[edit]\n\nMarine tiltrotor squadrons operate the MV-22 Osprey with their main mission being assault support. The Osprey offers twice the speed, five times the range, and can fly more than twice as high as the CH-46 Sea Knight it replaced. The Marine Corps has 18 operational Osprey squadrons as of April 2018.\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source VMM-166 Sea Elk 1 October 2021 [140] VMM-264 Black Knights 24 June 2020 VMM-561 Pale Horses 7 July 2012\n\nTraining squadrons\n\n[edit]\n\n[141]\n\nSquadron Name Insignia Nickname Date Decommissioned Source VMAT-20\n\nMarine Attack Training Squadron VMFAT-101\n\nMarine Fighter Attack Training Squadron Sharpshooters 29 September 2023 [142] VMAT-102\n\nMarine Attack Training Squadron Skyhawks 1 October 1987 VMT-103\n\nMarine Training Squadron Sky Chickens 31 May 1972 [143] VMFAT-201\n\nMarine Fighter Attack Training Squadron Hawks 30 September 1974 [144] VMAT(AW)-202\n\nMarine All-Weather Attack Training Squadron Double Eagles 1990 VMAT-203\n\nMarine Attack Training Squadron Hawks 29 October 2021 [145] VMGRT-253\n\nMarine Aerial Refueler Transport Training Squadron Titans 14 September 2006 HMT-301\n\nMarine Helicopter Training Squadron\n\nWindwalkers 3 June 2005 [146] HMHT-401\n\nMarine Heavy Helicopter Training Squadron 1 May 1972 [147] HMMT-402\n\nMarine Medium Helicopter Training Squadron 1 May 1972 [147]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nUnited States Marine Corps Aviation\n\nList of United States Marine Corps battalions\n\nList of United States Marine Corps aircraft wings\n\nList of active United States Marine Corps aircraft squadrons\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography"
