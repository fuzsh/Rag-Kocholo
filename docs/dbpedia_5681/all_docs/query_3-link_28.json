It is derived from official records and appropriate published historical works.\n\nThis chronology is published for the information of all interested in Marine Corps activities during the period, 19351946 and is dedicated to those Marines who participated in the events listed.\n\nLieutenant General,\n\nU.S. Marine Corps Chief of Staff\n\nReviewed and approved: 25 March 1971\n\n--iii--\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nIntroduction vii Bibliography ix Glossary xvi The Year: 1935 1 1936 1 1937 2 1938 3 1939 4 1940 5 1941 8 1942 18 1943 37 1944 65 1945 101 1946 131\n\n-- v--\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis chronology is presented principally as a ready reference by time sequence to Marine Corps activities from the introduction of amphibious concepts in 1935 to the return to peacetime strength after World War II. The period 1941-1946, moreover, has been organized by geographic area so that the reader can place Marine Corps activities in proper perspective to world events. An exception to the use of geographic designations is the heading \"USMC,\" employed to provide for those entries which effect the Marine Corps in its entirety. Because significant events prior to 1941 are limited, the geographic categorization was omitted in those years.\n\nAll military units and names that are not specified as to service and nationality are Marine Corps. Certain well known personalities--e.g. General MacArthur, Admiral Nimitz--are referred to by surname only.\n\n--vii--\n\nBibliography\n\n1stLt Robert A.

(Gazette, v. 30, no. 9 (Sep46), p. 44; CMCRpt, 1937, p. 4). 6-8 May Marines commanded by Lieutenant Colonel W.T.H. Galliford carried out rescue and riot control duties at Lakehurst, New Jersey, after the flaming crash of the German airship Hindenburg. (\"Galliford\"). 8 Jun Retired Major General Ben H.

(Marine Corps League, 29th National Convention, 1952, p. 12). 8 Aug-8 Nov The Second Battle of Shanghai. The killing of two Japanese marines by Chinese near Shanghai led to the landing of a Japanese naval force. Due to the superior Chinese force, the Japanese were obliged to land an army which after heavy resistance forced the Chinese to withdraw from the city. (Langer, p. 1121). 12 Aug The 4th Marines at Shanghai, China, was augmented by a landing force from the USS Augusta of 50 Marines and 57 bluejackets. (Condit and Turnbladh, p. 173). 13 Aug Elements of the 4th Marines occupied positions in Sector \"C\" at Shanghai, China, an area assigned to the regiment under the International Defense Scheme, in support of the Municipal Police.

Sector \"C\"--assigned to the regiment under the International Defense Scheme--was reorganized on a brigade basis into two regimental subsectors. (Condit and Turnbladh, p. 175). 8 Nov-28 Nov 1941 During this period, in several incidents, the Japanese violated the International Settlement in Shanghai, China, leading to the arrest of Japanese gendarmes by Marines of the 4th Regiment. (Condit and Turnbladh, pp. 176-193). 1 Dec The 3d Marines, a reserve regiment with headquarters at San Francisco since its organization on 1 December 1925» was disbanded.
