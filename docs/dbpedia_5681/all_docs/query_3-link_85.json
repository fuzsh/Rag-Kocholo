        "text": "#TheMorningInclusive Celebrating Japanese Heritage and Belonging üå∏ #DidYouKnow It is reported that America‚Äôs first Japanese immigrant arrived in 1843, on this day May 7th. His name was Manjiro, a 14-year-old fisherman who survived a shipwreck and was adopted by American Captain William Whitfield. Manjiro became a bridge between Japan and the West, working as a political emissary. His journey symbolizes resilience, cultural exchange, and the power of belonging. Japanese Americans have woven their rich heritage into the American tapestry. Their contributions are profound, ranging from art and cuisine to technology and fashion. Advancements Made by Japanese Americans: Atomic Science: Chinese-born physicist Chien-Shiung Wu played a pivotal role in the developing field of atomic science. During the Manhattan Project, she improved existing technology for radiation detection and uranium enrichment. Her work on beta decay furthered our understanding of nuclear processes, yet she was often overlooked. Farm Workers‚Äô Rights: Born in the Philippines, Larry Itliong was a labor organizer who fought for fair wages and better conditions for farmworkers. His efforts, alongside Cesar Chavez, significantly improved workers‚Äô rights. Hoover Institution Research: Scholars like Yasuo Sakata have explored the 1930s Japanese American experience. The anthology ‚ÄúJapanese America on the Eve of the Pacific War‚Äù sheds light on this underexplored era, revealing social, political, and economic currents. Socioeconomic Success: Despite social injustices, Japanese Americans are one of the most socioeconomically successful ethnic groups in the US. They have high median educational levels, income exceeding that of white Americans, and a greater likelihood of being employed as professionals. Creating a Culture of Belonging: Let‚Äôs honor Manjiro‚Äôs legacy by fostering inclusion. We build a workplace where everyone thrives when we recognize unique perspectives, connect authentically, and value each other. üåéü§ù #AAPIHeritageMonth #Belonging #Inclusion #Diversity #Equity #Accessibility #JapaneseAmericanCulture NOTE: Image was created with Copilot as a summary of this post.\n\nüåü Exciting Developments in South Korea's Cultural Space üá∞üá∑ South Korea is gearing up to solidify its position as a global cultural hub, and the Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism is leading the charge with bold policy initiatives. üîπ Restructuring for Success: As part of a strategic move, the Ministry is reorganising its operations, including the closure of the Korean Culture and Information Service (KOCIS) after 52 years. This shake-up aims to streamline efforts and enhance effectiveness in promoting Korean culture abroad. üîπ Investing in Innovation: Minister Yu In-chon recently announced a record-breaking 1.74 trillion won (US$1.31 billion) investment to bolster South Korea's presence in the international content market. These funds will fuel advancements in key sectors like webtoons, comics, and gaming, driving economic growth and cultural influence. üîπ Cultural Diplomacy at its Finest: With exports reaching an all-time high of $13.24 billion in 2022, South Korea is doubling down on efforts to showcase its rich cultural heritage globally. The government plans to support the distribution of Korean operas, ballets, literature, and more, fostering appreciation and admiration for Korean pop culture worldwide. üîπ Olympic Spotlight: In anticipation of the 2024 Olympics in Paris, South Korea is gearing up for a series of cultural events, including a Hallyu-themed trade fair, K-pop concert, and exhibitions highlighting Korean literature and tourism. These initiatives will shine a spotlight on South Korea's vibrant cultural landscape on the world stage. ‚ú® Opinion by Arya Prasad*: The government's proactive stance and forward-thinking policies are commendable. South Korea's cultural industries continue to thrive, serving as a beacon of success and inspiration for nations worldwide. üåç Credit: Yonhap News Agency #SouthKorea #CulturalHub #CulturalDiplomacy #GlobalInfluence #PolicyInitiatives #KoreanCulture #Innovation #Olympics2024 #Hallyu *Arya Prasad is a PhD Scholar of Korean Studies from the Centre for East Asian Studies, JNU.\n\nMay marks Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, which celebrates the histories of Americans from Asia and the Pacific islands of Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia. May was chosen to commemorate Asian American and Pacific Islanders from two key dates: May 7 and May 10. May 7, 1843, marks the arrival of the first Japanese immigrants to the United States. And May 10, 1869, or Golden Spike Day, recognizes the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S., which had significant contributions from Chinese workers. There are various ways to celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage month. We can start with learning about their traditions, food, and music. Host a book club featuring an Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) author or a film screening featuring an AAPI director. Explore and support local AAPI businesses. At work, provide learning opportunities, honor the culture through employee events, or host a fireside chat about Asian representation. These are a few of the many ways we can honor and support Asian American and Pacific Islanders. How will you celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage month? #AsianPacificAmericanMonth #LearnAndSupport #CelebrateAndHonor\n\nPicture a nation devoid of baby laughter. Korea faces such a future and it's a thought that haunts my sleep. So who, or rather what, is the culprit? ‚Äî individualism? ‚Äî modernization? ‚Äî technology? ‚Äî fight for women's rights? ‚Äî higher living standards? A complex mixture of all these factors? Maybe. But this isn't a crime scene. It's a signal, a dire SOS that Koreans are dwindling in numbers. Where does the solution lie? The government, despite its best efforts, can't answer this alone. But here's an idea. Consider our fellow Koreans living abroad. Through my lens, I've noticed they often bear larger families. ‚Äî Could immersion in various cultures and lifestyles fan the fire of desire for bigger families? ‚ÄîCould the unique challenges and experiences of living abroad strengthen familial bonds and values? ‚ÄîIs it possible that distance from one's homeland offers valuable perspectives that encourage family growth and unity? It's just a piece of a colossal, intricate puzzle waiting to be solved. Let's start a global discourse on how cultural dynamics could be a game-changer. Chime in por favor. I'm curious to learn. Genuinely. ~~~ If you enjoyed this, share the post ‚ôªÔ∏è with your network and follow me David Yi, JD for 2x daily content at 8:30a & 6:30p CT.\n\nConsidering GDP, South Korea is the 4th largest economy in Asia and ranks 10th globally. After achieving independence through the Korean War, South Korea has become a remarkable name and model of a rapidly growing economy worldwide. How did they achieve such rapid prosperity? What was the source? Yes, South Korea followed a unique strategy in this regard, known as ‚Äòsoft power.‚Äô The core of soft power is Korean culture, which they have turned into their strength. South Korea is the only country in the world that is dedicatedly striving to become a leader in exporting culture. #koreanwave #hallyu #koreanculture #koreaneconomy"
