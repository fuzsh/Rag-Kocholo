        "text": "The Walton College Academic Advising Center, like any other organization - whether manufacturing, distribution, retail, or other - faces the ongoing temptation to rest comfortably in the status quo of what’s worked in the past and, therefore, miss opportunities in the present and for the future. So when the leaders at the center agreed to work with students in our supply chain operations & process improvement course, I wondered just how much resistance would take place when it actually came to embracing new ideas.\n\nAs it turned out, there was far more collaboration than resistance. The students encountered challenges that sharpened their thinking and understanding of process improvement theories, but they also experienced some counter-intuitive successes because sticking to the status quo never became a barrier to success.\n\nAs I pointed out in a recent article for Walton Insights, there are five common obstacles to any continuous improvement project. Those challenges, however, were largely avoided or overcome during this project. I explained how and why in more detail in the Walton Insights article, but, in short, it was because students and the 12 advisors at the center worked together in some remarkable ways, choosing to . . .\n\nengage rather than resist (the advisors, motivated by their shared passion to serve students, raised legitimate questions and concerns, but were remarkably receptive to change),\n\nco-create customer value rather than analyze from a distance (we had the unique situation of having the customers--the students--as collaborating participants),\n\nsolve problems by fully understanding the situation rather than quickly jumping to solutions based on plausible, but unfounded, assumptions (this took some coaching, but the students shifted their mindsets to true problem-solving approaches),\n\nconsider people and processes solutions rather than focusing mainly on technology (I frankly was surprised at how the students embraced the idea of using technology to enable people and processes instead of starting with technology and force-fitting it into a solution), and\n\ncreate a mindset for sustained continuous improvement rather than settling for one-and-done solutions (it’s early, of course, but so far the advisors have continued to meet to review data and identify new areas where they can learn and improve).\n\nThe success of this project was important on a number of levels.\n\nOne, the Academic Advising Center has around 18,000 appointments a year with students and provides essential services to guide them along their academic journey. It’s essential that the advisors continuously improve their processes to best meet the changing needs of those students.\n\nTwo, the students were able to put into practice the concepts they were learning, which helps reinforce retention. This prepares them to make an impact in their careers, whether they work in a corporate office or on the floor of a manufacturing facility.\n\nThree, by comparing their experiences with case studies of projects that didn’t go as well, they were able to experience the “how” and the “why” of process improvement in key ways that will help them better navigate a variety of situations they might face in the future.\n\nAnd, four, the project aligned with core components of the Walton College mission and with a specific initiative of the university’s chancellor (making “student-centeredness” core to decision-making). The UA and Walton College both benefited because the project supported stated mantras. And the students learned the importance of making sure process improvements support business strategies and objectives.\n\nIn fact, as I noted in the Walton Insight’s piece, a key reason the students experienced such positive results in the project was that it aligns with the purpose, passion and values of the college and university and that it had the full support and participation of leaders -- not only in the advising center but all the way to the dean of the Walton College.\n\nWhen leadership is committed to continuous improvement, the status quo becomes a building block, not an obstacle, and new opportunities are embraced, chased, and achieved."
