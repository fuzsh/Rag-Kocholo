        "text": "Author:Paul Clark, Greg Harper\n\nMy main Tears for Fears period encompasses Songs From The Big Chair and The Seeds Of Love, which I suspect is the case for most casual fans of the band – if I had to choose a favourite song it would undoubtedly be the superb Head Over Heels. This book takes a long look at all the band’s work, right up to the recent Tipping Point set. It’s easy to categorise them as an eighties band, but their musical vision and forty plus years career makes them easily transcend that label. The inevitable musical differences meant that Orzabal sailed the ship alone for a while, but eventually a reconciliation occurred and the duo reconvened and showed they had lost none of their magic, as evidenced by this year’s album and live shows. This is a fascinating look at their complete career, song by song, including solo outings, and is certainly recommended for their many fans.\n\nThe eighties isn’t the decade one automatically thinks of when considering Quo’s prime years. Nevertheless, despite internal strife, the band still managed to thrive on and off in that decade, helped by their appearance opening the show at Live Aid. The albums in the early part of the eighties were certainly better than the later ones, and the material on offer was a very mixed bag, ranging from the sublime Ol’ Rag Blues to the ridiculous Marguerita Time, as the band turned away from their rock roots to becoming more focussed on pop oriented songs. The departures of John Coghlan and Alan Lancaster were the real turning point, allowing Francis Rossi to increasingly dominate the band, with Rick Parfitt seemingly happy to just be along for the ride. Things were certainly never the same from then on as the band descended into becoming something of a parody of their former selves and entering a slow decline, although they never lost the ability to put on a good live show and put bums on seats. Having said all that, I really enjoyed this interesting and in depth look at this often overlooked period in the band’s history, which provides a couple of hours of very enjoyable reading.\n\nLength of Read:Short\n\nMight appeal to people who enjoyed…\n\nFans, readers of previous books in these series.\n\nOne thing you’ve learned\n\nThese books are always a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours."
