        "text": "Seven-Leg Base\n\nSeven legs mean a 20% improved ease of movement and more stability over five-leg chairs. This is especially important for larger individuals who may find moving in their chairs difficult.\n\nSteel construction with metal strength ring and tested to 10,000lb dynamic load, our base is unmatched in strength and stability.\n\nReplaceable Covers\n\nExtend the life of your 24/7 chair within a matter of minutes - make your chair new again by replacing the cover.\n\nThe 3142r1 coverset is all-in-one, with a single cover fitting the headrest, backrest, and seat. Industrial strength hook-and-loop attaches the cover to the chair.\n\nHeight Adjustment\n\nOur goal is to provide proper ergonomic support for most body types, starting with the 4th-percentile female size (approximately 5’ 0”) up to the 96th-percentile male size (approximately 6’ 5”).\n\nHeight adjustment is at your fingertips.\n\nAdjustable Lumbar Support\n\nInfinitely adjustable lumbar support puts back pressure relief at your fingertips. Adjustable back ensures the lumbar is exactly where you want it.\n\nEAS2\n\nYou may not notice it in the first 10 minutes, but you may after the first shift. You will certainly notice it after weeks, months, and years of prolonged seating in a Concept Seating chair. You’ll just feel better.\n\nThe chair in which you've been sitting, with its Ergo Air Suspension System (EAS2) has kept the blood and oxygen flowing through your body, especially through the lower extremities, improving blood flow and increasing oxygen levels to tissues.\n\nSafety Casters\n\nThe 2-point stem, shock absorber, and special bore construction provide an extremely smooth and quiet swivel and roll not found in standard casters.\n\nOnce the chair is sat in, the brake is released and allows the chair to roll freely. This is important for larger people who may need to put weight on the chair's arms to lower themselves into the seat.\n\nA spring shock absorber prolongs the life of the caster as well as the chair. The closed construction reduces the amount of dirt and hair getting into the caster, prolonging its life.\n\nAdjustable Armrests\n\nEasily adjust the width of the armrests to accommodate a larger person or a person with a duty belt just by sliding out the arms.\n\nAdjustment is made by loosening the thumb screw and adjusting to the desired width. Adjustable to 2.5” on both sides.\n\nSeven-Position Tilt\n\nRecline to one of seven desired positions and keep it there with the push of a button.\n\nCut-Away Sides\n\nWhether your duty belt is a sidearm or a radio, the cutaway sides allow you to sit more comfortably, allowing most equipment on the duty belt to hang free without poking into your back while seated."
