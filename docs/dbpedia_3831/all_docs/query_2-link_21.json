        "text": "Look What She Made Me Do\n\nJoin me each month for an exclusive drop of a one-of-a-kind Chair Whimsy design for every album featured in Taylor Swift‚Äôs epic, three-hour Eras show.\n\nAll culminating in a Live Auction sale for the Collection in the Fall!\n\nI‚Äôm a Swiftie for so many reasons.\n\nI admire Taylor‚Äôs lyrical talent and entertainment presence, her naturally keen business sense, and her ability to connect with her audience and always know how to serve them.\n\nTo honor Taylor‚Äôs body of work and the biggest global tour in history, I‚Äôm crafting a tactile and visual experience to accompany her storytelling. Each repurposed chair will evoke the spirit of a single album, and include a special instructional and source guide to create your own.\n\nAnd, in true Taylor fashion, I‚Äôll include plenty of fun goodies, like my personal playlist for each album, a design guide to create your own themed chair, and maybe the most fun of all‚Äìlots of ‚ÄúEaster Eggs‚Äù to hint at which album-themed chair is next, and even a hidden message to be decoded throughout the entire experience.\n\nThis Fall, I‚Äôll hold a Live Virtual Auction where you‚Äôll have the chance to win your favorite chair, and we‚Äôll wrap it all up with a big donation to a local charity that aids families experiencing food scarcity.\n\nChair #1 Lover-Inspired\n\nAlthough Lover is up first in chair form, it was Taylor‚Äôs seventh studio album and the last one released pre-pandemic. Visually and lyrically lighter and brighter than her prior release of Reputation, fans saw the return of ‚Äúfun‚Äù Taylor. It‚Äôs also her first album with a new recording company, which is significant in her journey as an artist. Taylor declared at the 2023 VMA‚Äôs that she loves to write and perform pop music most, and this album delivers. She continues mixing evocative visual elements with her music to keep her fans engaged with the stories she tells.\n\nLover spells pink for me...all over pink with no shame! These happy pink colors are consistent with Taylor's videos from her Lover album. The pale pink paint is drawn from the pastel suits and sky in the Me! video, with hot pink crushed velvet inspired by Taylor‚Äôs cropped fur jacket in You Need To Calm Down. And, lastly what‚Äôs the flower of love? Also featured in a wallpaper backdrop of one of the rooms in her Lover video - roses!\n\nCreate Your Own Lover-Inspired Chair\n\nGrab my Spotify Playlist for this release\n\nI‚Äôll be adding my favorite songs with each new chair reveal! with each new chair reveal!\n\nI Forgot That You Existed\n\nReminds me of early breakups that I thought would crush me and then I just moved on\n\nCruel Summer\n\nYou can't beat this tune!\n\nThe Man\n\nUgh! This one conjures up memories of my first job interview...when the interviewer found out I was female, he snuck out the back and refused to interview me! üòßIt is also a positive reminder that both my girls are excelling in male-dominated professions.\n\nLondon Boy\n\nWho doesn't love the accent?\n\nSoon You'll Get Better\n\nI'm a huge fan of The Chicks!\n\nYou Need to Calm Down\n\nI've even mastered the tongue twister lines in this one üòâ\n\nMe!\n\nSo true of all of us! We are unique and should be appreciated for it.\n\nChair #2 Reputation-Inspired\n\nThe darker themes of the Reputation album, its heavy bass, along with rock and rap elements, showed us a new side of Taylor. After a series of PR stumbles and public scrutiny of her private life, Taylor embarked on a self-inflicted exile from the public eye. In the Miss Americana documentary, she explains this was a time of deep reflection for her about who she wanted to become. Reputation is the first album where Taylor often writes from the point of view of various characters rather than solely her own perspective and experiments with heavily complicated lyrics‚Äìthe gamble paid off as the album marked her return to pop music and helmed a stadium tour that won multiple Tour of Year awards.\n\nSnake imagery was used heavily during Taylor‚Äôs Reputation Era, so the snake-cut velvet was the perfect and only choice for this Reputation-inspired chair. Taylor was called a snake by those who were either her enemies or those who didn't understand her, but she embraced that imagery for this album along with other dark, goth-like undertones. The ornately Victorian carved chair and dark, glittery paint reflect the darker vibes expressed in this album.\n\nCreate Your Own Reputation-Inspired Chair\n\nThis album reminds me that good can still come through the hard seasons in life. The real question is how to keep our hearts open while growing a thick skin for those who have hurt us. Our past is what makes us who we are today. Find love anyway and know that when we can let go of what others think of us (our reputation) and quit trying to please them, we will learn what it means to really live our lives.\n\nGrab my Spotify Playlist for this release\n\nI‚Äôll be adding my favorite songs with each new chair reveal! with each new chair reveal!\n\n...Ready for It?\n\nYou cannot beat this beat. Perfect for the first song on the album setting us up for what is to come. Am I ready for it? Yes, I am!\n\nI Did Something Bad\n\nTaylor takes on the persona of someone who \"plays\" bad boys/people, but she's merely trying on a costume that people who don't know her, say about her. When I've been wronged or misunderstood, I do this also in my mind.\n\nLook What You Made Me Do\n\nTaylor's reputation is dead and this song is her response. This brings back memories of being wronged and not being able to make it right with what others think about me. You process it the best you can in the moment and eventually try to make peace with it.\n\nKing of My Heart\n\nThe love song on this album is a nice warm spot in the midst of the turmoil.\n\nThis is Why We Can't Have Nice Things\n\nThis reminds me of the times I've needed to vent about friendships gone bad.\n\nGetaway Car\n\nSuch a catchy song! And relationship rebounds never work...I remember a few!\n\nNew Year's Day\n\nWe all get fresh starts on New Year's Day, and that's how she ends this album...good things are to come.\n\nChair #3 Folklore-Inspired\n\nIn July 2020, Taylor surprised her fans and entire music industry when she released Folklore only eleven months after her previous album (Lover), and without the normal buildup, fanfare, and easter eggs that accompany most of her launches. Influenced by the isolation of quarantine, Taylor crafted mellow ballads using a cast of fictional characters to develop \"a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness.\" Her folk-driven ballads with indie-rock undertones evoke the quiet nostalgia of a childhood storytime, with some songs sung barely above a whisper.\n\nThe album was recorded remotely, with Taylor, her collaborators like Bon Iver, and producers all working individually from their own home studios. The story of this album was told in the Disney+ documentary, Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions. Its experimental sound was a huge hit, attracting a new fanbase and resulting in Taylor finally receiving credibility as a skilled poet and lyricist from even her most bitter detractors. She also won her third Album of the Year Grammy, making her the first woman in history to win the honor three times.\n\nSince Folklore is born of Taylor‚Äôs imagination and not autobiographical at all, but made up of fictional characters, the chair design started with sheer embroidery adorned with flowers like a fairytale garden. The frame is painted pale pink and is a faux bois style first made popular in the 1800s in France when artists carved furniture to make it look like real wood, when it wasn‚Äôt. Moss is attached to the backside to further represent the cottage-core feel without getting in the way of actually using the chair. The overall representation echoes the feeling of curling up under your favorite tree to get lost in timeless tales and daydreams.\n\nCreate Your Own Folklore-Inspired Chair\n\nThis album is perfect for slow weekend mornings or while concentrating on highly-detailed work. I love how the songs weave together a larger story and can be enjoyed individually or collectively to discover the deeper meaning behind each one. It shows that nobody is ever ALL good or ALL bad, that we are all nuanced, make mistakes, and sometimes carry the joy or the burden of our choices with us long after they‚Äôve passed.\n\nGrab my Spotify Playlist for this release\n\nI‚Äôll be adding my favorite songs with each new chair reveal! with each new chair reveal!\n\nTHE 1\n\nThe tune of this song is so catchy, and I love the positivity even though she didn‚Äôt end up with the 1 she thought she should have.\n\nTHE LAST GREAT AMERICAN DYNASTY\n\nThis is one of my favorite songs because it tells a story about Rebekah Harkness, a wild, rich woman who owned a home in Rhode Island. Then, in a surprising twist, you find out that Taylor owns it now.\n\nMIRRORBALL\n\nMirrorballs are beautiful but have been broken into a million pieces to become the shiny ball. It‚Äôs a reflection of how she has to be different versions of herself for other people and a reminder that we are shapeshifters instead of what we really are.\n\nAUGUST\n\nThis is the other story not told in Betty. This is the girl who got the guy in the summer, but she‚Äôs not a bad girl, just someone who got caught in the middle.\n\nTHIS IS ME TRYING\n\nFor those of us who struggle with life, it‚Äôs a moving song for those who are trying, but their ‚Äútrying‚Äù is still not good enough. It reminds us to be empathetic to others who struggle.\n\nINVISIBLE STRING\n\nThis is a song about fate and how an invisible string ties us to the people in our lives. It‚Äôs fate that we ended up together, but there‚Äôs this common thread that would bring you to me.\n\nBETTY\n\nThis has to be the best tune on the album. While it‚Äôs upbeat, it is an apology written from a guy's perspective to Betty, whom he left behind when August stole him away for the summer.\n\nTHE LAKES\n\nThis is a song about an exit plan of running away to the lake where the poets went to die. Taylor wanted to leave bad things behind and found something worth escaping to and someone to be with. It‚Äôs a reminder to remove the things that aren‚Äôt working for your life.\n\nChair #4 Midnights-Inspired\n\nTaylor has described her 10th studio album, Midnights, as \"the stories of 13 sleepless nights scattered throughout my life.\" She‚Äôs often spoken about waking in the middle of a night inspired and cranking outan entire song, which she finds recorded on her phone the following morning. The music and lyrics throughout Midnights lean toward moody, nocturnal ruminations inspired by the thoughts and ideas that keep many of us up at night.\n\nOver the years, multiple clips have surfaced of her strumming a guitar alone in the dark while trying on different lyrics. Her process is organic, and watching her create hit songs, plunking out a tune on the piano while mixing and matching phrases is fascinating. It feels so familiar with how I create my chair designs. The deep and self-reflective album is nominated for Album of the Year and is the 10th \"era\" showcased in her 2023-24 global tour.\n\nTaylor‚Äôs fashion choices in the videos for Midnights range from 70‚Äôs glam to ‚Äúbejeweled.‚Äù So, to pull together a chair with a look that reflects the album‚Äôs vibe, I‚Äôve chosen dark paint and a rich black velvet with sparkles throughout, and it features a fun sequined back with colors pulled from her costume choices inspired by this album.\n\nCreate Your Own Midnights-Inspired Chair\n\nThe songs/topics are based on 13 sleepless nights. It‚Äôs an autobiographical, darker album exploring topics of anxiety, insecurity, self-criticism, and self-confidence, using confessional, yet cryptic, styled lyrics. By addressing the dark things, Taylor says it‚Äôs a way to suck the poison out of a snake bite.\n\nGrab my Spotify Playlist for this release\n\nI‚Äôll be adding my favorite songs with each new chair reveal! with each new chair reveal!\n\nANTI-HERO\n\nThere‚Äôs nothing that beats this video showing Taylor as a giant in a small house. The small fork is epic. And when we tend to really examine our problems, sometimes we realize that the real problem is me.\n\nYOU‚ÄôRE ON YOUR OWN, KID\n\nThis is my song of the year choice for 2024. At first it seems sad, but it‚Äôs meant to be encouraging‚Ä¶you‚Äôve been on your own the entire time, and you can continue and face whatever is to come. It‚Äôs a song of hope and new beginnings for me.\n\nQUESTION?\n\nThis reminds me of past relationships that sometimes had lingering questions long after they were over. Perhaps it is a way of reassuring myself that I‚Äôm okay.\n\nBEJEWELED\n\nThis is my favorite track on the album. The video shows a Cinderella story with Taylor mopping the floor but then decked out in jewels having her own good time.\n\nKARMA\n\nWhat goes around, comes around. I‚Äôve always believed this, so I do try to keep my side of the street clean and do the right thing.\n\nSWEET NOTHING\n\nWho doesn‚Äôt want to feel they can go to those who love them just as they are for comfort‚Ä¶away from the world‚Äôs pressure and fear.\n\nMASTERMIND\n\nWho hasn‚Äôt schemed a plan to get the one you love? I love the idea of owning up to it and then realizing everyone else knew what was going on.\n\nChair #5 Fearless-Inspired\n\nTaylor‚Äôs second album was a blend of country and pop music, perhaps foreshadowing her future as a pop icon. With more than half of the album‚Äôs songs written solely by Taylor, this album is also the debut of Taylor as a producer of her own music, listing her as a co-producer among the credits.\n\nThe two biggest breakout hits from Fearless were ‚ÄúLove Story‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou Belong With Me.‚Äù The latter went platinum seven times and was accompanied by a video that won Taylor her first Video Music Award in 2009.\n\nThat awards show also ignited the long-term feud between Taylor and Kanye West after he leaped onto the stage to interrupt her speech and claim Beyonce‚Äôs ‚ÄúAll the Single Ladies‚Äù video as the ‚Äúbest video of all time.‚Äù The video, along with the famously catchy lyrics, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs cheer captain and I‚Äôm on the bleachers,‚Äù resonated with women cross-generationally as many were taken back to the days of feeling unseen by their high school crush. This song is believed to be the catalyst for Taylor‚Äôs eventual transition into pop. This album secured one of Taylor‚Äôs first record-breaking wins in the music industry: Female artist with the most Top-20 debuts (five) in just one calendar year.\n\nCreate Your Own Fearless-Inspired Chair\n\nFearless is Taylor‚Äôs coming of age, 2nd studio album. It easily transports us back to the carefree days of our youth, where lives revolved around what happened in school that day, first loves, and friendships that meant everything in those early years. It‚Äôs pure fun, and the writing, although not yet as evolved as her later albums, is impressive for a teenager.\n\nGrab my Spotify Playlist for this release\n\nI‚Äôll be adding my favorite songs with each new chair reveal! with each new chair reveal!\n\nFEARLESS\n\nThere‚Äôs no better song to start off this 2nd album. And this one is a classic Taylor song that gives me the needed encouragement to be fearless.\n\nLOVE STORY\n\nWhat a great Romeo & Juliet song and I can‚Äôt help but jump once it gets to the last chorus! It reminds me of getting engaged 31 years ago.\n\nHEY STEPHEN\n\nThis is my favorite song on the album. I like the beat, the lyrics, and who can‚Äôt identify with unrequited love at some point in their lives? I would replace her lyrics with ‚Äú...but would she make a chair for you?‚Äù\n\nWHITE HORSE\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a princess, this ain‚Äôt a fairytale‚Äù pretty much sums up my dating experience during college. Dated a lot of frogs before I really found my prince.\n\nYOU BELONG WITH ME\n\nOkay, this is the one I remember most playing on the radio in the mornings as I drove my kids to school. Love it!\n\nBREATHE\n\nI love the new version of this song!\n\nTHE WAY I LOVED YOU\n\nSometimes we just yearn for the drama in relationships, don‚Äôt we?\n\nTHE BEST DAY\n\nI love this song for her mother. It‚Äôs moving and touching to see their close relationship‚Ä¶hope this is how my girls feel, too.\n\nCHANGE\n\nI love the courage in this song‚Ä¶standing for what you believed in and worked for. We never give up!\n\nJUMP THEN FALL\n\nThis song is about loving someone and hoping they will jump and then fall for you, too.\n\nChair #6 Evermore-Inspired\n\nLess than five short months after releasing her surprise album, folklore, Taylor released a previously unplanned 9th album, evermore. The album came to life as an extension of her work on folklore, Taylor felt there were still stories to be told, and she has said these are ‚Äúsister‚Äù albums. The subject matter in evermore continues the anthology style of tales about marriage, love, infidelity, and grief that she first introduced in folklore. Because the music started as an experimental extension of her collaborations with Aaron Dressner and Jack Antonoff, there was more freedom in developing music that was not initially intended to become a full-length album. Again, all collaborations were done remotely, due to the ongoing pandemic, and creative license was extended to her vocal guests, including Haim, and Bon Iver.\n\nOne of the most notable production elements of the album occurs in the song, Marjorie. An homage to Taylor‚Äôs maternal grandmother and famed opera singer whose vocals are sampled on the track and playin a subtle call and response, answering Taylor‚Äôs phrase, ‚ÄúIf I didn‚Äôt know better, I‚Äôd think you were singing to me now‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nCreate Your Own Evermore-Inspired Chair\n\nSince Folklore is a sister album to Evermore, I selected this Victorian chair and used the same embroidered fabric, but in a darker version. The purple velvet gives the chair a more ‚Äúfall/winter‚Äù feel as opposed to the summer version of Folklore. I sanded the back side of the chair to give a different ‚Äúwoodsy‚Äù vibe. The front is dark mahogany, alluding to the darker mood of the album. The flowers are a nod to the storytelling found on this album.\n\nGrab my Spotify Playlist for this release\n\nI‚Äôll be adding my favorite songs with each new chair reveal! with each new chair reveal!\n\nWILLOW\n\nI can identify with this song as she talks about bending to the will of those around her. But I love this tune!\n\nCHAMPAGNE PROBLEMS\n\nChampagne should be for celebrating, but this song details the rejection of a lover's proposal. I really like the line, ‚Äú ‚ÄúSometimes you just don't know the answer 'Til someone's on their knees and asks you.‚Äù\n\nMIRRORBALL\n\nSometimes we wish for the path we didn‚Äôt take because it seems easier and more comforting‚Ä¶even though we know we wouldn‚Äôt be happy long term.\n\nNO BODY, NO CRIME\n\nThis dramatic song is such a great story about a friend who went missing, so she made sure the husband went missing and pinned it on the mistress.\n\nHAPPINESS\n\n‚ÄúI haven't met the new me yet‚Äù is a striking line in this song about a breakup. It reminds me that all relationships help us grow and change into a new version of ourselves.\n\nCOWBOY LIKE ME\n\nIn a strange way, this song feels like my story. I met my person in the most unlikely way, and to our surprise, we‚Äôve been a great match for life.\n\nMAJORIE\n\nThis is my favorite song on the album. Taylor remembers her grandmother, and believes she is singing to her. I think of my dad and how I still feel him around me, giving me advice and telling me I can make it. ‚ÄúI should have asked you questions, I should have asked you how to be‚Äù reminds me of all the conversations I now wished I would have had with my dad.\n\nChair #7 Red-Inspired\n\nTaylor's fourth studio album, \"Red,\" was released in October 2012, with the ambition to push her creative boundaries. The album marks a significant chapter in her career as she ventured beyond her country pop roots for the first time. Exploring an eclectic mix of musical styles, including pop, rock, and even dubstep, Taylor aimed to encapsulate \"red\" emotions like love, passion, and heartbreak. This experimental approach defied straightforward genre categorization, sparking debate among critics regarding its true musical identity, although it was largely promoted as a country album.\n\nDominating the charts, \"Red\" spent seven weeks at the top in the US and achieved multi-platinum status worldwide, earning critical acclaim and nominations for Album of the Year at both the Grammy and Country Music Association Awards. Its sonic range, initially divisive among critics, has since been hailed as a transitional masterpiece, acting as a bridge for Taylor's switch to mainstream pop in her following albums. This album is often cited by die-hard Swiftie's as their favorite. Taylor's range, personality, and maturity became more evident with this album. Red is among those recently re-released as \"Taylor's Version\" and includes all 30 songs originally recorded for Red, reaffirming the album's enduring impact and her songwriting prowess.\n\nCreate Your Own Red-Inspired Chair\n\nRed is my favorite Taylor Swift album, so this chair has a very special place in my heart! I created the Red chair using a black and white striped sequin fabric and a red glittered vinyl for the seat. I added stripes on the legs to give it a little something extra and a red sequin heart on the backside. A red scarf is wrapped around the chair as a nod to ‚ÄúAll Too Well.‚Äù\n\nGrab my Spotify Playlist for this release\n\nI‚Äôll be adding my favorite songs with each new chair reveal! with each new chair reveal!\n\nAll Too Well\n\nI can go with either the regular one or the 10 minute version, which actually doesn‚Äôt feel as log as it is. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here‚Äù is a lyric that haunts me.\n\n22\n\nI love this song and it totally reminds me of being that age. In fact, I‚Äôm still thinking I‚Äôm in my 20s‚Ä¶until I try to get up off the floor.\n\nWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\n\nThis is my favorite song on the album. I had some of these types of boyfriends back in the day, so this makes me feel powerful!\n\nStay Stay Stay\n\nThis is a cute song with a catchy verse. It‚Äôs happy and cheerful about a relationship that she wants to work.\n\nEverything Has Changed\n\nThis song is one that shows there is life after heartbreak. When you meet someone new, everything changes.\n\nStarlight\n\nI not only love this tune, but I love the message of dreaming and hoping for bigger things.\n\nBegin Again\n\nThis almost makes the #1 song for me. I love the story of how love blooms again with a new face to focus on.\n\nThe Moment I Knew\n\nWhen the person that means the most to you doesn‚Äôt show up for you, that‚Äôs when you know it‚Äôs not going to work.\n\nNothing New\n\nThis is one of those songs that shows a person‚Äôs insecurities and vulnerability‚Ä¶will you still love me when I‚Äôm nothing new?\n\nMessage in a Bottle\n\nHonestly, all the vault songs are amazing, but I love this one so much. It‚Äôs about after meeting someone, hoping that they will get your message in a bottle that tells them you love them.\n\nI Bet You Think About Me\n\nI like this one because of the country vibe and who doesn‚Äôt love Chris Stapleton???\n\nChair #8 1989-Inspired\n\nThe 1989 album is named after the year Taylor was born and features an 80s-inspired synth-pop, percussion-driven sound. Also, part of her re-released masters collection, the album got rebooted in October 2023, nine years after its initial release, reigniting its original popularity and revealing more additional ‚Äúvault‚Äù tracks that have become fan favorites after being rejected for the original album. 1989 was the first Taylor Swift album that was entirely promoted as a pop album. Even though its predecessor, Red, had mingled with the genre, it had been marketed as a country album. Taylor leaned into the 80‚Äôs aesthetic while debuting the album‚Äôs first single, Welcome to New York on Good Morning America, in October 2014. Performing in an all-black catsuit and sporting darker blonde, straight, sleek bob-cut hair, her look was a huge departure from her previous albums.\n\nTaylor‚Äôs new look for this album started what she‚Äôs now known for, embracing a unique vibe to represent her new work during its promotion and release period. It‚Äôs the catalyst for what became the Eras Tour, where fans now associate certain colors and looks with each album, recognizing what‚Äôs coming next on stage before she even sings one note.\n\nCreate Your Own 1989-Inspired Chair\n\nVery much like Red, 1989 is another top favorite album. It‚Äôs Taylor‚Äôs real switch over to pop music. I remember driving my kids to school and hearing Welcome to New York for the first time. I loved it immediately. I took my inspiration for this chair from the year 1989 and a very special piece of clothing that I wore‚Ä¶my Guess jean jacket. In fact, still have it in my closet! I found this replica jacket online and knew I had to incorporate it into the 1989 design. Blue is a key color, and I washed the frame in blue paint and covered the seat with a beachy blue stripe. Finally, the seagulls are part of her album and are all over the jacket design.\n\nGrab my Spotify Playlist for this release\n\nI‚Äôll be adding my favorite songs with each new chair reveal! with each new chair reveal!\n\nI‚Äôve always loved this song, but now that I‚Äôm moving to NY for the summer, it holds a new special place in my heart!\n\nStyle\n\nShake it Off\n\nWhen people say mean things or outright lies, sometimes you just have to shake it off and go ahead and live your best life.\n\nBad Blood\n\nHave you ever had friendships go bad because someone crossed a line? Unfortunately, this happens and this song reminds me that sometimes we have bad blood between us.\n\nWildest Dreams\n\nI love the chorus on this song, but the video has always reminded me of a cross between Out of Africa and the English Patient‚Ä¶two movies that I also love.\n\nThis Love\n\n‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre young you just run but you always come back to what you need‚Äù is something I‚Äôve found to be so true, and yet we don‚Äôt know this when we are young. It‚Äôs good to be on the other side of this now.\n\nHow You Get the Girl\n\nThis song is so great with a young girl teaching a guy how he can get the girl‚Ä¶doing all the things a girl would want but that he would never think of doing. Isn‚Äôt this what every girl wishes they could teach guys to do?\n\nNew Romantics\n\nTaylor was growing up and her version of life at the time included a new take on life and romance‚Ä¶like the new romantics. The title also echos back to the 1980s when artists like David Bowie used the term too to describe a new wave of fashion and art. This is something I remember as a teenager.\n\nNow that We Don‚Äôt Talk\n\nFirst, I cannot believe this song didn‚Äôt make the original album cut. But I‚Äôm so glad it was released on Taylor‚Äôs version. How can you not love the disco sound/beat of this song???\n\nChair #9 Speak Now-Inspired\n\nIn October 2010, Speak Now, Taylor's third studio album was released styled as country-pop. The entire album was written solely by Taylor while on her Fearless tour. Proving at only nineteen years old, her ability to create stories through song lyrics and write unforgettable hooks.\n\nTransitioning from a teenager to a young woman, the concept of Speak Now was to \"say the things that had gone unsaid.\" Her lyrics were more mature than previous studio releases but still very much in line with the romantic entanglements and challenges facing a young woman. In her documentary, Miss Americana, she shares that she had bought into the narrative that she always needed to uphold a \"good girl\" and avoid confrontation, so Taylor used her music as her outlet. Speak Now (Taylor's Version, July 2023) stirred up controversy among fans when she changed a lyric in a fan-favorite song to align with her movement toward feminism.\n\nHer song Mean, written to address a male journalist who wrote disparaging things about her performance abilities when she was younger, was recently named #20 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of 200 best country songs.\n\nCreate Your Own Speak Now-Inspired Chair\n\nBeing Taylor‚Äôs 3rd album, we all knew what to expect from her by this point. It was marketed and sold as a country album, and like her previous albums is upbeat and fun to listen to. As with the first two albums, I remember listening to this release while driving my kids to school. My girls, in particular, loved her music by then and we all enjoyed listening together.\n\nWhen designing this chair, I knew it had to be purple and have a skirt with tulle. It is a symbol of what she wore in her concert and on the album‚Äôs cover. I chose this floral velvet by Kim Parker, a remnant of a discontinued fabric and a light pink tulle underneath. It reminds me of the Speak Now song and attending a wedding all dressed up. I particularly love how the back of this chair resembles the bodice of a gown!\n\nGrab my Spotify Playlist for this release\n\nI‚Äôll be adding my favorite songs with each new chair reveal! with each new chair reveal!\n\nSpeak Now\n\nI‚Äôve always laughed at this song‚Ä¶at the thought of standing up and actually taking the clergy‚Äôs offer to object to a wedding. It‚Äôs a fun lighthearted song.\n\nDear John\n\nThe pen is mightier than the sword. This song written to a former lover who had a twisted way of toying with her as a young girl is the best revenge for his behavior.\n\nMean\n\nSurprisingly, I‚Äôve always had a thing for banjos, and this one has the sound! And it is my favorite song on the album. I love the message of realizing the negativity of others doesn‚Äôt have to affect us if we call it out.\n\nNever Grow Up\n\nThis bittersweet song is about wishing we didn‚Äôt have to grow up and experience the hardships and disappointments of life. I love the simplicity and truth of it.\n\nEnchanted\n\nNothing is better than seeing someone you want to meet‚Äîwho also wants to meet you‚Äîand escape the awkward meet-and-greet pleasantries at a party. I love the idea that this is someone she wants to know at first glance.\n\nLong Live\n\nThe memories of what you were before you were ‚Äúknown‚Äù are amazing to look back on. I love this song because it reminds me of dreaming big for what you want.\n\nChair #10 Debut-Inspired\n\nAfter peddling her demo up and down Music Row in Nashville at the age of 13, Taylor Swift was signed with Big Machine Records to release her very first album. Although self-titled, Taylor Swift is now often referred to as ‚ÄúDebut‚Äù by fans. Released in October 2006, ‚ÄúDebut‚Äù is a pop-influenced country album, complete with Taylor singing in a breathy southern drawl. Most impressive though, is that every song was written or co-written by Taylor during her freshman year of high school. The album‚Äôs 3rd single, ‚ÄúOur Song,‚Äù was solely written by Taylor for her school talent show and she had to fight for the label to include it, insisting that the kids at her school loved it. This may be the first glimpse of Taylor truly understanding how to connect with people through her music and standing her ground to elevate her artistry above the standard marketing practices of record labels at the time. Five singles total, including ‚ÄúTime McGraw,‚Äù made it to the radio and the Billboard Top 100 charts. The album stood out for its lyricism, and her performances were enhanced by her ability to play multiple instruments including piano, banjo, acoustic and electric guitar, and the challenging 12-string guitar.\n\nTaylor helped create the marketing plan for the album which included a grassroots promotional approach using MySpace, where rising musicians were finding their young audiences at the time. And, included her own drawings in the album‚Äôs packaging along with her very first ‚Äúeaster eggs‚Äù of hiding messages in the liners notes, which we‚Äôve paid homage to in our own descriptions here in the Chair-a‚Äôs Tour.\n\nCreate Your Own Debut-Inspired Chair\n\nI remember hearing Taylor‚Äôs voice the first time on the radio with Tim McGraw and thinking how different she was from other singers at the time. My daughters and I loved her music. We listened on the way to school each morning.\n\nI designed this chair with the ‚Äúcountry music‚Äù flair I remember from Taylor‚Äôs first album. I chose a wood frame petite chair and sanded it down to give it a rustic look. Then, I selected a whimsical jean material for the top of the chair, embellished with ombre butterflies in blue and green across the backside using a stencil. Finally, the seat is covered with a Mongolian pelt that resembles Taylor‚Äôs curly hair at the beginning of her career. I love this little chair and see it as her very first beginnings.\n\nGrab my Spotify Playlist for this release\n\nI‚Äôll be adding my favorite songs with each new chair reveal! with each new chair reveal!\n\nTim McGraw\n\nI remember hearing this song for the first time driving my girls to school in the morning. I loved it and thought she had a great voice and was such a different artist.\n\nPicture to Burn\n\nI love this song because it reminds me of dating when I was a teen. Oh, how I felt those words with a few of my exes!\n\nTeardrops On My Guitar\n\nWho doesn‚Äôt remember the days when having a crush on someone who had no clue? But looking back now, I‚Äôm glad none of those relationships worked out for me.\n\nA Place in this World\n\nI remember those days trying to figure out where I belong and where I fit in. Wait, I‚Äôm still trying to figure that out!\n\nShould‚Äôve Said No\n\nI had a few situations like this when I was young. I felt the same way and cut them off immediately. It was too bad for them, but it was good for me!\n\nOur Song\n\nAnother classic song that I remember vividly and it‚Äôs my favorite on this debut album. Love the spunk and the honesty of needing a song to define a relationship. Love the banjo in it too!\n\nInvisible\n\nOh, the days of caring for someone who loves someone else. And knowing that I would have been much better for that person too. In the end, though, it worked out for my best. I trust fate in that way."
