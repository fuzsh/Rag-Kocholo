        "text": "MEGADETH played the song \"Kick The Chair\" live for the first time since 2009 this past Monday night (June 24) at Turbinenhalle in Oberhausen, Germany. Fan-filmed video of the performance can be seen below.\n\n\"Kick The Chair\" appeared on MEGADETH's tenth studio album, \"The System Has Failed\", which came out in September 2004. The LP was MEGADETH's first to be released after frontman Dave Mustaine recovered from his arm injury sustained in 2002. It was also the first MEGADETH studio album to not include original bassist David Ellefson.\n\nIn addition to Mustaine, \"The System Has Failed\" featured former MEGADETH member Chris Poland (guitar),who previously performed on \"Killing Is My Business... And Business Is Good!\" (1985) and \"Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?\" (1986),as well as session drummer Vinnie Colaiuta and bassist Jimmie Lee Sloas.\n\nMEGADETH recently announced a North American tour \"Destroy All Enemies\", produced by Live Nation. Support on the 33-city trek, which includes stops in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Boston and St. Louis, will come from MUDVAYNE and ALL THAT REMAINS. The tour begins in Rogers, Arkansas on August 2 and runs throughout the month before wrapping in Nashville, Tennessee on September 28.\n\nFinnish guitarist Teemu M채ntysaari joined MEGADETH last September after the band's longtime axeman Kiko Loureiro, announced earlier that month that he would sit out the next leg of MEGADETH's \"Crush The World\" tour in order to stay home with his children back in Finland. It was later revealed that M채ntysaari would continue to play guitar for MEGADETH for the foreseeable future, with Loureiro seemingly having no plans to return.\n\nThe 37-year-old M채ntysaari was born in Tampere, Finland and began playing guitar at the age of 12. In 2004, he joined the band WINTERSUN. He has also been a member of SMACKBOUND since 2015.\n\nMEGADETH played its first concert with M채ntysaari on September 6, 2023 at Revel in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n\nLoureiro officially joined MEGADETH in April 2015, about five months after Chris Broderick's exit from the group.\n\nSince its inception in 1983, MEGADETH has ascended from its raw thrash metal roots to become an unstoppable force in the heavy metal world. With founder Dave Mustaine at the helm, MEGADETH's journey has been marked by a penchant for pushing the boundaries of speed, technicality, and complexity in their music. Their groundbreaking album \"Rust In Peace\", released in 1990, is frequently cited as a seminal work in the thrash metal genre. Along with the critically acclaimed \"Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?\", it cemented MEGADETH's place in the annals of metal history."
