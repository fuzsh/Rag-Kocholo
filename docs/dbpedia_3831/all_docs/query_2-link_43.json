He succeeds Pablo Hernández de Cos, Governor of the Bank of Spain, who has chaired the Committee since March 2019.\n\nAs set out in the Committee's Charter, the Chair is appointed for a term of three years that can be renewed once.\n\nNote to editors:\n\nThe Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks and provides a forum for cooperation on banking supervisory matters. Its mandate is to strengthen the regulation, supervision and practices of banks worldwide with the purpose of enhancing financial stability. The Committee reports to the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision and seeks its endorsement for major decisions. The Committee has no formal supranational authority, and its decisions have no legal force. Rather, the Committee relies on its members' commitments to achieve its mandate. The Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision is chaired by Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada."
