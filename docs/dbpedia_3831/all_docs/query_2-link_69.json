Collectively the sound bursts with the energy of a heavy rock gig – a rampant ruckus of fiddles, banjos, accordions and drums – yet remains acoustic at heart.\n\nThe group’s hotly anticipated third album, Orkney Monster was released to wide acclaim in late 2020, following similarly high praise for their debut Huinka (2008) and sophomore release The Road to Hammer Junkie (2013).\n\nPlease note this is a standing event.\n\nThis event will last approximately 75 minutes, without an interval.\n\nReviews\n\n‘… carnivorous energy allied to an endearing sense of merriment … this is a compelling and triumphant release which places The Chair firmly at the vanguard of where-it’s-at.’ The Living Tradition\n\nOrkney Folk Festival"
