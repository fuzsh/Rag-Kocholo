It will be an ongoing one, and one that will never be completed, as will be explained further down.\n\nA lot is made of Quo's number of appearances on Top of the Pops. My goal is to chronical every appearance and, where available, archive the best possible copy of each and every performance, playback et al.\n\nSome of this stuff is lost to the ages. Some is in archives and has rarely, if ever, been seen since first broadcast. Some is available widely in good quality, and other bits less so. With BBC4 going through repeating old episodes, in time perhaps better quality versions of some later material may turn up, but for now there is no one good comprehensive source.\n\nThis has also taken a good detail of research and patience, but my apologies for any errors/anomalies, or for anything missed. I hope that if I can even give people a chance to see one or two bits they hadn't previously, or learn something of Quo's true TOTP history, then I can be happy and proud of my work.\n\nAnyway, here goes. First up, I'm going to start with simply a list (as far as I can manage in one sitting) and no HQ links just now. I will provide YouTube videos where possible, but my aim is to archive these in the best quality available; probably both on YouTube and as downloadables. Please have patience.\n\nDate: 08/02/1968\n\nSong: Pictures Of Matchstick Men\n\nPresenter: Pete Murray and Stuart Henry\n\nChart Position: 15\n\nMisc: WIPED. Quo's first performance, a week before the one we all have seen countless times. There's a chance that the recording from the following week is a repeat of this one, but I can't confirm that.\n\nLink: WIPED\n\nDate: 15/02/1968\n\nSong: Pictures Of Matchstick Men\n\nChart Position: 10\n\nPresenter: Jimmy Saville and Dave Cash\n\nMisc: We've all seen this one. The earliest surviving regular episode of the series out there. Only one from Christmas '67 survives from before that as a whole show. There's a chance that the recording from the previous week is repeated here, but I can't confirm this.\n\nLink: Youtube\n\nDate: 01/08/1968\n\nSong: Ice In The Sun\n\nChart Position: NEW\n\nPresenter: Jimmy Saville\n\nMisc: Long-lost to history and wiping. Presumably an in studio performance as a new release, based on the success of POMM. Interestingly, #1 at the time was \"Mony Mony\" by Tommy James and the Shondells; that of course Quo would go on to cover over 30 years later.\n\nLink: WIPED\n\nDate: 19/09/1968\n\nSong: Ice In The Sun\n\nChart Position: 15\n\nPresenter: Jimmy Saville\n\nMisc: Another wiped one. This time, the show features Canned Heat with \"On The Road Again\". The Beatles top the charts with Revolution.\n\nLink: WIPED\n\nDate: 10/10/1968\n\nSong: Ice In The Sun\n\nChart Position: 13\n\nPresenter: Alan Freeman\n\nMisc: Again missing. Nothing of particular note to report from this show. Mary Hopkins at number one.\n\nLink: WIPED\n\nDate: 22/05/1969\n\nSong: Are You Growing Tired Of My Love?\n\nChart Position: NEW\n\nPresenter: Tony Blackburn\n\nMisc: Who even knew they performed this on TOTP? Beatles top with \"Get Back\".\n\nLink: WIPED\n\nDate: 28/05/1970\n\nSong: Down The Dustpipe\n\nChart Position: 30\n\nPresenter: Tony Blackburn\n\nMisc: Crowd dancing to a playback; band not in the studio for this one. England football team top the charts; a small clip of them performing \"Back Home\" does survive, but not from this show.\n\nLink: WIPED\n\nDate: 11/06/1970\n\nSong: Down The Dustpipe\n\nChart Position: 21\n\nPresenter: Tony Blackburn\n\nMisc: Band back in the TOTP studio for this one. A couple of songs from this show exist in the archive, but probably from repeats in other episodes. Mungo Jerry at #1.\n\nLink: WIPED\n\nDate: 22/10/1970\n\nSong: In My Chair\n\nChart Position: NEW\n\nPresenter: Jimmy Saville\n\nMisc: This one turned up in perfect quality a couple of years back, having been used as an insert in the Swiss/German show Hits-a-Gogo. Only this and Black Sabbath's \"Paranoid\" exist from this show. Can't find an HD copy at the moment.\n\nLink: Youtube\n\nDate: 19/11/1970\n\nSong: In My Chair\n\nChart Position: 24\n\nPresenter: Jimmy Saville\n\nMisc: Apparantly a repeat of the previous performance, but could have been an alternative performance\n\nLink: Wiped?\n\nDate: 07/01/1971\n\nSong: In My Chair\n\nChart Position: 27\n\nPresenter: Tony Blackburn\n\nMisc: Missing. Track played over crowd dancing and end credits\n\nLink: WIPED\n\nDate: 04/01/1973\n\nSong: Paper Plane\n\nChart Position: NEW\n\nPresenter: Jimmy Saville\n\nMisc: Missing. Same show that the Bowie \"Jean Genie\" performance that surfaced a few years ago came from. This however does exist in a private collection that is stuck a seemingly endless limbo. No-one has publicly seen the tape, which is one of a number from a home recording collection, so this may never be seen even though it does exist.\n\nLink: WIPED\n\nDate: 18/01/1973\n\nSong: Paper Plane\n\nChart Position: 27\n\nPresenter: Tony Blackburn\n\nMisc: Missing. Quo, The Who, Sweet and Free all on the same show; of course the BBC would wipe it. Quo performance survives on b/w 405-line computer tape, recovered in 2019. Presenter link may also survive.\n\nLink: WIPED\n\nDate: 01/02/1973\n\nSong: Paper Plane\n\nChart Position: 11\n\nPresenter: Noel Edmunds\n\nMisc: Song played over chart rundown.

This episode partially survives in a slightly ropey b/w recording. Quo are one of the bands on this footage. Pan's People performance exists in colour.\n\nLink: Youtube\n\nDate: 27/09/1973\n\nSong: Caroline\n\nChart Position: 17\n\nPresenter: Noel Edmunds\n\nMisc: Whole episode survives in top quality.\n\nLink: Youtube (whole episode; they're the first performance)\n\nDate: 11/10/1973\n\nSong: Caroline\n\nChart Position: 9\n\nPresenter: Kenny Everett\n\nMisc: Listed as a repeat performance but utilising different camera shots or parts of a different take, perhaps. Whole episode survives in top quality, apparantly also including outtakes. Only Kenny episode to survive in full and broadcast quality, I believe.\n\nLink: Youtube (whole episode; Quo at about 6:50)\n\nDate: 18/10/1973\n\nSong: Caroline\n\nChart Position: 8\n\nPresenter: Tony Blackburn\n\nMisc: Wiped.

From my research so far, I'm of the opinion that one Down Down performance was pre-recorded for this show, then repeated on 02/01/75.\n\nLink: Wiped?\n\nDate: 02/01/1975\n\nSong: Down Down\n\nPresenter: Jimmy Saville\n\nChart Position: 10\n\nMisc: This epsiode survives. Not listed as such in most sources but a pre-recorded insert (with no audience) possibly for the previous broadcast. No HD copy on Youtube that I can see, for now.\n\nLink: Youtube\n\nDate: 16/01/1975\n\nSong: Down Down\n\nPresenter: Noel Edmunds\n\nChart Position: 1\n\nMisc: Pan's People dancing to Quo at number one! This episode is wiped but the Quo track survives. I've been unable to track it down so far though and don't believe it's circulating publicly, but it has been screened at private events. Apparently survives from a compilation made for a member of the troupe by the BBC.\n\nLink: NOT WIPED\n\nPOSSIBLE LOST APPEARANCE OF \"ROLL OVER LAY DOWN\"\n\nA few forum members have recalled hearing a playback of ROLD, possibly over the end credits of an episode. As no episodes from May/June '75 exist in their entirity this is near impossible to prove - or rule out. The likely candidate to me would be 22/05/75 as there is no listed playout track on the surviving records. The track was at 16 in the charts (up from 37 the previous week) at this point, and as a follow up to a number one, would have been likely featured. Possibly just the audio (partially) played over the crowd and titles.\n\nDate: 23/12/1975\n\nSong: Down Down\n\nPresenter: Jimmy Saville and Dave Lee Travis\n\nChart Position: N/A\n\nMisc: Repeat of the December/January performance.

POMM is given another repeat, albeit again as a 15 second clip in a compilation, sandwiched between Joe Cocker and The Move - by this point (and indeed much earlier) the BBC had minimal holdings left of early material - Quo just happened to be on one of the few 60s episodes that survived. Even by the 1973 compilation where this was also used, there wasn't much else there from the 1960s. A lot of the other clips used survived as \"orphans\" outside of whole episodes.\n\nLink: Youtube\n\nDate: 08/09/1983\n\nSong: Ol' Rag Blues\n\nPresenter: Andy Peebles and Peter Powell\n\nChart Position: 24\n\nMisc: Another single, another studio appearance\n\nLink: Youtube\n\nDate: 22/09/1983\n\nSong: Ol' Rag Blues\n\nPresenter: Simon Bates and Mike Read\n\nChart Position: 9\n\nMisc: Promo video\n\nLink: Youtube (Continuity only)\n\nDate: 03/11/1983\n\nSong: A Mess Of Blues\n\nPresenter: Peter Powell and Mike Read\n\nChart Position: 24\n\nMisc: Again in the studio for a new single.
