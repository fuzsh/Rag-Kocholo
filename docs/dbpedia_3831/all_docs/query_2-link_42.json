        "text": "High Chair: Our High Chair is designed to be used when your infant is able to sit upright unassisted, which is often around 6 months and older. Always consult your pediatrician if youâ€™re not sure if your little one is ready to start! The High Chair Baby Seat has a max weight of 35 lbs.\n\nChild Chair: Child Chair mode is designed to be used when your kiddo can confidently climb in and out of the Chair on their own. This often happens around 3 years and older but can vary by child. Always consult your pediatrician if youâ€™re not sure if your little one is ready to transition! The Child Chair has a max weight of 150 lbs.\n\nWeâ€™re so glad you asked ðŸ™‚. First off, in designing our High Chairâ€™s seat, we took a minimalist approach, avoiding the use of fabrics and opting for simple curved shapes so we could remove every possible crevice (which is often where leftover food builds up over time). We also chose to include an extra layer of protection with a tray liner that detaches easily from the tray and can be tossed in the dishwasher. And last, but certainly not least, our straps! Most high chairs use nylon straps, which food tends to stick to, no matter how much you try to clean them. So we spent years designing new, silicone-coated straps that actually wipe clean, and are also dishwasher-safe (and youâ€™ll only find these straps on our High Chair!)."
