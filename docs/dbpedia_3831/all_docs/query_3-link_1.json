To ensure the most comfortable posture possible, two of these factors have to be adjustable.\n\nIf you can afford to do nothing else, a fully adjustable chair is a \"must\". The other, and perhaps the most preferable option, would be a fully adjustable desk. However the price of such a desk may not make this option practical. Another effective (and cheaper) option is to use an adjustable chair and footrest to secure postural comfort.\n\nWhat should I consider when selecting a chair?\n\nBack to top\n\nA basic rule of ergonomics is that there is no such thing as an \"average\" person. However, providing a chair specifically designed for each individual is not practical. The only solution is to provide workers with fully adjustable chairs that can accommodate a maximum range of people (typically around 90 percent of the population; workers falling in the ranges of 5% of the shortest and the tallest will need custom-made chairs).\n\nChoose a chair with:\n\nControls that are easy to operate from sitting position.\n\nA seat that adjusts for both height and tilt.\n\nA seat that does not put pressure the back of thighs or knees.\n\nA seat with a front edge that curves towards the floor.\n\nBreathable, non-slippery fabric on the seat.\n\nA backrest shaped to support the lower back.\n\nA stable five-point base.\n\nWheels or casters suitable for the type of flooring.\n\nA swivel mechanism.\n\nArmrests that can be adjusted to the elbow height when your upper arms are hanging down and your forearms are at about a 90 degree angle to the upper arms.\n\nArmrests that do not interfere with free movements within the workstation.\n\nYou may also wish to check the OSH Answers document The Ergonomic Chair for more details on how to purchase a chair.\n\nWhat is so controversial about armrests?\n\nBack to top\n\nArmrests were traditionally not recommended because they can prevent the users from getting close enough to the desk. However, armrests that extend 25 cm (10 inches), or less, from the back of seat may be appropriate. People using chairs fitted with these shorter armrests can move their chairs closer to their workstations. The armrests gives them a place to rest their arms which, in turn, takes some of the load off their shoulders and neck.\n\nHow do I adjust a chair for my height?\n\nBack to top\n\nStand in front of the chair. Adjust the height so the highest point of the seat, (when in the horizontal position), is just below the knee cap.\n\nSit on the chair and keep your feet flat on the floor.\n\nCheck that the clearance between the front edge of the seat and the lower part of the legs (your calves) fits a clenched fist (about 5 cm or 2 inches).\n\nAdjust the back rest forwards and backwards as well as up and down so that it fits the hollow in your lower back.\n\nSit upright with your arms hanging loosely by your sides. Bend your elbows at about a right angle (90 degrees) and adjust the armrest(s) height until they barely touch the undersides of the elbows.\n\nRemove the armrests from the chair if this level can not be achieved or if armrests, in their lowest adjustment, elevate your elbows even slightly.\n\nTilt the seat itself forwards or backwards if you prefer.\n\nDifferent office tasks require different equipment, accessories and layouts.\n\nNonetheless, the chair and its adjustment remain constant for the majority of setups in a typical office environment.\n\nWhat adjustments should I make if the workstation (desk) is at a fixed height?\n\nBack to top\n\nOnce your chair is properly adjusted for your height, check if you can sit at the workstation comfortably with your legs underneath.\n\nIf you cannot fit your legs under the workstation or there is not enough space to move them freely, your workstation is too low for you and you should not use such a workstation on a regular basis!\n\nIf you can sit comfortably but need to elevate your arms in order to place them over the work surface, your workstation is too high. Adjust the chair height so your elbows are about the same height as the work surface. Use a footrest if you cannot place your feet flat on the floor.\n\nThe footrest should be adjustable and support both feet. Keep feet flat and firm on the footrest.\n\nFact sheet confirmed current: 2020-01-17\n\nFact sheet last revised: 2014-03-10"
