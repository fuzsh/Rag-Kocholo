        "text": "Around the age of 15, a copy of the late Dr Herbert Benson MD’s book, The Relaxation Response, found its way onto my bookshelf.\n\nThe pioneering work of Dr Benson and his colleagues committed to exploring mind-body approaches to counter the stress response with Tibetan refugees, paved the way to build an evidence base in clinical research for what we know today as the growing fields of traumatic stress studies and neuroscience.\n\nBenson’s book first published in 1975 during the ensuing cultural upheaval resulting from the Vietnam War, went on to become an instant international bestseller in the US and was subsequently reprinted on the 25th anniversary of its publication in 2000.\n\nAt that time it was considered scientific heresy for a Harvard researcher and physician to hypothesise that mind-body approaches could help reduce the harmful effects of stress that contribute to a variety of health problems such as hypertension and heart disease.\n\nHaving followed my own path into this field and since that first edition came into my possession along with the pioneering work of stress researchers such as Jon Kabat-Zinn PhD et al., I am equally inspired today to share an interview I conducted with Australia’s foremost expert in the field of traumatic stress, Prof. Zachary Steel, clinical researcher at the School of Psychiatry, UNSW Health & Medicine.\n\nDr Steel holds the St John of God Chair of Trauma and Mental Health, a partnership between Richmond Hospital, the School of Psychiatry UNSW and the Black Dog Institute. He heads a program of clinical research into the impact of trauma on veterans, first responders, refugees, asylum seekers and civilian populations.\n\nI am grateful for Zachary’s time and this memorable conversation at the frontiers of what looks and feels like the next paradigm shift in our field.\n\nThe article, “Challenging the Status Quo: Advancing Trauma Recovery”, featured in the latest issue of Refugee Transitions, concluded 5+ years of service working within the Forum of Australian Services for Survivors of Torture & Trauma (FASSTT).\n\nThe journey continues."
