        "text": "It has been announced that the multi-platinum artist Uncle Kracker will be releasing his breezy new single, “Beach Chair,” on May 24th via Sturgeon General Records.\n\nFor over two decades now, Uncle Kracker has blended country, pop, and rock with a dash of hip-hop flair that he grew up on, and now he is adding another song to his hit-filled discography. Coming just in time for summer, the island-flavored “Beach Chair” is meant for kicking back and lounging by the water.\n\n“Beach Chair” finds him at his most chill, mellow and laid-back: “Somewhere there’s a beach chair in the warm air/And a cold beer with my name on it,” he sings, and you’re instantly transported right beside him to a carefree day by the sand and waves.\n\nWritten by Uncle Kracker (Matthew Shafer), Joe Benke and Greg Schleicher, “Beach Chair” is the latest in a long history of feel-good tunes the acclaimed singer has offered up over the years. Produced by Josh Bright, the release comes at a meteoric time in Uncle Kracker’s career as he has been playing to stadium-filled crowds on Kenny Chesney’s “SUN GOES DOWN 2024 TOUR.”\n\nPre-save “Beach Chair” here.\n\nStarting with his solo debut, 2000’s Double Wide, and its PLATINUM single “Follow Me,” which hit No. 1 in four countries, Uncle Kracker has been on a quest to deliver the musical goods at every turn. In 2004, Uncle Kracker’s 2X PLATINUM “When the Sun Goes Down” [with Kenny Chesney] vaulted to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks Chart. He’s also released such classics as his lauded cover of Dobie Gray’s “Drift Away,” which logged 28 consecutive weeks at No. 1 on Adult Contemporary Radio. Following his most recent LP, 2012’s Country album Midnight Special, Uncle Kracker has delivered singles such as “Endlessly,” “Floatin’” and “No Time To Be Sober.”\n\nNever taking his foot off the gas, Uncle Kracker has released a string of sweet new songs in recent times, including “Sweet 16,” “Reason To Drink” and “Cruising Altitude.” A brand-new Uncle Kracker album is expected to be released later this year."
