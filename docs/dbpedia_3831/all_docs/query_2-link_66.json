        "text": "The Chair is billed as a comedy drama, with the two genres allowing for both an exploration of social issues surrounding race and gender, as well as a spectacular pratfall from time-to-time – such as in the opening clip below:\n\nSpeaking to USAToday, Oh said she felt pressure to \"hit that comedy beat\", while describing the above scene as a \"beautiful, perfect metaphor\" for Professor Kim's unenviable position.\n\nIndustry veterans Holland Taylor and Bob Balaban are among The Chair cast, sharing the screen with promising rising stars including Nana Mensah and Mallory Low.\n\nMore like this\n\nIf you're keen to find out whether the show is worth your time, check out our The Chair review – or, scroll on for everything else you need to know about the Netflix series.\n\nAll six episodes of The Chair will be available to binge watch on Netflix from Friday 20th August 2021.\n\nThe series had initially been scheduled for one week later, as seen in the date announcement tweet below, but was later brought forward in a move that should be pleasing to Sandra Oh fans.\n\nAlongside the original release date, the streaming service also shared a mocked-up student newspaper clipping announcing the appointment of Oh's character Professor Ji-Yoon Kim as head of the English department.\n\nThe Chair cast\n\nSandra Oh leads Netflix's The Chair cast of as Professor Ji-Yoon Kim, the eponymous head of Pembroke's struggling English department, tasked with revitalising its fading fortunes.\n\nThat won't be easy with budget cuts, uncooperative faculty members and a heated scandal to contend with, so expect plenty of stressful moments as Professor Kim settles into the job.\n\nEverly Carganilla (Netflix's Yes Day) stars as Ji-Yoon’s precocious young daughter, Ju-Hee ‘Ju Ju’ Kim, with Ji Yong Lee as her elderly father, Habi.\n\nJay Duplass (Transparent, Search Party) co-stars as Professor Bill Dobson, an academic who becomes a figure of great controversy among students after performing an offensive gesture in one of his lectures.\n\nOther series regulars include Nana Mensah (Bonding, New Amsterdam), as Yasmin ‘Yaz’ McKay, a popular, progressive English professor and close colleague of Oh’s Ji-Yoon.\n\nMeanwhile, Holland Taylor (Hollywood) plays Professor Joan Hambling, a witty, straight talking member of the English department who is Ji-Yoon’s friend and confidant.\n\nBob Balaban (The Politician, The French Dispatch) portrays Elliot Rentz, a distinguished English professor who is resistant to constrictive criticism despite plummeting student enrolment.\n\nRounding out the Pembroke staff are David Morse (The Good Lord Bird) as Dean Paul Larson and Ron Crawford (Dickinson) as old school Professor John McHale, who is on the brink of retirement.\n\nThe supporting cast also includes Mallory Low (DC Superhero Girls) as PhD researcher Lilah, Ella Rubin (Gossip Girl) as undergrad student Dafna and Bob Stephenson (Top Gun: Maverick) as campus technician, Horatio.\n\nFor the latest news and expert tips on getting the best deals this year, take a look at our Black Friday 2021 and Cyber Monday 2021 guides.\n\nThe Chair plot\n\nThe Chair has been described as a “dramedy” that will focus on the head of an English Department at a prestigious university, which is facing a decline in student interest.\n\nThe show will be made up of six half-hour episodes and looks to explore the difficulties faced by women and people of colour in the often traditional world of academia.\n\nThe show is the first TV series written and produced by Amanda Peet, who is better known for her acting work in Brockmire and 2012.\n\nHer husband, David Benioff, will also be executive producing, along with his working partner D.B. Weiss, with the two best known for their former position as joint showrunners on HBO's Game of Thrones.\n\nProduced by Benioff and Weiss’s company Bighead Littlehead, The Chair is the first series made as part of their exclusive multi-year Netflix deal. They are also busy working on Netflix’s upcoming Metal Lords and Three-Body Problem.\n\nThe Chair trailer\n\nNetflix released the first full trailer for The Chair in July 2021, which you can watch below.\n\nThe following month, the streamer shared a featurette about the show which includes interviews with star and executive producer Sandra Oh, as well as showrunner Amanda Peet."
