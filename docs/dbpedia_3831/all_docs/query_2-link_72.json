        "text": "It was February 25, 1985, when Tears for Fears released Songs from the Big Chair. Packed with hits including Hot 100 chart-toppers \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" and \"Shout,\" it was the album that made Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith into worldwide superstars.\n\nToday, the band has revealed a pair of special releases to celebrate the landmark album. On March 13, Tears for Fears will issue a limited edition vinyl picture disc of the LP. It will mark the first time SFTBC has ever been pressed on a picture disc.\n\nRELATED: November 1984: Tears for Fears Hit #1 in the US with \"Shout\"\n\nOn the same March 13 date, Tears for Fears will also re-release the out of print and Super Deluxe 4XCD/2XDVD box set version of Songs from the Big Chair. Among the extras include \"a multitude of remixes, live tracks, BBC sessions, B-sides, previously unreleased tracks and 5.1 surround sound and stereo mixes of the album mixed by four-time Grammy nominee, Steven Wilson,\" according to the official press statement. See a complete breakdown of the contents below.\n\n\"Pop music was still a growth industry. It hadn't sort of stagnated, stalled, diversified into streaming like it is nowadays,\" Roland Orzabal remembered of 1985 in the press release. \"We were young, we were both good-looking and we had the right music. As we move further and further from that decade and you keep hearing 'Everybody Wants To Rule The World,' in various forms I do think it is an era-defining album.\"\n\nRELATED: January 1983: Tears for Fears Release \"Change\"\n\n\"You would never normally get three songs that strong in an album,\" added Curt Smith. \"But balance that out with tracks like 'Listen,' 'The Working Hour;' all those things that give it air and give it time to breathe I think is what makes it something more than just the sum of its parts. I think the album had a lot more depth than a lot of those other albums of that time. And albums of more depth tend to stick around longer.\"\n\nSONGS FROM THE BIG CHAIR – SUPER DELUXE EDITION – 4CD/2DVD\n\nDISC ONE\n\nSongs from The Big Chair\n\nShout\n\nThe Working Hour\n\nEverybody Wants to Rule the World\n\nMothers Talk\n\nI Believe\n\nBroken\n\nHead Over Heels\n\nListen\n\nB-Sides\n\nThe Big Chair\n\nEmpire Building\n\nThe Marauders\n\nBroken Revisited\n\nThe Conflict\n\nThe Working Hour (Piano Version)\n\nPharaohs\n\nWhen in Love with A Blind Man\n\nSea Song\n\nDISC TWO\n\n\"Edited Songs\": 7\" Versions\n\nThe Way You Are (7\" version)\n\nMothers Talk (Short Version)\n\nShout (Edit)\n\nEverybody Wants to Rule the World (Single version)\n\nHead Over Heels (Dave Bascombe 7\" version)\n\nI Believe (A Soulful Re- Recording)\n\nEverybody Wants To Run The World\n\nInternational 7\" Versions\n\nThe Way You Are (Edit)\n\nMothers Talk (US Remix)\n\nShout (US Single Version)\n\nEverybody Wants to Run the World (Running Version)\n\nHead Over Heels (Hughes 7\" Edit aka Radio Mix)\n\nMothers Talk (Video version)\n\nListen (Clean intro)\n\nInterview with Curt and Roland\n\nDISC THREE\n\nRemixed Songs\": 12\" Versions, Dubs and more\n\nThe Way You Are (Extended version)\n\nMothers Talk (Extended version)\n\nShout (Extended remix)\n\nEverybody Wants to Rule the World (Extended version)\n\nBroken / Head Over Heels / Broken (Preacher Mix)\n\nMothers Talk (Beat Of The Drum Mix)\n\nShout (US remix)\n\nEverybody Wants to Rule the World (Urban mix)\n\nMothers Talk (US remix alternate)\n\nShout (Dub)\n\nEverybody Wants to Rule the World (Instrumental)\n\nShout (Acapella)\n\nDISC FOUR\n\n\"Unreleased Songs\": Promos, Demos & Live tracks\n\nAt The BBC\n\nHead Over Heels (Radio 1 Richard Skinner Session)\n\nThe Working Hour (Radio 1 Richard Skinner Session)\n\nBroken (Radio 1 Richard Skinner Session)\n\nLive at Massey Hall\n\nMothers Talk\n\nBroken/Head Over Heels\n\nMemories Fade\n\nThe Working Hour\n\nEverybody Wants to Rule the World\n\nShout\n\nEarly Mixes\n\nMothers Talk (Early mix)\n\nThe Way You Are (Early mix)\n\nBroken (Early mix)\n\nShout (Early mix)\n\nEverybody Wants to Rule the World (alt 7\" with brass)\n\nDISC 5 DVD AUDIO\n\nSteven Wilson 5.1 Mix\n\nShout\n\nThe Working Hour\n\nEverybody Wants to Rule the World\n\nMothers Talk\n\nI Believe\n\nBroken\n\nHead Over Heels\n\nListen\n\nSteven Wilson Stereo Mix\n\nShout\n\nThe Working Hour\n\nEverybody Wants to Rule the World\n\nMothers Talk\n\nI Believe\n\nBroken\n\nHead Over Heels\n\nListen\n\nDISC 6 – DVD VIDEO\n\nScenes From The Big Chair (985 documentary) (1hr 14 mins)\n\nInterview with producer Chris Hughes (2005) (35 mins)\n\nMusic Videos\n\nThe Way You Are (Music video)\n\nMothers Talk (Music video)\n\nMothers Talk (alternative UK video)\n\nShout (Music video)\n\nEverybody Wants to Rule The World (Music video)\n\nHead Over Heels (Music video)\n\nI Believe (Music video)\n\nMothers Talk (US version)\n\nEverybody Wants to Run the World (Music video)\n\nTears for Fears at the BBC\n\nThe Way You Are (Top Of The Pops)\n\nMothers Talk (Top Of The Pops)\n\nMothers Talk (Top Of The Pops)\n\nShout (Top Of The Pops)\n\nEverybody Wants to Rule the World (Wogan)\n\nEverybody Wants to Rule the World (Top Of The Pops)\n\nEverybody Wants to Rule the World (Top Of The Pops)\n\nThe Working Hour (Wogan)\n\nSONGS FROM THE BIG CHAIR – LIMITED EDITION PICTURE DISC\n\nSIDE ONE\n\nShout\n\nThe Working Hour\n\nEverybody Wants to Rule the World\n\nMothers Talk"
