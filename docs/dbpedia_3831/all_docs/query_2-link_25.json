        "text": "Released in 1961, the Eames Time Life Desk Chair was an adaptation of the original Lobby Chair design, smaller in width, higher in height and more upright, perfect for use as a professional desk or work chair. With its soft rounded cushioning, quality upholstery and availability on either castors or floor glides, the Time Life Desk Chair was an immediate success and luxurious choice.\n\nThe Time Life Chairs have (and often still are) also been known by the names of 'Lobby Chair' and in later years the 'Eames Executive Chair'. The original design was a specially commissioned chair for the Lobby (hence the name) of the Time Life building in Manhattan, New York. This design was essentially a Lounger with a laid back position and comfortable, inviting feel. In no time at all a commercial version of this Time Life Lounger had been released in 1960 and its success prompted the reworking of the design into this, the Work Desk Chair. The designs for the Time Life Building project turned out to be very fruitful and the Walnut Stools were another commercial success following it.\n\nThe Eames Time Life Desk Chair (model 3474) was 2 inches narrower than it's Lounge sister chair and with a more upright angled back. It was also the first chair released on the Universal Base which carried the possibility of fitting with either floor glides or castors. It is easy to see why it got the reputation of an 'executive' chair with its inviting leather upholstery and beautiful polished aluminum frame. As standard the chair was fitted with tilt, swivel and height adjustment.\n\nThe Desk Chair went through some developments over the years and is still in production to this day."
