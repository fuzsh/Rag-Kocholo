I was a young lad when RAOTW was released played the album loads.\n\nPost by mortified on\n\nJust joining in, I've always preferred the original version of Can't Give You More.\n\nIn fact, I can't think of any track that has been improved by re-recording it and never really saw the point. Aquostic apart that is. I suppose Running All Over The World took the track up a notch but it was never best first time round.

But it's taken almost 30 years\n\nI do find myself scrolling through the B sides and rarities quite often. SKTM always gets an airing, I don't know what pulls me towards it, I know I usually find myself singing the chorus for the rest of the day\n\nPost by craydarr on\n\nIt's funny because Lonely Night has become one of my go to songs as well. I just love the whole laid back groove of the thing. More so now than I did in 1974!\n\nI also always turn to Breaking Away and Coming And Going. And Mrs Mortified has made me appreciate Accident Prone more.

If we are on Backbone tracks then there’s Better Take Care and Waiting For A Woman which I play semi regularly.\n\nI do love Warning Shot but hardly ever play it. Note to self 🤔\n\nPost by mortified on\n\nThe revisiting of B-sides is something I might do at some point.\n\nThe vast majority, especially during the Thirsty Work period, I never gave much attention once I'd played them once or twice.

Still do.\n\nMost of the B-sides back then were OK. This one drives along nicely. In fact, if I'm honest, the B-sides tended to be better than most of what ended up on the albums, especially Ain't Complaining.\n\nA Parfitt/Rossi composition which became an increasing rarity and wasn't that common even back then.\n\nPost by Isaac Ryan on\n\nJust given Lean Machine a spin, thoughts?\n\nI haven’t heard it for a while but I loved it when it came out. Darn it, I’m going to have to dig it out now and have a listen.\n\nHow about “The reason for goodbye” ?\n\nPost by craydarr on\n\nI haven’t heard it for a while but I loved it when it came out.
