        "text": "Of course, there are certain laws and regulations that boards must follow. This varies widely based on the type of board and industry – among other factors. However, there are plenty of other conventions of corporate governance that aren’t required. In fact, many conventions are upheld for no good reason. Some can even be detrimental.\n\nAs Matt said, “Most of the conventions of corporate governance are optional, and many of them do nothing to help us make good decisions.”\n\nOne example Matt shared is the layout of the boardroom. When the audience was polled on the configuration of their board room, most answers fell within a few buckets:\n\nRectangle: 42%\n\nHorseshoe: 26%\n\nOval: 12%\n\nCircle: 5%\n\nAuditorium: 2%\n\nOther: 13%\n\nMany of these configurations are “roughly optimized for consuming information, making eye contact, being able to hear, and voting.” However, none of these are descriptions of effective decision-making.\n\nThere have been so many innovations in the way people work together – especially since the start of the pandemic. Organizations often deploy new strategies and solutions to facilitate good teamwork throughout the organization – with the exception of the boardroom.\n\n“It’s completely baffling to me,” Matt said. “The decisions that get made by the board are theoretically more important than the decisions made anywhere else.” Yet, boards rarely try out new solutions for collaboration.\n\nMatt shared the story of one board that was organizing its board retreat after things started reopening in Canada. Though they wanted to meet in-person, they were also concerned with social distancing. The solution was to provide each board member with a chair/desk combination (similar to what you’d see in school) with wheels – placed 6 feet apart.\n\n“They would instinctively change the layout of the room to optimize for the discussion they were having or the decisions that needed to be made,” explained Matt. “Not all conversations require the same conditions. The more we make the conditions the same, the more we should be concerned that we’re not trying new things. It doesn’t have to be this way.”"
