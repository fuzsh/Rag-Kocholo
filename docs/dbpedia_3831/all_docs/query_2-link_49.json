        "text": "Released to the market in 1968, the Eames Intermediate Chair was essentially a hybrid of other chair designs taking influence mainly from the Time Life Desk Chair, Alu Group Chairs and the work that had already gone into the Soft Pad Series (they were released in 1969).\n\nThe Eames Intermediate Desk Chair followed in the success of the Time Life Desk Chair and the High and Low Back Alu Group Chairs, which were aimed at the workplace and were growing steadily in commercial success. The Intermediate Chair very much had the style, look and feel of the Alu Group but with an increased comfort but perhaps without the overall size and footprint of the Time Life Chairs.\n\nThe Eames Intermediate Chair was released in 3 versions. There was the fixed height position chair with swivel available both with and without arms and there was a top of the range version with a torsion bar full tilt mechanism and manual height adjustment. The chair utilized the Universal Base and could therefore be fitted with either Nylon Foot Glides or castor wheels, depending on preference.\n\nHerman Miller made the Intermediate Chair available in 6 fabric options including Leather, Naugahyde and Hopsack and you could even provide your own fabric for upholstery.\n\nThe Soft Pad Series was released within a year of the Intermediate and the success of that range certainly kept sales of the Eames Intermediate Chair to a modest number and production of the Chair was discontinued into 1973"
