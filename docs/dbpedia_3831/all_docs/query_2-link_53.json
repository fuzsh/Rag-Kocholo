The video was nominated for eleven (11) MTV Video Music Awards and won three (3) of them. It was also awarded the Billboard Music Award for Best Pop/Rock Video and the Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form. At $7 million, it remains one of the most expensive music videos ever made. The stark, futuristic setting has become iconic and continues to influence music videos into the twenty-first century. Janet Jackson performed the song during a tribute to her recently deceased brother at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.",
