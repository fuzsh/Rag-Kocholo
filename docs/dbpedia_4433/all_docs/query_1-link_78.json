        "text": "Family-owned business Warm Glow Candle Company manufactures up to 15,000 handmade candles a day and sells them at its Centerville, Indiana store.\n\nBy Livability on May 29, 2024\n\nEvening Mocha, Banana Nut Bread, Salted Caramel Rum, Blueberry Cobbler and Lemon Pound Cake – sounds like the makings of a magical meal. And that might just be the case when you light one of these handmade candles on your dinner table. Warm Glow Candle Company owner Justin Burkhardt offers all kinds of fragrances in its full line of candles and accessories. And according to the National Candle Association, fragrance is one of the most important characteristics impacting candle purchases. “Your sense of smell is closely linked to memory and emotion,” Burkhardt says, “and it is our hope that our customers can relive these memories from the past with fondness.”\n\nWarm Glow Candle’s Legacy of Success\n\nBurkhardt bought the Centerville, Indiana company and store from original owners Alan and Jackie Carberry in October 2023 after a career in health care and philanthropy. “Warm Glow has been in business for more than 25 years,” Burkhardt says. “I’m looking to build off the successes and the memories that have been in place and to strengthen the core business and the relationships with our customers.”\n\nSome 2 billion candles are sold in any given year in the U.S. for home décor, ambiance and aromatherapy. They provide a simple way to offer warmth, hope, spirituality and relaxation, which are just a few of the reasons the market was projected to grow from $3.69 billion in 2022 to $3.90 billion in 2023.\n\nWhere to Buy Warm Glow Candles\n\nLocated in East Central Indiana, Warm Glow Candle manufactures its hand-dipped candles (up to 15,000 a day) in an 80,000-square-foot facility about 3 miles away from the firm’s 20,000-square-foot retail store – which you can’t miss due to the very large candle sculpture on the side of the shop. The store also offers custom floral arrangements and carries flameless fragrances, air fresheners, home accessories and gifts, yard art, kitchen items, rugs, wind chimes, chocolates, and Indiana-made wines and beer.\n\n“We also have our fall festival, our Christmas open house and our spring open house,” Burkhardt adds. “Our fall festival has over 100 craft vendors, and we have upwards of 20 food trucks and sales inside the store.” Burkhardt says that the Warm Glow exists for its customers and employees and continues to develop new fragrances and expand the product line. “We are very proud to not only be made in America but very proud to be a family-owned company. That’s important to me,” Burkhardt concludes."
