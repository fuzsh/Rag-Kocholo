        "text": "According to Climate Mapping for Resilience and Adaptation, Centerville is going to experience rising temperatures, and, because of that, an increased chance of drought (2022). The map estimates that by the late century (2070-2099), there will be 54-88.5 days with a maximum temperature over 90 degrees, compared to the early century (2015-2044) estimate of 32.8-36.4 days (Climate Mapping for Resilience and Adaptation, 2022). The average minimum daily temperature will increase by between 2.2 degrees and 5.8 degrees (Climate Mapping for Resilience and Adaptation, 2022). The classification for extreme heat is determined by the annual number of days that will be over 90 degrees (Climate Mapping for Resilience and Adaptation, 2022). The estimates for nearby Richmond are similar. For the late century, there will be 56.3-88.5 days with a maximum temperature over 90 degrees, compared to the early century estimate of 36.5-40.2 days (Climate Mapping for Resilience and Adaptation, 2022). Centerville is much better in the early century, but both Richmond and Centerville end up pretty similar in the late century. Indianapolis could experience 62-96 days over 90 degrees in the late century (Climate Mapping for Resilience and Adaptation, 2022).\n\nI am pretty certain that Centerville has not attempted any climate change interventions because we are a small town and do not create a lot of pollution and do not experience extreme weather events. Centerville could try to get public transit that goes to Richmond, because most people have to go to Richmond to go to stores and restaurants. The town could encourage people to walk more.\n\nBibliography:\n\nCMRA – Climate Mapping for Resilience and Adaptation. (2022). Retrieved November 20, 2022, from https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/assessment-tool/explore/details\n\nThe problem that I identified for Centerville is high cholesterol. For Centerville, the “prevalence of high cholesterol among adults aged 18 years and older … was 33.8%” (PLACES, 2019). For comparison, nearby Richmond (which is divided up into multiple areas) has a low of 28.9%, with most being around 31% (PLACES, 2019). High cholesterol means that one has too much LDL cholesterol, which can lead to heart disease and stroke (Prevent High Cholesterol, 2022). To prevent high cholesterol, one should avoid foods that are high in saturated fat, trans fat, salt, and added sugars (Prevent High Cholesterol, 2022). It is good to eat fiber, get regular physical activity, not smoke, and limit the amount of alcohol one drinks to also lower or prevent high cholesterol.\n\nI do not think that Centerville has done any health initiatives, since we are a small town. I know that Richmond has done heart events and marathons and walks, usually with Reid Hospital. Something that Centerville could do is encourage people to walk or bike. There could be a yearly walk or bike event that takes people through town and around the countryside. There could also be a route that is made and advertised that people can walk to see the town and surrounding area, while getting exercise and being able to walk on a designated, safe path and route. At Archway Days, the town could invite Reid to set up a booth to advertise heart health.\n\nBibliography:\n\nPLACES: Local Data for Better Health. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Retrieved November 13, 2022, from https://www.cdc.gov/cholesterol/prevention.htm\n\nOne transportation challenge present in Centerville, Indiana is that it has insufficient sidewalks. The above picture was taken at the intersection down my street. None of the three streets that meet here have sidewalks and, as you can see, the street that my house is on does not have sidewalks either. This problem is present in many areas in the residential areas around the main street. Something that is frustrating is that many of the streets in the residential areas do have streets. Some houses have streets right in front of them at the end of their driveways and/or paths. The top picture below shows this problem. Three of the streets at this intersection have sidewalks on both sides. However, for some reason, there is no sidewalk on the street that we can see down. You can also see that the house on the right has a path that connects to the sidewalk. My house does not have a path that goes to the street, because there is no sidewalk. The second picture below is exactly the same as the first, with three streets having sidewalks, but one not having any. You can see the same problem of suddenly ending sidewalks in the third picture below.\n\nAnother problem with the sidewalks, which is also frustrating, is that there are many streets with sidewalks on only one side. This can be seen in the below pictures. In the second one, the sidewalk continues across the intersection, but only on that one side and down that one street. The street on the left in the second picture leads down to the intersection in the first picture. I think that this is a problem and makes the town less livable by discouraging people from walking to other places from their homes. Rather than walking to the main street to eat or to go to the Village Pantry, people will probably find it easier to just take a 2-minute drive. If you walk, then you have to worry about cars and sometimes might have to walk in the grass if there are cars coming both ways. The sidewalks would have to be made continuous from the houses to the main street. If the sidewalks were wide enough, even, and connected then people would feel safe and comfortable to walk places. It would be seen as easier to walk than to drive. This might also stimulate the local businesses, especially the two restaurants, because it would be easier for people to walk to the main street.\n\nThe only type of housing available in Centerville, Indiana is houses. There are also some duplexes. I know that there are some in my old neighborhood of Winding Brook. There are no apartments, condos, or other multi-housing buildings. I could not find any houses that are for rent, but there is a motel in town. According to realtor.com, there are 12 houses for sale (2022). I would say that the houses are in overall good condition, in that they are not overgrown or have broken windows and the like (realtor.com, 2022). However, they may not be of a high enough quality to attract people. 4 of them are under 1,000 square feet (realtor.com, 2022). 3 of those 4 are the wide, rectangular type of house (see picture below) that many other houses around town are in the style of and that you probably have seen (realtor.com, 2022). Some people, especially families, might need more room or want a more traditionally designed house. However, I think that all of the houses are very nice on the inside, even the smaller ones. Many of the houses also have yards and some have fences (realtor.com, 2022). The second picture below is one of the smaller houses, but I think that it looks great and I would not mind having that as a kitchen. I think that all of the houses available are great.\n\nThe lowest price of a house for sale is $64,900, and the highest price is $349,900 (realtor.com, 2022). The most expensive house is very large and has 6 bedrooms (realtor.com, 2022). I think that there is a fair spread so that people of all incomes can find a house. A regular family will not need the massive house with 6 bedrooms, but the option is there for a large family, a rich family, or multiple people helping to pay. I think that the houses are affordable enough for people to buy. I think that people will be able to get a loan to buy a house and then pay the mortgage. Most people definitely do not have even $64,900 to buy a house outright on their own. People could rent, but I did not find any listings within Centerville, so someone who is looking to rent might have to wait for someone to buy one of these houses and then rent it out. Centerville is much more affordable than other areas. For example, I found two houses, one in Centerville and one in Indianapolis, that are just over 1,500 square feet (realtor.com, 2022). The house in Centerville also has the benefit of an extra bedroom (realtor.com, 2022). The Centerville house costs $84,900 (realtor.com, 2022). Despite the one fewer bedroom, the house in Indianapolis is $142,000 (realtor.com, 2022). The vast majority of houses in Indy are well over $100,000 (realtor.com, 2022). I found one that is $49,000, but it is a townhome in one of those communities where all the houses are the same (see picture below), needs some interior work, and has a homeowners association with fees (realtor.com, 2022). I think that an average, not rich family (like mine) will be able to find a home in which to live in Centerville.\n\nI do not think that Centerville suffers from gentrification, YIMBY/NIMBYism, blighted properties, or right-sizing. There is definitely no gentrification, because nobody is moving in, at least not in large numbers, and buildings are not being replaced. I do not think that there is any controversy over construction, because there is not much of it. I think there is a house 2 blocks up from my street that is almost finished and there are a few lots still available. I do not think that there are any blighted properties. Any that there are, are in the minimal. There was one house down the street and on the corner that at least looked abandoned. Then, it seems that people bought it and fixed it up, replaced some doors and windows, but then no one ever moved in. I believe that it is still empty, but you can tell someone fixed it up a bit. There are no houses with broken windows and graffiti sitting in the middle of town. I also do not think there is right-sizing, because there are spaces to build and the new house that was built was pretty large.\n\nBibliography:\n\nCenterville, IN Real Estate & Homes for Sale. realtor.com.

Centerville uses the ward system in the elections for the council members, so Centerville is divided into five wards (Town Council, 2022). The council members serve four-year terms (Town Council, 2022). The council members are each also in charge of at least one department, though some are in charge of two (Town Council, 2022). The departments that council members are in charge of are police, wastewater, stormwater, water, fire, electric, and street (Town Council, 2022).\n\nThe town of Centerville does not have a mayor. The only city leadership that is elected is the town council. However, the town council does select a member to be the council president (American Legal Publishing, 2019). Currently, the council president is Dan Wandersee (Town Council, 2022). The president has the power to “appoint all special and select committees of the Town Council,” unless the council specifically resolves otherwise (American Legal Publishing, 2019). The same definitions of “weak mayor” or “strong mayor” do not apply, because the president is part of the council, and is not dominant over or subservient to the council as a whole. The only special power is the power with committees mentioned previously.\n\nIt seems that Dan Wandersee has the most control over Centerville. He does not have any special powers, because the council president is still part of the council and the motions still have to be voted on (American Legal Publishing, 2019). However, he was chosen as president by the other members. This makes him the most prominent member and perhaps the most well-known. The fact that he was selected by the other members also shows that they wanted him to be in that position and that they either like him personally or believe him to be the best choice, or both. This means that he may have some influence over the other members to get them to vote his way because they like him personally and have confidence in his abilities and choices. The more control that he has is informal and based on the personal relationships between other members.\n\nBibliography:\n\nCenterville, Indiana. American Legal Publishing. (2019).

Despite being a small town, Centerville has an elementary, middle, and high school. From my friends in school, many people who went to the school did not live in the town proper, but in the surrounding rural areas. Centerville also grades well on the cost of living. The lowest score comes with amenities.\n\nFor the overall cost of living, I would give Centerville an A-. I think that it is much more affordable to live here than other places, especially big cities. According to the town website, Centerville “has some of the lowest electric rates in the state” (Slick, 2022). The monthly charge is $7.50 (Slick, 2022). By comparison, the monthly charge in Indianapolis is $17.00 (Average AES Indiana Electric Bill, 2022). Gasoline at the two gas stations is just under $4.00 when I went past them a few days ago. However, gasoline, as everyone knows, has been more expensive almost everywhere recently. I think that everything will be more affordable than average in Centerville, except for the fact that you might spend more on gasoline. Because Centerville does not have many businesses and no grocery store, one will be driving out of town very often, most likely to Richmond. This means that the average resident may be using more gasoline than someone who lives in a place where they can either walk or take a short drive to places.\n\nFor amenities, I would give Centerville a C. The thing that the town is most known for, and it can be seen by how overrepresented it is in the total number of businesses, is antiques. There are many antique shops on the main street and an antique mall in town. There is one bar in town, The Brown Jug. There are two restaurants, Americana Pizza and 5 Arches Brewing Company (which could also count as a bar, but is mainly a restaurant). We have two gas stations and convenience stores, the Village Pantry and Casey’s (which I still think of as new even though it is a few years old). We do not have a grocery store or movie theater. There is a bank in town. We have a park, Maplewood Park, with a stage and children’s equipment. I think that the weather is nice and we do not often get anything extreme. Every year, we have a town festival called Archway Days with a parade and vendors set up in the park. I give Centerville a lower score because there are not many businesses and of the ones there are, many are antique shops. I think that the two main things that Centerville would benefit from are a supermarket and a movie theater, which I would especially enjoy.\n\nFor education, I would give Centerville a B+. For being a small town, I think that it is impressive that we have an elementary, middle, and high school. They are all located in the same area. For kindergarten to second grade, most people have to go to Rose Hamilton School in Richmond, which is still part of the Centerville school system. Centerville also has preschools. I went to one done by a local church. From personal experience, I think that the schools are good. I also think that we have good facilities. We have a football field, a soccer field, tennis courts, an indoor pool, large gyms, and a large auditorium. Centerville does not have any private schools or colleges within its limits, but it is close to the private schools and colleges of Richmond. The majority of Centerville residents have at least graduated from high school. Only 11.41% of residents have not graduated from high school, which comes up to less than 200 people (World Population Review, 2022).\n\nBibliography:\n\nAverage AES Indiana Electric Bill.

The above image can give you a better idea as to exactly where it is located in the state and county. It also shows that Centerville is close to Richmond, a fact that I know well because people in Centerville have to go to Richmond to have access to a wider variety of restaurants and shops. Pretty much all around the town, and on the way to Richmond, there are fields. Usually, corn and soybeans are grown, especially corn.\n\nThe land that Centerville would go on was planned in 1814 (Through the Archways of Time, 2022). Christopher Roddy was the first to buy a plot in Centerville and was given the right to name the town (Through the Archways of Time, 2022). Originally, the town name was spelled the English spelling of “Centreville,” but was changed to the current American spelling of “Centerville” (Through the Archways of Time, 2022). In 1818, Centerville became the county seat of Wayne County because “it was growing quickly and was the geographical center of the county” (Through the Archways of Time, 2022). The previous seat of Salisbury had the log courthouse that is now in Centerville (Through the Archways of Time, 2022). I have visited the log cabin courthouse and it can be seen from the main street in a courtyard of other older buildings. The log courthouse is the only “still standing in the old northwest territory” (Through the Archways of Time, 2022). Many of the early settlers “were Quakers from Virginia and the Carolina’s” (Through the Archways of Time, 2022). They cared about their religion and education and “quickly raised meeting houses and schools” (Through the Archways of Time, 2022). They built the Wayne County Seminary which later served as colleges and a high school and stood where the elementary school is today (Through the Archways of Time, 2022).\n\nCenterville is located on Highway 40, part of the National Road. In the 1800’s, “Centerville was an important stop along the National Road” with “as many as 200 wagons a day” passing through (Historic Centerville, 2022).\n\nSources:\n\nHistoric Centerville.

I prefer regular houses as the type of housing in my city. However, I think that there can also be small one or two-story apartments, hotels, and condos for people without a family or that do not have the money for a house to live in. In my ideal city, one would be able to walk to a place they wanted to go because it was that close. However, they still might have to drive if they wanted to go to a certain place, such as a specific restaurant or store they prefer or are in the mood for. I would like for there to be restaurants and at least some type of grocery store, such as a Dollar General, within walking distance. I would like this because I would personally like to be able to walk to a place without having to drive and for convenience. I would also like wider roads, both on the main streets and where the houses are, to allow for parking on the side of the road and for people to have space to drive. I would like for there to be sidewalks on all roads, again, on main streets and where the houses are so that people can walk without having to go into the road and so that people are encouraged to walk to businesses.\n\nThe second part of my ideal city is its geographical location. I would like for it to be more northern so that it does not get too hot. I would like for it to be in an area with trees and plants. I would also like for there to be farmland around the town so that farmers can grow crops. I would like for the town to be surrounded by an area of land without many buildings. There can be some farmhouses and farm buildings, gas stations, and maybe some factories. I would like for it to be in a place where it does snow in the winter and where it rains often in other seasons.\n\nThe third part of my ideal city is demographics. I would like for it to be a place for families. I would like for it to be a place where people settle down. My ideal city is a calm and quiet place. I would like for it to be a small town with less than 5,000 residents. Diversity is not important to me.\n\nThe city I have chosen for this project is my hometown and current residence of Centerville, Indiana, as you can tell from the name of this blog. I think that the geographic location is close to perfect for Centerville. I would prefer it if it were a little cooler throughout the year. However, there are lots of trees and it is surrounded by farmland. It rains often and has snow in the winter. The demographics are also perfect. Centerville is a very small town. It is also calm and quiet. From my life here, I believe that most people living here have families. The problems I have with it come with livability. The good part of livability is that houses almost exclusively the living quarters. One negative is the roads and sidewalks. The sideroads where the houses are are narrow and you often have to stop to let a car pass or someone has to stop for you. You can also only park on one side of the road. Many of the roads in front of the houses do not have sidewalks. The major problem is that there are very few businesses in town. We have a pizza place and a Village Pantry. There is no place to go to get groceries in town. The Village Pantry only has limited grocery items. There is a Dollar General down the highway, but there is no way to walk there unless you want to walk along the top of an embankment and along the road. I would take even a Dollar General that was properly in the town. They have a wider selection of food and drinks and many are much cheaper than at other places. I would also like for there to be a small movie theater in town so that I would not have to go to the other side of Richmond. I would also have easier access to the fancy drink machine at the movie theater."
