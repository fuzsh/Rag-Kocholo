        "text": "The FATF identifies jurisdictions with weak measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing (AML/CFT) in two FATF public documents that are issued three times a year. The FATFâ€™s process to publicly list countries with weak AML/CFT regimes has proved effective. As of June 2024, the FATF has reviewed 133 countries and jurisdictions and publicly identified 108 of them. Of these, 84 have since made the necessary reforms to address their AML/CFT weaknesses and have been removed from the process.\n\nThis statement, (previously called \"Public Statement\"), identifies countries or jurisdictions with serious strategic deficiencies to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, and financing of proliferation. For all countries identified as high-risk, the FATF calls on all members and urges all jurisdictions to apply enhanced due diligence, and in the most serious cases, countries are called upon to apply counter-measures to protect the international financial system from the ongoing money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing risks emanating from the country.\n\nThis list is often externally referred to as the black list.\n\nThis statement identifies countries that are actively working with the FATF to address strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing. When the FATF places a jurisdiction under increased monitoring, it means the country has committed to resolve swiftly the identified strategic deficiencies within agreed timeframes and is subject to increased monitoring.\n\nThis list is often externally referred to as the grey list."
