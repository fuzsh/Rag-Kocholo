Due to the generosity of CHS Alumni attending in 2014 in 2015, we awarded 3 – $200 scholarships to Mitchell Burielson, Taylor Lakes and Justin Glover. Due to the generosity of the CHS Alumni attending in 2015, we will award 6 – $200 scholarships in 2016.\n\nAlumni Scholarship\n\nCenterville-Abington Community Dollars for Scholars\n\nExpanding access to higher education for Centerville-Abington students.\n\nOur Mission: Dedicated community volunteers providing scholarships for graduating Centerville students, empowering them to pursue their future goals.\n\nSomething exciting is happening in Centerville and we want you to be a part of the excitement! Have you heard about Dollars for Scholars? Our chapter is now in its seventh year of existence and consists of parents, students, educators, alumni, and business men and women from the Centerville-Abington community. We meet monthly at the high school and we are committed to helping with the costs of higher education for our students.\n\nWe have found a way to help with the rising costs of post-secondary education through our scholarship program. It is exclusive to the Centerville-Abington school corporation and all scholarship funds invested will be used to support our students pursuing higher education of any kind (Vocational/Trade schools, two-year college, and four-year college).\n\nWe need your support to achieve our goals of giving financial help to the graduates of Centerville-Abington School Corporation. The rewards will be great as our children and grandchildren move forward in their educational pursuits."
