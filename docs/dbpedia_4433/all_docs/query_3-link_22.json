The FCDO leads on geographical names for the UK government, working closely with the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names.\n\nIn these lists:\n\n‘country’ is the 2-letter ISO 3166-1 code for the country\n\nthe ‘name’ is the FCDO-approved name for the country\n\nAll UK government departments and other public bodies must use the approved country and territory names in these datasets. Using these names ensures consistency and clarity across public and internal communications, guidance and services.\n\nthe full ‘official name’ is also provided for use when the formal version of a country’s name is needed\n\ncitizen names in the lists are not the legal names for the citizen, they do not relate to the citizen’s ethnicity"
