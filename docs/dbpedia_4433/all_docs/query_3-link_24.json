        "text": "In the event a company, entity or person on one of the following lists appears to match a potential party in an export transaction, additional due diligence is required before proceeding. Depending on which list the match was found, a match indicates either: there is a strict export prohibition; a specific license requirement; or the presence of a \"red flag\".\n\nPrior to taking any further actions, users are to consult the requirements of the specific list on which the company, entity or person is identified by reviewing the webpage of the agency responsible for the list.\n\nDenied Persons List\n\nA list of individuals and entities that have been denied export privileges. Any dealings with a party on this list that would violate the terms of its denial order are prohibited. See Section 764.3(a)(2) of the EAR.\n\nEntity List\n\nThe Entity List identifies foreign parties that are prohibited from receiving some or all items subject to the EAR unless the exporter secures a license. These parties present a greater risk of diversion to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, terrorism, or other activities contrary to U.S. national security and/or foreign policy interests. By publicly listing such parties, the Entity List is an important tool to prevent unauthorized trade in items subject to the EAR.\n\nBIS can add to the Entity List a foreign party, such as an individual, business, research institution, or government organization, for engaging in activities contrary to U.S. national security and/or foreign policy interests. In most instances, license exceptions are unavailable for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to a party on the Entity List of items subject to the EAR. Rather, prior license authorization is required, usually subject to a policy of denial. For guidance concerning the prohibitions and license application review policy applicable to a particular party, please review that party's entry on the list. Procedures for removal from the Entity List appear in Section 744.16 of the EAR. General Orders also may restrict exports to named individuals or entities. For General Orders, see Supplement No. 1 of Part 736 of the EAR.\n\nUnverified List\n\nA list of parties whose bona fides BIS has been unable to verify. No license exceptions may be used for exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) to Unverified parties. A statement must be obtained from such parties prior to shipping items not subject to a license requirement. See Section 744.15 of the EAR.\n\nThe Military End User List (Supplement No. 7 to part 744 of the EAR) identifies foreign parties that are prohibited from receiving items described in Supplement No. 2 of Part 744 of the EAR unless the exporter secures a license. These parties have been determined by the U.S. Government to be ‘military end users,’ as defined in Section 744.21(g) of the EAR, and represent an unacceptable risk of use in or diversion to a ‘military end use’ or ‘military end user’ in China, Russia, or Venezuela.\n\nThe Military End User List is not exhaustive, and, pursuant to the license requirements in Section 744.21 of the EAR, exporters, reexporters, or transferors must conduct their own due diligence for entities not identified in Supplement No. 7 to Part 744 of the EAR.\n\nThe Consolidated Screening List is a searchable and downloadable file that consolidates export screening lists of the Departments of Commerce, State and the Treasury into one spreadsheet to assist in screening potential parties to regulated transactions. If the potential match is from the consolidated list, please follow the detailed instructions on the to determine what list the potential match is from and under what government agency’s jurisdiction."
