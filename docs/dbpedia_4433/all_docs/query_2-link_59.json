        "text": "HAGERSTOWN, Ind. â€” A new home for a Wayne County treasure led the Wayne County Railroaders Association to a major Wayne County Area Chamber of Commerce Award.\n\nThe railroad enthusiasts were recently honored with the Community Spirit Award for placing a restored caboose in Centerville's Maplewood Park, according to a news release.\n\nIn addition, Cambridge Marketplace received the Exemplary Award and Abilities Richmond the Community Impact Award during the chamber's annual Community Improvement Awards program at Hartley Hills Golf Club in Hagerstown. The event included food catered by Willie & Red's and live music by Joey Howard.\n\nThe 1907 CB&Q caboose has nearly five decades of local history with past homes at Richmond's East Main Street McDonald's restaurant and at Highland Hills Elementary School. The railroaders have restored it and created a visible, permanent location in the Centerville park where visitors can walk through the caboose.\n\nJill and Jim King turned an unsightly, abandoned car wash into the Cambridge Marketplace on West Main Street in Cambridge City. The building designed by Ratio Architects and built by Whisenhunt Construction resembles a historic train depot with large double doors and a communal space.\n\nCourtyard landscaping provides year-round green with artificial turf and provides a space for people to meet and sit.\n\nAbilities Richmond transformed an 1870s building in the Depot District that had not been occupied since 1976. The building on North E Street at the U.S. 27 overpass now serves as a day home for people with developmental disabilities, where they make and sell items and operate a coffee shop.\n\nAbilities Richmond worked with Johnson and Associates and architect Scott Webb on the extensive renovation of the building that was slated for demolition.\n\nAdditional nominees for the Exemplary and Community Impact awards were: Blue Buffalo bulk unload project, Circle U Help Center warehouse, El Bronco West restaurant, Israel \"Izzy\" David Edelman Fire & Police Training Center classroom and conference building, Root 13 Beauty Salon building facelift, Taco Bell East new building, Taconic Biosciences new building and Wernle Youth & Family Treatment Center Behnken Hall."
