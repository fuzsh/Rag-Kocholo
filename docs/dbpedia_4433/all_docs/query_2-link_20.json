Thank you for your support over the past 25 years!\n\nCenterville, Indiana\n\nZip Code: 47330 Population: 2,576\n\nCenterville, Indiana is located in Center Township in the center of Wayne County. Children in this community attend Centerville-Abington Community Schools..\n\nThe National Road, now known as U.S. 40, runs east-west through the center of this community.\n\nThe Archway Days community celebration is held each year on the third weekend in August.\n\nAttractions\n\nAntique Alley\n\nCope Environmental Center\n\nHistory\n\nCenterville was platted in 1814. In 1818 it became the county seat and remained so until 1873. The streets were originally 100 feet wide, but with the increased activity in town when it became the county seat, the width was decreased to 65 feet. Buildings with common walls were erected in front of original buildings. The original buildings could then be reached through the archways.\n\nThe five existing Archways are unusual in the interior of the United States. The Centerville Archways date from 1823 through 1836.\n\nBackenstoes Archway, circa 1835 at 139 East Main Street\n\nDill Archway, circa 1830 at 109 S. Morton Avenue\n\nShortridge Archway, circa 1820 at 205 West Main Street\n\nLantz Archway, circa 1823 at 212 West Main Street\n\nMalone Archway, circa 1836 at 119 West Main Street\n\nCenterville is home to Wayne County's original log courthouse which was moved to Centerville and restored in 1998. It is the only original log courthouse still standing in the Northwest Territory.\n\nThe house at 319 West Main in Centerville, Indiana was home to Indiana's Civil War governor, Oliver P. Morton. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nFor a fun bit of history, read about the \"war\" between Centerville and Richmond over the location of the county seat in 1873.\n\nOf Historical Interest:\n\nJacob Julian House\n\nLantz House\n\nMansion House\n\nWayne County Warden's House (i.e. Center Township Library)\n\nHistory of Centerville\n\nCenterville and Center Township History\n\nThe Birth of An American Town by Inezetta Stiver\n\nSchools\n\nCenterville-Abington Community Schools\n\nCenterville Senior High School\n\nCenterville Junior High School\n\nCenterville-Abington Elementary\n\nRose Hamilton Elementary\n\nGovernment Services\n\nFor Emergencies: Call 9-1-1\n\nService Address Phone Number Centerville Fire Department 414 South Morton Street DIAL 9-1-1\n\nNon-emergency: 765.855.3889 Police Department DIAL 9-1-1\n\nNon-emergency: 765.855.5222 City Building\n\nClerk, Treasurer, and Utilities Office 204 East Main Street 765.855.5515 Centerville - Center Township Library 126 East Main Street 765.855.5223 Municipal Garage 816 North McMinn Road 765.855.3408 Post Office 300 East Main Street 765.855.5121 Water Works 601 South Morton Avenue 765.855.3261\n\nElected Officials\n\nElected Official Position Phone Susan E.
