        "text": "My time at Centerville Highschool is one I recall fondly as there were teachers that truly believed in me and the effects one individual can do for people. My Junior year, I became a teacher assistant for the same teacher for 2 years. I still talk to that teacher after 3 years of not being in high school and has helped me out on some job applications! Just for an example of the deep bonds that can be formed then and be applicable to now. Same goes for the difficulty being at Centerville for the classes. Some days, it feels like my days in highschool were tougher than the days I have in college now. As the clear objective of Centerville Highschool is to prepare you for college and oh they sure do a fine job at it.\n\nIâ€™m glad I went to my Highschool and helped create the person I am today!"
