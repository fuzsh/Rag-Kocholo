        "text": "What Is CBD & Why Do Indianan Find It So Special?\n\nCBD stands for cannabidiol, which is a compound — called a cannabinoid — found in cannabis plants. Hemp and marijuana are probably to two most famous strains of cannabis, and both contain CBD. But, CBD is much more prevalent in hemp.\n\nCannabinoids, in general, offer the promise of countless mental and physical health benefits. Research has been shown that CBD, in particular, may help with:\n\nAddiction\n\nAnxiety, depression, PTSD, and stress\n\nBone health\n\nCancer (and treatment side effects)\n\nCardiovascular and metabolic syndromes\n\nEpilepsy\n\nGlaucoma\n\nGut health\n\nImmune system and certain related diseases\n\nMigraines and headaches\n\nNeurologic disorders\n\nObesity\n\nPain and inflammation\n\nRespiratory ailments like asthma\n\nSkin issues\n\nSleep\n\nAnd more!\n\nTons of products are infused with CBD oil. Each preparation yields its own unique advantages. And, with this ocean of options, incorporating CBD into a self-care routine can be simple, convenient, affordable, and effective.\n\nSo, it’s quite probable that your Centerville friends and neighbors are experiencing relief for a whole slew of wellness concerns.

Here’s what they’ve got to say….\n\nIs CBD Legal in Centerville, Indiana?\n\nOh, boy, we’re not going to unpack this whole big, messy box of cannabis regulatory history. We’ll cut to the chase and hit on the juicy — impactful — bits. We’re talking hemp, CBD, and the laws of the land.\n\nA little background first, though. Cannabis, in its diverse and glorious varieties, has been grown and used for thousands of years. In fact, hemp is actually one of the oldest known cultivated crops, with records of its use dating back about 10,000 years.\n\nIn the modern era, hemp was widely farmed in the early part of the 1900s. Then, for various reasons, hemp was outlawed by the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act. Cue the screeching halt to the once-thriving hemp industry. For the next 80ish years, US hemp production was at a deafening standstill.\n\nAt last, things started to loosen up with the passage of the 2014 Farm Bill. This permitted states and research institutions to start formally studying industrial hemp (hemp with less than 0.3% THC content) and its byproducts (like CBD).\n\nThe 2018 Farm Bill progressed hemp’s and CBD’s fortunes even more. This is the legislation that made industrial hemp and its derivatives federally-legal. CBD products could be made, transported, sold, bought, owned, and used.\n\nDon’t get too excited yet. The federal hemp laws are very high-level, outlining basic rules and guidelines. Detailed laws and regulations were delegated to the individual states to develop and enact.\n\nSo, what we’re left with is a crazy quilt of hemp and CBD statues and policies. Making the local legal status of CBD even murkier is that jurisdictions like municipalities and tribal nations can have laws that differ from the state they’re in.\n\nThis brings us to your home state, Indiana.\n\nOf course, the story of “Is CBD legal in Indiana?“ doesn’t end here. Cannabis laws are ever-changing at all levels of government. Driven largely by the overwhelming popular support for legalization of marijuana or hemp (or both) in some way shape, or for — you can expect to see new legislation roll out. This means the rules in Centerville, Indiana could evolve as well.\n\nAll that said, lots of folks in Centerville, Indiana are curious to know…\n\nSo, is CBD legal in Indiana?\n\nCBD is federally-legal. As far as the national powers that be are concerned, you can buy and use CBD in Centerville, Indiana.\n\nBy design, the exact CBD laws in Indiana can define or depart from the federal directives. Your best bet is to periodically check in on the local CBD regulations to stay up-to-the-moment on them. Fortunately, Pure Craft keep tabs on state CBD laws, which can help provide some guidance to you when you’re near Centerville or traveling about the country."
