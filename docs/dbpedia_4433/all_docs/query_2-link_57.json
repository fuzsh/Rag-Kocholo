        "text": "If you are a teacher or a group leader, these inspirational words will help you introduce the deed and why it is so special.\n\nWhat Does it Mean to Have a Nature IN-Deed?\n\nEvery Nature IN-Deed holder has claim to a spot in the Children of Indiana Nature Park. This means each student with a deed will have “claim” to a spot in the Park that can be visited in person or virtually on the internet. Once you have the deed, it is yours to hold on to and pass it down to younger siblings or even future children so generations to come will continue to have this special connection with nature.\n\nOnce your kids have a Nature IN-Deed, display it proudly or put it to work! You can frame your deed and hang it up to show it off, stick it on your fridge as a reminder to learn more about nature and even use the coordinates to find your county’s designated spot when you visit the Children of Indiana Nature Park.\n\nSend us your photos of how you display or use your deed to childrenofindiananaturepark@tnc.org and you could end up on our webpage or social media!\n\nA Nature Park\n\nYou won’t find a swing set or slide at this park. Instead, the trails at the Children of Indiana Nature Park provide the opportunity to see and enjoy plants, birds and other creatures. And unlike playground parks, this park is providing every student in Indiana with a deed to a piece of this special place. This “Nature IN-Deed” invites your young Hoosier to think of themselves as little landowners and to learn to care for their land.\n\nHow do you learn to care for your land? (Hint: You don't need to be at the Children of Indiana Nature Park!)\n\nStart by being an observer. Whether you are in the city or in the country, take a look around you and notice what you see!\n\nLook up to see what might be near the treetops or on the power lines. Look down and notice the soil, wildlife footprints, plants or animals. Take pictures or notes about what you see. Later on, you might be able to identify it. If you know what it is, you can learn what it needs and how to care for it.\n\nStacy’s family knew you didn’t need to travel far to explore and connect with our natural world. Nature can be found right in our own backyards.\n\n“Watching them became a cool little project that sparked a huge interest in different wildlife habitats,” said Stacy about her family’s study and observation of butterflies. The family also decided to raise monarch butterflies, which brought the wonders of nature into their home.\n\n“Nature means a ton to my family, we have a [fish] pond that made its own ecosystem, it brought frogs and turtles and my kids love catching the frogs and building them little frog houses,” she said.\n\nThank you to Stacy and her family for being such enthusiastic backyard nature explorers. You are an inspiration!\n\nAnd if your family is ready to leave your backyard and explore our state’s great natural areas, the Children of Indiana Nature Park can help with that too. Find nature near you!\n\nCommunity Science Activities\n\nLooking for something to do that's helpful to the science community? Try some community science! Not only will you learn all about each of the subjects for these projects but you'll also be helping scientists track and record data.\n\neBird\n\neBird is a year-round community science project through to Cornell Lab of Ornithology. You can submit birds you see to their database to help you find more birds, keep track of what birds you find, explore sightings from around the world and contribute to science and conservation!\n\nNestWatch\n\nNestWatch nationwide nest-monitoring program. It tracks the status and trends in bird reproduction, and you watch nests! This easy and fun community science project asks you find a nest, monitor it and report what you see to NestWatch in real time. It helps researchers to understand and study birds.Project\n\nFeederWatch (April – November)\n\nProject FeederWatch is a winter community science project that surveys birds visiting feeders in backyards, nature centers and other locations in North America. These bird counts let you see what is happening in your own backyard and helps scientists track long-term trends in bird distribution and abundance. Project FeederWatch is through the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.\n\nFrogWatch USA\n\nFrogWatch USA is through the Association of Zoos & Aquariums. To participate, individuals, families and groups observe and report frog and toad vocalizations February –August. It is a chance to learn about wetlands and toads and frogs in your communities.\n\nBudburst\n\nBudburst is sponsored by the Chicago Botanic Garden and is a way to report flowering times of local plants. Community scientists report observations of plant lifecycles to help researches and horticulturists understand more about how plant species and ecosystems respond to changes in climate locally, regionally and nationally. Allseasons are valuable so you can participate at any time of year.\n\nGreat Lakes Early Detection Network\n\nGLEDN is an invasive species early detection and warning system for the Great Lakes region. It was developed with funding from the National Park Service and is part of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. It is an online tracking systems that collects invasive species reports from casual observers anduses the reports to project the Great Lakes region.\n\nTick Insiders\n\nTick Insiders is a citizen science project to improvethat prevention, diagnosis and treatment of tick-borne diseases in Indiana. This project helps scientists better understand the risks of tick-borne diseases and can help improve healthcare for Hoosiers.\n\nReport INvasives\n\nReport INvasives is a website hosted by the Purdue College of Agriculture and the Indiana Invasive Species Council. Community scientists report sightings of invasive plant and animal species they see in Indiana and the experts take it from there. The website helps you learn about the harm invasive species can do and how to identify them.\n\nRum Village Park\n\nNear the heart of South Bend is Rum Village Park. This 160-acre area is a wildlife haven and offers hiking and biking trails, picnic areas and a place to escape to one of the nicest woodlands in the area. The Rum Village Nature Center invites parents and teachers to help children claim their deed to a piece of land in Rum Village Park. The Nature IN-Deed is an invitation for you to learn about the land—the pond or forest habitat, the creatures that live there—and how to care for your land. Once you have your deed, find your spot in the Park! Walk along the Indian Trail to find your spot in the forest. To find your spot near the vernal ponds, take the Spicebush Trail.\n\nRum Village Park has a unique type of habitat, known as a vernal pond. The word vernal means spring time, so that tells us when these wetlands are full of water, and life. Frogs, toads and salamanders use these ponds in spring, when they are laying eggs. By the time they have gone from egg, to larva, to adult, the ponds are drying out. But that’s OK, since the young amphibians are now developed enough to hop or crawl away into a different wetland, or suitable location.\n\nRum Village Park is also home to an ecosystem known as mixed deciduous forest. This ecosystem formerly covered much of the eastern United States. We are privileged to have this living vestige of that great forest within the city limits of South Bend. It’s home to 25 different species of trees, with many of them being over 150 years old. And it’s not just trees that thrive at Rum Village. Wildflowers, mushrooms and ferns, reptiles and amphibians, mammals and a 100-plus species of birds find a safe haven in Rum Village Park.\n\nInterested in a lesson and field trip for your students to learn more about vernal ponds or mixed deciduous forest? Contact Garry Harrington gharrington@southbendin.gov and Hannah Teshka hteshka@southbendin.gov, naturalists at the Rum Village Nature Center."
