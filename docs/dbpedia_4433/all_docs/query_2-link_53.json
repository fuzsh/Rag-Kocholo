        "text": "The Village Forager originated in my small hometown-Centerville, Indiana. I grew up here, graduated from high school here, raised my children here and still live here! The “Forager” in our name comes from my love of everything from the forest-moss, mushrooms, rocks, and all living things. I am very proud to have started my dream business in the city that is closest to my heart. Every day we have customers in who just want to take a moment from their chaotic days and walk around the store just to take in the sounds, scents, sights and relax. Sipping on a hot tea, just chilling out. That’s exactly what I wanted to do-true retail therapy, no pressure sales, we appreciate you just stopping by. Our customer base has mainly grown by word of mouth and we very much appreciate our customers, old and new!! 2024 will bring our seventh year in business in Centerville and we always have something new up our sleeve!\n\nOur original store in Indiana opened its doors in 2017 and by 2022 we decided it was time to take steps to open a second location in Mount Juliet Tennessee. Having a family member in the area who was eager to run the store made it an easy decision! Not to mention that the weather in Tennessee is wonderful and the people of Mount Juliet are very kind and welcoming! We opened the doors on April 1st and haven’t looked back!\n\nThe Village Forager TN offers all the cool things that our original store does as well as items that are local to the Mount Juliet area. A small coffee shop, a greenhouse, a wall of loose leaf teas, tons of unique gifts, cards, gemstones, pottery, jewelry, bath & body and so much more! Stop by and say HI soon!\n\nThe Village Forager’s third location in Richmond, Indiana is open as of November 7th! Our Life Styled store will represent all the warm and cozy things that help to make your house a home. From decorating your home, entertaining in your home, gifting for all occasions and treating yourself with something new or tasty-our Life Styled location will have everything you need. We have stocked the shelves with unique and tasty gourmet food options, unique kitchen and barware, home decor from pillows and bedding to candles and linens. Crates and baskets are always in stock to fill for that just perfect wedding, anniversary, new home gift… or any occasion at all! We can’t wait for you to see this one!"
