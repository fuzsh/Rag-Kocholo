        "text": "It’s been 15 years since Turner Insurance was just an idea. When Kyle Turner first started the agency, he had no clients and no carriers. Through interviews with carriers at his dining room table, Kyle was able to secure two contracts with Celina Mutual Insurance & Grange Insurance. After obtaining these two contracts, Kyle was able to officially call himself “Turner Insurance Agency” and start his business.\n\nThe first policy Kyle wrote was for Tim & Karen Chaney. When Kyle left the first meeting with a check from the Chaney’s he told himself he would never forget the feeling that someone chose Turner Insurance to be their agent. Others soon followed after Tim & Karen. The Pruitt’s, Larry Crull & his laundromat, the Bentlage’s, Rinehart’s, Brewer’s & Jones. We are proud to say we still work with all of these folks – and we don’t tell them how much we appreciate their business quite enough. Over the years we have been able to grow Turner Insurance more than Kyle could have ever imagined. Our staff, clients and carrier force are exceptional and other people must have taken notice.\n\nOn March 1, 2020, Kyle agreed to become part of the Shepherd Insurance Family and Turner Insurance became Turner & Shepherd Insurance. Shepherd Insurance is the largest independent insurance agency in the state of Indiana, and the 43rd largest agency in the United States. Shepherd told us they would be as active or inactive as we wanted them to be – they just want to support us and help us continue to grow. Shepherd shares out culture and likes to win.\n\nThe cool thing about our merger is that Shepherd approached us. That’s kind of like a small hardware store being approached by Menards or Lowes and being told, “we like you and would like to work with you. If you’ll work with us, you’ll have access to our store but can keep doing what you’re doing.” In the end, we couldn’t find a downside, and that’s why we are so excited.\n\nSo, it’s business as usual here, but likely more of it. You’ll still get to harass and joke with Kimber, Courtney, Stephanie, Dee, et al, and put up with Grant, Mike, Aaron & Kyle. THANK YOU for being a client of Turner Insurance, and now Turner & Shepherd Insurance."
