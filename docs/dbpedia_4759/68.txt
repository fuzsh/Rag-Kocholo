Lieutenant Colonel [Ian] Bruce Ferguson, Commanding Officer of 3rd Battalion, The Royal Australian Regiment (3RAR), giving a reading at a religious service for Australian servicemen. The padre is probably Church of England Chaplain Allan Walter Laing, who undertook multpile tours of Korea throughout the conflict. The photograph was probably taken by Lloyd Brown, photographer for Melbourne's Herald and Sun newspapers, who was embedded with other Australian correspondents in Korea from August to December 1950.
