On three occasions during the course of the war he has shown outstanding powers of organisation and ability to overcome abnormal difficulty. When his Battalion was embodied at the beginning of the war Captain Sandys was almost entirely responsible for the rapid and efficient equipping and mobilising of the Unit. In the summer of 1940 the Unit was in particularly difficult circumstances in that all types of personal and public equipment were taken on charge, issued and twice called in for re-issue to Regular Units which had returned from France. During this time also personnel were continually drafted overseas. In spite of these difficulties and discouragements Captain Sandys performed his duties with quite outstanding skill. In 1943-1944 the Unit was stationed at Gibraltar. Conditions were peculiar in that the Unit maintained on ledger charge many kinds of additional siege equipment and at the same time was responsible for equipping and maintaining a number of attached sub-units. The ration strength of this Unit was 50% above War Establishment. For fifteen months Captain Sandys showed the utmost diligence and outstanding powers of organisation in undertaking duties greatly in excess of those normal for a Unit Quartermaster without increase of staff or other outside assistance. In Italy from September 1944 to January 1945 the Unit was engaged in active operations in mountainous country under appalling weather conditions. Administrative resources were straind to the utmost. The Unit lines of communications varied between a twenty mile mule train over difficult tracks and a sixty mile motor transport drive over roads made almost impassable by mud or snow. During this period Captain Sandys never failed to meet any demand made on him by forward troops. When the weather was at its worst he personally made the twelve hour round trip from the Unit B-Echelon to Unit Rear Headquarters once every forty-eight hours and always reported by telephone or in person to his Commanding Officer. Throughout the whole period he showed the most outstanding endurance, determination and devotion to duty. Captain Sandys enlisted in 1914 at the age of 16 and has served continuously since that date.

H.W.B. Saunders: In the late afternoon of 3 Nov [1942] an attack in co-operation with tanks was launched on an enemy locality about Tel El Aqqiqira. This locality was supposed to be in our hands or lightly held and the attack was carried out only under cover of smoke in consequence. Soon after the attack was launched our tanks came under intense and accurate anti-tank fire while the Battalion ran into several machine gun nests, thus causing severe casualties both in tanks and men and bringing the attack to a standstill. The wireless sets in both the leading companies were hit and put out of action and all runners trying to reach Battalion Headquarters became casualties. Fully realising the situation, Col. Saunders at once personally went forward on foot to his leading companies. He re-organised the left one which had lost all its officers. He then went across to the right one, during all which time both tanks and infantry were pinned to their ground by heavy enemy fire. By his courageous action he steadied the Battalion and enabled it to hold the ground won by getting his men to dig in where they lay. Throughout the whole action Col. Saunders displayed leadership of the highest order, showing a complete disregard for danger and setting a fine example to his command. To his personal example and determination the partial success of the Battalion was largely due.\n\n[Recommended 09.11.1942 by Brig. D.A.H. Graham, commanding 153rd Infantry Brigade, approved 13.11.1942 by Maj.Gen. D.N. Wimberley, commanding 51st Infantry Division, 18.11.1942 by Lt.Gen. O.H.W.

Alexander, commanding Middle East Forces.] * Recommendation for the award of the Military Cross to WS/Lt. I.R. Saunders: On the morning of 17th April 1945, Lieutenant Saunders, The Queens Bays, was in command of a troop of tanks supporting \"D\" Company, 1st Battalion The Royal Irish Fusiliers (Princess Victoria's). The task allotted to this force was the enlargement of, and exploitation from, the small bridgehead over the Marina Canal - an area dominated by enemy tanks and assault guns. Two out of the four of the tanks supporting the Companies which had secured the original bridgehead had been knocked out and any movement drew immediate fire. Despite this adverse state of affairs, this officer manoeuvred his troops into fire positions from which he harassed the enemy all day, knocking out at least two enemy tanks and killing a number of infantry, causing others to surrender. During this time every one of the tanks under his command was hit at least once by a solid shot. There is no doubt, that but for his courage, skill and determination, not one of his tanks would have arrived intact on the objective, thereby leaving the infantry open to an extremely probable counter-attack. His advance under fire from tanks and assault guns for a distance of fifteen hundred yards enabled the infantry to carry out their appointed task with every success and resulted in the final break through of the defences of the Argenta Gap. Lieutenant Saunders' personal bearing was an inspiration, not only to his own men, but also to the infantry which his troop was supporting.\n\n[Recommended by Lt.Col. M.J.F.

Capt. SCOTT was the Rear Link Officer and his tank like all others in the squadron came under heavy artillery and mortar fire during the advance on the town. This fire in no way distracted Capt. SCOTT whose information from the Squadron Leader to the Regimental Commander over the wireless was a model of calmness and clarity. The orders which he received from the Commanding Officer for the Squadron, he passed on in a clear and concise manner over the \"B\" Set. Shortly after entering the town, Capt. SCOTT's tank received a direct hit with an H.E. shell, which did not damage the \"A\" Set but broke the \"B\" Set and made short [...] communication impossible. This officer proceeded without hesitation to leave his tank and run across to the Squadron Leader to deliver orders by word of mouth. He continued in this manner running to and fro between his own and his Squadron Leader's tank in spite of heavy shell fire which continued throughout the whole operations for a period of 3 hours, By his coolness and complete disregard for his personal safety Capt Scott displayed an outstanding example of devotion to duty, and ensured that the essential wireless communication between the Squadron and the Regiment was maintained during this most vital operation.

G.M. Scott: On the 18th April 1945 Lieut. Scott, with his Troop, was supporting a Company of the 24th Guards Brigade during the advance through Chiesa el Bando. When the advance was held up by an enemy minefield Lieut. Scott went out on foot to reconnoitre a path through the minefield; throughout his recce he was subjected to intense mortar and shell fire. On completion of his task Lieut. Scott was returning to his tank when he was wounded by a mortar shell. Although in great pain, from a serious wound, and losing a large amount of blood, he had the presence of mind and singleness of purpose, to pass on the information he had gained on his recce to his Troop Sergeant. This information proved invaluable, and as a result of it the Squadron was able to continue the advance and assist the Infantry in clearing the village. Lieut. Scott has always shown great coolness and courage in previous actions.\n\n[Recommended by Lt.Col. D.R.B. Kaye, commanding 10th Royal Hussars, approved by Brig. J.F.B. Combe, commanding 2nd Armoured Brigade, by Lt.Gen. C.F. Keightley, commanding 5 Corps, by Lt.Gen. R.L. McCreery, commanding 8th Army, and finally by Field Marshal Sir Harold R.L.G.
