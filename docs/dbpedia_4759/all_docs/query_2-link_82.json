        "text": "Judge Ian Robert Simons\n\nFY 2018 - 2023, Detroit Immigration Court\n\nPublished Oct 19, 2023\n\nAttorney General Loretta E. Lynch appointed Ian Robert Simons to begin hearing cases in September 2016. Judge Simons earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1998 from Michigan State University and a Juris Doctor in 2001 from the Michigan State University College of Law. From 2009 to September 2016, he served as an assistant chief counsel for the Office of the Chief Counsel, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Department of Homeland Security, in Detroit. From 2011 through 2013, he served as a special assistant U.S. attorney for the U.S. Attorney’s Office, District of Arizona, Department of Justice, in Phoenix. From 2001 through 2009, he served as an assistant prosecutor for the Oakland County Prosecutor’s Office, in Pontiac, Mich. Judge Simons is a member of the State Bar of Michigan.\n\nDeciding Asylum Cases\n\nDetailed data on decisions by Judge Simons were examined for the period covering fiscal years 2018 through 2023. During this period, court records show that Judge Simons decided 546 asylum claims on their merits. Of these, he granted asylum for 206, granted 8 other types of relief, and denied relief to 332. Converted to percentage terms, Simons denied 60.8 percent and granted 39.2 percent of asylum cases (including forms of relief other than asylum).\n\nFigure 1 provides a comparison of Judge Simons's denial rate each fiscal year over this recent period. (Rates for years with less than 25 decisions are not shown.)\n\nFigure 1: Percent of Asylum Matters Denied\n\nNationwide Comparisons\n\nCompared to Judge Simons's denial rate of 60.8 percent, Immigration Court judges across the country denied 60.6 percent of asylum claims during this same period. Judges at the Detroit Immigration Court where Judge Simons decided these cases denied asylum 64.6 percent of the time. See Figure 2.\n\nJudge Simons's asylum grant and denial rates are compared with other judges serving on the same court in this table. Note that when an Immigration Judge serves on more than one court during the same period, separate Immigration Judge reports are created for any Court in which the judge rendered at least 100 asylum decisions.\n\nFigure 2: Comparing Denial Rates (percents)\n\nWhy Do Denial Rates Vary Among Judges?\n\nAlthough denial rates are shaped by each Judge's judicial philosophy, denial rates are also shaped by other factors, such as the types of cases on the Judge's docket, the detained status of immigrant respondents, current immigration policies, and other factors beyond an individual Judge's control. For example, TRAC has previously found that legal representation and the nationality of the asylum seeker are just two factors that appear to impact asylum decision outcomes.\n\nThe composition of cases may differ significantly between Immigration Courts in the country. Within a single Court when cases are randomly assigned to judges sitting on that Court, each Judge should have roughly a similar composition of cases given a sufficient number of asylum cases. Then variations in asylum decisions among Judges on the same Immigration Court would appear to reflect, at least in part, the judicial philosophy that the Judge brings to the bench. However, if judges within a Court are assigned to specialized dockets or hearing locations, then case compositions are likely to continue to differ and can contribute to differences in asylum denial rates.\n\nRepresentation\n\nWhen asylum seekers are not represented by an attorney, almost all of them (80%) are denied asylum. In contrast, a significantly higher proportion of represented asylum seekers are successful. In the case of Judge Simons, 9.9% were not represented by an attorney. See Figure 3. For the nation as a whole, about 15.7% of asylum seekers are not represented.\n\nFigure 3: Asylum Seeker Had Representation\n\nNationality\n\nAsylum seekers are a diverse group. Over one hundred different nationalities had at least one hundred individuals claiming asylum decided during this period. As might be expected, immigration courts located in different parts of the country tend to have proportionately larger shares from some countries than from others. And, given the required legal grounds for a successful asylum claim, asylum seekers from some nations tend to be more successful than others.\n\nThe largest group of asylum seekers appearing before Judge Simons came from Honduras. Individuals from this country made up 18.9% of his caseload. Other nationalities in descending order of frequency appearing before Judge Simons were: Guatemala (17.0%), Iraq (10.1%), Mexico (8.1%), Colombia (6.0%). See Figure 4.\n\nIn the nation as a whole during this same period, major nationalities of asylum seekers, in descending order of frequency, were El Salvador (16.6%), Guatemala (15.1%), Honduras (13.8%), Mexico (9.2%), China (6.8%), India (5.1%), Venezuela (3.2%), Ecuador (3.1%), Cuba (2.4%), Nicaragua (2.3%), Brazil (2.0%), Colombia (1.4%), Cameroon (1.4%).\n\nFigure 4: Asylum Decisions by Nationality"
