        "text": "Jon Kabat-Zinn '64\n\nA practitioner of Buddhist meditation and yoga since 1965, when he was a doctoral student in molecular biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Jon Kabat-Zinn, Ph.D., achieved international recognition following the publication of his book Full Catastrophe Living: Using the Wisdom of Your Body and Mind to Face Stress, Pain, and Illness (1990). His 1993 appearance on the PBS series Healing and the Mind, with Bill Moyers, introduced Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) to a mainstream audience. Kabat-Zinn is the author of a series of scientific papers on mindfulness as well as of 15 books— including, in 2023, Mindfulness Meditation for Pain Relief— published in more than 45 languages.\n\nKabat-Zinn undertook his pioneering work as a professor of medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, where he is still professor emeritus. There he founded the worldrenowned MBSR Clinic in 1979 and the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society (CFM) in 1995, both now part of UMass Memorial Health. From its inception, Kabat-Zinn envisioned MBSR not as a therapy but as a public health project, with the aim to move the bell-curve of society, over time, in the direction of greater health and well-being on every level. His work and that of a global community of colleagues have contributed to a growing movement of mindfulness into mainstream institutions in medicine, higher education, business, social justice, the law, technology, and government. More than 700 hospitals and medical centers around the world now offer MBSR.\n\nAla Stanford\n\nA national health equity leader and healthcare policy advisor, Dr. Ala Stanford advocates for vulnerable populations worldwide. Stanford garnered international recognition during the COVID-19 pandemic when she leveraged her pediatric surgery practice in Philadelphia to form the Black Doctors COVID-19 Consortium, a grassroots organization focused on education, testing, contract tracing, and vaccination in communities without access to lifesaving care and resources. The consortium served more than 100,000 of the city’s most vulnerable residents, who were disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.\n\nIn 2022, Stanford was appointed by President Joe Biden as the regional director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for the Mid-Atlantic region, a role in which she oversaw federal health programs and initiatives in Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. In her continued effort to shift the paradigm of medical services and eliminate health disparities, in 2021 she founded a Center for Health Equity in North Philadelphia, in a community whose residents have among the shortest life expectancy in the city. The center’s team of expert, culturally competent, and diverse clinicians has expanded the continuum of care and improved health outcomes.\n\nStanford’s numerous accolades include recognition as one of Forbes’ most influential women (2021 and 2022), a George H. W. Bush Points of Light Award recipient, and a CNN Hero, as well as the commissioning of a Philadelphia street in her name. In August, Simon & Schuster will publish Take Care of Them Like My Own: Faith, Fortitude, and a Surgeon’s Fight for Health Justice, a memoir in which she explores how her experiences on both sides of the scalpel have informed her understanding of the nation’s racial health gap."
