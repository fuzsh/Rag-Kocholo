        "text": "Ferguson: Australian leader in Merm\\\n\nA rugged soldier whol\n\nis able to blush\n\nBy RONALD\n\nMcKIE\n\nNovember 2, among the blood\n\n\" and dust of North Korea,\n\nLieut.-Colonel C. H. Green, com\n\nmander of the 3rd \" Battalion,\n\nRoyal Australian Regiment, died\n\nof wounds.\n\nEight days later Lieutenant-Colonel\n\nI. B. Ferguson succeeded Green, who\n\nhad so ably led the 1000 Australians\n\nfighting with the United Nations force.\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Ferguson began his mili\n\ntary career as a private footslogger in the A.IF.\n\nin 1939.\n\nOfficers who served with him in World War\n\nII all agree that the Australians fighting 5000\n\nmiles north of Sydney couldn't have a better\n\nleader.\n\nMajor-General A. S. (\"Tubby\") Allen, whom\n\nFerguson impressed when he was an Intelligence\n\nsergeant with Brigade Headquarters, Middle East,\n\ntold me:\n\n\"I remember him well. He was a fine type,\n\na good cove, extremely efficient. In Green and\n\nFerguson the Army has made two very good\n\nchoices for commanders, in Korea.\"\n\nIan Bruce Ferguson — Bruce to his friends— is j\n\nslim, wiry, sharp-featured, black-haired, dapper, I\n\ndashing. He talks almost abruptly. He has a i\n\nhighly developed sense of fun and an engaging\n\nsmile.\n\nBut that gives only a quick\n\npicture. Deep down, he's a\n\ncurious mixture of what's known\n\nas the \"officer type,\" plus a lot\n\nmore.\n\nHe's a good conventional sol\n\ndier—alert, tough, efficient, un-\n\nrelaxing on parade, keen on\n\nmilitary formalities, an unre\n\nlenting saluter in what I once\n\nheard a camp humorist call the\n\n\"shudder style.\" - .\n\nBut here is the other side to\n\nwhat his friends call his \"mer\n\ncurial character.\"\n\nUnder his veneer of toughness\n\nhe's about as hard-boiled as a\n\nweek-old kitten. He's extremely\n\nidealistic and sentimental.\n\nHe has appealing manners\n\nand is gallant, almost in the\n\nContinental sense, to women.\n\nHe hands round tea and two\n\nkinds of cake at afternoon tea\n\nwith the effortless ease of a head\n\nwaiter.\n\nHe blushes easily, particularly\n\nif you \"rag\" him. That's what\n\nI said— blushes.\n\nOne of his friends summed\n\nhim up this way: \"My out\n\nstanding recollections of Bruce\n\nare his sturdy self-sufficiency,\n\ncourage, peculiar uprightness\n\nin bearing and character, tem\n\nperamental moods, gaiety at\n\nparties, and his capacity for\n\nbottled beer.\n\n\"TT\n\nJL JLe'S an officer who\n\nknows instinctively how the\n\nmen feel, think, and live. He\n\nknows because he was one of\n\nthem. He's that rare officer\n\nwho fraternises with his men,\n\ncalls them by their first names,\n\nbu% who never loses discipline.\"\n\nBruce Ferguson, who is 33, is\n\nnot an Australian. He was born\n\nin Wellington (N.Z.).\n\nHis father died when he was\n\na small boy, and his mother\n\nlater married Sydney Wren, a\n\nNew Zealander who fought as a\n\nmajor in France in World War\n\nI with the Royal Engineers.\n\nSydney Wren, the only father\n\nBruce Ferguson ever .knew, was\n\na much-travelled free-lance\n\njournalist who, when he moved\n\nabout the world, always took\n\nhis family with him.\n\nBruce went to school in Eng\n\nland and France. He speaks\n\nFrench fluently, with a good\n\naccent, and his sister, Philippa,\n\nonce won a prize for French at\n\na French school.\n\nSydney Wren was quite a\n\ngourmet, and when iri France\n\nalways sent out his stepson\n\nBruce, as a sort of \"food runner\"\n\nto tour restaurants in the neigh\n\nborhood and report back on the\n\nexcellence, or otherwise, of the\n\nfood.\n\nPerhaps this explains why\n\nBruce Ferguson was such a\n\ngood Intelligence sergeant and\n\nofficer in World War II. Per\n\nhaps his erratic, varied early\n\nyears also explain his tempera\n\nment and his constitutional\n\nrestlessness under static condi\n\ntions.\n\nHe always wanted to be a\n\nsoldier. His stepfather's mili\n\ntary record in World War I,\n\nwhich included a major's rank\n\nand the Military Cross for gal\n\nlantry, always acted as a spur\n\nto Bruce.\n\nHis mother, who lives with\n\nher husband and daughter at\n\nBundaberg, Queensland, told\n\nme when I called her by phone:\n\n\"Bruce has always been keen\n\non soldiering. We always\n\nthought he would go a long\n\nway.\"\n\nWhen the Sydney Wrens re\n\nturned to New Zealand in 1936,\n\nBruce Ferguson spent a little\n\ntime in Sydney before going to\n\nWellington and taking a job\n\nwith the Star Newspaper Ser\n\nvice of Canada.\n\nBut he was back in Sydney\n\njust before World War II start\n\ned, and, on the outbreak in Sep\n\ntember, 1939, enlisted as a pri\n\nvate in the A.IF., went overseas\n\nwith the 6th Division, and serv\n\ned in the Western Desert and\n\nGreece.\n\nDuring the attack on Bardia,\n\nwhen he was an Intelligence\n\nsergeant with 16th Brigade\n\nH.Q.,. he added to his reputa\n\ntion, already well established\n\namong his cobbers, as a magnifi\n\ncent scrounger.\n\nHe was the first Australian to\n\n\"liberate\" an Italian light car\n\nand he used it to run .between\n\nBrigade H.Q. and Battalion.\n\nFor three days he was the only\n\nAustralian in the Western Des\n\nert with his private car— and\n\nthe envy of every officer and\n\nman.\n\nLater in the offensive he \"lib\n\nerated\" a motor-cycle— also\n\nItalian.\n\nA mate of his once said:\n\n\"Ferguson's such a good scroun\n\nger that if you put him down\n\nin the middle of the Sahara\n\nhe'd soon dig up a tin of bully,\n\na bottle of beer, and a dancing\n\ngirl.\"\n\nBruce Ferguson\n\nbecame a lieutenant early in\n\n1940 with the 2/2 Battalion, but\n\nwas seconded as Intelligence\n\nOfficer to Brigade H.Q.\n\nAnd he was a captain early\n\nin 1942 before his Brigade, re\n\nturning to Australia from the\n\nMiddle East, stopped off at\n\nColombo to help garrison Cey\n\nlon.\n\nBefore he left the Middle East,\n\nand when he was stationed near\n\nDamascus, he came back from\n\nleave one night and accidentally\n\nset fire to the tent he shared\n\nwith two officer friends.\n\n\"We all decided to pull his\n\nleg — to stage a mock court-\n\nmartial and make' it look good,\"\n\none of those officers told me.\n\n\"Bruce thought, the trial was\n\nfair dinkum. He gave his evid\n\nence very seriously. He must\n\nhave thought we were getting\n\nready to hand him a bowler\n\nhat.\n\n\"As a witness, I was asked to\n\ndescribe the accused's condition\n\nat the time of the fire. 'Under\n\nthe influence of liquor,' I re\n\nplied.\n\n\"But when Bruce blushed and\n\ngave me a dirty look I couldn't\n\nkeep my face straight. That!\n\nwas the end of the court-mar. I\n\nfcial.\" I\n\nBruce Ferguson went to Neyl\n\nGuinea as a company comman.H\n\nder with the 2/2 Battalion, 16th |\n\nBrigade,- and won his Militaryl\n\nCross on October 10, 1942, in thel\n\ngrim Owen Stanley fighting. |\n\nAt ATempleton's \" Crossing.\n\nabout 50 miles from Port Mores I\n\nby, the Australians put in a|\n\ntwo-company attack against thel\n\nJapanese., |\n\nCaptain Donald Fairbrother,|\n\nhow of Cessnock, led A Com- 1\n\npahy, and Captain Bruce Fergu-I\n\nson led B Company. |\n\nIn a day's bitter fighting, |\n\nwhich included bayonet charges\n\ndown slippery ridges, the Aus-|\n\ntralians Cleaned up the J apan.\n\nese and the advance across the I\n\nOwen Stanleys went on.\n\nBoth Ferguson and Fair-!\n\nbrother won their M.Cs. for\n\nleadership and gallantry in that!\n\nshow I\n\nFerguson's M.C., the citation |\n\nsaid, was, for \"gallantry, deter- 1\n\nmination, devotion to duty, and!\n\nleadership. . . Ferguson led !\n\nhis company with dating and\n\ndetermination in an attack!\n\ndown the northern spur. Thel\n\ncompany suffered severe casual- !\n\nties, including the three platoon!\n\ncommanders. I\n\n\"He showed brilliant direction!\n\nin successfully reorganising his!\n\ncompany. . . . Later, when!\n\ncommunications were disrupted! I\n\nhe moved under heavy, fire to\n\nBattalion H.Q. with information K\n\nwhich was vital later in the!\n\nday.. . . Throughout the day I\n\nhe was an inspiration to all who I\n\ncame into contact with him.\" I\n\nBack in a training I\n\ncamp at Atherton Tableland,!\n\nNorth Queensland,. he re- 1\n\ncovered from malaria, but in- 1\n\naction there bored him stiff. I\n\nWith officer friends he used!\n\nto take a jeep, supplies, am- 1\n\nmuntion, and a radio and beat I\n\nit up into Cape York Penin-|\n\nsula. I\n\nIn September, 1943, .Bruce I\n\nFerguson went to 6th Division I\n\nH.Q. as senior liaison officer, I\n\nand began to study combined I\n\noperations— his pet subject ever I\n\nsince. I\n\nThen, after a Staff College!\n\ncourse (at Duntroon) , he be- 1\n\ncame General Staff Officer ii,\n\nCombined Operations, 7th Divi\n\nsion, with the rank of major,\n\nand was responsible for much\n\nof the Division's planning and\n\ntraining.\n\nHe was in the Morotai land\n\ning and the landing at Balik\n\nPapan, Borneo, and was men\n\ntioned in dispatches.\n\nHe went to Japan as a mem\n\nber of the 67th Battalion, when\n\nthe 34th Brigade first took up\n\noccupation duties with the Bri\n\ntish Commonwealth Occupation\n\nForce. A year ago he married\n\nCanadian Jessie Brown, a\n\nmember of the Canadian Em\n\nbassy staff in Tokio.\n\nLteutenant-Colonel Ferguson\n\nhas been in Korea right from\n\nthe jump— and he looks like\n\nbeing there quite a time.\n\nBut all his friends agree they\n\nwouldn't want a better friend or\n\nleader in a tight spot, and as\n\none of them adds: \"Anyway, our\n\nboys in Korea will, never starve\n\n— not while Bruce is around,\n\nBest scrounger I've ever\n\n'known!\"\n\nLieut-Colonel FERGUSON Help"
