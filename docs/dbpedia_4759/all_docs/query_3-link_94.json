        "text": "West Ham United boss David Moyes paid tribute to Steve Bruce after he was sacked by Newcastle on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe 60-year-old had been long expected to leave St James’ Park over recent weeks following the club’s £300m takeover by PIF.\n\nHe was handed the opportunity to oversee his 1000th game in management, a 3-2 defeat at the hands of Tottenham Hotspur, but the Magpies announced that they had come to a decision over his future just a few days after the match.\n\nFollowing confirmation of his departure, Moyes praised Bruce for reaching the highly-impressive landmark and for the job that he has done with the north East club since being appointed in 2019.\n\nTalking in his pre-match press conference ahead of the Hammers’ Europa League showdown with Genk, he said: \"I am pleased for Steve that he kept Newcastle in the league when most people didn't expect him to do so. He did it with very little money, which is a fact. He didn't just keep them up. They finished 13th.\n\n“I have great respect for him after 1,000 games in management and his level of longevity is incredible. There will be clubs out there who want him.”\n\nMeanwhile, Moyes has also expressed his frustration at seeing a colleague lose his job amid difficult circumstances at St James’ Park.\n\nHe continued: “It's very difficult. People don't understand the implications sometimes. You get a lot of people talking about us every day, whether it be the BBC, Sky or newspapers. It's a job which when we come into we accept that it's part of it.\n\n\"Steve did a great job at Newcastle last year and kept them up when maybe over periods Newcastle have been up and down. They've not always been in the Premier League.\n\n\"So with what he had to spend last year, he did a very good job. It's like anybody. If you're always getting talked about or criticised, it's not a nice thing, whether you're a football manager or whether you're a journalist.\"\n\nHaving seen his fair share of managerial changes throughout his stint within the game, Moyes understands the current situation and also harked back to one of the most respected names in the game for an explanation where manager turnover appears to be so high.\n\n\"I do believe management is much more difficult [now]. Managers don't have as much power. I remember Sir Alex Ferguson saying when he was getting close (to retiring) that the manager's power was diminishing now because of agents, because of the new owners, different things in football.\" he said."
