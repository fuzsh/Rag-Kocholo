One of the highlights of his life was winning the state football championship while at The Dalles High School in 1947. At one point he debated whether he wanted to be a physician or a football coach. Fortunately, for the community he served, he came up with a plan to enjoy both. He volunteered as team physician for the David Douglas Scots in southeast Portland, never missing a home or away game, for 23 years. The wrestling team also benefited from his expertise as cauliflower ears got tended to as participants sought him out from other parts of the state. In more recent years, he took up sporting clays shooting. True to form, he earned national ranking in his division and enjoyed the camaraderie it provided. Dr. Browning had a soft spot for the Oregon State Beavers, and was a Trailblazers season ticket holder for many years. All of that competitiveness rubbed off on his offspring who all pursued athletic endeavors of their own.\n\nProfessionally, Dr. Browning demonstrated leadership by serving as president of the Oregon Osteopathic Association and a term as Chief of Staff at Eastmoreland General Hospital. He was recognized as general practitioner of the year for the Oregon Osteopathic Association and was chairman of the Sports Medicine Committee before it was established as a specialty. Colleagues recognized his legacy of devotion to medicine by awarding him a Founders’ Emeritus award in 2005.\n\nDr. Browning and Nevelle thoroughly enjoyed their large and boisterous family at gatherings for Christmas, 4th of July, and endless birthday celebrations.

Dr. Gilbert was born in Methodist Hospital, Dallas, Texas, exactly at midnight to Dr. Franklin Monroe Gilbert and Dorothy (Brandon) Gilbert. Due to the timing of his birth, his birthday could have been either May 7 or May 8, but his parents chose May 8, 1933, as his official date of birth. Dr. Gilbert had a wonderful childhood, as Irving was a very small town of perhaps 700 to 800 residents. Everyone knew him, his mother, dad, and brother, F.M., and they knew most of the Irving residents. In 1939, the family moved from their small cottage, which was then located just south of the corner of Irving Boulevard and O’Connor, to 309 South O’Connor (Iowa Street then). Dr. Gilbert’s father had purchased the home from his brother, W.B. Gilbert, who had lived in the home with his family from 1936 to 1939. W.B. had purchased the “Airplane Bungalow” house from Louise Joffre Baker who had lived there since 1919, the year that it was built.\n\nDr. Gilbert attended the Irving Public Schools, and his first grade teacher was Mrs. Elise Walker from 1939-40 and his secondgrade teacher was Mrs. Gela F. Harkey from 1940-41. Mrs. Harkey taught the second grade in Irving from 1923-47, and during those years “she taught every Gilbert in Irving.” The family recalls how she taught his brother as well as cousins and many close relatives. In high school, some of the teachers Dr. Gilbert held dear to his heart were Mrs. Fannie Louise Sharp (English), Mrs. Clara Gibbs (English), Mr. F.N. Wilson (Math). Irving remained a rather small town and he knew most of the teachers in grade school and high school. He graduated from Irving High School in May 1950. At age 17, he entered the freshman class at Southern Methodist University and began pre-medical studies. As a little boy people would ask, “Clay, do you want to become a doctor like your father?” And later he would immediately reply that he did! That was all he knew; his mother was a nurse and dad was a physician. Dr. Gilbert recalled how patients would come by the house frequently for his dad to treat them. He grew up around medicine. Notably, his grandfather, D.W. Gilbert, MD, was the first physician to practice medicine in Irving (1880-1930), and his father, Franklin Monroe Gilbert, MD, practiced medicine in Irving 59 years (1920-1979). Dr. Gilbert graduated from Southern Methodist University with a bachelor of science degree on June 1, 1954, with a major in biology and minors in chemistry, psychology and religion. Following graduation from SMU, he entered graduate school and began to work on his master’s degree in biology in addition to taking other courses, such as histology, that would help him in medical school.\n\nIn the summer of 1959, Dr. Gilbert applied and was accepted to the freshman class at ATSU-KCOM, Kirksville, Missouri, that began in September of that year. Days passed into months, and months into years and he graduated with a doctor of osteopathic medicine degree on May 27, 1963, finishing a four-year course leading to his degree. On Oct. 22, 2003, ATSU endowed The Clay W. Gilbert, DO, Chair for the Department of Family Medicine at ATSU-KCOM.\n\nDr. Gilbert interned at Stevens Park Hospital, Dallas, Texas from 1963-64. On June 1, 1964, he entered into the practice of family medicine with two other doctors in Athens, Texas. He thoroughly enjoyed his practice there, delivering babies, making house calls and conducting an office practice. These were wonderful happy years for him, and he continued to practice in Athens until February 1967. During his years of practice in Athens, Dr. Gilbert became interested in anesthesiology. At the Wolfe-Duphorne Hospital, he had given general anesthesia and had learned in great detail the art of ether anesthesia and its administration. Dr. Gilbert applied to Dallas Osteopathic Hospital (now Dallas Memorial Hospital) for a residency in anesthesiology and was accepted and began his residency on Feb. 1, 1967, where he continued until July 1, 1967. The chief of anesthesiology recommended that Dr. Gilbert complete his residency at Cherry Hill Hospital Medical Center, Cherry Hill, New Jersey, due to its excellent reputation as a training hospital in anesthesiology. On July 11, 1967 he entered the Anesthesiology residency as suggested and completed it on Feb. 10, 1969. Dr. Gilbert accepted a position after the residency as a staff anesthesiologist at Cherry Hill Hospital Medical Center, remaining on the staff there for one year (1969-70). He then returned to Dallas, Texas, and became a staff anesthesiologist at the Stevens Park Hospital (now Dallas Family Hospital) for two years (1970-72), before accepting a position at the North East Memorial Hospital, Houston, Texas, from 1972-76 as of chief of anesthesiology. Next on his medical journey, Dr. Gilbert accepted a position as staff anesthesiologist at East Town Osteopathic Hospital (now Tri-City Hospital) between the years of 1976-78. A position of chief of Anesthesiology Department at Pioneer Park Hospital, Irving, Texas, was offered to Dr. Gilbert in 1978 and he accepted working there until 1986, at which time he chose to retire from the anesthesiology practice.\n\nAfter his retirement from this particular area of practice, Dr. Gilbert entered the practice of family medicine in Irving, Texas, which he successfully ran between 1986 through 1988; at which time Dr. Gilbert transferred his practice to the Stevens Park Clinic, Dallas, Texas treating patients until 1989. He then fully retired from the practice of medicine and had traveled many times, including extensive travel in Israel. Dr. Gilbert maintained his membership with the following professional societies: The American Osteopathic Association (retired member); Texas Osteopathic Medical Association (retired member); Texas Society of the American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians (retired member); and American Osteopathic College of Anesthesiologists (retired member).\n\nDr. Gilbert attended Bible School in Dallas for several years and between the years of 1990 and 1992 he was president of the Ministerial Elders at the Eagle’s Nest Family Church, Dallas, Texas. On April 10, 1990, Dr. Gilbert was ordained into the ministry under the International Deliverance Churches of which Eagle’s Nest is affiliated. Then, on April 29, 1991, he received his “Certificate of Ordination” under the United Christian Church and Ministerial Association, Cleveland, Tennessee. Dr. Gilbert attended the First United Methodist Church, Irving, and until his death was a member and elder of the Calvary Temple Church, Irving.\n\nDr. Gilbert was a charter member of the Irving Heritage Society and had served on the society’s board of directors. Mary Higbie recalls her memories having lived next door to the Schulze family home (Heritage House) as a youth as well as an adult. She stated “Clay was a wonderful docent for visitor tours of the Heritage House. He would share stories of his personal interaction with C.P. and Virginia Schulze. He was a wonderful musician as well and often played the piano for guests as the music room was a favorite area for his assignment during the tours. No Heritage Society Valentine Tea would be complete without Clay at the piano. Tea guests would find a spot to be nearby to listen or perhaps share a verse or two of a favorite song. He was chosen as the Heritage Society Sweetheart in 2003 for his dedication as a volunteer on behalf of the Heritage Society. Until the last couple of years, he regularly attended the board meetings. He always seemed to especially enjoy the desserts and sometimes went home with an extra serving. His service on the museum advisory board was important to him. His memory and attention to detail served him well in many areas. He, like many others, worked hard over the years for a history style museum for Irving. Perhaps a major accomplishment was getting the house at 309 South O’Connor on the National Register of Historic Places. No small task, Clay was diligent in every detail in getting this accomplished. It was awarded August 1, 2014. The day he shared the information with the Heritage Society board was indeed exciting. The Heritage Society helped him host a public dedication and reception on a beautiful December day in 2014. It was the very first such designation on the National Register of Historic Places in Irving. I am sure that those of us who have been involved with the Heritage Society for any length of time each have a story about Clay. The memory of him will be one that we will cherish for many years to come.” Dr. Gilbert also sat on several of the City of Irving’s Centennial Task Force Committees planning the celebration of the 100th birthday of the city. In 1995, Dr. Gilbert received a Community Service Award given by the Irving Parks and Recreation Advisory Board. When he was a part of the city’s centennial celebration planning, Dr. Gilbert donated a piece of land to the city toward the development of a new park commemorating the city’s centennial. The Board of Directors of the Irving Independent School District named the Dr. Franklin Monroe Gilbert Elementary School, located at 5100 East Pioneer, in honor of his father. The Dr. D.W. Gilbert School, at 707 Edmonson, was named in honor of his grandfather, Dr. D.W. Gilbert. “Gilbert Road” in West Irving Bear Creek area was also named in honor of Dr. D.W. Gilbert many years ago.\n\nOn Dec. 8, 1994, Dr. Clay W. Gilbert gave the City of Irving, Texas, the original copy of the “Irving Index Newspaper”, Vol. 1 No. 1, dated December 19, 1903, R. M. Hudson Editor. Joe Rice writes in “Irving, a Texas Odyssey”, p. 37, the following: “The Chicago, Rock Island and Gulf Railroad provided a special train out of Dallas to the auction (of town lots) which had been advertised in the newspaper. Spence Dilworth cooked barbeque, which was available with fixings. An unusual circumstance was that editor R.M. Hudson passed through the crowd distributing the first issue of his newspaper, the “Irving Index”. About 150 people gathered for the sale (of lots).” This piece of history, as well as the legacy and memories that Dr. Gilbert leaves behind, will forever now be held in the hearts and minds of past, current, and future residents of Irving, Texas.\n\nDr. Gilbert is preceded in death by his parents Dr. Franklin Monroe Gilbert and Dorothy (Brandon) Gilbert. Left to cherish his memory are his brother Dr. Frances Monroe Gilbert and his Nephews and their wives, Jere (Cindy) Gilbert, Mark (Gail) Gilbert and Greg (Leslie) Gilbert and as well as many grand nephews and nieces. A special thanks to his caregiver, Dalia Garces, for her dedicated and loving care of Dr. Gilbert the last several years. His family will miss him; his storytelling, his strong faith, his love of good food and all the wonderful times spent together at family gatherings.\n\nWilliam L. Graham, DO, ’66, Knoxville, Tennessee, died Dec. 17, 2021, at age 83. Dr. Graham was born on August 3, 1938 in Ten Mile, MO to John A. and Nora Elgetha (Cox) Graham. He was raised in and around Canton, MO by his mother, stepfather Ray Bally, and several aunts and uncles. He and his brothers, John K. Graham, DO, ’63, and Jim, required a village, based on the stories they told of their childhood antics.\n\nAfter high school, Dr. Graham spent three years in the navy before beginning his studies at ATSU-KCOM. During his studies, he married the love of his life, Ann Sue Noble, and had three children: Elizabeth (Bruce) Wilson, William (Missy) Graham, and Joseph (Dawn) Graham. After his internship, he settled into family practice, serving for 18 years as the only doctor in a small town called Beaverton, MI. In addition to career, friends, and family, he loved many things. He was an avid golfer, even making his own clubs; he produced many pieces of beautiful woodwork; he amassed 18 aquariums, tied his own flies, fished, bowled, hunted, played cards, and traveled extensively. Through his activities and his charm he made many friends in the places he and his wife lived, including Rushville, IN and retirement parks in AZ and FL, before settling in Knoxville shortly before the pandemic arrived.\n\nDr. Graham’s deep love and ready wit will be missed and remembered by his friends and family. These include, among many others, his brother Jim Graham and family, his brother-in-law Steve Noble and family, sisters-in-law Sharon Graham and Eleanor Noble and their families, and his grandchildren Kat & Ben (Lindsay) Wilson, Maggie (Taylor) Marr & Carmen Graham, and RaeAnna & Ambrie Graham.\n\nMichael R. Harshfield, MHEd, ’11, Spring, Texas, died Dec. 8, 2020, at age 69. Mike lived life as a caring soul who made a difference in the lives of others. He had a big heart, showing others kindness. When he laughed, he meant it. A smile often partnered with a tell-tale twinkle in his eye. He thought of others rather than himself. No wonder he worked in the healthcare field and became Director of Clinical Education in Respiratory Care at a Houston-area college. He loved teaching, devoting his life to imparting to his students at Lone Star College-Kingwood the life-saving skills of respiratory therapy. His legacy lives on in the students he instructed and in those patients who benefited from his teaching prowess and hands-on care. After helping to extend the lives of others, Mike’s passing completes the circle of life. Mike loved family most of all, not only as a husband and father where it matters most, but also as a son, a brother, a grandfather, an uncle, and a nephew. Family gatherings, large or small, made him the happiest. He dearly loved the annual reunions hosted by Uncles Charles Lee Dildine and his wife Mary, and James “Sonny” Dildine and his wife, Carol. His legacy lives on in the great memories those close to him will always cherish. Mike loved home, learning at an early age in a military family that the hearth follows the heart. After growing up all over the world, Mike put down roots in Houston to raise a family and lived in the same house for almost 30 years. His legacy lives on by giving truth to the adage that home is where the heart is. Mike loved learning. While not surprising for a college professor, his thirst for knowledge never flagged or ceased. A prolific reader and Student of Life, Mike could bore you to tears with obscure factoids about the Civil War or excite you with some unexpected insight on a topic you thought you had mastered. His legacy lives on in the eternal quest for knowledge that mankind can put to good use. Mike earned a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Puget Sound, Tacoma, Washington, and his Masters in Health Education. His career as a respiratory therapist and educator in the medical field spanned forty-two years. At Lone Star College-Kingwood, Mike served as an Instructor and Professor in the Respiratory Care program, specializing in Clinical Education, Basic Life Support, Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support, Pediatric Advanced Life Support, and the Neonatal Resuscitation Program. He served as Director of Clinical Education in Respiratory Care, returning to faculty member status in 2013 for health reasons, and retiring December 31, 2016. Mike’s life-long interest in and passion for the sciences dates back to childhood when he received a microscope in third grade as a Christmas gift. His first patient was his brother Pat. Mike always stood ready to bandage a scraped knee or elbow, so he could view the “tissue samples” on a slide and his passion for the sciences and intellectual curiosity was born. Last, Mike loved life, living it to the fullest. Remarkably, he did so despite facing personal tragedy all his life that would have crushed lesser folks. His legacy lives on in the example he set for others about how to accept and overcome life’s vicissitudes. A quote from Nelson Mandela aptly defines Mike’s attitude: “Do not judge me by my success. Judge me by how many times I fell down and got back up again.” Mike leaves behind his courageous, devoted and loving wife, Katherine Broussard Harshfield; his daughter, Katheryn Guro Harshfield Mendoza, also an RRT and a Neonatal Pediatric Specialist at Children’s Memorial Hermann Hospital, ICU, Houston Medical Center; his son, Timothy Charles Harshfield, SSgt., U.S. Marine Corps.; and his grandson, Ian Patrick Mendoza, first in his class in kindergarten (of course) who can’t decide if he wants to be an airline pilot, King of the Tyrant Lizards (a/k/a Tyrannosaurus Rex), or a doctor. Other survivors include Mike’s brother Patrick Lee Harshfield, his sister Brenda Kaye Gorman and her husband John, his sister Terrie Harshfield Edgar and her husband Perry, his niece Nicole Treese and her husband Bryan along with their three children Garrett, Hayden, and Davis, and his nephew Michael Layton Evans. Mike is preceded in death by his parents, Jo Helen and Charles Layton Harshfield, and wife, Patricia Ann Harshfield. In the final measure, Michael Ray Harshfield, November 23, 1951-December 8, 2020 made the world a better place. In death, he continues to live on. All who knew Mike will miss him.\n\nDavid C. Hogarty, DO, ’99, Goldsboro, North Carolina, died Dec. 31, 2021, at age 55. Born in Washington, D.C., on November 20, 1966, Dr. Hogarty was the son of Margaret McCluskey Hogarty and the late Thomas Felix Hogarty of Reston. He graduated in 1985 from South Lakes High School. He received his undergraduate degree from the College of William and Mary and an MS from the University of Florida in Gainesville. He, along with his wife Suneya, were graduates of ATSU-KCOM in Kirksville, Missouri. His medical practice brought great joy to his life. He treated his patients as an extension of his family, and he loved them all. He was community oriented. As scoutmaster for Boy Scout Troup 7, he was extremely proud to see his sons achieve the rank of Eagle Scout. He also served on the Military Affairs Committee through the Wayne County Chamber of Commerce to support Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. He relished the beauty of nature; he spent countless hours birdwatching, one of his favorite pastimes. In addition to his mother, Dr. Hogarty is survived by his wife of twenty-two years, Suneya Gupta Hogarty, DO, ’99; his children Sahil, 19; Meher, 17; and Kirina, 14; his brother, Mark Hogarty and wife Djenaba of Reston; and his inlaws, J.D. Gupta, M.D. and Gool K. Gupta, M.D.\n\nRobb E. Imonen, DO, ’67, Honokaa, Hawaii, died March 3, 2021, at age 79. Dr. Imonen was born on March 18, 1941 in Highland Park, Michigan of proud Finnish American heritage.\n\nDr. Imonen was a survivor of polio as a child and went on to live a life full of love, adventure and family. He served 21 years Active Duty in the United States Army Medical Corps as Chief of both Radiation Therapy and later of Psychiatry, following a second residency. He retired from the military in 1994 as a Colonel. He completed his career of public service as the Director of Behavioral Health for Marquette General Hospital in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\n\nHaving raised four children in Hawaii, the Islands were home for him and Elodie S. Imonen, his wife of 55 Years. They devoted themselves to each other, their children, (sons Brent and wife Sarie, Mark, Lee and wife Kate, and daughter Kai) their six grandchildren (Brock, Maile, Zane, Mason, Brodie, and Samia) and to the farm that they dreamed up together, on the Hamakua Coast.\n\nEver curious, Dr. Imonen was a life-long reader and learner; able to absorb and share lifetimes of knowledge with whomever would join him to talk story. He could debate almost any topic from many angles, but was always quick to leave differences behind, and to get on with the real joy of friendship he found with others. He loved people and to see the world through travel. Many a time were the day’s adventures shared between Elodie and Dr. Imonen over a fine meal, in a new place with a beautiful view. They covered a lot of ground together.\n\nDr. Imonen touched the lives of many; as a doctor, a mentor of young physicians, a friend, neighbor, father, grandfather and husband. He enjoyed his spiritual life and sense of community that he shared as an active member of Honokaa United Methodist Church-his other Ohana.\n\nBruce C. Johnson, DO, ’53, Chelsea, Michigan, died Sept. 17, 2021, at age 93. Dr. Johnson was born on March 11, 1928 in Moline, Illinois, to Clarence Cal and Lenore (Brutus) Johnson. He spent his childhood in Moline and Richmond, Indiana. Then he attended Augustana College, where he completed a 4-year pre-med program in just 3 years. He became a Doctor of Osteopathy (DO) at ATSU-KCOM. While performing his physician’s residency at Riverside Osteopathic Hospital in Trenton, Michigan, he met the love of his life, Mary June Campoy Eastman, who had been recently widowed with two sons. Dr. Johnson and June were married July 10, 1954 and he adopted his new sons, John and Barry. In 1955, the couple was blessed with the arrival of baby Victoria June and then baby Mary Lenore in 1956. Between their arrivals, Dr. Johnson opened his own medical practice in Ypsilanti, Michigan. He visited hospitalized patients and performed surgeries at Ridgewood Osteopathic Hospital in Ypsilanti. His med-school friend, Bud Young, then joined him as his partner. Sadly, Bud died just a few years later. However, Bud’s wife, Phyllis, his son and three daughters remained close to the Johnsons, sharing many summer holiday cook-outs and winter ski trips. During Dr. Johnson’s final years, Phyllis lived just a 5-minute walk away and watched out for him, for which he was very grateful. He retired in the 1970s when he and June moved to Key Biscayne, Florida, where they could play tennis all year ’round. Dr. Johnson and June’s tennis and social buddies Garver and Isabelle Wilson, soon followed them to Key Biscayne. In 2009, he and June moved back to Michigan, where they took up residence at Silver Maples of Chelsea. Because the two couples were inseparable, Garver and “Izzie” also moved from Key Biscayne to Silver Maples soon afterwards. Dr. Johnson was predeceased by his beloved wife, June, in 2014 after nearly 60 years of marriage. He was also predeceased by his parents and his sister Barbara, and by Vickie’s children and his grandchildren Amy Larson and Matt Larson. Dr. Johnson is survived by his four children, John (Mary Cronin) Johnson, Barry (Kathy) Johnson, Vickie (Jeff Holoweiko) Chevoor, and Mary (Lou) Pomerville. He is survived by seven grandchildren: Ryan (Amanda) Patterson, Kyle (Ashlee Brennan) Patterson, Erik (Karen Ziemianski) Johnson, Christine “C.J.” Johnson, Jennifer Larson, Alex Chevoor, and Katie Chevoor. He was blessed with three great-grandchildren: Fiona Patterson, Maeve Patterson, and Quinn Johnson.\n\nJeffrey M. Koerner, DO, ’74, Lakeland, Florida, died Aug. 12, 2021.\n\nRobert S. Lawson, DO, ’64, Tulsa, Oklahoma, died Aug. 25, 2021, at age 82. He was born on February 11, 1939 in Joplin, MO, the only child of Frieda Louise (Gebhardt) Lawson and Sidney Lawson, DO. He pursued his undergraduate education at St Beneditcts College in Atchison, KS and Pittsburg State College in Pittsburg, KS from 1957 to 1960. On May 14, 1959 he married Jacquelyn Marie Landoll, the woman he loved from the moment he first saw her to the moment of his death.\n\nHe and Jackie moved to Kirksville, MO in the fall of 1960 for him to attend ATSU-KCOM, where he received his doctor of osteopathic medicine degree in May of 1964.

Dr. Wolf became the brother he never had with an enduring friendship of 61 years.\n\nHe moved to Tulsa, OK in 1964 to complete his Internship and Residency at the Oklahoma Osteopathic Hospital (OK State University Medical Center). He joined the staff of the Benien Clinic and Department of Surgery staff at OOH in 1968 until retiring from surgery in1995. He then practiced family medicine and was the medical director at the Indian Health Care Resource Center until his retirement in 2007. He has received numerous awards and honors including Outstanding Physician Award TRMC in 1995 and TRMC “People Caring for People” Award. Academic appointments included Adjunct Professor of Surgery OK State College of Osteopathic Medicine and Adjunct Professor of Surgery, ATSU-KCOM.\n\nDr. Lawson was a lifelong student and educator. His passion outside of medicine was the study of history. He also enjoyed sailing with friends and family, whether on an Oklahoma lake or navigating the waters of the Caribbean.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his beloved “Jack” in July of 2003. He is survived by his children Bryan Lawson and wife Carla, Kevin Lawson and wife Shelly, Karen Lewis, Jeff Lawson, and Steve Lawson, his grandchildren Emily Lawson, Allison Lawson, Jacob Lawson, Danielle Lewis, and Matthew Lewis and his two great-granddaughters Rowan and Norah Billy.\n\nTimothy L. Lukavsky, DDS, Mesa, Arizona, died Dec. 24, 2021. Dr. Timothy, known by many across the world as Dr. Tim, was a husband and father of four children. He was a practicing dentist and director of the Department of Special Care Dentistry at ATSU-ASDOH, which is cutting edge in training dental students to care for special needs patients. Dr. Tim passed away peacefully in the presence of his family in his home at 1:15 p.m. on Christmas Eve, December 24, 2021. He was diagnosed with ALS, known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease one and a half years ago, continued to work at ATSU as his abilities to walk, use his hands, speak, swallow, and finally breathe were ravished. But his ability to love, joke, and make his will known were somehow maintained till his final acknowledgment of his daughter, Andrea’s love by squeezing her hand before going home in peace. He leaves behind his wife of thirty-four years, Catalina, his son, Paul, (wife, Leigha, and their two children, Ezra and Micaiah), his son and dentist who often headed up Dr. Tim’s mission trips, Dr. Michael (dentist wife, Dr. Erika and their child, Isaiah), his daughter, Sabrina and her two children, Elijah and yet unborn baby, and his daughter, Andrea. Dr. Tim headed up Medical/Dental mission trips taking with him many dental and some medical students that are now practicing these skills all over the world to Mexico, Honduras, and Central America several times a year for the past 30 years. His energy, skill, faith, and quick, somewhat irreverent signature humor and famous sayings or “Dr. Tim isms” have affected or drastically changed untold numbers of lives of patients, dental students, friends, family, and faculty members all over the country and the world. He literally touched and transformed lives of the people he encountered by his skill and ability to teach this skill to treat patients that often are considered undesirable because of their mental, psychological, or physical disabilities or just complicated nature of their medical needs. Because of this, their gratitude is only matched by Dr. Tim’s contagious ‘attitude of gratitude’ that has driven his passion to step out in faith that God wants to comfort, to heal, to bring miracles and victory. Dr. Tim would say, “If you want to see a miracle, BE the miracle!” Anyone that knows Dr. Tim has seen the miracles! Dr. Tim has said that when you work on the mouth of one of the socalled ‘least of these’ you know that you are touching the ‘Face of God’! These are just a few of “Dr. Tim isms:” “Life is better than I could ever imagine but more painful than I could ever guess.“ “Only from a humble heart comes true gratitude.” “Gratitude is the one emotion that cannot coexist with any other bad emotions.” “Gratitude is the antidote to all that ails you. But without humility, you are doomed to a life of no gratitude. “ “The definition of the word Joy is Sorrow overcome by Love. Joy always stays, though happiness comes and goes. So when you meet joyful people you know they are going through a lot of sorrow.” ….and finally, “Love conquers all” This mantra was Brother Tim’s very breath cadence… what he breathed in and out… In….”Love!”….Out….”conquers all!” Dr. Tim’s favorite prayer: The Memorare. More of Dr. Tim isms…“Another Day in Paradise” “Kumbaya” “Ya Old Goat!” “God Help us!” Dr. Tim isms while Pulling Teeth: – That’s a Bearcat! – That’s Momma’s milk – Dear Jesus Guide my hands – Dear Baby Jesus… “I can’t do what you can do, you can’t do what I can do but together we can accomplish great things!” Forty years ago, Tim experienced a miracle of being the first person in history to survive a ‘Hangman’s Fracture of his neck… not only surviving, but actually recovering from initially being a quadriplegic to walking out of the hospital with no deficit. This occurred when Tim went on his first date with his (now) wife, Catalina, when he was celebrating getting accepted into Creighton Dental School with a group of his friends, some of whom continued to pray with him daily by group phone from around the country because of how this miracle had changed their lives, spawning faith and more miracles. Tim was born December 21, 1955 in Newton, Iowa. He was the sixth in a family of 13 children, half of which had a congenital bone breaking syndrome called OI, Osteogenesis Imperfecta, and they sustained hundreds of bone fractures. This curtailed the very sports oriented activities which included martial arts, boxing, and military marching taught and led by their father, Luke Lukavsky. Instead they gravitated to singing and playing instruments and acting out their American and European folk music and musicals with choreography. First they sang in their hospital beds with the injured child, then for the doctors and staff, then medical conventions, pediatrics, nursing homes, churches, civic organizations, and pro-life conventions. Tim was one of the 10 children that went on to perform professionally as the “Lukavsky Family Singers” often known as The “American Von Trapps”. Tim sang with a beautiful, unique, heartfelt wide baritone range. He also played bass viol, guitar, and performed dance and choreography. They produced syndicated television holiday specials that played all over the country. In their performing, they sang for and encountered, many times, legends for the unborn and pro-life movement like Dr. Mildred Jefferson, the first black female to graduate from Harvard Medical School and became the second President of National Right to Life. And Dr. (and Mrs) Willke, who was a physician, author, and the first President of the National Right to Life organization. They sang for Ronald Reagan when he was yet making a run for President of the United States. And they heckled then antilife Senators Ed Kennedy and Birch Bye during their failed attempts to run for President of the United States. They also visited and stayed with Maria Von Trapp (from the Sound of Music) at her Chalet in Stowe, Vermont… Christmas caroled in a horse drawn sleigh over mountains for neighboring chalets, sang for her guests, and prayed with Maria. Dr. Tim was honored for his mission work by the AADMD, American Academy of Developmental Medicine and Dentistry, an organization of dentists and doctors for the disabled. It was cofounded by Dr. Steve Pearlman and Eunice Kennedy Shriver who was credited with starting Special Olympics. Dr. Tim was asked to be speaker (which I got to join him as speaker and as singer) at their conventions in Princeton, New Jersey, and Los Angeles, CA, for their National meetings occurring with the World Special Olympics. Dr. Tim was preceded in death by parents, Luke and Mary Lukavsky. Also joining are his brothers in heaven, Chris and Tom Lukavsky, and sisters, Nancy Dodds and the youngest, Kathleen Lukavsky, who excelled with “Ups Syndrome”. Siblings left behind are sister, Joanie Lukavsky, late brother, Chris’s four children, John Sherman, Rose Kerns and her four children Alex, Anna, Cameron, and Owen, and late sister, Nancy’s husband, Bob Dodds and their two children, Emily and William in Des Moines, IA, sister Mary Jane Nydegger, her two children, daughter Kristinna Young (husband Eric and children Nick and Rowan in Portland, Oregon), and Jessyca MacDonald (husband Ryan), myself, Dr. James Lukavsky (Dr. Luke), wife Angela with our five children, Mary Watson (husband Josh, four children, Ava, Jude, Noah, and Sophie, son Chris (wife Trista, children, Addilyn, Lincoln, and Lila, son David (wife Meghan, children, Kathleen and yet unborn baby, daughter Michelle (husband Police Officer, Sergeant Steve Purdy, children, Lauren, Lawrence, and Leia, and our daughter Anna Underwood (husband Carson and yet unborn baby in Nixa MO area. Dr. Tim’s other living siblings: sister, Terry Wiese in Omaha, NE, and their six children, Aaron, Amanda Riskowski (husband Anthony), Joseph, John Paul, Daniel, and Timmy all in Omaha, NE, sister Patty Schwanebeck (husband Cris) in Knoxville, IA, and their Five Children, Sarah Neary (husband, Andy, children Rowen and Albae in Tiffin, IA, Katie Keller (husband Keith, child Sonora in New Jersey), Elizabeth Kingery (husband Kyle in Knoxville, IA), and daughter Aubrey Moats (husband Jacob, child Nora in Knoxville, IA), son Cris Patrick in San Diego, CA, sister, Julie Mow (Arly Richau) in Scottsdale, AZ, sister Paula Wilson (children, Meaghan, Josh, and Seth in West Des Moines, IA, sister, Caroline Meade (husband Russ, daughter, Mary Kate in Tiffin, IA). It should be noted that Dr. Tim, having been seen for his ALS by Mayo clinic in Scottsdale and the Barrow Neurological Institute, he and I, supported by our daily prayer warriors all across the country, attempted other alternative treatments for his ALS. Dr. Pearlman, who is cofounder of the AADMD, also prayed for us and wanted to offer any help he could. Drs. Betty Ann and Jay Schmidt helped guide a plan of IV therapies that Dr. Tim’s family and Dr. Rick Feldtake went to the mat to provide. Son, Dr. Michael Lukavsky and Dr. Tom Mattern helped Dr. Tim get alternative IV infusions and Laser therapy. Dr. Steven Harkins, suffering from ALS, himself, never stopped helping Dr. Tim with new ideas and ways of mitigating the effects of the disease. And many, many friends, family, faculty, and prior students raised much money utilizing Go Fund Me and other avenues so that Dr. Tim could afford these expensive alternative measures. Dr. Jay Lombard, neurologist and world renown ALS guru in New York City, has tirelessly continued to strive and work for a reasonable treatment or cure for ALS in spite of the lack of hope amongst the medical establishment. With the help of his friend, Rabbi Noson Gurary, introduced us to Dr. Marc Abreu from Yale University who pioneered Heat Shock Therapy and gallantly treated Dr. Tim with this in Miami, Florida last July, resulting in some improvement of his swallowing, speech, and strength, which is considered scientifically impossible. Though it was not a cure, I believe it extended Dr. Tim’s quantity and quality of life. Dr. Lombard then introduced us to Dr. Scott Rosa, of Connecticut, who introduced us to neurosurgeon, Dr. Kornell, of NYC. They consulted and were willing to attempt to fix Dr. Tim’s spinal drainage problem related to his old neck damage from the Hangman’s Fracture. The theory was given to Dr. Lombard when he drove out to discuss it with its brilliant author, the 86-year-old inventor of the MRI, Dr. Raymond Damadian, living on Long Island, just a few miles from where Dr. Lombard’s mother was buried. And he, unexpectedly, was able to stop to pray and cry a tear for her before he and I agreed with this simple theory that no ALS treatment could work and maintain success until Dr. Tim’s spinal fluid toilet (Spinal Glymphatics) could be fixed and flushing again. I still have hopes that this theory will work and help ALS patients in the future! We were just scheduling the necessary diagnostic testing when Dr. Tim suffered a severe aspiration and choking on 12/16/21, and was saved from hypoxia and death by the valiant deep suctioning intervention of Catalina’s ICU RN sister, Gloria Kisicki. After the resulting aspiration pneumonia and hospitalization, Dr. Tim then made a definitive decision to stop all testing and attempts for cure. I had to accept and agree with his dignity to change gears and goals. His goal changed to just be at home around family and literally to go home in God’s timing. Dr. Tim must have known something none of us did, because just hours after getting home from Banner Hospital under the diligent, wise, and loving care of beautiful Hospice of the Valley professionals, Dr. Tim’s beautiful heart beat it’s last. And he went home to live with the Heavenly Father.\n\nJames J. McCormick Jr., DO, ’65, Boca Raton, Florida, died Nov. 21, 2021, at age 83. He was a man of strong faith, honest, generous, loving and kind to everyone he met. He was known to most as “Jim” and “Doc” by others.\n\nDr. McCormick was born in Miami, Florida and was a talented opera singer throughout his school years. He graduated from the University of Miami and decided to follow in his father’s footsteps and become a doctor. He attended ATSU-KCOM in Missouri and later became a resident at Detroit Osteopathic Hospital in Detroit, Michigan. He met Patricia Hanes while in residency and married her on August 5, 1966. Dr. McCormick and Pat moved to Miami, Florida so that they could begin their new life together.\n\nHe was a doctor of osteopathic medicine and specialized in family medicine. He served the citizens of Miami, as well as neighboring islands for 52 years. His love for his patients was known to all and unparalleled. He could be found going on “house calls” when a patient was unable to come into the office. He was more than just a doctor to his patients; he was a friend.\n\nHe was a wonderful husband and father. He loved his wife Pat and his children with all his heart. He left a legacy of four children: Jim, Tricia, Annmarie, and Margie; twelve grandchildren: Cassie, Alicia, Allie, Gabe, Josh, Ryan, Asher, Riley, Brady, Landon, Samantha, and Patrick; and one great-grandson Max.\n\nDr. McCormick was a truly blessed and talented man. He was an amazing singer, trusted physician, and known as “The Big Fix-it” around the house. There was nothing he could not do or create, including an actual, physical train, that children could ride in and was even displayed in parades. He loved working with wood and model trains. He lived a life of love, peace, and faith. His motto was “peace and love,” and he taught his family about forgiveness and love of God. He will be greatly missed by all who have known and loved him.\n\nJoseph L. McTernan, DHSc, ’15, Orchard Park, New York, died Jan. 24, 2022, at age 44. He leaves behind his beloved wife of 8 years, Anna (Solveno) McTernan; and their children, Emmett, Ethan, Evan and Ella. Joe is survived by his mother, Theresa McTernan; and siblings, Brian (Edie) McTernan, Patti (Joe) McTernan Weber, Roy (Vicky) McTernan, Cathy DeLuca, and Colleen (George) Ryall; as well as his adored nieces and nephew. Dr. McTernan’s life was devoted to being a teacher and a leader, committed to the support of his community. A native of Rockland County, he began his life of service as a firefighter, then EMT, and paramedic in New York City; he spoke proudly and often of his first responder service and it was during that time he met his wife Anna. Dr. McTernan achieved a Doctorate in Business and Healthcare Administration and worked for NY Presbyterian Hospital and Trinitas Medical Center before joining Wyoming County Community Health System as their Chief Executive Officer in 2019.\n\nGregory J. McWilliams, DO, ’74, Tulsa, Oklahoma, died March 3, 2021, at age 72. He was preceded in death by his parents, E. Anne and Charles A. McWilliams; and his former wife Pamela Brewer McWilliams. He was born May 4, 1948 in Holdenville, Oklahoma and moved with his parents and younger brother, Chip, to Broken Arrow, Oklahoma in 1952. Dr. McWilliams graduated from Broken Arrow High School in 1966. He then attended the University of Oklahoma as a pre-med student where he earned a bachelor’s degree in History in 1970.\n\nHis interest in becoming a doctor took him to ATSU-KCOM in Kirksville, Missouri where he graduated in 1974. After completing his course work, residency, and board certification, Dr. McWilliams was awarded a Fellowship at the Cleveland Clinic where he trained in a relatively new subspecialty called Interventional Cardiovascular Medicine. His 44 years in medicine were anchored in Tulsa where he opened his Cardiology practice in 1980. Dr. McWilliams’ long and successful career was mainly at Saint Francis Hospital, Tulsa; but, also at Oklahoma Osteopathic Hospital and St. John’s, Broken Arrow. The last 5 years of his career he spent as a Cardiologist at Tahlequah City Hospital.\n\nSurvivors include his son, Zachary Brewer McWilliams (Sara Beard); his brothers Dr. Charles A. McWilliams (Cindy) and Mr. J. Scott McWilliams, J.D., his sister Jean Ann McWilliams Foley, Ph.D. (Gary Cole), and 5 nieces and nephews, Aaron McWilliams (Elizabeth), Meredith Bollinger (John), Molly Hey (Brandon), Heidi McWilliams, and Mykaila DeLesDerenier (Matt).\n\nBesides being a treasured physician who took great pains to listen to his patients and provide excellent medical care, Dr. McWilliams had a ferocious love for life. He was constantly delving deep into classical history and searching for truth. This is notable in his faithful attendance and participation in a downtown Bible study over the past 2 years. His captivating stories, impressive escapades and travels, greathearted gatherings for family and friends will be sorely missed. His colorful and exuberant life was highlighted by a large loyal fan base who will continue to ride the crest of his wave retelling, re-living and embellishing Mac’s stories.\n\nBarbara S. Murphey, AuD, ’04, Plano, Texas, died Dec. 30, 2020.\n\nJames P. Parshall, DO, ’56, Hendersonville, North Carolina, died Dec. 3, 2020, at age 95, four and a half years short of his goal of 100 years. At 95, he was still shopping, cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, caretaking for his wife and driving – to everyone’s dismay. Dr. Parshall was resilient. Were it not for COVID-19, he might have met his goal. He was born on June 25, 1925 in Detroit, the only child of Raymond and Nica (Petchell) Parshall. He always said his birthday was the perfect day for gifts because it was exactly half-way to Christmas. They lived in a one-bedroom apartment in Detroit where he slept on a cot in the kitchen. He was a child during the Great Depression and he told the story of how he brought a friend home after school and together they smeared all the butter allotted for a week on saltines and ate them. His mother, when she returned from work, was furious. With both parents working, Dr. Parshall spent a lot of time on his own. He began to stutter at age 3 when his mother went back to work and he was left with an aunt. At age nine, his English teacher told him about Shady Trails camp in northern Michigan, a place dedicated to speech correction. He told her his parents couldn’t afford it. The next day, she let him know that an anonymous benefactor would pay the camp fee for him to go to Shady Trails. He always thought she, a single woman without children, was that benefactor. The family later moved to Clawson, where at 125 pounds, and with great energy and determination, he played on the high school football team. Many decades later, at age 88, he named himself Class Secretary and sent annual newsletters to his high school classmates which included obituaries, updates, health information and crossword puzzles. He’d photocopy, assemble and mail the tomes in large envelopes to each surviving classmate. Also in high school, Dr. Parshall began his life-long love affair with books. His pages-long Christmas letters, complete with book suggestions, were legendary.\n\nHe served as a lieutenant in the Air Force during World War II before attending Albion College where he joined and then quickly deactivated from a fraternity after learning they didn’t accept Blacks into membership. At Albion, he met Joanne Sluyter, his first wife, mother of the children he was so proud of and with whom he had a lifelong friendship. After marrying, they moved to Kirksville, Mo. where he attended medical school. Upon returning to Mich., he served his internship and residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology at Garden City Osteopathic Hospital and later served there as Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. In Plymouth, Dr. Parshall and Joanne built their family: three sons, two daughters, and always a dog. Then in 1973, the family moved to Silver Lake in Traverse City, where he served as Chairman of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of Traverse City Osteopathic Hospital. Additionally, he held the position of Assistant Clinical Professor at Michigan State’s College of Osteopathic Medicine, and between 1984 and 1986, he taught midwives at the Frontier Nursing Service in Hyden, Kentucky. Babies come at all hours of the day, so he spent his career years sleep -deprived. Professionally, he was a physician, healer, counselor, educator, and life-long learner. Enthused by new ways of delivering healthcare, like the Leboyer Method of birthing and Lamaze, he was responsible for the birthing rooms at Traverse City Osteopathic Hospital where women could give birth in rooms with low lighting and warm colors that simulated a home environment. He always spent extra time with his patients to help them make healthcare choices, and this meant he always ran behind schedule. Most patients didn’t mind; they knew they’d also get extra time. He was also the neighbor hood go-to doctor and sometimes first responder; once helping a burn victim from a boat explosion, another time a young girl hit by a car. When last minute physicals were required in order to play school football, he offered them to the neighborhood kids for free. Dr. Parshall was an optimist, a believer that determination and goodwill could overcome most obstacles. More than once he launched the family boat into Silver Lake directly from the front yard. He’d back up further and further until the motor home he used to pull the boat trailer became stuck in the lake. At that point he’d phone Ward-Eaton Towing to come pull the flooded motor home out of the lake. It would take the whole summer for the lawn to recover from the churn of giant tow truck tires. The neighbors looked forward to Dr. Parshall’s boat launching day. One even made a cake for the event. However, front yard boat launching ended when Ward-Eaton told him they would no longer facilitate the annual rescue. He was warm and friendly. He loved his family and friends and children’s friends who considered him a favorite. He loved camping at Timber Shores, stamp collecting, bookstores and ice cream. Dr. Parshall adored Traverse City and was so looking forward to moving back to be close to his family. It was to happen later in December.\n\nIn 1994, he married Carole Maxwell in Livonia, who survives. Together they enjoyed travelling, cruises, and church activities. They spent their retirement years living in Hendersonville, North Carolina. Dr. Parshall is survived by his wife, Carole; his children David Parshall, Nancy (David Bedford) Parshall, Douglas (Paula) Parshall, Daniel Parshall, Susan Hooper; and Carole’s daughter Christy (Barry Waite) Maxwell; his brother-in-law, Michael (Elaine Foster) Loukinen. He is also survived by seven grandchildren, Bryan, Corey, Dylan and Emily Parshall, and Jared, Logan, and Salle Waite; ten great-grandchildren; his beloved rescue dog, Lucy; and many friends. He was predeceased by his parents; his first wife, Joanne Kline; his son-in-law, Kevin Hooper; and Carole’s son, Marty Maxwell.\n\nRobert L. Perry, DO, ’54, Redmond, Washington, died Jan. 11, 2021, at age 92. He was an only child and was born on July 4, 1928 to Leo and Dorothy Perry of Spokane. He married the love of his life, Burrita Gongwer, on August 26, 1952. They met in high school while skiing at Mt. Spokane. Burrita preceded him in death on September 25, 2019. He is survived by five children– Dr. Laura Perry, Jody Menenberg, Robin Hale, Scott Perry and Susie Paulsen as well as sixteen grandchildren.\n\nDr. Perry and Burrita raised their family on the shores of Lake Burien and resided there for 60 years. His birthday celebration coincided with the July 4 holiday and was the source of an annual family get together. He loved his house and the lawn he kept as meticulously manicured as the greens of Rainier Golf and Country Club, where he belonged for fifty years. He also enjoyed skiing and hiking with his family, planning many backpacking trips into Holden Village in the North Cascades.\n\nDr. Perry graduated from Gonzaga University then received his DO degree from ATSU-KCOM, in 1954. He was on the staff of Highline and Riverton Hospitals, serving as chief of staff at Riverton. He practiced family medicine for 50 years. Dr. Laura Perry joined his practice in 1983 and they worked together for 25 years. With a blend of compassion and a wry sense of humor, Dr. Perry put his patients at ease and gained their lasting trust. His reward was to be woven into the fabric of so many lives, to share in the laughter and the tears of generations of families. He was an old school family doctor. He will be missed.\n\nHon. James R. Reinhard, Hannibal, Missouri, died Nov. 11, 2021, at age 92. He was born July 7, 1929, in Pollock, MO, the only child of Virgil and Meltha (Anspach) Reinhard. He attended grade school in Pollock and graduated from Milan High School in 1947. Judge Reinhard attended Northeast Missouri State Teacher’s College in the summer of 1947. At that time Missouri did not require a college degree of teachers and he taught a one-room rural school in southern Sullivan County. At the end of that school term, he re-entered Northeast Missouri State Teacher’s College and remained there until the end of the spring term in 1950. In the fall of 1950, he enrolled in the School of Law at the University of Missouri in Columbia. He was dually enrolled, taking some courses in the School of Arts and Science. He received his BA degree from the University in the summer of 1951, and his LLB degree from the School of Law in spring of 1953. Judge Reinhard was admitted to the Missouri Bar on September 5, 1953. On August 10, 1953, he was inducted into the United States Army. He received an honorable discharge from the Army on June 10, 1955.\n\nJudge Reinhard was elected Prosecuting Attorney of Sullivan County on the Democratic ticket in the general election of 1954. His Republican opponent had withdrawn after the primary. The rules and regulations of the United States Army permitted him to file for office while on active duty, but he was prohibited from active campaigning. He appointed M. E. Montgomery as assistant prosecuting attorney and he served until his term in the Army ended. While in the Army, Judge Reinhard served as a court administrator. Upon returning to Sullivan County after his discharge, he began the general practice of law, in addition to being prosecuting attorney. Judge Reinhard was re-elected to the prosecutor’s office in 1956 and 1958. At the 9th Congressional District caucus in 1956, Judge Reinhard was selected as an alternate delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. There he met a member of the 9th District Congressional Committee who urged him to move to Monroe County, MO. In May 1957, he resigned as Prosecuting Attorney of Sullivan County and opened an office for the general practice of law in Paris, MO. In 1958, Judge Reinhard sought the office of Prosecuting Attorney of Monroe County and won a contested primary by a two to one margin. In 1960, he was selected as one of two Sergeant at Arms representing Missouri at the Democratic Convention in Los Angles.\n\nIn December 1958, Judge Reinhard married Shari L. Powell Horton. In 1962, he was joined in the law practice by Floyd E. Lawson. The firm continued until the end of December 1972, when Judge Reinhard became Circuit Judge. While in active practice, Judge Reinhard served as President of the Tenth Judicial Circuit Bar Association and as a member and chairman of the Tenth Circuit Bar ethics committee. He served two terms on the Board of Governors of the Missouri Bar Association. He served as a special assistant attorney general on Attorney General Norman Anderson’s staff. As a member of the Paris Rotary Club, Judge Reinhard served two terms as President. In 1964, Judge Reinhard was selected by Senator Symington to serve as general chairman of his campaign opening which was to be held in Monroe County. The event was held at Mark Twain State Park and was attended by all of the state officials. It drew a crowd of about 5,000 people and was certainly the largest political gathering ever held in Monroe County. In 1965, Governor Hearnes appointed Judge Reinhard to the Board of Regents at Northeastern Missouri State Teacher’s College and re-appointed him in 1970. Judge Reinhard served as president of the Board of Regents from 1967 to 1973. He resigned as a member of the board in 1974. During Judge Reinhard’s board tenure he served on the advisory Committee to the Missouri Commission Higher Education. He was the only non-education professional on the committee and the only state board member to be on the committee. From 1982 to 1985, Judge Reinhard served on the Board of Trustees of ATSU-KCOM. In late 1972, Elgin Fuller resigned as judge of the Tenth Judicial Circuit and Governor Warren E. Hearnes appointed Judge Reinhard to succeed him. He was sworn in on January 1, 1973, and the family moved to Hannibal in June, 1973. Judge Reinhard was elected to serve the unexpired term at the general election in November of 1974, and re-elected to a full six-year term in 1976. Judge Reinhard was unopposed in both elections. While circuit judge, he served on the legislative committee of the Missouri Trial Judges Association and the legislative committee of the Missouri Juvenile Judges Committee. On March 4, 1977, he was appointed by Governor Joe Teasdale as a judge on the Missouri Court of Appeals, Eastern District. The office of the Court of Appeals at that time was in the Civil Courts building in St. Louis and initially Judge Reinhard’s office was in that building. He served as Chief Judge of the court in 1984 and 1985. Judge Reinhard was extremely proud of the fact that during his tenure on the court he authored more opinions than any other appellate judge in the history of the State. He sat as a special judge on the Missouri Supreme Court at several times and also on numerous occasions as a special judge on both the Western and Southern District Courts of Appeal. Judge Reinhard sat as a special judge on the Missouri Supreme Court in September, 1988, when the Nancy Cruzan case was decided. The case involved the removal of Ms. Cruzan’s feeding tube. Court historians rate this case as one of the most important cases in the history of the state. While on the Court of Appeals, in addition to his regular duties, Judge Reinhard was appointed by the Supreme Court to serve on two of its most important committees, serving as Vice Chairman of the Board of Court Reporters (the committee charged with giving the tests to qualify court reporters); and, also as chairman of the Missouri Judicial Finance Commission. This seven-member commission settled financial disputes between the circuit courts of the state and the county Commission who finances the courts. In 1992, Judge Reinhard mediated a dispute between the circuit judges of the City of St. Louis and the city. In the mediation, the City Board of Adjustment, Mayor Vince Schoemehl, Board of Alderman President Tom Villa, and city Comptroller Jim Jones represented the city. The court had ordered the city to make $65,000,000.00 in repairs and improvements to the Civil Courts Building. On appeal to the Supreme Court, the City contested the jurisdiction of the finance committee over capital improvements. The Supreme Court disagreed and gave the commission fifteen days to settle the case. The mediation was held in Judge Reinhard’s office and resulted in a $35,000,000.00 settlement. He also served for several years on the National Committee of the Supreme Court and Appellate Judges whose purpose is to inform appellate courts across the country of the problems in juvenile cases that appellate courts review. Programs were given at appellate judges’ seminars and state judicial conferences. In 1997, Judge Reinhard retired from the court and became “of counsel” to the Law Firm of Briscoe and Mobley (later Briscoe, Rodenbaugh and Brannon). After leaving that firm he served as a “Senior Judge” on the courts of Appeals of the Eastern and Western Districts for a number of years. In 2000, the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis designated by resolution, in appreciation for his efforts in securing a fair and reasonable settlement between the city of St. Louis and the court in the matter of renovating the Civil Courts Building, “…this court does hereby designate the court ‘en banc room’ as the James R. Reinhard Room.” This room is on the 12th floor of the Civil Courts Building and was the courtroom of the Missouri Court of Appeals for many years. It is now used as the meeting room of the members of the entire circuit court.\n\nJudge Reinhard was a member and elder of the Presbyterian Church. He was also a member of the Masonic Lodge, the York Rite, Scottish Rite and Shrine. He has served as a Trustee of the Missouri Historical Society and the Truman State University Foundation board.\n\nJudge Reinhard is survived by his wife, Shari, and son, James K.

Smith, DO, ’62, Pantego, Texas, died June 2, 2020, at age 85. Dr. Smith was born in Capshaw, Alabama on January 3, 1935 to Garland M. and Bell Spencer Smith. He was the youngest of six children of cotton farming parents. He did not graduate from high school, but enlisted in the USAF at age 17 and subsequently completed his GED. During his four year commitment, he was a medic, which led to his desire to become a physician. That is when he met the love of his life, Shirley Louise Lee of Iowa Park, TX. They eloped on December 29, 1953 while she was a senior in high school.\n\nHis desire to become a doctor led him to Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, TX where he received his undergraduate degree in pre-med.
