        "text": "After a lengthy illness stemming from rheumatoid arthritis, Rachel Marie (Higgins) Leihbacher passed away on May 29th 2023.\n\nBorn June 12th, 1962 in Manchester New Hampshire, Rachel is survived by her husband Tom, son Tommy (Jordan,) granddaughter Sloane, twin sister Martha (Bruce Ferguson,) brother Andrew, sister in-law Lore, nephew Geoffrey (Mei-Lan) and niece Alexis (Seth Coen) nephews Ian (Catie) and Tyler, brother in-law Doug (Wendy) brother in-law Bob (Pam) nieces Alana, Kaylee and nephew Adam. She was predeceased by her father (The Reverend George B. Higgins,) mother (Marie) and older brothers David and Jonathan.\n\nRachel was raised in Dalton Massachusetts, graduating from Wahconah Regional High School in 1980. After high school, she attended Bay Path University in Longmeadow Massachusetts. At the time of her graduation, her father had become the pastor of The Briarcliff Congregational Church, which brought her to Westchester County to pursue her career as a medical assistant.\n\nRachelâ€™s work became her calling. She was beloved by patients and doctors alike. She also happily dispensed medical advice to family and friends almost every day and was well known as an expert medical diagnostician.\n\nIn 1980, Rachel, along with her friend Debbie Johnson became the first female members of the Briarcliff Manor Volunteer Fire Department where she further put her medical arts to use as a member of the Briarcliff Manor Volunteer Ambulance Corps. Her dedication was unparalleled receiving special honors one year for answering over 500 ambulance calls.\n\nRachel was also well known for her many involvements at church and throughout the Briarcliff community. If her work was her calling, her passion was giving. For her, no day was complete without doing something to give back. Born with the heart of a volunteer, her way of serving God was by serving others. Through it all, she helped make the world a better place each day.\n\nIn 2008, she (along with Tom) received honors from the Briarcliff Manor Educational Foundation and were given Rachel and Tom Leihbacher Day by proclamation of the State of New York.\n\nShe loved her friends and family deeply and maintained a singular level of devotion to them. In particular, she was fiercely dedicated to her son and his unique medical needs.\n\nHer favorite things included visiting her family home on Cape Cod, dinners on the Grill Patio at Sleepy Hollow Country Club, participating in Fire Department parades and being with her granddaughter.\n\nA funeral service will be held at Chillmark Park 48 Macy Road Briarcliff Manor, NY 10510 on June 16th at 3:00 PM. The family is inviting business casual attire. A reception will follow immediately after on the grounds. Rachel will be interred at a private service the next morning in North Adams, MA.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family is recommending donations to The Briarcliff Manor Volunteer Fire Department.\n\nWATERBURY & KELLY FUNERAL HOME\n\n1300 Pleasantville Road\n\nBriarcliff Manor, New York 10510\n\n914-941-0838"
