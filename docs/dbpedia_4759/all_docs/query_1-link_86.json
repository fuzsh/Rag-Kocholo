        "text": "\"He is smoking dope basically on that one, he really is, that's an outrageous comment to make.\"\n\nMr Key \"can think what he wants\" but the Prime Minister \"didn't really take much interest in the organisation as far as I was aware of while I was there\".\n\nSir Bruce said the process by which Mr Fletcher was appointed was not up to scratch because he was the only candidate interviewed. That was after Mr Key and State Services Commissioner Iain Rennie discarded four other applicants, including some with the high-level intelligence and defence experience which Sir Bruce believed was necessary for the role.\n\nHe confirmed he had read Ms Kitteridge's draft report which was \"definitely\" not critical of the way the GCSB was run under former directors who came from a military or intelligence background, \"and I said to Rebecca I didn't have any problems with it and she knows that\".\n\nMr Key, who is in China, did not respond to Sir Bruce's \"smoking dope\" comment, but told the Herald last night: \"The report's going to be released in the very near future when I return to New Zealand and I think people will be able to read it and draw their own conclusions.\"\n\nSir Bruce said the report \"goes through cultural issues\" at the bureau which he discussed with Ms Kitteridge. He said those issues arose from the way the bureau operated on a \"compartmentalised\" or \"need-to-know basis\" where personnel didn't tell each other about their work.\n\nMs Kitteridge was seconded to the GCSB to conduct an inquiry after it emerged that the bureau had been illegally spying on internet tycoon Kim Dotcom.\n\nMr Key, who initially said he learned of the illegal spying in September, later said the operation was briefly referred to during a GCSB briefing he attended months earlier.\n\nSenior sources have told the Herald that the person suspected of leaking information to Labour about that briefing - including claims Mr Key was not only briefed about the Dotcom surveillance, but joked about it - had been identified and had now \"lawyered up\".\n\nIf the report establishes a leak, the GCSB's legislation carries a penalty of up to two years in prison."
