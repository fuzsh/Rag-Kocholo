        "text": "As time dulls memories, we can often forget the contributions of our heroes to the beautiful game.\n\nSome managers today were once greats on the pitch but seeing them so regularly on the touchline makes the images of their glorious on-field triumphs fade in our minds.\n\nSteve Bruce has been sacked as manager of West Brom as an unhappy fanbase contiually made their feelings known.\n\nIt could see him end his managerial career, especially after a troubled time at his previous job with Newcastle United.\n\nOnce one of the finest centre-backs in England, he's found himself targeted by abusive supporters.\n\nHe told the Telegraph in 2021: “By the time I got to Newcastle, I thought I could handle everything thrown at me but it has been very, very tough.\n\n“To never really be wanted, to feel that people wanted me to fail, to read people constantly saying I would fail, that I was useless, a fat waste of space, a stupid, tactically inept cabbage-head or whatever.\"\n\nIt's something no manager deserves, especially one who has coached at 11 clubs since the end of his playing career.\n\nThe memories of his days on the pitch are sometimes just a distant fleck in the rear view mirror.\n\nBruce, though, was a three-time Premier League winner with Manchester United as they began their dominance of English football in the 1990s.\n\nNot only that, he was a leader for the legendary Sir Alex Ferguson, also helping the club to three FA Cup wins and a League Cup, a Cup Winners' Cup, and a European Super Cup.\n\nAnd his 96th minute winner for the Red Devils against Sheffield Wednesday in April 1993 even gave birth to the term 'Fergie Time'.\n\nAppearances can be deceiving, especially 21 years since his on-field exertions ended in 1999 during a one-season player-manager spell at Sheffield United.\n\nBruce wasn't easily definable as defender, perhaps going someway to explaining why he was never awarded an England cap and why many clubs turned him down as a youngster.\n\nA Premier League champion and Old Trafford skipper should have been a shoo-in for international honours, although Sir Bobby Robson later apologised for overlooking him.\n\nInstead, in what should be an inspiration to many, his effort and leadership helped fire him up the divisions, while being calm and composed in possession of the ball marked him out as a top star.\n\nHe was occasionally a little rambunctious, but at the end of it all, Bruce put his body on the line for every point, once opting to play for United despite being in need of a hernia operation as an injury crisis enveloped Fergie's backline.\n\nAhead of a game with Liverpool he even told his boss to hold off naming his team to allow him time to prove his fitness, despite hobbling around The Cliff training ground for a week prior to the clash.\n\nHe was also a goalscorer. A really good one.\n\nSergio Ramos' goalscoring from centre-back in recent years, with the help of an excellent penalty technique, has many enthralled.\n\nHis 13 goals in 2019/20 had fans cooing around the globe, but Bruce can top that and in 1990/91 he managed a frankly outrageous 19 in all competitions.\n\nThat season he was United's joint-top league scorer, alongside Brian McClair, with 13, while four other strikes helped the club in their quest for Cup Winners' Cup glory.\n\nThey're all a mixture too. Famed for his ability to head the ball, despite Bruce only standing 6ft tall, his courageous nature allowed him to dominate the penalty area, crashing into opponents before thudding home.\n\nFormer teammate Paul Parker attests to that reckless abandon: \"Nothing frightened Brucie.\n\n\"Nothing was impossible. He had more determination than anyone. He won more headers at 6ft than the average centre back at 6ft 4in, and it wasn't always easy - you could tell the cost by looking at his nose.\"\n\nHe was happy as a poacher in the area too, one goal against Leeds United in 1992 saw him barge McClair out of the way to slam into the net from six yards.\n\nOh, and you know we mentioned his quality in possession? He also managed 18 assists during his spell at Old Trafford, not half bad.\n\nAnd penalties, well, he walked back to the edge of the 'D' turned around and, straight as an arrow, ran at the ball, and into the corner it went. Goalkeepers barely stood a chance, whether it was Arsenal's David Seaman, Liverpool's Bruce Grobbelaar, or Tottenham's Erik Thorstvedt.\n\nBruno Fernandes and Jorginho could learn a thing or two - no hops, skips, or jumps.\n\nIt didn't all come easily at the beginning for Bruce at United and it was a step up from Norwich City: “The difficult change was walking into the dressing room and seeing the likes of Bryan Robson, Norman Whiteside, Gordan Strachan, Jesper Olson, and of course, I’m sitting next to Paul McGrath,\" he told Sky Sports.\n\n“After training with him for just two days, I was like ‘Oh my gosh, am I supposed to be replacing him?’\n\n“He is absolutely unbelievable. Unfortunately, Paul was dogged with injuries and didn’t maybe play enough. But, you know, he went to Aston Villa, trained on a bike, and I think he won their Player of the Year four times.\n\n\"It was the enormity of playing for Manchester United. There's no such thing as playing a friendly if you play for United - everybody wants to beat you. The enormity of it - from back pages to front pages - and the increased demand on you was instant.\n\n\"That is the big thing that a lot of players have to come to terms with quickly, as it can quite easily swallow you up. Fortunately for myself, I thought, 'I've worked 10 years to get here, I'm going to give it my best shot and I wouldn't be daunted or put off by it because it's been a long road to get here'. I was determined to see it through.\"\n\nBruce never shied away from a battle, and that goes for off the field too, even if it did earn him a clump and a black eye.\n\nArsenal legend Ian Wright revealed: \"We were at Old Trafford and I always tried to run off of Brucie and to be fair he always played me pretty well. He always got me booked so I had to try and be a little bit calmer.\n\n\"At Old Trafford the tunnel is down that end, me and Brucie are having a little tete-a-tete and then he’s gone ‘right that’s it you, I’ll see you in the tunnel’. The whistle goes and then you have to run down there and he bangs into my shoulder. I knew Brucie was going to get me.\n\n\"The problem I had was Tony Adams and Bouldy were already too close to the end so I had no back-up. The biggest guys have gone in. I tried to run down the tunnel really quickly but Brucie was waiting for me, fist clenched, standing there.\n\n\"I played possum. I said ‘what’s happening man, you know how it is?’ But all the time I was talking as I got closer to him I thought I’m in arm’s shot here and as he put his hands down I went bang right in his face.\n\n\"I then ran off and it all kicked off in the tunnel. Afterwards I went straight on the coach but Dicko [Lee Dixon] and Bouldy said afterwards they went in the lounge and the doors opened up and Bruce said ‘where is he?’ But I was already sitting on the coach.\n\n\"I spoke to Incey, we shared rooms with England. He phoned me on the Sunday morning and said ‘you’re bang out of order you’ve got to phone him’. I said sorry to him and told him my stepdad told me ‘if you’re smaller you’ve got to get the first punch in’.\"\n\nGoalscorer, leader, battler, oh, and author too.\n\nBruce, during his tenure as manager of Huddersfield back in 1999, penned three books - Striker!, Sweeper! and Defender!\n\nThe theme you ask? A murder mystery solving football manager of Leddersfield Town. His name? Steve Barnes.\n\nQueried about his alternative career in 2018, he replied: \"It was a long time ago, and I'm not sure I want to be reminded of how bad they were.\n\n\"Just because I got a GCSE in English, I thought I was going to be the next Dick Francis. It didn't make any contribution at all to anyone's income.\n\n\"It became a laughing stock, to be honest. I think they're probably still on the shelves somewhere, and I bet you could probably pick one up for 99p.\"\n\nBruce's football contribution for Manchester United though was absolutely priceless."
