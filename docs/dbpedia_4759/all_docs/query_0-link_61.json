        "text": "Hudson’s Bay Company Archives - Biographical Sheets\n\nSearch for employee biographical sheets for individuals who worked for Hudsons Bay Company and/or the North West Company. Please note that these information sheets have not been created for all former employees.\n\nBiographical sheets provide a good starting point for research but are not a comprehensive source of information on an individual; there may be other related records in the HBCA holdings. The information included in the biographical sheets has been derived from HBCA records and other sources; however, verification of facts against the original or microfilmed records is advisable.\n\nEmployee biographical sheets are organized alphabetically by surname. Spellings of names may vary.\n\nPlease note that the dates attached to each individual refer their birth (b.), death (d.), approximate dates (ca.) and/or the period during which the person was active in the HBC (fl.). For a more detailed explanation of the biographical information sheets, please see The Biographical Sheet Revealed (PDF)."
