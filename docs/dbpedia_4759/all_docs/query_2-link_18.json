        "text": "This new community project is underway!\n\nTawa Rotary is funding the development cost of a labyrinth as a gift to Tawa to recognise Rotaryâs 50 year presence in Tawa. The idea for a labyrinth was one that came from the community. We heard that people were looking for a quiet place to spend time quietly reflecting on life, similar to labyrinths in Porirua, Johnsonville and Lower Hutt.\n\nThe design for the Tawa Labyrinth was developed by Tawa College student, Alastair Binns and its shape reflects Tawaâs Bucket Tree. With the agreement of Tawa Scouts and Guides, Tawa Central Kindergarten and the Tawa Community Garden, and approval from Wellington City Council, it is being constructed on the Council-designated site at Coronation Park.\n\nReally positive feedback was received on Olympian, Ian Fergusonâs visit to Tawa Rotary on 30 July 2024 - we had a great turnout of visitors from our community.\n\nIan is a very down to earth person who with humility talked about his races, his losses and how he learned the techniques to win.\n\nAnd win he did â\n\nHe is one of New Zealand's top medal winners and 1984 Sportsperson of the Year. He has won 4 Olympic gold medals and a silver, plus 5 World Championship medals for kayaking. He raced singles, doubles and fours, but was most famous as a duo with his doubles partner Paul MacDonald. In 1996 Ian was awarded the Olympian of the Century award by New Zealand's Olympic Association\n\nIan was awarded the MBE for services to canoeing. He was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame in 1993.\n\nIan spoke to the young people in our audience â putting his gold Olympic medal around their necks and encouraging them to try out sports, find a sport that they enjoy and have a go. Anyone can be a winner â focus on what you want to achieve and go for it!\n\nThank you to Mel Waite Photography for the photos of this great evening.\n\nLearn CPR. Save a Life!\n\nWe hosted a great training session on Heartbeat CPR with Nick Swan, Wellington Free Ambulance on Tuesday 27 February 2024. Visitors from Tawa community also attended. On arrival, some shared that they had experienced family members and friends who had had a cardiac arrest - they wanted to know the latest on how save a life.\n\nEvery week on average 6 people have a sudden cardiac arrest in greater Wellington and Wairarapa region. No one is immune from cardiac arrest.\n\nEvery minute matters. If someone is unresponsive to a shout or a shake, and they're not breathing or moving they're in cardiac arrest. Early CPR increases survival rates to 30%. Using a defibrillator is the best chance for starting a heart - survival increases by 80 to 85%.\n\nA big thanks to Nick and Wellington Free Ambulance for providing this free lifesaving session. Nick encouraged local clubs and organisations to get in touch with WFA for Heartbeat Community CPR training. These sessions are sponsored by the Lloyd Morrison Foundation."
