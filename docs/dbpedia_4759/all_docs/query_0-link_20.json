        "text": "Dear St. Andrew’s Alumni, Parents, and Friends,\n\nAlthough our summer is spent busily preparing for the return of students, it is also a time of reflection. Early August seems like a good time to share some thoughts regarding this past year with all of you: the community of people who love and support St. Andrew’s School. I hope this letter will become a yearly tradition for us; the Report on Philanthropy, our annual report, always arrives in mailboxes in the fall, but I am grateful for this moment in which I may share my thoughts about the character of the year.\n\nSt. Andrew’s is a school that matters: we are a place of building up, bringing together, and daring to listen and learn. In a world that is fractured and “remote” it takes enormous courage for young people to come together, give grace, put down their phones, show up in person, learn from each other, and take the risk to grow, admit mistakes, persuade others and change their own minds. It requires a brave and devoted faculty to create the conditions necessary for growth in intellect and character—to have the perception and dexterity both to inspire and support in the requisite measures. Countless selfless acts make daily life at St. Andrew’s happen, and we can never take that for granted. I hope this note will highlight some of those moments.\n\nStudents and Faculty\n\nThe people are always the heart of our school, and the 2023-2024 school year was no different in that St. Andrew’s gathered a group of remarkable humans to learn together. The year began in mid-August with new faculty orientation where we welcomed a total of eight new colleagues. We also marked the first fully fledged year of the Teaching Fellows Program, designed by Emily Pressman. We welcomed four fellows into the program, which you might have read about in the spring St. Andrew’s Magazine. All four will return to the faculty next year, and we are absolutely thrilled to continue to help these outstanding faculty members grow and develop as boarding school teachers.\n\nThe VI Form arrived a week before Opening Day for their leadership meetings, where they established their values as a class and considered the kind of leaders they need to be for the school, the students, and each other. They did some incredible work together, and with their values of care, trust, passion, effort, servitude, communication, empathy, engagement, awareness, and adaptability, the Class of 2024 made a meaningful impact on the school. Their enthusiasm, joie de vivre, and commitment to this institution made it hard to say goodbye to them after graduation. The Commencement celebration included a remarkable address by alumna Halimah DeLaine Prado ’93 P’27, general counsel of Google, which none of us will soon forget.\n\nThe signature event of the fall was the kick-off of a two-year 50th Anniversary Celebration of Coeducation at St. Andrew’s. The “first girls” returned to campus in October so that we could celebrate them at Homecoming. Despite a massive thunderstorm, an hours-long power outage, and flooding across the region, alumnae gathered in our living room for a dinner with girls who are leading the school today. The stories and advice the “first girls” shared were invaluable, and Ty and I enjoyed staying up late with them to learn as much as we could. It was an unforgettable celebration of an important chapter of the school’s history. The next morning, with the skies glowering and generators feeding power to the chapel, the entire school gathered to hear a few alumnae share their recollections of the dawn of coeducation. (There were not only profound truths and powerful advice, but students also learned about things called “record players” and “pay phones” that apparently existed in 1973!) The perspective, the friendships, the laughter, and the honesty these women brought back to campus helped us think about how much the school has changed and how much potential our future holds as we stand on the shoulders of these giants. Progress is not inevitable—it is hard won with the goodwill, good humor, and good work of many. What a wonderful lesson for all of us to hear again so early in the year.\n\nThis has also been a major year of achievement in sports at St. Andrew’s, even as we remain committed to our model that eschews specialization and requires competing in multiple sports as an essential part of education. This is where we learn to “empty the bucket”—as well as practice teamwork, communication, grit, sportsmanship, and how to quiet our egos in the service of a greater goal. We are the rare school that fields JV teams in nearly all our sports (and occasionally thirds), and at those levels, competition can be hard to find. Many, if not most, schools in Delaware allow each sport to operate year-round, meaning that our teams often begin their seasons slowly compared to others. However, no one can beat the Saints when it comes to camaraderie, and that unified spirit and can-do attitude mean that by season’s end, we are surprising others (but not ourselves) with our late-season and post-season success. Following our athletics core values of commitment, teamwork, sportsmanship, accountability, excellence, relationship-building and an all-in attitude, the Saints had phenomenal success. This year, girls and boys cross-country came in second and third in the state, respectively; field hockey tied for most wins ever in a season (since 2016); in swimming boys won the DISC tournament; in indoor track the boys won their first ever conference title and the girls finished second in the conference by a nose; boys lacrosse made a state tournament run for the first time in six years; girls lacrosse had the most wins since 2017; girls soccer powered their way to the state semifinals; boys and girls tennis went deep into state competition, finishing overall third and fourth in the state respectively, with our second boys doubles coming in first in the state and the first doubles runners-up. In crew, we were the only high school that had all four top boats—the two girls varsity and two boys varsity—in the finals at Stotesbury.\n\nSchool leadership continues to evolve. Early in 2023-24, we searched for new head and associate chaplains, and appointed Rev. Michael Giansiracusa and Rev. Thomas Becker to these critical posts of spiritual leadership. (A highlight of the 2023-24 years was the return of Rev. David DeSalvo P’00,’04 as interim head chaplain.) Last year, I convened a faculty advisory committee to help search internally for a dean of faculty, and was delighted to appoint Wilson Everhart ’95 to this crucial role of faculty stewardship, retention, and renewal. Greg Guldin will be our dean of student affairs, overseeing residential and student life, student discipline and honor, and advising. We also appointed a new CFO, Bill McClements ’81 P’12, who will oversee school finances and operations and lead our efforts to define the financial model that will sustain St. Andrew’s into and through its next century.\n\nHold the Phone\n\nTime is so precious, and perhaps no time more precious than the fleeting years of adolescence, which also happen to be the years when humans have the neurological window to experience so much social and intellectual development that, when done right, will serve us for our entire lives. We should all be proud that St. Andrew’s continues to be known for our “cell phone culture,” which has received national attention in the last three years, and which ensures that we are preserving critical time for community, play, friendships, attention, and discussion during the adolescent years. For those not familiar, our culture is simply that phones must stay in students’ rooms and cannot be used anywhere but inside the room, except when listening to music while in the gym. Students must check their phones into the hallways when study hall begins in the evenings, so they are not in the room with their phones, which also remain in the hallway overnight for third, fourth and fifth formers. Only seniors are allowed to keep phones in their rooms overnight if they wish, although internet service is disconnected for everyone at 10:45 p.m. to ensure students can rest without distraction. Students embrace and own the policy as an essential foundation for community and friendship-building.\n\nJon Haidt’s book, “The Anxious Generation,” reignited a national conversation about the incredibly damaging effects of smartphones for adolescents—damage to their development of friendships and social skills, their academic work and schooling, and their mental health. This book is our all-school read and I invite everyone receiving this note to join us in reading it. The data are convincing, although I wish I could say they are astonishing. What I know is what you read last year about St. Andrew’s in the Atlantic, on this topic: we are so fortunate to be in the vanguard of schools in recognizing that high school is part of childhood, and in fostering student-led community norms that allow kids to have the best chance of flourishing and happiness in adolescence.\n\nA Framework for Discourse in Independent Schools\n\nThe public discourse in our country and the world around is fraught with discord and plagued by cowardice, fueled by short attention spans, online anonymity, distrust, and a zero-sum mentality around political decision-making, whether the decision in question is existential or trivial. Our schools must be places of openness and exchange, where a variety of voices and virtues are gathered, and where listening and speaking are practiced and prioritized. If our students can learn these skills in their adolescence, it should give all of us hope for the future.\n\nTherefore, I was privileged this year to be invited by John Austin ’83 P’18,’21,’23, head of Deerfield Academy, to participate in a task force of heads of independent schools to advise him in creating a framework for independent schools around these issues. Although many sets of principles exist to guide universities—which have a mission distinct from independent schools, particularly in their commitment to research—no such framework existed for secondary schools. John received funding from the E. E. Ford Foundation to support this work, and it was a highlight this year to be in conversation with the heads of so many other schools around free expression and, crucially, how it serves a great education.\n\nAs the framework itself states, it “rests on a simple assumption: that schools are, first and foremost, places of inquiry and exploration, preparing students for the freedom, rights, and responsibilities they will enjoy as adults. Teaching and learning are distinct from advocacy and activism, and nonpartisan teaching is vital to creating an intellectual climate within schools that promotes, sustains, and deepens courageous inquiry.” The framework uses a graphical representation to describe a foundation in our schools of learning and inquiry with a goal of student autonomy and self-determination, supported by three pillars—expressive freedom, disciplined nonpartisanship, and intellectual diversity. The report provides a good deal of detail on how these elements can be understood, and it is my expectation that many schools will embrace the framework, debate it, and some will discard it. Whatever schools decide, the intent was to create a basis for this important discussion in independent schools, and I hope the document will encourage many schools along this path of discernment, especially in a contentious election year.\n\nWe will always promote what we value as an Episcopal school in a nonpartisan manner. Beyond those tenets, there is a necessary balance in schools as teachers exercise their freedom to teach and design their curriculum ever mindful of the goal of supporting the freedom of students to learn, inquire, and find their distinct voices. At St. Andrew’s the considerable gifts of our teachers and the small size of our classrooms mean we can pursue and achieve this balance. For my part as a head of school, I have taken care to refrain from public comment on partisan and political matters and show restraint and moderation in my own speech, in the hope of allowing many views to flourish and for students to feel confident in their own voices and the primacy of their place in this community. We can all be proud of the incredible work taking place in St. Andrew’s classrooms, and I invite you to visit us and join a class or two.\n\nNature for Nurture\n\nOur built and natural environment are the critical context for the St. Andrew’s student experience. Without our 2,200 acres of Eastern deciduous woodlands, wetlands, waterways, and farmland, an education in this place would be so different. With the board and school leadership, especially in facilities and the business office, we have begun this past year to plan for the future of the facilities and ecosystem, including studying what it will take to be a zero-carbon school someday. The Urban Land Institute convened a “Technical Assistance Panel” of experts to help us plan, and the Stone House Group, our energy and facilities partners, has worked on several linchpin projects, including a carbon dashboard that will debut before the calendar-year end.\n\nIt is always remarkable to Ty and me how the school becomes such a hive of activity in the summer—just the opposite of what you might imagine during this time of rest. Our facilities team has been working very hard to keep the campus in shape, with cleaning and small construction projects to create more student-facing office space in Founders, as well as a student gathering space above the Kip duPont Boathouse, thanks to major gift support.\n\nThe grounds crew have been hard at work as well. Everyone in the state of Delaware knows we have the best grass fields, and this doesn’t happen without a lot of planning and effort. After an early dry spell, the rains have been more abundant this year than in recent summers, and our grounds have flourished. Since my arrival, we have embarked on a reforestation and tree management program on the campus. As our stately trees reach 100 years, they require regular maintenance to do well, particularly in the suffocating heat of the summer. Working with an arborist, we are underplanting critical areas such as the Main Drive to ensure that the view of Founders Hall emerging from a grove of majestic trees remains a key feature of your arrival on our campus.\n\nOpening the Doors\n\nFinally, it was an enormous delight to end the year by announcing that we met and exceeded, for the first time in school history, a goal of $3 million for the Saints Fund. I must express my profound gratitude to all who contributed. Your love of St. Andrew’s, your devotion to and meaningful support of this place, make everything we do possible. We exercise enormous discipline in our spending, but the cost of one student’s education for one year at St. Andrew’s exceeds $86,000. Therefore, even those paying full tuition receive substantial support—and the Saints Fund and endowment income make up the difference, approximately half of our budget. Thank you for all you did to open the doors of this school to all the families who require scholarship support to accept an offer of admission. Scholarship assistance remains essential to our identity as a school “open to all, regardless of means,” and it benefits every single one of us, whether we receive a scholarship or not.\n\nAnd remember, our doors are always open to you! Please come visit and experience St. Andrew’s today if you have the chance. Until then, you have my sincere gratitude and warmest wishes for what remains of your summer.\n\nA beam of light streams through the window and spills across a gray Marley floor. Three ballet bars stand against the wall. A bird decal sticks to the glass window, wings stretched skyward.\n\nKayden Murrell ’26 snaps a photo of the scene, a moment of peace in the usually bustling dance studio. Though the angle of the photo conceals the rising V former’s image in the wall of mirrors, the scene is a reflection of Murrell’s identity and most authentic sense of self.\n\nMurrell’s photo is one of 28 by the 2023-2024 IV Form students in Kate Cusick’s English classes as part of an inter-school project in which SAS students explored places on campus that feel like home to them through photography and poetry, and shared their work with school communities beyond St. Andrew’s for dialogue and feedback.\n\nThe idea for the project took root in the summer of 2023, which Cusick spent with the Change Fellow Cohort at Middlebury College’s Bread Loaf School of English in Vermont. The fellowship tasked Cusick and her fellow educators with creating a project that brings communities together and bridges divides. Cusick collaborated with Rebecca Rose, a teacher at Mercersburg Academy in Mercersburg, Pa.; and Nora Britton, a teacher at the Academy of American Studies in Queens, N.Y., for the project. Although the trio was inspired by their shared classroom reads like Nested Interculturality, which centers on creativity and immersive cultural experiences, they didn’t know precisely what their project would become. They did know the pieces they wanted to incorporate: letter-writing, mapping, and creative expression.\n\nAs they built out the details of how to bring these ideas into harmony, they developed the structure of the project: a cross-school exchange of photography, poetry, and reflection centered around “a sense of place”—the places in which the tenth-grade students at each school find comfort and belonging.\n\n“Who are our students?” the teachers wrote in their reflection of the project in the Bread Loaf Teacher Network Journal. “How can we develop students’ sense of belonging to, and ownership over, their school/local community? What relationships can we forge with distant places, individuals, and communities?”\n\nThe educators aimed to foster understanding between the students whose senses of place might be wildly different—from the rural settings of Middletown and Mercersburg to the urban cityscapes of Queens—with a dialogue about personal and shared experiences and identities.\n\n“We wanted to work through that channel of breaking the barrier of their understanding of us and us of them,” says Cusick.\n\nThis project took place over four months of the school year, and it started with the St. Andrew’s and Mercersburg students trekking around their campuses and photographing the places that resonated with them, from the shining floor of the basketball court to a leaf-covered trail nestled by the woods.\n\nThe students then virtually sent their photos to Queens. There, the Academy of American Studies students looked through the photos—which had no personal identifiers—and selected those photos that they wanted to ask questions about, and sent responses to the photographer.\n\n“We gave them a frame of questions, of things to consider,” says Cusick. “[They asked questions and made comments like,] ‘I noticed in your picture you chose the pond or water,’ or ‘I’m curious, why did you choose this angle, this color?’”\n\nThe Academy of American Studies students also shared their own photos, capturing corner delis, rainy highways, quaint bookstores, and more with the same students with whom they corresponded previously.\n\n“The first thing that struck me was that we were outside for my partner’s picture, I think it was a bridge and there was a body of water and there was the sunset,” says Murrell. “Compared to my picture, which was bright and indoors, their picture was dark and outside. Yet, I still felt that this is an important place to them … I thought that was really interesting to see how there’s two different spaces, but they invoke the same feelings.”\n\nMurrell also felt an odd sense of familiarity looking at the photo, recalling memories of visiting the city with family—as the New Jersey-native’s mom works in New York City.\n\n“They’re closer to home, to my home, than I am,” says Murrell. “It felt refreshing in a way, being grounded there again.”\n\nAfter the initial feedback of their photos, the students wrote poems about their senses of place associated with their photos. After getting feedback from their peers at their school, they sent their poems to their inter-school partners.\n\nThough the Academy of American Studies student will never know the face or name behind Murrell’s poem, it touches on a deep sense of identity that has blossomed within the dancer and actor in the studio.\n\nIn the following excerpt, Murrell explores the warmth of the spotlight:\n\nI wouldn’t go out of my way to garner attention\n\nBut,\n\nThere is something in that room splashed with sunlight,\n\nBlack birds surrounded by a halo of sky,\n\nThe far wall covered with advice from stage legends old and new,\n\nA large mirror filled with performers, training to be on stage.\n\nThere is something that makes me want to try\n\nHarnessing the sun.\n\nI’m no Icarus.\n\nI wouldn’t go out of my way to garner attention\n\nBut,\n\nThere is something in the spotlight that makes the attention worth it.\n\n“I learned to take command of the spotlight [with performance], and it’s helped me lose my shyness,” says Murrell. “The story of Icarus is that he flew too close to the sun. So when I say ‘I’m no Icarus,’ I’m not going to just venture out to the spotlight, not normally, but because of my experience in that studio, I’m learning to step further into the spotlight. I’m learning to allow myself to shine.”\n\nSending the poem off to Queens was even more scary than handing in an assignment to a teacher, Murrell says. Murrell didn’t know the student that would read the poem, nor how they would react to such a personal piece. But when Murrell received the feedback, the Queens student recounted her own memory of dance, and the shared connection eased Murrell’s fear.\n\nStudents opening themselves to an audience greater than their teacher and their classmates was just the point, says Cusick.\n\n“When we write just to a teacher, it’s so insular,” says Cusick. “[The project] is breaking the barriers of what it means to be a student.”\n\nBreaking the boundaries of instruction was just one goal of the project, another was to make campus part of the curriculum.\n\n“When I think about Mary Oliver’s poetry, and I think about Robert Frost, and I think about even Mark Doty, who we’re learning in 11th grade right now, places are embedded in our memory and in our sense of identity,” says Cusick. “And this place is four years of these young people’s lives. It’s such a part of who they are. So [this project helps] them both use that as a tool to find their voice in their writing, and articulate who they are, but also embed that then into the work that they’re doing with the literature outside of them.”\n\nShe says the project also aimed to bridge identities rooted in place to something larger than our campus, a goal which culminated in a creation of an interactive map which includes the students’ photography, poetry, and reflections. Students can explore the interactive map of all the participants’ work and physically see where each picture was taken in connection with the other photos.\n\nCusick says that this project deepened her understanding of her students, as she discovered unknown passions for rowing or art or students who got up early just to watch the sun rise. It also helped Cusick connect to her personal mission and identity behind education.\n\n“Oftentimes [as teachers], we get stuck in this rote aspect [of teaching] assignments and grading and the literature,” says Cusick. “And we forget that at the center of everything we’re doing is the student. And this project placed our students at the center of everything we did … their exploration, their desire, their images, their choices.”\n\nMurrell says that this was more than just an assignment. The assignment “elevated” the classroom experience by giving Murrell a taste of what it might be like to be a professional writer, getting feedback from other writers and providing it. Your work may be different from others’, but that’s nothing to be afraid of, Murrell says.\n\n“It’s a good different, it’s an eye-opening different, and I think that’s something people have to learn,” says Murrell. “You’re not all the same. You’re all different. … [but] you’re all different with the same goal, with the same feelings. I think this Sense of Place project really helped bring that similarity to light, because in different places, you have the same feeling of comfort, the same feeling of home away from home.”\n\nGood afternoon everybody.\n\nLast Saturday, Mary Troy and I walked around the pond. Or at least we tried, got lost halfway and Ms. Kerrane had to pick us up and drive us back to campus (again, thank you so much, Mrs. Kerrane). Not our brightest moment… Mary and I had always planned to go on this adventure since the very beginning of the school year, but we never really seriously considered doing it—until the day before graduation. When I woke up that morning, I felt like I was missing out on something so crucial to my experience at St. Andrew’s that I wouldn’t be able to leave here without doing it. So I texted Mary, “Do you want to walk around the pond?” and she answered with, “Yeah, let’s try it.” We packed snacks, water bottles, and a speaker and started walking towards the unknown, equipped with a Strava map, a guide made by Daisy and Madeleine, and the excitement for what would turn out to be one of my key memories this year.\n\nWhen we entered the woods down by Ms. McGrath’s house, I had a similar feeling of joy and fear of the unknown that I had when I left my home on August 15th, knowing that I would not come back for another 300 days. I remember my mum standing in the doorway that morning, waving goodbye with tears in her eyes. I remember crying myself when I hugged my sister in the airport and I remember my dad’s bald head sticking out of the airport crowd as I walked through security. I always knew that I wanted to go abroad, but at that moment, I wondered whether I was doing the right thing. I was leaving everything and everybody I cared about behind, only because of some random boarding school in the middle of nowhere (no offense, of course). For me, spending a year in the U.S. meant a time difference of six hours, having to find new friends, and getting used to a completely new environment. Suddenly, the English language would be my only way to communicate (of course except for D-Block French with Mme Pears - merci pour ça). And it also meant measuring everything in teaspoons, cups, gallons, inches, feet, yards, miles, or Fahrenheit—something I’m still not used to.\n\nBut I was as ready as I could, I had worked my way through the handbook and I finished my summer readings. So when the airplane took off to this new world, I was really excited. Around eight hours, several movies, and an eternity of staring out of the window later, I finally arrived in the U.S.. After a four-day-long orientation in Connecticut, I arrived at New Jersey airport, where Mr. Steve, one of the school drivers, picked me up. Because I was completely exhausted, we didn’t talk much during the ride, but he gave me one piece of advice that is still with me today: He said, “When you’re in America, never talk about politics.”\n\nBefore coming to St. Andrew’s, I spent ten days at Peter and Henry Bird’s house in Sea Bright, New Jersey and I was immediately struck by the beauty of the beaches, the fresh and salty air, and, most importantly, the people. As soon as I saw the Birds waving in their doorway, I knew that this year was gonna be amazing. In those 10 days, I ate my first lobster, ran a two-mile race with Peter and Henry (which was maybe not the smartest idea, but back then, I didn’t know about their passion for cross country), we got stranded in a little boat because the motor broke, I visited New York, and I also tried surfing. After those 10 amazing and eventful days, I wrote in my diary, “The Birds are the nicest people and the best host family I could have ever imagined.” Tomorrow, they’ll pick us up and I will, now for the last time, spend 10 more days with them. I am so incredibly grateful for them and their hospitality—thank you so much!\n\nThen, on August 31st, we arrived on St. Andrew’s campus. After having registered myself in the Field House, I carried my suitcases up to Schmolze and stumbled into Luke Ketzner, one of my future roommates. He excitedly asked me, “Are you Vincent?” I responded with “yes” and he showed me to our room. Shortly after, I bumped into a—and I am quoting him here right now—“tall, dark, handsome man” and with Tyrus, Schmolze 303 was complete. They always say that you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with, and I think that I will leave here with one-fifth of Tyrus’s American charm and great advice, and one-fifth of Luke’s determination and grit. And seriously, Tyrus and Luke, the past nine months felt like a never ending sleepover and I will miss our after-lights-out talks and, even more so, our Middletown Monopoly gaming sessions. You taught me how to sleep like a stone, how to bribe somebody for their food, and how to be a good friend. Even though I was afraid when I was told that I would have two roommates, I couldn’t think of any better duo than you guys.\n\nThe days of preseason flew by, and suddenly, school started. A normal day here at St. Andrew’s was so much different from what I had been used to in Germany, and it honestly took me a while to fully master the routine of breakfast check-ins, dress code, and table rotations. What first looked like a simple lunch break soon became one of my favorite parts of the day and every family-style meal, I looked forward to getting to know everybody at my table. Not knowing what to expect from an American high school cafeteria, I found myself surprised with the hundreds of delicious meals I had, and of course, Pizza Friday was my absolute favorite. Thank you, SAGE!\n\nOne of the most transformative events, though, were my classes. I was afraid of not being able to keep up with my peers and of not being able to express all my thoughts and opinions in an understandable way. But my worries were for nothing. Every teacher and every classmate was so welcoming and would repeat a word even four more times until I would understand it. I asked hundreds of stupid questions and received thousands of helpful answers. During a chemistry quiz at the beginning of the year, I remember writing ‘firelighter’ instead of ‘fire extinguisher,’ and ‘handcuffs’ instead of ‘gloves.’ Thank you, Mr. Guldin, for being patient with me! In other classes, I had similar experiences, but soon, I started to feel like a part of the class, and this attitude helped me a lot. Dr. Geiersbach’s chamber music block was one of my favorite classes this year. Ms. Cusick’s English class was probably one of the most challenging ones. In Mr. Edmond’s public history class, I first learned how to participate in an academic round table discussion, and the memories of math with Mr. Kwon (including the late-night study room sessions for the next quest) will remain with me for a long time. In the second semester, Mr. Finch, my data science teacher, taught me how to predict the future with the help of big data, and in Dr. Hyde’s nuclear physics and ethics [class], which was probably my most interesting class here at St. Andrew’s, I first encountered Einstein’s relativity theory and argued for and against the prohibition of nuclear weapons. All the courses that I took were incredibly engaging and insightful, and I will miss the St. Andrew’s teaching style. Thank you so much to all of my teachers, for helping me push my boundaries and broadening my horizon.\n\nAnother essential part of my St. Andrew’s experience was the orchestra and the chamber music guild. Every week, I was looking forward to sitting down in the rehearsal room and creating beautiful, and sometimes not-so beautiful, melodies. I enjoyed playing in Engelhard Hall and I can’t believe that I won’t be here for the next concerts (of course I’ll be watching from the livestream!). Since the beginning of the school year, I’ve been begging Dr. G to play Dvorak’s 9th symphony, and on Arts Weekend, we finally did it! The Czech composer Antonin Dvorak came to the U.S. in 1892 and composed his “New World Symphony,” describing his experiences in a new and strange, but beautiful country. Playing the piece with everybody else that night was truly special, because I could resonate with Dvorak’s experiences. So thank you to everybody in the orchestra for helping make this wish come true.\n\nWhen I looked at the afternoon activities, my parents told me to do something to get out of my comfort zone, so I signed up for the fall play. I had never done anything related to acting and theatre, and yet from the moment I stepped into Forbes Theatre and met Mrs. Taylor and the rest of the cast, I was amazed by the atmosphere and this sense of enthusiasm in the room. Surprisingly, I got one of the main parts in one of the plays, and I completely loved it. The feeling right before the curtain call was incredible; joyful anticipation mixed with a ton of nerves. I was so thrilled by this feeling that I also signed up for the winter musical, knowing pretty well that singing was not part of my talents. After auditioning, I got the role of Shermy, a character in the Peanuts comics that soon got taken out, because he didn’t have a personality. However, I took it as a challenge and even got a little solo! In total, those two performances helped me discover a new part of myself, and on another note, also contributed a lot to my diction. Thank you, Mrs. Taylor.\n\nComing back from spring break, I was thrown into my first 2k erg test ever, something I will never forget. I remember this feeling of everybody being super nervous, the feeling of accomplishment after it’s over and Tyrus and Luke chanting “SCHMOLZE 303” while I was pulling for my life. However, after my first practice on the water, I realized that literally every second of pain and suffering would be worth the beauty of gliding on Noxontown pond, feeling like a part of something bigger and more powerful than myself. This crew season has taught me so much and even got me a rowing medal! I am so grateful that I was able to row in the Colburn with Eliza as our crazy and amazing coxswain, and seven other guys that pulled for the same goal. I want to say thank you to Coach Gilheany, Myers, and Porter for introducing me to this beautiful sport, and for believing in me. It was an incredible and unique season and I really hope to continue to row when I go back to Germany!\n\nIn the past couple of weeks, many people have come up to me and asked whether I was sad to be leaving soon. My answer would always be something like, “Of course I am sad, but I am also looking forward to seeing my friends in Germany again.” And even though this is true, I wasn’t completely honest. Yes, going back to Munich will be great, but leaving St. Andrew’s and this amazing community behind is horrifying. In the little book, The Story of Us, a quote from Azar Nafisi says, “You get a strange feeling when you’re about to leave a place. You’ll not only miss the people you love, but you’ll miss the person you are now at this time and this place, because you know you’ll never be this way again.” This is exactly how I’m feeling today, because St. Andrew’s and this amazing community allowed me to be my true self, and I will miss every single one of you.\n\nNow just a short disclaimer: Tyrus and Luke helped me write this last part of the speech.\n\nThank you, St. Andrew’s, for having me this year. Thank you, Tyrus and Luke, for being so incredibly amazing. Thank you, ASSIST, for making this incredible adventure possible. Thank you, Schmolze, for being the best dorm ever. And, of course, thank you to the best roommates ever, Tyrus and Luke. Thank you to everybody who put up with my whistling and thank you to every single person that was part of my exchange year and contributed to making it the most special time in my life—please stay in contact! I can’t believe we’re all leaving tomorrow, and I can’t believe I won’t be back in the fall. And the worst thing is, of course, that I won’t see Tyrus and Luke again in a long long time. I will miss them because they are so amazingly amazing.\n\nOk, but seriously, this year has taught me so infinitely much, and I will forever treasure every single moment in my heart. And even though I ultimately didn’t make it all the way around the pond, I enjoyed every single moment of this journey.\n\nThank you.\n\nHead of School Joy McGrath ’92 announced and welcomed the new faculty who will join St. Andrew’s in the 2024-25 school year.

The board came together at the end of April to effectuate a long-planned leadership transition and discuss plans and initiatives for the school year to come, but they also spent time celebrating Scott Sipprelle ’81 P’08, who this June will end almost 25 years of service to the board, nearly a decade of which he served as board chair.\n\nThe weekend of celebration included a Chapel Talk by Sipprelle, a dinner, student performances, and even a ceremonial first pitch thrown on the Saints diamond by the former St. Andrew’s pitcher himself.\n\n“I sort of recoil at personal celebration,” Sipprelle says. “So, at the outset, I was resistant to the celebrations, as I said at the dinner on Friday night. But somebody much wiser than me said, ‘This isn’t about you. It's about the school, and the process and the celebration and the symbolism.’ One of the hallmarks of St. Andrew’s is very stable and long-tenured leadership, both at the head of school level and at the board level. Pausing to reflect on that, I think the significance of transition is worth celebrating.”\n\nVice Chair Richard Vaughan Sr. ’88 P’24,’27 will succeed Sipprelle for the 2024-2025 school year.\n\nSipprelle says the transition has been a thoughtful, strategic process. “Having done a lot of leadership and management transitions over my years in business, there’s a right time and there's a wrong time,” he says. “The best way to transition is slow and deliberate and planned. This was a two-year process from the time I announced I was going to step down, and I think it has been pretty seamless.”\n\nA critical priority of Sipprelle’s as he prepared to pass the torch to Vaughan has been to help Head of School Joy McGrath ’92 firmly establish her position as the school’s fifth head. “Managing a head of school transition in a really tumultuous environment for all educational institutions—and frankly, for all of society—has required much board focus,” he says.\n\nMcGrath, in her Friday night dinner remarks, thanked Sipprelle for his support during that transition.\n\n“It is rare for a new head of school to have a board chair who is unfailing in his support of those decisions that will move the institution forward, and unflinching when those decisions occasionally are really tough,” McGrath told a crowd gathered in the Sipprelle Field House. “So from the bottom of my heart, thank you. I know how lucky I have been to work with you the past three years, and I am looking forward to the next chapter of your deep connection to our school. Your leadership, wisdom, and support—your love of this place and, not least, your love of what is right for this place—have been an incredible bulwark to me during these first three years of headship.”\n\nVaughan credits Sipprelle for ensuring both men navigated the transition in close partnership. “The board weekend was a remarkable few days that had been planned for over a year,” he says. “In terms of the chair role, Scott and I have been doing everything jointly while I was vice chair. He has very much included me in virtually every conversation that he was having. Much of trustee weekend was to celebrate and thank Scott for tremendous leadership during his chairmanship, but also since he joined the board in 2001.”\n\nVaughan, who joined the board in 2005, is thrilled to get to work as chair. “In five years, we’ll be celebrating our centennial,” he says. “That is a natural time for both reflection on the past, but more importantly, thinking about the future. I think we're going to want to look at the long-term financial sustainability of the school. A lot of that comes from our mission to provide a first-class education regardless of means, which is an even more challenging mission to achieve in an ever-increasing cost environment. We’re going to be very focused on that financial sustainability. We’re also going to have to continue to invest in the faculty experience, both attracting and keeping faculty, and making sure there is a career path and work-life balance that is set for the next century.”\n\nSipprelle’s three key words for Vaughan as he navigates the next chapter of St. Andrew’s board leadership are “balance,” “growth,” and “sustain.”\n\n“The balance is about keeping an even keel on the school and not reacting too dramatically to any stress or change in the environment,” Sipprelle says. “Grow is just having a growth mindset to always ask, ‘What could we do differently and better?’ And sustain is to never forget the core values and culture that make St. Andrew’s unique.”\n\nOther new board appointments for the 2024-2025 school year include Kellie Doucette ’88, P’18,’18,’21, current chair of the board’s advancement committee, who was named vice-chair. Parent trustee Aaron Barnes P’21, ’24 will become a regular trustee.\n\nThe board offers its deep thanks for the service, contributions, and perspectives of departing trustees Mercedes Abramo P’18, ’22, John Eisenbrey Jr. ’74, P’05, ’05, ’07, and Grace Gahagan ’10.\n\nThe board is pleased to elect the following new trustees, all of whom will join the board in the fall of 2024:\n\nKiran Kalsi Chapman P’21, ’23, ’28\n\nCharlottesville, VA and Houston, TX\n\nKiran is the mother of Amrit ’21, Ford ’23, and Hank ’28.

After earning her master’s degree, Kiran worked in brand management at Johnson & Johnson on the iconic Johnson’s Baby brands.\n\nShe and her husband, Jim, moved from New York to Hong Kong in 2005 where Kiran served on the Hong Kong International School’s development team, managing its annual fund. In 2013, the family relocated to Charlottesville, Va., where Kiran spent many years working as development director and grants manager for a national independent abortion provider.\n\nKiran sits on the board of trustees for Peabody School, a small independent school in Charlottesville for academically advanced children; and The Emily Couric Leadership Forum, which each year awards $250,000 in scholarships to a graduating female student from each of Charlottesville’s 11 high schools. She also serves as co-head of the Georgetown University Women’s Rowing Team’s parent booster club.\n\nKiran and Jim regard joining the St. Andrew’s community as unequivocally the best parenting decision they ever made. Kiran looks forward to serving St. Andrew’s, which has shaped their children and their family in countless ways.

Losing a game, failing a test, letting yourself or others down, some experience in which you didn’t quite hit that mark. But here’s the beauty in that—in that failure, a door of possibility was unlocked for you.”\n\nFrom an initial rejection letter to St. Andrew’s to “pretty spectacular fails” in her professional career, Prado noted that failure provided her with resilience and fortitude, the qualities that the Class of 2024 needs to rely on as they navigate a new era of their lives, and a new era of society’s relationship to technologies such as artificial intelligence.\n\n“While AI will have a tremendously positive impact on society, its power can also be used for malintent,” said Prado. “That’s where you, Class of 2024, come in. You are the next generation of leaders—researchers, educators, politicians, scientists, and artists. You have the distinct advantage of coming of age with this new, powerful technology and you are in the position to dutifully guide where AI and other social and technical and creative innovations will take us. Embrace that opportunity.”\n\nClick here to watch Prado’s entire address, or read the full address here.\n\nStudent body co-presidents Charlie Lunsford ’24 and Riya Soni ’24 reflected on their time at St. Andrew’s in their individual addresses, asking a packed Front Lawn what success really means, and detailing how SAS support systems allowed each to reach their goals.

Let me be the latest in a long line of folks to say congratulations to the Class of 2024!\n\nIt is truly an honor to be here with you today as you graduate.\n\nI have fond memories of St. Andrew’s—perhaps, not my alarm clock—but I credit much of my success to my formative years that I spent here on Noxontown Pond.\n\nAs Google’s general counsel, I have the privilege of leading a global team of legal professionals who grapple with some of the hardest legal issues to face us as it relates to technology. That’s a fairly lofty statement, but frankly, it’s a pretty cool gig and I’m extremely lucky to have it.\n\nClass of 2024, you also stand at an exciting intersection in life—one filled with unknown challenges, twists, and turns that, while they may seem daunting, your time at St. Andrew’s has prepared you with everything you need to not just take on those challenges, but to do so and thrive.\n\nSo, what does a healthy dose of preparedness look like? It is a solid helping of failure mixed with an authentic embrace of change.\n\nNow if you’re lucky, and I truly mean this with all sincerity, you’ll have been afforded the opportunity of failure during your time here. Yes, I’m being deliberate with that word, failure. Losing a game, failing a test, letting yourself or others down, some experience in which you didn’t quite hit that mark. But here’s the beauty in that—in that failure, a door of possibility was unlocked for you.\n\nFor me and my experience with SAS that started on, shall we say, day zero.\n\nNow taking a step back, if someone had said those same words to me decades ago when I sat where you are and then added the spoiler alert that I would one day deliver the Commencement speech here, I would be a little perplexed.\n\nAnd that may be because the first time I applied to St. Andrew’s, I was soundly rejected.\n\nWhen I toured St. Andrew’s in the eighth grade, I was instantly struck by the campus’s beauty, the brilliant minds of the teachers and students, and the vibrant community that makes St. Andrew’s the special place that it is.\n\nSo while I was disappointed to have received a thoughtfully worded rejection letter, I do admit, I was slightly relieved. I was terrified to leave the cushy comforts of home. What at that time felt like a rejection I may never recover from, I now see as a pivotal moment in my life.\n\nAfter dusting off my ego, I had largely accepted the fact that St. Andrew’s would not be a part of my journey. I entered ninth grade at a different school and tried to forget about what could have been. But just as I was settling into that routine, my mother launched her campaign to reframe that rejection as a challenge to re-apply.\n\nBuried in the text of my rejection letter was a sentence actually encouraging me to apply again next year—something that I had overlooked, but that my mother saw as an opportunity.\n\nA quick aside about my mother, who is here with us today—she is tenacious and never takes “no” for an answer. At 17 years of age she left her hometown of Philadelphia to study engineering in Chicago. Now, she didn’t love engineering, and she didn’t like Chicago—sorry to the midwesterners in the house, my apologies. She did love fractions and numbers. She turned that passion into a successful career as an options trader. In fact, becoming the first Black woman options trader on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. My mother has heard the word “no” a lot in her life, and she has made a habit of not letting those moments hold her or her loved ones back.\n\nNow fast forward to 1990, my mother made me re-read my rejection letter and asked if “no” was really the final answer. She then asked if I could see myself at St. Andrew’s, to which I replied “yes” without hesitation.\n\nAnd the rest, to embrace the cliché, is history.\n\nFailure is a part of life. No matter how successful or intelligent you are. We all fail, repeatedly. It is part of the human experience. It is ok to fail. Failure is, shall we say, encouraged.\n\nHow you respond to failure ultimately dictates the kind of life that you will lead. In fact, most of the time failure teaches us more than our successes do. In moments where we have “failed” we are forced into introspection and to learn from these experiences. Now that doesn’t just happen when we’re young. I can chart some of my most impactful achievements as outcomes from some pretty spectacular fails, which I’m not going to get into here.\n\nPut simply though, there is a profound power and opportunity in failure. Moving through failure generates the kind of resilience and fortitude that will take you far in life. This was the very first lesson St. Andrew’s taught me, and I hadn’t even gotten here yet!\n\nSt. Andrew’s has truly shaped me into the woman I am today. I didn’t take one day here for granted. Whether that was playing soccer, butchering the French language, geeking out about U.S. jurisprudence, sharpening my leadership skills as a prefect, or, frankly, the many nights I spent with my roommates making mix tapes and eating Top Ramen—each experience enabled me to deepen my intellectual curiosity, broaden my understanding of myself and those around me, embrace the academic, athletic, and social changes and opportunities throughout, and, most importantly, continue to seek out the same in college and beyond.\n\nSt. Andrew’s has built you into adaptable, resilient, curious, and empathetic young adults. These qualities will take you far in life and will serve as your guiding principles through every obstacle you face.\n\nAlmost no one takes the exact path that they had originally laid out for themselves, and it is those unexpected bumps in the road that build character, make memories, and teach us to appreciate the little moments, as I hope each of you do when you look back on your time here.\n\nBut it’s important to remember that not only is failure a part of life, so is change.\n\nOn her 65th birthday, poet Nikki Giovanni said, “A lot of people resist transition and therefore never allow themselves to enjoy who they are. Embrace the change, no matter what it is; once you do, you can learn about the new world you’re in and take advantage of it. You still bring to bear all your prior experiences, but you are riding on another level. It’s completely liberating.”\n\nClass of 2024, you stand at the precipice of a new era—and I mean this in a multitude of ways.\n\nNot only are you beginning a new chapter of life, but society is grappling with a variety of things that will result in its evolution—from the economy to new technology like Artificial Intelligence.\n\nChange and innovation can be daunting, but it has the power to lead us to new opportunities that we may have never envisioned as possible. Innovation brings new challenges and, most of the time, new responsibilities.\n\nMuch like my graduating Class of 1993, the Class of 2024 stands at the edge of a technological revolution.\n\nFor me and my classmates, it was the invention and proliferation of the internet.\n\nFor you sitting here today, it’s AI.\n\nIt is hard to imagine life before the internet, Google, and cell phones. How did we look up questions like “What time is sunrise today?” or “Who won the Celtics game last night? ”\n\nSome of you in the audience will recall flipping through the encyclopedia to find information for your American history paper or using, sorry folks, the Yellow Pages to find the phone number for your favorite pizza place.\n\nAll of this is probably a foreign concept to today’s graduates who grew up in a world where information is at our fingertips and accessible in less time than it took me to read this very sentence. The world is very different from when I was a student here.\n\nLike many of us cannot imagine a world without the internet, there will come a day, potentially soon, where we say the same thing about AI.\n\nAI has almost unfathomable potential, and has already done so much good, from powering tools to help medical professionals make lifesaving diagnoses faster to helping firefighters accurately predict the pathway of wildfires.\n\nWhile AI will have a tremendously positive impact on society, its power can also be used for malintent.\n\nThat’s where you, Class of 2024, come in. You are the next generation of leaders—researchers, educators, politicians, scientists, and artists.\n\nYou have the distinct advantage of coming of age with this new, powerful technology and you are in the position to dutifully guide where AI and other social and technical and creative innovations will take us.\n\nEmbrace that opportunity.\n\nYour time here at St. Andrew’s has prepared you to be leaders in an ever-changing world and to make your place in the world authentically, with conviction and courage.\n\nThe community, relationships, and lessons learned here will take you far in life. Your teachers and classmates challenged your frame of thinking while you learned to juggle responsibilities and discover your passions. Through each chapter in your journey you have learned how to be more inclusive, engage in civil discourse, become more curious, and lead in a way that is accepting with respect for all.\n\nThese principles have prepared you to lead with grace and bring a set of core values into a changing world that will badly need it.\n\nAll of this being said, trust in yourself, speak up for what is right, and bring your experiences with you and do not be afraid to fail.\n\nSt. Andrew’s has taught you skills that you will take with you long after you leave campus for the last time—from solving complex math problems to building lifelong friendships that will extend far beyond your years on campus.\n\nRemember, change is a constant—it brings new beginnings, experiences, and invaluable lessons.\n\nAs you remember the opportunities that you took advantage of here on this campus and led you to this very moment, reflect about how that happened over time—through family-style meals in the Dining Hall to Chapel to cheering on friends on the field and on the stage. Cherish these moments, as they will soon be but fond memories.\n\nThese time-honored traditions weave a golden thread across generations of St. Andrew’s alumni. It is a common bond. Remember, we all still call St. Andrew’s home long after we’ve departed these halls. I know I do.\n\nYou are about to embark on an incredible journey. Embrace those failures and challenges, tackle them head on, and lean on your time at St. Andrew’s to guide you through your next chapter with grace, faith, and courage.\n\nAs Nikki Giovanni said, and I wholeheartedly agree, that journey will be so very, very liberating.\n\nThank you once again for having me, and one more time: Congratulations, to the Class of 2024!\n\nIf you missed our Arts Weekend chapel on Sunday, you missed one of the great sermons of the year. Jeremy Day-O’Connell, Gabe’s father, offered a reflection on the connections between art and faith. Many things he said remain with me, but one seems particularly relevant this morning of Pentecost. He said—and I’m paraphrasing his elegant prose—that through both art and religion we find that there is more to the world than what we can see with our eyes.\n\n“Your young people shall see visions, and your old folks shall dream dreams.” There is more to the world than what we can see with our eyes.\n\nNow, it is Pentecost, and so today’s scriptures tell the story of the visitation of the Holy Spirit, coming “like the rush of a violent wind,” causing the Galileans to speak in many languages. Prior to the arrival of this wind, the Galileans all spoke their own language, which scholars today believe was Aramaic. After the spirit rushed through them, they could speak many tongues, in preparation for spreading across the land to tell the story of the resurrection, the central event of what would become the Christian faith.\n\nEveryone present wonders what has happened. And Peter explains by quoting the prophet Joel, “I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young people shall see visions, and your old folks shall dream dreams.”\n\n“Your young people shall see visions, and your old folks shall dream dreams.” There is more to the world than what we can see with our eyes.\n\nOn this day, we also read from Ezekiel about the Valley of the Dry Bones. The writer is shown a desert valley filled with skeletons, and the wind rushes in, and the bones join together, and are covered with flesh, and yet—they are still dead. But God sends the wind, and says, “I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live.” And only then do the flesh and bones come to life, the writer says, “a vast multitude.” Spooky!\n\n“Your young people shall see visions, and your old folks shall dream dreams.” There is more to the world than what we can see with our eyes.\n\nYou are more than flesh and bones, you are spirit: divine breath and love and wonder. Over 99 percent of your body—your flesh and bones—is made up of six elements: oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, calcium, and phosphorus. But what you are made of is spirit: Love, courage, joy, curiosity, tenacity, humor.\n\n“Your young people shall see visions, and your old folks shall dream dreams.” There is more to the world than what we can see with our eyes. What are your visions? When you are old, what will be your dreams? Summer is an incredible gift for you to reflect on these questions. What makes you feel truly alive? What animates your spirit? Is it art, as Mr. Day-O’Connell suggested? Is it faith?\n\nWhat animates our school relates to our motto, “faith and learning.” And last year, we meditated frequently on a passage from Hebrews 11, “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” So, as we scatter to the four winds like the apostles for the summer, like the apostles you should pay some mind to your spiritual lives. Some of you practice a formal faith with your families at home in various ways, and many do not. But every one of you has a spirit. You are all filled with breath, with life—there is more to you than what we can see with our eyes. Take time to nourish that spirit, to contemplate what you cannot see with your eyes—“the evidence of things not seen.”\n\nAs your teachers, what we cannot see about you is our entire professional concern. Because yes: you are flesh and bone. You are oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, calcium, and phosphorus. But there is a power within you that is not generated by a chemical reaction, and you must never forget that—your power comes from what we cannot see with our eyes—features of life that are just as important as breath, those qualities you have that arise within community and are expressed, refined, and perfected in community.\n\nIf you think of some of the ones I mentioned—love, courage, joy, curiosity, tenacity, humor—these are not aspects of your life that exist in a vacuum. They only exist in relationship and community with others. You practice and develop these through art, athletics, chapel, and dorm life. Reading, painting, competing, worshiping, performing, singing, living together is how we get better, and ultimately do better.\n\nOur school is built for this, to practice and develop what makes you truly human. During the year, I think it’s fair to say our plates are very full. I hope this summer you will take advantage of a stretch of unscheduled time and consider those things that matter so much, but which you cannot see. Read widely and imagine other worlds. Look at great art and dream of new ways of understanding. Listen to great music and hear the wordless language of beauty. Consider what is sacred—and believe that what is sacred is around you and within you.\n\nThere is more to the world than what we can see with our eyes. “Your young people shall see visions, and your old folks shall dream dreams.”\n\nOn this day of Pentecost, of all days, let it be so.\n\nDuring an Advanced American History class her senior year at St. Andrew’s, Halimah DeLaine Prado ’93 learned about the inception of the Supreme Court, and was charged with writing a legal brief and arguing in front of her peers. The result of that exercise was a “brain on fire and hurting in a really, really good way,” Prado says. Now Google’s general counsel, Prado considers this classroom moment as the one that hooked her on the law. “Yes, this is what I want,” she says she remembers thinking.\n\nWe spent an afternoon sitting down with Prado, who is this year’s Commencement speaker, across the table of a Silicon Valley conference room (virtually, that is). We talked about entering St. Andrew’s as a new sophomore, her front-row experience to the first Frosty Run ever, the “North Star” of St. Andrew’s, and how she “thoughtfully and authentically” leads a global internet giant.\n\nWhat comes to mind when you think about your St. Andrew’s experience?\n\nIt was a pretty impactful, formative experience for me. I think anytime a teenager decides to embark on boarding school, it’s a fairly big deal. You’re sort of taking that step of independence that typically folks think of happening when you enter college.\n\nFor me, having the experience of being independent, taking charge of how I approached my academic journey, being able to live in a community in a really unique and frankly stunningly gorgeous environment, it was pretty awesome. A lot of the experiences that I had during my three years there have definitely shaped how I’ve approached new experiences, be it personal or professional.\n\nYou came to St. Andrew’s as a IV former. What was that like?\n\nEntering as a IV former is challenging, right? You’re coming in after a full year of your classmates having had a chance to bond.\n\nThere was a weird sense of catching up. You feel a little bit on the fringe or kind of nervous. But what I found is, that [feeling] disappeared fairly quickly. The school did a phenomenal job of embracing the IV formers, and I felt that very acutely.\n\nAbout two months into my [IV Form year], I broke my leg, which one might call a tough situation … I had to go home for a week and a half. And then I came back to school on crutches, in a wheelchair. And what struck me was how truly the entire community made space for me to operate through campus, to check in on how I was doing.\n\nFor me, that IV Form year was this wonderful sort of ‘aha’ moment, that ‘Oh, right, this place is special. This place is a community.’\n\nDo you have any other experiences that you feel particularly connected to from your time at St. Andrew’s?\n\nThis is super silly, but the year that I was there was the first year of the Frosty Run. T-shirts were made and it was this massive event to watch the school … have an experience completely rooted in fun, but [everyone was] all in. There was a purity in that. There was a wonderful sense of excitement in that which I always loved.\n\nIn terms of individual experiences … My senior year, [former English teacher and Associate Head of School Will] Speers had suggested, ‘What would a perfect English class look like for you?’ I said, ‘I want to read a book once a week and then talk to somebody about it.’ He said, ‘Okay.’ And then he set that up for me. I sat in his office, he would give me a book. My goal was to read it, come up with an essay, and produce it. We would sit and have that conversation. That was my English class for half of senior year. What was amazing about that is that anything was possible, you just merely had to ask.\n\nHow did you begin developing as a leader at St. Andrew’s?\n\nI think probably the most important thing [I experienced] is the comfort of trying new things and the comfort to fail and not have it work out and keep it moving. That’s been pivotal.\n\nI applied to St. Andrew’s for my freshman year and I didn’t get in. They encouraged me to apply next year. And even my entry into St. Andrew’s as a 10th grader was a pivotal experience for me because it taught me to go after what I want, even if I don’t get it in the first instance.\n\nIf you are leading now, there is no example of being a leader who is always batting a thousand. It doesn’t exist. And so being able to lead others, to make decisions that embrace a growth mindset with failure and development is critical. I can very much attribute that mindset to my earlier days at school.\n\nAs Google’s general counsel, what is it like to work on cases that have such a large impact on the ways that we navigate emerging technologies?\n\nIt’s a huge responsibility at the outset, leading a very large global legal team that’s helping Google launch its products and keeping them running responsibly. I don’t take that lightly. It’s humbling, to be honest, and I look at each day as a privilege, but one in which it’s important to authentically and thoughtfully lead, take the responsibility seriously, be very open and honest about that, and guide the folks on my team to do the same.\n\nWhat advice do you have for St. Andrew’s graduates, who are leaving a mostly “phone-free” environment for a world where technology may play a greater and greater role in their life?\n\nYou’re going to have a North Star: the principles behind St. Andrew’s and the notion of faith and learning and how you show up to the community. Those principles remain true even when you walk out of Middletown and go into whatever next chapter of your world, whether that’s with a phone in hand, a computer with AI, or what have you. Really staying true to those principles of stewardship, curiosity, challenge, opportunity, and applying that into your every day. Don’t lose sight of that. That helps you step forth into something that is new or different with a bit more intention and a bit more openness.\n\nWhat was your reaction to being invited to speak at Commencement, and how are you feeling as time ticks down to the big day?\n\nI was excited, hugely excited, and then I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I’m that old that I can be asked to come back to speak.’ Part of that is because [my time at St. Andrew’s] doesn’t feel like that long ago. There is something very perpetual as it relates to the St. Andrew’s experience.\n\nFrankly, I am humbled and honored that [Head of School] Joy [McGrath ’92] thinks that something I could say might be of interest to these phenomenal young adults who are about to embark on this next chapter of their career. So I’m thrilled, really.\n\nI am so grateful to Richard for his remarks and to all the parent trustees and volunteers who are here today. Thank you, Richard. And parents, thank you for all of your support of the school. It is incredibly meaningful to all of us here that our parent body is so engaged and positive. We are so lucky to have you.\n\nWelcome, everyone! Welcome back! It is good to be together at Arts Weekend as we start to feel the culmination of the year.\n\nWhat a beautiful year it has been—your children should be very proud of themselves for all they have accomplished—and you of them!\n\nThe faculty have been absolutely amazing, and I am so grateful to them. Their dedication to the students and the school is unmatched by any group of adults at any school, anywhere. Their teaching, their coaching, their advising and parenting of your children—they have just been exemplary. I especially have to thank our magnificent Arts Department faculty, who have worked with your children throughout the year and brought out their very best in the works and performances we are going to see this weekend. I cannot thank them enough.\n\nAnd welcome to this beautiful campus, which looks just fantastic thanks to our staff members, and we are so fortunate to be able to gather here this weekend in this setting.\n\nI am looking forward to celebrating the seniors, the class of 2024, at commencement in two weeks—I am so grateful to them for their leadership. Recently, as you know, the seniors decided to have a phone-free weekend and they collected 100 percent of the students’ phones. It was an incredible weekend and on Sunday afternoon, everyone was looking so refreshed and happy and relaxed that I decided to call a free day for the following day. When I announced that we would continue to keep the phones, that decision received the biggest cheer of all.\n\nSt. Andrew’s is out of step.\n\nHolly Whyte, Class of 1936, said this at the school’s 50th anniversary and it’s still true today. We are out of step. People visit the campus and always say, “Something is different here.”\n\nAnd when you are out of step, how do you feel about that? You can experience negative emotions like fear, despair, and anxiety, and let those emotions shape your life and experience. Is everyone looking at me? Should I just join the crowd? The weight of that can be very real, and yet I see our students responding with fearlessness and hope.\n\nI see that fearlessness everywhere this Arts Weekend.\n\nGetting on stage—or for that matter on a boat, court, or field—to perform is terrifying. Putting yourself out there, knowing you are not perfect, is enough to strike fear into anyone’s heart. I don’t care how experienced you are, getting up in front of the school and hundreds of parents is nerve-racking. And in many cases, we see students learning new instruments or taking up new practices entirely, such as dance, or painting, or crew.\n\nLet’s pause for a moment and just say: this is incredibly brave! In fact, it’s no wonder that when we are profoundly stirred by a performance, we shout “bravo!” Literally: brave!\n\nIn some respect, this is what the arts are about as part of a liberal education: banishing fear. Knowing that we are not—and never will be—perfect means that we must never fear failure but rather live in the belief"
