If any village not developed it is a mistake of the elected persons. If any country not developed due to lack of working and motivating philosophers. If any country become un developed, corrupt, terrorist country it is not only lack of good philosophers but also not working philosophers on right manner and failed to motivate the general public towards sacrificing to restore as productive, peace and harmony. Where the systems fails there philosophy works and gods born there.\n\nAn excerpt from the introduction to a special issue of the journal SOPHIA by my colleague Gorazd Andrejƒç: \"touching on several themes of this special issue in a unique way, Carool Kersten‚Äôs exploration of the literary and philosophical universe of Reza Nagarestani makes for exciting, almost dizzying reading. Kersten‚Äôs contribution traces the development of Nagarestani‚Äôs thought from his earlier writings on Islamic exotericism and apocalypticism, via his most well-known work in speculative fiction, Cyclonopedia, in which, among other things, we find the idea of non-human agency and equates the ontological status of humans and nonhumans, to his later development of the so-called inhuman accelerationism where Nagarestani moves beyond antihumanist nihilism of Nick Land and Ray Brassier (Nagarestani‚Äôs earlier influences) and defines the Inhuman ‚Äòby the possibility of alternative ways of binding exteriority qua concept-less negativity‚Äô.\" https://rdcu.be/dCpZ0 https://lnkd.in/eDJG3ZgS https://lnkd.in/eMGwCXjW\n\nHate School From 1989-1999 I was fed all the hatred for the Vietnamese communist. How they destroyed the country and everything that was good. 2000-2013 I was fed how everyone was trying to harm Americans. The fear of Russian. The fear of Chinese. The fear of Arabs. Arabs were essentially synonymous with terrorists. The fear of Isreal spies, French spies, Chinese spies, Vietnamese spies, Russian spies, and everything except ‚Äî Americans. It turned out no one harmed me more than Americans. Upon further examination, it turned out Americans have been harming four generations of my family. It was an odd moment when you see the devil under the human mask. From then on it was hard to not see evil where evil stand. But the new found hatred for evil isn‚Äôt found in school. It was through countless readings about history. How many behaved across 3,000 years. It is hard to not hate such despicable evils. The unnecessary suffocating of humanity. All the lost joys. All the lost generations. Instead of dreaming about traveling the world, many have lost it all in a conflict to prove nothing. It was amazement to find a boxer like Ali talks with such timeless wisdom. As if he acquired the history of humanity across 3,000 years. My new school is of my own design. I design it for one purpose. To help me defeat evil.\n\nChinese Proverbs and Storytime, Any Given Day Ep. 5 Today is Tuesday, July 23rd, 2024. üåü In this video: * Damjan DeNoble talks about the parable of the farmer and his horse, a timeless wisdom from ancient China that teaches us about the unpredictable nature of life. \"Could be peaches, could be lunch meat.\" * He discusses the impact of modern communication tools and our tendency to catastrophize events, exploring how we can navigate these complexities. * Get a BRIEF glimpse into Project 2025 and its potential implications. \"Its the implication.\" #iykyn * Hear Damjan's personal journey and the unforgettable moment when he met Dr. Watson, a Nobel Prize winner, and how it left a lasting impression on me.
