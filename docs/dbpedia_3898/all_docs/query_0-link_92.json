This intimate interview will offer insight on the often misunderstood intersection of the theological, philosophical, and practical considerations relating to use of and practice with psychedelics within an Islamic context. From exploring mystical traditions to examining the concept of inner exploration and spiritual growth, this conversation will invite us to consider a new perspective on the possibilities of psychedelics as catalysts for spiritual awakening and a deeper - and different connection to faith and culture.\n\nJust had an article published in Metaphysica, titled 'Elucidating Atemporality'. In this article I focus on providing an elucidation of the classical theistic view of God as atemporal: timeless and impassible. A specific challenge (raised by individuals such as William Lane Craig, Nelson Pike and Ryan Mullins) is put forward against this view which concerns the possibility of an atemporal God being able to interact and preserve his creation. To deal with this difficult challenge I put forward a two stage proposal: stage one focuses on reconceptualising the nature of God, which I do through the position I term Aspectival Pluralism, which is a combination of my work on aspects, ontological pluralism, and my Trope-Theoretic Theistic view of God (where God is a maximal power trope (I prefer this terminology now compared to that of an omnipotence-trope)). And stage two focuses on reconceptualising the nature of time and persistence, by bringing together the temporal ontology of Priority Presentism, which is a novel view in the philosophy of time put forward by Sam Baron, and the view of persistence called Exdurantism, which is proposed by Ted Sider and Katherine Hawley. By progressing through these two stages I argue that we can have a metaphysically robust view of God, time and change that enables one to affirm Classical Theism (God's atemporality) and that of Divine Preservation (God's active interaction and preservation of creation). One is thus able to affirm the veracity of Classical Theism, in the face of the central issues raised by proponents of Neo-Classical Theism and Open Theism.

Publilius Syrus, a Latin writer known for his collection of maxims and moral sayings called \"Sententiae\". He was originally a Syrian slave brought to Rome in the 1st century BCE. He earned his freedom due to his wit and intelligence and eventually became a renowned mime writer and performer. His work, \"Sententiae\" is a collection of short, and quite pithy I might say LOL ü§ì, aphorisms about his ethical and philosophical reflections on human behavior. Some context for ya... In ancient Rome... the virtues of justice, honor, and moral integrity were highly esteemed, and the anger of someone embodying these virtues would carry considerable weight. When a person known for their moral integrity becomes angry, it signals a serious breach of ethical conduct or justice, thereby making their anger a powerful force to be reckoned with. Such anger is seen as more formidable because it is justified and likely to inspire action or change. Righteous anger often leads to significant social and political changes, as seen in figures like Moses, Jesus, and many reformers and activists who, driven by a profound sense of justice, have catalyzed major shifts in society that have lasted thousands of years. Perhaps our friend Publilius' wisdom might still be relevant today? Could the impact of moral authority and the transformative potential of righteous indignation lead to change? \"Beware the anger of the quiet man‚Äù ü§î\n\nTHE SAME COMPLETELY INCLUSIVE FAITH WITH ITS PRINCIPIUM OF NATURAL LAWS OF THE COMPOUNDING-CORRESPONDING-TRINITY PRESENTS AND UNFOLDS THROUGH DIFFERENT WAYS AND METHODS IN SCIENCE, PHILOSOPHY, RELIGION, ETC.
