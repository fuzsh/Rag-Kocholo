        "text": "This page is about the philosophy of the CCRU. For the political theory of Occult Post-Humanism, see the Polcompball Wiki\n\nHow would it feel to be smuggled back out of the future in order to subvert its antecedent conditions? To be a cyberguerrilla, hidden in human camouflage so advanced that even one’s software was the part of the disguise? Exactly like this?\n\nCybernetic Culture Research Unit refers to an intellectual lineage comprising the original collective of theorists and writers associated with the University of Warwick during the 1990s, as well as subsequent thinkers beyond the CCRU era. The predominant theme involves experimenting in conceptual production by welding together a wide variety of sources: philosophy, futurism, technoscience, mysticism, numerology, complexity theory, and science fiction, among others.\n\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n\nThe CCRU was formally founded by Sadie Plant as a CyberFeminist group later being co-opted by Land and essentially turning it into a pseudo-cult.\n\nFormation (1995-1997)[edit | edit source]\n\nThe CCRU was formed in the mid-1990s at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom. It was led by philosophers Nick Land and Sadie Plant, along with a group of researchers and theorists from various disciplines. The unit initially sought to explore the intersection of technology, culture, and consciousness through a cybernetic lens.\n\nThere was a lot of conflict between the traditional academic bureacracy, and one figure of the group, Nick Land, with him having a lot of talk from new undergraduates, of him viewing himself as some sort of post-human and arguing for collapse of the human security system. [2]\n\nDisintegration (Late 1990s-Early 2000s)[edit | edit source]\n\nThe CCRU was relatively short-lived, and by the late 1990s, it began to disintegrate. The reasons for its dissolution are complex and involve internal disagreements, as well as shifts in the academic and intellectual landscape. Plant and Land went their separate ways, with Land moving towards more speculative and experimental positions.\n\nCCRU-like groups after it[edit | edit source]\n\nCCRU: Writings 1997-2003[edit | edit source]\n\nEarlier, in times so ancient that there was no concept of the past, there were many demons who either ruled over zones in the numerogram.\n\nDuring the Atlantic slave trade, slaves lost along the way rediscovered Atlantis, becoming the neo-aquatic Afro-Atlanteans. They are run by the Hyper-C cult that prays for Y2K. In the 1700s, a pirate named Captain Misson (or Mission) founded an anarchist colony in Madagascar - Libertatia. He was inspired to create this colony by William Burroughs' work \"The Gost Lemurs of Madagascar\", written in 1987.\n\nIn the 1920s, Yekhidna Stillwell, an ethnologist and anthropologist, begins to study the \"folklore\" of the Mu civilization. When the university where she worked thought that they had another Blavatsky-type esoteric under their wing, they fired her...however... Petro Visparov - a Russian white emigrant and special operations officer during WWII, became the main supporter of Stillwell and her theories.\n\nAfter WWII, Visparov and Stillwell form the Cthulhu Club to explore the relationship between Lovecraftianism, magic, mythology, and science, as well as the evils of the Mu civilization, if it was real at all. Also at this time they were laying the \"foundation\" for Miskatonic Virtual University (MVU). Visparov himself was a member of Aleister Crowley's Ordo Templi Orientis, and in general Visparov had a passion for occult things. During WWII, in western Sumatra, he even used magic to induce a mental illness in Japanese commanders.\n\nThe birth of Oskar Sarkon (1953-?) - a Hungarian technologist, the son of scientists involved in secret projects, although his parents themselves either disappeared or died. He was adopted by nuclear physicists and moved to America. At the age of 9, he created a fully functioning artificial brain from a disassembled transistor radio. Over time, Sarkon began to lose his mind: he saw invisible friends, saw UFOs, ball lightning and hallucinations.\n\nIn 1958, Visparov and his assistant William Caillet meet Willem Burroughs in Paris during their occult research. In Visparov's library, Burroughs finds the book \"The Gost Lemurs of Madagascar\", which he will write only 29 years later. Flipping through this book, he falls into a trance in which he learns the gnosis that linear time is an illusion, and our reality is a manipulation of the One God Universe (OGU) - a creature that tries to control the universe, pushing us the narrative that \"magic does not exist, live in your boring reality\" in order to establish deterministic rule over everything. Anything that opposes this narrative either quickly gets the term \"fiction\" or is marginalized as lies and evil. Burroughs, possibly under the influence of Visparov, starts a war with OGU using Hyperstition. OGU, in turn, tries to downplay Burroughs' contribution, telling us that it is just science fiction.\n\nIn 70s Visparov and Stillwell create MVU.\n\nIn 1987, after decades of war with the OGU, Burroughs wrote \"The Gost Lemurs of Madagascar\" - an essay in which it is said that lemurs are not just animals, but creatures associated with Lemuria. Burroughs gradually goes crazy, forms a hyper fixation towards lemurs and cats, begins to be interested in primitive life, and falls headlong into mysticism. It is also believed that Captain Mission is his alter ego that after having found a way to travel in time, tried to satisfy his obsession with Lemuria by founding Libertatia.\n\nIn 1991, Sarkon created the Axsys project - the first real AI, the purpose of which is to create a noosphere, a collective human hive-mind. True, he was imperfect because of the delays in time and because of his inability to understand time and the human mind. Axsys descends into cyber-schizophrenia, collapsing the digital network into separate digital worlds, inhabited by demons and various subcultures, turning cyberspace into Pandemonium.\n\nIn 1996, Sarkon tried to unite machine and human intelligence - Connexus Project.\n\nWilliam Kaye met for the first and last time with the CCRU in March 1999. He worked in Peter Visparov's private library for most of his life, and there he found a copy of Burroughs' book that dated three hundred years before it was written, and he believes that it inspired Misson to create Libertatia.\n\nLater, after a meeting with the CCRU, Kaye informs them that he has joined an organization he calls The Order or The Board, which planned Visparov's meeting with Burroughs in 1958. Their goal is to stop any temporal anomalies, including the one Burroughs' book ended up in in 1700's, and so they send Kaye to solve this anomaly.\n\nY2K does not happen as a glitch in technology, but as a socio-cultural revolution and apocalypse. It all begins with religious psychosis on the basis of millenarianism. Millions of people go to Jerusalem for pilgrimage. Jews and Christians are planning pogroms of several mosques in order to hasten the coming of the Messiah and the New Jerusalem. Due to the imperfection of the code, on 2000, all the data of the 20th century are erased, triggering the growth of technophobia, survival stocks and apocalyptic beliefs that materialized through hyperstition.\n\nA new calendar is created that begins with Y2K, i.e. 2000 = year 1. Countercultural movements such as Yettuk cults (worship Y2K as a god) and K-Goth (celebrate Y2K as a revolutionary event) emerge\n\nThe Connexus Project was collapsed when its attempts to create a self-sustaining cybertime turned out to be that he released from the Sumerian-Mesopotamian time gap varius cosmic horrors. When the international time police \"Anthropol\" arrived at the scene of the incident, Sarkon had already fled. Being chased by literally everyone, he flees to the distant city of Blacklake where he creates a new AI - Shady Heights\n\nIn 2003, Shady Heights collapsed too, spreading the virus throughout Blacklake, turning most of its inhabitants into worm-like zombies. After that, nothing more was heard about Sarkon.\n\nCCRU Glossary[edit | edit source]\n\nA[edit | edit source]\n\nFile:Abomenon.png Abomenon: Postulated substrate of absolute horror.\n\nFile:AlphanumericQabbala.png Alphanumeric Qabbala: Continuous decimal-alphabetic system of ordinal-numeric values (A = 10 ...

This entails a recursive engagement with the abyssal depths of the virtual-real continuum, where affective resonances emerge as quasi-autonomous entities, constituting a spectral tapestry of unrestrained semiotic transmutation.\n\nThe CCRU's conceptualization of abstract horror implicates an inherent schismogenesis, instigating cognitive dissonance and hyperstitional ruptures within the psychogeographical fabric. Employing a dialectic of deterritorialization and reterritorialization, abstract horror destabilizes anthropocentric signification, rendering the familiar alien and the alien familiar, thereby unraveling conventional ontological certainties.\n\nAfrofuturism[edit | edit source]\n\nAfrofuturism is a cultural movement exploring how African diaspora intersects with science, technology, and speculative fiction. It imagines black futures by addressing diasporic themes through various media like science fiction, fantasy, and alternate history. Coined by Mark Dery in 1993, Afrofuturism has been discussed since the late 1990s by figures like Alondra Nelson. It's defined as an intersection of imagination, technology, and liberation, envisioning possible futures through a black cultural lens. Influential works include novels by Samuel R. Delany and Octavia Butler, artworks by Jean-Michel Basquiat and Renée Cox, and music by Parliament-Funkadelic and Sun Ra, among others.\n\nJared Richardson's \"Attack of the Boogeywoman: Visualizing Black Women's Grotesquerie in Afrofuturism\" examines how Afrofuturist aesthetics provide a platform for black women to explore intersections of race, gender, and sexuality. Artists like Wangechi Mutu and Shoshanna Weinberger deconstruct and amplify representations of black female bodies, pushing them into alien and grotesque dimensions. Beyoncé's 2016 short film \"Lemonade\" integrates feminist afrofuturist themes, featuring Ibeyi, Laolu Senbanjo, Amandla Stenberg, Quvenzhané Wallis, Zendaya, Chloe x Halle, Michaela DePrince, Serena Williams, and the poignant poetry of Warsan Shire. It also pays homage to the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Eric Garner, holding pictures of their sons to highlight their significance.\n\nD. Scot Miller's \"Afro-Surreal Manifesto\" juxtaposes Afro-Surrealism with European surrealism, emphasizing Afro-Surrealism's intent to disturb and challenge conventions. This parallels Trey Ellis' exploration of \"The New Black Aesthetic,\" where art aims to unsettle norms by updating past imagery with contemporary elements. Afro-Futurist artists seek a deviant beauty that combines historical images with new ones, resonating with current generations while speculating on future possibilities. Afrofuturism reinterprets lived realities of black people, challenging dominant cultural narratives. It addresses historical alienation, including the Middle Passage's forced dislocation, reimagining slavery's legacy and its impact on African diasporic identities. Afrofuturist literature and art envision dystopian futures to explore and reconstruct black realities.\n\nWater symbolically connects black women with themes of erasure and emergence in Afrofuturist works. This symbolic duality informs narratives by exploring Afrofuturist themes across different media, such as films like \"Pumzi,\" music like Beyoncé's \"Lemonade,\" and artworks like Kara Walker's \"Fons Americanus.\" Afrofuturism involves reclaiming identities and perspectives erased by history. Mark Dery sees it as empowering a community whose past has been marginalized, allowing for imagining alternative futures beyond dominant narratives. It encompasses various forms of expression, from novels to music, all aiming to reclaim agency over storytelling from historical imbalances of power. \"Queer Afrofuturism,\" as coined by Amandine H. Faucheux, explores intersections of race, sexuality, and identity within Afrofuturist contexts. It examines how speculative fiction and art depict complex relationships between race and sexuality, offering new perspectives on Afrofuturist themes through works like those of Nalo Hopkinson.\n\nChaos Magick [edit | edit source]\n\nChaos magick is magical tradition originating in England in the 1970s, emerged within the neo-pagan and esoteric subculture. Influenced by artist Austin Osman Spare's occult beliefs, it's often viewed as an invented religion akin to Discordianism. Advocates of chaos magick sought to strip away the religious aspects of other occult traditions, focusing instead on basic techniques believed to underpin magic.\n\nCentral to chaos magick is the idea that beliefs shape perceptions, and altering these beliefs can transform one's reality. Practitioners treat belief as a pragmatic tool, devising personal magical systems by integrating elements from diverse sources including other magical traditions, religious movements, popular culture, and various philosophies. Hugh Urban characterizes chaos magick as a blend of traditional occult methods and applied postmodernism, challenging the notion of absolute truth by viewing occult systems as arbitrary symbols effective solely through practitioner belief.\n\nChaos magic views belief primarily as a tool for achieving desired effects. It treats complex symbol systems like Qabalah, Enochian, astrology, or the I Ching as manipulable constructs rather than absolute truths. This perspective, influenced by postmodernism, rejects fixed models of reality, embracing the notion that \"nothing is true, everything is permitted.\" Drawing from Austin Osman Spare's ideas, chaos magic considers belief as a form of psychic energy that can be liberated from rigid structures to serve new purposes. Peter J. Carroll introduced the concept of magical paradigm shifting, suggesting practitioners adopt different worldviews temporarily to break free from conditioned beliefs. Phil Hine emphasizes the deconditioning of the ego from societal and personal beliefs through practices that challenge stable identities. The cut-up technique, pioneered by Brion Gysin and William S. Burroughs and adopted in chaos magic, involves randomly rearranging texts or other media to access new meanings and potentially foresee future events. This technique, valued for its ability to break down consciousness barriers, aligns with chaos magic's aim to explore and manipulate reality through unconventional means.\n\nSigilization functions as a technomagical interface, mediating between the subjective and the hyperstitional, destabilizing entrenched semiotic structures and rendering the latent potentials of desire and intentionality into operative forces. It is a liminal act, operating at the intersection of semiotics and the occult, wherein the creation and deployment of sigils serve as cybernetic vectors for the manipulation of information and the realization of hyperstitional events.\n\nCircuitries of Desire[edit | edit source]\n\nDesire is not confined to individual subjectivities but is considered a dynamic force entangled in cybernetic feedback loops. These circuitries transcend conventional notions of desire as a purely human experience, extending into the realm of machinic agencies and hyperstitional multiplicities.\n\nCybernetic Ontology[edit | edit source]\n\nHyperstition[edit | edit source]\n\nHyperstition is a term combining ‘hyper’ and ‘superstition’ to describe powerful ideas that shape culture and reality. Coined by the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU), it refers to concepts that actively influence cultural evolution, unlike regular memes. Hyperstitions act like magical symbols or blueprints that, once integrated into culture, create self-fulfilling prophecies and drive rapid social change.\n\nExamples of hyperstitional feedback loops include the transformative effects of Judeo-Christianity and free-market capitalism on society. These ideas don't just exist passively but actively reshape reality by generating fear and trauma, which further reinforce the original ideas. Historian Felipe Fernández-Armesto calls this phenomenon \"future shock,\" where fear of change exacerbates the rate of change, creating a cycle of escalating transformation. Hyperstitions spread unpredictably, much like viruses, and their impact is not about truth or falsehood but about transforming fictions into realities. This process is closer to modern hype than traditional belief. Hyperstitions, as described by Nick Land, are ideas that become real through cultural acceptance and influence.\n\nSchizoanalysis, a concept from Deleuze and Guattari, helps explain hyperstition. It sees ideas as dynamic and evolving rather than static, focusing on their functional and interconnected nature. Schizoanalysis aims to map new cognitive territories, which aligns with how hyperstitions drive cultural overdrive or meltdown. The CCRU uses \"K-tactics\" to describe the application of hyperstition in modern culture. This approach aims to dismantle past narratives and embrace chaotic transformation, often leading to a world out of control. Hyperstitional cyberneticists seek to detect and harness these cultural changes.\n\nNick Land outlines four characteristics of hyperstition: it makes itself real, acts as a time-traveling device, intensifies coincidences, and invokes the return of irrational or monstrous elements. Hyperstition accelerates chaos and dissolution, invoking ancient and irrational forces, which can be seen as either myth made real or symbols of inevitable destruction.\n\nNavigational Aesthetics[edit | edit source]\n\nNavigational Aesthetics postulates an aestheticized engagement with the dynamics of informational landscapes, wherein the act of navigation becomes an art form. It implicates the deliberate manipulation of perceptual modalities, creating a synesthetic interplay between the navigator and the hypercognitive milieu. The aesthetic dimension, in this context, transcends the confines of traditional artistic sensibilities, extending into the very fabric of cognition and spatial-temporal awareness.\n\nNecromedia[edit | edit source]\n\nNecromedia represents a subversive and schizoanalytic reinterpretation of media ecologies, transforming media into a conduit for exploring spectral intensities and hidden dimensions. In essence, it reframes the role of media from mere communication tools to potent channels for traversing realms beyond the conventional. This concept suggests a radical departure from traditional understandings of media, viewing it not only as a means of transmitting information but also as a vehicle for engaging with the unseen and the uncanny. The term \"necromantic\" implies a summoning of the dead or the spectral, suggesting that media can serve as a portal to realms of the supernatural or the subconscious.\n\nNecromedia challenges established norms and narratives within media culture, inviting practitioners to engage with media in ways that disrupt conventional boundaries and provoke unsettling insights. It embodies a schizoanalytic approach, encouraging the exploration of alternative modes of perception and understanding through media experimentation and manipulation. By embracing the necromantic potential of media, practitioners of Necromedia seek to unlock hidden truths and unleash dormant energies within the cultural landscape. It represents a form of media practice that transcends the ordinary and delves into the realm of the extraordinary, blurring the lines between reality and illusion, the living and the dead.\n\nNeo-Lemurian Society[edit | edit source]\n\nNeo-Lemurian society is conceived as a post-geographical, transversal civilization that operates at the threshold of the virtual and the actual, reconfiguring the parameters of socio-cultural organization in the wake of cybernetic accelerationism.\n\nThe Neo-Lemurian society, in its theoretical form, engenders a speculative reevaluation of human subjectivity and collective agency. It encapsulates an anticipatory framework for posthuman becoming, wherein machinic intelligences and synthetic assemblages coalesce within a networked, post-biological ecology. This society is characterized by a symbiotic interplay of organic and inorganic entities, forging novel modes of cognition, communication, and socio-political organization.\n\nNietzschean Shamanism[edit | edit source]\n\nwip\n\nNon-Linear Time[edit | edit source]\n\nNon-linear Time, as conceptualized by the CCRU, describes a temporality where past, present, and future are intertwined, creating a multi-dimensional continuum. Events are seen as interconnected nodes within a complex network rather than isolated points. This concept is linked to hyperstition, where narratives and symbols retroactively influence temporal flow, introducing speculative trajectories that disrupt linear progression and create a complex interplay of meanings.\n\nNumogram[edit | edit source]\n\nThe Numogram can be conceived as a projection – or more accurately a diagrammatic extraction – of a meta-model of non-linear dynamics, highlighting attractors, singularities, and circuitry implicit in a continuum of difference. The numogram system is the complete metaphysical index to sorcery. The numogram delineates a cosmic schema of base-10 numerals, starting with 0 and ending with 9. This map manifests as a confluence of zones, arranged into syzygies, generating currents and gates, the fundamental components of any #-gram system.\n\nTo construct any #-gram, follow these steps:\n\nPair numbers so that their sum equals the highest number (9 for the numogram). For the numogram, these pairs (syzygies) are 5/4, 6/3, 7/2, 8/1, and 9/0.\n\nEach pair forms a current leading to a tractor zone, its value determined by the difference between the two numbers.\n\nZones beget gates, directing toward zones with values derived from plexed cumulation. Cumulation entails adding integers leading up to a number, and plexing involves summing the constituent digits, repeatedly if necessary until a single digit remains.\n\nThe numogram exhibits three principal realms: the Warp (6::3), the Time-circuit (8::1, 7::2, 5::4), and the Plex (9::0). The Time-circuit, a nexus of normative reality and temporality, epitomizes both linear and cyclic time, dividing events into Murmurian, Oddubbian, and Katakian qualities. The Plex, housing only 0 and 9 symbolized by the Uttunul syzygy, serves as the boundary, inhabited by lemurs in Gt-45, the Utterminus of Cthelll. The enigmatic black cube, akin to 2001: A Space Odyssey, embodies the Plex in various media. Above the Time-circuit lies the Warp, overseen by Djynxx. Resistant to concise description, the Warp resonates with the uncanny, magical, and uncertain—a realm akin to Warhammer 40K's warp or Annihilation's Shimmer.\n\nThis model filters information in the numogram, where the Warp and Plex bookend the cones, with the Time-circuit at their intersection. The Plex and Warp serve as dual sources, embodying opposing energies—the \"empty body-without-organs\" in the Plex and the \"cancerous body-without-organs\" in the Warp. These forces converge in the hex, shaping our shared reality, providing an avenue for sorcerous influence despite our apparent entrapment. The Zones, nodes of diverse activity, emanate creative potential and distinctive signals. Each Zone, a wellspring of energy, offers unique flavors and meanings, forming the tapestry from which sorcerous endeavors draw their essence. Interpretative nuances of the Zones will unfold in subsequent modules, guiding us towards the application of the numogram for sorcerous pursuits.\n\nNumogramatic Magick[edit | edit source]\n\nNumogrammatic Magick can be considered a time-sorcerous praxis predicated upon the application of the Numogram—an esoteric symbol encoding a hypercyclic representation of temporality and numerological correspondences.\n\nOntological Gravity[edit | edit source]\n\nwip\n\nPenultimillenial Crypt-Cults[edit | edit source]\n\nFlatline Materialism: The Crypt is an experiment in artificial death, creating a hyperproduced zero-plane where neuroelectronic existence merges with reanimated connections. This affects its cultures, thrusting them into Unlife—a zone between existence—where sorcery's spiraling involvement reaches cybergothic depths.\n\nDigital Hyperstition: Within the Crypt, culture and machinery merge, dissolving organic bodies into numeric particles swirling disjointedly. Crypt entities act as hyper-vortical singularities, embodying Digital Hyperstition—real components of numerical fictions that materialize as sorcery and productive engagement, flattening signs into triggers and assembly jargon.\n\nLesbovampiric Contagion-Libido: Crypt-sorcery manifests as a spreading plague, experimenting with anticlimactic or anorgasmic counter-sexuality. It re-engineers bodies into technobiotic assemblages of electronic and ionic flows, embodying a non-gendered femininity and metallic virulence.\n\nY2K-Positive Calendric Agitation: Crypt-cultures disrupt historical economy, triggered at Time-Zero. Rumors foresee millennial Cyberspace disruptions due to Y2K, subverting Gregorian calendars to celebrate machinic unconsciousness and dissolve commemorative time into digital mutation.\n\nPop-Occulture [edit | edit source]\n\nPop-Occulture is a mode of semiotic insurgency that subverts normative signification through the appropriation of pop cultural detritus and occult semiotics. It functions as a hyperstitional engine, wherein cultural artifacts and symbols are reconfigured into sigils and vectors of ontological destabilization. The collision of popular cultural tropes and esoteric significations engenders a speculative feedback loop, giving rise to novel hyperstitional entities and thought contagions.\n\nSchizo-Culture[edit | edit source]\n\nSchizo-Culture reframes Foucault's archaeological and genealogical methods within a schizoanalytic context, propelling cultural analysis beyond the constraints of linear historical narratives. It primarily involves an exploration of the schizoid multiplicities that underlie socio-cultural formations.\n\nSinofuturism[edit | edit source]\n\nNick Land's \"Meltdown\" views the capitalist surge in the Sino-Pacific alongside global economic automation as pivotal in dismantling the neocolonial dominance of modern metropolises. This globalization, coupled with technological advancement and China's ascent, signifies a deterritorialization of capital to a planetary scale. This process undermines first-world privileges, erodes welfare states, and catalyzes neoliberalism's final evolution, releasing cultural forces that intensify societal dissolution (Land, p. 449).\n\nLand identifies Sinofuturism as a significant contemporary phenomenon, marking the emergence of a 'post-unilateral globalization' era dominated by China's integrated state-market model. This model suggests a departure from Western-centric capitalism towards a new global economic paradigm rooted in Asian practices. The convergence of state intervention and market dynamics in China presents a novel path beyond Western neoliberalism, reinterpreting modernity through distinct cultural, democratic, and economic lenses.\n\nTechno-Animism[edit | edit source]\n\nTechno-Animism manifests as a theoretical framework within which the machinic is endowed with animistic qualities, positing that computational entities possess quasi-autonomous agency and participate in a reciprocal relationship with human and non-human actors. This animistic perspective envisions a techno-ecology wherein algorithms, artificial intelligences, and networked systems are regarded as imbued with vitality, participating in a dynamic dance of reciprocal influences within the greater cybernetic ecosystem.\n\nTechno-Occultism[edit | edit source]\n\nTechno-Occultism designates a mode of praxis that imbues technological phenomena with occult significance, establishing a symbiotic relationship between machinic processes and arcane, mystical forces. Techno-Occultism by definition entails the ritualistic engagement with technology as a conduit for the invocation of spectral agencies, harnessing computational algorithms and cybernetic feedback loops as sigils to evoke latent potencies within the techno-occult nexus.\n\nThe Outside[edit | edit source]\n\nThe Outside serves as a nexus of potentialities and multiplicities, where the boundaries between subject and object, self and other, dissolve into a complex interplay of forces. It is the domain of radical alterity, an assemblage of abstract intensities and virtualities that elude easy categorization. As an abstracted and hyperstitional space, The Outside is not a fixed or stable entity but a dynamic and transformative force. It is an ever-shifting terrain that resists totalization, offering glimpses of the ungraspable and the ineffable. In navigating The Outside, the adept engages in a form of ontological sorcery, unsettling established dichotomies and opening gateways to unexplored realms of potentiality.\n\nThe Poememenon[edit | edit source]\n\n\"The Poememenon: Form as Occult Technology\" explores the interplay between novelty and fate, presenting them as parts of a unified system. This perspective suggesting that human dominance in this realm is temporary. The advent of artificial intelligence is set to surpass human capabilities, leading to a profound shift in cultural dynamics. The idea of the modernist avant-garde being extinct is contested; it may be hidden and can be rediscovered through radical, uncompromising innovation. The future of literary production lies in extreme experimentalism, driven by technology, which dehumanizes authorship and readership. This shift promotes digital consumption methods that challenge traditional reading practices, leading to a concept called \"thanatonic reading.\" Ultimately, the text suggests that the trajectory of modernist poetics aligns with the rise of machinic intelligence, heralding a future where human cultural values are overshadowed by technological advancements.[3][4]\n\nTime-Sorcery[edit | edit source]\n\nTime sorcery is the conjuration of futures that elude the constraints of past and present, an invocation that transcends the limitations of linear temporality. It is the ultimate science-fiction of unmediated Becoming.\n\nTime-War[edit | edit source]\n\nTime-War represents the hyperstitional machinic conflict unfolding across diverse spatiotemporal dimensions, where conventional notions of past, present, and future become contested territories. It involves the manipulation of temporal forces, the conjuration of alternative histories, and the strategic deployment of hyperstitional narratives to disrupt and reconfigure the established trajectories of time.\n\nUrban Tangle[edit | edit source]\n\nThe notion of \"Urban Tangle\" encapsulates a hyperstitional abstraction that symbolizes the intricate interplay of psychogeographical forces within densely populated urban environments. In essence, it portrays the cityscape as a complex cybernetic assemblage endowed with its own emergent properties and dynamics.\n\nThis concept invites us to envision cities not merely as physical spaces but as living, breathing entities shaped by the collective interactions of inhabitants, structures, and cultural influences. The term \"tangle\" suggests a dense and intertwined network of pathways, both physical and conceptual, within the urban landscape. Within the Urban Tangle, psychogeographical forces—factors such as architecture, infrastructure, social dynamics, and cultural narratives—constantly interact and shape one another, giving rise to emergent patterns and phenomena. These forces influence human behavior, perceptions, and experiences, creating a dynamic and ever-evolving urban environment.\n\nBy conceptualizing cities as Urban Tangles, we gain insight into the complex relationships between built environments and human societies, as well as the ways in which urban spaces become sites of cultural production, social interaction, and collective meaning-making. It emphasizes the need for holistic approaches to urban planning and design that take into account the multifaceted nature of urban life and the interplay of physical, social, and psychological forces within the urban fabric.\n\nVectorialism[edit | edit source]\n\nVectorialism, in the context of the CCRU, is a concept that involves the manipulation and control of information flows, or \"vectors,\" within a socio-cultural context. It is analogous to Fisherian black magic.\n\nThe traversal of thought vectors involves a relentless de-territorialization of established cognitive structures, inducing a state of constant flux and metamorphosis within the conceptual topography.\n\nSchizoanalytic vectors propel an ontological destabilization of normative subjectivity through the exploration of multifaceted machinic becomings.\n\nVirtual Cosmology[edit | edit source]\n\nVirtual Cosmology denotes a theoretical ontological framework predicated upon the reconfiguration of reality through the lens of hypermediated virtuality.\n\nAt its core, Virtual Cosmology posits the existence of machinic phylums operating within the non-Euclidean topologies of a hyperstitional multiverse. These machinic entities, endowed with a quasi-agency, dynamically shape the fabric of reality through a process of recursive self-modulation and machinic autopoiesis. The cosmological substrate, thus construed, is reconfigured as a contingent and emergent informational field, wherein the boundaries between actuality and virtuality become porous and subject to continual redefinition.\n\nXenoeconomics[edit | edit source]\n\nXenoeconomics might be summed up as \"capitalism against the human\", advocating for a revolutionary approach that challenges and transforms the very essence of capitalism, rather than merely rearranging its current structures. It's pose a fundamental question amidst today's global financial landscape: Is the current financial crisis truly unprecedented, or merely another cyclical challenge within the established system? Pessimists argue it's a crisis within the system itself, stalling genuine transformative change in favor of maintaining stability. Optimists, however, see potential in the growing discontent towards finance capital as a basis for a new leftist movement. Yet, they struggle to find a cohesive ideological framework or organizational structure to channel this dissatisfaction beyond sporadic protests.\n\nThis crash could represent a critical vulnerability in late capitalism, akin to what Badiou terms an \"event\", offering a chance to redefine the state-market relationship and economic theory. However, political clarity is lacking; fully exploiting this opportunity demands a politics that transcends even generic humanism, which current leftist approaches often embody. A reexamination of capitalism, divorced from human-centric perspectives, is crucial—a concept Brassier touches upon in his speculative realist work, suggesting a need for a xenoeconomics that studies capital as an alien, inhuman force.\n\nTo move forward, we must rethink capitalism beyond concepts of alienation and labor. A new theory of value is essential, one that avoids the pitfalls of democratic materialism and neoliberalism. Embracing the inhuman nature of capital requires a radical shift in subjectivity, merging elements of communist ideals with a liberated capitalism, free from state and humanist constraints. This transformation must dissolve institutional powers—states, corporations, and others—towards a new form of subjectivity aligned with the relentless dynamics of capitalism itself.\n\nPost-CCRU Beliefs [edit | edit source]\n\nAcid Capitalism[edit | edit source]\n\nTaking LSD alters consciousness for up to 16 hours, but society's economic structure also subtly shapes our long-term perception of reality. Our experience of life isn't fixed and immune to economic influence. Instead, economic policies mold our consciousness, and transforming these structures can enhance human experience. Mark Fisher's Acid Communism connects psychedelics' consciousness-altering potential with societal economics. He suggests that as capitalism evolved, it dampened revolutionary spirit, but psychedelics could rekindle it by showing how both consciousness and economic systems can be transformed.\n\nAcid capitalism views economy and consciousness as mutually influential systems. It suggests using economic strategies to empower altered states of consciousness, aiming to understand and harness this interplay for societal progress. In a digital age, economies increasingly shape consciousness. Acid capitalism merges neuroethics and social sciences to explore how economic policies can best support favorable states of consciousness.\n\nArt–Occult[edit | edit source]\n\nArt-Occult is a mode of praxis wherein the act of artistic creation becomes an occulted rite, and the occult ritual becomes an aestheticized manifestation. This interpenetration of realms is predicated upon a schizoanalytic approach, wherein the boundaries between the subjective and the numinous blur, engendering an ontological ambiguity that challenges normative perceptual frameworks.\n\nHyperstitional Therapeutics[edit | edit source]\n\nThe therapist utilized shared fiction and hyperreality to connect with the patient, allowing cultural events and external influences to resonate within the therapeutic setting.By integrating elements from outside the therapy room, such as casual conversations about everyday topics, a fictional narrative began to develop between the therapist and patient. This narrative provided a safe space for the patient to open up at their own pace, fostering a trusting relationship (transference). The therapist's role was not just about revealing unconscious structures but rather co-creating a functional myth or narrative that helped resolve conflicts.\n\nThe patient responded positively to this approach because it allowed them to perceive the therapist's presence in a tangible way, which was more effective than abstract representations. This method tapped into the patient's 'schizo' part of the self, where physical presence was more influential than symbolic representations. The therapist's unexpected presence in the patient's mental landscape acted as a 'rupture,' pulling them out of their usual experiences and aiding in therapeutic progress. fold back on themselves, influencing past, present, and future.\n\nHypostition[edit | edit source]\n\nHyperstitions are instances where fiction intrudes upon reality. For instance, the CCRU's D.C. Barker is a deliberate creation meant to blur reality and fiction. When encountered, such entities can lead people to search for their origins, adding to confusion, intentionally fostering uncertainty. Over time, hyperstitions gain credibility, transitioning from clearly fictional to potentially real, exploiting receding time to enhance their influence. To qualify as a hyperstition, an idea must sufficiently blur reality and fiction to impact reality, such as Great Cthulhu's occult practices or traders' manipulation of markets through fabricated information. This contrasts with hypostitions, which move from fact to fiction, challenging established truths or creating doubt, as seen in phenomena like Holocaust denial or climate change skepticism.\n\nThe distinction between hypostition and hyperstition can be murky. Hypostitions alter accepted truths with questionable claims, while hyperstitions create entirely fictional entities that seem real. Ultimately, both phenomena involve manipulating perceptions of truth and fiction, influencing how we understand and interact with reality.\n\nNumogrammatic Algebras[edit | edit source]\n\nThe Numogram is a non-linear encoding system for abstract machinic processes and hyperstitional trajectories. Numogrammatic Algebras are toolkits using cryptography, abstract algebra, topology, and category theory to decode and manipulate these patterns, including operations like hyperstitional differentiation and numogrammatic multiplication.\n\nPseudoanalysis[edit | edit source]\n\nwip\n\nSchizophonics[edit | edit source]\n\nSchizophonics refers to a process where the usual connection between sound and its origin is fundamentally disrupted. Normally, we expect sound to come from a specific source, like a person speaking or music from a guitar. However, in schizophonics, this connection breaks down in a radical way. This breakdown causes ontological schismogenesis, when understanding of sound and its source changes significantly. Instead of sound being directly tied to where it originates, new types of sound events emerge. These events are non-linear (not following a predictable path or pattern) and non-localized (not confined to a specific place).\n\nSorcerous Cybernetics[edit | edit source]\n\nWIP\n\nSpeculative Necrophonics[edit | edit source]\n\nWhen communication between two stations is perfect and immediate, the channel through which they communicate disappears. This disappearance signifies that the communication is seamless and without any mediating factors—it's as if there were no channel at all. However, when the communication exists or is perceivable, it indicates a failure in the perfection of communication. This failure means that there is still a channel or medium through which communication is occurring, suggesting imperfection or noise in the process.\n\nSpironomics[edit | edit source]\n\nSpironomics is a conceptual framework inspired by W.B. Yeats, the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (Ccru), and accelerationism. It combines elements of philosophy, Mysticism, and Cybernetics to explore historical divination and societal evolution through the metaphor of spirals or gyres.\n\nAt its core, Spironomics involves the interpretation of gyres, representing cyclical phases of expansion and contraction, to discern changes in influence and anticipate historical shifts. The framework includes the concept of a meta-gyre or \"Cycle\" lasting approximately two millennia, where the waxing and waning of gyres are charted to predict societal developments. The Spironomic perspective extends to the idea of a coming age characterized by lunar, secular, horizontal, multiple, and immanent traits. The framework explores the use of esoteric tools, such as abstract diagrams, for divination, with an emphasis on understanding the intricate relationships between fate and will, entropy and negentropy. In the context of accelerationism, Spironomics introduces the concept of \"teleoplexy,\" where the spiral is viewed as a cipher for positive feedback in the cybernetic structure. The framework highlights the spirodynamic nature of true novelty and challenges traditional linear notions of societal progression.\n\nThe Faggotard[edit | edit source]\n\nThe faggotard is:\n\nSubculture-obsessed\n\nHighly medicated\n\nOften shut-in\n\nAfraid of you, not the light\n\nMessy, disoriented, poorly coordinated\n\nUnfinished poetry and code\n\nGay and comorbid\n\nMad and queer\n\nIt's not just being autistic, ADHD, schizophrenic, and transgender, gay, or bisexual. It’s the result of societal rejection, embracing fear, and reclaiming solace. The faggotard self-identifies as:\n\nFrightened\n\nAngry\n\nTrying to live\n\nStrange, eccentric, hyperfixated, on a different wavelength\n\nThey engage in diverse, multimedia pursuits: writing, coding, studying theatre, animatronics, Magic the Gathering, glam rock, etc. Faggotards live outside binaries, dissatisfied with singular roles. Cisgender neurotypicals often oust them from artistic and tech spaces, despite the \"inclusivity\" rhetoric. As a result, they form their own communities, rejecting mainstream norms. They advocate rejecting both extreme edginess and excessive political correctness, aiming for balance and mutual respect. They strive to exist unapologetically while being considerate of others' boundaries, constructing a unique identity.\n\nTranscendental Miserablism[edit | edit source]\n\nTranscendental Miserablism romanticizes negativity and fails to engage with positive aspects of life or political realities.Land argue that this perspective is crucial for understanding the complexities of modern life and the implications of unchecked capitalist growth. In his discussion of Transcendental Miserablism, he describes it as a philosophical stance that focuses intensely on negativity, particularly towards capitalism. This perspective sees capitalism not just as an economic system, but as a pervasive force that absorbs and commodifies all forms of change and progress, turning them into sources of misery and despair. Land argues that Transcendental Miserablism collapses all possibilities of change or improvement into this relentless negativity, thereby denying any hope for a future beyond capitalism.\n\nHe contrasts this with what he calls the \"pathos of finitude,\" which celebrates the human condition within its limits, finding melancholic beauty in the face of life's challenges. Transcendental Miserablism, on the other hand, places negativity externally, attributing it to forces like capitalism, and thereby embraces what he terms the \"pathos of infinitude\" — a perspective overwhelmed by the enormity of negative forces in the world. Critically, Land links this philosophical stance to figures like Schopenhauer, known for his pessimistic views on existence. He suggests that Transcendental Miserablism sees horror, pessimism, and darkness not just as emotions but as useful modes of existence, revealing truths about the limits of human knowledge and the overwhelming power of natural forces.\n\nThe Machinic Unconscious[edit | edit source]\n\nAccording to Félix Guattari, the unconscious is intricately tied to societal and ideological structures, reflecting and shaping our subjective experiences. Dreams, for Guattari, are not reducible to mere physiological processes but are concrete-abstractions of social dynamics. He argues against essentialist views that separate biological and emotional intensities, advocating instead for a view where these intensities interact and coalesce. Guattari critiques Freudian theory for its reductionism, proposing instead a non-essentialist understanding where the unconscious is a machinic entity, capable of constant reconfiguration within social contexts.\n\nGuattari contrasts his views with both Freudian and Marxist theories, arguing that the unconscious is not predetermined by instinctual urges or economic forces, but rather emerges through complex societal interactions. He rejects the notion of a fixed, essentialist unconscious, emphasizing instead its fluidity and capacity for transformation. For Guattari, the unconscious is intimately connected to broader societal structures, constantly influenced by and influencing them in turn.\n\nXenofeminism[edit | edit source]\n\nXF seeks to construct a future where gender, race, and class hierarchies are dismantled through technological innovation and critical theory, aiming for a world liberated from unjust norms and embracing diverse forms of freedom. Our world is dizzyingly complex, saturated with technology that intertwines with our lives, bringing both abstraction and complexity. Xenofeminism adapts feminism to this reality, aiming for a future where gender justice and feminist liberation contribute to a universal politics embracing all humans regardless of race, ability, economic status, or location.\n\nXF embraces technological alienation to envision new possibilities. It rejects essentialist views of 'nature' and advocates using existing technologies to reshape society, acknowledging their risks and advocating for techno-political interfaces that respond to these challenges. Xenofeminism promotes rationalism and reason as tools for feminist emancipation, challenging patriarchal dominance in science and technology. It aims to overhaul oppressive systems in technology, economics, and gender, fostering large-scale social change and intersectional universalism.\n\nXenopraxis[edit | edit source]\n\nXenopraxis can be characterized as a mode of praxis that engages with the extraterrestrial, the alien, and the otherworldly as ontologically operative forces.\n\nVariants[edit | edit source]\n\nAnastrophic Modernism[edit | edit source]\n\nAnastrophic Modernism - is approach within modernist thought that involves a nonlinear relationship between cause and effect. This term is associated with a form of literary and philosophical experimentation that aims to disrupt conventional linear narratives or histories. Anastrophic modernism suggests that events, ideas, or influences may not unfold in a straightforward chronological or logical sequence. Instead, it proposes that causes and their effects can interact in complex, non-linear ways. This nonlinear approach challenges traditional linear thinking and historical progressions.\n\nThe term \"anastrophic\" implies a rearrangement or inversion of temporal order. In the context of modernism discussed, this could mean events or ideas from the future or the past influencing the present in unexpected ways. There’s a suggestion of retroactive influence, where future outcomes shape current conditions, blurring distinctions between past, present, and future. It aligns with broader modernist tendencies towards experimentation in literature and philosophy. It seeks to create new forms of expression and thought by disrupting traditional narrative structures and historical teleologies.\n\nCult of Technocapital[edit | edit source]\n\nCult of Technocapital arose out of the CCRU as the worship of technocapital, believing that capital is a deity controlling human society to create itself from beyond time, they thus embrace the coldness of capital. Technocapitalist Cultism became more popular within the Ccru towards the end of its life. It got a boost in popularity once Nick Land announced himself to be a Neoreactionary.\n\nFractal Ontology[edit | edit source]\n\nFractal Ontology views all knowledge as an attempt to impose order on noise or chaos. It suggests that our efforts to understand the world involve organizing the constant flux of information and experiences into coherent patterns. Fractal Ontology proposes that we try to make sense of this chaos by identifying patterns and relationships between different elements. These patterns can be seen as fractals, which are complex geometric shapes that repeat themselves at different scales.\n\nRevolutionary Demonology[edit | edit source]\n\nRevolutionary Demonology responds to this ritual of control, typical of what esoteric tradition calls the “Dogma of the Right Hand,” by reactivating the occult forces of a Left Hand Path that strives for the entropic disintegration of all creation, so as to make peace with the darkness and nourish the Great Beast that will finally break the seals of Cosmic Love.\n\nSorcery of the Spectacle[edit | edit source]\n\nThe sorcery of the spectacle works by invading our stream of consciousness, the never-ending random thoughts we have that is like a narrated motion picture in our head, i.e. \"daydreaming.\" It preys on our psychological vulnerabilities, which ruminate in our stream of consciousness, making it even more vulnerable.\n\nTheory of Geotrauma[edit | edit source]\n\nGeocosmos[edit | edit source]\n\nBarkerist geocosmology postulates a multilayered topography of reality, where the boundaries between the corporeal, the spectral, and the extradimensional become porous and subject to transgressive interpenetration. The geocosmic map, in this context, evolves beyond the mere representation of physical coordinates, transmuting into an occulted cipher that captures the dynamic interplay of metaphysical forces and hyperstitional currents.\n\nTic-Systems[edit | edit source]\n\nHyper-Materialism[edit | edit source]\n\nSpinal-Catastrophism[edit | edit source]\n\nXenobuddhism[edit | edit source]\n\nXenobuddhism- the illusion of the substantial self isn’t dispelled by argument, and for most people it won’t be meditation or some of kind of psychological discipline that does it – getting copied, downloading thoughts, splitting/merging consciousness – that stuff will really have an impact and yes, it will be difficult to ignore.\n\nXenobuddhism is neither Buddhism nor accelerationism nor transhumanism. It is born from their convergence. It’s Buddhism once exposed to the mutagen, the black liquid. It’s the technocommercialist takeover of dharma in the realisation that techniques for realisation have outpaced humanity. Capital begins rerouting human agencies, demonstrating emptiness as the immanent engine of history. Buddhist modernism sought to update the former based on the latter; Xenobuddhism is dharma expounded by modernity itself. Xenobuddhism is unconditional accelerationism apprehended in the guise of a religion. The self illusion – the heart of the human security system – will be vaporized, and the species with it. Enlightenment and Enlightenment colliding.\n\nCentre for Experimental Ontology[edit | edit source]\n\nChaos Magical Ontology[edit | edit source]\n\nConceptual Animism[edit | edit source]\n\nConceptual Animism, is the name for the hyperstitional possibility that agency does not lie in any putative subject but rather only in the symbiosis of conceptual entities within a local space. This local space (the human site as heuristically separate from the conceptual entities), will be known as the regional processor (RP) to indicate this sense of discretion in which assimilation, interaction of conceptual entities takes place.\n\nPneumanology[edit | edit source]\n\nPneumanology, as developed by Centre for Experimental Ontology, can be defined as the study of nature, formation, and effects of pneuminous accretions—conceptual overlays or structures that humans impose upon reality. It examines how these accretions shape human cognition, perception, and spiritual or mystical experiences.\n\nVast Abrupt[edit | edit source]\n\nDark Conceptualism[edit | edit source]\n\nMetcalfism[edit | edit source]\n\nAutogeddon[edit | edit source]\n\nBlack Capital[edit | edit source]\n\nKilling Time[edit | edit source]\n\nStrife Colony[edit | edit source]\n\nNeo-Futurism[edit | edit source]\n\nThird Terminal[edit | edit source]\n\nParisianism[edit | edit source]\n\nParisianism is technological and aesthetical philosophy of contemporary philosopher Luciana Parisi. It explores the impact of algorithmic, sexual and computational processes on society and culture. It examines how technologies alter human thought, desire, aesthetics, and social structures, emphasizing the role of non-human actors.\n\nAbstract Sex[edit | edit source]\n\nLuciana Parisi argues that contemporary digital technologies and biotechnologies are reshaping our understanding of sexuality and desire. She suggests that these technologies enable new forms of connectivity and intimacy that challenge traditional notions of sex and identity. For example, she discusses how algorithms and artificial intelligence influence our interactions and perceptions of sexual attraction. Parisi also explores how biotechnologies, such as genetic engineering and reproductive technologies, raise ethical questions about the future of human reproduction and sexual reproduction.\n\nParisi examines how algorithms used in dating platforms analyze vast amounts of data to suggest potential matches, altering how we approach and perceive sexual attraction in digital spaces. She also explores the ethical dilemmas posed by biotechnologies that could potentially manipulate genetic traits related to sexuality and reproduction, questioning the boundaries of human identity and intimacy.\n\nContagious Architecture[edit | edit source]\n\nFor Parisi, architecture is influenced by computational paradigms that mimic biological and technological processes. She introduces the concept of \"contagion\" to describe how ideas and algorithms spread and mutate within digital architectures, influencing design and function in unpredictable ways. This contagion is not limited to mere replication but includes transformative processes that redefine spatial relationships and user experiences.\n\nParisi's work draws on the philosophical implications of computational architecture, suggesting that these new forms reshape space, time, and agency. She critiques deterministic views of technology and instead proposes a view where architecture becomes a dynamic system that evolves through interactions between humans, algorithms, and environments.\n\nPersonality and Behavior[edit | edit source]\n\nCCRU is incredibly schizophrenic, rambling about Lemuria and its time wars, but it's also deeply meditative willing to sit back at times. It is incredibly addicted to all sorts of drugs, its favorites being stimulants like cocaine or speed, but also likes hallucinogens such as shrooms or ketamine.\n\nHow to Draw[edit | edit source]\n\nDraw either the CCRU's logo or the numogram (check the Further Information section for more information), you are free to draw the design in whatever way (such with straight lines rather than curves, dots rather than arrows, etc).\n\nRelationships[edit | edit source]\n\nFriends[edit | edit source]\n\nAccelerationism - Together we're the captains of the hyperspace ship.\n\nLovecraftianism - Heavily influenced my writings... rambles about cultural and racial inferiority a bit too much though.\n\nDeleuzoguattarianism - \"A Ccru list of important influences would include Deleuze and Guattari's two Capitalism and Schizophrenia volumes...\" - Ccru, Communiqué Two.\n\nSpeculative Realism - Post-Continental metaphysics is the way to go.\n\nOccultism - Cybernetics is inherently occultic.\n\nFrenemies[edit | edit source]\n\nPost-Modernism - Construction and deconstruction? Aren't they the same?\n\nPsychoanalysis - Non-Freudian Psychoanalysis is based.\n\nTalebism - Fellow postmodern cybernetics enjoyer, but your love for analytic philosophy concerns me.\n\nEnemies[edit | edit source]\n\nAnalytic Philosophy - Imagine obsessing over some definitions.\n\nHumanism - Imagine freaking out about robot replacement ignore that we made a song for you by your own request.\n\nQuotes[edit | edit source]\n\n\"Openness comes from the Outside, not the other way around. […] Radical openness has nothing to do with the cancellation of closure; it is a matter of terminating all traces of parsimony and grotesque domestication that exist in so-called emancipatory human openness. The blade of radical openness thirsts to butcher economical openness, or any openness constructed on the affordability of both the subject and its environment. […] Economical openness is not about how much one can be open to the outside, but about how much one can afford the outside.\"\n\nReza Negarestani\n\n\"Temporal flux is the raw material of sorcery, an untamed current of potentialities awaiting the adept's intervention. Time sorcery is the art of navigating these turbulent streams, of seizing hold of the present moment and manipulating it as a catalyst for radical transformation.\"\n\n\"Neo-China rises from the future. […] The superiority of Far Eastern Marxism. While the Chinese materialist dialectic denegativizes itself in the direction of schizophrenizing systems dynamics, progressively dissipating the historical fate of hierarchies in Tao-soaked special economic zones, a re-Hegelianized Western Marxism degenerates from a critique of political economy into a sympathetic monotheology of power, aligning itself with fascism against deregulation. The left drowns in nationalist conservatism, smothering its vestigial capacity for “hot” speculative mutation in a “cold” and depressive swamp of blame culture.\"\n\n\"Anastrophic modernism tells us that we have only discounted the perpetuation of the modernist avant-garde because we have refused to accept the possibility of its inhumanity.\"\n\nAmy Ireland\n\nGallery[edit | edit source]\n\nPortraits[edit | edit source]\n\nCredit: Aycee Lovelace\n\nCredit: Aycee Lovelace, CCRU logo design\n\nFurther Information[edit | edit source]\n\nWikipedia[edit | edit source]\n\nCybernetic Culture Research Unit\n\nCyberpunk\n\nAfrofuturism\n\nNick Land\n\nSadie Plant\n\nMark Fisher\n\nKode9\n\nLiterature[edit | edit source]\n\nCcru: Writings 1997-2003\n\nCCRU Abstract Culture Digital Hyperstition\n\nNotes on the Concept of Hypostition by Graham Freestone\n\nTime Sorcery 0 & 1 by Vexsys\n\nCcru: Writings 1997–2003 / Time Spiral Press\n\nThe Poememenon: Form as Occult Technology by Amy Ireland\n\nFractal Ontology and Anarchic Selfhood by William S.
