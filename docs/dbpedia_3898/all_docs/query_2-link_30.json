        "text": "What is the human body? Both the most familiar and unfamiliar of things, the body is the centre of experience but also the site of a prehistory anterior to any experience. Alien and uncanny, this other side of the body has all too often been overlooked by phenomenology. In confronting this oversight, Dylan Trigg’s The Thing redefines phenomenology as a species of realism, which he terms unhuman phenomenology. Far from being the vehicle of a human voice, this unhuman phenomenology gives expression to the alien materiality at the limit of experience. By fusing the philosophies of Merleau-Ponty, Husserl, and Levinas with the horrors of John Carpenter, David Cronenberg, and H.P. Lovecraft, Trigg explores the ways in which an unhuman phenomenology positions the body out of time. At once a challenge to traditional notions of phenomenology, The Thing is also a timely rejoinder to contemporary philosophies of realism. The result is nothing less than a rebirth of phenomenology as redefined through the lens of horror. *** Dylan Trigg's The Thing is a sophisticated melding of philosophy, literary criticism, and film criticism that underscores his major thesis that 'the horror of the cosmos is essentially the horror of the body.' Its discussions of the fiction of H. P. Lovecraft, the films of John Carpenter and David Cronenberg, and other texts and films allow us to look at these works from a fascinating new perspective while shedding light on humanity's fragility in a boundless cosmos. ~ S. T. Joshi Dylan Trigg's The Thing: A Phenomenology of Horror takes up the central challenge of contemporary philosophy - grappling with the world as indifferent to human constructs and concepts. Trigg's analysis suggests to us that phenomenology - too often regarded as a philosophy of the human par excellence - is uncannily suited to thinking the world-without-us. Husserl writing horror fiction is the spirit of this study. ~ Eugene Thacker, author of In The Dust Of This Planet\n\nEmmanuel Levinas is often thought of as a philosopher of ethics, above all else. Indeed, his notions of the face, the Other, and alterity have all earned him a distinguished place in the history of phenomenology as a fundamental thinker of ethics as a first philosophy. But what has been overlooked in this attention on ethics is the early work of Levinas, which reveals him less a philosopher of the Other and more as a philosopher of elemental and anonymous being, a speculative metaphysician whose ethical voice was still in the process of forming. In this paper, I explore the early Levinas, specifically with an aim of assessing what he can tell us about phenomenology in its relation to the non-human world. I make two claims. One, Levinas’s idea of the “il y a” (the there is) offers us a novel way of rethinking the relation between the body and the world. This idea can be approached by phrasing Levinas as a materialist. Two, the experience of horror, which Levinas will place great onus on, provides us with a phenomenology at the threshold of experience. As I argue, it is precisely through what Levinas terms “the horror of the night,” that phenomenology begins to exceed its methodological constraints in accounting for a plane of elemental existence beyond experience.\n\nBetween literature (fiction) and testimony, the narratives that attempt to voice and bear witness to the catastrophe dwell, in Jacques Derrida's terms, on an ​ impossible limit​. Bearing witness is thus haunted by two apparently opposed, yet interrelated, unstable functions: on the one hand it is continuously undone by the impossibility to tell its story, to find a language that can comprise and render the catastrophe, on the other hand, bearing witness means to embark on the quest of this possibility of a language that could confess to that which is impossible to grasp entirely. Considering posthumanism in its ​ impossibility to tell its own story and in its quest for a language that would make it possible​ , our paper investigates the possibility of bearing witness to the unrepresentable. We will revisit the polemic around the images of the Shoah as we will delve into how one can deal with the language that bears witness to the events of a past that is out of reach. We will reconsider the dispute between Georges Didi-Huberman and Claude Lanzmann around the four photographs rescued from Auschwitz as we analyze László Nemes' film ​ Son of Saul-which Didi-Huberman calls a ​ necessary monster-and other documentary films exploring the possibility of speaking about the catastrophe (Harun Farocki, Rithy Panh, Patricio Guzmán). We will thus observe why and when we can speak of an ethical way to use the images of the Holocaust and why art can and should employ the impossibility of language to imagine the unimaginable in spite of all.\n\nThis introduction is a promise to tell of this special issue's origins and to speak of the hopes of this body of work. Even while we make this promise we know we will fail. Yet we see this failure, this gap between the promise and what remains, as precisely what the monster offers to our thinking. That is, the monster highlights the supposed divisions between the acceptable and conventional and their assumed opposites, drawing attention to the production of knowledge, including how knowledge comes to be embodied. While striving for coherence across our collective voices, so that the text may be readable for others, we want to underscore how collectives are easily rendered invisible, almost as if we are one, even while we are at least five editors of this special issue. Indeed, monstrous analyses aim to bring forth what may often be ignored, particularly the more than one in the one, the way the human is inhabited by, and made possible through, other beings on whom/which it is dependent for ongoing liveliness. In this timely Frankenstein text, we seek to make visible the patchworks and the sutures between our thinking, experiences, passions and embodied knowledges. In practice, we want to show that academic productions are labour, and in so doing we aim to use our disparate and converging voices to capture this labour, showing how ideas may start with one person but are always more than that person, in origins and what remains here. We therefore italicise when a specific idea comes from one of the editors, acknowledging their labour, while also showing\n\nMargrit Shildrick has argued that the monster's ability to disturb and unsettle arises from its position as simultaneously same and different, both self and other at the same time. Through an analysis of Algernon Blackwood's novella The Willows, this article discusses the challenge posed by by the nonhuman Absolute other, the nebulous creatures whose whose difference is total, as they appear in weird fiction. Drawing on posthuman theory, it explores the ethical implications of imagining the crumbling horizons of human subjectivity in the meeting with the absolute and unknowable other. This article argues that by bringing concepts such as the horror of scale, eco-phobia, the transformative power of awe, and the strangeness of matter into the monstrous figure , the weird undermines the structures that constructs human, culture, and mind as separate and different from the non-human, nature, and matter. By making us imagine a perspective from which humans are not just insignificant, but irrelevant, weird fiction not only challenges the anthropocentric worldview, but also makes us aware of the limitations and situatedness of human experience. Marianne Gunderson is a master student in Gender Studies at University of Oslo.\n\nThis paper explores three transgressive models of subjectivity. The first emerges out of a psychoanalytic examination of the matrix, a regressive technology of wish-fulfilling omnipotence which is central to the world of William Gibson’s cyberpunk classic, Neuromancer. The second subjectivity is expressed through the reactionary credo of self-sacrifice developed by Georges Bataille’s secret society of Acéphale – headless. The third subjectivity calls to us from the dehumanizing gods that populate the weird fiction of H.P. Lovecraft. Each of these transgressions share a common element. They depict a method or practice that seeks to dominate the rational, human subject by way of turning it into the raw material of cultural production. For this purpose, technology (Gibson), religion (Bataille), and ontological systems of knowledge (Lovecraft) are twisted into their antitheses. Each transgressive model of subjectivity implements a tool of enlightenment in order to subjugate and regressively re-orient the course of reason, elucidating the dark inhumanity which is tangled around the deepest roots of the human subject. These transgressions, and their resultant power to transform the human into something wholly other, something inhuman, are the precise points at which the rational subject of the Enlightenment “abrogates itself,” to quote Adorno and Horkheimer, revealing its ever-present potential for reversion back to a repressive, mythic, and irrational antithesis."
