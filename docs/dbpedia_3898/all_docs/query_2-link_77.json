        "text": "Fernando Zalamea – Transmodernism\n\nFernando Zalamea proposes a project which weaves together strands of the modern and postmodern, the rational and the romantic into a synthetic universality, endlessly revisable and updatable. He nominates “Transmodernity” as the term which encompasses our unfolding epoch. Underpinned by his training in mathematics and logic, Zalamea draws upon a wide cosmopolitan tradition, harnessing the creative power of what he calls “real” mathematics to transit disparate domains of culture and the arts in a relentless synechism."
