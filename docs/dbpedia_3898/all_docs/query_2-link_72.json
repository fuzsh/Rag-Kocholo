        "text": "The Watchful Ear (Richard Pinnell)\n\nMonday 4th April\n\n4 April 2011 No Comment\n\nLONG+WRONG\n\n“the mutual incompatibility, real or apparent, of two laws.”\n\nSome words about Mattin’s new LP, ‘Object of thought’. Neil Simpson\n\nYou can listen to an extract here.\n\n“The investment in the ‘I’ is very difficult to sustain, in part because it constitutes a kind of shifting signifier. Whenever I see the word I in an autobiography I almost think that the book is actually telling us how the book itself came into existence not about the life of the author who wrote it.” Christian Bök – http://poetrycenter.arizona.edu/conceptualpoetry/bok.shtml#audio\n\nAs a result of attending his performance at Instal late last year, I recently sent Mattin an email recently to ask how I could go about obtaining a copy of his new LP, ‘Object of Thought’. I couldn’t find a UK distributor and he kindly pointed me in the right direction. He also asked me if I would be happy to let him know what I thought of the LP. I agreed and asked if he would write a response to my thoughts so that I could include both on Long+Wrong. I’m delighted to say that he also agreed. Little did I know how difficult I would find it to write about.\n\nThe main source of this difficulty is the effort that Mattin has already put in to providing a critical framework for the sounds on the record. The sleeve contains three short, but dense, texts in which he provides some justifications, explanations and details about how and why he made the record. These texts are complicated and, at times, refer to philosophical ideas with which I’m not familiar (e.g. “Thus understood as cause in-the-last-instance of thought, radical performativity completes dismantling it [sic] antinomic pairing with the “constantive” function of language”)\n\nHow then do I go about writing about this record? Do I ignore the texts and focus on the sound making process and its results? Given the effort that has gone into the texts, their prominence on the sleeve, and their apparent close relation to the way in which the sounds on the record were made, this seems inadequate. Do I try to engage with ideas that I’m not in a position to be able to fully understand, never mind critique? I can’t see the value in this either. Who needs to read some inadequate analysis?\n\nSo what do I do? How do I write about something that I don’t feel capable of writing about? Why do I need to feel capable? Why can’t I just write an accept what I write? I guess my idea of myself and the image that I am hoping to portray via this blog will not allow it. Has Mattin written these texts in the hope that , ok no more editing from now on, no more revisions, just what comes into my mind. Has mattin written these texts in the hope that people who buy the record will understand them? or has he written them knowing that almost everyone who encounters it will struggle with them? Is he trying to make me feel inadequate? I am I doing that to myself? Should I even be thinking about writing about this record, after all, it’s difficult to think of it as entertainment, or as something that is intended to be aesthetically enjoyable. It’s difficult in many ways. The sounds are difficult to listen to. There are many hard edits, harsh sounds, distorted words. The words make it difficult to listen to the noises and the noises make it difficult to listen to the words. The text is difficult to understand and the way it is laid out is difficult to read. Is that noise? Is it all an array of deliberate disruptions that’s intended to frustrate at every turn?\n\nWhy did I even think that I could write about it? I knew that Mattin’s work is very philosophical and conceptual. Am I trying to prove something? What have I proved? That, in this case, I’ve been too ambitious? I guess this has moved from ambitious to indulgent. Why do I think I have anything to say about music? Is this entertainment? Are you reading this at work, on the bus, passing the time while you wait for something else to happen? Is this what Mattin had in mind when he made the record? That his attempt to use recordings of himself speaking aloud without a script, which he would subsequently cut, edit, distort, fragment and layer, would result in what appears to be a rather selfish rant about my own thoughts about what I’m doing?\n\nI guess ultimately, what I’m trying to do here, is the same thing that I think Mattin has indicated he’s trying to do on the record. To find some way of figuring out what constraints are operating when we act, think and feel. These constraints are not obvious, chances are they are subliminal or subconscious or just so familiar that we don’t even notice them any more. How much of my sense of self is learned? How much control over it do I have? How can I see past who I think I am?\n\nHow do I even know what questions to ask when I’m questioning the I that asks the questions?\n\nVital Weekly 767\n\nArt as sound can engage thought in a struggle for survival of the human species, the impact of this in Mattins’s work -here- processed soliloquies, is becoming yet more transparent. The materialism of thought and its relationship to capitalism is a response to something even more profound. Capitalism is a system, whether contingent or not and one even in the historicy of Marxism began with and is situated in agriculture. Agri culture here as agri, the beginning of culture and so a certain cultivation of the idea, its settling in a fixed point in both space and time, its finity, its fixation, psychosis, and its objectification of truth… objectification of thought, objectification of sound… philosophy with is cultured thought is always at war with the nomadicism of life, or the real, just as music is a violence against noise, (non music) which here both the seeming nomadicity of thought, (only an hallucination!) as speech, is in confrontation with the real. Both protagonists, the farmer and the nomad can be as simplistic as the farmer and the cowman, such as the objectification of capitalism for Mattin, the object of thought deals with some difficult problematics, improvisation, and capitalization, the manipulation of thought, its attempt at the radical real and its comodification in the work ethic, one which is governed by synthetic time, material – mechanical time and not the real radical time. The non-time of improvisation is replaced by the abstract time of thought, of history and of course both the western dialectics and the wild west’s de nomadification as successive waves of colonization of a land still called free, or of the free. The image of thought is attacked by the “Red”-Indians! i.e. Capitalism is attacked by the nomad. This recording is of thoughts which like the well known wagon train is forced on a circular defense of the radical real. All ideas revolve defensibility against the nomad, and as this record revolves, in speed and time,\n\nof mechanical time its very physicality, its analoguality allows nomadic infringements. This is not so much an object, but a scene from the war of the farmer against the nomad, the next skirmish after territorialization in the end of both music and philosophy. (jliat)\n\nParis Transatlantic ( September 2011)\n\nMattin, as anyone who's been following his career will know already, always makes sure that whatever he releases is also available for free download, and indeed that's how I've managed to get hold of this one while I wait to get my paws on the real thing, which is a gorgeous object in its own right. As he made abundantly clear in his PT interview last year, Mattin these days seems to be more interested in the ideas behind music – its social, political and philosophical implications – than he is in what it actually sounds like. That's a shame if, like me, you're a boring old fart who still believes in old-fashioned notions of musical form and content, and music's power to move the listener in ways s/he can't explain (bourgeois mystification? you betcha), but it hasn't stopped me from listening carefully to, and usually enjoying, any Mattin offering that comes my way.\n\nThe principal sound source for the 30-minute Object of Thought is Mattin himself, holding forth on as is his wont on the subjects dear to his heart: language, noise and improvisation itself, though he rarely gets to the end of a sentence before being interrupted by another layer of text (sometimes whispered, sometimes filtered or treated almost beyond recognition) or a blast of noise, presumably from his trademark computer feedback. As such it has much in common sonically with 2009's monumental six-hour Feedback Conceptual. It's clear that a lot of work has gone into this (one wonders if he sketched out the mixing process in advance and kept a copy of his notes – presumably not, as that would make it a composition, but I'm curious), and the result is probably the most attractive and – he might hate me for saying this – musical Mattin release of the past half dozen years.\n\nThough that certainly matters to me, I wonder if that matters to him. If the raison d'être of this disc is simply to get the listener to call into question his/her assumptions about music, I would say his 2007 release with Taku Unami, Attention, did the job much better, irritating beyond belief though I found it. But apparently, judging from one of the reviews I've read recently, it's not even about music anymore but something called non-music, Mattin's latest intellectual punching ball / punch bowl, in homage presumably to François Laruelle's concept of non-philosophy. Now, having spent at least 40 of my 48 years trying to figure out what is or isn't music, I seriously doubt I'll be able to get my head around the concept of non-music before I die, but I dare say I'll return to this album from time to time and find much to enjoy. That'll be my guilty, boorish pleasure.–DW\n\nThe Sound Projector (UK, September 2011)\n\nCyclic Defrost\n\nAn Australian magazine focusing on interesting musicMattin – Objects of Thought (Presto Records)\n\nThe notes on this album are a quite something, it reads as a primer to postmodern theory with a specific Hegelian/Marxist bent. It contains such gems as “Noise is the spectacle eating itself in an act of self-cannibalism” and “the theorist says: I am a moral bomb of incomparable power”. It is particularly caught up with the commodification of intellect, the problem of making material thought, the documentation of subjectivity and taking subjectivity to a self-reflexive point of feedback. It contains the general ramblings, cutups and reflections, intermixed with distortion static, tonal frequencies, plays on close microphone experimentation and many other effects.\n\nIt has that general anti-music feel of those who are trying to subvert music from being a form of cultural consumption, and to being a fast track to consciousness by shoving a spike of noise into their ear. But it is a particular type of social conscious, a specific political economic ideology that it seeks for you to buy into, which is the rub, it cannot escape its own ideology. The music encapsulates a form of ideological content that is generally within the genre of Marxist thought and seeks to subvert the capitalist commodification of the self. I still find it quite amusing and the undergraduate in me is rushing to buy copies of this anti-music product.\n\nThe Wire (March 2011, London)\n\nOuter Limits section, by Nick Cain\n\nJust Outside (Brian Olewnick, New Jersey, November 2011)\n\nWhen I opened the package in which these LPs arrived, the knife I used left an incision directly across the black circle that occupies most of the back cover of this release. Seemed appropriate, somehow.\n\nI find this one a good bit more interesting, ultimately, than the Exquisite Corpse album, largely due to its fine juxtaposition of the abstract and concrete, the latter consisting of the spoken words of Mattin, recording his thoughts on (I take it) a range of subjects, which he then distorts, cuts and otherwise manhandles, removing any real vestige of meaning with the exception, possibly, of tone of voice. In this sense, one recalls Lucier's \"I Am Sitting in a Room\", though the end result falls in territory adjacent to Ashley's \"Automatic Writing\". Not to make a qualitative comparison, just an elemental one.\n\nSide A is quiet, Side B, less so. Sometimes the words are intelligible, more often not, slowed to an indistinct mumble. Electronics interfere like a mal-tuned analog radio. Sonically, it works quite well, balanced, slithery, interruptive. That's part of the irony, I suppose, that one is unable *not* to listen (at least, that's the case with me) without making assessments that are more aesthetic than political. One can expand upon the attempted portrayal (and understanding) of ideas made impossible by the corporate chaos around us, though that's not a particularly deep thought, both obvious and subvertable. So one listens to it as sound, contravening what I imagine Mattin's preference would be. And it works quite well, though my favorite aspect might still be the knife cut I made in the sleeve."
