        "text": "Tag: Nick Land\n\nTheory Fiction, Mad Black Deleuzeanism and the Posthuman Void\n\nOver at the OU I was moderating an MA forum on styles of philosophy, so decided to go for broke with a post on ‘Theory Fiction, Mad Black Deleuzeanism and the Posthuman Void’. God knows what my poor students will make of it, but sometimes you just have to go for it I guess: [[ […]\n\nMemories of the Body\n\nAesthetically, this sequence recalls an avant-garde cinema where speech floats; freed from an expository role. One thinks of the literary allusions in Jean-Luc Godard’s Alphaville (Kasdan 1976) or perhaps Chris Marker’s La Jetée: still images linked by a reflective narration.

Well worth a read.\n\nLand on Democratic Transhumanism\n\nNice to know that Nick Land is still a prickly histamine to questionable Liberal-Transhumanist Eschatology and still re-tooling Neuromancer to great effect. That’s Shanghai!"
