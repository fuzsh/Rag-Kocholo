The key figure in these discussions has been the British philosopher Nick Land. The term âaccelerationism,â itself coined by Benjamin Noys (in a characteristically critical register), bares some explanation. As Noys defines it, accelerationism describes certain libertarian post-Marxist positions (Deleuze and GuattariâsÂ Anti-Oedipus,Â LyotardâsÂ Libidinal Economy, and the Baudrillard of the mid-1970s). According to Noys,\n\n[Such thinkers] reply to Marxâs contention that âthe real barrier of capitalist production is capital itself,â by arguing that we must crash through this barrier by turning capitalism against itself. They are an exotic variant ofÂ la politique du pire: if capitalism generates its own forces of dissolution then the necessity is to radicalise capitalism itself: the worse the better. We can call this tendencyÂ accelerationism.\n\nIt is Land who exemplified, and indeed exacerbated, this strategy of âthe worse the betterâ to new heights of sick perversity in the 1990s. But what is of interest to us is not so much questions of conceptual genealogy but the resurgence of the idea: What is accelerationism today?\n\nAt present we find a swarm of new ideas operating under this rubric, ranging from post-capitalist techno-political theory, to sci-fi speculative cosmist design, to universal rationalist epistemologies. It is to be suggested that this return to ideas of acceleration must be indexed to our present condition of political, economic, and culturalÂ decay. And though Landâs own ideas ofÂ whatÂ is to be accelerated, and in what accelerationÂ consists, have been superseded, such references, now existing at multiple levels (epistemic, ontological, political, cosmological) might now come to be marshaled more directly against the spectre of a greying, obese, and yet still hegemonically rictus-tight neoliberal order.\n\nIn this, the role of the aesthetic must similarly shift. For whereas in Landâs schema of acceleration the aesthetic is both omnipresent and yet denied autonomy, in this newly imagined envisioning of the idea, the aesthetic may come to take on a more independent and causally significant role.\n\nThe Heresies of Nick Land\n\nNick Land was amongst the most prescient thinkers of the capitalism emerging in the mid-1990s. His work combined the cybernetics of Norbert Weiner with emerging Deleuzo-Guattarian libidinal philosophy, complexity science, UK rave culture, and cyberpunk pulp fiction, to generate a kind of pitch-black psychedelic reductio ad absurdum of neoliberal ideology. Key to Landâs thinking was an idea he drew from Deleuze and GuattariâsÂ Capitalism and SchizophreniaÂ project: capitalism differs from prior social formations in that it operates through processes of deterritorialization, which work to liberate inhibited dynamics of creativity, previously carefully imprisoned in primitive or despotic taboos. Land hijacked this schematization, bringing out an implicit inhuman pro-capitalism. Deleuze and Guattari asked:\n\nWhich is the revolutionary path? â¦ To withdraw from the world market? â¦ Or might it be to go in the opposite direction? To go still further, that is, in the movement of the market? â¦ Not to withdraw from the process, but to go further, to âaccelerate the process.â\n\nTo this question, Land answered in the affirmative. Where Deleuze and Guattari ultimately counseled caution, to accelerate with care to avoid total destruction, Land favored anÂ absoluteÂ process of acceleration and deterritorialization, identifying capitalism as the ultimate agent of history. As Land puts it, âCapitalism has no external limit, it has consumed life and biological intelligence, [and it is] vast beyond human anticipation.âÂ Here, the deregulation, privatization, and commodification of neoliberal capitalism will serve to destroy all stratification within society, generating in the process unheard of novelties. Politics and all morality, particularly of the leftist variety, are a blockage to this fundamental historical process. Land had a hypnotizing belief that capitalistÂ speedÂ alone could generate a global transition towards unparalleled technological singularity. In this visioning of capital, even the human itself can eventually be discarded as mere drag to an abstract planetary intelligence rapidly constructing itself from the bricolaged fragments of former civilizations. As Land has it, through the acceleration of global capitalism the human will be dissolved in a technological apotheosis, effectively experiencing a species-wide suicide as the ultimate stimulant head rush.\n\nAs bizarre as it may sound to the ears of the present day, this brand of thinking made a twisted kind of sense in the 1990s. This was the decade after the collapse of actually existing Communism, when capitalism stood entirely unopposed, when Francis Fukuyama was declaring âThe End of History.â With the expansion of digital culture and the widespread adoption of internet technologies, techno-utopians such as Kevin Kelly were pronouncing the advent of a new social and economic epoch. And while much of culture was already mired in retrograde maneuverings, underground dance music fully embodied the inhuman science-fictional vision of Land, suffused with alien sonic innovations, contorted into an apocalyptic paranoid euphoria. As Land himself put it, this was âimpending human extinction becoming accessible as a dance-floor,â a prime way (along with the production of theory and the ingestion of accelerant narcotics) that the unrepresentable speed of inhuman capitalism could be experienced by individual humans. This was an alienation that wasÂ enjoyable, to be perverselyÂ desired.\n\nAcceleration > Speed\n\nBut if Landâs rabidly nihilistic vision of global capitalist acceleration made sense in the fervid 1990s, it makes less sense today. One reason for this is that Landâs accelerationist schema rejects politics as a sentimental excrescence, as a matter simply of buttressing the incontinent egos of wet liberals and feeble Marxists. On Landâs account, at least, the raw accelerative force of capitalistic innovation alone ought to be sufficient to drive revolutionary change. But as Deleuze and Guattari recognized, what capitalist speed deterritorializes with one hand, it reterritorializes with the other. Social modernization becomes caked in the kitsch remainders of our communal past, as Thatcherite-Reaganite deregulation sits comfortably beside pseudo-Victorian family and religious values. A deep tension exists within neoliberal capitalism, between its self-image as the singular vehicle of modernity, and the somewhat paltry reality it is in fact capable of providing. Far from dissolving the social in the universal acid of hyper-technological acceleration, today the best we can hope for is marginally improved consumer gadgetry, against a background of political inertia, cultural hyperstasis, ecological collapse, and a growing resource crisis. Technological progress, rather than erasing the personal, has become almost entirely Oedipalized, ever more focused on supporting the liberal individual subject. The very agent which Land identified as the engine of untold innovation has run dry. This is alienation of an all-too familiar, ennui-inducing kind, rather than a coldly thrilling succession of future-shocks. All of this opens up a space for the political again: if weÂ desireÂ a radically innovative social formation, capital alone willÂ notÂ deliver.\n\nMoreover, from a philosophical perspective, Landian accelerationism flattens real distinctions in the world into a crudely univocal system. The key consequences of this is an inability to demarcate the differences between thinking and being, reducing the rational to the ontological. In this regard, Land follows Deleuze and numerous other process philosophers. As Ray Brassier has argued, this leads to a scenario where, since difference is what ultimately undergirds the reality of being, and thought is merely a difference in being, everything whichÂ is, to some extent,Â thinks. In this fashion, a pre-critical panpsychism emerges, unable to properly account for the status of logical or normative rational thought.Â With Land, this problematic antirationalism finally results in an elision not just of thinking and being, but of the ontological and the aesthetic.Â Even theory itself becomes a mere stimulant, outside of any reference to external truth, capable only of inculcating an affective state that enables limited access for individual subjects to the ultra-complex becoming of capital-as-world-devouring-intelligence-system. This process leaves Landâs theory unmoored and incapable of justifying itself, except perhaps via a Nietzschean investment in the âforceâ of literary style, the libidinal pull of text itself.\n\nAt the level of the mechanics of acceleration, Reza Negarestani has prosecuted the critique that the Landian position, grounded in a conception of machinic efficacy, is constitutively unable to generate the kind of apocalyptic teleological dynamics he envisions.Â Landâs singularitarian future depends upon an underlying system of capitalistic self-augmentation, ultimately resting on an algorithmic paradigm of recursive computation. Following the critique of the philosopher of science Giuseppe Longo, all computational systems function according to an operative architecture which is discrete, built from individual instructions, akin to the stages of a recipe, and this discrete, finitized conception of time is distinctly inadequate to match the continuous processes we find in nature.Â As well as discrete processes, computational systems also exhibit a crude quantization in terms of measurement. When computers are used to model complex natural systems (for example, human neurology or weather systems) subtle differences in starting conditions get simplified, occluded in a âblockyâ or âpixelatedâ rounding off. In complex systems, nonlinear feedback processes lead even infinitesimally small differences in initial conditions to generate vastly divergent results over time. The continuous nature of reality escapes the quantized grasp of our present computational paradigm, and that paradigm rests at the core of Landâs machinery of acceleration: a unidirectional accumulative process of algorithmic amplification.\n\nOne final line of problematization for the Landian program of accelerationism concerns its presumptions relating to the meaning of freedom. In common with much liberal and neoliberal thought, Land conceives of a primary freedom which various forms of structure inhibit. Though distinguished by his rigorous inhumanism (vis-Ã -vis, say, a classical liberal like Locke) he maintains an interest in a merely negative freedom: the freedom of capital from deleterious (and misguided) human intervention. This is, however, to entirely ignore the richer and more suggestive domain of positive freedom. It is in this sense that Land confusesÂ speedÂ withÂ acceleration. We may be moving fast today, but only within a strictly defined set of capitalist parameters that themselves never waver. As such, Landian accelerationism is stuck in a merely dromological register, a localized ramping up of intensity, rather than a more properly accelerative regime capable of navigatingÂ beyondÂ the ultimately mind-numbing capitalist axiomatic of accumulation-for-accumulationâs sake.Â These critiques of the Landian position collectively constitute the basis for a reformatted, updated, and thoroughly upgraded notion of what accelerationism might mean.\n\nFor A New Enlightenment\n\nTo begin with the last and most significant of these criticisms, what must bind together otherwise divergent new accelerationist approaches is an overriding project ofÂ freedom.Â In this respect, accelerationism today has moved closer to a classically Kantian perspective: freedom consisting in the following of (rational-normative)Â rules, so as to free ourselves from the impulsions ofÂ drive. This is what Brassier describes as a âcultural achievement,â the erection of anÂ artificialÂ order of rational, rule-governed imperatives enabling an evasion of ever more modulated and manipulated impulses. In contradistinction to libertarian and purely negative conceptions of freedom, the tyranny of drive, impulse, emotion, and affectivity can be supplanted only to the extent that such libidinal phenomena are held in check by the formalized workings of reason, a non-natural, synthetic edifice, a positive construction developed in the face of a universe which would otherwise leave us the slaves of baser instinct. What distinguishes this position from a mere regurgitation of familiar Enlightenment tropes is a maximal yet rigorously inhuman Prometheanism. It is this inhumanized Promethean account of freedom which threads together the disparate fabrics of epistemic, political, and cosmist accelerationism. As epistemic accelerationism engenders new modes of thinking and new bodies of knowledge, so political accelerationism generates new social and economic systems to embody, express, and capitalize upon these rationalist gains. Our epistemic and causal capacities are expanded in tandem, in the fashion of a ratchet.\n\nThe twin thinkers of epistemic accelerationism are Ray Brassier and Reza Negarestani. Accelerationism in this guise is the project of maximizing rational capacityâthe contents of knowledge about the worldâand enabling the ramification of the conceptual space of reason. For both Brassier and Negarestani, this process is one which proceeds viaÂ alienation. For Brassier, this is due to a direct identification of the processes of scientific discovery with nihilism. Enlightenment, rather than entailing an edifying reassurance of the humanistic order, instead gradually but irreparably modifies the manifest image of ourselves-in-the-world, stripping back the comforting homilies of humanism to reveal, Terminator-style, the gleaming bones of Wilfrid Sellarsâs empty, formalist, rational subject lying beneath.\n\nFor Negarestani, epistemic acceleration rests in generating new ways to navigate conceptually. This spatialized, geometric understanding of conceptual behavior emphasizes the creative aspects of thought, focusing on conceptual discovery and abductive transition, over and above analytic parsimony. This modern system of knowledge, much inspired by recent work in the synthetic philosophy of mathematics,Â is driven by opportunities to build connections, bootstrapping out of local horizons of knowledge and tracing the pathways which exist towards more globalized conceptual horizons. In this sense, Negarestaniâs project is one which argues for a âtrue to the universeâ thought, which binds the traumatic and vertiginous inhuman perspectives that scientific and mathematical thought provide to the rational subject.Â This revolution âfor and by the openâ prioritizes neither the global over the localÂ norÂ the local over the global, but rather their imbrication with one another, their potential for perforation, and their possibilities for transplantation or transition. Considered from the perspective of an epistemological account of conceptual space, this is to operate under the rational injunction towardsÂ exploration, albeit of a necessarily traumatic kind. Epistemic acceleration then consists in the expansion and exploration of conceptual capacity, fed by new techno-scientific knowledges, resulting in the continual turning-inside-out of the humanist subject in a perpetual Copernican revolution. In so doing, epistemic accelerationisms preserve the crucial distinctions between thought and being, and hence are capable of undergirding a rationalist picture of the world and its operations.\n\nAs Nick Srnicek has argued, one significant pinion point between epistemic and political acceleration is the potential for the transformation of economics. Here, epistemological gains directly interface with technological, social, and political ones. Srnicek reasons that economic models effectively operate as navigational systems for particular social and ideological infrastructures, and as such we can distinguish between those models which provide orientation and strategic support for the current capitalist system, and those which might provide resources by which we could navigate towards a future post-capitalist society. In this fashion, âthe critique of restricted knowledge therefore parallels the critique of restricted economies.âÂ In other words, new ways of thinking about the economy can have dramatic effects on how actual economies operate. The post-capitalist order which political accelerationism takes as its immediate goal necessarily depends on the ability to transform the discipline of economics and the body of knowledge it supports and instantiates. The transformation of economics can be seen as one important element within a broader process of transition, with the development of new models and cognitive maps of the existing system leading towards the development of a speculative image of the future economic system.\n\nBeyond the economic, political accelerationism seeks to revolutionize the contemporary political Left. Holding that capitalism now constrains the productive forces of technology, directing them towards narrow and often fruitless ends, accelerationism as a political project proposes identifying latent productive forces which must be unleashedÂ againstÂ neoliberalism. Rather than working to smash the current capitalist system, the existing infrastructure is here identified as a platform requiringÂ repurposingÂ towards post-capitalist, collective ends. Technology, from this standpoint, is enslaved to myopic capitalist purposes, with the wager being that the real transformative potentials of much scientific and technical research remain untapped. These pre-adaptations may become decisive, but only sociopolitical action is capable of activating them, meaning that technological change alone will remain entirely insufficient to radically alter our world. What ought to be aimed towards, this tendency suggests, is a sociotechnical hegemony, with the goal of repurposing the present material platforms of finance, production, logistics, and consumption towards post-capitalist ends. What accelerationist politics proposes is that only a future that isÂ more modernâan alternative future that neoliberalism is inherently unable to generateâwill be sufficient to motivate a genuinely transformative and coherent politics.\n\nSuch a future is only going to be possible with significant transformations in the radical Left. The Euro-American Leftâs current obsessions with localism, direct action, and deliberative democracy are ill-matched when confronted with the acephalous monstrosity that is global capital today. What is therefore necessary is the constitution of a Left comfortable with globality, complexity, mediation, quantification, and technology, rather than sentimentalized modes of action and organization more suited to generating an affective sensation of feeling good in pious defeat, rather than efficacious action. The fetishization of localized horizons of direct democracy must be replaced by a more substantive conception of collective self-mastery, wherein the more we are able to harness our knowledge of the social and technical world, the better we will be able to effectively rule ourselves. This Promethean politics of maximal mastery over society and its environment will necessarily be highly experimental in nature. The older forms of mastery more traditionally associated with Enlightenment thinking stressed a Laplacian absolute knowledge, fit for a clockwork Newtonian universe. Today, our knowledge of non-trivial complex systems means that any attempts at mastering our world entail developing a mode of action which is more capable of metabolizing contingency, able to use the technical tools at its disposal to model the range of possible outcomes to any interventions.\n\nFinally, it is only a post-capitalist sociopolitical model which is likely to be capable of launching a robust cosmist imperative. The first two thirds of the twentieth century saw astounding leaps forward in technology and political and social consciousness, with the era immediately after the Second World War (running up to about 1979) the apogee of future-oriented thought in scientific and popular culture. But these futurological visions of the revolutionary intersection of techno-scientific development and social transformation, after the advent of neoliberalism, were quickly replaced by a yearning for kitsch retro-futurism. This is the story of modernism and early postmodernism collapsing into what might be termed a generalized chronosickness: a loss of the thread of techno-social Enlightenment. This is encapsulated especially in the loss of space as âfinal frontier.â Starting in the 1970s, the huge Soviet and American space programs collapsed under the strain of political pressure and budget cuts. The resumption of a serious and ongoing exploration of space is perhaps the ultimate expression of freedom imaginable to present minds, what the design theorist Benedict Singleton refers to as a âmaximum jailbreak.â\n\nAccelerationist Aesthetics\n\nIt is against this backdrop that we can specify what an accelerationistÂ aestheticsÂ might look like: in the processes of epistemic conceptual navigation, in hyperstitional ideological feedback loops, in the design of interfaces of control, and as a blueprint for action in complex systems.\n\nFirst to epistemic aesthetics. The spatialized conception of the navigation and ramification of conceptual spaces at the core of Negarestaniâs notion of epistemic acceleration has an immediately aesthetic dimension, a highly visualized approach, grounded in the mathematics of topos theory. This abstract mathematical aesthetic of gesture, navigation, limitropism, and pathway-finding reroutes the philosophy of mathematics away from a basis in set theory and logic, and instead seeks an ultimatelyÂ geometricÂ ground.\n\nSecondly, as regards political accelerationism, what becomes crucial is the ability of a reconstituted Left to not simply operate inside the hegemonic coordinates of the possible as established by our current socioeconomic setup. To do so requires the ability to direct preexisting and at present inchoate desires for post-capitalism towards coherent visions of the future. Necessarily, given the experimental nature of such a reconstitution, much of the initial labor must be around the composition of powerful visions able to reorient populist desire away from the libidinal dead end which seeks to identify modernity as such with neoliberalism, and modernizing measures as intrinsically synonymous with neoliberalizing ones (for example, privatization, marketization, and outsourcing). This is to invoke the idea, initially coined by Landâs Cybernetic Cultural Research Unit, ofÂ hyperstitionânarratives able to effectuate their own reality through the workings of feedback loops, generating new sociopolitical attractors. This is the aesthetic side of the task of constructing a new sociotechnical hegemony.\n\nThird, we have the idea of an aesthetics of interfaces, control rooms, and cognitive maps.Â Here, an important aspect of rendering reality tractable, and hence furthering the overriding accelerationist project of maximal collective self-mastery, is the ability to marshal and interact effectively with data. In a world increasingly marked by its complexity, vast amounts of data present a problem as much as a solution. The aesthetics of design are therefore important in being able to properly render interfaces which enable agents to interact and manipulate these data fields effectively. One only need think of the kinds of heads-up displays used in contemporary finance for a contemporary and all-too-effective example. Design is also crucial in building control rooms and other physical infrastructures which enable the direction of interventions in complex systems. One prototypical exemplar here is the specially constructed control center for the cybernetic socialist project Cybersyn, in Allendeâs Chile of the early 1970s.Â Both interfaces and control rooms embody the aesthetics of cognitive maps, technically mediated cartographies of the present world acting as a basis from which action can be planned.\n\nFinally, we have the aesthetic of action in complex systems. What must be coupled to complex systems analysis and modeling is a new form of action: improvisatory and capable of executing a design through a practice which works with the contingencies it discovers only in the course of its acting. This can be best described through the Ancient Greek concept ofÂ mÃªtis, a particular mode of cunning craft. Marcel Detienne and Jean-Pierre Vernant defineÂ mÃªtis, in contrast toÂ poesisÂ orÂ techne, as âskill with materials guided by a kind of cunning intelligence.âÂ This is a mode of artifice through devious and well-timed action, which brings into play the dynamic tendencies of the materials it works on in an improvisatory fashion. MÃªtic practice entails a complicity with the material, a cunning guidance of the contingent (and unknowable in advance) latencies discoverable only in the course of action. This dovetails with the epistemological constraints imposed by complex systems. Our models and simulations may give us the ability to map out potential consequences to action, but only through intervention will we discover the precise weight of each feedback loop and process of reinforcement.Â MÃªtisÂ therefore gives us a pathway towards a new form of praxis, a politics of geosocial artistry and cunning rationality.\n\nMaximum Jailbreak by Benedict Singleton\n\nJune 2013\n\nThe greatest escape of them all is about to blow the future apart.\n\nâEscape from New YorkÂ (John Carpenter, 1981), original theatrical movie trailer\n\nSpace travel produced some of the defining images of the twentieth century. Sputnik, Apollo, the spacesuit, the NASA logo and the toy-like outline of the space shuttle, liftoffs with all their countdown drama, and the peaceful image of the earth like a mica fleck against coal black; the weird underwater quality of footage shot in low gravity, a motionless flag on the Moon. These images were capable of captivating a global audience, an effect enhanced by the setup of the so-called Space Race as a kind of decades-long international sports day. But then it seemed to stall. The workaday job of going to low earth orbit carried on, of course, in the uncharismatic shape of comsat maintenance and low-key experiments on the International Space Station, but the kinds of images capable of casting space travel as the definitiveÂ project of our ageÂ in the popular imagination seemed to run out of steam; the last image capable of eliciting fascination was maybe the crumbling arch of smoke hung over Cape Canaveral in the wake of the disappearedÂ Challenger, which understandably nixed enthusiasm for the enterprise as a whole. (Not to mention the onerous investigations into the triangulation of tax dollars to expected gains to acceptable risk that followed it.)\n\nNow, though, it seems that the action just went underground for a while, a brief retreat to regroup and reassess. The military-industrial complex that spawned these images has converted into something better described as a security-entertainment matrix, and grand strategyââa space programââhas been swapped out for diverse tactics. The Mars rover Curiosity attracts droves of followers to its Twitter feed (as of May Day, 2013: 1,338,794), where they can pick up the latest alien landscape pics and chirpy infobites. Billionaire Denis Tito recently announced plan to send a middle-aged couple on a long loverâs jaunt into orbit around Mars, a sitcom premise pitched by an alcoholic screenwriter, eyes gleaming like his last dime. Mars One goes further, beginning open auditions for the one-way reality TV show trip to the planet itâs named after.\n\nShowing slightly less stocking-top to the public eye, companies like Virgin Galactic focus their efforts on courting the insanely wealthy with a voyage-of-a-lifetime space tourist brochure, and Planetary Resources reveal diagrams of robotic asteroid capture mechanisms alongside spreadsheets of kilo-to-dollar launch cost ratios and rare-metal market price projections, scripted for an audience of investors keen to back its plan: a gold rush at the vertical frontier. Launch technologies themselves cheapen further, China and India get in on the space game (kindling predictable resurgence of space defense talk in the countries with a more established foothold), and perhaps strangest of all, enthusiasm for the most technological of projects finds a way to creep into the enemy camp: diehard environmentalists start to opine that if weâre going to perforate these âplanetary boundariesâ as we clearly are (not to mention the threat of asteroids, supervolcanos, and other inestimable contingencies), another planet might be a good hedge of our bets.\n\nA new sense of the proximity of the overhead vastness is the order of the day. All these developments are intriguing ones, backed by pretty robust arguments, and the fact that theyâre not really in competitionâthey all more or less click together like Tetris blocksâstrengthens the case of any and all considerably. But the motivations behind all these admittedly variegated projects arenât things we didnât hear in the last century: space for profit, the advance of science, entertainment dollars, national pride, collective defense, and so on. Itâs an open question whether we can conceive of some genuinely new ideas about how all this might transpire differently, how our conceptions of these massive sociotechnical projects might shift, how space might force us to rethink the terrestrial mundane rather than being an epic stage set onto which earthbound concerns can be exported intact. We can begin to sketch one such alternative position by rewinding history to the work of one of the prime movers behind twentieth-century extraterrestrial ambitions, who worked to articulate the case for getting off-planet well before even fixed-wing flight. Weâre not looking to resurrect an original, purified take on what all this might mean. Weâre simply for a handy place to restart.\n\nMoscow, the late 1880s: as heâs done for decades now, Nikolai Fedorov spends his evenings writing the essays that will eventually be gathered together asÂ The Philosophy of the Common Task. Fedorov was born the illegitimate son of a minor prince, and by trade he is a librarian; before taking to the stacks, he was a schoolteacher. He is reputed by those few who know him to be kindly if a little stern, and remarkably ascetic: he eats little, rarely and nothing sweet; he doesnât even wear a coat in winter. In all, he cuts an unlikely father figure for the Space Race. But itâs inÂ The Common TaskÂ that we find the first systematic program and rationale for permanent human settlement off-world, and a direct line can be drawn between it and the development of extraplanetary travel some decades later.\n\nThe Common TaskÂ is an unforgiving work, not because its prose is inaccessibleâquite the reverseâbut because of its uncompromising single-mindedness of purpose. As historian George Young puts it, Fedorov was âa thinker with one idea,â but for all that âhis idea was extremely complex and comprehensive.â This idea was the âcommon taskâ the bookâs title, the articulation of a plan for the entire human race, a project that can readily be sloganed asÂ storm the heavensÂ andÂ conquer death.\n\nLetâs begin with the second point first, which is in some sense the more fundamental. Fedorov understood the single common nemesis of all human beings to be death, and that getting rid of it could serve as a common rallying point around which all human beings could agree. Death in the literal sense, of courseâdeath as experienced (if thatâs really the appropriate word) by individuals; but also as exhibited in the disappearance of cultures and the downfall of civilizations, and indeed more generally still: death as the operation of the forces of âblind natureâ against which organic life was pitched as a struggle in and against darkness. Nature shows up as the force ofÂ necessity, one that confines and eventually overwhelms human beings (as all life). It is characterized by total indifference; indeed, it is the acme of such. Devoid of consciousness, it does not âknow best,â nor is it âcruelâ; if it inadvertently plays the role of tutor, it is in how to stave it off awhile, no more than that.\n\nFedorov has no time for proclamations that human beings must âlove Nature.â This was, to him, the characteristic indulgence of those he contemptuously described as âthe learnedââan elite who could spend their time singing Natureâs praises, because their everyday lives were substantially insulated from it, by precisely the kinds of technologyâfrom agriculture to medicineâthat act to counter the ânatural.â Out in the fieldâliterally as well as figurativelyâno such niceties prevail. This does not mean Fedorov promoted a project of âovercomingâ nature, in the sense of âdestroyingâ or even âdominatingâ it. He is aware that the same processes that lay waste to life are deeply implicated in life itself, even ifâin the later words of a Fedorov acolyte, the economist Sergei Bulgakovââlife seems a sort of accident, an oversight or indulgence on the part of death.âÂ His mission is instead to convert or transform the natural, toÂ bring reasonÂ to it, carving out a larger and more hospitable environment for life.\n\nThis is a deeply technological project, an extension of what alreadyâas aboveâacts to mitigate nature, although he refused to affix the term âprogressâ to his perspective. Progress, in the sense of the production of more machines of greater complexity, was in itself not enough. Indeed, espousing it was dangerous, a disordered, warping process that did not enhance the living, but further degraded us. AgainstÂ progressÂ Fedorov pitchesÂ duty, a rationalist commitment against death. This is certainly an autocratic affair, one in which âthe contradiction between the reflective and instinctiveââwhere the instinctive is the operation of blind natural forces through man, and the reflective is the means by which it might be checked and rerouted in a more productive directionâwould be decided in favor of the reasonable.Â The pursuit of sex, for instance, was for Fedorov a crass diversion of effort, the submission to unexamined impulse. A more rational base on which to build people into collectives, he felt, wasÂ kinship, and itâs no surprise, perhaps, that Fedorovâs characterization of rational duty is aÂ filialÂ duty, impassioned but firmly chaste. This dutiful sense of kinship would outmode and supersede, he hoped, easily deviated social forms like democracy.Â The whole task of social organization would alter: beginning with the creation of synthetic wombs, and later entire synthetic bodies, the task of producing and organizing human society would exceed its impulsive origins and be replaced by a rationalist schema of collective direction control; efforts to prolong life to the point of immortality, aÂ completed project of medicine, would be entwined into this transformation of basic human functions, finding its ultimate filial duty in the eventual recreation of every human being who ever lived. This is Fedorov as he is still best known: a curious prophet not only of human immortality, but of the resurrection of the dead.\n\nBut his project extended further, and inevitably upwards, not least because an enlarging human race would require more room to expand. Freedom from death would extend to freedom from the earth itself, in quite practical terms. Technologies must loosen the grip of gravity, not eradicating it per se but meaning we would no longer be forced to obey it without question, no longer subject to itsÂ necessity. Epic and unexpected, the creativity of Fedorovâs vision extended to its detail:\n\nHe speculated that someday, by erecting giant cones on the earthâs surface, people might be able to control the earthâs electromagnetic field in such a way as to turn the whole planet into a spaceship under human control. We would no longer have to slavishly orbit our sun but could freely steer our planet wherever we wished, as, in the phrase he used as early as the 1870s, âcaptain and crew of spaceship earth.â\n\nThis complex of ideas, which by the 1900s had been dubbed âcosmism,â was capable of inspiring peculiar devotion in the few who were exposed to it. (In fact, as Fedorov showed little interest in publication, itâs largely through the action of his scattered acolytes that these ideas reached the presses at all, appearing here and there in anonymous or pseudonymous forms in small circulars during Fedorovâs lifetime (often to his fury) and only posthumously finding wider release.) In the first case, some of the titanic literary figures in Russia at the time (Tolstoy and Dostoevsky among them) were transfixed by Fedorovâs imaginary range, and also by his weirdly revitalized and visionary Christianity that they hoped might head off the anarchistic and communistic movements taking shape. This strange religiosity attracted all kinds of odd followers. The austerity of Fedorovâs denunciation of sex, democracy, and an emerging consumerism appealed to all kinds of occultists and mystics, especially those playing with scientizing their beliefs even as they wanted to work their way into politics, particularly given that his project explicitly entailed that âmythical, symbolic actions,â from praying for rain to the Christian doctrine of resurrection, âwould be replaced by actual, effective ones,â with âscience as a method.â\n\nDraft drawing by Konstanin Tsiolkovsky of a spaceship interior, believed to be the first human representation of weightlessness, 1878.\n\nBut this scientific impetus, such that âpolitical and cultural problems become physical or astrophysical,âÂ found a readier home in the atheist and scientific-Promethean bent of post-revolutionary Russia (even if Fedorovâs habit of quoting the Bible made it hardly an effortless fit). It incitedâto pick one exampleâthe work of Vladimir Vernadsky, who developed the concept of the âbiosphere,â and whose astrophysical take on earthly history included seeing human beings and other terrestrial creatures as âambulant geology.â In a foreshadowing of our contemporary concept of the Anthropocene, Vernadsky noted that human reason, expressed though design, had approached the status of a significant planetary geological force by the end of the nineteenth century. More directly, and without doubt the most obvious instance of technoscientific influence,Â The Common TaskÂ played a central role in the formation of cosmonautics. Chief among the devotees of Fedorovâs thought was his protÃ©gÃ©, Konstantin Tsiolkovski, a frequent visitor to Fedorovâs library as a teenager, who was to go on to configure the mathematical basis for space travel, from a series of vital rocketry equations to the calculation of optimal ascent, descent, and orbital trajectories for spacecraft; and who put these to use in the design of the first multistage booster rockets, an extraordinary technological innovation that stood among many others in his work, including designs for airlocks and moon bases.\n\nIt seems obvious that we are confined in space to the surface of the earth, and in time to the length of a life. Fedorovâs imaginative achievement revolves around refusing to mistake the ubiquity of these constraintsâfor all the great hold they exertâas inescapable necessities we have no choice but to accept. Those who point to the huge expanse of the earth and the whole terrestrial history of lifeâthis is nothing but myopia, squalid provincialism. In isolated form, this is theÂ characteristic gestureÂ of cosmism, what we might call the âcosmist impulseâ: to consider the earth aÂ trap, and to understand the common project of philosophy, economics, and design as beingÂ the formulation of means to escape from it: to conceive a jailbreak at the maximum possible scale, a heist in which we steal ourselves from the vault.\n\nThis redescription of Fedorovâs work lets us reconfigure cosmism in unexpected ways. In particular, it foregrounds the salience ofÂ designÂ for our endeavor. This isnât simply because the cosmist impulse clearly invokes a technological program in which design is implicated. If weâre more concerned with escape asÂ an actual physical eventÂ rather thanÂ escapismÂ (a retreat into an inner psychological bunker, individual or collective), then, as Fedorov was quite aware, our plots demand a kind of material scaffoldingâvarious aeronautical technologies, to give the obvious example. He quotes, approvingly and with frequency, the developments of his time in artillery, ballooning, enormous construction projects, and medicine, and he demands the larger projects he glimpses within them be radicalized.\n\nBut the connection with design that weâll draw here is more direct, if not immediately more obvious. That is, this talk of traps and escape from them speaks to a very old understanding of the construction of traps as the very paradigm of what, today, we call design. This is an association largely forgotten even by the time of Fedorovâs writing, but one which applied anew begins to twist and accelerate both this ancient tradition and Fedorovâs cosmism into something new. A tradition which, if we situate Fedorovâs work within it, changes both this tradition and cosmism â¦\n\nWhat does design have to do with traps? Itâs certainly an association thatâs emerged, apparently independently, in many times and places. The connection lies not so much in the overt function of hunting or domestic trapsâas means to secure food, eliminate pests, and so onâbut in what the construction of traps reveals about how humans go about making things more generally.Â In his essay âVogelâs Net,â a short and striking speculation on how a hunting trap might be understood if taken out of the woods or the corner of the granary (so to speak) and placed in a gallery, anthropologist Alfred Gell draws out the ominous intentions encoded in its physical structure: âWe read in it the mind of its author,â and a âmodel of its victimââand more particularly the way that that model âsubtly and abstractly represent[s] parameters of the animalâs natural behavior, subverted in order to entrap itâ; hunting traps are âlethal parodiesâ of their preyâs behavior.\n\nIn this, the maker of the trap is âa technician of instinct and appetite,â determining the trajectories already at play in the environment and twisting them in new directions.Â The trap may involve the application of force in both its construction and operation, but it has the characteristic of applying this force with sophistication, which obtains in the way that this force is highly considered toÂ leverageÂ environmental tendencies that already exist. A human would be lucky to catch most other mammals unaided, but this can be redressed by an indirect strategy that makes use of their observed dispositionâtheir inclination to eat certain kinds of food, in the example of bait; or how a good snare kills through desperation, strangling the target as it tries to escape.\n\nThe intelligence at work in the construction of the trap is most aptly described asÂ cunning, and it extends to activities that we can broadly describe as âtechnicalâ more generally. Many are the observers who have seen in this the paradigm ofÂ craftÂ more broadly writ, the ability to coax effectsÂ fromÂ the world, rather than imposing effectsÂ onÂ it by the application of force alone. Following the grain of wood, knowing the melting points of various ores, the toughening of metal through its tempering: all these are not domineering strategies, exactly, but situations âin which the intelligence attempts to make contact with an object by confronting it in the guise of a rival, as it were, combining connivance and opposition.âÂ Incredibly improbable phenomenaâlike the ability of a person to use a lever to lift a boulderâflow from an environment arrangedÂ just so, and is a collaboration of all its parts. And so it is that Jean-Pierre Vernant describes artifacts as âtraps set at points where nature allowed itself to be overcome.âÂ They remind us, too, that to trap somethingâcontraÂ what might be intuitively inferred by the example of the hunting trapâis to arrange the behaviour of, but not necessarily demolish or otherwise unrecognisably transform, its target.\n\nThis form of craft, which merges with craftiness (and comprises the historical connection between the two words), weds design to the operation of courtly intrigues, daring military stratagems, and outbreaks of entrepreneurial success: all instances of the successful navigation of ambiguous and shifting environments, in which are demonstrated the ability to elicit extraordinary effects from unpromising materials through oblique strategies and precisely timed action, allowing the weak to prevail over the physically stronger.\n\nSubmarine escape training tower, Ford Island, Pearl Harbour, where trainee submariners learn to suppress instinctive behaviours through repeated rehearsal of escapes from the 100â water column.\n\nAs the reader may have already noted, these are just as much instances ofÂ escapeÂ as they are ofÂ setting traps. The two pivot around each other, displaying a curious reversibility. Itâs a knowledge of traps and how they function that enables one most easily to undo a trap that one is in: a talent for escape is predicated on the same intelligence that goes into entrapmentâindeed, in the example of the traps that people set for each other, itâs clear thatâas Hyde puts itâânothing counters cunning but more cunning.âÂ To outfox is to think more broadly, to find the crack in the scheme, to stick a knife into it, and to lever it open for new use. Freighting the environment with a counter-plot is the best device for escaping the machinations in which one is embroiled: a conversion of constraints into new opportunities for free action, technological development as a kind ofÂ Hydean accelerationism. As Zhuangzi wrote sometime around 475 BC,\n\nIn taking precautions against thieves who cut open satchels, search bags, and break open boxes, people are sure to cord and fasten them well, and to employ strong bonds and clasps; and in this they are ordinarily said to show their wisdom. When a great thief comes, however, he shoulders the box, lifts up the satchel, carries off the bag, and runs away with them, afraid only that the cords, bonds, and clasps may not be secure; and in this case what was called the wisdom (of the owners) proves to be nothing but a collecting of the things for the great thief.\n\nThat there must be some things that no creature can elude â¦ and that they must be discovered, recognized or observed are integral to our sense of ourselves, and the ways in which we question who we are. When a constraint can be described as something elseâwhen the earth becomes round so we canât fall off it, when the notion of sin is seen to be a devious form of social control, and so onâwe change our place in the world.\n\nAs an event in this alternative history of design, cosmism arrives as a kind of absolutization of its basic principles into a project ofÂ generalized escapology. It is a tendency dimly glimpsed in every individual act of design, extrapolated as far as possible. If design is a hustle, then cosmism is the long conâor perhaps more precisely, the most extravagant gesture ofÂ lengtheningÂ the hustle into a con: not simply an aggregation of hustlesâa chain of coin-tricks, each self-sufficient, without bearing on the nextâbut a process of nesting them into a cultivated scheme or expanding plot, so that each gambit paves the way for the next.\n\nThis opens a vista of new reference pointsâaesthetic as much as political or philosophicalâin which to set the kinds of wildly ambitious sociotechnical schemes of which the space travel is an iconic example. We might not be able to tell, as yet, what the consequences of this might beâwhat it might mean to conceive of, say, a well-established human outpost on Mars, where adults teach their children about the relation of the New World to the Old, through a history that stacks Harry Houdini and Frank Abignale among the astrophysicists and Apollo teams: an alternative set of footholds for an ascent into the dark.\n\nBut there is a twist that weÂ canÂ anticipate, a further consequence of relocating cosmism within the ambit of this history. Fedorovâs cosmism is a project, ultimately, ofÂ freedom, commissioning an assault by practical reason on the things that bind us, irrespective of their historical ubiquity; the perception that a life subjected to 1gÂ gravity is inevitable is among the casualties already listed. The conception of the world as a field of nested traps renders this vision of freedomÂ quantitative, a series of practical achievements, proceeding by degreeâwe are free of this, and then of this, and then of this, new end points emerging rather than anÂ a prioriÂ finish line at which, on breaking the ribbon, we can at last rest easy, luxuriating in a genuine liberty. Itâs questionable how compatibleÂ otherÂ long-term goals, like those that Fedorov foresaw in the colonization of the universe, are with this perspective, other than as (comparatively) short-term horizons on which to affix oneâs eyes in the course of acceleration. But this is perhaps a minor modification.\n\nMuch worse is that in Fedorovâs workâas in the decayed fractions of his thought that show up when travel beyond the margins of the earthâs gravity well is figured as an opportunity for profit, for entertainment, or for humanitarian resourceâthe line is drawn at undermining the sacred figure of Man. âDeath is a property, a condition,â Fedorov wrote, âbut not a quality without which man ceases to beÂ what he is and what he ought to be.â\n\nIn a new or renewed cosmism, this position is untenable. As weâve already seen, the same kind of intelligence is at work in setting and escaping traps. Indeed, in order to be free of a trap, itâs of less use to the trapped to decide upon some holy condition of freedom than to understand how one is implicated in the mechanism of oneâs entrapment. To engage in the former is mereÂ escapism, as weâve noted. The designation of this limit as sacrosanct is alien to the very logic of traps and of escaping them, to its abstract insurrectionary force. The unnerving aspect of this project is not, however, located in the specifics of what it is of which we are free, which is to some extent reconcilable with the Fedorovian project. Itâs contained instead in the corrosive quality of the intelligence that must be put to work. This is an intelligence founded in what Gregoire Chamayou dubs âa physics rather than a theology of power,â although âmechanicsâ might be a term more apt than âphysics.â\n\nTo explain: if setting and escaping from a trap implement the same logic, to be prey is an education in how predation operates. âIn order to anticipate the reactions of his pursuers,â Chamayou writes, âthe hunted man has to learn to interpret his own actions from the point of view of the predator â¦ : seeing himself in the third person, considering, with respect to each of his acts, how they might be used against him. This anxiety can later be transformed into reasoning.âÂ So it is that the mark begins to understand the operations of the con-artist, and the process of flipping the game can begin. This process tutors a view of oneself as in part anÂ object, and converts this knowledge into an active resource. No wonder, then, that â[s]laves in the French colonies had a word for it: escaping oneâs master was called âstealing oneâs own corpse.ââÂ This creates a pernicious stowaway in any humanist cosmist project of freedom. âThinking,â writes Ray Brassier, âhas interests that do not coincide with those of living; indeed, they can and have been pitted against the latter,â a statement never more true than here.\n\nCosmism accelerates design until its project of insubordination becomes more clearly visible. What is revealed is the irreducibility of design to stated motivations of capital interest, social progress or scientific advance, in place of a programme of incursions across any and all borders, violations of every truce, an insurrection not only against gravity but also human beings, a process by which sociotechnical structures are taken hostage by precisely what they make possible, a process ofÂ ungroundingÂ in more ways than the most obvious. This is the genuine injection of the offworld into terrestrial affairs, in which through progressive alienation freedom stacks up in the longest of cons.\n\n- - - INTERVIEWS - - -\n\nThe Speed of Future Thought: Alex Williams and Nick SrnicekÂ interviewed\n\nMay 2014\n\nC. Derick Varn and Dario Cankovich: There has been a lot spoken on Nick Landâs vision of accelerationism and your acknowledgement and distancing from Landâs anti-human embrace of neo-liberal capitalism. Would you draw out your implied critique of Nick Landâs conclusions?\n\nAlex Williams and Nick Srnicek:Â First, it is worth emphasising that the manifesto bridges two sets of ideas, some more philosophical and others more political. The critique of Land (beyond the most obvious humanist-left rejoinders) is multilayered. But the most important of criticisms is the distinction between Landâs presentation of capitalism (akin to a science fictionalised hyper-inhuman variant on Hayek) and its humdrum actually-existing reality. This is why we believe it is worth engaging with figures such as Land as they present aÂ reductio ad absurdumÂ of neoliberal capitalâs own popular self-image. We think there are important elements within this image that are necessary for any new left to engage with: real desires that this political-economic form has captured and conducted towards its own ends. If, as seems plain, it is insufficient to simply negatively oppose the worst incursions of capitalism, then working out what within neoliberal ideology is seductive and worthwhile is one starting point. So the most obvious critique of Landâs conclusions is the empirical reality we dwell in everyday: a world, at best, of profound disappointment, and at worst, of staggering inequality and squandering of human potential. But what is interesting is that the neoliberal hegemony remains relatively impervious to critique from the standpoint of the latter, whilst it appears fundamentally unable to counter a politics which would be able to combat it on the terrain of modernity, technology, creativity, and innovation. This is because of neoliberal capitalismâs value proposition: inequality and misery, yes, but dynamicism and growing prosperity on the other hand. So the conclusion is that Land (and the set of more conventional right economic social theorists he effectively glosses) are entirely insupportable. Our friend Mark Fisher has a riff on a similar idea with his critique of âactually existing capitalismâ. There are also a series of very significant long-term processes which ultracapitalists have no answer for: principally climate change and secular crisis.\n\nWhat do you think will be the content of the âpost-capitalist planningâ called for in the Manifesto. Â How would this be significantly different from schemes, not only of GOSPLAN but also of Technocracy, Inc or Italian Futurism?\n\nOur conclusion that post-capitalist planning is required stems from the theoretical failures of market socialism as well as from our own belief that a planned system can distribute goods and resources in a more rational way than the market system. This differs from previous experiments with such a system in rejecting both the techno-utopian impulse of much recent writing on post-capitalism, and the centralised nature of the Soviet system.\n\nWith regards to the former â we valorise technology not simply as a means to solve problems, but also as a weapon to wield in social struggles. So we reject any Silicon Valley-ish faith in technology â a problem that the liberal left often falls into. On the other hand, we reject any discourse of authenticity which sees technology as an aberration or as the source of contemporary problems â a problem that the proper left often falls into. The question has to be âhow can we develop, design and use technology in a way which furthers leftist goals?â This means thinking how infrastructures, data analytics, logistics networks, and automation can all play a role in building the material platform for a post-capitalist system. The belief that our current technologies are intrinsically wedded to a neoliberal social system is not only theoretically obsolete, but also practically limiting. So without thinking technology is sufficient to save us, we nevertheless believe that technology is a primary area where tools and weapons for struggle can be developed.\n\nWith regards to the centralised nature of planning, it should be clear to everyone that the Soviet system was a failure in many regards. The issue here is to learn from past experiments such as GOSPLAN, and from theoretical proposals such asÂ PareconÂ and Devineâs democratic planning. Particularly inspiring here is the Chilean experiment, Cybersyn, which contrary to the stereotype of a planned economy, in fact attempted to build a system which incorporated workerâs self-autonomy and factory-level democracy into the planned economy. There remain issues here about the gender-bias of the system (the design of the central hub being built for men, for instance), yet this experiment is a rich resource for thinking through what it might mean to build a post-capitalist economy. And it should be remembered that Cybersyn was built with less than the computing power of a smartphone. It is todayâs technology which offers real resources for organising an economy in a far more rational way than the market system does.\n\nIt has to be recognised then that communism is an idea that was ahead of its time. It is a 21st century idea that was made popular in the 20th century and was enacted by a 19th century economy.\n\nThere is very little talk of class in your manifesto. Â Â What are the models of class you building on? Marxist models focusing on production? Â Liberal models focusing on consumption? Â World Systems models? Â What do you think should be accelerationist class analysis?\n\nIn thinking of class, we enter very complicated territory. As your question points out, there are a large number of differing models by which class can be considered, focusing on variously the position within production relations, within consumption relations, as history, or identity, or geography. Moreover, this is additionally complexified in intersectional terms with gender, race, religion and sexuality. We cannot pretend to have all the answers, but we certainly believe that some European attempts to demand a return to Fordism to resolve the structural crisis in left organisation are utterly absurd. The intentional and unintended effects of the neoliberal project to restructure labour and production relations imposes real challenges which must be confronted head-on. In addition, we want to reject attempts to bind the left to any singular model of organisation (and hence also, to any pre-nominated ârevolutionaryâ class). Instead we favour what we call an ecology of organisations, which in class terms means heterogeneous networks of smaller organisations.\n\nThe recent resurgence of calls for a left unity are worthwhile, but remain constrained insofar as they think in terms of a unity. Itâ significant to note that there isnât really a âright unityâ either. What the right does have though is a set of different actors, all doing different things that have lines whereby they can come together and massively amplify their praxical power at key points. Harveyâs analysis of the tension-filled assemblage between American social evangelicals with neoliberal economic elites is but one example of how despite the lack of a unity, an ecology can nevertheless be immensely influential. So it is not unity per se that is important for the left, but instead a matter of minimal consistency, and mutual amplification. Itâs a basic consequence of thinking in terms of complex systems too â there can be no guiding Master or vanguard. To presume otherwise is to fall back into early 20th century ideas.\n\nPortions of the manifesto sound outright Gramscian, with phrases like âthe left must develop sociotechnical hegemony,â their call for the creation of âintellectual infrastructure,â âwide-scale media reform,â and, finally, what sounds like a call for the constitution of a new counter-hegemonic bloc when they say that we need to âknit together a disparate array of partial proletarian identities, often embodied in post-Fordist forms of precarious labour.â Do you see yourselves calling for a clear cultural shift?\n\nWe certainly see the Left as requiring a new hegemonic politics. In certain sectors it has become fashionable to decry power as such, and to see hegemonic politics as some kind of intrinsically abusive practice. The problem for such thinkers is that it is very difficult indeed to envisage a scenario where a non-hegemonic politics would be able to achieve significant victories over a hegemonising one. That being said, our perspective on what hegemony is, whilst clearly in debt to that espoused by Gramsci, is somewhat different in character. While civil society (and âcultureâ more broadly) is evidently an important political battleground, any understanding of what hegemony is today must entail a far broader conception: in essence, the ability to configure the social possibility space, the space on which politics itself occurs. For us, this means more than simply normative or ideological claims, but will also include technological systems (i.e. above all else infrastructures of different kinds). This is why we believe it isnât enough even to havemassive populist movement against the current forms of capitalism. Without a new approach to things such as economics, production and distribution technologies, and labour practices, a âradicalâ left will always find itself warped back into capitalistic practices.\n\nIt seems to me that we already have an âecology of organizationsâ on the left (an ecology that might be described as one of scavengers who primarily aim to pilfer members from other organizations) including âheterogeneous networks of smaller organisations.â Many organizations which resist calls for left unity emphasize the point that they already engage in various activities with other left and even liberal organizations â to give a few examples from the UK: Stop the War Coalition, RESPECT, United Against Fascism, etc., various other electoral and activist united fronts. What youâre calling for has to be different from that. I suppose the question is: what kind of organizations do we need, what kind of ecology of these organizations do we need, and what sorts of networks between them are required?\n\nThe sorts of organisations that we need are ones like Plan C, the New Economics Foundation, as well as various long-standing feminist movements around basic income as a necessary demand. Kathi Weeksâ recent The Problem with Work is exemplary here, and a truly important text. There are also media organisations such as NovaraMedia and Jacobin, which are all in their own ways at least attempting to bring left-of-liberal ideas to the mainstream â a crucial task for any counterhegemonic approach. Dan Hindâs work on media reform and the potential to repurpose media infrastructures is crucial on these sorts of issues. All these organisations are working along the right lines. There are also formations blending horizontal social movements (of heterogeneous character) with strong state leadership such as we find in Venezuela which, while difficult to see how to generalise, are definitely worthy of investigation.\n\nStill, these organisations are far from resolving many of the major problems we face, in particular in terms of modulating labour interests in a broadly successful fashion, or in being able to generate more fully worked out new economic counter proposals. A lot of this is still, necessarily perhaps, remaining at the level of critique. While it is a time honoured tradition of the left (one which we seek to uphold) that progressive politics must begin with the moment of critique, there is of course the need to move beyond such a moment. Many of these problems can perhaps be resolved by existing (or revised versions) of pre-existing organisational forms, but only once their efforts undergo something like a qualitative shift at the level of their emergent effects, that is to say, in terms of the resonance between different kinds of agents working on different projects at different levels (local, regional, transnational, global).\n\nWhy have the current ecology of organizations failed so completely in your view?\n\nThe image of scavengers is quite a nice description of a lot of ultra-left activity, a sort of zero sum game regarding members. Youâre right to point out that, in the UK for example, there are a number of examples from recent years of united fronts, focusing upon particular issues. But outside of Unite Against Fascism, most of these have ultimately been failures (though obviously Stop The War faced an incredibly tough challenge in seeking to shift Tony Blair and New Labour from their determination to make war in Iraq). Most of these are fronts which come together to confront particular issues. The problem of this approach is that they are habitually short-termist and lack any kind of âbig pictureâ beyond immediate objectives and attracting membership. The left remains reactive, and there is little sense that the current mix of organisations and the relations between them is going to be able to mount a serious challenge to neoliberalism, even given that after the crisis it is totally intellectually and economically discredited.\n\nOur alternative is not that there should be a single organisation doing the long-term thinking, or that all organisations ought to be doing so â instead a âhealthyâ political ecosystem will feature a kind of division of labour between different kinds of organisations, with different kinds of structures and interests. What is missing to tie these together is a broad ideological vision. And just as with the right, the important thing about such a vision is not that it be necessarily coherent, but that on a material basis it works, that it has a kind of efficacy in conducting action and conjoining political entities together in virtuous cycles of feedback.\n\nThere is no single model for an effective organisation, at least not one that can be known fully in advance. Leftist politics therefore must become more experimental, less tied to certain ways of organising and acting which, whilst once effective, have now become blunted. This is what we call âfolk politicsâ â how previously cutting edge ways of organising and acting become worn out, through arms race dynamics with opposing political forces, and through broader socio-technical-economic change. Much of the debate around the question of organisation at the moment traffics in tired homilies about certain caricatured forms â the party or the horizontal network. In reality, these are merely ideal forms, and you actually find always some mixture between the two. The question of organisation can only be resolved through experiment and reflection on the results of such experiments.\n\nYou mention that communism âis a 21st century idea that was made popular in the 20th century and was enacted by a 19th century economy.â The language of your manifesto suggests that you believe capitalism has finally become âdecadent,â that it is no longer capable of advancing the productive forces, that it has become âa fetter on the productive forces,â to use various Marxist locutions. Is it that the productive forces were insufficiently development for the implementation of communist social relations during the 20th century? What has changes as to make communism possible today? What technological advances render communism possible?\n\nThis is partly a speculative hypothesis of ours, though one that we think is fully consistent with a traditional historical materialism perspective. Namely that some mode of post-capitalist polity requires a certain material infrastructure to be built, and that (historically at least) it has been capitalism which accomplishes this. On a theoretical level, this intuition also stems from debates about the socialist calculation problem â which goes to the heart of the debate between market and planned economies. Famously, the argument was made in the 1930s that socialism could never match up to the efficiency or productivity of a market system of prices, and would therefore always lag behind in terms of growth. This idea, in turn, becomes one of the foundational claims of Hayekâs arguments for capitalism. Itâs important to note though, that these arguments were made prior to the existence of the computer. Today you now have economists who have gone back to these original debates and re-analysed them with the knowledge of contemporary computing power, and who find that in fact the socialist calculation problem is (at least theoretically) no longer a problem. This is an example of where advancements in technology are eliminating practical problems associated with a post-capitalist economy.\n\nAnother broad example comes from the Chilean experiment. Here, one of the major issues in trying to operate a national economy came from the lag in both input data and output data. Simply put, the system wasnât responsive enough to fully overcome some major issues having to do with a dynamic economy. Today, the problem is the opposite â we have technology which moves far too quickly. High frequency trading is extending into the nanosecond scale, and you have the perverse system where organisations are imagining privatised particle accelerators in order to shave off milliseconds of trading time. Slowness is no longer a problem for analysing economic data; itâs speed which is the problem.\n\nWe are also obtaining more tractable data in the form of all-digital economies, which are being described by the work of economists like Yanis Varoufakis. In digital worlds where every action and transaction can be known immediately, we will find a much higher resolution of empirical evidence, necessary to begin to model better the interactions between micro and macro scales within an economy. Rather than the stale formalism of much current economic modelling (particularly DSGE models), thereâs the potential here to start properly learning how to organise an economy.\n\nWhile it rarely goes mentioned except in a mutated form by Austrian economists, central banks today are massive examples of institutions which employ cutting-edge technology in order to shape, manipulate, and intervene in economies. You have not only huge macroeconometric models being developed and used here (with thousands of equations involved), but also a real experimentation going on with the possible uses of big data. Now the uses that are made of this technology (e.g. quantitative easing and the inflation of asset prices) are contestable, it still demonstrates that technology for modulating an economy is rapidly developing. The question to be asked is how can this machinery be repurposed towards collective and post-capitalist ends?\n\nOur overriding theory of change is one which is revolutionary in character without either being tied to the model of change via spectacular state-takeover, nor a secession or subtraction from the state. Instead it proposes we need to begin to think in terms of a technics of transition(s), identifying capitalism as a technology itself (both conceptual and employing technical systems) â and that therefore previous radical attempts to surmount this technical system have failed in part because they lacked the tools, and the intellectual resources to fully supplant it, to fully repurpose techniques, machines, and concepts in a way which enables a full phase transition towards a post-capitalist state of affairs. What they didnât lack, and what we will also need, is of course popular and widespread mobilisation also. We consider the development of a technics of transition(s) to be a singularly important task for left actors today, in particular because the technical environment now enables various points of ingress which were previously absent. This entails establishing platforms for further transformations. For instance, basic income (if properly implemented) could drastically alter the labour-capital relationship by negating the forced quality of work. It could liberate leisure time for the pursuit of collective ends. And it could weaken the disciplinary aspects of the welfare state by making income unconditional. From this configuration of the social platform, all sorts of new options begin to open up.\n\nDo you think that the open-source and peer-2-peer communities (which have in many ways been at the forefront of defending the Internet infrastructure against neoliberal incursions), or the Internet itself, can serve as a model of how to build networks? How do we harness the power of the Internet to our cause?\n\nThe internet, like every technology, alters the costs and benefits of a wide variety of behavioural possibilities. It decreases the costs of organising, while also decreasing the costs of state and corporate surveillance, for instance. Thereâs nothing inherently liberating (or repressive) about it, and so the problem is always how to use it best.\n\nCertainly the P2P and open-source movements, along with pirated intellectual property (and with 3D printing, potentially material property as well), are all important movements. They are contributing to the material basis of a post-capitalist economy by eliminating some areas of resource scarcity and forming networks to make collaboration and distribution easily possible.\n\nDespite these material advances, two tendencies need to be warded off â tendencies which are particularly prevalent in the discourses around the internet. The first is naÃ¯ve techno-utopianism, privileging the new in itself. Thereâs nothing inherently progressive about novelty, and thereâs no reason to think technology will supersede political conflicts. Instead it has to be recognised that any new technology can be employed as a weapon in these conflicts. Thereâs no utopianism here, merely a recognition that the terrain and infrastructure of political conflicts are constantly being transformed by technology, and any left worth its name needs to recognise this and adapt.\n\nThe second tendency to avoid is the reduction of politics to internet issues. While open sources, freedom of information, and privacy in the face of big data are all significant issues, there is nevertheless a large group of internet activists for whom these issues become the totality of politics. More interesting to us, is work that seeks to bridge how computational infrastructures are altering traditional politics. As one example, a friend of ours does immensely interesting work on Amazon cloud computing, demonstrating how the platform logic of such entities evades traditional boycott methods. Others, such as Benjamin Bratton, are looking at the emerging geopolitical transformations being wrought by massive internet companies â these are increasingly taking on the function of polities, and the question to be raised is what can be done with or against them?\n\nLastly, this is something we unclear on from your manifesto: How much could accelerationists focus on particular polities (such as specific) nation-states and how much should we be working around such entities?\n\nWe need to begin from what we know about power. Politics, for all the transformations of the spatiality of power, remains deeply imbricated with the nation state. At the very least, we cannot ignore the state as probably the principle battleground of action today. This isnât necessarily because of a reformist or entryist position, but simply that, when we look at the spread of new political ideas, the state is the key territory within which they occur. Scalarity is important here. The state, in spite of the growth of transnational networks and organisations of different types (from new social movements to corporations), retains a high degree of territoriality.\n\nGlobally spreading ideas must localise at the level of the state, as well as at the level of the local. The history of neoliberalism demonstrates the use of key states as hubs within the establishment of broader networks of power. The old 1990s activist maxim to âthink global, act localâ was an attempt to think the complexities of power in a multiscalar political world, but one which posits only two poles: the global and the local. We consider both of these to be important, along with the regional, the national, and the transnational. Each of these is involved in the geometries of power â and we cannot fetishise as horizon of action any of these.\n\nWhile the nation state is (highly) problematic, in particular for the global dynamic of international competition which generates immensely perverse problems, this does not mean that it can be ignored.\n\nSpeed Trials: A Conversation about Accelerationist Politics\n\nFall 2015\n\nSalemy - As a curator, I have been investigating the synthesis of mass computation and mass telecommunication, or what I have called telecomputation,Â and its role in both the transformation of the human and the emergence of new artificial epistemes in regard to knowledge production in general and creative practices in particular. The publication of Alex Williams and Nick Srnicekâs â#Accelerate: Manifesto for Accelerationist Politicsâ (MAP)Â in spring 2013 was an important turning point in my research at the time for a couple of curatorial projects, namely theÂ Encyclonospace IranicaÂ exhibition (2013) and theÂ Incredible Machines ConferenceÂ (2014). Until encounteringÂ MAP, I tended to consider the proper attitude toward telecomputation a critical, if not a rejectionist, one; I resisted the thought that networked computers, if not also the larger technology of capital accumulation, offered emancipatory possibilities toward the realization of a post-capitalist society. However,Â MAPÂ not only crystallizes, in a precise and consistent language, the most convincing arguments in favour of a technological intervention in political economy but also responds to what I had considered the unresolved challenges of the twenty-first century.Â MAPÂ also provides the closest alternative to a cognitive roadmap for, and even maybe an exit from, both the dominant political systems and the oppositional emancipatory strategiesâsuch as poststructural institutional reform or neo-Marxist grassroots local action (e.g., Occupy)âthat we inherited from the twentieth century. By now,Â MAP, which has been translated into many languages (fifteen and counting: I myself am in the process of translating it into Farsi), is being read by a large group of people and responded to by a new generation of scholars and activists as well as older thinkers, like Antonio Negri. Meanwhile, the core accelerationist arguments and terminology are slowly becoming part of contemporary political and theoretical debates about, for example, the insufficiency of local politics in light of larger global problems requiring universal solutions; the failures of the Western leftâboth the Marxists and the poststructuralistsâin challenging neoliberalism; the rejection of the total negation of capitalism; the proposal to salvage usable parts of the current geopolitical system in our post-capitalist future; and, finally, the embrace of science and technology as practical but also conceptual tools for restructuring the humanities and cultural studies.\n\nNick and Alex, most people donât know how both of you were led to this collaborative project. You both come from a broadly speculative realist background.Â Nick, you were one of the founders of theÂ Speculative HeresyÂ blogÂ with philosopher and author Ben Woodard and Taylor Adkins, and, Alex, you had your own blog,Â Splintering Bone Ashes. How did your shift from speculative realism to accelerationismÂ take place, and, consequently, how didÂ MAPÂ come to be?\n\nAlex WilliamsÂ â The manifesto has two chief inspirations: political and philosophical. In political terms, this goes back to the 2007â09 financial crisis and the economic downturn and fiscal debt crises that followed. What was interesting for us was the sheer paucity of the leftâs response to such calamitous events. I remember attending the 2009Â Idea of CommunismÂ conference at Birkbeck, London, with great anticipation. It featured an extremely illustrious list of communist thinkers from the continental tradition. But while they discussed many interesting ideas, it was clear they didnât have any prospective strategic thoughts about capitalizing on what was shaping up to be the worst crisis capitalism had faced for seventy years. In the years that followed, the practical responses of the radical left also seemed pretty inadequate. While movements like Occupy Wall Street, new student movements, and the rise of protest organizations like Spainâs 15M initially seemed to hold the promise of a serious new cycle of struggle, each quickly fell apart or was unable to properly articulate a new politics that would be capable of being generalized. Meanwhile, the forces of the right in Europe and America were able to massively extend the neoliberal project in a way that perhaps should not be surprising, given the history of neoliberalism, but that took much of the left by surprise.\n\nNickSrnicekÂ â For me, the key moment was the 2008 crisis and the complete lack of response to itâboth in political movements that aimed beyond a simple nostalgia or a conservative resistance and in philosophical thinking. Iâd been trained in the work of thinkers like Gilles Deleuze, Alain Badiou, Slavoj Å½iÅ¾ek, et al., but when I read their commentaries, or when I turned to their concepts to understand the situation, they seemed to offer very little of use. Much like Alex, for me it was striking just how little philosophy was of use in a crisis/opportunity situation. And so I made a full-fledged turn toward political economy. (This had already been in the background, but it now became the key aspect of my thinking.) But my turn toward all that was filtered through the recent work being done in speculative realism. Against the dominant strands of philosophy that I had been trained in, speculative realism was significant to me for bringing back an emphasis on materiality, on technology, and (through speculative realismâs failures) on epistemology. I think you can see those influences inÂ MAP, but that text itself stems from the global experiences of continued neoliberalism and my personal experiences with various student occupations, the student protests in the UK, and Occupy London. It was easy to see why people were enthralled by these things, since there was a real sense of accomplishment, solidarity, and potential transformation. But nothing changed in the end, and what emerged was the imperative to understand this failure. Despite the mass mobilization, why did nothing change?\n\nWilliamsÂ â I consider speculative realism a ânon-movementâ because, for various now well-documented reasons, speculative realismâs âfoundersâ have almost nothing in common, beyond a stated intent to reject correlationism. One sector of speculative realism that did cohere, however, and seemed to offer some intriguing pathways out of now all-too-familiar continental theoretical debates, was the work of Ray Brassier and Reza Negarestani.Â In particular, the provocative ideas Brassier had developed around defending the Enlightenment precisely as a vector of alienation proved to be influential.Â While we would not describe our work as being âspeculative realistâ in orientation (especially given the dubious cast the term has been given in the years since its initial deployment), we certainly agree that the emphasis in the best work collected under that name on realism, materiality, and questions of epistemology has been important in changing the ways we thought political phenomena might be interpreted. Speculative realism has been accused of being âapolitical,â particularly by writers coming at these debates from an art-world context, but I think that was always misleading. On the one hand, philosophers such as Brassier and Negarestani rarely go on the record about political matters, but their work has obvious political implications that are worth cashing out. In particular, the shift toward forms of realism implies a way of thinking about political phenomena that are not overdetermined by their discursive manifestations. Now, it is important here not to simply revert to an old-school, âtable-thumpingâ realism or boorish mechanistic materialism. The sociopolitical world is complex. But this complexity was only ever imperfectly mapped by those poststructuralists who were overly invested in discursivity. This would be one important political impact of thinking with Brassier and Negarestani. At the same time as the rise of speculative realism came a general increase in interest (on the academic left) in political economy and economics and finance more generallyâprincipally to understand how the crisis was operating.\n\nSrnicekÂ â I wouldnât say accelerationism is a synthesis, necessarily. Speculative realism was important for its particular questioning of habitual ideas about thought, reality, and particularly materiality (feminism and anthropology were significantly ahead of most philosophy here). Speculative realism generated a certain orientation to these things. But in its specific content, I think it has been less influential. For all the excellent work done by some of those associated with the term, I donât think a classic work of philosophy has emerged out of it yet. But it has, and continues, to shape how the newest generation of continental philosophers approach the world.\n\nWilliamsÂ â One important influence of Brassierâs philosophy was its emphasis on the absolute necessity of a compact between knowledge of the world and our ability to transform it. This is perhaps the most significant point of convergence between Brassierâs transcendental realism and the Marxian tradition.\n\nSrnicekÂ â Indeed, the point about the compact between knowledge and our ability to transform it is crucial. It gets conjoined under the term âPrometheanismââwhich, minimally, is the claim that we can intervene in and build a better world. There is hubris in that, but itâs a hubris thatâs necessary to any leftist politics (leaving aside the various defeatist positions).\n\nThe most concrete of all accelerationist ambitions has been the forceful reintroduction of the concepts of universal basic income (UBI) and the abolition of work to the forefront of a leftist agenda for the future. The strength of these two arguments is derived from their synthesis: elimination of work can be considered progressive only if it is accompanied byÂ UBI. The only unanswered question regardingÂ UBI, however, is the real possibility of its implementation on a global scale. If this concept were adopted, say, only in the advanced and post-Fordist societies, wouldnât it create a two-tiered world, one in which a rather large part of the world has to cope with an outdated system while the smaller and smarter part enjoys living in the future? IfÂ UBIÂ can be implemented only in certain pockets of our global civilization with specific socioeconomic heritages, wouldnât we end up with a situation like the twentieth centuryâs Communist bloc? Isnât this eerily reminiscent of Joseph Stalinâs âsocialism in one countryâ?\n\nSrnicekÂ â This is one of most difficult issues forÂ UBIâthe generalization of the proposal beyond one country. There is no easy answer, but itâs worth pointing out that a similar problem confronts the stateâs provision of welfare. The goal of a post-work society, as we argue in our book, has to be universal, which is to say, global. But thereâs no way to simply skip past the difficult work of building that world, and that means the project has to start locally, somewhere. Inevitablyâas with any proposalâit would be an uneven and combined development, but we argue that a post-work society should operate as a regulative ideal for political struggles. Most importantly, though, is the fact thatÂ UBIÂ is a bootstrapping mechanismâit enables class proletarian power to be strengthened, and this provides leverage for further developments, including in terms of transnational solidarity. (This is also why critiques ofÂ UBIÂ as being simply a redistribution mechanism are misplacedâthey miss the way it changes political relations in production by removing the imperative to work.) In other words, successfully achievingÂ UBIÂ in one place makes it easier to achieve elsewhere. In that sense, it has a dynamic that not many other proposals do (although a reduction of the working week also has this dynamic and is another key avenue for building a post-work society). Itâs worth noting as well that there are numerousÂ UBIÂ movements in the developing world: Mexico, Brazil, and South Africa have strong movements for it, for instance. There are local foundations for this universal project, in other words.\n\nWilliamsÂ â The question of the applicability ofÂ UBIÂ to non-âcoreâ capitalist nations seems to be simply a question of time. If the key driver behind the present interest inÂ UBIÂ is the new wave of automation, then for any part of the world the issue is a simple one: When will it become cheaper for a robot or algorithm to perform your work function? There will be limits to thisâfine motor movements are automatable, but often only with extreme cost. However, the broader project ofÂ UBIÂ is to transform the way societies think about work itself, about value, and about how societies should be made responsible for the value they produce. As Nick mentions,Â UBIÂ is not an end goal but rather a staging post, what we also term a âplatform,â enabling a broader range of alternative actions to be conducted in the light of it.\n\nThe problems can compound if advanced democratic states, in order to afford an inlandÂ UBI, are forced to tighten the screws on outland territories, a development that locally may produce a more egalitarian prospect for citizens of advanced democracies but can cause an overall regression globally. Itâs like the saying âone step forward and two steps back.â What do you think are the global preconditions ofÂ UBI? A kind of a networked world government?\n\nSrnicekÂ â There are risks involved inÂ UBIâthat it may heighten impediments to the free flow of people and generate anti-immigration sentiment. But the response to this has to be, first, how is that risk different from countries with extensive welfare systems? And, second, anti-immigration rhetoric is already increasingâand in significant part because of the difficulty of finding jobs. That changes if the coercive aspects of wage labour are removed via a basic income. It is important to be aware, however, that the conditions for a properly leftistÂ UBIÂ need to be in place beforehand. Most commentators abstract the idea from its contextâarguing for its immediate implementation. Itâs not clear to me, though, that the conditions are right for it. At the moment,Â UBIÂ is more likely to be implemented in the way Milton Friedman envisaged it: as a replacement for the state and as an extension of the market. Work has to be done first on a cultural and political level before a leftistÂ UBIÂ has a chance of succeeding. The groundwork has to be laid outâand this, we argue, can only be achieved through counter-hegemonic struggle.\n\nWilliamsÂ â The question is: How does capital coerce workers if they can exist without a job? This is where I think the battles aroundÂ UBIÂ will really begin. We cannot forget that alongside labourâs economic surplus-value extraction role, labour also performs a disciplinary role. Iâm not sure global government is a precondition forÂ UBI. It has been trialled in localities before, with some successes, in places as diverse as India, Macau, Iran, and regions of the United States. I do think that if a national-scale experiment withÂ UBIÂ were to prove a big success, governments elsewhere would want to attempt implementing it. Perhaps more serious is the question of whether it would prove to be economically inflationary, in the sense of inflating pricesâbut even this would effectively act as a redi"
