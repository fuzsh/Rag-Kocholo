Cole thoughtfully and thoroughly engages in an analysis that extends beyond the modern era to take into account a multiplicity of events and forces, which in their encounters produce social and cultural phenomena. Cole’s work is explicitly political as he engages in applied philosophy to elaborate upon the flows of capitalism and the emergence of Kate Middleton as a media object. The book, in its entirety, both is and is not about Kate Middleton. Through detailed and beautiful storytelling, Cole explores various historical plateaus (e.g., the death of Princess Diana, and monarchies of King George VI, Henry II and Lady Eleanor, the rise of industrialism, attitudes towards and about teaching) and describes the ways in which those plateaus are still at work, in some cases almost one thousand years later, to construct a capitalised education. Elaborating on the notion of capitalised education, Cole describes his project as a consideration of “the ways in which the factors analysed and revealed...come together and produce palpable social and cultural effects through Kate Middleton as media object” (p. 2). In his elaborations, Cole develops an immanent materialist analysis that is informed by the work of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari’s notions of assemblage, the rhizome, desire, and the Body without Organs, to name a few, though Cole does not get bogged down in explaining the theory itself. Rather, Cole embodies a Deleuzoguattarian ontology as he seeks to move beyond origins and causation and instead focuses on the at times more unfamiliar, but ever-proliferating intensities that impact the ways in which we emerge with that which we encounter, at times unconsciously. Students of philosophy, history, and education, and researchers who are interested in Deleuzoguattarian-influenced work will find Cole’s work both compelling and thoroughly enjoyable. ~ anonymous, Amazon site\n\nThe pomp and ceremony of a royal wedding might seem a strange anachronism in a world of global finance and cyber-capitalism. Yet, as David Cole demonstrates, the two are folded intricately into each other. Through an immanent materialist analysis that brings together key recent and historical moments or ‘plateaus’ in the emergence of capitalism, liberalism, and constitutional monarchy, and culminating in Kate Middleton’s 2011 marriage to Prince William, Cole’s wide ranging and provocative work reveals the complex and subtle ways in which capitalism’s decoding and deterritorialization go hand-in-hand with the continuation of social privileges and hierarchies. Along the way he speaks to the major political movements of the last century (liberalism, communism, fascism, empire, and decolonization), the globalization of media, the 2008 financial crisis, and more. Linking these to both established and emerging theories of radical political action, Cole traces the moments of rupture that might allow another politics to come to the fore. ~ Nathan Widder, Royal Holloway, University of London\n\nKate Middleton is an international celebrity, as well as a crucial figure in the biological, economic, and cultural reproduction of the British class system. In this book, David R. Cole offers us a multifaceted analysis of Middleton as \"media object.\" Touching on topics as diverse as courtly love in medieval Europe and derivatives markets in contemporary finance, Capitalised Education traces a web of far-flung relationships that fatally lead us back to the absurdities of our collective fascination with the British Royal Family. ~ Steven Shaviro, Wayne State University\n\nCole has produced a masterful and critical evaluation of how the British Monarchy continues to assert and grow its influence in the 21st century. He significantly contributes to an almost muted discourse which critically explores how this influence is achieved and what is risked and gained in its attainment. The reader can’t but be left with a desire to question whether we should be comfortable with the process and effects this has on our behaviour, development and socialisation. ~ Roberto H.

In response to new attacks on transcendental philosophy by speculative realists, I defend a certain type of transcendentalism, which can be called transcendental realism. Gilles Deleuze's reading of the ancient Stoics would be the best example of an effort to keep transcendentalism while taking a realist or even a materialist stand. In this regard, I examine the concept of extinction as the central idea of the Anthropocene. I refer to two contemporary philosophers, namely Catherine Malabou and Ray Brassier, who, reacting to the Dipesh Chakrabarty's and Quentin Meillassoux's demands to abandon the transcendental philosophy, direct their analyses towards a unificatory view, which is the core characteristic of the version of the transcendental approach applied in this paper. Malabou's unificatory tool is her notion of \"the brain of history\", which will be discussed together with Deleuze's idea of the agency of death. Brassier's method to connect ancestrality and the \"here and now\", or the idea that the absolute extinction has already happened, will be considered as a feature of his transcendentalism. Ultimately, I conclude that as both Malabou and Brassier, despite their materialism, have to incorporate the transcendental approach into their theories, a philosophical response to the Anthropocene must view the transcendental extinction as its problematic.\n\nThis paper is an effort to redeem the figure of Prometheus—to transform him from a tragic victim of his own hubris into a rational political agent.

What makes Prometheus a tragic figure is the presumption that there is a “given,” “natural,” or “immutable” limit to our capacities for thought and\n\naction—the transgression of which necessarily yields catastrophe. Against this presumption, I will argue that—while there are always limitations upon what we can know and what we can do—these limits are contingent and mutable, contestable and changeable. To argue otherwise is to endorse\n\nan intrinsically theological notion of givenness that serves to naturalise and perpetuate present forms of oppression. By contrasting two very different notions of a limit—the “given” or “immutable” with the “contingent” or “changeable”—I hope to reconcile our image of Prometheus with that of the young Marx, who considers Prometheus’ defiance of transcendent authority to be the task of every philosopher.\n\nThough most neomaterialists share a commitment to the Copernican decentring of humans from the world stage, there is disagreement on the purposes of such an endeavour.

The polemic stems from a fundamental discrepancy about what the return to materiality entails: is matter the principle of the non-thinking as such, or is it always already imbued with some sort of subjectivity? Is the new materialism's goal to come to terms with the non-living origin of life? Or is it rather to recognize that seemingly dead materials are always in some sense incipiently alive? For convenience , we can think of two neomaterialist perspectives: the rationalist or elim-inative neomaterialism, and the vitalist or panpsychist neomaterialism. I explore some of the conceptual problems faced by both camps and, drawing from the recently developed theory of consciousness as integrated information (Tononi), as well as its quantum physical construal by Max Tegmark, I suggest some provisional ways to address those issues.\n\nIn Nihil Unbound and other shorter works, Ray Brassier develops his contemporary transcendental realism by adopting the nihilistic aspects of thinkers such as Laruelle, Sellars and Badiou, while leaving behind their anthropic residuals.... more\n\nIn Nihil Unbound and other shorter works, Ray Brassier develops his contemporary transcendental realism by adopting the nihilistic aspects of thinkers such as Laruelle, Sellars and Badiou, while leaving behind their anthropic residuals. What is surprising is that Brassier has yet to publish any critical analysis of Nick Land despite their striking similarities and interactions at Warwick University (notwithstanding Brassier's introduction to Land's collected writings and a 2010 talk on Land). This paper aims to fill in this gap by showing how Brassier adheres to Land's initial philosophy of the negative while rejecting its humanist political corollaries in favor of an epistemological turn to science. I will first show how Brassier adopts Land's idea that we must come to terms with our future extinction as the transcendental condition for thinking a non-conceptual reality beyond our anthropic delusions of grandeur. Unlike Brassier, however, Land goes on to identify capitalism's destructive processes as the organon for death's transcendental critique. Consequently, Land's recent work develops a pro-capitalist, neoreactionary politics with deeply narcissistic tendencies insofar as it rests on gratifying individuals' basest passions and greed. Conversely, Brassier maintains Land's initial notion of death as the transcendental critique of anthropocentrism, but instead links it to cosmology's insight into the solar system's eventual demise beyond anthropic political processes within our control. Although Brassier thereby believes that he is able to appropriate Land's useful conceptual resources for de-anthropomorthizing philosophy while stripping him of his humanist political remnants, this paper will conclude by drawing on the suggestions of Mark Fisher and Reza Negarestani to proffer a Landian rejoinder to Brassier: even if capitalism is anthropomorphic, it is necessary to politically fight against it rather than abandon politics altogether in favor of science, if only to rid science of its ideological servitude under the reign of capital.\n\nContinental philosophy has recently been shaken by the so called “speculative realism” movement.

Accordingly, speculative realism tries to provide a non-idealist\n\nsolution to the typically post-Kantian problem of the genesis of the transcendental. In the\n\nfirst part of this paper I will show how Quentin Meillassoux, Ray Brassier, Iain Hamilton\n\nGrant – three of the participants of the workshop that gave “Speculative Realism” its name on\n\nApril 2007 at Goldsmith University of London – propose to overcome the circle of correlation,\n\nspecifically in the form created by Fichte, so as to access the in-itself as a reality which is\n\ncompletely independent of thought, while being able to ground the possibility of its existence.\n\nIn the second part I will compare their different strategies and consider some issues that, in\n\nmy opinion, are problematical as non-correlationist solutions. Finally, in the last part, I will\n\npropose a rough account of the direction that I mean to take towards solving the problem of\n\nthe genesis of the transcendental.\n\nIn pursuing a problem, the philosopher inevitably comes up against the limits of a particular philosophical framework to deal with that problem.

At this juncture, she may either abandon the problem in the interests of the framework or abandon the framework in the interests of the problem. The former constitutes intellectual myopia. The latter constitutes thinking. In fearlessly and relentlessly pursuing philosophical problems, Ray Brassier not only transcends academic enclaves, he problematises the commodification of philosophy as a finished product to be marketed and exchanged. Above and beyond what he thinks, Brassier's contemporary significance consists in how-or rather, that-he thinks. This course will explore the philosophical and political implications of both. Renowned as Speculative Realism's unwitting founder, Ray Brassier is a philosopher in constant movement. Over the past twenty years, he has been synthesising New French Philosophers such as François Laruelle, Alain Badiou, and Quentin Meillassoux with the Anglo-American traditions of cognitive science (Paul Churchland) naturalism (Wilfrid Sellars) and inferentialism (Robert Brandom). While these anomalous exercises in conceptual subversion are often brilliantly disorientating, Brassier's infidelity to any particular philosophical tradition betrays a profound fidelity to particular philosophical problems. This course will take up the three major philosophical problems preoccupying Brassier: the problem of nihilism, the problem of naturalism, and the problem of normativity. Although they remain inextricable from one another, each problem becomes the focus of his work at a different point in time. Thus, it is possible to distinguish between Brassier's nihilistic phase (extending from his earliest articles up until the publication of Nihil Unbound in 2007); his naturalistic phase (consisting of a sustained engagement with Wilfrid Sellars between 2008 until 2013); and his normative phase (indexing an increasing interest, since 2014, in Anglo-American Hegelianism and Marxism).\n\nThere exists a tenacious dichotomy between the 'organic' and the 'synthetic' in electronic music.

In spite of immediate opposing qualities, they instill sensations of each other in practice: Acoustic sounds are subject to artificial mimicry while algorithmic music can present an imitation of human creativity. This presents a post-human aesthetic that questions if there are echoes of life in the machine. This paper investigates how sonic aesthetics in the borderlands between electronic avant-garde, pop and club music have changed after 2010. I approach these aesthetics through Brian Massumi's notions of 'semblance' and 'animateness' as abstract monikers to assist in the tracing of meta-aesthetic experiences of machine-life, genre, musical structure and the listening to known-unknown noise. The idea of a post-Internet society acts as framework for the intimate relation between pop and avant-garde in contemporary electronic music. This relation is a result of a sonic contextualization of late-capitalist society via the Internet. Finally I discuss how pop is the noise in the avant-garde and how the human in a post-Internet era presents itself through synthetic plasticity.\n\nConference in Critical Thought (LCCT) Friday & Saturday, 8-9 July, 2022 School of Law, Birkbeck College, University of London For several decades now, post-Nietzschean philosophies of life have received a great deal of attention,... more\n\nConference in Critical Thought (LCCT) Friday & Saturday, 8-9 July, 2022 School of Law, Birkbeck College, University of London\n\nFor several decades now, post-Nietzschean philosophies of life have received a great deal of attention, perhaps best encapsulated by the every-increasing influence of Gilles Deleuze's philosophy of vital 'affirmation'. However, there have also been several important reactions against this trend — 'negativist' critiques of the affirmationist tendency. The aim of this stream is to reflect on the reasons, currency, and the future of the negativist orientation in contemporary continental thought and intersecting fields. The stream hopes to attract both advocates and detractors of this negativist orientation, in order to contribute to a rethinking of life amidst, and potentially after, the 'dark turn'.\n\nThe negativist orientation in contemporary continental thought has appeared in many different forms. Philosophers such as Nick Land, Ray Brassier and Eugene Thacker have, from different perspectives, contested vitalism for its tendency to reproduce anthropocentrism and proposed negativities that claim to be superior to affirmation. Quentin Meillassoux restricted life to an ex nihilo emergence whose radical contingency is liable to arbitrary disappearance. Graham Harman’s idea of the “withdrawal” of objects designates a form of negation by which even the most trivial objects escape not only being as an overarching identity but also life as creative difference. From a Marxist point of view, Benjamin Noys denounced the relevance of affirmationist politics by arguing that it is only through developing an advanced form of negation after and against Deleuze that we can counter the real abstractions of the capital. Reza Negarestani defines the task of philosophy as the production of an intelligence that frees thought from the immanence of life by providing an “outside view of ourselves”. It is also notable that, both the literature in Afro-pessimism, with its call for the destruction of the earth, and also the growing body of work in non-philosophy, with its stance against vitalism, can be said to take part in the same critical divergence from the prioritization of life.\n\nFurthermore, not all tendency towards negativity is determined by anti-Deleuzean or anti-Nietzschean dispositions. Contrary to the mainstream affirmationist path, Deleuze scholarship has also produced an alternative Deleuzeanism that trace in Deleuze an undiscovered world of negativity. Among others, Eleanor Kaufmann’s development of Deleuze’s unfinished “dark ontology”, Joshua Ramey’s search for the dark hermeticism of Deleuze, and Andrew Culp’s provocative call for “cultivating a hatred for this world”, provide examples of subversive readings of Deleuze that respond to the impasses of affirmationism. However, the question concerning why has there been a need to either challenge Deleuze with superior negativities or to create darker images of Deleuze seems to remain obscure.\n\nThis stream invites participants with an interest in exploring the above negativist and affirmationist movements in contemporary continental thought and related fields. We are especially keen on attracting presenters that can develop dialogue between protagonists and offer new perspectives on the negativist/affirmationist debate, ideally leading to new ways forward.\n\nGilles Deleuze's thought is uniquely placed at the interface of post-structuralism and the speculative/ontological turn which marked the humanities in general and continental philosophy in particular at the beginning of the twenty-first... more\n\nGilles Deleuze's thought is uniquely placed at the interface of post-structuralism and the speculative/ontological turn which marked the humanities in general and continental philosophy in particular at the beginning of the twenty-first century. On the one hand, Deleuze shares with his post-structuralist contemporaries the commitment to Nietzsche's project of overturning Platonism and the critique of representation. On the other hand, while post-structuralism for the most part unfolded under the aegis of Heidegger's pronouncements on the end of philosophy and the overcoming of metaphysics, for Deleuze the critique of representation constitutes the necessary condition for the reaffirmation of philosophy's rights to metaphysical speculation. In this respect, Deleuze can be regarded as an important predecessor to the speculative/ontological turn. Therefore an engagement with Deleuze's thought presents an opportunity to better understand the current conjuncture in the humanities. This paper presents an account of Deleuze's critique of representation by tracing his argument against representation and in favour of intuitive knowledge and speculative metaphysics through a close reading of a few select and particularly revealing places in Deleuze's early writings. The conclusion then places this discussion of Deleuze's thought in the context of the recent turn in the humanities and continental philosophy away from post-structuralism and towards speculative realism.\n\nThis thesis is situated at the crossroads between philosophy, political theory, and art.

It proceeds from an enquiry into various philosophical discourses on ‘the real’ – in particular the Lacanian conceptualization of the real as impossible and the Guattari-Deleuze formulation of the real as artificial. It examines what these discourses engender in political theory and in the fields of art and activism. It looks at their investment in constructing ‘a people’ and seeks to understand this as an enterprise that involves images and their configuration. From this angle, the project is interested in exploring the discussion on ‘democracy and art’ and engages in advocating a shift in current positions on their relation. After critiquing Chantal Mouffe’s agonistic pluralism, it is suggested that provoking such a shift might be achieved by outlining a model similar to the way that Mouffe develops a model or ‘democratic design’.\n\nMouffe’s model is structured on Lacan’s ‘impossible real’. Accordingly, this dissertation points towards a design for pluralism based on ‘a real’ grounded in Wilfrid Sellars’ conceptualization of a stereoscopic fusion between what he termed the manifest and scientific images of man-in-the-world. The project suggests that images can be sites in which such models or ‘designs’ are put into conceptual shape. Sellars’ characterization of science as being rational, not because it has foundation, but rather because it is a self-correcting venture that can put any claim into jeopardy, is drawn on as the basis for the ‘construction of a people’ established on the Sellarsian real. Furthermore, the project engages with the work of a number of post-Sellarsian thinkers to lay the grounds for an argument for ‘reasoning’ as a distinct position that can be taken up in the context of the structural reality of democracy and its relation to art. The term post-agonistics (or postagonistics) indicates this shift to reasoning and how it might contribute to the expanded field of art.\n\nDownloadable from Goldsmiths Research Online: http://research.gold.ac.uk/22573/\n\nIn his 2012 book Weird Realism: Lovecraft and Philosophy, Graham Harman suggests that, just as Hölderlin was to Heidegger and Mallarmé was to Derrida, H.P.

Lovecraft is the literary muse of the Speculative Realist philosophers because “the greatness of Lovecraft even pertains to more than the literary world, since it brushes against several of the most crucial philosophical themes of our time” (Harman Weird Realism 10). Speculative Realism is not a unified school but it does operate as an umbrella term that unites four otherwise incompatible theorists: Harman’s object-oriented ontology, Quentin Meillassoux’s speculative materialism, Ray Brassier’s nihilism, and the cyber-vitalism of Ian Hamilton Grant. What connects these thinkers is that they unite realism and speculation. Realism, here, is a rejection of the Kantian legacy that turns philosophy inward rejecting the possibility of examining things in themselves. Speculation rejects the naïve realism that claims knowledge of the commonplace things outside the mind and instead attests to an inarticulate, ineffable “weird reality” that bares little resemblance to our everyday experience. The speculative realists express a particular interest in horror, sf, and fantastic literature because of the special quality of unknowing, awe, and terror these modes incite; this special quality is indicative of how we might respond to reality out there. In other words, these texts offer speculations on reality. Brassier, for example, wrote the foreword to Thomas Ligotti’s non-fiction book defending nihilism and anti-natalism The Conspiracy against the Human Race (2010) remarking that the very locale of knowledge, the living subject, is “malignantly useless” and that “Ligotti knows full well, if living is lying, then even telling the truth about life’s lie will be a sublimated lie” (Brassier 10). Meillassoux’s 2015 essay “Science Fiction and Extro-Science Fiction” is an extended reading of Asimov’s “The Billiard Ball” and introduces the concept of extro-science fiction suggesting that “the guiding question of extro-science fiction is: what should a world be, what should a world resemble, so that it is in principle inaccessible to a scientific knowledge, so that it cannot be established as the object of a natural science” (Meillassoux 5-6). In other words, in the context of literature, each thinker is concerned with the possibilities of representation that expresses phenomena and, possibly, the radically unusual non-human noumena of the world out there. This paper will consider the prospects and setbacks of this methodology as a lens through which to read sf and fantasy literature. How can, for example, the speculative realist thinkers offer productive points of entry into examinations of Reza Negarestani’s Cyclonopedia (2008), Samuel Delany’s Dhalgren (1975), and the work of Thomas Ligotti and Michel Houellebecq? Alternatively, texts like Toni Morrison’s Beloved (1987), Octavia Butler’s Kindred (1979), and the work of Samuel Beckett and Jeff Noon, for example, object to the very possibility of representing a thing-in-itself and thus offer instances of humility that directly challenge the claims of speculative realism. Ultimately, this paper will consider how speculative realism invigorates and interrogates the sense of awe and wonder in the very notion of representation in sf and fantastic literature.\n\nAmong recent end-of-the-world films – such as Armageddon (Bay, 1998) or Interstellar (Nolan, 2014) – Lars von Trier’s 2011 film, Melancholia, stands out for a number of reasons.

The film’s explicitly Romantic concerns have become a ready point of reference for film-philosophy; however, this paper proposes a new take, inspired by the film’s emphasis on the simultaneity of psychic and cosmic annihilation. On the one hand, this of course evokes Freud’s famous essay on grief and depression, “Mourning and Melancholia”, as well as Kristeva’s own stellar intervention on the topic, Soleil noir (both highlighting the curious silence on the topic to be found in the work of Lacan). And on the other, it points to Ray Brassier’s Nihil Unbound, where he examines (via Lyotard) the possibility of thought in the certain knowledge of the end of all things through “solar catastrophe” (223). This paper will seek a dialogue between such positions – beyond Brassier’s incomplete appeal to the death drive – in order to explore the possibilities that von Trier’s film, and cosmological end-of-the-world cinema more generally, might allow for a renewal of the psychoanalysis of melancholia with Lacan; and further, through this conjunction, will ask whether speculative realism (at least in Brassier’s articulation through extinction) can be considered a Melancholic philosophy.\n\nThe speculative posthumanism (SP) developed in Posthuman Life consists of an austere epistemology (Anthropological Unbounded Humanism - AUP) on the one hand and an ontology of posthuman difference on the other (See Roden 2012; 2014,... more\n\nThe speculative posthumanism (SP) developed in Posthuman Life consists of an austere epistemology (Anthropological Unbounded Humanism - AUP) on the one hand and an ontology of posthuman difference on the other (See Roden 2012; 2014, Ch4-5). AUP I argue should be the core commitment of any posthumanism. It voids any posthumanist ethics/aesthetics, implying rather that we have a minimal grip on the space of possible minds or agents. However, this raises a problem 1) of intelligibility for the ontology of SP and 2) of interest. How can even negative claims about the posthuman possibility be intelligible; why should this epistemic/semantic void preoccupy or entice us?\n\nBoth questions can be reframed by considering how actual social/technological conditions imply the speculative field of the posthuman. “Philosophical Catastrophism” addresses this by reading key texts of contemporary posthumanism and inhumanism (including Crash, Videodrome and Nihil Unbound). I argue that the works of J G Ballard, R. Scott Bakker, Ray Brassier and David Cronenberg tell us something about the febrile affective relationship to technical systems which vastly exceed our capacity to understand them (Roden 2014, Ch7). These destabilising affects testify to their power to erase and re-write our worlds.\n\nThis paper explores the role of catastrophe in exemplary works by Ballard (Crash, “The Terminal Beach”) Brassier (Nihil Unbound) and Cronenberg (Videodrome), relating these to the themes of correlationism, realism and speculative posthumanism. It uses Ballard and Cronenberg’s ontological catastrophes as a foil for Brassier's interpretation of reason as contrary to life, favouring an interpretation of the will-to-knowledge as self-shattering rather than purely self-annulling. This aesthetic of violence, I claim, constitutes a tenuous but real relation to the inhuman void of the future.\n\nThere has been much recent discussion concerning the so-called problem of “correlationism.” According to the correlationist, thought and being are necessarily co-related.

On this view being cannot be thought of without positing it in relation to some form of subjective apprehension. This presupposition on the part of various contemporary philosophies has come under a considerable amount of criticism. Two of the most prominent critics of correlationism include Quentin Meillassoux and Ray Brassier. For both, the problem of correlationism stands in the way of a proper realism which is motivated in part by the epistemic priority of the empirical sciences. Meillassoux’s critique of correlationism is a critique of the kind of transcendental philosophies represented by Kant and Husserl. This construal of correlationism leads him to reject transcendental philosophy through his notion of ancestrality. Brassier, concerned with pushing the project of the Enlightenment to its nihilistic conclusion, also seeks to circumvent correlationism. However, unlike Meillassoux he resituates the role of the transcendental through a non-correlational account of extinction rather than dispense with transcendental philosophy en masse. For Brassier, the reality of extinction necessitates the move from a transcendental idealism to a transcendental realism, a move which is reinforced through his encounter with the work of Francois Laruelle.\n\nIn the concluding paragraph of What is Philosophy (1994), Deleuze and Guattari assert that, “Philosophy needs a non-philosophy that comprehends it; it needs a nonphilosophical comprehension just as art needs a non-art and science needs a... more\n\nIn the concluding paragraph of What is Philosophy (1994), Deleuze and Guattari assert that, “Philosophy needs a non-philosophy that comprehends it; it needs a nonphilosophical comprehension just as art needs a non-art and science needs a non-science” (1994, p. 218). Affixed to this assertion is a footnote gesturing toward Francois Laruelle's nonphilosophy: “Laruelle proposes a comprehension of nonphilosophy as the 'real of science,' beyond the object of knowledge...but,” write Deleuze and Guattari, “we do not see why this real of science is not non-science as well” (p. 234). The following paper will examine the “reactivation of the real” undertaken by Francois Laruelle, and more recently, by Ray Brassier. For these theorists, the real is conceived of as aphilosophical, yet scientifically apprehendable. In the following, I will attempt to address Deleuze and Guattari's query as to why the “real of science” constitutes, for Laruelle and Brassier, the nonphilosophical real, and the implications of this for philosophy.\n\nThis is the panel I hosted as part of the Society for European Philosophy September 2021 events.

The official link can be accessed through: https://societyforeuropeanphilosophy.com/2021/08/14/september-2021/\n\nPanel Overview:\n\nThe journey of nihilism in philosophy has undergone remarkable alternations beginning from its first detection in the 18th century as the corollary of idealism (Jacobi) to its determination as the degeneration of life (Nietzsche), and finally, to its recent positive reformulation as a strictly realist project for investigating the death of thinking and the non-correlational in-itself (Brassier). However, although the history of nihilism in philosophy presents to us an increasingly complex and heated picture, it has been a long time since the initial shock wave that it created in the idealist circles has disappeared, and it is debatable how much Nietzsche’s provocation to overcome nihilism is relevant today since it has gradually become a mere academic standard for political correctness and lost its status of an ambitious project as found in the examples of Heidegger and Deleuze. The realist appropriations of nihilism, on the other hand, presents an unexpectedly refreshing late rejoinder to nihilism’s initial idealist roots and a thought-provoking challenge to continental philosophy’s obsolescent anti-nihilism. Nevertheless, it needs more confrontation with topics as diverse as power, domination, state philosophy, violence, ressentiment, representation, patriarchy, life, birth, body, sexual difference, time, history, value, and meaning – topics that have undergone substantial transmutations through continental philosophy’s attacks on nihilism.\n\nIn this context, this panel brings together various perspectives on nihilism in order to rethink issues such as the overcoming of nihilism, its relationship with current power relations, its potentials for new intellectual discoveries, the possibility of its self-annihilation, and the contemporary import of its essential “uncanniness” that was characterised by Nietzsche as a visitor standing at the door.\n\nPapers will be precirculated.

Irrespective of the vast differences among its proponents, speculative realists effectuate this with an uncompromising defence of a radical realism. What they understand by realism is broadly the idea that transcendence or “in itself” cannot be reduced to a correlate of thinking. In this regard, the history of philosophy, from pre-Socratics to post-structuralism, is depicted either as an idealism that prioritizes thinking over being or as a correlationism that can do nothing but expand on Parmenides’s assertion that being and thinking are the same.\n\nI will challenge this standard reading of speculative realism and argue that what lies beneath the surface duality between idealism and realism is the deeper alternative between affirmation and negation. The fervent advocacy of the great outdoors by the speculative realists is a symptom of their taking side for negativity by introducing a new mode of nihilism into contemporary philosophy. This new nihilism should be considered as a continuation of the three stages of nihilism that Deleuze charts in Nietzsche and Philosophy (negative, reactive, and passive). After presenting an outline of the basic features of this fourth stage, I will conclude by offering a Deleuzian perspective that makes use of the discoveries of this new nihilism to rethink its project of the overcoming of nihilism."
