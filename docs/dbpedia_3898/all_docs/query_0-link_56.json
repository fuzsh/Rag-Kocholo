        "text": "A dizzying trip through the mind(s) of the provocative and influential thinker Nick Land.\n\nDuring the 1990s British philosopher Nick Land's unique work, variously described as ârabid nihilism,â âmad black deleuzianism,â and âcybergothic,â developed perhaps the only rigorous and culturally-engaged escape route out of the malaise of âcontinental philosophyâ âa route that was implacably blocked by the academy. However, Land's work has continued to exert an influence, both through the British âspeculative realistâ philosophers who studied with him, and through the many cultural producersâwriters, artists, musicians, filmmakersâwho have been invigorated by his uncompromising and abrasive philosophical vision.\n\nBeginning with Land's early radical rereadings of Heidegger, Nietzsche, Kant and Bataille, the volume collects together the papers, talks and articles of the mid-90sâlong the subject of rumour and vague legend (including some work which has never previously appeared in print)âin which Land developed his futuristic theory-fiction of cybercapitalism gone amok; and ends with his enigmatic later writings in which Ballardian fictions, poetics, cryptography, anthropology, grammatology and the occult are smeared into unrecognisable hybrids.\n\nFanged Noumena gives a dizzying perspective on the entire trajectory of this provocative and influential thinker's work, and has introduced his unique voice to a new generation of readers."
