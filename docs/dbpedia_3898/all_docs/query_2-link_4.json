        "text": "[NOTE: I finished this on the 30th of July, 2021. I only publish it now per the request of one of my friends. I will say that this analysis could have been better, but it was done two months ago, so whatever. The analysis of Kant may be primitve and crude, but I digress. If you have questions just, and I’ll try to answer them to the best of my ability. I could definitely write another (and probably better) response to Negarestani’s critiques, but if it is so, it is for another day.]\n\nThe Ambitions of this Essay\n\nFrom what I have read so far, Georges Bataille is a rather Hegelian thinker, but before I continue with the rest of this book, I must see if this is true. Of course, we have already looked at the Hegelian interpretation with Christopher M. Gemerchak in his book The Sunday of the Negative as well as with Jacques Derrida in his book Writing and Difference, but the specter of Kant seems to haunt them. In their groundbreaking thesis titled Influence and Infection: Georges Bataille and the Fate of Critique, Colin Dibben argues that it is actually a Kantian backdrop that Bataille must be read against, not a Hegelian one. And Dibben even explicitly rejects the Derridian interpretation of Bataille. Now, this isn’t the first time this has happened. In 1992, two years before Dibben wrote his thesis, Nick Land did the exact same thing in his book The Thirst for Annihilation. He suggests that one must read Bataille with Immanuel Kant in mind and not G. W. F. Hegel, which for Land is just an extension of Kant. Now, Plotnisky does a comparison of Kant and Bataille as well but it operates off his interpretation of the general economy which I fundamentally have to disagree with, and have written against multiple times (see above). In their thesis Aesthetics of Expenditure: Philosophy, Art, and the Infinite Faculty, Stephen Turpin actually does go over Bataille in relation to Kant, but we will not cover this (maybe for another time?). I think we will go over some more contemporary work too, like Amy Ireland’s Naught is More Real (though this may be the only contemporary work we go over) for example.\n\nIt must be noted that if Land and Dibben are right, lots of interpretations of Bataille will have to be thrown out, though we will still analyze them or already have.\n\nThe purpose of this essay is to do two things: 1. Go over those parts of The Thirst for Annihilation which I have not covered and have deemed important (that is pertaining to Bataille)*[1] and then 2. Look at Bataille’s relation to Kant. Now obviously 1 will lead into 2 and in fact, a lot of 2 will be in 1. So, we will go over all those areas which do not have to do with Kant in The Thirst for Annihilation which I have neglected, and then go over those parts about Kant which will then bridge into Dibben’s thesis, though we won’t go over Dibben’s thesis in too much detail, if really at all (for another time probably).\n\nIn fact, this essay is going to be much more about Bataille’s relation to Land, then Bataille’s relation to Kant. But, the fact of the matter is that Bataille’s relation to Land is also a relation to Kant.\n\nI do want to note that I will definitely go over parts of The Thirst for Annihilation again in the future, but this essay will have within it one of the most extensive inquiries into Land’s Bataillean thought.\n\nI hope to construct some sort of a pre-ontology, or a “metaphysics,” though we will be dealing with the impossible (which to some is purely non-exist, pure illusory non-reality; though, I would argue that the impossible is the real). This is to say, what I have not gone over in The Thirst for Annihilation maybe some of the most important of his words and implications in that “book”. Benjamin Noys scoffs at Land’s libidinal materialism, calling it a sort of libidinal ontology, and he says this as a critique. But, I have never completely understood why he does this… Noys should know better than most that what we are dealing with here is incommunicable. So, minor “contradictions” are not damning. If Land does construct a libidinal ontology, then we will add it to the storage room of concepts to be employed in this book. I must address these latter words of mine here though. This book of course has, so far, required lots of work, lots of sleepless nights, and of course, did I not just mention accumulation (of concepts)? Is this not all a contradiction with what Bataille puts forward? No. It is in the very fact that Bataille puts something (“theory”) forward that we are analogous to him. Does what I have just said not reflect his similar words from the first volume of The Accursed Share?\n\nSo, let’s begin.\n\nA Note on The Thirst for Annihilation\n\nI remember when I first pulled up a PDF copy of The Thirst for Annihilation. I was fifteen years old, in my dark room, with the computer screen being the only source of light near me. There was this kind of forbidden, transgressive, and just ultimately dark “aurora” or rather atmosphere surrounding this book to my fifteen year old self. This was the first book that was taboo from my perspective. This was the first book that made me feel something.\n\nLibidinal Energetics\n\nThe suggestion is always that ‘at least this is better than nothing’, a slogan that some Leibnizian demon has probably scrawled above the gates of Hell (not that I have any argument with Hell).\n\n— Nick Land, The Thirst for Annihilation[2]\n\nWith the concept of entropy everything changes.\n\n— Nick Land, The Thirst for Annihilation[3]\n\nEntropy is at the basis of systems which work in respect to the random distribution of those entities which are within these systems. Land says, “Disorder always increases in a closed system (such as the universe), because nature is indifferent to her composition”.[4] Entropy becomes important here because it means that natural processes are, according to Land, “no longer eternal clockwork machines, they are either extinct (Wärmetod) or tendential” [emphasis mine].[5] When Land says this he does not mean that natural processes are no longer clockwork machines, they most definitely are because they have mechanisms and a motor. Rather, he means that natural processes aren’t eternal, that is, not able to cease. Wärmetod translated from German to English means ‘heat death’ and of course Land is thus invoking the heat death of the universe, this is what he means when he speaks of extinction. When he talks of natural processes as tendential clockwork machines, he is referring back to disorder and entropy. This is because the tendency of closed systems is towards increasing disorder. Entropy is just how we measure the extent of disorder of a closed system. But because disorder is always increasing, the tendency of natural processes is the tendency of the entropy of a closed system to increase. By nature, Land just means it in the conventional sense, I assume. This is to say, nature is that which is within the closed system that is the universe, it is those distributed elements of a closed system we talked about just a moment ago. This is why nature is indifferent to the closed system it is within: the closed system works in respect to those distributed elements, not the other way around. When Land speaks of natural processes, what does he mean? A natural process is obviously a process that occurs in nature, which we have just defined. But what process is taking place? The process that is a natural process, in the thermodynamic sense, is a transfer (think of heat transfer) between objects which causes the entropy of the closed system, which it took place in, to increase. Think of a hot object and a cold object. The natural process is that heat transfer from the hot object to the cold object which increases the entropy of the system because there is now more disorder due to the fact the cold object is no longer cold but it is now warm. Natural processes are notably irreversible.\n\nNow that we have gone over what it means for natural processes to be extinct as well as tendential, let’s go over why his usage of ‘clockwork machines’ is important. The term ‘clockwork’ refers to the internal workings of clocks, which are (mechanical) machines, as Land notes. The internals of a clock, clockwork, are a series of mechanisms (springs, gears, etc.), but these mechanisms are powered by a motor, the motor of clockwork. This is what Land means when he says, “Mechanisms are subordinated to motors; to thermic difference, energy flux, reservoir, and sump”.[6] A ‘sump’ is a tank within an engine (motor) which is essentially, as Land said, a reservoir of oil which is to be used to lubricate the engine. Thermic difference is the expression of energy flux in the form of heat, this is just the tendency towards increased disorder, towards increased entropy, within the motor.\n\nLand speaks of order as not natural but rather unnatural in that it doesn’t tend towards thermal equilibrium, like natural processes do (disorder is natural), it is in this way that order is disequilibrium. “Order is an evanescent chance”.[7] This is to say, order is something which comes from disorder (chance) but it is soon to dissipate, that is, collapse back into disorder.\n\nThen there is “negative disorder” which is “negentropy” (negative entropy).[8] Negentropy is the energetic resource which fills the sump of the motor. Chance is “the potentiation of the power supply,” which is to say, chance is the increase of effectiveness of the power supply. Negative entropy happens in more restricted areas, that is, the general universe is entropic, the restricted Earth and its compositions of life are negentropic.\n\nPower (macht in German; puissance in French) is the “potential for the degradation of energy,” this degradation of energy is analogous to the “fludification of matter/energy”.[9] So we have negative entropy and entropy, “[u]pstream and downstream; the reserve and its dissipation”.[10] The motor is entropy and it is fuelled by negentropy. Order too is power because order is essentially a negentropy which is soon depleted. Power is differentiation.\n\nWhat I have described so far in this section of this essay is what Land calls “[t]he mega-motor”.[11] What we have also just described is that “dehumanization of nature, involving the uttermost impersonalism in the explanation of natural forces” which Land speaks of at the beginning of the book.[12]\n\nLand then speaks of his libidinal materialism. Land defines libidinal materialism as “the theory of unconditional (non-teleological) desire”.[13] Libidinal materialism contra physicalism is the name of the game for Land (all other metaphysics like idealism have already been discarded by Land). Land’s issue with physicalism is that it is implicitly theological. It is theological because of the fact that its description of the universe requires a prima causa, which must be God(?). Physicalists argue against Land’s critique of them by arguing that “[physical] matter receives its impulsion or determination from without,” that is, without God.[14] The physicalist will continue to argue that all intrinsic processes are just the result of expressions of the laws of nature (Land notes that decay is an example of intrinsic process), and all extrinsic processes are the results from some “original cosmic fatality,” which could be thought of as, I’m assuming Land means this, the Big bang.[15] For Land, physical matter is then “unambiguously passive, exhausted by the dual characteristics of transmitting alien forces and decaying according to the universally legislated exigencies of its composition”.[16] Thus, the physicalist schema doesn’t escape its theological roots.\n\nFor Land, scientific materialism, that is, physicalism, can not even begin to make metaphysical assertions, and thus cannot even begin itself, because it is a metaphysic. Scientific materialism cannot make assertions because “it has not registered the distance between its representational object and the real matter/energy matrix, insofar as such materiality is irreducible in principle to the form of the concept”.[17] This is to say, scientific materialism hasn’t recognized the difference (distance) between physical matter (its representational object) and base/libidinal matter (the real matter/energy matrix), this difference being the fact that base matter which is formless, cannot be reduced to the form of the concept. This begs the question though. What is base/libidinal matter?\n\nLand defines libidinal matter as “that which resists a relation of reciprocal transcendence against time, and departs from the rigorous passivity of physical substance without recourse to dualistic, idealistic, or theistic conceptuality. It implies a process of mutation which is simultaneously devoid of agency and irreducible to the causal chain. This process [of mutation] has been designated in many ways. I shall follow Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Freud in provisionally entitling it ‘drive’ (Trieb)”.[18] Let’s break this down.\n\nFirst, libidinal matter is that which resists a relation of reciprocal transcendence against time. What does this mean? The relation of transcendence to time is one of permutation, that is to say, is one of “ascending and descending H-values,” which is the transformation of H-values (H-values are analogous to negentropies).[19] Time, which is a grid, must have transcendence, negentropy, pushed against it in order to make possible certain levels of permutation. So, necessarily, libidinal matter resists this. Libidinal matter is purely outside the relation between time and negentropy because of the fact libidinal matter is “chaos” where “order = 0”.[20] It resists the reduction to any probable H-value, even improbable H-values are probable. It resists the reduction to H-values because it is entropic, not negentropic. “Energetic matter has a tendency, a Todestrieb”.[21] This tendency is entropy.\n\nNext, libidinal matter is not like physical matter in that it is not passive, that it is without intrinsic and extrinsic processes. This is because libidinal matter is not created (thus it has no extrinsic processes) and is prior to the laws of nature (thus it has no intrinsic processes). Libidinal matter is active and atheological unlike the physical matter and its theological passivity. The reasons for these latter two facts will be revealed in a moment.\n\nLastly, libidinal matter is divorced from agency and causality. The importance of this will be revealed in a moment.\n\nThe reason libidinal matter is not created, prior to the laws of nature, divorced from agency and causality is all the same: drive.\n\nBefore I explain drive, let us go look at Schopenhauer. Schopenhauer effectively translated Kant’s noumenon into will. Bataille translates noumenon or will into unconscious drive, that is, into increate matter, that is, matter which is not created. Land says, “Increate matter is a translation of will or noumenon; a designation for the anti-ontology basic to any positively atheistic materialism”.[22] What we are opposing here is matter as ens creatum, as being created. Land says, “Matter as ens creatum is essentially lawful, whilst increate matter is anarchic, even to the extent of evading the adoption of an essence”.[23] For Schopenhauer, will is no longer intentional action which arises with the phenomenological subject (think of Husserl’s idea of intention here), will is not volitional willing which is representational. Rather, will is completely a “pre-representational (‘blind’) impulse”.[24] Unconscious drive, that is, increate libidinal matter is too pre-representational and an energetic impulse. Specifically, it is an entropic tendential drive towards Wärmetod, that is to say, towards heat death.\n\nSo let’s go deeper into this concept of ‘drive’. Land says, “Drive is that which explains, rather than, presupposing, the cause/effect couple of classical physics”.[25] The cause leads to the effect. Land says, “[Drive] is the dynamic instituting of effectiveness”.[26] Drive institutes effect, it does not presuppose it. Due to the fact that drive institutes effect, drive “is thus proto-physical”.[27] But what does ‘proto-physical’ mean?\n\nFirstly, we must understand what we are undertaking when we try to answer this posed question. Land sees all other metaphysics such as idealism and dialectical materialism as something to be discarded, and only sees a potential for an atheological materialism in “the ashes of physicalism”.[28] This means that when Land speaks of the proto-physical, we must recognize that he is saying this in contrast to physicalism, not another metaphysic like idealism. This recognition allows us to understand that proto-physical is necessarily proto-existential because the physicalist sees everything which is as physical. So, when Land says that drive is proto-physical, he means that it is proto-existential. Thus, when Land says, “libidinal energy is chaotic, or pre-ontological,” we know he is also saying that libidinal matter is pre-ontological because of the fact the matrix of libidinal matter isn’t just a matrix of matter, but a matrix of matter/energy.[29] Thus, because Land says, “[T]he process of [the] mutation [of libidinal matter] … is simultaneously devoid of agency and irreducible to the causal chain … This process … [is] ‘drive’ (Trieb),” we can say definitively that drive is proto-physical, that is, proto-existential, that is, pre-ontological.[30] Because the prefix ‘proto-’ can mean ‘before,’ we are not wrong to analogize the proto-physical, the proto-existential and the pre-ontological because proto- and pre- both can mean ‘before’. Lastly, let us note that drive is irreducible to causality, that is, drive is not and cannot be caused. But this leads us to a question which troubles us: If drive is both proto-existential and uncaused, is drive not just non-existent hogwash? This is what we must answer. We must answer the question of how can something, which is not a thing (because it never is), be the thing which “causes” or rather institutes existence? If we are able to successfully answer this question, we will have done nothing less than prove Land and Bataille’s solar cosmology of desire, we will have done nothing less than prove general economics at the highest level of philosophical speculation, that is, the level of the proto-existential. We must answer Leibniz’s classic question: “Why is there something rather than nothing?”.\n\nTo answer this question, to “prove” drive, we are to employ the neo-Leibnizian theories of Nicholas Rescher and their intensely thought-provoking book On Explaining Existence.\n\nFirstly, we must address the skeptics who do not dare to ask the “silly” questions. I have the utmost respect for these skeptics, because in a way I am one of these skeptics. The “silly” question that is actually quite serious that the skeptic will ask is “what is existence?”. Now, obviously one cannot answer this question because one would have to refer to something which exists, making the answer circular (Neither I nor Bataille take issue with circular reasoning). But, existence is presupposed in the skeptics question. “How?” you ask. It is quite simple. When the skeptic says ‘is’ within the question of “what is existence,” do they not therefore presuppose existence in that existence is that which is, that is to say, does the skeptic not presuppose existence due to the fact that they clearly understand what it means to be (their understanding of the concept of being is demonstrated when they use the word ‘is’)? The answer is yes. So, it is not useful to ask the question of “what is existence?,” “what is Being?” (in the Heideggerian sense), as a form of skeptical rebuttal. A question which is more useful to us now is “how did things come to be? Why does existence exist (as it does)?”.\n\nSecondly, we must depart with causality. Existence cannot be caused by an existing thing, as that would presuppose existence due to the fact that the thing causing existence is existent. We cannot postulate anything which is as the cause of existence, because existence is everything that is. We must therefore look towards the proto-existential (in the case of physicalism, the proto-physical) to explain the instituting of existence. “A hylarchic principle … [is a principle] whose range of operation is critically the (proto-existential) sphere of what is possible but (as yet) nonexistent”.[31] We will therefore have to approach this question by way of some hylarchic principle. “Accordingly, the idea of a hylarchic principle that grounds the existence of things not in preexisting things but rather in a functional principle of some sort — a specifically nonsubstantival state of affairs — becomes something that one has to entertain”.[32] Thus, our approach to answering the question will be a nomic naturalist one, which is to say, the approach that sees existence as extracted from mere possibility by a “lawful hylarchic process”.[33] If existence is to be extracted from possibility, we must understand the fact that “[t]he manifold of possibility requires no originative explanation. These possibilities are not somehow engendered: they are simply there”.[34] Thus, we still have no presuppositions when it comes to the existent, that is, that which exists.\n\nThe manifold of possibility consists of the manifold of mere possibility and the manifold of real possibility. The manifold of mere possibility comprises “all possibilities [that] can coherently be articulated on logico-conceptual principles,” and the manifold of real possibility comprises “the pre (sub, or proto-)existential possibilities that subsist independently of the mental operations of existing beings”.[36] As we can see proto-physical possibility is the first region within the manifold of real possibility, which is why Land probably started there. Now, this answers the question of “why does the manifold of possibility not require a cause or an origin?”. I will explicitly state the answer: these possibilities do not have “existential status”.[37]\n\nNow that we have demonstrated that we so far have no presuppositions in relation to the existential, let us move forward. Rescher then suggests we take a look at the compatibility theory of possibility. The compatibility theory of possibility is quite simple. Rescher gives two examples: “[M]ere logical possibility is a matter of compatibility with the laws of logic, and physical possibility is a matter of compatibility with the laws of nature”.[28] Rescher then gives a nomic structure of the manifold of possibility.\n\nRescher’s explanation allows us to confirm Land’s claim that “[the proto-physical law, the proto-physical dynamic, that ‘drive’ is, is in advance of natural law,” because of the fact that proto-physical possibility precedes physical possibility.[40]\n\nLet us now get back to our main question: “[H]ow might the existence of things possibly arise through the operation of laws and principles that function wholly outside the existential arena?”.[41]\n\nRescher suggests that “the move from mere possibility to actual existence is mediated by a series of hylarchic principles … that provide for ever more stringent existential requirements”.[42] Hylarchic principles “set the possibility-restricting conditions that ultimately narrow the range of eligible cases down to a single outcome … Independently of, and, as it were, ‘prior’ to the origination of existents there can be (and presumably is) a nomically qualified framework of possibility-delimiting laws that set the conditions, the ‘rules of the game’ as it were, within which the actualization of things comes to pass”.[43] Let’s stop here for a moment. What would a hylarchic principle of drive, that is, a proto-physical law of drive look like? With our understanding of hylarchic principles that we have gained thus far, it could be described as follows. The proto-physical law of drive is the only proto-physical law of the existent, the only hylarchic principle of existence. It makes the rule of the game only one movement: the thirst for annihilation. Thus, entropy is established (as a natural process), the permutation of energy is established as a necessity, Bataille’s cosmology is established, Land’s libidinal energetics is established. But, let’s not get too hasty now. We must first develop our understanding of hylarchic principles before we can know if it is possible or not to describe a proto-physical law as we just did.\n\nProto-physical laws “should be understood as laying down conditions of real possibility, ruling certain theoretical (logical) possibilities outside the realm of realizability. They ‘precede’ nature and delineate among all the abstractly available possibilities certain ones as alone ‘real,’ ruling out the rest as unreal, remote, merely hypothetical or the like”.[44] So far, we don’t have to reformulate our already lined out proto-physical law of drive. We can have our proto-physical law of drive to make it a fact that the only reality, the only truth, is death. Thus, things must be in excess in order to exist. The proto-physical law of drive is the proto-existential law of the Sun. This is why we are all effects of the Sun. We are all solar rays which are what drive is. This is to say, “[d]rives are the irruptive dynamics of matter in advance of natural law”.[45] Drives are those solar rays that propel us. Thus “the source of the ‘decisive external influences’ that propel the mazings of life” is the Sun.[46]\n\n“Proto-laws are … the preconditions to which something must conform if it is to become an existent at all”.[47] The precondition for the existence of a thing is that it must be animated by the drives. This is where entropy and the thirst for annihilation are grounded. But what about negentropy? We will answer that question later on in this essay.\n\nNow, you may ask what thing are these proto-laws grounded in? The answer is surprisingly Bataillean considering we are making a deal with a (neo-)Leibnizian devil, Nicholas Rescher. These proto-laws, nomic principles, proto-physical laws, hylarchic principles, etc. are grounded in NOTHING; “[t]hese nomic principles that define the problems of the real of the possible need not have an existential footing — an ontological basis in some preexisting thing or collection of things”.[48] In fact, these proto-laws rest upon a radical refusal, a silence of non-compliance, contestation; “[t]his idea of a domain of ‘proto-laws’ rests on a firm refusal to locate the ground of the distinction between ‘mere’ and ‘real’ possibilities in the nature or the activities of things or existents of some sort”.[49] Proto-laws have “an ontological footing that is … ‘priori’ to … existing things,” which is to say they are pre-ontological, they are grounded upon NOTHING, chaos embodied.[50] “Such principles can and should be thought of as lacking a substantial basis”.[51]\n\nThus, this is the schema: We have the realm of possibility and the realm of existence, and what mediates the two realms is hylarchic law(s). If something which is possible doesn’t fall in accordance with the hylarchic law(s), then it stays stuck in the realm of mere possibility, whereas if something which is possible does fall in accordance with the hylarchic law(s), then it enters into the realm of real possibility. For example, if my hylarchic law is “for something to exist, it must tend towards dissolution,” then all possible things which do not tend towards dissolution stay within the realm of mere possibility, and thus cannot have real potential towards existential actualization. But, this also means that all possible things that do tend towards dissolution go from the realm of mere possibility into the realm of real possibility, and thus can have real potential towards existential actualization.\n\nIncreate matter finds its anarchic contestation of ens creatum personified in Rischer’s statement that “[e]xplaining the nature of existence via hylarchic principles of prot-law … is predicated on acknowledging that explanation in the case of existence-at-large cannot operate in the orthodox order of the efficient causation of preexisting things. In resorting to a hylarchic principle one can thus abandon altogether the hoary dogma that things can only come from things”.[52]\n\nRischer’s latent Batailleanism is exemplified in his statement that “the realm of mere possibility, as such, is a sphere of nonexistence in which no thing whatever exists”.[53] The pre-ontological chaos that Land speaks of is outside the world of things, it is analogous to continuity in this sense. This pre-ontological chaos is the realm of mere possibility, but more on this in a moment.\n\nNow, the importance of the divorce of agency and libidinal matter is this: we are constructing a materialist theory of desire, a libidinal energetics. Necessarily, we are talking about what the subject (unwillingly) moves toward, (non-volitionally) wills toward, (non-intentionally) desires. The importance is found in the fact that this confirms that libidinal materialism follows two more (this is three out of four but the fact that libidinal materialism displays the fourth is proven by the fact that Land isn’t looking to be liked) of the specifics of the one simple criterion of taste in philosophy: “2 Ruthless fatalism. No space for decisions, responsibilities, actions, intentions. Any appeal to notions of human freedom discredits a philosopher beyond amelioration. 3 Hence absence of all moralizing, even the crispest, most Aristotelian. The penchant for correction, let alone vengefulness, pins one in the shallows. 4 Contempt for common evaluations; one should even take care to avoid straying accidentally into the right. Even to be an enemy is too comforting; one must be an alien, a beast. Nothing is more absurd than a philosopher seeking to be liked”.[54]\n\nLibidinal energetics, Land’s materialist theory of desire, is then lined out by Land:\n\n“1 Chance. Entropy is the core of a probabilistic engine, the absence of law as an automatic drive. The compositions of energy are not determinations but differentiations, since all order flows from improbability. Thus a revolution in the conception of identities, now derived from chance as a function of differentiation, hence quantitative, non-absolute, impermanent. Energy pours downstream automatically, ‘guided’ only by chance, and this is even what ‘work’ now means (freed from its Hegelian pathos), a function of play, unbinding, becoming”.[55] When looking at the motor of the natural clock, we see that it is entropy, an automatic drive. The general probability that is the totality (the universe), that is equilibrium, has at its core entropy. Let’s think of it as an engine. Of course it is a probabilistic engine because we are talking about the universe which is of general probability. If the absence of law is power. Macht, puissance, power is what fuels the probabilistic engine of chance. Order flows from the improbability, that is, from improbable negentropies, and thus compositions, which are ordered, are differentiated from the rest of the universe which is entropic (and is therefore completely probable?). Identity isn’t the first law of logic anymore. Identity is still a function of differentiation, but it is now a derivative of chance. It is no longer qualitative, but quantitative. It is no longer that absolute logical law of existence. It is no longer permanent. Energy pours downstream automatically, this is the entropic mega-motor of libidinal matter going towards heat-death. Libidinal matter is the will-to-chance. Death rolls the dice, agency is lost, and the subject becomes the subject of chance which is not at all a subject but instead NOTHING.\n\nChance “has no essence outside its instantiation … Chance is not some kind of infra-, supra-, or ur-being, and here is no sense at all in which it surreptitiously ‘is’”.[56]\n\n“2 Tendency. The movement from the improbable to the probable is an automatic directionality; an impulsion. Entropy is not a telos, since it is not represented, intentionally motivating, or determinate. It nevertheless allows power, tension, and drive to be grasped as uni-directional, quantitative, and irresistible forces. Teleological schemes are no longer necessary to the understanding of tendential processes, and it is no longer necessary to be patient with them, they are superfluous”.[57]\n\nThe movement from the improbable to the probable is what Boltzmann and his cosmology tried to describe and demonstrate. The improbable is high H-values and the probable is low H-values. Thus, the automatic drive, the tendency from the improbable to the probable is nothing more than that entropic tendency towards extinction, towards the heat death of the universe. Entropy is a-teleological because it is of chance. It is not volitional, or determined (it is without theological determination that is determination without God, unlike physical matter). Power and its flows flow throughout the engine that is the mega-motor of desire. Power, tension, and drive appear to be unidirectional, though they aren’t. They aren’t because tendential processes aren’t teleological schemes. Telos is superfluous.\n\n“3 Energy. Everywhere only a quantitative vocabulary. Fresh-air after two millennia of asphyxiating ontologies. Essences dissolve into impermanent configurations of energy. ‘Being’ is indistinguishable from its effectiveness as the unconscious motor of temporalization, permutational dynamism. The nature of the intelligible cosmos is energetic improbability, a differentiation from entropy”.[58]\n\nWith the (law of) identity gone, that is qualitative description gone, ontology breaks down. Essences dissolve into libidinal energy which is pre-ontological. Essence is no longer prior to existence. Rather, only the realm of possibility stands behind existence. Being, ontology’s object of study, just becomes the unconscious motor of time, allowing for cosmological permutations, transformations of H-value, to necessarily become dynamic because “when t [time] = ∞ any possible H-value becomes probable”.[59] The cosmos is only intelligible when it is negentropically ordered, that is, improbable. This is why an intelligible cosmos is a differentiation from entropy. The implication of this is that the cosmos, the universe, is formless.\n\n“4 Information. The laborious pieties of the Geisteswissenschaften, signs, thoughts, ideologies, cultures, dreams, all of these suddenly intelligible as natural forces, as negentropies. A whole series of pseudo-problems positively collapsed. What is the relation between mind and body? Is language natural or conventional? How does an idea correspond to an object? What articulates passion with conception? All signals are negentropies and negentropy is an energetic tendency”.[60]\n\nWhen Land speaks of information, it is clear that he is talking about information theory. Entropy is used by information theory “to describe ‘information uncertainty’ or ‘potential information’”.[61] This potential information is “the set of possible signals from which a specific signal is selected”.[62] A signal is something that provides information about something. In information theory, signals with ‘log a’ are equated with maximum entropy of a signal. Land notes, “If base 2 logarithms are use the units of information are bits,” and then give us an example, “in a system with four elements, such as a genetic code, any one of four possible signals or events is hypothetically possible at any given position in ht message sequence, so that in a state of maximum uncertainty each signal would have an information value [base 2] log 4, which is equal to 2 bits”.[63] Thus, base 2 log 2 is equal to a bit, base 2 log 4 is equal to 2 bits, and base 2 log 8 is equal to 3 bits. In information theory, the amount of potential information increases as entropy increases. Negentropy then is the opposite of potential information but is already stored information. If signals are negentropy then that means all information is negentropy. Thus, knowledge (information) is only maintained in an ordered state (this ordered state is composition). Nonknowledge is thus with entropy?\n\n“The thermospasm is reality as undilute chaos. It is where we all came from. The death-drive is longing to return there (‘it’ itself), just as salmon would return upstream to perish at the origin. Thermospasm is howl, annihilating intensity, a peak of improbability. Energetic matter has a tendency, a Todestrieb. The current scientific sense of this movement is a perpetual degradation of energy or dissipation of difference. Upstream is the reservoir of negentropy, uneven distribution, thermic disequilibrium. Downstream is Tohu Bohu, statistical disorder, indifference, Wämetod. The second law of thermodynamics tells us that disorder must increase, that regional increases in negentropy still imply an aggregate increase in negentropy still imply an aggregate increase in entropy. Life is able to deviate from death only because it also propagates it, and the propagation of disorder is always more successful than the deviation. Degradation ‘profits’ out of life. Any process of organization is necessarily aberrational within the general economy, a mere complexity or detour in the inexorable death-flow, a current in the information motor, energy cascading downstream, dissipation. There are no closed systems, no stable does, no recuperable origins. There is only thermospasmic shock wave, tendential energy flux, degradation of energy. A receipt of information — of intensity — carried downstream”.[64]\n\nThe thermospasm is the origin of life. The thermospasm is the composition of chaos. The death-drive wants to return to the thermospasm. Thus, “[e]nergetic matter has a tendency, a Todestrieb”.[65] Compositions all head towards violent decomposition. They head back towards chaos. Upstream and downstream. Negentropy and entropy. God’s light and Tohu Bohu.\n\nBecause of the fact that on an aggregate level, negentropy still leads to an increase in entropy, life (negentropic compositions) leads to an “increase,” a propagation, of death (Wärmetod; entropic chaos).\n\nAll composition is just a deviation from chaos, from the inexorable death-flow. Compositions begin to decompose and soon order = 0.\n\nWhen Land says, “There are no closed systems,” he does not mean this in the traditional thermodynamic sense per se. What he means is that there are not multiple closed systems, there is just general economy.[66] This is to say, negentropy, composition, order, etc. is no longer, there is only entropy, chaos, disorder, etc. There is no longer restricted economy, there is only general economy.\n\nInformation (knowledge) breaks down as it heads towards its limit. When knowledge breaks past its own limits, it becomes non-knowledge.\n\nWhat we have just gone over is Land’s libidinal materialism, as he explicitly stated that he was following Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Freud in calling the permutation of libidinal matter ‘drive’. So, let us now go over the more Nietzschean side of libidinal materialism.\n\nLand makes the important note that libidinal materialism is not (another theory of) thermodynamics. The difference between libidinal materialism and thermodynamics is found in multiple areas. First, libidinal materialism doesn’t differentiate power and negentropy from energy. Second, “[i]t no longer conceives the level of entropy as a predicate of any substantial or subsistent being”.[67] This is to say, libidinal materialism doesn’t see that entropy is dependent on existent things because entropy is engendered by our proto-physical law of the drives. Third, “libidinal energy is chaotic, or pre-ontological”.[68] Thermodynamics sees energy as an exclusively ontological thing, but “libidinal materialism accepts only chaos and composition”.[69]\n\nGetting more Nietzschean, libidinal materialism sees “‘Being’ as an effect of the composition of chaos”.[70] Being is composition. To be is to be composed. Land recognizes that Bataille rejected the will-to-power and the overman, but he notes that Bataille didn’t reject eternal recurrence. So, Land lines out “[eternal] recurrence as a theory of energetic forces and their permutation; chance, tendency, energy and information”.[71] Eternal recurrence as a libidinal energetics sees “[i]n the play of anarchic combinations and redistributions forces tend to the exhaustion of their reserve of possible states, inclining to the circle, a figure of affirmation and intoxication, as well as a teaching, message, or signal”.[72] Chance is found in the play of anarchic forces, and tendency is found in the anarchic forces’ tendency towards the exhaustion of their reserve of energy (possibile states), and thus we have also just found chance, tendency, and energy in eternal recurrence, but what about information? Information is found in the fact that signals are found in the inclination of the circle of recurrence.\n\nEternal recurrence is “stretched between a thermodynamic baseline (Boltzmann’s theory of eternal recurrence) and a libidinal summit”.[73] We have just covered the baseline, so, what about the summit? The libidinal summit, the libidinal peak, evokes Bataille’s idea of the summit-decline model found in On Nietzsche. Looking at the libidinal energetics of eternal recurrence in this way, one goes towards thermospasm, “through compositional strata,” and attempts to reach the libidinal summit, the impossible.[74] Summit implies decline and vice versa, thus making eternal recurrence eternal.\n\nThe other notable thing Land takes from Nietzsche in blindly constructing libidinal energetics/materialism is a general theory of compositions, “a general of hierarchies”.[75] The implications of the general theory of compositions are wild. Necessarily, because compositions are predicated on something that is pre-ontological rather than something that is exclusively pre-phenomenological, “[t]here are no longer any transcendental limits … Kant is defeated, as transcendental/empirical difference is collapsed into the scales” [emphasis mine].[76] The mentioning of the scales is important because it helps us realize that because there are no privileged scales, there is no transcendental limit.\n\nThen looking at Freud as an energeticist, Land notes that Freud conceives of desire as “dissipative energetic flow”.[77] Desire is not lack because it doesn’t lack subject or object because drive aimates the dynamics of both subject and object. Now, Land’s exposition of Freud here could be seen as what Bataille was talking about when he spoke of ‘raw phenomena’ in his essay Materialism.\n\nChaos, is in a way, that realm of possibility. Rescher even notes that the realm of possibility, being a realm of nonexistence, can have structure, that is, composition.\n\nNow we finally have reached Bataille’s contribution to Land’s libidinal energetics.\n\nIt is to be recognized that life in a way has a negentropy. Schrödinger speaks of living matter as “feeding” on negentropy. Land says, “It is because the second law of thermodynamics proclaims that entropy always increases in a closed system that life is only able to augment order locally, within an open system from which disorder can be ‘exported’. Land argues that thermodynamics presupposes the space in which the localization that is life increases the amount of order (negentropy) takes place. Land argues that thermodynamics implicitly conceives of this space “as homogeneous extension, extrinsic to the distributions which occupy it”.[78] I asked earlier the question of “what is negentropy grounded in?”. We were able to deduce that entropy is grounded in the proto-physical and hylarchic principle of the drives. But it seems that negentropy is just presupposed. Bataille doesn’t have these presuppositions though because he “thinks space (rather than assuming it)”.[79]\n\nLand wants us to look at the issue “of theorizing the relation between the closed field of cosmic energy reservoir (0), and the local pool of non-equilibrium economy, open to exchange”.[80] Land then poses the idea of analogizing ‘general’ and ‘restricted’ economy to ‘closed’ and ‘open’ systems respectively. He says that this analogization isn’t “wholly inappropriate, but it simplifies the situation excessively”.[81]\n\nLand speaks of the fact that utility presupposes negentropy, and this allows us to answer the question of “what is negentropy grounded in?”. The answer is composition. It is in this way that negentropy is like restricted economy. Both aren’t necessarily “real” in the sense that general economy is real.\n\nLastly, we are to look at the libidinal energetics contained within solar economics.\n\nThe libidinal main-sequence is just restricted economy and its history. Life is an effect of the libidinal main-sequence in the sense that composition composes itself when it assumes the restricted economic perspective, that is to say, when one is not in the face of a truly cosmic horror. “The main-sequence is a burning cycle … a complexification of the energy-cycle, or, more generally, as a dilation of the solar-economic circuits that compose organic matter, knitting it into a fabric that includes an ever-increasing proportion of the (‘inorganic’) energetic and geo-chemical planetary infrastructure”.[82]\n\n“[O]rganic matter is only a name for that fragment of inorganic material that has been woven into meta-stable regional compositions”.[83]\n\nWhen a fragment of inorganic material enters into the main-sequence, two tendencies become differentiated: 1. Immanence and 2. Transcendence. This differentiation is how organic libido arises. What is essentially differentiated is “two groups of drives” or two tendencies of drives.[84] There is a tendency of transcendence, and Land calls this a progressive tendency, which cause the organism to become individuated through a multifaceted process which consists of “nucleation (prokaryotes to eukaryotes), and then through the isolation of the german line, dividing the protoplasm into ‘generative cells’ and ‘somatic cells’”.[85] This group/tendency of the drives is “the archaic form of Freud’s Eros” and it also entails the developments (e.g., “a tension between soma and generation” and “a conservation of dissipative forces within an economy of the species”) leading to sexuality.[86] It is precisely in this tendential movement of Eros, “this erotic or speciating tendency,” that Eros becomes “perpetually endangered by a regressive tendency that leads to dissolution”.[87] This regressive tendency towards dissolution is Thanatos. It is also interesting to note that one could make the logic of base materialism that Noys speaks of into a hlyarchic principle which something must adhere to in order to exist. Thus, base materialism would become a part of Bataille’s cosmology.\n\nOn Noys’s Critique of Libidinal Materialism\n\nIn his essay Georges Bataille’s base materialism, Benjamin Noys wrote one of the only critiques of Land’s libidinal materialism. I used to think this was a good critique. The counter-critiques I found were weak. But this isn’t that good of a critique.\n\nNoys makes a non-argument against Land when he argues that “Land transforms [base materialism] into the relative stability of libidinal materialism”.[88] The reason I call this a non-argument is because of the fact that the premise for Noys’s latter conclusions is that Land, “in forcing base matter into existence as libidinal materialism … can only witness its disappearance as a force of disruption”.[89] Now, the premise for this is that Land is limiting base materialism by “making it into” libidinal materialism. And this is limiting because, according to Noys, Land hasn’t evaded ontology and has “instead reconstituted base materialism as an anti-philosophical libidinal ontology”.[90] Now, as we know, libidinal materialism is a theory of desire which is necessarily proto-physical. It cannot be ontological because the drives are proto-physical, that is, proto-existential.\n\nNoys’s final critique is that “Land does not explain how we are supposed to get difference out of the undifferentiated”.[91] And the answer is that logically we aren’t, but is base matter not non-logical difference?\n\nOn Victor J. Vitanza’s Reading of Bataille and Land\n\nIn their book Negation, Subjectivity, and the History of Rhetoric, Victoria J. Vitanza becomes one of the few people to write “extensively” (I feel that to write extensively on Nick Land’s Bataillean phase, one need not write much at all) on Nick Land’s Bataillean period. He also has some interesting commentary on Bataille, so before we get to Kant, which I’m sure you are dying to get to. Let us go through this, just don’t die on the way…\n\nLet’s start with his coverage of Nick Land first I guess. But wait, before I do I must really note that this book’s understanding of Bataille is largely in the context of Land. We can see this latter claim to be a fact when he speaks of the Sun as libidinal energy, or talks of thermospasm, etc.\n\nKeep in mind that this book was written in 1996. This is important because Land still lectured at the University of Warwick at this time (he resigned in 1998). So, this means that Land wasn’t completely outside of academia yet, and thus he probably still was respected theoretically, or at least, much more so than after he was expelled from the academy.\n\nWhen first addressing solely Nick Land, Vitanza says, “Of all the commentators on this topos [God] of out the impossible curns the possible, Nick Land is the most brilliant and yet troubling. He is brilliant by ill-virtue of his intrepid resistance to academic style … he is troubling because he writes byway of the word ‘annihilation’ and the word ‘negative’”.[92]\n\nVitanza does sort of critique Land. But it isn’t deconstructive, that is, a critique which only seeks to disprove that which it is critiquing completely, or at least to the highest extent that it can. Instead, Vitanza does a constructive critique of Land. A constructive critique seeks to build upon that layer of bricks below it, it seeks to fix the cracks of a brick so both builders (theorists; Vitanza and Land in this case) can go to the next layer. Vitanza says, “What Land does is to write incessantly of the negation of negation, but continues to display this immense ‘thirst for’ death, this boundless necessity to speak of ALL THIS in terms of NEGATION. And never lets up. There is no sense of a celebration of hope or of life”.[93] My issue with this is that negation is not the same for Land (and Bataile) as it is for everyone else. This is because “[n]egation is re-forged in the celebration of the death of God”.[94] Negation, the Landian sense, “is incommensurate with the negation that was permitted within theology and the metaphysics conditioned by it” (which is all metaphysics besides Land and Bataille’s (if they even have a metaphysics).[95] This is to say, Land’s conception of negation is not in any way like the negation of metaphysics and theology, they can’t be judged by the same standard. Land is not a thinker, nor re-thinker, of negation, but a fellow madman who reveals that negation is atheological. Now, Vitanza says that he understands why Land does this, he says, “[Land] begins with the historical narrative of the Death of God, and instead of revaluing value so as to get out of Nihilism, he follows Bataille into the abyss of zero, out of which there is possibilities. Out of death there is life! He does not get out of the binary; for him, now everything begins with zero. Hence, life is always determined by way of death, zero, negation. It is death against life”.[96] I first want to say that in the labyrinth, there is no binary difference. Life exists in exchanges with death, as Baudrillard says. I see no issue with anything else.\n\nLater on in the book, Vitanza says, “like Land whom I differ with only in rhetorical strategy” [emphasis mine].[97] Thus, his reading of Land is really to be found in his reading of Bataille.\n\nSpeaking of the sun, Vitanza says, “We are modernists and therefore we are paradoxically not much different in our sick nostalgia for the sun. However, whereas Plato/Socrates viewed this endless source of desire (will, drive, force) as ideal, we must see it as libidinal materialism … Bataille and others would have us see the sun (libidinal energy) in all things material, especially our bodies … Yes, we are modernists (loss, anguish), but first postmodernists (joy, exuberance)”.[98] The Sun, for Vitanza, is libidinal materialism. Solar economics is the economics of libidinal materialism, of libidinal energetics.\n\nTalking about excess, Vitanza says, “Capital works with, and thus creates the conditions for, a model of scarcity, or supply and demand (lack), to benefit the few”.[99] This is an interesting comment because it implies the fact that capitalism, as long as it retains supply and demand (it always will), is restricted economy. So much for Goux’s attempt at critiquing Bataille through the perspective of supply and demand.\n\nNext, Vitanza refutes Lyotard’s critique of Bataille. What Lyotard is arguing is that “[Bataille] wants one genre at the expense of all others”.[100] Vitanza doesn’t see this as true. In fact, Bataille endorses no genres. He only endorses a “non-genre of sovereign writing”.[101]\n\nI want to briefly expand an extremely interesting notion that comes from Vitanza. Vitanza says, “Logic must be wasted as well”.[102] The core motor of this book is a paroxysmal convulsion. The violent contradiction of this text: trying to make nonsense into (common) sense. You can see this in this essay and many others. In this essay, I have tried to make sense of libidinal energetics by employing a very interesting strand of neo-Leibnizian thought. The point of this text is just to open up as many places of thought as possible, it is to theoretically extend ‘Bataille’ as far as one can. For example, to my knowledge, I am the first person to create an explicit (Shaviro makes a comment, but never extrapolates it) Bataillean formulation of contemporary semiocapitalism. I want to see how much one can apply Bataillean analysis, which may seem like an oxymoron, but let’s cut the shit for a moment (a homogeneous movement, I know; the exclusion of scatology). Bataillean scholarship has put Bataille in quite the weird place: a place of restriction. Many say, “you can’t write about Bataille in this way,” I am sure that I have even accidentally done this over the hundreds of pages I have written about Bataille. But any form of restriction is to be met with the highest form of resistance. General economics is an analysis which is just that: general. I see no problem in extending Bataille and his theoretics as far as I can. Treating Bataille as this sort of untouchable outsider has always seemed so weird yet intriguing. I understand the appeal of his radicality. But, his radicalism ceases to be radical if one is excluding other parts of his thought, i.e., those moments where he is more “tame”. Creating a certain ‘Bataille’ is something I have no issue with, it’s something I do all the time. I’ve made so many different types of ‘Bataille’. But saying that this Bataille which you have created is the Bataille is what places one beyond forgiveness. But this loss of potential forgiveness is not a transgression, it is a fundamental generation of disappointment. But back to Vitanza.\n\nTo waste logic is something this book has barely done. I have been trying to make sense out of nonsense. But, the operation of this book is one which has broken down because it is in trying to make sense out of nonsense that everything just gets more confusing and nonsensical.\n\nLastly, Vitanza sums up Land’s more Bataillean philosophy in a sentence: “We are spent, Zero”.[103]\n\nWe are now to go over Nick Land’s posing of Bataille contra Kant.\n\nFanged Noumena\n\nKant’s critical philosophy is the most elaborate fit of panic in the history of the Earth.\n\n— Nick Land, The Thirst for Annihilation[104]\n\nFirstly, we must address the elephant in the room: G. W. F. Hegel.\n\nIs Hegel not the only entrance to philosophy for us Batailleans? In fact, is Hegel not the only philosopher to be? Is Hegel not the only thing philosophy has to offer us. Some may think so, but Land has taken an approach to the question of Hegel in relation to Bataille which is quite unorthodox, even for the already unorthodox.\n\nLand argues that philosophy doesn’t offer us Hegel, but Kant. He says, “Philosophy (comprehending all ‘theory’) has no socio-historical pertinence for us other than its relation to Kant”.[105] The issue with viewing Bataille in the context of Hegel instead of Kant is twofold: 1. Hegel is in the context of Kant’s transcendental philosophy and 2. Bataille’s philosophical terminology seems to have more relation to Kant than to Hegel (Land gives the examples of sovereignty, the limit, the unknown, possibility, objectivity, end, immanence, and transcendence).\n\nIf anything, Hegel and his philosophy are nothing but the extension of Kant, “the life-support machine of Kantianism”.[106]\n\nBataille, for Land, is “fated to address a Kantian inheritance,” and because of this, Bataille is the one who is to exceed Kantianism, that is, “to cross the line which divides representation from the real, and this to depart both from philosophy and from the world that has expelled it into its isolation”.[107]\n\nIn the seventh chapter of The Thirst for Annihilation, “Fanged noumenon (passion of the cyclone),” Land begins his close analysis of Bataille in relation to Kant and vice versa.\n\nLand asks a question which startles us. He asks, “Is not transcendental philosophy a fear of the sea?”.[108] The ocean gnaws at us and the land. The ocean is what rebels against the stable form of terra firma. For Land, Kant renounces the ocean in favor of solid earth. Thus, “[r]eason in its legitimate function is a defence against the sea, which is also an inhibition of the terrestrial”.[109] Reason inhibits our tendency towards useless expenditure. The ocean is the unknowable, and thus, dry land is knowledge derived by way of reason. Land speaks of dry land as a structure. We must then remember that “Bataile exhibits no positive interest in the philosophies of structure”.[110] We must note that this is not to say that Bataille was a post-structuralist. He was nothing of the sort, for post-structuralism is still too structured. Logical difference is too structured when compared to the non-logical difference that is base matter.\n\nFor Bataille, God is nothing more than a cosmic principle which stabilizes and individuates subjects into subjects. For Bataille, “the ecstasy of the unknown … contests any possible resurrection of theological edifices,” and thus, God is dead when knowledge breaks down into nonknowledge.[111] Land sees that Kant too comes up against theology, but Kant doesn’t crash against theology like a wave (which is how Bataile crashes against theology). Rather, Kant crashes up against theology like a ball hitting a brick wall, that is, bouncing off and doing no damage (though the ball may have some damage done to it).\n\nKant does not reach the ocean, for it is a useless operation; “[Kant] recognizes the ocean as a space of absolute voyage, and thus of hopelessness and waste”.[112] Kant stays upon the shore, and looking out into the vast horror that is the ocean, nervously remarks to himself, “[b]etter to remain on dry land than to lose oneself in the desolation of zero”.[113]\n\nKant turns the noumenon into the shore because it limits ‘the claims of sensibility’ just as the shore limits the ocean. Kant says (A254–255/B310–311), “The concept of a noumenon is also necessary … to limit the objective validity of sensible knowledge … The concept of a noumenon is, therefore, only a limiting concept, and intended to keep the claims of sensibility within proper bounds”.[114]\n\nKant says (A253/B307), noumenon, in its negative sense, means “a thing insofar as it is not an object of our sensible intuition,” and, in its positive sense, noumenon means “an object of a non-sensible intuition”.[115] We generally look at the noumenon in its negative sense, Kant notes.\n\nSo, to give a little more explanation, I’ll explain what intuition, concept, and sensibility all mean, and then I’ll explain the relation between intuition and sensibility. Kant says (A19/B33), “Whatever the process and the means may be by which knowledge refers to its objects, intuition is that through which it refers to them immediately, and at which all thought aims as a means. But intuition takes place only insofar as the object is given to us. This again is only possible, for us human beings at least, when the mind is affected by the object in a certain way. The capacity (receptivity) to obtain representations through the way in which we are affected by objects is called sensibility. Objects are therefore given to us by means of our sensibility. Sensibility alone supplies us with intuitions. These intuitions are thought through the understanding, and from the understanding there arise concepts. But all thought must, directly or indirectly, by way of certain characteristics, refer ultimately to intuitions, and therefore, with us, to sensibility, because in no other way can any object be given to us”.[116] Later in Critique of Pure Reason, Kant says (A320/B377), “Knowledge is either as an intuition or a concept … The former refers immediately to an object and is singular; the latter refers mediately to the object, that is, by means of a characteristic mark that several things have in common”.[117]\n\nThus, intuitions and concepts are both means to knowledge. So let’s describe these two ideas further. One has an intuition about something when they are perceiving it presently, that is, when they are perceiving the object which is present, or immediately, in front of them. They then derive knowledge from that intuition. So, for example, I have an intuition about a basketball when I have it in my hand(s) and I know I have it in my hand(s). Now, keep this example of the basketball in our heads.\n\nSensation is a form of perception. Perception is, as Kant says (A320/B377), “representation with consciousness”.[118] So, sense-perception is not the only form of perception I argue. There can be perception of something that is not there (think people who are undergoing psychosis or have some form of schizophrenia and see things which are not there or feel like they are being watched, when in fact, nothing is watching them). But, I’ll give some examples of sense perception: I feel a hot object with my hand and it burns me, or, I cut my hand and I feel pain, or, I see a book. It is when I am put in immediate relation with an object, and my own state is changed (e.g., I see a book and am thus existing in relation to that book), that I sense it. Thus, I must sense an object, that is, have an object in an immediate relation with myself, before I can have an intuition about it. That is the relation between sensibility and intuition. Let’s look at the form of knowledge that is a concept.\n\nI inuit an object via sense perception, that is, immediately. With the concept as a means to knowledge, things are different. I conceptualize an object mediately, not immediately. So what does this mean? Let’s think about this idea of ‘concept’ in a few ways. Kant says (A50/B74), “Our knowledge springs from two fundamental sources of our mind; the first is to receive representations (receptivity of impressions), the second is the faculty of knowing an object through these representations (spontaneity of concepts)”.[119] Kant says, (A68/B93), “All intuitions, as sensible, rest on affections; concepts, then, rest on functions. By function I mean the unity of the act of arranging various representations under one common representation”.[120] I know of the object via its impressions upon me (this is sense-perception and the knowledge immediately derived from this is intuitive), and this leads to representations. So, let’s go back to our example of the basketball. I have an intuition about a basketball when I see (sense) that it is orange, and I know that it is orange. I have the concept of ‘basketball’ when I take all the intuitions I have about the basketball and “put them together,” that is, synthesize, that is, conceptualize the basketball when I combine all the representations of the basketball derived through sense-perception together into the single representation that is ‘basketball’. So, I have the concept of ‘basketball’ when I combine the knowledge that it is orange, it is light, it is rubbery, it is bouncy, etc. into one single piece of knowledge known as ‘basketball’ (this is the process that is conceptualization).\n\nWe can therefore conclude that a noumenon, for Kant, is a thing which we can have no knowledge of because it is not an object which we can sensibly inuit. One cannot have experience of the noumenon. Land concurs with our conclusion that this is what Kant sees the noumenon as.\n\nThe problems arise for Kant when he says (A256/B312), “[the noumenon is] an unknown something” [emphasis mine].[121] Land notes that this latter remark of Kants is nothing more than “the Occidental obsession with the object”.[122] What Land is taking issue with is the assumption that “[the noumenon] would be something other than objectless waste without end, or the void-plane touched upon at zero-intesnity”.[123] Why must there be an object? Why must there be one instead of zero? If “the ocean has no sense except as a failure of the land,” then does the noumenon not have no sense except as a failure of the phenomenal object?[124] Even though “no transcendent object is found,” Kant and his transcendental idealism “retains the sense of a lost or absent object, rather than that of a contact with or through objectlessness”.[125]\n\nLand sees Kant’s utilitarian casting of death “as a quasi-objectivity correlative to capital, and noumenon is its name”.[126] With Kant, death as the noumenon is still restrained, defanged, theological. If the noumenon is domesticated as an object then it necessarily becomes the defanged noumenon, that is, the one of mono-theism, whereas, the fanged noumenon, which is the noumenon as objectless waste, is the zero of atheology.\n\nLand says, “There is no place, no domain, for base matter in Kant’s thinking, since even auto-generativity in nature is conceived as a regulative analogue of rational willing”.[127] This is to say, as long as the noumenon is defanged, that is, is an object, base matter will be excluded from Kant’s transcendental idealism. One must first stop Kant from pulling the noumenon’s death, that is, one must stop seeing the noumenon as a thing, an object, “in order to glimpse that between matter and death there is both a certain identity and an intricate relation, or, in other words: a unilateral difference appending matter to the edge of zero”.[128]\n\nLand sees that Kant’s disjoining of the object from the subject by way of a transcendentalist schema “effaces base materiality”.[129] It is death which keeps base matter’s teeth sharp. Is base matter the fanged noumenon which is objectless waste? Or is death the fanged noumenon because “death can bite … [as] it remains uncaged by the inhibition objectivity entails”.[130] Death snaps the bars of the cage that is objectivity.\n\nFor Bataille, the unknown is the movement towards zero. Land notes that this is exactly what Kant refused to admit. The noumenon, which is unknown, can have nothing to do with zero for Kant. Bataille laughs at this, running the noumenon and zero “convulsively into each other”.[131] Zero cannot not be, it cannot be one, nor anything else. The noumenon is not, it is not an object. The noumenon is zero. The fanged noumenon bites the hand of its handler (Kant) and runs off into THE NIGHT!\n\nKant says (A290/B346), “Before leaving this Transcendental Analytic, we have to add something which, though in itself of no particular importance, may yet seem to be requisite for the completeness of the system” [emphasis mine].[132] We are now dealing with nothing less than a required part of Kant’s transcendental idealism. But what is this required part? Kant explains (A290/B346), “The highest concept from which all transcendental philosophy usually begins is the division into the possible and the impossible. But, as all division presupposes a divided concept, a higher concept is required, and this is the concept of an object in general”.[133] He then says (A290/B346), “As the categories are the only concepts which refer to objects in general, the distinction whether an object is something or nothing must proceed according to the order and direction of the categories”.[134]\n\nLand notes, “Kant differentiates between four divisions of nothing, reciprocally correlated to the four classes of the categories”.[135] But, before we look at the four divisions of nothing, let us look at the categories and understand what they are.\n\nFirstly, let’s go over what Kant means by ‘pure concepts,’ as this will allow us to look at the division between pure and empirical as well as what empirical and pure intuitions and concepts are. For Kant, intuitions and concepts are either empirical or pure. Kant says (A50/B74), “[intuitions and concepts] are empirical when they contain sensation (sensation presupposes the actual presence of the object)”.[136] So, we have already covered what empirical intuitions are. I say this because, earlier in this essay, we covered that form of intuition which completely depends on the sense perception of a single present object before the perceiving subject. I say this also because, earlier in this essay, we covered that form of concept, that is, the empirical concept, which refers mediately to an object of sense perception which was present to the subject. Empirical intuitions must come from sense experience, and empirical concepts must come from a synthesis of experience, that is, of the representations one derives from intuitions. So, what are pure intuitions and concepts?\n\nKant says (A50/B74), “[intuitions and concepts] are pure when no sensation is mixed in with the representation”.[137] Pure intuitions and concepts do not arise from sense perception, that is, from experience. The term ‘pure’ in ‘pure intuition’ or ‘pure concept’ is used because these forms of intuitions and concepts are not tainted by the baseness of experience. That which is pure is thus a priori, that is, without experience. Therefore, that which is empirical is a posteriori, that is, with experience. Let us now look at pure intuitions and concepts.\n\nWe are to cover what pure intuitions are first. Pure intuition is a pure form of sensibility. The connection between intuition and sensibility is something we mustn’t forget when we deal with Kant. Pure intuitions are those which we inuit a priori in our mind. There are two pure intuitions: space and time. Before we look at space and time, let us take note that pure representation (of objects) is, for Kant, that representation which is not tainted by sensation. Kant says (A22/B37) that for our mind to sensibly intuit objects, it must first represent said objects “as outside us … [and] in space”.[138] He furthers (A22/B37), “[i]n space [objects’] shape, size, and relation to one another are determined or determinable”.[139] This pure intuition we know as space takes place as an operation of our mind which is without an object which we sense. Now, space is that pure intuition which is intuited outside our minds (ourselves for Kant), but that pure intuition which is intuited inside our mind (ourselves, again, for Kant) is time. Kant says (A23/B37), “Time cannot be intuitted externally, any more than space can be intuited as something within us”.[140] Time allows us to “order” ourselves, and space allows us to order that which is not us. Or, in other words, the subject orders itself by way of the pure intuition of time, and the object is ordered by the mind’s (the subject’s for Kant) pure intuition of space. Space comes before sensation. Space “is” a priori. In fact, space is a pure intuition which is needed in order to have sense perception of objects, that is to say, to have empirical intuitions. Space must be intuited a priori, that is, “purely” in order to have intuitions of objects. Thus, space is not an object. This is why we cannot “sense” it, if that makes sense. Space is “generated” by the mind. Kant says (A26/B42), “Space does not represent any property of any things in themselves, nor does it represent them in their relation to one another … [it wouldn’t] remain even if we abstracted from all subjective conditions of intuitions … [Space] is the subjective condition of sensibility, under which alone outer intuition is possible for us”.[141] Now, let’s look at time. Time, like space, “is” a priori. And, again, like space, time is needed in order to have sense perceptions of objects, that is to say, to have empirical intuitions. Now, Kant says (A33/B49–50), “Time is nothing but the form of inner sense, that is, of our intuition of ourselves, and of our inner state. Time cannot be a determination of outer appearances. As opposed to belonging to shape or location, etc., time determines the relation of representations in our inner state”.[142] In this way, time is like space. It is like space in this way because it is again not an object, it is subjective, that is, dependent on the subject. Time is not something that would exist without the subject, just like space. Now, time, like space, is “about” relations. The relation between objects can and is always temporal. Kant brings up (A32/B49), the example of “one [object] after the other”.[143] Now, we have looked at pure intuitions, but what about pure concepts?\n\nPure concepts, like pure intuitions, “are” not a posteriori, but rather, “are” a priori. We must understand that the pure concepts we are to look at are ‘pure concepts of the understanding’. And this begs the question “what is the understanding?”. Kant says (A51/B75), “We call sensibility the receptivity of our mind to receive representations insofar as it is in some wise affected, while the understanding, on the other hand, is our faculty of producing representations by ourselves, or the spontaneity of knowledge”.[144] Firstly, when Kant speaks of ‘thought’ or ‘thinking,’ what does he mean? We, firstly, have intuitions of an object through sense perception and this spawns representations. Our mind receives these representations by way of the receptivity of our mind which is sensibility. We, secondly, then have, as Kant says (A50/B74), “the faculty of knowing an object through these representations” and this is thought or thinking as we are thinking “the object … in relation to that representation (which is a mere determination of the mind)”.[145] This faculty we speak of is the faculty of understanding. It is quite simple as it sounds. It is how we understand what our mind inuits about an object (it intuits representations). So, to answer the question of “what are pure concepts,” we must come full circle and answer the question of “what are the categories?’.\n\nThe categories are the pure concepts of understanding. Pure concepts are the concepts of what any, and therefore, every object must have in common. And, we know that every object must “fall within” the categories a priori, that is to say, we know that every object has these concepts in common without experience. Thus, these concepts are pure.\n\nWe know a priori that every object must be of a certain quantity, have a certain qualities, be in relation to some other object, and must have some mode of existing, of being. So, onto the four divisions of nothing.\n\nThe four divisions of nothing correlates with the four categories. So, nothing as ens rationis correlates with the category of quantity; nothing as nihil privativum correlates with the category of quality; nothing as ens imaginarium correlates with the category of relation; and nothing as nihil negativum correlates with the category of modality. Let us now go into detail about each of these “forms” of nothing.\n\nLet’s start with nothing as empty concept without an object, ens rationis. Kant says (A290/B346–347), “Opposed to the concepts of all, many and one, there is the concept which cancels everything, that is, none; and thus the object of a concept to which no intuition can be found to correspond is = nothing; that is, it is a concept without an object, as are the noumena, which cannot be counted among the possibilities, though they are not therefore claimed to be impossible either”.[148] Ens rationis = nothing, it is the noumenon in the negative sense. We have already gone over the noumenon in the negative sense, so let us look at nihil privativum, and note that we will come back to ens rationis, do not worry.\n\nWe are now to look at nothing as empty object of a concept, nihil privativum. Kant says (A291/B347), “Reality is something, negation is nothing, namely, it is the concept of the absence of an object, such as shadow or cold (nihil privativum)”.[149] This nothing is not an object, but it is still negation in that old theological sense which we talked about back with Vitanza’s constructive “critique” of Land’s conception of negation. This is not negation in the reforged atheological sense which is nonsense.\n\nWhen looking at nothing as empty intuition without an object, ens imaginarium, Kant says (A291/B347), “The mere form of intuition, without substance, is in itself no object, but is the merely formal condition of an object (as appearance), such as pure space and pure time (ens imaginarium). These, though they are something, as forms of intuition, are not themselves objects which are intuited”.[150] Ens imaginarium are intuitions which intuit nothing and are therefore empty.\n\nLastly, we are to look at nothing as empty object without a concept, nihil negativum. Kant says (A291/B348), “The object of a concept which contradicts itself is nothing because the concept is nothing; it is the impossible, such as a two-sided rectilinear figure (nihil negativum)”.[151] While ens rationis is still possible because it isn’t impossible, nihil negativum is impossible because it is an contradictory object and this means it is impossible because it would therefore make the concept contradictory, which is impossible?\n\nThis is another “law” of the policeman named Immanuel Kant: the dissociation of noumena (ens rationis) from the impossible.\n\nFor Land, Kant counts to one when he sees the noumenon as = nothing, that is, as ens rationis. What is taking place here is Kant “crushing [the noumenon] under the categories of the object which — according to their four classes — stamp it with inverse features of mathematical unity, semantic definition, substantial reciprocity, and logical identity”.[152] Land sees that Bataille’s theorization of sacrifice fights against this Kantian schema because “[r]ather than sharing the features of subtraction, deprivation, impotence, and dialectic, which Kant allots to the four aspects of nothing, sacrifice characterizes zero as undifferentiably pre-unitary, extravagant, unilateral, and impossible”.[153]\n\nLand holds that “[t]he noumenon is not primarily an epistemological problem, but a religious one”.[154] For Land, epistemology is of the subject/object distinction. Land says, “Epistemology takes as its problem the relation of a subjective representation to what is objectively represented — which might be problematic (scepticism) or unproblematic (dogmatism), one of difference (realism) or identity (subjective idealism) — but what is evaded in this whole calculus of permutations is the relation between knowing (sobject/object separation) and what is not knowing, or the sense of what escapes thought other than as an unknown object, which is to say, other than as the real thing ‘behind’ the representation of the object (Kant’s noumenon is still this). In order to differentiate between the real correlate of the object, or epistemologically determined real substance, and the unconditioned unknown, Bataille does not refer merely to matter, but to base matter; a materiality so alien to the epistemological framework that it is utterly without dependence upon the form of the object (the thing)”.[155] Libidinal or base materialism is of the unknowable and does nothing other than cause epistemology, that is, knowledge to be corroded in the acid of nonknowledge. One mustn’t forget that because intuitions are a starting point for knowledge, the object of epistemology, conscious sense-experience, and thus phenomenology are to be included in our discussion too, though this inclusion is latent. Land recognizes that Bataille has no issue with the transcendental idealist’s positing of an outside to experience. What Bataille takes issue with is the “positing of experience as dissociated from its slide into oblivion”.[156] This is, for Land, Bataille’s reiteration of Nietzsche’s critique of the normative (moral) underpinnings of epistemology. Nietzsche’s critique was this: “The very possibility of a problem about the relation between experience and the real — requiring a theory of representation — presupposes the deformation of experience in terms of the ‘good’, or, in other words, the stable, isolated, and determinate, correlated to the caging of noumenon in the form of the object”.[157] But the whole problem with this idealist presupposition is the fact that “experience is not given in reality as knowledge, but as collapse”.[158] We will come back to epistemology in a moment.\n\nFor Land, Kant doesn’t just domesticate the noumenon (as an object) but also zero-intensity (as pure consciousness). Kant does this when he says (A166/B208), “pure intuition = 0”.[159] Bataille rejects this proposition completely by arguing that experience finds its end in the fusion of the subject and object. This is the “shift from the transcendental idealist treatment of zero to that of base materialism”.[160] Zero is reduced to the pure intuitions of space and time. But this makes zero anything but base. Zero thus also becomes of discontinuous subjectivity (as that is what the pure intuitions of space and time are of), which it is not, at least from the perspective of base materialism.\n\nNow, to return to epistemology and the pure intuitions of space and time. For and, the next few issues with Kant are the facts that “he does not raise a problem of the object with sufficient radicality to escape from the cage of epistemology in the direction of a libidinal or base materialism. He does not acknowledge that between the noumenon and zero intensity there is no difference, or that neither are susceptible to isolation. Above all, he nowhere seems to suspect the obvious fact that zero is the primary repressed of monotheistic cultures, so that its intensive impact is historically saturated”.[161] Land says, “Purity conditions the a priori” in Kant’s philosophy of transcendental idealism.[162] The later statement of Land’s was said in relation to the pure intuition of time, but it contains much larger implications than Land ever expounded. One of these implications is the fact that this very idea that our mind can think, understand, etc. in an a priori fashion means nothing other than the debasement of the mind. The idealist conception of the mind tries to first operate without base matter at its base. This is the problem: transcendental idealism, requiring the categories, the pure concepts, of understanding and the two pure intuitions space and time to “operate” a priori in our minds, dissociates the mind from the base matter which is anything but pure. In fact, another implication is that we cannot make a priori claims at all as it will never reflect the real. Now, this concept of the real is what we must focus on. But we must also ask a question: how are we thus supposed to think of space and time then?\n\nOn the Contemporary Debate Between Speculative Realism and Correlationism\n\nThe issue we face when we make descriptive claims about the real is this: we presuppose the validity of sense perception when we make descriptions. Now, you could give the very objectivist, that is, Randian response that our senses have no volition and thus they couldn’t change anything, therefore making our perception of everything “objective”. But, this Randian response isn’t a response which is at all adequate. It isn’t adequate because when the Randian says “the eyes cannot change what we see because they have no volition,” they are presupposing that sense perception is valid because the very claim that the eyes are non-volitional physical objects relies on the presupposition that our sense perception (in this case visual) is valid. This is to say, we must first see that our eyes have no volition, assuming they do, before one can argue that it reflects the real (which is supposed to be based on sense perception). This presupposes that sense perception is valid. This is why we need a phenomenal and noumenal distinction. But we need not follow Kant in his formulation of the-noumenon-as-object, we mustn’t fall into the blindness of contemporary speculative realism. Rather, we must make a pseudo-bridge between speculative realism and correlationism. But remember, this is a bridge which collapses.\n\nWhile thinkers such as Quentin Meillassoux reject correlationism in favor of a speculative realism (in the case of Meillassoux, it is a speculative materialism), I can not do such a thing. I can do no such thing because Being (Being here is not being used in the Bataillean sense, I use Being here in the more contemporary sense in which Being is everywhere) does not reflect the real, nor is it the real. But, this is not a statement in favor of correlationism, because Thinking too is nothing but fictional, as is Being. Being and Thought have no correlation, there is no bilateral movement towards one another. Rather, there is only a unilateral movement towards zero. We can’t even say that the real is, because even though being (real) would be its “logical identity” and “function,” logic is wasted, and there is only zero.\n\nOn a Base Materialist Reformulation of the Phenomenal and Noumenal Economies\n\nIf we are to have a “world” (realm, etc.) outside experience that is the noumenal world, then it will not be a world of things, and thus Being has nothing to do with it. In this way, Being and Thought are not at all separated, but they are not separated for the same reason the correlationist thinks they correlate: Being is not the real. The real, if it ever was, is wasted, and there is only zero (the real = 0?). Thus, in a Kantian fashion, we can follow Amy Ireland in reformulating Kant without the object. We are left “with two economies: the restricted economy of the phenomenal — a controlled appropriation of the outside that fuels the human system of representation; and the general economy of the noumenal — an anarchic alterity always operating in excess of the phenomenal, formless, irrecuperable and unknowable”.[163]\n\nWe will look at a strain of speculative realism called ‘transcendental nihilism’ (formulated by Ray Braisseer in his book Nihil Unbound) later.\n\nFor a Base Materialist Reformulation of Space and Time\n\nBataille doesn’t follow Kant in assuming space, instead he “thinks space”.[164] Space, in the Kantian sense, is differentiated, that is, is “generated” “by” composition (rather than the mind), because it is composition; “composition is simultaneous with the real differentiation ‘of’ space”.[165] Thus, space, in the Kantian sense, that is, as that non-object which “organizes” all objects, can be decomposed.\n\nThe base materialist conception of space is ‘sponge-space’ which is “the positive impossibility of resolved boundaries, and thus of discrete entities, decidable actions, unproblematic vectors, logical identities, and adequate representations”.[166] Sponge-space is the decomposition of space “proper”. It is God being soaked by the sponge of the scales. In sponge-space, space ceases to be a pure intuition because “[i]n sponge-space pure spatiality cannot be demarcated from matter as a discrete concept”.[167]\n\nLet’s look at time now. Time, in the base materialist formulation of it, is “the suicidal jealousy of God … [it is] a cancer at the core of the universe … a volcanic ulceration in the gusts of God, and its catastrophic eruption consumes all established things in the acidic lava of impersonality”.[168] Time is the collapse towards zero.\n\nNow, we must look at Land’s idea of flow. Land says, “The reality of space is only the possibility of flow”.[169] This is because “flow is gauged in terms of a fixed grid assembled from space, time, and matter”.[170] Flow is that flow of sea water which fills up the sponge of sponge-space, “[displacing] mass in space over time in a strictly quantifiable fashion … [therefore it is] posterior to the apparatus of its representation”.[171] Land notes that generally people think of time as a flow, but because “flows characterize the repressed of thinking,” time-as-flow doesn’t flow from past to future or vice versa, rather, time-as-flow causes the line of linear time to completely collapse in an atheological cosmic shuddering.[172] In fact, the Kantian conception of time, as the internal “organization” of the subject, “is a representation controlled by a defensive system, simultaneous with mature patriarchy, nucleated upon the ego, and correlated with the generation of a utilitarian hydraulics”.[173] Remember that time-as-flow is still a flow, and it will be put in pipes by civilization. This process of putting time-as-flow into pipes is a part of the internal making of a composition. Thus, it is only the matter of time until the pipes (compositional cages) burst.\n\nDealing With Reza and his Antics Once More\n\nI’m not going to lie, Reza Negarestani’s tweets aren’t as funny as Nick Land’s. Reza has also been going through some twitter drama recently (two days ago as I write this) over misgendering Mackenzie Wark or at least that’s what I have deduced after my friends sent me screen shots of what was happening (as of the date I write this, I don’t have a twitter). On another level, Reza Negarestani’s work is much more rigid than Land’s. Land had a very “organic” development, whereas Negarestani repeated the same charges (against Bataille). I want to talk about accelerationism and its relation to Bataille in a moment, but before I do I want to look at one of the suggestions that there is an accelerationist logic within solar economics, and then his follow up to that.\n\nIn his essay Accelerationism and the problem of (un)binding, Reza Negarestani argues that accelerationism is stuck within restricted economy, and that Bataille’s solar economics are definitively accelerationist. So, it seems we must defend accelerationism, specifically in its Landian theorization.\n\nNegarestani argues that if specifically “Landian accelerationism” is about pushing capitalism to its limit by way of accelerating the destructive and catastrophic movements inherent to capitalism, then accelerationism is unable to “detach itself from the embedded energetic model of dissipation inherent to conservative-dissipative, antiproduction-productive structures which are only capable of binding unilateral negativity or inflect upon death by means of an economical model of energetic dissipation or dying that they can afford”.[174] Firstly, what is this usage of ‘conservative’? To answer this question, we must go back and look at his essay Solar Inferno and the Earthbound Abyss. In Solar Inferno and the Earthbound Abyss, Negarestani argues that the conservative structure is the organism. Thus, when Negarestani speaks of “the embedded energetic model of dissipation inherent to conservative-dissipative, antiproduction-productive structures which are only capable of binding unilateral negativity,” he is speaking of heliocentric slavery, that is, the organism’s only model of dying is opening itself to the outside, that is, to the Sun.[175] So, Negarestani is arguing that accelerationism’s model of acceleration (dissipation) is the same as the conservative organism’s model of dissipation. Now, this is of course problematic only for Negarestani. I will repeat my contentions that I raised against this same argument found in Solar Inferno and the Earthbound Abyss.\n\nFirstly, his description of these models of dissipation as anti-productive tells us nothing because dissipation is always unproductive, because if it is not, it is then not dissipation. One can not squander and accumulate, because if one did, they would never be dissipating but staying at equilibrium. So, all models of dissipation are anti-productive (can we really say that dissipation has a “model”?).\n\nSecondly, Negarestani is thus, like I noted in my response to Solar Inferno and the Earthbound Abyss (see above), strawmanning us. The conservative structure that is the organism doesn’t actually have the model of expenditure that the Sun has because it restricts the expenditure. In other words, when Negarestani says, “if acceleration coincides with the dissipative or energetic economy of the organism, then it is simply a restricted project,” we do not disagree with this. What we do disagree with is that acceleration coincides with the energetic economy of the organism. This is because the energetic model of dissipation of the organism was only adopted by the organism in the first place “as an affordable yet traumatic consumptive solution”.[176] The organism is in no way following the model of the Sun if it is transforming “the ubindinable excess into conservable … energetic spaces” [emphasis mine].[177] Thus, this is not expenditure at all, it is too teleological. Accelerationism, in the Landian sense, is an end in itself. It is necessarily unconditional. Using the anti-method of acceleration to reach a desired form of political organization, is to be necessarily recuperated by that which they are trying to accelerate, but more on this later. Now, one can argue that Negarestani’s issue is specifically the way the organism dissipates, i.e., he doesn’t care if it has teleology or not, but he does care that it is opening to the outside. This is to say, one could argue that Negarestani’s issue is the supposed failure of philosophy to think about dissipation in another way. This issue for Negarestani is that the other forms of radical exteriority as extinction which he poses as an alternative to Bataille, are necessarily entailed within general economy. One example of an alternative he gives is “material disintegration”.[178] For Bataille, material disintegration is a form of expenditure. Decomposition, decay, material disintegration, etc. are all within the general economy. So, Negarestani has yet to really pose an alternative which the general economy doesn’t already propose.\n\nThirdly, Negarestani is again strawmanning us. Negarestani says, “what is really at stake here is the way the exteriority is bound … [For Nietzsche, Bataille, Land et al., exteriority is] bound only in a way that the organism can afford (therefore, it conforms to an ultimately conservative economical correlation between the interiorized horizon and the exteriority)”.[179] But this is not true. Is this exteriority necessarily bound to the organism? Yes, but not in the way Reza is speaking of it. What is restricted in restricted economy? Exteriority. The exteriority Bataille speaks of is the Sun, that is, the general economy. Restricted economy is a model of production, general economy is a model of dissipation. So, when Reza says, “the dissipative rate is energetically conceived as an economical (and hence, restricted) correlation; its existence is dictated by the exorbitant index of exteriority but is modi operandi are conditioned by the affordability of the interiorized horizon of the organism,” we can do nothing but chuckle at the point he has made.[180] What Negarestani has just said begs the question “what can the organism afford?”. I would posit that the organism cannot afford to die. Only by evoking the Freudian death drive, can Negarestani argue that the organism can afford to die. And he evokes it. But the death drive in its Freudian form is nothing but an attempt at the homogenizing purification of the permutation of libidinal matter. Thus, there is no general economical relation between the subject, its interiority, and the excess which is exterior to it, because necessarily being ceases to be in Being. Or, in other words, inner experience requires the dissolution of the subject, but this dissolution doesn’t work linearly, that is to say, Reza is presupposing that dissipation is an action, it is something that happens over time, but it is not. Do decay, entropy, and decomposition not take time though? The answer is “no,” because if time in its homogeneous and linear form is occurring then there is only growth, negentropy, and composition. As Land says, “That time is conceived as a river streaming dissymmetrically from the future into the past, is a representation controlled by a defensive system, simultaneous with mature patriarchy, nucleated upon the ego, and correlated with the generation of a utilitarian hydraulics.”[181] Expenditure = 0.\n\nNegarestani confirms that he was talking about heliocentric slavery when he says, “[accelerationism] aims at accelerating the rate of dissipation .. [and therefore] its ‘speculative opportunities’ are limited to the most immediate source of exorbitant or traumatizing energy that the interiorized horizon has come into contact with”.[182] What is this immediate source of energy that one comes into contact with? It is nothing other than the Sun. But as we know, there is no heliocentric slavery. So, when he says, “accelerationism [is] only capable of thinking exteriority and extinction in terms of a model of solar expenditure and thermonuclear decay (Bataille’s solar economy),” we can do nothing but endorse ‘solar accelerationism’ as a form of general economic expenditure (on a level of the political, but note, that it does undoes the political in its acceleration).[183]\n\nIn his essay Trauma and the Outside: 1000 forms of cut, Negarestani again tries to critique Bataille. He acknowledges that “Bataille’s general economy is not limited to solar economy or the Sun as its manifest image, and that Bataillean general economy is indeed about cosmic forces, energies, and exteriorities”.[184] He continues, “Bataille’s general economy is not restricted to the Sun since Bataille identifies general economy with cosmic exteriorities under the heading of exorbitance … But this is precisely the problem with Bataille’s general economy because cosmic exteriorities are not limited to exorbitance”.[185] Reza is arguing that not everything in the universe follows Bataille’s model of dissipation, but we know this not to be true because of the libidinal energetics and cosmology lined out earlier in this essay. The rest of the arguments in this essay that pertain to Bataille are just repeated critiques we have already responded to.\n\nThe last contention I have with Reza is in the form of a question: How do your theories and critiques of Bataille deal with ‘the accursed share,’ that irrecuperable excess energy?\n\nThe Police are Just Outside our Door: On the Marshall Plan\n\nWhat is Land’s response to Kant in The Thirst for Annihilation in terms of “solving” for the Kantian structure that is capitalism (hereinafter also referred to as ‘capital’)? Some call it “accelerationism”. But what is accelerationism?\n\nI think Benjamin Noys sums it up quite nicely. He says, “In particular [accelerationists] reply to Marx’s contention that ‘[t]he real barrier "
