        "text": "In this post I want to explore in greater depth something intriguing that came up in my long (oh so very long…) post On Nick Land. Specifically, in the section discussing Land’s interview “The Only Thing I Would Impose is Fragmentation”, where Land declined to offer a definitive analysis of how his associations with neoreaction and accelerationism relate to one-another*. (You don’t need to read the “On Nick Land” post to follow this one, but it helps for context). In that interview, Land said:\n\n“…I really feel devoid of any authoritative subject position in relation to this turbulent complicated process. Both big threads of process, the NRx and the accelerationist one, are being massively driven by all kinds of forces…..from my perspective it’s much more helical and interweaving.\n\nThe separation of blogs and Twitter accounts is—rather than an implementation of some deliberate coherent strategy—more a set of resources that I can use to try to avoid being just sucked into certain kinds of integration, which would lose the fascination of the fact that the dynamics of these two threads are not at all predictable from each other or even predictable in general.\n\nTo simply smash together a kind of Right Accelerationism and NRx synthesis, which is obviously inescapable in a certain respect, would ultimately destroy a lot of experimenting capacity and a lot of space for dynamic development on both of those threads”\n\nHere, as I argued in the long post, we see Land unwilling to use reason to impose an artificial coherence on a set of ideas. Instead, he wants to allow his own mind to be a space of dynamic experimentation; he wants to allow these ideas to work themselves out through him in their own time. This is not something new for Land, but another instance of continuity between his alleged old and new periods. It harks back to some of his practices back in the 90s at Warwick, as well as ideas expressed in his published work, especially in the essays “Delighted to Death” and “Art as Insurrection” (both included in Fanged Noumena (FN)).\n\nKant’s Violent Reason\n\nA lot of Land’s thinking arises in confrontation with Kant, and in particular it is the Kant of the Third Critique that is relevant here. In The Critique of Judgment, Kant examines the various kinds of aesthetic judgment and their relation to other mental faculties, including the phenomenon of “the sublime”. It is this category of aesthetic experience that has been the focus of most interest in The Third Critique, and plays a central part in Land’s own subversive irrationalist repurposing of Kant.\n\nIn “Delighted to Death” (FN, 123-44), Land paints Kant as the advocate of what you might call an epistemological Puritanism. Kant is claimed to take a kind of saintly, masochistic pleasure in philosophical renunciation. He argues that life for humans is a constant interplay of pleasure and suffering, and that a life devoted solely to uninhibited pleasure would result in “a rapid death from delight”. Christian history has the figure of the martyr making the ultimate sacrifice for their faith; Kant—who in many ways is attempting to construct a Christianity without God—must bring forth an internal mechanism of martyrdom, so that man can become the agent of his own persecution. The mechanism required here is the sublime.\n\nFor Kant, human beings are not naturally good, but become good when reason exercises a kind of “violence” upon the sensory, finite, animal part of us. The imagination—Kant’s name for the cognitive faculty that serves to integrate sensory experience into concepts—is made to supplicate itself before the power of reason by means of the sublime. In sublime experience, the imagination is overwhelmed by an immense reality that it is simply too feeble to assimilate; only reason is sufficient to make sense of this vast beyond, and through this ecstatic overwhelming of the imagination, reason—the higher, angelic part of us—reminds the animal parts who’s boss.\n\nThis model, as the existentialist Walter Kauffman also pointed out, depends on a kind of strange deification of reason. This ability of reason to exercise a persecution of the “baser” cognitive faculties only makes sense if humans are split in two, if reason and the sublime emanate from some separate realm. But what if instead we try to find the roots of both reason and the sublime in the animal-human itself? Land suggests that the sublime does not reveal the superiority of reason, but rather generates it. The superiority of reason is established through an act of violence committed against our “natural” animal intelligence, and this annihilation of the animal is a means of sublimating the death-drive which springs from the animal in the first place.\n\nIt seems then that it is no longer a question of discussion, but of war. Kant seems to be suggesting that it is not reason that has established itself as the superior faculty, rationally justified in ruling over the baser imagination; rather, this external agent, in the form of the sublime, is required to enforce reason’s rule. As Land says in “Art as Insurrection”: “If reason is so secure, legitimate, supersensibly guaranteed, why all the guns?” (FN, 150). While post-Kantian philosophers—Hegel, Schelling, Schopenhauer—attempted to reground this “fanged noumenon” in something rational, Kant invoked the concept of “genius”, insisting that this arational phenomenon—“order’ without anyone giving the orders”—is necessary for creativity.\n\nOnce we have invoked genius as something necessary, the sovereignty of reason is truly gone. As Land argues “It is no doubt comforting to speak of ‘the genius’ as if impersonal creative energy were commensurable with the order of autonomous individuality governed by reason, but such chatter is, in the end, absurd. Genius is nothing like a character trait, it does not belong to a psychological lexicon; far more appropriate is the language of seismic upheaval, inundation, disease, the onslaught of raw energy from without. One ‘is’ a genius only in the sense that one ‘is’ a syphilitic, in the sense that ‘one’ is violently problematized by a ferocious exteriority. One returns to the subject of which genius has been predicated to find it charred and devastated beyond recognition” (FN, 152-3)\n\nIn other words, the autonomous rational subject itself is undermined by this recognition that the creative energy which allows reason to operate must emanate from some unconscious beyond. Subsequently in the work of Arthur Schopenhauer, the will becomes disaligned from reason and the subject; rational decision making becomes dependent on “pre-personal willing”, a move in which Schopenhauer constructs a kind of metaphysics of genius. Schopenhauer is attached to a kind of Buddhistic renunciation of this will when it wells up in us; but Land suggests he could have advocated the opposite route: “dissolution into archaic inundating desire” (FN, 157).\n\nSchopenhauer’s claim that the excitement wrought upon us by the will is a kind of suffering survives into Freudian psychoanalysis, with Freud arguing that humans always desire to return to a state of unexcited equilibrium. There is no true positive pleasure, but only pain and the absence of pain. In Nietzsche however, a shift already occurs: Nietzsche’s recognition of this reality of materialised desire, what Land calls “libidinal materialism”, evolves into the famous will to power, which is a much more positive interpretation. The enigma of the beyond is the very source of creation; “it is the unintelligibility of the world alone that gives it worth”, argues Land (FN, 167).\n\nAgainst Freud’s failure to escape Kantianism, his desire to “police genius” as opposed to seeing psycho-therapeutics as a free, artistic domain, and against the Nazis’ return to individuality and an obsession with agency, Land posits the freedom of a sublime, overflowing, annihilating plenitude: philosophy truly become art. Grounded in Nietzsche, Reich and Deleuze & Guattari, Land creates space for what Robin Mackay and Ray Brassier call a “transcendental materialism”, in which thinking is relocated from the realm of the ideal into the heart of matter itself. Kant’s schema is “destratified”, because the gulf has been eliminated between animality and autonomous reason.\n\nThis feeds directly into Land’s concept of the materialisation of critique, as discussed previously. Philosophy no longer occurs simply inside one’s head; since the operation of synthesis has been relocated to the material realm, philosophy becomes true exploration. This exploration now “runs from the known towards the unknown, rather than from the unknown to the known” (FN, 15). We can no longer dream of holding the whole world, systematised and understood, inside our heads. The philosopher’s hubristic desire to think their way to a well-substantiated truth makes way for an exploratory practice of immersing oneself in reality, and attempting to live one’s way to a new beyond.\n\nHere then, Land’s supposed turn to the dark side, his alignment with free market capitalism, makes perfect sense. At least if one sees capital, as Land does, as the true material instantiation of critique, the true alternative to the theoretician living inside their head. Capitalism does not think its way to solutions; through the market process, exploration, variation, tinkering, genius and natural selection are all embodied in material processes themselves. Lived truths are reached through materiality, and through the endless eruption of libidinal energy that powers the capitalist system. Capital is the death-drive escaped from its box, parading its orgasmic delight across the globe, to the abject horror of those who want to subject it to top-down rational planning. How could Land advocate anything other than free market capitalism?\n\nSpeed & Snake-Becomings\n\nTo his great credit, Land not only advocated this position but, true to form, attempted to really live it. The wreckage of that attempt has been examined by Land himself in his essay “A Dirty Joke” (FN, 629-34), as well as by Robin Mackay in his piece “Nick Land: An Experiment in Inhumanism”. It is to these two that we now turn, starting with Mackay. What does it look like then, if one truly lets the libidinal energies spout forth, without reason to constrain them? It looks of course like “madness”—it is the pure unadulterated essence of pure madness—and this is precisely what Mackay details.\n\nLand turned away from what he saw as the stuffy philosophical academy, and towards popular culture, jungle music and a new blend of art and theory. As Mackay writes: “Strange scenes ensued: A seminar on A Thousand Plateaus where a group of nonplussed graduates were encouraged to ‘read’ the chapter titles of the book by turning them into acronyms that were then plotted as vectors on a diagram of a QWERTY keyboard (‘qwertopology’); A three-week long experiment in refusing to speak in the first person, instead referring to the collective entity ‘Cur’ (comprising the hardcore participants in ‘Current French Philosophy,’ who extended the lectures into a continual movable seminar); and, most memorably, a presentation at the conference Virtual Futures in 1996:”\n\nMackay then goes on to describe the infamous incident where Land recited poetry while writhing on the floor to a background of intense jungle music, much to the complete bemusement of the other Virtual Futures conference attendees. The whole of Land’s Cybernetic Culture Research Unit soon became infamous and legendary for its transgressive practice of clubbing, drinking and taking various recreational drugs, fuelling an output of bizarre, esoteric literature and other cultural products. As time went on, Land’s explorations degenerated into an obsession with the occult and numbers which started to concern even his fellow travellers.\n\nLand came to see his mind and body as the puppet of an external force that he called “Vauung”. I don’t usually like to dwell on this aspect of Land’s story, but this time it is essential to go into detail. In the midst of amphetamine and LSD abuse, casual sex and the chronic absence of sleep, Land dedicated his intellectual pursuits to staring at a computer screen all night, pouring over symbols, attempting to break free of the semiotic itself. Land chronicles this episode and its aftermath in the piece “A Dirty Joke”; referring to himself as “it” and his corporeal form as “the ruin”, this deeply sad essay describes something that we cannot avoid calling a psychotic break—even if it was a “voluntary” one. Land escaped from the bounds of reason, and “delighted” himself almost to death.\n\nLibidinal Materialism & Neorationalism\n\nIt would be trivially true to say that Land “took things a bit too far”. Not just trivial, but to a large extent missing the point. Indeed, Land went mad, but what does it really mean to go mad? If you’re main aim is to escape to the greatest extent possible from the bounds imposed on human thought and practice by “the Human Security System”, then concepts like “mad” don’t really apply anymore. To call someone “mad” who is attempting to escape from the sphere of the human and let the death-drive rip, when the whole concept of madness depends on a normative framework that exists solely for the promotion of humanistic concerns, is an exercise in futility.\n\nSo what am I going to do now? Am I going to make the case for some kind of centrism, some moderate defence of The Human Security System? I rather hope not, but let’s see what happens. Indeed, a posthumanist view of philosophy and idea generation certainly requires that we move beyond the Kantian notion of autonomous reason dominating the passions, and moreover beyond any notion of ideas emanating from an autonomous human agency. This is not an entirely new perspective: we have Ancient Greek Muses putting ideas into the mind of the artist, Foucault’s vision of the enunciator “enveloped in words, borne way beyond all possible beginnings”, Heidegger’s “Die Sprache spricht”, Burrough’s words as viruses, Dawkins’ social practices as memes etc. etc.\n\nBut there is actually little justification in Land’s work for giving way to the death-drive entirely. After all, what agent is there to do the giving away? While it is true that the human subject is not a god-like autonomous agent giving birth to discouse and praxis ex nihilo, it is still the case that the human subject (contingently) is something and does something. The human subject may do little more than serve as a space for ideas to work themselves out, but it doesn’t have to be an entirely unstructured space. Just because reason is not autonomous doesn’t mean that reason should be done away with altogether. If the human mind can serve as a filter, processor or transmitter in the process of idea and practice generation, there’s no particular reason to say that it shouldn’t.\n\nLand was right to give a lot more space to practice, experimentation and even transgression than most philosophers have, but his experiment in letting the death-drive wreak utterly unchecked havoc on his person is one that doesn’t bear repeating. What is the problem with prophets and madmen? Their mouths are like sluice gates. Even philosophy with a thoroughly artistic bent must still pass some kind of judgment, must still distinguish between that which is commendable and that which is bilge. Perhaps we could say that reason is like an immune system; yes, it can be over-protective, but discard it entirely and you will be ravaged with the most ghastly memetic pathogens. Oh dear, we’ve arrived back at the Human Security System, haven’t we? Oh well.\n\nIt is also not entirely clear that discarding reason is a surefire way to escape from the humanistic bind; reason itself has a certain inherent inhumanity to it. What kind of figure do we regard as the most inhuman? The unbridled hedonist? No: the psychopath, the man (it’s almost always a man) of cold, hard, unyielding rationality. Men sitting around a table calmly discussing nuclear war, and using the term “megadeath”. The serial killer calmly describing how he subdued and dissected his victim. It is not Colonel Kurtz’s alleged “madness” that makes him so horrifying; it is his cold, hard rationality. No wonder then why Nick Land has chosen “Coldness be my god” as his Twitter bio, and claimed that the “colder variants” of accelerationism will be the ones that win out.\n\nPerhaps the bounds of humanity lie more deeply in affect than they do in the rational. Perhaps Kant was mistaken in believing that the rational could save human rightness from the onslaught of desire-driven annihilation. After all, rationality can just as equally be an annihilating force: it is before reason and careful, cold analysis that most sacred cows are claimed to fall. Morality, god, folk psychology, all supposedly slain by reason in the modern age. Reason, according to Kant, decides you should tell the murderer where your child is, regardless of how inhuman that may seem. Reason, just like matter, has its own logic beyond the power of the human will. We are after all “led” to conclusions. Then again, it could be that reason is simply signing death warrants for sacred cows, rather than exacting their executions itself.\n\nRegardless, within the accelerationism-adjacent philosophical community, there has certainly been a stark move towards reason in recent times, culminating in the movement now known as neorationalism. This movement, exemplified most prominently by the transcendental-nihilist science worship of Ray Brassier and the Analytic-inspired works of Reza Negarastani, posits a de-subjectified conception of reason and intelligence, but nonetheless still holds reason up as something paramount. There are no appeals to letting the death-drive wreak havoc. Instead Negarastani, in his “The Labour of the Inhuman”, suggests that reason plays a central role in continually reconfiguring our understanding of what humanity is, and allowing us to move beyond outdated humanist conceptions.\n\nThe debate between neorationalism and libidinal materialism is a live one, and will definitely not be settled in this blog post. It would in fact require an entirely separate post to even lay out the basic issues at hand. Nonetheless, we have made decent progress here in clarifying what was meant by Land adopting a less top-down stance to the elaboration of his beliefs, and the philosophical roots of his committed experimentalism. Any understanding of knowledge, truth and philosophy that survives beyond the collapse of the humanist edifice must spring from, and of course also be thoroughly instantiated in, critique that is compatible with a materialist ontology. Further, any philosophy that wants to avoid becoming intellectualised projectile vomit must engage in analysis as well as synthesis, and so must first find a way to reconcile both with an acceptable framework."
