PREFACE This volume contains 54 articles and notes which I have written from time to time and published in The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, The Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies , The Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal , The Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society, and the Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenlandischen Gesellschaft. I am greatly obliged to the Editors of these journals fpr permission to reprint them. They give a fair representation of the kind of linguistic work which appeals to me, a study of the pronunciation (phonetics), history, grammar, and poetry of languages, especially those of North India. The principal languages dealt with are Urdu, Hindi, Panjabi, Shina (Sina), Kanaurl, Nepali, and Rajasthani. I regret Kashmiri is not represented except in one note. When I was in India I spent a large part of many holidays in reducing to writing unknown or little known languages spoken by illiterate people. It is a fascinating occupation, and as one looks back on it there rises to memory an array of delightful and variegated scenes, and the mind dwells on happy experiences of long ago. The only example in this book of that kind of work is the grammar of Kanaurl, a Tibeto- Burman language of considerable interest. Hebrew and Arabic come into an appendix. All but two of the articles have been written in England during the last fifteen years. A list of the subjects discussed will be found in the table of contents. * T. GRAHAME BAILEY, June , 1938.

B.S.O.S., II, 3, 549-554 184 URDU : THE NAME AND THE LANGUAGE Part I Epitome . — Urdu was born in 1027 ; its birthplace was Lahore, its parent Old Panjabi ; Old Khar! was its step- parent ; it had no direct relationship with Braj. The name Urdu first appears 750 years later. The problem of Urdu has not yet been solved. This note is written with a view to crystallizing thought about the matter, and is of necessity more summary than would be desirable if limitations of space had not to be considered. Perhaps the most important date in the history of Urdu is 1027, the year in which Mahmud Gaznavl annexed the Panjab. He had already made expeditions into the country, but in that year he formally claimed possession of it and settled troops in the capital, Lahore. To 1027 may be assigned the birth of Urdu. At that time these Persian-speaking soldiers began to live among a people whose language was old Panjabi, to mix with them, to have intercourse with them, and, we cannot doubt, to learn their language. The contrary idea that the people all began to speak Persian may be dismissed. The army must have used this old form of Panjabi, not very different in those days from the early Khari Boll of Delhi, but they introduced Persian words and possibly phrases. This means simply that they must have begun to speak early Urdu. For 160 years Mahmud Gaznavl and his successors held the Pan jab ; it was wrested from them in 1187. lor the second time the country was seized by men who spoke Persian. This time the conqueror was Muhammad Gori whose servant Qutb ud Din Aibak captured Delhi in 1193 and became the first Sultan on the death of his master in 1206. It seems clear [i] 392 URDU : THE NAME AND THE LANGUAGE that his troops made friends with the soldiers whom they defeated in Lahore, and that the two armies went on to Delhi leaving a sufficient force to keep open the lines of communication ; for Aibak cannot have annihilated the fighting men in Lahore and he would not have permitted the menace of a hostile army in his rear. We may conclude that a considerable number of those who entered Delhi with Qutb ud Din Aibak already spoke early Urdu. This language, altered by the influence of the new troops who spoke Persian, and of the city people whose language was old Kharl, developed into later Urdu. This sketch of the origin of Urdu suggests that we should regard Lahore, not Delhi, as its birthplace, and early Panjabi as its parent language. Unfortunately we have no means at present of ascertaining what Panjabi at that time was like ; we feel sure, however, that it had not diverged far from old Kharl. We may dismiss Braj from our calculations ; there is no reason to think that it had any direct connection with Urdu. When Urdu was born in 1027 Panjabi was only entering the modern stage. Although we can hardly doubt the general course of events, we do not get on to firm ground till 1326, when Muhammad Tuglaq invaded the Deccan and founded Daulatabad. We know that his troops spoke Urdu ; and when in 1347 ‘Ala ud Din Bahmani revolted against him and ascended the throne as the first ruler of the Bahmani dynasty, his state made Urdu its official language. If it be objected that there is not complete proof of some of the above statements, we can admit that fact, but point out that the proof is stronger than for the hitherto accepted view that Urdu began in Delhi during the Mugal period. Indian writers usually consider that the royal camp in Delhi was first called the urdu by the Emperor Babur in his work, Tuzuk i Baburi. It may be so. He was a Turkl who came from Turkistan in 1526 and naturally spoke of his urdu ; but the word is found in the J ahakusha of JavainI, 1150, e.g. vol. i, p. 162 : — * M URDU : THE NAME AND THE LANGUAGE 393 dar urdu e shtihztidagtin dar natavanand timed, “ they cannot enter the camp of the princes ” ; and on p. 148 : — dar andarun i urdu tirnadand l, “ they came into the camp.” There seems to be no reason why the army in Lahore or Delhi should not have been called the urdu several centuries earlier than Babur. When does the word Urdu first occur as the name of a language ? It became common in Lucknow after 1846 and in Delhi after 1857. We must make a sharp distinction between Urdu, used by itself as a proper name, and zabdn i Urdu ; for we cannot be sure that zabdn i Urdu is a name ; it may be a mere description, “ the language of the army.” Perhaps the earliest example of the word standing alone and bearing the sense of Urdu language is in Mushafi, 1750-1824 : — Khuda raklche zabd ham ne sum hai Mir o Mirzd Jcl Kahe ki$ muh se ham ai Mushafi Urdu hamtiri hai ? “ I have heard the language of Mir and Sauda ; how can I dare to assert that Urdu is my language ? ” We are unable to say in what year these words were written. Mushafi may have composed the verse any time after he was grown up. He was a recognized poet in 1776. J. B. Gilchrist, writing in 1796, mentions the name as well known. His words are : ** In the mixed dialect also called Oordoo or the polished language of the Court, and which even at this day pervades the vast provinces of a once powerful Empire ” (A Grammar of the Hindoostaruie Language, p. 261). As we do not know the date of Mushafi s lines we must admit that Gilchrist may have been the first person who in literature used Urdu as the name of the language. Jules Bloch has made a striking suggestion, which he admits is only an intuitive feeling requiring to be substantiated by proof, that the name Urdu is due to Europeans. In this connection it is important to note that Gilchnst in the sentence just quoted mentions Oordoo as a name already 394 URDU I THE NAME AND THE LANGUAGE established. His statement seems to make it clear that Indians used the word. Gilchrist himself always called the language 44 Hindoostanee W. H. Bay ley in an English and 4 4 Hindoostanee ” thesis, 1802, which may be consulted in the British Museum, says 4 * the language which I have specified by the name of Hindoo- stanee is also frequently denominated Hindee, Oordoo, Moosulmanee and Rekhtu Sayyid Insha in Darya e Latdfat , 1807 (Lucknow ed., p. 2), writes : Khusk baydndn % djd muttafiq shuda az zabaJid e muta - ‘addad alfaz i dilcasp judd namuda o dm ba l zi ‘ibarat bakdr bur da zabane taza sivd e zabahd e digar rasanidand o ba urdu mausuvn sakhtand : 4 4 the good speakers of Delhi united in separating attractive words from several languages and using them in sentences ; in this way they produced a new language, different from other languages, and called it Urdu/’ Mir Amman in the preface to Bag o Bahdr , 1802, gives an account of the birth of Urdu, and though he never uses the word alone (he says U rdu ki zaban) it is clear from the whole context that he is thinking of a definite name. We conclude that while Farsi and Hindi had for long been used as proper names Urdu did not receive similar recognition till near the dawn of the eighteenth century. The phrase zaban i urdu e miialld seems to occur for the first time in Mir's NiJcdt ush Shu'ard, 1752. On p. 1 of the Badayu edition he says : poshtda na mdnad ki dar farm i rekkta ki shi l re$t baiaur i shi'r i Farsi ba zaban i Urdu e mu alia e Shdhjakandbdd Dikii kitabe ta hal tasnif na shuda : “ we must remember that up to the present no book has been written on the art of Rekhta % which is poetry in the style of Persian poetry but in the language of the roval camp of Delhi.” Here urdu e mu 1 alia may possibly mean fasih aur mustanad Urdu, the idiomatic and authoritative Urdu of Delhi. Two years later Qaim writes in Makhzan i Nikdt (Auran- gabad ed., 33) : — [ 4 ] URDU : THE NAME AND THE LANGUAGE 395 aksare az tarkibat i Furs ki mudfiq i muhdvara e urdu e mu alia manus i gosh meyaband minjumla e javdz ul abydn me danand : “ most Persian constructions which strike their ears as familiar from the point of view of the idiom of the royal camp they regard as among the things lawful in poetry.” Here, too, the phrase may mean “ correct Urdu idiom ”, and the author may not be thinking of the army. But as Mir and Qaim appear always to use Hindi or Rekhta as the name of the language we should perhaps translate “ the language, or idiom, of the army Mlr’s son, ‘Arsh, who lived well into the nineteenth century,’ says : — * ham hai Urdu e mu alia ke zabdda ai ( Arsh mustanad hai jo kucch irshdd kiya karte hai “ I speak the Urdu e Mu‘alla language and what I say is authoritative The date of the lines is unknown. The author’s father died in 1799 at tha age of 86 (not in 1810, as usually stated). Finally, Muhammad ‘Ata Husain in Nau Tarz i Murassa \\ 1798, speaks of zaban i urdu e mu‘ alia. Mr. G. M. Qadrl has drawn my attention to two MSS. which contain perhaps the earliest instances of the use of zaban i urdu without further description. The references are : — Tazkira e Gulzar i Ibrahim , by ‘All Ibrahim KM, 1783 (speaking of Vasalat Kh a Sabit), tatahbu 1 i zaban i urdu namuda, “ he followed the Urdu language,” or “ the language of the urdu ”, i.e. devoted attention to it. Tazkira e Shu'ara e Hindi , by MushafI, 1794 (speaking of Muhammad Am an Nisar), add e zaban i urdu i “ the style of the Urdu language,” or “ of the language of the urdu The problem op the name. It is always stated that the language was originally described as the speech of the army or camp, zaban i urdu t and that gradually the word zaban 396 URDU: THE NAME AND THE LANGUAGE was dropped, leaving urdu to stand alone. This explanation gives rise to a great difficulty. We have seen that Urdu was first used by itself in the poems of Mushafi. We may perhaps guess the date of the couplet in which the word appears as the year 1790, when the author was 40. We are now faced by the fact that the first instance of the use of the word was 763 years after the establishment of the army in Lahore, almost 600 years after the urdu was settled in Delhi, and 261 years after Babur called his camp the Urdu e Mu 1 alia. The Urdu language had been in existence for about 750 years before anyone gave it, in writing at any rate, the name by which it is now always known. Even if we take the earlier date, 1752, when Mir described it as the language of the royal camp, we deduct only thirty -eight years from our figures. None of the historians of the Mugal period ever used the name. We have to answer three questions : — • (1) Why was there a delay of centuries in giving the name Urdu ? (2) If a new name had to be given in the eighteenth century, why was this name chosen for the language when it had many, many years previously been given up for the army ? (3) If the army was not called urdu till Babur’s time, 1526, the language which had then existed for nearly 500 years must already have had a name. Why was that name given up ? It is easier to state the problem than to solve it. I see no solution except this : that some name or description such as zabdn i urdu was in conversational use from the time when the army was first called urdu ) and that very gradually, hundreds of years later, it crept into books, possibly earlier than we are now aware of, while the use of Urdu alone was still later. I feel the inadequateness of this, but perhaps it will lead to something fuller. We must always remember that in early days Urdu literature was not so accurate a reflection of daily life and speech as it is now, and there may have been much in ordinary talk which found no echo in books. [ 6 ] URDU : THE NAME AND THE LANGUAGE 397 Part II In the eighteenth century and earlier Hindi (sometimes TT* 3 -A -Li-- .1 f _ i 1 • i 398 URDU : THE NAME AND THE LANGUAGE Saib, in Rekhta he regards Vail as his master. 5 ’ See Ab i Haydtj ed. 1917, p. 115. Mir Hasan, d. 1786, uses Hindi or Rekhta and avoids Urdu. In his anthology, 1776, he has the phrase : tazkira e suldian afrindn i Hindi , “ an anthology of Urdu poets ” (p. 40). Even Shah ‘Abdul Qadir in his well-known Urdu translation of the Qur’an uses the name Hindi : is me zabdn i rekhta nahl boli balki Hindi e muta'araf hi * avdmm ko be takalluf darydft ho ; “I have not used Rekhta in my translation, but well-known Urdu that ordinary people might easily under- stand it Mir, 1713-99, Sauda, 1713-80, and Qaim (d. about 1790) use the word Rekhta very often. I will content myself with one quotation from Mir : mazbut kaise kaise kahe rekhte vale , samjha na koi men zabd is diyar me. “ What fine Urdu verse I have written, but no one in these parts understands me ”, The name Hindi requires no comment. It was the natural word to use in early times. Several explanations have been given of Rekhta. a Persian word which means “ poured ”, and has no literary signification in Persian. The most important are the following : — (1) Urdu is called Rekhta because Arabic and Persian words were poured into it. (2) Reldita means “ down and out ”, and Urdu was at first regarded as something contemptible. (3) It means verses in two languages, and at first Urdu and Persian were used side by side. (4) It is a musical term introduced by Amir Khusrau indicating the application of the music of one language to the words of another. (5) It means a wall firmly constructed of different materials, as Urdu is of diverse linguistic elements. This is the opposite of (2). [S] URDU : THE NAME AND THE LANGUAGE 399 Saflr Bilgraml in Jalva e Khizr says that the name Rekhta has been in use since the time of Shahjahan. This requires proof. Other early names may be mentioned. According to Mahmud Shiran! zabdn i Dihlavi was used by Amir Khusrau (d. 1324) and by Abu’l Fazl (in Ain i Akbari ), Shah Hatim in the preface to his Divanzada quoted above calls Urdu “ rozmarra e Bihli ” : rozmarra e Dihli ki Mirzdidn i Hind dar muhavara drand manzur darad , “ I have accepted the daily speech of Delhi which is the idiom of the Mirzas of India.” Again : rozmarra rd ki * dm fahm o Mass pasand bdshad ikhtiyar namud, “ I have chosen the daily speech under- stood by all and liked in select circles.” (As has been noted before he refers to himself in the third person.) To turn to DakanI writers. Shah Mira Jl, d. 1496, a famous religious writer, who preached and wrote in Urdu, explains that he wrote in “ Hindi ” in order that people might under- stand : yeh bold Hindi sab , is arid ke sababb , “ I am saying all this in Urdu for this reason ”. His son, Shah Burhan ud Din, d. 1582, says in his poem Irshad Ndma *aib na rakhe Hindi bol f “ do not blame me for using Urdu.” He also calls it Gujrl, which is not unnatural, for his language is marked by many Gujrati features : je hoe gyan bicari, na dekhe bhakhd Gujri (Hujjat ul Baqd) “ learned people will not look at Gujrl ” i.e. Urdu. yeh sab kid Gujri zabd ( Irshad Ndrm) “ I have done all this in Gujrl (Urdu) ”. VajhI, the famous author of Qutb Mushtari , 1609, referred to in the India Office Catalogue as nameless and anonymous, wrote in 1634 a prose work Sab Ras . After the ascriptions of praise he proceeds : dgaz i ddstan ba zabdn i Hindostan, “ here begins the story in the language of Hindustan, i.e. the Urdu of Delhi as distinguished from DakanI. [93 400 The dialect of the Deccan was often called Dakni or Da khan I, e.g. Rustamfs Khdvarndma , 1649, Khavarnama e Dakni kita Jiu nam “ I have called it the Dakni Khavaranama ” (last line but five). Shah Malik’s Shari at Ndma , 1666, Dakhani me holyd hai saf ’ said it plainly in Dakhani.” (This author is mistakenly called “ Shah Mulk 95 in the India Office Cat.) [io] BAQIR AG AH AND THE DATE OF THE NAME URDU 399 BAQIR AG AH AND THE DATE OF THE NAME URDU In JRAS Apr., 1930, pp. 391-400, under the heading “ Urdu : the Name and the Language ” I discussed inter alia the question of when the word was first used by itself as the name of a language, and said that the first definitely datable instance I could find was in Gilchrist’s Grammar of the Hindoostanee Language , 1796, p. 261, but that a couplet from one of Mushaffs poems, date unknown, was probably earlier. Another quotation, which also might be earlier, was from Mlr’s son ‘Arsh. Since then I have not been able to get anything which certainly bears a date before 1796, but the following facts are worth recording as a further contribution to the subject. Mm Hasan. — The Tazkira e Hasan , a tazkira by the famous poet Mir Hasan, has been published with the title of Tazkira e Shu'ard e Urdu. Mir Hasan died in 1786 and the work itself was written about ten years before his death ; it appears, therefore, at first sight, as if here we had an instance twenty years before Gilchrist’s Grammar. I do not think, however, that the title of the book is authentic. There is no proof that Mir Hasan ever used the word “ Urdu He refers to his anthology on its first page as a tazkira e sulchan dfrinan i Hindi , an anthology of Hindi poets, meaning Urdu poets. Baqir Agah. — The word “ Urdu occurs in the intro- duction to the Uhdn i Hindi of Muhammad Baqir Agah, 1745-1805, a prolific writer in Arabic, Persian, and both dialects of Urdu (the southern dialect spoken in the Deccan, and the northern spoken in Delhi). He was a spiritual disciple of Sayyid AbuT Hasan Qurba, 1705-68, and belonged to the Deccan, being a native of Ellore. Our chief source of informa- tion about him is the Tazkira Gulzar i A'zatn, the compiler and author of which was Muh. Gaus Kha. It is an anthology of Karnatak (Carnatic) poets, begun in 1841 and printed in 1855, the year of the author’s death. Other authorities 400 BAQIR AGAH AND THE DATE OF THE NAME URDU which may be consulted are Fikrist Urdu Ma Jcht utdt i Kutubkhana e Kulliya e Jdmi‘a e ‘ Usmaniya e Haidarabad Dakan, pp. 17-21, 127^8; Urdu, Apr., 1929, pp. 281-318 ; and Urdu ke Asdlib i Baydn , pp. 30 and 32 (only a few lines). Agah frequently refers to the well-known Delhi poet Sauda, who died in 1780, and indeed sometimes pokes fun at him, as in the following couplet : Agah gar sune namktn nazm tin Saudd kahe ki shir se mere namak gaya 0 Agah, if Sauda hears this tasty poem of thine, he will say * ‘ all the taste has gone out of my verses One of his numerous works was the Divan i Hindi, a book of qasidas, gazals , rubd'is, qit‘as and other poems, almost all in Urdu, the majority in Persian metres, but some in Hindi metres such as the doha and the kabitt. To this Divan he wrote a prose dibdca, or introduction, of great interest. It was published in Urdu, Apr., 1929. From a perusal of it we get valuable information. Amongst other things we learn that he used the name Hindi ” for “ Urdu ”, whether Delhi Urdu or Daknl, but that when he wished to distinguish the language of Delhi from that of the Deccan he used the terms “ Urdu ” and “ Daknl ” (or “ Dakhnl ”), while verses in either dialect he called rekhte. We have thus the following terms as employed by him : — Hindi for the Urdu language, whether northern or southern. Urdu for the language of Delhi. Daknl for the variety of Urdu spoken in the Deccan. rekhte for verses in either dialect of Urdu (both Persian and Hindi metres). The fact that he confines the name “ Urdu ” to the Delhi dialect and does not include Daknl is very important. Another interesting Urdu work is Fardid dar Favaid. This has not been published, but a MS. exists in the Library of the Osmaniyeh University in Hyderabad. In the Dibdca to the Divan i Hindi he uses the word Urdu BAQIR AG AH AND THE DATE OP THE NAME URDU 401 three times. As he was born in 1745 and began writing verse in his fifteenth year, he might have spoken of Urdu any time after 1759. The question to be decided, therefore, is the date of the Dibaca , which is nowhere given. We begin our study of it with high hopes that we may be able to put it between 1765 and 1775, and so claim for the use of the term Urdu (as the name of a language) a date twenty or thirty years earlier than 1796, when Gilchrist’s work appeared. Alas for such hopes ! It soon becomes abundantly clear that the Dibaca cannot have been written before 1795 and may have been later. In the second quarter of it he refers to his Hasht Bihishtybegan in 1791, in the last quarter he mentions his Riyaz i Jinan , written in 1792, and to his Fardid dar bay an i Favaid , which was not written till 1795. The authority for the date of Riyaz i Jinan is a quotation from a MS. of the work in the Osmaniyeh University (UrdUy Apr., 1929, p. 292), as follows : — jab the bar a sau aur sat bar as tab band hai yeh nuskha e aqdaSy in the year 1207, was written this holy book. The date of the Faraid f given on the same page, is taken from another MS. in the University, but no sentence is quoted. Just before the reference to Riyaz i Jinan we read these words : yeh haqir i ndras ake tis battxs baras ke kyd Farsi aur kyd Hindi me sab aqsdm shir me nazm kid thd , this unworthy despicable person (the author) thirty or thirty-two years ago wrote poetry in every style of verse, whether Persian or Urdu : (dke is, of course, for age). This suggests that he had been writing verse for thirty-two years. If to this we add, say, 14| years, his age when he began writing, we get 46J, the equivalent of 45 of our years. That brings us to 1790. But it may well be that he dated from a few years after his fifteenth year, and in that case we get back to 1795 or later. We arrive at the reluctant conclusion that Baqir Agah s Dibaca to his Divan i Hindi does not furnish us with a date before 1796 for the use of the word Urdu. We may now proceed to quotations illustrative of the 402 BAQIR AGAH AND THE DATE OF THE NAME URDU terms Urdu, Daknl, Hindi, and rekhte. We cannot say to what extent, if any, Agah pronounced the izafat , so I omit it whenever it is not marked in the text. (a) A few lines after the beginning of the Dibdca : malchfi na rahe ki rekhta bajuz muhavra Hindi ke sab amur me Farsi kd tabi e hai , let us not forget that Urdu verse, apart from its being in the Hindi language (i.e. Urdu), follows Persian in everything. (6) Faraid dar Favdid , ii. 5, 6. Yeh nuskha garez hai Hindi me manzum Yihi hai ijmdl se zikr us kd marqum Although this book is in Urdu verse and this is in brief an account of it. (c) After discussing different classes of poems in the Dibdca, he says agar shu'ara e Dakhan alfaz mazkur ko zer zabar kare to canda muzaiqa nahi rakhta hai kya vaste ki unho tasfiya muhavra me is qadr jadd o kadd nahi kie balchildf sahiban muhavra Urdu ki is bdb me sa‘i balig kar kar us roz - marra ko muhavra Farsi kd ham pahlu kar die , if the poets of the Deccan make alterations in the words I have mentioned (Arabic and Persian words), it doesn't matter very milch, for they have not made great efforts to purify the language, in contradistinction to those who talk (or write) Delhi Urdu ; they with their enormous efforts in this matter have made that form of speech equal in dignity to Persian. (d) A little over a page further on he writes of his romance, Gulzar i 1 Ishq , is kd muhavra ba'ainhi muhavra Urdu kd hai magar kahi kahi ta ( alamat vataniyyat Dakan baqi rahi , its language is absolutely Delhi Urdu, but in places there are signs of my belonging to the Deccan. (e) About a page from the end of the Dibaca he winds up a long sentence with the words id yeh majmua agarci mukhtasar hai sab aqsam i sukhan par mushtamil rahe aur ise muhavra Urdu se makhsus kar dia y in order that this collection of poems, though short, may include every kind of poetry ;^and I have used Delhi Urdu exclusively for it. 403 (/) b(iz ‘ ulama e mutaa khkh inn khulasa 'arabi Jcitabo kd nikdlkar Farsi me likhe hai td voh bg jo 'Arabi nahi park sakte hai in se fdida pave , lekin aksar * aarta aur tamam ddmid Farsi se bhi dshnd nahi hai is lie yeh ‘dsi batabb unke bahut ikhtisar ke sath lekar Dakni risab me bold hai , some scholars of recent times have made a summary in Persian of their Arabic works in order that those who cannot read Arabic* may profit by them, but few women and not all men know even Persian ; so this rebel (the author), at their request has spoken very briefly in Dakni tracts. (Quoted in Urdu ke asalib i baydn , p. 33.) (g) In the Dibdca f just before the quotation in (c) above, he says aksar rekhjta koya alfaz mashhur 4 Arabi o Farsi ko zer o zabar karte hai , generally writers of Urdu verse change well- known Arabic and Persian words. 82 . * [i5l THE DATE OF OLD URDU COMPOSITION : A CAVEAT In attempting to assign a date to any given piece of Urdu prose or verse we are in danger of being influenced to a great extent by its likeness or unlikeness to the Urdu of to-day, and assuming that if it does not differ much from modern Urdu it cannot be old. But in this we prejudge a question of prime importance, one which, so far as I know, has never been discussed in books on Urdu literature, viz. whether the author was writing more or less as he was in the habit of speaking, or was aiming at literary style. It is not the case, as one might be inclined to think, that all Urdu writers have striven after literary effect, though it is unfortunately true that affectation and artificiality very soon began to eat the life out of their poetry. Over Persianization was perhaps due in the first place to the fact that Muslim religious terms came to India through a Persian medium, and that the oldest writers were earnest propagandists who had to use many Persian theological words, or Arabic words which had reached them through Persian. Further the only poetry the Urdu writers knew was Persian. It was therefore natural that they should fall at first under the sway of the foreign tongue, which had, in fact, been the native tongue of the ancestors of some of them. It was, on the other hand, quite unnatural afterwards that men who spoke good racy Urdu in their homes, should fill their poetry with exotic phrases and sentiments. In the early days composition was more natural than in later times, and Dakhani authors were readier to use the Urdu of every day than those who lived in Delhi. The difference between natural and artificial Urdu is almost inconceivably great. A few examples will make this clear. 1. Examples of Urdu striving after literary effect. (a) In 1732 FazlI wrote a translation of a Persian work, Dak Majlis , imagining it to be the first translation from 890 THE DATE OF OLD URDU COMPOSITION : A CAVEAT Persian into “ Hindi It is a striking comment on the ignorance of Dakhani literature among the writers of North India that such an idea should have been possible, or that Azad should have regarded the preface to that translation as the first work in Urdu prose. Actually prose had been written in Urdu for centuries before this. The subjoined quotation is punctuated as in Azad’s Ab i Hayat , 1917, p. 23. Fazli says : phir dil me guzra ki aise ham ko ‘aql cdhiye kdmil aur madad kisu taraf ki hoe shamil kyuki be taid i Samadi aur be madad ijandb i Ahmadi — yih mushkil surat piztr na hove — aur gauhar i murad rishta e maiddn me na ave — lihdzd is san'cti ka nahi hud — mukhtari ‘ — aur ab tak tarjuma e Farsi ba Hbdrat i Hindi nap nahi hud — mustama 1 — pas is andesha e ‘amiq me gota khaya — aur bay aba n i idammvX o tadhir me sargashta hud — lekin rah maqsud ki na pal — nagdh nasim i ‘ indy at i llahi dil i afgar par ihtizaz me a — yth bat dina e khdtir me muh dikhldl. “ Then it came into my mind that for such work one needs perfect intelligence and must get help from somewhere ; because without Divine strength and the help of Muhammad this difficulty will not take form (meaning, rather strangely, ‘ disappear’), and the jewel aimed at will not come into the relation of expectation ; so no one has invented this art, and a Persian translation in Hindi prose has not been heard of. I was therefore plunged in deep anxiety and wandered in the desert of hesitation and policy unable to find the way I wanted ; suddenly the breath of the grace of God came fluttering on my wounded heart, and this matter showed its face in the mirror of my mind.’’ Sauda, 1713^80, who is often considered the greatest master of words in Urdu, though not the greatest poet, wrote a prose version of Mir’s Shu'la e * Ishq . The date is not known, but it is some years later than Fazli s preface just mentioned. The following is an extract from the preface (say 1755) quoted by Azad [ 17 ] THE DATE OF OLD URDU COMPOSITION : A CAVEAT 891 zamir i munir par ainadaran i mdni ke mubarhan ho hi mahz ' indy at Haqq Ta-ald ki hai jo tuti e natiqa shirt sukhan ho — pas yih cand mxsre ‘ ki az qabil i rekhta dur i rekhta khdma e do zabdn a pm s: safh e kdgaz par tahrir pde — Idzim hai ki tahvil i sukhan 1 Sami' a sanjan % rozgar karu — ta zabdni in ashkhds ki hamesha maurid i tahsin o dfrtn rahu — mazmun slna me besh az murg i asir nahi — ki bic qafs ke jis vaqt zabdn par dyd far gad i bulbul hai vdste gosh i dddras ke—garaz jis ahl i sukhan kd dur i munsif zvnat i lab hai sarrishta e husn ma'am kd is kaldm ke is se insdf talab hai — agar Haqq Ta'dla ne subh kdgaz i safed ki mdnind i sham syah karne ko yih kkdksar khalq kiyd hai — to har insan ke fanus i dimag me drag i hosh diya hai — cahiye ki dekhkar nukta cini hare varna gazand i zahr aluda se be- ajal kahe ko mare . “ Let it be demonstrated to the enlightened minds of the mirror holders of semantics that it is only through the gift of Almighty God that the parrot of utterance attains sweet speech ; so these few lines of poured out pearls in Reldbta style from my bilingual pen have been written on paper. It is fitting that I should commit them to the hearing of the poets of to-day, so that at the mouth of those men I should be the object of praise and commendation. A theme in one’s heart is no better than a captive bird in a cage, but when it gets utterance it is the plaint of the bulbul for the appreciative ear. Therefore this composition in the beauty of its thoughts appeals for justice to those whose lips are adorned by the pearls of impartiality. If God Almighty has created this unworthy one for the purpose of blackening white paper just as evening darkens the day, He has also put intelligence in everyone’s brain like the candle under the shade ; so people should criticize, for why should one die before one’s time from envenomed grief ? ” Let us quote from Sayyid Insha, a passage written about 1780 :~~ 1 Mistake for sami'a e sukhan. 892 THE DATE OF OLD URDU COMPOSITION : A CAVEAT ibtidd e sinn i sika ta avail i rai‘dn — aur avail rai‘an se ila’l an ishtiyaq i md Id yutdq i taqbil i ‘atba i ‘ dliya na bahadde thd — ki silk tahrir o taqrir me muntazam ho sake — lihazd be vasta o vaslla hdzir hud hu. “ From the dawn of childhood to my early youth, and from early youth to now there have been no bounds to the in con- trollable desire I have felt to kiss your honoured threshold in order that my writing and speaking might be set in order like a necklace of pearls. Accordingly without cause or inter- mediary I have presented myself.” 2. Examples of natural, unartificial Urdu. To make the contrast more vivid we take first a couple of sentences from the same writer, Sayyid Insha. The following words, though ostensibly quoted, are his own. See Darya e Lafafat , p. 49. How different they are from the un-Urdu nonsense just quoted : — aji do Mir sahib turn to ‘Id ke cand ho gae. Drill me ate the do do pahr rat tak baithte the aur rekhte parhte the. Lakhnau me tumhe kyd ho gayd ki kabhi tumhard'asar dsdr ma‘lum na hud aisd na kljiyo kahl at ho me bhl na calo, tumhe ‘AH kl qasm at ho me muqar rar caliyo. “ Well, my dear sir, you've become as hard to find (and as welcome when found) as the new moon before the big feast. There was a time when on your visits to Delhi you used to come and sit in my house till midnight reciting your verses. I don’t know what’s happened to you in Lucknow, that there’s not a trace of you anywhere. Whatever you do don’t fail to turn up for the Eighth. I adjure you by ‘ All come without fail for the Eighth.” It is not easy to believe that one man wrote both these extracts, but it is amusing to notice that in the last line of the first quotation he forgets his literary pose and stumbles into sense. I quote now from Vajhl's Sab Bas, one hundred years older thgn the earliest of the above quotations. Owing to its being in the Dakham dialect, it is not quite easy to translate, but it THE DATE OF OLD URDU COMPOSITION; A CAVEAT 893 is perfectly straightforward ; yet from its date it should be unintelligibly archaic. Mr. G. M. Qadri, on p. 321 of his Urdu Shahpdre , from which the passage is taken, states that the author is Shah Mira Ji. This religious writer died in 1496 ; as I am not aware that he ever wrote anything called Sab Ras , I venture to attribute the words to Vajhi, who wrote Sab Ras in 1634. ‘ ashiq tu use bisar naku, is ki ydd so dil ku shad kar aur apas ku dpi ydd dilata so apas ku dikhldtd hai, ki yu dekho yu meri surat hai munje dekh kd ku be dil hota hai max ata tere nazdik hu aur tu to mujhe nahl dekhta . “ 0 lover of God ! do not forget Him ; by the remembrance of Him make thy heart glad. He reminds people of Himself and reveals Himself, saying * Look hither, this is My form, look at Me ; why art thou dispirited, I am coming, I am near thee and yet thou seest Me not.’ ” In 1668 or a little later Mira Ya‘qub translated Khvaja Burhan ud Din’s Shamail ul Atqid. A few words may be quoted. (After some Arabic) ya‘m ay mominan sabr karo hor ustuvar acho tamhiddt is dyat me tan hor dil hor ruh — yu tino sabr karo kar hukm hud ya‘ni sabr karo tan sd Khudd ki tpdat par — yani farmd barddri raho hor sabr karo apne dil so Khudd ki bald par hor ustuvar acho apne ruh hor sir so, Khudd ke dckhne ke shauq hor muhabbat par. (After the Arabic sentence) that means 0 believers, be patient and firm. The premisses in this verse are body and heart and spirit. To all three comes the command, Be patient ; that is be patient in your body in subjection to God, that is be obedient. And be patient from your heart in the afflictions of God ; and be firm in your spirit and intellect in your desire and love for a sight of God. The extracts which have been given enable us to see that simple style and modern phraseology are not a proof of recent date ; they are merely the signs of conversational Urdu. I regard the fact as extremely important. It is very significant 894 that the passage from Sab Ras , though much simpler than the first quotation from Sayyid Insha, is at least a century and a half earlier ; indeed, if Mr. Qadri is right in saying that Shah Mira Jl is the author, it is three centuries earlier. [21] EARLY URDU CONVERSATION TT is natural that records of the beginnings of Urdu should be almost ^ entirely confined to literature or quasi literature. Yet there are two classes of books which contain references to conversation ; firstly, early lives of holy men (especially in the Deccan and Gujrat), whose followers wrote accounts of their sayings and doings, occasionally quoting actual words : secondly, histories such as those by Firishta and Abu’l Fazl, in which we may find Urdu sentences spoken by emperors or kings. Urdu must often have been employed as the language of conversation in exalted circles even though the official language continued to be Persian. In works by Mahmud ShlranI, Shams Ullah Qadrl, and the late \"Abd ul Hay Nadvl, a few of these early sayings are given (not always in the same form). Some can be so far verified in printed books, others are taken from MSS. and we cannot be certain of their age. However, in spite of our suspicions they have considerable interest. Exhaustive search would no doubt reveal many more. Regarding the question of date, see my note on the “ Date of old Urdu Composition ”, in JR AS., October, 1930, under “ Miscellanea Before proceeding to the scraps of talk I give two lines, said to be found in Babur’s TurkI Divan. It will be seen that a line and a half are Urdu. mujka na hud Jcuj havas mdnak o moti fuqara halina has hulgusidur pam o ruti “ I have no desire for gems or pearls, for (the state of) poor people sufficient are water and bread ”. The MS. is in the library of the Navab of Rampur, and was written in 1529. c. 1260. Shekh Farid ud Din Ganj i Shakar, d. about 1267, used to call a certain friend bhayya “ brother ” ( Asrar ul Awliyd , p. 3). On being asked where intelligence dwelt he replied Inc sir ke “ in the head ” (Malfuzat, p. 40). c. 1350. Somewhere between 1325 and 1357 Khvaja Na$Ir ud Din Cirag, d. 1357, said to his Khalifa, comparing him with another holy man, turn upar ve tale “ you are above, he is below ” ( Firishta , ii, 399). [ 22 ] 206 c. 1400. A sentence by the famous Khvaja Banda Navaz is reported in ‘ Ishq Natna , the work of a disciple ‘Abd Ullah bin Rahman Cishti : bhuko muve su Khudd kach a part a hai Khudd ku aparne ki istiddd hor hai “ does one reach God by dying of hunger ? It is by other means that one reaches God Once a friend said to him : Khvaja Burhan ltd Din bald hai “ Burhati ud Din is exalted He answered : puno kd cdnd bald hai “ £jie full moon is exalted ”. c. 1362. According to the Tdrikh i Firoz! , Firoz Shah Tuglaq, 1351-88, after his successful attack on Sindh, said : barkat Shekh thed ik muva ik nahd “ by the blessing of the Shekh one died one did not The successors of Firoz Shah Tuglaq ordered the expulsion of most of the slaves brought by him from other parts of India. Many hid themselves, and when caught claimed to be inhabitants of Delhi. Like the Ephraimites of old who were asked to say sibolet and said sibolet , these men, it is said, were given a test in pronunciation. They were told to say khard khari, but were not able to say it in the same way as the true city people. c. 1430. Qutb ‘Alam, a famous religious leader in Gujrat, who died between 1446 and 1453, had a son called Siraj ud Din. Shah Barak Allah Cishti gave Siraj ud Din the name of Shah ‘Alam. On hearing this his father remarked Cishtio ne pakdd aur Bukharid ne khdi “the Cishtis cooked it and the Bukharis ate it” (Tuhfat ul Ikrdm, 47, 8). Qutb ‘Alam and Shah ‘Alam were BuDiaris. c. 1430. The Mirat i Sikandari records six sentences. Two are reported of Qutb ‘Alam, who has just been mentioned. We mav put their date as about 1430. Once on his way to early morning prayer he hurt his foot against a solid substance lying on the ground and exclaimed : lohe yd lakkar yd patthar yd kyd hai iron or wood or stone or what is it ? ” It turned out to be a bit of a meteorite with the qualities of all three. When his son Shah Alam s fiancee was taken from him by Muhammad Shah, king of Gujrat, and her less well- favoured sister substituted, Shah ‘Alam complained to his father who replied : beta tussd nasib duhu vijh “ son your fate is (bound up) in both Another version makes the last two words dhua bacca fancifully translated as “ the buffalo and the young one ”, or “ the buffalo and the calf This prophecy was fulfilled, for when the king died his widow went to live with her sister, Shah Alam s wife. On the death of this sister she married Shah ‘Alam. [23l 207 c. 1450. Another sentence is recorded as spoken by Shah ‘Alam himself. Sultan Ahmad Shah of Gujrat sought the life of one of the boy princes, Mahmud Shah, whom Shah ‘Alam was sheltering in his house. The king arrived unexpectedly at the house, but the saint transformed the boy into a venerable man. As the king entered Shah ‘Alam said to the boy : padh dokre “ recite, old man Ahmad Shah, not finding the boy, went away. This Mahmud Shah was king of Gujrat from 1459 to 1511. Once on being insulted he said : riici berl har hnjhare “ every one shakes (the fruit off) a low bar tree c. 1510. To Sikandar Shah, heir apparent, and later king of Gujrat for two and a half months, is attributed the saying : jnr muva murid jogl hum “ the saint is dead, the disciple has become a j<>9 % ” c. 1535. Finally, when Bahadur Shah of Gujrat was betrayed by Rum! Kh a to Humayu in 1535, his parrot fell into Humayu’s hands. It astonished and no doubt amused him by screaming, upon the announcement of Rumi Kha’s arrival : phit Rumi Kha haramkhor , phit Rumi Kha haramkhor “ a curse on Rum! Kha, traitor ”, a sentiment which he had doubtless many times heard expressed in Bahadur Shah’s palace. Shekh Vajlh ud Din ‘Alavi. 1505-90, was another Gujrat saint. His disciples collected his sayings into a book named Bahr ul Haqaiq. The following are some of them : — c. 1570. On hearing that Shekh Fazl Ullah had given up teaching, he said : jab taraqql pakrege tab dpi dars kahege “ when he makes more progress he will of his own initiative give lessons ”. c. 1570. Another saying was : is se har kyd khub hai is dunyd me ki dil Khudd su mashgul hove “ what is better in this world than that the heart should be occupied with God % ” c. 1570. Another was : ‘ arif use kahve jo Khudd su bharyd hove “ we may call him a Knower who is full of God ” c. 1570. Again he said : agar kisi Jcu thofi bhl safd hove jo haram luqma khdve yd haram fid hare to table pave , duje bar bhl pave , tije bar bhl pave “ anyone who has even a little purity, if he eats an unlawful morsel or does an unlawful deed, he will immediately find it out, a second time also he will find it out, a third time aIso~he will find it out This Yajih ud Din had a nephew Shah Hashim ‘Alavi, whose sayings were collected in Maqsud ul ‘ Ashiqln by a disciple. I quote [24] 208 three of them. Two are unfortunately in verse, and therefore less conversational, c. 1600. dunyd chore shekh kahde yih hi jab tujh bhule nae dim shekhi su yak maidan paile jhute diije shaitan “ If anyone leaves the world he is called a shekh ; this world is a mere covering, do not forget that. Religiousness and shekh-hood make up a great plain, the former are false, the latter devils.” These lines are capable of many renderings. After considering a number I have chosen the one which expresses what seems to be the most probable meaning, c. 1600. Hashim ji ki surite bat jinne rakkhi bast bhdt uska jave hate hat “ Listen to what Hashim says, if anyone keeps stale rice, his wealth will disappear.” bap ke ulna deve so put, bap ne deve so suput, bap kd did chine , so kuput il who gives as much as his father, he is a son ; if the father does not give (and yet he gives) he is a good son ; he who seizes what his father gives, is a bad son ”. In the same book the following is quoted from Shah Nizam ud Din, a pupil of Vajlh ud Din : — Nizam, bandagi kare to kyd hove awaljiskd ne dil safd jama sunde me dub raha ose khushbu lagde to kyd nafd <£ when a man worships, then what happens, if his heart is not clean ? If a garment is steeped in perfume, what is the good of putting scent on it ? ” THE WORD HINDUSTAN It has sometimes been said that the only correct spelling of the word is Hindostdn, and that this is proved by its being made to rhvme with bostdn. The fact of its so rhyming can prove only that such a form exists in verse. It does not disprove the correctness of other forms. Some confusion arises from our not knowing exactly which spelling is objected to, whether it is Hindustan or Hindustan or both. There is abundant evidence to show that in Urdu Hindustan is well known and correct. The following points should be noted. (1) The spelling without v do is both Turkish and Persian. This is [25l hod not important, for we are concerned with Hindi and Urdu, not with foreign languages. Turkish generally omits the vao, indeed the word is usually pronounced hindistdn. Ahmad Vahid's English-Turkish Dictionary and Kedhouse's smaller Turkish Dictionary give only this form. Steingass for Persian gives hindusan , Hindustan , and Hindustan. Phillott in his English-Persian gives only Hindustan. Hindustan is, of course, impossible in Persian. As I have said, however, all this is irrelevant. Urdu has nothing to do with the forms of other languages. (2) In speaking Urdu, whether literary or colloquial, people almost always say -us-. Occasionally one hears -o- in pedantic speech, but - us- is practically universal. Professor ‘Abd us Sattar Siddlql, of Allahabad, writes : Urdu bolnevdle ( am taur par is lafz kd talaffuz mahz pesh ke sdth karte hat aur fusaha ki zabdn par bhi Hindustan aur Hindustani hai go ki Hindostdn aur hindostani bhi galat nahi ; ‘\"Urdu speakers usually pronounce this word simply with pesh (i.e. -us-), and correct speakers, too, say Hindustan and Hindustani, although Hindostdn and hindostani are not wrong.” ( Hindustani , 1931, p. 453.) Nur ul Luydt , iv, 992, under “ Hind ”, uses both forms. (3) In a matter like this Urdu books have no more claim to be considered than those in Hindi. The latter almost invariably spell the word Hindustan (rarely hindusthan) ; -o- sometimes occurs when an author is referring to an Urdu or English work which has that spelling. Even if it were the case that the -o- form was the only one in Urdu books and that people trying to speak highflown Urdu always said -o-, there would still be no reason for ignoring the Hindi spelling, md writing -o- in English to the exclusion of -u-. (4) With the approval and active support of the local Governments, two language academies have recently been formed in north India, >ne for Hindi and one for Urdu. Both of these bodies have chosen the lame Hindustani Academy ”, and each of them has a quarterly magazine of considerable interest, one in Hindi, the other in Urdu. he magazines have no connection with one another, the editors, vriters, and contents being entirely different ; but in both cases the itle of the magazine is Hindustani. The choice of name for the two icademies and two magazines gives quadruple support to my thesis. (5) In verse the form depends on the metre. The mutaqdrib net re of the Bustan, the Shahndmeh , and many Urdu masnavis. [26] 1106 such as the Mapinvl e Mir Hasan, does not permit the form Hindustan ; in place of it we must have Hindustan in Persian and Hindostan in Urdu ; but in metres which permit both forms both are found. (6) Professor Siddlql has collected a number of instances of the use of Hindustan in Persian, Urdu, and Arabic literature ( Hindustan , July, Oct., 1931). He quotes the following authors who write in Persian : Mas k ud Sa‘d Salman, five quotations ; Amir Khusrau, twelve quotations ; Muhammad Ibn ‘Umr FarqadI, one ; Shekh Farid ud Din ‘Attar, one ; Jalal ud Din liuml, four ; ‘Abd ur Rahman Jami, one ; Salim Tehran!, three ; Mir Raza Danish MashhadI, one ; ‘Abd ur Razzaq Fayvaz, one ; Nasir ‘All Sarhindi, one ; Amin RazI, one ; Nizami Ganjavi, four ; Ashraf Mazandaranl, two ; Mir ‘Abd ul Jalil Bilgrann, one ; Gulam ‘All Azad BilgramI, one ; Anand Ram Mukhallas, one ; and the Arabic writer Abu ‘Abdullah Muhammad Ansar! (d. a.d. 1327), one. I take a few quotations at random. (i) The last-named writer : balddu Hindustan wa ma l ndku balddu Hind , “Hindustan, i.e. Hind” (p. 634). (ii) Jalal ud Din RumI : salha ml gaskt a qdsid az u gird i Hindustan barae just u ju ‘‘ for years that messenger from him wandered round India for the purpose of investigation ” (p. 625). (iii) Amir Khusrau: Turk i Hindustani m man Hindavi guyamjavdb “ I am a Hindustani Turk, I reply in Hindavi ’’ (p. 627). (iv) Mas‘ud Sa‘d Salman : hi man baqiVa a Su mdnam, u ba Hindustan “ (that) I live in the fort of Su (or fort of unhappiness), he in Hindustan ” (p. 623). Professor Siddlql quotes the Farhang i Anjuman Ara i ftasirl of the time of Nasir ud Din Shah as saving hamcunl Bagdad az Bagdad u paristan az paristan . . . u Hindustan az Hindustan ; “so Bagdad is from Bagdad , jxiristdn from jyarlstdn , and Hindustan from Hindustan He complains that because certain muftis of Urdu preferred to write Hindostani this spelling became fashionable among copyists, sometimes with disastrous results. Thus ^a^ikh_ wrote a tdrikh on the death of Jur'at : — tide Hindustan kd shair mud and one on the death of Snudd : — shd'ir i Hindustan rdraild. But the copyist, like the shopkeeper who put up the sign £< Mens [*7J 1107 and womens conscia recti ”, wanted to improve on other people's work. In both lines he wrote Hindostan , thus adding six years to the life of each of the two poets. Finally he points out that while in Part I of Azad’s lectures the copyist has nearly always written Hind5stan, in Part II another copyist has, after the first page or two, always used Hindustan, which the author himself preferred. This form Hindustan, so well supported by the evidence of literature, almost invariably heard in speech, adopted by both Hindustani Academies, is surely the form which we should employ in English. n [28] THE MEANING AND USAGE OF CAUSAL VERBS IN URDU AND PANJABI I. Meaning rpHE causal of an intransitive verb means to cause someone or something to perform the action which the intr. verb indicates : calnd “ function ”, caland cause something to function About this there is no debate. The question of causals of tr, verbs is not so easy. It is important to be entirely practical, and if we cannot get universal rules we must try to make general rules helpful to both students and scholars. To this end we must, as far as possible, use well-known words, and use them in their ordinary sense. New grammatical terms or old ones with new meanings are worse than useless. A student says : k< How am I to express * make him sleep, make him do it 5 ? May I say usko suldo, usko kardo ? If not, tell me what to say, and give me a rule for it which I can easily follow.’ ’ He is entitled to a reply ; more than that, he is entitled to a reply which will be of real use to him. People speaking of trans. verbs mean verbs ordinarily trans. , for most trans. verbs can, at least on rare occasions, be used intran- sitively (“ This mutton eats well *). Again, nearly all of them may dispense with their object, though retaining their trans. sense. For our present purpose this distinction is unimportant. Thus see and “ hear ” are trans. verbs, but are intrans. in “ the blind see. the deaf hear “ Kill ” is trans., but the object is suppressed in “ if a glance could kill The causals of verbs which are ordinarily trans. mean cause a thing to be done ”, i.e. they are the causals of the passive of the original verb. If we wish to say ‘ 4 he made the blind see and the deaf hear ” we cannot say usne andho ko dikhdyd aur bahro ko sundya , this sentence, which is perfectly correct Urdu, means he showed something to the blind, and related something to the deaf. We may put it otherwise. The direct object of one of these causals is not the doer, but the thing done ; or again, if the causal of a trans. verb is put in the passive, the nom. is the thing done, not the doer. citthi likhal gai “ the letter was caused to be written ”, not munshl hkhaed gayd the clerk w’as made to w r rite ba^shnd forgive , [ 29 ] 520 but the causal passive means not “ he was made to forgive ” but 44 forgiveness was obtained for his sin, his sin was caused to be forgiven ”. We can say paise lutae gae , but we may not translate “ the boy was made to rob ” by larkd lutded gay a. We can therefore make a universal rule : — Universal Rule.- — The causal of an ordinarily trans. verb, when it exists, may always mean “ cause something to be done ” ; and it is never wrong to use it with this meaning. To this rule there is no exception. Further, we can make a second rule : — Second Rule. — For the causals of ordinarily trans. verbs the meaning 44 cause to do ” is not permissible, whether the original verb is used 44 absolutely ” or not, i.e. whether the object is expressed or not. This rule may be considered universal, but if it were claimed that sikhna , si^rid 44 learn ” is always trans., it would come in here as an exception, and the rule would then be general, not universal. It is a matter of indifference. It is certainly correct to say 0 sya? pi e 44 she has been taught, put up to it ”. pildnd means 44 cause to be drunk ”. khildnd in the best usage means cause to be eaten, not cause to eat. A phrase like larke khilde gae is contrary to good idiom, but I have heard it. The following verbs are indifferently trans. and intrans., but it must not be assumed that the trans. is the causal of the intrans. : — bhulna, (a) 44 forget ”, (6) 44 err,” 44 pass from memory ” ; badalnd k change ”, palatna 44 return ”, ulatnd 44 turn upside down ”, bharnd fill ’ , ghisnd 44 rub ”, jhulasnd 44 scorch, get hot ”, manna 44 acknow- ledge, agree ”, parhna “ read, study ”, samajhnd 4 * understand ”, sikhna 4 4 learn ”. As they are both trans. and intrans. we should expect causals of both kinds. Actually we find that bhuldna, parhand , sikhana are causals of both trans. and intrans. senses ; i.e. both cause to err and cause to be forgotten, etc. badland , patidna, ultana, ghisanu , jhulsdna are generally causals of the int. sense, i.e. they mean 44 cause to perform the intrans. action ”. kodak'd nd, palatvdna , ulatvdnd , ghisvdnd , jhulasvand, mean to cause the action to be performed. bharand in one sense only is the causal of the intrans. verb, vjz. when it is used of a bird feeding its young, “ cause to become filled up.” Otherwise it is the causal of the trans., 44 cause a pot to be filled by someone.” [ 30 ] 521 manana in the phrases deota Manana , yushi mandnd, etc., is not a causal except in form. Apart from this meaning, manana, as also samjhand , prefers the meaning of “ cause to be done ” ; sentences like merd bap manayd gayd “ my father was persuaded ”, or ‘ anrat sam- jhal gal the woman was consoled ”, are not to be recommended. II. Usage (i) Grammars usually extend the name intrans. to verbs with cognate objects. These might equally be called trails, In U. and P. the causals generally omit the cognate object, as daurana “ cause to run Occasionally, but rarely, the object is expressed, and the verb is treated as the causal of a trans. meaning cause a race to be run. mujh se ban Iambi daur daurai gal “ I had to run a long run (ii) Some verbs have no causals. It is not possible to lay dawn a final rule on this point, for tastes vary. (а) Verbs, not themselves causals, whose roots end in -a do not make causals., e.g. pdnd “ find ”, jand “ go ”, and “ come ”, land “ bring ”, le jand “ take aw r ay ”, far man a “ command ”, gurrand “ growl ”, shanndnd “ he ashamed ”, varyaldnd “ lead astray ”. Exceptions, nahdna ' l bathe ” ; nahlvand : curdnd “ steal ”, curvdnd. But causals may make double causals, banayui “ make ” ; banvdnd. (б) Verbs with more than two syllables in the root do not make causals. Verbs with two syllables in the root, the second containing a so-called “ long ” vowel, make only a -va causal, e.g. ^am/nd “ buy 9 , Xandvand ; ghasitnd “ drag ”, ghasltvand . (c) A few others have no causals in ordinary use ; khend or kkeond “ row ” ; send “ hatch ” ; cahnd “ wish We may add khona “ lose ” ; soend “ think ” ; lend take ; bond “ become ”, for the forms khuvand and sucvdnd are fanciful ; the Hindi liva land and liva lejand are happily not used in Lrdu ; besides livd has not got the force of a causal ; huvdnd occurs only in the phrase ho huvake, etc., and has no causal meaning. (iii) The preposition to be used with causals of trans. verbs. W e have seen that causals of trans. verbs mean not “ cause someone to do something ”, but “ cause something to be done by someone . How is this “ by ” to be expressed ? It is translated in two ways according to the closeness of the connexion between the causer and the action performed. Wben the idea of causation is weak, the tendency is to use ko ; when it is strong, it is se. [ 3 ‘] 022 The following take ko, meaning “ to” : —dikhand show ” ; samjhdnd i( explain ”, piland “ give something to drink , khilana £k give something to eat ”, likhdna dictate ”, lutand distribute money ”, sunand 4 * relate ”, and all causals of verbs meaning put on ”, as pinhand %i clothe someone with ”, urhdna give a veil or shawl to be put on ”, har band hand put a garland on someone, give a garland to be put on ”, peti kamnd ,£ assist in putting on a belt . (These are free translations.) mm ne usko citthl likhdl £k I dictated a letter to him ; mat ne us se citthl likhaii (better likhvai) “ I got a letter written by him . Compare kisl ho Farsi par hand, kam sikhdnd, bat mandna . [ 32 ] The Four Classes of Urdu Verbs T71R0M the point of view of causality, Urdu verbs may be divided theoretically into four classes, according to their form : Intrans., Trans., First Causal, Second Causal. In this note I have kept before myself the difference between the form and the meaning of a verb ; but, though fully cognizant of what some grammarians say about “ verbs used transitively or intransitively ”, I find it more convenient in practice to say simply “ intr. verb ” and “ trans. verb As I am here not writing a treatise on general grammar, but merely making a few remarks on Urdu verbs, I will content myself with defining roughly the terms used : intr. verb, one which does not take a real object ; trans. verb, one which can take a real object (so-called cognate objects being ignored). A trans. verb is trans. whether the object is expressed or not, but a few verbs may be genuinely both trans. and intr. Thus in English : he went to change his clothes (trans.) ; he went to change (trans*, object suppressed) ; true friends do not change (intrans.). So in Urdu palatnd and badalnd can be truly intransitive as well as trans. All trans. verbs in Urdu can be used with obj. suppressed, but the suppression of the object leaves them trans. Intrans. verbs may be further subdivided into ordinary intrans. and purely neuter, as in the phrases : he turned-out of his room for me, and he turned-out a thief. Some Urdu verbs have no causals in use (I went into this in Bull. S.O.S., v, iii, 521) ; of a few it may be said that they have three. In practice possibly the most useful method of describing them is that mentioned above, viz. calling the causal of an intr. verb its trans. ; or if we start with the trans. verb, we may call the intrans. verb a middle or passive. Important General Rule. So far as meaning goes, trans. verbs have no causals. The so-called causals of trans. verbs are causals of their passives. W e may then put verbs in four columns : — (1) intr. (2) trans. (3) so-called first causal. (4) so-called second causal. Very few verbs appear in all four columns, some appear in only one. [33] 504 Column 1 contains all truly intrans. verbs. Column 2 contains trans. verbs (i.e. verbs which can take a true object, expressed or not). When a verb occurs in cols. 1 and 2, the form in col. 2 is usually the trans. of that in col. 1, but generally there is some change of meaning, with the result that two is not a real trans. of one. Column 2 might be called the causal of col. 1, but the relationship is, perhaps, more conveniently stated as intr. and trans., or middle and active. At this point there are two points to be noted : — (i) In some verbs the same idea runs through all forms, e.g. ladna ; all the forms contain the idea of loading ; so banna , making or being made. Other verbs, however, do not keep to one idea ; thus dikkna 44 be visible ” goes on to dekhnd 44 look at ” or 44 see ” ; dikhana 44 show ” — three distinct ideas. (ii) When the same idea is retained, cols. 3 and 4 are practically the same in meaning, e.g. ladana and ladvdnd mean the same, whereas dikhana and dikkvand are quite different. See below. It is necessary to have a clear idea of the relationship between the four columns. Col. 1. Let us call the nominative of these verbs 44 x Being intr. they have no obj. Cols. 2, 3, 4. Let us call the noms. of these verbs A, B, and C respectively. ladna 44 be loaded Col. 1. asbab lad rahd hai 44 the furniture, x, is being loaded Col. 2. naukar asbab lad rahd hai 44 the servant, A, is loading the furniture *\\ Col. 3 or 4. wdlik asbab ladvd rahd hai 44 the master, B, is getting the furniture loaded ”. ladvdnd does not mean cause to load. 44 x ” which is the nom. of col. 1 verbs, is the obj., and the only obj . of verbs in cols. 2, 3, 4. A, which is the nom. or agent of 2, cannot become the obj. of 3 or 4. B, the nom. or agent of 3, cannot become the obj. of 4. A, B, C are therefore never found as direct objects. Col. 3 verbs are usually said to be causals of col. 2 verbs ; e.g. that banvdna is the causal of banana and means 4 4 cause to make Both statements are erroneous, banvdna is the causal of banded jand and means 44 cause to be made ”. If it meant 44 cause to make ” its obj. would be A, 44 cause A to make ” ; on the contrary its obj. is 44 x ”, and it means 44 cause x to be made by A [ 34 ] 505 Col. 3 verbs fulfil two functions : they are (a) causals of col. 1 through the instrumentality of A ; (6) causals of the passive of col. 2. So we get bannd “ become made \" ; banana “ make'’ (directly, no outside party) ; banvand “ cause to be made through A It does not mean “ cause to make The nom. of bannd is always the obj. of banana and banvand. The object of banvand is not A, the maker ; it is x, the thing made. Similarly, if we put banvand in the passive, its nom. is x, the nom. of bannd , and this same x is the nom. of the passive of banana. sanduq abhi nahi band “ the box has not yet become made sanduq abhi nahi banded ged “ the box has not yet been made ” (by A, the carpenter). sanduq abhi nahi banvded ged “ the box has not yet been ordered (by B, the master) to be made ” (by A, the carpenter). But we can never say us ne barhai ho banvded “he caused the carpenter to make 99 ; or barhai. bamded ged “ the carpenter was caused to make Preposition of agency. In the Bull., loc. cit., I discussed this point. It may be either se or ho. Col. 3 verbs mean “ cause something to be done by A This by is sometimes se and sometimes ho. The problem is rather intricate. These col. 3 verbs are causals of the passive of col. 2 verbs. Now, if we study the col. 2 verbs, which are transitive, we note that practically all of them may be compounded with lend or dend , some with both, lend suggests a much closer connection than dend between the agent and the act. When we come to col. 3, where we find the causals of the passive of the col. 2 verbs, we see that when the col. 2 verb is a lend verb the corresponding verb in col. 3 has hardly any true causality. The idea is rather that something is done by A with the help of B. The agency is consequently expressed by the dative ho. We note, further, that sometimes they are practically new verbs, containing a new thought, e.g. dihhdnd , from dchh lend , theoretically means “cause to be seen”; in reality it means simply “ show ” ; sunana means “ relate or read out or recite (to someone) not, strictly speaking, “ cause to be heard.” Bne A ko kapre jnnhae “ B helped A on with his clothes, clothed him ” ; pahin lend “ put on B ne A ko ddsldn sundi ** B told A a story ” ; sun lend “ listen ”, Bne A ko sharbat pilded “ B gave A a sweet drink ” ; pi lend “ drink [ 35 ] 506 B ne A ko kuch likhvaea or likhded “ B dictated something to A ” ; likh lend “ write for oneself”. & B ne A se kuch likhvaea “ B got something written by A”; likh dena “write for someone else’'. > It is quite natural that the 4 4 causal ” of a lend verb should not contain any idea of real causality, for a lend verb means doing something for oneself ; consequently its “ causal ”, actually the causal of its passive, does not mean “ cause it to be done ”, which is almost meaningless, seeing that the person is doing it for himself ; it means “ help or enable it to be done ”, as in the examples above. Examples Col. 4 often differs only in form from col. 3, and it is generally preferred when the idea of getting something done by an outside party is prominent. Thus kdm karvdna is preferable to kdm karand , but the meaning is the same. When col. 4 differs from col. 3 we have the following : — Col. 4 is (a) the causal of 1, through agency of A and help of B ; (b) the causal of passive of 2 through help of B ; (c) causal of passive of 3. In each case the object is x, never A or B. Col. 4 is not the causal of the active of 2 or 3. Col. 4 differs in meaning from col. 3, when col. 3 (which means that B causes something to be done by A) uses ko to express by. See above. The following examples show how the nominative, x, of class 1 verbs, which are intrans., becomes the object of classes 2, 3, and 4. They show, too, that all so-called causals of trans. verbs are causals of the passive of those verbs, never of the verbs themselves. Examples 1 Nom. 2 Noon. Obj ( («) dikh X dekh . . A X (b) sun .

When one studies the details of individual verbs, puzzling and involved problems arise, but the foregoing outline gives the chief points. On the general question of Indo- Aryan causal verbs Beames, Camp. Gram., iii, 75 ff may be consulted. [37] REPETITION OF WORDS IN URDU , HINDI AND PANJABI I T has been stated many times that the principal idea in the repetition A of words is that of emphasis or intensity. My observation has led me to conclude that this is incorrect, and that the true sense in almost every case is one of the following : — distribution (over time, space, or a number of objects), pleasantness, no meaning at all. In order to make the inquiry practical, it is better to confine it to cases of words repeated without alteration. If anyone will in the course of his reading take 1,000 consecutive instances of repetition, he will find that (i) short words are repeated far oftener than long. (ii) repetition of adjj. or advv. with a pleasant meaning is much commoner than of those with a nasty meaning, and when the meaning may be either good or bad, the good is intended. (iii) nearly every instance comes under either distribution \\ or pleasantness. (i) It follows that we read of a man’s visiting gkar ghar or gao gad or skahr shahr , but not dur us saltanat ddr us saltanat , and that we may expect to hear of burke burke admi , sundar sundar striyg , or chofi choti larkiya, but hardly of za'ij ul 6 umr zaif ul ‘ umr sakibdn , yubsurat yubsurat masturai , or kam-sinn kam-sinn atfal. (ii) See sentences 1, 2, 3, below (iii) Distribution. adheli adheli “ eight annas each thik thik batdo “ explain correctly ” (correctness spread over answer). cuppa cuppa pant “ four inches of water all along zile ke sab bare bare pattedar “ all the important leaseholders of the district ”, gharl gkari “ repeatedly ” (at each gharl). Repeated verbs come under this heading ; the idea is either continuance or repetition of action : — dekh dekh kar , Pj. voy vey ke looking repeatedly ”. (Pj.) turdea turdeh “ through continued walking [ 38 ] 512 (Pj.) paxded padded “ while heating up ” (spread over some time). Pleasantness . This often corresponds to our “ nice and ”, or the slang “ jolly old ”, “ good old garm garm dud “ nice, hot milk Idl Idl tarbuze “ watermelons, nice and red tharidi thandl hava “ refreshing breeze (Pj.) un mg ja cheti cheti “ now off you go, nice and quick Sometimes no real meaning is discernible. People have got into the habit of repeating certain short words, and do so without thinking ; the very shortness of the word seems to demand repetition. I knew an Englishman who always said “ very very ”, never simply “ very Before one can claim that the main thought is emphasis it must be shown that other ideas are impossible. Examples must be fdund in which emphasis is the only possible idea, and is due solely to repeti- tion ; many emphatic phrases contain repeated words, but the emphasis would not be less if the word occurred only once. In fact we shall see that often the very reverse of emphasis is in the mind of the speaker. Let us examine a few cases. (1) gori gori bdlikd ki Idl Idl gdlhe “ the rosy cheeks of the prettily fair girl (2) thandl thandl havd “ a refreshing summer breeze (3) pio cd garm , garm “ here you are, sir, nice hot tea (4) voh alag alag baith gae “ they sat down in separate places Now if the idea of emphasis were present, these phrases would mean : — (1) the hectic cheeks of the deathly pale girl ; (2) a piercing winter wind ; (3) scalding tea, much too hot to drink before the train goes ; (4) they sat absolutely alone. We have had it impressed upon us that repetition means emphasis, and we shall feel inclined to say offhand that the following expressions are emphatic, but a little study will convince us that they are not. (5) kdm ke shuru‘ shuru me ^ in the early days of the work (6) voh to abhi abhi ayd thd “ he had not long been there ” ; quite different from voh to din usl vaqt pahuncd thd “ he had arrived at that very moment (7) sac sac bole “ now, my boy, the truth (throughout your answer) (8) thik thlk hal karo “ work it out correctly ”. But note that, if the boy gets the answer “ Rs. 23-11-9 ”, the teacher, wishing to tell [39] 513 him that his answer is “ absolutely right ”, will not say turn hard javdb thik thik hai ; he will say bi'lhdl thik hai. Similarly “ entirely wrong ” will be bilkull gal at. not galaf galat. (9) mahine ke andar andar “ some time or other nothin a month (10) somvdr se pahlv pahle ** some time or other before Monday (11) ham tin tin ddmi prastat hai ; when Haris Candr uses these words, he means “ here we are, three of us every time, for every work (12) mat ne das das yati likhe , turn ne ek bhi javdb na diyd ; this literally means “ on several occasions I sent you ten letters one after another, but you didn’t answer any Actually, no doubt, he wrote a couple of times and got no answer. THE GENDER OF ARABIC INFINITIVES IN URDU A Complete Guide to the ge'nder of nearly 1,000 nouns P LATTS’S Urdu Grammar contains rules to help in determining the genders of nouns. As it was published in 1873 and has not been revised since, one would expect that here and there some restate- ment might be necessary. This short article deals with the Arabic infinitives commonly used in Urdu. Platts gives seven forms (see especially pp. 25-9), pointing out that six are generally masc. and one fem. In every case but one there are exceptions. The student therefore has an uneasy feeling that perhaps the exceptions are nearly as numerous as the examples, and that in any case unless he knows all the exceptions, the rules are of little value. These Arabic infinitives give to Urdu between 900 and 1,000 nouns. It is impossible to say exactly how many, for a hard and fast line cannot be drawn. Some writers, like Abu’l Kalam Azad, overload their writings with little - known Arabic words, others employ far fewer. I will here state the rules and endeavour to give every exception. About some ivords authorities differ. One broad rule to cover all others may Jbe stated thus : nouns of the form taffil are fem., and nouns of the following six forms are- masc., iffal, tafa“ul , tafa’ul , inffal , ijtidl , istiffal. Directly derived from these and closely resembling them are some nouns ending in - a (i.e. -ah with h not pronounced), which are masc., and in - at which are fem. Let us take them in detail, (1) Form II, taftl. Approximately 230 of thisform are found in Urdu literature in addition to forty which end in -a or -at, such as tasjiya , taqviyat. The 230 are all fem. except one, ta'viz, amulet, which is masc. Most of them are abstract nouns, but even those which are not, with the exception of ta'mz, are fem. Thus Taslis , the Holy Trinity ; tahsii , which often means a tahsilddrs house or court of justice ; tahvil, capital, deposited funds ; tasmm , a fountain in Paradise (made masc. by one poet, §hu‘ur), are fem. About twenty-eight connected nouns end in -a. All are masc.. but tahmjya (for tahiyya), salutation has both genders. The word takkliya, letting go, evacuating, is wrongly given fem. by Platte’s Diet. It is masc. Approximately twelve end in -at and are fem. Quadriliteral words belonging to Form II are all masc. They include words like tabakhtur , walking proudly, and fancy words like [4i] 780 takashmur , to act like or become a Kashmiri. There are about nine of them. taqayyad, fern., urging, insistence, is probably an alteration of taqid < taqifid. (2) Form IV, if'dl. About 131 words ; all masc. except eight. This number does not include about twenty-five derivatives in -at or -a ; see below. The eight exceptions are : — isldh , correction. i/m/, abundance. ilhah, importunity. imdad , help. imlak , property (rare). insha, composition. pain. risd/, rent remitted to headquarters. When irsal means merely “ sending it is not used as a noun ; it is then part of the verb irsdl-karnd , send, or irsal-hona , be sent : imla , dictation, is sometimes fern. There are about seventeen derived nouns ending in -at, all fern., e.g. ijazat , permission, and about eight in -a, all masc., as irada , m., intention. The following is a list of words to which Platts has given wrong genders. The genders marked here are the correct ones : — ihsd, m., numbering. idbdr , m., turning back. if a, m., paying. ima , m., sign, hint. ijlas, m., session. ifrat , f., abundance. irsdly f., rent sent on. imlak , f., giving possession to. imdad , f., help. He allows both genders to ihsd and ifrat ; imdad is correct in the Gram, but wrong in the Diet. Conversely idbdr is right in the Diet., but wrong in the Gram. ikrah , m., aversion (rare), and trad, citing, which he gives as fern., have both genders. (3) Form V, tafa“ul. About 173 words plus fourteen ending in 187 in all. The former are all masc. except three, and the latter are all fem. The three exceptions are : — tavajjuh , f., attention. tavaqqu \\ f., hope. tamarind, f., desire. Platts has tavazzu, f., prayer-ablution, but it is not used in Urdu. There are a couple of derived nouns in -a which are masc. They bring the number up to 188. (4) Form VI, tafa'ul. About eighty-one. Twelve end in -i and are fem. ; three derived nouns end in -a and are masc. The remaining sixty-six are all masc., except tavazu\\ politeness, consideration. f4*] 781 (5) Form Vll, infi'dl . About thirty-five, all masc. Platts’s Diet, gives imbisdt , gladness, fern. It is found both masc, and fem. The poet Hall makes it masc. (6) Form VIII, ifti’al . About 130. Masc. with ten exceptions, of which six end in -a. The fem. nouns are : — ihiiyaj, need. ihtiyat , care. istilah, conventional usage. ittila 6 , announcement. And the following in -d : — ibtidd, beginning. istifd , being elect (rare). isktihd , longing. iUijd , petition. ifetifd , sufficiency. ihtidd , being guided (very rare). intihd, end. Platts wrongly gives i'tiraz as fem. The following are both masc. and fem. : iltifdt, courtesy ; iltimds, request ; imtiydz, distinction ; istinad , leaning on (rare) ; ibtila , affliction ; i'tina, anxiety, sympathy ; iqtida , imitation. It will be noticed that of the nouns ending in -d all the common ones are fem., viz. ibtidd , iUija , intihd , isktihd. (7) Form X, istif'al. About sixty-eight ; masc. with the following four exceptions : — isti'ddd , capacity. istid‘d , supplication. seeking to please (rare). istimdad , asking help. The following have both genders : istisna, exception, i's%na, wealth, independence, isii^far, asking forgiveness. /ar is generally pronounced astay far. PI. Diet, gives ni. gender to istisna , istiyfdr (so also Gram.), and to istimdad (correct in Gram.), istikrdh , m., aversion, is correct in the Diet., but wrong in the Gram. Further, seven derived nouns ending in -at are fem., and five ending in -a are masc. Adding them to the sixty-eight already mentioned, we get eighty for this class. To sum up : I have dealt with about 950 nouns, which may be divided approximately as follows : — Connected with Form II 280 ) i IV 155 V 190 VI 80 VII 35 VIII 130 X 80 Total [43] 950 782 Of these 870 are Arabic infinitives and eighty are directly derived nouns ending in - at or -a. The following simple rules govern them. Feminine. All ending in -i No exceptions. „ „ „ -at No exceptions. The form tafil One exception, viz. tajvTz, amulet. Masculine all the rest. Some exceptions as below. Details of Masculine Types. Quadriliterals of Form II Derived nouns in -a Form if'al . tafa“ul taf^ul ,, infi'dl . „ ifti'dl „ istif‘al All masc, ; no exceptions. All masc. ; no exceptions. Eight exceptions given above. Three exceptions, tavajjuh , tavaqqu\\ tamarind . One exception, tavdzu\\ f.. politeness. No exceptions. Ten exceptions, given above. Four exceptions, istid'd, isti‘dad, istimddd, istirza. The phrases in Platts’s Gram., p. 25, 11. 19, 20, “ a few more words that end in t or a,” etc., and that on p. 26, 11. 17, 18, “ a few words ending in -a or t ” should be omitted: I do not think that in either case there is a purely fem. word ending in t , and those which end in -a are about equally divided. If we oinit words of the forms if'ai and ifti'al we have 720 nouns with only nine exceptions ; even if we include these two forms with their relatively numerous eighteen exceptions, the total is only 27. A few words, not Arabic infinitives, may be mentioned in conclusion. Platts gives wrong genders to the fem. nouns injtl , Gospel ; afvah y rumour ; tardzu y balance (correct in'Grammar). banafsha , violet, which he makes fem., is both masc, and fem. [ 44 ] URDU GRAMMATICAL NOTES. I 147 URDU GRAMMATICAL NOTES. I (a) Masculine Nouns ending in -i We are apt to think that ali nouns ending in -i and denoting inanimate things are fem. with the exception of pdrii, water ; jl, mind, self ; gki, a kind of butter ; mod, pearl ; dahi, buttermilk. In this we are wrong. There are many other masc. nouns ending -7. I submit the following list ; perhaps there are others. One or two of them are occasionally heard fem. In the case of some it is possible to explain why they are masc. (e.g. names of months are masc.), but these [45] 148 URDU GRAMMATICAL NOTES. I explanations are often of little value to the student. He wishes simply to know which nouns in - 1 are masc. The reason for their being masc. is of secondary interest. I have purposely given the Urdu forms of the Arabic words ; their Arabic forms do not concern us. maxi, past tense. mdrii, meaning ; masc.. pi. mut ‘addi, trans. verb. (commoner ma c ne). musktari , planet Jupiter. janvari , January. tuti, parrot (metaph.). uslcd farvari , February. tufi bol raha hai, he is mat , May. famous. julai, July. qali, carpet (also qdltn). farvardi, Persian month (also dt 1 yesterday. farvardm ). jadi, Pole Star, Aries, Tropic urdi, Persian month (also urdl of Capricorn. bihisht). jalldmin, jhallamiri , boy’s jumadi ul awal (or sam, or game. dkhir ), Muhammadan month. (b) The Nom. Plur. of Fem. Nouns in -a This is a point not taken up in grammars. The plur. of these nouns is formed not by changing -a to -e, but by changing ~a to -d and adding -e. Thus we get — fakhtde , doves : zaccde, women with newly born children : mada barrde , female lambs. Similarly, if one were to get plurals of Arabic ferns, in -a, such as maiika , queen ; vdlidd, mother, they would also end in -de. As a rule these Arabic ferns, avoid plurals. (c) Peculiarities in the Use of ne To begin with we may state a general rule : — When the root of one verb is joined to another verb so as to make a single compound verb, if either verb does not take ne, the compound verb does not take ne ; voh has di> she laughed ; voh leaya , he brought. The following verbs, almost all of which are or can be trans., do not take ne, whether they have an object or not. [ 46 ] A I URDU GRAMMATICAL NOTES. I 149 bakna , speak foolishly. bhulna , forget. cuknd , finish. ja?ind, give birth to. karna in such phrases as bandy a karna. lagna , begin. land , bring (prob. contracted from Ze ana). forw#, fight (with), bite, pand, succeed in, manage to, get permission to. dikhm dend , appear, swtioi (lend, be heard. pakfdi dena , be caught, dewd used with any other verbal noun of this form. The following are both trans. and intrans. They take ne when they are trans., otherwise they do not. badalnd, change. bharna , fill. jhulasnd , scorch. palatud, return. pukdrnd, call out, call someone for help. qarar pand , be decided ; obtain rest. ragarna, rub. ulatndy turn upside down. The usage of the following is variable : — has dendy laugh (better with- ro dend , cry (better without). out ne). samajhndy understand (better parhndy learn, read (better without). with ne). sikhnd, learn (better with). The following never take ne when used without an object. When they have an object they may take it. bolndy speak (much better without). hdrndy lose, be defeated ; jitnd, win. When these two have an object such as 6dzl, game, shart y bet, they may either take or omit ne. cdhnd omits ne when the nom. is dil , ji y heart, etc. Other- wise it takes it. It shjould be mentioned that bahasnd, argue ; ciUdndj cry out ; do not take ne, while sdth dend, accompany, does. The following intrans. verbs take ne : — [ 47 ] 150 URDU GRAMMATICAL NOTES thuhna , spit. This can be trans. as in scire shahr ne us ho thuka , the whole city despised him. hagna, mutna , perform the offices of nature. manna, agree (sometimes intrans.). URDU GRAMMATICAL NOTES, II (a) Gender of Nouns Ending in -a. The rule that nouns in -a are rnasc., with the exception of some Sanskrit words, all Hindi diminutives in -iyd, and certain Arabic abstracts, is only approximately correct. I have made some lists which may be of interest. It might be claimed that one or two of the Hindi nouns are diminutives, but I do not think they can fairly be so described. Hindi fern, nouns ending in -a : — aiigiyd , bodice. jangiya , janghiya , drawers. chdliyd , betel nut. sankhiya , arsenic. badhiya, bullock, gelding. bhat kaZayyd , a prickly plant. And the proper names : — Lanka , Ceylon. Gangd, Ganges. Jarnnd, Jamna. The following are worth adding, for they are so common that the fact of their being Sanskrit is forgotten : — jata, matted hair. pujd, worship. ghatd, dark cloud. sabha, assembly. mold, necklace. day a, mercy. sitld, smallpox. garhayya , large pit. thiliyd , earthen pot. muniyd, amadavat. maind , starling. shdma, magpie robin. barva , poor land. Ajodhiya Jamvd , Geneva. [48] URDU GRAMMATICAL NOTES 419 To^ these we might add : — kirpa , kindness. bidya , knowledge. The following Persian feminines should be noted : — shahna , flute. asiya corn mill. qarnd , horn. sazd, punishment. cun o drd , excuse. dog a, deceit, sara, inn. parva caring, etc. jdy place. A few Arabic feminines in -a should be recorded as not being abstracts : — dunyd, world. qulyd> name of a sura in the Quran. sahbd , wine. kirriid, chemistry (Greek). (b) Are Nouns denoting Males always Masc., an THOSE DENOTING FEMALES ALWAYS FeM. ? It has often been pointed out that ghar t house, qabdla t family, etc., even when used for “ wife ”, retain (as is natural) their masc. gender. I have never seen any mentioned on the other side, and therefore venture to adduce the following : — badhiyd f., bullock, gelding. asam/i f., client, tenant (male or female). savari f., passenger (male or female). sarkdr f., the government, also single individual, your honour, his honour. polis, pults , puls , f., the police. ra'iyyat f., plur. ri ( aya f. subject, landholder, tenant. (c) The Meaning of “ Jana ” in Compounds. jana y go, when added to the root of another verb to form a kind of compound verb, either contains or does not contain the idea of “ going ”, Can rules be given ? I would suggest the following : — (i) When added to intr. verbs jdnd does not contain the idea of “ going ” : — baith gtiyd , sat down. so gaya> went to sleep, o gaydy came. [49] 420 URDU GRAMMATICAL NOTES The verb itself may of course imply motion, as hat gayd, moved away. An exception, perhaps, is uth jana, which means not to rise up, but to move out of one house into another. Along with these must be included the occasional use of jana with Icarna, to form an intr. compound : — sirayat kar gay a, penetrated (me, into). jagah pakar gay a, found a place (me, in). As my colleague, Mr. G. E. Leeson, has pointed out, jana, often limits the meaning in a peculiar manner. This point deserves a note to itself. (ii) When added to tr. verbs jana normally contains the idea of “ going ” : — rupaya de gayd, he gave a rupee and went off. khirkiya tor gayd , he broke the windows and went away. Exceptions.— While it is difficult to say with certainty that in any given case the idea of moving away is entirely absent, we do find sentences in which it is so weak that we may disregard it. (а) Verbs meaning “ understand ”, “ take in ”, etc. : — mat tar gayd , I saw and went way, or I saw and took in. max samajh gayd , I took in or have taken in. mm jdn gayd , I took in or have taken in. nuii dekh gaya , I looked and went, or I looked over (the volume). (б) Verbs meaning “ eat ” or “ drink ” : — sdra khand ragar gaya, or harap kar gayd, or khd gayd, he ate all the dinner and went off, or he ate it up. sharbat pi gayd, he drank the sherbet and went off, or he drank up the sherbet. So hazm k., cat k., nigalnd, eat or swallow up. [ 50 ] GRAMMATICAL NOMENCLATURE : UNNECESSARY NAMES TN the teaching of Indian languages much confusion is caused by the invention of names for ideas which cither have well known names already, or do not require any name. This makes otherwise useful grammatical notes very obscure, and causes actual unfairness in examinations because candidates are often unfamiliar with the terms employed. We should avoid attaching labels to the words, constructions, and phrases of the language we are teaching, and when a name is necessary it should be one already known from English or Latin. I take a few' illustrations at random from Platts’s Grammar. Under verbs we find acquisitives, ‘potentials , incept ives, permissives, com - pletives , desideratives, continuatives, frequentative s, staticals, and reiterative s. It will hardly be believed that most of these names have been coined to indicate one or, at the most, two words. Thus acquisitives means pdna alone ; potential means sakna ; inceptive, laqna ; permissive , dend ; completive , cuknd ; desiderative . cdhnd (and mdgna /) ; continnative , jana and rahna ; so far we have had seven unnecesary and, for the most part, uncouth names to indicate eight or nine words, nearly one special name per word. Frequentative and statical refer to two particular idioms, and reiteratives to repetition ; none of these need a name. I would strongly advocate making a clean sweep of them all. They are confusing, awkward, and useless. I never myself use any of them. The teacher can say “ to-day we are going to discuss -sakna “ be able ”, or -lagna “ begin ” ; or “ I am going to tell you how' to express permission or desire or habit or repetition.” The simplest words are best. Another objectionable word is postposition. We have “ preposition well established as a technical term. Why do we need another ? English prepositions often follow their word : “ that’s the hole he got in by ” ; or as the weary nurse said to the intellectual patient after having read aloud to him, “ what did you choose that book to be read to out of for ? ” In my teaching I always say “ preposition ”, and never has it led to any difficulty or called forth any question, 767? 5 ' 1 516 As a matter of fact, if we wish to be lugubriously accurate, we shall have to say that Urdu and Hindi have prepositions, postpositions, and prepostpositions, for some always precede, some always follow, and some may do both. What is the unfortunate student to say ? The aim we should set before ourselves is this : — as far as possible (i) avoid coining new terms ; (ii) use well known terms, and use them with their usual meanings. Thus, if we use transitive and intransitive we must not change their connotation ; we must not equate transitive with “ verbs requiring ne ”, and intrans. with “ verbs not requiring ne Some trans. verbs never need ne , and some intrans. verbs always need it with certain tenses. It is difficult to know what to call the case which in Pj. and U. occurs with all prepositions. “ Oblique ” and “ General Oblique ” have been suggested. They are unsatisfactory, for the case is only one out of four oblique cases in Pj. and out of two in U. Perhaps we might call it Prepositional, which, though a new name, carries its meaning on the surface. The Cases of Nouns and Pronouns in Urdu, Hindi, and Panjabi In Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit case names are given to definite forms. The syntax of these forms is a different matter. Each case may have ten or twenty uses. If we are to employ the same names in Panjabi Hindi, and Urdu, we must do so in the same way ; we cannot make, say, ablative or dative, equivalent to se or ko 7 for either se or Jco may represent a Latin genitive or dative or accusative or ablative. A preposition governs a certain case, but it is no part of the case. €i$ tt]v oIkUlv means ghar me ; oIkL av is accus. Are we to call ghat also accus. ? ghar is in a certain case, but ghar- me is not a case. Again, fieri x a P^s (genitive) is xushi se ; the Urdu noun corresponds to a noun in the genitive, why call it ablative ? A Greek dative may inter alia stand for a Latin ablative, but we do not, therefore, insist on saddling Greek with an ablative case. The term “ case-phrase ” has been suggested. But before we speak of a “ dative case-phrase ”, we shall need to decide whether it is a Latin, Greek, or Sanskrit dative, and also which of the ten or twenty meanings of the dative it bears. Hindi and Urdu nouns have three cases, nom., voc., and a third, which may be called prepositional. It is used with all prepositions [52] 517 including ne. Thus bakine , bahino, bakind. Pronouns will need an agent case : voh they ” ; un, unhd. I must plead guilty to having in various books given long lists of unnecessary cases, and committed the absurdity of making a preposition part of a case. It seems to me that in no circumstances should a preposition be included in a case, but when a name is required for a definite form there is no objection to choosing the nearest of most suitable of the well-known case names, gen., dat., abl., loc., etc. Panjabi requires five case names, masit “ mosque ”, bu‘d <k door.” Sing. nom. masit , btVa prep. masit bue loc. masitti bue abl. masitto bu‘eo voc. masitte bu‘ea Plur. masitld bue masitld bued masitti bud wanting masitio bueo Pronouns need at least three more : agent, dative, and gen. Sing. nom. mce , “ I ” prep, mere loc. mere, men abl. met ho ag. mce gen. mem dat. menu , mind o‘ “ he ” os , [ o'de ] [os] OS [o'da, osdd] [<)'nu, osnu] Plur. asl y ah% sadde , asd , aha sat ho asd , ahd saddd sand o‘ o'nd, [o l nd de ] ( ar o m [o'nd to] o'nd [o'nd da] [o'nd ttd] The loc. forms meri, odd are always adjectival, agreeing with a loc. plur. noun. Other adj. forms have also been included. Addendum. The First Plural Feminine in Urdu Some doubt seems to exist as to the proper form of the verb in the 1st plur. fem., and it has been asserted that the masc. form must be used. This is true of only one case. (i) When a woman speaking of herself alone uses the plur., the verb and adjj. are masc. : — ham to abhi ate hai “ Pm coming now This reminds us of Greek usage. Cf. Euripides Ale. 383, where Alcestis is referring to herself. [53] 518 (ii) If several women speak, the verb is fem. Two cases arise (а) when a plur. fem. noun is inserted, ham find bahine rotl kha rahi tin “ we three sisters were break- fasting (б) when there is no noun. A good example occurs in Azad’s Ab % Hayat , p. 74 of 1917 ed., where he makes some women say : — jab tak ha marl bat na leak dega na pildegT u until you say what we want, we shall not give you water Two examples from Prem Cand are : — ham sab ki sab calegi “ we shall all go dp kd diya khati ha 7, to sath kis ke rahegi “ what we eat is your gift, then with whom else shall we stay ? ” In this last case (when there is no noun) some speakers are inclined to favour the masc., but among good families the fem. is used.
