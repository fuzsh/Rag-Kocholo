THE ENGLISH FACTORIES IN INDIA 1642-1645 A CALENDAR OF DOCUMENTS IN THE INDIA OFFICE, WESTMINSTER BY WILLIAM FOSTER, CLE. EDITOR OF 'letters RECEIVED BY THE EAST INDIA COMPANY, 1615-17' 'THE EMBASSY OF SIR THOMAS ROE TO THE GREAT MOGUL', ETC. PUBLISHED UNDER THE PATRONAGE OF HIS MAJESTY'S SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA IN COUNCIL OXFORD >^ AT THE CLARENDON PRESS 1913 OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS LONDON EDINBURGH GLASGOW NEW YORK TORONTO MELBOURNE BOMBAY HUMPHREY MILFORD M.A. PUBLISHER TO THE UNIVERSITY PREFACE The documents here dealt with number one hundred and fifty-seven, and they are spread fairly evenly over the four years comprised in the present volume. Except for one letter on p. 183 (of slight importance), which comes from the Egertou MSS. at the British Museum, they are all drawn from the India Office archives. Neither the Public Record Office at home nor any of the Indian Record Offices has been able to contribute to the collection. The period synchronizes roughly with the first phase of the Civil War in England, from the raising of the royal standard at Nottingham in August, 1642, to the battle of Naseby in June, 1645 j ^^^ the consequent difficulty with which the East India Company's operations were carried on at home of course affected to some extent the proceed- ings of their servants in the East. Yet on the whole the embarrassment caused to the latter was smaller than miofht have been expected. Each year ships arrived from England, though with reduced cargoes, and each year one or more went back ; and the most startling effect of the war on the Company's trade was the loss of the John, which in 1644 was betrayed to the royalists by her commander. In India itself the factors, though much hampered by debt and the lack of sufficient supplies from home, managed to keep going the trade with Mokha, Basra, Gombroon, Achin, iv THE ENGLISH FACTORIES Bantam, and other places ; while in addition they dispatched ships from Surat to Macao and Manilla — the latter a pioneer venture which met with less success than it deserved. On the Coromandel Coast and in Bengal English commerce was making little headway ; but this was largely due to the disturbed state of the Vijayanagar kingdom, now tottering to its fall. The frontispiece consists of a map of the Malabar and Coromandel Coasts at this period, intended to supplement the map of Northern India given in the first volume of the present series (i 6 18-21). The index has been compiled by Mr. H. G, Bull, of the Record Department of the India Office. INTRODUCTION The position of English commerce in the East at the beginning of 1642 went far to justify the pessimistic tone of most of the letters of that time here printed. From every factory came complaints of financial embarrassments. Alike at Bantam, Fort St. George, and Surat, the English merchants were deeply in debt, while the heavy interest — amounting in the case of Bantam to 4 or 5 per cent, per month (p. 34) — and current expenses were draining away what little cash they were able to procure. Both in the sale of their wares and in the purchase of Eastern products they had to face a formid- able competition on the part of the Dutch, who were far better equipped both with goods and funds. The recent extension of the Company's sphere of action to Bengal, Sind, and Basra had not produced results answering to the sanguine anticipations of the promoters. Sind, it is true, seems to have yielded a fair return both in indigo and calico ; but Basra had proved disappointing (p. 23), while Bengal had swallowed up large sums and returned little or nothing. Every letter to England implored a supply of money ; but money the Company was finding it increasingly difficult to procure. The threatening aspect of public affairs at home had much to do with this ; so had the competition of the group of interlopers known as Courteen's Association. An attempt to raise a Fourth Joint Stock in the spring of 1640 had failed miserably ; and it was only with difficulty that in the autumn of the following year a sum of about 105,000/. (p. 41) was got together for the purpose of a (First) ' General Voyage ', i.e. a venture for one year only. With this money the Hopewell was equipped and dis- patched to the Coromandel Coast at the end of 1641, with a stock of over 17,000/. : the Blessing was sent to Bantam : and the O'w- piana and Aleppo Merchant (the latter a hired vessel) to Surat with nearly 60,000/. (p. 61). At the last-named settlement President Fremlen and his Council managed, with the help of a further loan from a wealthy Hindu vi THE ENGLISH FACTORIES merchant, Virjl Vora, to fill the London with calico, sugar, cotton yarn, cinnamon, &c., and dispatched her to England at the close of January, 1642. A few days later the Swan^ which had arrived from Bantam in the previous November, started on her return voyage to that port ; and on her way she called at Goa to land two factors, who were to be stationed there to prevent the intrusion of Courteen's merchants. In the middle of February two pinnaces, the Seahorse and the Prosperous^ left Swally for Gombroon, whence the Prosperous continued her voyage for Basra ; while a little later the Supply followed them to Persia with freight goods, arriving at Gombroon on March 19. Their calicoes were disposed of without difficulty and at a good profit, as the depredations of the Malabar pirates had deterred many of the Indian junks from venturing to that port j but the customs revenue (and consequently the English share of it) suffered in proportion (p. 32). In addition, the Discovery and a small pinnace named the Francis were dispeeded by the President and Council to the Red Sea, partly to trade, partly to guard the Indian junks against piratical attacks,^ and partly to capture Malabar rovers. The Francis sailed on February 5, arrived at Mokha about a month later, left again for Gombroon on July 12, and finally reached Swally, in company with the Seahorse and Prosperous, at the end of October. The Discovery did not make a start until March 12, and consequently did not reach Mokha till April 13. The markets proved so bad that Wylde, the merchant in charge, decided to remain there to sell the goods at leisure. The vessel therefore sailed without him on August 22. She was much delayed by bad weather, with the result that she did not get to Swally until the last day of October The English merchants were very glad to see her back, for sinister rumours were circulating in the Surat bazaars that, finding a large amount of treasure on board belonging to native merchants, the crew had carried her off to England (pp. 92, 144). The Company's servants at Basra wrote home in September an interesting letter (p. 57) describing their experiences of that city as a place of trade. They had been extremely well treated ; but there ^ The importance of the trade between Surat and Mokha is well shown by the fact, mentioned on p. 17, that the junks returning from the latter port in the autumn of 1641 brought upwards of 1,700,000 rials of eight. , INTRODUCTION vii was small demand for their broadcloth or indeed for any oth?r goods 'in these barren tymes '. They had, however, realized nearly 18,000/., and were now about to return to India in the Sea- horse and Prosperotis. These two vessels reached Swally on October 29, and the former was then sent to examine the island of Salbet, off the coast of Kathiawar (p. 93). The two ships from England, viz. the Crispiajia and the Aleppo Merchant y anchored at Swally on September 31, 1642. On board the former was Edward Knipe, an old servant of the Company, who had returned to his allegiance after spending some time in the service of Courteen. He had now been engaged as a special factor for this voyage, and was to go back to England in whichever ship should be the last to leave. No time was lost at Surat in dis- patching him with the Aleppo Merchant to Goa and Cochin, to sell broadcloth, lead, and coral, and to procure cinnamon, cardamoms, and pepper. He was also to fetch away from the former place the two factors (Pitt and Hill) who had been left there by the Sivan early in the year. Knipe sailed on October 13, and ten days later his ship anchored in Goa Road, where he found a Dutch blockading squadron under Jan Dirksz. Galen. The latter was already much annoyed because Courteen's ship the Hester had slipped into Goa and sold sulphur to the Viceroy, while the Swan ^, which (as he alleged) had been permitted to go into the port under promise not to trade there, had nevertheless embarked a quantity of cinnamon. After some dispute, however, he permitted Knipe to send into Goa for the English factors and any merchandise they might have in hand. This done, the Aleppo Merchant sailed again on the last day of October, and after visiting Calicut and Ponnani, anchored off Cochin on November 8. There Knipe sold most of his goods and obtained a quantity of cinnamon at cheap rates. Returning, he bought some pepper and cardamoms at Calicut, paid a pioneer visit to Basrur (p. 109), and got back to Svvaliy three days before Christmas. The Crispiana and Aleppo Merchant left Swally on their home- ward voyage about the middle of January, 1643, carrying a letter which contained, among other items of interest, the news that Shah ^ On her return voyage from Bantam to Surat. She reached the latter port on November 9, 1642 (p. 94). viii THE ENGLISH FACTORIES Safi of Persia was dead and had been succeeded by a boy of ten, under the title of Shah Abbas II (p. 83). At the end of the month the Discovery and Supply were dispatched to Gombroon, whence the former was to continue her voyage to Mokha while the latter returned to Surat. In the meantime the Francis was sent direct to the Red Sea in March, with a few freight goods and some stores for the Discovery. The Seahorse sailed for Gombroon and Basra towards the end of the same month, and returned in November with an encouraging report. The Francis got back from Mokha in September, and the Discovery (by way of Cochin) at the begin- ning of November. John Wylde, the factor in charge, had died at Mokha in October, 164^, and thereupon some English goods, which Cranmer had been sent to sell at Jiddah, were seized and were only released on payment of a considerable sum. The Governor of Mokha promised to obtain restitution ; but nothing resulted, and the English were forced to leave with their grievances unredressed (p. 161). Knipe's success in selling coral, &c. on the Malabar Coast encouraged the President and Council at Surat to send a further quantity in that direction under the charge of Thurston and Pynn, who were landed at Cochin by the Swan^ which sailed from Swally, bound for Bantam, on February 25, 1643. ^^^ factors found that the country was in a disturbed state, owing to wars between the Portuguese and a neighbouring Raja ; but they managed to secure a quantity of pepper, with which they returned to Surat in the Discovery. In April, 1643, the Surat factors sent the Supply to Achin, laden chiefly with freight goods belonging to Indian merchants. The venture was not entirely successful, owing to the hold the Dutch had upon the trade ; but the prospects appeared sufficiently encouraging to warrant a factory being established there under Maximilian Bowman. On her way back the Supply secured a quantity of cinnamon at Cochin, with which she returned to Swally in the middle of December. In the autumn of 164:^ the East India Company had succeeded in starting a Fourth Joint Stock, with a capital which was ultimately made up to 105,000/. ; and had prepared for the East a fleet con- sisting of the Dolphin^ Hind, and Scajlozucr — all for Surat — apd the INTRODUCTION ix Hart for the Coast. In addition, the Mary was sent out to Bantann on account both of the First General Voyage and of the new Joint Stock. These ships sailed in the spring of 1643. The Dolphin and Hznd re3iched Swally on September 18 ; while the Scajiower^ which had called on her way at Mozambique and Bombay, did not arrive until ten days later. On November 10 the Dolplihi was sent to Rajapur and Goa, returning just before Christmas; and in the meantime the Hind made a voyage to Sind to fetch certain goods which were there awaiting shipment, while the Seaflower went to Gombroon for a like purpose. On her return she was dispatched to Bantam (April 20, 1644). The pepper brought from Achin by the Supply^ together with a quantity received by the Expedition from Bantam in November, and the usual investments in India itself, enabled the President and Council to dispeed the Dolphin and Discovery for England on January 29, 1644, with good cargoes. On the former vessel William Fremlen embarked, having made over his post as Presi- dent to Francis Breton. The voyage proved a disastrous one. Want of water forced the two vessels to make for Mauritius, and on their way they encountered a fearful storm. The Discovery was never heard of again, and presumably went down with all hands.^ The Dolphin narrowly escaped the same fate ; but by cutting away her mainmast and bailing incessantly her crew managed to keep her afloat and get her to Mauritius (April 6). There they found the Hopewell^ homeward bound from Bantam ; she too had suffered much from the winds and waves, and the repair of the two ships, in which the Dutch settlers lent a helping hand, took until June 22, when they sailed in company for Madagascar and the Comoros. At the latter islands they were joined by the Crispiana from England ; and, as it was judged unsafe for the DolpJiin and Hope- well to attempt the voyage home in their crazy condition, all three sailed for Surat on August 17, and anchored there a month later. Fremlen had now to spend three months in India before making ^ The loss thus occasioned was variously stated at 46,000/. {Court Minutes y 1644-49, p. 96), 30,000/. {Ibid., p. 163), and about 52,000/, (Sambrooke's report on the East India trade, in Home Miscellaneous, vol. xl.). As the value of the cargoes of both vessels was only about 46,000/. (p. 159), the second figure (allowing for the ship and stores) seems nearest the mark. X THE ENGLISH FACTORIES a fresh attempt to reach his native land ; and his anomalous position as ex-President raised some awkward questions at home as to the pay which he was entitled to draw for this period. One of the latest events of Fremlen's administration was the dis- patch of presents to Agra for the Emperor and his sons. A Dutch mission to court in 1642 had resulted in a favourable settlement of the question of the rating for customs purposes of goods exported by them. The calculation of exact values in such cases left an opening for extortion of which the officials were not slow to avail themselves ; and it was an obvious advantage to have a definite scale laid down, based upon the actual cost of the goods, plus certain allowances supposed to represent the expense of getting them to the coast. Naturally, the English were eager to obtain a similar concession; and a change of Governors at Surat, which occurred in December, 1643, offered a suitable opportunity, as the late Governor, Jam Qui! Beg, was going to court and had promised his active assistance. Letters were therefore written to Shah Jahan and his son Dara Shikoh ; and with these were sent handsome presents for both and for Prince Murad Bakhsh, the cost of which amounted to about 9,000 rupees, or rather over 1,000/. (p. 160). The actual negotiations were left to John Turner and the other factors at Agra, who were to enlist the help of Islam Khan, the then Wazir. The results were eminently satisfactory. The presents produced a very favourable impression (p. 162), and the Emperor issued ^ far man complying with the wishes of the English in the matter of the rating of their goods (p. 214). In addition he sent to the President a jewelled dagger (p. 230) ; while his son, Dara Shikoh, forwarded a valuable jewel, and granted several nishdns to facilitate English trade in Sind (p. 215). Breton's accession to the post of President was signalized by a decision to extend the area of English operations by dispatching two vessels to Macao and Manilla respectively. In the case of the former, the concurrence of the Viceroy of Goa was necessary, but this was readily forthcoming. The Hind was designated for the employment, and, warned by the fate of Courteen's Bona Spcranza (p. xx), it was determined that no Portuguese goods should be carried, lest the Dutch should be given a pretext for interfering. Thurston was placed in charge of the venture, with three assistants INTRODUCTION xi (p. 165). The venture to Manilla was prompted by the hope of profiting by the rupture which had taken place between the Portu- guese and the Spaniards, and the consequent cessation of the usual trade between the Philippines and Macao ; and the instigator of the attempt was a Portuguese half-caste named De Brito, who had lived for some years at Manilla. The Seahorse was therefore fitted with a cargo, consisting largely of piece-goods, and Edward Pearcc, Thomas Breton (brother of the President), and two other factors, accompanied by De Brito, were entrusted with the management of the enterprise. She sailed in the middle of February, 1644 ; and was followed by the Hind on April 26. The two met at Goa and proceeded on their voyage together, accompanied for part of the way by the Siipply, which was bound for Achin. Soon after starting they overhauled a Malabar junk, but her crew baulked them of their prey by running the vessel ashore. It had been intended to send a fresh consignment of goods to Mokha by the Dutch Valkeiibtirg^ which was preparing for a voyage to that port ; and the proceeds were to be fetched away at the end of the season by the Supply and Francis, these vessels spending the interim in endeavouring to capture Malabar traders at the entrance of the Straits. But at the last moment the Dutch declined to accept any freight goods, as their ship had enough lading of her own ; and the consignment was therefore put aboard an Indian junk, the Saldmatl, which sailed at the end of March, 1644. The result was anything but satisfactory ; for, after battling for seventy days against contrary winds, the junk was forced to abandon the voyage and make for Gombroon, where she arrived on June 5. The goods on board were forwarded to Basra for sale (p. 266). At the end of March, likewise, the Francis and a small pinnace were dispatched to Basra, carrying Robert Cranmer and two other Englishmen. They reached their destination on June 23. The place fully maintained its reputation of being a more profitable mart than either Mokha or Gombroon (p. 208) ; and when, in the middle of January, 1645, the factors returned in the Francis to Surat, they brought with them a handsome sum of money as the proceeds of the season's sales (p. 248). Spiller, the head of the Tatta factory, spent the whole of the rainy season of 1644 in the upper districts of Sind, investigating xii THE ENGLISH FACTORIES the conditions of production and seeking for suitable places as centres for the purchase of indigo and calico. He reported that the latter was rapidly deteriorating in quality, owing to the great demand that had arisen for it of late years. As regards the former, he found that * the people are so exceedingly opprest and kept so miserably poor that, notwithstanding the soil is fertile and propper and would produce large quantities of good indicoes,they have neither will nor means to manure and sow the ground ' ; and the com- petition of the local dyers for the small quantity produced (p. 203) made it unprofitable for the English to buy there during that season, though it was determined to make a renewed attempt the following year. In England the Company, notwithstanding the general disloca- tion of trade produced by the Civil War, had succeeded in dispatching five ships to the East, viz. the Endeavour (a pinnace specially built for service in Indian waters) to the Coromandel Coast, the William and Blessing to Bantam, and the Crispiana and John to Surat. All these were the Company's own vessels, it having been found by experience that it was cheaper to build than to hire (p. 173). The three last-named left the Downs early in April, 1644, and proceeded for some time in company. Then the Loyalty ^ one of Courteen's ships, was encountered, bound for Mozambique and the Malabar Coast. The Company had arranged that the John, which, being a new ship, was an excellent sailer, should visit both places on her way to Surat, while the Crispiana was to go straight to the latter port ; it was therefore agreed that, in order to anticipate the Loyalty^Xh^ John should leave the other two behind and make for Mozambique as rapidly as possible, rejoining the Crispiana at Johanna (one of the Comoro Islands). The separation took place on May 22. During the tedious weeks that followed there was much friction between the principal men on board the John. Mucknell, the master, was a man of violent temper and much addicted to drink ; like most of the Company's sea com- manders he had risen from the ranks, and he was inclined to be conceited and jealous of interference. Edward Knipe, the chief factor, soon aroused Mucknell's resentment by urging the other officers of the ship to remonstrate with him on his dissolute behaviour ; and their relations were not improved when Knipe INTRODUCTION xiii dropped hints that he might be obliged to ask, on reaching India, that Mucknell should be deprived of his post. Henry Garry ^, the second factor, who had grievances of his own against Knipe, was accused afterwards of fomenting the discord between the other two by sympathizing with Mucknell ; but this does not appear to have been a serious element in the quarrel. Mozambique was reached on August II, and quitted ten days later. While there, Knipe arranged to provide passages for a Portuguese official, with his wife and a large suite ; and this, though it brought some personal profit to the master, was magnified by him into a fresh grievance. The ship was now speeding towards Johanna, where the Crispiana — and possibly others of the Company's vessels — would be found ; and Mucknell was manifestly ill at ease regarding Knipe's intentions towards him. The factors, on their side, suspected the master of scheming to miss the island ; and they accordingly sent him a written order to put in there without fail — a step which roused him to fury, and confirmed him in his half-formed resolution of running away with the ship if the opportunity occurred. He after- wards boasted that he had intended to do this from the first. He had personally suffered at the hands of the Parliamentary Govern- ment (pp. 199, 262), and the idea of carrying over his fine new vessel to the royalist side was an attractive one. In his maudlin moments he may have dreamed of being knighted by the King (p. 265), and in any case he might count upon being handsomely rewarded for his daring action. But, vehement as he was, he was evidently somewhat irresolute in character ; and in all probability he would not have ventured upon so risky a step had he not been goaded to it by his fear of losing his post as the result of Knipe's intended complaints. Even now, he put off all action for the present and obediently anchored his vessel at Johanna on August 25. The fact that the Crispiana had already quitted the rendezvous favoured the carrying out of Mucknell's scheme, which he now pro- ceeded to put in force. Craftily pretending to be desirous of a reconciliation with Knipe, he arranged for a dinner on shore, at which all the factors and those of the officers whom he mistrusted * Remembered in Bombay history as having been in later years Governor of that island (for King Charles) when the transfer to the East India Company took place {_see p. 245). His name is often written ' Gary * xiv THE ENGLISH FACTORIES were to be present, to celebrate a mutual forgiveness of all offences. Knipe and his associates fell easily into the trap. At the dinner (August 2^9) all was cordiality and friendliness ; but immediately after Mucknell made an excuse to leave the company for a short time, and when the rest, tired of waiting for his return, made their way down to the shore to re-embark, they saw to their amazement that the ship was under sail. The master had slipped on board and harangued the crew, begging their assistance in averting his impending disgrace, and had then proceeded to announce his inten- tion of carrying the ship back to England and handing her over to King Charles. The sailors were easily persuaded to agree, espe- cially when promised a share in the money that was on board. The Portuguese passengers were therefore sent on shore, and the John sailed away. Vivid narratives by eyewitnesses of these events will be found on pp. 196, 238, f?6i, 16%, and we must leave to them all details of the homeward voyage. It must suffice here to record that the JoJm reached the English coast in safety and was carried into Bristol, which was then being besieged by the Parliamentary forces. Her cargo, consisting chiefly of coral, was taken ashore, and being found intact when the city was stormed by Fairfax's troops, was to a great extent regained by the Company. The vessel herself was dispatched under Mucknell to prey upon Commonwealth shipping, and did considerable damage before her career was ended by ship- wreck while endeavouring to evade some of the Parliament's cruisers. Mucknell himself, according to a letter from the Company to Surat in March, 1646, ' escaped to doe future misc[h]iefe, untill Gods hand or the gallowes make an end of him ' ; and this is the last glimpse we have of the disloyal commander of the JoJin. Meanwhile the Crispiana, as already related, had met the battered Dolphin and Hopewell at Johanna, and all three had proceeded to Surat, arriving vSeptember 18. A month later, the Crispiana sailed for Sind to fetch the goods provided there for England. The Hopezvell was sent down the coast to Cochin, and on her return was sentenced to be broken up as past repair ; while the Dolphin was refitted with a view to her speedy dispatch once more for England. She departed accordingly at the end of November, 1644, with Fremlen on board, and reached the Thames the following July. INTRODUCTION xv Fremlen, it may be noted, did not long enjoy the fruits of his Indian service, for he died in March, 1646 (see Court Minutes of the East India Company, 1644-49, p. ix). Apparently he had not amassed a fortune, for Methwold, who acted as his executor, pressed the Company to pay full salary for Fremlen's last year in India, on the ground that, unless this were done, he could not discharge a legacy of 500/. to the Company's Hospital at Black wall {Ibid.^ p. 155). Probably Fremlen had sustained some loss by the disaster to the Discovery and the damage to the Dolphin in his first attempt to get to England ; while another unlucky venture of his is related by Tavernier {Les Six Voyages, ed. 1676-77, vol. ii. p. 308). According to this story, Fremlen and Breton had combined with a Jew named ' Edouard Ferdinand ' — doubtless the Duarte Fer- nandez Correa of the text — to purchase a large diamond, which was then entrusted to the Jew for sale when he went to Europe early in 1644 {infra^ p. 159). On his arrival at Leghorn he was offered a sum of about 5,600/. for it, but this he refused as insufficient. He then took the stone to Venice to get it cut. This was successfully accomplished ; but when the diamond was placed upon the wheel for polishing, it broke into nine pieces. Early in January, 1645, the Crispiana in her turn set sail for England. In the letter she carried home (p. 227) Breton and his colleagues expressed their astonishment at the non-appearance of the John, concerning which they had only heard that she had been at Mozambique. Towards the end of the same month their appre- hensions of disaster were verified by the appearance of Knipe and his associates, who, after remaining at Johanna until September 30, had then been taken off by Courteen's Thomas and John, bound for Karwar on the Malabar Coast. Easterly winds, however, forced the vessel out of her course, with the result that she was obliged to put into Kishm, in Southern Arabia, for water and pro- visions. Proceeding along the coast, a Dutch ship was met with, which was making for Surat ; and Knipe and his companions gladly accepted her captain's offer to carry them thither. Thanks to this friendly assistance, they at last reached their destination and reported to the President and Council the loss of their ship and their own subsequent sufferings. Hardly knowing what to do with so highly-paid a merchant as FOSTER VII b xvi THE ENGLISH FACTORIES Knipe, the Surat Council determined to make him chief of the Agra factory ; and an interesting account of his proceedings there will be found on p. 399. It will be noted that the operations of the English at this time extended over a considerable area, including Lucknow, though Agra remained their only permanent settlement in those parts. The blow dealt to English interests in India by the defection of the John was a severe one (p. 249). Breton and his colleagues had been counting upon her money and goods not only for the partial discharge of their heavy debt, but for the provision of means for the many enterprises they had in hand. They were now besieged on all sides with demands for the payment of their obligations, and no fresh credit could be obtained. Fortunately, on March 4 the Hind and the Seahorse returned from the Far East ; and when it became known that their voyages had proved * reasonable pros- perous \\ the clamour of the Company's creditors somewhat abated. The Hmd had reached Macao on August 7, 1644, and found there Courteen's ship William. The factors received at first ' respective enterteinement ' at the hands of the Portuguese authorities ; but this friendliness did not extend to consideration in the matter of port dues, and the rapacity of the officials, combined with the stag- nation of trade, due in part to a rebellion in China (p. 250), much reduced the profits on the voyage. The Seahorse had been hardly more successful in her pioneer voyage to Manilla. That city was found to be suffering likewise from poverty, and there was little or no market for the goods the English had brought ; while the Spanish authorities, preoccupied with the war with Holland, were displeased to find that neither iron for guns nor saltpetre for gunpowder formed part of the vessel's lading. Further, a change of Governors was impending, and the arrival of the new chief had perforce to be awaited. Jealousy on the part of the local traders and indifference on the part of the authorities still further impeded the factors' efforts. Moreover, suspicions were not wanting that they were acting either as agents for the Portuguese or spies for the Dutch ; while others averred that the ultimate object of the English was piracy. To allay these fears, Pearce and his companions decided to send back the Seahorse to Surat and themselves remain another year ; and this was accordingly done, the Governor writing at the INTRODUCTION xvii same time to urge that the next ship should bring a supply of iron and saltpetre. The long letter in which the factors related their experiences (p. 218) is of the greatest interest for its account of the state of affairs in the Philippines at this juncture. The Surat factors were not willing of their own accord to run the risk of sending a ship past the Dutch fortress of Malacca laden with munitions of war for Manilla ; but they wrote privately to the Company (p. 2,^6), suggesting that, if a permit could be obtained from the Spanish King, a vessel should proceed thither direct from England by way of the Sunda Straits ; or else that the Company should explicitly authorize such an attempt being made secretly from Surat. Meanwhile, the Supply (without any contra- band of war) was dispatched from that port for the Philippines on April 29, 1645, with orders to touch at Achin, both going and returning, and to fetch away the factors and their goods from Manilla. It was just as well that this decision had been reached, for in the letters by the 1645 fleet the Company expressed grave disapproval of both the Macao and Manilla ventures and vetoed any further attempt of the kind from Surat {O.C. 1970). Towards the close of March, 1645, the Hind and the Francis sailed in company for Mokha, whence the former was to return at once via Tuticorin, while the latter waited to bring back the factors at the close of the season. It had been intended that the Francis should from Mokha make a venture to Suakin — a project the Surat factors had for some time had in mind (pp. 213, 235, 252) — but this was found to be out of the question, in view of the lateness of her departure. Cranmer, with three assistants, was once more dis- patched to Basra in the Seahorse at the beginning of April, 1645, and reached their destination at the end of June. They found the port overcrowded with shipping and trade in poor condition. To make matters worse, on July 19 appeared two Dutch ships, fore- shadowing severe competition at a place the English had hitherto had to themselves (p. 283). The newcomers arrogantly demanded special privileges ; and although the Governor resolutely refused this claim, he was quite willing to place them on the same footing as other Europeans. With these terms they were forced to be content. They accordingly landed their goods ; and, although their sales did not amount to much, they spoiled (it was complained) the b2 xviii THE ENGLISH FACTORIES market for the English (p. 283). One of their ships departed in mid-September ; the other was accidentally burnt while preparing to follow. The Engiish factors decided to remain until the follow- ing year ; but on September 22 they dispatched to Surat the Endeavour^ which had arrived on July 26 to replace the Seahorse, as the latter vessel was, in accordance with previous arrangements, to go to Tuticorin before returning to Surat. The Endeavour reached Swally on November 5 ; and the Hind and Seahorse got back to that port together just before Christmas. In Persia at this time both the Dutch and the English were experiencing great difficulties in carrying on their trade, owing to the rapacity and insolence of the chief officials. The dwindling trade of the English — for silk was in no demand at home while civil war was raging (p. 170) — and their want of means were made the excuse for refusing their applications for the confirmation of the privileges they had enjoyed under the late King ; while all sorts of ingenious devices were employed to defraud them of their proper share of the Gombroon customs (p. 208). To this treatment the factors, seeing no remedy, had to submit with what patience they could muster. The Hollanders, having more at stake, sought to assert themselves by threatening active reprisals, but this only led to their agent being beaten and for a time imprisoned at Ispahan (p. 170). The result was seen in the appearance (April, 1645) of a strong Dutch fleet at Gombroon, with an expeditionary force intended for the capture of Kishm and Ormus (pp. 255, 257, 268). Trade at the port had already been disorganized by a severe earthquake (p. 266), and the blockade instituted by the Hollanders brought it practically to a standstill. The reply received from Ispahan to their demands proving unsatisfactory, an attempt was made to storm the Persian fort on the island of Kishm (pp. 275, 277, 308). The Dutch were repulsed ; but this proof of their warlike intentions so frightened the Persians that liberal promises of redressing all grievances were made, if they would send up repre- sentatives to the capital. Blocq, the commander of the fleet, there- upon repaired to Ispahan, but only to die soon after his arrival. Nevertheless, farmdns were obtained, granting practically all the Dutch demands (p. 307). A letter from the English factors at Ispahan in October, 1645, reported that their own negotiations INTRODUCTION xix with the King's principal minister had been cut short by his murder by certain high officials, who in their turn were executed by the order of the King (p. 296). On September 25, 1645, three ships from England — the Eagle ^ Falcon^ and Lanneret — anchored in Swally Hole. All three were new vessels, but only the first was to return for England, the other two being pinnaces intended for local traffic. They were straight- way dispatched on coasting voyages ; while the Eagle was prepared for her homeward journey, on which she set out at the beginning of 1646. In the third volume of the present series (p. xxxiv) a table was given, showing the ships sent home from Surat each year for the period 1615-29. We can now continue the list for another sixteen years, premising that the cargoes often included silk from Persia or pepper from Bantam, the cost of which cannot be separated from that of the goods of Indian origin.

During the period here dealt with, Courteen's Association was still maintaining an active competition with the East India Com- pany. In November, 1641, it dispatched three ships to the East, viz. the Bona Speranza, the Henry Bonaventnra, and the Hampton Merchant. The last-named was driven back to Plymouth by a storm ; and although she made a fresh start in February, 1642, she either gave up the voyage or was lost at sea, for we hear no more XX THE ENGLISH FACTORIES of her. Besides these three, which were designed for Sumatra, the Loyalty, Unity ^ and Hester were sent in the spring of 1642 to the western coast of India.^ All these arrived in safety at Rajapur and Karwar (p. 62) ; and the Hester managed to procure some cinnamon at Goa. A quarrel which took place in the latter port between the Hester and the Loyalty is mentioned on p. 89. In November, 1642, Knipe found the former trading at Cochin ; and on p. 109 he says that Courteen's factory at Bhatkal had been re-established. The Henry Bonaventnra and the Bona Speranza reached Achin in April and July, 1642, respectively, and endeavoured, by giving a valuable present to the Queen, to obtain a grant of a monopoly of the pepper trade on the west coast of Sumatra. In this, how- ever, they had been forestalled by the Dutch, and so they were obliged to content themselves with permission to buy return cargoes in Achin itself {Batavia Dagh- Register, 1641-42, p. 174). The Henry Bonaventnra was laden with pepper and dispatched for England ; but, meeting with a heavy storm on the way, was thrown upon the island of Mauritius and became a total wreck. Three of her crew were taken off by the Company's ship Advice in April, 1643. T^^ Bona Speranza met a different fate. She proceeded to Goa, where, after the rupture of Boreel's negotiations with the Viceroy, she accepted a freight of Portuguese goods for Macao, on the assumption that the Dutch would not venture to attack a vessel wearing the English royal colours (as Courteen's ships were privi- leged to do). This hope proved deceptive ; for in the Straits of Malacca she was met by two Dutch ships, and on her refusing to go with them to Malacca an action ensued, with the result that the English vessel was taken and her cargo confiscated (pp. 128, 129, 148). Some time in 1643 Courteen dispatched to Achin a vessel called the Little William. In the middle of June she was wrecked on the African coast ; but the crew managed to save a quantity of money she had on board, and after a hazardous voyage in their ' On p. 29 we find the Company declaring confidently that these would be the last ships sent out by Courteen, a Parliamentary Committee having ordered him to withdraw his factors and goods. The evidence on the latter point is inconclusive (see Court Minutes, 1640-43, pp. 242, 265); but if the order was ever issued, it was disregarded, as will be seen below. * INTRODUCTION xxi longboat reached Madagascar at the end of August. In May, 1644, they were picked up by the Company's ship Endeavour^ and carried to Madras, where, for want of means to convey it to any of Courteen's factories, the money was paid into the Company's treasury — an arrangement which led to long controversies both in England and India. In January, 1644, we hear that two more of Courteen's ships — the Planter and the William (Captain Blackman) — had arrived in Indian waters, and that the former had returned to England with a cargo consisting chiefly of saltpetre (p. 148). The Association's factors were in difficulties at Goa, Raybag, and Achin for want of money, and Blackman was at a loss how to employ his ship with any prospect of profit. In April, however, armed with a licence from the Viceroy, he sailed for Macao, returning early in 1645 by way of Achin and Colombo (p. 254). At the latter place he found the new Viceroy, with whom he made an agreement to bring out in his next voyage a quantity of munitions of war, to be exchanged at Goa for cinnamon (p. 254). In July of that year he was met, homeward-bound, at St. Augustine's Bay by the Company's out- going fleet (p. 312). The ships designed for the East by the interlopers in 1644 were five in number, viz. the Sun^ Hester^ James^ Thomas ajid Jo/m, and Loyalty, The primary purpose of the first three was to carry out a number of planters who were (in accordance with a scheme initiated by a certain Captain Bond) ' to erect a new commonwealth in Madagascar ' (p. 176), a project which turned out a dismal failure.^ The Loyalty arrived on the Malabar Coast in the autumn, and was dispatched to Gombroon with a small quantity of freight goods (p. 217). Both she and the Thomas and John found the Malabar factories heavily in debt, and as neither ship brought any means (P- '^55) the prospect looked hopeless. From Gombroon the Loyalty went on to Basra, arriving there early in August (p. 283), and departing again on October 11 (p. 299). The intrusion of the interlopers' shipping into ports where the Company had long maintained factories was a clear infringement of the rights reserved to the latter in the grant of 1637 to Courteen's ^ See Court Minutes of the East India Company y 1644-49, Introduction, p. vi ; also my article in the English Historical Revieiv for April, 1912. xxii THE ENGLISH FACTORIES Association \\ and naturally it aroused much indignation among the servants of the older body. At Gombroon the arrival of the Loyalty produced a protest from the factors there, to which an insolent reply was returned (p. 276) ; and when at Surat itself one of Cour- teen's ships, the Hester^ appeared in September, 1645, flaunting the royal colours, the Company's factors, having three vessels at their disposal, determined on drastic action. Her commander was pre- vented from landing or embarking any goods and was forced to haul down his flag (p. 286). In July, 1645, we hear of another of Courteen's ships, the James, as being at Madagascar outward- bound (p. 312), and later she was met at Rajapur [O.C. 1970). Of the general position of the interlopers the Surat factors wrote in January, 1646 (O.C. 1970) that 'they have scarcely credit enough to buy clothes to keep their bodies warme, although the climate requires not many.' The Thomas and John had started for Eng- land too late and had been forced to return to Goa, where she spent the rainy season and then resumed her homeward voyage. The Sun had gone to Persia with a cargo of logs from Madagascar ; and another interloping vessel, the Lioness, under Captain Brook- haven, had reached Rajapur from England, having visited Guinea — now a regular resort of Courteen's ships — on the way. The Loyalty was still in Indian waters seeking a cargo for England. How prosperous the Hollanders were at this period is abundantly testified by the documents here calendared (cf. pp. 32, 217, 255). Not only in the Far East but in Arabia, Persia, and India itself, they easily outdistanced their English rivals, alike in the number of their ships and the extent of their resources. On p. 142 we find a complaint that at Surat the Indian merchants preferred to put their goods on board Dutch vessels rather than on English, ' finde- ing there much better accomodacion and noe less safety ', with the result that the Hollanders had carried off all the freight goods then available. The fact that two of the vessels sent out to India by the English Company in 1643 were Dutch-built was a further 'dis- creditt to our nation, whilst this people (who know noe better) enquire whether England doth not afifoard shipping of its owne, that it is enforced to seeke and buy them among strangers ' (p. 141). As there are many references in the present volume to the rela- ^ See Court Minutes of the East India Cofnpany, 1635-39, p. 275. , INTRODUCTION xxiii tions between the Dutch and the Portuguese, a few notes on tie subject may be found helpful. The treaty concluded at the Hague between Holland and Portugal in June, 1641,^ provided for a ces- sation of hostilities during a period often years, each party retaining the territory which should be in its possession at the time of the publication of the peace. However, the Dutch authorities in the East were by no means willing to be stopped in their career of victory ; and, when in the autumn of 1641 the Viceroy at Goa sent a special embassy to Batavia to beg for a truce pending the arrival of the ratified treaty from Europe, he was met with a refusal on the ground that formal instructions had not yet been received from Holland. A fresh fleet blockaded Goa during the cold weather of 1641-42 ; while in April, 1642, the Portuguese settlement of Nega- patam, on the Coromandel Coast, was taken without resistance, but was ransomed for an immediate payment of io,oco rials of eight and a promise of 40,000 more, an undertaking which was never carried out. In the autumn, however, the arrival of the necessary documents at Batavia left the Governor-General and his Council no option in the matter. Accordingly the truce was formally pro- claimed there on October 7 (N.S.) ; and a fortnight later Pieter Boreel left for Malacca, Ceylon, India, &c., to notify the various authorities and to arrange matters with the Portuguese. Difficulties soon arose. In Ceylon the Dutch claimed the district immediately round Galle, in spite of the fact that it was actually in the occu- pation of the Portuguese, who had cooped up the Hollanders within the walls of the town. This demand being refused, Boreel left without proclaiming the peace, and sailed to Goa, where he arrived at the beginning of April, 1643 (N.S.). He was courteously re- ceived and treated with every consideration ; but the Viceroy refused to give way on the points in dispute, and on the 27th Boreel re-embarked and hoisted the red flag, in token that hostilities would be resumed. The Dutch now actively prosecuted the war in all parts. The results were not entirely to their satisfaction. In May the Portuguese inflicted a defeat upon them near Galle in Ceylon ; while in the following month the Paiiw, returning richly laden from Persia, sought shelter from a storm in Marmagao (near Goa), under the impression that the war was over ; whereupon the ^ The text will be found in Biker's Tratados (vol. ii. p. loS). xxiv THE ENGLISH FACTORIES Portuguese took possession of both ship and cargo, until such time as peace should be proclaimed. In the autumn of 1643 a fresh fleet was dispatched from Batavia under Klaas Kornelisz. Blocq to blockade Goa, while another under Fran9ois Caron was sent to prosecute the war in Ceylon. Landing at Galle, the Dutch marched to attack the Portuguese army, which was commanded by de Motta Galvao ; but the latter had so skil- fully chosen his position that Caron did not venture to assail him, and was forced to return to Galle. Colombo was next reconnoitred, with the result that it was pronounced too strong to be attacked with any prospect of success ; and so the fleet passed on to Ne- gombo, a fortress twenty miles to the northwards, which the Portu- guese had retaken from the Dutch towards the close of 1640. Here Caron was more successful. The too confident Portuguese allowed the Hollanders to land, thinking then to overwhelm them ; however, in the sharp conflict that followed the Dutch were victorious, and, entering the gate together with the fugitives, they quickly made themselves masters of the fortress (January 9, 1644 N.S.).^ Caron now marched upon Colombo ; but close to the city he found a river held so strongly by the enemy that further progress was impossible, and he was obliged to retrace his footsteps and content himself with diligently strengthening his new possession.- In March, 1644, he set out on his return voyage to Batavia. In the meantime Blocq, from his station at the bar of Goa, nego- tiated in vain with the Viceroy for the surrender of the Pauw and her lading. He remained at his post till April, 1644, and then sailed for Batavia to report to the Governor-General. Advantage was taken of his departure to send an expedition to Ceylon, and in May Negombo was beleaguered. In July the Portuguese attempted to carry it by storm, but were beaten back with great loss ; and in the following month they abandoned the siege. It was now decided at Batavia to depute Jan Maatzuiker, a member of the Council there and afterwards Governor-General (1653-78), to take up the negotiations at Goa ; and with him went Blocq with a powerful ^ Lisbon Transcripts, Doc.

They reached their destination in September, 1644, and after some trouble an arrangement was reached on November 10 (N.S.)\\ by which Negombo and Galle were left in the hands of the Dutch, pending the conclusion of a fresh agreement between the two nations in Europe regarding Ceylon, and the Paiiw was surrendered, with all her cargo ; while on the other hand the Dutch agreed to pay 100,000 rials of eight in satisfaction for the ships they had seized at Goa and Malacca subsequent to the date on which the Hague treaty ought to have taken effect. Thus the long warfare between the Dutch and the Portuguese came at last to an end. The cessation of hostilities between those two nations was viewed with some misgivings by the English merchants. The Portuguese no longer needed the aid of the latter in maintaining communi- cations with Macao and other possessions ; while, with Goa once more open to shipping from Lisbon, their competition in the sale of coral and other European goods in the Deccan was increasingly felt. A more serious outcome was that the cinnamon which the Portuguese, while the Dutch blockaded their ports, were quite willing to sell to the English, was no longer likely to be available. The new King of Portugal had in December, 1642, thrown open to his subjects the trade in all Indian commodities except cinnamon and other spices, which were reserved as a royal monopoly. In consequence the Viceroy was charged to do his best to prevent the sale of any to the English ; and, although these orders were not put into execution immediately (p. 205), the Surat factors wrote in January, 1645, that it would be useless to send a ship to the Mala- bar Coast, ' being it is most certaine that neither pepper nor cinamon wilbe acquirable' (p. 231). In acting thus, the Portuguese were of course entirely within their rights, and their proceedings caused no alteration in the cordial relations which had subsisted between Surat and Goa ever since the conclusion of the Accord by Methwold in January, 1635. At times, it is true, the English merchants grew a little tired of Portu- guese punctiliousness in the matter of correspondence (pp. 16, 210) ; but the solid benefits resulting from the free intercourse of the two ^ The text will be fotind in Biker's Tratados, vol. ii. p. 138; Heeres's Corpus Diplo- maiicum, part i. p. 429; Baldaeus's Malabor-Choromandel, p. 92; &c. There is also a copy among the Hague Trmiscripts at the India Office (series i. vol. xiv. no. 445). xxvi THE ENGLISH FACTORIES nations in India easily made up for incidental annoyances. In England attempts were not wanting to turn the truce into a more permanent arrangement. The treaty concluded with Portugal in 1642 (p. 30) provided that the Accord should remain in force, and that commissioners should be appointed on both sides to settle outstanding questions. The Company had already approached the Portuguese ambassador on the subject ; but he had replied that he had no power to deal with the matter, at the same time assuring them that the truce would be ' inviolably kept ' on the part of his fellow countrymen and promising that, should the latter desire to terminate the arrangement, two years' notice should be given in place of the six months previously stipulated (p. 30). At the beginning of 1643 ^^^ Portuguese Agent requested the Company to nominate commissioners in India to negotiate further ; where- upon President Fremlen and four others of the chief factors at Surat were suggested. However, the Company's letters to King Charles at Oxford, asking for a royal commission for the purpose, remained unanswered ; and since it seemed hopeless to obtain such a document * in these distracted tymes ', the Deputy-Governor (Methwold) and certain others were instructed to treat with the Portuguese Agent and induce him to write a letter to Goa explain- ing the position of affairs {Court Minutes, 1640-43, pp. 300, 371). It now remains for us to deal with the events of this period on the eastern side of India. At the close of the last volume the English headquarters on that coast had just been fixed permanently in the new fort at Madraspatam by the Agent, Andrew Cogan. At Masulipatam Thomas Peniston was in charge ; while at Balasore, in the Bay of Bengal, John Yard was supposed to be winding up affairs with a view to abandoning the trade in those parts, in obedi- ence to the orders he had received to that effect. As a matter of fact, he did make a start for Masulipatam about the middle of January, 164:^ ; but meeting with bad weather he returned to Bala- sore, and commerce in the ' Bay ' went on as before. Towards the end of January, 1642, the Diaviond, though both small and leaky, was dispatched with a cargo of goods for Bantam, and got to that port with much difficulty in the middle of June. Some time before, the pinnace Advice had sailed for Gombroon, where she arrived on February 9, and left again on March 25, INTRODUCTION xxvii reaching Fort St. George on April 29 and Masulipatam a few days later. The next event of importance on the Coast recorded in these papers is the arrival at Fort St. George from England, on July 5, 1642, of the Hopewell^ commanded by Andrew Trumball. Her cargo was under the charge of Francis Day, who had orders to use it solely for the purposes of the First General Voyage and not to allow any of the money to be absorbed in the payment of the debts of the Third Joint Stock ; but, as was explained later (p. 113), this was found to be impossible, for no fresh investments could be nego- tiated until existing liabilities had been met, and it was therefore found expedient to employ part of the Hopeiveirs capital in dis- charging the debts at Masulipatam. From that port the Hopewell, accompanied by the Advice, sailed in August for the Bay, where she spent two and a half months, leaving again on December i. The Advice had been dispatched from Balasore on November 7 and got back to Madraspatam at Christmas. During the Hopewell's stay the English factory at Hariharpur seems to have been closed (p. 126), partly on account of the silting-up of the mouth of the Patua^, and Balasore thus became the only English station in Bengal (or rather Orissa). From the latter place Day wrote in November, deprecating its abandonment, and declaring that it was *noe such dispisable place as is voted, it beinge an opulent kingdome and you haveinge bin already at great charges in gain- inge the free custome of all sorts of goods '. The unwillingness of the factors to cease trading in the Bay, however unprofitable the results were to their employers, is to some extent explained by Trumball's revelations on p. 72 concerning the large amount of private trade on board the Hopeivell belonging to Day and to the Masulipatam factors. On p. 43 we have a vivid account of the stabbing of an English soldier at Madraspatam by a Portuguese, who was thereupon executed (August 13), much to the indignation of his fellow countrymen. We hear also about this time that the Nayak to ' Walter Clavell in his account of Balasore (1676) says that it was found that 'the cloth of Harrapore (where our first factory was settled) was without much difficulty to be brought hither by land and, the river where our vessells usually had laine at being stop't up, it was noe easy matter to bring the cloth by sea, nor soe safe to have vessells ride before that place, as here in the roade of Ballasore' (77/^ Diaries of Streynsham Master^ vol. ii. p. 84). xxviii THE ENGLISH FACTORIES whom Armagon belonged had been crushed between the Hindu and Muhammadan powers, now again at war. The Golconda army had overrun part of his territory, and the rest (including Armagon itself) had been occupied by a neighbouring Nayak, to whom apparently the defence of the frontier had been entrusted by his uncle, Venkatapati, the King of Vijayanagar. At the beginning of October the King died, and after a short delay this nephew was elevated to the throne as Sri Ranga Rayalu, though many of the other Nayaks were opposed to his succession, and gave him a great deal of trouble. On September 20, 1642, Cogan and his colleagues wrote to Bantam, enclosing a list of their debts and coolly admitting the falsity of their statement made eighteen months earlier that they had cleared off all liabilities. The Agent also intimated his intention of proceeding to Bantam in the Advice early in the new year, leaving Day to fill his place ; this proposal, however, was resisted by Day and the other factors, and thereupon Cogan con- sented to remain. Another letter written at the same time to the Company mentions that the factory at Golconda had been with- drawn, leaving behind many irrecoverable debts ; and it goes on to deny indignantly charges of extravagant expenditure, and to make a cogent defence of the policy of fortifying at Madraspatam. In point of fact the logic of events soon justified the action that had been taken by Day and Cogan ; for, had not the English established themselves in a strong position before the Golconda troops overran the neighbouring country, the history of Fort St. George would probably never have been written. The Fort was at this time * better then half finished', and 'of such force, with the few wee have, that wee feare not what any can doe against us, espetially so long as wee have our Naique to our freind, or the sea open to furnish us with food ' (p. 51). Of the private lives of the factors there, some curious details will be found on p. 76. A consultation held on December 29 records that * a third bulwarke of turfe ' had lately been raised, on which it was decided to mount four guns from the Advice. The cause assigned for taking this precaution is that the factors found ' the warrs and broyles increasing in this countrey, and now (by reason of our Great Naiques imprisonment) drawing nere to us' (p. 70). INTRODUCTION xxix Damarla Venkatappa, under whose protection the English had settled at Madraspatam, was, it appears, violently opposed to the new ruler of Vijayanagar and, in order to secure his own position; opened negotiations with the Golconda invaders. Sri Ranga, detecting his treason, seized and imprisoned him, and stripped him of most of his territories (pp. 70, 80). Thereupon Damarla's brother levied troops to rescue him ; and Sri Ranga, harassed on every side, was fain to pardon and reinstate his rebellious vassal. The Advice was dispeeded from the Coast to Bantam at the beginning of January, 1643. On the arrival of the Hopewell at Fort St. George from Bengal towards the end of December, 1642, it was decided to send her on a voyage to Persia instead of to Bantam (as first intended) and on her return to dispatch her direct to England, for which purpose the Agent asked for a supply of pepper from Bantam. She sailed accordingly on December 30, reached Gombroon March 7, 1643, and got back to Madras on May 19. The proposal to send her home direct was not persisted in ; and the factors afterwards explained that this was only contemplated in the event of her not returning in time to continue her voyage for Bantam (p. 114). John Yard sailed from Balasore in the junk Endeavo2ir on November 25, 1642, leaving Robert Hatch alone there. * For ought wee can perceive', wrote the Madras factors (p. 78), 'by the relation of Mr. Day &c., Mr. John Yard hath but said the truth in all his letters concerning the fruitfulnes of Bengalla and the profitt that may be made to and from that place, if 'twere stocked as it ought'. This, however, was the difficulty, seeing how scarce money was on the Coast ; and the Fort St. George factors could only leave it to the President and Council at Bantam either to order ' our absolute abandoninge those parts or furnish it as it ought to bee' (p. 78). At some unascertained date a ' cowl ' {qanl) had been obtained from the former King (Venkatapati) confirming the concessions made to the English at Madraspatam (p. 156)^ ; and it seems to ' Among the title-deeds handed over by Governor Gyfford to his successor in 1687 was ' one gold covvle plated from Yencraputty RaywoUy ' {Madras Cousjdtatiofis of July 30, 1687,' quoted by Col. Love). This seems to have been the grant here referred to ; and it may further be identified with ' the ancient phirmaund of this place granted by a Jentue king ' which was lost at sea about 1693 (see my Founding of Fort St. George, p. 4.3). XXX THE ENGLISH FACTORIES have been found necessary, early in 1643, to send a present, through the Nayak, to Sri Ranga Rayalu, ' to have our priviledges confirmd ' (p. 115). Nothing is said as to the result; but apparently no formal grant was obtained from the new monarch until Greenhill's mission in 1645, described later. At least this seems to be implied in the statement (p. 290) that the object of that mission was 'the reconfirmation of what was graunted unto Mr. Cogan by the great Nague under whose protection formerly wee liv'd.' As we have seen, the Hopewell got back to Madras from Persia in May, 1643. Relations had long been strained between Day and Trumball, the master of the vessel ; while the latter's peculiar methods of discipline had aroused much resentment among his subordinates. When, therefore, the Agent and his Council decided to send the Hopewell down the Coast to Tranquebar, a serious situation arose, for not only Day but many of the officers and crew refused to sail with Trumball. The latter afterwards alleged to the Company at home that he was the victim of a plot on the part of Day and the other factors, who resented his opposition to their private trade, and that the sailors were inveigled into bringing accusations against him, in order to supply a pretext for his removal. There is, however, evidence enough that his violence was strongly resented on board ; while the fact that the Company, after investigating his charges against Day, re-employed the latter, suggests that Trumball failed to prove his case. To get over the immediate difficulty, Cogan and his Council suspended the master from his post, and sent the vessel to Tranquebar under the care of Day and the chief mate. On her return, in the middle of August, Trumball was permitted to resume charge, as the factors were unwilling to take the responsibility of ousting him altogether from a post to which he had been appointed by the Company. This decision, however, had perforce to be reconsidered. Day flatly declared that he would rather resign and proceed overland to Surat than venture upon a fresh voyage with Trumball ; while those of the ship's company who had lodged complaints were equally unwilling to place themselves once more at the mercy of the enraged master. In this emergency Cogan, who was still anxious to get away from the Coast, suggested that D^ should INTRODUCTION xxxi take his place as Agent, and that he himself should proceed to Bantam in command of the ship ; and since no better way out of the difficulty could be found, the proposal was adopted. Day accordingly became Agent for the Coast, while Cogan departed for Masulipatam and Bantam in the Hopewell on August 28, 1643. From Bantam he sailed for England in December following. In a letter carried by the Hopewell the Madras factors wrote that the country was in the throes of civil war, * one Nague against another, and most against the King ' ; but the latter, by means of a large present, had induced the King of Bijapur to send an army to his assistance, and he was therefore likely to gain the upper hand (p. 115). They also announced the arrival of the Advice^ which, in obedience to orders from home, had been dispatched from Bantam the previous spring on a voyage of discovery. She had missed the Cocos-Keeling Islands (one of the objects of her search) ; and although, after touching at Rodriguez and Mauritius, she reached Reunion, her officers failed to recognize in that island the one called ' the English Forest ', of which they were in quest (p. 119). They were little more successful in their attempts to obtain negro slaves at the Comoros. From Fort St. George the Advice proceeded to the Bay, returning from thence towards the end of January, 1 644. On September 23, 1643, the Hart from England anchored in Madras Roads, bringing 10,000/. in specie and six chests of coral. With the bulk of her cargo she was sent on to Masulipatam, to discharge the most pressing of the Company's debts and to make an investment for Bantam. She quitted the former port on October 21, and reached Bantam in the middle of December. The Bantam factors, writing in January, 1644, mention that Day had chosen William Netlam, who had just come out in the Hart^ to proceed to Bengal and take charge of affairs there — an arrangement of which they strongly disapproved (p. 134).^ Netlam duly repaired to Balasore (p. 207), and on p. 193 William Gurney is also mentioned as being there ; but it would seem that Robert Hatch remained in charge at that place until he was relieved by * In a list of factors printed on p. 132, Hatch and Travell are mentioned as the only factors in Bengal at this time ; but the list was compiled at home, from such particulars as were available, and it seems improbable that Travell ever went thither (cf. pp. 120, 154). FOSTER Vll ^ xxxii THE ENGLISH FACTORIES Henry Olton, who arrived there in the Endeavotir in the autumn of 1644. A letter from Madras dated in January, 1644, and sent to Bantam by the Advice, is full not only of the usual lamentations of want of means but also of apprehensions of actual violence. Damarla, it appears, was once more in disgrace and, it would seem, in rebellion ; and his place had been given to Malaya, a merchant who had grown wealthy through acting as the principal agent of the Dutch in their commercial transactions. Moved either by ambition or by a fear of being plundered himself should others get the upper hand, he was now taking an active part in support of Sri Ranga, and with the help of the Dutch was busily engaged in subduing the district which had been assigned to him. This brought him in collision with the English, for he demanded from them the surrender of their control over the revenues of the town of Madraspatam (p. 156). To such a claim the factors were determined never to yield ; but they manifestly feared lest they should be attacked by Malaya, and they suspected — quite wrongly, it would seem — that the Dutch were at the bottom of the whole affair, their aim being ' to have the sole trade of the coast ' (p. 154). However, a fresh turn in the unstable politics of Vijayanagar soon relieved them from their apprehensions. Malaya came in his turn under suspicion of treason and was dismissed from his new post. A small vessel from England named the Endeavour (not to be confused with the junk of the same name which Yard had bought in Bengal) reached Fort St. George at the beginning of July, 1644, and was thence sent to Masulipatam. From the latter port she proceeded to Chicacole and Balasore. The money she had brought out sufficed to pay the debts at Madras ; while on August 4 the Swan arrived from Bantam with a fair cargo and a new Agent in the person of Thomas Ivy. Writing in the following month to the Company by that vessel (then about to return, with Day on board, to Bantam), Ivy and his colleagues stated that up to that time Fort St. George had cost for building nearly 2,300/., and 2,000/. more would be required to finish it. Three out of the four bastions had been completed ^ ; but the fourth was yet lacking, as also the ^ Cogan, when interrogated at home concerning the state of the building, declared that * three bulwarcks and the tower (or house) in the midst is finished, and 'S\\ peaces of INTRODUCTION xxxiii connecting walls and the necessary warehouses and lodging rooms. The garrison numbered fifty, at a cost of a little more than a pound a month each ; and double that number would be needed when the Fort was finished. The factors were still unhappy, for, though they had now received the desired supply of money, they found that the Dutch had already secured all the calicoes worth buying. They had, however, made up a cargo for the Swan, consisting of some rather inferior piece-goods, indigo, and gunpowder. The neighbour- ing districts were in a disturbed state, owing to a fresh invasion by the troops of the King of Golconda. The commander of this army had summoned the Dutch at Pulicat to submit, and the English expected to be attacked in their turn ; but they were relieved by the sudden appearance of a Hindu force, which completely routed the invaders (p. 193). The Endeavour returned to Masulipatam from Bengal, bringing with her Robert Hatch, in November, 1644; and a month later she was dispatched to Persia and Surat. On January 6, 1645, the Sea- flower arrived from Bantam and was sent on to Fort St. George for a return cargo. This procured, she started on her voyage back to Bantam on May 5. At the end of July the Advice reached Madras from that port, and was thereupon sent down the coast to Tegna- patam, where she embarked a large quantity of goods that had been prepared for her. With these she got back to Fort St. George on September 7, and was then dispatched to Masulipatam to complete her lading for Bantam. A letter from Madras dated September 8, 1645, advised that a quarrel between the Dutch and Malaya, who was backed by the Vijayanagar monarch, had resulted in open warfare, and that con- sequently Pulicat was in a state of siege. The piece-goods in the hands of weavers employed by the Dutch had been seized upon by Malaya's soldiers, and the factors were much exercised over the question whether it would be safe to purchase these from the captors, as they were being urged to do. Their hesitation was increased by the threats of the Dutch to search all English ships and take out of them any cloth thus acquired ; but they were somewhat en- ordnance mounted er I came from thence, and some part of the materialls provided to goe on with the rest.' See The Founding of Fort St. George, p. 23, and Court Minutes of the East India Company, 1644-49, PP* 54~57* xxxiv THE ENGLISH FACTORIES couraged by the receipt, on October i, of a letter from Sri Ranga, declaring that the seizures had been made by his authority and desiring them to complete the purchase (p. 285). At the same time he invited them to send a representative to his court ; and as this seemed a fitting opportunity ' to have our old priviledges re- confirmM, with the adition of a great many more ', it was decided to depute thither the Second in Council, Henry Greenhill, with four other Englishmen as attendants. No details have come down to us of Greenhill's proceedings at Vellore, but the grant that resulted, dated in November, 1645, is printed on p. 305. It followed much the same lines as the original concession from the Nayak Damarla Venkatappa. The English were freed from all customs or duties at the port on their mer- chandise, and also from tolls on provisions brought from the inland districts ; while their goods passing through the district of Puna- mallee were to pay, as before, only half the usual duties. The customs paid by other merchants were to be shared with the royal treasury. The town of Madraspatam and a piece of ground adjoin- ing were made over to the English, and they were authorized to administer the 'government and justice' of the same. The con- cession regarding goods recovered from wrecks was renewed ; and a promise was given that the settlement should be independent of the control of any of the neighbouring Nayaks. Nothing was said regarding the right of mintage previously granted. One interesting point about this grant is that the new settlement is therein designated Srirarigarayapatam — the term obviously applying only to the Fort and its surroundings, since Madraspatam is separately mentioned. As noted in the introduction to the previous volume (p. xlii), the new settlement had been previously known to the natives as Chennappapatam, after Damarla's father. The explanation seems to be that the King at this time bestowed his own name upon the town, as a mark of favour and in order to wipe out the memory of a family now in disgrace.^ It is not sur- prising to find that this attempt to alter a well-established designa- tion proved a failure ; and to this day a form of the old name is still used by natives of Madras. No vessel being available for dispatch to Bengal this season, the ^ See the remarks on p. 32 of my Founding of Fort St. George. , INTRODUCTION xxxv Madras Council ordered Olton, whom they intended to make chief at Viravasaram, to take passage from Balasore to Masuh'patam in a Dutch vessel, leaving Netlam in charge at the former place ; and they intimated their intention of closing before long ' that unproffit- table factorie ', where there was * litle or noe bussiness ' (p. 293). Olton duly obeyed these directions and, after handing over the remaining cash to Netlam, proceeded to Fort St. George (O.C. 1981). The present volume introduces us to Gabriel Boughton, the English surgeon whose professional skill is generally alleged to have been the means of obtaining for his nation important privileges in Bengal. The story, as given in Stewart's History of Bengal (p. ^^51), is that in 1636, the Emperor's daughter, Jahanara, having been badly burnt owing to an accident, a message was sent to Surat desiring the assistance of a European surgeon ; that Boughton, the surgeon of the Hopewell^ was thereupon sent to court and was successful in effecting a cure ; and that, upon being invited to name his reward, he magnanimously refused to accept anything for him- self, but requested * that his nation might have liberty to trade free of all duties to Bengal, and to establish factories in that country '. The narrative adds that, this privilege having been duly granted, Boughton proceeded to Pippli, and in 1638, an English ship hap- pening to arrive in that port, he, in virtue of his grant, secured for her merchants complete exemption from customs duties ; and that later on, by curing a favourite of Shah Shuja, the Emperor's second son, who was then Governor of Bengal, he greatly increased his influ- ence and was able to assist his countrymen to start factories at Balasore and Hugli, in addition to that at Pippli. This account is demonstrably wrong in dates and in several other respects. The English never had a factory at Pippli ; while that at Balasore owed nothing to Boughton^'s assistance. Moreover, as pointed out by Yule and others, the accident to the Princess occurred early in 1644, when the court was at Delhi ; and not only would it have been impossible to procure a surgeon from Surat in time to be of any service, but we are expressly told, from an Indian source, that her recovery was due to a famous Lahore physician. The actual facts of Boughton's deputation are given on p. 229 of the present volume. Asalat Khan, a prominent official xxxvi THE ENGLISH FACTORIES at court, had repeatedly asked for an English surgeon ; and the arrival of the Hopewell, in September, 1644, enabled the President and Council to gratify his wishes. According to the memorandum referred to below, Boughton, her surgeon, had been at Madras (though no trace of his presence there can be found in the extant records) and had proceeded thence to Bantam in 1643, with the intention of going home. The vessel's failure to complete her voyage left him at Surat, we are told, penniless ; and this would account for his readiness, there being no other opportunity of employment, to enter the service of Asalat Khan. It is not clear when he started to take up his new post; and the Surat factors make no further mention of him, as they certainly would have done had any important grant of privileges resulted from his mission. An interesting letter recently discovered (see the Indian Antiquary for May, 191 2) shows, however, that he was with Asalat Khan at Balkh in 1646; and we shall hear something of him in later years from the other side of India. Meanwhile we may note that, on the death of his patron in 1647, Boughton seems to have proceeded to the court of Shah Shuja, in Bengal. There, it is said, he cured a favourite member of the Prince's haram, with the result that he gained considerable influence with the Shah and was able to afford useful help to his fellow countrymen when they were seeking to establish themselves at Hugh in 1651. Boughton himself died in 1653 or 1653. The question of the source from which Stewart drew his version of the story is not without interest. Stewart's own reference is unintelligible ; but the fact that much the same account, though in a briefer form, was given at an earlier date by Orme in his Military Transactions has enabled both to be traced to a document now preserved in vol. xxx (p. 0^^ of the Fort St. George Factory Records in the India Office.^ This is a copy of a memorandum written in February, 1685, by some factor in Bengal, giving an account of the origin and progress of the English settlement in that province ; and it evidently embodies the tradition then current of Boughton's share in procuring the necessary privileges. Its inac- curacies are therefore easily explained. We may further note that ^ See an ''article by me in the Indian Antiquary for September, 191 1, where this document is printed in full. » I INTRODUCTION xxxvii a rather earlier embodiment of the legend is to be found in Thomas Bovvrey's Geographical Account of the Countries round the Bay of Bengal^ 1669-79 (Hakluyt Society, 1905). In this no mention is made of the cure of the Princess Jahanara, while Mir Jumla is substituted for Shah Shuja as Boughton's second patron. Several references occur in the present instalment (pp. 9, 200, 232, 312) to the operations of the French in Madagascar and elsewhere; while on p. 134 there is an allusion to Tasman's discoveries in the South Seas. Among other points of interest, attention may be directed to the remarks on pp. 136 and 202 concerning the decline of indigo cultivation ; also to the account given on the latter page of the practice of mixing that commodity with sand. On pp. 161 and 216 we find references to marine insurance at Surat. Dhanji, the Company's broker at Agra^ whose moving account of the death of John Drake was given in the last volume, was, we hear, dismissed in 1644 for negligence and dis- respect, and ' chiefly for endeavouring to distroy Mr. Turner by sorcery' (p. 215). Finally, on p. 152 we have an interesting epilogue to the story of John Leachland and his Indian wife, showing the efforts made by the Surat Council to dispose respec- tably of the daughter who was the offspring of that ill-starred union.

Found that Mr. Hall had arrived from Ispahan two days before. The whole cargo was put on shore in good condition, and the passengers were ' well content, loving, and courteous.' So also was the Sultan [i. e. the Governor] until a dispute arose between him and Mr. Wheeler as to the number of Englishmen to be allowed to watch at the custom-house. The result was that on January 4 those employed in this duty were attacked by about three hundred men, who killed one of them, seized the rest and carried them to the Sultan's door, where they were so unmercifully beaten that some died. ' Had it not bene for the Companies estate on shoare and the merchants lives theare resident, I would have heaved out all the ballast which I had formerly taken in and a runn the Discovery ashoare at three quarter flud before the towne (for its all soft oose), and then with Gods assistance I would not a doubted but to a beate theire durty brittle towne and castle about theire eares ; and I hope to live to be employed about some such action or some other to be revenged on such unmercilesse dogs, who hath so barbarously and cruelly tortured and murthered these poore honest men.'

Rejoiced to hear of the safe arrival of four ships and wish the Jewel had been among them. Fear that all hope of her safety must now be abandoned, especially as she was a slow and unsafe vessel. Similarly, the Pearly Comfort^ Swan^ and Expedition were all bad sailers and much slower than the Dutch ships. Trust that in future the Company will buy or build vessels like the Coaster or Caesar and not ' such mishapen ill conditioned cole tubbs ' as those mentioned. Are glad that the letters forwarded by way of Basra arrived seasonably. Thank the Company for the men and stores now sent for their small shipping. Reprisals are made upon the Malabars at every opportunity. The Seahorse and Francis^ in March last, soon after leaving Swally for Basra, captured three Malabar vessels laden with coco-nuts, &c. Fourteen of the principal men were made prisoners, two of the vessels were burnt, and the rest of the Malabars were turned adrift in the third without sail or oars. They got to Surat, with the aid of one of the Mogul's junks, and there demanded justice from the Governor. He, however, ' having some few dales before bine beholding to us for undertaking convoy of his junck to Bussora (which then in company of your vessells voiaged) and bringing thence horses, for which hee covenanted to pay yow five tomands fraught for each horse his servants bought and delivered us for transport hither, and a rupee for each abassee * None of the letters mentioned is extant.

Unto this, though wee were in a manner inforced to submit, because the Governor pretending that the coast trending somewhat below Bullsar is his Kings and therfore ought properly so farr to protect such as would trade to his ports, yet wee consented with so much seeming un- willingnes that the Mallabars doe hardly credit us.' In point of fact the cargoes which the latter bring to Surat are of such small value that they are not worth troubling about. ' The best way to revenge you of them, and repaire your losses, is to waylay their vessells bound to Aden and Mocha.' The Supply was sent thither for that purpose, but arrived too late ; however, the Francis goes to Mokha shortly and will, it is hoped, have better success, ' notwithstanding the maenaces Esquire Courtyns grand Captain Hall delivered in Mr. Prowds hearing that, if wee disturbed or surprized the Mallabars, hee or his subordinates would affoard like measure to the Guzuratt juncks whearever they encountred them.

Are glad that satisfaction has been recovered from Gosnoll for the missing bale of calicoes ; and have warned other pursers that they are responsible for all goods included in their bills of lading. Will say no more about their controversy with the factors in Persia, though they are of opinion that good has resulted, as the factors V, 2 4 THE ENGLISH FACTORIES have since shown much greater diligence. The orders to Agent Merry to return to India were forwarded to Gombroon by the Discovery on November i8. Owing to the large quantities of broadcloth brought out in private trade, the Company's consign- ment had to be sent to Persia for sale. Merry will on arrival be admitted to the Surat Council, as directed. Possibly he may be sent to Ahmadabad to replace Robinson, who has been recalled ; but for the present George Tash will be left in charge of that factory. The English house at Gombroon is not the absolute property of the Company. A sum of 200 tumans was lent upon the security of the building, with the proviso that the English should occupy it rent-free for eight years ; but, the owner dying not long after in debt to the King, his estate was seized and the house is now royal property. By giving a present, the Agent obtained a farman allowing the English to enjoy the benefit of the former contract ; yet unless another farman be procured, granting them a longer period, they are likely to be turned out or made to pay rent for it. Consider it necessary to retain a factory at Ispahan, for otherwise the Persian officials may refuse to pay the English share of the customs ; and besides the King will probably insist upon this, as also upon an annual present. Other news from Persia. Goods landed there by the Dutch. Narrate the purchase at Ahmadabad by Benjamin Robinson, without authority, of 670 bales of the previous year's indigo. This is of inferior quality ; and, moreover, ' at opening the bales the indico was discovered to bee full of holes, which small wormes, bred from the juice of a trees barke mixed with indico at its making to give it the better coullor, had eaten not only through that but through all the indicoe made the passed yeare, as wee in the 218 bales returned from Gomroone, and many other merchants of this towne in divers parcells which they owned, have experimented ; which though the indico looseth nothing of its owne substance, because the wormes feed only on the intermixture, yet some dust is therby caused and much losse in weight induced.' Altogether, the Company is likely to lose 2,426/. by Robinson's action ; and to meet this he has only about 1,380/. in England and whatever is due to him as ten years' salary.

Hope to send a large consignment of equal quality by the Discovery. Are glad to find that Biana indigo is in good demand in England. They could have supplied a large quantity, had the Company sent the necessary means to purchase it ; but as they have not been pleased to do this, the ship must be filled up with sugar and other low-priced com- modities. The non-arrival of the large supplies of money expected ' hath now so much declined your credit that, after the proceed of the rials was paid out [or] rather ceized on by your Suratt creditors (as will in consultations held in October more plainely appeare) nothing was left to send to Ahmudabad to cleare your goods thence ; where also, besides Benjamin Robinsons debt for his indico, Your Worships owed upwards of 10,000 li. sterling, and without monies it was impossible to bring them thence ; insomuch that wee even despaired of sending home your ship London this yeare.

Now send 89 bales of calicoes from those parts, ']^ being from ' Nussurpore-^ ' and the rest from ' Durd[ ] ^ a towne scituated higher up that great river of Indus.' Both are somewhat dearer than usual, but the general dearth of cotton wool last year throughout India has increased the price of yarn and consequently of calico in all places. Have ordered 20,000 pieces of Sind calico for next season, and hope to provide them at cheaper rates. Some {jroad ' Scinda joories ' are now forwarded ; also 59 bales of indigo from thence. ' Saltpeeter wee send none ; nor should not have medled with sugar, if not to prevent dead fraught.' Part of that carried by this ship was bought at Ahmadabad ; the rest is Bantam sugar, received by the Swan. Have put 146 bales of cotton yarn into the London. Could not procure any good dry ginger. A quantity of Nosari calicoes forwarded. At Broach and Baroda Dutch competition and the dearness of cotton wool forced up the prices to an unreasonable figure ; hence they bought but little. A considerable quantity of Agra calicoes sent. Of these the ' Dereabads ' came partly ' whited ' and partly ' browne ', and the latter have since been bleached at Surat and the neighbouring factories. All of them were bought ' at Lucknoo and other townes beyond Agra, where they are made and whence they are carried to Agra for sale.' Twelve bales of ' Keyrabads ' sent ; they are both broader and longer than Broach baftas. Of ' Mercooles ' they forward 52 bales ; also a quantity of ' Eckburies, a larger and longer sort of Agra cloathing then the Mercoolees.' A great many of these were bought, but most were 'transformed in Ahmudabad into byrams, selaes, cassedees, large chints, and other sorts of sundry denominations requested at Bantam and Mocha specially.' Have also provided a quantity of Agra calicoes similar to narrow baftas.

Some of these calicoes being found suitable for England, they have been bleached and are now forwarded. If approved at home, large quantities can be provided at cheaper rates than the Tatta or the Gujarat cloth. Bornford and his assistants at Agra have saved the Company much money by buying such goods at first hand and sending them to Ahmad- abad to be dyed, whereas formerly they were bought at the latter place at second or third hand. Want of money has, however, put a stop to their operations, and John Turner and Francis Hammersly have consequently been recalled to Agra from ' the out-townes.'

Could not get any gum-lac from Agra or Ahmadabad, but have now bought a parcel in Surat ; also some olibanum, aloes Socotrina, and myrrh. Virji Vora was for some time unable to fulfil his contract made with President Meth- wold to provide Deccan pepper, but he afterwards agreed to deliver the stipulated quantity at Calicut in October, 1641, if the English would fetch it from thence. The London was accordingly sent thither, with William Pitt and Thomas Hill on board ; also John Wylde and George Oxenden, who were to be left at Goa on the way.^ The ship sailed on October 25 and reached Calicut on November 11. On her arrival Virj I Vora's servants declared that the pepper was at ' Punnone' [Ponnani], to which place the Lofidon proceeded accordingly. There she was furnished with a small quantity of pepper, of bad quality, besides some cardamoms and turmeric ; and, after embarking at Goa some arrack and cinnamon, she returned to Swally on December 27. The pepper was taken on shore, as being unfit to send for England ; and 50 tons of Bantam pepper have been laden instead. They are very angry with Virji Vora for ' this peece of villany ', but they can do nothing » Cf. Bagh-Register, 1641-42, pp. 223, 235, 339. 8 THE ENGLISH FACTORIES to punish him until they are able to pay the money they owe him. Wylde and Oxenden were sent to Goa to congratulate the new Viceroy, settle certain accounts, and procure (if possible) some cinnamon. Their mission was * so gratefull and so well accepted ' that they obtained without difficulty a considerable quantity of cinnamon, which is now sent home. Moreover, * besides the clearing those severall depending accompts with that state and its officers (whose debts you now receave in cinamon), wee come to know that the V[ice] Roy will bee yet further intreated to furnish you with greater quantitieb of that comoditie ; and hath allready suspended subscription to a petition exhibited to him by Leonard Woodman ^, imploring license to setle a residence for his masters servants in Goa, untill hee had first consulted with your President and receaved his refusall of such favor.' It has accordingly been determined by consultation that the Swan on her way to Bantam shall land Pitt and Hill at Goa, ' not only to pay for part of the cinamon for which you are yet indebted to the Jesuits (who were the readiest and rendred themselves the ablest to serve you in these occasions), but to continue a residence there, so to prevent the Courtinians entrusion', purchase more cinnamon, and attend to other affairs affecting the Company. Cardamoms and turmeric sent home. Acknowledge that their borrowings have exceeded the limits fixed by the Company, but they could not otherwise have provided such large cargoes for England, Basra, and elsewhere. By the London alone they return 6,955/. more than was sent out in her and the Discovery. Refer to their accounts, &c., for particulars. They had expected a much larger remittance and on the strength of this had involved themselves in engagements which could not be cancelled ; but they hope to receive means before long which will set matters on a proper footing. Thank the Company for ' advizing so timely the unlawfull undertakings of the Deip and St. Malloes shipping, and in sendin"
