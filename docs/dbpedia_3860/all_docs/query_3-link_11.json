Castes, L Labana.— Although generally associated with the Alahtams, the Labcinas are totally distinct from that caste. Tnuy are almost wholly con6nod to the sub-inontano districts and Kdiigra, but are numerous in Lahore and also found in Lujraiiwala and I’eruzepur. Muzaffargarh and Lah^lwal- })ur also contain Labana colonies, i'iioy are the carriers and hawkers of the hills, and are merely the Panjabi rei^resentatives of that class of Banjaras who inhabit the sub-montane tracts oast of the Ganges. The Labiinas of Gujrao were thus described by Captain'Mackonize : “ Tho Labanas are also a peculiar people. Their status amongst Sikhs is much the same as that of the Alahtams. They correspond to tho Banjiras of Hindustan, carrying on an extensive trade by means of large herds of laden bullocks. Latterly they have taken to agriculture, but as an additional means of livelihood, not as a substitute for trade. As a section of the community they deserve every consideration and encouragement. They are generally tine substantially built people. They also possess much spirit. In anarchical limes when the freaks or feuds of potty governors would drive the Jats or Gujars to seek a temporary abiding place away from their ancestral village, the Labdn'as avould stand their ground, and perhaps improve the opportunity by extending their grasp over the best lands in tho village, in which their snorter-sighted and less provident lords of the llanor had, in some former period, permitted tliem to take up their abode for purposes of com- merce. Several cases of this nature came to light during settlement, and in most of them the strength and spirit of progress were as apparent in the Labanas as were tho opposite qualities conspicuous in their Gujar opponeuls. Their principal village is Tanda (which means a large caravan of laden bullocks) and is an instance of what I have above alluded to. Allowed to reside by the Gujar proprietors of Alota, they got possession of the soil, built a kasha, and in every point of importance swamped the original proprietors. They have been recognized as proprietors, but feudatory to their former landlords, the Gujars of Mota, paying to them annually in recognition thereof a sum equal to one- tenth of tho Government demand.” There is a curious colony ol' Labanas on the lower Indus who were settled there under Sikh rule by DiwAn Sdwan Mai, and who aro almost all Munna ISiklis or followers of Bdba NAnak, though many of them are Hindus in BahAwalpur. These men have almost entirely givou up tralHc and trade, and settled on the banks of tho river where they load a sort of semi-savage life, hunting aud making ropes and gi’ass mats for sale. They liurdly cultivate at all, and Hindus do not as.sociatc with thorn from fear of the Muliaintnadans who object tc^ iheir eating wild pig. The Labanas of J hang are said to have come from Jaipur and Jo^llipur and to be the same as the Mahtams of Montgomery. On tho whole the Labanas appear to be by origin closely allied with, if not actually belonging to, tho vagrant and possibly aboriginal tribes which will be discussed in tho Introduction (Vol. Ij ; aud it may be that at least some sections of the Labanas are of the same stock as they, (bee Labdna origins, further under Mahtam). About 30 per cent, of the Labanas_ are re- turned as Sikhs and almost all the rest as Hindus, there being only some 1,500 Musalmdus among them. The term Labdna appears to bo derived from lun (salt) and hdna (trade)i and the Lubdiia, Lobaiia, Labdna or Libdna was doubtless the ^I'reat salt-carrying and salt- trading caste, as the Ban jura was the aenoial carrier, in former times. Indeed the Labdna is occasionally called a Baiijdra. In Ambala he is also said to be called Bahrupia,* on account of his versatility in adopting different avocations. Headmen among the Labdnas are called IN aik, and under them work is carried on. A Ndik gets a rupee at a betrothal and at a wedding a similar fee, plus a leg of he-goat. Wliorever a Labdna settlement exists, a village named Tanda is almost certain to be found. In Kdiigra the Labdnas hold four hamlets, each called Tdncla. Tdnd iii Labdnki is said to mean a travelling body or gang. The origins claimed by the Labdnas vary. In Ludhidiia they claim descent from Chaulian Bajputs of Jaipur and Jodhpur. In Gujrat they Bay they are Kaghubansi Kdjputs and of the Sdndlas gotra. But in Kapurtliala they say they are really Gaur Brahmans of Pili- bhitin the United Provinces and tell how a Baja, being afflicted with a mortal disease, was advised by Ndru, a Brahman, to invite ten Brah- mans to a feast of flesh and wine and give them a gift {dachchhna) of a gold fiwhar each. The ten Brahmans bidden refused to take part in such a feast aud so Naru inveigled eleven Brahman boys to it and gave them each a mohar. Their parents learnt of their degradatien and drove them forth, but the Baja took them in. From them are de- scended the Labanas. Later on, adds the Hoshiarpur account, the sage Barada got the bo)s married to the daughters of rakshasas, demons who live on flesh and spirits, and himself became their priest. But a variant from Kdngra says that the Brahmans successfully re- sisted the efforts of the Bajil to induce them to accept his offerings, lie was, it is related, a Pilia Bajput aud, being afflicted with leprosy and the loss of many of his kinsmen, he vvas advised by the jotshis or astrologers to feast Brahmans as described above. In vain he sent for them and their girls and boys. The Brahmans holding it degra- dation to accept gifts from a leper, placed all their goods on pack ani- mals and took to the carrying trade. Many settled on the banks of the Ganges and were called Pandit- Jotshis. The others who took to carrying were called Labdnas from Iddd, ‘ loading.^ With them some Bajputs of the I ilia family, who were free of all taint of leprosy, were also exiled and the Pilia Labdnas claim descent from them and say they aj o of the Ivdshab gotra.

Nanda, Kliart. r ) Salim SMh. Mihr SMh, Amfn Shah, One Khart Manik appears in the Gujrdt tradition which makes the Labd,nas immigrants from Rai Bareilly. The status of the Labi'inas varies somewhat in different parts of the Punjab and it does not appear to be homogeneous. Three groups must be distinguished : — {. The Musla Lab^nas. a. The Lab^nas of Luflliiilna. in. The Labiinas of Bahdwalpur. i. The Musla Labiinas are so-called by group ii. Most accounts represent these Labdnas as having 11 sections or yoii* but the names of these are variously stated.* In Gujr^t the got names specified are as follows ; — i. Ajrawat (called Ghotfa in Kanprn). ii. Dfitla (? lanErher\\ also called M akhan*Shihi. jii. Pilia (painted with saffron), iv. ParwAl, Padwal, Badwalia. Porvval (said to bo so onlled from jpadwd, — the ^aneo ceremony). V. Khasarya. vi. Gojalia. vii. Gujar, viii. Tatra or Tadrn. . ix. Wamial or Mapiaun (not Mahtam), X. Wamowiil. xi. fvarowal. The first five of these sections appear in nearly every account of the caste. The remaining six are probably nls or sub-septs, locally exogani- ous, resembling those found in Central India, nr possilily they are merely family or nicknames. Of the eleven sections specified the first six are also found in Central India, apparently as endogamous groups split up into numerous exogamous divisions. So far no traces of this system have been found in the Punjab. In the sub-montano tracts of Siillkot and Gujrat the Ajrdwat look down upon the Klulsary as, and the story goes that once the latter said that even the bullocks of the Ajrdwat would get married, they had so many daughters. The Ajrawat also look on the Gujar section as inferior. ii. The second group is confined to the Bet tract of Ludlu’jina, where it holds seven small villages, and shares in three otliers. It dis- * Sections ill Kariprn i, iii nnd vii as above, and Dnina, Kalwana, GliAi'a, UIioIiIihI, Dahpra, Belin, Khera, .Moidiia, Bhnnia, Padorpayn.

A curious custom on the Roll is accounted for in a variant of the Prahidd legend. All are .^ikhs. iii. Tn Bali4vvalpur the caste is thus grouped i. Ramdiiia ii.

The Ram ana and Uddna are closely allied and hang together in all matters. They have a strong panchdyat system and rarely have recourse to the courts. Guilty persons are fined and the penalty [dand] spent on a ritual feast [kardh far shad) to the brotherhood. The legend about their origin is that a Rathor had a son born with long moustaches and so he was called labdna or “ cricket.” In Si^lkot and Gujrjit the tribe stands much higher, and appears to be intermarrying with other agricultural tribes. Tliis however does not necessarily imply a great rise in the social scale, for in Ferozepur the Baurias are intermarrying with J^ts. Widow remarriage is tolerat- ed, but, in Gujrat, the children of such marriages have a lower status. They are all Sikhs, claiming to have been converted by Guru Govind, and abstain from the flesh of animals slaugliterod in the Muhammadan manner as they consider it hardm, and at the mere mention of lialdVd meat exclaim tcdh guru, wdh guru, deprecating any allusion to such a. subject.* The social ceremonies of the Labdiias vary greatly, not only from district to district but within each district. These divergencies in custom are ascribed, by the Labanas themselves, to the composite origins of the caste. Birth observances. In Sidlkot the three ceremonies observed on tho birth of a child are : — 1. The oldest woman of the family does not eat or even tonch anything with her mouth at the time of a birth in the house, she makes * But in both .//i(7(A,a and hnlul'cl flesh may be lawfully eaten, it is said, though i„ 18 also added that Labanas who are sejoafcs of LakluUta never eat ihatka Offerings are made to that Pfr for the safety of cattle at the spring and amLn harves^^^^^^^ priest is the Bharai but he gets no chilrma until he has prayed to the Pfr to protect his •ejrafc, and it is also his duty to sacrifice animals in the Lldl form ^ jaws' that bito» severely.- Lahdna customs. 5 the mother wash her hands and face, and then, mixing sugar and flour in equal quantities, makes small circular-shaped loaves called papam which are distributed to those present and to members of the caste. • In Gujrat no peculiar ceremony is observed on the birtli of a child. The first thing to bo done is to boil ajwain in a brass vessel, and throw it away outside the house. This is considered to be good for the health of the child, and it is believed that it removes the effects of the evil eye. ^ 2. Two or three days after the birth, a widow of the family boils a quantity of sewidn (vermicelli) and cooks somqTice. Then in consulta- tion with other women of the family, especially the old hags who by that time have assembled, she designates one from among them to plaster the floor of the mother’s room with cowdung, and on this plas- tered spot sit seven or at most fourteen girls of the family or of the same tribe, while the widow draws lines of flour thereon, cutting the whole into several squares. Then she brings in the prepared food and all, assuming a prostrate position, offer prayers to the deity for the mother and all the members of the family. The women bow their heads before the girls and rub their feet, treating them as devis or goddesses. This is called worshipping the Devi. They afterwards eat the food. 3. The third ceremony is performed on the first Sunday of H^r (June) of the same year. The mother is carried to a pipal tree by the women of the family, there a chosen place is plastered and prayers are offered in the manner already described. The words of the prayer are : — “0 pipal tree, guard us against evil.” Cooked rice is carried there by a female barber who sings a strange and mysterious song, both going and coming. This ceremony is generally observed on tlie birth of a son. There are some other ceremonies connected with the birth of a child, for example one which goes by the name of sawi. This is only performed when the child is a boy. Once a year the oldest wo- man of the family gets np early in the morning and makes some kardh (sugar, ghi and flour mixed and cooked' together). Each article never weighs less tlian five quarters of a seer whence the name saai (1 J), all the males of the family are then invited to feast on the karuli. After- wards a he-goat is killed, some broad loaves of bread are cooked, jhnl is prepared and all these three things arc eaten by the members (both male and female) of the family.* The Labanas of Gujrat wear the janao or sacred thread, and are very particular about it. Even those who are Sikhs and do not cut their hair wear it. But in Kangra the use of it is dydng out, though oven those who p.re unable to afford the cost of the rite, will don it at their wedding. In Ludhiilna the janeo is assumed at marriage, but taken off alter the phera and hung on a pipnl tree. * ()a the birth of a boy, in Kangra, the ceremony is obaorvcfl within HI. (tnys of the birth, the kindred being feasted, while the women go to w'orship a pipal, the way there and back. A pot of water is eraptiod beneath the tree and ® .

At weddings the pair observe a similar rite. 6 Lahdncb murnagB- Marrioge customs. 1 fn vnrv in every dietrict.

In Guir^t early marriage is preferred, and widow remarriage (fere»a) has now commenced, though it is considered degrading * When on occasions of marriage, janeo, etc., a feast for the got people is eaten, the sons of a widow’s remarriage are not allowed to sit with the Urddari. Only men of the same got can sit with it, and karewa children are excluded. The Labiiuas in Ludhi^Lna celebrate a girl’s wedding by phera,^ like Hindus, but tbut of u widow by tiiJcdJi BiCCovAing to Mubatumud^fn rituB.!* The Arya Samaj has, however, set its face against such a confusion of rites. Monogamy is preferred and a Labd^na 'vill not take a second wife unless he is obliged. The wife first married enjoys certain privileges at religious ceremonies, but socially all the wives are on an equality. In Kdngra marriage is avoided in Chet, Bhddon, Asauj and Poll, and the date for the wedding should be fixed in the shiikla pahhsh or light half of a lunar month so that the 1 Ith {ikddshi) may fall on one of the days. Wedding ceremonies. In Sialkot the boy’s father or guardian goes to the house of the bride’s father or guardian and asks him to give his daughter in marriage to his son. After a good deal of discussion they come to some such agreement as that the boy’s father shall pay seven or eight score of rupees and give two or three ornaments to the girl’s father. There is no disgrace in making such a bargain, on the contrary the girl’s father insists on a good price and argues “ my daughter is very young and good looking, therefore ten score rupees are not much for her.” The utmost that a young girl is sold for is ten score rupees.t When the betrothal is complete the girl’s father gets half the price in advance. This payment is called hlidn. The whole price goes by the name of hoi. The money is paid in the bouse of the girl’s father together with 101 cocoa-nuts and some maiili thread. The wedding day is fixed, not as among Hindus according to the solar months but as among Muhammadans in the lunar month, a date of the moon being set apart for the purpose, and on that date the marriage party proceeds to the girl’s house. Twenty men usually make up a wedding party. On the first night the girl’s hands and feet ai’c stained with mehndi {mjrt\\Q). This is absolutely necessary and if it is not done the party has to turn back without being given a meal. This is the case too if there is any default in payment of the espouse her husband’s biother Hrobably there IS no absolute rule, but a feeling that a widow should marry his younger brother, or a cousin in a corresponding position an^at Rs U0^? at Rs. 120 if the hridogrooni is a ‘\"xcha— howe \" « S'i. “ K'‘”Sia, but sale, a -- ..w oulliu# l^AL/UU Exchanges are however said to take place. elder only child are not, Lahdna funerals^ 7 settled price. The boy’s fatlier performs all the ooreinoniea in the house of the girl’s father. Four days later the ceremony of punch paropi is performed. Tho girl’s father puts sugar aud ghi iu some dishes and selects a number of men of a peculiarly churlish nature to swallow their contents. Tho women, who are already occupying the roofs of the various rooms, begin to throw bricks, small pieces of stone, maiiie, etc., from all directions, but the men chosen continue eating iu largo mouthfuls even while they are being so assailed as they must not leave the food unhuished but must go on eating amid the shower of stones, etc. If they succeed in finishing the food they are p’raised by all present for their courage. Five days later, the couple go to a pipal tree accompanied by some of tho brotiierhood. The barber’s wife gives the hand of the girl into that of the boy and they walk around the tree hand iu hand thrice. Then sweetmeats are served to the assemblage. Next the girl runs ahead and tho sooner the boy catches her the more is ho praised for his strength. On the morning of the sixth day after the wedding the ceremony of gora is effected. The father of the boy has a he-goat killed with a sword and then cooked. All feast on the flesh and return home. A few days later the boy goes uninvited to his father-in-law’s house and stays there for a month or more. The couple bids farewell to modesty in a very short time. Tho mukldwa ceremony is performed five years after the wedding, and it is not unusual to see two or three children born during this period. The 8ati ceremony is also generally observed. Milk given by cows and buffaloes dedicated to the sati is held sacred. They do not allow men of other castes even to touch it. This milk is coagulated and made into whey in a separate vessel. No member of the family who is not deemed a true believer in the sati is allowed to drink the milk of animals dedicated to a sati. After a week or at most a fortnight, the milk and whey of such animals or khir (rice and milk cooked together) and loaves of bread cooked in ghi are carried to the sthdn (temple) of the sati and there a number of young girls of the same house- hold or of the caste are collected together and made to eat it. True believers in tlie sati are also invited to partake of it. Before eating a portion is given to the imagiuary sati. Afterwards all present jirostrate themselves, rub their foreheads on tho sacred spot, and offer up hearty prayers. If fortune thereafter smiles favourably on any family, they ascribe it to the' satins kindness. But if anyone suffeis from bodily infirmity, moral degradation, agricultural or pecuniary disaster he attributes it to her anger. The sthdii is a spot of ground, generally outside the village, over which a real building is sometimes raised, but in most cases tho bare earth serves the purpose. Death rites. A curious admixture of Hindu and Musalmdn rites is souietitnes observed at death. Thus in Ludhiana a dying person is laid on t e ground, as among Hindus, but after death the body is again put on a bed, a tiro kindled at its right hand and tho hand branded. i>ut after this tho body is bui’ied. 8 Labdna beliefs. Religiotis ideas. Properly Breaking, the Labiinas have no caste religion. Some worship a devi or a deity, others a sati, while a good many observe the Sikh teaching. Isolated as they were from the Hindus in the beo’innina, they exhibit a total ignorance of their religious principles, and tho*£h they have adopted several Hindu customs, they have as yet imlSied nothing of their religion. Generally they believe in the o-enii ol the wood, the nixies of the water, the sati and Holi and Mdtd Uevis. They fully believe in magic and charms such as the efficacy of mysterious characters written on a scrap of paper, In each village a raised platform serves as the sthdn or temple of the Devi. Here a disciple or hermit lives permanently and women constantly resort to this sacred. spot with whey in their hands which they present to him and ask about the future. The serpent is worshipped on the Gugga Naumi in Gujrd,t. Women* take a churl and four chapdtie and go to the hole of a serpent, where the Bhdt is present, The phuri and chapdtis are given to the JBh^G and cow’s milk is poured into the hole. This hole is called gugga or hdmhla and is a hxed place outside the village. The Diltlas must first worship the gugga before other castes can do it, and this is because it is believed that the serpeut is their offspring. The 'pipal is the sacred tree. On the third day after marriage the bride and bridegroom are taken to a pipal tree, whose stem is decorated with red colour and mauli thread. The married couple turn round the tree and, after bowing their heads, come away. The Soli festival. A leading man of the village is usually employed to perform this ceremony which is generally held in the month of Bais^kh. This man summons a drummei- who standing on some high place shouts the following words to all quarters of the village : — Iman mun dal hhanejo, wara ghadejo ware ko ae lo lijo, Holi ko hoko rae, hoko rae, hoko re. “ Wet the pulse and make small round balls of it. Come ! take away these balls and so call out the Holi, call out the Holi and call out the Holi.” This is known as the hoka (calling out) ceremony. When the drummer’s call has reached all the inhabitants each one according to his means buys the necessaries for the approaching festival, which lasts for three days. Then both men and women assemble together in some open place and shout the following words : — Hoko rae, hoko rae, hoko rae. Holi ko hoko rae. This lasts for lull two days. On the third morning' all don fine clothes, and the women adorn their faces with gold and silver oriia- inoiits which are in shape and make quite different to those generally used in the I unjab. I he leader then takes a drum and walks slowly ahead of all the villagers. With him they continue singing a mysteri- * But iu Kaugya meu ouly worship tho Nag ou tho Qugya Naumi, woiueu beiug ej^oh^- ed.

At last, they reach the sacred spot and heie they pile up old cotton plants, dry grass, etc., and set the heap on fire. The spectators standing round the scene make a great din while the wonn n with di^hes full of pulse balls in their hands await the leader’s orders to throw them into the blazing fire. Several he-goats are now killed, the heads going to the leader while the remainder of the flesh is taken by each head of a family to his own house. Afterwards a wrestling match is held, at which famous wrestlers from different parts display their strength. This ceremony is known as the dudu. Finally they assume a pro:>‘trato attitude before the spot sacred to the Devi Holland then return home taking with them a small quantity of nshes which they keep as a pledge of the protection for the whole year. This is the. festival in Gujrdt. In Ludhiana also the Holi is observed but with somewhat different rites. A particular spot is set apart for its celebration and there a pice and a betel nut are buried. Over them a heap of cow-dung cakes is piled and set alight, being watched with as much solicitude ‘as a woman in her corrfinement.’ Next evening when the fire has burnt out the people of the village and its neighbourhood collect and search in the ashes for the pice and nut, and whoever finds them will be ex- tremely fortunate. It is believed that whoever finds one will also find the other as they cannot be found separately. This rite is explained by the following legend : — Bhagat Prahidd’s father hated him for his devotion to God, and after several devices to kill him had failed he bade him sit in a burning fire on his sister’s lap. She believed herself to be fire-proof, but when put to the test she was burnt to death while Prahlad escaped. After this observance, disputes are laid before the kmdred for settlement. Fines are imposed on offenders or ihey are out-casted, and those who have complied with the orders of the kindred are re-admitted into caste. Next day they re-assemble and hold a feast at which men and women dance together and throw the usual coloured water on one another. Dancing and singing they go from house to house, and if any house is not visited its owner takes offence. Labar, a J^t clan (agricultural) found in Multon.

Labula, Lahuli, incorrectly Ldhauli, an inhabitant of Lahul, wliicli lies partly in British territory and partly in Chamba. British Ltiliul com- prises three valleys, Bangloi or the valley of the Chandra, G^ra or Punan, the valley of the Bhdga, and Pattan, or the valley of the united river, the Chendib, below the confluence of the Chandra with the Bhdga. The people of British Lilhul are divided into an upper class of Thd- kurs, who correspond to the puts of the Himalayan area: Brah- mans, who are only found in Pattan and are descended from immigrants from ( hamba-L^lhul and other tracts to the south : Kanets, who fdi’m the middle and most numerous class : and the lower classes, consisti> g of Shipis or Dd.gi8 and Lohd;rs with a few Sundrs, Bardras and Hensis. The Dilgis, Lohd,rs, Bararas, Hensis, etc., seem to have no gots and all intermarry, though they refuse to marry witli the lowest caste of all, the iShipis. There are also a few Lamas, chiefly in GarsS, where a certain number of nuns [chorno) are also found. The Kanets of Ldhul offer a few points of interest. Many of them in Pattan are no doubt descendants of settlers from Kullu or Bsngahal, lait the rest, and all the Kanets of Gara atid Rangloi are pure Tibetans or neaily so The Lahula, however, now looks upnu the term Botia (Tibetan) as a term of reproach. The Kanets in Ldhul are divided into the tollowiiig gots : — i. Lonchen-p4 or the ivasirs. it. (Ky;Chungo pa or vujtures. Hi. Darpa (seeriis to have no meaning). iv. Hensar-pa (tlensar is a Kullu caste). V. Dantur-pa (Grantur-pa). vi. Hirida-pa, or archers : a story is told to account for the name. vii. Kapur, said to have come from the plains. via, Kyechhag-pa. The Thakurs, who are the gentry and quondam rulers of Ldhul, are m\"rrt or less pure Tibetans by blood, but are beginning to assert a Uajput 01 igin.

(Phag-yal=Arya-Varth), Ldhula tenures. 11 Similarly Brahmane take Kanet women to wife, and their sons succeed ; and though the Brahman father will not eat from such a son’s hands he may smoke with him. Such sons are called gurus, but call themselves Brahmans, but they in turn marry Kanet wives or women of mixed caste if they can find auy. Thd-kurs, Brahmans, and Kanets will all smoke together in L^hul, and Brahmans will drink water, tea or lugri (rice-beer) from a Kanet’s hand, but will not eat even sachi roti, which appears to be equivalent to pakki ro^i. Tbakurs will eat pakki or sachi roti from a Kanet’s hands, but not A:achi, but those Thdkurs who v;ear no jaueo will do so. The Kanets do not wear the yaweo. The main class distinction, as in other Tibetan countries, appears to be that between the agriculturists, woo form the great mass of the population, and the wage-earning classes; but this line of demarcation, thouo-h it prevents intermarriage, does not separate the classes in the ri(dd°way that the institution of caste would do. The artisan classes nevertheless have their distinctions — see under Lohar. But the most interesting thing about the Ldhula population is its economic system. This merits full description ns it is a good example of a small, self-contained, ancient polity. The allotments of fields,* supposed to have been made authoritatively at a remote period, and to have been originally all equal, subject to the same rent or tax and each Table to furnish one man f..r service or forced labour to the lord, appear to have been indivisible and in Gdrd and Rangloi, the Tibetan valleys, are in tact still almost all uudivioed. Land reclaimed from the waste was formed into separate allotments, or added to an existing allotment with a corresponding increase m its burdens. The crreab bulk of the allotments are held by the yulfa or villagers, each of them being on an average about five acres in area. Some small iniscellaneous holdings are held rent-free in lieu of service to the com- munity. Such are ^ blacksmiths, , , , , , 1 \\ musicians (Hensis), -held by the-^ . - . Hi. iv.

Probablv the hohdvs, jodhsis and beds could have been evicted in times past by the community or the T^^kur, but the general idea now seerL to be that they could not be dispossessed, however mefficient The Hensis’ tenure is however more precarious, as they appear to hold solely at the T^^kur’s pleasure. The Thdkurs hold certain kothis or groups of hamlets in 6ef or jagir and are' owners of the waste within the limits of their Mas. Jh arable land is either held rent-free by his dotoenf or cadet branches : ; 1 iiQAfl to describe such an allotment.

Uivated by acl/sscalledwWcfiumjia or farm servants (literally cottagers) A dotoen family sinks after a time, when the sense of relattonahip to the Thakiir has become faint, to the status of dwTests and is then liable for service. A dotoen’s holding is about one or two allotments (5 to 10 acres) on an average, a cMlcst’s from to 5 acres, and a cottager’s about U acres. The nature and extent of the seivices rendered varies, but the general principle is that the burden on each allotment is 6xed. Mortgages are not uncommon and even a chakst or a cottager may mortgage his holding, provided that the mortgagee paid a full rent if he or the mortgagor failed to render the customary service. Amono- the subordinate landholders all sons are considered entitled to equaf shares of their father’s holding, but in practice they seldom divide, and live on with wife, land, house and chattels in common. When asked to defend this repulsive custom of polyandry, they say that their holdings are too small to divide, and that experience shows them that it is impossible for two sisters-in-law, with separate ImsOMnds and families, to live tof^ether, whereas two or more brothers with a common wife can Mgree. In such families the custom which has hitherto prevailed, with re yard to inheritance of the shares of brothers who die without issue, is quite clear: such share has always gone to the brothers with whom the deceased lived in unison, or to his issue, to the exclusion of all claim on the part of the separated branch of the family. The most exceptional point in the custom of inheritance prevailing in Ldhul is the fact that, in default of sons, a daughter succeeds to her father’s whole estate in preference to nephews or other male kin.smen, provided that, before her father’s death she has not married and settled down to live on her husband’s holding away from home. If ^he is married and living with her husbaml in her father’s house, she succeods, and if she is unmarried, she can hold for lile as a maid, or can at any time marry and take her husband to live with her. Supposing such a husband and wife to die without issue, it appears to be doubtful who would have the best claim to succeed them, wliethor the next of kin to the w'ife or to the husband. But it is agreed that the survivor of the two might lawfully give the estate to any member of either of the two families.

' ® Ldhula customs. 13 Customs connected with birth, marriage and death. The best general account of the social customs of the Botids will be found in Cunningham’s Ladakh, but even in Spiti and L^hul, especially in the latter, the practices of the present day will bo found to differ in some details. At almost every observance the religious ceremony consists in the simple reading of prayers or passages from the holy books by a lama, while the whole company of men and women sit round with clasped hands and downcast eyes, and repeat the verses after him. The social celebration of all these events consist mainly of feasts in whicxi much chang is drunk. The decisive point in the negotiation for a betrothal is the acceptance or refusal of a pot of c/ian(7 sent to the bride’s father; if he drinks, the affair is settled without more words. Polyandry, or the taking to wife one woman by several bi others, is a recognised institution , and is very general, the object is to prevent the division of estates. Sir James Lyall describes a case which came before him in which one of two brothers living in polyandry much wished to separately marry a girl by whom he had had an illegitimate child, but the wife of his family objected strongly, claiming both brothers as husbands, and refusing to admit another woman into the household, and she eventually prevailed. Among the Kanets the age of betrothal is any time between 10 and 20 years of age for both parties. It depends apparently on their means. The wedding is solemnised one or two months after the betrothal. Among the Kanets the man sends a relative to the girl’s house and he conducts the negotiations. At his second visit he takes a rupee and some such as a present. The day for the betrothal is fixed by the jotshi or astrologer. Then on the day fixed the man’s family go in a body to fetch the girl. The ceremony is attended by Brahmans or lamas and sometimes by both and the Shdstras arc read. The bride receives as dower (i; the zori [islridhan) which i.s given her by her parents, (ii) the gotan, which is given her by her husband and is recoverable by him, and [Hi] the TiiAkur.s and sometimes even Kanets give some land to be held independently for life by the bride ; this corresponds to the Kullu chhethi. Further, as in Kullu, the woman often takes an agreement’stipulating for the chhethi etc., and provid- ino* for her separate maintenance in the event of her husband marrying a S)Cond wife, which is usually done when the first is barren. Divorce seems free. In Ldhul cattle are not slaughtered nowadays (except perhaps in some villages at the head of the Bhdga Valley, and there it is done with the greate.st secrecy), but five or six sheep are kdled kj each house at the beginning of the winter ; tho flesh dries, and will then keen good for anv number of years ; the older the mcar, tho greater the delicacy to the taste of a Uhuli. Tho princif)nl food <.f the Ldhuli is buck-wheat, boiled whoD and eaten as gruel, or roasted and made into flour, which i'^ then baked into cakes or mixed witli chang beer, and formed into dumplings. The Buddhists, half-Buddhists, Lohars, and Shipis always eat any sheep or goats which have died from fatigue or disease, and some ot thein eat also calves, oxen or yaks which have been killed by a fall 14 Ldhula houses, etc. from rocks or otherwise, but this is done secretly. When at Keylang a calf happens to die in the morning, it remains where it fell the whole day, nobody touching it, but the dead body certainly disappears during the night, and many bones, especially during winter, of such animals may be seen lying about near tlie villages, but dead asses and ponies are only left to the eagles and foxes. Slaughtering yaks during winter is still practised at some villages above Keylang, but it is done veiy secretly, and nobody will acknowledge the fact. There is a small temple with the image of a Ihn near Yanample. Every thiid year a yak is sacrificed there, the victim being supplied in turn by all the hothis of Lahul. This custom dates from the time of the Kullu Rajas who (as the god is said to be the same as that of the Dungri temple near Manali in Kullu) ordered that one buffalo was to be offered (as at Dungri) every third year. Since Lfi^hul has become British territory, yaks have taken the place of buffaloes. The Sliipis eat the flesh of the sacrificed yak. Wheaten flour is generally eaten in Lahul. Butter and butter milk are regular articles of diet in both countries. Chang, a kind of beer brewed from rice and barley, is drunk generally, and tea and a kind of whisky by those who can afford it. In Lahul the houses are smaller than they are in Spiti, and less care and taste are expended in building and adorning them. Ordinarily the upper storey consists of an interior or winter room, an outer or summer room, and a verandah room open on the fourth side. In this verandah stands the loom, inside will be found large corn chests made of slate set in wooden frames, large stone bowls from Iskardu, iron cauldrons, and cooking pots, an iron tripod or pot stand, some wooden dishes, and a few earthen pots from Kullu. Many pack-saddles for sheep and goats are strewed about, and a few blankets and thick sheep-skin coats hang on the walls. Small holes in the wall serve the purpose both of windows and chimneys: bedsteads are unknown. Grass is stacked on the roof, and wood for fuel inside. This is a fair description of a house in the upper valleys of Lahul ; in the lower villages the rooms are larger and better ventilated. In Garfi, many of the houses are built together in one block with connecting passages by which com- munication is kept up iu the winter without going out, which, when the snow is very deep, may be scarcely possible. Making thread is the chief occupation in winter ; on fine days the loom is brought out, and some weaving is done. Both men and women work the loom in Ldhul. In Ldhul the dress of the men is much the same as that worn in Kullu, the Only difference being that the coat is longer and of thicker and darker cloth, and that trousers are always worn, the women, on the other hana, dress like those of Spiti (see under Tibetan), except that straw sandals replace the long boots. It is not easy at first to distinguish a Ld,hu!i nun, if young, from a lad, as they shave their heads and dress like men. Ancient belief in Lahul. Without doubt there existed a very low kind of religion in Mml before Budlnsm got bold ot the people, and the latter has not been 15 Ldhula belief n. able to suppress it entirely. The early religion of Ldhul is still known under the name of ‘ Lung-pachhoi/ that is, ‘the religion of the valley.’ Wheti it was flourisliing many bloody, and even human, sacrifices seem to have been regularly offered up to certain Ihd, gods or evil spirits residing in or near old pencil-cedar trees, caves, etc. This cruel custom disappeared gradually after the doctrine of the Buddhists had influ- enced for a time the minds of the people. There is a story which I shall relate, as it seems to show that this was the case. Near the vil- lage of Kyelang a large dry pencil-cedar was standing till last year, when we felled it for fire-wood : the story goes that before this tree, in ancient times, a child of 8 years old was anoually sacrificed to make the spirit who resided in it well-disposed towards Wie inhabitants of Kyelang. The children seem to have been supplied in turn by the different families of the village. It happened one year to be a widow who had to give up an old child of the required age of eight years. The day before her only one was to be taken from her she was crying loudly, when a travelling lama from Tibet met her, and asked the cause of her distress. Having heard her story \\}\\q Idma said: ‘Well, I will go instead of your child.’ He did so but did not allow himself to be killed: ‘ the spirit must kill me himself if he wants human flesh,’ said he, so saying he sat himself down before the tree and waited for a long time ; but as the demon made no attack on him, he became angry, took down from the tree the signs and eflSgies, and threw them into the Bhaga river, telling the people npt to saciilice any more human beings, which advice was followed from that time forward. The demon fled and settled on the top of the Koko pass, where it still dwells under the name of the Kyelang Ihd or god of Kyelang, getting uow only the annual sacrifice of a sheep supplied by the shepherds. In the time when the Lung- pachhoi was the only religion that existed in the valley, there were doubtless more places in Ldhnl where human beings were immolated to supposed crods and evil spirits. At present, near not a few villages sheep and goats are yearly killed and offered up (contrary to the pre- cepts of Buddhism) to evil-disposed Ihds, and it may be that animals have now taken the place of men. The people however still continue to believe in a great many spirits or demons known as Ihds, who are supposed to dwell in trees, rocks, or on the hill tops, and before whom the Buddhists (contrary to their religion) sacrifice sheep and goats. In addition, they believe greatly in witches, sorcerers, and the evil eye, and have a host of other superstitious in common with all the other Lahulis. The religion of the people is nominally Buddhism, but it is becoming nominally Hinduism. Thus the god of the Pass is la-tse, zhing-lhd is the field god and lu and tsan are the river and mountain gods. The lu is said to be a ndg or snake deity and is worshipped with milk and water. His shrine is usually a spring and it is kept clean. Women do not worship him. The pile of horns (ibex) often seen on top of a house in Liihul is the Ihd-lho or gods’ boundary. A demon commonly believed in is Kangreta (lit. one-ear) who is in man’s shape with one arm, one leg, etc. He is said not to bo worshipped now at all. Expiatory ceremonies of various kinds are common, the or priest (corr. to the gur of KuUu) being employed, just as in Kullu the J6 Ldhula beliefs. gur {guru) or chela lias niucli more to do with popular religion than the Brahman, with whom the Buddhist lama closely corresponds. Thus the jhivgsha ceremony (callo'l in Ivulln hawan) of hiiilding a miniature l.ouso of sticks, filling it with flour, etc., and burning it, is performed to avert evil from a new house, and sometimes on other occasions. The Shi pis seem to receive the ministrations of Bhot priests only, while the other castes have various divinities, e. g., Mahadeo in Patan : Hirmadeyi at Sissu (said to be the Kullu Jamlu) : Gantal Devi called Cliahja-moh equivalent to Kali Devi, and also T’svl’ dag-mo= Jdn-mdlika or the lady of life ; Devi Taraso at Kyelang : Buddha Gaya: Shakya Tub-ba: Padma Sambha, said to have come from Ujjain : and Guru Binboche. Religious ceremonies connected with agriculture. The L^l'ulis observe certain ceremouies of a religious nature in con- nection with the cultivation of their fields. A lama, who understands the astrological books, names the auspicious day on which ploughing should be commenced [this day falls always between the 8th and 22nd of May). After the fields have been ploughed and sown, a procession goes round all the fields, preceded by one or two Idmds and two drums, some of the company carrying at the same time several large religious books on their backs, this done, the whole company sits down in the fields near the villages and feasts on cakes and chang supplied jointly by all the land-holder.s. All this is done to secure the sprouting up of the seeds sown, after that the water-course for irrigating the fields is repaired, on which occasion a sheep is offered up to the Ihd which is supposed to have special care of the water-course. Again, as soon as the seeds have sprouted, another ceremony is performed ; this consists in sticking small branches of the pencil-cedar here and there in the field, and burning incense, ivliile some members of the family sit down, eat, and drink a little, and murmur some prayers. This is to ensure that each grain which has sprung up may prosper and produce many ears. When the fields are nearly ripe, a goat or sheep is killed in honor of^the Ihd, in several villages horse-races are held at the same time. ^ Till the festival of the ripening grain has been celebrated, no- body is allowed to cut grass or any green thing with a sickle made of iron, as in such case the field-god would become angry and send frost to destroy or injure the harvest. If, therefore, a Lfihuli wants grass before the harvest sacrifice, he must cut it with the sickle made of the horn of an ox or sheep, or tear it off with the hand. Infractions of this rule were formerly severely punished, at present a fine of one or two rupees suffices, which goes into the pocket of the jdgu'ddr or the village headman. I ho iron sickle is used as soon as the harvest has been declared to be commenced by the performance of the sacrifice. The Ldhulis of Chamha.

I intormarries witli Rdu^l families in^the Ravi and B<‘as valleys : the Rjiti,! of Margraon intermaiTius with Thdkurs and RAthis in Llhul. Both of those families are probably of Tibetan origin. Among the high castes marriage is prohibited within three det^roes of relationship on either side. The marriage customs of the Laliulis are similar to those of Pdngi. The boy’s father goes to the o-irl’s house accompanied by a friend and if an alliance is arranged he returns and pays a rupee to the girl’s father; this is called tungrandi or suthri. There are two forms of marriage ; the superior form being called bijdh. Sunday and Monday are regarded as good days for a marria''-e. On the appointed day the bridegroom goes with his A’iends to the bride’s house, where all are seated, the bridal pair being placed side by side with the bride on the loft. A totii of aattu is prepared and the bri<le’s maternal undo presents a portion to them with arms crossed, as in Pangi, and then to the rest of the assembled company. This observe auce is called marpi. A feast follows with drinking, dancing and singing. In the morning the bride’s parents and friends present the awij or marriage gifts, and the bridegroom gives the bandha or ornaments to tlio bride, one rupee each to his father and motlier-in-law. The bridal party then returns to the bridegroom’s house, and at the door the bridegroom’s mother meets them with -dtotu of sattu, a lutd of water, incense and a sheep. The wania ceremony is performed as in Pangi and the sheep killed and given to ilalis. They then enter the house when the totu of sattu is distributed to all, beginning with the bridal pair, by the boy’s maternal uncle. A feast follows wir.h singing and dancbig. The girl’s parents do not accompany the procession, only her brother and other relatives — and no money payment is made to* them on their departure. The phirauni ceremony \\s observed as in Pdngi. A modified form of polyandry exists in Chamba-Ldhul. At the time of the phirauni the younger brother of the bridegroom accompanies the party and presents Re. 1 to the girl’s mother which establishes his right as a second husband. More than two are not allowed. The custom of carrying away the bride privately is also common in Lfihul. Widow remarriage, called topi Idni, is practically the same as in Pdiigi. A widow cannot now be compelled to marry her deceased hus- band’s brother, and may appeal to the court for protection, both in Pangi and Lfihul, if compulsion is attempted. Divorce is recognized and usuaMy two or three respectable persons are present on the occasion. The husband and wife hold a piece of thread between them and break it by pulling in opix>site ilirections. If both are consenting parties no money paymetit is made, otherwise the payment is made by the party wishing the divorce, and is called man. DeatlTobservances are much the same as in Pdngi ; children under one year and lepers being buried and all others burnt and the ashes thrown iiito the Chandra Bluiga. For eight days after the death only one meal a day is eaten, called upas, and on the ninth day a feast is given to the near relatl^'es, which practically ends the period of mourning. Those who cun afford it raise monolith slabs {dhaj)* and otlier memorkils to the (lead. The period of impurity is 8 days for all purpose.^ * For sonio ruitos ou lUcao commemo ration stones, see App. II of Fraucke’s Hutory of Tibet, Festivals in Chciwhct hahult The only tenure in Laliul ia called ghdi or ghdri, i.e., an equal divi- sion of the crop between landlord and tenant. The chief festivals in Chaniba-Ldhul are the following 1. The Brishu on 1st Baisc^kh, which is observed as in Pdngi. 2. The Pori mela is observed only in Trilok Nath, and is accom- panied by dancing and drinking. Held in Bh^don. 3. The Khaul 7)iela observed as in Pdngi. 4. The Kun mela is the same as the Sib mela in Paiigi. It is also called Chiir and is held on the new moon of Phagan. The evening ia spent in eating and drinking, and on the follow- ing day. 5. The Or r/ie/u is held on the full moon of Phagan, in 'i’rilok .Nath and Margraon, and like the other melas the chief ac- companiment is drinking and dancing. Lahul is the metting place of the Aryan and Mongolian races and the people exhibit the characteristics of both, though the Aryan element predominates. Their religion is an impure Buddhism grafted on the ancient and probably aboriginal Nag and Devi worship which is similar to that of Pangi and is found as far up as the junction of the Chandra and Bhagi rivers — Chorteus, prayer flags, mdni walls and other symbols ot Buddhism are common. The Buddhist temple is at Trilok Nh,th and the chief Devi shrine is that of Mirkula Devi at U daipur. Mr. A. H. FranCke thinks that the original worship of Trilok Nath and Mirkula was an aboriginal form of Shiva and Kdli worship. \"When Buddhism entered the country Shiva was ideutifled with Ava- lokita, and the Khli of Mirkula with Vajravardhi who is still worshipped there by the 'Tibetans. The results of Sir Thomas Holland’s measurements of the L4hul Kanets* went to show the population of the Lahul villages now contains very little unaltered Tibetan blood, whilst there are apparently some individuals who uniformly tend towards the Indian type. The evidence of the cephalic, naso-inalar and nasal indices, stature and facial angle, uniformly points to the presence of a large proportion of Tibetan blood in the Ldhul Kanets, but no precise idea of the quantitative relations of the Indian to the 'Tibetan strain can be formed on our present data. The Kanets of Ldhul include a certain number of immigrant families from the Kullu side and they have not been long enough in the country to have their blood tainted by intermarriage with those who have 'Tibetan blood. regretted Valuable as these measurements were it is perhaps to be that those made in the different valleys, Pattan, Card and Rangloi weic not distinguished, as tlie elements in each valley are believed t< vary.

Lak, a Muhammadan Jdt clan (agricultural) found in Shdhpur, Mont- gomery and Multdn. In the latter District they claim Punwdr origin and kinship with the Langdhs. Originally ousted from the Chenab by the Sikhs, a small number of Laks are now settled in the Chenab Colony. Formerly notorious cattle-thieves, they are now of very minor importance. Lakeka, an agricultural clan found in Shdhpur. Lakha, a sept of Muhammadan Jdts which owns a few villages in Rajanpur tahsil, Dera Ghazi Khdn, and is also said to be found in Muzaffargarh. It claims kinship with the Maliras, Kurejas and Sdha-sumi’a (?) Jdts, and assigns its origin to Ldkha Lirhdni in the Brahui country beyond Jacobdbdd whence they migrated under Samdil AH and Karabir. The latter was Nawdb of Dera Ghdzi Khdn under the Kalhoras and his son Nawdb of Ddjil until expelled by Nasir Khdn Brahui. Lakhanpal, a sept of Rdjputs.

At feud with the Kharrals of the Upper Rdvi it allied itself to the Kdthids and other lower Rdvi tribes. To this clan belonged Saddatyar Khdn, son of Mahdbat Khdn, a chief who held some post at the Delhi court under Alamgfr. Ilia jagir is said to have been worth Rs. 1,09,000 a year, but a proposal to betroth the daughter of Ghdzi Khdn, the eighth Sial chief, to him was regarded as an insult, and he \\vas unable to protect his country against the Sidls of Jhnng and eventually tho chiefs of Kamdlia were reduced to under the Nikkdi Sikhs; (2) one w'ho gathers gum-lac.

Some generations after Bhatti came Rajd Rasdlii who had two sons Dasal and Jaisal.t Tlie latter became Rdjfi of Jaisahner, but-Taisal remained in Bhatti (-dna; and had a son named Janrd, who had several wives of various castes.

Lalai, a branch of the Wazir Pathans, now settled on the nort]>ern slopes of the Sufed Koh in Nangrah^r. L^ilai is said to have been the son of Sulaim^n, son of Kakai, and to have fled from the Birmil hills on account of a blood-feiud. Lalaean^, fern, -f, of Lildri, q. v. Lalare, a section of Rajputs. Lalbegi, a worshipper of Liilbeg who appears to be also called Bd,ld, Shdh, the mythical high priest of the Chuhrds and other castes of similar status. Further it is at least highly probable, as Sir Denzil Ibbetson pointed out,* that Bd^ldi Shah is B^lmik, the traditional author of the Ramdyana, and if so, Ldlbeg or Bdld, Shdh is merely a Muham- madanised name and title for that Hindu saint. According to Sir Richard Temple the legend goes that Shiva once rubbed his hand on a red stone, Idl hatta, and L^^lbeg came out. Possibly he suggests, Ldl- beg is a corruption of Ld,l Bhikshu, the red monk ” {i.e., Shiva him- self). Templet also records a legend which certainly points to the earth- god Shiva as the prototype of L^lbeg. Once the Prophet with Mihtar Ili^s and other saints was sitting in God’s court. Ilifls spat and ' his spittle fell on the prophets, so the Almighty bade Bids serve as a. sweeper, but he begged that an intercessor for him might be born. Ili^s was then himself born into the world as a sweeper, but lived in the hope of forgiveness and one day the Great Saint or Pfr gave him his coat to wear. Ili^s placed it in a pitcher of earth and when asked by the Great Saint why he did not wear it replied that he feared to soil it. But the Saint bade him don it and come to him. ilids was however, unable to open the pitcher and brought it to the Saint * who said : “ Come out, Lalbeg, quickly.” (L^l means “ my son ”). From the pitcher emerged a fair man wearing Idl heg “ red clothes ” i,e., hhekh. Him the Saint designated as the prophet of the sweepers and Ili^s took him home, filled his hnga for him and worshipped him. To this day the sweepers fill the pipe for a religious teacher. Ldlbeo- at once became invisible, because he disapproved of Thais’ beliefs and the Saint bade him do penance promising that Lalbeg should intercede for him, and saying that in the first age the gliatincLt or vessel worship- ped to represent Ldlbeg would be golden, in the next of silver in the third of copper and in the fourth of earth, and so the Mihtars or sweepers now worship vessels of earth.J But another legend makes Llilbeg the son of a Mughal woman who was barren until at Balmik’s prayer s'-e bore a son.§ And yet a third makes him the sou of Shaikh Sarna of Multan. His mother dedicated him to Bdlmik and he even- Pnnjnb Ocnsuif Report, 1882, § 295, note 3. produced Lalbeg: some on a reed \\Vlience%,n-an\"^sS^‘^ cowdung {gohar), whence Gobar NAtb, and some was cast inm fish who brought forth Machhendar Nath, GorahU NAth’s nrecootnV^' *^^ swallowed by a j P 586. ^i'reccpioi. § lb. I., 837. Ldlhegi mythology, o| tually conqiiered KAbul and Kashmir, bat he placed one Sultani on his throne and retired to Thdnesar where Balmik’s tomb is still worshipped. Then at Delhi, whither Ldlbe^ wont with all his followers, he fou*idod the religion named after himself and divided his disciples info five sects tlie liJllbegi, vSliaikhri, Dumri, Ilili and Hawat. The L.llbegi Mihtarsof Tlu'mesar and Karnal alfect Bibi Dhi^ni, as w'ell as Ljilbeg himself offering her churls (bracelets), henna and a dori kd 'pardndd, or hair ribbon, but all that we know of Dhidni is that she was a relative of Lalbeg.* Pundri, mentioned as a daughter of Bdlmik, does not appear to be worshipped, nor does Satti Chuhri, his wife. Ldl Guru is another name of Ldlbeg and he is also cnlled Bhangi, which was a title of the rdkshasa Aronaknrit, Aruna Karata, “ the red crow,” an ancient tribal deity, Thus popular mythology pel sists not only in distinguishing Bdlrnik from Lalbeg, but also in attributing to each of them a family and disciples. But one form of the myth denies to Ldlbeg any human or natural origin and makes him but an emanation of Bfilmik. The latter used to sweep Bhagwdn^s court-room, and the Almighty gave him a dross which Bdlmik buried in a pit. When asked by the Almighty why he did not wear it he went to tho pit and found a boy in the robe. According to one story Billmik protested that he had no milk for the babe, and was directed to go home and give it to the first animal which crossed his path. On his road to Earth Bdlmik saw a hare suckling her young and to her he gave the child. So to this day no sweeper wdl eat a hare.f But this version does not appear to be current in the Punjab, where it is said, at least in N^bha, that some Chuhr^s do not eat hare’s flesh because a Chuhrsl once killed a cow’s calf by accident and liid ic under a basket. When the owner tracked his calf to the Chuhril’s house the latter said that a hare was hidden beneath the basket and when it was overturned a hare was found insfead of the dead calf. But in Gurgaon the Sus Gohar got of the Chuhr^s is the only one which observes his tabu and that only because the hare once bore the name of that got. Tn Mont- gomery the Muhammadan Chuhrils do not eat the hare’s flesh if they are followers of the Makhdiiin Jalidman of Uch as that Pir forbade its use. Other Chuhrds can eat it. # As already noted Bdlmik is probably to be identified with the author of the Hatndy ana, bur one story is that there is another Bdlmik “of low deo-ree ”, and concerning him various legends aVe current. The most popular version represents Bdlmik as a great robber, who was a Blul. Once ho attacked tho seven rishis, but in compliance with their remonstrances he asked his parents to join him. Their refusal cut him to the quick and he turned /a^fr. A less common version runs When Yudisthira had performed an aswamedh jag and all present had feasted, the bell did not sound of its own accord, as it should have done, to announce the completion of the rites. So it was thought, that they had been irregularly done or that some hhagat had not attended the ♦>P. N.Q.. I., ’663. t_Ib. I., 831. 22 Thr L flbegis and Bdlvnih. feast. Accordingly Balmik was invited and when served by Draupadi with 36 various dishes he mixed them altogether, which m Draupadi a eyes stamped him asiudeed one of low caste. Nevertheless the bell now rang and the rites were thus duly conipleted, the only defect being Draupadi’s contempt for Balmik, which she was exhorted to forget,* According to Mr. H. L. Williams Mbeg is represented by a red pennon on a red pole, while Bdlmik^s insignia is a broom of peaoock’a feathers at the end of a bamboo. Both are carried in procession attend- ed by dholaks or drums. Pir Chhata is also said to be an ancestor of the Chuhr^s who gained sanctity by removing a cow’s carcase when no one else would do so, but he is doubtless identical with Balmik of whom a similar legend is told. Once a man bade his youngest son remove a dead cow, but he refused. Each son in turn refused also, until he came to the eldest of his four sons, Bdlmik, who obeyed his father in spite of his knowledge that it was the duty of the low-caste Hatid,ras to remove dead cattle. His father’s promise to re-admit him into the family was not fulfilled and his descendants too became known as Hatiaras. , With the cult of Bdlmik is associated, round about Amritsar, that of Midn Siura, himself a Chuhr^, who became a devotee. Once Qazi Ddnd tested his powers by making him sit on a sheet spread over the mouth of a well and say his prayers. 1'he Qdzi expected to see him fall into the well, but he did not, and whenever he cooked the flesh of a cat or a dog for his food and began to eat it the animal came to life and fell at his feet. The Chuhnis perform a jag in his honour and that of Balmik and give alms in the names of both those saints. In Sirmur Btilmik has a makdn, j)akka or kachha, in front of which is lighted a fire and on this glii is poured. The offerings made to it are given to Bhangi faqirs, who are recruited from the Chuhras. The Bhlmikis hold themselves aloof from other Cluilird; groups such as the Bhalla or Dhankta, Rawat, Halad, Daung, Dhdnak, Megh and Ileri, and do not marry with them. In inarriage four gots are avoided and the wedding is solemnised by a guru of their own called a Meora, but a Chhaman or Jhaman is also said to fulfil the functions of a Braliman and conduct the seven 'pheras. The Ltllbegi thus appears to be identical with the Bi'ilmiki, though many accounts treat them as distinct.f In what they may differ does not however appear. The Lhlbegi certainly seems to be In sanki portion ^ ^ - only 2l sounds are heard instead of 3. t E.p. in Sirmur the Bdlmib's are said to worship Bdlmfk hiu i • State the Balimkis are said to marry on equal terms with the Aiazbis ^ Ip th s the Ldlhegis and Chuhras, 23 superior to and distinct from the Dhiiuak,* and followers of Bdlmik do not eat food touched by a Dlidnak. The Ldlbogis of the Siirsud got are said to bo the original inhabitants of iiewari, and besides Lalbeg they affect the Devi. Early marrla«^e IS the 1 ule 8^d the weddiii^ i itcs are performed by a Brahman. Never- theless the Sdrsud, though they observe Hindu customs, bury their dead, because, they say, their ancestors once worshipped the goddess Bai. The Hindu Chuhras in Sirmur appear to be mainly Balinikis, They arc dinded into the following septs : — Dhalla or Dhaukta, Ilawat, Haled, Uauiig, Dhanak, Megh, llari, ilazbi, Balniiki, of which the latter are found in Nahan tahsil. Four gots arc avoided in iiuiniagc. Weddings are solemnised by their own j/uriis, who form a distinct, I.C., P/ii'rfca called Meora, resembling the pddhuH of the Hindus, but are said to take food {kachchi roii and pakki) and water from all Chuhras. Tlio Balmiki's and Mazbis intermarry on equal terms. Balmik and Gurii Uiim Kai are worshipped, but not Lalbeg. Balmik has a makdn {pukka or kachcha) in front of wliich a fire is lighted, and on this ghi is poured. Offerings made to it are given to Bhangi/ugtVs who are taken from the ranks of the Chuhids. The Balmikis do not marry, eat or drink with the other groups, as they regard them as inferior. At weddings the chhaman fulfills the functions of a Brahman, and conducts the 7 pheras. Girls, or sdd/wn of their own, are fed in lieu of Brahmans, If a Bhangi marrj' a woman of another caste he is fined, but his children are regarded as legitimate. The dead are both burnt or buried, ac- cording to the means of the family, burial being cheaper. Daughters may inherit in default of sons, if their father bequeaths or gives his property to them. A wife can be divorced but a panchdyat can award her maintenance. In Nahan town each mohalla (and there are seven) has its punch. A chaudhri is appointed by the State and he nominates the punch. In Paonta tahsil the Chuhras do not intermarry with the Char.gars. They have their own Brahmans who solemnise marriages. The latter do not drink water from the hands of, or accept food from, the Chuhras, but they may take dita and ddl and cook it for them- selves. Any man can enter the Chuhra caste. Ho is struck five times on the waist with a broom in the name of Balmik and made to pay a fine. Then the Chuhras cat with him and ho is free of the caste. Funeral ceremonies. They carry their dead on a bier. On a place midway between their house and the burial ground they place the bier and offer pi »Kia (e) or funeral cakes to the manes of the dead, 'i he bier is then carried to the burial ground where a grave is dug and the dead body is laid in it with its face turned towards the Gflnges. The grave is then filled up and in the way everybody breaks a straw. Some say that this means that all connections with the deceased are now broken up. On the third day all persons who carried ih: bier aie feasted. If the party be a rich man, the whole burddri is fed. The Lalbegi may be regarded as a llinduised Chuhra, just as the Mazbi or Rangrela is a Sikh convert, and the ilu-salli, Ilalalkhor or KuUua a Chuhra convert to Islam. The Chuhras have Br>ihmaus of their own, who do not, however, w'ork as Chuhras, but live on the gifts and fees paid to them by their patrons. These Hrahmiuis do not e.'it food cooked by Chuhras, or smoke with them (except in Kangra where, it is said, tliey do smoke with Chuhras) ; though they do not avoid contact [chhdt) with them like other Brahmans. These Brahmsua marry among themselves and burn their dead. Their gotra is said to bo Ratn Bhardwaji and they wear rosaries of rudrdksh beads and the tiku on their foreheads like regular Brahmans. Once a year the Brahman guru celebrates a bhanddra or feast at wtiich all the sweepers assemble and offer him gifts in cash or kind. * An account from passion for her son. same account assigns 55 gots z Dibla.

These Mirasis receive Lal Dabi.— a sect o£ Musalmtos who approach to Hinduism. It was founded bv Llil Dds, a Meo of Alwar, who though like all Meos a Musalmin by faith, followed, again like all Meos, Hindu observances. He was born about 1540 A.D., and the account of his life and teachings which follows is taken from Powlett’s Gazetteer of Alwar, pi^. 53 ei seq. Ihe devotees of the sect are called Sddhs. The worship conasts largely of repeating the name of Ram, and biinday i8 their high-day. Ye Lal Das was a Musalmdn, is considered to be a Pir, and the greater number of his followers^ in the Mewat proper at least, are Musalman Meos, though on the Punjab border,^ where the spread of education has made the Meos better Muhammacians, the LcLl Dasis are usually Dindu lianias and carpenteis. Lal Das lived many years at Dhaoli Dhab, and used to wander over the hills behind Alwar and into the fort in search of sticks, by selling which he got his living. At length he began to work miracles. An excited elephant stopped in full career and saluted him, •xiid a Musalman saint, one Chishti Gadan, of Tijdra, found him standing in the air in meditation. 'i he Musalman conversed with Lal Das, and discovering his piety and unworld- liness enjoined him to teach both Hindus and Musalmaiis. After this Lal Das went and lived at Bandoli, 16 miles north-east of Alwar, in the Kamgarh ^argana. There ‘belaboured for his own support and the good of others.’ He lived on ttie top of a hill, and went through frreat austerities in the hottest weather, was safe from snake and from tiger , and cured ?be sick. Disciples of all castes collected round him, and one, an oilman, received from him miraculous power, which he used to expose an adulteress before an assembly. For this Lal Das reproved him, and eventually resumed his gift. Lai Das prayed that he might be relieved of all his false disciples, so persecution from a Mughal official began, and they all fell away. It arose from Lal Das ’ having caused the death of a Mughal who had laid hands on another man’s wife, and with his true followers he was carried to Bahadarpur, afew miles ofE. The Muhammadan /a 'ijddr of Bahadarpur expressed surprise at his being followed by both Hindus and Musalmans, and asked him what he was. Lal Das replied that the question was a foolish one— what he was in truth he knew not, but he got his garment, the flesh, in a Meo’s house. The/aiydur demanded Rs. 5 apiece from the party as the price of releasing them, but they would pay nothing, and then thefaujdd* gave them water from a poisonous well, the only result of which was that the well became sweet, and was known afterwards as ‘ the sugar well.’ On another occasion Lal Das was assaulted by Mughals, and called to his protection angels, who slew 14 of them, but his followers, thinking that anger was derogatory to Lal Das, spread a report that they had killed the Mughals, and that Lal Das had shown no anger. L41 Das left Bandoli, and resided at the neighbouring village of Todi, now in Gurgaon, on the Alwar border, where, being persecuted, he went away. At Naroli the people refused him water, whereupon their wells dried up. At Rasgan, in Ramgarh, he was well received, and Uhere he remained a while, “ repeating God’s name, and teaching disciples the way.” Lal Das. thcwgh at times he is said to have practised the severest asceticism, had not led a life of celibacy. He had a daughter, named Sarupa, who could work miracles. One day he told that greatness and wonder-working even were vanity, they, too, pass away like the wind, purity and gentleness alone were availing. Ihose who possessed would attain to peace in heav'en (Hur he lok), and no more be subject to birth and death Lal Das^s son, Paliara, too, was a mu-acle\\vorker-^ffieLings on^^^^^^ and on Lal Das s brothers, Sher Khan and Ghaus Khan. These all had hope in God (Harji) alone, and m no other Deo. A voice in a mosque ( ? Harmandir), where Lal D4s had gone, foretold the birth to him of a son who was to be a polar star (Qutb), and would succeed the works of many births. Lal Uas received the announcement with one word, Bhala. A fevynoiiths afleL daughter was born to him, who died directly.

A deep stream was in the way, but, as Sarupa walked forward, a dry path appeared, and the little corpse was carried to Bandoli, where a danjdh was estaULhed which has still a great reputation. It was reported to Sahib Ilukm, Mughal governor of Tijara, that L41 Das didnot pray as a Musalman, nor perform ablutions, nor call on the prophet, but that he taught Hindus and Musalmiins the same doctrine. The hakim sent for Lai D4s, who received the messengers kindly, and accompanied them with 12 disciples Avho refused to leave him. A vicious horse which he had to ride became quiet in hi • hands, and a fawn which one of the Musalinins killed, and compelled Lai Das to carrv, came to life. The Tijara hakim treated Lai Das kindly. Jlut he offered him meat, saying that it was Musalman food, and that ho who was a Musalman and ate as such was in the path of God. Lai Das replied, “ Love God. God is one and separate from ad. There i one path for Hindu and Turk, by which they come and go. Whoever kills anotlier cuts his own throat, for the murdered is avenged by God’s casting the r.urderer into licll. Let mo be shown l ow to escape before the judgment-seat, where God himself will do justice. The good keep in mind the fear of that day.” Lai Das then took the food into his hand, and the meat turned to fmo rice, Lai Das anti his 12 followers were then confined under a guard for the night, but without severity. They all vanished, and the guard was imprisoned for letting them go, on which they all appeared again in the jail. Sahib Ilukm. the hakim, had a beloved daughter who was tormented by a witch, and the nacromancers (JMuyirti) could do nothing to relieve her, and Qazis and Maulavis could not exercise the evil spirit. Her mother appealed to i.al Das, and he went to the girl who immediately began to kiss his feet, and the demon (jtn) having left the girl, appeared before Lai Das and declared his submission. In Maujpur (Lachmangurh panjutia) was a holy man, Mansukha by name, and a Malli by caste, who loved God with a true love (sac/i/ii prt'f), and gave much in alms. He believed in Lai Das, but his wife disparaged him because he worked no miracles and because he could not avoid being carried off to Tijara. Mansukha said that Lai Das knew the thoughts of men. On his going shortly after to pay his respects, L«1 Das received him badly on account of his unbelieving wife. Jlansukha was going sorrowfully away. Liil Dins, how'ever, forgave him, and called him back and comforted him, just as a mother lakes into her arms and consoles a child whom she has corrected ,\\n Agra merchant was shipwrecKed. He asked for a<lvico. Some said one thing, some another, but ho remembered Lai Das and called on him, jiromising him a litlic if his goods were saved. Lai Das heard the prayer of the distant merchant, and showed miotion. The goods were saved. However, Lai Das refused his thank-oll’ering, as he had no need of wealth, but told him to give it to Vishnu uddhs. A Kayath of Agra, of great wealth and of high position, was alllictcd by lepros^y or some foul skin disease, which made life a burdeji to him. Hearing of Lai Das’s goodness to the shipwrecked merchant, he went to him at the full moon, Ldl Das’s chief day of reception. The saint told the Kayath to give all his goods in charity and abandon the world. In token of his having for.saken all pride and wordliness, he was to blacken his face, mount a donkey, ami hang a gourd on his back. He obeyed, and on his subsequently bathing at the junction of the rivers at Allahabad, his body became as pure as gold.

The Meos having carried off hi.s buffaloes, J,al Das prophesied that the Mewat should belong to the Kachwaha.s and their chief Jai Singh. Before his death, Lai Das having met with one Thakuria of Chajuii, who main- tained himself and fed others out of the proceeds of his own labour, and was blessed by God with the necessary virtues, wished to appoint him his successor, but Thtikuria declined the honour as being unworthy of it, and Lai Das gave him the choice of burial alive or acceptance of authority.

Lalotra, a sept of Rajputs found in Sialkor, and probaWy the same as the Lalota. They are said to intermarry with the Bajju Rajputs. Lama, the priest of the Buddhists in Lahul, Spiti and Kanaur. The word is apparently a corruption of Brahman, the Tibetan form being hldma. One of the most peculiai- features of the lamaic system is the hierarchy from which it takes its name. The teaching of Buddha included an elaborate monastic system, but no priests, for there was no god to worship or ceremonies to perform, and no hierarchy, for all men were equal. And till about A. D. 1400 the Idmds or monks of Tibet recognised no supreme head of the faith. But about that time the abbot of the Gahldan monastery near Lhdsa proclaimed himself the patriarch of the ivhole lamaic priesthood, and his successor, of the Tashi monastery, declared the grand Idrnda to be the perpetual re- incarnations of one of the Bodhisatvas or semi-Buddhas, who, as each Idmd died, was born again in the person of an infant that might bo known by the possession of certain divine marks. The fifth in suc- cession founded the liierarchy of Dalai Idmds at Lhrlsa in 1640, and made himself master of the whole of Tibet, lie assumed the title of Dalai L^ma, while the Idmd of Tashi still continued to enjoy his former privileges, and thus we now have two great chairs filled by a double series of incarnations. There is also a third great Idmd in Bhutan, known among the Bhutanis as the Dharma Raja, but among the libetans as Lord of the World. Below these three great Ldvids come the ordinary monks, who live for the most part in monasteries ruled by abbots whose only claim to precedence one over another is derived from the importance of the institution over which they preside, or from the influence of personal sanctity. They are, with the exception of the Drukhpa sect, bound to celibacy, at least while leading a monastic lifOi^ and are collectively called gedun, or clergy. They consist of Idmds or full monks (for the word means nothing more), and aioviccs or neophytes.^ Ihere are also convents for nuns, which aic very numerous. Iho are distinguishtd by losaries of IC'b beads, which they wear as necklaces. i riuiogeniture obtains among the landholders of Spiti, the eldest sou Bucccedmg to the land as soon as lio is of full age, and the fathei' ben,g pensioned ofl. i he 3 ounger sons, as they grow up, retire to the auoestial cell 111 tho monastery, where they supixiit tliemselves by such nidustnes as can bo pursued within the walls et tho building, and by a ms and fees oltei. supplemented by an allowance from the eldest son. It ll.e latter dm without leaving a son, the eldest of surviving brothers who cares to do so abandons the monastic lito, resumes the tironerlv and becomes the husband oi the widow without lurtlier ceremony The Tibetan Wnidsare divided into three chief sects of which the mest ancient aie tho NihUMAi'A or ivyimapa, whoso iollowers wear red clothue-, and to winch most of the lumas of Ladakh beloiio-. The Dkagfa hdmaism in Sfiti, 27 or Drukhpa sect also wear red garments, and are ruled over by the Dharina or great Idmd of Bhutan, in which country tlioy aro'^inost numerous. It would appear that the Spiti larndn belong partly and tlie Lithul Idmda almost entirely to this sect, which jiiermits its monks to marry. The Gelukpa sect was founded about A. D. 1400 by the first great Idmd of Gdldditn, and its followers are distinguished by yellow garments, the sect prevails chiefly in fl’ibet, and both the Dalai and the Tashi Idmda belong to it. In Spiti the younger sons of a Inndowner, the younger brothers of a KiiANQ-cniiEN-rA, are sent in childhood to Buddliist monasteries in which they spend their lives, unless, in the event 'of the Kl;ang-chhon-pa failing to beget issue, one of them elects to abandon the monastic life and take his eldest brother’s place in the family. It is only rarely that the son of a dutal-pa, or cottager, becomes a monk. It is also open to the eldest sou to enter a monastery, in which case his next brother will marry and inherit the fathers’ land. Some- times liowever, the son of a diital-pa does become a monk. The profession is tlms confined as a rule to the younger sons of the regular landholders, who take to it of necessity, but get as maintenance the produce of a field set aside as tdo or da-zhing (from dawa, a synonym for Idma). It is, however, only the second son who is entitled to claim da-zhing, and many do not take it from their elder brothers, but have all in common with him, including their income from begging, funeral fees, etc.*^ ’Phis is to the advantage of the elder brother, as a celibate monk’s expenses are of course very small. When there are more than two brothers, thoyounger ones, though they cannot get da-zhing , arc consider- ed entitled to some subsistence allowance from the head of the family, but in return they do certain kinds of work for him in the summer, during which season only the elder monks remain in the monasteries. For the instance, as long as they are tsun-pa or ge-taul, that is, neophytes nr deacons, and not gelong, or fully ordained monks or priests, they will carry loads and do all field work except ploughing ; when gelong they will cook, feed cattle and sheep, and do other domestic services, but not carry loads or cut grass or wood. But ‘ once a monk always a monk ’ is not the law in Spiti. Supposing the head of a family to die atid leave a young widow, with no son or a son of tender age only, then the younger brother, if there is one, almost always elects to leave the monastery, and thereupon he is at once considered his brother’s widow’s husband. She cannot object, nor is any marriage ceremony necessary. t If there was a son by the elder brother, ho of course suc- ceeds when of full age, and his mother and uncle retire to the small house, and the other sons, if any, go into the monasteries in the usual way. t?o, again, if the head of the family has only daughters, and, having given up hope of getting a son, wishes to marry one of his dano'htcrs and take her husband into the h</use as his son and heir, O * NevertlielePS in most holdings a plot of from one to half a khal will be found in the occupation of the hima brother or uncle of tho head of the family. It is plough^ and sown by the latter, but the lama provides the seod and gets the whole produce. The dn-zhing reverts of course to the head of the famih' on the death of the Idma. t The eldest son, or if he has a call to become a monk, the next son, who h.as not turnea luma, alone goes through the marriage ceremony wuh the bride. chief rite at tne wedding appears to consist in making a cake or vdzar, (lit, picture ) of sa u or is worshipped and then thrown away, outside the hamlet to.avert evils. 2S Ldma orders in Spiti. f it generally happens that the younger brother in the monastery objects, and says he will leave the priesthood end beget a son. In such cases his vicrU to do so is generally allowed : sometimes he will marry a wife to himself, and put his elder brother in the small house, sometimes, by ao-reeineiit, he will cohabit with his sister-in-law in hope of getting a son by her. A monk who throws off the frock in this way has to pay a fine to his monastery. Many decline to become laymen : Sir James Lyall believed that this was a rule in the case of those who have attain- ed to the grade of gelong. Where the ldma brother declines, then it is agreed that, in the lower part of the valley {i.e. Kothis Pin and Sham), the father or widow-mother can take a son-in-law to live in the house and succeed as son and heir, and no kinsmen (if there are any) can object. In Spiti the monks of Pin are of the Drukhpa, and not of the Gelukpa or celibate class to which those of the other four monasteries, Ki, Dankliar or Lawopi, Tabo and Tang-gyut, belong. They marry in imitation of their patron saint Guru Rimboclii, though in their books marriage is not approved of : this saint founded several orders, of which that to which the monks of Pin belong is the most ancient, and is called Ngyangma. The wives and families of the monks live not in the monasteries, but in small houses in the villages. Every son of a ldma or monk becomes a huzhan, which is the name given to a low order of strolling monks or friars. There are nineteen families of these 67iz/iaws in Pin Kothi, Sometimes the younger son of a land- holder becomes a huzhan in preference to going into the monastery. Those huzhans are a very curious set of people, they get a living by wandering in small parties through all the neighbouring countries, stopping at every village, and acting plays, chanting legends, and dancing like whirling dervishes, many also trade in a small way by bartering grain for salt with the Tibetans, and then exchanging the salt with the Kanaur people for iron, buck-wheat, or honey, they also often undertake to carry loads for travellers across the passes, as substitutes for the landholders. They dress much like other monks, but, instead of shaving their heads, wear their hair in long straight twists, which gives them a very wild appearance. According to the story told to Sir James Lyall in Spiti the huzhan order was found by one Thang-thong Gialpo (lit. ‘ king of the desert) under the following circumstances A certain king of Lluisa perverted the people of Tibet from Buddhism to a new religion of his own. He succeeded so well that in the course of fifty years the old faith was quite forgotten, and the Om mdni 'padme hun, ot sacred ejaculation, quite disused. To win back the people, Psan-rezig, the divinity worshipped at 'I'rilokn^th, caused an incarnation of himself to be born in a king’s house in the person of Ihang-thong Gidlpo ; the child grew up a saint and a reformei^ he saw that it was impossible to reclaim the people by books, and he thei;efore adopted the dress since worn by the huzhans, and spent his life m wandering from villasre to villao-P spent ms me m wanaering trom village to village, offering to amuse tlm people by acting miracle-plays on conditimi of theii Repeating after him the chorus Om mam pddme horn whenever it occurred in the chants or recitation In this way the people became again accustomed to repeat the sacred sentence, their souths became purified,” and Ldmn death engtoms. 29 the religion of Buddha revived. There is something rather impres- sive about the performances of these huzhans. The lamas of the various sects in Spiti have next to nothing to do with tlie burial or burning of tlie dead, since those functions are in the hands of a certain class of people called yo&a (pronounced joa). This class is however unknown in Upper Kanaur, Ldhul and Laddkh, As Spiti is a woodless country burtMiig is seldom resorted to, except in the case of a prominent lama who has departed this life and as such must be burnt. The dead are also buried, sometimes in fields or near them, in places which belong to the family, and sometimes under rocks : while strangers, poor people and more especially children, even those of the well-to-do, are thrown into the streams. A fourth custom, very common in Spiti, but unknown in Flm and its neighbourhood, is the rending of the corpse in pieces, which afford a welcome meal to fish and to the Lammergeiers which are caWed jajin ov jazas. A lama especially a Great L;iraa, must always be careful when on his death-bed to depai-t from this world in the posture of a sitting Buddha. If he quits it without assuming that seated attitude his learn- ing counts for nothing and his fame is lost for ever. Thren such atti- tudes are distinguishetl, (1) the usual one in which the dying man cannot see his feet, (2) that in which the soles of the feet appear to bo turned upwards, and (3) the peculiarly artificial dzogsjie skyiltrung. The more artistic the posture of a Great Lima at his demise and the longer his cor-pse preserves it, the higher rises his reputation and the respect in which he is held by all the people. As soon as his body begins to lean to one side it can be carried out and burnt at the spot where the chhodrten or grave-stone has already been set up. All corpses are said to be tightly bound before burial in the tracts under Buddhist influence. The ricrid tying up of the body is due to a fear of the rolangs or re- surrection of the body in which a spirit or kobbold enters into tho corpse. The vetdlas or corpses temporarily animated by kobbolds, ac- cording to the popular belief, share the tendency of dead bodies to be- come sHff anil so cannot stoop. Owing to this belief at Uilsa low doors are preferred for houses in the neighbourhood of burial places.
