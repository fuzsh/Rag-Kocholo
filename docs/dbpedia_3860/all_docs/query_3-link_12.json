        "text": "This paper presents a study of the most important factors influencing the sintering process spinel (MgAl 2 O 4) Minutes from the oxides of aluminum (Al 2 O 4) and Magnesium (MgO) percentages by weight (MgO 28wt%, Al2O3 72wt%). The traditional method called solid-state reaction (SSR), single firing stage and the impact of these factors on the physical properties, and thermal as well as the fine structure and morphology of the ceramic product. It formed Spinel models through a steel mold and shed pressure (14 Mpa) using hydraulic piston at temperatures (1200, 1400°C) and soaking time (2 h) with the study of the effect of adding oxide calcium (CaO) by weight (0,2,4,6,8 wt%) spinel on the properties and behavior as sintered the research study of the most important physical characteristics (density, porosity) and (Thermal Conductivity). The results showed that the density increased and porosity decreased with higher temperatures due to the process of sintering, as it reached the highest density at the temperature of burning 1400°C which (1.88 g/cm 3), which is porosity (47.48 %). Thermal conductivity was the best value (5.071 K w/cm. °C). As well as the study of (XRD, SEM). The calcined specimens spinel were characterized by XRD, It showed the presence of developed spinel also showed that the best catalyst is CaO, and (SEM). It showed that high temperature sintering temperatures increase the regularity of the Grain Growth and cohesion in the bloc, as well as minutes from the acquisition of the spherical shape of the minutes spinel.\n\nHighly crystalline-textured pure dense alumina ceramics were fabricated from spherical alumina powder without any seed particles and sintering additives by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) in a strong magnetic field of 10 T. The crystalline texture was confirmed by x-ray diffraction (XRD) for alumina ceramics deposited at 10 T followed by sintering at 1873 K. The angle between the directions of the magnetic and electric fields (φB-E) was altered to control the dominant crystal faces of the α-alumina monoliths. The average orientation angles estimated from the XRD diagram of the samples prepared at φB-E = 0°, 45°, and 90° were 16.52°, 45.15°, and 84.90°, respectively. Alumina/alumina laminar composites with different crystalline-oriented layers were also fabricated by alternately changing the φB-E layer by layer during EPD in a 10 T magnetic field. It was demonstrated that by using this technique, it is possible to control the crystalline orientation by changing the angle of E versus...\n\nTheories and applications associated with sintering of ceramics and reducing of sintering temperature are reviewed. The whole sintering process is divided into three sub-processes as powder preparation, compaction and sintering, and each sub-process is discussed in terms of its possible contribution to the reducing of sintering temperature. New approach for practical optimization of sintering process is investigated. The application of above in the Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramics (LTCC) is discussed. Meanwhile, many successful applications in reducing the sintering temperatures are presented."
