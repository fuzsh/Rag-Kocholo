        "text": "“It’s so bad that the tribute bands don’t sound worse,\" is how frontman Alex Turner once described his band's name, The Arctic Monkeys. The moniker was randomly suggested by the group's guitarist Jamie Cook, who all these years later still refuses to explain why. “There might have been other ideas for offshoots at the time, but the Monkeys was the first one,\" Turner told Q Magazine in 2011. “If you realised you were gonna be doing this 20 years later, you might’ve had another hour in that meeting.”\n\nA band's name is fundamental to their identity, that particular combination reflecting the essence of how you define yourselves and the music people can expect. It’s said there are rules and formulas to a good band name: Is it original? Memorable? Can you Google it? Does it have a good story and reflect the music you’re making?\n\nFor every group that comes up with a terrible name and sticks with it, there have been some near misses with bands who were very close to getting it very wrong. Would Creed have been as successful if they’d kept the name Naked Toddler? Would “Iris” have topped one million UK sales if the Goo Goo Dolls had stuck with the name, The Sex Maggots? Would we love Radiohead if they were still called, the frankly appalling, On A Friday?\n\n“The Spice Girls is a great band name” says Michael Cragg, author of the excellent Reach for the Stars, an oral history of UK pop music from '96 to 2006. “It was Touch, then it was Spice, and then people in label meetings kept calling them 'those Spice Girls', so the name evolved over time. It also meant they were easy to caricature in the way that happened with the whole Posh Spice, Scary Spice etc nicknames. Posh Touch? Sounds like something unsavoury that happens at Eton.”\n\nFor Michelle Kambasha, a music publicist with a decade of experience working alongside bands such as Bon Iver and The War on Drugs, the Spice Girls moniker made them a brand. “Ultimately for someone like them, selling the Sporty, Posh, Scary element seemed so integral to their success. They’re a product, not a band.”\n\nFor Cragg, some names do signpost specific elements of a band, or their music; “Radiohead suggests geeks, Girls Aloud hints at some sort of rebellion, Five and S Club 7 both let you know how many members you're dealing with. Although 5ive are still performing as 5ive, even though it should be 3hree.” Elsewhere in Reach for the Stars he reveals that Anthony from Blue wanted the band to be called LADS after their names (Lee, Anthony, Duncan, Simon), though admits it may have sent the wrong message.\n\nFor some artists, changing to a new moniker when they are already a household name is way to reflect a new chapter of their career. Or as Diddy put it “an evolution of my spirit and my vibration” (he was P. Diddy, then Diddy, then back to P. Diddy, then Sean Jean, then Puff Daddy, and most recently Brother Love, which he shortened to Love). Prince famously became the symbols of the female and male gender combined in 1993 as “an unpronounceable symbol whose meaning has not been identified.” Recently The Weeknd announced he wants to “Kill the Weeknd\" and instead will be going by his birth name, Abel Tesfaye.\n\nThese different names signpost each artist's identity at different stages in their career, but what about poor Blur, whose name was essentially chosen for them? After their original name Seymour was rejected by the record company, the band chose Blur from a list of alternatives the label drew up. The shortlist, which read like contenders for a toothpaste company, included Sensitize, Whirlpool and The Shining Path. With the benefit of their subsequent success, Blur sounds both inevitable and right, but would we be saying the same while listening to Whirlpool headline the Pyramid stage had that been the final choice?\n\nWhat a name boils down to, for Cragg, is that it “should be uncomplicated, easy to remember and not get in the way of your enjoyment of the music.” That’s something The National were going for when they started out. Matt Berninger said in a 2007 interview that the band “were trying to find a name that didn't mean anything. That was sort of devoid of any kind of interpretation and wasn't overly clever. Although that backfired a little bit when we went to Europe— in Germany, we actually had some shows boycotted because they thought we were in some way affiliated with the right-wing conservative neo-Nazi party.”\n\nKambasha became all too aware of the impact that impact choosing a name with negative connotations can have when working with the band Preoccupations PR when they were called Viet Cong. “If you divorce the history of the name, it’s an attention-grabbing name, but that’s not really possible if people’s feelings are affected,” she says.\n\nWhile she believe the ‘The’ prefix is a tried and tested method that has stood the test of time, the ubiquitousness of certain words in group names ends up making those bands sound unoriginal. You need to find that sweet spot between originality and attention grabbing, while not inadvertently deeply annoying. Naturally, there are only so many combinations of words left to choose from and that can mean a race to the bottom. Kambasha feels like “every year names get so much more out there, like people are really pushing the mark to sound different. I fear we’re flying too close to the sun,” she says.\n\nBut, really, is there such thing as a bad band name? As Cragg says, “Most band names sound stupid once taken out of context - Girls Aloud! Sugababes! Coldplay!? – but as soon as the band becomes ubiquitous the name takes on an almost abstract quality. You don't think about it deeply anymore; what it means, what it's supposed to connote.” If The Beatles can get away with a pun - a terrible pun at that - then we all can. Would they have been as successful if they’d been called The Quarrymen - or even Joe Lean And The Jing Jang Jong? Almost certainly.\n\nIt’s a sentiment shared by Kambasha: “Ultimately the quality of the music almost always prevails. Arctic Monkeys have a terrible name but I think the quality of the music, and indeed how that’s reflected in acclaim, not just commercial success, says a lot.” The old adage goes that ‘the name names the band’, but it’s really the opposite, with any luck the band becomes bigger than the name."
