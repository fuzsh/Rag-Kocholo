        "text": "Janis Joplin and Grace Slick for the first queens of rock in the 60’s and in the 70’s came Ann and Nancy Wilson who were arguably the first modern rock chicks. In the later part of the 70’s and early 80’s we had such great ladies like Pat Benatar, Chrissie Hynde and Debbie Harry. All of these women were rock queens in the true sense and their contribution to music will always be remembered.\n\nIn 1981, two all female bands made their way into the spotlight, The Go-Gos and Girlschool. While the former had a more commercial rock sound, the latter was straight forward heavy metal and stood alongside of many of the NWOBHM acts that were coming out that year. However, these two weren’t the all female bands who could blow speakers with great power chords. Before them came The Runaways.\n\nI had heard of The Runaways even before the film that came out a few years ago. Even at the tender (small chuckle here) age of sixteen, I was enamoured with these fine ladies who played such aggressive music. I did listen to their debut album and liked it. Likewise, I wanted to listen to their second one “Queens of Noise” but never got the chance. Must rectify that in the future. While, I never heard any of their songs on that cheap AM radio I had back then, they toured extensively and played many sell out concerts in the US and Japan. Furthermore, the likes of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Cheap Trick and Van Halen supported them. Unfortunately, accusations of mismanagement, rows over money and direction plus several personnel changes lead to break up of the band.\n\nAlbums:\n\nThe Runaways- 1976\n\nQueens of Noise- 1977\n\nWaitin’ for the Night- 1977\n\nLive in Japan- 1977\n\nAnd Now, The Runaways- 1978\n\nThe Runaways\n\nCherrie Currie- vocals\n\nJoan Jett- guitar, vocals\n\nLita Ford- guitar\n\nJackie Fox- bass\n\nSandy West- drums\n\n*Vicki Blue and Laurie McAllister also played bass during The Runaways reign\n\nWhile The Runaways may be no longer, the members are still around and making themselves known. One of them would dethrone Pat Benatar as the queen of rock in 1982 and possibly become the first metal queen. That one is up for debate. Another ex Runaway would also make a huge splash in heavy metal circles nor would some of the other former members remain completely silent. Almost silently, these ladies would go onto to be an influence on heavy metal and I think the all female metal bands that would spring up less than a decade later can look to them for inspiration. Don’t take my word for it, watch the film and listen to their music for yourself.\n\nNext post: 1982- The Floodgates Are Open\n\nTo buy Rock And Roll Children, go to http://www.strategicpublishinggroup.com/title/RockAndRollChildren.html\n\nAlso available on Amazon, Barnes & Noble and Froogle and on sale at Foyles Book Shop in London"
