        "text": "\"Rock 'n' roll is blood sport -- a man's sport!\" bellows Kim Fowley in \"The Runaways.\" \"You bitches have to start thinking like men.\"\n\nFowley, of course, isn't just trying to \"toughen up\" the all-girl band he manages. He's also expressing the state of rock 'n' roll in 1975.\n\n\"The Runaways,\" which hits area theaters Friday, explores the rise and fall of the 1970s Los Angeles band.\n\nLed by the black-leather-clad Joan Jett, the quintet played rock 'n' roll loud and rough. They practiced in a trailer park. They had bad attitudes.\n\nThey also were teenage girls looking to make it in a time when rock 'n' roll was dominated by men. As Jett's guitar teacher says when he hands her an acoustic guitar in the movie, \"Girls don't play electric guitar.\"\n\nJett did anyway -- and, in the process, the Runaways redefined gender in rock.\n\n\"The Runaways were groundbreakers,\" says Holly George-Warren, a music historian and author of \"The Rolling Stone Book of Women in Rock.\" \"The lyrics were provocative and they didn't have this prettiness that was expected of female musicians.\"\n\nBefore the Runaways, those expectations were simple: OK, you can sing in the band, maybe even be a folkie, but don't you dare crank up that amp and get in our face.\n\n\"You'd have people like Mama Cass playing earth momma or an all-girl group like the Supremes,\" says George-Warren, who resides in New York. \"But there were no role models for the Runaways.\"\n\nAt least no female role models.\n\nJett and the rest of the Runaways -- singer Cherie Currie, guitarist Lita Ford, bassist Micki Steele and drummer Sandy West -- wanted to rock like men: Iggy Pop, Mick Jagger, David Bowie.\n\nIn \"The Runaways,\" Currie even performs at a high school talent show as Bowie -- face paint and all.\n\n\"People often break things down simply as male vs. female roles,\" says George-Warren. \"But rock 'n' roll has always had this androgyny that transcends that: Elvis wore makeup. Iggy Pop had this feminine side. Janis Joplin inspired Robert Plant much more than she inspired Melissa Etheridge.\"\n\nThe breakdown of gender roles exploded in the 1970s glam era.\n\nBowie was the glitter king who preened like a queen. Alice Cooper wore fishnets and corsets. Roxy Music, Queen and Gary Glitter acted like kinky, campy members of a burlesque show.\n\nThe New York Dolls were more girlie than that their all-girl compatriots, the Runaways. Jett and Co. acted like bad boys. The Dolls dressed in drag.\n\nBy the time punk broke, women were liberated to rock -- at least in the underground.\n\n\"For the first time, there wasn't this musical criteria that you had to be some amazing musician,\" George-Warren says. \"Both men and women were intimidated by prog rock -- and it opened the doors for so many people, especially women.\"\n\nBands such as Blondie, X, the Plasmatics, Lydia Lunch, X-ray Spex, and Siouxsie and the Banshees all featured women unafraid to rage or just turn notions of femininity on its head.\n\n\"Debbie Harry turned the cliche girl singer into a drag show,\" George-Warren says. \"And Nina Hagen and Lydia Lunch took 'sex appeal' and turned it inside out, into the attack of the 50-foot woman.\"\n\nThe in-your-face-but-campy approach paved the way for Madonna, Lady Gaga and Courtney Love, adds George-Warren.\n\nPunk also spawned the indie, alternative-rock and riot-grrrl movements -- not to mention a new era for women.\n\nFor the first time, performers such as PJ Harvey, Liz Phair, Kim Deal or bands like Sleater-Kinney, Bikini Kill and Le Tigre were just artists and bands.\n\n\"Female performers used to be such a novelty,\" says George-Warren. \"We've come such a long way.\"\n\nSo far that Jovana Batkovic doesn't even think of herself as a member of an all-girls band -- the Cleveland-based HotChaCha.\n\n\"We ended up an all-girls band because we're friends and just decided to start a band together,\" says Batkovic, who sings in the post-punk quartet. \"I guess it's still a novelty to some people -- at least when it comes to mainstream music.\"\n\nSome see novelty. Others see \"expressions of womanhood.\"\n\nBatkovic finds neither appealing.\n\n\"I see these female pop singers barely wearing anything onstage, and I don't get it,\" she says. \"And then I hear people saying that it's great that we can do this -- as if they're surprised that women would be playing -- and I don't get that, either.\"\n\nThen there's the whole sisterhood thing.\n\n\"I never even think about being influenced by women -- I'd rather think of myself as some middle gender that's neither male nor female,\" Batkovic says. \"I'm way more inspired by Mick Jagger and David Bowie than Ani DiFranco, anyway.\"\n\nJoan Jett would be proud."
