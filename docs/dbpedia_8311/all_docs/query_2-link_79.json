        "text": "by Wayne J. Gardner\n\n“The Runaways were rebels, all of us, and we were fearless.” — Joan Jett\n\nThe 1970s were a decade of revolution and change, and few bands embodied that spirit more than The Runaways. This all-female rock band was formed in 1975 by Joan Jett and Sandy West, and quickly gained notoriety for their rebellious spirit and raw sound. Over the next few years, The Runaways became one of the most talked-about bands in the world, thanks in no small part to their manager, Kim Fowley.\n\nFowley was a colorful character to say the least. He was a master of publicity and promotion, and he knew exactly how to get The Runaways noticed. He was also a controversial figure, with accusations of misogyny and sexual exploitation following him throughout his career. But love him or hate him, there’s no denying that Fowley played a key role in the rise of The Runaways.\n\nThe band’s lineup changed several times over the years, but the core members were Joan Jett, Cherie Currie, Lita Ford, and Sandy West. Jett was the driving force behind the band, and her powerful vocals and guitar skills quickly made her a fan favourite. Currie was the lead vocalist, known for her sultry voice and provocative stage presence. Ford was the lead guitarist, and her shredding solos helped give The Runaways their distinctive sound. And West was the drummer, known for her high-energy performances and hard-hitting beats.\n\nThe Runaways released their debut album in 1976, simply titled “The Runaways.” The album was a commercial success, reaching the top 100 on the Billboard charts. It was followed up with “Queens of Noise” in 1977, which featured hits like “Born to Be Bad” and “Cherry Bomb.” The band continued to tour and record over the next few years, but internal tensions and personal problems began to take their toll.\n\nIn 1979, The Runaways disbanded. The members went on to pursue solo careers, with varying degrees of success. Joan Jett had the most successful post-Runaways career, releasing hits like “I Love Rock ’n’ Roll” and “Bad Reputation.” Lita Ford also had a successful solo career, with hits like “Kiss Me Deadly” and “Close My Eyes Forever.” Cherie Currie pursued a career in acting and released several solo albums. And Sandy West continued to perform and record until her untimely death in 2006.\n\nToday, The Runaways are remembered as trailblazers in the world of rock music. They were one of the first all-female bands to achieve mainstream success, paving the way for countless other female musicians. They were also known for their rebellious spirit and their willingness to push boundaries, both musically and socially.\n\nBut The Runaways’ legacy is not without its controversies. Kim Fowley’s role in the band’s success has been called into question, with some accusing him of exploiting the band members for his own gain. And the band’s image, with its emphasis on sex and rebellion, has been criticized for perpetuating harmful stereotypes.\n\nDespite these criticisms, The Runaways continue to matter today. Their music and their message continue to inspire new generations of musicians, and their legacy is an important reminder of the power of women in rock music. Whether you love them or hate them, there’s no denying that The Runaways were an important part of rock history, and their impact continues to be felt today.\n\nIt is important to note that allegations of sexual assault involving Kim Fowley and Jackie Fox have been made. Fox has stated that Fowley raped her in front of her bandmates after a show in 1975. This incident was not widely known at the time, and Fox did not come forward with her story until many years later. Fowley, who passed away in 2015, never publicly commented on the allegations. The incident has been widely discussed in the media and is a part of The Runaways’ controversial history. It serves as a reminder of the dangers of exploitation and abuse in the music industry, and the importance of creating a safe and equitable environment for all musicians.\n\nAlbums and Standout Tracks:\n\nThe Runaways released a total of four studio albums and one live album during their brief but influential career. Here’s a rundown of each album and some of their most notable songs:\n\nThe Runaways (1976): This self-titled debut album introduced the world to The Runaways’ raw, punk-influenced sound. Some standout tracks include “Cherry Bomb,” which remains one of the band’s most famous songs, and “You Drive Me Wild,” a hard-rocking anthem with killer guitar riffs.\n\n“The Runaways were more important than they were given credit for. They were the missing link between the Velvet Underground, punk and Riot Grrrl.” — Kim Gordon (Sonic Youth)\n\nQueens of Noise (1977): The band’s second album showcased their growth as musicians and songwriters. With hits like “Born to Be Bad” and “California Paradise,” the album solidified The Runaways’ place in the rock pantheon. Other notable tracks include the title track “Queens of Noise” and “Take It or Leave It.”\n\nLive in Japan (1977): Recorded during the band’s 1977 tour of Japan, this album captures The Runaways at their live best. The album includes fan favorites like “Cherry Bomb,” “You Drive Me Wild,” and a cover of The Velvet Underground’s “Rock and Roll.”\n\nWaitin’ for the Night (1977): This album saw The Runaways expanding their sound to include elements of pop and glam rock. The album’s biggest hit was “School Days,” a catchy rock song with a sing-along chorus. Other standout tracks include “Heartbeat” and “Little Sister.”\n\nAnd Now… The Runaways (1978): The band’s final studio album saw a return to their hard-edged, punk-inspired roots. Notable tracks include “Blackmail” and “Neon Angels on the Road to Ruin.”\n\nThe Runaways’ music continues to inspire new generations of musicians, and their influence can be heard in the work of bands like Sleater-Kinney and Bikini Kill. While they may have been a short-lived band, their impact on the music world is undeniable.\n\nBudokan Babes:\n\nThe Runaways’ experience in Japan was a significant moment in the band’s career, particularly due to their successful performance at the Budokan arena in Tokyo. This cultural exchange between the band and the Japanese fans was a unique experience that helped to cement their status as international rock stars.\n\nIn the 1970s, Japan was a key market for Western rock music, and The Runaways quickly became popular among Japanese fans. The band’s music and style resonated with the rebellious spirit of youth culture in Japan, and their message of empowerment for women was especially powerful in a society that still had strict gender roles.\n\n“The Runaways were a force of nature, a gang of misfits who didn’t fit in anywhere else.” — Shirley Manson (Garbage)\n\nThe band’s performances at the Budokan arena were particularly memorable. The Runaways played a series of sold-out shows at the arena, which was a major accomplishment for any band at the time. The shows were high-energy and raw, with the band’s hard punk rock attitude winning over the crowd.\n\nThe cultural exchange between The Runaways and their Japanese fans was also significant. The band members embraced Japanese culture, learning some of the language and customs, and even incorporating traditional Japanese instruments into their music. In turn, the band’s influence on Japanese youth culture was evident in the fashion and music of the time.\n\nThe legacy of The Runaways’ time in Japan can still be felt today. The Budokan shows have become legendary, and the band’s influence on Japanese rock and metal music is undeniable. The cultural exchange that took place during this time helped to break down barriers and bring people together through the power of rock ’n’ roll.\n\nEdgeplay — A Film About The Runaways\n\n“Edgeplay — A Film About The Runaways” is a documentary film about the rise and fall of the influential all-girl rock band, The Runaways. The film was directed by former Runaways bassist Victory Tischler-Blue and was released in 2005.\n\nThe documentary features interviews with all of the original members of the band, including Joan Jett, Cherie Currie, Lita Ford, Sandy West, and Jackie Fox, as well as their manager, Kim Fowley. Through these interviews, the film explores the band’s tumultuous history, from their formation in the mid-1970s to their eventual breakup in 1979.\n\n“I loved The Runaways. I thought they were really brave and really cool.” — Chrissie Hynde (The Pretenders)\n\n“Edgeplay” delves into the band’s personal relationships, drug use, and the tensions that eventually tore them apart. The film also provides a glimpse into the music industry of the time, where female musicians faced sexism and misogyny on a regular basis.\n\nThe documentary features archival footage of The Runaways performing live, as well as behind-the-scenes footage of the band during their tours and recording sessions. The film also includes rare photos and footage of the band members from their childhood and early years in the music industry.\n\n“Edgeplay — A Film About The Runaways” provides a raw and honest look at the band’s history, warts and all. It sheds light on the struggles that the band members faced both personally and professionally, and their impact on the music industry as one of the first all-girl rock bands to achieve success.\n\nThe Runaways Movie\n\n“The Runaways” is a biographical film about the rise of The Runaways, directed by Floria Sigismondi and released in 2010. The movie is based on Cherie Currie’s memoir “Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway,” and stars Kristen Stewart as Joan Jett and Dakota Fanning as Cherie Currie.\n\nThe film chronicles the band’s formation in the mid-1970s, their struggles to be taken seriously as an all-girl rock band, their tours, and their eventual breakup. It also explores the relationships between the band members, particularly the dynamic between Jett and Currie, and their manager, Kim Fowley, who is portrayed as a manipulative and abusive figure.\n\n“The Runaways” received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances of Stewart and Fanning, as well as the film’s depiction of the music industry at the time. However, some criticized the movie for its glamorization of drug use and for simplifying some of the complexities of the band’s history.\n\nJett was one of the executive producers of the film. Actresses Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning starred as Jett and Currie, respectively. Michael Shannon played Fowley. None of the band’s former bass players were featured in the film; Fox did not want to be involved in any part of the film, and requested that her name be changed in the story. The fictional replacement is named Robin Robbins. The film was written and directed by Floria Sigismondi, and was released to limited theaters on March 19, 2010. [Wiki]\n\n“The Runaways” received generally positive reviews from critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 70% rating based on 187 reviews, and an average rating of 6.19/10. [Wiki]\n\nOverall, “The Runaways” offers an entertaining and engaging portrayal of the band’s history, and serves as a tribute to the pioneering role that The Runaways played in the music industry as one of the first all-girl rock bands to achieve commercial success.\n\nThe Runaways — The Originals (Bootleg) (1976–1977):\n\nA double LP set compiling two other single LP bootlegs (The Runaways — Live In Concert and The Runaways — No Olds Allowed), this was released with many different color “insert style” sleeves including: yellow, orange, and blue. There were also different label variations that have shown up with the different color sleeves: Ruthless Rhymes, Dragonfly Records, and blank white labels. And it was released on different colors of vinyl too: black, splatter, and green/yellow.`\n\n- LP 1: At Starwood, September 13th, 1976\n\n- LP 2: Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, April 1st, 1977\n\nRef: https://www.discogs.com/release/4697227-The-Runaways-The-Originals\n\nThe Rock-and-Roll Drug Lifestyle:\n\nAll of the members of The Runaways dove head-first into the heady rock-and-roll lifestyle — the late-nights, the parties, the fans, and of course, the drugs. According to her interview with The Guardian, Cherie Currie shared that the band had extremely easy access to drugs. People would just give them to the girls.\n\n“Our management, our booking agent — they were all feeding us drugs. The thing was, back in the 70s, if you didn’t do drugs, there was something wrong with you,” she said.\n\nCurrie said it started with quaaludes, and she later graduated to cocaine. By the time she was 17, Currie was completely burned out on drugs. She admitted that she continued to struggle with drug addiction long after she left the band. Currie was ultimately able to get her life together and took a job as a tech in the drug and psych wards at Coldwater Canyon Hospital. Eventually, she became a drug and alcohol counselor.\n\nRef: https://www.grunge.com/284624/tragic-details-about-the-runaways/\n\nThe Runaways equipment\n\nLita Ford appeared to favour Gibson Explorer, SG & Les Pauls through Marshall amplifiers in The Runaways.\n\nJoan Jett played a natural Gibson Les Paul & a white Gibson Melody Maker through Marshall or Hiwatt amplifiers.\n\nJackie Fox played Fender & Gibson Firebird or SG bass though Ampeg amplifiers. She is also seen playing a Rickenbacker bass guitar at some shows.\n\nSandy West predominantly played Ludwig drumswith a massive kick and toms!\n\nJoan Jett\n\nJoan Jett is indeed one of the greatest women in rock, and for good reason. She has been a trail-blazer for women in music, inspiring countless musicians and fans with her powerful voice, signature style, and uncompromising attitude.\n\nShe was, I believe, obsessed and influenced by Suzie Quatro; one of the female legends of rock and roll. Joan followed Suzie Quatro’s career, from her early Detroit roots heading to London and taking the world by storm. Quatro was a true pioneer and star of woman’s rock music. Joan wanted to be that too!\n\nOne of the key reasons that Jett is so important is that she broke down barriers for women in rock. When she started her career in the 1970s, it was rare to see a woman fronting a rock band, let alone playing lead guitar. Jett refused to let gender norms hold her back, and her success paved the way for countless other women to pursue careers in rock music.\n\nJett’s music has also had a major impact on the genre. Her band, The Runaways, helped to define the sound of hard rock & punk rock in the 1970s, and her solo work continued to push boundaries with its fusion of punk, hard rock, and pop. Her hits like “I Love Rock ’n’ Roll,” “Bad Reputation,” and “Do You Wanna Touch Me (Oh Yeah)” are all iconic, and they continue to inspire new generations of rock fans.\n\nBeyond her music, Jett has also been an important advocate for LGBTQ rights and animal welfare. She has used her platform to speak out on these issues and has worked to make a positive impact on the world.\n\nOverall, Joan Jett’s legacy as a musician, trailblazer, and activist is truly impressive. She has had a lasting impact on rock music and has inspired generations of women to pursue their dreams, no matter what obstacles they may face.\n\nLita Ford\n\nLita Ford is certainly one of the greatest female metal guitarists in rock. She has been a key figure in the metal scene since the 1980s, and her influence on the genre cannot be overstated.\n\nOne of the reasons that Ford is so important is that she has shattered stereotypes about women and metal. When she first burst onto the scene in the late 1970s as a member of The Runaways, it was rare to see a woman playing hard rock or metal. Ford refused to be held back by these gender norms and became one of the first women to make a name for herself in the genre.\n\nFord’s guitar playing is also incredibly impressive. She is known for her technical prowess and her ability to shred with the best of them. Her solos are often breathtaking and have inspired countless other guitarists.\n\nIn addition to her technical skill, Ford’s music has also had a major impact on the metal genre. Her hits like “Kiss Me Deadly,” “Close My Eyes Forever,” and “Shot of Poison” are all classics, and they have helped to define the sound of 1980s metal.\n\nOverall, Lita Ford’s contributions to metal music cannot be overstated. She has been a key figure in the genre for decades, and her influence on other musicians and fans alike is truly impressive. Her technical skill, powerful music, and trailblazing spirit have made her one of the greatest female metal guitarists in rock.\n\nWhat bands have been influenced by The Runaways?\n\nThe Runaways have had a significant influence on the rock music scene and have inspired many musicians over the years. Some notable bands that have been influenced by The Runaways include:\n\nBikini Kill: This influential feminist punk band has cited The Runaways as one of their primary inspirations.\n\nSleater-Kinney: This punk rock band from Olympia, Washington has also cited The Runaways as an influence, particularly in their early music.\n\nHole: Frontwoman Courtney Love has been vocal about her admiration for The Runaways, and their influence can be heard in many of Hole’s songs.\n\nThe Donnas: This all-female rock band has been compared to The Runaways in terms of their high-energy, guitar-driven sound.\n\nL7: This influential punk rock band has cited The Runaways as one of their primary influences, particularly in their early years.\n\nJoan Jett and the Blackhearts: Joan Jett’s solo career was heavily influenced by her time in The Runaways, and she has continued to pay homage to the band’s legacy throughout her career.\n\nThe Runaways Rock Legacy\n\nOverall, The Runaways have had a lasting impact on the rock music scene and have inspired countless musicians over the years.\n\nJoan Jett was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, although some would say a better option would have been the The Runaways… or at least both!\n\nThe Runaways legacy as trail-blazers for women in rock and as purveyors of raw, unapologetic edgy hard rock & punk will continue to influence generations to come."
