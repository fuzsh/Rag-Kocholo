It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the other television series of the franchise and acknowledging the continuity of the franchise's films. The series is produced by ABC Signature Studios, Marvel Television and Fake Empire, with Schwartz and Savage serving as showrunners.\n\nRhenzy Feliz, Lyrica Okano, Virginia Gardner, Ariela Barer, Gregg Sulkin, and Allegra Acosta star as the Runaways, six teenagers from different backgrounds who unite against their parents, the Pride, portrayed by Angel Parker, Ryan Sands, Annie Wersching, Kip Pardue, Ever Carradine, James Marsters, Brigid Brannagh, Kevin Weisman, Brittany Ishibashi, and James Yaegashi. Julian McMahon also stars in the second season as Jonah, after recurring in the first, while Clarissa Thibeaux stars in the third season as Xavin, after recurring in the second.\n\nA film from Marvel Studios based on the Runaways began development in May 2008, before being shelved in 2013 due to the success of The Avengers. In August 2016, Marvel Television announced that Runaways had received a pilot order from Hulu, after being developed and written by Schwartz and Savage. Casting for the Runaways and the Pride were revealed in February 2017, and filming of the pilot began in Los Angeles that month. The series was officially ordered by Hulu in May 2017.\n\nThe first season was released from November 21, 2017, to January 9, 2018. The show was renewed for a 13-episode second season, which was released in its entirety on December 21, 2018. The third and final season of ten episodes, which included a crossover with fellow Marvel Television young adult series Cloak & Dagger, was released on December 13, 2019. Runaways was removed from Hulu in May 2023 as part of Disney's cost-cutting measures.\n\nPremise\n\n[edit]\n\nSix teenagers from different backgrounds unite against a common enemy – their criminal parents,[1] who collectively run an organization called Pride.[2] In the second season, the teenagers are now on the run from their parents, living on their own and figuring out how to stop Pride.[3] The third season sees Nico Minoru and the other members of the team face off against aliens and Morgan le Fay.\n\nCast and characters\n\n[edit]\n\nMain\n\n[edit]\n\nRhenzy Feliz as Alex Wilder: A nerd who longs to reunite with his childhood friends. He has a high intellect and is the leader of the Runaways.[5]\n\nLyrica Okano as Nico Minoru:\n\nA Wiccan who isolates herself with her gothic appearance and is a member of the Runaways.[5] Unlike the comics, Nico does not summon the Staff of One through self-harm. Okano said this was tweaked, \"for good reason\" as there would be \"a lot of young teenagers watching the show and we don't want to promote anything like self-harm because that's serious\". She added that an element of drawing blood would still be involved.[6]\n\nVirginia Gardner as Karolina Dean:\n\nA human-alien hybrid burdened by her religious upbringing who wants to pursue her own desires instead of following in her mother's footsteps, and is a member of the Runaways.[5] Karolina has the ability of flight, to glow with rainbow-colored light, and to shoot beams of light.[7]\n\nAriela Barer as Gertrude Yorkes: A riot grrrl, social activist, and a member of the Runaways. She also has a telepathic link with her genetically engineered dinosaur, Old Lace.[5]\n\nGregg Sulkin as Chase Stein:\n\nA high school lacrosse player who is often dismissed as a dumb jock, but displays brilliance in engineering and is a member of the Runaways.[5] Sulkin and the writers wanted the character to be \"more layered\" than the comics, and Sulkin felt that Chase was the most changed of the Runaways from the source material.[8] The character is depicted as having the potential to be as much of a genius as his father is,[9] and builds gadgets, including powerful weaponized gauntlets called \"Fistigons\".[10] Connor Falk portrays a young Chase.[11]\n\nAllegra Acosta as Molly Hayes Hernandez:\n\nThe youngest member of the Runaways who is characterized by her positive attitude. Molly discovers she has the ability of superhuman strength and invulnerability.[5] Evelyn Angelos portrays a young Molly.[12]\n\nAngel Parker as Catherine Wilder: Alex's mother, a successful lawyer, and a member of Pride.[2]\n\nRyan Sands as Geoffrey Wilder: Alex's father and a self-made business man who had a grueling path to his success and is a member of Pride.[2]\n\nAnnie Wersching as Leslie Ellerh Dean:\n\nKarolina's mother, one of the leaders of the cult-like religious group the Church of Gibborim and a member of the Pride.[2][13] Mia Topalian portrays a young Leslie Ellerh, while Charlie Townsend portrays her as a toddler.\n\nKip Pardue as Frank Dean:\n\nKarolina's father, a former teen star who is struggling in his professional acting career and becomes one of the leaders of the Church of Gibborim.[2][13] Unlike the comics, Frank is not currently a member of Pride. Pardue described the character as the \"liaison\" between the Runaways and Pride, saying, \"This whole show is about the kids fighting their parents. Frank toes that line and has to find out where his allegiances lie\".[14]\n\nEver Carradine as Janet Stein: Chase's mother who has a brilliant mind, is \"a perfect PTA mom\", and a member of Pride.[2] Sorel Carradine (Ever's cousin) portrays a young Janet.[11]\n\nJames Marsters as Victor Stein:\n\nChase's father, an engineering genius and a member of Pride.[2] Marsters was inspired by Vincent D'Onofrio's portrayal of Wilson Fisk in Daredevil, saying it was \"exactly opposite of what I was expecting\", and also looked for common ground with Victor, saying, \"I'm not an abusive parent but I'm not a perfect parent. I don't think anyone is.\" He added that Victor just wants Chase to live up to his potential.[9] Tim Pocock portrays a young Victor.[11]\n\nBrigid Brannagh as Stacey Yorkes: Gert's mother, a bioengineer, and a member of Pride.[2]\n\nKevin Weisman as Dale Yorkes: Gert's father, a bioengineer, and a member of Pride.[2]\n\nBrittany Ishibashi as Tina Minoru:\n\nNico's mother who is a brilliant innovator, ruthless CEO, and perfectionist \"tiger mom\" who is a member of Pride.[2] The character previously appeared in the film Doctor Strange, in a minor role as a Master of the Mystic Arts, portrayed by Linda Louise Duan.[15][16][17] The producers felt free to recast the role and create a different version of Tina Minoru since Duan was not named as the character in the film.[18]\n\nJames Yaegashi as Robert Minoru: Nico's father and a member of Pride who is a brilliant innovator.[2]\n\nJulian McMahon as Jonah:\n\nKarolina's biological father, a member of the alien race known as the Gibborim who is the Pride's benefactor.[19] McMahon described Jonah as \"the wealthy guy who's pretty ego-driven and mission-driven... who's trying to accomplish certain things and if something were to get in his way he'd plow through it\", which he felt was similar to Victor von Doom, whom he portrayed in Fantastic Four and its sequel. He also revealed that he did not appear in the earlier episodes as the character in his near-death state, as he had been cast after the first four episodes had been completed.[20] Ric Sarabia portrayed the character in this state,[21] which McMahon stated took five hours of make up application to achieve.[20]\n\nClarissa Thibeaux as Xavin: A shape shifting alien who believes in a prophecy that they are betrothed to Karolina.\n\nRecurring\n\n[edit]\n\nIntroduced in season 1\n\n[edit]\n\nDanielle Campbell as Eiffel: A girl who attends Atlas Academy and looks down on Karolina and has a crush on Chase.\n\nPat Lentz as Aura: A member of the Church of Gibborim who works for the Deans.

Friends Alex Wilder, Nico Minoru, Karolina Dean, Gert Yorkes, Chase Stein, and Molly Hernandez have grown apart since the death of Nico's sister, Amy, two years earlier. Alex uses a meeting for their parents' group the Pride to reach out to the others, but they turn him down. They later change their minds: Karolina removes her Church of Gibborim bracelet at a party, sees her hands glowing, and loses consciousness. Chase rescues her from being raped; because of this, Chase stands Gert up for a study session, and she picks up her adopted sister Molly, who has discovered that she has super strength and that their parents have a creature in the basement; and Nico arrives after failing to contact Amy's spirit in a ritual. The gathering is awkward, but they soon discover a secret passage in the house that leads to their parents sacrificing Destiny in a ritual. Molly's camera flash is seen by the parents.\n\n22\"Rewind\"Roxann DawsonJosh Schwartz & Stephanie SavageNovember 21, 2017 ( )\n\nBefore the ritual, Geoffrey Wilder had confronted an old associate from his time as a criminal, threatening him against interfering with the Pride's construction project. Victor Stein is having issues testing the container used in the ritual; Leslie Dean convinces Destiny not to leave the Church of Gibborim until she reaches the stage of \"Ultra\", which involves the then-upcoming secret ritual; and her husband Frank, an actor who is not a member of the Pride, loses his agent due to his role as cofounder of the Church. The group are all reluctant to sacrifice someone the same age as their children, but go ahead anyway. When they see the flash, they race to investigate, but are convinced by the children that there was an electrical problem in the house. Geoffrey later finds Molly's hairpin outside the entrance to the secret passage, while Victor realizes that his container malfunctioned and Destiny is still alive inside it. Meanwhile, Frank unsuccessfully attempts to enter Leslie's private study, where a decrepit figure lies in another of Victor's containers.\n\n33\"Destiny\"Nina Lopez-CorradoKalinda VazquezNovember 21, 2017 ( )\n\nKarolina is told that Destiny is officially in London for a Church trip. Nico investigates the Staff of One, but is unable to control its power and calls Alex for help. Chase and Gert use some of Victor's inventions to search for Destiny in the Steins' house, and then discover that the creature in the Yorkeses' house is a dinosaur genetically engineered by Gert's parents. Tina and Robert Minoru attempt to deal with their deteriorating marriage, due to Amy's death, but it ends with Robert continuing a secret affair with Janet Stein, and Tina returning home to find Nico and Alex (who pretend to be romantically and sexually involved to avoid suspicion, but later start to genuinely love each other). Catherine Wilder confronts Molly, but the latter lies; saying she had been sneaking around to steal alcohol for the other children. Catherine promises to tell Molly about her parents, who died in a fire when Molly was young (the Pride members blamed each other for doing this). The Yorkeses plan to move with Gert, Molly, and their dinosaur to a remote ranch in Yucatan now that the Pride is over, but then Destiny's body is found.\n\n44\"Fifteen\"Ramsey NickellTamara Becher-WilkinsonNovember 28, 2017 ( )\n\nThe Pride holds an emergency meeting, though the Yorkes are out searching for their missing dinosaur. Victor accepts responsibility for the failed sacrifice; so he and Robert go to find a new one. They attempt to kidnap a homeless man, but they bungle the act and are arrested. Karolina is labeled a slut at school, and Chase is told to apologize to his lacrosse team; who he injured when he stopped them from raping her. He instead quits the team. Karolina reveals to Chase how her body glows without her bracelet. She and Gert also look for proof of their parents' innocence, but with Alex's help, they realize that Leslie has been selecting people from her church to sacrifice for years. This does not include Amy, who appeared to commit suicide, though Nico believes she was murdered by the Pride. She goes to the police, but leaves when she sees Victor and Robert talking with a policeman apparently on their payroll. The Yorkeses find the dinosaur, doing what Gert tells her to do, and are threatened by Tina who knows about Yucatan. Alex is kidnapped.\n\n55\"Kingdom\"Jeffrey W. ByrdRodney Barnes & Michael VukadinovichDecember 5, 2017 ( )\n\nIn flashback, Geoffrey makes a deal with the mysterious Jonah to buy up land and has to convince his cellmate Darius to take the blame for shooting someone to get out of prison. In the present, Darius has kidnapped Alex as ransom for Geoffrey to pay one million dollars. Nico gets Karolina, Gert, Molly, and Chase to come to the rescue, using the staff to find Alex. Geoffrey shows up with LAPD officers to take out Darius and his men, Alex shoots Andre, one of Darius' goons, but he gets taken again. Alex's friends show up and use their newfound abilities force Darius to run. Alex makes it back to Geoffrey, who tells him to go home while he preps Andre for a sacrifice. The kids barge into the secret room, only to realize that the Pride has moved the sacrifice somewhere else. Tina reveals that she knows Nico used the staff, but allows her to use it. Victor's time machine shows Los Angeles crumbling in the future. Frank fails to achieve Ultra. The sacrifice succeeds this time, revealing that the man the Pride was reviving is Jonah, who asks Leslie to meet \"her\".\n\n66\"Metamorphosis\"Patrick NorrisKalinda VazquezDecember 12, 2017 ( )\n\nJonah has all the parents recorded during their first sacrifice so as to keep them in check and to prevent them from leaving the Pride. The Pride hosts their annual gala and the kids use the time to download footage of the previous sacrifices from the Minorus' servers. Gert walks in on an intimate confession between Karolina and Nico, and asks Karolina if she likes her. Karolina ignores her comment and tells her that she would love that since it would allow her to be with Chase. While drunk on the roof, Karolina discovers she can fly and Chase kisses her, which she is placid to. Alex and Nico break into Tina's office to get the footage, causing Nico to become suspicious of him as he knew the password rather easily. During the Pride members' speech, Victor reveals his knowledge of Robert and Janet's tryst and collapses from his brain tumor. Jonah uses his experimental medicine to revive him, making him happily euphoric with his family. Frank appears to know about Leslie and Jonah's secret relationship but keeps this information to himself. Molly, in an effort to learn more about her parents, accidentally lets slip to Catherine about her knowledge of the Pride.\n\n77\"Refraction\"Peter HoarQuinton PeeplesDecember 19, 2017 ( )\n\nVictor sees a message from Chase from the future telling him not to pick up the fistigons. Frank gets healing gloves from Jonah, causing Leslie to become suspicious. Molly becomes distant from the others and tries joining the cheerleaders, but finds solace with Karolina's friendship with her. Dale and Stacy discover that Jonah's cure makes people hyperactive and euphoric, but gives them a drawn-out hangover. At an open house, Leslie gets Janet to break up with Robert, who agrees due to Victor's changing behavior and has Tina take Robert back. Geoffrey and Catherine tell Dale and Stacy that they must do something about Molly as she knows about the Pride's activities. They tell Molly she is going to be sent away, which angers her. Gert comforts her and convinces her to leave to keep the group safe. Frank discovers that Jonah has been living for a long time and finally confronts Leslie about what she and Jonah have been doing. Nico forces Alex to reveal how he knew Tina's password. Victor suddenly becomes violent again and attacks his son with the fistigons, only to get shot by Janet.\n\n88\"Tsunami\"Millicent SheltonRodney Barnes & Michael VukadinovichDecember 26, 2017 ( )\n\nVictor bleeds out as the Pride members arrive to try and patch him up, though this proves to be ineffective and he slips into a coma. Leslie summons Frank to use his healing gloves, but they fail and Victor dies. Tina contacts Jonah, who instructs them to sacrifice Janet for Victor, causing the Pride to argue. Robert decides to sacrifice himself instead, but Tina destroys the pod; reaffirming her devotion to him. Victor is carried away to be revived later. Karolina decides to tell Frank everything she knows about the Pride, getting him to her side. Alex reveals to an angry Nico that he was aware of Amy's snooping and was told to keep her information secret. Molly ends up living with her relative, Graciela, who gives her a letter containing a key. It leads her to a locker with a VHS tape. Nico finds Amy's things and Alex successfully gets the footage of their parents, but his laptop is destroyed by Chase because Pride is the only way to save his father. In flashback, Amy learns from Alex that her laptop was hacked and confides her findings to Kincaid. Amy tries to run away from home, but is caught by an unseen man.\n\n99\"Doomsday\"Jeremy WebbJiehae Park & Kendall RogersJanuary 2, 2018 ( )\n\nTen years prior, Leslie murders Gene and Alice Hernandez with a bomb while Tina listens on the phone. Molly survives due to strange glowing rocks that she is holding. In the present, Janet covers for Victor's absence to the public as Jonah tasks the remaining Pride members with his current plan; to use Geoffrey's drilling company to dig a hole underneath Los Angeles. Darius monitors the area and voices his suspicions to his wife. Molly returns to the group with the VHS tape, which contains a video from her parents warning her about the Pride's activities. The kids decide to use the school dance as a cover to infiltrate the drilling site. Before leaving, Gert and Chase have sex while Karolina kisses Nico, revealing her feelings for her. Frank reveals everything he knows to Jonah, who relays the fact that the kids know everything to their parents. The kids arrive at the drilling site and manage to stop the drill. The Pride arrive to confront their kids, who have all decided to finally take a stand. The kids reveal their powers and the Pride is shocked.\n\n1010\"Hostile\"Marc JobstQuinton PeeplesJanuary 9, 2018 ( )\n\nKarolina is kidnapped by Jonah while the rest of the Runaways hide. They make it to the woods outside L.A. and Gert lets her dinosaur, now named Old Lace, go. Finding new disguises, Chase and Molly sneak into the Church of Gibborim to rescue Karolina while Alex waits outside and overhears his parents announcing their intent to find him themselves. Leslie and the Yorkeses discover that Jonah is digging for something \"alive\". Leslie reveals that she was indirectly responsible for Amy's death and that she is unsure of Frank's loyalty. She manages to convince the Yorkeses, the Minorus, and Janet to join her in killing Jonah. Alex makes a deal with Darius; telling him everything about the Pride. In return, Darius gives Alex hundreds of dollars and a gun. Jonah plans his next move with Frank over Victor's body and notices that he needs another sacrifice.

Vaughan was hired to write a screenplay for Marvel Studios in May 2008, based on his comic book Runaways.[27] Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige and producer Jodi Hildebrand envisioned the film as a coming-of-age story in the style of director John Hughes.[28]: 169 In April 2010, Marvel hired Peter Sollett to direct the film,[29] and a month later Drew Pearce signed on to write a new script.[30] The film was developed under the working title Small Faces, referencing the 1960s rock band Small Faces.[28]: 171 Development on the film was put on hold in October 2010,[31] with Vaughan later noting Marvel Studios had decided to focus their efforts on a Guardians of the Galaxy film (2014) instead.[32] Pearce explained in September 2013 that the Runaways film had been shelved due to the success of The Avengers (2012); the earliest the film could be made was for Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[33] In October 2014, after announcing Marvel's Phase Three films without Runaways, Feige said the project was \"still an awesome script that exists in our script vault ... In our television and future film discussions, it's always one that we talk about, because we have a solid draft there. [But] we can't make them all.\"[34]\n\nDevelopment\n\n[edit]\n\nMarvel Television, based at ABC Studios, was waiting for the right showrunner before moving forward with a television take on the characters. Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, whose company Fake Empire had an overall deal with ABC, independently brought up the property during a general meeting with the studio,[35][1] and, by August 2016, the pair had spent a year conversing with Marvel about turning Runaways into a television series. That month, it was announced that streaming service Hulu had ordered a pilot episode and scripts for a full season of Runaways, to be co-produced by Marvel Television, ABC Signature Studios, and Fake Empire. Hulu was believed to already have \"an eye toward a full-season greenlight\".[1][36] Executive producer Jeph Loeb felt \"it was an easy decision\" to have Hulu air the series over the other networks Marvel Television works with, because \"[w]e were very excited about the possibility of joining a network that was young and growing in the same way that when we went to Netflix when it was young and growing on the original side. It really feels like we're in the right place at the right time with the right show.\" Loeb and Marvel Television were also impressed by the success of Hulu's The Handmaid's Tale, which helped further justify the decision.[37] Schwartz and Savage wrote the pilot, and serve as showrunners on the series, as well as executive producers alongside Loeb and Jim Chory.[1][36] In May 2017, Runaways received a 10-episode series order from Hulu at their annual advertising upfront presentation.[38]\n\nFake Empire's Lis Rowinski produces the series,[1][36] and Vaughan serves as an executive consultant.[5] On this, Vaughan noted he \"did a little consulting early in the process\", but felt the series \"found the ideal 'foster parents' in Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage ... [who] lovingly adapted [the comics] into a stylish drama that feels like contemporary Los Angeles\". He also praised the cast, crew and writers working on the series, and felt the pilot looked \"like an Adrian Alphona comic\", referring to the artist who worked with Vaughan when he created the characters.[39] Loeb said that it had been Schwartz and Savage who had asked that Vaughan be involved, and said that this was something that \"a lot of showrunners don't immediately gravitate towards\". In discussions with Vaughan, Marvel found that he \"really wanted to be involved and make sure that it was done, not just properly, but in a way that it would last 100 episodes\".[40] Vaughan also believed Runaways was \"much more at home on television\" than if it had been adapted to a feature film as originally developed. He was supportive of the various changes Schawartz and Savage made, such as altering Molly Hayes to become Molly Hernandez and being a slightly older age as well as introducing a sister for Nico Minoru who had died, stating the comic material, originally written in 2003, needed to evolve for the series.[32]\n\nOn January 8, 2018, Hulu renewed the series for a 13-episode second season.[41] On March 24, 2019, Hulu renewed the series for a ten-episode third season.[42] That November, it was announced that the third season would be the series's last.[43]\n\nWriting\n\n[edit]\n\nSchwartz was a fan of the Runaways comic for some time, and introduced it to Savage, saying, \"When you're a teenager, everything feels like life and death, and the stakes in this story—really felt like that.\" Loeb described the series as The O.C. of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU),[35] which Schwartz said meant \"treating the problems of teenagers as if they are adults\" and having the series \"feel true and authentic to the teenage experience, even in this heightened context\".[18] Loeb noted that it would deal with modern political issues by saying, \"This is a time when figures of authority are in question, and this is a story where teenagers are at that age where they see their parents as fallible and human. Just because someone is in charge, doesn't mean that they're here to do good.\"[35] The producers did note that the series would explore the parents' perspective as well, with the pilot telling the story from the Runaways' perspective, and the second episode showing the same story from their parents'—the Pride's—perspective, with the two stories converging midway through the first season.[44]\n\nSchwartz likened the tone of Runaways to that of the comics it was based on, calling it \"so distinct\", saying much of the tone Vaughn used when writing the comics overlapped with the tones Schwartz and Savage like to work in.[18] The pair were excited by the freedom given to them by Hulu over the usual broadcasters they were used to working with, such as allowing the children to swear in the show, not having set lengths for each episode, and being able to explore the parents' story; Hulu wanted \"something that felt broad and where we could push the envelope in places\". Schwartz described the series as a coming-of-age story and a family drama, with focus on the characters that can lead to long stretches of the series not featuring super powers, so \"if you didn't see the show title, you wouldn't know that you were in a Marvel show for long stretches ... That was our aesthetic starting place, but there are episodes where there's some good [Marvel] stuff.\"[40]\n\nSpeaking to the second season, Schwartz felt the series would \"accelerate\" since the season would be following the kids on the run, saying, \"Our focus shifts to these kids and trying to survive in the streets... there's a greater sense of tension and momentum in keeping with where we are in this part of the story.\" He added that the kids' experience on the run would force them to grow up and make them confront and deal with adult themes quickly.[45] He added that the relationship between Nico and Karolina that began at the end of the first season would be \"the emotional core\" of the second.[46] As for the parents in the season, Schwartz described them as racing against the clock \"to find their kids before something catastrophic potentially could occur\".[45] Since the kids know about their powers, they are utilized more in the season. Additionally, the hostel the kids move into is a dilapidated mansion under Griffith Park.[47]\n\nWith the third season being the final one of the series, \"the story [was] said to come to a natural ending point\".[43] When crafting the season, Schwartz and Savage were unsure if the season would be the last for the series, so they \"wanted to ensure that the finale was as satisfying as possible\" and crafted it as if it was a series finale, while \"hav[ing] the potential for another story out there whether it's something that we get to see onscreen or something that lives on in the imagination of the audience.\" The final moments of the episode see Alex find a note from his future self, telling him to hide \"Mancha\" and to kill Nico; in the comics, Victor Mancha was the son of Ultron who would join the Runaways to become a hero, and Alex betrays his friends. Time travel elements are also featured in the final episode, something teased in the previous seasons, which Savage said was \"in the DNA of the comics so it was something that we wanted to honor\".[48]\n\nCasting\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2017, Marvel announced the casting of the Runaways, with Rhenzy Feliz as Alex Wilder, Lyrica Okano as Nico Minoru, Virginia Gardner as Karolina Dean, Ariela Barer as Gert Yorkes, Gregg Sulkin as Chase Stein, and Allegra Acosta as Molly Hayes Hernandez.[5] Shortly after, Marvel announced the casting of the Pride, with Ryan Sands as Geoffrey Wilder, Angel Parker as Catherine Wilder, Brittany Ishibashi as Tina Minoru, James Yaegashi as Robert Minoru, Kevin Weisman as Dale Yorkes, Brigid Brannagh as Stacey Yorkes, Annie Wersching as Leslie Ellerh Dean, Kip Pardue as Frank Dean, James Marsters as Victor Stein, and Ever Carradine as Janet Stein.[2] Loeb praised casting director Patrick Rush, explaining that all of the series regulars for Runaways were the producers' first choice for the role. The majority of the children are portrayed by \"fresh faces\", which was an intentional choice.[40] By August 2017, Julian McMahon had been cast in the recurring role of Jonah.[19] He was promoted to series regular for the second season.[49]\n\nFor the second season, Schwartz noted that \"really popular, exciting characters\" from the comics would appear.[45] In October 2018, it was announced that Jan Luis Castellanos had joined the cast as Topher.[3] Clarissa Thibeaux was cast as Xavin.[50]\n\nIn June 2019, Elizabeth Hurley was announced as cast in the role of Morgan le Fay for the third season.[23]\n\nFilming\n\n[edit]\n\nFilming of the pilot began by February 10, 2017,[51] in Los Angeles,[52] under the working title Rugrats,[53] and concluded on March 3.[54] Director Brett Morgen was given free rein by Marvel and Hulu to establish the look of the series,[55] and wanted to create a feel that was \"very grounded and authentic\".[40] He also looked to differentiate between the hand-held, gritty world of the Runaways and the more stylistic world of the Pride. He felt the latter could be explored more in the series moving forward, but was not available to direct any more episodes of the season.[55] Following completion of the pilot and the show's pick-up to series, there was concern among the cast and crew that the impending writers' strike would prevent the series to move forward. However, the strike did not happen, and filming for the rest of the season began at the end of June, again in Los Angeles.[8] Production on the season had concluded by October 21.[56]\n\nProduction of the second season began the week of April 23, 2018, again in Los Angeles under the working title Rugrats.[57][58] Filming for the season continued until late September 2018.[58][59] Filming for the third season began on May 13, 2019.[60]\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nIn May 2017, Siddhartha Khosla was hired to compose the music for the series.[61] Khosla said that, due to his history as a songwriter, his scoring process involves \"working on these song-stories and weaving them through different episodes\". He described the Runaways score as being \"completely synthesized\",[62] utilizing analog synthesizers from the 1980s, specifically the Roland Juno-60 and Oberheim Electronics' synths. Khosla compared the \"alternative feel\" of his score to Depeche Mode, adding \"there is an element of rebellion, so sonically going for something that is a little bit outside the box, non-traditional, I felt was an appropriate approach. I feel like I'm making art on this show.\"[63] Alex Patsavas serves as music supervisor, having done so on all of Schwartz and Savage's previous series.[18] On January 12, 2018, a soundtrack from the first season consisting of 12 licensed tracks plus two by Khosla, was released digitally.[64]\n\nAdditionally, the original score for the series was released digitally on January 26.[64] All music by Siddhartha Khosla:[65]\n\nMarvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins\n\n[edit]\n\nLoeb confirmed in July 2017 that the series would be set in the MCU but that the show's characters would not be concerned with the actions of the Avengers, for example, saying, \"Would you be following Iron Man [on social media] or would you be following someone your own age? The fact that they've found each other and they're going through this mystery together at the moment is what we're concerned about, not what Captain America is doing.\" The showrunners considered the series' connection to the MCU to be \"liberating\" since it allowed them to set the series in a universe where superheroes and fantasy are already established and do not need to be explained to the audience.[66] Schwartz said they \"were very capable of telling the story that we wanted to tell independent of any of the other Marvel stories that are out there.\"[18] Initially, Loeb had said that there were no plans to crossover across networks with the similarly themed Cloak & Dagger on Freeform, as Marvel wanted the series to find its footing before further connecting with other elements of the universe, though \"You'll see things that comment on each other; we try to touch base wherever we can... things that are happening in L.A. are not exactly going to be affecting what's happening in New Orleans [where Cloak & Dagger is set]... It's being aware of it and trying to find a way [to connect] that makes sense.\"[44] On August 1, 2019, it was revealed that season 3 would include a crossover episode with Cloak & Dagger.[26]\n\nRoxxon Energy, a company featured throughout the MCU, has its logo shown in the series.[67] It also mentions Wakanda.[68] Speaking to the third season, the showrunners said the series would \"deepen [its] connection\" to the Marvel Universe.[42] It features the Dark Dimension, as well as the Darkhold as it was portrayed on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D..[69]\n\nMarketing\n\n[edit]\n\nCast members and Schwartz and Savage appeared at New York Comic Con 2017 to promote the series,[70] where a trailer for the series was revealed, along with a screening of the first episode.[71] The series had its red carpet premiere at the Regency Bruin Theatre in Westwood, Los Angeles on November 16, 2017.[72]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nRunaways premiered its first three episodes on Hulu in the United States on November 21, 2017, with the first season consisting of 10 episodes,[37] and concluding on January 9, 2018.[74] The series aired on Showcase in Canada, premiering on November 22,[75] and aired on Syfy in the United Kingdom premiering on April 18, 2018.[76] The premiere episode made its broadcast debut in the United States on Freeform on August 2, 2018, following the airing of the first-season finale of Cloak & Dagger; the airing is part of Freeform's ongoing marketing partnership with Hulu.[77] The first season was also made available on Disney+ when it launched on November 12, 2019.[78] The second season, consisting of 13 episodes,[41] was released in its entirety on December 21, 2018. The third season was released on December 13, 2019, and became available on Disney+, along with season two, on January 10, 2020.[80][81] Runaways was removed from Hulu and Disney+ globally on May 26, 2023, as part of Disney's cost-cutting measures. The series was still available to purchase or rent through video on demand services.[82] In May 2024, Runaways was acquired by the CW, making it available to watch through its platform.[83]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nCritical response of RunawaysSeasonRotten TomatoesMetacritic186% (84 reviews)[84]68 (22 reviews)[85]288% (24 reviews)[86]—383% (12 reviews)[87]—\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 86% approval rating for the first season, based on 84 reviews, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website's consensus reads, \"Earnest, fun, and more balanced than its source material, Runaways finds strong footing in an over-saturated genre.\"[84] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 68 out of 100 based on 22 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[85]\n\nReviewing the first two episodes of the series, Joseph Schmidt of ComicBook.com praised the show for its faithfulness to the comics, but also for some of the changes it made, appreciating the increased focus on the parents. He thought the cast portraying the Runaways was \"pretty spot on\", but \"many of the parents are scene stealers\", highlighting the performances of Marsters, Wersching, and Pardue.[88]\n\nThe second season has an approval rating of 88% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 24 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"Runaways hits the ground running in its sophomore season, but though it deepens the connections between its expansive cast, formulaic stories and an over-dependence on plot devices holds it back from fully maturing into a compelling character study.\"[86]\n\nThe third season has an approval rating of 83% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"By focusing on its strong ensemble and the character moments fans have come to love, Runaways ends its three season run on an exciting–and surprisingly introspective–high note.\"[87]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Award Category Recipient Result Ref. 2017 Golden Issue Awards Best Ensemble Cast Runaways Won [89] 2018 Jerry Goldsmith Awards Best Score for a TV show Siddhartha Khosla Nominated [90] Saturn Awards Best New Media Superhero Series Runaways Nominated [91] 2019 BMI Awards BMI Streaming Media Awards Siddhartha Khosla Won [92] Saturn Awards Best Streaming Superhero Television Series Runaways Nominated [93] Teen Choice Awards Choice Drama TV Show Runaways Nominated [94]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
