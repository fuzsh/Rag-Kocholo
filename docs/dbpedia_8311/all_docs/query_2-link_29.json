Without missing a beat Joan said. 'You're gettin' close.\" Jackie West Mojo May 2000\n\n\"Girls got balls...They're just a little higher up that's all...\n\n'We're gonna end up like The New York Dolls. Having our albums repackaged and bought and drooled over by the people who said we were shit before we split.\" Joan Jett1978 NME\n\nDressed in tight lycra, corsets, stockings and hotpants meant that they would feature in music papers as flesh rather than for musical ability; yet they could play. They also encountered animosity from male bands like Molly Hatchet, who they headlined over, and the pompous arseholes Rush who didn't think girls should play rock'n'roll or even other bands who wouldn't let them soundcheck. In contrast great tours with bands like The Ramones, Cheap Trick and Motorhead showed that all men weren't dickheads.\n\n\"I think we're great, so fuck off anybody who thinks we suck 'cause we're girls. Stop putting us down\" Joan Jett Sounds 1.7.78\n\nFrom the start Lita preferred a more heavy rock sound to Joan Jett's punkier leanings and eventually differences between Joan and Lita would see the band split up for good permanently."
